AUSTRALIAN' WHEAT EXPORTS TO RHODESIA ENDED<br />
The export of wheat from Australia to Rhodesia will no longer<br />
be permitted. This was announced today by the Minister for Foreign Affairs,<br />
Mr Whitlam, after reviewing the circumstances under which wheat exports<br />
haid been permitted since the United Nations sanctions were imposed on<br />
Rhodesia in 1968.<br />
" The Government is satisfied that humanitarian considerations<br />
no longer justify our wheat exports to Rhodesia," Mr Whitlai said.<br />
The United Nations Security Council's resolution which imposed<br />
sanctions on Rhodesia exempted the export of foodstuffs to that country<br />
in special humnanitarian circumstances. Up to now wheat exports to<br />
Rhodesia have been allowed on these grounds.<br />
Mr Whitlam also said that the Secretary-General of the United<br />
Nations was being informed today of the Government's decision.<br />
" The Australian Government strongly supports the United Nations'<br />
efforts to bring to an end the illegal minority regime in Rhodesia, and<br />
accordingly will strictly enforce sanctions imposed on it" Mr Whitlan<br />
added. </p>
