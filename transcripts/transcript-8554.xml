PRIME MINISTER<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P. J. KEATING MP<br />
LAUNCH OF LIFE BE IN IT PROGRAM " ACTIVATE"<br />
MELBOURNE, 23 JUNE 1992<br />
Ladies and gentlemen,<br />
I am very glad to be here today to launch this Life Be In<br />
It program called " Activate".<br />
Life Be In It is an Australian phenomenon. I doubt if<br />
many who were there when the organisation was founded in<br />
1975 imagined it would still be going strong today.<br />
Alex Stitt who drew the original Norm and continues to<br />
draw him and who is here today, might know the answer<br />
to that.<br />
It has lasted because it is a great idea, and a selfsustaining<br />
one. It includes people, it works on the idea<br />
of partnership with the community and for this reason<br />
it has been able to consistently come up with more ideas<br />
along the way.<br />
This idea " Activate" is surely one of the best, and<br />
the Government is delighted to be a part of it.<br />
Dr Ian Bennett has explained the details of the program,<br />
but I do want to say this:<br />
This program draws its strength from the strength of<br />
Australia itself.<br />
It draws on the energy, ideas and skills the force if<br />
you like of strategic partnerships between government,<br />
industry and the community itself.<br />
That is the beauty of the idea. That's what will see<br />
this program succeed. And that's why I hope and believe<br />
that the same principle will be brought to other programs<br />
for the unemployed in coming months. </p>
<p>It will most certainly be brought to next month's<br />
national meeting on youth employment and training in<br />
Canberra. Recovery from the recession, the problem of long term<br />
unemployment, the need to re-structure our industry and<br />
seize the opportunities which await us in the world all<br />
these things critically depend on forming these national<br />
partnerships, in substance and in spirit.<br />
In the 1980s we unleashed an enormous amount of economic<br />
energy, not all of it well focussed.<br />
This must be the decade when we re-direct that energy<br />
toward productive investment in competitive industries.<br />
We will do that the incentives are there.<br />
Ultimately this is what will solve the problem of<br />
unemployment this and our determination to train<br />
Australians for the jobs of the future.<br />
Because there is nothing more important to most<br />
Australians than the right to a job.<br />
It is the principal means by which our self-esteem is<br />
built. It is the way we advance ourselves. It is the<br />
way we advance Australia.<br />
For those who have nothing to sell but their labour, it<br />
is the only means of security.<br />
The right to work has always been central to our idea of<br />
what constitutes a fair go.<br />
That is why the Government is making such an effort to<br />
secure jobs for the long term by transforming TAFE into<br />
an education system of status and quality.<br />
It is why " Activate", which is funded under our Jobskills<br />
program, has our unqualified support it provides both<br />
work and training, which means that the people who emerge<br />
from it will have valuable, transferable skills and<br />
that means they will have a future in the modern world.<br />
These are the essentials of any useful response to the<br />
problem of unemployment industries with a future,<br />
training the future.<br />
As I said, we can do those things. We can do what is<br />
necessary to encourage productive investment. We can<br />
renovate our vocational training system.<br />
It will take time and it will not be without difficulty,<br />
but we can do it.<br />
But, even as we do these things, I believe we must do one<br />
thing more. </p>
<p>3<br />
We have to restore faith in Australia.<br />
I think we have to invest the nation with the same degree<br />
of hope and meaning it had for my generation and the ones<br />
before it.<br />
The generation before mine lived in much harder times<br />
than these, and they had, on the face of it much less<br />
reason for hope.<br />
But they did believe in this country. They believed it<br />
had a destiny to fulfil.<br />
That faith played no small part in seeing them through.<br />
And in seeing Australia through.<br />
I'm not sure that this country has quite that meaning for<br />
Australians today.<br />
I don't think for a moment that we will re-kindle faith<br />
and hope by looking backwards, or by standing still.<br />
We won't do it either by paying old obeisances or talking<br />
about the good old days of dead end jobs.<br />
Nor will we do it, incidentally, by cutting into the<br />
advanced and comprehensive social programs we have built<br />
and maintained over a century, and which are today the<br />
hallmark of Australian civilisation.<br />
I think we will best restore that faith and confidence<br />
in fact we will only restore it by confronting the<br />
future.<br />
Confronting the future means finding solutions now.<br />
Solutions like this one which do what we in the<br />
Government have been trying to do since we began the<br />
national program called One Nation.<br />
Get the directions right. Address the imperatives.<br />
Consolidate our strengths. And as we develop ideas and<br />
get them working, keep building that regimen of care for<br />
each other and the nation, which is always the best<br />
measure of a successful society.<br />
I believe we have to make a truly national effort, and<br />
that is truly what we have been doing these past six<br />
months. The national meeting we will hold on 22 July will be a<br />
major step along that path.<br />
That meeting, I believe, will deliver new hope and<br />
opportunities to Australians, particularly young<br />
Australians. </p>
<p>We can do much to solve our problems if we have the will<br />
to do it.<br />
In Australia we have much in our favour. Among all our<br />
human and material resources there is one as valuable as<br />
any other that is our belief in fairness, in the " fair<br />
go", of individual opportunity tempered only by social<br />
justice this is an ethic as old as the nation itself.<br />
We should call on that belief now and in the future.<br />
It will serve us well.<br />
It has served Life Be In It well in this program.<br />
I want to congratulate everyone associated with<br />
" Activate" and thank them, and wish them success.<br />
Thank you. </p>
