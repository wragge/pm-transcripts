" J,,, USTRAUA<br />
PRIME MINISTER 26 January 1986<br />
The Federal Government has agreed on a number of new awards to<br />
enhance and develop the Australian honours system.<br />
The new awards will be established to enable recognition of<br />
outstanding service by particular groups in the community and<br />
members of the Defence Force in operational and non-operationalservice.<br />
They will be in addition to other awards already available within<br />
the Order of Australia, the Bravery Decorations system and the<br />
National Medal instituted in 1975 and the Defence Force Service<br />
Awards instituted in 1982.<br />
The establishment of the new awards will build on the existing<br />
elements of the Australian honours system to give Australia, for<br />
the first time, its own comprehensive indigenous system of<br />
honours and awards.<br />
This is in line with Government policy.<br />
The Government has made no recommendations for honours arid awards<br />
in the Imperial -system.<br />
The Queen has agreed in principle to the Government's<br />
recommendations for the new awards.<br />
There will be a new range of awards for Defence Force personnel<br />
which will be common to all ranks and services.<br />
In view of the historical importance of the Victoria Cross to<br />
Australians, the decoration will remain as the highest award for<br />
gallantry in action.<br />
The Victoria Cross will be established within the Australian<br />
honours system by the issue of Australian Letters Patent for the<br />
award by The Queen of Australia.<br />
Future recommendations for the decoration will be made by the<br />
Australian Government direct to The Queen for her approval as<br />
Queen of Australia.<br />
Other Defence awards will be available in war-time to recognise<br />
gallantry and outstanding service.<br />
Awards for non-operational service and another for nurses in the<br />
Defence Force will also be established.<br />
Several other awards will be introduced for particular service<br />
within the community and to the nation. </p>
<p>2.<br />
They will include medals for distinguished service by members of<br />
Australian Fire Services, for extraordinary service by Antarctic<br />
expeditioners and for outstanding public service.<br />
A new award for distinguished service by members of Australian<br />
Police Forces had already been announced last May.<br />
The formal criteria for the new awards will be announced when The<br />
Queen approves the relevant new Letters Patent and Regulations<br />
governing the various medals and decorations.<br />
The regulations for the National Medal will also be extended to<br />
allow members of the Australian Protective Service and<br />
Correctional and Emergency Services to qualify.<br />
Members of Police Forces, Fire and Ambulance Services are<br />
presently eligible for the National Medal after completing<br />
years diligent service.<br />
A number of amendments to the Constitution of the Order of<br />
Australia will also be made, including:<br />
removal of the provision to appoint Knights and Dames.<br />
( This will not affect existing appointees at this<br />
level);<br />
provision for the representation of the Northern<br />
Territory and the Australian Capital Territory on the<br />
Council for the order of Australia in addition to the<br />
existing State Government representation;<br />
raising non-Government representation on the Council<br />
from three to seven; and<br />
a substantial increase in the annual allocation of<br />
awards available from about 400 to 700.<br />
Australia will also move to have its own regulations governing<br />
the acceptance by Australians of foreign awards.<br />
Some other matters affecting the administration of the Australian<br />
Honours system will also be introduced.<br />
A schedule of the new awards is attached. </p>
