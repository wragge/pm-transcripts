A&amp; STRALIA<br />
PRIME MINISTER L;! RA$ RY~ i<br />
FOR MEDIA SATURDAY,<br />
OPENING OF THE FIRST STAGE OF THE AUSTRALIAN<br />
* MARITIME COLLEGE, BEAUTY POINT, LAUNCESTON<br />
Thank you for inviting me to open the " Practical Seamanship<br />
and Fisheries Training Centre", the first stage of the<br />
Australian Maritime College.<br />
The College, of which this Centre is a~ part, is a further<br />
step in a series of initiatives which may result in Tasmania<br />
becoming known as the maritime centre of Australia. After all,<br />
such a reputation is what one might expect of a State named<br />
after that famous seafaring explorer, Abel Tasman.<br />
In fact, Tasman's seafaring exploits are fine examples of<br />
practical seamanshir-, and no doubt will be a source of<br />
inspiration for the Centre's first contingent of 120 officer<br />
trainees. The Government is proud to be associated with this College,<br />
and is confident that the $ 25.6 million in Commonwealth capital<br />
funds to be spend on thE: College by 1984 will be amply repaid<br />
by the quality of College graduates.<br />
Until now, Australia has relied, to a large extent, on officers<br />
who have received their training, and often their qualifications,<br />
in overseas countries, particularly the United Kingdom.<br />
This College will redress that imbalance by providing a wide<br />
range of courses designed to ensure that the: training received<br />
by Australian seafarers is equal to any in the world.<br />
By 1984, the full-time student population will be about 600,<br />
and it is anticipated that by the same year, about 900<br />
experienced personnel will be undertaking short specialist<br />
courses. Thus, not only will the College meet the needs of<br />
budding deck officers, engineers, radio officers and the like,<br />
but also it will enable serving marine officers to keep<br />
informed of the latest developments in their field.<br />
The skills the students obtain here, at this nati4onal<br />
institution, will fit them for the positions they occupy, or<br />
intend to occupy, in the fishing and shipping industries,<br />
and in so doing, will strengthen these important Australian<br />
industries.<br />
This decade promises to be exciting and challenging, and<br />
those associated with our off-shore areas will benefit from<br />
a new pericd of research, development and investment opening 2 </p>
<p>-2<br />
up in our off-shore waters.<br />
We have recently declared a 200 nautical mile fishing zone<br />
around Australia, giving us control over, and access to, a<br />
marine resource area approximately equal to the land mass of<br />
the continent itself.<br />
Most of our oil and gas has been found off-shore: the Gippsland<br />
Basin in Bass Strait accounts for about 90% of our local<br />
production of oil and that is about 60% of our total consumption;<br />
the planned North-West Shelf project will produce four tioes<br />
the quantity of natural gas that the Bass Strait fields are<br />
presently producing.<br />
The Great Barrier Reef, one of the wonders of the world,<br />
is a priceless and irreplaceable part of our off-shore heritage<br />
which this Government will not allow to be damaged by any<br />
drilling or mining on or near it.<br />
It is of vital importance that the abundant marine resources<br />
which exist off-shore are managed, carefully; are harvested,<br />
not plundered; are conserved, not destroyed.<br />
Our off-shore area is the new frontier, a new world to be<br />
mastered. As with all things new and untried, it has demanded<br />
a fresh approach by governments, Commonwealth and State.<br />
Old, inappropriate policies have been discarded and replaced<br />
by policies and initiatives which reflect the importance of<br />
this zorne to Australia.<br />
These policies could not be adequately developed until the<br />
vexed question of Commonwealth/ State jursidiction over the<br />
off-shore areas had been resolved.<br />
For over a decade, Commonwealth and State governments had<br />
wrestled with what appeared to be irreconcilable State and<br />
Commonwealth interests in off-shore areas. The debate was<br />
sometimes heated, often acrimonious. But always, until the<br />
advent of this government, inconclusive.<br />
It represented a sorry and depressing~ catalogue of<br />
Commonwealth and State distrust and resentment.<br />
Finally in 1975, the High Court ruled that the Commonwealth<br />
has exclusive power over the surrounding seas up to the low<br />
water mark. Armed with this decision, the Commonwealth cou). d<br />
have asserted total control from the low water mark, seaward.<br />
Wle could have excluded the States completely from the control,<br />
management, and a share, of the off-shore resources.<br />
That would have been very unfortunate for Tasmania, and for<br />
all the States and the Northern Territory.<br />
We chose not to do so.<br />
Instead, we embarked on a process of shared power.<br />
Wle have just introduced into the Federal Parliament a historic<br />
package of bills which give practical expression to our policy </p>
<p>-3<br />
of co-operative Federalism; to our commnitment to co-operation,<br />
not confrontation.<br />
These bills provide the legal basis for States' rights and<br />
activities in the off-shore area.<br />
lie believe that the " Three Mile" territorial sea is an area<br />
best left for local State jurisidiction, except on matters<br />
of over-riding national or international importance.<br />
Also, we believe that a State's legislative powers should<br />
extend to fisheries in Au~ stralian waters beyond the<br />
" Three Mile" territorial sea, provided there is an arrangement<br />
between the Commonwealth and the State that the fisheries are<br />
to be managed in accordance with the laws of the State.<br />
Other bills in the package will, briefly speaking, vest in<br />
each State proprietary rights and title in respect of the<br />
seabed of the adjacent territorial sea; give to the States<br />
control of off-shore petroleum mining in the adjacent<br />
territorial sea; and no doubt, of vital interest to this<br />
College, establish arrangements which lay the basis for a<br />
complete resolution of shipping and navigation problems<br />
that have existed in Australia since federation.<br />
I am pleased to say that all State governments, of both<br />
political persuasion, including Tasmania, have joined in<br />
e. spirit of co-operation, to enable the States and the<br />
Commonwealth to share powers and resources in the seas<br />
surrounding Australia.<br />
The package of bills will enable the Commonwealth and the<br />
States to develop, in a co-operative way, the resources of<br />
the sea, and of the land beneath. This is of special importance<br />
to Tasmania, as an island State with a great fishing industry.<br />
These agreements, painstakingly reached after two years of<br />
detailed negotiations, have set the framework within which<br />
the Commonwealth and States can come together in co-operation<br />
to safeguard Australia's off-shore interests.<br />
The groundwork has been laid, but much more is needed.<br />
Increased research, bringing with it increased knowledge<br />
and understanding of this vast new world, is vital if we are<br />
to ensure optimum utilisation and proper conservation of<br />
the available resources.<br />
To this end, we have already established the Austral. ian<br />
Institute of Marine Science and located it in Townsville<br />
in close proximity to the Great Barrier Reef. It presently<br />
engages in valuable research work on the Reef, and recent<br />
decisions will boost its role even further.<br />
Scientists from overseas already have undertaken research<br />
at the Institute. We want it to become world-renowned, engaging<br />
in research of the highest calibre, and internationally admired<br />
for its scientific and professional expertise. / 14 </p>
<p>4<br />
In addition, we have created an expert scientific advisory<br />
body, " ASTEC" ( The Australian Science and Technology Council)<br />
which has a specialised sub-committee, " AMSTAC" ( The Australian<br />
Marine Sciences and Technologies Advisory Committee).<br />
Advice from these bodies assists us to make the best and<br />
wisest decisions in relation to marine science and research.<br />
As a result of ASTEC's report last year, additional research<br />
funds were made available and we are currently examining a<br />
second ASTEC report, to determine the future funding of<br />
marine science programmes.<br />
Also, as you are no doubt aware, we have decided to re-locate<br />
in Tasmania the CSIRO division of Fisheries and Oceanography.<br />
This $ 25 million decision will involve the transfer of the<br />
CSIRO division of Fisheries and Oceanography at present<br />
headquartered at Cronulla, N. S. W.<br />
It will include acquisition of a suitable site in Hobart<br />
and construction of the CSIRO Marine Science laboratories;<br />
and it will implement Construction of a $ 9 million multipurpose<br />
oceanographic research vessel which will be able to<br />
range around the Australian continent. This vessel will be<br />
in addition to three other research and training vessels the<br />
Commonwealth has commissioned to be built, purchased, or<br />
refitted at a total cost of over $ 6 million.<br />
The funds to commence this total package will be committed<br />
next year thereby establishing inTasmania, with CSIRO facilities<br />
a first-class marine science centre.<br />
The centre, together with the transfer of the Antarctic<br />
Division of the Department of Science and the Environment<br />
will constitute a research establishemnt of international<br />
standing. It is not by accident that we have chosen Tasmania as a<br />
home for many of these activities.<br />
As our closest point to the Antarctic, it was an obvious<br />
choice for the Antarctic Division of the Department of<br />
Science and the Environment.<br />
The Commonwealth has expended over $ 8 million on facilities<br />
for this division. It will have a core staff of 100, with up<br />
to 150 additional specialists recruited for varying periods.<br />
By bringing together these research and related activities,<br />
Tasmania will become the hub of Australia's Antarctic endeavours,<br />
and an important centre for marine science and research for<br />
all Australia.<br />
We also hope that Hobart will be selected as the headquarters<br />
of the commission proposed under the " Convention for the<br />
Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources" </p>
<p>Delegates from 15 countries are currently meeting in Canberra<br />
and are expected to reach a decision on this matter next<br />
week. No doubt, the examination of various Hobart sites they made<br />
with the Federal Minister for Productivity and Member for<br />
Bass, Mr. Kevin Newman, will assist them in their deliberations.<br />
Tasmania's significant fishing industry makes it a logical<br />
choice for the CSIRO's Marine Science Centre and the Australian<br />
Maritime College.<br />
Tasmania is going to play an increasingly important role in<br />
advancing Australia's knowledge of, and capacity to develop,<br />
the resources of the sea.<br />
Major facilities are being established here; facilities that<br />
will place Tasmania, and therefore, Australia, at the forefront<br />
of marine -science and technology.<br />
Already, a number of foreign fishing interests are making a<br />
close study of Tasmania's fishing resources.<br />
Some members of the Tasmanian fishing industry have voiced<br />
their concern about the foreign fishing operations in and<br />
around Tasmanian waters. Our position is clea~ r. To ensure<br />
effective exploitation and preservation of Australian marine<br />
resources, we have to determine the total allowable catches;<br />
the amount that can be taken by Australians; and the allocation<br />
that can be made to foreign countries, if any surplus is<br />
available. Guidelines administered by the Commonwealth Department of<br />
Primary Industry deny foreign fishing interests access to<br />
fisheries fully exploited by Australians or likely to be so<br />
in the near future.<br />
Our policy of giving preference to Australians will ensure<br />
that as they develop the capacity to harvest more resources,<br />
foreign operations will be reduced accordingly.<br />
A pleasing development, is the co-operation that has been<br />
displayed between Australian, Japanese and Polish interests<br />
in carrying out feasibility studies in and around Tasmanian<br />
waters. The Commonwealth Government has supported in the past,<br />
and will continue to support in the future, these types of<br />
studies, for we believe all Australians benefit from a healthy,<br />
viable, fishing industry.<br />
We are committed to thE! exploration of fish resources in the<br />
200 mile zone, and have made additional moneys available for<br />
research and development. For example, new fishing-grounds<br />
have been identified off north west Tasmania.<br />
Knowing that the fish are there, is one thing; finding them,<br />
as every fisherman knows, is another. / 6 </p>
<p>-6-<br />
Consequently, in 1980-81, the " Tasmanian Fisheries Development<br />
Authority" will receive a Commonwealth grant for a feasibility<br />
study of the application of " satellite remote sensing" tc<br />
fisheries investigations.<br />
I have no doubt this will be extremely helpful to commercial<br />
fishermen. However, when space-age technology catches up<br />
with amateur fishermen like me, I think it will take all the<br />
fun out of fishing.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen, Australiastands poised to embark on a<br />
programme of maritime activity and marine research which,<br />
for Australia as the world's only island continent, is<br />
long overdue.<br />
As I mentioned earlier, Tasmania has all the portents of becoming<br />
Australia's maritime centre. And I am sure the Australian<br />
Maritime College will go a long way towards enhancing such a<br />
reputation. So, to the staff who will serve here, and to the<br />
students who will study here, I wish " bon voyage"<br />
I have great pleasure in declaring open the first stage of the<br />
Australian Maritime College, the " Practical Seamanship and<br />
Fisheries Training Centre". </p>
