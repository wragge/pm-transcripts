    <content><![CDATA[<p>
The death of Muammar Qaddafi is an historic moment for the people of Libya.</p>
<p>It brings to a definitive end the repressive and bloody 42-year rule of a cruel dictator who, to the end, refused to acknowledge the legitimate aspirations of the Libyan people. </p>
<p>The defeat of the regime was achieved by ordinary Libyans who, during the many months of their struggle for freedom and democracy, have demonstrated their immense courage and determination. </p>
<p>We recognise the huge sacrifices they have made to achieve their longed-for objective.</p>
<p>The work ahead to unite Libya, to establish law and order, and to re-build its economy and its towns and cities will be challenging. </p>
<p>Now it a critical period for unity, respect for law and order, reconciliation and rebuilding.</p>
<p>We welcome the statements by National Transitional Council (NTC) Chairman Jalil emphasising that the new Libya will be inclusive, just and democratic. </p>
<p>The NTC has set out a clear timetable for the transition period, including the drafting of a new constitution and the holding of free elections, the first in over 42 years. </p>
<p>All of this work must be led by those who battled so hard for their country, by Libyans themselves, with the international community, led by the United Nations, providing the support that the new Libyan Government requires.</p>
<p>Australia is proud to have been a strong and active supporter of the Libyan people's struggle for freedom. </p>
<p>We were among the first countries to support a no-fly zone in Libya and are the third-largest donor of humanitarian assistance. </p>
<p>And we will continue to stand by Libya during this next chapter of its transition to a new future.  </p>
