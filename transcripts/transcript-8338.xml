SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
AUSTRALIAN FINANCE CONFERENCE<br />
SYDNEY 25 SEPTEMBER 1991<br />
Next month marks some notable anniversaries. One, very much<br />
in my mind, will be 7 October the fiftieth anniversary of<br />
the formation of the wartime Labor Government of Australia,<br />
under the leadership of the great John Curtin. Perhaps<br />
engraved more sharply on the memories of you here will be<br />
October the fourth anniversary of the stockmarket crash.<br />
And I put to you, ladies and gentlemen, what might seem at<br />
first an ast~ onishing proposition, but one which encapsulates<br />
the epic nat~ ure of the times through which we are living.<br />
My proposition is this: those four years, 1941 to 1945, were<br />
the most crucial in changing world history and shaping the<br />
future of humanity until the last four years, the four<br />
years since 1987.<br />
They have indeed been remarkable years. For a few months in<br />
1987 we feared that the world's economies and in<br />
particular its market economies would slide into a<br />
profound recession.<br />
We feared that we would see again the sort of ' crisis of<br />
capitalism' that brought the international economy to its<br />
knees in the early 1930s, and which had such a grave effect<br />
on Australia and on so many of her people amongst our<br />
parents' gerierat ion.<br />
And we were mindful too of the wider consequences of that<br />
earlier stockmarket crash; the flight to protectionism, the<br />
rise of fascism and the terrible trends that led to war.<br />
But of course, none of that happened.<br />
In fact over these past four years international events have<br />
been dominated by two much happier trends.<br />
First, markets have not been discredited, as they were by<br />
the crash of' 1929. </p>
<p>World markets and the world economy recovered surprisingly<br />
quickly from the crash. And the role of markets, including<br />
international markets, in satisfying the economic<br />
aspirations of ordinary men and women everywhere has been<br />
increasingly recognised in every corner of the globe.<br />
Economies which for decades have been ruled by diktat are<br />
now starting to be ruled by choice.<br />
Second, we have seen the political equivalent of these<br />
trends in economic thinking. Within nations, the last few<br />
years have seen an extraordinary surge towards democratic<br />
government. And between nations, there has been a<br />
remarkable reduction in tension and growth in cooperation.<br />
Strategically, these years mark the end of the cold war.<br />
The end of the era that began in 1941 with the German<br />
invasion of the Soviet Union and the Japanese attack on<br />
Pearl Harbour. Those attacks drew the two great powers into<br />
World War 2 and led them, through victory, to superpower<br />
status and relentless antagonism.<br />
Politically the last four years mark the end of an even<br />
longer era. For the death of communism in its first home,<br />
the Soviet Union, marks the eclipse of a conception of the<br />
State and its role in society, and indeed the end of an<br />
ideology about human society itself, which goes back even<br />
before 1917.<br />
These great events unquestionably among the decisive<br />
sequences of modern history will be symbolised in history<br />
by the fall of the Berlin Wall and Russia's three-day<br />
revolution. But their effects have been felt, and will<br />
continue to be felt, all over the world.<br />
So my theme today is change, in these times of immense<br />
change, and the challenge it brings inescapably in its wake.<br />
And, in attempting to understand this experience of the<br />
recent past and, just as important, in planning for the<br />
future, October 1987 is an appropriate place to begin.<br />
The falls in share prices in those tumultuous days, almost<br />
four years ago, surpassed anything seen since the Great<br />
Crash of 1929. It was a natural response, then, for the<br />
world's policy makers to look back to that earlier time. It<br />
was natural, also, that their predominant concern should be<br />
to avoid the collapse of the banking system and prolonged<br />
depression of the 1930s.<br />
But that experience lay almost 60 years in the past. The<br />
world economy had changed enormously. The world financial<br />
system proved much more resilient than in 1929. The<br />
flexibility brought by deregulation, coupled with greater<br />
international integration of world capital markets, gave it<br />
a much greater capacity to absorb shocks. </p>
<p>We can now see, with hindsight, that the easy monetary<br />
policies, pursued in much of the developed world, designed<br />
to avoid a repeat of 1929, were an over-reaction. Their<br />
effect was to stimulate demand beyond the capacity of the<br />
world economy to produce. Amongst other things, it gave<br />
rise to a boom in asset prices.<br />
We, in Australia, shared in this experience. Here, growth<br />
in demand outstripped growth in output by a factor of two.<br />
It was a situation we could not and did not allow to<br />
persist. The international events I have described overlaid a range<br />
of fundamental changes we ourselves were making, to achieve<br />
greater competitiveness. C ' onsequently, the impact of those<br />
events was greater here than in most other national<br />
economies. The structural changes were imperative to the pursuit of<br />
competitiveness. Yet they made Australia particularly<br />
susceptible! to these wider, international influences.<br />
Nowhere ca. this be seen more clearly and starkly than in<br />
the financial sector.<br />
In many respects, the financial sector has been a pioneer of<br />
structural change in Australia. The floating of the dollar<br />
and the dismantling of foreign exchange controls opened the<br />
sector to the influence of international capital markets.<br />
Deregulation and the entry of the foreign banks brought a<br />
sharp increase in competitive pressure.<br />
This new environment made immense demands on management<br />
within financial institutions.<br />
But in the period following October 1987, these demands were<br />
not immediately obvious. Money and credit were easy.<br />
Aggressive lending was seen as essential to survival.<br />
With the tightening of credit and the associated deflation<br />
of asset prices, the pressures on management were<br />
simultaneously revealed and redoubled. Regrettably, this<br />
proved too : much for some institutions and has left its marks<br />
on the balance sheets of all of them.<br />
Unlike the crash of 1987, these developments are genuinely<br />
testing the resilience of the financial system. And not<br />
just in Australia. There are serious concerns about the<br />
fragility of the financial systems of both the US and Japan.<br />
If this account were all there was to be said about the last<br />
four years -then the only remedy would be one drawn from the<br />
post-1929 experience. Perhaps some would be looking for the<br />
nearest window.<br />
But, in spite of the pronouncements of the dismal johnnies<br />
who seek oul: the doom and gloom in every situation, this is<br />
manifestly not the case. The reform effort that predates </p>
<p>1987, and has continued and intensified since, has brought<br />
about real and lasting change.<br />
In the financial sector, there have been real benefits to<br />
consumers. A much richer menu of financial products and<br />
services has become available, and competition for savings<br />
has enhanced the returns on the accounts available, and<br />
increased their range.<br />
And this is a motif repeated across many sectors of our<br />
economy: real and lasting benefit on the one hand, coupled<br />
with particular difficulties flowing from the extremely<br />
disruptive, but essentially transitory, experience of the<br />
last couple of years.<br />
I think it is of profound importance that we draw the<br />
appropriate conclusions from this observation. We must not<br />
allow ourselves to be overwhelmed by the difficulties of the<br />
moment as disturbing as they might be. We should take heart<br />
from the massive change we have already secured, draw<br />
strength from the achievements we have already posted and<br />
move to tackle the problems that now confront us with the<br />
same determination that has brought us this far.<br />
Make no mistake, this is not an idle and empty clarion call<br />
to attempt some impossible feat, nor will you respond<br />
adequately by feeling committed for the next twenty four<br />
hours. What has brought us the achievements we have secured<br />
and what promises further gains is continued application of<br />
effort by each of us in our own area to perform our<br />
functions better.<br />
My Government, in this year of recession, has sought to<br />
redouble its own efforts. I made the claim, at the<br />
post-Budget AFR dinner, that in no year in the post-war era<br />
had so much reform been achieved.<br />
The challenge I issued then to refute that claim remains<br />
unanswered. Let me take you through some of the main elements that<br />
substantiate this claim, not to convince you of our virtue,<br />
but to demonstrate that, in urging you to help work ourway<br />
through the current problems, this Government is leading by<br />
example. The reforms we are implementing have an overriding<br />
objective: to make our economy more competitive<br />
internationally. Nowhere are these reforms more striking than in the area of<br />
Commonwealth-State relations. Through the Special Premiers<br />
Conference process, we are redefining the relationship<br />
between Federal, State and Local Governments in a way<br />
unmatched in over ninety years of Federation and to a degree<br />
considered impossible by many, even as recently as last<br />
year. </p>
<p>The impact of these reforms has yet to be felt in the<br />
Community at: large. But, as they come on stream in the<br />
years ahead, Australia will be free, at last, to operate and<br />
compete as a, single, efficient unit, free of inefficiencies<br />
flowing from the accumulated mass of uncoordinated and<br />
contradictory rules and regulations.<br />
The establishment of the National Rail Corporation, at a<br />
cost of over $ 260 million over the next four years, will<br />
mean that business will no longer have to deal with five<br />
separate rail systems, uniform only in their capacity to<br />
make losses. Instead, there will be a single, commercially<br />
oriented company responsible for interstate rail freight<br />
with a network extending from Brisbane to Perth.<br />
The National Road Transport Commission will regulate heavy<br />
vehicles on a nationally uniform basis.<br />
The National Grid Management Council will deliver a more<br />
rational use of energy resources. It will, over time,<br />
provide electricity cheaper than it would otherwise have<br />
been available to household consumers and industry alike.<br />
From the beginning of 1993, regulations and standards<br />
covering goods and occupations in each of the States and<br />
Territories will be recognised in each of the others a<br />
simple reform in itself, but one with far-reaching<br />
implications. Yet this simple reform was put in the too<br />
hard tray by a succession of Governments during the first<br />
ninety years of Federation.<br />
Further, through the process of the Special Premiers<br />
Conference, proposals are being developed for adequate and<br />
uniform prudeantial standards for State-based non-bank<br />
financial institutions. While I know these reforms will not<br />
affect directly the institutions represented here today, it<br />
will provide a more efficient and predictable operating<br />
environment fEor those in the building society and credit<br />
union sector.<br />
But, of course, the achievement of micro-economic reform<br />
extends well beyond Commonwealth-State relations. I list:<br />
the tariLff cuts and further taxation reforms announced<br />
in the March Economic Statement<br />
the Waterfront reforms which are already giving rise to<br />
productivity gains of 60-70 per cent in some ports and,<br />
in so doing, providing direct benefits to all<br />
Australian exporters<br />
deregulation of the civil aviation industry, which is<br />
providin~ g cheaper fares for all air travellers<br />
reform of the telecommunications sector and in the<br />
management and operation of government-owned<br />
enterprises, at both the Commonwealth and State levels. </p>
<p>The Government's micro-economic reform initiatives are being<br />
pursued within a coherent and forward-looking overall policy<br />
framework designed to get the fundamentals right.<br />
The 1991-92 budget brought down by John Kerin was integral<br />
to this strategy.<br />
If Australia is to develop an internationally competitive<br />
economy, the skills level of its workforce must be upgraded.<br />
That is why the Budget saw expenditure on labour market and<br />
training programs increase by 50 per cent in real terms.<br />
Also, it is why $ 420 million was allocated to TAFE.<br />
Similarly, if we are to plan properly for the future, we<br />
cannot ignore the problems associated with the ageing of our<br />
population. We cannot wish away such problems or pretend<br />
they do not exist. If we are to have sensible policies for<br />
the future, we have to make basic decisions now. That is<br />
the approach behind the superannuation initiative announced<br />
in the Budget. It might have been expedient to put of f the<br />
decision, but that would have simply imposed a greater cost<br />
on business, and the commnunity as a whole, further down the<br />
track. I come now to the prospects ahead.<br />
Over the course of this financial year, our inflation rate<br />
is forecast to drop to 3 per cent. At 3.4 per cent,<br />
Australia's inflation rate is already below the 4.3 per cent<br />
average of our major trading partners in the OECD.<br />
Inflation expectations are being lowered and, for the first<br />
time in a generation, Australia has the opportunity to make<br />
permanent its status as a low-inflation country. My<br />
Government intends to grasp that opportunity. We intend to<br />
lock in permanently the advantages which low inflation<br />
brings to our international competitiveness.<br />
Central to the maintenance of low inflation is an effective<br />
wages policy. It is to its great credit that the Australian<br />
union movement shares the commitment to keeping inflation<br />
low. Through the Accord process one of the great success<br />
stories in economic management over the past decade the<br />
union movement has committed itself to the achievement of a<br />
wages outcome in the order of 5 per cent this year. Beyond<br />
that, the union movement has agreed to work with the<br />
Government towards a wages outcome consistent with keeping<br />
Australia's inflation rate at levels comparable with those<br />
of our major trading partners.<br />
Australia's current account deficit is forecast to be around<br />
$ 14 billion or 3.5 per cent of GDP in 1991-92, a very<br />
significant improvement on the $ 22.3 billion or 6 per cent<br />
of GDP in 1989-90.<br />
And especially pleasing about this trend is the fact that so<br />
much of it is due to a growth in net exports. That is a<br />
clear sign that the changes we have been working for, are </p>
<p>beginning to take hold. In particular, manufacturing<br />
exports have shown a consistently high growth over the past<br />
eight years 26 per cent in 1990-91 alone. In fact, in<br />
1990-91 the share of manufacturing exports in total exports<br />
was 18 per cent, compared with 12 per cent in 1982-83.<br />
Largely as a result of the growth in exports, the balance on<br />
goods and ser-vices is forecast to be in surplus in 1991-92,<br />
the first such surplus in over a decade.<br />
The Budget forecasts are for recovery at a moderate pace<br />
over the course of this financial year, with GDP growing at<br />
three and three quarter percent through the year.<br />
While I do ncot underestimate the difficulties still being<br />
faced by businesses all the signs point to the beginnings of<br />
a steady improvement in economic activity<br />
despite a slight fall-back in the past two months, the<br />
index of consumer confidence has risen by 30 per cent<br />
since February<br />
housing starts and retail trade statistics have picked<br />
up new manufacturing orders are expected to increase over<br />
the coming quarter.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen,<br />
The thrust of this Government's policy effort has been to<br />
take the right decisions for the future of Australia. We<br />
are about getting the framework and structures right. Such<br />
an approach is, we believe, the one which will be of most<br />
benefit to Australian industry and to the Australian people.<br />
And, on industry policy, let me restate very clearly that<br />
the Government's objective is to build a more competitive<br />
Australia. As I stated in Melbourne last week to the<br />
Australian Chamber of Manufactures, there is an obvious<br />
distinction between policies that stimulate and facilitate<br />
the growth of self-sustaining new industries, that<br />
rejuvenate old ones, and policies that bring into existence<br />
industries whose viability is dependent on special treatment<br />
by Government.<br />
While in Government we have put in place various policies of<br />
the former kind, policies of the latter kind have not only<br />
failed to bring about worthwhile change but have actually<br />
held back the development of competitive industries.<br />
Obviously, thiLs government wants to see development wherever<br />
possible. And we also have a responsibility to ourselves<br />
and to future generations to ensure that development does<br />
not do irretriLevable damage to the environment. That is the<br />
very reason we established the Ecologically Sustainable<br />
Development process; to bring business, environment groups,<br />
Commonwealth and State Governments together to develop a </p>
<p>rational way of resolving sensibly the frequently recurring<br />
conflict between development and the environment.<br />
As with so many other things, it would be easy to pretend<br />
this problem does not exist, but that would be irresponsible<br />
and represent a massive betrayal of the trust placed in<br />
those elected to government. But I do also contend that<br />
there are ways of reconciling in most instances the need for<br />
economic growth with the responsibility for protecting the<br />
environment. Ladies and gentlemen,<br />
Let me turn briefly to your own situation. There has been a<br />
tendency through the period ' of turmoil I have described for<br />
the banks to increase their share of activity in the<br />
financial sector. Nevertheless, with assets in excess of<br />
billion and employing around 20,000 people, finance<br />
companies in Australia continue to be a major presence in<br />
the sector, particularly in the provision of financial<br />
services to small and medium sized businesses.<br />
Many in your sector have been criticised for your behaviour<br />
through the recent period. Beyond pursuing the normal<br />
processes of the law in punishing demonstrable cases of<br />
wrong-doing, I think little purpose is served in raking over<br />
the ashes of past mistakes better to look forward and ask<br />
what positive contribution can be made to the future.<br />
In looking to that future there are two particular goals<br />
towards which I would ask you to aim.<br />
First, to secure and maintain the strength and stability of<br />
your own institutions. A financial sector that is itself<br />
unstable cannot contribute to restructuring elsewhere in the<br />
economy. It is, on the face of it, presumptuous for me to be drawing<br />
your attention to what, according to all conventional<br />
wisdom, must be the prime aim of a financial institution.<br />
But I believe I am justified in doing so, not only by the<br />
manifest damage to your balance sheets many of you have<br />
sustained; but because I make the deeper observation that<br />
the damage has been caused, not by some extraneous<br />
combination of circumstances, but by a failure of management<br />
within institutions to keep this goal uppermost in their<br />
minds. The sober virtues of a balanced portfolio, avoiding<br />
excessive exposure to one sector or one borrower, of careful<br />
analysis and management of risk and of matching assets and<br />
liabilities were forgotten in the heady days of the late<br />
1980s. They must be reinstated.<br />
Second, I would ask that your pay closer attention to your<br />
customers. They must be seen as more than an immediate<br />
source of revenue; more than another point in a battle for<br />
market share. </p>
<p>Their future prosperity is your future prosperity, and you<br />
must ask yourselves what more you can do to help secure it.<br />
I believe we must see much closer relationships between<br />
lenders and their customers. And I believe the<br />
responsibility for developing this closeness lies<br />
principally with lenders for they will cultivate many such<br />
relationships whereas borrowers may maintain only one.<br />
This closeness will give greater insight into customer needs<br />
and enable you to develop and offer products targeted to<br />
those needs. It will also allow you, the lender, greater<br />
insight into the capacity of your borrower to carry debt and<br />
allow you to manage risk prudently without unnecessarily<br />
penalising your customers.<br />
It was with the interests of consumers in mind that the<br />
Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs, Senator Tate,<br />
announced recently that from yesterday, 24 September, people<br />
would be guaranteed access, free of charge, to any credit<br />
information held on them by a credit reporting agency.<br />
Also, the credit reporting industry will be under an<br />
obligation to ensure that the records it holds are accurate<br />
and up to date.<br />
Likewise, the Government is now moving to address the issue<br />
of consumer credit insurance, with the objective of<br />
providing greater protection to the consumer and, in so<br />
doing, to improve the standing of the industry as a whole.<br />
In a period of restructuring aimed at building a more<br />
competitive Australia, the financial sector has a key role<br />
to play. I urge you not to be discouraged by the difficult<br />
times through which you have passed, but to learn the<br />
lessons it offers and move to play your essential part in<br />
our great national enterprise. </p>
