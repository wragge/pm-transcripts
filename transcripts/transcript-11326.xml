<p>Well, thank you very much, Graeme; to, first of all, collectively,</p>
<p> to all the members of the Howell family. This is a great occasion</p>
<p> for all of you. To the Deputy Premier of Queensland; to the former</p>
<p> Premier of Queensland, Mike Ahern; to my Federal Parliamentary colleague,</p>
<p> Gary Hardgrave, and to David Watson, the leader of the State Parliamentary</p>
<p> Liberal Party, the employees of the company, ladies and gentlemen.</p>
<p>I always get quite a thrill out of being involved in the opening of</p>
<p> something that represents a march forward, an extension of a previously</p>
<p> successful business into an even more successful expansion in prospect.</p>
<p> And today is a very important, indeed, a very exciting day, not only</p>
<p> for the family which is represented by not only the founders of this</p>
<p> company but also by them and their almost 600 employees, but in many</p>
<p> ways what we are recognising today is the sort of thing that any government</p>
<p> of any political persuasion, be it State or Federal, would always</p>
<p> want to see created. And that is a company starting in Australia only</p>
<p> a generation ago, still retaining its essential character as a family</p>
<p> business but growing over that period of time, getting a very strong</p>
<p> slice of the domestic market and also laying claim to a very important</p>
<p> slice of a world market.</p>
<p>And this company, EGR, is really a perfect metaphor for what we want</p>
<p> to see more of around Australia. We want to see companies that start</p>
<p> with a family base and retain that essential family character. We</p>
<p> want to see companies that invest in high tech. We want to see companies</p>
<p> that skilfully use research and development. We want to see companies</p>
<p> that build export markets. We want to see companies that treat their</p>
<p> workforce well and recognise that unless you reach out to your workforce</p>
<p> and involve them in the decisions you take and share your future with</p>
<p> them, quite understandably you don't get the best out of them.</p>
<p> And this is a company that has done all of those things. And this</p>
<p> is a company, of course, if I may say so modestly and just in passing,</p>
<p> which has benefited from some of the underlying strengths of the Australian</p>
<p> economy. I mean, it's very good that your interest rates are</p>
<p> lower now than they used to be and it's very good that the interest</p>
<p> rates that your employees pay on their houses are now about $320 a</p>
<p> month lower than they used to be. We are living in very strong, buoyant,</p>
<p> economic times.</p>
<p>About 10 days ago I attended a two day conference in Melbourne run</p>
<p> by The Australian newspaper and it had the marvellous title</p>
<p> of Â‘Australia Unlimited' and it spoke of the sense of hope</p>
<p> and optimism that we all feel about our nation as we move into the</p>
<p> next millennium. And one of the keynote speeches was delivered by</p>
<p> the former chief economic advisers to one of my predecessors, Bob</p>
<p> Hawke, and the speech was delivered by Professor Ross Garnaut. And</p>
<p> he said that he believed that we might possibly be in the third great</p>
<p> era of strong economic growth and expansion that Australia's</p>
<p> experienced since it was founded. The first era ran from 1901 until</p>
<p> the commencement of World War I. The second era began in the early</p>
<p> 1950s as a result of post-war reconstruction and the enormous benefits</p>
<p> of post-war migration and then ran through until the early 1970s.</p>
<p>Now, whether we are in the third great economic era or not it is undeniable</p>
<p> that Australia has great opportunities, has been able to stare down</p>
<p> the worst of the Asian economic downturn and has an underlying economic</p>
<p> strength. But what we need to capitalise on that is the contribution</p>
<p> of people, the contribution of people who run and invest in businesses,</p>
<p> the contribution of people who work with the owners of those businesses</p>
<p> in a true partnership to build a very successful enterprise. And your</p>
<p> company has done exactly that. It is a model. It's been successful</p>
<p> in expansion. It's grown strongly. It's looked after its</p>
<p> workforce. It's got a good product and it's won and it's</p>
<p> retained markets. And it's used the various incentives that have</p>
<p> been available and have been provided by successive governments.</p>
<p>And I do endorse what Mr Elder said, there are great areas of cooperation</p>
<p> between State and Federal governments. You hear about the differences,</p>
<p> you don't hear about the cooperation. And that not only applies</p>
<p> in economic issues but it also applies in one of the most pressing</p>
<p> and challenging social issues of our time and that is dealing with</p>
<p> the scourge of illicit drugs within our community. And I've said</p>
<p> as recently as an hour or so ago on 4BC that as far as I am concerned,</p>
<p> as Prime Minister, I will work with any Premier of any political persuasion</p>
<p> across all party divides and all party lines to find a better solution</p>
<p> and a better outcome in relation to that particular problem. And I</p>
<p> know that is the view of my State Premier colleagues, whether they</p>
<p> come from the Labor Party or from my side of politics.</p>
<p>But today is very much an occasion to celebrate the success of a family</p>
<p> business. I have a special place in my heart for family businesses.</p>
<p> I grew up in a very small business background. My father started a</p>
<p> small garage with absolutely nothing in the 1920s and built it into</p>
<p> a business that was able to support his own family and provide for</p>
<p> them extremely well. And I've never forgotten how important it</p>
<p> was in our lives the ethic of starting with nothing and working hard</p>
<p> to build something up in your lifetime and leaving some of it behind</p>
<p> to your children. It's very much the story of Australia through</p>
<p> the generations. This particular family has done it rather better</p>
<p> than most. You've built a wonderful enterprise and you've</p>
<p> done it extremely well. And it's wonderful to see the different</p>
<p> generations of the family here today.</p>
<p>So to all of you can I say congratulations. Can I thank all of the</p>
<p> management and the employees of the company for the contribution that</p>
<p> they are making. You are regarded quite rightly as not only a national</p>
<p> leaders but in many cases, in many respects, a world class leader</p>
<p> in this particular area of plastics. And the importance of this company</p>
<p> to the Australian domestic industry and the importance of the company</p>
<p> to our export markets in this area cannot be overestimated. Thank</p>
<p> you very much for inviting me to be here today. I am honoured to have</p>
<p> been asked to open the extensions to this extrusion plant. I thank</p>
<p> you all and I wish the company great good fortune and continued expansion</p>
<p> and success into the future. Thank you.</p>
