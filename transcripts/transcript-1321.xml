FOR PRESS: P. M. No. 46/ 1966<br />
MR. CAL1, TELL'S TEIEVISIOU" DEBATE<br />
Comment by the Prime M4inister, Harold Holt<br />
This is the latest bright idea in Mr. Caiwell's<br />
series of qdite frantic attempts to stem Labor's ebbing tide.<br />
Not surpriSingly, he seems rattled to find that, at this stage<br />
of his leadership, support f or the ALP, as revealed in the two<br />
latest public opinion polis, has fallen to what must ' be about the<br />
lowest point in his Party's history.<br />
There is no novelty in a Leader of the Opposition<br />
trying to provide himself with an enlarged audience by luring<br />
a Prime Minister into public debate from the same platform.<br />
He receives from me the same answer that Prime Ministers from<br />
his own Party have given when similarly challenged.<br />
The need is not so much for debate as clarification<br />
of the alternative policies Labor would offer.<br />
The Government's policies on Viet Nam and national<br />
service were fully debated in the recently concluded session of<br />
Parliament. There were almost daily exchanges on the issues<br />
between the Leader of the Opposition and myself. W~ e have both<br />
expressed ourselves at length, since then, at public meetings,<br />
including some held in the current Queensland election campaign.<br />
There is no ambiguity about the ' Government's<br />
policies which have been supported by all members of the<br />
Government Parties in both Houses of the Parliament. The<br />
obscurities are to be found in the conflicting versions of<br />
policy from Mr. Calwell himself and his understandably bewildered<br />
oaucus,<br />
