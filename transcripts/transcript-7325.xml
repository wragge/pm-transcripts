CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
DEDICATION CEREMONY OF THE AUSTRALIAN HELLENIC MEMORIAL<br />
CANBERRA 21 MAY 1988<br />
Mr Deputy Prime Minister<br />
Sir William Refshauge<br />
Sir William Keys<br />
Archbishop Stylianos<br />
Ladies and Gentlemen<br />
Today we are dedicating the Australian-Hellenic memorial<br />
which symbolises the bonds of friendship which, in time of<br />
peace and of war, have united Australia and Greece.<br />
our friendship has strong roots stretching over a century<br />
and a half of Greek settlement in Australia.<br />
It was strengthened immeasurably by the ties formed between<br />
Australian and Greek servicemen and women and civilians in<br />
the First and Second world Wars.<br />
Most importantly, it is a friendship nourished by the most<br />
powerful of forces our shared commitment to freedom,<br />
democracy and peace. That commitment is constantly renewed<br />
by the thousands of Australians who visit Greece each year<br />
and by the presence in Australia of a strong, resilient, and<br />
vigorous community of Greek-Australians, who have made and<br />
are making such a tremendous contribution to our country.<br />
on 25 April 1986, as part of my visit to Greece, I had the<br />
moving and memorable experience of speaking at the Anzac Day<br />
ceremony in Athens. As you would yourself recall, Mr Deputy<br />
Prime Minister, it was an occasion full of the memory of the<br />
Battle of Crete, where Australians and Greeks stood side by<br />
side with our allies defending Greece against the invasion.<br />
It was a most appropriate time to announce that<br />
Greek-Australians and Australian ex-service personnel were<br />
joining to build this Memorial. I said then that the<br />
Government had made available this site for the construction<br />
of the memorial, in the vicinicty of the Australian War<br />
memorial. () 0G6585 </p>
<p>I was delighted at the encouragement Prime Minister<br />
Papendreou gave to the project. The Greek Government's<br />
contribution of olive trees from Griffith, but of Greek<br />
stock is a singularly fitting gesture. And your presence<br />
here today, Mr Deputy Prime Minister, is a very welcome<br />
further proof of your Government's willingness to assist<br />
this project.<br />
I know, Sir, from our meeting yesterday, that you have warm<br />
personal memories of Australian troops, flowing from your<br />
own distinguished service during the Second world war. I am<br />
gratified by your assurances that even today Greek people<br />
remember the courage and friendship shown by Australian<br />
troops during the war.<br />
This is our Bicentennial year, in which Australians are<br />
reflecting on their achievements over the two hundred years<br />
since Europeans first settled our continent.<br />
our celebrations most recently the opening of tfhe new<br />
Parliament House directly over the lake from us 7. have had,<br />
I believe, a significant impact on our national character.<br />
I think we have become more aware, and more proud, of our<br />
achievements in building in that relatively short span of<br />
time, a nation that is both free and prosperous. At the<br />
same time I believe we have become more humble in<br />
recognising the crucial contribution, made lby those who have<br />
gone before us, to the effort of building this free and<br />
prosperous nation.<br />
This Australian-Hellenic Memorial will play a valuable role<br />
in reminding us of that contribution.<br />
And I hope it will serve as something of an inspiration to<br />
those who will inspect it. Because it is not just a war<br />
memorial but a symbol of the shared sacrifices and the<br />
enduring friendship between the Greek and Australian people. 8 </p>
