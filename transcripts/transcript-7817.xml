CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
SIXTEENTH NATIONAL CONFERENCE<br />
OF THE AUSTRALIA INSTITUTE OF<br />
INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS:<br />
" ANTARCTICA'S FUTURE: CONTINUITY OR CHANGE"<br />
HOBART 18 NOVEMBER 1989<br />
I-welcome the opportunity offered by the Australian<br />
Institute of International Affairs to address this important<br />
conference and to put to you first hand my Government's<br />
position on the controversial and fast moving debate about<br />
the future of Antarctica.<br />
The Australian Institute of International Affairs has a long<br />
. and proud record of informing public debate on issues of<br />
foreign policy importance to Australia.<br />
Your topic for this, your sixteenth conference, is one that<br />
has particularly captured public interest arnd imagination<br />
over the past year.<br />
It is of course very appropriate that we should be<br />
discussing Antarctica's future-here in Hobart, a city with<br />
an impo~ rtant role in sustaining Antarctic research activity<br />
today, and a city with strong historical links to scientific<br />
exploration in Antarctica stretching back to the departure<br />
of Dumont D'Urville's first expedition from here almost 150<br />
years ago in January 1840.<br />
That Antarctica has become the focus of such current<br />
international interest should be no surprise.<br />
There is something about Antarctica that lifts the spirit<br />
and stimulates the mind.<br />
Antarctica is the only one of the seven continents that<br />
cannot sustain human life; the only one where a nearpristine<br />
environment remains.<br />
It is the last great wilderness. </p>
<p>Earlier this century, the continent challenged intrepid men<br />
like Amundsen, Scott, Shackelton and our own Sir Douglas<br />
Mawson to discover its secrets.<br />
And their accounts of this remarkable place, in turn, fired<br />
public interest and imagination.<br />
Inspired by the glacial splendour that surrounded the<br />
Antarctic land mass, Mawson's response was to write that " tin<br />
the soft glamour of the midsummer midnight sun, we were<br />
possessed by a rapturous wonder the rare thrill of<br />
unreality". This unspoilt image of Antarctica is surely a vivid one.<br />
But evocative images of rapturous wonder are not sufficient<br />
to sustain public policy, particularly in the area of<br />
international relations.<br />
Because on any issue that involves the competing views of<br />
different countries, the international community properly<br />
brings to bear rigorous scrutiny.<br />
The decisions the Antarctic Treaty parties make about<br />
Antarctica in the next few years will have very real<br />
consequences for the future management of the continent, arnd<br />
arguably, for the future health of our planet.<br />
The Antarctic Treaty system, like the land mass it relates<br />
to, is unique.<br />
And it has much to commend it.<br />
Since it was put in place thirty years ago, all the nations<br />
claiming sovereignty in the Antarctic have agreed not to<br />
enforce their claims against each other.<br />
And, over a period characterised by international distrust<br />
and conflict, the Treaty has prevented the continent from<br />
becoming an object of discord by maintaining it as a<br />
demilitarised area.<br />
Instead, scientific co-operation has flourished: for the<br />
Treaty not only encourages research, but obliges an exchange<br />
of scientific information.<br />
Under the Treaty, human activity is carefully managed and<br />
high standards of environmental behaviour have been<br />
established.<br />
Why then, given these successes, has this Treaty been plgced<br />
under scrutiny? </p>
<p>Why has it been so heavily, and often wrongly, criticised in<br />
forums as the United Nations?<br />
Some of the criticism is misguided.<br />
Those who argue, for example, that the Treaty is an<br />
association of privileged nations locking up a wealth of<br />
undefined resources for their own exclusive use and benefit,<br />
ignore the fact that the thirty nine current members include<br />
countries that span almost every cleavage that might<br />
characterise difference in the world: North-South;<br />
East-West; superpowers, middle powers and small powers.<br />
Any state can accede to the Treaty and, provided that it<br />
maintains a substantial research program in Antarctica, can<br />
become a Consultative Party.<br />
I believe the Antarctic Treaty System can and should survive<br />
-into the 21st Century but to do so it must demonstrate it<br />
can deal responsibly and openly with the protection of the<br />
Antarctic environment.<br />
Antarctica provides the habitat for and sustains many living<br />
species, on its shores and in the teeming oceans that<br />
surround it.<br />
Even more importantly, it plays a crucial role in global<br />
climate matters, influencing our weather, the ocean currents<br />
and sea level.<br />
It is also our most Valuable laboratory for measuring the<br />
greenhouse effect and changes in the thickness of the ozone<br />
layer. For all the strength of natural forces at play there, the<br />
Antarctic environment is paradoxically fragile.<br />
Upsetting this delicate balance could threaten changes that<br />
would alter the world in quite dramatic ways.<br />
We must therefore preserve the Antarctic environment. The<br />
question is how best to do it.<br />
The most urgent and relevant action we can take is to ensure<br />
that this irreplaceable environment is never put at risk by<br />
mining. That is why Australia has decided not to sign the Minerals<br />
Convention. This position is based on two simple propositions. </p>
<p>First, the Antarctic environment is extremely fragile and<br />
critically important to the whole global ecosystem.<br />
Second, mining in Antarctica will always be dangerous, and<br />
could be catastrophically so.<br />
In the light of those propositions, we are convinced that<br />
the Minerals convention is basically flawed.<br />
It is based on the clearly incorrect assumption current in<br />
the 1970s. that mining in the Antarctic could be consistent<br />
with the preservation of the continent's fragile<br />
environment. But any mining operation, with its accompanying<br />
infrastructure and bulk transport needs, would have a<br />
lasting and major impact on the area in which it takes<br />
place. I do not believe that the risk of accidents can ever be<br />
totally eliminated either by paper regimes or by advances<br />
in technology.<br />
The recent oil spills at the United States' Scott-Amundsen<br />
and McMurdo Stations, although minor, demonstrate that it is<br />
hard enough to prevent mishaps with existing, much lower<br />
level, non-resource-based activity.<br />
The Minerals Convention might provide for some a dangerous<br />
illusion of environment protection.<br />
But by permitting immediate prospecting and Betting out a<br />
path by which mining might proceed it will in fact be<br />
working in precisely the opposite direction.<br />
So with France, Australia is pursuing the initiative of a<br />
comprehensive environmental protection convention which will<br />
establish Antarctica as a " Natural Reserve Land of<br />
Science." I am aware that our decision has caused considerable anxiety<br />
amongst those Antarctic Treaty members who believed that the<br />
coming into force of the Minerals Convention was not just a<br />
correct outcome but a foregone conclusion.<br />
And I'm also aware of assertions that our opposition to the<br />
convention is purely tactical, or has been adopted for<br />
short-term electoral reasons and will be reversed as soon as<br />
convenient. Let me urge anyone who might still harbour that fantasy to<br />
abandon it. </p>
<p>Because the reverse is true.<br />
I am convinced that more and more countries will come to<br />
share the position that President Mitterrand, Prime Minister<br />
Rocard and I have outlined. Already we are receiving strong<br />
support from countries such as Belgium, Italy, the Federal<br />
Republic of Germany, and India.<br />
In the end, that position will prevail because it is<br />
correct, and because it is being endorsed by international<br />
public opinion which, in the coming months and years, will<br />
only gather further momentum and strength.<br />
The current discussions taking place about the Minerals<br />
Convention, and the guidelines, codes of conduct and other<br />
measures that Treaty parties have already put into place<br />
including the Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic<br />
Marine Living-Resources attest to the environmental<br />
sensitivity that has characterised the management of<br />
Antarctica under the Treaty system.<br />
Australia and France are not. challenging the Treaty system,<br />
or the operation of the consensus principle that has<br />
underpinned its operation.<br />
But we Ar&amp; challenging Treaty members to accept that'times<br />
have changed since the 1970s, that our levels of knowledge<br />
have changed, and that we need to continue to Justify the<br />
Antarctic Treaty Parties' management regime in Antarctica.<br />
In taking the initiative on this issue, we are seeking to<br />
achieve a goal that ' we believe would yield important<br />
benefits muua benefits for all the people of the world.<br />
Australia, as a middle power, puts great store in<br />
multilateral forums, because they are the best vehicles for<br />
tackling global problems that are too broad and complex for<br />
individual nations to resolve alone.<br />
So, we are leading the efforts to liberalise world trade in<br />
the Uruguay Round; initiating moves to establish closer<br />
economic co-operation in our Asia Pacific region; hosting<br />
the recent Government and industry conference against<br />
chemical weapons; actively exertinq international pressure<br />
on the abhorrent system of apartheid.<br />
diverse issues, but all requiring serious and<br />
concerted efforts by many nations if the global<br />
community is to reap the benefits they promise.<br />
It is with that attitude and that aspiration that we<br />
approach these vital decisions that must be made about the<br />
future of Antarctica. </p>
<p>6<br />
Ladies and gentlemen,<br />
The intrepid voyages and scientific activities of Jacques<br />
Cousteau, from whom we will hear shortly, have inspired our<br />
generation, just as those of Dumont D'Urville, Amundsen and<br />
Hawson captured the imagination of our forebears.<br />
If we don't measure up in our decisions to protect the<br />
Antarctic environment, we can be certain that people like<br />
Jacques Cousteau will be there to tell us so.<br />
I am firmly convinced that one of the greatest legacies our<br />
generation can leave to the future may yet be one of the<br />
simplest: one continent unspoilt, a testament to our own<br />
recognition that in other corners of the world we have<br />
already gone too far. </p>
