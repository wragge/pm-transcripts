lb AUSTRALIA&amp;<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR PRESS 7 NOVEMBER 1977<br />
ADDRESS AT PARLIAMENTARY LUNCH TO FAREWELL THE GOVERNOR GENERAL<br />
Your Excellency, we are delighted to be with you and Lady Kerr today.<br />
As Prime Minister, I know I speak for the overwhelming majority<br />
of Australians in saying that you have carried out the duties<br />
of your office with dignity, calm, and integrity.<br />
Sir, you are respected by Australians. You are respected<br />
for your personal strength, your courage and your determination.<br />
This strength and resolve-characteristics displayed throughout<br />
your life was never more publicly evident than early in your<br />
term of office with the loss of your first wife.<br />
I and my colleagues greatly admired the way you did not allow<br />
that time of personal suffering to diminish in any way your<br />
utter commitment to carrying out your duties.<br />
You set standa-rds o-f---a--high order. You have never allowed yourself<br />
to be distracted from carrying Out the tasks of the Que's<br />
representative. You have faced some difficult times, but you have<br />
always faced them with dignity. I do regret that the Leader of<br />
the opposition and his colleagues have not secn fit to attend this<br />
Parliamentary function.<br />
Political debate in Australia is vigorous and criticism harsh.<br />
This is a fact of politics. Politicians of all political<br />
persuasions, and at all levels live with the rough and<br />
tumble of political debate. We learn to accept it.<br />
But beyond this conflict, and beyond that competition, the<br />
politician in a democratic society has a cardinal responsibility<br />
to unite, a responsibility not to divide. It is his task to<br />
strengthen the common bonds that make society workable, not<br />
-to erode.. them. The personal bitterness that has manifested itself<br />
IrL the. kind of boycott evident here-today, has no place in<br />
Australian parliamentary life. It has no place in Australian politiccs<br />
Your Excellency, you are one of a group of outstanding men who<br />
have represented Her Majesty in Australia. Your achievements<br />
in law and administration prior to your appointment as Governor<br />
General in 1974 marked you as an outstanding Australian.<br />
As Governor General, your integrity, and your commitment to<br />
this country and to the freedom of all Australians, has added<br />
immeasurably to that stature. </p>
<p>The ultimate role of the Monarch is to ensure that the country<br />
is governed within the terms of the Constitution a cardinal<br />
principle of which is the supremacy of Parliament, and through it<br />
the people, over the Executive. In this way, the Monarchy<br />
is the ultimate protector of the people. The residual powers<br />
of the Monarchy are few and rarely used but one instance when<br />
they may properly be called upon arises when the Executive tries<br />
to usurp the role of the Parliament. Any attempt, for example,<br />
by the Executive to continue to govern without appropriation<br />
of funds by Parliament demands that the supremacy of Parliament<br />
and of the people be upheld.<br />
That is the exceptional situation you had to face in 1975, and<br />
I believe quite certainly history will judge you a faithful<br />
servant of the Constitution who discharged his responsibilities<br />
under the Constitution in a time of exceptional difficulty.<br />
Your Excellency, I am unaware as to whether you intend to write<br />
momoirs. If you were to do so, I am sure there would be some passing<br />
interest in them. It is fair to say that distinguished<br />
Australians have traditionally in time recorded their<br />
own account of theirpublic achievements. I hope, Sir,<br />
that one day we may have a chance to read your account of an<br />
important and fascinating period.<br />
My comments today would not be complete without special mention of<br />
Lady Kerr. I know that Lady Kerr has stood beside you thrdughout<br />
the difficult times, and has been a source of strength and<br />
encouragement. We all, in public life especially, owe much to<br />
our wives. They endure what we endure yet are always ready to<br />
lend willing support, sympathy and understanding.<br />
Lady Kerr has certainly fulfilled this role.<br />
Your Excellency, on behalf of the Government and the people<br />
throughout Australia who think so highly of both of you, can<br />
I offer my sincere wish for many useful and enjoyable years ahead.<br />
You have made a significant contribution for many years to<br />
Australia's development.<br />
I know you will continue to apply your talents to the good<br />
of our country and the benefit of all Australians. </p>
