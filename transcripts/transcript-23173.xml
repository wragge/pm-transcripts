    <content><![CDATA[<p>It’s terrific to be here in Woolies at Balgowlah – really fantastic to be here. Great to be with Dick Smith, great to be with Tjeerd and all of his staff and I think this is a marvellous innovation. It’s so typical of Dick Smith that we should have this very creative way of helping our farmers, helping our charities, doing something for our country all at once.</p>
<p>Dick has been a business man, an adventurer, now a philanthropist and above all else, a great Australian patriot and when you buy a Dick Smith Foods product, you know that it’s Australian sourced as far as is humanly possible. You know that money is going to charity and now because of the Dick Smith Foundation, you can also have some say over exactly where that money goes. So it looks to me like a trifecta of good things as a result of what we’re doing today.</p>
<p>I also want to thank Woolies for what they’ve done. Often enough, you’ll prowl the aisles of the supermarket thinking “Where is the Australian product?”  Because of the Dick Smith stall, because of some of the other innovations that we see from Woolies today, you can know exactly where to go if you want to buy an Australian product and I think this Christmas, there will be lots of people who want to have their Christmas lunch or Christmas dinner with Australian products and much more easily done now thanks to this initiative.</p>
<p>So good on you Woolies, good on you Dick.</p>
<p>Let’s make it a better Christmas for Aussie farmers through this initiative.</p>
