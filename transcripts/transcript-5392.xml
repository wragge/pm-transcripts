ELECTORATE TALK<br />
The State Premiers and the Commonwealth, meeting in Loan<br />
Council in Canberra last Thursday and Friday took major<br />
decisions relating to Australia's national development.<br />
I want to tell you tonight about those decisions and what<br />
they mean for the future of Australia.<br />
While the oil crisis poses difficulties for all countries,<br />
it has also presented great opportunities for Australia.<br />
The doubling of the price of oil in less than 18 months has<br />
increased the demand for our resources of coal and has made<br />
Australia an attractive location for energy-intensive<br />
manufactures such as aluminium smelting.<br />
Some $ 17 billion worth of announced private sector investment<br />
projects that are planned to take place over the next few<br />
years are ample evidence of interest in Australian development.<br />
New figures will be released shortly that will sigrnificantlv<br />
upgrade this total.<br />
This in'vestment obviously requires investment by governments<br />
in pov# er generation, in transport and export facilities.<br />
The oil crisis has affected the need to accelerate development<br />
in another way.<br />
It has made it imperative for us to reduce our dependence<br />
on supplies of imported crude oil.<br />
I therefore wrote to the Premiers in November 1979 asking them<br />
to submit proposals to accelerate the development of<br />
coal-fired electricity generation capacity in Australia.<br />
We have been pleased with the response to our invitation.<br />
There is no way the States could have provided from their own<br />
resources the investment that is needed for development<br />
and to take advantage of the opportunities provided to<br />
Australia. </p>
<p>2<br />
Governments must invest in electricity generation, railways,<br />
coal loaders, telecommunications enJ in other facilities to<br />
provide the basic strength and supnport for resource development<br />
and processing and for private invest-menrt. generally.<br />
So two years ago we agreed on a special borrowing programme<br />
to underwrite Australia's national development.<br />
At last week's Loan Council meeti:. c we approved new projects,<br />
and major revision to previous projects, involving borrowings<br />
of $ 1.5 billion.<br />
This brings the total value of borrowings approved under the<br />
programme to $ 4.7 billion over a number of years.<br />
In addition there are a number of other projects which are<br />
still under examination.<br />
$ 1.3 billion of the new borrowings approved at our recent<br />
meeting were for electricity generation.<br />
They include large additional investments at Loy Yang in<br />
Victoria and at Bayswater in New South Wal-es,<br />
1.0,300 megawatts of generating capacity will be added to Australian<br />
grids as a result of the programme.<br />
And there is almost another 5,000 megawatts of capacity in the<br />
projects from New South Wales, Queensland and the Northern Territory<br />
that are still being examined by the Loan Council.<br />
Railway electrification offers another way of reducing our<br />
dependence on petroleum fuels.<br />
At the Loan Council meeting, the Commonwealth indicated its<br />
support for the electrification of three lines in Queensland<br />
which are essential to resource development Norwich Park to<br />
Hay Point, Blackwater to Gladstone and Collinsville to Abbott Point.<br />
Electrification of the Gosford-Newcastle line in New South Wales<br />
had been agreed by the Loan Council at an earlier meeting.<br />
Another electrification project Waterfall to Port Kembla in<br />
New' South Wales is being actively considered by the Loan Council.<br />
The Commonwealth has said that it % w. ill support the electrification<br />
of three other resource railway lines, two in New South Wales<br />
and one in Western Austtalia, if and when proposals are lodged<br />
by the States.<br />
The Commonwealth has also offered to fund half the cost of<br />
electrifying the Sydney-Melbourne railway line.<br />
Unfortunately New South Wales was not in a position to<br />
commit itself to this project. / 3 fl </p>
<p>3<br />
It is my intention to talk to Premier Wran at the first<br />
opportunity and I hope that this wi. l resolve the maLter.<br />
All. these projects are a dramatic illustration of our<br />
commitment to Australia's national development, and of our<br />
desire to channel Government spending into directions othat<br />
will build the basic strength of Australia.<br />
But we have not forgotten that the development will not<br />
occur unless we continue the firm economic policies that we<br />
have consistently followed during the past five years.<br />
We are concerned to maintain a steady pace of economic<br />
development, and not to place too sudden a demand on<br />
the resources of skilled labour and the capital market,<br />
in a way that would add to inflationary pressures.<br />
Because of this, and because of the size of these new<br />
projects and the need to proceed in an orderly and carefully<br />
integrated manner, the Commonwealth arid the States have<br />
agreed to look further at the borrowing proposals to make<br />
sure that there is an even flow and that the investment<br />
programmes expand carefully.<br />
Australia has entered an exciting decade during which we<br />
will see development and investment unparalleled in our<br />
country.<br />
With our supplies of minerals, our vast reserves of energy<br />
along with the quality and calibre of our people we have<br />
opportunities that are second to none.<br />
