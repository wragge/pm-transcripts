PRIME MINISTER PRESS STATEMENT NO. 3669<br />
14 November<br />
ASSISTANCE TO THE AUSTRALIAN MOTOR INDUSTRY<br />
A new plan to assist and strengthen the Australian<br />
motor industry was announced today by the Prime Minister,<br />
Mr. Whitlam. He said that it was the Government's intention<br />
that the new policy would operate for ten years and would<br />
therefore provide a stable framework within which industry<br />
would confidently plan.<br />
Mr. Whitlam said assistancee would be based on a<br />
company average local content plan of 85%. This would be<br />
supported by a tariff of 35% on complete cars when imports<br />
were less than or equal to 20% of total passenger motor vehicle<br />
registrations and 45% when in excess of 20%. In view of the<br />
existing abnormal rate of imports the higher duties would<br />
apply immediately. A differential of 10% would apply between<br />
imports of cars and unassembled vehicles.<br />
Duties of 25% would generally apply to components<br />
not in c. k. d. packs and minimum rates of duty would apply to<br />
certain specified components re;" erred to in the Commission's<br />
Report. The Prime Minister explained that the duty of<br />
on built up vehicles would remain for a minimum period of 6<br />
months and then would be subject to reduction to previous<br />
levels if and when the 12 month moving average of c. b. u.<br />
imports to total passenger motoy* vehicle registrations fell<br />
to 20% or below. Any subsequent changes in duty woul'd<br />
similarly be on this minimum 6 months basis.<br />
Mr. Whitlam said that commercial motor vehicles<br />
reported on by the Commission in its passenger motor vehicle<br />
report would be accorded the tariff treatment outlined above<br />
passenger motor vehicles. </p>

He said that the existing 85% and 95% local<br />
content plans would be phased out over four years and then<br />
replaced by the new plan.. Under this plan local manufacturers<br />
would at the end of the four year period have to achieve 85% local<br />
content on a company average basis on all of their vehicles<br />
manufactured or assembled in Australia to be eligible for by-law<br />
concessions. The actual by-law concessions have yet to be<br />
finally determined by the Government. Provision would be made<br />
for phasing new manufacturers into the plan subject to approval<br />
by the Government. Relevant matters in the consideration of<br />
any such applications would inc1Vdeprational use of resources,<br />
location and complementation.<br />
Mr Whitlam said that to accord with the new vehicle<br />
plan the existing component manufacturing programs involving<br />
over 85% local content requirement would be phased down to<br />
over a maximum period of 4 years and no new programs would<br />
be instituted. " These proposals will develop a stronger long-term<br />
base for the local industry and help safeguard the jobs of<br />
Australian workers," Mr Whitlam said.<br />
" At the same time they will allow the industry to<br />
adjust more easily to basic structural changes essential for<br />
its future growth and viability."<br />
Mr Whitlam said the Government accepted the judgment<br />
of the Industries Assistance Commission, expressed in its recent<br />
report, that the Australian motor industry should be restructured.<br />
It accepted the IAC's judgment that assistance policies of the<br />
last decade had contributed significantly to the present<br />
unsatisfactory state of the industry.<br />
Mr Whitlam said: " The Government has moved to correct<br />
a number of problems associated with past protection policies<br />
by reducing the high 95% local content requirements, moving<br />
away from a multiplicity of plans to a single plan and<br />
changing the plans from a model to a company basis.<br />
" The industry must be able to exploit the advantages<br />
of economies of scale. Special action will be taken to<br />
encourage common sourcing of components to allow this, with<br />
consequent cost savings. In addition, special attention will<br />
be paid to complementation schemes with overseas sources and<br />
markets. " The Government believes these changes will lead to<br />
greater specialization in the production of components, reduce<br />
model proliferation and fragmentation and produce a more<br />
viable industry in the long run. They should also considerably<br />
simplify the present assistance arrangements for the industry." </p>
<p>The Prime Minister said talks were under way with<br />
Japanese motor producers about the possibility of their further<br />
manufacturing motor vehicles in Australia. Japanese technical<br />
experts would come to Australia soon to carry out feasibility<br />
s tugies. ". While the new tariff arrangement will lead in the<br />
Sshort-term to somewhat higjher prices for imported motor vehicles<br />
it is expected that in the medium-term the new arrangement will<br />
result in a better based local industry with consequent<br />
advantages to local consumers and the economy generally,"<br />
Mr Whitlam said.<br />
" The Government wants necessary changes to proceed in<br />
a manageable way. The present proposals will enable this."<br />
Mr Whitlam said the industry in South Australia and in<br />
other major motor vehicle producing centres would be safeguarded.<br />
Firms and employees in the industry adver~ ly affected by this<br />
decision will be eligible for consideration for-adjustment assistance<br />
under the Structural Adjustment Assistance Scheme subject to<br />
the criteria orovided for in that Scheme. In addition assistance<br />
under the Non-Metropolitan Subsidy Scheme would be available.<br />
The Australian Government gives a high priority to<br />
its programs designed to create a new growth centre in Albury/<br />
Wodonga. ~ ie Government is concerned to ensure that groWth<br />
centres are _ ased on sound economic industries. The Government<br />
is confident that the future operations of Borg-Warner at<br />
Albury/ Wodonga will provide such a basis.<br />
However, the Government recognises that the existing<br />
operations of Borg-Warner could be affected by the introduction<br />
of the new motor vehicle policy. * Therefore the Government is<br />
prelatred to assist Borg-Warner in Albury/ Wodonga for an interim<br />
peri. -2 if necessary in addition to assistance which may be<br />
availaole through the non-metropolitan subsidy scheme, so that<br />
it can cirry out any necessary adjustments to its operations<br />
to ensure continued long-term viability.<br />
The Departments of Urban and Regional Development,<br />
Manufacturing Industry arn. Prime Minister and Cabinet are<br />
ready to co-operate with the company and with Repco Bearing<br />
Company Pty Ltd in Launceston to pr. ovide any necessary<br />
assistance and to help the companies take full advantage of the<br />
economies available under the new policy including the wider<br />
markets in the region. </p>
