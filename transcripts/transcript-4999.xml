PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR PRESS 25 MARCH 1979<br />
GREEK NATIONAL INDEPENDENCE DAY<br />
I would like to thank you for giving me the opportunity to<br />
speak on Greek National Independence Day, on the 158th anniversary<br />
of the beginning of the Greek war of independence against the<br />
Ottoman Empire.<br />
The indomitable spirit that motivated the Greeks to throw off the.<br />
foreign yoke after centuries of subjugation has been admired by<br />
all those who believe in man's unbreakable commitment to freedom,<br />
in the capacity for heroism and the willingness to fight against<br />
the odds. This spirit has been shown again and again, in the<br />
course of Greek history. It was clear in the second world war<br />
when Greece's fight against the vastly superior Fascist and Nazi<br />
forces set an example for the world, and in that war Australians<br />
and Greeks fought side by side in the defence of liberty.<br />
Today gives us an opportunity to reflect on the contribution that<br />
the Greeks have made to the world, and to Austra2ia. This<br />
contribution is manifest in the city states of Ancient Greece,<br />
in the supremely influential ideas of the Ancient Greeks: in<br />
philosophy, science, history, literature and politics; in the<br />
array of such great men as Homer, Socrates, Plato, Archimedes<br />
and Sophocles; in the marvels of Byzantium. All of this is not<br />
just history it is a living part of the spirit of Western man,<br />
a spirit which is intrinsic to our every day lives, fundamental<br />
to our highest aspirations.<br />
Australia as part of Western civilization would owe a debt to the<br />
Greeks for these inestimable contributions, even if not a single<br />
Greek had migrated to this country. But Australia's debt goes<br />
much deeper, for today there are some 300,000 people of Greek<br />
origin in Australia.<br />
Australia has long offered to people of all nations the freedom<br />
and opportunity to build a better life for themselves and their<br />
children. The Greeks of Australia have taken this opportunity,<br />
and contributed to every sphere of Australian life: to the<br />
professions, to the arts, to industry and commerce. The contribution<br />
that the Greeks have made has earned them the respect of other<br />
Australians. Nothing can undermine this respect. It has been<br />
earned by the hard work and the sacrifices of tens of thousands<br />
of Greeks in this country. It is not open to doubt or to<br />
denigration. This is my Government's-unequivocal position, and<br />
there should be no doubt about it. </p>
<p>-2<br />
Migration moving away from accustomed surroundings, from family<br />
and friends is not an easy thing. Once the decision is taken and<br />
migration takes place, there are new problems to confront. Few<br />
native-born Australians in their lifetime have to face the same<br />
psychological and social stresses, the difficulties involved in<br />
adjusting to a new society and an alien language.<br />
I believe that it is only recently that sufficient recognition<br />
has emerged amongst the wider Australian society of the tremendous<br />
problems and traumas migrants face, and that not enough was done<br />
in the past to assist migrants during their most difficult postarrival<br />
period. I believe that a great step forward has been<br />
taken to remedy that situation by the Government accepting the<br />
recommendations of the Galbally report on post-arrival services<br />
to migrants. As a result of the report the Government is committed<br />
to spending an additional $ 50 million over three years, and to<br />
consult migrants on implementation.<br />
We believe that consultation is critical because migrants, and<br />
very notably the Greeks, have been able to establish a network<br />
of community institutions: churches, schools, newspapers, welfare<br />
societies, brotherhoods and sports bodies. These institutions,<br />
growing out of a determination to preserve valued aspects of the<br />
Greek heritage, have smoothed the difficult process of adjustment<br />
into Australian society. Far from being a barrier to the<br />
integration of Greeks into Australian society, they have helped<br />
that process, and enriched Australia as a whole.<br />
Today, Australia has developed a vibrant multi-cultural society,<br />
and this Government is committed to the right of Ethnic groups<br />
to maintain their Ethnic languages and cultures, and committed<br />
to promoting a greater understanding and tolerance amongst all<br />
Australians. Recognising the importance of the Media in an multi-cultural<br />
society, we are expanding Ethnic radio and will introduce Ethnic<br />
T. V. The pilot programmes on Ethnic T. V. will begin in Sydney<br />
and Melbourne late next month or early May, and provide Ethnic<br />
communities with the opportunity to participate in and comment<br />
on the form of the future service.<br />
The Galbally report recommended that the National Ethnic<br />
Broadcasting Advisory Council undertake a series of public<br />
consultations with respect to the development of Ethnic T. V.<br />
It has now become clear that members of the Council are unable<br />
to devote the necessary time to carry out this recommendation.<br />
I am happy to announce that the Government is establishing a<br />
Consultative Committee on Ethnic to carry out the<br />
consultations envisaged in the Galbally report. It will comprise<br />
Mr Frank Galbally; Mr Keith Cairns, a director of the Herald-Sun<br />
T. V. Pty. Ltd., Melbourne; and Miss Paula Masselos, a social worker<br />
with the Greek Orthodox Community of St. George in Brisbane.<br />
The Government is also firmly of the view that Australia will<br />
benefit from our Ethnic communities maintaining and renewing their<br />
ties with their families and friends overseas. At the moment we<br />
are negotiating cheaper air fares to Greece, which will greatly / 3 </p>
<p>3<br />
help people wishing to visit Greece. We hope to be able to<br />
conclude an agreement in the near future.<br />
Ladies and Gentlemen, the fact that the Greek National Day is<br />
celebrated by the leaders of the Liberal and Labor parties,<br />
people whose origins are not Greek, underscores an important<br />
fact about contemporary Australian Society. There is now general<br />
recognition in this country that one can love Australia and be<br />
an effective member of Australian society while retaining an<br />
affection and preserving the cultural heritage of one's country<br />
of origin.<br />
For many years it was believed by many people that to really<br />
become an Australian a migrant had to abandon the heritage<br />
of the country in which he was born and submerge himself in<br />
what were regarded as the essential characteristics of the<br />
Anglo-Saxon majority. Those days of Anglo-Saxon conformity<br />
are gone, and we are all better off for that.<br />
Before the great postwar migration, Australia might have been<br />
regarded as a rather insular Anglo-Saxon society, but since then<br />
tens of thousands of people from Greece and many other nations<br />
have contributed to our material well being and to fashioning<br />
a distinctive Australian culture out of the best that many<br />
cultures have to offer. We are a better society for that.<br />
As Australians, all of us are participating in the evolution<br />
of a greater nation. </p>
