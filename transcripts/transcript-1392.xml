PRESS CONFERENCE -GIVEN BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
MR HAROLD HOLT AT THE SAVOY HOTEL, LONDON.<br />
16th September. 1966.<br />
We've i: ust concluded~ a remarkable Conference perhaps an<br />
historic one. To take the brightest view of it one could even speculate that<br />
this marks another milestone in man's long search for peaceful collaboration on<br />
a basis of multi-racialism but that is. i repeat taking the optimistic view of<br />
things, and this could only be confirmned by subsequent expe'~ iences in which the<br />
lessons of this cjDnference had been learned and some of the more unsatisfactory<br />
features of it removed, There were some unsatisfactory features. Most of these were<br />
evident enough. The practice which had develop d, I think it showed itself at<br />
Lagos. but this was the first time I'd experienced a process of regular Caucus<br />
meetings on what was blatantly a racial basis of membership and we would be<br />
most critical of the continuance of this kind of practice on any sort of regular<br />
basis at any future meetings.<br />
The concentration of attention on Rhodesia occupying more than<br />
six days of the discussion necessarily limited opportunities for consideration of<br />
the very many other important matters before us and in the result consideration<br />
of such important areas of discussion as the world political situation and the<br />
world economic situation tended to be disjointed and inadequate as to the total<br />
time available and on some aspects of subsequent subject matters there was scope<br />
for little more than a perfunctory treatment. I think that although delegates had<br />
opportunity to speak. the fact that there was limited time had the effect of<br />
reducing the contribution which many would otherwise have made and, in some<br />
instances. I think discouraged delegates from making any contribution at all.<br />
In the result the discussions were unsatisfying in these two important fields,<br />
containing as they did these matters of considerable impor-tance and concern for<br />
Australia. I made a statement myself on the world political situation<br />
concentrating my own remarks on the Asian scene and Vietnam in particular, and<br />
when we came to the communique I registered at that point my concern that we had<br />
not had an adequate and satisfying discussion on Vietnam and gave notice that if<br />
this issue was still a current topic. th!? t we would expect a very mnuch mnore compkle<br />
discussion on Vietnam at the next C,-nf eriance.<br />
On the world economic situation I was given ie role of leading<br />
the discussion there and, although there were some other speakers it didn't<br />
secure a very widespread discussion not that any great significance should be<br />

The communique reflects to a considerable degree the Australian contribution and<br />
we were not challenged on any of the more positive points that I put forward in the<br />
course of my own presentation.<br />
I said at the outset that taking an optimistic view of things, one<br />
could regard this Conference as having brought the Commonwealth successfully<br />
through a critically testing period, not only was it an issue of great difficulty.<br />
complexity and delicacy involving as it did aspects of race, aspects of minority<br />
rule. historic association between Great Britain and Rhodesia the evolution of<br />
new nations on the continent of Africa itself these were only some of the facets<br />
of this most absorbing but typical question and although the communique reflected<br />
the differences of view that were held at some stages of the Conference it seemed<br />
most unlikely that any communique reflecting at least that degree of agreement<br />
could have been produced and there were even expectations that there would be<br />
walk-outs from the Onference, -erhaps on a quite considerable scale. And s </p>
<p>-2<br />
to have come through all these swirling currents and landed the Commonwealth<br />
safely on the other shore is something of an achi avement.<br />
It has left problems unsolved, including the Rhodesian issue<br />
itself., It has merely pointed two directions in which action may follow but even'<br />
the most optimistic would not imagine that we had satisfactorily settled the<br />
Rhodesian issue. But have in mind that of all the situations in the world that could<br />
present difficulties for us this is the only one on which any pow erful disagreements<br />
were voiced; there were other matters on which differences of view, of course,<br />
are held. There is no uniformity of view, for example, on ~, ietnam but I think<br />
itf s worth commenting that there was so much agreement on so many other issues<br />
and the communique reflects a good deal of constructive, positive work at less<br />
controversial levels which mark an organisation capable of doing a job of work for<br />
its member countries. I think that the Secretariat has provided some valuable strengthening<br />
on the organisation side. We're still feeling our way with the operation of the<br />
Secretariat, I think several members would be reluctant to see it build itself into<br />
an organisation that was attempting to influence policy thinking of its members, but<br />
it can do a very useful job at the administrative level and in maintaining closer<br />
co-ordination between Commonwealth countries making the affairs of each more<br />
widely known to the others, and these things can be counted as credits which have<br />
emerged from this particular Co) nference.<br />
So that weighing the experiences of the last two weeks on a scale of<br />
balance, I would feel that on balance the conference has demonstrated some succesSE.<br />
It has also revealed dangers in relation to our future conduct which if allowed to go<br />
unchecked, could themselves lead to a weakening of the Commonwealth Association.<br />
Would you like to put any queries, Gentlemen, on any of these<br />
aspects Q. Was the Common Market discussed at all?<br />
A. Yes, but Mr Wilson made it clear that there was no early move in<br />
contemplatiou that Britain did want to enter the Common Market.<br />
The terms of entry had not been made any easier for it as the<br />
recent visit of M. Pompidou revealed, but he repeated the assurance<br />
that he's given on other occasions that the United Kingdom would not<br />
enter the Common Market without giving full consideration to the<br />
views and situation of dher Commonwealth countries.<br />
Q. Mr Holt, from the tone of your speech this morning it seems that<br />
you would examine rather carefully coming to a Commonwealth<br />
Meeting again if Rhodesia was going to be dominating the conference<br />
to such a degree with the African Caucus.<br />
A. Well I wouldn't be serving ultimatums up myself but I think that<br />
when the agenda for the next meeting is proposed we would want<br />
to be assured that there would be reasonable opportunities for<br />
discussion of the wide variety of matters which interest so many<br />
other members of the Commonwealth, as I found it necessary to<br />
point out on the sixth day, or was it the seventh day that we had for<br />
six days of the conference been discussing the affairs of, or leaving<br />
untouched the affairs of nine-tenths of mankind. and in resisting the<br />
move that was bei ng made then for another adjournment so that the<br />
Caucus could go into action and this is so with three-fifths of the<br />
world's population east of Suez, and we hadn't got within a week's<br />
sailing of that area after the first six days.<br />
I see some paper this morning has a reference as to how I came to<br />
be in the chair perhaps I can clear that little point because I / 3 </p>
<p>-3<br />
thought it was not without and I don't want to make overmuch of<br />
it my temporary occupancy of the chair actually arose as the<br />
result of a proposal by Mr Lee Kuan Yew it wasn't Mr Wilson's<br />
nomination. He was away at the time and they wanted to get on<br />
with the business, so having occupied the chair at that session I<br />
think on occasions when he was absent subsequently Mr Wilson<br />
thought it convenient that I should carry on and did so. but<br />
somebody I see in the paper mentioned that it was because I just<br />
happened to be across the table from him so did Mike Pearson<br />
and a few other people buL I think we can say that Australia found<br />
a friendly atmosphere among the delegates.<br />
We talked quite frankly and realistically on matters involving<br />
questions of race. There was no disposition on our part to either<br />
retreat from the Australian point of view or to conceal its light<br />
behind the curtain, and f feel that there has been a gain for me<br />
personally in relationships which have strengthened with the heads<br />
of delegations. I've come to know a lot of them much more<br />
personally aad had many opportunities for formal discussion with<br />
them which was helpful.<br />
I gather that some of the Asian delegations in their comments to the<br />
Press have expressed appreciation that Australia was showing such<br />
an interest in Asian affairs and playing an active part so that too<br />
is useful India, in particular, commented a lot on it.<br />
Q. Mr Holt, do you think our relationships with Africa have been harmed<br />
at all by our close stand with Britain on this Rhodesian issue?<br />
A. Well no, I think that follows from what I have just been saying. I<br />
don't think so because Atrstralia made it clear throughout that we<br />
regarded the Rhodesian issue as primarily a matter between Great<br />
Britain and her Colony and while we welcomed the opportunity<br />
which Great Britain had provided to other Commonwealth countries<br />
to offer their views about the situation, we still felt that in the<br />
final resort it was a British responsibility to decide how it was goinag<br />
to deal with the situation and so we were anxious to avoid adopting<br />
courses which were not acceptable to the United Kingdom and which<br />
would merely serve to complicate its task. We were therefore against<br />
the use of force, and we feel that so far as the aspect of sanctions are<br />
concerned, again the United Kingdom will have to be selective in the<br />
application of sanctions if difficulties are to be avoided and dangers<br />
escalate in the southern part of Africa.<br />
Q. There would be no doubt about your support of Britain in the TJi~ ted<br />
Nations for these sanctions if she chose to apply them<br />
A. I don't contemplate any difficulty for Australia in that coursl but I've<br />
not yet. of course, had an opportunity to go over the work of the<br />
Conference fully with my own colleagues or, for that matter with<br />
Parliament, but this is a consistent course that Australia has been<br />
following. We've applied sanctions to imports from Rhodesia covering about<br />
96 percent of our trade from that Country and the particular matters on<br />
which further sanctions might be applied don't affect Australia oil,<br />
for example, if they decide to intensify oil sanctions. I would just<br />
emphasise that Australia remains a free agent in the course that it<br />
is to adopt. We're not committed to any line of action but you asked<br />
whether I thought there would be any difficulty about it, I don't<br />
foresee it. but we're able to decide our own course on that.<br />
You say you'll want assurances when the next agenda is drawn up </p>
<p>-4<br />
that Rhodesia won't dominate it and that you'll have an opportunity<br />
to discuss other matters. Say if these assurances aren't forthcoming.<br />
A. I'm not talking about formal assurances, I think there's general<br />
agreement that there was a quite disproportionate amount of time<br />
even coniceding the importance of the subject and the highly<br />
argumentative content of so many of the contributions but we felt,<br />
several of us, that the Commonwealth was suffering in the eyes of<br />
outside observers from what would appear to them to be a failure<br />
to manage its business in a practical and sensible way.<br />
Q. There wasn't a move to have the next Conference other than in<br />
London.#?<br />
A. Yes Well, when you say there was a move, that matter was<br />
discussed and we all agreed that it was not a question of a<br />
principle involved. One suggestion had been that because Britain<br />
had formerly been regarded as Head of the Commonwealth whereas<br />
now we were all equal members at least in a juridical sense<br />
that we shouldr't come reptatedly to London. I took up the commenton<br />
this myself pointir. g out that it was a matter of convenience for,' most<br />
of us to meet in London, that most of us had bi-lateral arrangements<br />
with Great Britain on a variety of matters and we were able to deal<br />
with these at the same time as coping with the affairs of the Prime<br />
Ministers.' Conference. Most of us had larger official establishments<br />
in Londoni than any other part of the Commonwealth. It is the<br />
headquarters of the Secretariat so that it would be rather more of<br />
an operation to move all the officials around, and most of us. if it<br />
were held somcwhere else, would still find it necessary to come on<br />
to London to take up discussions with Ministers here. But where we<br />
came out on it was that we agreed that we wouldn't adopt any hardand-<br />
fast rule that as a matter of practice meetings would be held<br />
mostly in London, but we didn't exclude the possibility of going to<br />
another Capital either to mark some historic occasion or<br />
( interj ection such as the Centerrary of Canada) well such<br />
as the Centenary of Canada, well I don't know how Mr Pearson would<br />
respond to that, but I rather got the impression that he thought<br />
London was a pretty good place to hold Conferences.<br />
However, there was no lengthy discussion or any substantial<br />
argument about it it was accepted generally as a statement of<br />
how things might operate in the future.<br />
Q. Mr Holt, you mentioned your concern that so little time was spent<br />
in discussing Vietnam. Do you think the Commonwealth could<br />
really do anything useful in this regard?<br />
A. Well, I think it's important that the Commonwealth be better<br />
inf * ormed and more knowledgeable about Vietnam than it is.<br />
it seems to me to mark an inadequacy of attention when I point<br />
out that I'm the only Head of Government, so far as I'm aware,<br />
certainly from within the Commonwealth and for the last twelve<br />
months anyhow outside it, to have visited Vietnam and a lot of<br />
people make very powerful speeches about what ou ght to be done<br />
in Vietnam without really having very much direct knowledge of<br />
what is occurring there. But if we can't have visitations well at<br />
1k. ast let's have some really searching di scussion and I would<br />
like to find my fellow Commonwealth colleagues declaring where<br />
they stand on it, if they take exception to Australia' s stand<br />
Indicating why th~ ydo so. At the moment I think we've got, as do<br />
most of our members, a fairly wishy-washy attitude on Vietnam, full<br />
8ae~ V? ns but not a vw pactical contribution to what ou~ ght t o be<br />
d </p>
