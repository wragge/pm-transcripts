    <content><![CDATA[<p>Residents living in the South Australian Aboriginal community of Yalata will benefit from $7 million in improvements to infrastructure, health and education services in 2018 thanks to the Army Aboriginal Community Assistance Programme (AACAP).</p>
<p>In 2018, AACAP will be celebrating 22 years of successful collaboration between Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet, the Department of Defence and state and territory governments to deliver much needed infrastructure to 42 communities around Australia.</p>
<p>A huge part of AACAPâ€™s success lies in the fact it is tailored specifically in collaboration with the community and relevant government agencies to identify opportunities for jobs, training and leadership for locals. Each year, AACAP delivers a new project that improves environmental health and living conditions in a remote Indigenous community.</p>
<p>Yalata is a small town near Ceduna with a population of under 300. Our soldiers will build a new multi-purpose early childhood facility, improve existing waste management facilities, build new bores, airstrip fencing and housing and upgrade the caravan park. The provision of staff housing for the local community will also allow it to be used in the delivery of critical human services to residents. Around 150 soldiers will work on the project.</p>
<p>The South Australian Government will contribute $1.1 million as well as ongoing support for the new infrastructure.</p>
