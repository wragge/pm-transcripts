OPENING OF TI-E SCOTTISH AMICABLE LIIE ASSURANCE CO.<br />
MELBOURN'E 29TH NOVEMBER<br />
Speech by the Prime Minister, Sir Robert Menzies/$ O<br />
WB~ ERflA<br />
Sir and Gentlemen: LIW<br />
I was very interested to be reminded thw<br />
your directors, Lord Dilsiand and the Earl of Elgin arÃ± ht<br />
of the Thistle. I think they were both present when I was<br />
somewhat incautiously installed in that Order.<br />
I remember another thing about that event and<br />
that was that the previous evening att Holyrood, The Queen said<br />
to me, " How am I to pronounce your name, tomorrow, because I<br />
summon you up Menzies or Mingles?" And I said, "' Ma'am, in<br />
this place, Mingles." 1 ( Laughter) And so I was duly installed<br />
as Robert Gordon Mingles and if anybody takes exception to that,<br />
I cantt help it because they will persist, Sir, in Australia<br />
in calling me Menzies. I was trying to remember this morning whether I hnd<br />
given any of you my reminiscences on that point. There was a<br />
vast patriotic dinner in London, one of those things at which<br />
800 people are present and speeches are made, frequently very<br />
tedious speeches, and naturally in that category, I was one of<br />
the speakers, and they always have a red-conted gentleman in<br />
dharge who, though I suspect very strongly that he comes from<br />
East London somewhere, speaks with the most polished accents of<br />
the Home Counties. " Pray silence for " and then running on<br />
right through your description, you see. He came up to me one<br />
evening, having annoiinced me a few times before and said in a<br />
hoarse voice, very Scottish voice, " Excuse me, Sir, but am I to<br />
announce ye as Menzies or by your pr-r-roper name. ( Laughter)<br />
Now, Sir, I am of course delighted to a-ssist in any<br />
way at a Scottish invasion of Australia, because I know that it<br />
is all to the good. In fact, Hugh and I were in other company<br />
on Saturday night and were told that 150,000 people of Scottish<br />
birth are in Australia not enough you may say but quality<br />
counts more than quantity, except at election time. ( Laughter)<br />
But my embarrassment doesn't arise from having to<br />
say something good about the Scots, about the Scottish Amicable;<br />
it arises from the fact that inadvertently, time after time, I<br />
have been persuaded to open an office in this city for an<br />
insurance or assurance society. This is becoming most<br />
embarrassing. They are all in competition one with the other.<br />
They are all able to ask their field staff, to authorise their<br />
field staff to say,. " Of course, our company has a very special<br />
relationship to the Commonwealth Government. You know, the<br />
Prime Minister opened our building." And that is really why<br />
I decided that I wiould let them all come so that in the end<br />
I could have been completely impartial.<br />
Over on the other side of Collins Street, I made<br />
rude remarks about the building on this side of Collins Street<br />
and then found that I had to open the building. on this side of<br />
Collins Street. I was just recalling this morning that in my<br />
respectable days at the Bar, I remember appearing in a case<br />
involving the valuation of a property in Queen Street and I ma-de<br />
a most powerful case to show that Queen Street was a dead area<br />
anyhow. It could never be a live place because it ran uphill and<br />
/ 2 </p>
<p>2<br />
business people didn't like streets that ran uphill. It was<br />
a very powerful argument before the late Mr. Justice Starke.<br />
He dismissed it. And rightly because now this great canyon<br />
of buildings is the very heart of so much of the business and<br />
financial life of a city which remains in so many ways the<br />
financial leader in Australia.<br />
I have made my policy to you; I have shown that<br />
there is a certain embarrassment about this and having done<br />
that, I would just like to offer you my own testimony about<br />
life assurance. When I first became counsel at the Bar, I took<br />
life assurance, usually prodded on by a gimlet-eyed fellow<br />
who called into my chambers and said " Have you got enough<br />
insurance?" AndI took what I thought I could afford to pay<br />
for and like everybody of my generation in this room today,<br />
I have put in a number of years now regretting that I didn' t<br />
take more. It seems so much at the time doesn't it? It<br />
seems so little as you look back on it ana yet if we had all<br />
been wise enough to take more, to go to our limit in what I<br />
have always ca led compulsory saving, then not only would our<br />
individual circumstances be more solid, our families provided<br />
for more adequately, but we would through all these funds,<br />
have made a notable contribution to national development,<br />
because the assurance companies, the assurance societies are<br />
tremendous investors in the development of this nation of<br />
ours. And so I am very much struck, thinking about this<br />
with the idea that I for one have regretted for years that<br />
I didn't take more, and I would like to say to all the young<br />
ones in the ountry, " don't you fall into that error." After<br />
all, you must be better than us in some respects, otherwise<br />
there is no hope in life.<br />
Compulsory saving, Sir, I said, yes, it's more<br />
than that-it's a joint saving for investment capital all<br />
policy-holders being in that sense joint investors in the<br />
investments that have been made by the Society, and this in<br />
a country which is capital hungry, this in a country which<br />
imports capital, and so far as I can judge, will need to go<br />
on importing capital for a considerable time to come, a<br />
country whose immense resources for development are so great,<br />
whose population is so relatively small, whose normal savings,<br />
even though they are not too bad are quite inadequate for the<br />
task of providing capital for investment, capital for<br />
industrial growth, capital for national growth. In a country<br />
like this, the function of the assurance societies is, I<br />
think, beyond praise, a tremendous contribution.<br />
Some of you may say, " Yes that doesn't protect<br />
the assurance societies from occasionally being given orders<br />
by the government." No, that's quite right. " Whom the Lord<br />
loveth he chasteneth...." ( Laughter) But I want there to be<br />
no mistake about my own belief that in our country, placed as<br />
we are now with all the opportunities in the world at our<br />
doorstep, one of the great deficiencies, apart from some<br />
shortage of manpower, apart from pressures of all kinds one<br />
of the great deficiencies is a deficiency in capital. And one<br />
doesn t like to become too dependent on capital from overseas,<br />
valuable as it is.<br />
I wouldn't want to see a state of affairs in<br />
Australia in which, chronically, over decades, the deficiency<br />
on our trading account was made up by capital importation. </p>
<p>3<br />
This would not in the long run, be healthy, though that capital<br />
today, and so far ahead as one can see, is of immense importance<br />
and is tremendously welcome in Australia. This makes it all the<br />
more important that these great instruments of mutual saving and<br />
mutual investment should be encouraged, should go on and should<br />
succeed and it is in that sense, Mr. Chairman that I want to<br />
say that I am delighted to be here, delighted to free myself<br />
for the moment of any Scottish bias, delighted to wish you well,<br />
and also to hope as you would hope, that the growing prosperity<br />
of this society will be matched by the growing success of other<br />
societies of the same kind because in the total, this is of immense<br />
national significance. Sir, I have very great pleasure in declaring the<br />
building open. </p>
