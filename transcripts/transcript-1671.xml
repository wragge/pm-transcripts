FOR PRESS PM. No. 94/ 1167<br />
VISIT BY THE PRIME MINISTER OF LAOS<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister, Mr Harold Holt<br />
I am pleased to announce that Frince Souvanna Phouma,<br />
Frime Minister of Laos, has accepted the Government's invitation to<br />
visit Australia. He will be accompanied by his daughter, Princess Moune<br />
Souvanna Fhouma. The Prime Minister and Princess Moune will arrive in<br />
Australia on Tuesday, 31st Cctober, and will remain until Saturday,<br />
11th November. During his stay, Prince Souvanna Fhouma will have<br />
discussions in Canberra and will visit Sydney, Melbourne and the Snowy<br />
Mountains Scheme. This will be the first visit to Australia by a Laotian Prime<br />
Minister and follows closely on my own visit to Laos, the first to that<br />
country by an Australian Frime Minister.<br />
I welcome this further contribution that our meeting together<br />
will make to a closer relationship with a country which has a growing<br />
significance for Australia, and for South-East Asia generally.<br />
