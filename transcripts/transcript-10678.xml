    <content><![CDATA[<p>E&amp;OE...............................................</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>PM, good morning.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Good morning Alan.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>So what's the rationale behind this?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Because, I think Australians should be given the opportunity to</p>
<p>   directly own as many shares as they want to in Australia's</p>
<p>   biggest company. That's the rationale behind it. That's</p>
<p>   the personal rationale behind. </p>
<p>The broader economic rationale behind it is that having privatised</p>
<p>   one-third of Telstra it is commercially unwise for the Government</p>
<p>   to retain the other two-thirds. The company will be run better in</p>
<p>   full private ownership. That is the view of those who now run the</p>
<p>   company. That is the view of many market analysts. So it is a plus,</p>
<p>   plus situation. It's an opportunity for the men and women of</p>
<p>   Australia to buy directly into the company. And they demonstrated</p>
<p>   in their hundreds of thousands that they wanted to do it in relation</p>
<p>   to the first one-third and I am sure they will give an equal thumbs</p>
<p>   up to the remaining two-thirds.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>In relation to privatisation of public utilities which provide</p>
<p>   important community services, how do you achieve, in the process,</p>
<p>   the proper balance that must exist between the interests of the</p>
<p>   shareholder and the interests of the consumer. Now I am thinking</p>
<p>   of people in far-flung areas, outback Australia and so on.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>You do that very easily by passing a law compelling the company,</p>
<p>   even though it is in private hands, to provide community service</p>
<p>   obligations. We did that in relation to the one-third sale. Already</p>
<p>   we have said, quite explicitly, that we will do the same in relation</p>
<p>   to the remaining two-thirds. I say to the people of country Australia</p>
<p>   you're community services will be protected. The law will compel</p>
<p>   a privatised Telstra to provide you with those basic services.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>And cost of that? A cap on the cost.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>The cost will have to be born by the company.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>And a cap on the cost?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Oh yes.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>Local calls, could a private company charge for the time?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>The prohibition on un-timed local calls will remain.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>As you are saying this today - and the argument is $45 billion,</p>
<p>   and it looks an awful lot of money - there are blokes who had a</p>
<p>   job a month ago at the mine at Goulburn, or the mine at Cobar, or</p>
<p>   the mine at Lithgow, or the mine at Gunnedah who are saying how</p>
<p>   in the hell do I get a slice of all of this? Where does the money</p>
<p>   go? How can we actually make sure that those in need do get some</p>
<p>   slice of all of this?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Alan, the great bulk of the money, that's the overwhelming</p>
<p>   bulk of the money, will reduce debt. In this one single act we will</p>
<p>   be able to reduce about 40 per cent, wipe out about 40 per cent</p>
<p>   of the total Federal Government debt of Australia. Never before</p>
<p>   in our history will we, by one deed, have done so much to reduce</p>
<p>   such a large debt.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>Do you think you have won the battle in explaining how important</p>
<p>   that is to Australian people?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I suppose I will find that out at the election, Alan. Like</p>
<p>   all of these things you meet your makers and you meet your judgment</p>
<p>   day, I mean the people are my makers as far as ..(inaudible).. and</p>
<p>   it is true. I have never...</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>But the Asian lesson, of course, is obviously to do something about</p>
<p>   debt, both private and Government, isn't it?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>And in the long run you can provide more jobs, you can provide</p>
<p>   more security and you can have more wherewithal to help people who</p>
<p>   really need help if you have got a strong economy and a strong economy</p>
<p>   means as little debt as possible. And we accumulated not only a</p>
<p>   budget deficit of $10.5 billion or inheritated not only a budget</p>
<p>   deficit of $10.5 billion, but a huge accumulated series of budget</p>
<p>   deficits adding up to about $100 billion.</p>
<p>Now in this one single deed we will lay the foundation for moving</p>
<p>   about 40 per cent, in one single policy decision, 40 per cent of</p>
<p>   Australia's accumulated Government debt. Now that will take</p>
<p>   a huge load off the backs of Australians because it will mean that</p>
<p>   we won't have to pay interest every year to service that $40</p>
<p>   billion. I mean if you can cut your housing loan in half you pay</p>
<p>   less interest. If you can cut the national housing loan in half</p>
<p>   you pay less interest.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>Foreign ownership?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Foreign ownership. There will be severe limits placed on it as</p>
<p>   there were in relation to the one third. There is no way that this</p>
<p>   company could ever remotely, possibly fall into the hands of foreign</p>
<p>   owners.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>Just on something you are going to do today there is publicity</p>
<p>   today that you are going to announce extra funding for the crackdown</p>
<p>   on illegal drugs. Can you give any advance indication of what that</p>
<p>   will be?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>What we are going to do is we are going to supplement further,</p>
<p>   in a quite a big way, the detoxification programmes. We are going</p>
<p>   to put more money into policing measures. We are going to certainly</p>
<p>   put more money in the way of the welfare sector organisations that</p>
<p>   provide rehabilitation programmes. We have a three-pronged approach:</p>
<p>   you give more resources to law enforcement; you give more resources</p>
<p>   to education and you give more resources to rehabilitation. We are</p>
<p>   strong enough to believe that trying to encourage the attitude of</p>
<p>   zero tolerance of drugs is a viable option in Australia. </p>
<p>We are not prepared to, sort of, surrender to this idea that you</p>
<p>   can never persuade people, in an absolute sense of the evil of drugs</p>
<p>   and we are going to continue to go down that path and it is really</p>
<p>   a very major announcement.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>Right. When you formulate and fashion these sorts of policies,</p>
<p>   this illegal drug attack on illegal drugs, do you talk to, as you</p>
<p>   John Howard, talk to say the customs people or the Federal Police.</p>
<p>   You see the Australian Federal Police Association says they are</p>
<p>   concerned at the lack of port surveillance. Now I am sure that you</p>
<p>   are aware that no one, for example, mans the port of Port Kembla</p>
<p>   after 5.00 pm on weekdays or at weekends. I mean it is open slather</p>
<p>   for people to just bring drugs into the country.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Alan, the answer to that is it is never possible no matter what</p>
<p>   resources you have or what government is in power to cover every</p>
<p>   single point of entry and it is well known that drug seizures normally</p>
<p>   occur, overwhelmingly occur as a result of tip-offs, as a result</p>
<p>   of intelligence and forward information and what we have done, both</p>
<p>   in the announcement I made last year - and it will be reinforced</p>
<p>   by the announcement today - is to increase the focus on our capacity</p>
<p>   to strengthen that forward intelligence and the capacity to get</p>
<p>   those tip-offs. In addition to that I will also be making some comments</p>
<p>   about physical resources as well.</p>
<p>The other answer to your question is in formulating a policy, I</p>
<p>   certainly talk to a lot of people. I will be announcing the membership</p>
<p>   of a national drug strategy group which will include a lot of people</p>
<p>   who are dealing at the very front line of this problem. And I think</p>
<p>   when you see the membership of that and particularly the chairman</p>
<p>   and deputy chairman of that body, you will have a very good idea</p>
<p>   of how serious we are about listening to the people who are right</p>
<p>   at the coal face of this horrendous problem.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>I know that you do listen and therefore can I just leave you with</p>
<p>   one statistic. I mean 300 customs officers were retrenched last</p>
<p>   year but the volume of shipping arriving in Australia has risen</p>
<p>   by 13 per cent. Now that doesn't add up. Those two statistics</p>
<p>   don't add up.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well it depends if you directly correlate the volume of shipping</p>
<p>   and the number of (inaudible) and assume that there are no productivity</p>
<p>   gains at all from technology, that there are no productivity gains</p>
<p>   from different methods of forward checking freight and cargo and</p>
<p>   of course there clearly are. You can't just make that kind</p>
<p>   of swap without making any allowance for that.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>OK, say something would you again, because you made a comment on</p>
<p>   Friday which I thought, a comment that needed to be made more often,</p>
<p>   about stay-at-home mothers and you condemned those, especially feminists</p>
<p>   who sneer at them. What was the reason for that?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>The point I was making Alan was simply this, that years ago if</p>
<p>   a mother went out to work because she had to, she was sometimes</p>
<p>   accused of neglecting her children. When the reality was that she</p>
<p>   had no alternative because her husband's income was so small</p>
<p>   that they needed the extra money to cover the mortgage. Now I thought</p>
<p>   that was grossly unfair. Equally now, when you have more and more</p>
<p>   women in the paid workforce it is equally unfair that when a mother,</p>
<p>   or father for that matter, elects to stay at home and provide full-time</p>
<p>   care for their children and their young, they tend to get sneered</p>
<p>   at and looked down upon and treated as second class citizens. And</p>
<p>   I think that is wrong, and the stridency of some of the ultra-feminist</p>
<p>   groups in the community who sort of really demand that every mother</p>
<p>   be back in the workforce as quickly as humanly possible, now that</p>
<p>   is ridiculous. I am for choice and if a mother or father chooses</p>
<p>   to be full-time at home to look after their children that is a choice</p>
<p>   that should both be respected and honoured and facilitated as much</p>
<p>   as possible by the taxation system. </p>
<p>And equally, if a family decides that for them the right thing</p>
<p>   to do is for both mum and dad to be in the workforce, or for one</p>
<p>   of them to be part-time and the other full-time, equally their choice</p>
<p>   should be respected and honoured and understood and facilitated,</p>
<p>   and let's have none of this sort of sorting out what is the</p>
<p>   right role for a woman. The right role for a woman is what the woman</p>
<p>   chooses to be her role, and it is for mothers and fathers to decide</p>
<p>   the best environment to raise their children, and I think governments</p>
<p>   and communities should respect those individual choices and should</p>
<p>   not seek to make moral judgments on them.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>But given that you have said in the past that the family is the</p>
<p>   best welfare unit known, and given that sometimes it's very</p>
<p>   difficult for mum and dad to provide enough income from one source,</p>
<p>   one worker, to be able to cover the obligations to the family, why</p>
<p>   wouldn't you actually consider making some of your $45 billion</p>
<p>   available to a significant home-makers allowance so that we can</p>
<p>   in fact give people a really viable choice about going home to look</p>
<p>   after their children?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well Alan I am, in concept, attracted to making the tax system</p>
<p>   better for families, let me make that very clear, and we did it</p>
<p>   with the family tax initiative and obviously it's something</p>
<p>   that will be under very careful focus as we put our tax policy together.</p>
<p>   We can't of course use the $45 billion, or whatever the figure</p>
<p>   turns out to be for that, because we only get that figure once.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>That's right. And you've got to make outlays.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>And I mean it would be plainly ridiculous to spend it on, because</p>
<p>   what would you do next year. People would think that was pretty</p>
<p>   cynical. You do get some ongoing saving because you no longer have</p>
<p>   to pay as much interest, but Alan, on the question of family tax</p>
<p>   policy, it is a key element of our approach that we want to make</p>
<p>   the tax system more supportive of families. I believe personally</p>
<p>   very strongly that people if they want one of the parents to be</p>
<p>   at home when children are young, either part-time or full-time,</p>
<p>   that to the maximum extent possible everybody who wants to do that</p>
<p>   ought to be able to do it and not just the well-off.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>OK. At the risk of flogging a dead horse Prime Minister, can I</p>
<p>   just repeat to you comments you yourself made on the Sunday programme</p>
<p>   on the first of March where you said, and I quote exactly: "Given</p>
<p>   the Australian experience and the Australian expectation, the best</p>
<p>   health system is to have what you might call the safety net of Medicare</p>
<p>   with a strong private component as well." However Michael Wooldridge</p>
<p>   said on the 12th of March, "..... let me make one point perfectly</p>
<p>   clear, we will retain Medicare in its entirety. We will ensure that</p>
<p>   patients are given the choice to be treated free as public patients,</p>
<p>   would ensure Australians have access to public hospitals on the</p>
<p>   basis of clinical need." Now surely on the one hand you can't</p>
<p>   have what the Prime Minister calls Medicare being a safety net and</p>
<p>   what the Health Minister calls on the other hand free-for-all.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I don't know that there's such a conflict Alan,</p>
<p>   and I don't think talking about health incidentally is flogging</p>
<p>   a dead horse, I think it's a very important issue and I want</p>
<p>   to see constant improvements and so forth for the health system.</p>
<p>   But I don't think you'd say something is completely free</p>
<p>   and I don't think Michael said it in this context when everybody's</p>
<p>   got to pay the Medicare levy. I mean, Medicare is only free in the</p>
<p>   sense that there is no fee charged when you get a treatment.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>But the perception by the public must be that they have access</p>
<p>   to free public hospitals otherwise they wouldn't be falling</p>
<p>   out of the private health care system to the extent that they are</p>
<p>   and making the uncontrolled demand on the public system such that's</p>
<p>   groaning under the weight of it.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well there are a combination of reasons for people dropping out</p>
<p>   of private health insurance. Unfortunately the thing was left neglected</p>
<p>   by the former government for too long so that when we got into office</p>
<p>   there had been a very, very big slide of people out. And our health,</p>
<p>   our tax incentives have stabilised that, but we obviously still</p>
<p>   have a lot of pressure on private health funds and ..</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>But shouldn't Medicare just be the genuine safety net for</p>
<p>   those who can't contribute to their own health funding needs,</p>
<p>   and you and I and the rest of us should be paying for ourselves.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>But hang on Alan you and I, let's face it mate, earn much</p>
<p>   higher incomes ...</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>Yeah, well we pay for ourselves.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes, but you and I are still in terms of incomes a relatively small</p>
<p>   minority in the community. The great bulk of people's incomes</p>
<p>   are in the low to modest level and you have to make.....</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>There's plenty of John Howards and Alan Jones going to the</p>
<p>   public hospital.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes I know, but they don't compose anywhere near ...</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>They're going to public hospitals.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I understand that point. I understand that point but you still</p>
<p>   have to have a system that people feel provides them with proper</p>
<p>   security. Now I'm not suggesting for a moment that the present</p>
<p>   system is perfect, it's not. But I do think the constant, I</p>
<p>   don't mean you but I mean more at a political level, the constant</p>
<p>   attacks that are made on it, it is still a better system than the</p>
<p>   American system or the British system. There's not a system</p>
<p>   in the world that can be named that is dramatically better than</p>
<p>   ours. I mean it's got a lot of faults but it's also a</p>
<p>   great deal better than any of the other systems on display around</p>
<p>   the world. It does need constant care and renovation and improvement</p>
<p>   I acknowledge that, and the government is constantly endeavouring</p>
<p>   to do so.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>OK. Good to talk to you and thank you for your time.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>OK Alan.</p>
