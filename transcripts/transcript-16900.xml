    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd, today signed a funding agreement with the University of Queensland that will see the people of the Brisbane Southside region benefit from a $7.5 million GP Super Clinic.</p>
<p>The University of Queensland in collaboration with Mater Health Services and Medihealth Meadowbrook will establish the GP Super Clinic under a hub and spoke model.</p>
<p>Two Super Clinic hubs will be established at Annerley and Logan with two complementary satellite sites still being negotiated for the broader Brisbane Southside region.</p>
<p>The Brisbane Southside GP Super Clinic will provide integrated, team-based health care tailored to the needs of the local community. Both Super Clinic hubs will provide three distinct streams:</p>
<p>     * A chronic disease management service;</p>
<p>     * A mental health service; and</p>
<p>     * A musculoskeletal pain and palliative care service.</p>
<p>Services will be bulk billed for concession card holders, children under 16 and those over 65.</p>
<p>The GP Super Clinic will have a strong focus on supporting the future primary care workforce. It is anticipated that student clinics will be incorporated as the GP Super Clinic develops, as part of educating future health professionals.</p>
<p>The signing of the funding agreement occurred at the Mater Hospital in Brisbane, where the Prime Minister and the Minister for Health and Aging Nicola Roxon met with local medical practitioners to hear their local priorities to improve the health system and discuss the recommendations of the National Health and Hospital Reform Commission.</p>
<p>The National Health and Hospitals Reform Commission report made recommendations for system-wide changes to Australian health care.</p>
<p>As part of the Government's health reforms to date, $275 million has been allocated over five years, from 2007-08, to establish 36 GP Super Clinics around the nation.</p>
<p>The first operational GP Super Clinic commenced at Ballan, Victoria, in mid-September and early services have commenced at five locations (Southern Lake Macquarie-Morisset, Palmerston, Devonport, Blue Mountains and Warnervale).</p>
<p>All Australians are also invited to contribute to the national debate on our health system via the yourHealth.gov.au website - and full copies of the reports can be found there. </p>
