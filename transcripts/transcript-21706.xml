    <content><![CDATA[<p>On behalf of all Australians I congratulate Pope Benedict XVI on assuming the throne of   St Peter.  He takes on the leadership of the Catholic Church at a very important time of both challenge and opportunity for Christianity around the world.</p>
<p>Following in the footsteps of Pope John Paul II, Pope Benedict XVI is also likely to reach out to people across faiths around the world.</p>
<p>On behalf of the Government and the people of Australia, Janette and I wish  Pope Benedict XVI well as he guides the Church in the years ahead.</p>
