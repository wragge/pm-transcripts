OFFICE OF THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
CANBERRA<br />
PROFESSOR FENNER'S AWARD<br />
A GREAT HONOUR FOR AUSTRALIAN SCIENCE<br />
Prime Minister Keating wrote last week in the following terms to Professor<br />
Frank Fenner AC, of the John Curtin School of Medical Research at the<br />
Australian National University, whose award of the Royal Society's Copley<br />
medal was announced in Britain on 11 July:<br />
" I was delighted to learn that you have been awarded the prestigious<br />
Copley medal by the Royal Society for your work at the John Curtin<br />
School of Medical Research in the Australian National University.<br />
This award is a great honour for you personally and a great honour for<br />
Australian science.<br />
Your work in virology and, particularly, your contribution to the global<br />
eradication of smallpox, have brought incalculable benefits to millions<br />
of people around the world. Your achievements in this field, through<br />
your work at the John Curtin School and in association with the World<br />
Health Organisation, will be remembered in the history of medical<br />
science. It i-s only fitting that the Royal Society has honoured you for it by<br />
adding your name to those of other great recipients of the Copley<br />
medal such as Benjamin Franklin, James Cook, Charles Darwin and<br />
our own MacFarlane Burnet.<br />
All Australians wilt join me in congratulating you on this great<br />
distinction."<br />
CANBERRA 14 July 1995 </p>
