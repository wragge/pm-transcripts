PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF NEWS CONFERENCE, PARLIAMENT HOUSE<br />
31 MAY 1989<br />
E 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
JOURNALIST: What's your reaction to the debt Prime<br />
Minister? PM: Well, there are a number of things I want to say about<br />
that and I want to of course get it into perspective.<br />
There'll be a lot of scaremongering undertaken by the<br />
policyless people opposite us, the Hewsons and the Peacocks<br />
and so on. Let's get the perspective right. Now firstly<br />
the net debt of Australia is over $ 100 billion, a very<br />
significant amount. In terms of the percentage of our Gross<br />
Domestic Product, somewhat lower than it was at this time<br />
last year, it's 31.7% of our Gross Domestic Product which<br />
compares with 32.4% of the GDP a year ago. Now, I think the<br />
thing that has to be understood is that the sort of<br />
scaremongering comparisons that are made by the opposition<br />
with certain third world countries are totally invalid<br />
they talk about comparisons with Argentina and Mexico. Of<br />
course in those cases the debt as a proportion of GDP is of<br />
the order of 70-80% and of course most of that debt, what is<br />
refered to as sovereign debt, were owed by the Governments<br />
of those countries. You have to look at the composition of<br />
the Australian debt. At the end of last year, which the<br />
last point for which the breakup is precisely available, 61%<br />
of that foreign debt was owed by the private sector, 61% by<br />
the private sector, 14% was by the State Governments and<br />
by Government authorities. The Commonwealth Government, the<br />
Federal Government has no net debt. Now that's got to be<br />
clearly understood as distinct from the sort of situations<br />
in these third world countries to which the opposition has<br />
such easy resort. The position here is the Federal<br />
Government, the Australian Government, has no net debt with<br />
the great majority of it being held in the private sector.<br />
of course what in fact the Commonwealth Government has been<br />
doing, by accumulating significant surpluses by three<br />
successive years, have run down in its own outlays, we've<br />
been able to accumulate a surplus and we've been using those<br />
surpluses to run down our debt, they've been used to pay off<br />
debt. Now, in respect of the private debt it's got to be<br />
understood that that's being used to finance new Australian<br />
investments both here and overseas. In respect to<br />
Australian investments abroad they of course generate income<br />
for Australia and the sort of movement over the last few<br />
years is important to understand. We're already receiving<br />
$ 2.6 billion in income from Australian investment overseas. </p>
<p>It's important to understand that's more than four times<br />
higher than the figure of three years ago, a four-fold<br />
increase in three years which is income coming to Australia<br />
as a result of Australian investment abroad. So the final<br />
general point that I want to make is to get an understanding<br />
of how the net indebtedness to which I refer, which is just<br />
over $ 100 billion, has in fact come about. What we've had<br />
is a situation where when we came to office in 1983 as you<br />
know the Australian economy was uncompetitive, it had<br />
actually shrunk, there'd been negative movement in our<br />
output the year before we came to office. The Australian<br />
economy was simply uncompetitive, inward-looking. What had<br />
to happen was there had to be a significant restructuring of<br />
the Australian economy to make it more competitive, to be<br />
able to take on the rest of the world both in terms of<br />
import substitution and in the growth of exports. There is<br />
no doubt if you look at the Australia of today as we go to<br />
the latter part of the decade and in 1989 the Australian<br />
economy is significantly more competitive. That has been in<br />
part as a result of the signficant success of wages policy<br />
which has involved an increase in competitiveness of the<br />
order of 10%. We've had a very significant reduction in<br />
real unit labour costs of the order of 10%. Associated with<br />
that we've had a fundamental restructuring in increase in<br />
investment. Investment is as you know now at a 40 year<br />
high, a 40 year high investment in this country. That<br />
investment that's been undertaken has been essential to<br />
improve the competitiveness of the Australian economy to put<br />
it into better shape to deal with the problems and<br />
challenges of the future. We are getting that investment<br />
now too quickly and I think some indication of the impact of<br />
these high levels of investment on our current account<br />
deficit should be understood. Let me illustrate it. If<br />
business investment were now the same proportion to GDP as<br />
it had been for the last 25 year average then instead of it<br />
being as it is now, two and a quarter points higher than<br />
that 25 year average, then the current account deficit that<br />
S we've got would be about $ 6 billion lower than in fact it<br />
is. So-when you take account of all those considerations<br />
you'll see how nonsensical it is for the scaremongering,<br />
Australia-downputting approach of the opposition. Their<br />
scaremongering, their attempt to write Australia off, to put<br />
it in the same category and league as Argentina and Mexico<br />
is both grossly inaccurate, betrays a fundamental<br />
misconception of the realities of the nature of our debt and<br />
its composition and is an approach which is totally against<br />
the best interests of this country. Any attempt to try and<br />
divide up this figure as they do and match it against each<br />
family in Australia and say each Australian family owes such<br />
and such an amount is a nonsense and a stupid and pernicious<br />
nonsense. The money is not owed by the Government of<br />
Australia in itself or on behalf of the people of Australia.<br />
overwhelmingly it is owed by the private sector and it is<br />
owed for the reasons and with the results to which I have<br />
referred. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, on the related question<br />
PM: Could I I'm sorry Peter could I make the point<br />
however that I'm not, having said all that and given the<br />
detailed exposition of the composition of the debt and the<br />
reasons for it, we're not saying that at that level it's not<br />
a problem and that it doesn't require Government action.<br />
But indeed the fact is of course, as I've said in the<br />
Parliament and publicly, other than in the Parliament, we<br />
are pursuing policies directed towards lowering the level of<br />
activity. Every relevant arm of policy is tight. Fiscal<br />
policy, as I explained yesterday in the Parliament, could<br />
not be tighter. It's tight in unparalleled terms, three<br />
successive years of reductions in real Government outlays.<br />
You've got a surplus for the second year in a row and<br />
there'll be a surplus next year and a public sector<br />
borrowing requirement of zero now and a public sector<br />
borrowing requirement in the next year which will be plus,<br />
in the best part of one per cent. So you've got tight<br />
fiscal policy, tight wages policy and tight monetary policy<br />
and those policies are beginning to have an effect, will<br />
have an effect, the effect which is necessary and that is of<br />
lowering somewhat the level of activity in this country so<br />
we won't be bringing in the same level of imports to go on<br />
in an unsustainable way building to debt from the level of<br />
activity in this country. So those things are in place<br />
because we recognise that the country can't go on having<br />
this imbalance between what it imports and what it exports.<br />
JOURNALIST: I just wonder how long do you think the<br />
electorate though is going to cop the political reality of<br />
those high interest rates? The tighter they are the longer<br />
it goes. How do you think you can wear that in electoral<br />
terms? PM: Let me say this. That if you were looking in the short<br />
term electoral perspectives, I suppose the implication of<br />
your question not that you're putting it but certainly<br />
the implication of what's been put by the Opposition, is<br />
that we would become economically irresponsible, abandon<br />
tight monetary policy. My judgement of the Australian<br />
people is a more sophisticated one than I think that it is<br />
of others, including the Opposition. I don't believe<br />
provided that we expound the analysis in the way I have and<br />
the way my other Ministers will do, I don't believe that the<br />
Australian people would expect us to become irresponsible in<br />
the conduct of policy because the simple fact, the simple<br />
irrefutable fact is that if we were to loosen policy then we<br />
would unleash upon the Australian economy an infinitely<br />
worse and, in a sense, irrecoverable situation. It would be<br />
short term economic lunacy and in political terms it would<br />
in my judgement also be political lunacy because the people<br />
would not in my judgement buy that sort of situation. Now<br />
the Australian people are entitled obviously to expect from<br />
governments or alternatives governments an exposition of<br />
what they are doing to deal with the economic realities and<br />
problems which the country faces. There is a clear choice<br />
in the judgement for them to make. They are faced with an </p>
<p>-4-<br />
PM ( cont): Australian Government the Hawke Labor<br />
Government which as a result of the policies it's pursued<br />
has brought about unparalleled employment growth and I<br />
remind you of the 1.4 million jobs which is reflected in<br />
the fact that the unemployment level of more than 10% that<br />
we inherited has been dramatically reduced, a reduction of<br />
inflation from the double digit figure that we reduced to<br />
less than 7% and trending down, and a situation now where<br />
there has been a response from the business sector which we<br />
welcome, to the call that we were making for a restructuring<br />
of the Australian economy. The massive investment 40 year<br />
high levels. Now OK the right things have been done which<br />
have been reflected in great employment outcomes, much<br />
better inflation outcomes, but now reaching a point where<br />
there has to be moderation. Now they'll make the judgement<br />
as to whether we've got the policies which can bring us out<br />
of that boom situation to what is referred to as a soft<br />
landing that is put it in non-technical terms, a situation<br />
where growth can be lowered but still maintained so that<br />
economic growth will go on and employment growth will<br />
continue. Now our policies are there, we've demonstrated as<br />
I said in the Parliament yesterday, in ' 85-86 that we can do<br />
that. We came out of that problem period still with<br />
economic growth and still with employment growth. Now we<br />
can show that we can do that. Now against that what's the<br />
alternative? The alternative is an opposition which hasn't<br />
learned anything in the 19801s. You would think they had<br />
been in some time warp, some cocoon where they had been<br />
impossible, it had been impossible for them to learn<br />
anything. Because what are they suggesting? They are<br />
suggesting that there will be or let me interpolate on<br />
myself because when I say they are suggesting, there is<br />
not one voice and I'll come to that in a moment but what<br />
they are saying is that they will slash the public sector<br />
more that's what Hewson says but then the other<br />
frontbench spokesman said, ' not on your nellie you won't,<br />
you haven't talked to us'. You can get up and make your<br />
autonomous statements about cutting expenditure but we won't<br />
let you. So as far as you can see they may be talking about<br />
cutting expenditure. They are talking about a wages free<br />
for all and there is their greatest Achilles heel. Because<br />
if we're going to learn from the 1980' s as I said in the<br />
Parliament yesterday, you look at the two periods. In 1981<br />
with the absence of a wages policy, wages explosion and the<br />
economy falls apart. Under Labor the problems of 85-86,<br />
relevant policies including wages policy, a soft landing.<br />
So I'm sorry it's a long answer to your question Peter but<br />
it's important. You're saying will the electorate cop this?<br />
They don't like what's happening and I don't like having<br />
interest rates longer for one day necessary, longer for one<br />
day than is necessary. But I know that if we didn't have<br />
them there we'd be doing a greater disservice to the<br />
Australian public.<br />
JOURNALIST: Today the Australian expert at Salomon Bothers<br />
in New York said there was a 25% chance in his opinion that<br />
Australia could go into recession next year. Are those odds<br />
too high in your opinion and if not why not? </p>
<p>PM: I think the odds are not as high as that. Let me put<br />
that comment into this background. The OECD has released<br />
its assessment of what's going to happen in the OECD this<br />
year and next year. Their assessment is that economic<br />
growth in 1989 will be 3.25% and in 1990 next year 2.75%,<br />
that is for the OECD area as a whole. In other words what<br />
the OECD is predicting is a pattern of continued strong but<br />
somewhat lesser economic growth and any reasonable<br />
assessment which, may I say has been made by everyone other<br />
than Moody's it seems to me, is that Australia will be part<br />
of that pattern.<br />
JOURNALIST: Are we approaching the point Mr Hawke, where<br />
the level of private debt within the total is beginning to<br />
harm Australia's credit worthiness?<br />
PM: Well on the question of Australia's credit worthiness,<br />
I mean I don't want to go through all the references, I<br />
don't want to take up your time or mine because I've got a<br />
function out the front in 5 or 10 minutes. But you are<br />
aware of the statements that have been made by everyone<br />
virtually other than Moody's; Salomons, Standard and Poors,<br />
the Australian Rating Agency and so on, I mean Moody's is<br />
one out in their assessment. Now as far as the private<br />
sector is concerned they are making their judgements about<br />
their investments in terms of their capacity to finance<br />
their investments and no reason to believe that basically<br />
those judgements are not going to be vindicated. I remind<br />
you of what I said about the very significant level of<br />
income flow to Australia now from those investments<br />
fourfold increase in the past three years. But having said<br />
all that I don't want to leave and I hope in nothing that<br />
I've said to this point, have I left a sense of complacency<br />
because the simple fact is that with the accumulation of<br />
that debt then there is the repayment of interest involved<br />
and that in itself is an inbuilt problem and that's why we<br />
are directing all the attention we can to getting the<br />
balance in the area of trade so that we are able to have a<br />
lower level of imports which we can finance by our exports.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, given this current situation<br />
and the need to correct it<br />
PM: Yes.<br />
JOURNALIST: Can the Australian people still expect the rise<br />
in living standards you've consistently promised this last<br />
year? PM: I believe they can expect what I said and that is, you<br />
will remember I put a maintenance and then through time a<br />
gradual improvement of standards. Of course, what you've<br />
got to understand, given the Australian context, is that the<br />
way we're going about that is the only way it can be done.<br />
I mean you can't, if you are going to analyse and understand<br />
what is proper policy making in Australia, forget your<br />
history. I can't emphasise too strongly the relevance of<br />
the graph in Attachment A to the Treasurer's April Statement </p>
<p>-6-<br />
PM ( cont): because the history is there encapsulated in one<br />
page. The history of Australia shows in the past that<br />
you've had, where you have the booming economic condition as<br />
measured as the graph does, either by overtime or capital<br />
utilisation. You've had wages going up with it, the wages<br />
explosion and the inevitable breakdown recession following<br />
it. Now what we've got now is a wages policy which will mean<br />
remarkably a six and a half percent wages outcome, that has<br />
been possible because of the tax decisions that we've made<br />
and a combination of those wage decisions and the tax<br />
decision will mean a maintenance and gradual improvement of<br />
standards and a situation, we believe, which together with<br />
our other arms of policy being tight as they are, fiscally<br />
and monetarily, a reduction in the external problem that we<br />
have to address.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, that original statement suggested the<br />
maintenance of living standards this year and an increase in<br />
real living standards next year, is that still possible?<br />
PM: I think on the scenario I've put, yes.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, on another subject, should<br />
Australia even be considering an extradition request from a<br />
country, from Chile, given that country's rather appalling<br />
record on human rights and lack of judicial propriety in the<br />
past? PM: We have expressed consistently, not only in regard to<br />
Chile but universally, we have no geographical<br />
discrimination as distinct from the Opposition. We have no<br />
geographical discrimination when it comes to the<br />
condemnation of human rights abuses. our condemnation of<br />
human rights abuses applies whether it is Chile, South<br />
Africa, the Soviet Union or wherever and no Government, I<br />
think, has done more both generally and through Amnesty to<br />
identify itself with condemnation of the abuse of human<br />
rights. Coming particularly to Buschmann, we're examining<br />
that position. Let me make these points about it. Firstly,<br />
if a request for extradition were based upon an allegedly<br />
political offence or in regard to one where there was<br />
capital punishment, extradition would not be granted. I<br />
understand in regard to Buschmann there is some question<br />
been raised about the regularity of his visa application for<br />
entry to Australia. That is being looked at. of course if<br />
it was an irregular visa entry that he made then he would<br />
not be allowed to stay in Australia. But that's not<br />
extradition. Our attitude on extradition will be governed<br />
by the considerations that I've just referred to.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime minister, do you accept the alliance<br />
between Labor and the Greens in Tasmania or do you consider<br />
it could be politically risky?<br />
PM: well I accept it. Well, it's not really in a sense<br />
JOURNALIST: Do you welcome it? </p>
<p>PM: Lab Green is better than Gray.<br />
JOURNALIST: ( inaudible)<br />
PM4: I haven't finished. The position there is that I<br />
believe that the Governor and I hope that this is not said<br />
gratuitously I believe the Governor has acted<br />
appropriately. That capacity of Mr Gray to govern will be<br />
tested when the Parliament resumes on the 28th. I believe<br />
that the Accord that has been struck between the Labor Party<br />
and the Independents will stick, therefore that means that<br />
they can form a Government after Mr Gray has been tested on<br />
the floor of the Parliament. From my understanding I think<br />
the Accord that has been reached is a) relevant, and b)<br />
workable. So I think the people of Tasmania are in for a<br />
distinct improvement in Government.<br />
JOURNALIST: Do you think IMF and the OECD would agree with<br />
Moody's that the pace of economic adjustment will be stepped<br />
up PM: Well, I just go back to what I said before, you go to<br />
Moody's. I mean, why all of a sudden are we, as distinct<br />
from everyone else, hanging on Moody's and Moody's alone?<br />
Moody's are one out in their assessment. In terms of the<br />
pace of adjustment I think we are entitled to say ' look at<br />
the record in six years'. We have been prepared to make<br />
adjustments, that we're not hidebound by some commitment to<br />
there is the Budget day, you don't do anything through the<br />
year except on Budget day. We have consistently been<br />
adaptable and responsive in the making of economic policy.<br />
Let me remind you, we're still in the month of May, earlier<br />
in this month we took $ 2.7 billion off the States and the<br />
public authorities and when you take account of $ 360 million<br />
just last month on ours, there's a $ 3 billion decision in<br />
terms of taking off from the area of public demand and<br />
public call upon savings. That's what we've done within the<br />
last month. So that is also in the context where we've<br />
delivered also on the wages tax deal. Also within the last<br />
month there's been a tightening of monetary policy. Anyone<br />
who suggests or implies that the Government is not<br />
progressively moving to tighten, and tighten policy and make<br />
relevant decisions, is either dumb to the nth degree, asleep<br />
or politically malicious. Now you can apply whichever one<br />
of those you want to who's ever making the statements.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, what do you think about the idea of a<br />
merger or joint venture between Ansett and Qantas and do you<br />
think the way the work of the Committee on the two airlines<br />
has become bogged down signals that that issue is off the<br />
agenda until<br />
PM: Well, let me just say in regard to this suggestion I've<br />
seen about a merger between Qantas and Ansett, it's a<br />
fascinating one which hadn't occurred to me, I think hadn't<br />
occurred to very many other people. I don't think, if I may<br />
put it that way, that it's necessarily got a lot of legs<br />
the important thing or wings, but let me say that what we </p>
<p>-8-<br />
PM ( cont): are serious about is looking at how our public<br />
enterprises are going to be able to function in the public<br />
interest. That's what we've got to determine and I'm quite<br />
happy about the way the processes of examination are going.<br />
ends </p>
