    <content><![CDATA[<p>I am pleased to announce the membership of the Prime Ministerâs Indigenous Advisory Council.</p>
<p>I want a new engagement with Aboriginal people to be one of the hallmarks of my Government and the Prime Ministerâs Indigenous Advisory Council is an important part of that.</p>
<p>The Council will be chaired by Mr Warren Mundine. Joining him will be a mix of leaders with a broad range of skills and experience, including in business and the public sector.</p>
<p>The Councilâs membership is:</p>
<ul><li>Mr Warren Mundine (Chair)</li>
<li>Mr Richard Ah Mat</li>
<li>Ms Leah Armstrong</li>
<li>Dr Ngiare Brown</li>
<li>Ms Josephine Cashman</li>
<li>Ms Gail Kelly</li>
<li>Mr Djambawa Marawili AM</li>
<li>Mr Bruce Martin</li>
<li>Mr David Peever</li>
<li>Mr Andrew Penfold</li>
<li>Professor Peter Shergold AC</li>
<li>Mr Daniel Tucker</li>
</ul><p>A short list of biographies is attached.</p>
<p>In choosing the members, the Minister for Indigenous Affairs Senator the Hon Nigel Scullion, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister the Hon Alan Tudge MP, Mr Mundine and I considered both indigenous and non-indigenous Australians from all parts of Australia.</p>
<p>The Council brings a diversity of views and experience to the task of ensuring our programmes achieve real, positive change in the lives of Aboriginal people â changes that can increase participation, preserve Aboriginal culture and build reconciliation.</p>
<p>To do this we must ensure that children go to school, adults go to work and that the ordinary law of the land operates in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities.</p>
<p>The Council will meet three times a year with the Prime Minister and senior ministers and will inform the policy implementation of the Government.</p>
<p>I look forward to working with the Indigenous Advisory Council to deliver practical change for the better.</p>
