ij AUSTRALIA JL<br />
FOR MEDIA 12 November 1985<br />
Operation Noah a national phone-in campaign against drugs to<br />
be held in all States and Territories on Wednesday 13 November<br />
deserves the support of all Australians.<br />
As part of the National Campaign against Drug Abuse, the Federal<br />
Government is providing extra resources to law enforcement<br />
agencies. But to be fully effective, our law enforcement agencies need the<br />
support of the community.<br />
That is where Operation Noah comes in.<br />
operation Noah is a community-based approach to the drug menace.<br />
It will be the biggest campaign ever mounted against illegal<br />
drugs in Australia and will be directed particularly at major<br />
traffickers in hard drugs.<br />
As well as attacking those who traffic in illegal drugs,<br />
Operation Noah in most states is designed to provide confidential<br />
help and assistance to those who are using drugs, their friends<br />
or relatives.<br />
On Operation Noah day, it will be possible to phone drug<br />
counsellors and speak with them confidentially.<br />
Anyone with information about trafficking in drugs which would<br />
assist our law enforcement agencies, or anyone requiring help or<br />
advice about his or her own drug problem or that of a friend or<br />
family member, should call the advertised numbers for their State<br />
or Territory.<br />
The traffic in illegal drugs causes great misery in our<br />
community. operation Noah offers a potent method of attacking this problem.<br />
I ask all Australians to support operation Noah and help make it<br />
a success. </p>
<p>OPERATION NOAH VIDEO<br />
Of all the issues that face Australia at present probably no<br />
other has such broad support as the fight against the drug menace.<br />
Earlier this year, my Government convened a special Premiers,<br />
Conference to discuss what Federal and State Governments could do<br />
together to combat this evil.<br />
As a result we have launched a national campaign against drug<br />
abuse as a cooperative effort among governments.<br />
The major emphasis of the campaign is on reducing the demand for<br />
drugs through education, treatment and rehabilitation programs.<br />
But this emphasis on reducing demand has to be matched with an<br />
effort to control supply, through law enforcement methods.<br />
To be fully effective, our law enforcement agencies need the<br />
support of the community. That is where Operation Noah comes in.<br />
Operation Noah is a phone-in campaign directed against the<br />
illegal drugs trade.<br />
It will be held in all States and Territories on Wednesday 13<br />
November. Operation Noah represents a community-based approach to the drug<br />
menace and will be the biggest campaign ever mounted against<br />
illegal drugs in Australia.<br />
It will be directed particularly at major traffickers in hard<br />
drugs. If you have information relating to the importation, distribution<br />
or sale of illegal drugs, you should call the appropriate<br />
telephone numbers for your State or Territory on Operation Noah<br />
day, Wednesday 13 November, between 9.00 in the morning and 9.00<br />
in the evening.<br />
As well as its law enforcement aspect, Operation Noah is also<br />
designed to offer help to drug users and their friends and<br />
families. On Operation Noah day, experienced drug counsellors will be<br />
available to speak with drug dependent people or their friends<br />
and families.<br />
They will be able to provide confidential guidance or advice to<br />
anyone who phones them.<br />
If you have information about trafficking in d rugs which would<br />
assist our law enforcement agencies, or if you require help or<br />
advice about your own drug problem or that of a friend or family<br />
member, I urge you to call the advertised numbers for your State<br />
or Territory.<br />
The traffic in illegal drugs causes great misery in our<br />
community. Operation Noah offers a potent method of attacking<br />
this problem.<br />
I ask you to support Operation Noah and help make it a success. </p>
