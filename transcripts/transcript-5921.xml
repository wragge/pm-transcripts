PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MED IA SUNDAY, 26 SEPTEMBER 1982<br />
MARIONETTETHEATRE, SYDNEY<br />
I am very happy to be here with Tamie in support of this<br />
appeal to raise as I understand about $ 700,000 for the<br />
renovation of an old building next door the major part of which<br />
is something considerably over 100 years old. Turning what<br />
used to be a very bare and rudimentary sailors' home when it<br />
was first constructed into a marionette theatre which will<br />
serve this part of Sydney and Australia for a very long, long<br />
while ) is I think an imaginative project indeed.<br />
I have had a quick look over the old building and there i~ s a<br />
photograph of it, a large one and an old one in the foyer<br />
which showed the simplicity of the design and the proportions<br />
which could hardly be bettered. I think one of the quite<br />
remarkable changes that has occurred over Australia over the<br />
last ten maybe fifteen years at the most, is an enormous<br />
change of attitude to parts of Australia's early history.<br />
We want to preserve, we want to conserve and that is evident<br />
in many different ways in the views we have towards old buildings<br />
which are very much part of our past. Whnether it is in relation<br />
to part of the Rocks area in Sydney or parts of Melbourne or<br />
parts of the Australian countryside that we want to get despoiled,<br />
the attitude of Australians now is one in which we all realise<br />
very greatly that there is much in a relatively brief past of<br />
something less than a couple of hundred years. There is much<br />
in that that we want to keep, that we want to conserve and that<br />
we want to improve so that people in the future can enjoy it.<br />
Conservation by itself is just one thing. I t has not necessarily<br />
got a great deal of point to it, unless conservation leads to<br />
something that people can enjoy, experience and in many cases<br />
use to a very useful purpose. Here we are going to have the<br />
renovation and internally pulling around a bit, an old building<br />
that is something to conserve, but something that is going<br />
to provide a very great deal of enjoyment and a permanent for<br />
the Marionette for as long as time may last. I think the<br />
putting together of these two objectives is very, very<br />
worthwhile. T am sorry that we are only being given two very brief glimpses<br />
of what can happen. I can think of all sorts of possibilities.<br />
I think if there was a little time given, we really could have<br />
had a show put on which could have been relevant and pertinent<br />
and all sorts of things.. Whether it was Carlton winning at the<br />
/ 2 </p>
<p>-2<br />
football or Parliament last week or Parramatta maybe winning<br />
today, the possibilities would seem to be endless. It is<br />
an art form which Australians have devoted a great deal of time<br />
a great deal of attention and care and have shown a great deal<br />
of skill not only no doubt because they themselves get a good<br />
deal of satisfaction from the profession, but because they give<br />
a very great deal of pleasure to a very large number of<br />
Australians and it is important that all of this be encouraged.<br />
It would be very easy for people to just sit back and say there<br />
are a couple of governments, there is local government and<br />
there are State governments and Federal governments and one<br />
of them can do it. That also is an attitude which I sometimes<br />
think has been too evident. Certainly governments have a role.<br />
All governments now support the arts and different art forms<br />
very substantially. But if the artistic world had to rely<br />
on governments alone for the support of art, I think that in<br />
itself can tend to be stultifying and narrowing.<br />
In some countries overseas where the support of the artistic<br />
world and artistic endeavour is entirely in the hands of government.<br />
If you don't perform the way those governments want in the<br />
proper revolutionary manner, then your work is condemned. One<br />
of the garantors of freedom of artistic expression comes from<br />
the fact that art, literature can be sponsored and supported<br />
from a variety of sources, from governments, from the private<br />
sector, from state governments, the Commonwealth and at times<br />
also from local government. The fact that the arts are supported<br />
in Australia in a variety of sources I think is something much<br />
to be commended. It is one of the guarantors of freedom of<br />
artistic expression and that obviously is enormously important<br />
in a country like Australia.<br />
If Australia has been a little behind over the years in the<br />
past in terms of public support for the arts, compared with<br />
some European countries I think maybe it was, not now. I think<br />
still it might be a little behind some other countries in<br />
terms of public and corporate support for the arts in its<br />
different forms. I am delighted that over the last several<br />
years there are many people in the private enterprise world<br />
who are coming to realise to a greater and greater extent<br />
that they also have a role to play in relation to this and<br />
while the role can be an altruistic one, I think that there<br />
is also a self-purpose served and a very good self purpose<br />
served in terms of the wider public reputation of the<br />
corporation that support this kind of activity.<br />
I have very much that the appeal for funds is going to be<br />
thoroughly successful and I have got no doubt that if it is<br />
over-subscribed the funds will still be very well spent. But<br />
the purpose is a very worthwhile one and I am delighted and<br />
Tamie is delighted to have been asked here this afternoon to<br />
lend what support we personally can to this interesting and<br />
important endeavour. I would like to wish those concerned,<br />
Sir Charles Moses and everyone else all good fortune in what<br />
is being attempted because I think it is something of real<br />
value and I am sure it is going to not only preserve an important<br />
old building, but it is going to give a very great deal of<br />
pleasure to tens upon thousands of people and many of them<br />
young Australians down through the years. The best of luck<br />
and may the money roll in. </p>
