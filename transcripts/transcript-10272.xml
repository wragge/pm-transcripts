13 March 1997 TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
THE HON JOHN HOWARD MP<br />
DOORSTOP SYDNEY<br />
E O E<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister looking at your political family you would have heard the comments Mr<br />
Kennett made about real jobs and ' work for the dole' not necessarily being related<br />
what's your response?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well I haven't seen those comments. But I've been told that he's proposing some<br />
parallel thing that would involve the private sector. I'm prepared to look at positively<br />
at any positive proposals in this area. My understanding is that he's quite supportive<br />
of the ' work for the dole' proposition but he's got some additional ideas. Now I<br />
welcome additional ideas from any Premier which will help us tackle this very difficult<br />
problem and a problem that's going to take a long time to solve.<br />
JOURNALIST: ( Inaudible) he seems to be suggesting a breakaway ( inaudible) Commonwealth<br />
scheme. Was that part of the problem ( inaudible)<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Oh look, there's no question of any breakaway by anybody. The Commonwealth has<br />
nationwide responsibility for matters relating to unemployment benefits. They are<br />
Commonwealth benefits, they're not State benefits and the question of a breakaway<br />
State scheme simply doesn't come in to it. But if he's got some additional proposals<br />
to help tackle the problem I'm delighted to look at it and I welcome it. And I know his<br />
very strong commitment to reducing unemployment in Australia but we have<br />
responsibility for unemployment benefits and there's no such thing as a breakaway<br />
State unemployment benefit scheme, that's just not possible. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Well would it be possible to have a ( inaudible) Victoria trying a different scheme in<br />
conjunction with the...<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Look, it is possible to tackle this matter on many fronts and I'm quite certain that the<br />
Victorian Premier wants to work cooperatively with the Federal Government.<br />
JOURNALIST: Have you seen the latest jobless figures which are due out today?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
They're not out yet. The figures are coming out at 11.30Oam.<br />
JOURNALIST: Just on reducing unemployment overall you've said we need growth at more than 4%.<br />
Now, the projections are for around What can be done in the course of this<br />
Government to try to get 4% growth?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well there are a number of things we've already done which, over time, ought to lift<br />
economic growth. We've changed the industrial system. Business investment is<br />
running at a historically high level. We have very low interest rates historically and we<br />
have very low rates of inflation. Now all of those things are benign and positive for<br />
economic growth. It has always been the case that the way you create more jobs is<br />
overwhelmingly to have more economic growth. There's nothing revolutionary about<br />
that as a statement of economic reality. It's been self evident for years. When you<br />
have a recession it's because you have no economic growth and your jobless rate goes<br />
up. And we do need to promote faster and stronger sustainable economic growth in<br />
Australia. We also need to clear away the obstructions to job creation, that's why<br />
we've reformed the industrial relations system. We need to give particular incentives<br />
to small business.<br />
JOURNALIST: ( Inaudible)<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well we anticipate this year All of the indications at the moment are that that<br />
will be achieved and I'm simply making the point that to make a big impact on the<br />
unemployment rate you do need to grow the economy at a faster rate.<br />
Thank you. </p>
