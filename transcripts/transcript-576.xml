STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
( RIGHT HONOURABLE R. G. . MENZIES, QC.. M. P.)<br />
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES<br />
THURSDAY, 9th AUGUST. 1962.<br />
COMMON MARKET NEGOTIATIONS<br />
In my four weeks' absence abroad, I conducted close discussions<br />
on the Common Market problem in both the United Kingdom and the United<br />
States. I did this by way of following up the invaluable work done by<br />
Mr. McEwen in the course of his strenuous and far-reaching journey.<br />
In London, I had a series of talks with the Prime Minister<br />
and with Lord Home, Mr. Butler, Mr, Sandys and Mr. Heath. In Washington,<br />
President Kennedy, Mr. Rusk, Mr. Harriman and Mr. Ball all found considerable<br />
time for an examination of our mutual problems. I was able to<br />
leave each place with a strong feeling that Australia's case was not only<br />
understood but was receiving very close consideration.<br />
I felt that this was important, because it must always be<br />
remembered that in the negotiations now proceeding on Great Britain's<br />
application to accede to the Treaty of Rome and become a member of the<br />
European Economic Community, we are not a party principal and must therefore<br />
do what we can to impress our views, directly and indirectly, upon<br />
the actual negotiators and upon those whose views may influence their<br />
ultimate decisions. Just as I arrived in England, an announcement was made by<br />
the press that an agreement had been arrived at in relation to " hard<br />
manufactures", under which existing Commonwealth preferences were to be<br />
" tphased out" by 1970, when the Common Market arrangements are designed<br />
to reach maturity. Although the exports of both New Zealand and<br />
Australia in this field are intrinsically limited, Mr. Marshall of New<br />
Zealand and I had a discussion and issued a joint statement in which we<br />
said that British entry should not be on terms which resulted in critical<br />
damage to our economies and the impairment of Commonwealth relations.<br />
We recalled that the British Government had repeatedly given assurances<br />
that it would not feel able to join unless Commonwealth interests were<br />
safeguarded. We said that these assurances were of vital importance<br />
in the current negotiations. </p>
<p>2<br />
We said that, notwithstanding this, neither Australia nor<br />
New Zealand could be indifferent to some recent developments in the<br />
negotiations. Although no doubt the outcome of this week's discussion<br />
on industrial products would come under examination at the Commonwealth<br />
Prime Minister's Conference, it none the less represented a disturbing<br />
development. It fell far short of providingadequate safeguards for<br />
Commonwealth trade in the products concerned. Even more important, of<br />
course, it must not under any circumstances be taken as a pattern for the<br />
type of settlement which might be reached on other products of even greater<br />
concern to Australia and New Zealand.<br />
This statement attracted considerable public attention.<br />
I then pursued the matter of the nature of any " Agreement"<br />
between Great Britain and the Six. Discussions-with British Ministers<br />
made it clear that, until the meeting of Prime Ministers was held, all.<br />
such arrangements as that announced in relation to " hard manufactures"<br />
would be tentative only; that they'were not binding; that they<br />
represented what Great Britain and the Six felt was a feasible basis<br />
of agreement; and that when finally the ground had been covered there<br />
would emerge a package of such feasible arrangements which the Prime<br />
Ministers would be able to discuss without prejudice and without prior<br />
commitment. The second question, that of the phasing out of preferential<br />
arrangements by 1970, was, of course, vastly important, and occupied much<br />
of my time. This phasing out principle has been referred to in many<br />
official messages and records as " decalage", a French word meaning " a<br />
shifting of the zero", or what we would call for the present purpose a<br />
gradual reduction to the point of extinction. When in London I noted<br />
with interest that the " Times" printed it " dIcollage", meaning in one<br />
sense a beheading. We have made it clear that to dispose of the Commonwealth<br />
issue by steady reduction of our existing arrangements without in<br />
some other way preserving our market opportunities, until termination in<br />
1970, would be grievously unsatisfactory to us. It is true that our<br />
current trade treaty with Great Britain has a terminating or terminable<br />
date; that our current meat agreement is for a term of years; that the<br />
Commonwealth Sugar Agreement runs until 1969; and so on. But the point<br />
which we have been making is that, whatever the dates may be, there has<br />
for very many years been an expectation and intention that preferential<br />
arrangements of an appropriate kind would continue, just as it has been<br />
contemplated that a British preferential tariff on British goods passing<br />
into Australia would continue.<br />
advocacy. We have not been blindly obstinate or unreasonable in our<br />
We have, in fact, recognised throughout that the present </p>
<p>3<br />
members of the Common Market were not likely in 1962 ( whatever might have<br />
been the position when the Treaty of Rome was in process of negotiation),<br />
to accept the entry of a Great Britain carrying with her the existing<br />
structure of Commonwealth preferences. We have therefore proposed and<br />
sought some alternative course which would secure for us the substance of<br />
maintained and expanded access to an enlarged European Common Market while<br />
not requiring the continuance of the strict letter of what I will call<br />
" the old law". Without going into burdensome detail, I may illustrate our<br />
approach by two examples.<br />
For some commodities we suggested that we should be given, on<br />
the basis of our trade with Great Britain, " comparable outlets" into the<br />
enlarged European Market. This means that we should be given a preferential<br />
tariff quota which would apply to the whole of that Market, but be<br />
based upon the normal amount of our existing sales to Great Britain, plus<br />
an agreed factor of normal growth. In the result, each European country<br />
of the Six would enjoy the same cost advantage as Great Britain, up to a<br />
point where the total imports of that commodity from Australia reached<br />
the agreed quota. After that, our exports of that commodity would have<br />
to meet the Common External Tariff.<br />
In some other commodities we felt that the right answer was<br />
to make world agreements, pending the negotiation of which our current<br />
rights should continue.<br />
There were and are many variations on these two themes which<br />
involve technical procedures which I could not hope to cover in a statement<br />
which is designed to explain the issues broadly and concisely.<br />
With these preliminaries, I now proceed to explain, as<br />
objectively as possible, the nature of the two great problems which<br />
engaged my attention. The first involved some examination of what I will call the<br />
political issues involved for Great Britain and the Commonwealth.<br />
Although, as we know, political issues embrace economic issues very<br />
closely, I am here using the expression " political" as distinguishing<br />
such matters as foreign policy and the concerting of external policies,<br />
and putting the economic issues, somewhat artificially, in a separate<br />
category. This distinction is by no means precise, since there are in<br />
and under the Treaty of Rome provisions which could limit the normal<br />
political and legislative discretion of a British Parliament in relation<br />
to economic and social matters. </p>
<p>4<br />
But, in spite of some confusion and overlapping of ideas,<br />
the making of the broad distinction will facilitate the presentation<br />
of the record to the House.<br />
I will begin with the political considerations.<br />
POLITICAL 1. The British Cabinet clearly is impressed by what it believes<br />
to be the political advantages for Great Britain, Europe, and the Western<br />
World which would flow from British membership of the European Economic<br />
Community. Mr. Macmillan made this clear in our discussions. I think<br />
it fair to say that his views on this matter seem to be fully shared by<br />
President Kennedy. The basis of this belief is a feeling that the old Balance<br />
of Power policy with Great Britain standing outside Europe is no<br />
longer possible in modern circumstances and has been falsified twice in<br />
this century; that the measure of European co-operation already achieved<br />
under the Treaty of Rome is already notable, and will grow more rapidly<br />
with British participation; that Great Britain, as a member of the<br />
European Community could exercise substantial influence in the direction<br />
of outward looking policies and positive resistance to the Communist<br />
menace. We understand and respect these views, but we have never<br />
assumed nor offered to sit in judgment on them. They clearly involve<br />
a choice, a most historic and far-reaching choice, to be made by Great<br />
Britain herself. If the choice is made in favour of entry, the<br />
political effect upon Australia and other Commonwealth countries, indeed<br />
upon the Commonwealth itself, will materially depend upon the nature of<br />
the political arrangements which develop inside the extended European<br />
Community. Primarily, the Treaty of Rome provides for permanent close<br />
economic association between its members, with, for example, common<br />
agricultural policies, a free movement of people and capital, the<br />
harmonisation of social policies, and the creation of institutions such<br />
as an Assembly, a Council, a Commission an executive body a Court,<br />
and a European Investment Bank.<br />
The political implications of the economic association are<br />
visible, but not easy to define. But, as I pointed out to this House<br />
a year ago, the preamble to the Treaty of Rome stated that the signatories<br />
were " determined to establish the foundations of an ever closer union<br />
among European peoples". </p>
<p>The British Government has given much thought to this great<br />
question; it sees world advantages in involving Great Britain in European<br />
political associations of a permanent kind. We have never questioned the<br />
sincerity of its view, or the possibility of those advantages. Indeed,<br />
in a joint statement by President Kennedy and myself to which I will<br />
direct attention at a later stage we said that we both " recognised that<br />
European unity could contribute substantially to the strength of the free<br />
world". From a Commonwealth point of view, I have taken every<br />
opportunity to point out that a great deal turns upon the nature of the<br />
proposed political ( including constitutional) association. This question<br />
has given rise to much political debate both in and out of the British<br />
Parliament. There is a wide range of possibilities, from regular conferences<br />
of leaders and Ministers at one end of the scale ( an ad hoc<br />
rather than a structural association) to a full-blooded European Federation<br />
at the other. I gathered in Whitehall that Great Britain does not contemplate<br />
the creation of supra-national institutions of government, with<br />
their consequential clear modifications of political sovereignty. There<br />
would appear to be some division of opinion among the Six themselves on<br />
this matter. But it does seem that, to take a single example, the right,<br />
under the Treaty, to the free movement of workers between the Member<br />
States can readily generate political pressures for organic political<br />
association. Many Europeans have already moved from one Member State<br />
to another. Subject to the power of national histories and traditions<br />
and prejudices ( a power which can easily be under-estimated), national<br />
lines will tend to become blurred. If these processes now going on<br />
under the Treaty operated to reduce the possibilities of intra-Western<br />
European wars, such as the two great and devastating wars of this century,<br />
a great thing would have been done for world peace. Whether those processes<br />
would be accelerated and strengthened by British entry into the<br />
European Community presents a great current problem of statesmanship.<br />
What we have sought to make clear is that if Great Britain<br />
went in, and if in the course of time the extended European Economic<br />
Community became a European political community with the structure of a<br />
Federation, the nature of the present Commonwealth would be clearly and<br />
materially changed. For, as we know, a Federation distributes sovereignty between<br />
the central or Federal authority and the Member States. The sovereign<br />
powers of the Member States are diminished, the powers subtracted being<br />
handed over to the central or Federal authority. In short, if Great<br />
Britain eventually became a Member State in a European Federation, she<br />
would no longer be sovereign as the other Commonwealth countries are.<br />
The Commonwealth would have ceased to be an association of sovereign and<br />
fully self-governing States. </p>
<p>-6-<br />
That such a consequence could be regarded by British Statesmen,<br />
contemplating the importance of European integration, as, on balance,<br />
acceptable, I would not deny. But it would be in our opinion wrong to<br />
pretend that, in that event, the nature and structure of the Commonwealth<br />
had not been changed.<br />
Throughout my journey and my conversations, I felt most acutely<br />
the pressure of these considerations. The question in my mind took shape<br />
somewhat as follows: " After all, the Commonwealth has sustained many<br />
changes since the last war. Only some of its members remain withnthe<br />
direct allegiance to the Throne. It cannot be said that we have an allembracing<br />
community of political institutions or democratic processes, or<br />
of the rule of law as we know it. Should our deep desire to preserve what<br />
we can be allowed to stand in the way of a new European conception embracing<br />
some 300 millions of British and European people, getting rid of their<br />
old local hostilities and forming themselves into an integrated Power<br />
devoted to true peace and determined to resist aggression?"<br />
I believe that we, as a not unimportant member of the Commonwealth,<br />
would answer that question, as I have tried to answer it in<br />
England myself, by saying that United Kingdom membership of an actual<br />
European Federation, involving the great change in the Commonwealth to<br />
which I have referred, would be a mistake. I don't say that it is<br />
contemplated I am sure that it is not but nobody can confidently<br />
foretell the effect of those pressures of the future which I mentioned<br />
a few minutes ago.<br />
It is possible to contemplate with approval a close coordination<br />
of high political policies between Great Britain and the<br />
European Economic Community. It would, as we see it, be an unhappy<br />
thing to contemplate the absorption of Great Britain into an organic<br />
European Federal Union.<br />
But, I repeat, these decisions are not ours to make. All<br />
we can do is to state our views as we hold them and as we are entitled<br />
and bound to express them, and trust to the accumulated wisdom and<br />
experience of Great Britain, as the centre of the Commonwealth, to come<br />
to sound conclusions.<br />
ECONOMIC It is on the economic aspects of British entry into the<br />
Common Market that it would not be right to dogmatise about the views<br />
of the Government of the United Kingdom. </p>
<p>7<br />
There are those who believe strongly that for Britain to<br />
have duty free entry into a Home Market of 300 million people with<br />
relatively high living standards would mean salvation and growth for<br />
British manufacturing industry in total. When questioned about the<br />
possible damage to British industry by duty-free goods from Europe,<br />
their answer is that this challenge will be met by increased efficiency<br />
in Britain, an efficiency compelled by the new circumstances.<br />
On the other hand, there are competent people who think<br />
that the economic arguments for going in or staying out are fairly<br />
evenly balanced. This is a view which I found more widely held than<br />
I had expected. So much was this the case that I found myself tending<br />
more and more to the belief that the dynamic element in the Common Market<br />
movement is the conviction of political advantage; almost of political<br />
necessity in the cause of world security; and that the economic results<br />
are accepted by some as the necessary condition of political association.<br />
Once again, I made it clear that we are not sitting in judgment<br />
on Great Britain's own economic views. It is for her to balance<br />
the possible gains in Europe against the possible losses in Commonwealth<br />
trade, which has in the past, of course, been vastly more important to<br />
her. Our task is not to oppose Britain's entry on economic grounds<br />
which affect her, and which fall for her judgment; it is to do all we<br />
can, by hard work and persuasion, to ensure that the terms finally agreed<br />
to by the Six do the minimum of damage to the present and anticipated<br />
pattern of Commonwealth Trade, and of Australian trade in particular.<br />
I am not in a position at present to expound the present state<br />
of the Brussels negotiations. They are clearly far from complete. I<br />
anticipate that fairly soon we will be officially and fully informed.<br />
Until then, it would merely confuse the problem for me to introduce<br />
speculation into what is intended to be an objective narrative.<br />
But whatever the outcome of the negotiations may be; whatever<br />
outline of tentative arrangements may be presented to the Prime<br />
Ministers next month; the ultimate decision, when all the arguments<br />
have been heard, will be that of Great Britain, over whom, except for<br />
such current and binding agreements as now exist, no meeting of Prime<br />
Ministers can exercise a veto.<br />
I mention these truisms because they are too frequently<br />
forgotten. Although one is frequently asked for a categorical YES or<br />
NO to the question " are you in favour of Britain entering the European<br />
Community?" no such answer is as yet possible. The position is still </p>
<p>8<br />
confused. Very able Australian officials have for a year, both in<br />
London and Europe, and recently in Washington, presented to their<br />
opposite numbers facts, arguments, and proposals in relation to a long<br />
list of Australian commodities. The permanent head of our Trade<br />
Department, Dr. Westerman, whose ability, knowledge, and immense<br />
industry deserve great praise, made a long exposition of Australia's<br />
approach to the Council of Deputies at Brussels. My colleague, Mr.<br />
McEwen, this year pursued a powerful advocacy on the Ministerial level<br />
in all three areas. I myself followed the matter up as well as I could<br />
in the journey which gives rise to this report.<br />
All these things have been done in no spirit of hostility.<br />
We know that the British Government has set out to secure terms which<br />
give reasonable protection to Commonwealth interests. We have a high<br />
regard for their chief negotiator, Mr. Heath, who has at all times been<br />
accessible to our views and has, as we know, been presenting the case for<br />
Commonwealth trade to the European negotiators.<br />
It is certain that when we meet in September we cannot be<br />
presented with a complete package of possible arrangements. But it was<br />
anticipated, when I left London, that enough progress would have been<br />
made to enable useful discussion on some important items to occur, and<br />
the relevant principles to be debated.<br />
Both in London and Washington, I encountered some opinions,<br />
courteously but firmly expressed, that the Australian Government was<br />
overstating its case, and that the damage to Australian trade was likely<br />
to be comparatively minor. I know, from an unhappy recent experience,<br />
that this view is entertained by some thoughtful people in Australia.<br />
I therefore took, and now take again, the opportunity of<br />
answering these opinions.<br />
In the first place, nobody is yet in a position to know<br />
what the terms of British entry will be. If she were to enter on the<br />
existing terms of the Treaty of Rome, with its objectives of internal<br />
free trade, a common External Tariff, and a Common Agricultural Policy,<br />
our preferences would before long be terminated, and replaced by<br />
preferences in Great Britain to European products. In addition, our<br />
access to the enlarged Common Market would be restricted by the array<br />
of protective devices used to support the Common Agricultural Policy.<br />
In such an event, blows would be struck in due or undue course against<br />
our exports of such important commodities as ( to takea few examples)<br />
sugar, metallic lead, dairy products, meat, dried fruits, and canned<br />
fruits. </p>
<p>9<br />
Should the terms of the Treaty of Rome be modified in the<br />
interests of Commonwealth trade, the degree of impact upon our export<br />
trade will depend upon the nature and extent of the modifications. As<br />
we do not know what, if any, modifications may be arrived at between<br />
Great Britain and the Six, who ( not we) are the negotiators, we must,<br />
as prudent people, assess the possible losses to us on the basis of the<br />
Treaty of Rome as it stands; any departure from it in our direction<br />
will be so much saved.<br />
I have not tried to deal with the purely financial implications<br />
of the Treaty of Rome. They were very clearly explained by Mr.<br />
Holt in this House on August 22nd 1961, in a speech which all students<br />
of the Common Market problem should study.<br />
But there is another consideration which Mr. McEwen repeatedly<br />
explained, and to which I devoted a good deal of my time. A general<br />
economic survey which looks at national totals, divorced from consideration<br />
of particular industries, regions, and communities of men and women, can<br />
be most misleading. Percentages, as we know, can frequently be misleading.<br />
Much of Australia's productive development has been related<br />
to the long established pattern of Commonwealth trade, and designed to<br />
satisfy markets which form part of that pattern. In many cases, entire<br />
communities have grown up around export industries of this kind. In<br />
many cases, such industries cannot be confident of finding alternative<br />
markets quickly, or in some cases, at all. I will illustrate.<br />
In 1960-61, our exports of metallic lead ( pig and bullion)<br />
totalled Å 15.8m. Great Britain took Å 10.6m of this, duty free. Behind<br />
this export, we have developed in Australia great smelters, notably at<br />
Port Pirie, whose efficiency is of world standard. We also export<br />
substantial quantities of concentrates. The Common Market contemplates<br />
a Common External Tariff of about 9/ o on metal.<br />
It is not difficult to see that, if our exports of lead are<br />
to be subject to this tariff, Australia could, upon British entry, lose<br />
the bulk of her export of metallic lead; her lead smelters could become<br />
uneconomic; while, ironically enough, as the Common Market will freely<br />
import lead concentrates, the reduction ( and perhaps disappearance) of<br />
lead smelting in Australia could be accompanied by the creation of new<br />
smelters in Europe. It would be difficult to persuade communities like Broken<br />
Hill and Port Pirie that the problems thus presented for their industries,<br />
their regions, and their people, are minor ones. </p>
<p>Take Dairy farming and the butter export. In 1961-62, for<br />
which we have complete figures, Australia exported to the United Kingdom<br />
just under Å 20m worth of butter, out of our total export of Å 23.5m. It<br />
entered the United Kingdom duty free, whereas European butter pays a duty<br />
of 15/-a hundredweight. Should Great Britain go into the Common Market<br />
on the terms of the Treaty of Rome, Australian butter would be subject to<br />
variable levies and possibly quantitative restrictions, while European<br />
butter would have free access. Is the problem thus presented, in economic,<br />
industrial, and human terms, a minor one?<br />
Take Sugar, a great industry which gives life and significance<br />
to large coastal areas in Queensland and the north of New South Wales.<br />
In 1961-62, for which also we have complete figures, Australia exported<br />
Å 18.3m worth to the United Kingdom, none to the E. E. C. and Å 14.8m elsewhere.<br />
Our exports to the United Kingdom are mainly at a negotiated price under<br />
the Commonwealth Sugar Agreement. On the remainder of our exports to the<br />
United Kingdom we receive the world price plus a preference which is of<br />
the order of sterling a ton.<br />
Surely this is a measure of trade so closely related to the<br />
development and peopling of our North that its protection assumes major<br />
proportions. Dried vine fruits have provided the foundation, in specially<br />
irrigated areas, of large settlements, particularly of ex-servicemen, in<br />
New South Wales, Victoria, and South Australia. In 1961-62 we exported<br />
to the United Kingdom no less than Å 5m worth, out of a total export of<br />
Our product entered the United Kingdom duty free. The application<br />
of the terms of the Treaty of Rome, with a proposed Common External<br />
Tariff of could strike a crippling blow at industries which support<br />
entire communities, and to whom an assured export is economically vital.<br />
Canned deciduous fruits and canned Pineapple also have great<br />
regional significance. In 1961, we exported to the United Kingdom, duty<br />
free, nearly Å llm worth, a nominal amount to the E. E. C. and under Å lm<br />
elsewhere. The proposed Common Market External Tariff is 25%. It is<br />
therefore clear that practically the whole of this export trade is<br />
involved in the negotiations now going on.<br />
I have said nothing about our large export trade in Wheat<br />
and Meat, to which our negotiators have been directing close attention.<br />
These products need a special presentation, and I will not expand what<br />
should be the reasonable limits of a statement like the present one in<br />
order to do what my colleague, the Minister for Trade, can do with<br />
greater knowledge and authority. </p>
<p>11<br />
But the illustrations I have given will, I hope, convince the<br />
House that it has not been for small considerations that we have been<br />
conducting negotiations and offering advocacy on an unprecedented scale,<br />
including the facilitation of investigations on the spot by leading members<br />
of the Opposition. We are realists, but that is not to say that we are pessimists.<br />
We attach great value to the expressed determination of the United Kingdom<br />
Government to protect Commonwealth interests. We believe that the powerful<br />
and influential United States of America understands our lawful interests<br />
and national ambitions, and the importance of a Commonwealth growing in<br />
political and economic strength and significance.<br />
I am not conscious of any exaggeration in our case.<br />
indeed, I had not thought that the possible impact upon Australia<br />
and is, a matter of very substantial importance to our own growth<br />
prosperity, I do not think I should have so warmly approved of my<br />
strenuous journey or undertaken a similar one myself. If,<br />
was, and colleague's<br />
There is one other aspect of the economic argument which deserves<br />
special mention. I have had a good deal to say about our primary export<br />
industries, which are of vital importance to our balances of trade and payments,<br />
and whose volume of export trade is so important for their unit costs<br />
of production. We must, at our peril, do what we can to keep those costs<br />
from rising in a world in which the terms of trade are by no means favourable<br />
to us. But our manufacturing industry, the steady growth of which is<br />
needed for an increase in our population and full employment, has great<br />
interests in the Common Market negotiations. This comes about in two ways.<br />
First, our export earnings serve materially to determine our<br />
capacity to import. Most of our imports are not those of finished consumer<br />
goods, but those of plant and materials for local manufacture. In<br />
this way, the protection of the export markets of our primary products is<br />
essential to our manufacturing growth.<br />
Second, the accession of Great Britain to the European Common<br />
Market is thought, as I have said, to be likely, through the creation of<br />
a vast home market, likely to increase manufacturing efficiency and reduce<br />
manufacturing costs in the extended European community. This must be<br />
expected to increase its competitive capacity in its exports to Australia.<br />
This in turn will affect the capacity of Australian manufacturing to meet<br />
competition from overseas, and may well give rise to acute Tariff problems<br />
which in their turn will, or may, create cost problems in the rural<br />
industries. </p>
<p>12<br />
I am not assuming to answer these problems in advance. What<br />
I do want to make clear is that it would be an error to think that the<br />
Common Market problem is of interest to limited sections of the people.<br />
In reality, it touches the Australian economy at many points, and must be<br />
the concern of us all.<br />
When I flew over to the United States of America, my principal<br />
objectives were to discuss with the President, the Secretary of State,<br />
Mr. Dean Rusk, and Mr. Averell Harriman, some of the problems of South<br />
East Asia, and also ( with the addition of Mr. Assistant Secretary Ball<br />
and other leading officials) the problem of British entry into the Common<br />
Market. I am happy to say that, over a period of three days in<br />
Washington, I was given a great deal of time and had the fullest<br />
opportunity to develop the views of the Australian Government.<br />
In particular, Honourable Members may be interested to know<br />
that I found President Kennedy, with whom I had enjoyed most useful talks<br />
fourteen months earlier, not only friendly but uncommonly well-informed<br />
on Australia's special interests in the Common Market negotiations. He<br />
gave me hours of his time, as did the principal members of his Administration.<br />
Assisted by the reports of my colleague, the Minister for<br />
Trade, who had done invaluable work a little earlier in Washington, I<br />
came to the conclusion that it would not be useful for me to rehearse<br />
the arguments justifying the principle of the preferential trade system<br />
of the Commonwealth which was first given comprehensive form at Ottawa<br />
in 1932 and to which the United States has always expressed objection.<br />
Deeply attached though we are to the Commonwealth pattern of trade, I<br />
felt that nothing was to be gained by pursuing what might be called<br />
doctrinal arguments about an issue on which my colleague, speaking with<br />
great knowledge and authority, had deserved success, but had not been<br />
able to achieve it. My own approach, therefore, took two forms.<br />
The first was to say that, in the interest of practical<br />
satisfaction for both Australia and the United States of America, we<br />
should agree to avoid conflicting theories or argument about particular<br />
phrases or words, and find out whether, in a purely practical and<br />
pragmatic way, we could consider American and Australian interests in<br />
particular commodities to the end result that we might do our best,<br />
jointly and severally, to preserve our competitive status in the<br />
markets of an extended European area, and, in the case of Australia,<br />
maintain and expand access for our goods to Britain and Europe. </p>
<p>13<br />
The second was to make it clear that should the Six insist<br />
upon terms of entry which involved the disappearance of Commonwealth<br />
preferences by 1970 without some other provisions for preserving our<br />
market opportunities, the government of Great Britain would be confronted<br />
by a most difficult qhoice whether to go into Europe on terms which<br />
would invite opposition in other Commonwealth countries, or to terminate<br />
the negotiations and stay out of Europe. My argument was that, should<br />
Great Britain be confronted by such a dilemma, the United States of<br />
America itself would be, though not a party principal in the negotiations,<br />
the witness of a conflict of interests on a matter in which, as I believed,<br />
it wanted to see Great Britain go into Europe, but did not desire to have<br />
a conflict of Commonwealth interests.<br />
After my Washington discussions, which I thought particularly<br />
helpful, a joint communique was agreed upon. Though Honourable Members<br />
have no doubt seen its terms as published, I ask leave to incorporate<br />
the relevant portions of it in Hansard, so that I may direct attention<br />
to some of its terms.<br />
" President Kennedy expressed his strong belief in the<br />
importance of the Commonwealth as a source of stability and strength for<br />
the free world. At the same time both leaders recognized that European<br />
unity could contribute substantially to the strength of the free world.<br />
" They reviewed therefore the implications for the trade of<br />
their two nations of the possible accession of the United Kingdom to the<br />
European Economic Community.<br />
" It was agreed that, in this event, the United States and<br />
Australia would, as great suppliers to Britain and Europe, face problems<br />
in endeavouring to maintain and expand access for their goods.<br />
" The Prime Minister offered the view that it would be a grave<br />
misfortune if, after the negotiations, it turned out that the conditions<br />
laid down for Britain's entry were unacceptable to Commonwealth countries<br />
on the ground that they damaged Commonwealth trade and expansion.<br />
" The Presddent and Prime Minister took note of the fact that<br />
with respect to certain articles and commodities Australia's historic<br />
terms of access are different from those of the United States. They<br />
recognized, however, that Australia competed with the United States in<br />
the United Kingdom market with respect to only a relatively small number<br />
of these items, though the items themselves are by no means small in<br />
importance. They agreed that, with respect to these items, technical<br />
discussions would be held between the two Governments in an effort to<br />
reconcile the trading interests of both nations. </p>
<p>14<br />
" With respect to the great bulk of articles and commodities<br />
they noted that, as non-members of the European Economic Community, their<br />
countries faced essentially the same problems, and they joined in hoping<br />
that the community would pursue liberal trading policies. President<br />
Kennedy pointed out that under the trade expansion legislation now pending<br />
before the Congress the United States Government should strive, through<br />
reciprocal agreements, to bring about a general reduction of trade barriers<br />
for the benefit of all. Moreover, both leaders agreed that, with respect<br />
to a number of key primary products, the problems raised by the expansion<br />
of the Common Market might best be solved through international arrangements.<br />
" During the course of their interviews the President expressed<br />
his warm interest in Australia and his understanding of Australia's needs<br />
in terms of development and growth, recognizing the problems of particular<br />
regions as well as industries.<br />
" Both he and the Prime Minister were agreed that the problems<br />
for the United States and Australia arising out of Britain's proposed entry<br />
should be approached not on any basis of theory or the use of particular<br />
words but upon a practical basis, examining commodities one by one, having<br />
in mind the protection of the interests of both countries.<br />
" As a result of their discussions the President and the Prime<br />
Minister were encouraged to believe that satisfactory solutions will be<br />
found to those problems faced by their two countries."<br />
I thought our talks and this joint message quite valuable.<br />
The atmosphere of our relations with our powerful friends in America is<br />
of material and continuing importance. It is therefore significant that<br />
the document records that<br />
" President Kennedy expressed his strong belief in<br />
the importance of the Commonwealth as a source<br />
of stability and strength for the free world".<br />
I can assure the House that this is no mere form of words.<br />
The President's knowledge of Commonwealth problems is quite remarkable.<br />
His interest in Australia in particular is quite unfeigned. I am sure that<br />
he is our friend. Again " It was agreed that, in the event" ( of Great Britain<br />
acceding to the European Economic Community) " the United States and<br />
Australia would, as great suppliers to Britain and Europe, face problems<br />
in endeavouring to maintain and expand access for their goods." </p>
<p>I attached importance to this as a recognition that Australia<br />
is an expanding country with a great need for economic growth, and that<br />
we should be able to look forward to expanding our export trade to the<br />
European area. And further " They agreed that, with respect to these items"<br />
those in which Australia competed with the United States in the<br />
United Kingdom market) " technical discussions would be held between the<br />
two governments in an effort to reconcile the trading interests of both<br />
nations". This paragraph arose from my proposal that Dr. Westerman,<br />
our chief official negotiator, should return to Washington to have commodity<br />
by commodity discussions, " not on any basis of theory" ( as a later paragraph<br />
of the communique puts it) " or the use of particular words, but upon a<br />
practical basis, examining commodities one by one, having in mind the protection<br />
of the interests of both countries".<br />
Pursuant to this arrangement, Dr. Westerman returned to<br />
Washington. On his return to Australia, he was able to report some most<br />
useful talks, which have greatly assisted Mr. McEwen and myself in subsequent<br />
communications with British Ministers. I will make a further<br />
reference to this before I conclude in a few moments.<br />
Honourable Members will observe in the communique our joint<br />
hope that the European Community will pursue liberal trading policies.<br />
This is important. Australia has for years past been carrying out<br />
active policies for the development of new markets and an increased<br />
export trade. This has been done through a much enlarged Trade<br />
Commissioner Service, Trade Missions, Trade Ships, the Export Payments<br />
Insurance Corporation, special tax measures designed to encourage export,<br />
Banking arrangements in aid of rural development, Beef Roads assistance<br />
and aid to the provision of improved coal exports ports and facilities.<br />
But the British and European markets remain very important for most<br />
export industries, and are quite vital for some. It thus gave me<br />
satisfaction when President Kennedy approved this paragraph:-<br />
" During the course of their interviews the President<br />
expressed his warm interest in Australia and his<br />
understanding of Australia's needs in terms of<br />
development and growth, recognising the problems<br />
of particular regions as well as industries".<br />
And finally, on the personal initiative of the President himself, the<br />
final words were added </p>
<p>16<br />
" As a result of their discussions the President and<br />
the Prime Minister were encouraged to believe that<br />
satisfactory solutions will be found to those<br />
problems faced by their two countries."<br />
I have already referred to the arrangement made for further<br />
official talks in Washington. These occurred, most usefully, and my<br />
colleague, Mr. McEwen, and I have had personal reports on them by Dr.<br />
Westerman. Even more importantly, I have in the last few days learned<br />
from the American Administration of its deep satisfaction with these<br />
talks, their co-operative spirit and their fruitfulness.<br />
I conclude by saying that, in this matter which transcends<br />
normal Party differences, we shall continue to do all in our power to<br />
influence decisions in directions which we believe will be good for<br />
Australia and for the Commonwealth and therefore enhance ( in the words<br />
which I have quoted) " the importance of the Commonwealth as a source of<br />
stability and strength for the free world". </p>
