Your Imperial Majesty, Your Excellencies, Ministers, Parliamentary<br />
Colleagues and Ladies and Gentlemen<br />
This, I think, as far as the history of our land is concerned,<br />
is a unique occasion, for it is the first time on which, although our land<br />
itself is age old and worn down with erosion of the centuries and the more<br />
than centuries, it is the first time on which a people with a histioryof something<br />
less than two hundred years has had the honour and the privilege<br />
of having had a visit, Sir, from the ruler of a nation whose history goes<br />
back into the mists of time and which was, with one foot in the Mediterranean<br />
basin from which Western civilisation sprang how many thousand years<br />
ago? a nation which affected that growth at that time.<br />
That alom, Sir, is sufficient reason for us to extend to<br />
you, as we do, the warmest welcome which we could possibly extend to<br />
a visiting emperor. There is something about the land of Ethiopia which I<br />
think all Australians, indeed all people of British descent my own<br />
father included.., knew more about, had. heard more about not in<br />
detail but had heard more about in general, the land of Ethiopia than of<br />
any other land in Africa, or indeed, most other lands in the world.<br />
Our minds go back to that fabled Queen of Sheba,<br />
apparently, Sir, an extremely attractive woman, who had heard of the wisdom...<br />
( she was an Ethiopian) of the King Solomon, and being a woman because<br />
they haven't changed over these thousands of years decided to find out<br />
whether indeed the wisdom of that King was as great as it . was reputed to<br />
be. So she set out as chronicles tell us to prove King Sdomon with<br />
hard questions.... something which women still continue to do and which<br />
is not indeed unknown, Sir, in the precincts of the House in which you<br />
find yourself. I like to think and again I go back to chronicles that<br />
amongst the gifts taken by the Queen of Sheba were not only many shekels<br />
of gold, not only large measures of precious jewels, but something which<br />
chronicles describe as an algum tree. Now, Sir, I am not quite sure what<br />
the prefix " al" means. I think it is an Arabic prefix which may be " el" or<br />
may be but in either case means " the". So perhaps it was that the<br />
Queen of Sheba took to King Solomon " the gum tree", that perhaps because<br />
of erosion disappeared, and Sir if that is so, we like to think that because<br />
in your land this grows so prolifically that it came back so many thousands<br />
of years later from us.<br />
But it is not only because of the storied land, it is not<br />
only because from this visit derived the title ' Lion of Judah" which<br />
Menelek I, five or six thousand years ago assumed or was given, and which<br />
you Sir still bear in direct descent, it is not merely because of this and </p>
<p>-2<br />
policy, and indeed, they are responsible for carrying out policies decided<br />
by governments, governments being elected by the people of Australia because<br />
we are, as I think you have been told, a country which is wedded to democracy.<br />
The theme of this confer.. nce is, as I understand it, how to make<br />
a machine work for the good of man, rather than to have men existing to<br />
serve machines, how to harness the industrial development and invention<br />
which takes place so that that industrial development and invention, causing<br />
as it nearly always does, disruption initially, will nevertheless eventually<br />
provide a better life than was possible before the invention took place.<br />
This question is one which has bedevilled man for far back in<br />
history. In Great Britain, the country from which my father came, I remember<br />
reading of Luddite riots which took place when, for the first time, the cottage<br />
industries which had employed people in weaving and other methods of making<br />
their living were threatened by the incipient factories Mhich at that time were<br />
brought in because it was found that things could be made cheaper, and in<br />
many cases better. But although things could be made cheaper, and in many<br />
cases better, nevertheless a pattern of life was disrupted and a pattern of<br />
home employment was put in jeopardy, and so there were riots.<br />
Yet, the eventual results of the invention, of course, advanced<br />
immensely the material standard of living of those in that country<br />
In the case of the Industrial revolution which swept the world 1 suppose, if<br />
I may oversimplify beginning with the invention of steam, in that time also<br />
we had the same problem repeated, with great industrial capacity created,<br />
with infinitely more efficiency brought to bear on the production of the needs<br />
of individual people, but with individual people indiscriminately being herded<br />
into those " dark Satanic mills" about which words were written at the time.<br />
Well, we have moved from those days. We have moved to understand,<br />
as this conference will discuss, how we can use the new inventions which come<br />
pouring in upon us, which must in many cases disrupt existing patterns o<br />
empbyment how we can use them so that we avoid human distress, so that<br />
we avoid human displacement, so that we achieve the benefits that the new<br />
inventions will bring to us.<br />
In order to do this, we need more than a mcre understanding of<br />
the inventions themselves, than a mere understanding of the application of<br />
new principles, important though this may be, for these new scientific<br />
achievements, these new technological achievements are bringing to us<br />
as human beings a capacity for good which I think has not been known in the<br />
world before to the extent to which it is, and a capacity for evil, which I<br />
think has not been known in the world before to the extent to which it is.<br />
just as the invention of fire was the invention of something which could be<br />
used on the hearth of a home to warm a fami ly during a winter's night, or<br />
to provide a meal which was not raw and half-burnt, so the invention of fire<br />
could be used, and has been used, to destroy cities and irreplaceable<br />
libraries. just as the understanding of the atom has enabled immense<br />
advantage in medical techniques and in industrial techniques, and I think and<br />
hope for the future, provided a chance for dry continents such as our own<br />
to take water from the sea and turn that water into the fresh water that we<br />
need, so the understanding of the atom has also given an opportunity for<br />
cities and regions to be laid waste. / 3 </p>
<p>-3<br />
Therefore, it is more than n-arely understanding the<br />
scientific changes, more than merely understanding the technological<br />
changes which are required. It is an understanding of human hearts.<br />
It is a call to educate human beings to see that these great powers now<br />
being released are used for good and are not used for evil.<br />
Beyond that, and I think below that, but nevertheless of<br />
immense importance, is this requirement to understand what human needs<br />
are. I know they vary; of course they must from individual to individual.<br />
But there probably must be, I think, some common human requirement<br />
if an individual is to feel himself fulfilled, if he is to feel that he is living<br />
a not merely materially successful, but a satisfactory life.<br />
These things, I think, we do not yet know, but because<br />
one of the by-products of the scientific revolution is that there is goi ng to<br />
be more and more leisure, more and more capacity for an individual to<br />
move away from the hourly requirement to earn and leave him more time<br />
to develop I did not say " ejo" but to develop oneself must be regarded<br />
as enjoyment we need to know more about what it is that people wish to<br />
do in this way, and to provide that along with the harnessing of the<br />
scientific and technical advances made.<br />
That I think, Your Royal H-ighness, is one of the basic<br />
ideas underlying the whole of this conference, and indeed, the other<br />
conferences you have held. Because these are problems which are not<br />
confined to one country but problems which in varying degrees already<br />
encompass the countries of the world and will in the future encompass in<br />
greater degree more countries, it is time and more than time that people<br />
gathered, as you have gathered, to discuss these matters. And it may<br />
be that if from. your discussions come some ideas which, as ideas are<br />
inclined to do, filter slowly, but filter through a community and then to<br />
a government, then it may be that you will be providing for your children<br />
or your grandchildren a world in which the great advances which have been<br />
made will be understood, will be used in a proper way in the world, and<br />
what I think we all seek more than anything else the individual can feel<br />
he is contributing to the community in which he lives, can get satisfaction<br />
from that, can feel that whatever it is inside him which is able to be developed,<br />
whether it be musical talent, artistic talent, literary talent, or any -other<br />
talent, is being full opportunity to burgeon and develop, If this harp. ns,<br />
then a great service will have been done to mankind.<br />
And so I wish you well in your deliberations. I have<br />
great pleasure in welcoming you again, if I may, to the National Capital,<br />
and I hope when you disperse to the cities of this Commonwealth that you<br />
will see for yourselves the problems still remaining and perhaps suggest<br />
some solution. If in your discussions you disagree as to the precise<br />
solutions or even as to the precise problems, well, Sir, that will be not at<br />
all surprising because it is not unknown for us to disagree amongst ourselves.<br />
I thank you. </p>
