PRIME MINISTER 2, ANR~<br />
FOR MEDIA THURSDAY 20 MARCH Q 0*<br />
COMMONWEALTH AND STATE GOVERNMENT AGREE ON<br />
DEVELOPMENT OF NAVAL BASE AT WOOLLOO&gt; L00LO<br />
The Commionwealth is to acquire the Maritime Services Board<br />
w-. harves on the eastern side of Woolloomooloo Bay in Sydney<br />
for the Navy.<br />
The Commonwealth Government also has decided that a multi-storey<br />
car park should be built in Cowper Wharf Road near Garden Island.<br />
Both projects are part of a long-term plan to modernise the<br />
Garden Island Naval Dockyard and Fleet Base at an estimated cost<br />
of $ 180 million in 1978 prices..<br />
The primary objectives of the modernisation plan are to improve<br />
the operating efficiency and physical environment of Garden<br />
Island.<br />
Agreement has been reached with the New South Wales Government<br />
to purchase Nos. 2, 3 and 4 wharves at Woolloomooloo. The.<br />
purchase will help overcome a serious shortage of wharf space<br />
at Garden Island. The wharves will be provided with the full<br />
range of shore ser vices including power, compressed air and<br />
sewerage, so that ships alongside would not need to run machinery,<br />
thus avoiding pollution.<br />
The Government approved in principle the first stage of the<br />
modernisation of Garden Island last year. This included<br />
construction of a utilities building, a weapons/ electronic<br />
workshop, a refit berth support facility, and groundworks. The<br />
total estimated cost is about $ 17 million. 4 / 8,9) 9 ri 4. 6-It-<br />
2 </p>
<p>The multi-level car park, to be located along the northern<br />
cliff face of Cowper Wharf Road, was included in the first<br />
stage of modernisation at the request of the Premier of NSW,<br />
Mr. Wran.<br />
The facility will provide accommodation for the cars owned by<br />
Garden Island civilian and Service personnel, during working<br />
hours, and a large part of it will be available for use by<br />
local residents and visitors for night-time parking.<br />
The roof of the car park will be surfaced with lawns and<br />
garden and this will provide a much needed amenity for the<br />
residents of the surrounding area.<br />
In addition, arrangements will be developed to improve public<br />
access to the northern headland and other historic areas of<br />
Garden Island.<br />
The car park proposal will be referred to the Parliamentary<br />
Standing Committee on Public Works for hearing in conjunction<br />
with the previously announced Garden Island stage one modernisation<br />
works. This hearing is expected to occur in the latter half of<br />
this year. 000---</p>
