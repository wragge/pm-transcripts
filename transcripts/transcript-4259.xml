PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR PRESS 20 O* CTOBER 1976<br />
FUTURE, MAJOR AIRPORT NEEDS OF SYDNEY<br />
The Prime Minister, The Right Hon. Malcolm Fraser, and the<br />
N. S. W.-Premier, the Hon. Neville Wran, today announced the<br />
establishment of a Committee of senior Commonwealth and<br />
State officials to recommend a suitable strategy for airport<br />
development and associated land use and surface access in the<br />
Sydney area.<br />
Mr Fraser and Mr Wran noted that the absence of a<br />
firm policy towards future air transport needs for Sydney had<br />
helped to generate public controversy and had inhibited proper<br />
planning. It could be to the detriment of Sydney and of<br />
New South Wales generally if further undue delay in determining<br />
future strategies were to prejudice the selection of the most<br />
appropriate options and add seriously to eventual costs.<br />
This could lead to a situation where future air transport demands<br />
were not adequately met.<br />
The Committee will examine existing airports and the possibility<br />
of establishing a major airport at a new site.<br />
The Committee is to report to the two Governments within<br />
eighteen months. In reaching its conclusions, the Committee<br />
will take into account all relevant factors economic, financial,<br />
social, technical, operational, environmental, land use and<br />
community attitudes. It will also inform-and consult the airlines,<br />
unions, local government authorities, community organisations,<br />
and other interested parties. / 2 </p>
<p>I, 2.<br />
The Commonwealth Minister for Transport, the Hon. P. J. Nixon,<br />
and the State Minister for Planning and Environment, the<br />
Hon. D. P. Landa, will be meeting shortly to finalise the<br />
necessary detailed arrangements. 000ooo00000 </p>
