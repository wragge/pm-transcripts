PRIME MINISTER1<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF PRESS CONFERENCE, SHERATON HOTEL, NEW DELHIj<br />
E 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
JOURNALIST: Last night Prime Minister Gandhi in his speech<br />
at the dinner called on Australia to play it's part with<br />
India in assuring a return to democracy in Fiji. What is<br />
your Government's thinking at this stage in regard to Fiji's<br />
re-entry to the Commonwealth and what more could or should<br />
Australia be doing in regard to Fiji.<br />
* PM: On the first past of the question, obviously we would<br />
share a view with India, and I think a lot of other members:<br />
of the Commonwealth that we would like to see Fiji back in<br />
the Commonwealth, but that is not something that can be<br />
achieved, other than on conditions which are universally<br />
acceptable. At this point, I can't see that the present<br />
condition in Fiji would recommend itself to all members of<br />
the Commonwealth and certainly including India as suitable<br />
for re-entry. The draft constitution which has been<br />
circulated, still contains the entrenchment within it of an<br />
ensured majority within the proposed parliament for the<br />
indigenous Fijian population. I can't imagine that out of<br />
the processes of the consultation, the draft constitution as<br />
it stands would remain acceptable. If that were the case, it<br />
doesn't seem to me possible that any application from Fiji<br />
for readmission at the latter part of this year when the next<br />
Heads of Government meeting will ble held would entertain<br />
universal support. Now, what can Australia do? I have<br />
explained there are limits to what Australia and other<br />
friends can do. We have made it quite clear that the present<br />
situation is not an acceptable one. We have taken action,<br />
we'ye cut off defence aid, we have resumed that aid which we<br />
can identify as going to people, not to institutions. We<br />
think that that is sensible, but we can't impose an<br />
acceptable outcome upon Fiji. The matter has to be worked<br />
out within Fiji.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, have you persuaded Rajiv Gandhi to<br />
sign the NPT.<br />
PM: I didn't believe that I would be able to persuade Mr<br />
Gandhi to sign the NPT. What I have done in what is already<br />
more than 2 hours of one on one discussions with Rajiv and<br />
myself, which will be extended further today, and then ove-r a<br />
long private dinner tomorrow night, we have already had<br />
suitable discussions about the question of global disarmament<br />
and of the developments within this region. We have<br />
agreement between us that it would indeed be a tragedy and a </p>
<p>PM ( cont: paradox if at a time when there is a lessening of<br />
global tension, when there is already significant achievement<br />
in the reduction of nuclear arsenals at the global level with<br />
the elimination of the ILNF class of weapon, significant<br />
progress towards the achievement of a Sl0 per cent reduction<br />
in the strategic weapons area, that i that context, if there<br />
were to be a further buildup of nuclear capacity and tension<br />
in this region. Now we agree on that. As you know, when I<br />
was in Pakistan we achieved agreement there that there would<br />
be regular consultations at the officials' level between<br />
Pakistan and Australia on disarmament matters. 1 indicated<br />
to my friend, Rajiv Gandhi, that we had ihat agreement with<br />
Pakistan and that we would like to have the same agreement<br />
with India. I am very pleased to sa~ y that Mr Gandhi<br />
respornded fully and positively to tnat suggestion. So we<br />
will now establish a continuing ongoinq disCussion at our<br />
officials' level between our two countries on the overall<br />
question of disarmament, and obviously within that overall<br />
level of discussion, there wi. ll be some consideration of<br />
regional matters. Now I want to make it clear that that<br />
* doesn't mean that Australia is acting as some go between In<br />
regard to Pakistan and India. But I do believe that there is<br />
an acceptance of Australia's legitimate interest.<br />
involvement, expertise, commitment, in the whole area of<br />
disarmament, and I believe it will be usefu. that we are able<br />
to talk with both India and Pakistan on these general issues.<br />
I[ think it is important to note, and it certainly came<br />
through to me in my discussions with the Prime Minister, that<br />
he shares the view expressed to me by the Prime Minister of<br />
Pakistan, that there is now a new basis for better relations<br />
between Pakistan and India. Prime Minister Gandhi<br />
reciprocates the warmth, feeling, the attitude expressed to<br />
me by Prime Minister Bhutto. They accept one anothars<br />
commitment and integrity to the creat~. on of a new, more<br />
productive friendly relationship. Now we must be realistic<br />
about this because this new opportunity comes after<br />
generations of hostility in which there have been three<br />
and it would be unrealistic to expect overnight a<br />
* transformation of attitudes and positions formed through that<br />
long period of time. But I must say this, that out of my<br />
discussions with Mr Gandhi, I am very much reassured about<br />
his commitment, the commitment of India, to work for a more<br />
productive relationship, which goes not only to the issue of<br />
the nuclear question, which was the main point of this<br />
question, but also on the other issues of the frontier<br />
problem in the glacier area, and also on the question of<br />
terrorists in the Punjab. There have been discussions about<br />
these three issues. There is an intention to address these<br />
issues, and therefore our concern about the nonproliferation<br />
treaty and our differences of emphasis that we've had with<br />
India on that seem to me now to be able to be approached<br />
within this actual new consultative framework that I referred<br />
to, but more importantly as far as the region is concerned,<br />
we are I believe entering a time of greater optimism in<br />
relations between these two important neighbours of ours than<br />
at any time over the recent past. C in sorry it is a rather<br />
long answer, but I've tried to comprehend a number of the<br />
matters which I know would be ot interest to you. </p>
<p>3<br />
JOURNALIST: Last night at your banquet speech when you<br />
promised recent developments in the Maldives you seem to<br />
have carefully avoided the Sri Lankin situation. Do we take<br />
it that you have your reservations about India's operation in<br />
their presence in Sri Lanka Whlat do you think your<br />
Government's India's peace keeping operations in Sri<br />
Lanka? PM: Nothing was avoided, carefully or otherwise. it was a<br />
reasonably long speech as it was and it' one had qone to all<br />
the issues in which we have an interest and India has an<br />
interest, we might be leaving there now. The approval of ray<br />
Government for India's role is known, it is publicly s. tated<br />
and I have had no reason, having publicly stated our support<br />
for India's role, our appreciation of what they've done<br />
there, and knowing that the government, the Prime Minister,<br />
and the people of India are aware of that public statement of<br />
my position and of the people of Australia, there is no<br />
reason to reinforce it. We share the hope of Prime Minister<br />
Gandhi, and I talked about thi~ s matter with him, and others<br />
here, we share the hope that the timae will come in -, he not<br />
too distant future, when the government of Sri Lanka tinds<br />
itself in a position of contidence to say to India we believe<br />
now the situation is such that we are able to handle it,<br />
control it, and we don't need the further presence of the<br />
Indian troops. Now that's a matter which on the evidence<br />
will be amicably and sensibly handled between the governments<br />
of Sri Lanka and India. And we are satisfied with the<br />
position. JOURNALIST: Mr Gandhi in his speech last night, gave a very<br />
strong defensive naval buildup in the Indian Ocean. What<br />
is Australia's position on this question?<br />
PM: The question was, " in this speech last night, Mr Gandhi<br />
gave a strong defence of the Indian naval buildup in this<br />
region. What is Australia's position in regard to this."<br />
I don't often interpret for Michelle. She usually interprets<br />
for me. I've had the opportunity already Michelle of having<br />
some discussions with Prime Minister Gandhi about this, and<br />
there will be further discussions between us on this issue.<br />
Let me say this, that in the private discussion the Prime<br />
Minister put to me the exposition in some more detail than he<br />
did in his speech, which indicated the concern that India<br />
has about the incursions that have taken place in what for<br />
them is a vast EEZ ( Exclusive Economic Zone) and I don't go<br />
to the countries he named, but he naimed countries that have<br />
intruded into the EEZ, and in a way which India does not find<br />
acceptable, and they are committed to having a capacity to<br />
cover this concern. I must say that some of the issues that<br />
I discussed with the Prime Minister in this regard are the<br />
type that I'm not in a position to talk publicly about. But<br />
let me say this, in the light of the earlier comments that. I<br />
made about the commitment that I know that the Prime Minister<br />
and the Government of India has to a reduction of tension in<br />
the region, and in particular with Pakistan, that as far as I<br />
am concerned I expressed to the Prime Minister my<br />
understanding of his explanation and I believe that there is<br />
reason for confidence about the future on this issue. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Mr Prime Minister, when India had its nuclear<br />
submarine built from Soviet Union there were problems<br />
concerning your country including a rather<br />
Minister of Defence in Perth. Has your position<br />
changed on India's naval or do you see it asthreat<br />
to Australia, as far as you may be?<br />
PM: I discussed this matter with the Prime Minister in some<br />
detail last night, there will be some further discussions on<br />
it. As I said, and I don't want to elaborate on this, there<br />
is some aspect of our discussions which it's not appropriate<br />
for me to go to, but on the basis of che discussions I've<br />
had, my answer to you is that I'm not concerned, and as far<br />
as the future is concerned on the issue that you talk about,<br />
I have reasons for optimism.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Prime Minister, this compulsion for<br />
Australian and Dutch companies to build this $ 2 billion<br />
naval base off Kabal. In your pre-visiting.......<br />
journalists you have said that you are going to take up this<br />
Wwith the Indian Prime Minister, and that you are going to<br />
come up with an interestinq offer which the Indians cannot:<br />
possibly refuse. Would you like to tell us whether this has<br />
with the Indian Prime Minister and what kind of package<br />
are you coming up with?<br />
PM: I don't know whether I used the language that I'm going<br />
to make them an offer that they can't refuse. That has<br />
overtones that I don't entirely embrace but I think I can be<br />
quite definite about it. The consortium offer of which<br />
Australia is a part, will I understand, be accepted. And<br />
this will mean that there will be the injection into this<br />
important enterprise of, and you must understand that this<br />
contract at this stage is a $ 7 million contract. This is the<br />
consultancy, the major consultancy contract, but this will<br />
enable the injection into this important area of Australian<br />
expertise, and it will be indecitive to the government, the<br />
industry, and the people of India of the very considerable<br />
capacity that Australian industry has in a whole range of<br />
construction and infrastructure development which is going to<br />
be important in the future development of India. So it has<br />
an importance, both intrinsically for the project itself and<br />
is a pointer of the general capacity of Australian firms in<br />
this area.<br />
JOURNALIST: Did you discuss with Mr Gandhi, the current<br />
operation of the trade sanctions against South Africa, and<br />
did you talk about the prospect of any further action at<br />
CHOGM later this year.<br />
PM: No, we've only had the briefest mention about this<br />
subject. This is on the agenda for later today and tomorrow<br />
night. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Mr Prime Minister, there is an impression here<br />
among the Defence experts that..... build up in India is<br />
being used or being blown out of proportion by the Defence<br />
establishment to get more money from you. Is that<br />
correct? Why is it that in Australia there is no better<br />
understanding or appreciation of India's naval<br />
aspirations, since this country, unlike Australia has no<br />
links with any other country on defence.<br />
PM: When you say, has no other links with any other country,<br />
it depends how you use the word " links" doesn't it. I mean,<br />
if you mean that it doesn't have a formal alliance<br />
relationship as we do with the United States that is correct.<br />
Hardly correct to say that in regard your naval buildup that<br />
you don't have links with another country. I mean the<br />
nuclear submarine didn't come from Mars. So it's a question<br />
of a definition of links isn't it. Now I don't think that on<br />
this issue there has been any manipulation attempts as far as<br />
I can see, to get more money or support in this way. I think<br />
you've just to understand that the buildup and aspects of the<br />
buildup of the Indian naval capacity have historical bases,<br />
and we are now living in a world which if you had to<br />
characterise in any one way, is the type of most rapid<br />
change, where the assumptions and attitudes of the past are<br />
being shown not to be necessarily valid to the present or the<br />
foreseeable future. So, in the judgements that I make about<br />
present positions, whether it be naval buildup of India or<br />
the intentions of other nations to create a capacity to<br />
project forces, I see those present positions as being a<br />
product of the past. I ask myself whether the changes that<br />
are taking place globally and regionally are likely to<br />
produce changes for the better in the future. And my answer<br />
to that question is yes. So I don't mean, speaking for my<br />
own country say well I will determine the view I have, for<br />
instance about India's present position and say that<br />
necessarily means what their position is going to be next.<br />
year and the year after. They are where they are because of<br />
how they felt in the light of relations as they existed, they<br />
had to make decisions. Now I think that, as I say, there is<br />
a consciousness on the part of India as there is on the partof<br />
Pakistan. For instance, just to take the relations<br />
between those two countries, that there is now the<br />
possibility of a significant change for the better, and I'<br />
hope that as that knowledge and assurance grows then that<br />
will be reflected in decisions that are taken, for instance,<br />
by both India and Pakistan. I mean, lets take the question<br />
of the relations between India and China. If you look at the<br />
present, you have a disposition of forces on the frontier,<br />
you have attitudes which reflect now a generation going back<br />
to the events of 1962 in particular. Now, as a result of the<br />
discussions that have taken place between your Prime Minister<br />
and the Chinese leadership and in respect of which Prime<br />
Minister Gandhi was good enough to give me the most detailed<br />
exposition, then it is clear that there is considerable<br />
ground for optomism now for believing that there will be a<br />
change for the better in the relationship. Prime Minister<br />
Gandhi told me in detail, of the discussions that took place<br />
between him and the Chinese leadership on the border issue.<br />
He told me of the processes, detailed processes that are </p>
<p>PM ( cont): going to be followed through between China and<br />
India, to try to come to a resolution of that issue. Now, as<br />
those things are done, it will be therefore legitimate to<br />
hope and expect that there will be changes in the decisions<br />
that are taken in the defence field and the disposition of<br />
forces and so on. In other words, what we do have to<br />
understand is that both globally and regionally we are<br />
priviledged to live in a time where there is greater cause<br />
for optimism than at any point, I believe, in the whole of<br />
the nuclear age and that will be reflected in this region as<br />
well as other ones.<br />
JOURNALIST: You've obviously been briefed by now on<br />
the ACTU executive wages decision. Do you think this<br />
is an economically responsible one and one the Government<br />
PM: Yes, I think it is an economically responsible outcome.<br />
What's been done there is to come to a and I'm not<br />
Is going to as you'll appreciate. I'm not going to go<br />
in to great detail on this issue. I will be back in Australia<br />
in a couple of days. Let me broadly make the point that<br />
as I confidently predicted, as you know I confidently<br />
predicted, I've said it all along, I had a belief in<br />
the good sense of the trade union movement, in the capacity<br />
of Bill Kelty and the leadership of the ACTU to deliver<br />
a sensible outcome. That confidence and trust and good<br />
faith that I had in them has been vindicated. I think<br />
a framework exists now and I'm very pleased to see that<br />
generally there has been a supportive reaction to it<br />
outside the trade union movement. What now needs to'<br />
be done is for detailed discussions to take place between<br />
government and the trade unions and employers to see<br />
that we get a meshing of wages and tax and associated<br />
outcomes which will mean these things, that I've said<br />
before and I repeat. There will be a satisfaction of<br />
O stthaen dlaergdist iomna tet hed espiarret toof mAauisnttraailni anan dw orgkreardsua lalnyd ithmepirrove<br />
dependents. Within a framework of wage and tax movements<br />
which enable a maintenance of our competitive position<br />
and an achievement of a gradual lowering of the inflationary<br />
context. I think the decision of the ACTU is one which<br />
is going to enable those outcomes to be achieved. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: How do you plan to assist India in sports?<br />
PM: We don't plan to assist you on the cricket fielJ<br />
we want to beat you there. No, seriously, what I have<br />
my relevant ministries doing at the moment in this area<br />
is to have a look at the concept of creating a sports<br />
foundation, an overseas sports foundation which will<br />
look at the ways in which we may be able to assist the<br />
development of sporting relations between Australia and<br />
countries in our region. This will not be something<br />
that involves a great deal of money but there will be<br />
ways I believe in which we can enhance sporting contacts<br />
between our countries, not necessarily only at the top<br />
competitive level. There may be ways also in which we<br />
can make some of the excellent facilities we have in<br />
Australia available to people from India an elsewhere.<br />
I expect to have some proposals on this issue available<br />
to me in the relatively near future and out of those<br />
proposals I am sure there will come specific ways in<br />
which we can enhance the sporting relationships between<br />
our two countries.<br />
JOURNALIST: You are an avid golfer with an 18 handicap<br />
I'm told. How many holes will you play on Sunday and<br />
with whom will you play?<br />
PM: That's the most difficult question I've had so far.<br />
I don't know how many holes. I always start off with<br />
the intention of playing 18 and I hope I'll get 18 in.<br />
With whom I'll be playing I'm not sure at this stage.<br />
The only thing I can say is I don't think it will be<br />
the Prime Minister. I don't think Rajiv is a golfer.<br />
JOURNALIST: Bilateral trade between the two countries<br />
you acknowledged is of a very modest scale. Have you<br />
S been able to identify any new scales in your discussions<br />
and also identify the areas in which you can step up<br />
the bilateral trade?<br />
PM: You're right that at this stage it is relatively<br />
modest, the order of three quarters of a billion dollars<br />
and with a significant imbalance in our favour, Australia's<br />
favour. Yes, we have identified areas. Let me look<br />
first of all at specifically what we intend to do to<br />
enhance the opportunity for an increase of Indian exports<br />
to Australia. During this year we in Australia will<br />
be expending funds in two areas to assit specific Indian<br />
exports. There will be firstly a display of Indian engineering<br />
products which Australia will fund. That will be about<br />
the middle of this year and then later this year we will<br />
also be funding a visit by Indian manufacturers of automobile<br />
components. We believe in those two areas of engineering:<br />
products and automobile components there is the opportunity<br />
for the expansion of trade. </p>
<p>PM ( cont): We had out of Alast meeting in 1986 set a<br />
target for Indian engineering products of at least one<br />
per cent of Australia's imports of goods in that area.<br />
If that was achieved that would mean a lift of itself<br />
up to about $ 130 million worth of products in that area.<br />
So you can see that as far as we're concerned, it's not<br />
just words when we say we recognise the imbalance. We<br />
have addressed specific areas, sort of niche type areas<br />
where Indian products should be available because like<br />
Australia India is proud of the fact that it is no longer<br />
simply a producer and exporter of primary products.<br />
We are both of us becoming more sophisticated in the<br />
range of our production and our export capacities. So<br />
we are identifying areas where from the Indian side there<br />
will be more opportunites in Australia. From the point<br />
of view of Australian exports to India, yes we have very<br />
definitely identified areas. Without being exhaustive<br />
let me go to some of them. We will be completing the<br />
contract for Australian involvement in the Piparwar coal<br />
project. That will be done very shortly, I think before<br />
the end of this month. That will involve a significant<br />
amount of Australian concessional finance involvement<br />
and will represent a demonstration of what is the<br />
indisputable fact. That is that in the area of coal<br />
Australia is second to none in the world. When I say<br />
coal I don't simply mean the export of coking and steaming<br />
coal. Now of course we provide about 90% of your requirements.<br />
overwhelmingly that's coking coal with only about<br />
_ less than half a million tons of steaming coal. But<br />
it's not only the export of coal as such, but we have<br />
an expertise and experience second to none in all aspects<br />
of coal, that is coal handling, transport facilities<br />
and in the building of coal-fired power generating stations.<br />
So that is an area in which we have the experience and<br />
in which I believe there will be significant developments<br />
between us. In the area of mining more generally, Australia<br />
Ois second to none I believe. We will see, I believe,<br />
further developments there. We have recently seen the<br />
conclusion of a contract in which our major company BHP<br />
is involved with your steel industry which is going to<br />
involve our planning in the environmental and pollution<br />
area for your steel industry. In the area of telecommunications<br />
we have a significant experience capacity there. Our<br />
telecommunications Australia International has an outstanding<br />
record. It has already in 22 different countries got<br />
86 contracts ranging to rather small to very large ones,<br />
including recently a major contract in Saudi Arabia.<br />
We have both the technology at the top international<br />
level. We are as good or better than anyone else in<br />
the world. What's important for a country like India<br />
is that Telecom is itself the installer and user of the<br />
type of equipment and services which it's recommending<br />
for India. We have the similar geographic and climactic<br />
experience which makes the technical capacity and know<br />
how of Australia most relevant in those sorts of areas.<br />
In the area of agro based business every area of agriculture<br />
development which is going to be at the forefront of<br />
your next five year plan starting in 1990. in every area<br />
of ag'-o business Australia is at. the forefrPntnf~ wnrld<br />
experr.. nce ans capacity. </p>
<p>PM ( cont): Also I should mention railways. You know<br />
how important railways are in India. It's important<br />
that one of the Memoranda of Understandings that was<br />
being signed here during my visit is in the area of railways.<br />
So there will be co-operation between the Australian<br />
railway industry and your own which will be I suggest<br />
of importance not only for developments within India<br />
but I believe that combining your experience and ours<br />
we will be able to look at the possibility of joint ventures<br />
into third countries. I make the overall point in conclusion<br />
that wh n we're talking about trade India and Australia<br />
it nogAas that dimension, the bilateral dimension, but<br />
increasingly we are also talking about the opportunities<br />
for establishing joint ventures here in India as a base<br />
for exports into the eastern block countries and into<br />
this region.<br />
JOURNALIST: the end of a long what do you count<br />
as big gains in the economic sphere and what do you count<br />
Oas areas of disappointment?<br />
PM: The gains. Obviously the gains have been the opportunity<br />
now in four countries to establish very close and warm<br />
personal relationships at the top level. It's just impossible<br />
I believe to overestimate the significance of that close<br />
personal contact. I've been able to do that now in<br />
the Republic of Korea, in Thailand, in Pakistan with<br />
its new leader, and of course to renew what is well known<br />
as an extraordinary close warm friendly relationship<br />
I have with your Prime Minister. Out of the renewal<br />
and strengthening of those contacts that will come in each<br />
country, and certainly here in India. a renewed impetus<br />
to economic relations between our countries. Further<br />
in the economic field we have been able to share in each<br />
of those countries and certainly it's true here, our<br />
commitment to the cause of pursuing a freer international<br />
trading environment. I think I have succeeded, and I<br />
* will be saying it again today in the Indira Gandhi Memorial<br />
Lecture, I think I have succeeded in each country I've<br />
been in establishing what I refer to as the paradox of<br />
our time. That paradox is one that we should be very<br />
conscious of. It is that at no point in post war history<br />
has there been more ground for optimism that the super<br />
powers have entered a period of sane, intelligent, forwardlooking<br />
inter-relationships in the way they go about<br />
their affairs. There is now more cause for optimism<br />
that we can live in a world at peace. The paradox is<br />
that at the very time when they are displaying that sort<br />
of intelligence the major market based economic super<br />
powers are engaging in economic insanity, which if pursued<br />
will have the capacity to undo all the good work that's<br />
been done in the political field. Because if the world<br />
is allowed to degenerate into a series of protectionist<br />
trading blocs then, as I've said, history shows that<br />
that sort of economic ) 4UT# 1rOy is the precursor of political<br />
conflict. That is the great paradox and in a sense potential<br />
tragedy of our time. I believe that in this trip we<br />
have been able to have the opportunity in these countries<br />
of talking about this issue, understanding the reality<br />
of it, and agreeing that we should harness not only our </p>
<p>PM ( cont): own capacities but use our best endeavours<br />
with like minded countries to make the economic super<br />
powers, which really we're talking then about Europe.<br />
North America and Japan, but particularly the United<br />
States and Europe, that we've got to make them see sense.<br />
The time is critically short. The Montreal mid-term<br />
review was in December, it was disastrously inadequate.<br />
The talks in a formal sense resume in April in Geneva.<br />
So we are now in a critical point of time where all the<br />
best efforts of our countries and those with whom we<br />
deal need to be focussed on making sure that that MT<br />
round is rescued. That I think has been one of the major<br />
benefits of the trip. I've said in terms of the bilateral<br />
relationships we've also been able to enhance those in<br />
each of the countries I visited. You asked what have<br />
been the minuses. I must say it's very difficult to<br />
find any and I say that not in credit to myself but I<br />
say it most particularly in tribute to the attitude of<br />
the countries I visited and of course, not least, the<br />
attitude I've received in this country from your Prime<br />
Minister through to your minister, your bureaucrats.<br />
everyone with whom I and my party have had to deal.<br />
There's been an attitude of positive, constructive cooperation<br />
and friendship which well for the future.<br />
JOURNALIST: You have just returned from Pakistan. The<br />
situation in Afghanistan is getting worse and worse every<br />
day despite the Soviet Union of the withdrawal of<br />
forces. Arms are being continuously given to the rebels<br />
of what is normally called Mujaheddin. What is your<br />
view, what talks you had with Ms Bhutto and what hope<br />
do you seen for Afghanistan now?<br />
PM: Let me briefly put it this way. Obviously I had<br />
talks with Ms Bhutto and her ministers about this issue.<br />
They are optimistic that there can be an outcome which<br />
will involve they say a form of government not, as they<br />
put it, including the elements of the existing regime<br />
in Kabul but people that they describe as good Muslims<br />
if I could put it that way, it's their description.<br />
They have a degree of optimism that out of the processes<br />
of discussions that are going on at this stage that<br />
there will be able to emerge a government that will be<br />
effective and that that can be achieved without significant<br />
bloodshed. I hope they're right but as you say on the<br />
evidence that exists at the present time there must be<br />
some considerable cause for concern. The real tragedy<br />
of course for not merely Afghanistan but the region would<br />
be if having seen the end of the conflict in terms of<br />
the presence of the Soviet troops and the conflict between<br />
Soviet troops and the regime which they backed and the<br />
Mujaheddin on the one hand. If you now have that replaced<br />
by another form of internecine conflict, as far as Australia<br />
is concerned, we don't exaggerate what we're able to<br />
do about that. Our commitment, which I'm proud to<br />
I I </p>
<p>PM ( cont): reiterate, is that already we've given some<br />
million in Australian dollar termsfin humanitarian<br />
assistance we've committed ourselves to a further<br />
million to the United Nations humanitarian relief program.<br />
So as far as we ' re concerned we're going to do everything<br />
we can to address the issue of trying to develop the<br />
people who have been displaced and hopefully are going<br />
to be able to return to Afghanistan. There is now a<br />
very great obligation we believe upon the super powers,<br />
upon the signatories to the Geneva accords to make that<br />
work in a way which is going to minimise conflict. I<br />
think it would be totally unrealistic to expect that<br />
there's going to be an outcome totally devoid of conflict.<br />
The obligation~ s upon all of us to try and reduce that<br />
to a minimum.<br />
PM: You have a liberal immigration policy but you are<br />
Oimplementing it you are not very liberal in that<br />
way. PM: On what do you base that?<br />
JOURNALIST: Taking immigrants from India, what is Australia's<br />
policy? you don't want the coloured ones<br />
PM: You've been listening to the wrong people. This<br />
is a very good question and I'm glad that it's one on<br />
which I can conclude. It's a very important question.<br />
It is the truth, it is the fact that Australia for a<br />
very long period had an immigration policy which was<br />
based upon racial discrimination. It was appropriately<br />
described as the White Australia Policy. It was in my<br />
judgement and fortunately increasingly in the judgement<br />
of Australians as we came to the latter part of the 1960s<br />
it was a morally unacceptable policy. And to the great<br />
credit of both sides of Australian politics in that period<br />
of . the 1960s we put the White Australia Policy behind<br />
US. romthat point immigration into Australia was not<br />
based on race, there was no discrimination in it. That's<br />
remained a feature, a bipartisan feature of Australian<br />
politics. Unfortunately last year there was some deviation<br />
from that view on the part of the conservative side of<br />
politics in our country but my Government has remained<br />
and will remain totally committed to a non-discriminatory<br />
policy. You can rest assured that as far as Australia<br />
is concerned the White Australia Policy is part of the<br />
history books. There will be no discrimination on the<br />
basis of race and no discrimination on any other basis.<br />
So we set an intake figure which is the order of $ 150,000<br />
for this annual period, and within that, as I say, no<br />
discrimination either against Indians or anyone else.<br />
That is the Australian position and will remain the Australian<br />
position. ends </p>
