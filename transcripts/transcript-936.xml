FOR PRESS P. M. No. r7/ 1264<br />
DEATH OF MR. NEHRU<br />
Tribute by the prime Minister, the Rt. Hgn. Sir Robert Menzies<br />
This is a significant date in history. It marks<br />
the close of the life of one of the most remarkable men of our<br />
time. Mr. Nehru was the maker of modern India. He had<br />
survived, with a singular balance of mind, both hardships and<br />
successes. He occupied a place in the hearts and hopes of his<br />
hundreds of millions of people which it will not be easy for<br />
any successor to attain. His great gifts and his unceasing and<br />
positive interest in world affairs gave him a notable standing<br />
in world negotiations and conferences.<br />
When the Commonwealth Prime Ministers meet in<br />
London in July, it wil1l be difficult to realise that he has<br />
gone, and that we shall see and hear him no more.<br />
CANBERRA,<br />
