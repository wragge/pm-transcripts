THE PUBLIC SERVICE<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister, the Rt. Hon,<br />
Sir Robert Menzies, in the House of Representatives<br />
on Tuesday, 1h-th May, 1963.<br />
I do not propose to take very long to deal with<br />
what I must say is one of the most half-hearted attacks I<br />
have heard my friend, the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr.<br />
Colwell) make. Indeed one might weJ~ l be pardoned for<br />
speculating why this matter was brought before this House<br />
when it is coming before the Commonwealth Conciliation and<br />
Arbitration Commission on 28th of this month. Is the idea<br />
that the commission will be threatened and conditioned in<br />
advance? This is in the teeth of all arbitration principles.<br />
The fact about this present matter it is worth<br />
reciting is that the case will come before the commission<br />
on 28th May, The reference of the case to the full commission<br />
was made at the request of the Commonwealth Public Service<br />
staff associations. I have already made it clear that, as<br />
distinct from a former occasion when we were experiencing<br />
very acute inflationary pressures when this matter comes<br />
before the commission the Commonwealth does not propose to<br />
intervene. The matter will be contested and thrashed out<br />
between the Public Service Board which, for this purpose,<br />
is the employer and the Public Service organizations.<br />
The honourable gentleman's idea of the arbitration<br />
for which the people for whom he offers to speak have asked<br />
is that the matter should be heard on 28th May and that there<br />
should be no intervention by the Public Service Board except<br />
for the board to say that it agrees to everything for which<br />
the staff associations have asked. Really, I begin to wonder<br />
whether if he had the power, he would, in all the other<br />
applications which will crop up to extend the metal trades<br />
margins decision to other industries, tell the respective<br />
employers that they were not to intervene at the hearings<br />
except to say " Yes". This is a fantasy. I am real1~ shocked<br />
that a man who aspires to be the Prime Minister of Xis<br />
country, and would then be responsible, as I am technically,<br />
for the Public Service administration, should be prepared to<br />
foment an idea of this kind.<br />
Of course he went back a little and stated that in<br />
1952 we introduced legislation which the Parliament passed,<br />
to provide for an appeal procelure or a reference procedure<br />
to the full Arbitration Commission. Why did we do that? We<br />
did it to produce some consistency of results. The honourable<br />
gentleman rather conveniently forgets if he will allow me to<br />
say so, that many people employed by the Commonwealth are<br />
doing exactly the same kind of jobs as are people employed<br />
in a variety of private industries. The oldest game in the<br />
world of industrial arbitration, with which I used to be<br />
extremely familiar, is to jack It up by getting an award from<br />
a limited tribunal and then telling the general tribunal that<br />
it must apply the provisions of that awar'd generally, otherwise<br />
there will be anomialies and industrial unrest. I suppose those<br />
expressions are still being used. o9esooee./ 2 </p>
<p>-2<br />
We knew that there would be industrial unrest and<br />
anomalies unless some procedure was established under which<br />
there was co-ordination of decisions. There had to be<br />
co-ordination of the work of individual commissioners, There<br />
had to be suitable -procedures for references to the full<br />
commission so that the full commission could co-ordinate what<br />
was being done by the individual commissioners. We felt that<br />
in the same way, on appropriate occasions the commission could<br />
be charged with the responsibility of producing some co-ordination<br />
of what it was doing and what the Public Service Arbitrator<br />
was doing. 14e still have the Public Service Arbitrator,<br />
Listening to the honourable gentleman's speech, you would think<br />
we had abolished the Public Service 4rbitrator. Listening to<br />
the honourable gentleman's speech, with its somewhat tenuous<br />
logic, you would think we had abolished all the individual<br />
commissioners under the arbitration system. Of course we have<br />
not. We have provided for co-ordination of their work and for<br />
the determination of the big baoic problems at the top level,<br />
How any one can complain about that, I do not know.<br />
How on this occasion the Public Service associations can<br />
complain retrospecti; vely to 1952, 1 do not know. Their<br />
self-appointed spokesman, the Leader of the Opposition, has<br />
said to us " You did a terrible thing in 1952. You wretched<br />
people wanted to produce some consistency between decisions<br />
over a wi~ e field," Now his complaint is that there is not<br />
to be consistency over a wide field, When we say, on the<br />
application of the Public Service unions themselves, that we<br />
will go to the commission -the commission that made the first<br />
decision and allow it to determine what should happen in<br />
these matters, they say, " That is a funny th~ ing to do unless<br />
you agree to go to the commaission and tell it to do what we<br />
want it to do," That is a pretty strange proposal and all<br />
the more strange when one remembers that subsequenZ to the<br />
legislation of 1952 we had in 195' 9-60 the increase in<br />
salaries margins if you wish to use the more precise term.<br />
That matter wont to the full bench of the commission on the<br />
application of the public service association, just as this<br />
present application has. So apparently the now rule as<br />
stated by the Labour Party, is: Ask for the matter Zo go<br />
to the commission and do your best to get it on in time. The<br />
unions cannot claim that we have held up their application on<br />
this occasion. The application will be heard on 28th May,<br />
The Labour Party then says, " Use parliamentary representatives<br />
to frighten members of Parliament or to have the commission<br />
itself feel that there is a great switch of opinion against<br />
it." We must be timidl<br />
Mr. Speaker, I have noticed in the local newspaper<br />
a large and costly advertisement inserted by the Administrative<br />
and Olrical Officers Association of the Commonwealth Public<br />
Service. I must say I have had a happy experience of Commonwealth<br />
civil servants. I have not mot one of the typo referred<br />
to in the advertisement and I would refuse to believe that<br />
such people represent a majority of the men who work so<br />
faithfully and so objectively, not only for this Government<br />
but for the country as a whole. It is a novel experience for<br />
me to be told, " Come down quietly or we will convert ourselves<br />
into a political pressure group." A letter has been circulated,<br />
and a copy of it has been handed to me by my friend..<br />
Mr, Peters Who is your friend? 00 0 0 a </p>
<p>-3<br />
SIR ROBERT MENZIES The honourable member for Ryan ( Mr.<br />
Drury). The letter is a fascinating document. I do not know<br />
a single Commonwealth civil servant who could have stooped to<br />
write " Should I not obtain salary justice on this<br />
occasion through the persistence of the Governmentts<br />
attitude I must point out that as a retaliatory<br />
measure I will cast my vote against you in this<br />
electorate at the next election."<br />
Do you suppose I will lose any sleep over that<br />
threat? If I were any other honourable member of this House<br />
I should take as an insult the suggestion that I could be<br />
frightened into changing my public pclicy persuaded but<br />
frightened by these foolish threats. I do not believe for a<br />
moment that more than a tiny percentage of Commonwealth civil<br />
servants wouldcb'eam of saying, not only to us, but also to<br />
all the other people of Australia who outnumber them:<br />
' Yb are not concerned about the great issues<br />
that affect the safety and growth of the country.<br />
We are not concerned with any matter of public policy<br />
except our salaries. Give us what we are after."<br />
Mr. Haylen They did not say that,<br />
SIR ROBERT MENZIES : They did say that, At least that is<br />
what the few people reponsible-for this concoction say. They<br />
say, " 1Unless you do what we want in this regard, we will<br />
convert ourselves into a political pressure group and vote<br />
against you." As far as I am concerned they are welcome to<br />
vote as they think proper. If I were in their place I should<br />
hesitate before I set myself at variance on these matters with<br />
the rest of the Australian people, but that is a matter for<br />
these people themSelves to determine, All I want to point out,<br />
and in the simplest possible terms, is that these threats proceed<br />
in relation to a matter which in a fu) w days will be before the<br />
lawful tribunal the very tribunal that has already dealt<br />
with the margins applica-tion in the metal trades case. That<br />
tribunal will not be pressed by the government of the country<br />
by way of intervention. It will thrash the matter out and<br />
will arrive at a conclusion, Following its invariable practice<br />
the Government will accept the tribunal's decision, Is this<br />
a threat that somebody else will not accept that decision?<br />
This is something now. r I do not for one moment believe that<br />
such an improper exercise of the forms of this House designed<br />
solely to bring influence to bear on the tribunal will have<br />
the sympathy or support of either the general public of<br />
Australia or of 95 per cent, of members of the Public Service<br />
of the Commonwealth. </p>
