F77/ 196<br />
FOR PRESS 8 SEPTEMBER 1977<br />
GLADSTONE POWER STATION<br />
The Prime Minister, the Right Honourable J. M. Fraser, and<br />
the Premier of Queensland, the Honourable J. Bjelke-Petersen,<br />
announced today that agreement had been reached on a request<br />
by Queensland for the provision of further assistance to<br />
Queensland for the Gladstone Power Station.<br />
The Prime Minister recalled that under the Gladstone Power<br />
Station Act 1970, the Commonwealth had provided financial<br />
assistance of $ 140 million as the agreed Commonwealth share<br />
of the cost of the initial four generating sets. Such<br />
assistance had been provided in the form of loans at concessional<br />
interest rates. The Act under which these funds<br />
were provided required the Commonwealth to participate in<br />
funding only in respect of expenditure up to 30 June 1977.<br />
The Premier had requested additional funds towards an amount<br />
of $ 47.4 million which remains to be expended to finish the<br />
first four sets of the power station. Such request involved<br />
Commonwealth support for a special addition to his State's<br />
semi-Government borrowing programme of $ 25 million over the<br />
next three years.<br />
Mr. Fraser said that the Commonwealth would be pleased to<br />
support a Queensland application to the Australian Loan<br />
Council for this special allocation. </p>
