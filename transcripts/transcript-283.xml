PRESS CONFERENCE<br />
Given by the Prime Minister, Mr. Menzies in London<br />
On March, 19th. 1961<br />
Mr. Menzies: I notice that there is a good deal of speculation<br />
and perhaps something more about the final stages of this<br />
conference so perhaps I might as well add my own little bit to<br />
its For some time it looked as if we could evolve a form<br />
of communique u~ hich would confirm South Africa's membership<br />
while at thc same time containing a fair summarised statement<br />
of the criticisms of South Africa's racial policy and of Dr.<br />
Verwoerd's reply. In point of fact, as I have followed<br />
this, and I took a very active part in it in drafting various<br />
things, Dr. Verwoerd wias at first very reluctant to adopt the<br />
form of communique that was suggested because he felt that it<br />
was too much like a concerted judgment on South African policy,<br />
the language, he thought being put in a rather too positive<br />
way. Ultimately after considering his position he agreed that<br />
tho communique should go out in that fashion. And, quito<br />
frankly, I thought at that time that the problem looked as if<br />
it wure over. But when he announced, or Mr. Macmillan announced,<br />
that he was agreeable to a communique of this kind he was<br />
promptly told by several of the Prime Ministers that it was not<br />
good enough. One or two of thien indicated quite plainly that<br />
they didn't accept his continued membership; that if it<br />
became necessary to move for the expulsion of South Africa they<br />
would do so. At least half the Prime Ministers there made it<br />
clear that they would pursue this matter every time there was<br />
a meeting, and between meetings on any convenient opportunity.<br />
In other words looking at the substance of the mattei', at<br />
least half the Primo Ministers there indicated that thoy didnot<br />
want South Africa in.<br />
Dr. Verwoerd, I thought with very groat dignity,<br />
accepted the logic of that position and indicated that he<br />
would withdraw his application. Porsonally I don't think he<br />
had any choice. I would have withdrawn the application in his<br />
place. One reason that I know that he had in his mind I<br />
thought did him very great credit, and that was that if he<br />
had remained and in some way or other his application for<br />
continued nienbership had been agreed to I don't undertake to<br />
say how it could have been under these circumstances, but<br />
suppose in some way or other it had then he would have<br />
remained in and would have divided his colleagues into those<br />
who would co-ntinue to want to be rid of him and those who would<br />
continue 2/ </p>
<p>L6968/ 9<br />
-to want to have South Africa as a member of the Commonwealth.<br />
And-rather than expose the rest of us to that risk he decided<br />
to. rzv. e-his appliation . and avoid that possibility.<br />
I think of course this is the most unhappy affair.<br />
-1 make no secret of my own view. I wanted to keep South Africa<br />
in. Last year at the conference we all agreed that South<br />
Africa's racial policy was a matter of domestic jurisdiction.<br />
We all agreed and that was why we didn't discuss it in full<br />
conference. Quite true there has been a good deal of international<br />
argument about it since but it will be remembered<br />
that the former Prime Ministers' Conference was after the incidents<br />
Sharpeville and after there had been world wide reaction and<br />
we all agreed upon that occasion that this was a matter of<br />
domestic jurisdiction. This year Dr. Verwoord indicated<br />
that he would waive that point for once because he thought<br />
that we ought to clear our minds about the question of policy.<br />
He dy'd not abandon the proposition that it was domestic but<br />
he ' aid " very well I am prepared tc sit in here and now and<br />
have an argument about it" and he expressed his own case very<br />
powerfully I may say at considerable length.<br />
But even though there has been a great deal.<br />
of international agitation this is still a matter of domestic<br />
policy in South Africa.' South Africa does not seek to apply<br />
that policy to any other country. It is as much a matter of<br />
domestiu policy for South Africa as Australian migration policy<br />
is a domestic matter for us. And to have a member of the<br />
Commonwealth virtually excluded from the Commonwealth on a<br />
matter of domestic policy presents, in my opinion, a ratherdisagreeable<br />
vista of possibilities for the future. We may<br />
object very strongly to racial discrimination practiced in<br />
one country. We might equally object very striongly to the<br />
absence of any form on democracy in nnothor. / 3 </p>
<p>V<br />
-c' I1.6968/ 69<br />
We niight--take,-exception to the absence of Parliamentary machinery<br />
or the presence of imprisonment without trial or any uf these<br />
things that lend themselves to examination if we adopt the<br />
attitude that one or our tasks is to examine each others policies.<br />
A-d--that is why-think this is a ver unhappy development.<br />
It is quite true that in fact every Prime<br />
Minister, except the Prime Minister of South Africa was critical<br />
of all or some aspects of South Africa policy. I dont need to go<br />
into that with any elaboration but I have up to now acted on the<br />
principle which I believe is sound that I do not make public<br />
comments on the oolicies of another member of the Commonwealth.-.._<br />
A very good old fashioned rule that, and did a let of good when<br />
it used to be practiced. But since the things is all out now<br />
and this has been thrashed out and most people have made statements<br />
about it I just want to say this: my objection to the policy<br />
of apartheid is in simple terms that in my opinion it won't<br />
work. It is a policy ofsapearate development, it is a policy<br />
that the white ran occupies the superior position. In other<br />
words it is the same policy that existed in all colonial<br />
establishments until a few years ago. The South African Prime<br />
Minister says and with great sincerity he is a man of singular<br />
* integrity a most impressive man he says wo are spending far<br />
more money on education and health for the Bantu population<br />
than any other African community. That is quite right. He<br />
-had figures to support it. He indicates that every step is<br />
being taken' to raise the living standards and the educational<br />
standards of the Bantu. That is very good. Excellent.<br />
But I don't believe that when that object has been achieved<br />
the Bantu is going to be satisfied and adopt the second rate<br />
position in the general social struoture in South Africa or in<br />
the political structure of South Africa. In other words,<br />
the more this policy succeeds in a sense, the more certain is it to<br />
fail in the long run. Now that is a puroly practical<br />
objection. I haven't, like some, moralised about this matter.<br />
That, if brief is my view as to why their policy is wrong.<br />
Of course it has some to me inexplicable detailed<br />
Sconsequences. Mr. LHenzies continued " I told Dr. Verwoerd I just<br />
didn't begin to understand why he adopted the views that there<br />
should not be an exchange of diplomatic missions with other<br />
African and Asian members of the Cormmonwealth. I said we did that<br />
kind of thing very successfully in Canberra and nobody seemed to<br />
be very concerned about it. We ate in each others houses . nnd co.. on,'<br />
but he had his own reasons and he said " no, it couldn't be done.<br />
I thought that psychologically that had a bad effect. You<br />
know that seemed to be carrying it a bit too far.<br />
Q( UESTION: How do you see the future relationship of South<br />
Africa with other Cormmonwealth countries?<br />
ANSWER: Well I'm very troubled about it because a lot<br />
of people don't understand anything about the Conmmonwealth;<br />
they seem,-to think the British Commonwealth is a court of morals<br />
or of law. You sit down and sit in judgment on each other. It<br />
never was So. You meet to discover what you agree about </p>
<p>I. 6968/ 9<br />
not to discover-what you disagree about. I spoke about<br />
this'las-t--yar in the Smuts Lecture; we are not sitting in<br />
judgment on one other; thatts not the point. We can talk<br />
very intimately and frankly with each other. We learn a lot<br />
from each other. Occassionaily you go away and find your<br />
mind has been influenced more than you thought by something that<br />
Was said, but there it is. Apparently techaracter-ofour<br />
eliberations are to be changedc--I--th'hk it a great pity, but<br />
in particular this is the last time we will ever have a discussion<br />
on racial policy in-the Commonwealth itself,/ Anmeeting of Prime<br />
Ministers. South Africa is out unless, of course, somebody wants<br />
to discuss the racial policy of some other member of the<br />
Commonwealth. But so far as South Africa is concerned, we will<br />
iever have a discussion of this kind again. Now the discussion<br />
-is going on, the passions of other people were roused on this<br />
matter and they won't be silenced. But instead of having the<br />
discussion in a meeting of a limited number of Heads of Governments<br />
who are men of experience and restraint, this thing will now be<br />
put into the United Nations; it will be debated hotly in the<br />
General Assembly; it will transferred in other words to areas<br />
where there will be much loss restraint and much more passion,<br />
and I think that is a great pity.<br />
There is one other point I would like to make<br />
about my approach to this refusal of membership or expulsion.<br />
Your dontt admit a Government to the Commonwealth, you admit<br />
a Nation to the Commonwealth. The other day we didn't' admit<br />
Archbishop Makarios, we admitted Cyprus; and one of the<br />
foundation members of the Commonwealth is South Africa South<br />
Africa, the nation. We diCdnt admit only those people who had<br />
a vote, to wit the Europeans, we admitted the whole who included<br />
nine millinn BTlntu. True, they don't have the vote. But there<br />
are one or two other Commonwealth countries in which the voters<br />
are by no means in the majority let us put it as delicately<br />
as possible. Your don't, in due course put out the Verwoerd<br />
Government, you put out South Africa all of its people.<br />
How do we know whether the Bantu as they come along, are not<br />
very very hopeful of such protection as they get by the<br />
Commonwealth association? I don't know, but I can guess that they<br />
might be. How do we know what the attitude is of people who are<br />
for the time being, in the minority among the voters; people<br />
who support the opposition in South Africa. Governments come<br />
and go.-That is a very healthy reflection. But in effect South<br />
Africa has gone, including all those who are pro this policy and<br />
those who are against the policy, and those who are pro the<br />
Government and those who are against the Government. And I think<br />
that misconceives the nature of the Commonwealth. The<br />
CoQmnLiwalthas--I -have'kn ow' it for many years at any rate.<br />
Question: What was the answer to that argument, Sir?<br />
Answer: The answer was a lemon. That didn't<br />
cut any ice.<br />
Question: Do you think that she's out for good now? </p>
<p>5 1.6968/ 9<br />
Anmswer: " Well frankly I do, If-I were being very tactful now,<br />
I would sayr '" Well of course, in a year or two, you will be<br />
back-with-s". The world doesn't work that way, nor do I think<br />
that this decision is likely to have a tempering effect upon<br />
South African racial policy. It may very well stiffen their<br />
attitude, I don't know. I hope not. But it's possible.<br />
Question: Dr. Verwoerd has referred to enomoaus attacks from the<br />
f ricAans, Asians and he also incl_ ud-eC'-anada.<br />
Answer; No, I won't name any namos, but certainly the nost<br />
extremo speeches were made-at the very closing stages at this<br />
time wh_ I though. t-wo were probably going to get by with a<br />
statement of-the criticisms, Dr. Verwoerd's answer, and continuance<br />
of membership. Venomous is not my word, but there were very<br />
pungent attacks made then as I said.<br />
Question: Sir, on this precedent, do you fear any attacks,<br />
possibly oh Australia's nigration policy?<br />
Answer: Well, once the precedent is established, its obviously<br />
a possibility.<br />
Question: Was there any hint of that?<br />
Answer: Oh no. Nobody. They all concentrated this'time on the<br />
one thing. I made a glancing reference to it myself.<br />
Question: What would our attitude be if?<br />
Answer: That is like " If you had a brother would he like cheese".<br />
I can't answer that one. I know what mine would be and they know<br />
what mine would be; but leave it at that. I might not be there.<br />
Question: In the case of Australia, sir, our own future<br />
relationships with our new foreign government I take that the<br />
High CorLmission will take on another diplomatic status?<br />
Answer: Yes, We've never contemplated any of those things like<br />
boycotts or things of that kind. Somebody did suggest very<br />
powerfully that we ought to boycott South Africa so I sent around<br />
word to find out what things we bought from South Afric., What<br />
were the main items? When I got the answer back, it turned out<br />
that ninety per cent of the people engaged in the production of<br />
those things were black people, I said I didn't think there was<br />
much sense in penalising these fellows under the guise of helping<br />
them. I don't think economic measures are going to be taken in<br />
Australia, certainly not by us.<br />
Question: Is there any indication how other members of the<br />
Commonwealth might feel about the continuation of Comonwealth<br />
preferences; they apply mainly of course to Britain. We know that<br />
they do give South Africa the same privileges in the British<br />
market as we enjoy and Now Zealand.<br />
Answer: I would be guessing if I tried to speculate about that.<br />
No doubt there will be a lot of consequential nmtters that have<br />
to be looked into. I don't think nost of us have h. ad time to<br />
think about those yet.<br />
Question: Mr Menzies, two or three of the Sunday papers today<br />
refcr to the possibility of a visit by the Queen to Australia<br />
fairly soon. I wonder if you ha. ve any comment on that?<br />
./ 6 </p>
<p>6 I, 698/ 9<br />
Answer: When was aStfwr fay paper without that story? You know<br />
my rule-on this jmttor. I an having a general discussion with<br />
the Queen abou-tR-Royal visits in the general, you know, trying to<br />
look ahead, but that's as far as its gone. But any announconent<br />
of those things to be made is to be made, as always, by the<br />
Palace, not by me. Nor do I wrant to infer that we e r likely to<br />
have any_. arly visit by a member of the Royal Fanily, I have a<br />
list of requests that I brought with ne that I an going to discuss<br />
with the Queen next week.<br />
Question: Can you give any indication, sir, as to when the name<br />
of the new Governor General will be announcod?<br />
Answer: No, I wish I know the nare of the new Governor General.<br />
Until I know that, I can't put a timetable on it.<br />
Question: It still hasn't boon settled then,<br />
Answer: No.<br />
Question: Will you be seeing the Queen again before you leave?<br />
Answer: Yes.<br />
Question: Do you know what date?<br />
Answer: I think it's on Friday.<br />
Question: Coning back to the conference, Mr. Monzies, there is<br />
a reference from Melbourne saying that there is a debate boiling<br />
up now on you taking the load in arguing the constitutional<br />
objection to interference in South Africa's internal affairs,<br />
that you may have taken on yourself a role which will be<br />
difficult to explain to our Asian neighbours. Do you foresee<br />
any. difficulty in that?<br />
Answer: Not at all. That sounds almost like one of the Sydney<br />
papers which has a bee in its bonnet on that problem, I must say<br />
I find no difficulty whatever in explaiinng nyself to our African<br />
and Asian neighbours in Conference. None. We are cn the best of<br />
terns. Anyhow, ny principal duty and role is to express the nind<br />
of my own Government, not the nind of other Governments. When<br />
I am no longer able to do that, I will go out,<br />
Question: Mr. Menzies can you tell us anything of your discussions<br />
with Dr. Luns of the Dutch Government on the future of Dutch<br />
New Guinea?<br />
Answer: No.<br />
Question: Will yci nake any comment, sir, on the latest position<br />
of Wst Now Guinea?<br />
Answer: As far as I know, the position is as it was. There's<br />
been no change, our policy has been stated tine after tine.<br />
There's no chanog in that.<br />
Question: It seens to be a little hotter than it was.<br />
Answer: Well you ] now we keep on getting stories about that,<br />
anyhow I h-. ve nothing to say about that. </p>
