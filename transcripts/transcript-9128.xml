PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW WITH THE PRIME MINISTER, THIE HON, P J<br />
KEATING, M. P. AND SIR BOB GELDOF<br />
MIDDAY SHOW, CHANNEL 9 STUDIOS, SYDNEY<br />
TUESDAY 22 FEBRUARY, 1994<br />
DH: Welcome back. Some big changes to the way that Parliament operates in Canberra<br />
today. For the first time, Paul Keating has an RDO, a rostered day off. He's not in<br />
Parliament as formally required because of a change to the system. A change that he<br />
wants to have, has made possible. So, the ringmaster is absent from the circus and<br />
that's why Prime Minister Keating can be our guest today. Would you please welcome<br />
the Prime Minister of Australia.<br />
DH: It is true, the first day the ringmaster hasn't been there for Question Time?<br />
PK: It is the first, well, in 25 years.<br />
DH: 25 years. Why?<br />
PK: Oh I think it just became a stale format where the focus was only on the leaders and<br />
one or two other people and that was it, basically. It lost the opportunity for ordinary<br />
backbench members and, I think, general interests that is the eliciting of information<br />
and general interest by the public.<br />
DH: But you were regarded as the King of Question Time. You were the, almost the<br />
serpent in the House. Won't you miss that?<br />
PK: No, I don't think so. There was a time when Question Time provided the rank and file<br />
backbench member the chance to raise things which were of genuine and local interest<br />
to them. Now, all the questions are scripted by both sides.<br />
OH: Yes, because your people also throw Dorothy Dixers.<br />
PK: That's what I mean by scripting scripted to suit the general policy lines that either<br />
side of politics wants to get out on the day. So, this way I think it will be far more<br />
spontaneous, more natural and therefore better. </p>
<p>DH: But it's not being... it won't be televised now, will it?<br />
PK: Oh yes, it will still be rebroadcast. That is, on the news services or later but it won't be<br />
live in the afternoon because...<br />
DH: It runs into Play School...<br />
PK: It runs into Play School..<br />
DH: One play school has been replaced by another, you might say.<br />
PK: It runs into Play School and the ABC says Play School stays and Question Time<br />
doesn't.<br />
DH: Yes, somebody is making some decisions there. Now, on the SBS with Mary<br />
Kostakidis the other night, some people would think they were watching a different<br />
person. I mean, here's a Paul Keating who is saying he's humble, is saying, virtually,<br />
he's modest, that he doesn't want to be remembered as a great Prime Minister?<br />
PK: Well, no. One of the questions was, " Are you there to be a great Prime Minister?"<br />
Well, that's for other people to judge. I'm there to do what I have to do. But, I think,<br />
Derryn there are sides to my personality which are not always evident in the same<br />
way you've switched from haridhitmi iiiiiestigative journalism to a more open, warmer<br />
format here which is revealing a different side to your personality there's a different<br />
one to mine, too.<br />
DH: Yes but I don't have any power, you see, you're the Prime Minister. But when you see<br />
the Paul Keating that people know and you can be I'll blow your bags here a bit, for<br />
a minute you can be very urbane and you can be very charming company and you<br />
talk well at cocktail parties and all that sort of stuff.. but then you get into the House,<br />
on the floor there, and you say the Liberals are like dogs returning to their vomnit, you<br />
call people scumbags, sleaze bags, all of that.<br />
PK: No but, hang let me just correct that. I've used scumbag once in 25 years, once,<br />
once.<br />
DH: Well, I never said shame, shame, shame and I got hooked with it...<br />
PK: And, you see, the House of Representatives is the central cockpit of Australian politics.<br />
It's where the big issues are fought over and when people want to, if you like, change<br />
policy whether it be in health or in education or in social security this is the place where<br />
I defend the interests of ordinary Australians. I mean, if somebody...<br />
DH: And your party and your Ministers...<br />
PK: Yes, but, if somebody wants the right to have elective surgery or to have their hip<br />
replaced and they don't have private wealth Medicare is there to help them do it. Now,<br />
when that's under attack I'm fh-ere to defend it so you can't go in and say, " This is all<br />
blase, we don't really care. We don't really care whether access and fairness in health </p>
<p>or in education goes. If the Liberals want to make assaults on these things I won't fight<br />
it." 1<br />
DH: But you've actually been defending your own Medicare against one of your own<br />
ministers, Graham Richardson. He thinks you should have private health coverage as<br />
well.<br />
PK: Medicare is like any other national scheme, it's evolving. It has to evolve. And, as<br />
private health is more sophisticated than it was a decade ago, as technologies improve,<br />
as all of these diagnostic imaging and things improve the system has got to change with<br />
it. I think all that Graham and I are now looking at is how we change that system and<br />
keep the best.<br />
DH: Speaking of systems, we had Senator Kernot on the program the other day talking<br />
about women in politics and do women get a tougher time in Parliament from men,<br />
because they're women, or do they get an easier ride because they're women? How do<br />
you regard it?<br />
PK: I don't think they get any tougher or easier ride, by and large.<br />
DH: Because you've jumped to the defence of Ros Kelly very fast and very loudly...<br />
PK: Yes I did on a couple of occasions where I thought the notion of drowning her out as<br />
she was trying to give a serious reply someone had made an allegation and she was<br />
up replying to it and then being drowned out by a front bench of noisy characters<br />
was unfair. And, therefore, I made that point at the time.<br />
DH: Do you believe she had 2,000 names on a whiteboard?<br />
PK: Well, what I believe is that because nobody in the Opposition's actually held down a big<br />
job, apart from John Howard and Andrew Peacock, no-one's been a minister and<br />
they've never held down a big job so they don't know that ministers make 50, 60, 100<br />
decisions a day. It's not a case of little notes from bureaucrats which you tick and<br />
cross. It's a sort of a naive, childish view of the world, ministers are there to make<br />
decisions.<br />
DH: One final question on Ros Kelly doesn't it smell to you when a minister is going to<br />
give a $ 60,000 grant to bowling club of 100 people and it gets to $ 100,000 by the end<br />
of the Comcar ride?<br />
PK: No, basically because this is a facility for those sports clubs that can never basically get<br />
that sort of money together. Be it in netball or basketball or bowling or whatever...<br />
DH: I'm not opposed to grants. But I am saying the way it is distributed...<br />
PM: Yes, but, in the end if they eligible and all of these are eligible a decision has got<br />
to be made then about whether the grant works, or whether it is designed well enough<br />
or whether it is enough. On this occasion Mrs Kelly made that discretionary change. </p>
<p>But that is the power that a Minister has. I mean who else does it? I mean, who else<br />
do we have in the system to do it?<br />
DH: Will she survive?<br />
PM: Oh, of course. Survive? She had them for breakfast a week ago.<br />
DH: All right, speaking of political survival. If you, Paul Keating, had a Labor Bronwyn<br />
Bishop coming after you like a barracuda, how would you deflect it?<br />
PM: By making the obvious points about her, I think. And that is, I mean why has the<br />
Liberal Party not taken Bronwyn on? I mean is she as notionaily popular? But there is<br />
resistance to having her. Why do the people who know her best, why won't they take<br />
her? And the answer is, because she has got no policy depth. It is all tip and no<br />
iceberg. Now, that is what they understand.<br />
DH: But, she is a populist, and Bob Hawke proved as a populist that he could go above the<br />
heads of his party in Canberra, and look where it got him.<br />
PM: Yes, but Bob had a framework in his head about the society, the economy, that<br />
Bronwyn Bishop doesn't have. And it rankles the Liberal Party's parliamentary party<br />
that somebody who has basically made it by weekend magazine reviews, and middle<br />
newspaper reviews, and television magazine reviews, has climbed over them without<br />
earning the right to do it in terms of knowing about the structure of this country and<br />
society.<br />
DH: I would agree with that, I have said before and to her, on television, that in Canberra<br />
she is so popular she would get three votes in a Caucus leadership vote if she was<br />
allowed to vote for herself three times.<br />
PM: That's right. It's a nineties version of the Joh for Canberra campaign. At the time when<br />
Joh was running for Canberra all the conservatives were all in a tizz saying, oh, this will<br />
be terrific. Nobody, today would seriously have thought that Joh would have ever,<br />
have made a contribution. Now, she is the nineties Joh for Canberra version and the<br />
serious people in the parliamentary Liberal Party are saying, well hang on, there is an<br />
entry price here, you have to know what the economy and the society is doing and how<br />
to change it.<br />
DH: And you have to know where Manila is.<br />
PM: Yes, you have got to know where Manila is.<br />
DH: Which she didn't know. Now, on a personal thing, will we ever know what happened<br />
about the housekeepers at th-e Lodge? Because I read at the weekend that your<br />
daughter sent Gail Gray a birthday card, that they used to walk the dogs and worm the<br />
dogs and even cut your hair on occasion. </p>
<p>PM: Yes, we had a nice relationship. Well, look it is now largely a matter which is between<br />
the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet who employs them and the<br />
Commonwealth Ombudsman is now running through..<br />
DH: But you didn't have a clash and say, " Get them out of here"?<br />
PM: No, no. I never had a cross word with them. But there were obviously problems<br />
amongst the staff.<br />
DH: There were factions.<br />
PM: Well the Department sort of sorted it out, and their argument is with the Department<br />
and the quicker that is resolved the better.<br />
DH: All right, we have saved something up for after the break, I am going to talk about<br />
your serious career as a rock and roll manager, and we are going to come back with Sir<br />
Bob Geldof.<br />
PM: Well, he is a rocker.<br />
H: Welcome back, I wonder how observant you are because during the commercial<br />
break the Prime Minister just said to me, " Do you realise we are wearing identical<br />
suits?" It's like two women at the races.. but the ties are a little different.<br />
PM: Let's keep an eye on the detail...<br />
H: That's true, that's true. We have been talking to Paul Keating and I guess he'd<br />
agree that my next guest would be pretty formidable in the political ring but Bob<br />
Geldof s not interested in joining that boxing troupe. Instead he uses his songs to<br />
sway the world and his clout to get interviews with heavies like Yasser Arafat,<br />
Nelson Mendela, Desmond Tutu and Paul Keating. So, to reunite a couple of<br />
interesting Irishmen, please welcome Sir Bob Geldof.<br />
BG: I thought I'd wear the same suit...<br />
DH: No chance that you were going to risk that.<br />
BG: Well, it's the Italian cut, knew you guys were into it so...<br />
DH: With these careers you have, the charity work you've done, one your main career<br />
of course as a singer and entertainer, suddenly here's this breakfast television<br />
host...<br />
BG: Yes, mega tycoon I think, media tycoon, that's the new thing.<br />
DH: Now, you interviewed the Prime Minister?<br />
PK: He did, about a year ago. </p>
<p>DH: And, although he's sitting there, what was it like?<br />
BG: Oh, it was a pain in the arse, you know.... No, it turned out we have some mutual<br />
friends in London and it turned out we shared some...<br />
DH: Liz and Phil..<br />
BG: Of course, yeah... . and the guys generally, you know. And so, that was a pretty<br />
good basis and..<br />
PK: He's a toff, Bob. He's a tofft you know.<br />
BG: Who me?<br />
PK: You.<br />
BG: Yeah but I don't try and hide it Paul, you know.<br />
DH: When you interview all these people, I mean, Arafat, Mandela, Keating what were<br />
they like to interview? I mean, your life hasn't been from that school of journalism<br />
so you would come from a different perspective. What were they like?<br />
BG: I only said I'd do it if the people interested me. It wasn't necessarily their political<br />
agenda, it was that there seemed to be some moral stance that they took, vis a vis<br />
their politics.<br />
DH: What was his? Keating's?<br />
BG: He just interests me as the classic Paddy, Tanimaney Hall politician.<br />
PK: Hey, cut that out, you'd better decipher all these terms...<br />
BG: It's the Irish-Catholic, union, Labor, mass sort of...<br />
DH: Like in Boston and al that sort of stuff, the Tammany Hall stuff?<br />
BG: I'm not sure I like it but I come from it, you know, from Dublin. And so over here<br />
is very recognisable to me and he's an immensely robust politician, you know.<br />
DH: Did you believe he was humble, didn't want to be a great Prime Minister, didn't<br />
care if he was remembered by history?<br />
BO: Well, you know, some of the things I say when I do interviews are for a specific<br />
reason and some of the things he says are for another reason. I mean, he does<br />
interviews to get across his agenda and I'm more interested in the person. I'm not<br />
a political look at those shoes, can we have a close up.<br />
DH: Do you like those? </p>
<p>BG: Look at Hinch's shoes.<br />
PK: Well your's are exactly...<br />
BG: Well I've been in Mildura. I've just been in Swan Hill, I mean, you know.<br />
DH: That explains it. Mildura explains that.<br />
BG: Look at them, oh no they're Keating's ones.<br />
DH: At least they're shiny.<br />
BG: Well, they don't have to be those sneakers Derryn, I mean, you remember that<br />
don't you? But, like I said, the politics in this country are immensely robust.<br />
DH: Well, you being Irish, do you feel for the strength of the Keating argument for a<br />
republic?<br />
BG: That's his thing, I'm also in somebody else's country so to me I don't really care,<br />
it's your argument as, you know, Prince Charles said. But I come fr~ om a republic.<br />
Now if you shut up for a minute, if you can just manage that.<br />
PK: Well so far I have.<br />
BG: Can anybody nanme a President of Ireland who isn't Irish. It's very hard to<br />
remember who the President of Germany is or the President of Ireland, even<br />
though she's immensely a bright woman and very charismatic and I think republics<br />
are a bit of a bore. And I've lived in one all my life and I understand your<br />
argument about the Monarchy and all that, but I think it would be quite good to<br />
have this sort of Australian King and I think that, Paul, you would look very nice.<br />
DH: Swap the vermin for the ermine you think?<br />
BG: I would have that as tongue in cheek. I'm not sure that a republic has that time<br />
and that politics hasn't gone. And as you are consciously looking forward to the<br />
next millennium.<br />
DH: Your upbringing. You had a fairly sad childhood, didn't you. In terms of your<br />
mother dying when you were very young. I'm just wondering, you both being<br />
[ rish, both being Catholic. You said in your SBS interview that your religion is<br />
very strong for -you.<br />
PK: Well I think it has set a lot of political values for me and for Australia, certainly in<br />
the Labor Party.<br />
DH: And yet, Bob, you are very anti the church in a lot of the things you have said over<br />
the years. </p>
<p>BG: Unlike Australia, the Church and the state are hand in glove in Ireland, maybe less<br />
so. But certainly when I was growing up it was. And it was a very close society<br />
and young people, in particular, were not allowed to you have it here the tall<br />
poppy syndrome thing which you have sort of elevated into this national shiboleth<br />
sort of thing. And you weren't allowed to express ambition, even that was to<br />
cause derision. And so all possibilities shut down on you because of this<br />
claustrophobic small country, society. And so I had to get out and loads of us<br />
blame that relationship that did exist between church and state. It's becoming<br />
disentangled now rightfully.<br />
PK: Well, of course, that's not true here. I mean, what Bob says about Ireland may<br />
well be true, but it is not true here. There has always been a great separation.<br />
DH: Actually the separation of church and state has been almost as virtually strong here<br />
as the United States where it is protected virtually constitutionally.<br />
PK: I think the sort of great humanitarian values of the Labor Party spring from a<br />
sense of equality and justice and these things spring from the dignity of the human<br />
person which has come from...<br />
DH: But the Labor politicians can play just as dirty as anybody else.<br />
PK: But it is always this question about, you know, the classic conflict in Australian<br />
political thought between what Manning Clark called the enlargers of life and the<br />
straighteners of life.<br />
DH: You see, what intrigues me about you is this very thing, you are a person who in<br />
your life has built to be this urbane person, a lover of classical music, and Bob<br />
gave you some classical music, you collect antique clocks, you love fine art, you<br />
certainly like bird prints, but then the other side of you is that you are a political<br />
bovver boy...<br />
BG: He's a street brawler.<br />
DH: But then you are a bovver boy, in other ways you are a bovwer boy.<br />
PK: Yes, but principally what I am, I am basically a builder of a better place here. That<br />
is what I am principally about. I mean, what's my life about it's about enlarging<br />
the show.<br />
BG: Well your idea of a better place.<br />
PK: Well, not my idea. Simply a better place, that is a fairer, more just, more decent,<br />
more productive place.<br />
BG: But everyone in politics is that, they just use a different format.<br />
PK: No, but everybody says that, Bob, but they don't all do it. I mean, the difference<br />
is, we have done it. </p>
<p>BG: They do try, you just won the last election, Paul, that's all.<br />
PK: I know, and that has come, those instincts, I think, in part have come through this<br />
sort of society we have and it has also come through the sort of belief people like<br />
me have had.<br />
DH: Would I be right if I said that Paul Keating, when he made his speech to staff at<br />
the Chinese restaurant before the election last year, thought he would be in<br />
opposition the following day, and thought you would be out of politics?<br />
PK: No, I thought we would sneak in. I thought we would sneak home. But when I<br />
say sneak home, for a start we had an I11 seat lead, a majority of 11. And that had<br />
to be whittled back before anything camne from us, so I knew we were going to do<br />
well in Tasmania and NSW.<br />
DH: So you really thought you would win it?<br />
PK: I thought we were in there with a real chance.<br />
BG: When I was talking to him, you know, it looked very grim indeed. And said to<br />
him, you know, you may as well kiss goodbye to this place. He just said wait and<br />
see, you know, he was pretty insistent then.<br />
DH: Because you looked like stunned mullet for the first few months after you had<br />
been elected as if you thought, gee we haven't got any policies cause we didn't<br />
think we would be here.<br />
PK: Well, it is just because the Government ducked back into the Cabinet to do the big<br />
things like Mabo and other things which we had on that year. I mean, the problem<br />
is we were running against a couple of deadlines and having already lost three or<br />
four months of the year, we had to basically get our heads down and get at it.<br />
Now that was assumed to be that the Government had sort of lost control of the<br />
agenda.<br />
DH: On British politics, I'm sure this doesn't happen in Canberra..<br />
BG:..... plug by music, he's plugged by politics.<br />
DH: No, I'm going to in one minute, this will plug in music as well, I'll hold this up<br />
while I'm talking about British politics.<br />
BG: Along side your shoes please. It's the Cuban look, you know.<br />
DH: It is too. Why is it in British politics, so many of the politicians dress up in<br />
women's dresses, and these are the men, or there was one guy who was found<br />
hanging in a gas mask and an overcoat in his shed, and another one had on<br />
women's stockings and suspenders and a plastic bag over his head. </p>
<p>BG: Because they have to get their kicks somehow, it's so boring in the house of<br />
parliament. You know, have you ever sat there? I mean, when Thatcher went it<br />
would probably be like him, you know, the fire went out of the street politics.<br />
And what you were earlier talking about women and whether they got, no pun<br />
intended, an easier ride or a harder ride. And the thing that Kinnock always said,<br />
who was leader of the opposition during Thatcher's reign, that he felt always<br />
pulled back because he came from the Welsh valleys and he was sort of brought<br />
up to respect women, and he always pulled back from the killer insulting blow.<br />
Even though he loathed everything she stood for, he just couldn't bring himself to<br />
go.<br />
DH: Well speaking of strange dressing habits, would your weirdest gig in music have<br />
been the Goondiwindi bachelors and spinsters ball? And what were you doing<br />
there?<br />
BG: It was one of the best dresses. Because I'd heard about B&amp; S things and being<br />
Irish they struck me as familiar. This used to go on in Ireland like, while I'd grown<br />
up. And I went there and had a great time, I mean, these people got seriously out<br />
of it.<br />
DH: Is it true that that is going to be seen on British television?<br />
BG: But, so what?<br />
DH: Well I think Sylvania Waters was bad enough. They'll think this is going on<br />
everywhere.<br />
BG: Nobody watched Sylvania Waters, and these are young people who are in a<br />
drought land area and they have had drought for years, they still have drought.<br />
And as they say on the film, at the beginning of the film, it is a time where we can<br />
forget our troubles for 48 hours and go back to work with a fresh hope. And<br />
these people are walking off their farms now. They've sold their car, the banks are<br />
closing and they walk away, it's like the dust bowl in Okalahoma. And they have<br />
got immense dignity and they should be allowed to get out of it for 48 hours and<br />
the great thing about it, unlike an english audience where I would feel fear and<br />
danger, that never went off in any violent sense. And I think, in Europe that they<br />
probably would.. the naive, the sort of, cliche salt of the earth, but their values<br />
are so fixed and straight and generally good, I thought it was great.<br />
DH: Now, let's talk about your music. You are making a new clip with Sting who has<br />
been singing for you on Crazy, that's coming up on your new compilation.<br />
BG: Yes, the single thing. So I did that about four weeks. . the Pinnacles, do you<br />
know where that is? North of Perth, have you ever been there?<br />
PK: I've never been there.<br />
BG: I've seen more of Australia than you and you're supposed to call it a stump. </p>
<p>PK: I don't think that is true, but I haven't been to the Pinnacles, no.<br />
BG: Twenty-five cities and towns in 30 days. You know, Goondiwindi gave me the<br />
taste for it, of seeing the country. And he said you should move over here, you<br />
know. And I said, well it's 60 per cent marginal tax, sure.<br />
PK: Forty-seven, forty-seven.<br />
BG: Not if the Left have their way.<br />
DH: You have fallen in love with this country, haven't you, you spent a lot of time here.<br />
BG: Yes, its a beautifuli country. Me and the Mrs and the kids are made for it and were<br />
it not for the fact that<br />
PK: What do you like about it most?<br />
BG: It is very familiar to me, the attitude.<br />
PK: It's open, accessible.<br />
BG: Yes, all that. The attitudes are very familiar to me from Ireland.<br />
DH: Being both Irish Catholics, both family men, how do you handle, as Bob Geldof,<br />
the disciplinary things with your kids?<br />
BG: Beat the crap out of them on a day to day basis.<br />
DH: How do you? I mean you are growing up, the rock world, the sex, the drugs,<br />
the rock and roll, and you see your own little kids growing up. How do you<br />
handle it and how do you guide them?<br />
BG: Like any parents you give what you believe are the correct moral parameters to in<br />
which to live to your life. And then you hope that at 13, 14, and 15 they kick<br />
robustly against that and find their own way. And like, you know, you say you<br />
can't do that, you are not allowed to do that, you have to go to bed at this time,<br />
you know, you have to behave, you have to show respect et cetera, et cetera.<br />
DH: Do you work this way?<br />
PK: I think so. I think you try and give your children, as Bob said, a moral framework,<br />
or moral parameters which, hopefu~ lly enough of that glues on to them so as they<br />
go their own way there are these residual values which they then rebuild and build.<br />
DH: But do your children still see you, are you two people to them, I mean are you at<br />
a Prime Minister Keating to your family, or are you still just Dad?<br />
PK: No, no. Just Dad. I had my second youngest saying, what are you going to do<br />
when you get out of politics, Dad? She said, you want to be a composer, don't </p>
<p>you? And of course, I don't, you know. And before I got a chance to say<br />
anything she said, well I think you had better forget that because you would be a<br />
dud composer.<br />
DH: Do you stand around at home and conduct?<br />
PK: Yes, I conduct a bit a home, she might have got the conducting and the<br />
composing mixed up. No, I think I like to see the kids personalities, jumping<br />
around and springing and going.<br />
DH: When will you get out of politics, how many years?<br />
PK: I think there is a natural time in all this. You get the right message.<br />
DH: Will you know when to go?<br />
PK: Oh, I think so. And I don't think anyone should try and stay on too long.<br />
DH: Like Bob Hawke.<br />
PK: Well, anyone.<br />
DH: Who are the megalos, the megalo Prime Ministers you were talking about?<br />
PK: No, we are not in the identification business.<br />
DH: Menzies, Whitlamn, Hawke?<br />
PK: We are not identifying.<br />
DH: Two out of three ain't bad. Hold on, here it is again, this is a Bob Geldof new<br />
happy club. You are not looking very happy on it.<br />
BG: I am not a very happy person, you can tell I am deeply disturbed.<br />
DH: I will make you happy now, by doing some of Bobs concert dates.<br />
BG: The ex-rock manager should do this.<br />
PK: Yes, I should be.<br />
BG: Failed rock manager.<br />
PK: As I say, I could probably do for Bob what I did for the Ramirods, send him into<br />
obscurity.<br />
BG: It is an unfortunate name.<br />
DH: Mr Prime Minister? </p>
<p>13<br />
PK: Well, if Bob gives me a piece of the action, I mean I am not going to manage him<br />
for nothing.<br />
DH: Will you please thank Prime Minister, Paul Keating, and Bod Geldolf.<br />
