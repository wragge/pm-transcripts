AU SrRALIA k<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 5 JUNE 1988<br />
JOINT STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER AND THE MINISTER FOR<br />
THE ARTS, SPORT, THE ENVIRONMENT, TOURISM AND TERRITORIES,<br />
SENATOR GRAHAI RICHARDSON<br />
Australia is to sign an international treaty aimed at<br />
protecting the ozone layer.<br />
Australia will sign this week the Montreal Protocol on<br />
Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer, one of a series of<br />
actions which the Commonwealth is taking to protect the<br />
ozone layer.<br />
Action to protect the ozone layer is high on the<br />
environmental agenda of the Commonwealth Government. We are<br />
confronted by an environmental problem with global<br />
implications and firm measures must be taken now.<br />
Senator Richardson will shortly be putting to Cabinet a<br />
proposal for legislation to control Ozone depleting<br />
chemicals. It is intended that this legislation, which<br />
would implement the provisions of the Montreal Protocol,<br />
will be passed later this year. However, Australia should<br />
not necessarily confine action to meeting the particular<br />
requirements of the Montreal Protocol. These should be<br />
regarded as the minimum. All practicable steps should be<br />
taken to reduce emissions of ozone depleting substances.<br />
The ozone layer in the upper atmosphere screens out most of<br />
the harmful ultraviolet light from the sun. This radiation<br />
causes skin cancers and other health problems. Also it can<br />
damage plants, including farm crops, and aquatic life.<br />
Emissions into the air of some man-made chemicals, mainly<br />
chlorofluorocarbons ( CFCs), damage the ozone layer. CFCs<br />
are used in some aerosol sprays, in refrigeration and air<br />
conditioning units, and in the production of some plastic<br />
foams.<br />
Under the Protocol, Australia will be required to freeze the<br />
consumption of CFCs at 1986 levels, beginning from next<br />
year, and to progressively cut their use by half over the<br />
next ten years. 2/ 2I </p>
<p>The Government is concerned by recent scientific discoveries<br />
of dramatic losses of ozone over Antarctica for part of the<br />
year, with CFCs being an important cause of the so-called<br />
ozone hole. In addition, measurements of ozone over the<br />
rest of the globe are now indicating small ozone losses<br />
caused by CFCs.<br />
Australia will press to ensure that the provisions of the<br />
Montreal Protocol are revised as necessary in the light of<br />
the most up-to-date scientific findings. All countries must<br />
act together in a positive way to ensure that the ozone<br />
layer is protected. The first review of the Protocol will<br />
be completed by 1990.<br />
The Commonwealth will continue to work closely with State<br />
Governments and industry in ensuring the progress of the<br />
proposed national legislation on protection of the ozone<br />
layer.<br />
We look forward to the cooperation of other political<br />
parties when the legislation is introduced into the<br />
Parliament. 0 () 69 8 </p>
