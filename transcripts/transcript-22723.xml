<p>The Prime Minister will visit Jakarta and Bogor Indonesia, from 4 to 5 July at the invitation of President Yudhoyono to attend the annual Indonesia-Australia Leadersâ Meeting.</p>
<p>Indonesia is a close friend and neighbour and one of Australiaâs most important bilateral partners. Our countries enjoy a close and dynamic relationship based on mutual respect, shared democratic values, and a common interest in building a stable and prosperous region.</p>
<p>Our bilateral relationship is one of Australiaâs most broad-based, spanning business, education, defence, security and people-to-people links. </p>
<p>Indonesia is an important commercial partner for Australia, with two-way trade valued at $14.6 billion and Australian investment in Indonesia valued at $6.8 billion in 2012. </p>
<p>Our countries work together regionally and globally, including as fellow members of APEC, which Indonesia is chairing this year, and the G20, which Australia will chair in 2014.  We also cooperate closely in the East Asia Summit.</p>
