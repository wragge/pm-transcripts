HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES aA<br />
16TH MAY, 1967<br />
THE OUTCOME OF THE KENNEDY ROUND TARIFF<br />
NEGOTIATIONS<br />
I can tell the House that I have just this morning been<br />
informed by Mr. McEwen from Geneva that the Director -General of the<br />
G. ATT has announced that agreement has been reached on the elements of<br />
a successful Kennedy Round. This is the outcome as at present seen of<br />
negotiations over some four years and, even on the limited information as<br />
yet available, can be said to represent a major success in reducing barriers<br />
to world trade. As Honourable Members will know, this important series<br />
of negotiations was initiated by t he late President John F. Kennedy with the<br />
obj ective of achieving a significant liberalisation of world trade covering<br />
all classes of products, both industrial and agricultural. It is in relation<br />
to agricultural products, of course, that Australia has been most concerned<br />
to achieve better trading conditions.<br />
After the difficult negotiations of the past few weeks in<br />
Geneva, it is gratifying that the major traders of the world have been able<br />
to reconcile their conflicting interests and to reach agreement on arrangements<br />
which offer benefits not only as between themselves but also to the<br />
less developed countries of the world. I understand that the net effect of<br />
the Kennedy Round could be a reduction in tariffs in the industrialised<br />
countries of the order of 3L-per cent. covering trade to the value of some<br />
$ pUS-, billion. It is not yet possible to provide Members with full details<br />
of the overall settlement reached in Geneva. In fact, discussions on some<br />
items of importance to Australia are continuing. I can, however, say that<br />
with respect to one of our major export commodities wheat we have<br />
achieved more satisfactory arrangements than at various stages of negotiations<br />
seemed attainable. Agreement has been reached which will ensure that<br />
world wheat marketing will continue on an orderly basis and within the<br />
framework of internationally agreed rules of trading.<br />
A new minimum price has been established some 2C cents<br />
per bushel above the minimum in the present International Wheat Agreement.<br />
This in itself i. s a worthwhile gain. It establishes a new floor for world wheat<br />
prices. At present we are, of course, selling our wheat above this level<br />
in world markets and we hope that we shall continue to do so. But it is<br />
reassuring to know that if a situation of world surpluses were to emerge,<br />
we have the protection of a higher and firmer floor price than we have had<br />
up to the present. Furthermore, the price arrangements are such as to retain<br />
Australia's competitive posit-Lon in world markets. </p>
<p>-2-<br />
Another important element of the agreement on wheat is<br />
the acceptance by the developed countries including the EEC, the UK and<br />
Japan, that they should share equitably with the wheat-exporting countries<br />
the burden of providing food aid. This is a principle which Australia has<br />
been pressing ever since the commencement of the Kennedy Round<br />
negotiations. The new arrangement will mean that the food-producing<br />
countries of the world will no longer be looked to alone in providing this<br />
food aid. At this stage, I am not in a position to inform Honourable<br />
Members of the details of the negotiations on meat. Detailed discussions<br />
are in fact still proceeding in Geneva but our delegation is confident that<br />
valuable gains will be achieved in our meat trading arrangemehts.<br />
Moreover, in the totality of the Kennedy Round there will be other benefits<br />
which will assist a number of other Australian industries. Details of these<br />
benefits will be made available when the negotiations have been concluded.<br />
It is the nature of international negotiations in which<br />
conflicting interests must be reconciled ard a balance of advantage struck,<br />
that governments cannot achieve all their negotiating objectives.<br />
Nevertheless, what has been achieved in the Ken nedy Round represents<br />
a real move forward in the whole area of international trade, and one<br />
from which Australia can expect to derive important trading benefits. </p>
