ELECTORATE TALK<br />
The high level of unemployment in Australia is of continuing<br />
concern to the Government, as it is to the community as a whole.<br />
Unemployment is a dispiriting experience that not only undermines<br />
self-respect but creates social problems. Its effects are not<br />
just confined to the person unemployed, but they are felt throughout<br />
the whole structure of family life. High unemployment cannotand<br />
will not be solved overnight. No single action by the<br />
Government any Government can wipe the slate clean.<br />
It is possible for government to follow a misguided policy and<br />
try and spend its way out of trouble. But bitter experience has<br />
shown that this kind of action boosts inflationary expectations<br />
and worsens unemployment, while business tends to pull in its<br />
belt even further. Unemployment can be reduced on a long term<br />
and sustained basis. This will be done as wage demands are<br />
moderated and as the rate of inflation continues to come down.<br />
Australia's manufacturers and businesses will not employ high cost<br />
labour at the present time particularly unskilled labour when<br />
they can cut their costs by buying labour saving machines. It is<br />
a fact of life that businessmen will opt for this course rather<br />
than pay high wages for unskilled labour.<br />
Government policies can, however, lay the groundwork so that<br />
industries are in a position to maintain the level of their workforce<br />
or even to increase the number of people they employ.<br />
over the past few weeks, as a direct result of Government action<br />
and initiative, employment opportunities for many thousands of<br />
Australians have been safeguarded. We have saved jobs.<br />
When I was in Europe recently talking to the European Economic<br />
Community's Commissioners about trade with Australia, I was<br />
asked to agree to a voluntary 25% cut on Australia's steel exports<br />
to the Common Market countries. I did not accept that request. I<br />
argued that Australia, through supplies only a very small<br />
amount of steel to the European markets and on fair and competitive<br />
terms. A few days ago I was gratified to learn that the E. E. C. had<br />
in fact withdrawn this request. This decision is good news for<br />
Australia. it will, I believe, prove important for the maintenance<br />
of existing jobs in Newcastle, Wollongong and Whyalla centres of<br />
great steel manufacturing activity. / Last week, </p>
<p>-2<br />
Last week, the Government also decided to place special<br />
restrictions on the number of passenger cars that could be<br />
imported into Australia. This decision was made effective<br />
immediately. The decision was in line with our long-standing<br />
policy that Australian industries share of our local market<br />
should not fall below 80%. We decided that import quotas for<br />
the next six months would be based on a total annual quota of<br />
90,000 cars. The Government has asked the Industries Assistance<br />
Commission to recommend what further action we should take in<br />
this area. The decision to impose special quotas was made only<br />
after careful examination of the present and potential car<br />
import situation. We concluded that immediate action was<br />
necessary to prevent severe disruption to employment in local<br />
industries. In other words, we wanted to protect jobs in the<br />
industry to the extent that this is possible.<br />
Early next month I will be attending a meeting in Kuala Lumnpur<br />
with the Heads of Government of the five ASEAN nations and the<br />
Prime Ministers of New Zealand and Japan to discuss a range of<br />
trade and other issues. Apart from consolidating our overall<br />
relations with ASEAN and individual ASEAN countries, this<br />
meeting will be of particular relevance to Australia's<br />
manufacturing industries and jobs in those industries.<br />
I will be explaining Australia's policies in relation to<br />
imports, and how they affect our own industries. Trade<br />
between Australia and ASEAN is buoyant and has been for some<br />
time. In fact, it has grown rapidly over recent years.<br />
For instance, since 1970-71 total imports from ASEAN into our<br />
country have increased at an annual rate of 29%, while our<br />
exports to ASEAN have increased at a rate of 17%. ASEAN<br />
countries are winning an increasing share of our overall<br />
import market particularly in manufactured goods. Since<br />
1970-71 imports of manufactured goods have increased in value<br />
from $ 47 million to $ 221 million. This average annual growth<br />
rate of 36% is more than double the growth rate of our total<br />
Australian imports of manufactured goods.<br />
What needs to be clearly understood is that this increase has<br />
coincided in the last few years with a period of economic downturn<br />
in Australia. Accordingly, some Australian industries<br />
which of course means many companies which were already facing<br />
cost pressures found themselves in increasingly difficult<br />
situations. Jobs were lost while others were put at risk.<br />
But, rather than ban imports of products in sensitive areas,<br />
like textiles, and footwear as some countries may have done<br />
in a similar situation the Government has acted with restraint<br />
and moderation. We took steps to limit and not prohibit<br />
imports. We recognised we did have obligations to our trading<br />
partners in ASEAN as well as to our own industries. / Our policy </p>
<p>3<br />
Our policy is clear. In the short term with Australian<br />
jobs on the line, increased market access for ASEAN goods<br />
in the sensitive areas poses real problems for Australia.<br />
However, in the longer term, developments in the Australian<br />
economy are almost certain to create additional trading<br />
opportunities for ASEAN countries.<br />
I make it clear that the Government is sympathetic to the<br />
particular trading problems of ASEAN. Indeed, there are<br />
many we share.<br />
A special working group of ASEAN and Australian trade<br />
experts set up to discuss trade is unmistakable evidence<br />
of our willingness to overcome trading difficulties.<br />
I look forward to the meeting with the Heads of Government<br />
in August. I am sure it will play a significant role in<br />
promoting and fostering relations between Australia and<br />
our ASEAN neighbours. </p>
