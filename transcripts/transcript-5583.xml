FOR MEDIA SUNDAY, 10 MAY, 1981<br />
ELECTORATE TALKOver<br />
the last two weeks the Government has taken a number of<br />
decisions designed to set Australia firmly on course for<br />
the 19.80s and beyond. These decisions relate to the Review<br />
of Commonwealth Functions, the new health arrangements, and<br />
the new financial arrangements-with the States determined at<br />
the Premiers' Conference last Monday.<br />
The Government is determined that Australia not go the way of<br />
other countries whose prosperity and future have been undermined<br />
by ever-growing bureaucracy and ever higher taxes.<br />
We are at a very important stage of Australia's development.<br />
Australia is a country with great prospects provided we take<br />
wise and responsible decisions now. This is a time when we<br />
must establish the framework for the economic growth and<br />
development on which Australia's future depends.<br />
our aim is to see that Australia has a high rate of economic<br />
growth which will provide rising standards of living through<br />
higher incomes. We aim to achieve g rowth through lower inflation<br />
and greatly expanded job opportunities. This growth will provide<br />
increasing resources to support improved assistance to those in<br />
need, tp education, to the arts, to health, to the environment.<br />
It is the pre-condition for so many other of our objectives.<br />
Australia can only achieve these goals if Government is modernised<br />
and streamlined and made more efficient; if bureaucracy and<br />
over-regulation are reduced and if the tax burden can be lightened.<br />
They can only be achieved if we realise as a people that there<br />
is not~ a limitless supply of money to do all that we want, all<br />
at once, that we must establish priorities and direct our rescurces<br />
to the most important needs of the time.<br />
To achieve these objectives it is vitally important that Gover-nment<br />
does not take too many of the scarce financial resource. whicl7.<br />
private enterprise needs in order to develop and create Lhe jobs<br />
we all want to see. By exercising responsible restraint over<br />
Government spending, we free money for other needs of greater<br />
priority. And by rationalising Government functions we open uip<br />
new opportunities. ./ 2<br />

I mention particularly here our decision to establish a new<br />
institute for energy research which I announced as part of the<br />
Review of Commonwealth Functions. Energy is a top national<br />
priority for the Government, and a new institute will make a<br />
major contribution.<br />
Our new health arrangements also reflect the philosophy that<br />
Government should concentrate its help on those who really<br />
need help. We do not believe that taxpayers' money should be<br />
used to pay unnecessary subsidies to the well-to-do. Labor's<br />
health scheme proved far too costly, it created unnecessary<br />
centralisation in the administration of health care, and it undermined<br />
the effective provision of medical services. We do not believe<br />
in undermining individual responsibility by centralised 3<br />
bureaucracy, nor do we believe in schemes which must be paid fo~ r*--<br />
by higher taxes, disbursed by officials, rather than by individuals<br />
who know their own needs best.<br />
We believe that where the user-can afford to pay, the user should<br />
pay and have the influence that comes from paying. We reject<br />
the assumption that Canberra knows best, that officials know best,<br />
and that it is Government, not individuals, who should control<br />
the payment of doctors and hospitals. Our scheme is designed to0<br />
encourage a system of voluntary insurance. We are confident<br />
CPhat this scheme will improve the efficiency of our health system<br />
and its responsiveness to individual needs.<br />
If taxes are to be reduced to the greatest extent possible, thiLs<br />
is not a matter for the Federal Government alone. If inflation<br />
is to be reduced to the maximum extent possible, the Federal<br />
Government alone cannot achieve this. Federal Government policies<br />
can provide the conditions for success or lead to failure in the<br />
achievements of these objectives, but their full realisation<br />
depends also on the co-operation of the States and of individuals<br />
around Australia.<br />
At the Premiers' Conference we took the view that the greatest<br />
possible restraint should be followed in the interests of<br />
Australia's taxpayers. The States and local Government are the<br />
final spenders of just over 50% of the tax dollars collected<br />
in Australia. Reducing the tax burden, achieving higher economic<br />
growth, more jobs, and lower inflation requires a high degree of<br />
restraint and forward thinking on the part of all Governments.<br />
The Victorian Government has recently established a Ministerial<br />
-group of a kind similar to our own Review of Commonwealth FunctLions<br />
to examine State spending and activities. I know that all<br />
Victorians will welcome this initiative. Likewise the South<br />
Australian Government has established a deregulation unit in<br />
the Premiers' Department. It is very encouraging that other States<br />
are also planning for the future.<br />
The real question is for the Commonwealth and States togeth. rer<br />
to establish the conditions under which there can be a responsible<br />
lightening of the tax burden in Australia as economic growth<br />
picks up. The Commonwealth's policies of restraint and forward<br />
thinking have already set us firmly on that course. / 3 </p>
<p>-3-<br />
From the first of July this year the indexation tax cut as<br />
a consequence of our election commitment will give to Australia's<br />
taxpayers some $ 500 million that would otherwise be absorbed<br />
by Government. The new health arrangements provide for a tax<br />
rebate to those who take out private insurance. The costs of<br />
these rebates to the Government's revenue will be of a similar<br />
order to that of half tax indexation. These tax concessions<br />
are possible only because of the policies which the Government<br />
has followed.<br />
The maintenance of these policies over the next few years will<br />
make possible a further lightening of the burden of taxation I<br />
in Australia, a further reduction in the size of Government, and<br />
a considerable increase in Australia's economic strength and<br />
prosperity. The decisions of the last few weeks have set Australi A<br />
firmly on course to a strong and healthy society. They will help<br />
to secure to Australia a place in the world that we all wish<br />
her to have. 000---</p>
