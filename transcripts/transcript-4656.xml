PRESS OFFICE TRANSCRIPT 21 M~ ARCH 1978 -76-/-2b+ 1<br />
INTERVIEW WITH JOHN ANDERSON, ABC'S COUNTRY HOUR<br />
QUESTION: Prime Minister, what is your assessment of the current<br />
drought situation?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I am not too sure to what extent rain over the<br />
last 24 hours has altered the situation, but before that in some<br />
parts of Australia its certainly very very serious indeed. When<br />
I was in Riverina a few days ago it was very plain that the drought<br />
there was worse than anything that had happened since the 1944-45<br />
drought. There are properties that have had no stock on them<br />
for many months or even over a year. People have left their<br />
properties and on some there are no sheep left, others have sheep<br />
away on agistment. It's grim and one of the problems that<br />
makes it hard is that the costs of owning the property now are<br />
much greater than they used to be and the reserves the producers<br />
once had just no longer exist.<br />
QUESTION: Is the current Commonwealth State Agreement on Drought<br />
Aid satisfactory in this situation?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I think it's satisfactory as far as it goes<br />
and I have in recent times announced some extensions of the<br />
sorts of measures that the Commonwealth is prepared to help<br />
finance in relation to the carriage of water or the cost of<br />
installing bores or rehabilitation grants for local government<br />
in matters of this kind, but I have also asked for certain other<br />
matters arising out of the meeting that I had at Deniliquin to<br />
be examined by Commonwealth officials. One proposal for example<br />
is th~ at if a person is unable to carry on on his property then<br />
it should be purchased and leased to a neighbour as opposed to<br />
being sold to a. neighbour. The rationale behind that proposal<br />
was that the neighbour wouldn't have the financial resources to<br />
buy It, wouldn't want to undertake the financial commitment to<br />
borrcaw so that he could buy because so many producers are already<br />
in debt and they don't want to increase an interest ( inaudible)<br />
Basicmally our philosophyis that land should be freehold. In the<br />
partitcular circumstances that have arisen that proposal might well<br />
have imerit and its one that I've asked be put to examination.<br />
QUESTrION: If anybody took opportunity of this move, there would<br />
be some very large landholdings, wouldn't there?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I suppose that could be determined to some<br />
extemt by what was happening in particular localities. No, I<br />
don't think necessarily very large. I think you could find that<br />
sort ~ of thing would be more happening amongst smaller properties,<br />
or snmaller medium-sized properties. I don't think it will be<br />
happomning in the larger properties.<br />
QUEUI'ION: Have you thought, indeed, of making money more<br />
availLable to these producers who are threatening to walk off.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Household support is something which is being<br />
examined. Arrangements were introduced about a year ago but we<br />
./ 2 </p>
<p>know from the number of recipients that it is basically not<br />
working and so the Minister is revising the provisions, revising<br />
the criteria and I hope that something more productive will<br />
come out of that. Apart from matters of that kind, if a<br />
particular person has go too much liability, too much too great<br />
an interest bill, making more money available which is going to<br />
be a loan, which is going to have to be re-paid, isn't going to<br />
be a solution. Therefore, you are either talking about household<br />
support or change of provisions perhaps for farm build-up where<br />
that is appropriate. If loans are appropriate for a particular<br />
person I certainly believe in a drought situation they ought to<br />
be available, and I think by and large they are. But the lack<br />
of profitability has been so much part of the rural scene over<br />
recent times coupled with rising costs and bad seasons. Many<br />
people borrowed as much money as they wanted to and that it<br />
itself is an inhibiting factor and it restricts the approaches<br />
reduces the approaches that the Government might be able<br />
to pursue.<br />
QUESTION: Can I go onto another subject beef exports?<br />
Prime Minister, despite the fact that we have now record amounts<br />
of beef, there are no new markets in the offing at the present<br />
time. Do you view this situation with any alarm at all?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I think in the development of markets it is<br />
a question of improving access, increasing access, largely to<br />
existing markets. I don't want to be held to ransom over the<br />
figures, but I think we export to a very well I know we do<br />
to a very large number of countries and the principal markets-<br />
United States and Japan we're hoping that as season circumstances<br />
alter in the United States and their own killing rate drops as<br />
I believe it must that there then will be an increased demand<br />
for imported beef. Now while Japan has its own internal problems<br />
in relation to the import of beef, we have achieved better<br />
access steadily over the last two years. Quotas have been<br />
increased.. We still have the problem of negotiating quotas<br />
every six months. I think Japan understands our point of view<br />
in relation to that which was the beef trades and long-term trade<br />
and we ought not to have to argue every six months. On the other<br />
hand we need to recognize they also have a domestic problem<br />
which makes a sudden move difficult and while we will continue<br />
to press for what we believe is proper and appropriate we have<br />
been getting better access and approved tonnages into the<br />
Japanese market and that is important to us. The real reason<br />
I think that while we have moved record tonnages and the producers<br />
don't do well out of it is that in terms of total overall suppl'<br />
in Australia there has just been too much on the market compared<br />
to the markets available to our exporters and that's when exporters<br />
have been able to pick and choose there hasn't been much<br />
competition in the markets and while many exporters might have been<br />
doing reasonably well over the last period, as we all know, most<br />
beef producers would have been doing very badly indeed. our<br />
beef numbers are being reduced in Australia so as we are successful<br />
in expanding markets further overseas and as our own beef numbers<br />
fall as a change comes in the beef situation in the United States<br />
I think we might see a quite different supply-demand situation<br />
which certainly ought to find itself reflected in prices for<br />
Australian beef. / 3 </p>
<p>QUESTION: Of course one of the factors that hinders the<br />
further expansion of Australian beef to other markets is of<br />
course you have got to compete with other countries who subsidize<br />
or indeed give credit sales to their own product on the market.<br />
Would you entertain here in Australia putting credit sales on<br />
beef for our markets?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I think its a matter that wants to be closely<br />
examined because as I understand it with trade to the United<br />
States overwhelmingly that's not on a credit sale basis. Now<br />
if you are going to get greater sales into Eastern Europe or<br />
the Soviet Union through credit sales you wouldn't want that to<br />
be spreading to your whole trade in beef. While it's a matter<br />
that I think we ought to look at, I think we ought to look at.<br />
it carefully and not just jump to the conclusion saying yes it's<br />
a good thing to do. I know its a matter that some of the<br />
industries put to us and the Minister and departments are examining<br />
the proposal at the moment.<br />
QUESTION: It's virtually playing the same game that the EEC is<br />
playing with us on the Third World market. They are subsidising,<br />
why can't we?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Credit sales aren't really subsidising. It's<br />
just giving you time to pay and I didn't I think answer the other<br />
part of your earlier question which was getting back to the<br />
question of subsidization. Europe does get rid of its surplus<br />
products, not only in beef and many other primary products by<br />
a process of subsidy. They just ask themselves quite blatantly<br />
what do our producers need as an adequate subsidy to take this<br />
market from whether it might be Australia or New Zealand or<br />
somebody else and that's the subsidy they get. The plain answer<br />
is that a country of 14 million people like Australia can't get<br />
into a competitive subsidy situation with the whole of Europe<br />
over 200 million people. We just haven't got the resources. So<br />
in that area what we have go to try and do is to when Europe<br />
is dumping surplus agricultural products which is what it is<br />
they ought to do it in accordance with certain rules that do not<br />
disrupt the traditional markets of other countries such as<br />
Australia. QUESTION: But don't we have rules. We have GATT. Can't we call<br />
the agreement GATT and say you're subsidising?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: We could call up GATT if it was trade in<br />
industrialized products but I have been trying to make the point<br />
in recent times that international trade negotiations have<br />
resulted in a very unequal situation in trade in all the years<br />
since the last world war, because they have had GATT, they have<br />
made rules, they have applied those rules to what's meant to<br />
be fair behaviour to industrial products but then it screwed<br />
commodities, it screwed agriculture. That's like saying well<br />
everybody's got to behave properly the manufacturers in relation<br />
to the protection of agricultural trade in agriculture you can<br />
do anything you like and therefore GATT doesn't apply overwhelmingly<br />
in this area. I believe that GATT has up to this point helped<br />
Europe, helped North America, helped Japan but it has hindered<br />
fair trade in commodities, it has hindered fair and equal trade<br />
in agricultural exports and this is one of the matters that the<br />
Minister for Special Trade Representations and indeed the who: le<br />
/ 4 </p>
<p>thrust of the Government's trade policy was designed to try<br />
and rectify at least in part.<br />
QUESTION: You would like to see an international formal<br />
agreement taking into agricultural commodities?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I would certainly like to see fair rules for<br />
trade in commodities. I would certainly like to see fair rul~ es<br />
for subsidization of those commodities into other country's<br />
markets. This basically gets down to whether or not the European<br />
community can be persuaded that she ought to change her stance.<br />
I don't think that we can be overwhelmingly optimistic at<br />
Europe's reaction although I think there is a growing recognition<br />
in relation to Australia they do need to make some movement.<br />
The fact that Europe is staying out of the International Sugar<br />
Agreement doesn't all do well for Europe's preparedness to<br />
participate in world commodity arrangements for example.<br />
QUESTION: So you are not really optimistic about there being<br />
a massive change in the EEC attitude?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Not a massive change. We have tried to make--<br />
however we dislike we don't challenge the Common Agriculture<br />
Policy as such. We don't challenge their right to protect<br />
European farmers. We would be very foolish if we did. of course<br />
they're going to protect their farmers, but what we do want are<br />
changes at the margin changes at the margin of their policy which<br />
will allow the possibility of some access of some trade where now<br />
there is often no possibility of trade and at the same time changes<br />
in the rules to their policy as they call restitution. I don't<br />
know how they came to use that name but that's subsidizing service<br />
commodities into export markets and if you could have rules which<br />
would apply when they used that policy so they didn't destroy the<br />
traditional markets of other countries such as Australia and<br />
New Zealand changes at the margin is what we have been after<br />
all along and it'Is on that basis I believe Australia is being<br />
completely and absolutely reasonable. We are not challenging<br />
their right to protect their farmers. We believe at the same<br />
time they ought to give us some capacity to trade with them.<br />
QUESTION: Prime Minister, on the domestic scene you mentioned<br />
the return to the producer the beef producer do you place<br />
much faith in the PJT being able to highlight some of the<br />
anomolies? PRIM4E MINISTER: I think they might well highlight significant<br />
anoimolies between meatworks. I think it will be very interesting<br />
to have this knowledge. If we want the information it will be<br />
quite wrong for me to pre-empt what might come out but depending<br />
upon what it is we might want to discuss it with the states<br />
and see what should be done but we ought to have an investigation<br />
and see what the facts are.<br />
QUESTION: Changing over to tariffs versus bounty and last week<br />
theire was a significant announcement from the minister for Business<br />
and Consumer Affairs, that is, on removing the tariffs or<br />
lowering the tariffs on small trucks or medium sized trucks I<br />
thiink it was and introducing a bounty. Primary producers<br />
organisation saw that as being a change of direction in your<br />
Government and indeed a recognition that indeed tariffs do not </p>
<p>help unemployment. Is that so, and will you be applying it<br />
more so on a wider field?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I don't think its a change in recognition<br />
a change in direction of policy. We've always indicated in some<br />
areas bounties operate better than tariffs. There have been<br />
bounties on tractor manufacture in Australia for many many many<br />
years and I think it depends upon cost analysis in each case<br />
as to what might operate better, a tariff or a bounty. But what<br />
I do say in plain terms is that we've got to treat the Australian<br />
economy as one economy and that attempts to divide it into<br />
manufacturers or employees from manufacturing industry and then<br />
into rural industries in the other is very misguided indeed because<br />
for many of our primary products the domestic market is the<br />
best market. Without tariffs there would have been no manufacturing<br />
industry. Without tariffs there wouldn't have been any domestic<br />
market for our primary industries and when we are talking about<br />
competition I don't really think that Australian dairy farmers<br />
want to see uninhibited imports from New Zealand lamb and New<br />
Zealand butter. I don't believe our potato growers and onion<br />
growers and other producers want to see uninhibited imports from<br />
other countries. If you get to the situation in which the world<br />
price for wheat was lower than the Australian price, would we<br />
want to allow the uninhibited imports of wheat when the world<br />
price was below the Australian sugar price. With all these<br />
things the primary industries are in fact put into a position<br />
where they can have a pretty fair certainty of having most of<br />
the Australian market and they need to understand that there is<br />
an element of protection involved in GATT and I think most of<br />
them do.<br />
QUESTION: But with respect sir, whilst they wouldn't like to see<br />
the competition with their own productthey would certainly like<br />
to see some dimunition of their cost inputs and of course this<br />
move by your Government in the fact of the IAC recommendation was<br />
very much welcomed.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I think that's a good thing. We're not in favour<br />
of high tariffs just for the sake of having higher tariffs but<br />
we do believe the circumstance in which Australia is if we are<br />
going to have manufacturing industry we do need to protect that<br />
industry. I'm only making a point that when people are sometimes<br />
calling for free trade they need to understand that there is an<br />
element of protection in relation to the number of Australian<br />
primary industries which doesn't always come to the fore, but<br />
which is certainly very real and of very great importance.<br />
The manufacturing industry is as diverse as tobacco, sugar,( inaudible)<br />
dairy, wheat and that needs to be recognized.<br />
QUESTION: One last subject if I may sir, and that is union<br />
control of our exports. Your views on it?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: We don't recognize any union bans in relation<br />
to exports and we have no intention of allowing the trade union<br />
to control Australia's exports.<br />
QUESTION: They have in the past.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: They have limited exports in some areas. A number<br />
of bans have in recent times been lifted and I think that<br />
exporters themselves have a responsibility to make sure that there </p>
<p>is reasonable discussion where there is a proper course to<br />
be undertaken but you can't have a situation in which exports<br />
are determined and governed by trade union movement.<br />
QUESTION: How would you stop it?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I think you will find that bans in relation<br />
to Indonesia have already been lifted and Chile, I think they have<br />
been lifted, and part of that I think is a result of the general<br />
attitude that we are taking to trade union affairs in terms of<br />
consultation and also in terms of having laws which are much<br />
more appropriately related to the needs of Australia in 1978<br />
than they were two or three years ago. The laws have been<br />
changed to give us more flexible opportunities. But at the<br />
same time I think and this might be one of the most important<br />
elements the Government has demonstrated that when it makes<br />
up its mind about a particular issue that it is in fact<br />
determined and is not going to allow the government of the<br />
country to be taken out of the Government's hands.<br />
