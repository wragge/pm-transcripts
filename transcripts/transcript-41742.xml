    <content><![CDATA[<p>I look forward to welcoming His Excellency Mr Andrzej Duda, President of the Republic of Poland, and his wife, Mrs Agata Kornhauser-Duda, to Australia from 17 to 21 August.</p>
<p>The visit comes at an important time in Poland’s history – with 2018 marking Poland’s 100th anniversary of regaining independence.</p>
<p>Australia strongly values its warm relationship with Poland as an important member state of the European Union that shares Australia’s commitment to international security and open trade.</p>
<p>President Duda’s visit will be an opportunity to discuss issues of mutual interest, including progress on a comprehensive and ambitious Australia-EU Free Trade Agreement and expanding bilateral trade links.</p>
<p>With more than 180,000 people in Australia with Polish ancestry, the visit will also allow us to celebrate the contribution of the Polish Australian community to Australia’s multicultural society.</p>
<p>President Duda and Mrs Kornhauser-Duda will travel to Melbourne, Canberra and Sydney during their visit.</p>
