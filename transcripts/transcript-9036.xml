PRIME MINISTER 179<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
APEC LEADERS MEETING SEATTLE<br />
At the invitation of President Clinton, I will be attending an informal meeting of<br />
leaders of the APEC economies in Seattle on 19-20 November.<br />
This historic meeting will otter an unprecedented opportunity for leaders to<br />
discuss In an informal setting their own national economic experiences, their<br />
vision for the region into the twenty-first century, and the ways in which APEC<br />
can help to maintain the economic momentum in the Asia-Pacific region, the<br />
fastest growing area of the world.<br />
I will also take the opportunity at the Seattle meeting to have bilateral<br />
meetings with a number of the leaders present, including President Ziang<br />
Zemnin of China, President Kim Young Sam of the Republic of Korea,<br />
Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai of Thailand and Prime Minister Hosokawa of<br />
Japan. The Seattle meeting will follow Immediately after the fifth APEC ministerial<br />
meeting at which the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Senator Evans, and the<br />
Minister for Trade, Senator Cook, will represent Australia.<br />
The ministerial meeting will discuss a trade and investment framework for<br />
APEC, and APEC's 1994 work program. It will also discuss the report of -the<br />
Eminent Persons' Group which was formed to look at the opportunities for<br />
trade in the region over the longer term, and on which Mr Neville Wran<br />
represented Australia. I expect that both the ministerial meeting and the<br />
leaders' meeting will want to look at ways in which APEC members can help<br />
bring about a satisfactory outcome to the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade<br />
negotiations. The APEC economies represent forty per cent of the world's population and<br />
are responsible for half its production. Three quarters of Australia's exports<br />
go to APEC members and around two-thirds of our imports are sourced from<br />
APEC. Canberra November 1993 </p>
