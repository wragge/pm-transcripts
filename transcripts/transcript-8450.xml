EMBARGOED AGAINST DELIVERY ( 1O. 3OAM, 11 MARCH 1992)<br />
ADDRESS BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING, MP<br />
LAUNCH OF " LET'S GO AUSTRALIA" LIFE BE IN IT CAMPAIGN<br />
MELBOURNE, 11 MARCH 1992<br />
Ladies and gentlemen,<br />
I'm more than pleased to have the opportunity to launch this<br />
Life Be In It Campaign, which has the entirely appropriate<br />
slogan " Let's Go, Australia!".<br />
It's appropriate not just because we need to get going, but<br />
because we can get going.<br />
The opportunities' are there for us to make sure that the<br />
great qualities of our society are preserved within a<br />
dynamic new Australia.<br />
We have natural advantages that most other countries can<br />
only dream of.<br />
Think of them: the ones that nature provides mineral<br />
resources, wilderness, space those things which are at a<br />
premium in virtually every other advanced country.<br />
And think of the ones that Australians made a robust<br />
democracy, freedoms unsurpassed in the world, highly<br />
developed social ' services, a tolerant multicultural society<br />
with, by any measure, one of the highest standards of living<br />
in the world.<br />
These things were made by Australians with bold ideas,<br />
courage and E-nergy.<br />
They didn't drop from the sky they were imagined, worked<br />
for, made to happen.<br />
Just as our resources have been developed and our land<br />
farmed by the enterprise of men and women, it is Australians<br />
who have made a good society. </p>
<p>And we can make a better one.<br />
I take the view that if we can achieve these things, we can<br />
achieve much more.<br />
If we can make one of the world's most free and democratic<br />
societies, we can make a more dynamic one.<br />
If we can make a society as fair and tolerant as this, we<br />
can go much further towards eliminating injustice and<br />
intolerance, and engaging more and more people in the life<br />
of the nation.<br />
If we can create one of the highest standards of living in<br />
the world, we can make it higher, and we can do the things<br />
which are necessary to guarantee the future.<br />
And if we are able to develop our resources, and farm our<br />
land as efficiently as we do then we are able, surely, to<br />
manufacture and grow new products and export them to the<br />
world. I have no doubt that we can do these things because I have<br />
seen so much. done in recent years.<br />
In 1992 we are much better at working together than we have<br />
ever been.<br />
We are much more competitive than we were a decade ago, by<br />
far.<br />
We are much more aware of the need to develop our strengths,<br />
to become a nation of entirely independent mind, to make our<br />
own destiny. I<br />
We know much more about the things that we have to do, and<br />
the figures show that we are much better at doing them.<br />
The fact is that the progress we have made can be the basis<br />
for recovery from this recession, and more than that for<br />
building a great Australian society in the nineties.<br />
To do it we need the whole-hearted effort of Australians.<br />
Our recovery and growth must come as our past achievements<br />
have come from the efforts of Australians, for the benefit<br />
of Australians.<br />
It must be a recovery in which all Australians share.<br />
As a government we want to open ways for Australians to play<br />
their part.<br />
Our plans are calculated to include them, and we want to<br />
develop new plans, new programs, new ways of calling on the<br />
energy, ambition and imagination of all Australians. </p>
<p>That is why I am so pleased to support Life Be In It this<br />
year's program called " Let's Go, Australia!", hits the mark<br />
perfectly. As I said, we have these great natural advantages, we have<br />
this fantastic country but the trouble with a country so<br />
well-endowed is that it tends to make us complacent.<br />
It has given us a tendency to cruise, and watch the world<br />
pass by.<br />
Now we know that we can't cruise that was the message of<br />
the eighties.<br />
The message of this decade is that we can look to the future<br />
with confidence: as we engage the gears of recovery we<br />
should remind ourselves that our great achievements did not<br />
fall to us by chance.<br />
We got this far by calling on the greatest of all our<br />
natural resources our people. Ourselves. Our ambitions,<br />
our abilities, our energy, our care, our faith in each<br />
other and in ourselves, our love for this country.<br />
That is what: we ' must call on now our whole-hearted belief<br />
in this enterprise of Australia.<br />
I congratulate everyone involved in this " Life Be In It"<br />
campaign. Your efforts are calculated to give inspiration, confidence<br />
and pride, at a time when Australia needs those things.<br />
On behalf of the government, I thank you.<br />
And thank you for having me here today.<br />
ENDS </p>
