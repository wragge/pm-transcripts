TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
INTERVIEW WITH KEN DICKEN AND SONIA FELDHOSS, RADIO<br />
16 MAY 1995<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF ONLY<br />
KD: I thought I recognised this face when he walked in. We have seen him<br />
a bit on television, haven't we?<br />
SF: He looks a little bit familiar, doesn't he?<br />
KD: Yes, Paul Keating.<br />
PM: Oh well I am clean shaven this morning, I look better in the early<br />
morning. SF: Actually, it was interesting that was one of the questions that came up<br />
from our Breakfast Show. Do you have to shave every morning?<br />
PM: Well, I think most people do. I certainly do.<br />
KD: You don't wear make-up? Not for radio anyway.<br />
PM: Not for radio, no. I mean I have got my radio face on.<br />
KD: Good stuff. We have got a couple of very amusing questions, of<br />
course, from listeners to the Breakfast program. One, of course, straight<br />
away was what was the line you used to chat up Annita on the plane?<br />
PM: Well I can't remember but it was a good one though. It worked.<br />
KD: Did somebody write it for you?<br />
PM: It certainly worked. It worked like a charm.<br />
SF: It wasn't one you used before obviously then?<br />
PM: I don't think so, no. It was spontaneous, it wasn't refined. </p>
<p>SF: Oh there you go.<br />
PM: It wasn't developed.<br />
KID: Was it love at first sight or the coffee was good?<br />
PM: Well it was the nearest thing to love at first sight I think.<br />
KID: On both sides?<br />
PM: Well it was a going concern from day one.<br />
KID: Of course, the good news is that work will start soon on the extension<br />
to Adelaide's Mt Barker road which is a horror strip. Have you been aware of<br />
this road Prime Minister?<br />
PM: I have and I think this is a big change. It's eight kilometres of road and<br />
we are putting a six lane tunnel through it. So it will be a very substantial<br />
change to the system, built under the Commonwealth's National Highway<br />
program. KID: And when will work start?<br />
PM: It will start within the year.<br />
KID: Can you give us anything closer than saying within a year?<br />
PM: I can't myself, but I could get you a start time, maybe have it after the<br />
program. SF: How long do you think this project is going to take, are you aware of<br />
that at this stage?<br />
PM: Well it is an estimated cost of $ 130 million, so a program like that you<br />
are probably talking about a couple of years, I would say.<br />
SF: Is this a program that you had a lot of lobbying from our Premier,<br />
Mr Brown?<br />
PM: No, no. We are building a highway from South Australia, back through<br />
New South Wales up to meet the New England Highway. Again, I did that in<br />
One Nation. In two weeks time I am launching the One Nation train, which<br />
will have the standard gauge railway from Melbourne to Adelaide for the first<br />
time in our history. You will be able to catch a train in Brisbane and go to<br />
Perth via Melbourne and Adelaide and that was in One Nation too. They<br />
were all done to get the economy started and, of course, it worked. The<br />
economy got cracking. You are now seeing these things come to fruition. </p>
<p>KID: That is encouraging from the point of view of rail travel. Whereas, say<br />
locally, so many tracks are being closed down.<br />
PM: Yes, and the other thing of course that I announced this morning is<br />
that we are going to start immediately to commission design work and do the<br />
environmental studies for the extension of Adelaide Airport. So if you look at<br />
the further integration of Adelaide into the nation, both by air and by rail and<br />
then just improve road access in the State, the Commonwealth is doing a lot<br />
for South Australia in these things and I think they will be important for the<br />
infrastructure of the State.<br />
KID: So you don't regard us as a backwater as some people would say?<br />
PM: Well the standard gauge idea was my own proposal in One Nation. It<br />
didn't come from the bureaucracy or the State Government, it came from me<br />
because I think we do need an efficient rail corridor if we are going to get<br />
commerce up and I think given the fact that South Australia, as the rest of<br />
Australia is now at the foot of the fastest growing markets in the world, it is<br />
important to get this airport up to full capacity to take laden 747s and be able<br />
to get the frequency up. I think that is important, so I have done these things.<br />
The other thing I did, I gave South Australia $ 640 Million off the State Bank<br />
debt, of course, in 1993 and that was the largest single commitment off the<br />
budget by the Commonwealth to any State in history.<br />
SF: You have announced this study into the runway, the Adelaide airport.<br />
When will we get a decision on that?<br />
PM: About building it. We are saying, we will build it.<br />
SF: Right.<br />
PM: What we are now doing is the engineering studies and the<br />
environmental studies. Now South Australia has offered us $ 20 million<br />
towards us, we will put that into it and we will refund the $ 20 million to South<br />
Australia when we sell it.<br />
SF: So it will be sold?<br />
PM: It will be sold. But what we are doing is building it ahead of the sale,<br />
rather than waiting to sell it and have some build it. We will build it now<br />
because we think the State needs it.<br />
KID: Obviously you have come under flak in this State because of the sales<br />
tax on motor vehicles. Mr Brown would have lobbied you fairly extensively on<br />
that, to the problems of increasing the sales tax?<br />
PM: I can't recall he mentioned that to me. But you remember this, in One<br />
Nation we took it down from 21 to 16 and try and kick-start the motor industry<br />
which, again, we did. Motor vehicles are now running, again, at a very high </p>
<p>level. So it was, what we call, a counter cyclical policy. When the motor<br />
industry was doing badly, we reduced the rate to get it cracking. Now it is<br />
cracking we have put it back to where it was. That is what has happened.<br />
KD: But it's not going to take it back, you don't think, into the doldrums?<br />
PM: No, no, I don't think so because there is so much more confidence<br />
around. We were out of the recession three years ago. The Treasury has<br />
said three more years of growth. So that is why we have done it. But I think<br />
the biggest influence on South Australia will be the pressure we took off<br />
interest rates. Last year we sold $ 21,000,000,000 worth of bonds and this<br />
year, as a result, of the Budget we sell $ 6,000,000,000. So there is a<br />
billion reduction and that is why interest rates have fallen on the long<br />
bonds by 1 per cent in the last week and why we are starting to see banks<br />
reduce the housing rates. That will give South Australia more impetus than<br />
anything else.<br />
SF: Just returning to the car sales tax. We have had interviews on this<br />
show and calls to this show saying that it is going to make a big difference in<br />
the industry. That it could mean the difference between some of these<br />
businesses surviving and going. That it could cost jobs.<br />
PM: No, I don't.<br />
SF: What you dismiss that?<br />
PM: By and large I do, yes. All industry spokesmen will give you the worst<br />
view in the world about it all. But have a look at it. When the Government<br />
picked up the car industry from John Howard and Malcolm Fraser it was dead<br />
on its feet. It had no future. It was high cost, low quality. Four weeks ago, I<br />
opened the new Toyota plant in Melbourne $ 400 million state of the art<br />
plant, which this year will sell $ 400 million worth of motor cars in the Toyota<br />
international network. I also worked with Mitsubishi here in South Australia to<br />
get the Magna wagon and the extra engine plant capacity. We are also<br />
looking at the Magna vehicle, the car. All this has come about because of<br />
reductions in tariffs and the general cost efficiencies of the Australian<br />
economy via wages, inflation and the exchange rate. So the car industry has<br />
never been stronger than it is at the moment. It has never been stronger as<br />
the quality, as the price and we are giving Australian consumers a better<br />
price. SF: But shouldn't we get a stronger foot-hold before we increase those<br />
taxes? PM: But we are not increasing in a sense, we are taking them back to<br />
where they were. It is this thing. If the Government gives a benefit to the<br />
industry, the argument they are putting is you can never return the benefit, in<br />
other words it has to stay a benefit forever. We gave them a benefit because<br />
they were in the doldrums in 1992-93. They have come out of the doldrums, </p>
<p>so now basically we have put the tax back to where it was. But it is only a<br />
percentage point change.<br />
SF: That is quite a lot though isn't it?<br />
PM: No, it is only going to have a marginal effect on car sales?<br />
KD: You said that you would hold an election when you believe the Labor<br />
Party could win. You don't believe you could win an election at the moment?<br />
PM: No, what I have said is I think that these elections are too hard to win<br />
to throw away a year or 18 months. You remember when John Hewson was<br />
running and saying we are going to have an early election, there is going to<br />
be an early election, and there wasn't. Then we had Alexander Downer<br />
saying there is going to be an early election and there wasn't. I have always<br />
taken the old fashioned view when the community elect a Government, they<br />
expect to get value from the Parliament and the Government can go on and:<br />
get its business done. Now we did this with the Budget last Tuesday, we did<br />
it with Working Nation last year, Creative Nation, the. big APEC change,<br />
Mabo. All these great changes have occurred in the last two years and that<br />
is because the Government has had its eyes focussed on the work and not<br />
on the polls and not on an election. Now, you know, this Parliament will run<br />
its full course, that is it will go into that cycle where it is competent for the<br />
House of Representatives and the Senate to go to an election together. This.<br />
idea, which was put around now for a year, that we were going to have anearly<br />
poll, I have never taken up and I have never intended to take up.<br />
SF: When will we have an election?<br />
PM: Well we'll have it at a point where the Government believes it is better<br />
for us to renew our mandate and-to. seek that. further authority from the<br />
community and it somewhere between now and next March.<br />
KD: Senator Alston, of course, has been making, some fairly seriousaccusations<br />
over the weekend regarding you and your dealings with-<br />
Conrad Black.<br />
PM: Look it is just a joke. You know what is happening; in-the Liberal. Part.<br />
at the moment? Connolly has put-orr-astink for being. dtmped-irrthe safest.<br />
Liberal seat. I mean he has been beaten by Brendan Nelsorn<br />
KD: A former Labor Partymember.<br />
PM: He was in the Labor Party for 17 years. I mean the Liberal Party is. somoribund<br />
these days, it is like a: club-: You. join at the-door You. tur up at the<br />
door and sign and tick it and you're aimember. Nelsorrtried-to: get-a seat<br />
here in South Australia. Cbuldn't-do-it,-in-Boothby. Therr he-moved-t.<br />
Bradfield. He has been backed by-Bruce Shepherd who-was-part-of the Jotr.-<br />
for Canberra push. Now you have-got-tor understand this; John Howardtisi<br />
i<br />
_ jr, CLr.<br />
r 4r<br />
~ S. u 1<br />
:~ s<br />
trmmm. ra~, a~ iw-~ ~ un~ R~ RWrunrrn </p>
<p>still hearing voices about Joh for Canberra and he knows about Shepherd's<br />
involvement, so he would regard this outcome in Bradfield, last weekend, with<br />
horror. Now Connolly said yesterday, went on television last evening,<br />
complaining about his dumping and saying that Senator Watson in Tasmania<br />
is now under threat by Robin Gray, who was also part of the Joh for Canberra<br />
push and the two superannuation spokespersons for the Liberal Party are<br />
now under threat. One has been defeated, one is under threat and this<br />
comes after Paul Filing and Rocher were defeated in Western Australia. So<br />
there is a big yike, a big stink, going on in the Liberal Party and their trick for<br />
the day is to invent something about what I have supposedly said to John<br />
Fairfax Sons about their ownership.<br />
SF: Did you make a threat?<br />
PM: No, no.<br />
KD: You didn't make any mention that you were doing a deal with<br />
Conrad Black?<br />
PM: It is just complete fiction this stuff. I mean the only people who have<br />
offered Conrad Black 50 per cent ownership was ' the Liberal Party. John<br />
Hewson told Conrad Black he could have 50 per cent of John Fairfax Sons.<br />
We have never said such a thing, never.<br />
KD: Just harking away. Are you dismissing Brendan Nelson as a bit of a<br />
joke because he is a very good public performer?<br />
PM: He is a complete opportunist. I mean he resigned from the Labor Party:<br />
because it. wasn't socialist enough and next thing.-he is. running. with a. right<br />
winger like-Shepherd for the Liberal Party's. safest seat and defeating their<br />
spokesman-on superannuation. Well, look at their front: bench; you. have-gptthe<br />
front benct-behind-John-Howard. is: Fscher, who. frankly carrtbarely string;<br />
a sentence together-whose_ incapacity is: such-that-he-can barely put hiss<br />
grammar together. Then you have-got Costello, who is: like a-crow on a fence<br />
picking, the eyes out of any good news, he. has got nothing positive to say.<br />
And you.. have: got Alexander Downer, who. is; a-professional failure as: thee<br />
foreign minister. Now you imagine-Alexander Downer; the Foreign Minister;,.<br />
and. Tim. Fscher; the; Deputy Piime; Minister, and: compare: themn tam<br />
Gareth Evans the-Foreigp Minister; and: Briarr Howe; OrCbostello. taoWillis:-I<br />
mean they have got virtually nobody, soathey are saying; look we are basicallyg<br />
bereft, e wewilltake, whoever comes:, along. They-say well'what about as<br />
Labor-Party, member of lT years?' Wouldc you.. have him?-Oh yes; we. will?<br />
have him; just bringhim in, give him our safest seat<br />
KD: Btt: Brendarr Nelson-did-say, hea was: very, disillusioned with-thee<br />
Labor Party. We: questioned him on this some months-ago. He: thought you.<br />
were losing-track.. 2<br />
S.<br />
SI<br />
c </p>
<p>PM: Well do we look like we are losing track? There is a Budget back into<br />
surplus. We have just introduced the biggest retirement incomes change and<br />
comprehensive savings plan in the nation's history with superannuation.<br />
With every person going to 15 per cent to give not only a very high standard<br />
of living in retirement, but a massive pool of national savings and that follows<br />
Working Nation where we have got the long term unemployed back to work.<br />
Where we have had 5 per cent growth for the year and 2 per cent inflation.<br />
Where we have had 650,000 job growth since the last election. Losing our<br />
way?: My goodness. You know, an old friend of mine said to me one day,<br />
never worry about the sky rockets of politics. At first a shower of sparks, but:<br />
a dead stick falls to earth. Now that will be Brendan Nelson, just as it was<br />
Bronwyn Bishop, just as it was John Hewson. See John Hewson left thefinancial<br />
markets in Bent Street Sydney and dashed in, he was going to show<br />
the rest of us in public life what it was all about. And where is he? He is<br />
back in Bent Street again.<br />
KD: You couldn't see the same happening with Carmen Lawrence?<br />
PM: Oh no, Carmen is a professional politician.<br />
SF: She is in a bit of trouble at the moment in the public opinion though,<br />
isn't she?<br />
PM: No, just because there is this stunt in Western Australia by a Western<br />
Australian Government, trying to inquire into the politics. I mean look at the<br />
Labor Party people, look at the solidity of the Cabinet.<br />
SF: A Royal Commission doesn't sound very solid though, having a Royal<br />
Commission into these affairs?<br />
PM: But I could have a Royal Commission into the Asia. Dairy scandal. irr<br />
the previous Govemment?-I: could say well let's hear from-Malcolm Fraserand:.<br />
Peter Nixon and: lan Sinclair and Doug; Anthony and what reallyhappened:<br />
in that Cabinet meeting, on that Thursday night. I; mean you<br />
understand that a Royal Commission is not the law, it is not the judiciary ass<br />
an extension of the Executive: It. is-a power to-extend: the arm of the<br />
Government. So you. have got-the Government of Western Australia seeking,.<br />
to, irr my view, improperly extend-: its-view into the: Cabinet of the-former<br />
Govemment. SF: So have you given her your full support?<br />
PM: Well, of course, I do.<br />
KD: But you gave Ros Kelly your full support too, initially.<br />
PM: No, but I gave. her my. full. support-initially and. finally. She. made the<br />
decision to-pull out, not me-and: could I just say, how would: peopleigo if I said<br />
well look, we'll go and spend $ 5 millibn and. we will have an-inquiry, a: judicial<br />
WrW~-fW'Vytw^^ </p>
<p>inquiry, into why and how lan McLachlan intercepted these legal papers in--<br />
the Hindmarsh Bridge affair. Did John Howard know about it and when?<br />
What did Howard say to McLachlan? And ask them, under privilege, why did<br />
they send the papers to the opposing solicitor, why did they send the papers<br />
to the newspapers and who authorised it? I mean we could have a judicial<br />
inquiry into that.<br />
SF: Are you confident she will come out looking clean?<br />
PM: And what would people say about that?<br />
KD: But it was her own Party that raised the issue.<br />
PM: Oh, that doesn't mean anything.<br />
SF: Why doesn't that mean anything?<br />
PM: Oh a former Minister said something in a corridor or something. That.<br />
doesn't mean to say that the finality should follow.<br />
SF: That almost seems more damning though, surely?<br />
PM: No, who cares. The general point is, the main point, look at the quality.<br />
of the Government. I mean, what was our principal commitment at the last-.<br />
election? It was to employment. The thing I said on election night is-we<br />
wouldn't leave the unemployed behind, we would put our arm out and pull'<br />
them up, we made a target of 500,000 jobs in 3 years. We have got tOr;<br />
650,000 in 21/ 4 years. That is the hardest possible thing to do in Australia isi<br />
produce employment. We have got to 650,000 jobs in 2.1/ 4 years way-;<br />
beyond our target of half a million.<br />
KD: But-Prime Minister these are not permanent jobs.<br />
PM: Oh yes they are.<br />
KD: But it can be an hour here or an hour there, can't it?<br />
PM: No, no:. The bulk of that has&amp; been infull time employment. The. bulk<br />
those 90,000: jobs last month were irr full time. employment; We-have<br />
4-per cent-employment growth since-the election. Now look at John HowarEdÃ±<br />
he is running; around talking, about my credibility. I ' mean to be-crediblepy, l<br />
have been in-office for 12-years. I have-been-one of the. few people involvedi.<br />
in-the-Cabinet in-internationalising the-Atstraliarr economy, removing.<br />
exchange controls, floating the exchange. rate; opening up-the financia,.<br />
markets, taking, the tariff wall down; lifting; the participation and educatiorr:<br />
You. know, looking at-issues such as-our identity. Our relationship with-ouWr<br />
indigenies: Gtting the growth back into the-economy with low inflationrr.<br />
What has-Howard: ever done?' I mean he-isa professional failure, HowacdÃ±.<br />
He-was-: afailure as Treasurer He-left us. with double digit inflation, doubles: </p>
<p>digit unemployment and a massive structural weakness in the economy and<br />
as Opposition Leader he came to nought.<br />
SF: But we still have 8 per cent unemployment.<br />
PM: But going down rapidly.<br />
SF: Yes, but what do you think we will get down to? What do you consider<br />
an acceptable rate of unemployment?<br />
PM: Well the Government's target is 5 per cent by the year 2000 and we<br />
are well on the way to doing that. You see, even in the 1980s when we had<br />
absolutely phenomenal employment growth, we couldn't get below 6 1/ 2 and<br />
the reason is we couldn't get to the long term unemployed. We couldn't get<br />
them into the labour market because they were untrained and they weren't<br />
job ready. With Working Nation, we are now case managing the whole of<br />
that group of people, about 260,000. In fact, we are case managing 500,000<br />
people, but 260,000 are unemployed over 12 months or more, 18 months, in<br />
that area. So that means that we have one person that talks to an individual,<br />
one person case manages about 30 people. They get to know their<br />
educational attainment, their skills, their work background, their personality<br />
and then we give them a job subsidy and then they have to take the job. In<br />
that was, as a consequence of that, we have had this year 100,000, of the<br />
650,000 jobs I mentioned to you, have come from the long term unemployed<br />
and that means that in this recovery, where before we couldn't get beyond<br />
6 1/ 2 per cent, we will actually have a capacity to get down to 5 per cent<br />
unemployment because of that Working Nation program getting the long<br />
term unemployed back into work.<br />
SF: Mr Keating you have been quoted as saying Kerry Packer is a<br />
professional bully and you seem to be trying to get out of it. Are you sorry<br />
you said that comment?<br />
PM: No, if you see The Australian today. Have you got The Australian<br />
today? SF: Yes.<br />
PM: The header there says " PM tries to heal rift with Packer'. ' The Prime<br />
Minister, Mr Keating, tried yesterday to end his public feud", it goes on, " by<br />
declaring he bore no ill feeling towards" him. Well I don't. I mean he has got<br />
his interests and I have got mine.<br />
KID: Is he a bully?<br />
PM: Oh Kerry tries to get his way, but all media proprietors are like that. It<br />
is almost an occupational hazard.<br />
SF: You are not sorry you said that comment though? </p>
<p>PM: Oh, of course I am not sorry I say things. I am not sorry when I say<br />
things. What I said was, I said that, and I also said to him that he has, where<br />
is it now? I said words to the effect look, Kerry is a fellow that has a lot of<br />
good qualities, I mean I have known him for a long time. I counted myself as<br />
a friend of Kerry's not a close friend, or one I see regularly or anything like<br />
that but someone who I have liked over the years. I have been<br />
disappointed by his attitude and that is what I have said.<br />
SF: Do friendships affect your decisions regarding cross media ownership<br />
rules? PM: Oh you don't have friendships in public life. You have acquaintances.<br />
KO: But Mr Keating, what about when people, say, like Kerry Packer, very<br />
wealthy, Sir Peter Abeles. What power do they have over Governments?<br />
What power do they have over policies?<br />
PM: They have interests and Governments have got to be alert to their<br />
interests and make decisions in the public interest and I have always tried to<br />
do that. But, again, you wouldn't want to be a shrinking violet, they would<br />
absolutely walk over the top of you.<br />
SF: So has there been any lobbying on this Fairfax deal? Was their a deal<br />
struck? PM: No, well I answered that earlier. The Liberal Party are without people<br />
and without policies. I mean John Howard stood up the other night in the<br />
Budget reply. He had every opportunity to lay down some policies. He is a<br />
complete policy free zone and their personnel are dropping out of the Party at<br />
a rate of knots so they're embarrassed, they are on the back foot, so their<br />
story for the day is some cooked up story about Fairfax. The only people who<br />
have ever offered Conrad Black 50 per cent of John Fairfax Sons is the<br />
Liberal Party.<br />
KD: Although the polls would suggest that Mr Howard is not doing too bad<br />
a job.<br />
PM: Look there is no way the Australian people are going to go back to<br />
somebody who has 1950s values, who has 1970s policies, who doesn't<br />
understand the place where Australia is in Asia, doesn't understand the<br />
importance of an inclusive society, hasn't made the commitment to equity and<br />
fairness that need to keep this country together, has never made, ever, any<br />
big public policy changes. Had all the opportunities in the 70s and 80s to<br />
float the dollar, to open up the financial markets, pull tariffs down. He kept<br />
them all regulated. He had tariffs rising. They are not going to go back and<br />
say let's go back to the future, let's go back to somebody who is basically<br />
from another epoch. They are not going to do that. They will go for the<br />
Government that is the author of the policies of change. Look at him at the </p>
<p>moment. He is saying I agree with the Government on tariffs now. I agree<br />
with their policies on Asia. Well if he agrees with them, just step out of the<br />
road and let the authors of the policies keep going.<br />
KID: Mr Keating with the sale of the Commonwealth Bank, somebody<br />
correctly pointed out it was guaranteed by the Government, the people's<br />
savings, their investments. That will go by the by obviously.<br />
PM: No. Years ago the Commonwealth Bank was Australia's Reserve<br />
Bank. Until the Reserve Bank Act of 1959 it was a Reserve Bank and that is<br />
why there is a lot of mythology around about it being the people's bank. After<br />
the Reserve Bank Act was implemented and we established a Reserve Bank,<br />
it became just another savings and trading bank and there is no more reason<br />
for the Commonwealth to own the Commonwealth Bank than there is for the<br />
State of South Australia to own the State Bank of South Australia no more<br />
reason. And that is why we will do very well putting it on the market and we<br />
will end up not do well, do exceptionally well as a country, with another<br />
great private institution. I mean the Commonwealth Bank, which has now<br />
picked up the State Bank of Victoria as well, is going to be for the first time<br />
ever a really powerful and great institution.<br />
KID: With all this money going into superannuation does that worry you?<br />
Superannuation doesn't have an untarnished record?<br />
PM: I am trying to do it.<br />
KID: No, but there must be some reservations surely. I mean there have<br />
been problems with superannuation over the years.<br />
PM: But if you didn't have a Government doing these things, where would<br />
we be? When my generation, our generation, reach age 65, there will be half<br />
as many again retired age people as now. And when our children reach age<br />
there will be twice as many retired age people as now. Can you imagine<br />
what pressure that will put on the working people then at the time to sustain<br />
this massive retired age population and the pressure it will put to reduce the<br />
pension. So what we have done, ten years ago in 1985-86 under the Accord<br />
and now on Tuesday night adding to it, is to provide for the first time ever a<br />
comprehensive savings and retirement plan so when we reach those<br />
numbers people will basically have a retirement income about the same as<br />
their working income. So if you take someone on $ 33,000, which is average<br />
weekly earnings today, in today's dollars that person would have a lump sum<br />
on just on 1/ 2 a million and an ongoing income stream of about $ 30,000 a<br />
year. Could you imagine the Liberals putting together a policy where a<br />
person on average weekly earnings, on $ 33,000, ends up with a 1/ 2 a million<br />
lump sum and $ 30,000 a year.<br />
KID: I understand that, but people have lost money on superannuation over<br />
the years. How can you be sure you will not be losing money? </p>

PM: No. They go up and down. In one half year they will do well, another<br />
half year they will do less well. In the last year, they had losses because the<br />
international bond market and a lot of these superannuation assets are held<br />
in what is called Government gilts, that is Government securities, the long<br />
term bond rates went up, therefore the value of the paper went down and<br />
holders of Government paper in the United States, in Japan, in Germany and<br />
in Australia had substantial losses. This happened to the super funds who<br />
were holding that paper. Then look at the stock market, the All Ordinaries<br />
has gone from 1500 to 2000 which is again on the other side of the ledger<br />
because of that huge bonus in there. In the long run, superannuation will<br />
give the country the earnings it needs to give ordinary Australians a good<br />
standard of living in retirement. You see with John Howard, the only thing he<br />
said in that hopeless reply to the Budget last Thursday, is that he would put a<br />
lid on superannuation. You see, there is no way he is going to give a break<br />
to ordinary working people. What a sensible person would say and you<br />
notice Mr Connolly has been supporting the Government's policies about the<br />
maintenance of the Superannuation Guarantee Charge supporting the<br />
Government's policy. Here is Howard saying, look I wouldn't have had the wit<br />
or the courage, or the imagination to do this. I didn't when I was Treasurer, I<br />
didn't support it when I was Opposition Leader, at least a Labor Government<br />
has given the country a decent savings plan. I will' just shut up about it and<br />
let this one go to the keeper. What does he say? Oh no, I will put a lid on it.<br />
I will put tax concessions in there so that the wealthy can get the benefits, but<br />
not the ordinary working person. I mean this guy never ever learns. He<br />
never ever takes a trick.<br />
KID: Good to talk with you Mr Keating. Finally, have you been around to<br />
Bob and Blanche's for a BBQ?<br />
PM: No, I haven't had an invitation at this point.<br />
KID: Are you expecting one?<br />
PM: No, no, I am not.<br />
SF: Thanks for coming in anyway.<br />
PM: Okay, Sonia, thanks and good to see you.<br />
