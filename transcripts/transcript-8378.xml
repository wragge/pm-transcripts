PRIME MINISTER] 4/ 92<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON. P. J. KEATING, MP<br />
SMALL BUSINESS COALITION<br />
I have today asked the Minister for Small Business,<br />
Construction and Customs, Mr Beddall, to convene a meeting<br />
with the Small Business Coalition at the earliest<br />
opportunity. I will attend the meeting which will follow talks with small<br />
and large business and unions already arranged for Sydney<br />
and Melbourne over the next two weeks.<br />
The Small Business Coalition, which represents more than<br />
organisationts, traditionally meets the Minister for Small<br />
Business and other Ministers twice a year at a Small<br />
Business Forum to put an agreed position to the Government<br />
on small business issues. I last met the Coalition as<br />
Treasurer in, April last year.<br />
As the largest employer of the Australian workforce it is<br />
important the Government seeks the views of small business<br />
in the lead-up to the Economic Statement.<br />
Although business people from all States will be involved in<br />
the meetings in Sydney and Melbourne the Small Business<br />
Coalition has a much broader representative base in the<br />
small business sector.<br />
It includes small business organisations such as COSBOA<br />
( Council of Small Business Associations of Australia) and<br />
ASBA ( Australian Small Business Association). Other members<br />
include the Australian Federation of Business and<br />
Professional Women, the Motor Trades Association, the<br />
Australian Tourism Industry Association, the Retail Traders<br />
Association and the Master Builders Construction and Housing<br />
Association. Larger business organisations such as the Confederation of<br />
Australian Industry, the Australian Chamber of Manufactures,<br />
the Metal Trades Industry Association and the National<br />
Farmers Federation, which have large numbers of small<br />
business members, are also represented.<br />
