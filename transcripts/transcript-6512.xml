Mr J. Thomson<br />
Editor The Border Morning Mail Pty Ltd<br />
PO Box 346<br />
ALBURY NSW 2640<br />
Dear Mr Thomson<br />
Thank you for your letter of 18 September 1984<br />
requesting an article from the Prime Minister for<br />
inclusion in The Border Morning Mail's series of<br />
articles for Newspaper Week.<br />
I am pleased to enclose the text of an article from the<br />
Prime Minister which I hope your readers will find of<br />
interest.<br />
Yours sincerely<br />
J. V. Townsend<br />
Senior Private Secretary </p>
<p>I am very pleased to have the opportunity to participate in<br />
The Border Morning Mail's promotion of Newspaper Week. I<br />
fully endorse the aim of Newspaper Week to increase<br />
awareness of the local newspaper and its role in the<br />
community. Australia is very fortunate to be ' one of the few countries<br />
in the world which enjoys a truly free! press. Many of us<br />
however do not appreciate the value of a free press having<br />
always taken it for granted. Efforts such as Newspaper<br />
Week perform a valuable function in raising the public'ss<br />
awareness of the nature of the press and its importance to<br />
our society. The local newspaper has always been an<br />
important part of the free press in Australia.<br />
Freedom of the press and the health of' a democracy are<br />
intimately connected each reflecting t~ he wellbeing of the<br />
other. Being part of a democratic society carries with it:<br />
responsibilities as well rights, and the same is true of<br />
freedom of the press. . The right of the press to report<br />
events and comment on them as it sees fit is matched by the<br />
responsibility to be fair and objective in its reporting.<br />
I do not believe that a commitment to a free press implies<br />
that either Government or media should be hesitant about<br />
criticism when it is justified. An open society such as<br />
ours is enriched by a healthy interaction between the<br />
Government, the community and the media.<br />
The press must serve the community from which it draws its<br />
livelihood and is therefore responsible not only for<br />
accurate, up-to-date coverage of events but also for<br />
intelligent and constructive comment on matters of relevance<br />
and importance to that community. One aspect of this, and<br />
a particularly important one from my point of view as Prime<br />
minister, is the reporting of Government actio * ns and<br />
initiatives, and the reactions and attitudes of the<br />
community to them.<br />
The Government relies on the media to communicate with the<br />
Australian community. Newspapers, and particularly local<br />
newspapers, play a vital role in reducing the sense of<br />
distance between Government and the community that can<br />
exist at times.<br />
The regional daily newspapers, such as the Border Morning<br />
Mail, have achieved a quite remarkable penetration of the<br />
communities that they serve, and this is invaluable to any<br />
group trying to communicate effectively with those<br />
communities. The quality of the service provided by thle<br />
regional dailies is clearly shown by their very strong<br />
performance over the last ten years. This has been<br />
achieved despite the challenges being faced from new<br />
technology and the competition from television and radio<br />
news and current affairs programmes.<br />
/ 2 </p>
<p>2<br />
That newspapers have continued to increase their sales<br />
indicates clearly that people want more than just the facts<br />
in their news coverage, they want constructive and critical<br />
analysis which will heighten their understanding of current<br />
events on the local, national and international scenes.<br />
Newspapers provide, and are expected to provide, more than<br />
just the news. They also entertain with feature articles<br />
and amusing stories, and they inform with public<br />
announcements and advertisements.<br />
Newspapers have demonstrated that they will not only survive<br />
technological change but will continue to prosper by<br />
providing the sort of service that only a newspaper can<br />
provide. I wish all those connected with Newspaper Week<br />
well for the future and commend it's aims to all<br />
Australians. </p>
