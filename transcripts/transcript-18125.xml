The Prime Minister, Julia Gillard, today announced new funding which will help more than 3,400 students build vocational skills and employment opportunities throughout the Pacific.</p>
<p>Australia will provide $152 million over four years from the aid program to continue to support the Australia Pacific Technical College.</p>
<p>Ms Gillard said this latest funding will help thousands of students graduate from the college between 2011 and 2015 and will focus on streamlining administration to ensure better value for money.</p>
<p>She said that ensuring that Pacific nations are prosperous, successful and stable is in Australia's national interest and this training will help these small nations with their development.</p>
<p>The program helps transform people's lives through international standard technical training, leading to further training opportunities and access to better jobs.</p>
<p>Since the APTC program began in June 2007 more than 3,000 people from Pacific Island countries have graduated from the college with qualifications that are recognised internationally.</p>
<p>The qualifications give graduates the chance to put their new skills into practice anywhere in the world, and especially in the region, which improves trade opportunities and people-to-people links across the Pacific.</p>
<p>College campuses have been established in Papua New Guinea, Fiji, Samoa and Vanuatu. A Scholarship Fund has also been set up for disadvantaged students including those from remote areas and countries without a campus. </p>
<p>Australian-standard training is delivered in eight industry sectors including the automotive, manufacturing, engineering, construction, health, tourism, hospitality and community services.</p>
<p>Ms Gillard also announced Australia would provide $2.7 million to support research on technical and vocational education and training costs and financing across the Pacific.  This research will be used to inform national and donor-decision making on education and training for the region.  </p>
