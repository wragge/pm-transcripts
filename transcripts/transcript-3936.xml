J! AUS October 1975<br />
OPENING OF BELLORANA LODGE, BELLINGEN<br />
The Prime Minister Mr Whitlam said today that he was<br />
determined to press on with the ordinary business of government,<br />
despite the current constitutional crisis. Mr Whitlam-was speaking<br />
in Coffs Harbour at the beginning of an official visit to<br />
Coffs Harbour and Bellingen.<br />
Mr Whitlam said his visit to Bellingento open Bellorana<br />
had been a firm engagement since July when it had first been<br />
mentioned to him. He said that the degree of community involvement<br />
in the planning and building of Bellorana was an example<br />
of the kind of co-operation between the Australian Government and<br />
voluntary organisations which characterised the Australian<br />
Government's approach to social needs. Mr Whitlam has already<br />
opened old persons' homes and hostels in other New South Wales<br />
country areas this year including Ozanam Villa Hostel at Lismore<br />
and Blakeney Lodge at Tumut. These have been made possible<br />
through the Australian Government's decision to increase the<br />
former $ 2 to $ 1 subsidy for such establishments to $ 4 for every<br />
$ 1. Mr Whitlam said he was looking forward to the Civic Welcome<br />
at Bellingen and his visit later in the day to the Coffs Harbour<br />
Council Chambers. He said he valued the sense of partnership<br />
which had grown up between local government and the Australian<br />
Labor Government. Last year the Australian Government had made<br />
direct grants to local government bodies for the first time. This<br />
year Bellingen Shire Council had received $ 100,000,<br />
comqp red with $ 77,000 last year, an increase of 29.9% while<br />
Coffs Harbour had received $ 188,000 this year, compared with<br />
$ 138,000 last year, an increase of 36.2%.<br />
Mr Whitlam said that the Australian Government was<br />
determined to use its powers to increase equality of services and<br />
opportunity between regions. Last week the full High Court had<br />
ruled in favour of the Australian Government providing direct<br />
grants to the Australian Assistance Plan. This power had been<br />
challenged by the Victorian and New South Wales Governments.<br />
Had the State Governments' challenge been successful, it could<br />
have endangered federal grants for old peoples homes and hostels,<br />
such as " Bellorana" at Bellingen, as well as such services as<br />
meals on wheels, isolated childrens allowances and many other<br />
social welfare services. ( A list of Australian Government<br />
expenditure in Bellingen and Coffs Harbour is attached. This<br />
list includes some programs which could have been affected by<br />
the High Court challenge.). </p>
