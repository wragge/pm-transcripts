13 November 1996 TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
THE HON. JOHN HOWARD MP<br />
MIDDAY SHOW CHANNEL NINE<br />
E O E<br />
KENNERLEY: Welcome to Midday and congratulations. We haven't seen you for nine months.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
No, and thanks for having me and congratulations to you. The show has been a sensation this<br />
year and I think your personality and presentation is largely responsible.<br />
KENNERLEY: Gee, we'll get rid of all of those dreadful questions then! You've got me right in now.<br />
PRIME MINISTER;<br />
It's true. It's been a great success and congratulations to you and your team, Geoff and all the<br />
others.<br />
KENNERLEY: Thank you very much, Yes, Geoffrey is over there and what a great part.<br />
HARVEY:<br />
How are you?, 15: 21 Pg: 1<br />
if!.. </p>
<p>Fax from PRIMIE MINISTER:<br />
I'm very well.<br />
HARVEY:<br />
Good to see you, a handsome man.<br />
PIME MI1NISTER:<br />
Good to see you.<br />
HARVEY: Everybody else is greasy so why shouldn't I?<br />
KENNERLEY:<br />
Well, nine months being the Prime Minister of Australia. How powerfuil is that feeling of<br />
being Prime Minister?<br />
PRIME AMISTER:<br />
It's sort of awe inspiring Father than powerfu~ l. I said on the night of the election that the<br />
greatest emotion I felt was humility and the opportunity after all of those years in politics to<br />
actually be at the pinnacle and do a few very positive and good things for the whole country.<br />
Sometimes you think you're very powerful, other times you feel absolutely impotent because<br />
even though you want to try and change something there are forces that are marshalled against<br />
you but it's intensely rewarding in a personal sense and the best part of it is actually going and<br />
talking to people. I had a wonderfuil<br />
experience on Sunday. I went down to Benalla in Victoria to unveil the Weary Dunlop<br />
Memorial and there mnust, have been eight or ten thousand people at that gathering. They were<br />
all ages and anybody who thinks that there is no identifiable Australian spirit hasn't been to a<br />
gathering like that. I mean, it was just fantastic. The open warmth and basic decency of<br />
people, I'm not suggesting for a moment they all agree with my politics. It would be amazing<br />
if they did. That's not really the issue but the opportunity to relate to people in that kind of<br />
situation is maivellous.<br />
KENNERLEY; Let's look at what you've achieved in the last nine months. Looking at the economic<br />
recovely, I have heard the comment recently that it's been about as slow as molasses. How<br />
do you react to that?<br />
PRIME MINISTER.,<br />
I think the economy is mixed. The growth figures are good, the inflation is low, interest rates<br />
are coming down all of those things are good. Fa oM13/ 11/ 96 15: 21 Pg: 2 </p>
<p>Fax from KFNNERLFY: But I talk to small business people and they just say, if you're talking to John Howard, say<br />
when is it going to happen?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I think a lot of things that we've done will make it happen next year. We are finally going to<br />
get the unfair dismissal -removal through the Senate which will help small business a lot.<br />
We've cut the capital gains tax liability, their provisional tax liability, their interest rates are<br />
coming down, although I would like the major banks to bring the small business interest rates<br />
down further.<br />
KENNERLEY: Will they? Can you make them do it?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well if we had more competition, Competitive pressure has driven home loan rates down.<br />
They've fallen by $ 145 a month, $ 145 a month over the last eight or nine months for a person<br />
on an average loan. So I think a lot of things that are needed for small business activity are<br />
there. I know the economy is mixed. Some areas are strong, others not so strong. Mining<br />
and services are very strong, manufacturing not so strong, retailing I am hoping will have a<br />
bumper Christmas.<br />
KENNERLEY: A lot of people had expectations of action and movement and feel disappointed. Do you think<br />
they are entitled to be?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
No because we always had a problem with the Senate.<br />
KENNERLEY: Yes but you said yourself you feel as if these forces are marshalled against you. Are you<br />
winning or losing?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
We're doing very well, for example, with workplace relations. We've finally got the<br />
agreement of the Democrats to get that through and if I can get the sale of one third of Teistra<br />
through this year we can start spending a lot of money out of the proceeds of that on<br />
improving Australia's environment. Faxro~ i13/ 11/ 96 15: 21 Pg: 3 </p>
<p>Fax from KENNEIILEY: How confident are you of getting that through?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I'm working on it. I'm not guaranteed it because I don't control the Senate. I may have a<br />
seat majority in the House of Representatives but I don't control the Senate.<br />
KENNERLEY: What happens if you don't get it?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well I think the environment will be the loser and I think the Australian community will be<br />
disappointed. If we don't get it we wvill put it up again and if we don't get it then, well, we'll<br />
consider our options. But I hope that won't be necessary to go further than that.<br />
KENNERLEV: Headlines overseas have been raging Australia's racism, Just last week CNN News have been<br />
pumping around the world television reports about Australia's racism. Even the Chinese<br />
Ambassador has officially expressed concern about tourist in Australia and our racist attitudes.<br />
What about those views of overseas to Australia and our racism?<br />
PRIME MINSTER:<br />
Well, if people think we are a racist country they're wrong. I mean, the strongest feelings I<br />
have about this whole debate is I'm not going to cop the claim that Australia is a racist,<br />
bigoted country it's not. It's one of the most tolerant, open societies in the world and I<br />
don't think people do this country any good by feeding a false view about the character of the<br />
Australian people. We took more Inido-Chinese refugees per capita than any nation in the<br />
world in the late 1970s. We have people from all around the world, we have our own special,<br />
unique identity. We are, by any measure, a very tolerant and open society. And the other<br />
thing I'd say, Kern-Anne, is that only this morning I saw a cable from our Embassy in Tokyo<br />
and the Office of the Australian Tourist Commission in Tokyo reported that there has been no<br />
decline at all in the rate of visa applications by Japanese to come to this country as tourists.<br />
When you bear in mind that Japan is our best source of touri sts...<br />
KENNERLEY: But these headlines are raging. CNN is talking about Australia being racist.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
People don't always react to headlines you know. Faoxm 13/ 11/ 96 15: 21 Pg: 4 </p>
<p>Fax fram KENNERLEY: Pauline Hanson started this debate and it all comes from Pauline Hanson. What do you say to<br />
people about that?<br />
PRIE MINISTER:<br />
Well what I say is that one speech by a backbencher does not represent the view of a nation.<br />
KENNERLEY:<br />
But how come, then, she got so much overwhelming support?<br />
PRIME MINISTER;<br />
Well I think people reacted, many of them, very foolishly. I mean, my reaction was one of not<br />
overreacting to the speech of an individual and every week that has gone by has confirmed my<br />
view that that was the right reaction and I think those people who chased it were wrong and I<br />
don't think they did Australia a great service.<br />
KENNERLEY: Well tell me what we should do Pauline Hanson was on the programme. We asked Australia<br />
what they thought of Pauline Hanson we had an overwhelming, not a small response, an<br />
overwhelming response of support for her 94 per cent. Now whether the specifics of her<br />
speech they were reacting to or what translating. What do you say to those Australians who<br />
support her?<br />
PRIME NMISTER:<br />
Well what I say to the whole community is that I can understand why, after we've had so<br />
much change...<br />
ENNERLEY:<br />
But what is the why, what do you understand why about?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I understand why a lot of people feel that their way of life has changed significantly. I<br />
understand why in a time of still high unemployment a lot of people feel unsettled. What I say<br />
is that we must retain our tolerant credentials, we must retain our reputation for being a very<br />
free and open society. But as the new Prime Minister of Australia I want to involve the<br />
Australian people in debate about these issues. I do not take the attitude that things like the<br />
level of immigration are too hot a subject for the Australian people to handle. I think one of<br />
the faults of the former government was it took an elitist view of these issues and said, look,'<br />
you out there are too uninformed to debate such issues, leave it to the political elite in<br />
Canberra surrounded by some people who appoint themselves as the journalistic elite, we'll<br />
work the decision out and weTl tell you what the decision is'. Now I think a lot of the<br />
Farxom 13/ 11/ 96 15: 21 Pg: </p>
<p>Fax from reaction you're talking about is a reaction against that rather than an intolerant, bigoted<br />
reaction.<br />
KENNERLEY: So that's your translation of what Pauline Hanson's overwhelming support was?<br />
PRIE MINISTER;<br />
Well I'm sceptical about remarks like overwhelming support.<br />
KENNERLEY: I only go from what we did on the programme.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I do understand that and it depends very much how you view what was said in that speech. I<br />
think that Australians are tolerant, not all of them, there are bigots in the Australian<br />
community but compared with other nations we have an incredible record of decency and<br />
tolerance, We have black spots our treatment of the Aborigines was appalling. But the<br />
balance sheet of Australian history is a very good one,<br />
KENNERLEY: Why didn't you just, sont of, have a chat in the corridors of Canberra and just say Ms Hanson,<br />
you know, can't you just back off a little this is unhealthy for us?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Oh look I know enough about human nature to know that...<br />
KNNNERLEY:<br />
Have you spoken to her or seen her?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
We exchange courtesies...<br />
KENNERLEY:-Courtesies does it Stop at that?<br />
PRIME MINISTER;<br />
Well thus far, yes. She is an Independent Member of Parliament, I know human nature well<br />
enough to know that if you, the more attention you pay to people in a situation like that the<br />
more likely it is that you'll get fuirther speeches. I mean, some of the people who have been<br />
Farxft 13/ 11/ 96 15: 21 PS: 6 </p>
<p>Fax from the loudest in criticism of me, if they had followed my example, some of those headlines<br />
wouldn't have appeared overseas. They've done the damage rather than me.<br />
KENNERLEV: But as a politician, professional politician, are you sure that you have connected with what the<br />
real electorate was feeling and translating their feelings about what Pauline Hanson said.<br />
PRIME MJNJSTER:<br />
I think I have actually, I do. I think I understand what, I understand the explanation for the<br />
surface support and I use that word surface deliberately...<br />
KENNERLEY: Just give me two examples, two examples, of what you think translated and you evaluated as a<br />
politicians. Just two things that the electorate is feeling that John Howard has recognised.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well I think people feel they're being shut out of debate on these issues. 1 think in the past<br />
whenever anyb~ ody sai d anything about immigration they had the feeling that the Government<br />
slapped them down and said ' that's too nasty for you to talk about, you're not mature enough<br />
to discuss those things'. Now Australians resent that. They resent being condescended to.<br />
The role of a Prime Minister is to both listen and to lead. You don't tell people all the time<br />
what they ought to believe. Sometimes you go out in front and you say ' you follow me<br />
because this is the right thing to do'. On other occasions you listen to what people are saying,<br />
you try and interpret the real meaning, not the surface explanation and I think when you do<br />
that in relation to this issues I think in six months time people will look back and say ' what<br />
was that all about?' And I do think people feet that under this Government you can talk a bit<br />
more about some of these things. But I want it done in a tolerant fashion, I mean, we have<br />
many... KENNERLEY: But many people just think you've ignored it.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
No I haven't ignored it, I understand it. I. think I understand it better than many of my critics<br />
and I think I'm serving the interests of Australia far better than many of my critics who are<br />
angry with me because I haven't done what they have told me to do.<br />
KENNERLEY: Mlr Howard would you mind staying with us for another few moments. Fa om13/ 11/ 96 15: 21 Pg: 7 </p>
<p>Fax from PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Delighted, ( ad break)<br />
KENNERLEY(;<br />
Welcome back to Midday. My special guest on Midday is Prime Minister-, John Howard. Mr<br />
Howard, on a personal note your wife, Janette, ivent through major surgery recently.<br />
Personally, how does John Howard, the husband, deal with something as dramatic, medically<br />
dramatic, as that?<br />
] PRIME MINISTER.<br />
Well no diffierently than anybody else. I mean, the world stopped for a few days and I'm very<br />
grateflul that she had a good surgeon and she's making a good recovery. She still gets pretty<br />
tired if she does too much, but I am immensely gratefuil for the surgeon and the tremendous<br />
staff at the King George V Hospital. I mean, it's a great hospital and I'm very, very grateful<br />
for the quality of the care that she received, I really am.<br />
KENNERLEY: Must be particularly difficult in anybody's profession, but let alone running a country and<br />
trying to deal with somnething as traumatic as that?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Yes, but I mean, we're all the same. I mean, we're no diffierent in a situation like that. It<br />
doesn't matter what you're doing if something like that occurs you just forget everything else<br />
for a while and I did. We're very grateflul that things are looking very positive and I can only<br />
feel very deeply for people who arc in different situations, But we're all humnan and, I guess,<br />
and my position is no different. I mean, everybody has responsibilities and everybody has<br />
loved ones and when something like that comes along it's often been said that illness is a<br />
leveller, illness doesn't discriminate, and of course neither it should.<br />
KENNERLEY:<br />
Does it change your attitude to life?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I don't know that it changed it but it really does drive home the supreme importance of family<br />
relationships anid the relationships you have with people you love are far more important than<br />
anything else in the world.<br />
KENNERLEY: On to other matters of protocol almost. You were invited to attend a dinner at the Victor<br />
Chang institute where the Princess of Wales then accepted an invitation. The headlines raged<br />
" John Howard shuns Diana PM shuns Diana". Why did you renege on the invitation?<br />
Faxom 13/ 11/ 96 15: 21 PS: 8 </p>
<p>Fax from PRIME NMSTER:<br />
Well, at the time I was invited, I didn't know Diana had been invited and I just took the view<br />
that it wasn't appropriate for the Prime Minister of this country and her to be sort of be<br />
present at the occasion. I'm sorry in a sense that I couldn't be there because I have an<br />
enormous respect for Victor Chang and for the people organising but..<br />
KENNERLEY: Why wouldn't it be appropriate for you to be at the same dinner because it is a fuandraiser, it is<br />
a charity. They ended up raising a million dollars. Why wouldn't it be appropriate for you to<br />
be there?<br />
] PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, it is just a judgmnent I took about the office, not the person. I mean, the office of Prime<br />
Minister of Australia. I think it was the right decision. I have no personal view either way, it<br />
wasn't done out of deference to anybody. It was just a view I took about the, I guess the<br />
protocol or the dignity of the office of Prime Minister as distinct from John Howard...<br />
KENNERLEY:<br />
Because you weren't number one on the billing?<br />
PRIM MINISTER:<br />
Well, it's just a question of the appropriateness of the office,<br />
KCENNERLEY.: Politics and image go hand in hand and I think that's where you are going; the image of Prime<br />
Minister might have been diminished because she was a guest there as well. How closely do<br />
you guard that image, because you know that's something a lot of people don't really have to<br />
ever think about in their day to day business life. How....<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, I think, I think, the office belongs the entire community. I mean I don't take a<br />
personalised view of the office. I mean, it is the most responsible position in the country, It's<br />
an immense privilege to occupy the position and I have a great sense of the history of it and<br />
people on both sides of politics, have made a contribution to that history and I always think of<br />
how it what, I do, whether it reflects favourably on Australia and on Australia's interests. I<br />
mean, that is my overwhelming, total preoccupation. Faxam 13/ 11/ 96 15: 21 Pg: 9 </p>
<p>Fax from KENNERLEY: But that whole image making aid politics being, politicians want to be as popular as possible.<br />
And the photo opportunity always goes a long way. And there have been politicians who have<br />
done some very interesting fun human side of things. Just have a look at these things.<br />
( Video played)<br />
KENNERLEY: Well, there you have the human face of politics. Peter Costello, your Treasurer dancing the<br />
Macarena. Did that damage his credibility?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
No, no it didn't. I think it is a question of doing things that you are comfortable with. And I<br />
think there is nothing worse then, just for the sake of a picture, do somiething that you feel<br />
awkward about and I've made it a habit never to do something that I feel awkward or<br />
unnatural in doing, Because I think it looks phoney, it looks contrived and people are entitled<br />
to say, there is Howard trying to get his photo on the front page of the newspaper. Now, I<br />
don't need to do that, it's foolish and it's not that I think that I think I'm any cleverer than the<br />
next bloke it's just that if you don't feel comfortable with something, don't do it.<br />
KENNERLEY:<br />
What did you say to your Treasurer after you ? 9<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I said it was pretty sharp. I said " that was pretty sharp". I really did. I mean, but when I saw<br />
Boris there, I mean, he's the last head of Government I've seen dancing in public and you see<br />
what happened to him! I mean, you've got to be a bit car efuil! I believe in pacing myself and<br />
it's just a question really of not looking a goose in public and some people have more<br />
flamboyant personalities and they can carry off the dancing and so forth. Others can't. They<br />
look strained, they look aritificial, they look silly, and it is really just a question of knowing<br />
what sort of person you are and always behaving in that fashion.<br />
IKENNERLEY: So I guess a quick dance of the limbo is out of the question?<br />
PRIME MINISTER.<br />
Definitely. I mean, I may have tried that 30 years ago, but<br />
KENNERLEY:<br />
When was the last time you did the limbo? Faxroii13/ 11/ 96 15: 21 Pg: </p>
<p>Fax from: PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Oh I would have done it in the 1960s at a few parties.<br />
KENNERLEY: Were you all right?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Oh, passable, passable.<br />
KENNERLEY: How low did you go?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
That's a trade secret. I did, it's a long time ago, but I did. But I'm not, that's a far while ago<br />
Kerri-Anne.<br />
KENNERLEY:<br />
You don't want to try it again?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
No, no, I feel, I'll just remember it.<br />
KENNERLEY: So I guess a quick version of Hound-dog is out of the question as well? And Geoff does do<br />
requests if you care to indulge in a little karaoke today?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
No, look, I am definitely not a good sort of actor in that sense. I just don't think I look.... I<br />
look awkward and I think that's just silly.<br />
KENNERLEY: Well, one of your passions I do know is cricket and I in fact was hoping for a bit of a helping<br />
hand. Now I have come into so much stick in the past week, where in Melbourne Shane<br />
Warne joined me in the studio and look there is my bowling. Now, every man I have spoken<br />
to since then has accused me of chucking.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Yes, yes, and you did! 13/ 11/ 96 15: 21 Pg: 11 </p>
<p>Fax from KENNERLEY: Well, okay, time for a little instruction. Would the Prime Minister instruct Kerni-Anne as to<br />
how to throw a cricket ball properly?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
No, no not to when you are bowling.<br />
KENNERLEY:<br />
How not to or how?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Not like that no.<br />
KENNERLEY: Well, we have got the amazing batsman, the amazing Geoffrey Harvey. Would you care to<br />
give me some instruction. Because my husband said to me, how could you throw a cricket<br />
ball.. you guys take this cricket seriously...<br />
PRIME MINISTER;<br />
Yes we do.<br />
KENNERLEY: He said, how could you throw, or don't you know how to in fact do this properly?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I think you do.<br />
KENNERLEY: Well, i honestly... what's the difference between chucking and throwing?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
You just do that.<br />
KENNERLEY: It's the arm movement, it's the rotation? 13/ 11/ 96 15: 21 Pg: 12 </p>
<p>13/ 11/ 96 15: 21 Pg: 13<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Yes, you just don't bend the elbow.<br />
KENNERLEY: You just don't bend the elbow?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
You just go over like that?<br />
KENNERLEY: See these are the Shane Warne cricket balls.<br />
( Prime Minister bowls cricket ball)<br />
KENNERLEY: So now I've got the movement down pat, shall I try it. The action I start like that.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well you don't have to. It depends on what your style is?<br />
KENNERLEY: What about this run up I see the chaps do?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, it depends whether you want to bowl fast. I wouldn't try it, it's too big a run up, in<br />
those high heels if I were you.<br />
KENNERLEY:<br />
It's the rotation of the arm.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
You just take it back like that. I mean, I'm not an expert at it.<br />
KENNERLEY: But cricket's your passion isn't it?<br />
Fax from </p>
<p>Fa rom13/ 11/ 96 15: 21 Pg: 14<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Cricket is my passion but I'm no good at it.<br />
KENNERLEY: Tell me, when Bill Clinton comes out here, this is quite a coup for you to get Bill Clinton.<br />
You haven't been to the White House, he officially is coming to Australia. That's pretty good<br />
isn't it?<br />
PRIME MINISTER;<br />
Yes, I'm quite impressed that he's coming. And I think he'll enjoy it. He's looking forward<br />
to it, he's never been to Australia before.<br />
KENNERLEY: Do you play golf?<br />
] PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Yes, but not as well as Greg Norman. I think he'll be playing with Gr-eg. Bill Clinton plays...<br />
look, it is Norman, Clinton, pause, Howard, as far as the quality of the golf is concerned. So<br />
as far as the quality of the golf is concerned. So I think Norman and Clinton will play and I'll<br />
sort of see what the result is.<br />
KENNERLEY: Because the agendas of the world are set on a golf course.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Ah yes..<br />
KENNERLEY:<br />
You wouldn't disagree with that?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
No, some of them are. JefflKennett and I sorted out a few things at the AFL grandfinal this<br />
year and I've made a few political decisions at test matches too, but I agree with you golf<br />
KENNERLEY: What was the most important thing you decided at the AFL with Jeff Kennett.?<br />
Fax from </p>
<p>Farxft 13/ 11/ 96 15: 21 Pg:<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
How to finance the remaining bit of the national guns campaign and I think banning those<br />
weapons is the best thing I've done as Prime Minister. I really do. And one of the little things<br />
that we wanted to do is how to tidy up the payment and I made a suggestion, I said to Jeff,<br />
we'll keep that under our hat and he announced it on the Sunday programme the next day!<br />
( To Geoff Harvey) Are you waiting are you Geoff?<br />
KENNERLEY: This has got to be the most expensive lesson in Australia, the most expensive cricket lesson in<br />
Australia. So it's behind here....<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
You've got to look over your shoulder. No no, you look at him!<br />
KENNERLEY: So here I go. ( KK bowls)<br />
PRIME MINISTER.,<br />
Very good. ( PM catches)<br />
( Applause)<br />
KENNERLEY: Ladies and gentlemen, Mr Howard thanks for joining us.<br />
