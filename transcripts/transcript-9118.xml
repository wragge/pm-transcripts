TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE. HON P J KEATING, MP<br />
INTERVIEW WITH KEVIN NAUGHTON, RADIO 8DD<br />
DARWIN, II FEBRUARY 1994<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
KN: you may have heard on AM earlier today, it seems that there was some mirth at<br />
the expense of Senator Bronwyn Bishop. The mirth occurred in the House of<br />
Representatives, and it seems as thughsome of Senator Bishop's colleagues didn't<br />
come to her rescue as a Bronwyn Bishop was doing the rounds of the Government<br />
benches. In fact, Michael Wooldridge actually crossed the floor to find out what<br />
the joke was, came back passed it around his colleagues and they all had a good<br />
giggle. Well, to find out just what the joke was, and other things, I am joined in the studio<br />
by Prime Minister, Paul Keating. Thanks for coming in.<br />
PM: Good, Kevin, nice to gee you.<br />
KN: What was the joke?<br />
PM: Just that as Kim Beazley was telling us about this dinner or lunch which Senator<br />
Bishop had attended, and where she had passed these remarks about economic<br />
policies in the ' 80s which had causcd some mirth at the lunch apparently, as he<br />
went on, it was quite a long answer, and not one person on the Coalition side got<br />
up to interrupt him. Up the back one of the National Party fellows got up to move<br />
an extension oftime, you see, so that was the joke.<br />
KN: So, it was as simple as that?<br />
PM: It was as simple as that. That sort of produced a general hubbub and giggle on<br />
both sides.<br />
KN: And a bit of humour for the day. Now, that's sort of been the issue that has<br />
stopped the Coalition, the one that has dogged the Government since half way<br />
through December has been the one relating to Sports and Environment Minister,<br />
Ros Kelly, known as the sports-rorts affair or whatever. It's an issue that has been<br />
around now for two months, that must do a bit of damage?<br />
PM: I think, look, it is a ripple in the Canberra pond I think. These things, you see,<br />
journalists, being professional, take the things up and have a look at them as they<br />
ID-</p>

turn up. But I think the public they tend to just put a big discount through all this<br />
stuff;, I mean, they come and go. And I think Ros Kelly's position is that no one<br />
has made any allegations stick that there is any fraud in any of this, so there is no<br />
fraud. Everyone is admitting that, even the Coalition. The Auditor said a program<br />
like this notionally is open to fraud. But the interesting thing about these sports<br />
grants, this is all the small sporting organisations in the country who might need<br />
facilities for, it could be netball, or it could be...<br />
KN: But hasn't the argument been, it is not a question of whether the money was spent<br />
in the right areas or not.<br />
PM: I am just going to make this point to you. It has to be spent before it is<br />
recompensed. So, it is not a matter of writing a cheque which is then basically<br />
wasted or blown or something, it has actually got to be spent and then it is<br />
recompensed. So, therefore the opportunities of this thing being open to abuse are<br />
fairly diminished.<br />
KN: But isn't the argument the fact that decisions are made in the Ministers office, as<br />
opposed to in the Department?<br />
PM: Yes, that's the charge by the Liberal Party, saying that there is political bias in<br />
themn, but when the Coalition government decided to, you know, build a dam here<br />
and build an airport strip there, they were made in Ministers' offices too. I don't<br />
think you can pin a Minister and say that decisions are necessarily wrong because<br />
they are made in the Minister's office. 1 mean, I was the Treasurer of this country<br />
for nearly ten years and most of the primary decisions I took were made by me.<br />
KN: On white boards?<br />
PM: They were made, often, in my head. No boards at all.<br />
KN: Let's go on to that question of white boards.<br />
PM: That is what happens. You can be in a discussion on the matter which I have seen<br />
this in the Expenditure Review Committee of the Government on many occasions,<br />
discussing something, and come back a day later and propose something that has<br />
no paper at all. I mean, this idea that there has to be a sort of paper thing that has<br />
got to be recommended by the Departmcnt is just simply an invention of a couple<br />
of characters on the front bench of thc current Opposition.<br />
KN: And also a question of concern for the Auditor-General, but just going back to that<br />
question of plitical damage,_ because the story has been around now for a while.<br />
Things like this white board angle, those sort of things can go into folk lore. Now<br />
somcone suggested to me today that if the Australian Taxation Office knocked on<br />
a small business and said where's your records for the last seven years and the<br />
business person said well they were all on a white board, the Taxation Office<br />
wouldi wear that would they?<br />
PM: No, but what's happened here is that all of the proposals which Mrs Kelly has<br />
approved camne from the department with recommendations. When I say with<br />
recommendations. not that which one or the other should be approved, but that<br />
they were all adoptable. The choice was then a matter for hers after making<br />
04-11-93 14: 11Me </p>
<p>04.-11-93 14: 12 0-P3<br />
3<br />
judgements about each particular one. 1 mean, we do elect Ministers to make<br />
decisions. And what the Coalition is saying, that this is shocling, this Minister's<br />
actually made a whole lot of choices here, this is dreadfiul. You know, if there is<br />
not a bit of departmental paper with some wallahs name on it, it's a stew.<br />
KN: So Ministerial decisions are part and parcel of the political landscape?<br />
PM: Exactly, 1 mean, one of the things about this government is that, you see before the<br />
Labor Government in 1983, the place was run by the bureaucracy. That's why<br />
Australia was in a hole. I mean, the power of Ministers to make decisions is a very<br />
important thing. Now, what the Coalition is saying is look, we want to see a<br />
recommendation from the departmcnt recommending this particular thing against<br />
that particular thing. Whereas if all of the proposals coming from the department<br />
to Mrs Kelly are adoptable ones, it is then a matter for her to decide which ones<br />
arc adopted. Now, whether she does it in her head, on a white board, or doodles<br />
on a pad, I mean, in the end, I don't think it matters. But, I mean, we have got all<br />
this sort hand wringing. Last night we had Paul Lyneham on doing the second<br />
interview for the week with Senator Kernorand she had her most misty expression<br />
possible, more in sorrow than in anger she said that, you know, Mrs Kelly should<br />
go. The previous two nights she said there shouldn't be a whitewash by the House<br />
of Representatives Committee. So Mrs Kelly turned up, took 300 questions,<br />
that wasn't enough apparently. You know Senator Kernot is now again talking<br />
about some inquiry. With these minor parties there is always veiled threats<br />
through their remarks. And then saying we will think about all this. The fact is,<br />
this has gone on for weeks. Not a sole, not a member of the Coalition, not<br />
anybody has established that there is any fraud here or anything wrong. It is really<br />
just a matter of choice about decisions and they don't like our priorities.<br />
KN: But it is certainly a story that you would like to see go away?<br />
PM: Look, Kevin, it will either linger longer or it will go. In the end, it won't make a<br />
tinkers cuss worth of difference to what happens to the country in the broad.<br />
KN: Now thc reason that you are in Darwin for the football match between<br />
Collingwood, of which you are a member, and the Aboriginal Allstars. The match<br />
obviously attracted your attention when Allan McAlister got in touch?<br />
PM: He said to me would I like to come. And I thought it was a good thing to do. I<br />
think the match is a good match. I think it is a good idea and being associated<br />
with Collingwood, and having a fairly big spot in my heart and mind for the<br />
-Aboriginal. people of this country, I thought this was a good opportunity,<br />
particularly for Aboriginal sports men and women. And I see this as basically a<br />
celebration of them.<br />
KN. Charlie Perkins said yesterday that, to many Aborigines, sport is one of the few<br />
ways in which they can change some the lifestyles that they've been stuck with<br />
because of family and social tragedy.<br />
PM. Well I agree with that. I think that is right. 113-P. 03 </p>
<p>04-11-93 ENDS<br />
041-3 13 I D-P. 04414:<br />
4<br />
KN: So can you see the value of this game then being telecast and broadcast all over<br />
Australia as, if you like, a very big and public step into, perhaps, widening that<br />
whole process?<br />
PM: Well I think it is just another recognition of the fact that the Aboriginal community<br />
of this country have delivered to the nation great sports men and women. And that<br />
they excel in all codes and they do it often. In this, we'e got, drawn together<br />
from around the country, Aboriginal players of Australian Rules and, of course, a<br />
fair contingent from the Northern Territory, playing one of the great sides of<br />
Australia, Collingwood.<br />
KN: The great side?<br />
PM: The great side, well I think the greatest sporting club in the country.<br />
KN: Not much argument here about that. Finally, there is going to be a bookmaker out<br />
there, who are you backing, or is that a stupid question?<br />
PM: I don't think there is going to be any losers out of this, you see. I know someone<br />
is going to end up winning on the day, but T think everyone is going to win because<br />
1 think it is a good thing to do and it is a celebration of the huge contribution and<br />
athleticismi of Australian Aboriginal people, in this case Australian Aboriginal men,<br />
into this code. So I wouldnft want to try and pick this one, Kevin, I know you are<br />
a Collingwood supporter and maybe the underdog bias in us would have us go for<br />
Collingwood. I have got divided loyalties on this one.<br />
KN: Okay, Prime Minister Keating thanks for your time.<br />
PM: Thank you Kevin. </p>
