SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P. J. KEATING, MP<br />
THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENrs COMMITMENTS FOR THE UNITED<br />
NATIONS FOURTH WORLD CONFERENCE ON WOMEN<br />
TUESDAY 29 AUGUST 1995<br />
I am pleased to be here today to mark Australia's involvement in the United<br />
Nations' Fourth World Conference on Women.<br />
Many people are cynical about international conferences. Some media<br />
reports over the last week have referred to the United Nation's Conference as<br />
a " talkfest", meaning all talk and no action.<br />
We all know the syndrome. You don't have to be a cynic to recognise it<br />
very often, just a casual observer.<br />
It is true that, in many countries, implementation of the Strategies document<br />
for the Advancement of Women from the Third World Conference has been<br />
slow or non-existent.<br />
The desire for faster progress towards true equality for women and men is<br />
behind the idea that all nations should commit themselves to tackling the<br />
most pressing needs of women in their own countries, before the UN<br />
Conference.<br />
And not just commit themselves. " Talkfests" commit themselves. We should<br />
be suspicious of the word " commit" unless there is evidence of the will to<br />
actually do.<br />
The Australian Government welcomes this Conference of Commitments. We<br />
are very proud to have initiated it. But we stress the meaning from the start<br />
by commitment we mean doing.<br />
Having had some experience of international conferences and the way the<br />
UN works, I know this could not have been an easy task and I congratulate<br />
the head of 05W, Kathy Townsend, and her team. </p>
<p>For many years, Australia has been an international pacesetter on status of<br />
women issues. The recently released United Nations Development Program<br />
report on women points to Australia as having one of the best records,<br />
ranking number six out of 130 countries on a range of criteria including<br />
women's share of income and participation in education.<br />
As I said in a speech to the Press Club last week, this sort of achievement<br />
does not come about haphazardly or accidentally or through good public<br />
relations. It is the result of thinking and doing the long hard slog of policy<br />
development and implementation.<br />
We could not commit ourselves to the things I will announce today without the<br />
policy foundation we have laid for women since 1983.<br />
Policies which have supported the dramatic increase in women's participation<br />
in education and the labour force; a network of affordable, quality child care;<br />
significant real increases in family assistance paid to women; the<br />
establishment of a National Women's Health Program; the introduction of the<br />
Sex Discrimination Act; and the extension of superannuation to 85 per cent of<br />
women workers.<br />
These policies are just part of the Government's program of reform to improve<br />
the status of women. And we are proud of our achievements.<br />
But satisfaction is not complacency. Reform never stops.<br />
For the Government's commitments to be effective, they must give expression<br />
to the needs, concerns, ambitions and interests of Australian women.<br />
The Australian Council for Women, headed by Sandra Yates, was set up to<br />
advise the Government in the lead-up to the Conference on how we could<br />
address the barriers to the advancement of women.<br />
The Council consulted with women's organisations, held community<br />
consultations and conducted the " Purple Postcard Campaign", which asked<br />
women to tell the Government the one thing that concerned them. Not<br />
surprisingly, most women told us more than one thing.<br />
The Government also commissioned research which sought the opinions of<br />
women who were likely to miss out on putting their views through the more<br />
formal channels of consultation.<br />
We learned a great deal about the concerns of Australian women. But four<br />
general areas emerged as the primary focus -for change and it is in these four<br />
areas that the Government is determined to advance the status of women.<br />
The four areas are: balancing work and family responsibilities; violence;<br />
health; and public life and decision-making. </p>
<p>The most important area raised by women was the challenge of balancing<br />
work and family responsibilities.<br />
In the consultations, women made it clear that they thought their position had<br />
improved markedly. In particular, they said that today they had more<br />
freedom, choice and opportunity.<br />
But they also recognised the downside of these changes. Unfortunately,<br />
because now women can do anything, they often end up doing everything.<br />
As one women put it, her life consists of " Juggling everything, especially work<br />
with the children." She was " the first to get up and the last to go to bed."<br />
And this is not just hearsay and anecdote. There is concrete evidence of it.<br />
Just last week the Australian Institute of Family Studies released a report<br />
showing that the majority of women still had the main responsibility for<br />
household tasks such as cooking, cleaning, shopping and laundry, even<br />
when the women were in full-time paid employment.<br />
Essentially, there is little Government can do to help with this modern<br />
malaise. The " double shift" which women talk about is not one that<br />
governments can arbitrate.<br />
But there are things the Government can do to help women cope with their<br />
different roles.<br />
Many women pointed out that real equality had yet to be achieved in the<br />
workplace. The Working Women Centres set up by the Government can play<br />
an important role here in ensuring equity for women at work.<br />
Over the past six months, the existing five Working Women Centres have<br />
received more than 3,500 enquires from women about work-related matters.<br />
The centres provide information and assistance to women on issues such as<br />
pay, working condit * ions, enterprise bargaining and training. They are<br />
particularly important for blue collar women and are probably the most<br />
important source of information on employment issues for women from non-<br />
English speaking or indigenous backgrounds.<br />
I am pleased to say that the centres have been welcomed by women and<br />
women's organisations. The only thing that has not been welcomed is that<br />
two States do not have a centre.<br />
Today, I am announcing that the Government will set up Working Women<br />
Centres in Victoria and Western Australia, providing national coverage for<br />
this important resource. Given the direction which Jeff Kennett and Richard<br />
Court are taking industrial relations and employment conditions in their<br />
States, I predict that the centres will see brisk business in Victoria and<br />
Western Australia. </p>
<p>Another issue raised by women juggling work and family responsibilities is<br />
the difficulty of taking leave to care for sick children. There was strong<br />
support for making existing leave more flexible. The Government agrees with<br />
this position and will argue it before the Industrial Relations Commission.<br />
Women were also very strong in their support for the choice to stay at home<br />
to care for their children full-time. And there was a view that the needs of<br />
women at home were often overlooked.<br />
One area where this issue can be addressed at the outset is the new<br />
communications and information technology. The new technology is set to<br />
transform all our lives and we must ensure that the technology does serve the<br />
interests of all Australians, not just those in the workforce or in education. I<br />
have asked the National Information Services Council to advise how the new<br />
technologies can respond to the needs and interests of women working fulltime<br />
at home.<br />
In the consultations, women at home raised the need for training to up-date<br />
their skills: some were concerned that they would be left behind in the<br />
information revolution. To address this, I have also asked the Council to<br />
develop proposals for the training of women at home in the new technologies.<br />
The Council will also report on how all women, including women in rural and<br />
remote communities, can get equitable access to the new communications<br />
services. The Taskforce on Women and Communications Technologies in<br />
the Office of the Status of Women will be extended to ensure that women's<br />
participation in the development of new technologies is maximised.<br />
During the last election I announced the New National Agenda for Women. I<br />
remember at the time saying that perhaps the most sobering message to<br />
have come from our consultations for the New Agenda was the fear of<br />
voilence felt by women in Australia violence on the streets and in the home.<br />
Regretfully, I must say that violence is still one of women's main concerns.<br />
We must and can do more to stop it.<br />
There have been very successful projects in the United States and New<br />
Zealand which show that coordinating the assistance and response of<br />
governments, police, legal services and community agencies leads to a lower<br />
level of violence against women, and fewer repeat offences.<br />
The Commonwealth will work with State and Territory governments to<br />
develop an integrated approach to stopping violence against women.<br />
In the consultations, women frequently raised the need for early education to<br />
reduce violence. The Government will contribute towards running forums in<br />
each State and Territory to develop effective ways of dealing with violence in<br />
Australian schools. </p>
<p>In the area of women's health, many women spoke of the need to give priority<br />
to better health services for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women who<br />
face additional problems because of discrimination, isolation and ignorance<br />
of their needs.<br />
The Government will introduce a new program targeted at Aboriginal and<br />
Torres Strait Islander women. The Healthy Women, Strong Families Program<br />
for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Women will focus on health checks;<br />
maternal and infant health monitoring; and health promotion and prevention.<br />
Special attention will be given to rural and remote communities where such<br />
services are currently inadequate.<br />
Last week, Frank Blount, the head of Telstra observed that at the same time<br />
as the status and influence of women have expanded, and at the same time<br />
as women are generally outperforming men educationally, the proportion of<br />
women senior managers in Australia's largest companies actually fell. As he<br />
said, " There is something quite evidently wrong here".<br />
To promote women's participation in public life and decision-making, the<br />
Government will assist in the establishment of a national peak body of women<br />
in business. The Australian Council of Businesswomen will provide a<br />
stronger voice for women in business to Government, business networks, the<br />
media and the community generally.<br />
The Government will also encourage women's participation on private sector<br />
boards. We will work in partnership with the Australian Institute of Company<br />
Directors, the Business Council of Australia and the Australian Chamber of<br />
Commerce and Industry on a three-year initiative to increase the appointment<br />
of women of merit to private sector company boards.<br />
I have concentrated today on the Government's commitments to women in<br />
Australia. But we also have a responsibility to assist less wealthy countries in our<br />
region in their efforts to improve the status of women. Australia has been the<br />
lead regional donor for the Pacific region in the lead up to the Conference<br />
and we will continue in this partnership. Australia will provide funds to nongovernment<br />
organisations in the Pacific Island nations to assist in the<br />
implementation of commitments arising from the Conference.<br />
It gives me great pleasure to hand the Government's national commitments<br />
for women over to my colleague, Dr Carmen Lawrence, who will announce<br />
them on behalf of Australia at the United Nations' Fourth Conference for<br />
Women. I wish Australia's delegation to the Conference and the women attending the<br />
forum for Non-Government Organisations well, and I thank all the Australian<br />
women who voiced their concerns and contributed to the development of the<br />
Government's commitments to improve the status of women. </p>
