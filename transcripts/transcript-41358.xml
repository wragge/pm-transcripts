    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Turnbull Government will, having consulted His Excellency, recommend the Governor General appoint former High Court Judge the Honourable Kenneth Madison Hayne AC as Royal Commissioner into Misconduct in the Banking, Superannuation and Financial Services Industry.</p>
<p>Kenneth Hayne was a Justice of the High Court of Australia from 1997 to 2015. He was first appointed to the Bench in 1992 as a Justice of the Supreme Court of Victoria, later serving on the Victorian Court of Appeal until his appointment to the High Court.</p>
<p>Mr Hayne commenced practice at the Victorian Bar in 1971, and was appointed a Queen’s Counsel in 1984. He holds degrees in arts and law from the University of Melbourne, and was Victoria’s Rhodes Scholar in 1969, graduating as a Bachelor of Civil Law from Oxford University.</p>
<p>He was appointed a Companion in the General Division of the Order of Australia in 2002.</p>
<p>Mr Hayne’s wealth of experience at the highest levels of Australia's judiciary makes him the ideal person to conduct this Royal Commission.</p>
<p>He is renowned for his brilliant mind, his forensic skill, and his deep sense of justice.</p>
<p>The Royal Commission has been established to consider the conduct of banks, insurers, financial services providers and superannuation funds (not including self-managed superannuation funds). All Australians have the right to be treated honestly and fairly in their dealings with the financial services industry.</p>
