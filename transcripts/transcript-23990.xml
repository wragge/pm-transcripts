    <content><![CDATA[<p>What a thrill to be here at this iconic Australian landmark, this sacred site in the city of Melbourne.</p>
<p>Thatâs what it is: a sacred site, here, in the city of Melbourne.</p>
<p>I acknowledge the Leader of the Victorian Opposition the Labor Partyâs Dan Andrews.</p>
<p>I acknowledge my good friend Premier Denis Napthine â a great friend of the Indian community.</p>
<p>Most of all I acknowledge so many people here to support our country, to support our relationship with magnificent India.</p>
<p>I believe last Sunday, there was a train full of people that left Melbourne for Sydney.Â  It was dubbed âthe Modi Expressâ.</p>
<p>I have a feeling âthe Modi Expressâ has just come back to Melbourne!</p>
<p>Itâs good that we are here at the Melbourne Cricket Ground because it is said that India and Australia share a great passion â we both love beating England at cricket.</p>
<p>It is a nice marker in our history that the first ever Test series that India played after independence was against Australia.</p>
<p>It was the first Test series that India played after independence against Australia and the third Test of that series was played here at the Melbourne Cricket Ground.</p>
<p>It was in that game that Sir Donald Bradman, who is as much a hero in India as in Australia, scored a century in both innings â very good for Donald.</p>
<p>In the fourth Test, The Don had to share the limelight with Vijay Hazare who became the first Indian cricketer ever to score a century in both innings of a Test match.</p>
<p>So, whatever the good Don could do, India â independent India â was able to trump.</p>
<p>Now, cricket is a wonderful game. Itâs great to be here at the Cricket Ground but the relationship between Australia and India is about so much more than cricket.</p>
<p>We share a common heritage, we share a history, but our greatest bond â the greatest bond between our two countries â is the half million Australians of Indian background who have contributed so much to building modern Australia.</p>
<p>I want to say to all of you, your hard work, your commitment to family and community, your willingness to âhave a goâ has made this great country even greater.</p>
<p>In any one year, there are about 40,000 Indian students studying here in Australia â many of them here in Melbourne.</p>
<p>Our duty â and I say this particularly here in Melbourne, Victoria â our duty is to take care of them as our own and to let all of them become ambassadors for India here and for Australia when they go home.</p>
<p>And with the New Colombo Plan, which is now swinging into action, thousands of Australian students will study in India â and they can be ambassadors for both of our countries as well.</p>
<p>I have to say I feel that I have got to know Prime Minister Modi very well here in Australia over the last few days but before that in India where I was his first overseas visitor after he became Prime Minister.</p>
<p>I regard Prime Minister Modi as more than a kindred spirit â as almost a brother.</p>
<p>He wants more trade, more jobs and more investment in infrastructure.</p>
<p>His commitment is to âred carpet, not red tapeâ because he recognises that the foundation of wealth starts with the private sector.</p>
<p>And we both believe that the keys to our countriesâ success is the power of our people.</p>
<p>Now, I want to say a very personal message to my fellow Australians of Indian background in closing these remarks: you have come to a magnificent country.</p>
<p>I say to all of my fellow Australians of Indian background: you have come to a magnificent country but you have come from a country that is led by a magnificent man and I know you will make him extremely welcome tonight.</p>
