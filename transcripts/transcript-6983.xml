SESQUI CENTENARY SEMINAR0<br />
SOUTH AUSTRlALIAN EXPORTERS ASSOCIATION<br />
ADELAIDE 13 AUGUST 1986<br />
I an indeed pleased to be able to address you today and to<br />
open this sesqui-contenary seminar.<br />
ThiG address is particularly significant because it occurs<br />
at time when Australia will necd to rely more than ever on<br />
the pgoductiveness and inventiveness of our exporters and<br />
thocco competing against imports.<br />
The tliame of your seminar is well chosen: " Australian<br />
Expo: ers where But with just a little reflection I<br />
thin" that the answer will be simple enough: " Just about<br />
everrp; herel".<br />
I cay that because Australia's current combination of unit<br />
labour costs and exchange rate means that Australian.<br />
exporters are highly competitive in virtually all of our<br />
major7 markets indeed more competitive, on average, than we<br />
have been for at least twenty years.<br />
Labor intends to preserve that competitive edge. Labor has<br />
been putting policies in place over the past three and a<br />
halfr years to wake up complacent Australian industry and<br />
give it the chance denied it by the Coalition. Labor's<br />
policies provide a timely foundation on which to build a<br />
reo:;-onse to the new demands of world trade.<br />
in many ways this group is the one most aware of both the<br />
reasons for Australia's improved competitiveness and of the<br />
reacons behind our present straitened national economic<br />
circumstances. Exporters, in particular, have benefited from the dramatic<br />
decline in the real cost of employing labour which has<br />
occurred under the Accord. Real unit labour costs have<br />
fallen by 7 per cent during the past three years an<br />
achievement which few industrialised countries have matched<br />
at any time. </p>
<p>Exporters too, have appreciated the benefits of the more<br />
harmonious industrial relations environment achieved under<br />
the Accoird an environment which has produced the lowest<br />
levels of indus~ trial disputation in 18 years and has<br />
significantly enhanced our reliability as a supplier. This<br />
fact wao readily acknowledged by Japanese political and<br />
industrial leaders during my recent visit.<br />
Exporters stand also to benefit greatly from our clear<br />
sighted decision to free the exchange rate from artificial<br />
restraints, to eschew the Coalition's policy to hold the<br />
dollar artificially high and instead to let exporters<br />
compete fairly on world markets.<br />
But expo., ters are only too painfully aware of the sharp<br />
falls in the international prices paid for some of our major<br />
commodities over the past year or so,<br />
Measured against a basket of world currencies metals prices,<br />
on average, fell 17 per cent over 1985-86, and non-food<br />
agricultural products by 15 per cent. In just the June<br />
quarter wheat prices fell 23 per cent in US dollar terms,<br />
and have fallen still further since.<br />
As you know Australia's exports are dominated by<br />
agricultuz-al commodities, minerals and metals.<br />
Over the long term, the real prices which we receive for<br />
these products have been declining, especially relative to<br />
the prices we pay for imports.<br />
From time to time prices for one or other of these commodity<br />
groups have fallen sharply.<br />
But rarely in Australia's recent hi story have the prices for<br />
virtually all major commodity groups fallen sharply<br />
together.<br />
Now is such a time.<br />
The goods that we export now purchase far fewer imports. To<br />
cover the gap we have been borrowing heavily from overseas.<br />
We simply cannot go on living on even more credit.<br />
That is just another way of saying that Australia's capacity<br />
to maintain living standards has declined, temporarily at<br />
least. In the year to March, 3 per cent was cut from the growth of<br />
our national economic capacity because of adverse movements<br />
in the terms of trade. In money terms Australia has lost<br />
$ 6500 million of its national income since late 1984. There<br />
has been a further fall since.<br />
It would be heartening to think that, in fairly quick time,<br />
prices will move back in our favour and the problem solve<br />
itself. </p>
<p>3<br />
But while prospects are looking better for some commodities,<br />
that is not likely to be true generally.<br />
The world's agricultural surpluses and the subsidy practices<br />
of the US and the EEC hang like a pall over those markets,<br />
probably for years to come.<br />
Many minerals and metals are in chronic oversupply partly<br />
because of the induced expansion of capacity during the last<br />
abortive Go called " resources boom" and partly because of<br />
the changjing technology of production of manufactures.<br />
Australia has not caused these world-wide conditions.<br />
Australia, under Labor, is far better equipped now to<br />
respond tc, those conditions than three years ago.<br />
But Austiralians have a major task ahead.<br />
We need to renew our efforts to secure markets for our<br />
traditioaial exports. We need dramatically to improve our<br />
share of world trade in manufactures and services. Of<br />
course, wo also need to obtain a larger share of our home<br />
market. The trick will be to secure those adjustments at least cost<br />
and to mia: imize the long-term gains.<br />
Next vieoh~ s Budget is an investment in our future and that<br />
of our children.<br />
it gives me no joy to have to foreshadow a tough Budget.<br />
But there is no other responsible or fair course open to a<br />
Government dedicated to maximising long-term job prospects.<br />
Mlaximum expenditure restraint is necessary and will be<br />
delivered2. A reduction in the Budget deficit is necessary<br />
and will, be delivered.<br />
Meeting these commitments may to cost us political<br />
popularity in the short term. When you inherit a budget<br />
framework within which 70 per cent of outlays are locked in<br />
by indexation and similar arrangements obviously your range<br />
of savings options is limited. By contrast, at the start of<br />
the Fraser Government the " lock-in" factor was only 59 per<br />
cent. As a result of our inheritance we have had to take decisions<br />
that in better times we would not have been forced to make.<br />
It would have been simpler to have dodged those decisions.<br />
It would also have jeopardized the long-term economic health<br />
of this country and the ultimate well-being of thousands of<br />
ordinary Australians.<br />
We have taken these decisions because we believe they are<br />
the right decisions. But in doing so we have also ensured<br />
that no section of the community has had to carry an unfair<br />
share of the necessary sacrifices. </p>
<p>4<br />
without those collective sacrifices Australia could only<br />
begin to pay its way again in the world by massively lower<br />
investment and massively increasing unemployment.<br />
A lower Sudget deficit directly reduces the need of the<br />
economy as a whole to borrow abroad.<br />
It eases r.' essures for an upward spiral of interest rates<br />
and helps to create an environment for greater exchange rate<br />
stability.<br />
It thus holips to underpin investor confidence and encourages<br />
the employmient creating investment which ultimately has' to<br />
provide tho basis of the revival of our trading performance.<br />
There is na doubt that the growth of economic activity and<br />
employmcn will be slower, for a time, because of the need<br />
to cope with our new external circumstances.<br />
Few would doubt, too, that it will take a little time for<br />
the benefits of the measures which we have to take to become<br />
apparont.<br />
But there is also no doubt that the course which we have<br />
charted for Australia will bear fruit.<br />
one reanon for my optimism is my faith in the talents,<br />
dedication and inventiveness of Australians working together<br />
in common cause.<br />
For that I have, not least, the evidence of the past three<br />
years. Australians working together have transformed our<br />
economy from the depths of recession to growth sufficient to<br />
provide new jobs for 630,000 Australians.<br />
But, just as fundamentally, I have the evidence of the basic<br />
restructuring of the Australian economy which Labor began<br />
three years ago.<br />
From th3 start Labor has encouraged a more outward-looking<br />
manufacturing sector.<br />
Labor introduced the 150 per cent tax write-off for<br />
industrial research and development and the Grants for<br />
Industry Research and Development Scheme.<br />
Labor reformed our national export marketing effort and<br />
instituted Austrade.<br />
In sharp contrast to the rhetoric of our predecessors, Labor<br />
has begun to reduce the regulatory burden on business.<br />
More recently, of course, Labor has announced a further<br />
package of measures to promote exports. Importantly for<br />
exporters in this State, this package includes a number of<br />
studies into transport handling and related infrastructure<br />
costs. </p>
<p>And these measures have gone hand in hand with an<br />
outstanding record in reducing business costs, boosting<br />
business profitability and providing Jobs.<br />
Where would Australia be now if Labor's policieG had not<br />
prepared the ground so well?<br />
As to the maintenance of Australia's enhanced<br />
competitiveness, the sheer size of the depreciation of the<br />
Australian dollar since January 1985, together with the wage<br />
restraint achieved over the past three years, provide solid<br />
groundG for confidence on this score. 0<br />
But tho depreciation itself has become a source of inflation<br />
in Australia, with our inflation rate standing at nearly<br />
three times the OECD average.<br />
The Accord has delivered a truly remarkable degree of<br />
aggreg:-ate wage flexibility over the past three years.<br />
Compliance with the centralised system of wages fixation has<br />
been outstanding. in fact, the latest statistics put<br />
earnings drift over the year to M'ay at a meagre 1 1/ 4 per<br />
cent, a truly remarkable result at a time of rapid<br />
employment growth.<br />
Award wac~ es will increase by only 2.3 per cent in 1986.<br />
This includes acceptance of a 2 per cent discount for the<br />
effectc of depreciation in 1985 and some deferral until next<br />
year of the wage adjustment which would otherwise have<br />
occurred in the second half of 1986.<br />
Labor wiill continue to seek wages outcomes appropriate to<br />
the economic circumstances.<br />
It is inevitable that this will require in 1987 wage rises<br />
significantly less than inflation.<br />
I would like to spend a little time contrasting Labor's<br />
strategy for economic adjustment with the snake oil being<br />
peddled by Mr Howard and his colleagues. Mr Howard has<br />
promised zero Commonwealth outlays growth for 3 years and a<br />
balanced Budget in the third year.<br />
How does he intend to deliver on these promises? Very<br />
badly, if his other promises are any guide.<br />
He has promised a veritable litany of tax relief measures<br />
which would cost the Budget around $ 1.8 billion: and this<br />
does not include the cost of income splitting, which could<br />
add $ 2.7 billion.<br />
Nor has Mr Howard been backward in coming forward with extra<br />
spending promises.<br />
He is an ardent critic of the level of welfare spending, but<br />
has repeated his promise to repeal the Assets Test. The<br />
Coalition has made specific promises of additional defence<br />
spending, a $ 500 million rural package, construction of an<br />
Alice Springs t~ o Darwin railway and a pork barrel full of<br />
other spending promises. Conservatively the cost of these<br />
promises is $ 1.2 billion. </p>
<p>Mr Howard's hypocrisy and sheer dishonesty is most clearly<br />
demonstrated in the cost of these promises: a doficit<br />
blowout of $ 3 billion, even without income splitting.<br />
Where vill Mr Howard get the $ 3 billion needed just to hold<br />
the deficit at last year's level? And where will he get the<br />
extra $ 5750 million needed to bring down a balanced Budget<br />
in 3 years' time?<br />
Mr Howazd is suffering from a $ 9 billion credibility gap.<br />
There ic a certain symmetry between that and the $ 9.6<br />
billion budget deficit legacy which he handed over to Labor<br />
in 1983.<br />
Mr Howard's wages policy is no less deceitfurl than his<br />
fiscal policy. He wants to deregulate the labour market<br />
allegedly to give Australia greater real wage flexibility.<br />
I am astonished by Mr Howard's ignorance of recent economic<br />
history, in which he was a key player. As Treasurer in the<br />
early 2.980s, he presided over a system of decentralised wage<br />
fixing. The result was industrial chaos and double digit<br />
wages growth during a time when the economy could scarcely<br />
afford it.<br />
The Accord has delivered the lowest real unit labour costs<br />
and the lowest level of industrial disputation for nearly<br />
two decades. it has manifestly delivered both real wiage<br />
flexibility and jobs growth.<br />
For a present-day experiment with a deregulated labour<br />
market wie need only look at the UK. In spite of<br />
unemployment in excess of 13 per cent, and in spite of Mrs<br />
Thatcher's anti-union campaign, British unions have secured<br />
real wage increases averaging 3.5 per cent per annum over<br />
the past 3 years.<br />
Contrast that with an average annual fall in real wages in<br />
Australia of 1.7 per cent over the same period. Instead of<br />
learning from these experiments, Mr Howard has promised<br />
Australia a thousand Mudginberri's a return to the<br />
confrontation and divisiveness that marked his in auspicious<br />
stint in Government.<br />
Mr Howard has dishonest and empty rhetoric.<br />
Labor has the policies to lead Australia through the<br />
external difficulties imposed upon us. And I am pleased to<br />
note the growing number of companies taking up the export<br />
challenge in response to the boost in Australia's<br />
competitiveness.<br />
My colleague John Brown recently attended the ceremony<br />
marking the completion of the White Industries Construction<br />
Project in Singapore involving the building of some 15,000<br />
home units. </p>
<p>7<br />
In the development and project management field, the<br />
Adelaide based enterprise Pak Poy and Kneebone is involved<br />
in several c-a~ or overseas projects including the Manila<br />
Light Rail ~ iransit System and the $ 3 billion Bintulu<br />
Regional Centre in Malaysia. This company has formed a<br />
joint venture partnership with a US company in order to<br />
increase its activities in the US urban and resort<br />
development narket.<br />
I see that enother of your local companies here in Adelaide,<br />
Visions SyStems Limited, has won a contract to supply an<br />
electronic surveillance system as part of the United States<br />
space shuttle program.<br />
Several coapanies which have broken into the difficult<br />
Japanese mart; et include Dunlop Sheridan with their bed<br />
lines, Solahart with hot water services, and each of Raml,<br />
Tessa and Sabel in furniture products.<br />
I recently had the pleasure of visiting N~ ucleus LiQited in<br />
Sydney a company which has carved out for itself a niche<br />
in international markets, where it has been able to<br />
successfully market high technology medical equipment, heart<br />
pacemakerG and the so-called " bionic ear". Last year this<br />
company exported around 90 per cent of its production.<br />
And Neville Wran's favourite wine Rosemount Chardonnay<br />
is set to make it big with other Rosemount varieties on the<br />
US West Coast. The first shipment left for San Francisco<br />
just last wieek.<br />
There are many other examples I could cite covering a broad<br />
range of products and services from Pop Art sculptures to<br />
computer hardware and software, to laser technology and<br />
pharmaceutical products. Perhaps one of the most unusual<br />
examples I have heard of recently is the success of a Sydney<br />
company, Dinkum Dogs, in exporting hot dog heating machines<br />
to the US.<br />
As diverse and unusual as these examples might be, I suggest<br />
they all have one factor in common a dedicated and dynamic<br />
management and staff, committed to seeking out new<br />
challenges and successes.<br />
Already there are signs that these individual efforts are<br />
beginning to have the desired aggregrate impact. Real<br />
exports 7ose 14 per cent in the year to March 1986 and the<br />
real growth of imports slowed to less than 1 per cent. Most<br />
significantly real imports seem actually to have declined in<br />
the early part of 1986. Unfortunately the impact of this on<br />
our balance of payments has been masked by the continued<br />
deterioration in our terms of trade over the period.<br />
Australians have repeatedly demonstrated a capacity to work<br />
together during difficult times. The great economic<br />
recovery and national reconciliation that pulled this<br />
country out of the deep recession of the early 1980s is<br />
recent testimony to that capacity. </p>
<p>8<br />
The difficulties we face today are different to those of a<br />
few years ago. But our sense of national purpose is<br />
undiminished. My Governmant's policies will ensure that the large boost to<br />
the international competitiveness of Australian industry is<br />
maintained. I am confident that you, as exporters, will<br />
take full advantage of the opportunities to build on our<br />
existing successes on world markets and thereby help<br />
Australia to trade its way out of its current difficulties. </p>
