RIME MNNTEER<br />
FOR MEDJA rid ay_, 8 M ar ch 198 3<br />
In line wqith the coir,; r-itmerit Igave last week, I: tod ay re] ease<br />
details of Treasury projections of the B~ udget deficit for<br />
the 1983/ 84 financial year.<br />
The projections formy. the Treasury. estimate of a $ 9.6 billion<br />
def icit for 1983/ 84, the essential. outline of which was m-iade<br />
available to the Treasurer, Mr Howard, during the Course of<br />
the election campaign but which w-. as kept secret. by hiin and<br />
the then Prime Minister, Mr Fraser.<br />
-The projections were prepared on the basis of " no change"<br />
in t4-he policies that were in effect at t~ he beginning of the<br />
election campaign.<br />
They demonstrate beyond doubt that it is nonsense for mnembers<br />
of the former Government to argue that the $ 9.6 billion deficit<br />
forecast represents the " first bids" of Departments arnd<br />
could easily have bheen trimnmed. They parti-cu] arly Idemr~ onstratcthe<br />
absurdity of the claim by the former Prime M. nister that<br />
" Icompetent Ministers would have knockcd $ 3 billion of-f that<br />
figure before it. was ever p.. resented L. o Ca--binet'. 2/. </p>
<p>In fact, the Treaisury projections aire made on the basis sim, ply<br />
of a continuation of the previous Government's policies and<br />
make no allowance for any " bids" that Departments may have made<br />
in a Budgetary context.<br />
The previous Prime Minister, in his final message to the people<br />
of Australia while in that Office, claimed that his Government<br />
had left Australia " in a condition that is equal to, or better<br />
than, any other Western country".<br />
Nothing could be further from the truth.<br />
The Fraser Government's legacy to the Australian people is<br />
an economic shambles.<br />
Compare Mr Fraser's boast to the assessment given to me by<br />
the Treasury on March 6:<br />
" The magnitude of the fiscal imbalance is unprecedented<br />
in Australia during peace time, as is the level of<br />
Government spending. The budget balance is projected<br />
to deteriorate from near zero to more than 6 per cent<br />
of GDP in a two year period. The speed and magnitude<br />
of that deterioration is almost without precedent among<br />
the major OECD countries in the post-war period".<br />
If Mr Fraser and his colleagues are proud of that assessment,<br />
we can only be grateful they didn't leave the country in a<br />
condition about which they would be ashamed.<br />
The figures in the attached document also serve to demolish<br />
the remnants of Mr Howard's credibility. </p>

of Australia now knwhow much they can trust the DO-puty Leacder<br />
of the Liberal. Part-,.~<br />
It is , worth recalling, as well, the justification 1.1r Howard<br />
used for arriving at the $ 6 billion figure. After he hada been<br />
caught out, he told a pre~ cs: conferenice onl March 8:<br />
' Somebody ho has been Treasu-rer fcr five years<br />
is entitled in the course of a pross conference to<br />
give soime, ordier of-imag-nitude based upon one ' s ow.. n<br />

The obvious question is: could he really have been * so iqriora'nt<br />
about what his Government's policies we,, re: doing to the Austra -1L all<br />
economy that he could be $ 3 billion out in his estimate?<br />
Mr liow-ard has a choice of admissions he wsa totally incompetent<br />

MINUTE PAPER<br />
Prime Minister<br />
1983-84 BUDGET DEFICIT<br />
You asked me to give you a concine account of the details underlying the<br />
$ 9.6 billion estimate of the 1983-84 Budget deficit arising out of the<br />
policies of the previous Government. That figure was contained in the<br />
advance copy of our paper The Current Fiscal Situation and Outlook which<br />
I gave to you and Mr Keating on Sunday, 6 March last.<br />
2. As at Friday 4 March 1983, the 1983-84 Commonwealth Government<br />
Budget deficit was estimated at $ 9,562 million. Total outlays were<br />
estimated at $ 54,594 million and total receipts at $ 45,032 million.<br />
These figures took no account of policy proposals put forward'by eithethe<br />
outgoing Government or the Australian Labor Party in the course of<br />
the election campaign.<br />
3. The estimate of total outlays quoted above was provided to the<br />
Treasury by the Department of Finance late on Friday 4 March. A summrnry<br />
of those outlays with comparisona for 1982-83 is attached. Detail of<br />
the outlays estimate including the status of the figures underlying the<br />
aggregate and the method of data compilation by the Department oif Finance<br />
will be available in the Department of Finance's " Report on the Forward<br />
Estimates of Budget Outlays: 1983-84, 1984-85 and 1985-86" which you have<br />
indicated your intention of publishing.<br />
4. The receipts estimate was compiled by the Treasury, with inputs<br />
from relevant revenue collection authorities, notably the Australian<br />
Taxation Office.<br />
5. So far as the receipts side is concerned, what follows as to the<br />
basis of those figures will be self-explanatory. So far as the outlays<br />
side is concerned, you have enquired about the status of those figures<br />
and in particular whether they constitute merely " first bids" by<br />
Departments for 1983-84.<br />
6. The first thing I should say on that matter is that the Forward<br />
Estimates processes, which culminate in the production by the Department<br />
of Finance each year at about this time of the Report on the Forward<br />
Estimates of Budget Outlays for the following three years, are quite<br />
separate froi: the " first-bids" processes which typically get under way in<br />
Departments at about this time and which are keyed to submitting such<br />
" first bids" to the Department of Finance usually around the end of April.<br />
7. The Forward Estimates processes revolve around the provision by<br />
Departments, usually by aroun.! mid-January of each year, of those<br />
Departments' best estimates of the amounts considered necessary by<br />
Departments to maintain approved oigoing programmes and activities.<br />
While there is no doubt ways some element of " fat" in those figures<br />
C O N F DE N T I A L </p>
<p>also, they are formal ly.' u nre: I . ted to thi " first bid. s" processes for the<br />
imnediatelv foliowing year. I can only say that on tlin occasion as on<br />
ni l others, the Forward lEstim. iten document hajsi, so fur as T am aware,<br />
been compiled by thr D.-partment of Finance on a wholly traditionai oasis.<br />
8. The outlays and r-eceipts estimates were based on economic<br />
paramuterH generated by I hu. Treasury, and provided to the Department of<br />
Finance and reveniue co! Iection authorities in mid-February 1983. Two key<br />
parameters were averag, weekly earnings, then estimated to increase at an<br />
average annual rate of 6 1/ 2 per cent in 1983-84, and prices, then<br />
estimated to increase at an annual average rate of 6 per cent in the same<br />
year. 9. These parameters were revised upwards slightly ( by around / 2 a<br />
percentage point in each case) by the Treasury in early March. The<br />
receipts estimates were adjusted upwards by Treasury at the same time to<br />
reflect this parameter revision. Because, I understand, of the<br />
mechanical processes involved, no adjustment was made to the outlays<br />
estimate. In the short run ( eg a single financial year), an increase in<br />
wages and prices tends to increase Budget receipts by a greater amount<br />
than Budget outlays. Therefore, the use of slightly different parameters<br />
on the two sides of the budto in this instance meant that the estimated<br />
Budget deficit of $ 9.6 billion was somewhat understated.<br />
The attached table compares estimated 1983-84 Budget receipts with<br />
estimates of 1982-83 Budget receipts. Total 1983-84 Budget receipts were<br />
estimated at S45032 mil ion, 6l2 million or 1.4 per cent highier than the<br />
then estimated 1982-83 receipts outturn.<br />
The re: nainder of this note discusses individual Budget receipts<br />
est imate s.<br />
Customs duty<br />
Imports<br />
Collections of customs-duty on imports wer. estimated : o increase by $ 110<br />
million or 5.5 per cent in 1983-84. The estimate reflected a forecast<br />
increase of 6.8 pc-r c. nt in the value: of endogenous imports in 1983-84.<br />
Coal exports<br />
Receipts from duties _ n exports of coal were estimated at 63 million, 37<br />
million or 10 per cent lower than estimated receipts in 1982-83. Thne<br />
estimated dlecline was attributable the full y: ar effect of abolition<br />
of the $ 1 per tonne duty rate announced on 29 July 1982 and projected<br />
subdued demand for Australian coking coal.<br />
Excise duty<br />
Total collections of excise duty ( incluaing crude oil and LPG duties)<br />
were e, t imated at $ u278 million in 1983-84, a decline of 6.4 per cent on<br />
estinated 1982-83' J col ection'r. CONFIDENTIAL </p>

Crude oil 1458 2870 -588 -17.0<br />
LPG 50 55 -I -1.8<br />
Total receipts from crude oil and LPG duties were estimated to decline by<br />
$ 589 million or 16.8 pr cent The estitmate tor the crude oil levy was<br />
based on maintenance of an exchange rate of SA USO. 96 ( broadly the<br />
exchange rate prcvailing just prior to the election now overtaken, of<br />
course, by the 8 March 1983 devaluation) and assumed a fall in the price<br />
of Saudi marker crude oil put at that time at US4 per barrel from I April<br />
1983. Le production estimates underlying the revenue figure were based<br />
on . i projected 6 per cent reduct ion in excisblc production and a shift in<br />
the dietribution of production towards lower excine categories of<br />
product ion.<br />
Receipts from the duty on natural lv occurring LPG were estimated an about<br />
the same money level as in 1982-83. The estimated decline in production<br />
was offset by the full year effect of higher prices prevailing follawing<br />
the I January 1983 adjustment.<br />
Other encise duties<br />
The estimate for excise revenueq, oth. r than on crude oil and LPG, was<br />
$ 3353 million, 1163 miilion or 5.1 per cent higher than estimated for<br />
1982-83.<br />
The estimate reflected the full year gain to revenue from the increased<br />
rates of duty on beer, tobacco products, motor spirit and distillate<br />
announced in the 1982-83 Budget and the expansion of the taxable base<br />
following the removal of the excise exemption for distillate used<br />
off-road. It also reftected an additionai I cent per litre surcharge cn<br />
rates of duty for motor spirit and distillate from 1 July 1983 earmarked<br />
for expenditure under the Australian Bicantennial W) ad Development ( ABRD)<br />
Program. Further details are available if required.<br />
Sales tax<br />
Revenue from sales tax in 1983-84 was estimated at 13850 million, an<br />
increase of 10.8 per cent. Private consumption expenditure was estimated<br />
to increase by arotund 7 1/ 2 per cen! in 1983-84. The * sales tax estimate<br />
was adjusted to reflect the broadened tax base, effective from I January<br />
1983, and the full year effect ot the increased rates announced in the<br />
1982-33 Budget. Further details are available if required.<br />
I ncom,: tax ind ividui s<br />
It was estimated that collections of income tax from individuals would be<br />
virtually unchanged ( increase by 0.1 per cent) in 1983-84. In addition to<br />
gross PAYE col lections, this tot. al comprisel compomnents which are based<br />
mainly on taxable incomes in 1982-83 ( PAYE refunds and collections from<br />
othvr individuaIs). C 0 N F DE NT I AL </p>

PAYE ins tal ment deduct ions<br />
Gross PAYK reci pt wvre st i t d( to increase by 4.8 per cent in<br />
1983-84. The 1983-84 estimate was, aq noted earlier, based on an assumed<br />
increase of 7 pur cent in average weekly earnings and a decline of I per<br />
cent in wage and salary earner employmnent. The estimate reflected<br />
significant estimated full year costs to revenue of the rate scale changes<br />
and other PAYE tax concessions provided in the 1982-83 Budget. At the<br />
time the 1982-83 Budget was brougJht down, it was estimated that the full<br />
year revenue costs of these measures would be around $ 2850 million<br />
compared with a then stimaited cost of around $ 1670 mi. llion in 1982-83.<br />
Part of the concessions to eligible taxpayers were assumed to be reflected<br />
in PAYE refunds and tax paid by ' other individualsn' in the following year.<br />
PAYE refunds<br />
Retf. nds in 1983-84, which are in respect of tax assessed in 1983-84 on<br />
1982-83 incomes, were estimated to increase by 22.0 per cent. A large<br />
Selement in this i nc. rease derived from those perncnal incomne tax<br />
concessions announced in the 1982--83 Budget which taxpayers have chosen to<br />
take as refunds rather than as redLctions to PAYE instalments in 1982-83;<br />
notably with respect to home loan interest and the increase in dependnt<br />
spouse rebates.<br />
Other individuals<br />
Receipts, from other individuals were estimated to decrease by 12.4 per<br />
cent in 1983-84, compared with an, estimated increase of 11.6 per cent in<br />
1982-83. Part of the 1982-83 increase was, however, attributable to thie<br />
increased penalty rates for late payment, estimated to yield, on an<br />
essentially " one-off" basis, $ 42' mi l1i1o n in 1982-83. The provisional cax<br />
component of the estimate was based on the estimated taxable income of<br />
provisional taxpayers in 1982-83 increased by a loading of 10 per cent and<br />
applying the 1983-84 rates and dependent rebates. 1982-83 pre-budget and<br />
Budget measures in this area were estimated to cost revenue $ 202 million<br />
in 1983-84.<br />
''" Income tax companies<br />
Company tax collections were estimated Lo d: cline by 9.0 per cent in<br />
1983-34, reflecting a broadly comparable estimated decline in company<br />
assessable income in 1982-83 ( th base for tax collections in 1983-84).<br />
Special tax to recover evaded copanv and division 7 tax<br />
Because of delays in implementing the ' bottom of thie harbour' legislation<br />
relating to strips of untaxed company profits and unpaid Division 7 tax,<br />
the 1982-83 Budget estimate of million was revised downwards to $ 100<br />
mi llion. The bulk of the proceeds of the tax weru expected to be received<br />
in 1983-84.<br />

<p>ITax deductions from p. nventq for labor and services<br />
It was announced in the 1982-83 Budget that a tax deduction at source<br />
system would be applied from 1 July 1983 to payments for labour and<br />
services not subject to PAYEI deductions in industries where evasion of tax<br />
on such payments was known to be significant, with a yield thcn estimated<br />
at $ 500 million. The tax was not likely to be fully implemented in<br />
1983-84 and details of its application and exemptions remained to be<br />
settled. The net gain from the tax was now estimated at $ 300 million in<br />
1983-84, representing an estimate of the excess of deductions from cash<br />
payments over the self-assessment credit that would be allowed i. n respect<br />
of these payments against provisional tax.<br />
Non-tax revenues and other taxes, fees and fines ( net)<br />
Non-tax revenues ( interest, rent and dividends, net receipts from<br />
Government enterprine transactions and sale of existing assets) and other<br />
taxes, fees and fines ( net) were entimated by the Department of Finance at<br />
$ 4092 million, 7.2 per cent high-r than estimated 1982-83 collections.<br />
