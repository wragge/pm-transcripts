NOTHING PROVES MORE CLEARLY THE GREAT IMPORTANCE OF<br />
PRIMARY INDUSTRY TO AUSTRALIA THAN AN EVENT OF THE KIND<br />
BEING STAGED HIF. RE TODAY, To SEE THE DISPLAYS OF FARM<br />
EQUIPMENT, THE DEMONSTRATION OF NEW TECHNIQUES AND THE<br />
EXHIBITIONS OF STOCK IS TO CONFIRM THE VITALITY,<br />
SOPHISTICATION AND DURABILITY OF FARMING IN AUSTRALIA,<br />
NO GOVERNMENT CAN FAIL TO BE IMPRESSED BY THIS VITAL ASPECT<br />
OF OUR NATIONAL LIFE. CERTAINLY THE PRESENT GOVERNMENT<br />
RECOGNISES THAT WITHOUT THE RURAL ACTIVITIES WHICH ARE SO<br />
VIVIDLY ON SHOW TODAY AUSTRALIA COULD NOT HOPE TO CONTINUE<br />
AS A PROSPEROUS AND GROWING NATION.<br />
I AM GLAD TO HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO AFFIRM THE<br />
GOVERNMENT'S GREAT CONCERN FOR THE CONTINUED WELL-BEING<br />
OF PRIMARY INDUSTRY, BECAUSE SO MUCH OF THE DEBATE SURROUNDING<br />
THE LAST FEDERAL ELECTIONS INVOLVED ISSUES AFFECTING OUR CITIES,<br />
THERE HAS BEEN A TENDENCY IN SOME QUARTERS TO BELIEVE THAT THE<br />
GOVERNMENT ATTACHES A DIMINISHED IMPORTANCE TO OUR RURAL AREAS.<br />
I WANT TO SAY QUITE UNEQUIVOCALLY THAT ANY SUCH BELIEF IS<br />
UNFOUNDED. THE PRESENT GOVERNMENT IS AS DEDICATED AS ANY<br />
PREVIOUS GOVERNMENT TO THE CREATION AND MAINTENANCE OF SELFSUFFICIENT,<br />
PROSPEROUS AND EFFICIENT PRIMARY INDUSTRIES,<br />
INDEED, I BELIEVE THATI WE HAVE GIVEN A NEW AND HEALTHY EMPHASIS<br />
TO THCESE INDUSTRIES, </p>
<p>11o 600RwNME'T HAS DOME SO MIUCH 10 REDJUCE THE DUJPDEN WHIJCH<br />
RURAL1 INDUSTRIES HAVL HAD TO CARRY AS A RESULT OF EXCES; SIVE<br />
TAR IFF PROTECTI1ON, No Gov0RHIMET HAS DONE SO MU~ LCH TO IN'SUPcL<br />
THAT MOST PUBLIC ASSISTANCE GOES TO THOSE FAR~ M FAMILIES WHiO NFLD<br />
IT MOST. No GOVERNMENT HAS DONE SO MUCH TO OPEN UP NFAW AND<br />
EXPANDING OVERSEAS MARKETS,<br />
DESPITE WHAT WE HAVE DONE, THERE IS STILL MISUNDERSTANDING,<br />
AND CRITICISM OF THE THRUST OF OUR RURAL POLICIES IN SOME<br />
QUARTERS, OUR CRITICS HAVE SEIZED UPON THE ABOLITION OR<br />
REDUCTION OF SOME SUBSIDIES IN AN ATTEMPT TO ARGUE THAT THE<br />
GOVERNMENT IS ANTI-RURAL. THEY HA\' E NOT BOTHERED TO CONSIDER<br />
WHETHER THESE SUBSIDIES ARE APPROPRIATE FOR OUR ECONOMY OR<br />
HELPFUL TO OUR FARMERS. THEY HAVE NOT STOPPED TO CONSIDER<br />
WHETHER THESE SUBSIDIES HELP ALL FARMERS OR WHETHER THEY<br />
OVERWHELMINGLY FAVOUR THE LARGEST AND WEALTHIEST PRODUCERS<br />
ANDj IN SO DOING, DEPRIVE. THE GOVERNMENT OF MONE Y WHICH<br />
MIGHT BE BETTER DIRECTED TO AID FAMILY . li THEY HAVE NOT<br />
STOPPED TO CONSIDER WHETHER THESE SUBSIDIES HAVE STOOD IN<br />
THE WAY OF ADJUSTMENT PROGRAMS WHICH PROMISE GREATER<br />
LONG-TERM ASSISTANCE TO FARMERS. THEY HAVE NOT STOPPED TO<br />
CONSIDER WHAT WERE THE MOTIVES BEHIND THEIR INTRODUCTION,<br />
ANY ANALYSIS OF OUR PRIMARY INDUSTRY POLICY WILL SHOW THAT<br />
WE ARE STRIVING TO SEE THAT OUR RURAL AREAS ARE NOT CYNICALLY<br />
EXPLOITED BY PORK-BARREL POLITICS. WE WANT TO ENSURE THAT<br />
THEY ARE GIVEN A FIRM ECONOMIC BASIS SO THAT COUNTRY PEOPLE<br />
CAN BE SURE OF SHARING THE SECURITY AND WEALTH OF OUR NATION. </p>
<p>TO ACHIEVE OUR AIIIS WE ARE STRIVING TO IMPROVE THE<br />
DOMESTIC HARKETS FOR PRIMARY PRODUCERS, TO CONSOLIDATE<br />
EXIST] HG EXPORT M1ARKETS AND TO CREATE NEW MARKETS. AS<br />
I HAVE ALFREADY INDICATED. I } 3ELIEVE WE HAVE HAD A GREAT<br />
DEAL OF SUCCESS IN THESE IERMS IN THE LAST YEAR, WE HAVE,<br />
FOR EXANPLE, NEGOTIATED WHEAT AND SUGAR CONTRACTS WITH<br />
CHINA AND RURAL INDUSTRY WILL BENEFIT FROM THE CLOSER TRADE<br />
TIES WE HAVE ESTABLISHED WITH JAPAN.<br />
WHATEVER OUR CRITICS MIGHT SAY, THE FACT REMAINS<br />
THAT THERE HAS BEEN A GREAT IMPROVEMENT IN FARM INCOME<br />
IN THE LAST YEAR.<br />
IN THE THREE YEARS ENDED 1969/ 70 FARM INCOME AVERAGED<br />
ABOUT $ 1,050 MILLION A YEAR. THE ONSET OF DROUGHT AND<br />
DECLINING PRICES CAUSED FARM INCOME TO DROP TO $ 885 MILLION<br />
IN 1970/ 71 AND MANY PRODUCERS FACED SERIOUS FINANCIAL<br />
DIFFICULTIES,. LAST YEAR SAW A COMPLETE REVERSAL OF THIS<br />
SITUATION AND, UNTIL RECENTLY, THE ESTIMATE FOR FARM INCOME<br />
IN 1973/ 74 WAS $ 2,885 MILLION MORE THAN THREE TIMES AS<br />
GREAT AS IN 19/ 0/ 71 AND WELL OVER DOUBLE THE AVERAGE INCOME<br />
FOR THE THREE YEARS BEFORE THEN. </p>
<p>THE SAME SORT OF PATTERN EMERGED L-AST YEAR IN TrHE<br />
FIGURES FOR EXPOR~ TS OF RURAL ORIGIN. HS EXPORTS EARNED<br />
AUSTRLIA. $ 2,1419 M1ILLION Im 1971/ 72. THE MOST RECENT<br />
ESTIMATE FOR 197-/ 7/ 4 PREDICTED THAT THEY WOULD BE WORTH<br />
$ 3,874-MILLION A VERY GREAT IMPROVEMENT.<br />
THE DEVASTATING FLOODS WHICH HAVE SW4EPT QUEENSLAND<br />
AND NORTHERN NEW SOUTH WALES IN RECENT WEEKS WI1LL INEVITABLY<br />
FORCE A REVISION OF THESE ESTIMATES. THEY WILL ALSO MEAN<br />
THAT MANY FARMERS WILL NOT SHARE THE CURRENT BUOYANCY OF<br />
PRICES FOR RURAL COMMODITIES. NEVERTHELESS, IT REMAINS TRUE<br />
THAT THE MARKET OUTLOOK FOR AUSTRALIAN PRIMARY INDUSTRY IS<br />
EXTREMELY FAVOURABLE AND THAT A GOVERNMENT POLICY AIMED AT<br />
MAINTAINING AND IMPROVING THIS BUOYANCY IS SOUNDLY BASED.<br />
I WOULD BE MUCH TOO SANGUINE IF I TRIED TO PRETEND<br />
THAT SOME UNCERTAINTIES DID NOT FACE PRIMARY PRODUCERS.<br />
THE FLOODS AND CYCLONES IN THE NORTH INDICATE YET AGAIN<br />
THE UNPREDICTABILITY OF A FARMER'IS LIFE. SOME UNPREDICTABILITY<br />
MUST ALSO RESULT FROM THE CURRENT OIL PROBLEM, ESPECIALLY AS<br />
IT RELATES TO BUNKERING FUEL. THE GOVERNMENT IS DOING ALL<br />
THAT IT CAN TO DEAL WITH THE PROBLEMS CREATED BY THESE NEW<br />
AND SUDDEN FACTORS IN THE RURAL OUTLOOK. IN THE CASE OF THE<br />
QUEENSLAND AND NEW SOUTH WALES FLOODS, IT IS PROVIDING ALL<br />
POSSIBLE ASSISTANCE TO HELP OVERCOME THE DAMAGE CAUSED. IN THE<br />
CASE OF THE INTERNATIONAL OIL CRISIS, WE ARE BACKING UP OUR OWN<br />
NATURAL WEALTH WITH GOVERNMENT POLICIES AIMED AT PROTECTING AND<br />
ADVANCING OUR NATIONAL INTERESTS. </p>
<p>A MAJOR FACTOR IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GOVERNMENT'S<br />
RURAL. POLICY HAS BEEN THE ROLE PLAYED BY TIHE MINISTER FOR<br />
PRIMARY INDUSTRY, SENATOR KEN WIRIEDT. FARMERS COULD NOT<br />
HOPE TO HAVE A MORE PERSUASIVE AD\ VOCATE IN THE CABINET.<br />
HE HAS INTRODUCED A RAT* IONAL COMMITMENT TO0 THE NEEDS OF PIRIMIARY<br />
PRODUCERS AND THIS COMMITMENT NOWI PERVADES ALL AREAS OF OUR<br />
RURAL POLICY. A RECENT OPINION POLL AMONG PRIMARY PRODUCERS<br />
SHOWED THAT THEY APPRECIATED SENATOR WRIEDT' S WORK; MORE<br />
THAN 70 PER CENT OF THEM APPROVED HIS HANDLING OF HIS<br />
PORTFOLIO. ONE OF THE MAJOR ACTIVITIES THAT HE HA* S SET IN MOTION<br />
IS THE HOLDING OF AN INQUIRY INTO ALL ASPECTS OF RURAL POLICY<br />
IN AUSTRALIA. THE INQUIRY WILL RESULT IN THE FIRST<br />
GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED REPORT ON OVERALL RURAL POLICY SINCE<br />
THE PUBLICATION OF " AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION: AIMS AND POLICIES"<br />
BY -THE FORMER DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE AND AGRICULTURE IN 1952,<br />
MORE THAN 20 YEARS AGO. To CONDUCT THE INQUIRY THE GOVERNMENT<br />
HAS SET UP A RURAL POLICY WORKING GROUP, HEADED By DR. STUART<br />
HARRIS, DEPUTY SECRETARY OF THE DEPARTMENT O F OVERSEAS TRADE.<br />
SENATOR WRIEDT HAS ALSO TAKEN STEPS TO ENSURE THAT THE WORKING<br />
GROUP HAS READY AND FULL ACCESS TO THE VIEWS OF FARMERS.<br />
HE HAS AGREED TO THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A COMMITTEE OF FARMERS<br />
TO ADVISE AND CO-OPERATE WITH THE GROUP. </p>
<p>-6-<br />
A HiAJOR BASIS FOR THE INQUIRY IS THE GOVERNMNENT' S<br />
\' IEll THAT THERE IS NO0 PLACE IN THE ECONOMY FOR A RURAL<br />
POLICY THAT IS NOT BOTH EQUITABLE FOR PRIM~ ARY( PRODUCERS<br />
AND ECONOMICALLY SOUND. 1IN ANNOU1NCING THE INQUIRY, THE<br />
MINISTER FOR PRIMARY INDUSTRY, SENATOR KEN 14RIEDT, AND<br />
I SAID THE GOVERNMENT WISHES TO AVOID AD HOC DECISIONS<br />
THAT MIGHT APPEAR TO SOME TO BE POLITICALLY ATTRACTIVE<br />
AT THE TIME, BUT WHICH IN FACT MIGHT OFFER NO LONG TERM<br />
SECURITY OR REAL BENEFITS TO THE GENUINE PRIMARY PRODUCER.<br />
THE GOVERNMENT NEEDED A BASIS OF EXPERT ADVICE ON WHICH<br />
TO FORMULATE ECONOMICALLY SOUND AND SOCIALLY EQUITABLE<br />
MEASURES THAT WOULD HELP THE RESIDENT FARM FAMILY.<br />
IT ALSO SAW A NEED FOR A RURAL POLICY THAT RECOGNISED<br />
THAT LARGE AND IMPORTANT SECTIONS OF THE RURAL COMMUNITY<br />
ARE NOT THEMSELVES ENGAGED IN FARMING ALTHOUGH THE<br />
PROSPERITY OF MANY DID DEPEND ON THE HEALTH OF THE PRIMARY<br />
INDUSTRIES. </p>
<p>-7-<br />
THE WORKING GROUP WILL DRAFT, FOR CONSIDERATION BY<br />
THE Govii-Mrl NFr, A " GREEN PAPER" ON RURAL POLICY, INCORPORATING<br />
ASPECTS FROM PRESENT AUSTRALIANI GOVERNMENT POLICIES SUCH AS<br />
SELECTIVE DECENTRALISATION, CONSERVATION, RURAL. RECONSTRUCTION<br />
AND LONG-TERM INTERNATI ONAL COMMODITY AGREEMENTS. IT WILL<br />
ALSO ATTEMPT TO INTEGRATE THESE AND OTHER FACTORS INTO A SET<br />
OF PRINCIPLES UPON WHICH FUTURE POLICIES COULD BE BUILT.<br />
WE EXPECT TO PUBLISH THE GREEN PAPER BY GOVERNMENT AUTHORITY<br />
BUT WITHOUT FORMAL ENDORSEMENT, IN THAT FORM, IT WOULD BE<br />
DEBATED IN CABINET, IN PARLIAMENT, AND IN THE COMMUNITY<br />
GENERALLY PARTICULARLY IN THE RURAL SECTOR. THESE DEBATES<br />
WILL ASSIST THE GOVERNMENT T' 0 CREATE A MORE VIABLE RURAL<br />
SECTOR IN THE AUSTRALIAN ECONOMY, WE HOPE TO RECEIVE THE<br />
WORKING GROUP'S REPORT BY APRIL,<br />
IN ADDITION TO THE EVOLUTION OF NEW POLICIES TO ENSURE<br />
THE. PROSPERITY OF PRIMARY INDUSTRY, THE GOVERNMENT HAS MOVED<br />
TO CREATE OTHER OPPORTUNITIES FOR OUR RURAL AREAS. THE PRESENT<br />
GOVERNMENT IS THE FIRST TO TAKE POSITIVE AND DECISIVE ACTION<br />
TO PROMOTE DECENTRALISATION IN AUSTRALIA. PLANNING FOR THE<br />
CREATION OF A NEW GROWTH CENTRE AT ALBURY-WODONGA IS ALREADY<br />
WELL ADVANCED AND WE AIM TO MAKE THIS THE PROTOTYPE FOR OTHER<br />
GROWTH CENTRES, DECENTRALISATION HAS LONG BEEN TALKED ABOUT<br />
IN THIS COUNTRY. THE LAST YEAR HAS SEEN THE BEGINNING OF THE<br />
FIRST REALLY CONCRETE PROPOSALS TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. </p>
<p>-8-<br />
I BELIEVE THAT BY THE APPLICATION OF SENSIBLE<br />
POLICIES ON PRIMARY INDUSTRY AND DECENTRAL.. ISATION WE CAN<br />
ENSURE THAT PEOPLE IN OUR RURAL AREAS SHARE THE BENEFITS<br />
OF THE UNDOUBTEDLY GREAT ! EALTH OF AUSTRALIA, PEOPLE IN<br />
THESE AREAS HAVE CONTRIBUTED AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT TO THAT<br />
WEALTH IN THE PAST AND I AM SURE THAT THEIR CONTRIBUTION<br />
WILL REMAIN FUNDAMENTALLY IMPORTANT IN THE FUTURE. </p>
