PRESS STATEINENT NO. 574<br />
14 October 1975<br />
MR CONNOR<br />
Today I advised the Governor-General to accept<br />
the resignation of Rex Connor as Minister for Minerals<br />
and Energy. I took this course in order to uphold a precise<br />
and fundamental principle of parliamentary government.<br />
The principle is that the Parliament must be able to<br />
accept assurances given to it by a minister, and if<br />
those assurances prove to be misleading, the minister.<br />
concerned must be held responsible.<br />
Last Thursday, in answer to a question from the<br />
Deputy Leader of the Opposition, I gave a written reply:<br />
" I am assured by the Minister for Minerals and Energy<br />
that all coiminications of substance between him and<br />
Mr Khemlani were tabled by him on 9 July 1.975."<br />
Yesterday I received from solicitors in Melbourne<br />
a copy of a statutory declaration signed by Mr Khemlani<br />
and copies of a number of telex messages between Mr Khemlani's<br />
office in London and the office of the Minister for Minerals<br />
and Energy. In my judgment these messages did constitute<br />
" communications of substance" between the Minister and<br />
Mr Kheiulani. I was therefore driven to conclude that I had been<br />
misled by Mr Connor and that, in consequence, my own<br />
answer to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition had been<br />
misleading. It was in these circumstances that I advised<br />
the Governor-General to accept M4r Connor' s resignation.<br />
I have made it clear throughout the life of this<br />
Government that there is one standard which, if departed<br />
from, must carry the heaviest penalty. It is a principle<br />
on which the integrity of Parliament itself depends.<br />
There was, I believe, a departure from that principle. </p>
<p>I want to make the clearest possible distinction<br />
between the conduct of Rex Connor in his capacity as<br />
Minister, the manner in which he fulfilled his duties,<br />
including all his involvement in overseas loan raisings<br />
and this one precise principle. It is not the contents<br />
of those telex messages . which constitutes-any . breach<br />
of'propriety. It . was his failureto tell me about them.<br />
It is because that failure led to a-breach of parliamentary<br />
standards last week that I accepted the resignation of<br />
! the Minister. At no time has there been any allegation of<br />
improper conduct, of dishonest conduct, of reprehensible<br />
conduct,-of illegal or corrupt conduct by any member<br />
of the Government. No such allegation or charges were<br />
made at the special sitting to discuss this matter on<br />
-9 July. ' No such charges were made in the Senate for all<br />
the Senate's abuse of Parliamentary privilege.<br />
No such charges are made now. My own painful duty in this<br />
matter has been twice to defend and preserve a great<br />
and fundamental-parliamentary convention. It is<br />
because of my insistence on preserving . such standards and<br />
conventions that a great minister . and a close . friend<br />
and colleague has fallen.<br />
