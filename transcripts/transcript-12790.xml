    <content><![CDATA[<p>
As Chairman in Office of the Commonwealth, I have decided to convene a special meeting in London on Tuesday 19 March of the three leaders mandated by CHOGM to consider and act upon the report of the Commonwealth Observer Group monitoring Zimbabwe';s recent election.<br />
This decision has been taken following consultations involving Secretary General Don McKinnon, and my two fellow Commonwealth leaders - President Mbeki of South Africa and President Obasanjo of Nigeria.<br />
The Commonwealth Observer Group has released a preliminary report, and I expect shortly to receive the Group';s full report, which will be the basis for our deliberations in London.  Circumstances clearly require our close, urgent and objective attention to the issues raised.</p>
