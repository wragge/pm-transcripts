    <content><![CDATA[<p>Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull will make his first official visit China from 14 to 15 April.</p>
<p>In Shanghai on 14 April the Prime Minister will attend the culmination of Australia Week in China (AWIC) with more than a thousand business representatives. This will be the largest Australian business delegation to leave Australia’s shores.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister will then travel to Beijing for an official meeting with President Xi Jinping and the annual leaders’ meeting with Premier Li Keqiang. Leaders will discuss the Australia-China relationship along with regional and global issues, under the Comprehensive Strategic Partnership established in November, 2014.</p>
<p>Last year Australia’s trade with China was valued at $150 billion.</p>
<p>2015 also saw record investment, education links and tourism - with more than one million Chinese visitors travelling to Australia.</p>
<p>Australian businesses are now reaping benefits from the China-Australia Free Trade Agreement, which came into force on 20 December last year.</p>
<p>China’s economic progress over the last forty years has been unprecedented in both its scale and pace. Australian exporters have been a partner with China in that extraordinary economic transformation.</p>
<p>The ChAFTA has opened up even more opportunities for trade and engagement between our two countries. As China continues its transition towards a more consumer-led and services-based economy, more and more Australian businesses are finding new markets and new opportunities in China.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister will explore ways to deepen Australia’s engagement with China especially in the areas of innovation, science and technology.</p>
<p>China’s, and our region’s, economic transformation offers extraordinary opportunities for both our countries and the Prime Minister looks forward to expanding them in the course of his visit. </p>
