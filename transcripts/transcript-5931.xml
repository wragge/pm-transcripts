PRIME MINISTER<br />

LlURPRAI3 PARTY BREFAKFAST,__ BRISBANE<br />
The Commonwealth Garmes have been a great achievement for<br />
Brisbane, for Australia, They have been a window on the<br />
whole coulltry, They have aroused a sert e of nat~. onal pride<br />
not just in Brisbane, andi not just in Queenrsl~ and where they<br />
are being held, but right across the country, They have<br />
demonstrated very much the kind of country Australia is.<br />
The performances by different national groups at the opening<br />
of the Games said something very real about Australia because<br />
overwhelmingly, those different grouips tha-t partic. pate3<br />
hsa. e come to Allstralia because they wanted tLo be free, and<br />
that said something not only to all Australians, it said<br />
riomething to all our visitors, all 6ur guests from overseas.<br />
We noed to remeanber somnetimes thatourowi political philosophy<br />
is based on freedom, freedom of the individual, not on a<br />
great mass of people or something which might help en masse,<br />
but on something which helps individuals, their familiea,<br />
lead the kind of lives they want for themselves, for their<br />
children. Our philosophy is based on establishing a secure<br />
society and a caring society, but always based on the wants,<br />
Q tihne C naenobeedrsroaf, individuals as they judge -it, not as it is judged<br />
I weuld.; 1ike to thank Kevin Cairns who 1, am delighted to see<br />
here. Kevin represented L-i~. ey for a very long while.-. He dia<br />
that ver: y well, and very effectively, but was caught up by<br />
-a narrow sing. Thlat was a very significf~ nt, loss to the<br />
Government and the Liberal Party. Xevin, thank you for<br />
coming here this morning, I know you have maintaired your<br />
interest in the Party,<br />
This -yea s. Budgat &amp; s -introduced against a quite different<br />
background to the~ last three or four because, as a result of<br />
W~ orld recession, the prices we are getting for ex~ port<br />
commodities are down 30% or 40%, and in some cases, it is<br />
dow-n more, and if the. prices are. not dow-ni, the quantities<br />
are down. / 2<br />

<p>LIB BREAK.-2 108<br />
That obviously has an impact in Australia, Secause -of. thle w6ild<br />
recession you are not getting the sort of business inve'stment<br />
decisions that have been. occurringc over the last four or five<br />
years. It was not, therefore, a q~ uestion -in this Budget: of<br />
the~ bvernment drawing back to make room for the privat6 szectr,<br />
but mnayba the Covernmen: doing some things that would assist<br />
in a difficult period against the background In which private<br />
investment by the end of this year will be runninig at a lesser<br />
rate than it Was at the beginning of the year, even though over<br />
the whole year it will still be maintained at a high level.<br />
Until there is a world upturn it is unlikely that the significant<br />
and major business investment decisions that we have seen Over<br />
the last four or five years are going to be repeated.<br />
Against that background we bought down a Budget which haa<br />
significant support for industry and major advances in depreciation<br />
provisions, depreciation for incoome producing buildings for<br />
the first time, It was a Budget designed to help people,<br />
a Budget designed to help families. The tax cuts are ' Significant,<br />
down fri-7. 32 * to 3O', There, is a housing rebate for~ all people<br />
buying their major tomelthe 1home where they live) not for a<br />
holiday home, but the major place of residente and significant<br />
i-ncreases in family allowances and other measures designed<br />
to help families in particular.<br />
Prom 1 November a family on $ 300 a week, a single income family<br />
with a dependent .9pouse . and two % ids, will be about $ 18 better<br />
off as a result of the Budget. If you had to be as<br />
well . off as a result of wage chances, you would need a<br />
wage increase of $ 25 to $ 30. That $ 25 to $ 30 in today's<br />
economic conditions could be enough-to send a firm*<br />
bankrupt ' andl then there would be no job and no business.<br />
That is why wh ile John Hawaxd said it wa s a fa-m i ly Budget and 4Mf a VVezy<br />
real way it was, biA it is also a Budget that should enable<br />
Australians to work together and establishes the basis in which<br />
it is reasonable to expect wage restr~ aint. We have had a<br />
good deal of success in that, I think there was a surprise<br />
when the Remuneration . Tribunal for politicians came out with<br />
a 7% adjustment instead of the 13% or 14% that a lot of<br />
people had been expecting. That was followed by an Academic<br />
Salaries Tribunal of the same kind of judgment,. Most of<br />
the State public services have co-me out with j udgmentsj Of<br />
to That of course is very much less than the rate-6f<br />
inflation. It is a significant advance in terms of the<br />
acceptance of the level of wage restraint throughout this<br />
community that we have not seen for some time, Of course<br />
that is all the more necessary ' a a result-of the wage<br />
breakthroughs last * year and the shorter hours which on<br />
top of the world recession did a great deal of damage to<br />
Australia. The increase in wages and shorter hours, increas. 6<br />
in wages of 15S to 20% at a time when our competitors overseas<br />
were achieving adjustments of 5% or 6% or sometimes even less,<br />
was one which obviously did a great deal of damage to Australian<br />
industry and a great deal of damage to Australian competitiveness.<br />
Comting at a tirne of world recession this jwtst cximpmrded-the dif ficulties<br />
that were going to face us in any case.<br />

<p>LIB BRZAK( FAST -3 -7.10.82<br />
Since the Budget of course, we have all becowe aware of the severity<br />
of the drought across the four Eastern States and further<br />
significatit decisio. z have been made which will enable people to<br />
Stay On their farms and stay or, their properties until the seasons<br />
change. The drought has not hit Queensland yet-although-it is<br />
dry in many places--as badly as tlS and Victorial but it l6ok8<br />
like being the worst drought sirtioe the 1930s and Maybe the<br />
worst ever recorded across the Bastern part. of the. continent.<br />
The co-operation that we have had or they have had from us itn<br />
relation to Queensland and the Commonwealth is Very<br />
good indeed. I have got to say there is far less asympathy in<br />
NSW4 and Victoria for ppople out in rural industry. I have.<br />
been disturbed that the carry on loans which have been part<br />
of the four measures between the Commonwealth and Queensland.<br />
for small business hit by drought In this State, have<br />
notbeen3 accepted in NSWI and I don't think they have been<br />
accepted in Victoria. ThIeir policies at this point are shortsighted<br />
and are inadequate, but these are matters that have becen<br />
traditionally negotiated between the Commonwealth and the States<br />
and what we have really been do-ing is to press other States to<br />
adopt the kind of core measures that have been accepted as<br />
a general rule between Queen. lad. and the Coimmonwealth for<br />
qluite Some time.<br />
W'hile this last Budget provided additional help to businesses and<br />
to famillis, While it provided a reasonable increase in capital<br />
works, we nevertheless went as far as we thought we responsibly<br />
could. We would not have wanted Budget deficits larger<br />
than qhat were indicated in the Treasurer's speech. I think<br />
it is worh highlighting that with what Mr Hayden indicated<br />
in hiis Budget speech. He did not add up the figures, but it<br />
would have come out at a deficit of about $ 5 to 6' billion.<br />
1r H-awke -has spoken of deficits of up to $ 6h billion. it is<br />
worth noting that hr Cain in his first Budget in Victoria has<br />
done almost exactly what Mr Whitlam did when he had a chance<br />
to have a go. lie increased expenditure by 24%, hie increased<br />
taxation by 24% in his first Budget. It will be interesting<br />
to see whether Mr Cain can beat Whitlaxn's second Budget<br />
because in that Budget Mr Whitlan increased his expenditure<br />
by 46%. He did not bother doing much about tax~ ation then,<br />
he just went on printing money. The Labor Party does not<br />
learn and I thin'k the economic malaise and difficulties in<br />
N~ SW where the problems of the Wran. Government are now<br />
widely u1nderstood in NSW and the kind of Budget that Mi-Cain<br />
has introduced in Victoria should demonstrate very clearly<br />
Labor has Il* eaxrnt nothing about the kind of policies that<br />
Australia needs, or needed through the ' 70s and on into the<br />
1980S. There are some positive signs in recent days. I do not * want<br />
to make too Much of it because a very great deal is going to<br />
depend'upon what happens in the United States and what happens~<br />
in Europe. Whilt interest rates have started to fall there<br />
and also in Australia, and while industrial disputes in Australia<br />
are at a 13 to 14 year low, and that is certainly good news,<br />
while there is evidence of wage r~ estraint this year, we are<br />
going to need a lift in ex port. prices, a lift in the markets<br />
overseas befor-e we can' see a real resurgence of substantial<br />
growth in our national economy. </p>
<p>LIB BREAKFAST<br />
About 30% of our national income depends upon trade and if<br />
the world is seen as depressed, if industrial production is<br />
falling in major countries overseas, if they want less coal<br />
or less iron ore, or less minerals of other kinds, and if<br />
they are paying less for it, obviously that effects us.<br />
Any Commonwealth Government, any Australian Government that<br />
pretends that it can go on regardless of those world economic<br />
circumstances is only deceiving the people of Australia.<br />
So, what happens in the United States, what happens in Britain,<br />
in France, and in Germany is obviously of significant importance.-<br />
Whateverhas happened in those countries, I believed we have<br />
managed our affairs much better than they have. Unemployment<br />
as we know is too. high here, but it. is about half the level<br />
in Britain, about half the level of France. It is about 10% in<br />
the United States, very much higher than Australia. We halve<br />
had over the last three years more growth in this country than<br />
in any of those others and to that extent we have swum against<br />
0 the tide, but the longer the world recession went on, the more<br />
inevitable it was going to be that it would effect Australia.<br />
In relation to recent events, I have announced a Review of<br />
Commonwealth Administration because there had been breakdowns<br />
in the management, in a sense the ordinary services of government,<br />
in the Crown Solicitor's Office, in the meat inspection service<br />
and in other areas where management skills and structures are<br />
important. I hope very much that John reid and his Committee<br />
can come forward with some significant recommendations. It is<br />
not to be a detailed report like the Royal Commission into<br />
the Public Service, but . a report that hopefully will indicate<br />
some broad guidelines and broad directions which will make*<br />
sure that the Public Service ca. n be put into a position in which<br />
it-can meet and respond to the much greater challenges that-are<br />
in front of us at the present tirte -than might have been the<br />
case, 10, certainly 20 or 30 years ago.<br />
There has been a mild discussion going on about taxation, taxation<br />
evasion or avoidance, and I thought I had better say something<br />
about it. In the early part of the 1970s, I suppose the main<br />
evasion schemes were ones that involved individuals<br />
. and I think to a very significant extent they : have been knocked<br />
off and outlawed. There have been over 20 pieces of legislation<br />
and well over 50 schemes outlawed by legislation that John<br />
Howard has introduced. In addition to this, a new general<br />
anti-avoidance, anti-evasion provision was introduced into the<br />
legislation -and the Tax Office believes that is working very<br />
effectively. That new provision was needed because time after<br />
time after time the Taxation Office was losing its cases<br />
before the High Court as it had earlier been constituted.<br />
The High Court had an attitude to tax which certainly did not<br />
make it difficult for those who wanted to step arou d the<br />
system, and that is not a criticism of the High Court, it was<br />
their interpretation of the law as it is or as it was. But it<br />
did mean that sections in the Taxation Act that had worked<br />
effectively for a very large number of the years, came to<br />
be regarded very much as a dead letter. it is ironic that people<br />
4. 7.10.82 </p>
<p>LT3 BREAYFAST-5<br />
are now sayi-ng with a different structure of the High Court<br />
that those old settions that in a sense were damaged by<br />
earlier judgments could in fact be resurrected and would<br />
againi be effective. They have also been buttressed by other<br />
legislation, by the new Part 4A., which is precise and explicit<br />
in relation to the things which it seek&amp; to outlaw.' I ain<br />
told that it is much harder to get aro--und than, the earlier<br />
sections in the Act which of course still stay in the statute<br />
book. In relation to one par ticular scheme, we have taken in a<br />
6ome historic decisions. In relation to bottom of the harbour<br />
8chemes, which I will explain in a little more detailin a<br />
mioment, in 1980 we introduced criminal penalties and five years<br />
jail for anyone indulging in these practices, A8 a resultof<br />
that not too many people have tried since December of 1980<br />
though a great many people tried' before. They are the only<br />
schemea against which criminal pentalties have in fact been<br />
introduded and criminal -peaalties had to be introduced because<br />
the only way'-you. omUd-Voo'k off the d-svice w; 4. s throt~ h taxation leg islati. c.<br />
Then in ad~ dition to that we have introduced-legislation which<br />
is going to collect the tax that was due, remains due, but<br />
which needs some buttress to the law before it can in fact<br />
be collected. I amn not too sure that that is adequately<br />
understood. We are going to collect tax that was due, remains<br />
due, that has been evaded from the people who have benefited<br />
from the evasion.<br />
It is worth noting that ! there have been eiq-nificant cases<br />
in the United 1( ingdom where their highest courts of appeal andwhore<br />
their Lord Chancellor, who is the equivalent of our Chief<br />
Justice, has made it very plain that they heLieve that the strict<br />
observance of the lav? is not a stifficienlt telst of good<br />
citizenship and not a sufficient test as to whether an act should<br />
be condoned or allowed. Trhe~ y use3 the words to the*<br />
ef fect that those who iriadlqe in these practices are well aw~ are<br />
of-the rigour of the contest their*-words, -not mine &amp; nd th~ at<br />
they had no right to complain if their hands got burnt because<br />
governments uiltimately catch up with them.<br />
I know accountants in my own city, who if they had' any clients<br />
who wanted to pursue these particular practices, would have said<br />
to them, " Well all right, hut you hacl better put the money aside.,<br />
because the Government will catch up with this device. we recommend<br />
you do not do it, but if you persist in doing it the Government<br />
will catch tip with and they will insist on collecting ' the money."<br />
Of course if we do not, we betray all the average taxpayers<br />
throughout Australia. It is not the Government that has been<br />
cheated by these practices, it is other taxpayers who have to<br />
pay more as a con-sequence and that needs to be clearly undlerstood.<br />
: 1 do not know how many of you -understand what a bottor of the<br />
harbour scheme is, but it has a number of essential characteristics.<br />
A company was sold which had current year profitsj and sometimea<br />
thoise current year profits were quite substantial, and the<br />
company was put into a position in which it could not pay its<br />
tax. it was sold in a way the vendor shareholders, the original / 6<br />
5 </p>
<p>LIDI B1RBAIFAST<br />
ownerrs of the company, got an inflated pr2% e for the shares which<br />
resulted from the tax that should have been paid being translated<br />
into a capital gain. For example, and this is fairly near to<br />
one particular example of what happened or let's . Just say this<br />
is a hypothetical example, but it is-not drawn out of the air.<br />
It might have had $ 3 million in current year profits, a total<br />
cash stock value of $ 6 million, so current year profits compared<br />
to the total value of the company were ob1viously very high,<br />
$ 400,000 might have gone to the promoter and the rest, million,<br />
broken up between six or eight sharebolders and not oine cent<br />
in tax paid before or after the event.<br />
If you put those kina of figures in front of average,-decent<br />
Australians Iandj asyed then, o-you think that is f air, tdo you<br />
think that is reasonable, do you think they should be allowed<br />
to keep the mroney?. or do you think they should b-e required to<br />
pay the tax that the company should have paid which quite a<br />
number of people.-and I would rea1ly-believe all<br />
Al should kno~ w should have been paid? f* you have g6t' something<br />
that is worth $ 1000 and somebody comes along and says I can<br />
pay you $ 1300 for that, aren't yoQ going to wonder whether<br />
something is a bit odd? You might just say well it is your<br />
good fortune, but I. would have thought most people would ask<br />
some questions,<br />
I have known people who had companies that they had put into<br />
liquidation. This was, not liq-uidating companies, this was<br />
just sellimy them and stripping them of their assets. The<br />
term bottom of the harbour came about because it sometimes<br />
ended up that the people who bought themn were Painters and<br />
Dockers who I suppose had changed their identity, They went to<br />
another State this was the kind of service that Ltiion<br />
and the papers were meant to be thrown in the bottom of the'<br />
harbour.-That is how the analogy came and it is the only<br />
reference 1 think tolharbour', There was nobody from whom<br />
the Commonwealth could collect the tax that was and remains<br />
legally due.,<br />
The. only way we can collect the'tax is to collect it from those<br />
who benefited from the device and we think it is fair enough<br />
to do that. There is the principle of retrospectivity which<br />
none of us like, but wh-en people went too far with tax matters<br />
in the United Kingdom, both Conservative and Labour governments<br />
have on different occasions enacted retrospective legislation<br />
which as I have indicated, has been upheld in the highest<br />
courts-. of the United Kingdom. We believe people have gone<br />
siqnificalitly too far in relation to this particular device,<br />
It was patent '. that it was artificial, To some extent,<br />
people involved in it, not necessarily everyone, but people had<br />
to be acting illegally.. We . also owe it all average Australian<br />
taxpayers to collect the m., oney that was due.<br />
We need to understand very clearly-the origins of our own Party,<br />
why it was formed, the reasons it was formed., It was f ormed<br />
to give average Australians a fair go in a political system<br />
that had not * always given them a fair go. We are the only<br />
Party that can do that. our colleagues in coalition., represent<br />
rural interests more than the total national interest and so<br />
far as the Labor Party is concerned. with their organic links<br />
6 </p>
<p>LiB BRPEATKFAST-7<br />
with the union movement, they can never repreisent all Au. 1traliaris<br />
fairly or eqlually. So it was the Liberal Party that was formed<br />
to do this job aknd-it has by and large over the year6, done<br />
it very well indeed.<br />
We -need to kmnder stand c-that the Liberal Party is not and<br />
never was a Party which represents the interests of the wealthy,<br />
or the privileged. It is a Party which believes in governing<br />
in the interests of everyone, not on behalf of special groups.<br />
demanding special privileges, Any other basis would undermine<br />
the Australian sense of a fair go and equity which the Liberal<br />
Party stanids for. This philosophy is not new to Liberals/ it<br />
is basic to whatever we have ever stood for. we have always<br />
believed. in it. In 1945 Sir Robert Menziea. in the Party's<br />
provisional policy statement declared as Liberal watch wordst<br />
" A fair deal and a good opportunity for everybody, no privilege<br />
if by privilege we mean advantage." Xnd he went on, " To us,<br />
Australia is 7 million individuals, the progress of each of<br />
whom. is a priceless asset to Australia anxd the horiest<br />
contribution of each of whom is the essential foundation of<br />
all good community life." That declaration is as true today<br />
as it was 3' 7 yeara ago We -are determnined to govern fairly<br />
for all Australians because Australia is 1.5 million individuals<br />
all of whom want and deserv~ e a f air and equal go, and the<br />
Government is going to make sure that they get it.<br />
We in the Liberal Party above all must never lose sight of<br />
a basic necessity for the Liberal Party., a basic nect~ ssty<br />
for the Government, to govern fairi',' for all<br />
We never allow po.. ex, or mone-y or pri-vileqe. to influence our<br />
policies. It is justice, the right the fa4. r that determines'<br />
what the Liberal Party must do and what my Government will, and<br />
is doing.<br />
I can uniderstand opposition to ret-rospectivity as a principle<br />
and I think all members of the Federal Goverrnment wouad<br />
dialike retrospectivity as a principle and I certainly share<br />
0 that view. Blut because of the action of certain people,<br />
because of the action of the few who engageA in. bottom of the<br />
harbour operations, it iso'so easy for the defence of no retrospeCtiVi<br />
to be construed as a defence of tax evasion. Y'ou have got the<br />
principle of retxospectivity standing against -the principle<br />
of fairness., and the Government is determined that the principle<br />
of fairness must be given priority in this instance. Nobody<br />
should be expected to pay more ta; than they need to. Nobody<br />
should be expected to forego the reasonable use of legally<br />
allowable deductions, but there is a big difference between<br />
this and the pursuit of blatant and artificial schemes which<br />
result in contrived : ductioiis from tax, evasion from tax<br />
or breaking of laws. These practices can only result in the<br />
unreasonable or illegal adv. antage of the few at the expense of<br />
the vase majority of Australians, The practices are un-Australian.<br />
They betray the proper sense of -community. and they defy all<br />
the basic tenets of the Liberal Party and the principles for<br />
which the Government stancds.<br />
The, reason for our Party's3 existence is to stanzl for average<br />
Australians, to defend their interesta and that is why I<br />
eo strongly believe that the Liberal Party must diassociate<br />
itself from those practices, why it must stand for the basic<br />
7 </p>
<p>LIB BEAKF'ASTvalues which led to the foundation of the Liberal Party, why<br />
it must never be captured or allow itis. polipiep to be captoired<br />
or influenced by any'thing other than the interests of all<br />
Austrailians. The politics of greed and selfishness which<br />
are the politics**: of bottom of the harbour operations have<br />
no part in Liberal politics or Liberal philosophy<br />
have no part in the Party that I lead. Fairness an working<br />
together, these are principl~ es which are important to us<br />
and we need to un~ derstand that it is governing for all Australiana<br />
that is the important tning for the Liberal Party.<br />
If art'orie bielieves that they can stand on a<br />
platform and defend the kind of figures which I just read<br />
out which could be copied time after time again from company<br />
report after company report, time after time again, and then<br />
say that they are governing fairly for all Australians if they<br />
allow that to continue, or people to profit from the practices.<br />
they don't understand any part of what motivates the<br />
heart of average Australians, The Liberal Party needs to<br />
think of that and ask itself someti-mes where it wants to go,.<br />
This is one of the serious timss ina the history of the Liberal<br />
Party.. -* Ther: e is no doubt that the<br />
legislation that is in the Parliamet-t . will gset. passed,. 7hh-: e . has<br />
not been any doubt about that for weeks, I have been sayinlg<br />
there has been n~ o doubt and people should rea~ lly take that<br />
at face value because that is-ihat is going to happen. We<br />
need to understand* and we need to rsanernber why this party was<br />
fOurE&amp; -and reaffirm our faith an~ d commitment to those reasons<br />
and not get diverted by other causea and other interests.<br />
There is another thing I should say. This is the opening of*<br />
the Lil -ley caripaiqn. I don't know ho~ i ' axy rura~ rthis will1I6.3 ' to<br />
about the federal cxqpagh' ~ e u if I cold p. olit out the fallacy of<br />
some of the past rumtours I think 25 September was the<br />
favoured day and that was the day in. which Carlton was going<br />
to win the grand final and there was no way in which I could.<br />
possibly have an election on that day. it anyone kn643 Victoria<br />
you could not organise an election on grand final day'. The<br />
whole Liberal Party would be on strike, So, I am sure<br />
not too many of you believe what you read in the newspapers.<br />
One day there will -be an electioni, but I do not know when<br />
it is. Lvezyone else has been saying I do, but I do not,~<br />
One morning I will wake up and will know. </p>
