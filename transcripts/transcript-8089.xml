PRIME MINISTER<br />
PARTIAL TRANSCRIPT LOCAL MEDIA CONFERENCE, CENTREPOINT MOTEL,<br />
LISMORE -17 AUGUST 1990<br />
E OE -PROOF ONLY<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister are you satisfied that there are no<br />
Australians involved in the round-up that seems to have taken<br />
place in Kuwait overnight?<br />
PM: Just before I came into this press conference I rang my<br />
office and spoke to my International Relations Adviser on my<br />
staff and that was the best advice they had at that point.<br />
JOURNALIST: How would you classify those Australians in Kuwait<br />
now, I mean, their situation would now look fairly great,<br />
wouldn't it, in view of what's happened?<br />
PM: Quite obviously the position of any Westerners including<br />
Australians in Kuwait, in Iraq, is one which should generate<br />
concern. All I can say is, our diplomatic representatives and<br />
those who have been representing us in Kuwait where we don't<br />
have direct representation have been absolutely assiduous and<br />
persistent and consistent in the representation of the relevant<br />
authorities of our concerns and they will continue to be so.<br />
JOURNALIST: What's your view of what Saddam Hussein seems to<br />
have done with Britains and Americans?<br />
PM: It's despicable. Of course I suppose that if a man, a<br />
leader, will turn chemical weapons on his own people as this man<br />
has then you must have concern about how he will treat<br />
foreigners. But I hope and I trust that he, and those around<br />
him with any influence at all, will understand the fact that the<br />
rest of the world believes that there are standards of conduct<br />
in regard to innocent people that must be adhered to and if<br />
those standards are infringed then the world simply won't stand<br />
idly by if that happens.<br />
JOURNALIST: It seems daily that the crisis is worsening, is<br />
that your advice?<br />
PM: I think the right way to put it is this. There is<br />
certainly an increasing number of nations who are committing<br />
themselves to forces there to make it clear to Iraq that they<br />
are not prepared to accept the action that's been undertaken by<br />
Saddam Hussein. That increase in forces includes an increasing<br />
number of Arab states who are committing resources. Now this<br />
would lead one to the conclusion that if the leadership of Iraq<br />
were to be acting rationally, that they must come to the<br />
conclusion that their own best interest, apart from anyone n-</p>
<p>elses, would be served by a withdrawal from Kuwait. But as I<br />
have said before, one has to question where the rationality is,<br />
the motivation or the sole motivation. I still carry the hope,<br />
however, that the overwhelming response of the rest of the world<br />
becoming increasingly clear in terms of the availability of<br />
forces there, will lead Iraq to the conclusion that it should<br />
withdraw. I'll continue to see that as far as Australia is<br />
concerned that we act on all fronts diplomatically as well as<br />
the despatch of our naval forces to try and bring about a<br />
peaceful resolution.<br />
JOURNALIST: What does the Australian Government see as the<br />
status of those Australians left in that area, are we talking<br />
about them now as hostages given that they can't leave?<br />
PM: I think the terminology is a matter of secondary<br />
significance. There has been a reluctance to use the word and I<br />
can understand that but the reality is that they are at risk and<br />
I've never tried to disguise that fact.<br />
S JOURNALIST: Today on both the front page of The Financial<br />
Review and The Australian privatisation has reared its ugly head<br />
again. Qantas, it seems as though it is now in a position to be<br />
sold off with the left. How do you see that?<br />
PM: I see this as a matter to be dealt with within the Party<br />
and I have said from the beginning that's how it will be done.<br />
I haven't entered into any significant public debate about it.<br />
And as you know the processes are building up towards the<br />
special conference in the latter part of September and it will<br />
be resolved there.<br />
JOURNALIST: In principle do you think then that it would be a<br />
fair trade-off to have the assets of a hypothetical<br />
privatisation sale going to more social justice areas?<br />
PM: Let me put it this way. It relates to an answer I've<br />
already given. Government has not got unlimited resources but<br />
there are almost unlimited demands upon government. Now there<br />
is no doubt, for instance, that what is required for the benefit<br />
of all Australians, is a significantly improved national freight<br />
situation involving improved rail and interlink rail and road<br />
facilities and we were talking about roads before. Now that's<br />
going to cost a considerable amount of money and I've expressed<br />
the view, so I am not breaking new ground here, that to my mind<br />
it's infinitely more sensible to free public resources to create<br />
that better national freight structure with rail and road than<br />
to have those resources tied up in government running an<br />
airline. It's a perversion of priorities to continue this<br />
situation and say no we'll tie up resources in running an<br />
airline or airlines which would otherwise be available for doing<br />
these things which won't occur without government initiative.<br />
JOURNALIST: The Telecom debate was on the front page of The<br />
Financial Review again today and two Ministers seem to be having<br />
a debate in the paper again, are you going to be taking any<br />
action against those Ministers? </p>
<p>PM: It is not a question of taking action against Ministers.<br />
Before this emerged in the particular way you are talking about<br />
I had been having discussions with the two Ministers concerned<br />
and others, and I will continue to do that, but as I said in<br />
this area there is no point in making a secret of the fact that<br />
there are differences of emphasis. People favour one particular<br />
route of increased competition than another. Well that's<br />
healthy enough. I think it would be better if the debate<br />
weren't being conducted as publicly as it is but I have<br />
expressed the view that by the time the Party has to make a<br />
decision we will have a position of the Government which we'll<br />
be putting and which will be one which is calculated to achieve<br />
the best objectives for Australia. That is to get a more<br />
competitive situation but one within which you do have the<br />
protection of the existence of an efficient and viable public<br />
utility in this area. There will continue to be the fundamental<br />
division, not within my Party, we'll work out our position and<br />
when that's worked out there will continue to be a fundamental<br />
division between Labor and the conservatives. Because you see<br />
S the conservative position now has been made quite clear, Brown,<br />
their spokesman has said they'll sell Telecom, they'll get right<br />
out of the communications area. In my judgement that's a recipe<br />
for disaster. The public utility should have competition but if<br />
you take the public utility out then in my judgement the public<br />
will suffer.<br />
JOURNALIST: There'll be no carpeting of those Ministers who<br />
continue this debate?<br />
PM: I'll be talking with them when I get back. I wouldn't<br />
describe it as carpeting but we'll be having an amicable<br />
discussion. JOURNALIST: Can I just ask a non-Northern Rivers question?<br />
PM: Sure.<br />
JOURNALIST: Calling a silly old bugger a silly old bugger and<br />
O getting caught doing it is much more like a normal bloke than a<br />
statesman, do you want to go down as a normal bloke or a<br />
statesman? PM: Both. It is not a dichotomy.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke one other final thing. It's been asked<br />
around here and I put it to you if you were Prime Minister when<br />
the Indonesians entered Timor would you have sent a few frigates<br />
or Australian military forces to help out?<br />
PM: I wasn't Prime Minister then and I wasn't therefore in<br />
possession of all the facts. Hypothetical questions never get<br />
much shrift from me but the hypothetical question which has got<br />
absolutely zero chance of an answer is a retrospective<br />
hypothetical. ends </p>
