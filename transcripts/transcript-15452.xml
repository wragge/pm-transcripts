    <content><![CDATA[<p>I am delighted to announce today that the Australian Government will formally offer a further $10 million from the AusLink Strategic Regional Program towards the upgrading of the Peninsula Development Road from Lily Creek to Crocodile Gap.</p>
<p>This particular project is designed to seal around 30 kilometres of road between Lakeland and Laura, and gives a firm practical starting point for the future long-term upgrading of the Peninsula Development Road.</p>
<p>I wish to commend the Cook Shire Council, who have submitted an AusLink Strategic Regional application for these works. They will shortly be receiving their formal funding offer.</p>
<p>Our $10 million funding offer is sourced from the $250 million AusLink Strategic Regional road funding announced on Budget night and is aimed at boosting productivity in regional economies.</p>
<p>This funding will bring our commitment to the Peninsula Development Road up to $15 million, including the $5 million we have previously provided to the road.</p>
<p>I also note that the Queensland Government has previously indicated that they will contribute $10 million of their own to match Australian Government funding for these works.</p>
<p>Additionally, following massive damage to the Peninsula Development Road caused by cyclones last year, I announced that the Australian Government would initiate - in conjunction with the Queensland Government - a study of the feasibility and cost of upgrading the Peninsula Development Road.</p>
<p>While the time taken by Queensland to prepare the actual study document has taken much longer than the Australian Government would like, they have now finally provided us with a draft copy.</p>
<p>The finalised study will inform any future considerations of the Australian Government on future upgrading of the Peninsula Development Road.</p>
