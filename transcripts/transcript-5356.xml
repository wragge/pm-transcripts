FOR MEDIA MONDAY, 19 MAY, 1980<br />
HOBART TO BE HEADQUARTERS OF ANTARCTIC COMMISSION<br />
Hobart has been selected as the site for the permanent<br />
headquarters of the international Commission for the<br />
Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources. Hobart's<br />
nomination was agreed to in principle by delegates from fifteen<br />
nations meeting in Canberra yesterday at a Conference to<br />
finalise an international Convent-ion governing the conservation<br />
and management of marine living resources in the Antarctic region.<br />
Final details of the Convention have now been agreed and<br />
delegates aLre expected to meet for the last time tomorrow<br />
to give formal endorsement of its provisions, including<br />
H-obart's selection for the Commission headquarters.<br />
The decision by delegates follows strong support given to<br />
Hobart's nomination by the Commonwealth Government over a long<br />
period. This has involved extensive diplomatic contacts<br />
prior to the Conference, as well as direct discussi ons with<br />
-Conference delegates during their meeting in Canberra. In<br />
addition, the C ommonwealth Government had made a R. AAF ( VIP)<br />
aircraft available during the conference for a visit to<br />
Hobart by Delegation Heads to inspect facilities, and had<br />
jointly hosted functions for the delegates in co-operation<br />
with the Tasmanian Government.<br />
The success of the Commonwealth's approach on behalf of<br />
Hobart is a further development in the Government's continuing<br />
program to establish Tasmania as an internationally recognised<br />
centre of study and research in marine and Antarctic matters.<br />
Previous initiatives in this respect by the Commonwealth<br />
Government have included establishment of the Australian<br />
M'aritime College in Launceston, transfer to Hobart of the<br />
Antarctic Division of the Department of Science and the<br />
Environment, and most recently, the Government's decision to<br />
establish a Marine Science Centre in Hobart including the<br />
trangfer of the CSIRO division of Fisheries and Oceanography.<br />
By bringing together these research and related activities,<br />
Tasmania will become the hub of Australia's Antarctic endeavours,<br />
and an important centre for marine science and research for<br />
all Australia. / 2 </p>
<p>2<br />
Tasmania is going to play an increasingly important role<br />
in advancing Australia's knowledge of, and capacity to<br />
develop, the resources of the sea.<br />
Major facilities are being established here; facilities<br />
that will place Tasmania, and therefore, Australia, at the<br />
forefront of marine science and technology.<br />
This latest decision by delegates from countries including<br />
those with highly developed capacities for Antarctic research<br />
and commercial activity, is an important sign of<br />
international recognition for Australia's, and particularly<br />
Tasmania's standing in these fields, developed largely as<br />
a result of the Commonwealth's initiatives.<br />
The Commonwealth has agreed to join with the Tasmanian<br />
Government in sharing the cost of establishing the new<br />
headquarters, and will shortly be commencing discussions<br />
on these arrangements and on the most suitable location<br />
for the Commission.<br />
I pay tribute to the determined efforts<br />
of Federal Government Members and Senators from Tasmania,<br />
whose continuing interest in this matter over several years<br />
has played a large part in achieving this pleasing result.<br />
