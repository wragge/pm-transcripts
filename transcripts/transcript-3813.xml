PRIME MINISTER'S PRESS CONFERENCE<br />
KIRRIBILLI HOUSE, SYDNEY,<br />
JULY, 1975<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I want to speak to you about the announcement that<br />
-the Speaker of the House of Representatives made -this morning. You<br />
were told that he had notified all members that the House would sit<br />
at 2.30 next Wednesday afternoon. During the week many members of<br />
the Opposition and many of the media have made allegations about<br />
the Government in general and about individual Ministers ccncerning<br />
the propriety of their actions, in particular in respect to the<br />
inquiries that had been made about overseas loans. Now the proper<br />
place for such political issues to be determined is in the supreme<br />
political forum of the nation, the House of Representatives itself.<br />
There the Opposition can make charges against Ministers and can<br />
substantiate them, if it can. And the Australian people will there<br />
and thien have the opportunity to judge the facts and the mo-tives of<br />
any such allegation.<br />
I had earlier told your representatives that when Parliament next<br />
sat I would table the reports I have received from the Ministers, the<br />
Departmental Heads, the other officials concerning the letters to<br />
Mr George Harris about which Dr Cairns spoke on the last afternoon<br />
that the House sat. I shall, of course, now table those next<br />
Wednesday afternoon. I shall also table the letters to and from<br />
Dr Cairns about the subsequent letter or the letter which<br />
subsequently came to light, the letter of the 7th of March.*<br />
Also I will table Mr Connor' s letters to Mr Khemlani.* Now<br />
Mr Fraser, when the House meets, will be able, if he wishes, to<br />
make any of the charges which any of your media have made, or any<br />
of his colleagues, or that his Deputy have made against Ministers;<br />
they will also be able to make charges against any individuals.<br />
' 17ey will be able to make charges against individuals who are not in<br />
Parliament with complete safety, no legal consequences for them if<br />
they make any charges at all, including some of the extraordinary<br />
charges that have been made by these guttersnipe hirelings that<br />
some of your employers have engaged. They will be able, for<br />
instance, to explain, if there is an explanation for this story<br />
in this morning's " Age", that a London finance broker said that<br />
Isomeone in Australia had been prepared to pay up to $ 2 million to </p>
<p>-2<br />
acquire certain vital documents relating to efforts by Australian<br />
Ministers to raise multimillion US dollar loans"<br />
Now all this can be said in Parliament and it can be substantiated<br />
in any way that's available to.-the Opposition. The only thing<br />
is that the Opposition will have to state the facts as they know them<br />
or as they are prepared to authenticate or identify. There will be<br />
a great opportunity for Mr Fraser and his associates, in the good<br />
old Australian phrase, " to put up or to shut up". Now are there<br />
any questions that any of you would like to ask?<br />
QUESTION: Why, after so many refusals, have you now decided to table<br />
the letter from Connor to Kheinlani?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Because of the allegations which have been made by<br />
the various newspapers. In view of some of the statements and<br />
interpretations -that have been made and given, let the public see<br />
for themselves.<br />
QUESTION: It has been hinted that you and Mr Connor are involved<br />
just as much as Dr Cairns, would you care to comment?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Well would you identify the source of the hint?<br />
QUESTION: Well, in the press.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Yes, but there is press and press and there is<br />
radio station and radio station. Well, let me say, I have written<br />
no letters at all to anybody that has been named in Parliament or<br />
outside it. I notice that some of the papers mentioned on Friday<br />
morning, I think it was, that a gentleman was writing to me to<br />
claim $ 5 million commission on funds which he had been able to<br />
secure. I haven't seen any such letters; I've been informed that<br />
that gentleman for at least the last five years has been putting<br />
proposals to the Treasury and the Department of Trade the<br />
Department of Overseas Trade as it now is and that nobody has ever<br />
given a second thought to his proposals. I'm told that he is or has<br />
been a bankrupt and that there is some medical disturbance also.<br />
But this is the only thing that I have seen concerning me.<br />
QUESTION: What about Mr Connor sir? </p>
<p>-3<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Well, you will be able to judge this from the letters.<br />
The great difference between Mr Connor and Dr Cairns is that<br />
Mr Connor was authorised to pursue inquiries and took advice on<br />
any responses he had and was, in general, con-sulting with his<br />
colleagues. Dr Cairns was not authorised, did not consult.<br />
QUESTION: Have you met Mr Khemlani or had any verbal negotiations<br />
with him? Have any of your staff or your Permanent Head, Mr Menadue,<br />
negotiated with Mr Khemlani or any one else in such matters?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Now a couple of days ago when I was asked in writing<br />
by one of the Canberra Press Gallery a question which any of you.<br />
are entitled to put to me in writing along the lines which you have<br />
just put I was asked whether in effect I had ever met or spoken to<br />
Mr Khemlani. My written reply to your colleague was: that I had<br />
never met him, I had never communicated with him, I believe I had<br />
never seen him. I would believe that the same applied to the Head<br />
of my Department and every member of my staff. I have heard nothing<br />
to the contrary.<br />
QUESTION: Would you describe the Labor Government's loan raising<br />
activities as extraordinary?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Unprecedented in degree, that is all. There is<br />
nothing illegal whatever. It is significant that nobody has suggested<br />
that there was anything illegal or that there was anything so extraordinary<br />
as to be improper in the fact that the Government authorised<br />
one Minister to pursue inquiries in response to approaches that had<br />
been made to him. I emphasise: -there has been nothing illegal,<br />
there has been nothing which was so unusual as to be improper. This<br />
is a great opportunity in the Parliament for people who are<br />
answerable to the public, that is members of Parliament, Opposition<br />
Leaders and others to specify if there is anything illegal or if there<br />
is anything so unusual as to be improper. I would like to emphasise<br />
that, as was reported in the press, we had a loan raising, the other<br />
day, in New York which was filled in a single day. Now this was in<br />
the light of reports which are made by the agencies which assess the<br />
credit worthiness of various nations. For the first time, about last<br />
September or October, Australia was given a triple A credit rating,<br />
the top credit rating in the world equal to Canada, France, Germany </p>
<p>4<br />
and -the like; the first time that Australia had ever got it.<br />
And recently the other agency came to Australia and confirmed that<br />
assessment. Standard and Poor were here last month or the previous<br />
month and confirmed it. So Australia has an equally top credit rating<br />
with any country in the world; the last loan we raised was filled<br />
in a single day.<br />
QUESTION: Will the Caucus Meeting be put forward due to the<br />
recalling of the House of Representatives?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No) I haven't planned to do so.<br />
QUESTION: Will the guidelines of raising loans overseas be changed<br />
or reviewed by you in light of what's happened in recent times?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: The method for the Government to raise a loan has<br />
for countless years back been the same. A loan is raised on the<br />
authority of the Executive Council.<br />
QUESTION: Did you ever consider having a judicial inquiry into the<br />
overseas loan-funds borrowing, and if so does the recalling of<br />
Parliament now overshadow that?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I have considered having a judicial inquiry, a<br />
Royal Commission into any matters where a Royal Commission is<br />
appropriate. I will still consider that if any questions arise which<br />
would seem to show that that was the proper course. If allegations<br />
are made or documents produced in Parliament for which there is no<br />
proper explanation and a Royal Commission would be the appropriate<br />
procedure to seek an explanation, then of course I will appoint the<br />
Royal Commission. But let me point out this: that Royal Commissions<br />
or inquiries of any kind are only set up to ascertain facts. They<br />
don't issue decisions, they don't bring down judgements, they don't<br />
impose penalties, they don't deliver verdicts. A Royal Commission is<br />
only to ascertain facts and it can make a recommendation, it can make<br />
a report on the facts as it sees it. But the fact that a Royal<br />
Commission believes that the facts establish certain matters doesn't<br />
conclude the question. If there is any matter which I believe shows<br />
any illegality then I will of course pursue it. I told you a couple<br />
of days ago that it seemed quite possible that Mr Sear'Cowls' action,<br />
admitted by him in a Statutory Declaration his action in falsifying<br />
telexes that that should be investigated. If that was illegal, as </p>
<p>5<br />
would certainly appear to be possible, then action should be taken<br />
to prosecute hima. It is not clear, it's perhaps unlikely~ that he<br />
has committed any offence against Federal law but the general question<br />
of his having committed an offence against State laws and which State<br />
would have been concerned, that is being pursued. Now here is a clear<br />
case; there would be in that Statutory Declaration admitted facts.<br />
Now if those facts disclose any illegality there will be no hesitation<br />
whatever, there has been no hesitation in pursuing the legal<br />
consequences of that action and bringing them home to Mr Sear Cowls.<br />
QUESTION: Would you see your sacking of Dr Cairns based solely on<br />
his not having authority to raise loans?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No. Dr Cairns had his commission terminated because,<br />
on the facts as they appear, he has misled the House of Representatives<br />
You will remember that he stated on the 4th June, in answer to a<br />
question by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, and an interjection<br />
by the Leader of the Opposition, that he had not offered anybody a<br />
commission or a brokerage fee of 2 on any loan monies that he<br />
found or introduced. Subsequently, a photostat appeared of a letter<br />
of the 7th of March which had Dr Cairns' signature on it and which<br />
offered a brokerage fee of 23 to Mr George Harris in those<br />
circumstances. I discussed this photostat with Dr Cairns last<br />
Tuesday, late afternoon, and we agreed that he should think about<br />
it and the following day give me a written explanation. He gave<br />
me a written explanation at 6.00 p. m. on Wednesday afternoon that<br />
he had no recollection of having signed the letter of which we<br />
had looked at the photostat. In those circumstances there would be<br />
an allegation that he had misled the House. It would have been an<br />
irresistible allegation in the absence of any explanation. That<br />
is why I advised the Governor-General to terminate Dr Cairns'<br />
commission. QUESTION: Members of your own Party have been critical of that action<br />
because there was no inquiry first and it didn't have the backing of<br />
Caucus. The dismissal of Dr Cairns as Deputy. </p>
<p>-6<br />
PRIME MINISTER: There was no option for any Prime Minister in<br />
such a matter. No Prime Minister can have a Minister against whom<br />
it could be said that he has misled the Parliament.<br />
QUESTION: Would you allow Dr Cairns to serve as a Minister again<br />
under you?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No.<br />
QUESTION: Do you propose tabling also Departmental documents<br />
associated with the Connor loan raising propositions?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No, I propose to, as I said, to table the documents<br />
which have been signed by Ministers and those documents which, as I<br />
have told you, I have sought from Departmental Heads and those<br />
officials concerning letters signed by Ministers.<br />
QUESTION: How many communications between Mr Connor and Mr Khemlani<br />
will you be tabling?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Two letters.<br />
QUESTION: The letter and the memorandum?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: The two letters.<br />
QUESTION: And are you satisfied at_ having looked at those again<br />
recently ) that no interpretation of them could lead to an agency<br />
or commission or any understanding by Mr Khemlani that he was<br />
to operate on Australia's behalf?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: That is right. I am satisfied of that. That's not<br />
only my own opinion but of course, in such matters I seek the advice<br />
of the crown law authorities, that has been given. It confirms that<br />
opinion. That advice was sought some weeks ago. Mind you, you will<br />
remember that I stated in the Parliament, I think it was on the<br />
of May, that not a cent had been paid to Mr Khemlani, not a<br />
cent had to be paid to Mr Khemlani and that not a cent would be paid<br />
to Mr Ehemlani. I made that statement in the confidence that there<br />
was no inducement offered to Mr Khemlani which would give him any,<br />
which would lay any obligation at all on the Australian Government. </p>
<p>7<br />
QUESTION: At the time that you agreed to Mr Connor seeking an<br />
overseas loan, did you have a clear idea of the detailed purposes for<br />
whicbhit was required and are you prepared to say what each amount<br />
was to be spent on?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I have in mind that if this matter arises in the<br />
House the information can be given.<br />
QUESTION: The Opposition apparently is already considering recalling<br />
the Senate to use its majority to force a judicial inquiry over<br />
this issue. Would that concern you?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Now. I have made it plain on earlier occasions, I<br />
mightn't have mentioned it to you, that neither House of Parliament<br />
can hold a judicial inquiry. A judge is commissioned to hold an<br />
inquiry by the Governor-General acting on the advice of the Ministry<br />
or at the request of a Minister. Judges are not appointed to hold<br />
inquiries by either House of the Parliament or by both Houses of<br />
Parliamenh. You might remember that there have been resolutions by<br />
Houses seeking judicial inquiries. For instance -there was a year or<br />
so ago a motion by the House of Representa. tives that there should be<br />
an inquiry into various social issues. The Government, of course,<br />
commissioned the judge, the archbishop and the other women who are<br />
conducting that inquiry as a Royal Commission. Again the Senate,<br />
a couple of months ago, asked that there should be a judicial<br />
inquiry into the qualifications of Members of Parliament, outside<br />
interests and so on.., arising from the Webster case. It was, of course,<br />
recognised by the Senators who unanimously passed that resolution that<br />
it lay upon the Government to commission the judge or judges to hold<br />
that inquiry. Also in that matter there is a case pending and there<br />
has been another judgemnent given and judges are not available, they<br />
are not willing to serve on that inquiry until the next court case<br />
has been determined. So let that be quite plain. The only inquiry<br />
that either House of Parliament could hold itself would be by its<br />
own members. I don ' t believe that that sort of inquiry impresses<br />
the public because every Member of Parliament is a partisan and<br />
votes accordingly. </p>
<p>8-<br />
QUESTION: Mr Prime Minister there has been increasing pressure on<br />
Mr Fraser, particularly from people like Mr Bjelke-Ptersen, to<br />
precipitate a double dissolution. Do you believe Mr Fraser will<br />
hold out still against that pressure on him or will he cave in<br />
and try for a double dissolution?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Oh Mr Bjelke-Petersen is not the only one that has<br />
given this advice, Sir Charles Court has given it also. It is<br />
quite plain however that the proper course is to allow any<br />
Parliament to run the full course for which it was elected. And the<br />
House of Representatives is elected for a period of up to three<br />
years from the first day on which it-sat, that is, the House of<br />
Representatives should go until the middle of 1977.<br />
QUESTION: Mr Fraser has said that but also he gave himself an out<br />
by talking of extraordinary circumstances. You don't believe that<br />
the events of the past week would constitute those extraordinary<br />
circumstances. PRIME MINISTER: There have been some extraordinary circumstances,<br />
namely the circumstances which led me to terminate Dr Cairns'<br />
commission. But nobody has doubted that I, Mr Fraser hasn't doubted<br />
that I did the correct thing. So that's not an extraordinary<br />
circumstance which would justify trying to get non-Labor Senators<br />
to vote against Supply. It was an extraordinary situation for any<br />
Minister and regrettably the Deputy Prime Minister of all ministers,<br />
to mislead the House as we must assume was the case in the absence<br />
of any explanation at all. Now-, the proper result ensued.<br />
QUESTION: Your answer before last you gave very good reason for<br />
not letting either House inquire into this matter by saying that such<br />
an inquiry would be partisan. Surely it would seem that the proper<br />
course would be a judicial inquiry? It's still not clear to<br />
me why you are not having a judicial inquiry?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Well I thought that TDT people were sharper than<br />
that. I thought that the facts would be clear. Let me go over it<br />
again. Where there are facts which appear to be the foundation of<br />
legal proceedings, those legal proceedings will be taken' as far as<br />
the Government is concerned. They are being investigated now in the </p>
<p>9<br />
one case where the facts are known and where it would appear that<br />
there might have been illegalities. Now where there is something<br />
which is illegal or so unusual as to be improper and it is not<br />
possible to ascertain the facts by ordinary police inquiries, by<br />
ordinary investigations, then there can be a case for a R6yal<br />
Commission. But I repeat that a Royal Commission or any form of<br />
inquiry can only seek facts. It can then express its view on<br />
those facts. But its view has no legal consequences'whatever and<br />
it can make recommendations but those recommendations do not lead<br />
to any necessary action. But what I believe we all have to recognise<br />
is that if there has been a breach of the law in any respect then<br />
the courts exist to see that that breach of the law is punished. </p>
