PRIME MINJISTER<br />
VISIT TO UK AND USA<br />
I am pleased to announce that I will visit the United Kingdom from 18 to 25 June and<br />
the United States of America from 25 June to 1 July.<br />
In the United Kingdom, I look forward to meeting Her Majesty the Queen.<br />
I also look forward to holding discussions with the Prime Minister, Mr Blair, and<br />
members of his cabinet.<br />
The traditional links between Australia and the United Kingdom are the foundation of<br />
a relationship which remains close and strong, and very relevant to the contemporary<br />
interests of both countries. My visit will be a valuable opportunity to discuss with Mr<br />
Blair how we can pursue our many common interests.<br />
In the United States, I shall meet President Clinton and also members of his<br />
administration and of the Congress.<br />
My visit will build on the success of President Clinton's visit to Australia last<br />
November in further developing the strong relations between Australia and the United<br />
States and our cooperation in the Asia Pacific region.<br />
In New York I will have discussions with the business and financial community about<br />
the benefits the government's economic reform agenda will bring in terms of<br />
strengthening our trade and investment links.<br />
