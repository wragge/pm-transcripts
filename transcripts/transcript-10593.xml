    <content><![CDATA[<p>Millions of followers of Rugby League will be delighted to know that the damaging and destructive split in the game appears to be healed.</p>
<p>This is a great Christmas present for a great game, whose participants and supporters alike have longed for an end to a division which was eroding public enthusiasm for the code.</p>
<p>I congratulate the Australian Rugby League and the executives of Super League for the commonsense and commitment to the game they have displayed in reaching this agreement.</p>
<p>Long may the game prosper and bring enjoyment to Australians.</p>
<p>20 December 1997</p>
