CHECK AGAIMIST DELIkewk1i<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
SPEECH AT KOGARAH MARIST HIGH SCHOOL 11 RARCH 1984<br />
IT IS WITH MUCH PLEASURE THAT LAST YEAR I ACCEPTED THE<br />
INVITATION TO COME TO KOGARAH TODAY TO OPEN YOUR SCHOOL'S<br />
MAJOR EXTENSIONS AND RENOVATIONS,<br />
I DID SO RECOGNISING THIS AS A VERY IMPORTANT EVENT IN THE<br />
LIVES OF YOUR STUDENTS, STAFF, PARENTS AND MEMBERS OF THE<br />
LOCAL COMMUNITY. I WAS ALSO MINDFUL THAT THIS YEAR, 1984,<br />
iS THE SEVENTY-FIFTH ANNIVERSARY OF THE FOUNDATION OF THE<br />
SCHOOL,<br />
AND THIS IS A GREAT SCHOOL. IT HAS EVERY REASON TO BE PROUD<br />
OF ITS CONTRIBUTION TO LOCAL AND NATIONAL LIFE. THE FORMER<br />
ARCHBISHOP OF SYDNEY, CARDINAL GILROY, WAS A DISTINGUISHED<br />
EX-STUDENT. YOU ALSO COUNT A NUMBER OF LEADING<br />
PARLIAMENTARIANS AMONG YOUR OLD BOYS SENATOR GRAHAM<br />
RICHARDSON AND JIM CARLTON AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL AND BRIAN<br />
BANNON AND BRIAN LANGTON AT STATE LEVEL. THEY ARE EACH IN<br />
THEIR RESPECTIVE WAYS WORKING FOR A BETTER AUSTRALIA.<br />
THE EXCELLENT JOB OF EXTENSION AND RENOVATION YOU HAVE NOW<br />
COMPLETED AUGERS WELL FOR THE FUTURE, THE NEW FACILITIES<br />
WILLo I AM SURE, PROVIDE AN IDEAL ENVIRONMENT FOR BOTH<br />
STUDENTS AND STAFF. THE 1IORK AND EFFORT PUT INTO THEIR<br />
PLANNIN AND CONSTnUCTION IS A CREDIT TO ALL INVOLVED. </p>
<p>I UNDERSTAND THAT THE TOTAL COST OF THIS PROJECT WAS<br />
$ 845,000 AND THAT A COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT CAPITAL WORKS<br />
GRANT OF $ 545,000 WAS MADE TO HELP ALLAY THE COST. PARENTS<br />
AND FRIENDS HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THE BALANCE,<br />
EDUCATION NEEDS TO BE A CO-OPERATIVE EFFORT BETWEEN<br />
GOVERNMENT AND THE COMMUNITY, IN PARTICULAR PARENTS, THE<br />
COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT'S CONTRIBUTION To KOGARAH MARIST<br />
HIGH SCHOOL HIGHLIGHTS THE GOVERNMENT' S HEAVY COMMITMENT TO<br />
THIS CO-OPERATIVE EFFORT. PARENTS OWN CONTRIBUTIONS<br />
UNDERLINE IN A QUITE UNMISTAKEABLE WAY THE HIGH VALUE THEY<br />
ALSO PLACE ON TOP QUALITY EDUCATION,<br />
OF COURSE A SCHOOL DOES NOT RUN ON BUILDINGS ALONE.<br />
ACCORDINGLY THE COMMONWEALTH ALSO GIVES GRANTS FOR SCHOOLS'<br />
OPERATING COSTS. INi 1983 COrtIUMNWEALTH GRANTS To KOGARAH<br />
MARIST HIGH SCHOOL WERE CLOSE TO $ 900,000. INDEED AS PART<br />
OF OUR EDUCATION POLICY THE GRANTS FOR 1984 WERE INCREASED<br />
By 3 PER CENT IN REAL TERMS OVER AND ABOVE INCREASES IN<br />
SCHOOL COSTS.<br />
THIS PATTERN OF SUPPORT To KOGARAH MARIST HIGH SCHOOL IS A<br />
CONCRETE DEMONSTRATION OF THE AUSTRALIAN LABOR GOVERNMENT'S<br />
VERY STRONG COMMITMENT TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF A VIGOROUS AND<br />
EFFECTIVE NATIONAL EDUCATION SYSTEM A SYSTEM WITHIN WHICH<br />
NON-GOVERNMENT SCHOOLS ARE A CRUCIAL PART, </p>
<p>LET ME COMMENT BRIEFLY ON THE BASIC ASSUMPTIONS MY<br />
GOVERNMENT BRINGS TO EDUCATION POLICY.<br />
AS A NATION WE MUST BE PREPARED TO INVEST* HEAVILY IN HUMAN*<br />
SKILLS, WE NEED A COMMUNITY AND WORKFORCE THAT HAS THE<br />
EDUCATION NECESSARY TO COPE WITH AND ADAPT TO A RAPIDLY<br />
CHANGING WORLD,<br />
AS A GOVERNMENT WE ARE GIVING URGENT ATTENTION TO THE<br />
CREATION OF A BASE OF SKILLS ACROSS THE WHOLE WORKFORCETHROUGH<br />
EDUCATION AND TRAINING OF OUR YOUNG PEOPLE AND<br />
THROUGH THE ESTBALISHMENT OF NECESSARY RETRAINING FACILITIES<br />
FOR THE EXISTING WORKFORCE. ONLY IF WE EQUIP OUR PEOPLE<br />
WITH THE CAPACITIES AND ATTITUDES TO COMPETE EFFECTIVELY IN<br />
THE WORLD AT LARGE, WITH FLEXIBILITY AND WITH CONFIDENCE,<br />
CAN WE MAKE THE MOST OF FUTURE OPPORTUNITIES. IN THE<br />
PRESENT DAY WORLD., WITH ITS INCREASINGLY SOPHISTICATED<br />
TECHNOLOGIES AND RAPID CHANGE, PEOPLE MUST HAVE THE CAPACITY<br />
AND SKILL TO MOVE WITH THE TIMES, TO BE FLEXIBLE, TO BE<br />
INNOVATIVE AND CREATIVE.<br />
ACCORDINGLY THE GOVERNMENT SEES IT AS IMPORTANT THAT SCHOOLS<br />
PROVIDE VOCATIONALLY RELEVANT EDUCATION, As I HAVE SAID CUR<br />
WORLD DEPENDS UPON INCREASINGLY SOPHISTICATED TECHNOLOGIES. l<br />
STUDENTS NEED TO BE GIVEN AN UNDERSTANDING OF THESE<br />
TECHNOLOG IES. I u </p>
<p>TODAYo FOR EXAMPLE, COMPUTER LITERACY IS A NECESSARY<br />
PREREQUISITE FOR MORE AND MORE JOBS, ACCORDINGLY THIS<br />
GOVERNMENT HAS INTRODUCED A NATIONAL COMPUTER EDUCATION<br />
PROGRAM OF $ 18 MILLION OVER THE NEXT THREE YEARS, WE WILL<br />
BE PROVIDING FUNDS TO BOTH GOVERNMENT AND NON-GOVERNMENT<br />
SCHOOLS SO THAT THEY CAN PROVIDE AN ADEQUATE UNDERSTANDING<br />
OF THE USES OF THIS TECHNOLOGY, ITS IMPACT ON THE NATURE OF<br />
WORK AND JOB OPPORTUNITIES, AS WELL AS TO IMPROVE THE LEVEL<br />
OF BASIC COMPUTER LITERACY$<br />
ENCOURAGING A REASONABLE DIVERSITY IN EDUCATION, BOTH IN<br />
GOVERNMENT AND NON-GOVERNMENT SCHOOLS,, IS ALSO AN INTEGRAL<br />
PART OF THE AUSTRALIAN LABOR GOVERNMENT' S EDUCATION POLICY<br />
APPROACH. SUCH ASSISTANCE IS B3EING PROVIDED WITH DUE REGARD<br />
B01TH TO THE PRINCIPLE OF EQUALITY OF EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITY.,<br />
AND THE PRINCIPLE OF NEED AS DEFINED IN CLOSE CONSULTATION<br />
WITH INTERESTED PARTIES,<br />
To PROVIDE THE EQUALITY OF EDUCATIONAL OPPORT!', 1; TY NECESSARY<br />
FOR ALL AUSTRALIANS TO BE ABLE TO SHARE IN OUR FUTURE, IS A<br />
MAJOR THRUST OF THE GOVERNMENT'S EDUCATION POLICY, THE<br />
YOUNG ARE OUR NATION 6S FUTURE, No CHILD'S EDUCATION AND<br />
DEVELOPMENT SHOULD BE PENALISED BY SOCIAL OR ECONOMIC<br />
BACK( GROUND, LACK OF FINANCIAL SUPPORT OR LACK OF SUITABLE<br />
OPPORTUINITI ES. 4 </p>
<p>LET ME TAKE YOU BACK( SOME 10 YEARS IN 1973 THE KARMEL<br />
COMMITTEE IN ITS REPORT ON SCHOOLS IN AUSTRALIA FOUND A<br />
VERY CONSIDERABLE DISPARITY IN THE RESOURCES AVAILABLE<br />
FOR TEACHING TO DIFFERENT SCHOOLS, SINCE THEN COMMONWEALTj<br />
GOVERNMENTS OF BOTH POLITICAL PERSUASIONS HAVE PROVIDED<br />
COMMONWEALTH ASSISTANCE TO NON-GOVERNMENT SCHOOLS ON THE<br />
BASIS OF THE RELATIVE NEED OF EACH SCHOOL.<br />
THE SCHOOLS COMMISSION HAS JUST RELEASED A DISCUSSION PAPER<br />
ON COMMONWEALTH FUNDING OF SCHOOLS AND IT NOTEs flAT THi-Ji"-<br />
ARE STILL SIGNIFICANT DISPARITIES IN THE RESOURCES AVAILABLE<br />
TO SCHOOLS,<br />
THE AUSTRALIAN LABOR GOVERNMENT' S EDUCATION FUNDING POLICIES<br />
ARE DIRECTED TO PROVIDING A GREATER LEVEL OF ASSISTANCE TO<br />
THOSE WITH A GREATER NEED, OUR IMMEDIATE OBJECTIVE IS TO<br />
REDUCE THE LEVEL OF INEQUALITY BETWEEN SCHOOLS BY RAISING<br />
THE STANDARDS OF THOSE SCHOOLS MOST IN NEED. THE GAP BETWEEN<br />
LOW RESOURCE SCHOOLS AND OTHER SCHOOLS HAS TO BE REDUCED.<br />
IN DEVELOPING ITS POLICIES IN THE EDUCATION AREA,, AS IN MOST<br />
OTHER FIELDS, THE GOVERNMIENT HAS HAD TO BALANCE COMPETING<br />
CLAIMS FOR ITS LIMITED FUNDS. </p>
<p>THE LIMITS IMPOSED IN 1983 BY THE VERY LARGE INHERITED<br />
BUDGET DEFICIT MEANT THAT THE LEVEL OF ASSISTANCE WE<br />
CONSIDERED APPROPRIATE FOR NEEDY SCHOOLS COULD ONLY BE<br />
ACHIEVED BY A SLIGHT REDISTRIBUTION OF FUNDS AWAY FROM A<br />
SMALL NUMBER OF SCHOOLS WHICH HAD THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF<br />
PRIVATE INCOME.<br />
IN DOING THIS WE SHIFTED SOME OF THE GOVERNMENT'S SUPPORT<br />
FROM THOSE WITH A LOT OF PRIVATE INCOME TO THOSE WITH<br />
VERY LITTLE.<br />
THE EXTENT OF THE SHIFT INVOLVED HAS SOMETIMES BEEN<br />
EXAGGERATED, THE REDUCTION FOR THE FEW WEALTHY SCHOOLS<br />
AFFECTED AMOUNTED TO ABOUT $ 28 A TERM FOR A PRIMARY<br />
STUDENT AND $ 4j5 A TERM FOR A SECONDARY STUDENT. AT THE<br />
SAME TIME WE INCREASED GRANTS FOR OVER 90 PER CENT OF ALL<br />
MON-GOVERNMENT SCHOOLS, THAT, AS IS OVERWHELMINGLY<br />
ACKNOWLEDGED IN THIS COUNTRV, IS AN EQUITABLE AND DECENT<br />
APPROACH.<br />
BECAUSE OF OUR POLICY OF DIRECTING ASSISTANCE TO THOSE IN<br />
NEED, OVER 90 PER CENT OF NON-GOVERNMENT SCHOOLS WILL<br />
RECEIVE A HIGHER REAL LEVEL OF GRANT IN 198' 4 THAN BEFORE.<br />
THIS YEAR WE WILL INCREASE OUR ASSISTANCE BY $ 9.5 MILLION<br />
IN REAL TERMS TO $ 627 MILLION, INCLUDING $ 540' MILLION IN<br />
RECURRENT GRANTS. THE AUSTRALIAN LABOR GOVERNMENT IS GIVING<br />
MORE M4ONEY TO NON-GOVERNMENT SCHOOLS THAN ANY GOVERNMENT<br />
BEFORE IT, </p>
<p>POLICY IN THIS AREA IS OF CRITICAL INTEREST TO ALL OF US<br />
AFTER ALL OUR CHILDREN'IS FUTURE AND THROUGH THEM OUR OWN<br />
FUTURE IS AT STAKE, IT IS FOR THIS REASON THAT I CONSIDER<br />
IT AXIOMATIC THAT NO CHILD SHOULD BE PENALISED OR DEPRIVED)<br />
OF ACCESS TO AN ACCEPTABLE LEVEL OF EDUCATION.<br />
THE GOVERNMENT RECOGNISES THAT MANY PARENTS CHOOSE TO<br />
EDUCATE THEIR CHILDREN OUTSIDE A GOVERNMENT SCHOOL SYSTEM.,<br />
IT ALSO RECOGNISES THE HIGH STANDARD WHICH A NUMBER OF<br />
NON-GOVERNMENT SCHOO0LS HAVE ATTAINED. BUT IN SUBSIDISING<br />
THE CHOICE BY PARENTS OF A PARTICULAR SYSTEM OF EDUCATION<br />
THE GOVERNMENT DOES NOT ACCEPT THAT IT MUST SUBSIDISE ALL<br />
CHOICES EQUALLY. IN THE GOVERNMENT'S VIEW THE SUBSIDY<br />
LEVEL SHOULD BE DETERMINED BY NEED BY THE SCHOOLS'I NEED FOR<br />
ADEQUATE RESOURCES SO THAT ALL SCHOOLS CAN OPERATE AT LEAST<br />
AT AN ACCEPTABLE COMMUNITY STANDARDO<br />
THE GOVERNMENT IS STRONGLY OF THE VIEW THAT A NEW EDUCATION<br />
FUNDING SCHEME THAT IS BASED ON BETTER AND FAIRER MEASURES<br />
OF NEED SHOULD BE ESTABLISHED.<br />
THE COMMONWEALTH SCHOOLS COMMISSION HAS RECENTLY PRODUCED A<br />
PUBLIC DISCUSSION PAPER THAT OUTLINES OPTIONS THAT IT SEES<br />
FOR COMMONWEALTH FUNDING FOR 1985 AND BEYOND. </p>
<p>MEMBERS OF THE COMMISSION HAVE COMMENCED AN EXTENSIVE<br />
PROCESS OF CONSULTATION WITH SCHOO0L ORGANISATIONS AND<br />
STATE GOVERNMENTS REGARDING THE EDUCATION FUNDING ISSUES<br />
RAISED BY THIS PAPER$ THIS EXTENSIVE PROCESS OF<br />
CONSULTATION IS AIMED AT ENSURING THAT THE VIEWS OF ALL<br />
THE INTERESTED PARTIES ARE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT. ONCE THESE<br />
CONSULTATIONS HAVE BEEN COMPLETED THE SCHOOLS COMMISSION<br />
WILL PUT ITS RECOMMENDATIONS ON FUTURE FUNDING TO THE<br />
GOVERNMENT, I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT WHILE THE PRECISE DETAILS OF THE<br />
FUNDING FORMULA HAVE NOT YET BEEN RESOLVED, NO NEEDY SCHOOL<br />
WILL RECEIVE LESS REAL ASSISTANCE THAN IT DOES TODAY1<br />
THE GOVERNMENT AIMS, THROUGH A FULL PROCESS OF CONSULTATION,<br />
TO ESTABLISH A CLIMATE FOR EDUCATION THAT WILL BE<br />
HARMONIOUS, PRODUCTIVE AND LASTING. THIS WILL BE THE<br />
PURPOSE OF MY OWN INVOLVEMENT WITH THE CONSULTATIONS NOW<br />
TAK( ING PLACE. WITH SENATOR SUSAN RYAN I AIM TO ENSURE THAT<br />
THE GOVERNMENT'S OBJECTIVES IN THIS AREA ARE CARRIED FORWARD<br />
iN SUCH A MANNER AS TO ENSURE THEY HAVE THE FULL SUPPORT OF<br />
ALL INTERESTED PARTIES.<br />
As WE DEVELOP THE FUNDING PROCESSES FOR NEXT YEAR AND LATER,<br />
THE LONG-TERM NEEDS OF THE COMMUNITY AS A WHOLE MUST BE<br />
PARAMOUNT. THE FUTURE OF AUSTRALIA DEPENDS ON ITS MAIN<br />
RESOURCE ITS YOUTH. THE AUSTRALIAN LABOR GOVERNMENT IS </p>
<p>WORKING TOGETHER WITH THE COMMUNITY TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR<br />
YOUNG PEOPLE ARE GIVEN EVERY OPPORTUNITY. TO EQUIP THEMSELVES<br />
FOR THE DIFFICULTIES AND CHANGING WORLD THAT IS AHEAD OF THEM.<br />
THIS PROCESS OF CONSULTATION AND CONSENSUS THE REMOVAL OF<br />
CONFLICT IS THE MAINSPRING OF THIS GOVERNMENT'S WHOLE APPROACH<br />
TO GOVERNMENT.<br />
ONLY BY SUCH AN APPROACH CAN WE TRULY HARNESS OUR RESOURCES<br />
FOR THE PUBLIC GOOD.<br />
I AM PROUD TO HAVE BEEN ASSOCIATED IN THE PAST WITH EFFORTS TO<br />
ERODE AND,. HOPEFULLY, TO REMOVE THE STATE AID ISSUE AS A DIVISIVE<br />
FEATURE OF POLITICS IN THIS COUNTRY.<br />
STATE AID WILL NOT BE ALLOWED TO BECOME AN ISSUE UNDER MY<br />
GOVERNM4ENT. THE CATHOLIC CHURCH HAS PLAYED A SIGNIFICANT AND CONSTRUCTIVE:<br />
ROLE IN THIS LONG STRUGGLE TO BRING EQUITY AND FAIRNESS TO<br />
OUR EDUCATION SYSTEM. I HAVE WELCOMED YOUR CO-OPERATION WITH<br />
US IN THIS FUNDAMENTALLY IMPORTANT AREA OF OUR NATION I S AFFA:! RS.<br />
I LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING CLOSE CONSULTATIONS WITH CHURCH<br />
LEADERS IN THE NECESSARY ONGOING DISCUSSIONS ON EDUCATION<br />
FUNDING* IT GIVES ME GREAT PLEASURE TO DECLARE THESE NEW FACILITIES<br />
OPEN AND TO WISH THE STUDENTS, STAFF AND SUPPORTERS OF THE<br />
SCHOOL WELL FOR THE FUTURE, </p>
