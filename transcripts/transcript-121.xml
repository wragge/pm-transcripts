COMMONWEALTH TAXING POWERS<br />
REPLY BY THE PRIME MINISTER THE RT. HON. R. G.<br />
MENZIES, IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, ON<br />
WEDNESDAY 21ST OCTOBER, 1959<br />
MR. BIRD: Has the Prime Minister noted the remarks of the Victorian<br />
Premier, Mr. Bolte, to the effect that the Commonweal th<br />
Government had financially throttled the States by using taxing<br />
powers that it no longer had the right to retain? In view of<br />
the seriousness of this statement will the Prime Minister arrange<br />
for a debat7e in the House on Commonwealth-State financial<br />
relationships and also on the charge made by Mr. Bolte that<br />
through the power of the purse the Commonwealth dictates State<br />
policy in most subjects.<br />
MR. MENZIES: I noticed a report in the press that the Premier of<br />
Victoria had had some critical remarks to make which, unfortunately,<br />
were based on remarks attributed to me Awhich I had not<br />
made. In a speech in Melbourne I pointed out that there is a<br />
paradox in Australian public opinion, I did not refer to<br />
States or State Governments. I said that the paradox was that<br />
whereas every time there was a proposal to increase the powers o:.<br />
the Commonwealth Parliament, the people found it possible, and<br />
indeed necessary, to vote yet the very people who opposed<br />
the granting of such powers would next day perhaps be on a deputation<br />
to the Commonwealth Government to ask it to accent financial<br />
responsibility for a matter that lay within the pcier of<br />
the States. I thought that was paradoxical. I an a federalist<br />
and I believe in the division of powers, but I pointed out that<br />
I thought there was a little strange and incohsistent thinking<br />
on that matter. Some newspaper was kind enough to say that I<br />
had criticized the States for wanting to retain their powers. I<br />
said nothing of the kind√∏<br />
As to the question of the States retaking their direct<br />
taxing powers, I remind the honourable member that in March<br />
of this year we had a conference with the Premiers, I had promised<br />
such a conference in the course of my policy speech and ve<br />
had a very long, careful and valuable discussion on this very<br />
problem. The upshot of the discussion was that certainly four<br />
States exhibited a complete want of desire to be asked to raise<br />
their own taxes and to live on the proceeds of those taxes, I<br />
pointed out to them Ithink honourable members "-ill ? agreo ith<br />
me that you cannot have a hybrid system in Australia, Either<br />
the States have their taxing powers and exercise them I have<br />
always said that in principle we think that is right or they<br />
do not, but the idea of the Commonwealth raising taxes under a<br />
uniform system in four States and abstaining from raising taxes<br />
for State purposes in two States is not only financially absurd<br />
but I would doubt very much whether it had any constitutional<br />
justification. The result of this very long discussion was as 1<br />
have indicated. The Commonwealth's attitude remains the same,<br />
When the State Governments say that they would like to have<br />
their taxing powers back on suitable terms that have been indicated<br />
to them by me on repeated occasions, we will be most<br />
happy to engage in negotiations to help to produce that result,<br />
In the meantime it is quite beside the point for any individual<br />
State to attack us for retaining scmething against the ,; ill of<br />
the States, I point out that 66 per cent of the States I knov<br />
it is nice to put these things in terms of percentages in<br />
March, 1959, did not want direct taxing powers handed back to<br />
them. </p>
