PRIME MINISTER Press Statement<br />
a June 1975<br />
LOCAL ROAD PROJECTS<br />
Residential streets have been included in urban<br />
local roads assistance for the first time. This means that<br />
Australian Government money can go towards helping local<br />
authorities improve streets in their areas.<br />
The Prime Minister and Member for Werriwa, Mr Whitlam<br />
said today he was delighted to be able to confirm the<br />
Australian Government's policy of providing financial help<br />
to local government so as to help improve the urban<br />
environment. Three projects had been approved in the Werriwa<br />
electorate, he said. The total cost would be $ 191,000 in<br />
1974/ 75. Mr Whitlam said $ 60,000 would be provided for<br />
improving St John's Road through reconstruction between<br />
Sackville Street and Gladstone Street.<br />
One side of Gordon Road will be reconstructed and<br />
kerbed and guttered for $ 113,500. This will be in Gordon<br />
Road from Newbridge Road to Barry Road. Another $ 17,500<br />
will help close some Ingleburn roads for pedestrian use,<br />
namely, various roads bounded by Chester Road, Brenda Street,<br />
Sackville Street and Ingleburn Road.<br />
Mr Whitlam said that the improvements to residential<br />
streets made possible by these grants would have a significant<br />
impact on the environment and on people's lives on the<br />
immediate area of the local road improvement programs.<br />
He said that a total of $ 10.08 million would be<br />
allocated to N. S. W. for local road improvements during the 1974/ 75<br />
to 1976/ 77 period. In all N. S. W. would get $ 2.18 million this<br />
financial year 1974/ 75, rising to $ 3.3 million in 1975/ 76 and<br />
$ 4.6 million in 1976/ 77. Mr Whitlam said the level of these<br />
grants could be expected to increase in subsequent legislation.<br />
