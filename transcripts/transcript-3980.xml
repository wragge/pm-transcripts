PRIME MINISTER F75/ 251 I16<br />
FOR PRESS NOVEMBER 19, 1975<br />
MR JUSTICE WOODWARD'S APPOINTMENT<br />
The Prime Minister, Mr. Fraser, said today<br />
that it had become necessary, as a consequence of the<br />
dissolution of Parliament, to defer the arrangement<br />
for Mr. Justice Woodward to take over the control of<br />
the Australian Security Intelligence organization.<br />
Mr. Justice Woodward's appointment to head<br />
the Organization was to have commenced on 24 November,<br />
but this had been dependent on the passage of a Bill<br />
enabling him to retain his judicial status.<br />
The Bill had not been passed before<br />
Parliament was dissolved and Mr. Justice Woodward,<br />
quite understandably, had to decline the appointment<br />
at this stage. The Prime Minister said that his Government,<br />
if elected on 13 December, would reintroduce the Bill<br />
to enable Mr. Justice Woodward to accept the<br />
appointment that had been proposed.<br />
Pending the passing of the Bill,<br />
Mr. F. J. Mahony, who has been acting as Director-General<br />
since 29 September, will continue in control of the<br />
Organization. He w ill be appointed to the position<br />
until 29 February 1976. </p>
