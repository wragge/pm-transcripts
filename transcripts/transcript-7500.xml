PRIMETRMINITE<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF DOORSTOP, PARLIAMENT HOUSE, 20 FEBRUARY 1989<br />
E 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime minister you suggested this morning that<br />
pensioners would have more reason to vote for you at the<br />
next election. Why should that be?<br />
PM: Well I didn't really say something then that I haven't<br />
said before. I've indicated that I have two processes<br />
going. one is the review being conducted now under the<br />
leadership of the Minister, Brian Howe, consulting with<br />
various organisations around the country in the light of the<br />
Bettina Cass report on retirement incomes. The second thing<br />
I've established is the backbench committee, which is going<br />
round the country listening to and talking with pensioner<br />
groups. Out of these processes there will come decisions<br />
calculated to and which will in fact improve further the<br />
position of pensioners in this country. Now that's what's<br />
going to happen and all I said this morning is to remind<br />
them that that's going on, that will happen.<br />
JOURNALIST: On another subject Prime Minister, Senator<br />
Button suggested over the weekend that there ought to be<br />
action taken to encourage Australians to save rather than<br />
spend. Do you support such moves?<br />
PM: Well he said that this is something that is worth<br />
considering, this is not new of course. It's a matter that<br />
we've considered in EPAC. It is the case here as in some<br />
other countries that the savings ratio is too low. It's<br />
legitimate for Senator Button to raise that. As I say it's<br />
been considered in EPAC, it's something that the Governmen.' t<br />
may consider.<br />
JOURNALIST: inaudible<br />
PM: No I'm not going to any details of that.<br />
JOURNALIST: Do you think you can overcome the tax avoidance<br />
problems that most such schemes raise?<br />
PM: I mean you're getting you're trying to take me beyond<br />
what I'm prepared to do. I'm saying that the question of<br />
the relatively low savings ratio is something of a concern.<br />
It's something that's worth looking at. But I'm not saying<br />
we are going to be looking at a tax deduction scheme. It<br />
may come into the consideration. </p>
<p>-2-<br />
JOURNALIST: Are people saving for a home being penalised by<br />
having their savings taxed?<br />
PM: Well I suppose that anyone who is saving for any<br />
objective, whether it's for a home or something else, wou]. d<br />
say that they would rather not be paying tax on their<br />
interest, that's understandable.<br />
JOURNALIST: When you say the issue is worthy of<br />
consideration does that mean that any incentive might be<br />
linked to the announcement of tax cuts?<br />
PM: No, again you're just trying to unsuccessfully take me<br />
further than I'm prepared to go. I've said no more than<br />
that the level of the savings ratio is of some concern, so<br />
much so that it's been considered by EPAC before. I haven't<br />
got anything on the agenda about it.<br />
JOURNALIST: Will the Government take up Senator Button's<br />
suggestion and at least look at the matter or do you think<br />
that that's already been covered in the EPAC situation?<br />
PM: Well there's been some reference to it in the EPAC<br />
paper. It was considered. If the Senator wished to raise<br />
it in the Cabinet well of course he would have that right.<br />
But I'm not being coy or tricky about this. It's something<br />
that's not on our agenda at the moment.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke do the airline pilots have a case to<br />
strike today?<br />
PM: No. That's an act of gross irresponsibility.<br />
