PRESS STATEMENT NO. 376<br />
21 November, 1974<br />
BRISBANE FLOOD MITIGATION<br />
The Prime Minister, Mr. Whitlam, said today that<br />
flood mitigation works in Brisbane had been delayed by the<br />
Queensland Government's failure to co-operate with the<br />
Australian Government.<br />
In a written reply to a question from Senator<br />
K.* Martin ( Queensland), Mr. Whitlam said: " As long ago as<br />
23 March 1973 1 emphasised that the provision of detailed<br />
information was essential to our decision.<br />
" That information has still not been provided by<br />
the Queensland Government.<br />
" As soon as explicit proposals are submitted by the<br />
Queensland Government the Australian Government will be in<br />
a position to take prompt decisions on a case by case basis."<br />
Mr. Whitlam said he shared the concern felt by<br />
many members and senators at the long delay before mitigation<br />
works could be undertaken.<br />
Mr. Whitlam said he first drew attention to the<br />
flood danger in Brisbane when speaking at a civic reception<br />
there on 23 March 1973.<br />
At that time he stated: Brisbane has a special problem with<br />
the flooding caused by cyclonic rains on the Breakfast,<br />
Enoggera, Oxley, and Norman Creeks and Kedron Brook and<br />
urban development in the flood plains of these waterways.<br />
This has been a matter. of concern for the Brisbane City<br />
Council and the State Government.<br />
" Sir Gordon Chalk, while Acting Premier, wrote to me<br />
in December 1972 and asked, among other matters, about<br />
assistance for the City Council for a'flood mitigation<br />
scheme. He said the proposed scheme was under expert<br />
investigation and that when plans were completed it<br />
was intended to ask for Commonwealth financial assistance.<br />
I understand that the report arising from this investigation<br />
was completed in the last week or so. </p>
<p>-2-<br />
" The Australian Government has not previously taken<br />
part in schemes of precisely this kind...<br />
" Nevertheless, we shall look into the question of<br />
financial assistance. To do so, however, the<br />
Australian Government will need all relevant information,<br />
including the physical and economic facts,<br />
before a decision can be taken.<br />
" My Government is therefore prepared to lend its<br />
expertise and resources to assist in a study of this<br />
matter. We shall be willing to participate at the<br />
official level in a joint working party with officials<br />
of the State and Brisbane City Council to examine the<br />
problem as a whole."<br />
Mr. Whitlam siad that on 16 November 1973 the Premier of<br />
Queensland asked the Australian Government to participate in the<br />
whole flood mitigation scheme for Brisbane on the basis that the<br />
Australian Government should contribute 40% of the cost, the<br />
Queensland Government 40% and the Brisbane City Council 20%. On<br />
9 September 1974 he suggested that the Australian Government<br />
should meet the whole cost of the flood mitigation component of the<br />
proposed Wivenhoe Dam.<br />
Mr. Whitlam said the Premier's requests for assistance had been<br />
closely considered by the Australian Government but they had been<br />
prevented from making any recommendations by the lack of information.<br />
" Information as the type of works, their timing, costs, and<br />
likely benefits is essential to any financial decision by the<br />
Australian Government, he said.<br />
" We have made repeated requests at official level to the<br />
Queensland Government to furnish firm works proposals on which<br />
we could base decisions.<br />
" On 4 July, 1974 the Department of Urban and Regional<br />
Development put to Queensland officials a timetable which envisaged<br />
firm proposals being put to the Australian Government in October.<br />
" A number of proposals have been received in the past few<br />
weeks but they constitute firm proposals in respect of Enoggera/<br />
Breakfast Creek only."<br />
