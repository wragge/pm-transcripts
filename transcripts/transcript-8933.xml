FOR MEDIA<br />
Attached is a letter I have sent today to the Premier of Queensland, Wayne Goss,<br />
concerning the Wik people's claim.<br />
CANBERRA 12 August, 1993 </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER CANBERRA<br />
The Hon Wayne Goss MILA<br />
Premier<br />
Executive Building 2 AUG 133<br />
100 George Street<br />
BRISBANE QLD 4000<br />
My dear Premier<br />
I refer to your letter of 10 August 1993 concerning the<br />
Wik claim and the Comalco operations at Weipa and<br />
Gladstone. You will know from your own officials that my Government<br />
is treating these issues in a serious and concerted way.<br />
You will be aware that the matter was discussed at our<br />
last Cabinet meeting a fortnight ago and that Cabinet<br />
directed a team of officials to produce a considered<br />
paper on the options available to governments. I thought<br />
you understood this.<br />
That work is on track. There have been several<br />
discussions with Queensland officials to ensure that<br />
Queensland's perspective is taken into account. The door<br />
has remained open to talks on any aspect. I made this<br />
clear in my statements to the media on Sunday.<br />
Consultation remains the s * ensible way to address the<br />
question, rather than any effort to build pressure<br />
through public statements.<br />
You must recognise that the issues involved here are not<br />
simple ones, either as matters of law or policy.<br />
obviously we all favour this important project being able<br />
to proceed with security, Aboriginal people being able to<br />
pursue their rights under the law and a just and<br />
satisfactory outcome.<br />
Equally obviously, these sentiments fall way short of<br />
designing a detailed policy or solution. That is what<br />
needs to be done, and what we are doing. </p>
<p>At this point the Commonwealth has only had communicated<br />
to it vague ideas of what you propose. It would be more<br />
helpful to have from you clearly defined proposals. What<br />
exactly does Queensland wish to legislate? And, given<br />
that, what exactly are you seeking in Commonwealth<br />
legislation? I and my Ministers will be discussing the issues on the<br />
basis of a preliminary paper from officials early next<br />
week. While we are willing to consider appropriate<br />
assistance, it would help us to know what you seek.<br />
Indeed, notwithstanding any remarks made by Commonwealth<br />
Ministers, it is hard to see how we can reach firm<br />
conclusions on the scope of any Commonwealth legislation<br />
without this.<br />
In particular, your letter is ambiguous in relation to<br />
the effect of Commonwealth legislation to provide<br />
certainty with riiitlion to the RDA. You should be aware<br />
that it is one thing for the Commonwealth to legislate to<br />
provide certainty where a Government has actively sought<br />
to act in a non-discriminatory way or acted in innocence<br />
and quite another to provide coverage for discriminatory<br />
action or action which may be found to be in wilful<br />
disregard of particular interests, or actions which may<br />
be found to be fraudulent.<br />
This reinforces the need for us to see your detailed<br />
proposals, and for us to talk the detail through properly<br />
rather than you seeking to publicly force the<br />
Commonwealth into a premature and possibly inadequate or<br />
unjust arrangement.<br />
Again, it would be one thing to legislate to remove any<br />
doubt about leases resulting from the necessary ignorance<br />
by governments and others of the existence of native<br />
title prior to the High Court decision in June 13192;<br />
~ quite another to preclude the right of any Australian to<br />
pursue existing legal remedies on grounds not dependent<br />
on the existence of native title.<br />
You may be sure that I and all Commnonwealth Ministers<br />
have this key distinction very much in mind,<br />
notwithstanding any interpretation that may have suited<br />
you, of the Attorney-General's remarks on the scope of<br />
the legislation. </p>
<p>3.<br />
In short, reassuring generalities are not enough. We<br />
need drafted detailed solutions. This is the process on<br />
which m overnment has embarked, and I can only enjoin<br />
you con inue with us in it.<br />
ours a ceraly<br />
