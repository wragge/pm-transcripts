<p>  LYNEHAM:</p>
<p>  Some republicans are saying you knobbled the referendum, that we didn't</p>
<p>   really get the result that most Australians wanted.</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Paul, I didn't knobble the referendum. The Australian people said no. And</p>
<p>   it's about time all of the participants in this debate accepted that we</p>
<p>   live in a democracy. I mean the referendum lost on Saturday and I think</p>
<p>   the first thing everybody should do is take a deep breath, accept the verdict</p>
<p>   of their fellow Australians. Don't insult them by saying it was lost because</p>
<p>   people didn't understand or they weren't bright enough, or insulting patronising</p>
<p>   observations like that. Australians are very savvy. They had their own reasons</p>
<p>   for voting no.</p>
<p>  LYNEHAM:</p>
<p>  A vote of 55% 'no' and 45% 'yes', obviously shows the community is divided</p>
<p>   on the issue as you would expect. Are there implications though that, in</p>
<p>   that that concern you? I mean some say we're now in a constitutional twilight</p>
<p>   zone.</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Of course there are different views but that's what you have in a democracy.</p>
<p>   But the idea that the country is riven and in deep constitutional crisis</p>
<p>   because of this is nonsense. Look people have different views on it. I've</p>
<p>   got to say there's not been a lot of passion beyond the very committed on</p>
<p>   both sides, not much passion at all.</p>
<p>  LYNEHAM:</p>
<p>  Beyond where the Chardonnay gives way to the VB?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well that is a colourful way of describing it, but the reality is that most</p>
<p>   Australians, even though some of them may favour a republic, are hardly</p>
<p>   arguing that the constitutional system we now have is in crisis. Most people</p>
<p>   acknowledge that it works pretty well, even those who voted yes. And the</p>
<p>   idea that we are deeply divided and a broken nation because of this result</p>
<p>   is just absurd and it insults the intelligence of the democratic process.</p>
<p>  LYNEHAM:</p>
<p>  Kim Beazley says Labor will now go forward as the party of modernity by</p>
<p>   proposing a plebiscite as the first of a three-stage process towards a republic.</p>
<p>   Is that likely to give the ALP a sort of, bit of an edge over the Coalition?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I think the first thing I'd say about that is that isn't it fascinating,</p>
<p>   three-and-a-half years in Opposition, Kim Beazley hasn't got a policy on</p>
<p>   education, health or taxation, but he's already had two policies on the</p>
<p>   republic. I think he's got his priorities wrong and so do most Australians.</p>
<p>   The other observation I'd make is that this is not a party political issue,</p>
<p>   and if you want proof of that have a look at the results on Saturday.</p>
<p>  LYNEHAM:</p>
<p>  So he's wrong when he thinks it's a good opportunity, a political opportunity</p>
<p>   for him, for Labor?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Yeah I do, I do. I think he's missing the point. This is not something that</p>
<p>   in my view is going to swing many votes either way at the next federal election.</p>
<p>   I mean what people have got to understand is that there are some issues</p>
<p>   that are standouts as far as the normal political divide are concerned and</p>
<p>   this is one of them.</p>
<p>  LYNEHAM:</p>
<p>  Now, Cabinet meets in Canberra tomorrow. You'll be discussing how the Government</p>
<p>   will be treating this issue further down the track. I would imagine a fair</p>
<p>   bit behind all the bread and butter issues now.</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  A long way behind as it should be. People will be able to continue to advocate</p>
<p>   a particular approach around the Cabinet table, or within the party room</p>
<p>   or the other councils of the party.</p>
<p>  LYNEHAM:</p>
<p>  But not in interviews like this though?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well the Prime Minister can talk about anything on behalf of the Government.</p>
<p>   That's the privilege of the office.</p>
<p>  LYNEHAM:</p>
<p>  But can Peter Reith come on this program tomorrow night and tell us why</p>
<p>   he thinks a direct election.?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  I don't think you'll be having anybody coming on the program tomorrow night</p>
<p>   Paul on this. I'm not putting a ban on anybody going on any program. I just</p>
<p>   think most people want to give the thing a rest for a while and that particularly</p>
<p>   includes the Australian public. I think they'd had it up to here on the</p>
<p>   republic debate over the last few months, and frankly they'll be telling</p>
<p>   us, all of us, give it a break fellas.</p>
<p>  LYNEHAM:</p>
<p>  Are you tempted now though to rethink your decision to open the Olympic</p>
<p>   Games rather than invite the Queen or have the Governor-General do the job?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well I think there is a reason for that decision, and I think it remains</p>
<p>   a very strong one.</p>
<p>  LYNEHAM:</p>
<p>  Can you remind me of it briefly?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well the reason very simply was that in a country like Australia the Prime</p>
<p>   Minister holds the highest elected office and it seemed to me appropriate</p>
<p>   and justifiable that he should open the Games, and I took that view when</p>
<p>   Mr Keating was the Prime Minister and I wasn't within a bull's roar of the</p>
<p>   Opposition Leadership let alone the Prime Ministership.</p>
<p>  LYNEHAM:</p>
<p>  And it's still your view?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Yes.</p>
<p>  LYNEHAM:</p>
<p>  On the preamble, the poet Les Murray says he now regrets that he ever got</p>
<p>   involved, and he claims that you and others used him.</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well nobody used him. I mean the reality is, and I like Les a lot and I</p>
<p>   like his poetry, but the first draft which was largely Les's work didn't</p>
<p>   go down very well with the public I'm sorry to say, and there was a rewrite.</p>
<p>   But in the end it didn't go down very well either. Now I accept that decision.</p>
<p>  LYNEHAM:</p>
<p>  It didn't go down too well with Les. He says it was turned into mush.</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well I understand that but I mean, this is the problem you have with these</p>
<p>   things but I'm not whingeing and saying it's Les's fault or the voters'</p>
<p>   fault. I accept that they voted no to it. I'm not blaming them or abusing</p>
<p>   them or insulting them because of that decision. I'm accepting that the</p>
<p>   Australian public didn't want that and I'm asking that those people who</p>
<p>   wanted a republic accept the decision that was taken on Saturday in relation</p>
<p>   to that as well and not abuse their fellow Australians or imply that in</p>
<p>   some way they're not intelligent enough to grasp this brilliant proposition.</p>
<p>  LYNEHAM:</p>
<p>  Prime Minister thanks for your time.</p>
