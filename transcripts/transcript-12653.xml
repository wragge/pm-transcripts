<p>E&amp;OE...........  </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Can I say that I';m going to be very sorry, indeed, to lose Lynton Crosby as the Federal Director of the Liberal Party.  He's been an outstanding Federal Director and whilst I';m sorry to see him leave the post I do understand his reasons for wanting to move on.  We have discussed this career move of his on a number of occasions over recent months and it has not come as a surprise to me today.<br />
We have worked together very closely over the past two elections.  His guidance and skill and professionalism has been quite crucial to the Liberal Party's success in 1998 and 2001.  And his departure will end 11 years of service and dedication to the Liberal Party.  He's been a great example of a committed party professional.  He's got a very good political mind and although he's moving on to a new career in business I know that we will retain our friendship and his counsel will always be welcome as far as I am concerned.<br />
I also want to thank his wife, Dawn, and their two children for all that they have done in so many different ways over the past few years.  Lynton, thank you very much for what you've done for me and for the Liberal Party and I wish you well in your future career.<br />
JOURNALIST:<br />
Mr Howard, grand final this weekend, something you're looking forward to.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, it's always a great day, especially an AFL Grand Final in Melbourne, there's something very special about it.  It's one of the great moments on the Australian sporting calendar and I certainly am looking forward to it.  I think it will be a great contest having one of the foundation Melbourne clubs, Collingwood, and one of the newer interstate clubs in Brisbane is a good mix.  I guess there'll be a lot of sentiment running for Collingwood because of its old traditional place in the former VFL and now the AFL.  I think, however, that on form this year Brisbane is going to be very hard to beat.<br />
JOURNALIST:<br />

PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, that's how I'd read it.<br />
