TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON PJ. KEATING MP<br />
JOINT DOORSTOP WITH PRIME MINISTER GOH CHOK TONG, ISTANA. SINGAPORE,<br />
SUNDAY, 6 MARCH 1995<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
GOH: I am delighted to have Paul Keating visit us in Singapore. This is essentially a<br />
continuation of our discussion in Canberra when 1 was there a few months ago.<br />
Today, we reviewed the progress In the implementation of APEC kept our meeting<br />
going, We also explored bilateral relations In particular we agreed that we should set<br />
up a committee of oficials to see how we can maximize our strategic partnership.<br />
Your focus on political, security and economic relations. The committee will be set up<br />
in a few weeks time and to be asked to submit a report to us a blue print of action<br />
in about six months time.<br />
We have also agreed that Singapore should send a tourism mission to Australia to<br />
explore several investment possibilities in either Queensland. Northem Territory or<br />
Western Australia. Essentially again, It Is an idea which we are following up on, we<br />
discussed It In Canberra when we met the last time.<br />
PJK I just re-emphasize the point the Prime Minister made about Osaka, We made very<br />
great progress at Bogor. The importance now Is to keep that momentum going and to<br />
actualty give tangible expression to some of the elements of the Bogor Declaration.<br />
So, I think, he and 1 see this as a great priority and we are happy to say and to know<br />
that It Is going well at this point,<br />
On the bilateral relationship, I think, we see a great future for Australia and Singapore<br />
co-operating in third markets, In countries around the region where we can get<br />
together, that is our skills and our technology and our capital, to do things together<br />
and as the Prime Minister has said, we will now arrange our respective departments<br />
to get together and come up with an action plan within six months to say which<br />
markets we think we should be moving towards and In which sectors.<br />
The Prime Minister's reference to tourism is. I think, the notion that many<br />
Singaporeans are now going to Western Australia and the Northern Territory the<br />
nearest part of Australia, four and a half hours to Perth and there Is, I think, the<br />
opportunity of opening up tourism developments across the north of Australia, that is.<br />
In Western Australia, the Northern Territory and in Queensland. We think we ought to<br />
be exploring the ways in which we can facilitate this and bring pleasure to<br />
Singaporeans end further co-operation between our two countries and, of course, the<br />
people to people contact which Is the underlying fundamentals of any relationship. I<br />
am sure we are both pleased to take questions.<br />
J: Has there been any change to whether there'e to be preferential trade within APEC </p>
<p>TEL: 6. Mar .9S, 9: 54 No. O0i4 F. 02/ 03<br />
PJK: I don't think we think this Is a sort of semi ideological dogmatic thing. The Prime<br />
Minister can speak for himself, but I'm pretty sure Nis view and mine would be Mth~<br />
let$ s get on with the APEC agend$, let's give real expression to the Bogor Declaration<br />
rather than overly worry at this point about whether it is MFN or preferential. Ithink<br />
oaet In this part of the world we would prefer to be dealing as we deal now on a Most<br />
Favourel Nation basis with the rest of the world, but we do want to at the same time<br />
develop APEC as coherent, with a cogency to its plans for freer trade. So. all of the<br />
trade ideoogies of putting their sticky fingers In here, in this one, I think the key thing<br />
is for the organlsational people to get on and make Osaka a success. That ranks<br />
more critically than whetber it is MFN or preferential.<br />
J: IS it disappointing that the Malaysians have Indicated that they don't berieve in APEC<br />
the agreement, the Bogor' Agreement?<br />
PJK: I think the Prima Minister can probably do more justice to that than 1. I mean, his<br />
contacts with Malaysia are more extenstve than mine, but ', he !-oticn of concerted<br />
unilateralism, the notion that we can all head down a path together but not do It In an<br />
overly regulated way Is, I think, the way forward anc; President Soeliarto's concept of<br />
the flexible consensus Is, I think, the appropriate one. That plus a concerted.<br />
unilateralist approach will not only take care of any concerns Malaysia has, but<br />
anybody else. 0o you think so, Primes Minister?<br />
GOH: Yes.<br />
J: Mr Keating, is there going to be an election in Australia this year?<br />
PJK: We have to have an election oy about March 1996 and generally we have elections<br />
when we have to have them.<br />
J: Prime Minister, what level would you like to set this committee b; eing set up?<br />
GOti. This is to be set up at the departmental secretary level the departrents of Foreign<br />
Affairs and perhaps other ministries.<br />
J, I wonder it boll of you could make any comment on the Sairings situation. Prime<br />
Minister Goh in a sense of whether you are satisfied that Singapore has done enough<br />
In the regulatory area and Prime minister Keating whether this raises any concerns<br />
about yovr own markets.<br />
GOH: No, I think looking at the reports from the investigation we felt that we have done very<br />
well. The authority has regulated the transactions, they knew what was coming, they<br />
forewarned the people involved, the mid margin calls paid up and as you have read<br />
in the paper's today it Is essentially an internal problem of the Barings group -a lack of<br />
control over ohat. As far as the market is Concerned there has been no impact The<br />
stock market IS up, SIMEX Is trading and there has been rio losses for Singapore.<br />
J: Prime Minister, coming to defence, what Is your assessment about relations with<br />
Australia as far as defence concerned, what more do you think can we have?<br />
GOH: Well, excellent relations. We are very thankful that AUStralia has given Singapore<br />
space, As you know we need space to train our airforce, we need space for the army<br />
and we haven't got a space in Singapore, Australia has the space and is kind enough<br />
to offer that space to Singapore. That Is because, essentially, both countries see a<br />
coincidence of Interest over the long term, we share strategic Interests In the area.<br />
So, Australia has been very helpful and we are very grateful for that<br />
J: To follow on up that question, was there any discussion of the recent events In trie<br />
Spratleys, signs of some confrontation there? </p>
<p>TEL: 6. la r. 54i~ N o. 0 C4 P. 0 31,<br />
3<br />
GON: No, we didn't discuss that.<br />
J: Mr Keating, will there beea hike In interest rates in Australia..<br />
P. JK: Do you work for the financial market do you? Knight-Ridder7 In Australia we have<br />
been growing at around 5.5 to 8 per cent and we think there is now some natural<br />
slowing In the economy and that the monetary adjustments that Australia has made<br />
have produced perhaps a reward on demand even greater than the actal mechanicai<br />
impact of the measures, that is. with substantial announcement efferts. So, we are<br />
now waiting to see* just how our national accounts are looking as we get more partial<br />
data In.<br />
JMr Keating, back " o~ e thiS morning Senator Aiston has accused you of running an<br />
anti Packer vendetta since he appeared or, Channel Nine and endorsed Howard, do<br />
you have any comment. 3?<br />
PJK: Only to make the obvious comments that they are crawling to Kerry Packer. Not a<br />
good strategy for anybody I wouldn't recommend.<br />
J: They are denying any deal with Packer.<br />
PJK; Of course they will, but they have signed up. I mean, work out who Is the Packer<br />
candidate the mani who walks in and says he will remove the cross media rules or<br />
th~ e man who sayi he won't?<br />
J: So, you stiii think there is a deal with<br />
PJK:. Absolutely.<br />
4: Mt Keating, on one other subject, could you describe your feellh'gs at the cemetery<br />
this morning and your impressionl<br />
PJK. I think I am always perpetually mindful of the reality of the commitment of Australian<br />
men and women to the defence of Australia end to the defence of democratic values<br />
and states such as Singapore during the Second World War. We have been<br />
reminded of this because of the 50th anniversary of the Fall of Singapore in 1942.<br />
being in 1992, and then In various other parts of the regions through 11993. 1994 and<br />
1995. This year with Victory In the Pacift. I invariably take the opportunity to visit the<br />
graves of Australian service men ond womnen and I was particularly struck today that<br />
the Secretary of my DepartmTent his father is buried here and there was on the roill<br />
two other Keatings, from Tasmania and my uncle was captured here and, of course,<br />
died on the death March betweem Sandakan and Ranau. Sc, there Is a poignancy<br />
and remarkably, In a sense, but probably not remarkably that in a visit to the Prime<br />
Minister and speaking two of us here have lost relatives in the defence of Slngap~ s.<br />
I think that speaks volumes about this ori-going relationship and the defence<br />
relationlship in the fact that we will not 1orget. It is Important that we remember, and be<br />
seen to remember, and it Is Important that the relatives of those who were lost here,<br />
relatives In Australia of those who were lost here, know that it was not In vain and that<br />
they are riot forgotten.<br />
