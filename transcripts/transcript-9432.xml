TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P. J. KEATING MP<br />
DOORSTOP, EPAC NATIONAL STRATEGIES CONFERENCE,<br />
CONVENTION CENTRE, SYDNEY, 25 NOVEMBER 1994<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
J: Jeff Kennett has been fairly scathing of your so-called intervention<br />
tactics. Do you have any response to those comments?<br />
PM: Well, I think, when the Premiers get together the herd instinct takes<br />
over they are braver together than they are individually. The fact of<br />
the matter is, that there is a sort of immature view that the<br />
Commonwealth should pay for everything the States do including<br />
improving the efficiency of their public sectors. Now, the fact is, it is a<br />
matter of record that at the Hobart meeting and at the Darwin meeting,<br />
the States dragged the chain on competition policy. We kept it alive<br />
on both occasions and, largely, different people at different meetings,<br />
bludged on the endeavour and they are still at it. So, no noise from Mr<br />
Kennett is going to disguise the fact that at the Darwin meeting he<br />
lushed out on competition policy. At the first meeting in Tasmania, it<br />
was Mr Fahey and Mr Brown. Mr Brown also did the same number in<br />
Darwin. So, we will see what happens in the February meeting.<br />
J: Aren't you getting a little bit sick of the States. I mean, would you like<br />
to really get rid of them?<br />
PM: No, I think there this a role for the States -a good and a strong one<br />
but, there is also a role for the national economy. There has to be a<br />
national policy on competition and no amount of wriggling and twisting<br />
and turning and claims for money will remove that sensible demand.<br />
J: If the States don't co-operate how do you go about circumventing their<br />
PM: I said that last night and in the general application of trade practices<br />
legislation we would do it ourselves. </p>
<p>J: Why would he be blaming the Federal Government for the economic<br />
PM: Well, why wouldn't they. That is part of the standard stock in trade of<br />
Premiers most days. But, we have got the economy growing at around<br />
per cent, we have got an inflation rate under 2 per cent, we have got<br />
one of the strongest public sector balance sheets in the world. I mean,<br />
if there is any problem around the place, it is the fact that we have got<br />
these very large state instrumentalities which are not behaving under<br />
sensible competitive rules.<br />
J: Doesn't it just hold things up though when the States want to keep<br />
attacking the Federals and it just turns into<br />
PM: You are not a coverer of Premiers Conferences are you, you are a<br />
cheerful person. Well, you should come to one and see what it's all<br />
like.<br />
