CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
AUSTRALIA'S CONTINGENT TO NAMIBIA<br />
HOLSWORTHY 5 APRIL 1989<br />
Next week you will be in Namibia a country taking, with<br />
your help, its first steps towards independence. As members<br />
of 17 Construction Squadron, you will be joining the advance<br />
contingent of 94 Australians already in Namibia.<br />
Southern Africa has been a focus of instability and conflict<br />
for many years. It has been and remains a region that bears<br />
the burdens of civil war, poverty, and the obscenity of<br />
apartheid. One of the oldest disputes in this region<br />
indeed one that finds its very origins in the settlement of<br />
the First World War has been the question of independence<br />
for Namibia. It is this matter that now stands on the<br />
threshold of resolution under the guidance of the United<br />
Nations. As members of the United Nations Transition Assistance Group<br />
( UNTAG) you will be making an important contribution to<br />
transforming Namibia from a war zone to a peace zone, from a<br />
colony to a sovereign state.<br />
UNTAG's mission is to monitor the ceasfire and troop<br />
withdrawals, to preserve law and order in Namibia and to<br />
supervise elections for the new Government of Namibia.<br />
This will not be an easy process. Since the Transition<br />
Period in Namibia began on 1 April, there have already been<br />
serious clashes between members of SWAPO on one hand and<br />
elements of the Namibian police and the South African<br />
Defence Forces on the other.<br />
The clashes have been serious and bloody. More than two<br />
hundred people have been killed. The situation is still<br />
tense and serious.<br />
The Australian Government is concerned at the breakdown of<br />
the ceasefire at this delicate and early stage of the<br />
Transition Period.<br />
It is particularly regrettable that these clashes have<br />
occurred at a time when the UN does not have its three<br />
infantry battalions deployed, and does not have sufficient<br />
personnel in place to monitor all aspects of the transition<br />
arrangements. 1 </p>
<p>But all of this only highlights the importance and<br />
sensitivity of your task. As members of the military<br />
component of UNTAG, you will have to work hard to keep the<br />
UN plan on track. We are under no illusions about the risks<br />
and dangers of your task.<br />
From your base in Grootfontein in Northern Namibia, you will<br />
provide important engineering and construction support to<br />
the UN effort. Such support will be sorely needed. Namibia<br />
is a large, arid, sparsely-populated and underdeveloped<br />
country, wracked for years by the destruction of war. You<br />
will have to build roads, bridges, airstrips and camps for<br />
UNTAG. You will also have the dangerous task of clearing<br />
mines which have been laid by the various contending forces<br />
along the border between Angola and Namibia.<br />
In performing these tasks, you will be continuing the proud<br />
tradition established by the Australian Defence Forces in<br />
similar difficult circumstances in the past. Australians<br />
have served with honour and distinction in UN Peacekeeping<br />
Forces in Asia, Europe, the Indian sub-continent and in the<br />
middle East. In Africa, we participated in the Commonwealth<br />
force that monitored Zimbabwe's transition to independence<br />
in 1980.<br />
Your involvement in the UNTAG process will see you<br />
contributing to what may be one of the United Nations, most<br />
substantial achievement for many years. Certainly, you and<br />
the advance members of your party already in Namibia<br />
represent the largest contribution to a peacekeeping force<br />
that Australia has ever made.<br />
I note with gratitude that the opposition parties in Federal<br />
Parliament, represented here today by the Leader of the<br />
Opposition, have expressed their full support for the<br />
decision to despatch this force.<br />
The Government has taken special measures to provide you<br />
with a comprehensive and generous set of conditions of<br />
service, including the payment of special allowances and tax<br />
exemptions, in recognition of your difficult task. It is<br />
some compensation at least to you and your families for the<br />
burden of separation that you will bear while deployed in<br />
Namibia. The eyes of the world will be on you. The thoughts and the<br />
best wishes of all Australians will be with you.<br />
As Prime Minister I express my deepest hopes for your<br />
success on your six month tour of duty and for your safe<br />
return. I do so in the knowledge that you will make an<br />
outstanding contribution to the future peace and prosperity<br />
of an independent Namibian people. I do so in the knowledge<br />
that you will do all Australians proud. </p>
