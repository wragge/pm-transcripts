COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA.<br />
SPEECH B3Y<br />
Rt. Hon. R. G. MENZIES, Q. C.,<br />
ON<br />
BUDGET 1959-60.<br />
[ Fromn the Parliamentary Debates," 20th August, 1959.]<br />
Mr. MENZIES ( Kooyong-Prime Minister)<br />
[ 8.01.-Mr. Chairman, the Budget<br />
speech delivered by my colleague the Treasurer<br />
( Mr. Harold Holt) emphasized at the<br />
beginning and throughout and at the end<br />
that the twin purposes of this statement of<br />
financial policy for the year were expansion<br />
and stability. I want to repeat that<br />
expression-expansion and stability-because<br />
it seems to me that unless it is borne<br />
in mind a great deal of the significance<br />
of this Budget may be unseen.<br />
Let me take the words in their reverse<br />
order. The purpose of stability is to avoid<br />
inflation and so ensure an adequate volume<br />
of investment in government securities-a<br />
type of investment that is not attractive if<br />
inflation is on-and of capital investments<br />
from overseas, which I rather gathered this<br />
afternoon is not very well regarded by<br />
some honorable members on the other side<br />
of the chamber but which is admirably<br />
regarded by people in this country. Not<br />
only is the purpose of stability the doing<br />
of those things; its great function is to<br />
preserve the value of money internally, because<br />
the preservation of the value 01<br />
money, that is to say the value of wages,<br />
salaries and income of all kinds, is essential<br />
for-social justice ' and also clearly essential<br />
for a spirit -of -confidence in the country.<br />
7341/ 39. Recently, Sir, when I was in France I<br />
had an opportunity to have a discussion<br />
with Monsieur Rueff, who had prepared a<br />
report for the French Government upon<br />
French financial and economic reconstruction.<br />
The report of his committee was<br />
adopted by the Minister for Finance and<br />
the President of France. Those recommendations<br />
have been put into operation,<br />
and the financial and economic recovery<br />
of France in the last eighteen months has<br />
been most remarkable. If any one has an<br />
opportunity to read that report, he will<br />
find that at its very centre is the whole<br />
idea of stability. France had been suffering<br />
grievously from runaway inflation, unrestrained<br />
and incapable of being checked<br />
because of political instability. Within the<br />
last eighteen months, as I have indicated,<br />
the recommendations made by this committee<br />
have been put in hand. Those responsible<br />
have set about arresting inflation,<br />
and the result has been quite phenomenal.<br />
Inflation, although it has not been unrestrained,<br />
although it has come under a<br />
very remarkable degree of restraint in Australia<br />
in the last few years, remains a constant<br />
danger as long -as increased production<br />
does not cope with increased costs.<br />
I should just like to say, apropos of -this,<br />
that in the welter -of comnments -and -criti-</p>
<p>2<br />
cisms about the present Budget I found<br />
the very thoughtful speech of the honorable<br />
member for Richmond ( Mr. Anthony)<br />
very refreshing, because he directed his<br />
mind to this great central problem of inflation.<br />
I shall say a little more about it,<br />
because what has troubled him has<br />
troubled my colleagues and myself in the<br />
course of preparing the Budget. But in<br />
that speech there was a genuine and perceptive<br />
observation on the Budget. All<br />
these other observations that I shall deal<br />
with in a moment completely missed the<br />
point, the point being that stability is<br />
essential to expansion and that stability<br />
and expansion are the keynotes of the<br />
financial policy of this Government.<br />
It is quite clear, Sir, that some honorable<br />
members may have overlooked the fact<br />
that expansion is not the product, of inflation.<br />
Inflation is its enemy. Its achievement<br />
depends upon creating and maintaining<br />
a spirit of optimism and confidence in<br />
Australia's future, and upon guarding<br />
against an excessive optimism which may<br />
regard with contempt the menace of rising<br />
costs, particularly in respect of actual or<br />
prospective export markets. I say that<br />
because I want to lay a foundation for the<br />
approach of the Government to this matter.<br />
These observations I have made have never<br />
for one moment been absent from the mind<br />
of the Treasurer or the minds of those<br />
who sat with him in the preparation of this<br />
Budget. Now I turn for a moment to the Opposition.<br />
Members of the Opposition, of<br />
course, have secured almost prescriptive<br />
rights over a long term of years to professional<br />
gloom. This gloom, valiantly<br />
maintained frequently under very difficult<br />
circumstances, has endured right through<br />
the most remarkable period of expansion<br />
in Australian history-a period that has<br />
been marked not by disaster of the kind<br />
prophesied by the Opposition but by a<br />
record investment in this country from<br />
overseas, an investment not made by fools<br />
but by shrewd people who like to see a<br />
country with a future and stability. That<br />
period has been marked also by high levels<br />
of employment, rising real wages, a phenomenal<br />
increase in the amfenities of life, a<br />
remarkable expansion of productivity in<br />
basic and secondary industries, high solvenicy<br />
in primary industries, and under and supporting it all a record expansion of<br />
vital developmental public works and a<br />
corresponding industrial expansion.<br />
I pause there, Mr. Chairman, to. emphasize<br />
this point: There are those who<br />
rather choose to divide the volume of<br />
investment in the country into investment<br />
on public account and investment on<br />
private account. In our country and in<br />
this age there can be no such artificial<br />
division, because without great public<br />
works for the development of power,. water<br />
supply and transport there could not be<br />
the private expansion, the investment of<br />
private capital, that we have seen going<br />
on over the last ten years. The two things,<br />
to coin a phrase, go hand in hand.<br />
The Leader of the Opposition ( Dr.<br />
Evatt) overlooks the fact-it was not overlooked<br />
by my young friend from Richmond<br />
-that we are budgeting for a substantial<br />
deficit, a deficit of œ 60,000,000, at a time<br />
when the state of the economy is in no<br />
great need, as we thought a year ago it<br />
may be, of some special stimulus. From<br />
the viewpoint of pure national economics,<br />
and even though the Leader of the Opposition<br />
has said the dead opposite, there was<br />
much to be said for a cash balanced<br />
Budget. Under these circumstances I think I<br />
ought to occupy a few minutes by pointing<br />
out to the committee why we did -not go<br />
for a cash balanced Budget on this occasion<br />
-why we accepted a deficit. I will state<br />
the major reasons. In the first place, to<br />
balance the Budget, to bring out a dead<br />
balance on this occasion, we would have<br />
had to make no increase whatever in social<br />
services or repatriation benefits and no tax<br />
reductions of any kind, but, on the contrary,<br />
if honorable members will examine<br />
the figures, probably some increase in taxes.<br />
Mr. Ward.-The Government could<br />
have taken something out of excess profits.<br />
Mr. MENZIES.-My friend always has<br />
some wonderful scheme for taxing profits;<br />
but it is a tax.<br />
Mr. Ward.-You promised an excess<br />
profits tax in 1950.<br />
. The CHAIRMAN.-Orderl The honor-<br />
Able member must remain silent.<br />
Mr. MENZIES.-That would seem most<br />
improbable. I wonder how many honorable<br />
members would have been content, or </p>
<p>how many people in Australia would have<br />
been content, with a Budget this year in<br />
which there were no increases whatever in<br />
social services or repatriation benefits, and<br />
no tax reductions of any kind but, as I have<br />
said, quite probably some increases in tax.<br />
That is a very powerful consideration for<br />
a Government to take into account.<br />
The second thing I want to say is that<br />
every Budget deficit must be considered<br />
in relation to the total volume of the Budget.<br />
If, before the war, when the total Commonwealth<br />
Budget was below œ 100,000,000,<br />
until 1939, when I myself introduced the<br />
first œ 100,000,000 Budget, anybody then had<br />
said Let us have a deficit of œ 60,000,000,<br />
this would have been regarded as sheerly<br />
ruinous finance. But to-day with a Budget<br />
which moves around the vicinity of<br />
œ 1,600,000,000 in this country, œ 60,000,000<br />
must be looked at in proportion and atlso<br />
looked at in proportion to the total national<br />
earnings, the total national income.<br />
The third thing is that the heavy increase<br />
in the basic wage-and there was<br />
quite a substantial increase in it only recently-<br />
in our opinion made it proper to<br />
add substantially to the social service and<br />
repatriation payments which will, in the<br />
result, this year rise by œ 21,000,000. We<br />
could not do that and, at the same time,<br />
budget for a cash balance.<br />
Finally-and I think this is legitimate<br />
consideration-the willing acceptance of the<br />
Australian public, who have co-operated<br />
and behaved so magnificently in these years,<br />
and the willing acceptance by the public<br />
of past measures and their marked success<br />
as a result of public co-operation, deserved,<br />
in our opinion, some recognition in the<br />
taxation field and therefore we have<br />
given it.<br />
Mr. Ward.--You have given 9d. a week<br />
to the basic wage earner.<br />
The CHAIRMAN.-Orderl The right<br />
honorable the Prime Minister is speaking.<br />
Mr. MENZIES.-You could not be more<br />
right, Sir, and with your very kind permission<br />
I will continue. It is interesting<br />
that I should continue because I just want<br />
to make this point that when the Budget<br />
is disclosed to the committee-the Budget<br />
of the entire Government, delivered by the<br />
Treasurer--one looks to the Leader of Her<br />
Majesty's Opposition ( Dr. Evatt) to deliver a pungent and pointed attack on it. Therefore,<br />
as the Leader of the Government, I<br />
think I owe the right honorable gentleman<br />
the courtesy of having a glance at the<br />
attack, if I may so describe it, which he<br />
made on this Budget. I will begin by quoting<br />
one of his expressions. It is inimitable,<br />
but I quote it. He said--<br />
This process of slugging the great bulk of<br />
taxpayers has been going on cvery year continuously<br />
since 1950-51.<br />
Mr. Ward.-Hear, hear!<br />
Mr. MENZES.-On one occasion at<br />
any rate, the Leader of the Opposition has<br />
support on his own side. Having delivered<br />
hinlself of this trenchant expression, he then<br />
went on to say-<br />
The single man with average earnings paid<br />
Is. 9d. in the œ 1 income tax in 1950-51<br />
He now pays 2s. 4d. in the œ 1 and the Treasurer<br />
proposes to reduce this to 2s. 2id.<br />
Mr. Chairman, that statement is, of course,<br />
grossly misleading and-unless I were to<br />
accuse the right honorable gentleman of<br />
inadvertence, which I would not dream of<br />
doing-deliberately misleading, and I will<br />
show how. Anybody listening in the other<br />
night-if anybody ever listens in to these<br />
lucubrations of ours-must have been<br />
struck by the statement that here was a man<br />
with a small income who must pay more<br />
tax and yet, so the Leader of the Opposition<br />
declared, this wretched Government says<br />
it is reducing the tax. Therefore, I point<br />
out this simple but cogent fact: In 1950,<br />
average wages were œ 575 a year; in 1959<br />
they are œ 1,040.<br />
Mr. Ward.-Inflation has run riot, that is<br />
all it is.<br />
Mr. MENZIES.-AII right; do not dig<br />
yourself a trap too soon. The first point<br />
I want to make is that the right honorable<br />
gentleman compares the rate of tax as if<br />
the income had stood still. Now that, of<br />
course, is a grossly misleading proposition<br />
to put to the people. I will further illustrate<br />
the truth by reference to the case selected<br />
by the right honorable gentleman of the<br />
single man earning average wages. In<br />
1950-51, he earned œ 575 and his income<br />
tax was œ 47 14s. or, as the right honorable<br />
gentleman said, Is. 9d. in the His net<br />
income after tax was deducted was therefore<br />
œ 527 6s. a year. To-day he earns<br />
œ 1,040 but under this Budget he will pay </p>
<p>œ 109 3s. tax or 2s. Id. in the His net<br />
income therefore, after tax is deducted, wvill<br />
be not œ 527 but œ 930.<br />
Mr. Griffiths.-Now express it in<br />
terms-~ Mr. MIENZLES.-1 know that honorable<br />
members opposite are upset and terrified to<br />
hear a plain statement on these matters.<br />
1 do not mind; the dog barks but the<br />
caravan moves on. The right honorable<br />
gentleman or his faithful myrmidons cannot<br />
escape by saying that increased average<br />
wages merely reflect changes in the cost of<br />
living. The basic wage, by reason of several<br />
decisions, has now risen to 16 per cent.<br />
more than the change in the C series index<br />
would produce while the rise in average<br />
wages, as everybody knows, further<br />
reflects the competition over a period of<br />
years for available labour.<br />
Mr. Ward.-What are you quoting, the<br />
Richardson report?<br />
Mr. MENZIES.-I am quoting myself.<br />
Am I to be told that the noisy gentleman<br />
who interjected has refused the salary<br />
recommended by the Richardson committee?<br />
What humbug!<br />
Mr. Ward.-At least I do not get œ 15<br />
a day expenses, free of tax.<br />
The CHAIRMAN.--Orderl The honorable<br />
member for East Sydney has not got<br />
the floor.<br />
Mr. MENZIES.-He has not recovered<br />
from the rebuke he received this morning.<br />
Then the Leader of the Opposition says that<br />
our taxation changes are made to favour<br />
the rich.<br />
Mr. Ward.-Hear, hear!<br />
Mr. Clay.-Hear, hear!<br />
Mr. MENZIES.-I knew that two of you<br />
would say that. The charge made by the<br />
Leader of the Opposition is, as usual, easily<br />
answered. The last Labour Government,<br />
which was enriched by the presence of the<br />
honorable member for East Sydney, among<br />
others, produced its last Budget for the<br />
1949-50 year. I take again the example<br />
selected by the Leader of the Opposition,<br />
the person without dependants, in order to<br />
make-a comparison. That Budget provided<br />
rates of income tax affecting all ranges of<br />
income, and presumably expressed the<br />
Labour Government's view of a proper<br />
graduation of the tax. This is a reasonable assumption, I think, that one ought to be<br />
able to make. Our 1959-60 Budget-the<br />
one before us-lays down rates of tax<br />
which represent a reduction, compared<br />
with Labour's rates, of more than 60 per<br />
cent. at the bottom of the scale-that is on<br />
the lower incomes-ranging down to 19 per<br />
cent, at the top of the scale,. on the highest<br />
incomes. And this Budget, it should be<br />
remembered, is presented by a Government<br />
which is accused of slugging the poor. I<br />
hope honorable members will follow my<br />
point. In fact, I think I might repeat it.<br />
Mr. Ward.-I neither follow it nor<br />
believe it.<br />
Mr. MENZIES.-I would not expect you<br />
follow it, and the rest of your remark is,*<br />
therefore, irrelevant. If you do not follow<br />
it, how can you either believe it or disbelieve<br />
it? Our 1959-60 Budget, I repeat,<br />
lays down rates of taxation which repre-,<br />
sent a percentage reduction on the rates<br />
provided by the Labour Government when'<br />
it was last in office of 60 per cent. on the<br />
lowest taxable income, tapering down to 19<br />
per cent. on -the highest incomes.<br />
Mr. Ward.-That is a lot of rubbish!<br />
The CHAERMAN.-Order! I will not<br />
warn the honorable member for East<br />
Sydney again. If he interrupts again, I will<br />
name him.<br />
Mr. MENZIIES.-These are simple facts<br />
that are worth pondering on. They promote<br />
a question in one's mind. Does Labour<br />
propose-because if so we ought to knowthat<br />
whenever income tax is reduced the<br />
steepness of an already steep scale should<br />
be violently increased at the cost of middle<br />
incomes and higher incomes? If so, then<br />
let us be clear that savings and investment<br />
will be impaired, and the means of future<br />
employment will therefore be lessened.<br />
We certainly have not been unfair to the<br />
lower income earner. . Let me . put it in<br />
another way, so that he who interjects may<br />
read later on. In 1949-50, when Labouwas<br />
in office, again taking the case of the<br />
person without dependants whom I have<br />
been discussing, the tax payable on a taxable<br />
income of œ 5,000 was fifteen times as much<br />
as that payable on an income, of ; 1,000.<br />
This was under a Labour administration, an<br />
administration which, by its own profession,<br />
did not slug the poor or pander to the rich. </p>
<p>In the considered judgment of the Labour<br />
Government, fifteen times as much tax ought<br />
to be paid on œ 5,000 as on œ 1,000. In this<br />
Budget, so. much reviled by Labour, the tax<br />
on œ 5,000, for the same person, is not fifteen<br />
times as much as on œ 1,000; it is, in fact.<br />
sixteen times as much-and this Budget is<br />
presented by a Treasurer who panders to tht<br />
well-to-dol<br />
Mr. Pollard.-lt must have been a<br />
mistake. Mr. MENZIES.-Now, Reggie, don't<br />
start giggling, because it creates the wrong<br />
impression. Taking the case of a person<br />
with a dependent wife and two children, the<br />
tax on œ 5,000, under Labour, was 21<br />
times as much as the tax on œ 1,000;<br />
in this Budget it is 29 times as<br />
much. Yet these people with imperfect<br />
memories have the nerve to come along and<br />
attack this Budget as if we were paying<br />
off these mythical rich supporters of ours.<br />
Now I turn to another topic-the loan<br />
market. I am interested in this topic, because<br />
the Leader of the Opposition made a<br />
powerful speech about it before the last<br />
election. He had some strong views on<br />
it. I thought they were rather fanciful,<br />
but still they were strong. One thing that<br />
will strike the informed observer on public<br />
finance is. that but for a dramatic improvement<br />
in the loan market, last year's deficit,<br />
which ended up at about œ 30,000,000.<br />
would have been much greater, and ; t<br />
would have been difficult to provide any<br />
concessions in this Budget. Is the right<br />
honorable gentleman pleased about the fact<br />
that the loan market yielded over<br />
œ 200,000,000 for the first time in modern<br />
history? Of course he is not, because only<br />
last year his great story to the Australian<br />
people was that we were ruining the bond<br />
market, and he propounded some rather<br />
fanciful means of dealing with the situation.<br />
Now, the bond market being so healthy, he<br />
turns back to treasury-bills, those wondetful<br />
things,. those I 0 U's, those promissory<br />
notes, as the proper source of finance for<br />
his projected. vastly increased payments out<br />
of the Treasury.<br />
Let'me remind honorable members, let<br />
me remind everybody, if possible, that the<br />
right honorable gentleman has attacked<br />
every proposal in this Budget for improving<br />
the revenues. I think that is right, is it not? He has, I repeat, attacked every proposal<br />
for improving the revenues. He has<br />
demanded increases of many millions of<br />
pounds in payments out. He has, I think.<br />
though I would not be dogmatic on the<br />
point, advocated bigger and better reductions<br />
of tax. To meet this remarkable combination<br />
of financial proposals, he is for<br />
inflationary finance, naked and unashamed.<br />
To support this ruinous policy, to justify<br />
his recourse to treasury-bills, the direct<br />
creation of funds by the Reserve Bank,<br />
what does he say? He harks back to the<br />
war, about the financing of which he ventures<br />
some very quaint ideas. He said<br />
this-Treasury-bills were the instrument whereby to a<br />
very large extent Australia's war effort was conducted.<br />
Without the treasury-bill system the<br />
nation would have been ruined by excessive interest<br />
rates Honorable members will recall that he drew<br />
a charming comparison between 1 per cent.<br />
on a treasury-bill and 41 per cent. or 5 per<br />
cent. on some other security, and pointed<br />
out bow much money we were losing, how<br />
much money we were giving away. Therefore,<br />
I take it that his doctrine on this<br />
matter, which so profoundly affects this<br />
country, is that you pay less interest on<br />
treasury-bills than on bonds and therefore<br />
you should finance by treasury-bill. This<br />
has a noble simplicity about it. To what<br />
extent he is going to do it, he does not say,<br />
though he is, if I may say so, clearly in a<br />
rather carefree mood on that topic.<br />
. Well, Sir, 1 will make three comments.<br />
The first is in relation to Commonwealth<br />
cash and conversion loans raised from the<br />
public, and many of us can remember standing<br />
on street corners and in other places<br />
advocating these loans-very properly. I<br />
myself even made a speech at the Melbourne<br />
Zoo and for the first time had interjections<br />
made to me by a real, live lion.<br />
Mr. Ward.-Is that the loan that failed?<br />
Mr. MENZIES.-They all succeeded. I<br />
thought that that was your proudest boast.<br />
Mr. Ward.-Not the one that you<br />
supported. Mr. MENZIES.-I supported them all,<br />
and they could not all have failed, because<br />
Commonwealth cash and conversion loans<br />
raised from the public during the war<br />
amounted to œ 1,058,000,000. We know<br />
that because, naturally, they have been </p>
<p>maturing very heavily since 1956-57. As<br />
have had occasion to say before, this<br />
country is still called upon to pay for the<br />
war, which is something that is occasionally<br />
overlooked. But there it was. The loan<br />
raisings in that period were œ 1,058,000,000.<br />
Treasury-bills were extensively used, as they<br />
always are, in advance of revenue and<br />
market borrowing, but the outstanding<br />
treasury-bills at the end of each financial<br />
year during the war increased, on the<br />
average, by about œ 70,000,000, or a total<br />
for the war period of œ 343,000,000, as compared<br />
with œ 1,058,000,000 from the loan<br />
market. If those figures are compared, honorable<br />
members will see at once that the overwhelming<br />
bulk of the moneys raised by<br />
borrowing during the war were raised from<br />
the market on the ordinary terms of a public<br />
loan issue. Of course, on top of that-as<br />
everybody will agree and nobody will complain<br />
or did complain-taxation reached<br />
astronomical heights. There was all-round<br />
rationing and investment was controlled so<br />
as to assist bond issues, and there was conscription<br />
of labour, of course. That doe.<br />
not seem to support the idea that treasuryhills<br />
represent the be-all and end-all of<br />
public finance. As I had some recollection<br />
in my mind of the views of the predecessor<br />
of the Leader of the Labour Party on that<br />
matter, and as the right honorable gentleman<br />
is very addicted to quoting the late<br />
Mr. Chifley, I might take the opportunity of<br />
stating his views, as he put them to the<br />
House. Mr. Polard.-Which you ridiculed at the<br />
time. Mr. MENZIES.-On the contrary. Do<br />
not start saying things like that.<br />
Mr. Pollard.-You complained about<br />
every increase in taxation during the war.<br />
Mr. MENZIES.-You know perfectly<br />
well that on the use of treasury-bills, as on<br />
taxation, I gave the late Mr. Chifley my<br />
warmest support.<br />
Mr. Ward.-Only after he was dead.<br />
Mr. MENZIES.-Ahl You know, you<br />
can say that, but anybody who reads Hansard<br />
"-and I suppose some melancholy<br />
creature will, some day-will know how<br />
right I am in what I have been saying, and<br />
there are honorable members here who<br />
know that that is the truth. Mr. Ward.-I was here.<br />
Mr. MENZIES.-But I said honorable<br />
members Now, Sir, all I want to say is<br />
that the late Mr. Chifley did not share the<br />
theory of the present Leader of the Opposition,<br />
because, on 17th June, 1948, having<br />
had a question put to him, not from my<br />
side of the House. but from his own, he<br />
said this-<br />
From time to time, loans are raised by the<br />
Loan Council on behalf of the Australian and<br />
State Governments. In August, the Loan Council<br />
will prepare its programme for the coming financial<br />
year. Surplus moneys, which may be available,<br />
are used to redeem treasury-bills which are really<br />
IOU's. When a loan has been over-subscribed<br />
and the money is being retained for use at a later<br />
date, the Commonwealth uses it to redeem<br />
treasury-bills, and the Commonwealth Bank has<br />
not then so many of them outstanding against<br />
the Government. In my opinion, that is the<br />
proper method of financing government. Whether<br />
in war or peace, it is not sound finance never<br />
to redeem treasury-bills.<br />
That was the view of a man so frequently<br />
quoted, but his successor has made a speech,<br />
or has read to this committee a speechwhoever<br />
composed it, I do not knowthe<br />
whole essence of which was: Why do<br />
you bother about loan issues? Why do you<br />
bother about paying these rates of interest<br />
that you ought to pay on public borrowing,<br />
when you can get it all cheaply from the<br />
Commonwealth Bank? I leave that topic.<br />
Opposition members may squirm and<br />
mutter and do whatever they like about<br />
it, but there it is. I have great faith in the<br />
good sense of the people of this country<br />
to pass their judgment.<br />
I turn from that, because time marches<br />
on, to say something about medical health<br />
and medicine. The right honorable gentleman,<br />
I thought, was * a little vague on that<br />
topic, and he well might ' be. I just want<br />
to say something about this Government<br />
that has no sympathy with -people. Our<br />
record is clear. We have proved our goodwill<br />
by action. We are now entitled to<br />
take steps to bring our schemes under<br />
reasonable financial control and prevent<br />
obvious abuses. In the last full financial<br />
year of the Labour Government, what did<br />
it provide? Professing that its heart bleeds<br />
for people in need or in illness, what did<br />
it do? It provided œ 5,885,000 for hospital<br />
benefits. It provided nothing for<br />
medical benefits, nothing for any pensioner<br />
medical service, œ 149,000 for pharmaceutical<br />
benefits, and œ 151,000 in </p>
<p>lespect of tuberculosis. That adds up, as<br />
you will see, to a substantial sum, but now<br />
let me go on.<br />
In the latest full financial year of this<br />
Government that is supposed to have no<br />
appreciaiion of social needs, we have provided<br />
œ 14,800,000 for hospital bencfits,<br />
œ 7,679,000 for medical benefits,<br />
œ 3,806,000-for the pensioner medical service,<br />
œ 20,972,000 for pharmaceutical benefits,<br />
and œ 7,261,000 for the great tuberculosis<br />
campaign. I shall put it in another<br />
way. In the last three years in office of<br />
these lovers of the distressed, they managed<br />
to find œ 15,000,000-taking it to the<br />
nearest million pounds-under all these<br />
heads. In our latest three years-not our<br />
-last three years, but our latest three years<br />
-we have provided not œ 15,000,000 but<br />
œ 142,000,000. Sir, I do not need to say<br />
any more on that topic. These figures are<br />
more eloquent than any words of mine<br />
Ncould be.<br />
I now turn to the Post Office. The<br />
Leader of the Opposition attacked increased<br />
postal charges as a measure of social injustice<br />
but, Sir, the fact is that with rapidly<br />
rising standards of living and increasing<br />
population, the demands upon the Post<br />
Office are multiplied whilst scientific developments<br />
require more and more capital<br />
expenditure if an admittedly efficient<br />
organization is to hope to match demand.<br />
In the absence of loan moneys available to<br />
the Commonwealth, the Government is confronted<br />
by a choice. I say in the absence<br />
of loan moneys", because there are those<br />
who apparently do not know that we do not<br />
have loan money. The loan raisings, over<br />
these years, have gone to the States. Therefore,<br />
this idle reference that is periodically<br />
made to carrying capital works of the Post<br />
Office on the loan account is completely<br />
Smeaningless because there are no loans.<br />
So, what is the use of talking about a loan<br />
account? But in the absence of loan moneys, the<br />
Government, as I have said, is confronted<br />
by a choice. It can either maintain present<br />
postal and telephonic charges unaltered and<br />
transfer the necessarily growing burden of<br />
Post Office capital works to the general<br />
taxpayer, or it can ask the users of the<br />
Post Office to pay a little more so that the<br />
standard of service can be maintained and<br />
raised. That, put in its simplest form, Is the question that presents itself to any<br />
Government. Believing, as we do, that -the<br />
Post Office must develop, and that its proper<br />
need for capital expenditure will grow, we<br />
have preferred some changes in customers'<br />
rates to a transferance of the general growing<br />
burden to the ordinary taxpayer.<br />
But, Sir, the Government has, particularly<br />
in the past few days, considered with<br />
great sympathy representations that have<br />
been made as to the effect of the proposed<br />
new charges for bulk postage. That is not<br />
one of the major items in the list that was<br />
referred to in the Budget, but it is not inconsiderable.<br />
The present rate applicable<br />
to bulk postage of newspapers and periodicals<br />
is 21d. per 8 oz. on the aggregate<br />
weight of the papers. The proposal had<br />
been to increase this charge to 5d. for each<br />
8 oz. with a minimum of 2d. for each<br />
article. We have been convinced by the<br />
evidence pat before us-and I think we<br />
were all a little in the dark on this matter<br />
until these representations were made very<br />
broadly-that many of the small publications<br />
produced by a large number of community<br />
organizations would be seriously<br />
disadvantaged by the retention othe<br />
minimum charge of 2d. per article. In crder<br />
not to penalize these organizations, we propose<br />
to forgo the proposal to charge a<br />
minimum of 2d. per article. The increase of<br />
5d. for 8 oz. will stand, subject to what I<br />
am about to say; but it has been pointed out<br />
to us also that many newspapers and<br />
periodicals are sold on an annual subscriptiop<br />
which, in fact, contains a postal charge.<br />
In order not to penalize the proprietors of<br />
such newspapers and to permit them to<br />
make any necessary adjustments, the rate of<br />
5d. per 8 oz. will operate not from 1st<br />
October, 1959, as had been intended but<br />
from 1st March, 1960. I might add<br />
that notwithstanding ' these changes, there<br />
will still be a substantial loss to the Post<br />
Office on the carrying of bulk mail. That<br />
is something that perhaps is not very widely<br />
appreciated. Sir, I want to say now just a word or<br />
two about pensions. The Leader of the<br />
Opposition has said that they are eaten<br />
away by creeping inflation. Over the past<br />
ten years, we have sought to meet this<br />
position partly by frequent adjustments in<br />
pension rates and, more importantly, by<br />
measures to stabilize the economy and the </p>
<p>currency. But what is the right honorable<br />
gentleman's prescription. His prescription<br />
is to adopt inflationary finance, and to use<br />
a depreciated and depreciating currency<br />
to increase welfare payments. The Leader<br />
of the Opposition referred to child endowment.<br />
I do not want to say very much<br />
about this.<br />
Mr. Peters.-I. would not if I were you.<br />
Mr. MENZIES.-It was introduced by<br />
us, you know.'<br />
Mr. Stewart.-In 1951.<br />
Mr. MENZIES.-You have your dates<br />
wrong, dear boy. It was in 1941. But<br />
what is that? A mere decade! The fact<br />
is that child endowment was introduced by<br />
us to redress some of the anomalies of<br />
basic wage provisions. Later on, in 1951,<br />
we applied it. to the first child. Since then,<br />
let it be remembered, the arbitration tribunals<br />
have made large additions to the<br />
basic wage on the principle of the capacity<br />
RY AUTHORITY: A. J. ARTHUR, COMMON' of-industry to pay. In doing. this, it is<br />
quite clear to anybody who has followed<br />
the proceedings, that the family needs of<br />
the wage-earner have not been ignored.<br />
To add substanially to the burdens of industry<br />
by. raising child endowment, either<br />
by. increased pay-roll tax or from the taxpayers,<br />
. would have an additional effect<br />
upon the capacity of industry to pay.<br />
Sir, I conclude by saying this: If, as the<br />
Leader of the Opposition constantly says,<br />
we in this Government which I have the<br />
honour to lead, look after the few and<br />
Labour . looks after the many, I wonder<br />
how it comes about-that Labour, the party<br />
of the many, has been in office-under a<br />
free democracy-for only seventeen years<br />
out of 58 years of federation. Perhaps<br />
Labour's answer is that the people are<br />
gullible fools. If so, I hope honorable<br />
members opposite will say it, in plain<br />
terms, at the right time to the Australian<br />
people.<br />
