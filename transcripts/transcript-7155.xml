TRANSCRIPT OF? COMENTS, NORTH SYDNEY, 3 APRIL 1987<br />
E 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, how do you feel about the Opposition<br />
and the Democrats finally combining and rejecting the Australian<br />
Card? PM:. T was saying on-the media this morning that there was<br />
a great comment by Richard lrindley Sheridan, the playwright,<br />
who was also a Whig politician lie used to occasionally<br />
criticise his own party. They . brought in some legislation<br />
once with which he disagreed and he said he had often heard<br />
of people hitting their head against a brick wall but this<br />
was the first time he thought, in the whole of history, where<br />
someone had built a wall expressly for that purpose. On<br />
this occasion, it is the Libs and the Ndtional Party and<br />
tho Democrats have not themselves~ by a piece of legislation,<br />
built a wall that they are going to hit their head against<br />
but by the rejection of this legislation they will, in fact,<br />
inflict an enormous amount of injury upon themselves because<br />
it is increasingly clear that the Australian people approve<br />
of the Australia Card. And they approve of it for a very<br />
fundamental reason and that is they k~ now that this card is<br />
a necessary instrument for attacking Lax cheats and welfare<br />
frauds. That when it is implemented it will bring to the<br />
public revenue over $ 800m and the absence of that $ 800m~ which<br />
would come from the tax cheats and the welfare frauds, the<br />
absence of that means that there is a greater burden upon<br />
the vast majority of honest Australians. The Liberals and<br />
the Nationals and the Democrats have Said that is their position.<br />
They will hear about thatL from me from every day botween<br />
now and the next election. And they will be judged harshly<br />
by the Australian electorate.<br />
JOURNALIST: nr Hawke, you say when It is implemented. How,<br />
now, will you implement it?<br />
PM: After we win the next election.<br />
JOURNALIST: Would you consider re-it* roducing it with the<br />
amendment foreshadowed by Dr BleweLt earlier this year?<br />
PM: TIhey have made it clear, I think, what their position<br />
is. We will have to consider the position in the Cabinet<br />
and I am not foreshadowing that. What is clear is aftcr<br />
the next election, at any rate, with the clear and decisive<br />
majority that we will get and with the election being, in<br />
part~ 1on the Australia Card, the Australian people will give<br />
us a mandate, which I think, will be one which no opposition<br />
party will be able to avoid. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, whaL principles should the ( Government<br />
be guided by when considering privatisation?<br />
PM: The GovernmenL will take the3 clear view as to whether<br />
the nse of the Public ecqnoliic Capacity is. in terms of all<br />
the Priorities we have tor'bcount of, best utilised in that<br />
way. But T am not going into any details about this. These<br />
considerations ar-e before the Expenditure Review COrnxittee<br />
and I don't think it is appropriate for me, by any sort of<br />
sPeculation, to interfere with the work they have got to<br />
do. Once they havo had a look at it, their decisions will<br />
come up to Cabinet and that is where the matter will be decided.<br />
JOURNALIST: Is this one Issue the Opposition and the Government<br />
agree on privatisation?<br />
PM: What a silly question. I have said quite clearly in<br />
the Parliament that there will. remain a vast gulf between<br />
this GOVOr-ruuont and the Opposition parties. They have a<br />
blind ideological fixation about public ownership being<br />
inLrinsically bad. That is an absurdity. When you talk<br />
about the Opposition you have got to understand you are talking<br />
at least three Oppositions. They are riot united on this.<br />
The Liberal Party believe that you should get rid of Telecom.<br />
The Nationdl Party won't have a bar of that because they<br />
still, to some extent, limited extentL, represent rural int~ erests.<br />
And Lte great sufferers of the privatisation of Telecom would<br />
be the people in nion-metropolitan Australia. So there is<br />
no unity in the Opposition ranks on this. We take the view<br />
that it would be preposterous to privatise Telecom, prepostorous<br />
to privatise Australia P'ost. So there is a very, very<br />
considerable gulf between us and the Opposition ont these<br />
mattars. ENDS </p>
