    <content><![CDATA[<p>I am pleased to announce that the Gallipoli Memorial Club has initiated an annual art prize.  Two awards will be made each year - one to an Australian or New Zealand artist and one to a Turkish artist for works which best represent the values and traditions embodied by those who served in the Gallipoli campaign of 1915.  I understand that prize money of $10,000 will be offered to each of the winning works, which will then be displayed in the Club's museum and also made available for display in Turkey on special commemorative days.  The first awards will be presented in 2006.</p>
<p>The initiation of this award highlights the ongoing commitment of the Gallipoli Memorial Club to preserving the memory of those who served in the campaign and the lasting contribution they made to Australian nationhood. I commend the Club and its members for their initiative.</p>
<p>Further details on the Gallipoli Memorial Club Art Prize can be obtained from The Secretary, Gallipoli Memorial Art Prize Ltd, 12 Loftus Street, Sydney NSW 2000.  </p>
