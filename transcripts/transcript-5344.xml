PRESS OFFICE TRANSCRIPT MONDAY,. 5 MAY, 1980'<br />
PRIME MINISTER'S COMMENTS ON THE DEATH OF PRESIDENTT<br />
Prime Minister<br />
I have asked the Foreign Minister, Andrew Peacock, to<br />
represent Australia at the funeral of President Tito.<br />
He will have to leave tomorrow. I think the--funeral ceremonythe<br />
arrangements are being made-for Thursday -of this week.<br />
It is a matter that has been foreshadowed,. I suppose, in<br />
the reports that have we have all had over recent weeks, and<br />
-even months, because the President has been very ill for<br />
quite some time.<br />
There has been a good-deal of concern expressed'in different<br />
quarters about what might happen, could happen, within<br />
Yugoslavia, after the President. I think it must be the hope<br />
and the -objective of all nations to make sure that the<br />
integrity of Yugoslavia is--ma-intained. I do not think anyone<br />
would want the circumstances in--which the Soviet-Union took<br />
some actions which, in an iron-clad way, diminished Yugoslavia'<br />
independence.<br />
The President will certainly be remembered for his real and<br />
successful efforts to establish a degree of independence for<br />
Yugoslavia from. the generality of the communist world. There<br />
are many issues in which he took different views from that--<br />
of-the Soviet Union. His position in the Third World was one<br />
of leadership as a result of that. There obviously will be<br />
sensitive circumstances in Yugoslavia but I believe that<br />
Europe, North America, the United States, and many other<br />
countries, will be seeking to demonstrate their concern that<br />
the integrity of Yugoslavia be maintained. It is hard to<br />
think of anything good coming out of Afghanistan and the invasion<br />
of Afghanistan, but I believe that the reactions that the<br />
Soviet Union have had as a result of Afghanistan would make<br />
. it very unlikely, certainly in the immediate future, that<br />
the Soviet Union would make any moves against Yugoslavia.<br />
Question Prime Minister, what do you now regard as the most-serious<br />
threat to world peace: Iran, Afghanistan, or Yugoslavia?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
No, that is the wrong sort of-question I think. It is the<br />
generality of events that have unfolded as a result of the<br />
Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, coupled with continuing difficulties<br />
and concerns as a result of Iran. </p>
<p>-2<br />
Question Sir, if the Soviet Union tried to move in, do you believe that<br />
lthe Western allies would intervene militarily to stop them?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
I would-. believe that Western Europe and the United States<br />
have demonstrated in recent days a-. greater cohesion, g-reater<br />
s~ trength in the Western-alliance,. than has been seen for a very,<br />
very long time. I have not the slightest doubt that any move<br />
by the Soviets against Yugoslavia would be seen as a step<br />
tihat could lead to the most terrible danger for Europe and<br />
-, for the-world. I would-believe very strongly that the Soviet......-<br />
Union understands that, very s-ignificantly as a result of<br />
ithe reactions to their invasion-of Afghanistan.* If that had<br />
not occurred, if there had not been the kind, of reaction that<br />
there has been from Europe and from North America, from the<br />
JUnited-States, then-it might-well have been a different circumstance.<br />
B3ut that statement that the President of France and the Chancellor<br />
-of Germany issues shortly before I was in Paris and Bonn, and you<br />
were with me on that occasion, indicated then that they were<br />
concerned that-the invasion of Afghanistan I think the words-.,<br />
" whatever the motives might be could unleash-a process which<br />
! step by step could have the gravest, most serious dangers for<br />
mankind" a move in Europe against Yugoslavia would compound<br />
that many-fold.<br />
Question-Prime Minister does it not though' despite what you have said,--<br />
add inevitably to the tension and to the instability throughout<br />
that broad region?<br />
]? rime Minister<br />
I think there-are chances that this will not occur, if for no<br />
other reason than it is something that has been expected for<br />
quite some time. Obviously, a good deal will depend upon the<br />
maintenance, within Yugoslavia, of the integrity of the<br />
administration, of the sense of purpose. We know there have<br />
traditionally been problems and difficulties within Yugoslavia<br />
as one nation. But the larger problems at the moment are problems<br />
that involve the Soviet Union, and expansion of Soviet power.<br />
I would believe. that within Yugoslavia there would be a<br />
consciousness of that and a very real determination to maintain<br />
the kind of independence from the Soviet Union, from much of the<br />
communist world, which President Tito was able to establish with<br />
great skill and with great courage over a long period.<br />
Question-<br />
While Mr. Peacock is overseas, do you intend him to have talks<br />
with any other leaders on the wider issues of Iran<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Of course he would be, yes. When Foreign Ministers are going<br />
we do not know yet the representation of all countries who will be<br />
at the funeral, but I was discussing this with Andrew -Peacock this </p>
<p>3<br />
Prime Minister( continued)<br />
morning, and he wi-il be seeking the opportunity fordiscussions<br />
with his counterparts from different countries.<br />
It-i-s-et . a-question--in-these-issues of having one discussionand<br />
that is the end of it. It is a changing scene. It is<br />
necessary to maintain a very close contact, just as I did<br />
S at Salisbury. so will_ he there. It is possible that he could<br />
visit one or two other countries in Europe, and possible, but<br />
too early yet to say, that he may come back through the<br />
United States. But that could depend significantly on whether<br />
Senator Muskie himself attends the funeral, or whether the-<br />
S United States attendance is from somebody else.<br />
Question Sir, why are you not going to the funeral?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
We have a very important guest here. Mr. Anthony is the very<br />
direct--. host, but having the third most important person from<br />
the People's Republic of China in Australia, is something that<br />
clearly involves me. It clearly involves the Deputy-Prime Minister.-<br />
In these circumstances, our place is very much in Australia.<br />
I think a number of heads of government,-Presidents or<br />
Prime Ministers, will probably be at President Tito's funeral.<br />
But that will not be so with all Governments. The representation-'-<br />
of the Foreign Minister at the funeral is a very appropriate<br />
one and a very proper one. That will, in a very full way,<br />
demonstrate Australia's concern, and interest in the future of<br />
Yugoslavia. 000---</p>
