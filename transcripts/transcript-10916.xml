    <content><![CDATA[<p>E&amp;OE...............................................................................................................................</p>
<p>Thank you Mr Blank, Mr Spring, my friend and colleague, Phillip Baressi,</p>
<p> my other Parliamentary colleagues, ladies and gentlemen.</p>
<p>It is a delight to be back in Ringwood. It is not, as Phillip reminded</p>
<p> you the first time, but it is an opportunity for me to renew some</p>
<p> associations that I've made over the years particularly with</p>
<p> the small business community in this part of Melbourne. And can I</p>
<p> thank those who have put this afternoon's gathering together</p>
<p> because as Phillip Baressi said at the end of his introductory speech</p>
<p> that Members of Parliament do need to retain very direct methods of</p>
<p> communication with the people who elect them.</p>
<p>Government in modern times is more complex, more difficult, more challenging</p>
<p> than ever before. Expectations are high. The sense of disappointment</p>
<p> and the sense of frustration is also high if expectations are not</p>
<p> realised. It is therefore important that this kind of personal contact</p>
<p> be achieved on as many occasions as possible and I personally have</p>
<p> endeavoured in the two and a quarter years that I've been Prime</p>
<p> Minister to visit all parts of our country and to talk to all sections</p>
<p> of the community to listen to what they have to say and to communicate</p>
<p> the reasons why the Government has taken certain actions.</p>
<p>Over the past couple of days that we've had in Melbourne, a major</p>
<p> economic conference which has been addressed by international visitors,</p>
<p> by world economists, by officials of the World Banks, by leaders of</p>
<p> Asian communities and Asian countries including the Chief Executive</p>
<p> of the Hong Kong region of China and [inaudible] Ministers from Singapore.</p>
<p> I thought some of the reporting and some of the messages that came</p>
<p> out of yesterday's section of the conference were excessively</p>
<p> pessimistic. There are difficulties economically in Asia and many</p>
<p> of the Asian countries are going through a greater economic melt down</p>
<p> than they have previously experienced. But I thought the use of the</p>
<p> word depression was a little excessive and quite alarming and certainly</p>
<p> doesn't represent the reading of the situation that I have that</p>
<p> is available to me from our economic advisers.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, we are now in Australia operating against the background</p>
<p> of an Asian Pacific region dramatically different than what it was</p>
<p> two or three years ago. And as a result of that I am all the more</p>
<p> of the view that the actions that the Government has taken to strengthen</p>
<p> and protect the Australian economy over the last two and a quarter</p>
<p> years were absolutely essential. Without in any way winning the sound</p>
<p> of self congratulatory which is always a mistake in public life, can</p>
<p> I very simply say to you that if we had not set about reducing the</p>
<p> very large budget deficit we inherited, if we had not set about reducing</p>
<p> debts, if we had not set about making other changes to the economic</p>
<p> infrastructure of Australia, we would not now have what are in truth,</p>
<p> the strongest economic foundations that Australia has had for a quarter</p>
<p> of a century. And if we had not done those things we would now be</p>
<p> a lot weaker and a lot more vulnerable as a result of what has occurred</p>
<p> in our region of the world. Because whether we like it or not we do</p>
<p> live in a global economy.</p>
<p>Some of us may want it other ways. We may think it would be terrific</p>
<p> in the words of the old song, Stop the World, I Want to Get Off. But</p>
<p> you don't have that option. The world won't allow you the</p>
<p> luxury of stopping and getting off. And whether we like it or not,</p>
<p> if we are not an attractive location for investment, that foreign</p>
<p> investment will go somewhere else. Overseas companies and countries</p>
<p> don't invest Australia out of nostalgia. They invest in Australia</p>
<p> because Australia gives them a good return. And if we don't give</p>
<p> them a good return, or if we don't make them welcome, they'll</p>
<p> take their investment somewhere else. And instead of their investment</p>
<p> employing thousands Australians, it will employ thousands of Malaysians</p>
<p> or thousands of Americans, or thousands of Englishmen or thousands</p>
<p> of Germans or thousands of Italians.</p>
<p>That is the nature of a global economy. And that is why it's</p>
<p> so necessary at a time like this for governments to do things that</p>
<p> strengthen us and we have been able to do that because over the last</p>
<p> little while we've reduced that deficit mightily. We are now</p>
<p> in surplus for the first time in over ten years. And we can look forward,</p>
<p> if all our friends can just realise, to an essentially debt free start</p>
<p> for the 21st century. And that's a very important achievement.</p>
<p> We do have the lowest interest rates for 30 years for both housing</p>
<p> and small business and that means a lot particularly to people here</p>
<p> in the real estate business. It means a lot to men and women in small</p>
<p> business. Because although I know you'd like the interest rates</p>
<p> to be lower, they are significantly lower now than what they were</p>
<p> three, four, five years ago.</p>
<p>That's very important to the outlook and the operations of those</p>
<p> businesses. We have low inflation rates, in fact, Australia has got</p>
<p> about the lowest inflation rate in the Western world. And we have</p>
<p> made a lot of very important changes to industrial relations as Phillip</p>
<p> mentioned. The important changes we have made to provide a better</p>
<p> balance between some of the large corporations and some of the small</p>
<p> business sector.</p>
<p>Small business is something that is very close not only to my own</p>
<p> heart as a person because I grew up in a small business environment</p>
<p> and I learnt at a very early age that there was nothing more worthwhile</p>
<p> in life than starting your own business with absolutely nothing and</p>
<p> making a go of it, and it is something that I have believed in very</p>
<p> strongly all of my life. But my Government is also very committed</p>
<p> to the role of small business as a generator of employment. We've</p>
<p> had a lot of debate at the moment about the fact that our Native Title</p>
<p> Bill is tied up in the Senate because the Opposition parties won't</p>
<p> vote for it. It's not the only Bill, can I say that is tied up</p>
<p> in the Senate.</p>
<p>There is also a Bill dealing with unfair dismissals which will make</p>
<p> the law even better for small business than the changes than we made</p>
<p> after we were elected and that's also being held up in the Senate</p>
<p> and it's also one of the pieces of legislation that if there</p>
<p> were a joint sitting with the two houses of Parliament after a double</p>
<p> dissolution, if one were to occur, that would be presented for passage.</p>
<p>So we have done a lot to make changes and I know there is quite a</p>
<p> bit of debate in the Australian community at the present time about</p>
<p> the impact of economic change on our community. Some of those impacts</p>
<p> are significant to sections of the Australian community. Change is</p>
<p> never easy and change needs explaining, change needs justification</p>
<p> and change should only ever be embraced if it's going to produce</p>
<p> a better result than the one that it addresses. But there really is</p>
<p> very little option for this country, in fact there is no option in</p>
<p> that it must continue to make desirable changes and one of those desirable</p>
<p> changes is to reform our taxation system.</p>
<p>Now that has been around for a very long time and deep down, most</p>
<p> people in public life on both sides of politics know that sooner or</p>
<p> later we have to reform our taxation system. There are some things</p>
<p> you never do because they make the country worse. There are some things</p>
<p> you never do because even if you do them, they don't make the</p>
<p> country any better. There are other things that you know that when</p>
<p> you have finally done them and you've summoned the courage to</p>
<p> do them, they will produce a better country and a better economy..</p>
<p> And a better taxation system is one of those things. We do have a</p>
<p> very old-fashioned taxation system. There aren't many countries</p>
<p> in the world that have the same wholesale taxation system that Australia</p>
<p> has. There are a few countries but they aren't really at the</p>
<p> top of the ladder as far as competitiveness and economic performance</p>
<p> are concerned.</p>
<p>And it is a very funny old system, it says that if you are wealthy</p>
<p> enough to buy a Lear jet, you don't pay any wholesale sales tax</p>
<p> but if you are like the rest of us and you've got a family car</p>
<p> you pay 22 per cent. It's a system that says that if you buy</p>
<p> flavoured milk you pay sales tax and if you buy ordinary milk you</p>
<p> don't. It imposes very high sales taxes on biscuits and orange</p>
<p> juice concentrate but it doesn't impose any sales tax on caviar.</p>
<p> It's based upon the assumption now quite erroneous that most</p>
<p> of the economic activity in Australia is manufacturing. Yet in reality</p>
<p> manufacturing is a smaller section of the economic activity than used</p>
<p> to be the case when it was imposed.</p>
<p>We had a report this morning from the Institute of Chartered Accountants</p>
<p> that said that incredibly enough, a family of two adults of mum and</p>
<p> dad and two children with only one income earner, that was earning</p>
<p> $20,000 a year was, in fact, $9 a week better off after tax than say</p>
<p> a family earning $30,000 a year. Now, that has to be wrong, it's</p>
<p> crazy and it's an illustration of the sort of anachronisms and</p>
<p> the weaknesses and the flaws that have developed in our taxation system</p>
<p> over the years. And that's why we want to address it. We are</p>
<p> not wanting to address it because of revolution but changing the Australian</p>
<p> taxation system is the next logical thing to do to make the Australian</p>
<p> economy better and stronger, to give it more security, stability and</p>
<p> safety.</p>
<p>Now I could put it off, I could say: Oh well look, we won't go</p>
<p> to the next election with a taxation reform policy. If I get re-elected</p>
<p> I'll have a meeting, I'll call everybody together and I'll</p>
<p> have a meeting to talk about it. Now does anybody really imagine that</p>
<p> out of that meeting you'll get a consensus to borrow the words</p>
<p> of one of my predecessors? Does anybody really imagine that if you</p>
<p> got the Liberal Party and the National Party and the Labor Party and</p>
<p> anybody else who wanted to come along at a political level, and you</p>
<p> got the business community, small and large in the middle, you've</p>
<p> got the welfare sector, you've got the trade unions, you've</p>
<p> got them all together, does anybody really imagine that you are going</p>
<p> to get a consensus about the detail of it? You'd have a lot of</p>
<p> debate, you'd have a lot of set piece speeches.(inaudible) at</p>
<p> the taxation summit in 1985 but at the end of the day there would</p>
<p> be no clear consensus and what people would say: oh well, the Government's</p>
<p> got to decide what to do. And that's a bit proper, actually because</p>
<p> the governments do have to decide what to do because that's what</p>
<p> they are elected to do. Governments are elected to make decisions</p>
<p> . They should have meetings and they should consult and heaven knows,</p>
<p> Australia's politicians have been consulting the Australian community</p>
<p> about taxation reform now for the whole time I've been in politics.</p>
<p>I was elected to Parliament in 1974 and that was one year after Billy</p>
<p> Snedden, the late Billy Snedden, as Federal Treasurer in the McMahon</p>
<p> Government had commissioned the (inaudible) committee. It was a committee</p>
<p> of inquiry into Australia's taxation system chaired by a New</p>
<p> South Wales judge who was a taxation expert, or had been a taxation</p>
<p> expert when he practiced at the bar. And they brought down a report</p>
<p> in 1975, a year after I became a Member of Parliament, recommending</p>
<p> fundamental reforms of Australia's taxation system. And believe</p>
<p> it or not, do you know what they recommend? They recommended the introduction</p>
<p> of a broad based indirect tax. You might now call it a GST or a value</p>
<p> added tax or whatever you'd like to call it. They recommended</p>
<p> its introduction in place of a whole lot of existing indirect taxes</p>
<p> and it actually says the wholesale sales tax was inefficient and out</p>
<p> of date and anachronistic and it drew attention to the deleterious</p>
<p> effects of marginal taxation rates on low income earners, like the</p>
<p> example that I quoted.</p>
<p>Isn't it incredible. That was in 1975. It is now 1998, 23 years</p>
<p> later and the system is even more in need of change. So I could, I</p>
<p> could sort of do the, I think, rather weak thing and that is, give</p>
<p> the idea away and say we are going to have a meeting and if I did</p>
<p> that and we happened to get re-elected and we have a meeting, that</p>
<p> won't achieve anything. It'll be back on my desk and I have</p>
<p> to decide whether we are going to put a plan to the Australian people</p>
<p> or I am going to forget about it forever.</p>
<p>My opponent, Mr Beazley, says the present system is terrific and doesn't</p>
<p> need any change so if he gets elected you won't get any change</p>
<p> there. And the other party on the horizon now, the One Nation party,</p>
<p> agrees with Mr Beazley. It also says the present system is terrific,</p>
<p> so you won't get any change out of that lot either. So if you</p>
<p> really want to have a change to the taxation system the one great</p>
<p> opportunity is to really present it now and that's what we intend</p>
<p> to do before the election. And people will have an opportunity of</p>
<p> looking at it. But sooner or later, with these difficult things you</p>
<p> either have to say to the Australian people: it's too hard, count</p>
<p> me out, I can't do it. Or you've got to bite the bullet</p>
<p> and have a go, and I think the Australian people want the Government</p>
<p> they elect to have a go. If they don't like it, well they'll</p>
<p> vote against it and that's the democratic process.</p>
<p>But I think they will like it. I think they will respond to a plan</p>
<p> that addresses the weaknesses of the present system. And one of the</p>
<p> great virtues of the taxation reform we have in mind is that it will</p>
<p> help our exports and we need to do that because in a difficult world</p>
<p> environment, exporting is very important. And you can have taxation</p>
<p> change that protects the poor, you certainly can. And we have consulted</p>
<p> very extensively with the Australian Council of Social Services in</p>
<p> putting together our plan and I hear what was said earlier about the</p>
<p> need for any change not to involve a significant burden on the small</p>
<p> business sector. But there are significant benefits for the simple</p>
<p> system. One of the great benefits of the simpler system, an effective,</p>
<p> broad based indirect tax in place of the existing taxes, can I just</p>
<p> make that point, people regularly talk about introducing a GST. We</p>
<p> are not going to introduce a GST. We are considering introducing something</p>
<p> called that in place of existing taxes but there is no way we are</p>
<p> going to put a new tax on top of the existing taxes. We are not that</p>
<p> stupid. We have no intention of doing that.</p>
<p>But what we are considering doing and what will obviously be part</p>
<p> of the plan is to bring in a broad based, indirect tax or GST in place</p>
<p> of existing taxes. And also to make, of course, significant changes</p>
<p> to personal income tax levels. So it's a total package, not a</p>
<p> GST on its own, it's not personal income tax cuts on its own.</p>
<p> It's a total reform of the system. And we are doing it because</p>
<p> we think it will be good for Australia, that's the reason why</p>
<p> we are doing it. And I believe that the Australian people will support</p>
<p> reform if it satisfies two conditions.</p>
<p>One of those conditions is that it should be good for the country,</p>
<p> that's the first thing. And secondly, is that it ought to be</p>
<p> fair. Australians are great believers in fairness and I don't</p>
<p> think the present system is fair and my suspicion is a lot of Australians</p>
<p> don't think it's fair any longer, so they want that changed.</p>
<p> So we are committed to reform in that area, not because of any ideological</p>
<p> zeal, not because we have any zealous commitments to what is contemptuously</p>
<p> called economic rationalism. We are committed to taxation reform because</p>
<p> we think it will be good for our country. And that's what governments</p>
<p> are elected to do.</p>
<p>Sometimes you've got to weather the storm of criticism and sometimes</p>
<p> you've got to deal with people like One Nation who come onto</p>
<p> the horizon and say, oh look, don't take any notice of that,</p>
<p> there are simple solutions. I mean their National Director a couple</p>
<p> of days ago was saying the solution to a cheap bank loan was to print</p>
<p> money.</p>
<p>Print money.</p>
<p>He said you can have a two per cent loan from a bank. I made the observation</p>
<p> that well, it's nice to be a borrower at two per cent but who</p>
<p> is going to lend to the bank at one and a half per cent so it can</p>
<p> afford to lend at two per cent because I thought banks operated on</p>
<p> the principle, and I am obviously wrong, that you borrow from "x"</p>
<p> and you lend to "y" and you pay "x" a little less</p>
<p> than you charge "y" and that's called your profit.</p>
<p> Well that's how I thought the system worked but I am obviously</p>
<p> wrong. What you do is print money.</p>
<p>That's how you do it, you print money and I mean, that would</p>
<p> do wonders for the savings of our retired community because if you</p>
<p> start printing money you'll send inflation through the roof.</p>
<p> You start printing money and you'll undermine the whole basis</p>
<p> of and our economy, I think, it's very interesting now that there's</p>
<p> a bit more focus on these alternative propositions, that they are</p>
<p> now starting to get a bit of air play and people are starting to have</p>
<p> a look at it. I mean, once you get people elected to Parliament, well,</p>
<p> you are entitled to have your policies looked at like everybody else.</p>
<p> Everything I say gets examined, gee does it ever. Everything I say</p>
<p> gets examined. A lot of it gets misrepresented too but that's</p>
<p> another matter and I won't weary you with that and I don't</p>
<p> see why other people on the Australian political scene should be denied</p>
<p> the privilege of having their statements examined in great detail</p>
<p> and as they are examined in great detail I think people will start</p>
<p> to see the folly of them.</p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen, we have made a number of very, very major improvements</p>
<p> over the last two and a quarter years in the operation of our economy</p>
<p> and it has given us an inner strength which has enabled us to weather</p>
<p> the worst of the Asian economic storm. We aren't untouched by</p>
<p> that storm and we won't remain untouched by it. But if we had</p>
<p> not done what we had done over the last two and a quarter years, we</p>
<p> would have been absolutely ravaged by that economic storm and it would</p>
<p> have inflicted a great deal more damage on the Australian economy,</p>
<p> than has been the case over the last six months in particular. And</p>
<p> it is very necessary therefore that it continue where change, further</p>
<p> change and further reform is essential. It is very important that</p>
<p> we continue on that journey.</p>
<p>It is very important that we communicate the need for that change</p>
<p> in reform and have an understanding of its impact on all sections</p>
<p> of the Australian community. And we need energetic, in touch local</p>
<p> representatives and Phillip is certainly one of those. And can I say</p>
<p> that he has been an extraordinarily energetic representative for the</p>
<p> electorate of Deakin in the Federal Parliament. He comes of this area,</p>
<p> he has experienced how small business operates in this area. His family</p>
<p> involvement is in this area. And he represents a style of local politician</p>
<p> that he is very effective. He is quietly persistent. He's a person</p>
<p> who collars Ministers with an almost voracious appetite in the corridors</p>
<p> of Parliament to put a point of view on a proposition on behalf of</p>
<p> his constituents, and can I say he argued very strongly with a lot</p>
<p> of his other Victorian Federal colleagues for changes in the laws,</p>
<p> achieving a fairer balance between the operations of small and large</p>
<p> businesses within our community. And he's argued very strongly</p>
<p> for the interests of this part of Melbourne to be properly cared for,</p>
<p> whatever decisions have been taken by the Federal Government.</p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen, he's a first class representative and that,</p>
<p> of course, is one of a number of reasons why I am absolutely delighted</p>
<p> to be here today. Can I say that the strength of Australia's</p>
<p> communities and their willingness to work together, the great spirit</p>
<p> of voluntarism which is a defiant strength in the Australian personality</p>
<p> which is readily recognisable wherever you go in Australia - it is</p>
<p> one of the most uplifting things that I find as I go around our country,</p>
<p> and certainly very evident here today and I do appreciate the opportunity</p>
<p> of addressing such a cross section of people, and I want to acknowledge,</p>
<p> although this is very much a small business gathering, I do want to</p>
<p> acknowledge the presence in the audience of local clergymen, of people</p>
<p> who are involved in making community activities of looking after the</p>
<p> less fortunate.</p>
<p>I just took the opportunity before coming here and spending three</p>
<p> quarters of an hour at that marvellous Salvation Army retirement village,</p>
<p> Inala, a few miles away and it was a perfect demonstration of how</p>
<p> well our community organisations care for people. And it's an</p>
<p> enormous tribute to that great organisation, the Salvation Army.</p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen, I thought some of the remarks made yesterday</p>
<p> at that conference were excessively pessimistic but, nonetheless,</p>
<p> our region is going through difficult times and if I could just make</p>
<p> a quiet, have a quiet political commercial, I don't think now</p>
<p> is really the time to put aside safety, stability and security in</p>
<p> a sea of economic turbulence to go back to policies that deliver deficit</p>
<p> and debt or alternatively, experiment with policies which are based</p>
<p> upon such dubious propositions as sitting up 24 hours of the day,</p>
<p> printing money in order to solve our economic difficulties. I think</p>
<p> the time really is to hang on to a respectable, stable, secure approach.</p>
<p> It has given Australia a great community of strength and stability</p>
<p> in a time of considerable economic difficulty.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
