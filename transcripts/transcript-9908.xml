PRIME MINISTER<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING, MP<br />
AUSTRALIAN EDUCATION UNION ANNUAL FEDERAL CONFERENCE<br />
MELBOURNE, 19 JANUARY 1996<br />
" CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY<br />
Thank you for Inviting me to address you today. I spoke at this Conference three years ago and then, as<br />
now, we were facing an election. It was a profoundly Important election then and it will be just as important<br />
this lime.<br />
Some peopie are saying the lines are not as sharply drawn: that without the deeply ideological Mr Hewson,<br />
and the deeply iniquitous GST, Australians this time will have some kind of tweedle dumn tweedle dee choice<br />
confronting them.<br />
Nothing of course could be further than the truth. Last time we faced a right wing Ideologue, a man who put<br />
his policies and Ideas on the tabie and challenged us to persuade Australian voters that our policies and<br />
ideas were better.<br />
This time we are facing a right wing Ideologue who will not put his policies and ideas on the table.<br />
John Howard has been shadowing me for a quarter of a century: we are the oldest political opponents still<br />
practising, I know him so well and his beliefs so well that if I close my eyes I can hear them playing like a<br />
broken record In my head and it is the voice of the most conservative politician in the last quarter of a<br />
century.<br />
Or, to use his own words, the most conservative leader the Liberal Party has ever had. And if anybody tells<br />
you that John Howard has suddenly become a cuddly small Liberal who has seen the error of his<br />
reactionary ways, you can tell them that I am a Rastafarian and Tim Fischer is a Trotskyist,<br />
So iet's be in no doubt about this sometime In the next two or three months Australians will make a<br />
decision about the basic nature of their society and the basic direction it will take into the 21 st century.<br />
Tndi: y I arldrarc ynei in a Irv% 14I onvironmont whki~ to undamontolly tho camo oo it woo throo yearo Q89.<br />
What hits changed Is that we have moved on as a nation. We have moved on as a community. We have<br />
moved on in our social policy, our foreign policy, our Industrial relations policy, our labour market programs,<br />
our cultural policy, our Idea for an Australian republic, our superannuation policy, our policy on the<br />
environment, our policy for Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders. The economy has moved on.<br />
In everyone of these areas we have made5 dramatic strides In the past three years.<br />
And, with your cooperation, we have made them in education.<br />
Now you will remember that when I was here three years ago, Mr Hewson had committed the Opposition to<br />
shifting resources to wealthy private schools, introducing vouchers for vocational education and fees for<br />
undergraduate courses, and slashing $ 10 billion from the social wage, Including education.<br />
Today Mr Howard says nothing about those nasty things. He offers none of the specific policy details, just<br />
nebulous policy directions things he believes In, he says. </p>
<p>You don't have to be a political genius to know why John Howard is not giving us any details. My dog knows<br />
why. John Howard is giving us no policy detail because as we found with John Howson and Jeff Kennett<br />
the devil is In the detail. And John Howard hopes that if he leaves the detail out, and just keeps smiling as<br />
cutely as he can, Australians won't see the devil lurking.<br />
I know what he will say there's that Keating trying to scare people, talking about lurking devils and John<br />
Howard being just like John Howson. " Massive scare campaign", he will say.<br />
Well let's look at just one of John Howard's policy principles. Let's see if there Is a devil lurking in what he<br />
says he'll do about education.<br />
John Howard has committed a Coalition Government to winding back specific purpose grants to the States.<br />
The States, he says, " will have greater freedom of choice when deciding their programs and priorities".<br />
Now the Commonwealth Government provIdas over $ 4 billion in funding for school and vocational<br />
education In the form of specific grants to the States -nearly one quarter of all specific purpose payments to<br />
the States goes to education.<br />
These grants help meet the costs of teachers' salaries, curriculum development and the professional<br />
development of teachers. Grants to build and maintain schools and TAFEs. Grants to improve educational<br />
opportunities for Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders, students with disabilities, children living in isolated<br />
regions and children who suffer sodao-economic disadvantage. Grants to Improve the quality of schooling<br />
and access to vocational education.<br />
Mr Howard says he would wind back these grants.<br />
And what would he put In their place?<br />
The State's " programs and priorities".<br />
So where is the devil lurking in this? Well, it just could be recognisable In the " programns and priorities" of<br />
certain States.<br />
Victoria, for instance, where the education " priorities" of the Ken nett Government have closed nearly 300<br />
schools, reduced teacher numbers by 8,000, and cut the level of spending per student by<br />
Or Tasmania, where real spending per student has fallen by 7 per cent.<br />
And South Australia. The South Australian Government's priorities have seen the education budget<br />
slashed by $ 40 million.<br />
Where is the devil lurking in this particular Liberal Party policy " principle"? Answer in getting the States to<br />
do the details. In getting the States to do the dirty work.<br />
A little later I will be talking about another fundamental area of national policy where the Liberal Party is<br />
similarly attempting to impose their old agenda by new means.<br />
In fact, the more of these policy " principles" we look at the more we will see that, under John Howard's<br />
leadership, the Liberal Party Is attempting to do by stealth what last time they attempted to do by open<br />
debate. For the Australian public, not getting to see the detail means not getting to see the fundamental difference<br />
between the Government and the Opposition. It means they don't get to see the choice.<br />
In fact the choice is very much the same as It was the last time John Howard led the Coalition in an election<br />
campaign. It is very much the chioice Australian voters have faced ever since the Liberal Party bought the<br />
Idea that " small government" and a market free-for-all is the best means of governing a country.<br />
For a decade or more, John Howard has been chief spokesman for this position and in successive elections<br />
the Australian people have rejected him and his ideology. This election is his last stand this is John<br />
Howard's Little Big Horn and there is nothing he won't do to escape the fate of Custer. </p>
<p>If it means renouncing policies he has espoused all his political life, he will do it. If he can hide them he will.<br />
And if he can get the States to practise them on his behalf well, what could suit him better?<br />
Why you would give the States more responsibilities when many of them are walking away from their<br />
existing responsibilities is beyond me. It is beyond Labor,<br />
We say education is too important to leave to the States.<br />
We say that the interests of our children are the Interest of the Commonwealth Government; the Interests of<br />
those millions of Australians who need vocational training are the interests of the Commonwealth<br />
Government. The interests of social equity and economic efficiency are the interests of the Commonwealth<br />
Government. We say all these issues concern the national Interest and the national interest is the interest<br />
of the Commonwealth Government.<br />
Through its funding decisions, a government demnonstrates its priorities and interests and where it believes<br />
Its responsibilities lie.<br />
Through the provision of real Increases in funding for school education 54 per cent since we came to office<br />
the Labor Government has supported access to education for all Australians.<br />
In establishing the National Professional Development Fund, we have worked with teachers to strengthen<br />
and widen their professional knowledge and expertise, acknowledging that teachers are the main agents of<br />
educational reform.<br />
Through support for EdNa, we have Identified the national significance of ensuring our schools are equipped<br />
to take advantage of new technology.<br />
In our suppoit for Aboriginal education, students from disadvantaged and isolated areas, students with<br />
disabilities and students from non-English speaking backgrounds, we have put a premium on access and<br />
equity. With funding for the new civics and citizenship education program, we are recognising that our young<br />
people should understand our democratic institutions and participate in the civic life of the nation.<br />
In Implemreniting the National Strategy on Asian Languages and Studies, we have recognised the need to<br />
improve Australia's capacity to understand, interact and trade with our key Asian neighbours.<br />
Through our $ 1.5 billion Increase in funding tor vocational education, we are signalling that a world-class<br />
vocational education system is essential for building a competitive nation, and we are demonstrating that<br />
this Government has a rock solid commitment to a public vocational education system which creates life<br />
opportunities and allows access for all.<br />
The Federal Labor Government has a deep interest in the shape of the nation's education system and the<br />
education of our young people. But this interest would be hollow if it were not backed up by funding to<br />
sustain and improve the education system. This is just what specific grants to the States are for. And this is<br />
just what the Liberals would hand over to the States.<br />
I have said before that education and especially public education is a wealth transfer. It is a profoundly<br />
democratic and just investment and it is essential to the maintenance of the social fabric. It is also<br />
essential to a healthy economy. A better trained workforce Is a more productive and innovative workforce.<br />
Because education Is fundamental to our aspirations as a nation and as a people, because It goes to the<br />
core of our egalitarian values, because it is an essential means of creating social cohesion, because it is a<br />
basic right of all Australians, the Commonwealth Government has a duty to provide for it.<br />
As teachers I expect you will have some sympathy with this attitude. As teachers you have professional<br />
aspirations and interests an Interest in the people you teach, the quality of your schools and colleges, the<br />
quality of curricula, the standards of your profession. </p>
<p>But you also have aspirations as citizens as Australians with ambitions for yourselves and for your<br />
children, with expectations that the reward for the work you do will allow a reasonabie amount of time for<br />
leisure and recreation, and a reasonable salary to buy a reasonable life style now and in retirement. As<br />
people who dedicate your labour, skills and knowledge to educating others, you expect, and have a right to<br />
expect, decent pay and conditions of employment, including security of employment.<br />
That is why as well as your interest In what Governments do about education, you have an interest In what<br />
they do or propose to do about industrial relations.<br />
When we talk about Industrial relations we are talking about more than the level of wages and salaries<br />
although we are certainly talking about them too. When we talk about industrial relations, we are talking<br />
about the welfare of individuals and families and their children. We are talking about the distribution of<br />
wealth and opportunity in our society.<br />
The Industrial relations system, broadly speaking, is the framework in which opportunity and wealth are<br />
delivered. It is the basic mechanism of social justice. And, like education, it sets the boundaries for the sort<br />
of society we are and want to be.<br />
That is why, like education, It is an arena in which governments have a proper Interest. In education we<br />
accept our responsibility to provide schools, equipment, technology, teachers. In industrial relations we<br />
accept responsibility to provide a system that works fairly, efficiently and delivers security. That means we<br />
accept responsibility to provide a safety net and an umpire.<br />
And If you look at how our Industrial relations system has worked in the last decade and a half, and consider<br />
the improvements which are still being made, you would have to ask why anyone would want to tear it down.<br />
Why you would want to walk away from your responsibility to provide the umpire and the safety net?<br />
The systemn we presently have and the one we have been developing for the last twelve years or so has<br />
delivered results which were unimaginable in the days when the Coalition was in office.<br />
It delivers a safety net for all workers. It delivers real wage increases. It delivers more than twice the labour<br />
productivity of the country whose Individual contract system the Coalition most admires, New Zealand. It<br />
delivers the lowest rate of strikes since 1940. It delivers employment growth. It delivers low inflation; and<br />
Increasingly It delivers flexibility, skilling, and work place reform.<br />
It delivers an Industrial culture of cooperation rather than conflict. It delivers an environment In which<br />
fundamental, and fundamentally necessary, economic reform can take place without the social damage<br />
which has accompanied such reform In other countries.<br />
It delivers the means by which Australia has become a competitive and open economy, and yet retained its<br />
social cohesion and the social values which have traditionally underpinned it.<br />
In view of all this, you have to ask why would you tear it down?<br />
Because despite their most recent efforts to pretend otherwise, tear it down is what the Coalition would do.<br />
Labor market reform has been John Howard's passion for a decade.<br />
What's tihe first thing the Coalition would do? They would throw away the Accord.<br />
John Howard yearns for the pre-Accord days. We should remember what those days were like.<br />
Australia was strike-prone.<br />
The best measure of Industrial unrest, working days lost per 1000 employees, stood at 590 per annum under<br />
Fraser and Howard in 1994 the number was 76. The average under the Accord is 67 per cent lower than It<br />
was pre-Accord.<br />
The change since 1983 has not been a slight variation to the industrial weather It has been a major change<br />
In the climate.<br />
But in the last resort, thle umpire still prevails. </p>
<p>In the CRA conflict of last November an industrial disaster was averted because the system worked: the<br />
Australian Industrial Relations Commission stepped in.<br />
The same Commission that John Howard wants to do away with. " We will stab the Commission in the<br />
stomach" he said in his braver days of 1992 when the Coalition thought they would win by being honest<br />
about their intentions.<br />
John Howard supported Comaico the same John Howard who last week said he believed in equal pay for<br />
work of equal value!<br />
Ask yourself, whiat would have happened, without the Commission.<br />
Comalco was paying workers up to $ 20,000 less than their feliow workers performing identical tasks, just<br />
because the latter signed individual contracts.<br />
Ask yourself how long that dispute would have gone on, and what the casualties would have been If it hadn't<br />
been fixed quickly. The country would have been brought to its knees.<br />
The costs would have been extreme, and the consequences would go on for a long time.<br />
Our reputation as a low strike country has taken more than a decade or mature perseverance. But it would<br />
all be lost in a few weeks with the Howard hostility to unions and without an umpire to sort it out.<br />
Our Industrial stability is under even greater threat from the Coalition than first appears. The deplorable<br />
strike record delivered under John Howard in 1975-82 occurred under relatively favourable circumstances<br />
compared to what will happen under the Coalition of the present.<br />
At least in the 1975-82 period the Liberal Government did not directly seek conflict with the union<br />
movement, as Its current policy does. It was more an approach of benign antipathy; today it is one of<br />
aggressive hostility they talk about " breaking" union power.<br />
At least in the 1975-82 period the Liberal Government did not sideline the umpire, the Industrial Relations<br />
Commission, as Its current policy does.<br />
So under the Coalition there would be a much bigger fight than before, and there would be no referee.<br />
The Accord processes are more than about cooperation and Industrial peace. They reflect a consensual<br />
view on the importance of the link between labour cost changes and national economic performance.<br />
When the Government came to office In 1983, we Inherited double-digit inflation and double-digit<br />
unemployment an Australian first.<br />
In the period of the Accord we have had macro-economic outcomes foreseen by no economist and<br />
unimaginable under the previous approach.<br />
Real GOP growth has averaged 3.7 per cent growth per year under the Accord. It was 1.9 per cent In the<br />
seven years before the Labor Government. That is, the Accord has delivered nearly a doubling of growth.<br />
And It's continuing we now have had a record 17 successive quarters of GDP growth.<br />
Economic growth means jobs growth. The Accord has delivered average employment growth of 2.3 per cent<br />
per year; when Mr Howard was Treasurer the figure was 0.8 per cent.<br />
In absolute numbers, the job growth figures are even starker: 184,514 per year under the Accord, 50,199<br />
per year under Mr Howard.<br />
If employment had continued to grow at the same rate as it did under Howard, there would be 1.4 million<br />
fewer jobs today. </p>
<p>Inflation has been reduced to an average of 5.2 per cent a year under the Accord: Mr Howard's record: 9.9<br />
per cent. For the last 4 years It has averaged 2.25 per cent, a figure that 13 years ago would have been<br />
Incredible. Real average weekly earnings for full-time adults has Iricreascd by 8.8 per cent under the Accord. The<br />
Coalition says wages have failcn, but that's because they are using shonky data a point explained In the<br />
document I am launching today.<br />
The rapid employment growth and the higher real wages have influenced the best total measure or<br />
economic welfare: real disposable household Income per capita. Under the Accord it has increased by 22.3<br />
per cent, or nearly 2 per cent a year. For the previous pre-Accord period the total increase was only 6 per<br />
cent less than 1 per cent a year.<br />
Moreover, the Accord has provided a mechanism for transforming workplaces. It is not an accident, nor Is it<br />
an international phenomenon, that our workplaces are being transformed significantly In terms of skiling<br />
and flexibility.<br />
And Is not an accident, nor Is It an International phenomenon, that the transition Is being accomplished In a<br />
cooperative and peaceful way.<br />
it is the Accord.<br />
The Accord has delivered and it is continuing to deiiver.<br />
In Accord Viii the partners committed to the creation of 000,000 additional jobs up to March, 1999. This<br />
promise builds on the Accord VII commitment of 500,000 jobs in the three years after the 1993 election.<br />
The time Is nealy up and already 720,000 jobs have been created.<br />
In this Accord the ACTU and the Government also committed to a 2-3 percent rate of underline Inflation on<br />
average over the course of the cycle. It Is unprecedented to have a union movement endorsing an Inflation<br />
target of the Central Bank.<br />
This Accord also supported a Special Case being brought before the Commission for teachers and nurses<br />
who had been unable to obtain wage justice from conservative State Governments.<br />
What would have happened to teachers' pay without the Accord and capacity Of the Commission to<br />
Intervene when pay and conditions are being eroded by Governments not sympathetic to teachers? A large<br />
number of people in this room would be much worse off without this process.<br />
We shouldn't forget the micro-economnic reforms underway In Australian workplaces, with an emphasis on<br />
collective bargaining at the enterprise level. Well over half of all federal omployoes are now on<br />
agreements, many of them extremely Innovative. And the number Is growing quickly.<br />
Workplace agreements collectively bargained are only possible If the total value of the award conditions<br />
Is not reduced.<br />
This Is the real " no disadvantage" test, In which the agreements are closely scrutinised by the highly expert<br />
and respected Industrial Relations Commission before they become law.<br />
The process of certifying agreements Is a public one. Agreements are negotiated collectively; union<br />
representation Is welcomed; no Individuals have to bargain by themselves with the employer. There Is not a<br />
large powor imbalance and industrial relations inspectors are checking that agreements are fair and legal in<br />
practice. Every worker Is protected. The system looks after those whose bargaining position Is weak. It Is fair and Is<br />
seen to be.<br />
These Issues and more are described, explained and analysed In the Government document Flexibilty and<br />
Fairness at Work, which I am launching today with the minister for industrial Relations, Laurie Brereton. </p>
<p>Flexibility and Fairness at Work is a broad statement of the Government's Industrial relations stance. We<br />
are very proud of it. We are confident it will reassure Australians that there is every reason to maintain our<br />
Industrial relations approach and institutions because this system delivers flexible change and protects<br />
workers. So, in summary, what do we get with the Accord? Industrial stability, a highly effective macro-economic<br />
Instrument to deliver low Inflationary economic and employment growth, a framework for protected<br />
workplace reform. A tested and proved way of operating.<br />
Why would we want to put our social and economic security at risk by throwing it out?<br />
What else does John Howard really want in Industrial relations?<br />
One thing is not In doubt. He has been absolutely consistent in advocating radical change for the Australian<br />
labour market.<br />
It has been one of the few things we could rely on. As he said himself in July last year:<br />
" As you know, of all the Issues I have been committed to over the last ten years, none has boen<br />
more important, none has been more prominent, than my absolute commitment to the need to free<br />
Australia's Industrial relations system."<br />
If he's said It once, he's said it a hundred times. He must have said it a dozen times last year.<br />
When economic policy reforms have been accepted as being good for the country, he has always said<br />
things like, " yes but they won't do the most important thing they won't change our inflexible wages system".<br />
John Howard has always stood for one thing: he wants Australia to be a low labour cost country. He wants<br />
employers to have the upper hand with workers, because he says work contracts should be negotiated<br />
Individually and not collectively.<br />
Any fair assessment of his record leads Inexorably to this conclusion only: he wants workers' pay and<br />
conditions to be cut.<br />
How do we know this to be true?<br />
As Treasurer in 1982 he Initiated the wages freeze which ensured that the real value of workers' pay would<br />
fall. He has opposed riot been quiet about, not Ignored, he has opposed every proposed wage increase for<br />
Australian worker's since 1978, bar two.<br />
He wrote Jobsback! for the last election in which there were no protections for workers, and no way of<br />
guaranteeing workers' pay and conditions. Hie has said on several occasions since the 1993 election that<br />
Jobsbeck' was the right policy. He said it right up until I11 days ago.<br />
He has referred to overtime and penalty rates as " absurd job destroying imposts", and told us for a decade<br />
or more that labour market flexibility is the modern approach for Australia. Not having Governments, or<br />
unions, Or Commissions Involved in industrial relations Is his panacea, his holy grail.<br />
He looks with envy and admiration to the New Zealand changes in industrial relations which have totally<br />
removed the awards and pushed workers into individual contracts.<br />
The Victorian approach to Industrial relations, In which there have been significant pay reductions for<br />
Victorian State award workers, he describes as excellent policy.<br />
When 400,000 Victorian workers chose to move to the federal award system to escape, he has said less<br />
and less about how good the Victorian model Is. But Jeff Kennett has said that with a Howard government,<br />
these people would have " nowhere to hide".<br />
John Howard has said that the Western Australian State industrial relations system is his preferred model.<br />
For West Australian workers there are individual contracts with just a few minimum conditions, and the<br />
certainty that employers can reduce pay legally. </p>
<p>8<br />
He advocated a youth wage of $ 3 an hour in the last election, and has only dropped it now because he<br />
argues that it Is hard to explain the benefits. Nevertheless, he says that it is right.<br />
He continually attacks the Government for its active support of the Accord, the Industrial Relations<br />
Commission, and bargaining processes that protect workers.<br />
And, with these views and this line of attack, he is essentially saying two things: that ' flexibility" meaning<br />
pay cuts Is the solution; and that he is not prepared to support a system which genuinely protects the pay<br />
and conditions of workers.<br />
The finest policy contribution that could be made by government in John Howard's view is the " freeing up"<br />
of the labour market with its attendant pay cuts and loss of conditions.<br />
Simply, he wants another, way.<br />
It Is his deepest philosophical commitment, the definition and framework of his policy position his reason<br />
for being.<br />
But then a strange thing happened just 11 days ago.<br />
In the speech to the Young Liberals Annual Convention on January 8 he announced a complete change in<br />
his direction. He said things he had never said or thought, or felt, or countenanced for a moment in his<br />
entire political career.<br />
What was his oldest anathema suddenly became his newest desideratumn.<br />
He said things that he had fought against in the Liberal party back rooms for a decade. Among young<br />
Liberals at least the very young it might not have raised a youthful eyebrow. But old Liberals must have<br />
been reaching for the smelling salts, and in boardrooms across the country the level of whiskey bottles fell<br />
by an average 8 centimetres.<br />
Had their man gone mad? They give him one last chance and this is what he does.<br />
" Under a Howard Government you cannot be worse off but you can be better off", he said. " I give this rock<br />
solid guarantee", he said. " Our policy will not cause a cut in the take-home pay of Australians", he said.<br />
He then went on to outl ine some changes to the Industrial relations system, including listing 10 so-called<br />
minimum conditions of employment. One of these was that take-home pay would be at least the same as<br />
the value of the award conditions.<br />
How could this amazing turn-around be understood?<br />
Has he radically changed? Have his previous commitments and principles now gone?<br />
Is he entitled to be believed?<br />
By the time they got the corks back In the bottles In the boardrooms and the beter clubs, they knew the<br />
answer and were reassured.<br />
They knew that this new system of his can't and won't actually deliver what he says. They knew that he still<br />
wants radical changes and his new system will deliver this.<br />
That instead of being straight, like Dr Hewson was, it can all be achieved by stealth. That his speech was a<br />
ruse. The truth is, he still wants radical change.<br />
It i5 simply not credible that John Howard, by his own definition the most conservative Liberal leader ever,<br />
has now become an advocate of worker protections in the labour market.<br />
He Is not entitled to be believed. </p>
<p>And if he is not entitled to be believed he is weak, because he doesn't have the courage to stand up for and<br />
argue his beliefs.<br />
And if he still wants radical labour market reform but seek it by Stealth, then he is sneaky.<br />
John Howard won't be the first Liberal leader to promise no reductions in workers remuneration and then cut<br />
pay and conditions Immediately on winning government. In fact, It's becoming quite fashionable.<br />
Jeff Kennett was the first in recent times. He said Victorian workers will not suffer " any loss of wages and<br />
conditions", but then abolished all State awards and took away holiday loadings.<br />
Richard Court was next, saying he was no Jeff Kennett and that workers had " nothing to fear. When<br />
elected, he out youth wages to $ 3.77 an hour and removed all Income guarantees from the Western<br />
Australian system.<br />
John Howard's promise that " under Coalition policy... . employees cannot be worse off* has a very familiar<br />
ring. Kennett, Court and Howard have one thing strongly in common: an absolute conviction that labour mariket<br />
change for which read lower wages is essential.<br />
It is more than just the comparison with his fellow Liberals that tells us that Howard is not entitled to be<br />
believed. It is the process of his new system that will make It Inevitable.<br />
Under the proposed system the Industrial Relations Commission will be made redundant. There will be no<br />
public testing or assessment of the fairness of contracts. Workers will have to bargain, as Individuals, with<br />
the employer.<br />
The Australian Workplace Agreement will be filed and that just means put in a cabinet with the new socalled<br />
Employment Advocate, It will not be looked at unless the worker asks for this to be so.<br />
Let's think about the circumstances in which a worker would ask for an inspection of their contract.<br />
If asked to sign an Australian Workplace Agreement would a job applicant say, " let me show It to the union,<br />
or to a lawyer first", when they know that some other more compliant applicant will then get the job? The<br />
answer is, of course not. Job applicants will have no effective choice.<br />
Thus job mobility will ensure that the system must quickly and Inevitably reflect the law of the jungle. Under<br />
the Coalition's approach new workers will be forced onto agreements that will not be scrutinised by an<br />
effective or even expert body.<br />
And job mobility is a huge Issue. Over 1.7 million workers face a new employer each year. 400,000<br />
married women returning to work; 250,000 tertiary education graduates; several hundred thousand year I11<br />
and 12 leavers; and 600,000 workers who change jobs every year.<br />
In 1994 a total of 28,258 school teachers took a job with a new employee 7675 men and 18583 women.<br />
Some of them might be sitting in this room. That's over 10 per cent of all teachers each year without any<br />
effective protection.<br />
The system will change radically, and quickly, because somebody wanting a job will sign up even if they are<br />
unhappy with the contract. And no one apart from the worker and the employer will know what has<br />
transpired because, as In Victoria and Western Australia, the contracts will be secret.<br />
Existing employees are also not going to challenge their employer if they think the contract Is unfair. This<br />
would amount to publicly questioning the employers honesty and credibility.<br />
The employer can make this costly in all sorts of ways by not offering overtime hours, by not all owing<br />
holidays when they are wanted, by not giving promotions, and even by the sack under the Coalition's<br />
changed unfair dismissals laws. You'd have to be a mug to want to take on the boss publicly In this way. </p>
<p>And why would an Individual worker bother to bring a complaint to the Employment Advocate when it has no<br />
judicial power, and no way of enforcing a decision, other than to take it to court where it Gould stay for many<br />
months, and where the outcome is uncertain?<br />
Even if the Workplace Agreement seems unthreatening at first, the Coalition has no process to up-date<br />
them, and says that even if the awards are Improved this will not effect tihe Workplace Agreement. So over<br />
time the Agreements must become of lower value, with no mechanism to alter this, and no right for a worker<br />
to strike if an employer changes any aspect of them.<br />
John Howard knows all this. And so do his political supporters.<br />
It is instructive that neither the BCA nor the ACCI took John Howard to task for his appaient conversion to<br />
the cause of worker protection. It is instructive that Jeff Kennett and the WA industrial relations Minister,<br />
Kierath, both applauded Howard's policy announcement even though on paper It contradicts much of what<br />
they stand for.<br />
The reason is that conservative business groups and other Liberals know what John Howard knows: he can<br />
achieve by stealth exactly what he and they have always wanted.<br />
The conservatives saw the meaning of John Howard's speech, knowing It to be a ruse, camouflage from a<br />
leader without the leadership to admit where he wants to take Australia.<br />
Camouflage from a leader who won't stand and articulate that which he passionately believes.<br />
The bottom line is that John Howard Is committed to radical labour market change nothing Is clearer. But<br />
he has now also revealed himself as someone who is prepared to publicly repudiate his most strongly held<br />
position because he knows that, properly understood, his industrial relations policy would lose him the<br />
election. He Is willing to wear the charge that he stands for nothing because he hopes to win by cunning what he has<br />
never won by advocacy.<br />
Under Howard's system wages must fail. Conditions must be lost. And It will all happen quickly because<br />
the labour market has so much mobility, and it is the new job takers who will be most disadvantaged initially.<br />
But, over time, everybody will be affected.<br />
The question Is why do it? Why throw away the Accord and put in place a system that must cut pay and<br />
conditions and take away basic rights of workers?<br />
It can't be for profits. Industrial peace, jobs or Inflation. And it's not for productivity as the dismal<br />
performance of New Zealand has shown,<br />
It can only be because he wants a radically different Australia, with considerably more employer power and<br />
considerably less employee protections.<br />
It can only be because he wants a low wage cost country. Make no mistake, this obsession still rules him.<br />
Under John Howard's arrangements the Australian industrial system will be changed In favour of employers,<br />
the bargaining will swing In their favour, the onus will fall on Individual workers and as a recent poll<br />
indicates, they know workers' Incomes will be cut.<br />
The real John Howard won't be standing up in this election, but we've seen enough from the last quarter<br />
century to know exactly what to expect.<br />
He will leave education to the States. He will leave the wages and conditions of Australian workers not to<br />
the IRC and the system of awards and the principle of no disadvantage but to the law of the jungle and the<br />
survival of the fittest.<br />
With the processes of his industrial relations system his rock-solid guarantee of workers take home pay Is a<br />
sham and a ruse. </p>
<p>11<br />
With John Howard we have once again reached a fork In the road. His path leads Inexorably to a reduced<br />
social wage, reduced educational opportunity, the end of the Accord, and the end of an industrial relations<br />
system which levels up the playing field of our national life.<br />
Since I last spoke to you, we have had three highly productive years. There have been major economic and<br />
social reforms. We have maintained the environment of cooperation and tolerance which has taken us so<br />
far in recent years. In 1996, just about the only thing which hasn't changed for the better is the Coalition.<br />
Even the recent change in rhetoric is no change if you remember this time in 1993, they were attempting<br />
to sell a new cuddly version of Fightback.<br />
We are seeing it all again. And with your support, we will see the same result at the election.<br />
ends </p>
