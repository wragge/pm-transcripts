E. O. E. PROOF ONLYV<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
INTERVIEW WITH LAURIE OAKES, GOOD MORNING AUSTRALIA, 12 JANUARY 19.84<br />
LA-. Mr Hawke, thanks for appearing on Good Morning Australia.<br />
What sort of a break have you had over the holidays?<br />
RJH: Good break, Laurie, I had a fortnight, a complete break, at the<br />
end of December when I handed over to Lionel, as Acting Prime Minister,<br />
saw a bit of tennis and cricket in that period, and then from the<br />
1st of January, up until next Sunday I'm working here out of<br />
1irribilli, so I suppose you could say that's second gear, it's<br />
working, but its a slightly better environment than Canberra.<br />
LA: You ( were looking a bit tired at the end of last year, have<br />
you got the batteries recharged for the new year?<br />
RJH: Absolutely, yes.<br />
LA: Will it be a big year?<br />
RJH: 1 think it will be a big year for Australia. The economy's<br />
going -to be in very good shape, Laurie, growing at a fast rate,<br />
a very big turnaround, more job opportunities, more opportunities for<br />
busineas. I think its going to be a big year economically, its<br />
going t-be a pretty interesting one politically too, I think.<br />
LA: Yos well because its a good year economically, does that mean<br />
there': Ll be an election?<br />
RJH: Oh that's not why there may be an election. I've made it<br />
quite clear wheni the. Senate rejected our proposals about the<br />
refereridums . that we would have to look at that situation in the<br />
light of the fact that there must be a half-Senate election, as<br />
you know, between the middle of this year and the middle of next<br />
year. If there were to be such an election, it would be, not out<br />
of kilter, I haven't looked exactly Laurie, at the history of this,<br />
but my recollection is that it would be if such an election were<br />
held at: the end of this year or early next year it would be about<br />
the 22n~ d election of that type half-Senate and House of<br />
Represontatives elections are a comp~ etely normal thing to happen<br />
but we're not committing ourselves at this point. I'll be wanting<br />
to see what's necessary to reduce the number of elections to get<br />
back into kilter the Senate and the House of Representatives.<br />
LA: Well assuming that it may be an election year, will it be<br />
an election budget?<br />
RJH: Ah we don't operate that way. It will be the budget which is<br />
necessary to do these sorts of things. Firstly, to consolidate the<br />
very substantial economic recovery that's been associated with our<br />
government. And secondly and very importantly to sustain the<br />
prices and incomes accord, we'll. be looking in 1984, Laurie, at<br />
fairly low inflation rates and that means fairly low levels of<br />
wage increases. And if we can sustain a cut in taxes, which is what<br />
I want to do anyway, then that will be done for economic purposes<br />
and for industrial purposes. The fact that that will be I think,<br />
what the people would want, and what we'd hoped to do in 1983 </p>
<p>-2-<br />
we cou: ldn't because of the deficit we inherited is a plus<br />
Politically, obviously.<br />
LA: Well how likely is it that you will be able to cut taxes?<br />
You sound as if its definitely on.<br />
RJH: The intention's there. It's too early to be able to tell<br />
how the budget figuring is going yet. We'll get that sort of<br />
information in February/ March when we see how both the expenditure<br />
and the income sides are going, Laurie.<br />
LA: Are you talking about tax cuts for everybody or people in<br />
need? RJH: Well obviously we'd be wanting to try and get the greater<br />
relevant benefit to the lower income groups, but what you can do<br />
would depend upon the two things that I've been talking about,<br />
what's happening to the your revenue, what's happening to your<br />
outlays. Because associated with the desire to cut taxes Laurie,<br />
will be also an intention to haul back in the deficit. And I<br />
want to achieve both those objectives and our capacity to do it<br />
is not something that I can say to you now in January well,<br />
we've got that capacity or that capacity. We must wait a little<br />
bit longer before we see the figures.<br />
LA: What about the election promise to raise pensions to<br />
of average weekly earnings? Is that on this year?<br />
RJH: Oh we didn't say we'd do it in one year.<br />
Lh: Y'ou said in 3 years I think, but if you're facing an election<br />
at the end of the year, that's your first term isn't it?<br />
RJU: Yes, but it's not 3 years. We will be doing what we can to<br />
improve the pension position and again, it would be irresponsible<br />
of me in January of 1984 to say what we'll be able to do at the<br />
end cf this year. But I can say this in January of 1984, that<br />
our commitment to try and see that expenditures aren't wasted on<br />
those of as-in the community who don't need public pension benefits<br />
is relevant to our capacity to act in the area of pensions generally.<br />
LA: So you're still committed to needs-based welfare even though<br />
that has a potential to make you unpopular, I mean the assets test,<br />
obviously, its going to cause a problem isn't it?<br />
TJH: Yes and-it's relevant to the sort of question you're asking<br />
about:. Are we going to be doing certain things for popularity reasons.<br />
We're going to be making the decisions which are necessary for the<br />
benefit of the country as a whole and I have no doubt, as does any<br />
economist in this country, or anyone who knows anything about<br />
the demography of Australia or the social welfare structure. None<br />
of us have any doubt that if Australia is going to be able, as we<br />
go towards the end of the 20th century to look after those in the<br />
community who need help, then we have to be prepared to cut back ./ 3 </p>
<p>-3-<br />
on those of us who don't need help. Take my own case, the Prime<br />
minister of Australia on very high income relatively. Now until<br />
we income tested the over-70' s pensions, I would have been entitled,<br />
if we'd left it all as it was, as well as getting my very generous<br />
superannuation, to dip in and grab a pension as well.<br />
LA: X think one of your predecessors in fact....<br />
RJH: I didn't want to do to that extent, but that's exactly what<br />
happens. Now that's wrong. I mean, there's no justification for<br />
me grabbing a pension out of the public funds as well as having<br />
a general superannuation. In regard to the assets test, using my<br />
case, let's say I'd retired and I'd converted my income into assets<br />
and had no income, and so I'd put myself into a position of being<br />
able to get a public pension. Now that's damn stupid. Why should<br />
I get that. And the real issue that's confronting us is, that<br />
we are an ageing population, and as we get to the end of this century,<br />
there's going to be a smaller proportion of people in the population<br />
who are at work, having an obligation to support more and more<br />
older people. Now if you're going to do that generously and sensibly,<br />
then those of us who don't need help from the public purse, shouldn't<br />
be getting it.<br />
LA: it could cost you a lot of votes, though, couldn't it?<br />
RJH: Well it may do, but I have more faith in the Australian public<br />
than that. I think that when we explain the purpose of what we're<br />
about. and the impact of it, a relatively small number of people<br />
who will be adversely affected and the fact that we do this will<br />
mean that we as a community, not just as a government, but as a<br />
commuLnity, will be better able to look after those who do need help.<br />
And 1: have sufficient faith in my fellow Australians to believe that<br />
they will understand that, and they'll accept it, and indeed they'll<br />
applaud it.<br />
LA: You mentioned your commitment to the prices and incomes accord<br />
with the unions which brings us to the vexed question of<br />
ParliLamentarian's salaries, the South Australian and Tasmanian<br />
situation. You've written to all Premiers.<br />
RJH: Yes, I did that yesterday Laurie. And essentially what I've<br />
said to them are these things. That the maintenance of the accord<br />
is important for all Australians, its certainly important for<br />
State Governments. Because our capacity as a Federal Government to<br />
give to the States, as much as we can at the time of the Premiers'<br />
Conference, the Loan Council, to help them do the things they need,<br />
depends upon an economy working as efficiently as it can. And the<br />
accord is very important. Now the second thing is, as I've said<br />
well the 4.3 percent, there should be no question about that we<br />
should have that as an interim increase and then Parliamentarians<br />
should do as the trade unions are required to do that is, that ./ 4 </p>
<p>-4-<br />
there are special circumstances existing because of what they haven't<br />
got ove~ r an extended period of time, inrespect of community standards,<br />
then they ought to put that case to their tribunals, and if they<br />
haven't got tribunals, then they ought to establish them. And in<br />
those -tribunals the same test ought to be applied as is applied to<br />
workers generally. And that's what I've put to them. I hope that<br />
they will follow that.<br />
LA: Po you think they will?<br />
IRJf: Well I'm hopeaful. I have spoken with the Premier of South<br />
Australia where they do have a tribunal. I have told him what was<br />
in the letter, and I hope there will be a positive response. There<br />
ought to be because we've all of us got a vested interest whether<br />
we are: trade unionists, parliamentarians, businessmen, professional<br />
people!. We've all got the same interest. And that is that we<br />
have the highest level of economic growth with the lowest level of<br />
inflation. And the maintenance of the accord is critical to that.<br />
LA~: To what extent has the 141' s' salary issue threatened the<br />
accordl? RU: I don't think its threatened it, in the sense that it will<br />
break down, in fact I'm sure it hasn't done that. The ACTU<br />
leadeteship has been very responsible I think in the way that they<br />
have addressed themselves to this issue. Quite clearly though,<br />
those elements within the trade union movement, though small,<br />
but who would want to see for bad purposes, the accord break down,<br />
would use this as ammunition and that's why I think its important<br />
that if parliamentarians have a case for increases beyond 4.3 percent<br />
and the ACTU recognises that they may well have such a case, then<br />
they should do it in the'same way as the trade unions are required<br />
to do it, that is, to have the 4.3 percent,* and then go through<br />
what we call the anomaly process to show that they may have special<br />
circumstances which require movement beyond that 4.3 percent.<br />
LA: While you've been having your Xmas/ New Year break, Doug Anthony<br />
has announced that he is retiring, and it looks as though Ian Sinclair<br />
will be the new leader of the National Party. What effect do you<br />
think that will have on politics in 1984?<br />
RJI{: I think it will mean that there will be increased tension<br />
withiLn the coalition. I mean no disrespect to Doug Anthony, but<br />
I think you would agree, that since the election in March, he hasn't<br />
been a upfront, forceful figure, and Sinclair, if he gets the<br />
leadership, wi~. l be pushing not so much against us, because he's<br />
been trying to that anyrate, but the figure in his sights will be<br />
a cha~ p called Andrew, and that's already evident. All the signs<br />
are there, there'll be increased tensions on the opposite side,<br />
which if possible, will make their operations in Opposition even<br />
less effective than they were in 1983. 1 think it will be a very<br />
tough time for them, and I feel in respect of Mr Sinclair, that<br />
he is vulnerable, he has demonstrated his vulnerability. That's<br />
not going to diminish in 1984. 9*/ </p>
<p>LA: ' Vulnerable in what way?<br />
RJH:. Well I don't want to shoot off all the ammunition at this<br />
stage but you've been around the political scene a long time and<br />
you know in respect of his performance as a minister, there was<br />
a situation with a lot of question marks about his performances<br />
and I think he's the sort of person who shoots from the hip and<br />
creates his own vulnerability and I think that will be evident,<br />
. I would Iayizle, from hiib quite inexplicable performance of making<br />
those allegations at the end of 1983 about attempted bribery of him.<br />
That-was alleged to haveloccurred in 1979. Hie has made allegations<br />
which are the subject now of investigation. I don't think he'll<br />
come very well out of that. I<br />
LA: He's a tough customer though, isn't he? Are you concerned<br />
at the possibility that he could emerge as a leader of a combined,<br />
amalgamated Liberal/ National Party?... a conservative party?<br />
RJH: Not at all, not at all. Let me make two points about that.<br />
If he's to emerge as the leader of a combined non-Labor opposition<br />
that-means there's going to be a hell of a lot of blood and a hell<br />
of a lot of bodies strewn around the conservative carpets of this<br />
world, and that won't make for effectiveness. And secondly, the<br />
fact that you are a head-kicker, as he is, and is prepared to make<br />
unsubstantiable allegations and to do that in pretty ruthless fashion<br />
I don't think that impresses anyone.<br />
LA: ' What would you do if you were Andrew Peacock? Would you be<br />
worried about Ian Sinclair?<br />
RJH: Ah yes, I would take another layer of protective clothing around<br />
my back.<br />
LA: You've been fairly scornful about Andrew Peacock's performance,<br />
the Opposition's performance. If you were in their position what<br />
would you be doing. What could they do to be more effective?<br />
RJH: Well Laurie, I'm known as a generous character, and correctly.<br />
I am generous and charitable by nature. But I don't think its<br />
really for me to tell the opposition how to pick their game up.<br />
Perhaps in 10 years time, I might be prepared to give them a hint.<br />
LA; Well at the end of last year you said that you wanted Mick Young<br />
back in your Cabinet. And I think that's going to happen what the<br />
week after next, isn't it?<br />
RJH: Yes.<br />
LA: What will he have, what portfolio? Have you thought about th-at<br />
yet? RJH: I've thought about it, yes. But I think its appropriate to<br />
wait until the time. I'll publicly announce it. I joli'. t think<br />
there'll be many surprises. 0../ 6 </p>
<p>LA: Well its another way of asking the * same question I suppose.<br />
But aret you planning any sort of a reshuffle in your Cabinet,<br />
your Ministry, between now and the election or are you happy with<br />
it?<br />
RJH: I'm very happy with their performance. You know I've said.<br />
to you privately and I've said publicly that I think this has been<br />
an outs~ tandingly successful Ministry. I am sure that there hasn't<br />
been a ministry to equal it in the post-war period. That doesn't<br />
mean there hasn't been some minor mistakes of course there have been,<br />
but the quality of this Cabinet is remarkable, the breadth and the<br />
depth of it,, and it would therefore, in my judgment, be foolish<br />
Laurie, to talk about any. significant reshuffle.<br />
LA: Widi again I'm venturing close to asking the same question,<br />
but not really. Its been suggested that you will give Mick Young<br />
his old portfolio, but take away the sensitive areas of security,<br />
law enforcement. Is there a problem with Mick Young that way?<br />
Is the cloud still over his head?<br />
lRll: :, 1o of course there's no cloud over his head. The facts are<br />
simple. Mick made a mistake. He recognised it, he resigned.<br />
He served the penalty, a severe one. I've made a judgemnent and<br />
my colleagues have accepted my judgement, that it is appropriate<br />
for the government and for the country, to have his talents<br />
back in the Cabinet. And that involves, in recognition on my part<br />
and the part of my colleagues, that he-. is ready again to serve the<br />
country. Now in my judgment you don't have partial readiness.<br />
A man is ready or he's not.<br />
LA: What New Year's * resolutions have you....<br />
RJH: I'm not a maker of New Year's resolutions Laurie. I gave<br />
that up a long time ago, because its so artificial. it almost<br />
guarantees ineffectiveness. If you have to depend upon the calendar<br />
to comre round oh the first of January to reassess your performance, and<br />
say now I'll do something different, then you're guaranteeing your<br />
ineffectiveness. What you ought to be doing whether you're in<br />
politics, or whatever you're doing, engaged in, is to be constantly<br />
monitoring your performance. if you can see that something would<br />
be done better another way, then you do it.<br />
LA: But you must have a goal for the year, what do you want to<br />
achieve this year?<br />
RJH: That's a quite different question. Well, the main thing that<br />
I'm committed to, Laurie, is to make consistently, decisions which<br />
are going to consolidate the turnaround of the Australian economy.<br />
I recognise that in 1983 that we had good fortune in some respects<br />
for which we could not properly claim any credit: the breaking of<br />
the drought, the growth in the United States economy; but equally<br />
importantly, we made a series of co-ordinated decisions which in<br />
conjunction with those factors, strengthened the operation of the<br />
Australian economy. Now I want to see that we continue to make </p>
<p>-7-<br />
those s; orts of decisions so that growth continues at significant<br />
levels in 1984, and within that growth, to see that we get a more<br />
equitable Australia. That's my basic commitment, internally.<br />
ExternZally, I want to continue to build the recognition in the<br />
rest of' the world of the fact that this new Australian government<br />
is about courses of action which will be respected by the rest<br />
of the world. I think you would acknowledge that we have received<br />
that respect in a remarkably short term. There's lots of evidence<br />
of that. And I want to build on that. I will. be going as you<br />
know, at the end.-of this month, to Korea and Japan and China,<br />
Hong Kong and Singapore and Malaysia, and I believe that's a very<br />
important part of what I've just been talking about. We have to<br />
see that we build up an understanding within Australia, and within<br />
the region, of the fact that Australia is part of this region.<br />
We're not just an outpost of European civilisation, parked on the<br />
rim of South East Asia. We are part of it.<br />
LA: We read that you're planning some kind of a Pacific Basin<br />
trading pact.. Is that....?<br />
RJH: I think that overstates it, but I do believe that there is<br />
a need for a new round of GATT negotiations. The previous round<br />
didn't do justice in any way to the sorts of things,. commodities,<br />
which are of basic importance to us and to many other countries<br />
in the region. It makes sense to be able to have such a round in<br />
which there is a comprehensive dealing with the commodities entering<br />
into world trade. If that's not possible, then we as a region would<br />
be looking as to how we can develop effectively trade between<br />
ourselves. Now again, as characterised in 1983, the first year of<br />
our govarnment I'm not trying to overstate what we can do, but I can<br />
say this, that in the preliminary soundings-out that we've been doing,<br />
with othier countries in this region, we are seeing some very positive<br />
reactions to the sorts of suggestions that we're making. So one<br />
part of the visit that I'll be making will be to try and build upon<br />
those initial suggestions because it is very important to Australia<br />
that we build up trade in this region, and we are singularly fortunate<br />
and cha! llenged at the one time, to be part of the fastest-growing<br />
economic region in the world. And the future of our children depends<br />
veryrnuch on making sure that we can get the greatest benefit out of<br />
and involvement in that development. And that's what we'll be about.<br />
LA: Thanks Mr Hawke,.<br />
RJH: Thanks a lot. </p>
