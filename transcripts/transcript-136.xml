STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES<br />
CONCERNING THE APPOINTMENT OF THE NEi GOVERNOR-GENERAL.<br />
THURSDAY. 12th NOVIm'BER. 1959.<br />
As Honourable Members know, our present Governor-<br />
General, Field Marshal Sir William Slim, will be returning to<br />
England towards the end of January next after what we all feel<br />
to be a very distinguished term of office in our country. Before<br />
he leaves we will have an opportunity of saying to him some of<br />
those things that are in our hearts and minds and I will therefore<br />
not anticipate them tonight.<br />
The immediate purpose of my intervention is to say that<br />
after communications with Her Majesty the Queen, orally when I<br />
was in London and subsequently in writing, Her Majesty has been<br />
graciously pleased on my advice as Australian Prime Minister to<br />
name as the new Governor-General of Australia, the Right Honourable<br />
William Shepherd Morrison, the retiring Speaker of the House of<br />
Commons. MLr. Morrison has served as Speaker for nine years with<br />
capacity and dignity and, as is well known, to the great satisfaction<br />
of all political parties. He therefore has had a rich experience<br />
in a great office which has called for marked ability and impartiality.<br />
He was born and educated in Scotland. He served in the<br />
First World War in the Royal Field Artillery. In the course of<br />
his service, he was awarded the Mviilitary Cross; he was wounded<br />
and he wns three times mentioned in despatches. He practised at<br />
the English Bar from 1923. He became one of His Majesty's Counsel<br />
in 1934. He entered the House of Commons where, between 1935 and<br />
19) 5 he had considerable ministerial experience. He visited<br />
Australia some years back as a member of the United Kingdom<br />
Delegation to the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association which met<br />
in New Zealand and subsequently had meetings in Canberra.<br />
All who know him will agree with me that he is a man of<br />
remarkable character and talent, of singular devotion to public duty,<br />
and of a personality which will be widely appreciated in Australia.<br />
I am, therefore, privileged to be able to inform the House that Her<br />
Majesty is this evening announcing his appointment. I should add<br />
without, I hope, impertinence, that Her Majesty is herself most happy<br />
about the appointment, which has given her great personal satisfaction.<br />
I should add that Her IMajesty has been pleased to raise<br />
Mr. Morrison to the peerage under the name and style of VISCOUNT<br />
DUNROSSIL. Canberra, 12th November, 1959. </p>
