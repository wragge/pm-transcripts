FORPRESS 21 AUGUST 1977<br />
FUJRTHER _ IZNCENTIVESFOR-THE ARTS<br />
The Pri-me Minister, Mr Malcolm Fraser, said today that the<br />
Budget decision to liberalise existing taxation concessions<br />
on gifts to public art galleries, libraries and m~ useums was<br />
a significant step for art in Australia.<br />
In the past a person could claim on a gift only if he had<br />
acquired it in the last twelve months, or if it was cash.<br />
The twelve months test will now be removed. This move will<br />
encourage owners of older collections of art works to make<br />
gifts to public galleries.<br />
The amount allowable as a deduction will generally be the<br />
market value of the gi-ft at -the time it is donated instead<br />
of -the lesser of purchase value or market value. It is<br />
hoped that these reforms will increase and diversify arts<br />
patronage by the community.<br />
The Prime Minis-ter said -that by taking this action the<br />
Government had removed the single most significant factor<br />
which had been holding back the development of public<br />
gallery collections.<br />
Mr Fraser stressed the benefits in particular to State and<br />
Regional. galleries and hoped that the States might act to<br />
remove remaining barriers to increased private patronage.<br />
Legislation to effect the new arts incentive scheme will be<br />
introduced this session of Parliament. The new tax provisions<br />
will come into operation for a trial period of three years<br />
on 1 January, 1978. The scheme will come under the<br />
responsibility of the Minister for Administrative Services.<br />
Further detailis will be announced later. </p>
