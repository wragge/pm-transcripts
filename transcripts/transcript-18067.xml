Prime Minister Julia Gillard and Member for Brand Gary Gray today officially opened new facilities worth more than $2.5 million at Perth's Bertram Primary School, funded through the Commonwealth Government's Building the Education Revolution.</p>
<p>The five-classroom early childhood block and enclosed covered assembly area were funded under the Primary Schools for the 21st Century and National School Pride elements of BER.</p>
<p>These are essential facilities for a fast growing suburban school whose enrolments have more than doubled since it opened in 2007.</p>
<p>The classrooms are providing new learning environments for children from pre-primary to Year 3, as well as a much needed work room for teachers.</p>
<p>Enclosing the existing undercover area is allowing the school to use the space for a broader variety of activities.</p>
<p>Bertram Primary received $2.5 million under the Primary Schools for the 21st Century (P21) element of BER for the new classrooms and enclosing the undercover area, plus $150,000 under the National School Pride (NSP) program for refurbishments including painting and paving.</p>
<p>BER is a key element of the Government's $42 billion Nation Building  -  Economic Stimulus Plan to support jobs, stimulate local economies and invest in important infrastructure for the long term.</p>
<p>The $1.28 billion NSP program is providingfunding to more than 9,400 eligible schools in every state and territory for minor infrastructure and refurbishment.</p>
<p>The $14.1 billion P21 has delivered funding to over 7,900 eligible primary schools across Australia for major new infrastructure.</p>
<p>In Western Australia, 97 per cent of BER projects worth a total of more than $1.8 billion are now complete. The program has funded almost 3,000 projects across the state.</p>
<p>Facilities like these at Bertram not only benefit the school  -  they support stronger social networks and community cohesion.</p>
<p>This project has also supported the employment of local workers, the essence of the Economic Stimulus Plan.</p>
<p>Further information about this project and all schools funded under the BER is available at <a href="http://www.buildingtheeducationrevolution.gov.auor">www.buildingtheeducationrevolution.gov.auor</a> at: <a href="http://www.economicstimulusplan.gov.au">www.economicstimulusplan.gov.au</a>. </p>
