FOR PRESS: P. M. No. 79. 1968<br />
RENAMING OF U. S. NAVAL COMMUNICATION<br />
STATION AT N. W. CAPE<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister, Mr. John Gorton<br />
The United States Communication Station at North West<br />
Cape will be renamed next month in honour of the former Prime<br />
Minister, Mr. Harold Holt.<br />
The ceremony will take place on 20 September, within a<br />
few days of the first anniversary of the official opening of the Station.<br />
( This was attended by Mr. Holt on 16 September 1967.)<br />
Dame Zara Holt will be Guest of Honour at the renaming<br />
ceremony, and will unveil a memorial designating the station as the<br />
" United States Naval Communication Station, Harold E. Holt".<br />
The American Ambassador will represent President<br />
Johnson and will read a message from the President. I will also be<br />
attending the ceraEn ony.<br />
The renaming of the Station by the U. S. Government is<br />
a gesture much appreciated by Australia. It is yet another indication<br />
of America's high regard for Harold Holt who, in his relatively short<br />
term as Prime Minister, did so much to strengthen the bonds of<br />
friendship between our two countries.<br />
