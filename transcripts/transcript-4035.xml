F76/ 11<br />
FOR PRESS January 26, 1976<br />
OLYMPIC APPEAL<br />
The Prime Minister made the following broadcast today to support the appeal<br />
of the Australian Olympic Federation.<br />
The olympic ideal is one of the most noble of human aspirations. It is a<br />
competitive challenge, not only for the athletes, but for Australia itself,<br />
to send its best to this year's Montreal Olympic Games in July.<br />
Athletes from more than 120 nations have responded to the invitation and<br />
w-ill compete in events which will be watched by the world's largest T. V.<br />
audience. It is estimated that 1,200 million people will watch the opening<br />
ceremony. The games bring together people from all nations who compete both as<br />
individuals, and for the honour of their countries.<br />
Australia has always been among the ten most successful olympic nations,<br />
and at the 1955 Melbourne Games, we ranked third as medal winners.<br />
I am advised by the Olympic Federation that our sportsmen have good<br />
prospects again this year.<br />
In all democratic countries, support for the Olympic Movement is a<br />
traditional responsibility on people and firms. It ensures freedom of<br />
selection and a stricter observance of the amateur customs and precepts<br />
upon which sporting programmes at the Olympic Games have always been based. / 2 </p>
<p>The total cost of Australia's winter and summer games teams is<br />
$ 800,000. Of this amount, the Australian Government has made available<br />
$ 250,000, representing air travel and transportation costs. State<br />
Governments are also making substantial donations leaving approximately<br />
half a million dollars to be raised through private donations.<br />
The response so far has been a source of great encouragement to our<br />
young athletes. It highlights a responsible interest in Australia's<br />
image on this great international occasion.<br />
A promotional campaign to encourage commerce and industry to support the<br />
appeal through the licensing of a special Olympic Symbol has brought<br />
some generous donations.<br />
Whilst this is particularly warming to see, we still require many<br />
thousands of dollars to meet the target and send our best possible<br />
team to Montreal. I am asking you to give this great Australian cause<br />
your personal consideration.<br />
On past performances, Australia's Olympic Team members nave justified<br />
their selection and the support given by the public. I am confident<br />
that 1976 will be no exception and that the performance of our athletes<br />
in Montreal will justify once again our confidence.<br />
I hope that your support will be generous.<br />
