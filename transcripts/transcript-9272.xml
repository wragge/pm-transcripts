TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
AND THE PRIME MINISTER OF NEW ZEALAND, THE HON J B BOLGER<br />
MP, DOORSTOP, PARLIAMENT HOUSE, CANBERRA,<br />
WEDNESDAY, 6 JULY 1994<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
PM: I might say a few things first and invite the Prime Minister to also say a<br />
couple of words. I would like to begin by saying I am very pleased to<br />
see the Prime Minister in Australia. We've had a very good and useful<br />
talk this morning for quite a long time, ranging over a number of<br />
subjects, and we've just had lunch with members of the Cabinet and<br />
we'll be meeting further this afternoon. We had a very useful<br />
discussion about our role, our joint role, in the Asia-Pacific, about<br />
_ 4PEC, about the prospects for APEC, how the debate's going, how it's<br />
developing, about the development of further linkages between<br />
Australia and New Zealand and the ASEAN group of. countries,<br />
particularly in their free-trade area, AFTA, a-nd potential linkages, or<br />
the prospects I suppose you'd say, of linkages between AFTA and<br />
CER, and how we might best progress that discussion, what value we<br />
see in it for ourselves, how we might participate. We discussed then<br />
some bilateral issues I think we agreed that the relationship between<br />
Australia and New Zealand is in very good shape we just dealt with a<br />
couple of issues in the last year that were around for a while, that was<br />
an agreement on Social Security payments, we've just come to a<br />
settlement over compensation payments to Nauru Island and then we<br />
went on to have a discussion about the trans-Tasman aviation market<br />
and also about audio-visuals, and the capacity to enter this market with<br />
the appropriate accreditations for products, audio-visual products<br />
made in New Zealand. I think that's it in a nutshell, and I'll invite the<br />
Prime Minister to add to those remarks.<br />
JB: Certainly, and good afternoon. I just want to confirm what Prime<br />
Minister Keating has said that the discussions were very constructive,<br />
they were warm. I think the fact that we spent a lot of our time on<br />
regional issues APEC, the forum, links between, or possible links<br />
between the ASEAN free-trade agreement and CER demonstrates<br />
that the relationship between the two is a very mature relationship<br />
between New Zealand and Australia, and there are not many<br />
additional items that attract immediate attention that we have to deal<br />
t </p>
<p>2<br />
with. There are some that are on-going that Prime Minister Keating<br />
has touched on the aviation issue, TV quotas, audio-visuals and the<br />
like delighted that when we do come together we can progress some<br />
of these issues and that, as the Prime Minister said, last year we had<br />
to resolve the issue, or make progress on the issue, of Social Security<br />
compensation to Australia for New Zealanders that were here. We've<br />
been able to do that, we've been able to reach the agreement<br />
necessary on compensation to Nauru, so it's been very good. If I say<br />
it's the type of meeting I think we should have on a regular basis, as<br />
we've agreed. No great fuss or bother, we just sit down, discuss one<br />
or two issues that are important to both countries and that are<br />
important to our region. So that's what we've been doing.<br />
J: Did you discuss the twin republics, and if so, what was said?<br />
PM: No, we didn't.<br />
JB: No.<br />
J: Why not?<br />
PM: Well, we had other things to discuss, that was the point.<br />
J: Did you discuss the single aviation market? Did you make any<br />
progress?<br />
JB: I believe we did. We discussed, of course, the single aviation market<br />
when Prime Minister Keating was in New Zealand last year. I think<br />
what we would agree is that we haven't seen enough progress on it<br />
and there are some quite valid reasons why it's been difficult to<br />
advance, but we do want to see it advance, even though there are<br />
difficulties. So we want to see that. We know there is some issues to<br />
be resolved, that flow from the Memorandum of Understanding, and all<br />
of that. So we've had quite a good discussion.<br />
J: What are New Zealand's views on that?<br />
JB: Well, Air New Zealand's got a view as to what on-rights should be<br />
available to it, and the like. There's obviously two views on it.<br />
J: Mr Keating, what are Australia's problems.. . with a single aviation<br />
market?<br />
PM: Well, I think we see, I mean, Australia and New Zealand have moved a<br />
long way with an open product market. We haven't been as successful<br />
in services. As you remember, the former government of New Zealand<br />
sold Telecom New Zealand to a couple of American companies, and<br />
we haven't had the integration in electronic communication, and<br />
telecommunications, that we might have otherwise had, and I think we </p>
<p>are therefore more mindful of how we need to progress and succeed in<br />
doing something similar, that is successfully, with air transport. There<br />
are a lot of balls in the air at the moment with air transport, we've got<br />
the government of Australia's intention to sell Qantas, and a float<br />
coming up. We've got Ansett now emerging as an international carrier<br />
and stabilising its domestic balance sheet and its domestic services;<br />
and Air New Zealand's participation in the Australian Market and a<br />
view about what sort of airline system Australasia needs to service it in<br />
the long run. Now, I think they are fairly complex issues and they're<br />
not really open for, sort of, simple resolutions.<br />
J: Mr Bolger, is it possible for a conservative leader to be in favour of a<br />
republi[ c? And, the way the debate is going in Australia do you think<br />
New Zealand might beat us to a republic?<br />
JB: Despite, I'm sure, your ambition or the Australian Press Gallery's<br />
ambition to embroil me in the Australian debate, I don't intend to get in<br />
it. Can I just say, in answer to your query, that I have set out a view<br />
that New Zealand will eventually follow. I have set no particular time<br />
frame on it and it is a view that is now being discussed in New Zealand<br />
with no particular heat. I have set out my views on the issue, I know<br />
there have been views set out here in Australia but I don't intend to get<br />
into those ones.<br />
J: Mr Keating, do you think New Zealand might beat us to a republic?<br />
PM: Well, I don't know, that is a matter for New Zealand. I think the Prime<br />
Minister has taken to this subject with alacrity and good for him. In our<br />
country, of course, we've got a debate now and we've had a mature<br />
debate going but, again, you see the leadership weakness of the<br />
Opposition. Mr Downer's leadership weakness. I mean, he is on radio<br />
and he is on television, he has words everywhere but he has no policy<br />
anywhere. And, he has no policy on this and now he is being<br />
contradicted within his own party, on the republic. Let me just say two<br />
things about that, there are two questions about the republic. The first<br />
question is when the question is put, " Do you believe in an Australian<br />
republic?", if the answer to that is in the affirmative you go to the<br />
second question, " How do you do it, what debate is there, how do you<br />
participate in it, how does it come off?" But, what Mr Downer has said,<br />
in June, on 2UE is, " I am opposed to an Australian republic." So, in a<br />
sense, he has disqualified himself from moving to question two, that is,<br />
how it is duhe. Now, ll-he has got the problem within his party...<br />
J: But he has challenged you ( inaudible)...<br />
PM: There is no good him pretending there is something in my position that<br />
prevents him from showing leadership. The first issue, the first issue<br />
of substance in his leadership has come upon him and he is all over<br />
the shop. He has no policy and he has, on this issue, no strength </p>
<p>other than to say that he is not in favour of the republic. Now, as far as<br />
the government is concerned, we've already moved to question two.<br />
We've got a cabinet committee looking at the issues in the republic<br />
and the modalities of a shift to a republic and we've published and set<br />
up a committee to look at the modalities of a change the Turnbull<br />
Committee and, it has produced a report. And, the best thing I can<br />
say to Mr Downer is, " Get a copy of the report." He can get a copy from<br />
the Bills and Papers Office, it's freely available and he can go and take<br />
it.<br />
J: That's not the government's position though, that is just a committee<br />
report. Mr Downer is saying, " When are you going to come out and<br />
say what<br />
PM: Let me just say this; Mr Downer said, " I am opposed to an Australian<br />
republic." That means he has disqualified himself from participating in<br />
any debate about how it might be done. Is that right or what? The<br />
second point is that the establishment of the report was part of the<br />
government's election strategy at the last election. I said this, I took<br />
the position of leadership and said the Australian Labor Party believes<br />
Australia should become a federal republic. And, we set up an expert<br />
group, headed by Mr Turnbull, to produce the first piece, what is the<br />
first piece of paper in this country, which looks at all the issues. Now,<br />
that report has been presented, the government is now considering<br />
that report. But, the opposition, you know, all over the place. Mr<br />
Downer has shown no leadership whatsoever. Words, transcripts, but<br />
no thoughts.<br />
J: He said you don't have the guts to set out a detailed position, when will<br />
you do that?<br />
PM: Well, he is the one who is not in favour, look, let me just read you the<br />
quote, 3rd June, 1994...<br />
JB: He came prepared.<br />
PM: " I'm not in favour of the republic," so, where does it leave him on the<br />
republic? It leaves him barracking for the Monarchy. But, he knows, in<br />
his party, a great many members of his party do not support the policy.<br />
But, he also knows that if he shifts he also has to deal with Mr Howard<br />
and others. So, the government is moving well and truly in its<br />
discussions and has moved on to question two.<br />
PM: having decided in the affirmative, yes we want a republic, and that's<br />
the Government's view, we've moved the question two. Mr Downer<br />
hasn't even moved past question one.<br />
J: ( inaudible) ( when will the Government respond to the Turnbull<br />
report??)<br />
I </p>
<p>PM: When the Government considers its position.<br />
J: New Zealand has considered joining or has examined joining a free<br />
trade agreement with Chile. Is that likely to progress and what would<br />
that mean for New Zealand'<br />
JB: Well, I'm sure it will have no down side in any relationship, any<br />
relationship we establish with Chile will have no down side on the CER<br />
relationship with Australia. That idea is being considered. Officials<br />
have had preliminary talks, they've gone no further than that. We see<br />
some benefit in it, but itis very early days. We just need to see where<br />
a progress of what the substance of it might be and then we'll make a<br />
decision.<br />
J: Mr Bolger, tomorrow you are seeing how Transfield is getting on<br />
building the patrol boats, is it an option for New Zealand that rather<br />
than build a third or fourth Anzac frigate, you might, in fact, buy patrol<br />
boats? 2<br />
JB: Not being considered. We don't have to make a decision on the third<br />
and fourth frigate for some time yet. So, that issue just simply hasn't<br />
been addressed in New Zealand.<br />
J: Given that you're both keen on a link between CER and AFTA how<br />
long do you think it will take to achieve that?<br />
PM: I don't think either of us could say. I think, it is a matter of this is not<br />
a necessity for Australia or New Zealand. I think, we agree, we think it<br />
is a good thing. Therefore, because we think so, there's a case for<br />
progressing it sensibly by talking to ASEAN leaders and to see what is<br />
in it for Australia and New Zealand and * what is in'it for our potential<br />
partners.<br />
JB: The speed of progress will be substantially, in my view, and I think<br />
Prime Minister Keating agrees, be determined by the ASEAN nations.<br />
If they believe it is a good idea, what time frame do they think it should<br />
occur over. And, we again, are in preliminary discussions. We both<br />
agree it is a good idea, we've both said that publicly, we've both had<br />
the opportunity to talk one to one with ASEAN leaders so, I think, it is a<br />
good idea that we should just quietly take it forward.<br />
J: ( inaudible) ( Australia's concern with the level of defence spending<br />
in NZ??)<br />
PM: The PM and I didn't discuss it at this meeting, but as we were walking<br />
out I said we probably will say something about it together later this<br />
afternoon. I think our position on this is fairly clear. We think that<br />
Australia and New Zealand should maintain and be able to maintain </p>
<p>core competencies and a core capability in defence spending and the<br />
Prime Minister knows my view about this. I said so when I was in New<br />
Zealand and I don't have to say it this afternoon to him. I've just said it<br />
now.<br />
JB: And you don't have to say anything more, but we probably might have<br />
a little chat. The simple fact is I said in our discussions last year in<br />
Wellington that the Government was committed to keeping spending at<br />
about the level it was. We have and we will.<br />
J: A question to both Prime Ministers. The US federal reserve decision<br />
on official interest rates in the US. What ' s the impact on..<br />
PM: We don't know what decision that may be so why speculate about it?<br />
J: Mr Bolger, how is it in New Zealand your country is able to have a<br />
reasonable rational bipartisan approach to the republic..<br />
( Dennis Grant: We're like that<br />
JB: Mr Grant who has been in your country for some time has given you<br />
the answer. No, I think, the answer is that the debate has not<br />
advanced as far in New Zealand as Australia and what way it will<br />
develop, I think, is yet to be determined. But, what one must observe<br />
is that all the political leaders of New Zealand even in quiet voices do<br />
agree.<br />
J: Mr Keating, on the republic. How do you feel about the fact that you<br />
and Dr Hewson may end up on the same side on this issue?<br />
PM: Well, I was inviting Dr Hewson you remember I made what I thought<br />
was an open political offer for his Opposition to join with the<br />
Government and make the transition for Australia from a constitutional<br />
monarchy to a republic. That offer at the time was rejected. The<br />
Government then went on to establish the Turnbull Committee and it is<br />
now going on to consider those outcomes. But, even late repenters<br />
we're very happy to see them on board.<br />
JB: Can I go back to the early question, because I may have left it slightly<br />
understated there. I'd have to say there's an awful lot of<br />
parliamentarians on all sides of the Parliament who don't agree<br />
however.<br />
J: Did you discuss New Zealand's warmer relationship with the United<br />
States ( inaudible)<br />
PM: No, we didn't. We think this is a matter between New Zealand and the<br />
United States. It's not our business and I'm very glad you think, and </p>
<p>7<br />
it's generally afoot, that there's a warmer relationship between the two<br />
countries. I'm sure that's a very good thing.<br />
JB: It is and it is warming and the relationship between myself and<br />
President Clinton is a very positive one and I think it's very good for<br />
not only New Zealand, but I think it's good for our region.<br />
J: ( inaudible)...<br />
PM: We've been discussing this<br />
JB: I was just going to say no, that won't happen. Relax. Thank you.<br />
