    <content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Â P. M. No. 125/1966</strong></p>
<p>Her Majesty the Queen has approved a new Ensign forÂ the Royal Australian Navy. It will be flown by Australian NavalÂ ships and establishments as soon as the necessary flags haveÂ been manufactured.</p>
<p>The new Ensign will replace the White Ensign, which isÂ the present flag of the Royal Navy, and has been flown by theÂ Royal Australian Navy since it was formed In 1910. It will beÂ called the Australian White Ensign.</p>
<p>Australians have been proud to serve under the sameÂ Ensign as the Royal Navy for more than half a century. But weÂ have come to feel that it is now appropriate to adopt a flag which,Â while indicating our allegiance to the Grown, is distinctively theÂ flag of the Royal Australian Navy.Â </p>
<p>The new flag will be white and will continue to show theÂ Union Flag in the upper canton at the hoist. In place of the RedÂ Cross of St. George, the new Ensign will display the six blueÂ Australian stars on the white ground, placed in the same way asÂ the stars on the National Flag.</p>
<p>I am confident that the high and honourable traditionsÂ associated with the White Ensign will be maintained by the RoyalÂ Australian Navy under its new flag.</p>
<p>Canberra<br />23rd December, 1966.</p>
