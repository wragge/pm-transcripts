PRIME MINISTER Press Statement No. 493<br />
14 April 1975<br />
LOCATION OF AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENTEMPLOYMENT<br />
The Government has endorsed new criteria for<br />
the location of Australian Government employment in<br />
Canberra and other growth centres.<br />
Most proposals for establishing new units of<br />
Government administration, or relocating existing units,<br />
have tended to assume they would be in Canberra. However<br />
acceptance of all such proposals would place intolerable<br />
strains on Canberra's growth resources in the short<br />
term. The Government has decided that., new government<br />
unit should be located in Canberra when it needs to be<br />
in Canberra for the efficient desptach of its responsibilities<br />
and where its presence contributes to Canberra's role as<br />
the national capital.<br />
The Government will be transferring other new<br />
and existing employment units to new growth centres in<br />
order to ensure that progT. 5; s in these centres is as<br />
rapid and efficient as possible.<br />
Among the criteria which will be considered are:<br />
Relocation will be directed towards relieving<br />
pressure on major cities and at the same time<br />
promoting the growth of regional centres.<br />
Decisions will be consistent with Australian<br />
Government priorities for the development<br />
of particular regions and growth centres.*<br />
Growth centres will have priority, to the<br />
extent of their capacity, in the location of<br />
units of Government administration. New units,<br />
will as far as possible, be located in growth<br />
centres, consistent with the efficient execution<br />
of their functions.<br />
Although Canberra is I growth centre, it is<br />
less in need of growth stimulus than newer<br />
centres. New growth centres provide a viable alternative<br />
to Canberra for the location of units of ' national'<br />
or central office' character. / 2 </p>
<p>Each growth centre will tend to specialise in<br />
certain functional areas. This specialisation would be<br />
balanced by appropriate growth in the private sector and<br />
could be supported by the development of related academic<br />
disciplines in educational institutions in the growth<br />
centres. Functional groupings in growth centres which<br />
are expected to emerge are:<br />
Albury Wodonga: National education, environmental<br />
studies, transport, agencies with a national<br />
' market serving' role Health Insurance<br />
Commission). Bathurst-Orange: Earth resources study and<br />
development, cartography.<br />
Geelong: Biological sciences.<br />
