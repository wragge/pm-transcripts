<p>More than 1000 jobs and training opportunities are up for grabs today at the Australian Government Jobs and Skills Expo at the Whitlam Leisure Centre in Liverpool.</p>
<p>Today's Liverpool Expo puts local job seekers in touch with employers, training organisations and industry representatives.</p>
<p>This is a great chance for local job seekers and businesses from throughout south -west Sydney to come together and explore local job opportunities.</p>
