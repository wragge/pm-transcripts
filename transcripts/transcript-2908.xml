The decision to place control for the arts in the hands of<br />
Aboriginals is intended to stimulate indigenous Australian arts<br />
and lead to the preservation of many art forms almost lost since<br />
the settlement of Australia by Europeans.<br />
The Board will investigate ways of involving Aboriginals<br />
in a wide range of cultural activities in the visual arts,<br />
performing arts, film making and literature. Projects aimed<br />
at the preservation of Aboriginal Art, crafts, dance and music<br />
will be sponsored in communities throughout central and northern<br />
Australia. Assistance will be given also to establish community museums<br />
where cultural property can be housed safely and where the younger<br />
generation can be taught an appreciation of their own heritage<br />
in accordance with traditional custom.<br />
Inter-community visits will be supported to assist local<br />
groups to share the music and dance which have been handed down<br />
to them over many thousands of years..<br />
Craftsmen will have new opportunities to use their traditional<br />
skills to develop independent enterprises. Workshops will be<br />
arranged for those wishing to experiment with new art forms such<br />
as weaving, leatherwork, pottery and batik.<br />
The Board will study a form of quality control and a system<br />
.3/ </p>
<p>of orderly marketing for arts and crafts.<br />
An intensive program is underway for Aboriginal theatre<br />
in urban communities. Support will be offered to extend this<br />
to the country where increasing numbers of Aboriginals are becoming<br />
interested in theatre as a form of expression.<br />
Sponsorship will be available also to Aboriginal authors and<br />
film makers. Subsidies will be provided for publications so that<br />
Aboriginals can express to the wider community something of the<br />
richness of their culture.<br />
The new board will sponsor the first National Seminar on<br />
Aboriginal Arts to be held in Australia. This is planned from<br />
21 to 25 May at the Australian National University in Canberra.<br />
About 200 people have been invited. They will be predominantly<br />
Aboriginals. The recommendations of the seminar will largely<br />
influence the board in its future policy planning for the<br />
stimulation and revitalisation of Aboriginal arts throughout<br />
the country. </p>
