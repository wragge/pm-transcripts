    <content><![CDATA[<p>CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, good morning.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Good morning Jeremy, it is very good to be back.</p>
<p>CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>Nice to see. You should come to Adelaide more often. You come to</p>
<p>   Adelaide the inflation figure goes down....</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>And the businessmen and women are more optimistic now than I have</p>
<p>   known them for a decade.</p>
<p>CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>Yes, well we need to be.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, you have every reason to be because this State has a lot</p>
<p>   going for it and the national economic conditions are very strong.</p>
<p>   We do have record low inflation, we have much lower interest rates,</p>
<p>   we have strong business investment, we are getting our debt down</p>
<p>   and we are weathering the hurricane that is blowing through Asia,</p>
<p>   and that is something to be optimistic about.</p>
<p>CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>And when you get tax reform on the table and done, we should be</p>
<p>   cooking with gas shouldn't we?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>We should be. Well we are now but we will be cooking with even</p>
<p>   more gas when we have reformed the taxation system and that is the</p>
<p>   biggest piece of unfinished economic business in Australia, giving</p>
<p>   this country a fairer, refashioned, modern taxation system.</p>
<p>CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>Now I make that point, because I was there last night at that little</p>
<p>   reception and I was very impressed with the stuff that you were</p>
<p>   saying. For example, on tax reform that you....</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, let me make the point. There is something fundamentally crazy</p>
<p>   about a tax system that imposes a 12 per cent wholesale sales tax</p>
<p>   on orange juice concentrate but nothing on caviar, and taxes the</p>
<p>   family car, and this is very important for Adelaide which is the</p>
<p>   home of motor vehicle manufacturing in Australia, at 22%. But, if</p>
<p>   you can afford to buy a Lear Jet, and there aren't too many</p>
<p>   can even afford to do that, that is completely free of wholesale</p>
<p>   sales tax.</p>
<p>CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>Well, how did all this happen?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, it happened because we, over the decades, we allowed wholesale</p>
<p>   sales tax to grow in a ramshackle fashion and put increasing reliance</p>
<p>   on income tax. When I left school in the mid 1950s the top marginal</p>
<p>   rate applied at nineteen times average weekly earnings. Now it applies</p>
<p>   at about 1.4 times average weekly earnings. In other words, if you</p>
<p>   are just a little bit above average weekly earnings, and there are</p>
<p>   a lot of people in that category, you can be on the top margin rate</p>
<p>   of tax.</p>
<p>CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>So you are the Prime Minister, you can fix all that.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>And we are determined to give Australians a better and fairer,</p>
<p>   more modern a more progressive, more productive taxation system.</p>
<p>CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>Let us into your thinking of it. Do you favour a flat tax of say</p>
<p>   25 cents?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>That's unworkable, that particular proposal. What we are in</p>
<p>   favour of is much lower personal income tax. We clearly have to</p>
<p>   look at a broad-based, indirect tax to replace some or all of the</p>
<p>   indirect taxes. We have to address some of the problems of Commonwealth/State</p>
<p>   financial relations. The people who will suffer in the scheme we</p>
<p>   are going to introduce will be people who are tax cheats.</p>
<p>CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>[inaudible]</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes, it will be much harder to evade, there is a lot of tax being</p>
<p>   lost through the present system.</p>
<p>CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>But you said that no one is going to be worse off.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Except people who are cheating.</p>
<p>CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>Well, they deserve to be worse off.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Of course. I mean, I make no bones that they will be very adversely</p>
<p>   affected. But, if you have a more efficient taxation system, and</p>
<p>   you make certain that people who are meant to be paying their fair</p>
<p>   share do pay their fair share and that can work to the benefit of</p>
<p>   the honest taxpayer.</p>
<p>CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>Now, you and I have talked about tax added onto things, and I have</p>
<p>   said to you on many occasions that that is a good thing. And you</p>
<p>   have said "No, can't do that, the people have voted against</p>
<p>   that, we will never do that again". Where was the change and</p>
<p>   what was the point that changed in your mind about a tax on goods</p>
<p>   and services?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, we supported it before 1993 and we accepted the verdict of</p>
<p>   the 1993 election, and therefore I said at the last election that</p>
<p>   we wouldn't introduce a broad based indirect tax during our</p>
<p>   first term. Now, I am talking about something that will come into</p>
<p>   operation if we are re-elected. What we are going to announce this</p>
<p>   year will operate from a date after the next election.</p>
<p>CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>Would you agree that the only thing wrong with it was the inability</p>
<p>   of certain people to either understand it or sell it to the general</p>
<p>   public?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I think there was that too much emphasis on one aspect of</p>
<p>   it and not enough emphasis on the enormous benefit, particularly</p>
<p>   for average wage and salary earners of lower personal income tax.</p>
<p>CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>So we can look forward, under your Government, a regime that will</p>
<p>   not tax energy, will not tax enterprise, will not tax enthusiasm.....</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>You can look forward to a system that will give people a very,</p>
<p>   very important commodity and that is incentive. And that is what</p>
<p>   is lacking increasingly in the present system. You are talking here</p>
<p>   about people in the average wage bracket. They complain about working</p>
<p>   overtime because they lose so much of it in tax. Now, if [inaudible]</p>
<p>   those rates lower, and you only have those rates lower if you reform</p>
<p>   the whole system, then you will put a lot more incentive back into</p>
<p>   the lives of average workers in this country.</p>
<p>CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>And if it is made simpler, you maybe.....</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>And fairer. And getting rid of the Lear Jet/family car anomaly.</p>
<p>CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>And the billion dollar tax avoidance industry.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>All of those things. A lot of tax avoidance has been gotten rid</p>
<p>   of but there are still, particularly in the area of the black economy,</p>
<p>   and there are some other arrangements that can't be supported.</p>
<p>CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>Now, that's one problem and you are going to fix that. What</p>
<p>   are you going to do about the wharves? What are you going to do,</p>
<p>   I'm looking through the wires now, the latest wires and it</p>
<p>   looks like they are going to dig their heels in on the wharves,</p>
<p>   and they threaten war and a nasty confrontation. What are you going</p>
<p>   to do?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, let me talk about what we have already done. And that is</p>
<p>   that we have changed the law of this country to remove the monopoly</p>
<p>   on the supply of waterfront labour, formerly held by the wharf union</p>
<p>   or the Maritime Union of Australia. We now have a situation in this</p>
<p>   country that it is legally possible for non-union labour, as it</p>
<p>   should be, to be employed on the waterfront. And we are not in the</p>
<p>   business of stevedoring. Governments are not stevedores, they are</p>
<p>   Governments. But what we are saying to the National Farmers Federation,</p>
<p>   or indeed to anybody else, that if you want to start up the business</p>
<p>   of a stevedore, then you have a perfect right to do so. And the</p>
<p>   law is there to protect your right to start a business. And I can</p>
<p>   sympathise with people who want to start new businesses on the waterfront,</p>
<p>   because the Australian waterfront is very inefficient. Our crane</p>
<p>   rates are well below world average. This is hurting our economy.</p>
<p>CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>I know, we talked to Peter Reith about it yesterday and he went</p>
<p>   through all of this. But these people are a law unto themselves.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, nobody in a democracy is ultimately a law unto themselves.</p>
<p>CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>Well, what are you going to do?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, what we are going to do is stand by the principles that the</p>
<p>   law is there to protect people and to help people who are carrying</p>
<p>   out lawful activities. And let me say to the MUA: "Don't</p>
<p>   damage the national interest in your own selfish interest".</p>
<p>   The national interest of Australia demands that we have more competition</p>
<p>   on the wharves, the national interest demands that we have the cheapest</p>
<p>   crane rates, the national interest demands that we have the opportunity</p>
<p>   of selling at the most competitive prices. And people and companies</p>
<p>   that want to go into the business providing a better and cheaper</p>
<p>   service have got a right to do so, and nobody in this country has</p>
<p>   a right to threaten their fellow Australians with economic damage</p>
<p>   and economic destruction if their monopoly position is threatened,</p>
<p>   and that basically is what the MUA is doing. The only people who</p>
<p>   are talking war and belligerence and confrontation are the wharfies.</p>
<p>CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>And picket lines.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Of course. I mean they are the people who are using the language</p>
<p>   of the class warfare and the language of confrontation.</p>
<p>CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>And the language of thuggery.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Exactly. Nobody else is doing that. The farmers aren't doing</p>
<p>   it. I mean, heavens above, farmers over the years have seen their</p>
<p>   produce rot on the wharfs and their livelihoods affected because</p>
<p>   of the activities of people on the wharves. And I can understand</p>
<p>   how they feel but let me say that they are acting within the law.</p>
<p>   It is very important that it be understood that it is like any other</p>
<p>   business. If somebody wants to start a radio station in, [inaudible]</p>
<p>   and so forth, you have got a right to do this. Somebody wants to</p>
<p>   open a shop, somebody wants to open a professional practice.</p>
<p>CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>This is key reform.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes and it is long overdue.</p>
<p>CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>Do you remember the photograph of an aerial shot of, I think it</p>
<p>   was Sydney Harbour and there were 70 or 80 ships in Newcastle. It</p>
<p>   is absolutely scandalous.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Of course it is. And given what is happening in our region it is</p>
<p>   all the more important that we get ahead with further reform. The</p>
<p>   last thing that we can do, now that there has been this meltdown</p>
<p>   in Asia, the last thing we can do is say: "Well, the time for</p>
<p>   further reform in Australia is over". I mean that's what</p>
<p>   the Labor Party is doing. What the Labor Party is trying to say</p>
<p>   to the Australian people is: "Because the world is economically</p>
<p>   falling apart in Asia, that is the time that we can relax, we can</p>
<p>   put down our oars, we can stop performing, we can stop doing anything".</p>
<p>   It is the exact reverse. It is because there is a meltdown in Asia</p>
<p>   that it is all the more important to fix the waterfront and to fix</p>
<p>   the taxation system.</p>
<p>CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>I put it to you though, that when Bob Hawke broke the pilots'</p>
<p>   strike, he sent in the airforce, he sent in the military and he</p>
<p>   broke the pilots' strike. What's wrong with sending the</p>
<p>   troops into force?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, there is no suggestion of any need.</p>
<p>CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>I know that, but what's wrong with the principle?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, look Jeremy, I don't see the circumstances where that</p>
<p>   would arise, and I think it is a diversion to the debate that is</p>
<p>   now going on. I'm not threatening it, nobody's threatening</p>
<p>   it, nobody's speculating that it is going to occur. There is</p>
<p>   a law there, there is a civilian authority that deals with breaches</p>
<p>   of the law. </p>
<p>CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>I heard you say the other day that you thought the long-term, or</p>
<p>   medium to long-term outlook for interest rates was good. Not often</p>
<p>   you hear a Prime Minister or a Treasurer making a prediction about</p>
<p>   interest rates.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I was responding to a suggestion that they were about to</p>
<p>   go up, and nobody can sort of give a one-hundred-year guarantee</p>
<p>   about those things and I have never tried to do so. But, what has</p>
<p>   happened is that we created the condition where interest rates could</p>
<p>   come down because we cut Government debt. And when you cut Government</p>
<p>   debt you leave more room for other people in the private sector</p>
<p>   to borrow and therefore interest rate pressures are eased and that's</p>
<p>   why they came down.</p>
<p>CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>Okay, I am going to take a quick break, but things generally are</p>
<p>   looking pretty good.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Economically they are very strong in Australia.</p>
<p>CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>Access Economics, which must have been good news for you .....</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Very encouraging. I mean, the domestic economy in this country,</p>
<p>   its foundations are as strong as they have been for 25 years.</p>
<p>CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>And you think we can weather whatever problems may arise?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, so far we have done extremely well. I mean in the globalised</p>
<p>   world, economic collapse is contagious if your own economy is weak.</p>
<p>   And if your economic immune system is weak and is broken down then</p>
<p>   you will catch the disease. But our immune system is very strong</p>
<p>   and we haven't caught the disease.</p>
<p>CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>And do you think we will end up with a balanced budget?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, all the predictions are that the budget that Peter Costello</p>
<p>   will bring down in May of this year will contain a healthy surplus.</p>
<p>   Now, to turn around a $10.5 billion deficit that Kim Beazley left</p>
<p>   us into a surplus in two and a half years is not bad.</p>
<p>CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>I heard $3 billion.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, it is a little hard to put a figure on it at the moment,</p>
<p>   but it will, on current predictions, I stress that, be a healthy</p>
<p>   surplus. Eighteen months ago the best we thought we would do was</p>
<p>   a bare balance. So if we end up having decent surplus, that is $10.5</p>
<p>   billion in the red to comfortably in the black in two and half years,</p>
<p>   without increasing taxation.</p>
<p>CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>I will pass this over because you might find interesting. This</p>
<p>   is just in a key employment indicator released today it shows increasing</p>
<p>   rising demand for skilled workers, which is good. Department of</p>
<p>   Employment, Training, Education and Youth Affairs.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>We have had 140,000 new jobs created in the last three or four</p>
<p>   months.</p>
<p>CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>Up 1.8 per cent.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>All the indicators on the employment front at the present time</p>
<p>   are very strong. And the other thing I am very happy to report is</p>
<p>   that in 1996, it's the first year that we were in Government,</p>
<p>   the number of industrial disputes was the lowest we have seen in</p>
<p>   Australia since 1940, that was, of course, just after the outbreak</p>
<p>   of World War II. And we were told by our union opponents in the</p>
<p>   election campaign that if we implemented our industrial relations</p>
<p>   reforms, there would be widespread industrial disputes and stoppages.</p>
<p>   The reverse has happened. I mean you really have a very interesting</p>
<p>   situation in Australia at the moment where we are seeing big industrial</p>
<p>   relations reform, we are seeing minimal industrial disputation as</p>
<p>   those figures indicate and we are also seeing a moderation of wage</p>
<p>   claims. And I thank the workforce of Australia, I thank them very</p>
<p>   sincerely for the moderation of those wage claims. And the reason</p>
<p>   why they are making moderate wage claims is that interest rates</p>
<p>   have fallen and they have got more money in their pocket. I mean,</p>
<p>   if you are paying $250 a month less on your mortgage and that's</p>
<p>   after tax money you are immensely better off and you don't</p>
<p>   feel the same need....</p>
<p>CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>And when you fix the tax thing.....</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Exactly, you don't feel the same need to pursue a wage rise.</p>
<p>CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>Now I know there are young people who can't get jobs and it</p>
<p>   must be a terrible experience to go through and demoralising, debilitating</p>
<p>   kind of experience, but these current affairs programmes that from</p>
<p>   time to time show people at Byron Bay, and they don't want</p>
<p>   to get a job etc etc, I take it that these reforms that you announced</p>
<p>   yesterday, particularly the relocation one, will do away with that?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>All of the measures that we have announced in the mutual obligation,</p>
<p>   Work for the Dole area, they are designed to do two things. They</p>
<p>   are designed to entrench the principal of mutual obligation. That</p>
<p>   is, we are prepared to provide, income security, for people who,</p>
<p>   the basic support for people who can't get a job. But what</p>
<p>   we are determined to do is to say to them in return: "We will</p>
<p>   support you providing you put something back". And putting</p>
<p>   something back can take a variety of forms. We are not going to</p>
<p>   have a situation where people draw the dole and do nothing in return.</p>
<p>   And that is the principal. And we are going to expand the Work for</p>
<p>   the Dole scheme, 25,000 new places. We are going to introduce new</p>
<p>   literacy and numeracy programmes, because a whole lot of people</p>
<p>   have left school who can't properly read and write, and that's</p>
<p>   the main reason why they don't get a job, or if they get one</p>
<p>   they lose it. And what we are going to say to those people who can't</p>
<p>   properly read and write: "Okay that's the main reason</p>
<p>   why you can't get a job, we are going to make sure that you</p>
<p>   fix it, we are going to offer you help at our expense, but there</p>
<p>   is one condition attached to it, if you don't take that help,</p>
<p>   then you can be penalised so far as your dole payment is concerned".</p>
<p>CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>Well, in the court of public opinion people will regard that as</p>
<p>   incredibly fair.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER: </p>
<p>Well, it is right, and it is in the best interest of the young</p>
<p>   people concerned, because every survey tells us that chronic inability</p>
<p>   in areas of literacy and numeracy is one of the main reason why</p>
<p>   people can't get work. And employers will know, as it is common</p>
<p>   sense, that if you are not up to scratch on literacy and numeracy</p>
<p>   you can't hold a job. Now, what we are saying to those people,</p>
<p>   is "Don't despair, we will put more resources, we are</p>
<p>   not asking the system as it now stands to absorb these people without</p>
<p>   extra resources, we will put the extra resources in, we will provide</p>
<p>   remedial courses, including distance education for people in country</p>
<p>   areas. But in return you have to understand that if you are assessed</p>
<p>   as not having the right literacy and numeracy standards and you</p>
<p>   don't pick up these remedial courses then you could suffer</p>
<p>   a reduction in your dole payment". I am absolutely certain</p>
<p>   that is fair, it is right and it will help the young people concerned</p>
<p>   and I think the public will see the common sense of it.</p>
<p>CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>Now, while we are talking about reform, I have a listener who is</p>
<p>   hot on this, and I must admit I am pretty hot on this as well. When</p>
<p>   the Prime Minister resigns, it is incredible to think that the can</p>
<p>   get more in benefits and pensions than what he was getting when</p>
<p>   he was on the job. My listener has decided to put a petition out</p>
<p>   and what has provoked him was the bill to keep Mr Keating, $624,000.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes, the $600 odd thousand.</p>
<p>CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>Don't you think that is a bit obscene?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Have you got Mr Keating on to ask him about it?</p>
<p>CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>He doesn't really, I don't think he ever particularly</p>
<p>   likes me....</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>And perhaps at the same time you could ask him for the recession</p>
<p>   we had to have. I think always a good thing to get people to apologise</p>
<p>   for things for which they were directly responsible.</p>
<p>CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>Now, this petition says that all past and future ex-Prime Ministers</p>
<p>   would be limited to no more than $1000 per week of taxpayers'</p>
<p>   money on their privileges. And the idea was to get you to have a</p>
<p>   look at that, the thought is mine as a man who cares about the public</p>
<p>   dollar to sign the petition.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I will tell you what I will do. I would like the lady to</p>
<p>   let me know what she means by $1000 per week of taxpayers'</p>
<p>   money on their privileges. I mean, retired Members of Parliament,</p>
<p>   including retired Prime Ministers, have a good superannuation, nobody</p>
<p>   will deny that. Equally people will argue, I won't talk about</p>
<p>   myself, but I will talk about other people who hold some of the</p>
<p>   positions that they do hold in politics, their actually salaries</p>
<p>   compared with people who are managing directors of large Australian</p>
<p>   companies are nowhere near as high as those salaries are. The Treasurer</p>
<p>   of Australia earns about a fifth or even a tenth probably of the</p>
<p>   chief executive of the major banks of Australia. Now, he is not</p>
<p>   complaining, I am not complaining, but I think whenever you talk</p>
<p>   about politicians remuneration, that side of it.</p>
<p>CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I think former Prime Ministers, are entitled to reasonable provision</p>
<p>   given the responsibilities they used to hold. But, like everybody</p>
<p>   else they should not abuse privileges. I work on the principle that</p>
<p>   privileges are nothing more than a gesture from the people and you</p>
<p>   don't have a right to them and you have an obligation never</p>
<p>   to abuse a privilege.</p>
<p>CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>Let me pin you down.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I am not going to be pinned down. The last person I am going to</p>
<p>   pinned down in relation to is Paul Keating.</p>
<p>CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>But it is not just Paul Keating.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>If you have got a beef with him you are going to have to take it</p>
<p>   up with him. I am not answering for him.</p>
<p>CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>But you can change the rules. The rules are basically he is not</p>
<p>   doing anything wrong.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I don't know. When I say ......</p>
<p>CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>[inaudible]</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I am not suggesting that he has done anything illegal, I am</p>
<p>   not suggesting that. I don't know the circumstance of it. But</p>
<p>   now that you have presented me with petitions I will look at it.</p>
<p>CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>But you do agree with us that is ...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well on the basis of it is seems a very large bill. And I should</p>
<p>   say that having said that I don't know the background of it.</p>
<p>   It does seem a huge bill and I don't think the battlers out</p>
<p>   there would think it is anything other than a very big bill. </p>
<p>CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>Well it would seem, without sort of annoying you, that one Australia,</p>
<p>   with one law, one superannuation arrangement, one group of real</p>
<p>   estate laws, leaving Wik to one side, we are all Australians, we</p>
<p>   should be all treated the same under the law.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes, of course we should, I am not suggesting otherwise. I mean,</p>
<p>   what happens with a former Prime Minister, he gets his superannuation</p>
<p>   ......</p>
<p>CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>Generous.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>A generous superannuation. But put against that, many would argue</p>
<p>   that the salary is below what people are payed with comparable responsibility.</p>
<p>   I mean these are travel expenses.</p>
<p>CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>Yes, well I know you well enough to know that that will get up</p>
<p>   your nose and you will go away and look at it.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, it is certainly a very big bill. Huge.</p>
<p>CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>Now you've said publicly, in fact I think you said last night</p>
<p>   when somebody asked you when the election was you said "I will</p>
<p>   hold it at the right time".</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>And I will! Like you hold it at the wrong time! No way, no way,</p>
<p>   I will hold it at the right time.</p>
<p>CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>Well, they say July.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, people can say what they like.</p>
<p>CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>You can't really get the tax thing out on the table by July.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Jeremy I am not going to get into speculation on when the next</p>
<p>   election is going to be held. And the reason that this election</p>
<p>   speculation has started, and it normally does start about the beginning</p>
<p>   of the third year of a government's term, is that the Senate</p>
<p>   blocked our Native Title Bill. Now if the Senate lets it through</p>
<p>   in March, a lot of speculation will go away. And that is the only</p>
<p>   reason I had to talk about what [inaudible] rejected again.</p>
<p>CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>Prime Minister we have to go, but thank you very much for your</p>
<p>   time. I know you have got a busy day in Adelaide but with the cricket</p>
<p>   aspect it will be a very enjoyable day for you.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, opening the Bradford Exhibition at the Museum will be quite</p>
<p>   an experience.</p>
<p>CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>Good to see you.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
