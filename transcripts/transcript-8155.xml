1990 E 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
JOURNALIST: What did you think of the game?<br />
PM: Fantastic.<br />
JOURNALIST: Are you pleased that Collingwood won?<br />
PM: Yes, I haven't tipped against them the whole year.<br />

own country but for the rest of the world to come to a<br />
decision which meaningfully addresses that very serious<br />
problem. ends </p>
