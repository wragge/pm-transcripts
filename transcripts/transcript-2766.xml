THE PRIME MINISTER'S PRESS CONFERENCE<br />
AT PARLIAMENT HOUSE, CANBERRA<br />
TUESDAY, 9 JANUARY 1973<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Ladies and gentlemen: As you know we had a<br />
Cabinet meeting this morning and this afternoon, and there are quite<br />
a number of announcements which I will make arising from that meeting.<br />
Many of my colleagues will be making further statements on some of the<br />
subjects which fall within their province.<br />
First of all, the Governor-General has signed the Proclamation<br />
calling Parliament together on Tuesday 27 February. A special Gazette<br />
is being issued. The presiding officers, Sir William Aston and<br />
Sir Magnus Cormack have been informed.<br />
All but two departments have now had their permanent heads<br />
appointed. The permanent heads who were appointed today are as follows:<br />
Department of Aboriginal Affairs:<br />
Department of the Capital Territory<br />
Department of the Environment and<br />
Conservation<br />
Department of the Media<br />
Department of the Northern Territor<br />
Department of Secondary Industry:<br />
Department of Social Security:<br />
Department of the Special Minister<br />
of State Mr Barry Dexter<br />
Mr Engledow<br />
Dr Donald Frederick McMichael<br />
he is not a member of the<br />
Commonwealth Service. He is<br />
an outstanding member of the<br />
New South Wales Public Service.<br />
Mr Jim Oswin also not a<br />
member heretofore of the<br />
Commonwealth Public Service<br />
but the Head of the Channel 7<br />
network, and a man with<br />
exceptional experience in<br />
newspapers, radio, television<br />
and advertising: We regard<br />
ourselves as very fortunate<br />
to have secured the services of<br />
Dr McMichael and Mr Oswin<br />
Mr Allen O'Brien<br />
Mr Frank Pryor<br />
Dr Wienholt<br />
Mr Peter Lawler<br />
Department of Tourism and Recreation: MMrr LoLdlBoytdD SCBott, D. S. C. </p>
<p>The vacancy on the Australian Broadcasting Commission has been<br />
filled by Mr Hal Lashwood, who has been the General President of<br />
Actors Equity for the last 21 years. All these appointments were<br />
made by the Executive Council at half past one today.<br />
I might draw your attention to the fact that the appointment<br />
of Dr Stephen FitzGerald as Ambassador to the People's Republic of<br />
China is being announced today. A press release is being issued<br />
by the Department of Foreign Affairs.<br />
The advance party to establish an Embassy in Peking will be<br />
crossing into China tomorrow, Wednesday, the 10th of January.<br />
Now matters of legislation: I'll ask you to bear with me because<br />
I have to look through the Cabinet papers, and there may be a few<br />
pauses as I come to various paragraphs.<br />
Cabinet authorised the preparation of a Death Penalty Abolition<br />
Bill. This will be based on the bill which was introduced into the<br />
Senate by Senator Murphy in April 1971, and which passed the Senate<br />
in March last year but which was allowed to remain on the Notice<br />
Paper in the House of Representatives.<br />
Cabinet authorised the preparation of enabling legislation to<br />
remove the excise on wine. We authorised the preparation of<br />
legislation enabling the removal of the sales tax on contraceptives.<br />
We authorised the preparation of legislation to amend the National<br />
Health Act to provide that oral contraceptives which have been by<br />
regulation made available on doctors' prescriptions will be<br />
incorporated in the schedules of the Act as the Act requires in<br />
respect of any provisions which are made by regulation.<br />
We authorised the preparation of legislation along the lines<br />
of the amendment which Mr Cameron moved in the last Parliament to<br />
the Compensation ( Commonwealth Employees) Act in effect saying<br />
that there will be no reduction of income for people who are<br />
injured in the service of the Commonwealth during the period of<br />
their incapacity.<br />
Now all of these are legislation unless I state otherwise:<br />
To extend the Aboriginal Secondary Grants Scheme to include<br />
all children of Aboriginal descent attending secondary schools and<br />
classes from the beginning of this year and to continue to assist<br />
the small number of children of primary level who have reached the<br />
school leaving age. And, provision is being made that education<br />
officers of the Federal Department will visit each student receiving<br />
benefit at least once a term.<br />
Legislation to adopt the principles of maternity leave for<br />
Commonwealth employees for 6 weeks before the expected date of<br />
confinement and 6 weeks thereafter, this maternity leave to operate<br />
from the first of January this year.<br />
Legislation to lower the franchise for Federal elections to 18,<br />
and to lower the age for candidature at Federal elections to 18. There<br />
are some States in which such legislation has already been passed<br />
but is awaiting gazettal depending on Federal action. The practice has<br />
been in the case of States where there are common Federal and State<br />
electoral rolls, for the two governments to share the expense.<br />
We will share the expense of preparing rolls for 18, 19 and<br />
men and women in anticipation of this legislation being<br />
passed. This has particular relevance to Victoria where an </p>
<p>election is pending and where enrolment is compulsory, and to<br />
South Australia where an election is pending but where, State-wise,<br />
enrolment is optional.<br />
Cabinet authorised the Minister for Minerals and Energy to confer<br />
consent under the Petroleum Submerged Lands Act with respect to<br />
farm-in agreements between Burmah-Woodside Consortium and Mt. Isa<br />
Mines Limited. Cabinet authorised the Attorney-General to draft<br />
legislation combining broadly the Territorial Sea and Continental<br />
Shelf Bill which was introduced in 1970, and the Minerals Submerged<br />
Lands Bill which was promised at that time. I have sent telegrams.<br />
to all the Premiers informing them of these decisions.<br />
Cabinet authorised the Minister for Minerals and Energy to<br />
confer with the State Mines Ministers with respect to construction<br />
and operation of a national pipeline system.<br />
A Committee of Cabinet is meeting tonight to draw up terms of<br />
reference for an inquiry into the Postmaster-General's Department.<br />
There are a very great number of matters which have-arisen in the<br />
election campaign, in the policy speech, in recent times concerning<br />
the whole operations of the Post Office, regional basis, concessions,<br />
different categories of mail, capital and running expenses.<br />
Another committee of Cabinet is to make a report by the end of<br />
March on the proposal for an international airport at Townsville<br />
for the purpose of encouraging tourism. Mr Stewart, the Minister,<br />
will be the chairman of that Committee.<br />
Cabinet approved the provision, of additional funds of up to<br />
for War-Service Homes in the current financial year.<br />
If this had not been done, a waiting period would have had to be<br />
introduced for six months.<br />
Aged, invalid and widows pensions:. you will remember that in my<br />
policy speech I said " all pensions will immediately be raised by<br />
$ 1.50 and thereafter every Spring and every Autumn the basic pension<br />
rate will be raised by $ 1.50 until it reaches 25 per cent of average<br />
weekly earnings".<br />
The increases will be raised for aged and invalid pensions by<br />
$ 1.50. They will be paid as soon as possible after the legislation<br />
is passed by the two Houses, and payments will be paid at that<br />
increased rate from the first full pension period after the day<br />
of the elections, the 2nd day of last month.<br />
The old categories of widows pensions and will be<br />
abolished. All widows receiving and pensions will receive a<br />
pension and the pension for widows will be increased by at least<br />
$ 1.50; i. e. every widow will receive $ 21.50 soon after the<br />
legislation passes the two Houses and the additional rates will be<br />
paid as from the first full pay period after the date of the elections.<br />
The position of repatriation benefits wil. C be considered<br />
probably next Tuesday.<br />
Unemployment and sickness benefits and special benefits will<br />
be paid at the rate of aged, invalid and widows pensions; i. e.<br />
$ 21.50 for a single person, and $ 37.50 for a married couple as<br />
from the 1st March. There has hitherto been payable an additional benefit<br />
of $ 4.50 a week for all children up to 16 years of age. </p>
<p>We have authorised an amendment to the Act to make that payment<br />
available to all full-time dependent students without limitation<br />
of age. Now there's something on the French Nuclear tests...<br />
The Australian Government has communicated its position to the<br />
French Government that the conducting of the tests would be<br />
unlawful, and has invited an assurance that no more atmospheric<br />
tests would be held either this year or in the future. And in the<br />
event of the Australian Government not receiving satisfactory<br />
assurances from the French Government, the Australian Government<br />
proposes to institute proceedings in the International Court of<br />
juetice to restrain the conducting of future tests in the Pacific<br />
by the French Government.<br />
Q. Prime Minister: Can I ask you about your communications with<br />
the French Ambassador before he left for Paris?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: The note was delivered to the French Foreign Office<br />
by Australia's Ambassador, Mr Alan Renouf I think on the 3rd of<br />
January. Now I think those are all that I can say at the moment.<br />
Q. Is there any time limit on the assurance of the French<br />
Government? PRIME MINISTER: No.<br />
Q. It is sort of indefinitely any time this year?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Any undue lapse of time would be taken as a<br />
refusal to give the assurances invited.<br />
Q. -Well, would you consider an undue lapse of time?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I'd like to take advice on that. This is the<br />
first time that any nuclear power has been invited to give such<br />
assurances. Q. Mr Prime Minister, have you asked the President to give a<br />
similar assurance about illegal bombing of North Vietnam?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I've written to the President, as you know,<br />
days ago and our attitude was made known to the President also at the<br />
State Department when our Charge called there and more recently<br />
I think it was yesterday when our Ambassador called there. Also,<br />
of course, it has been made known to the American Ambassador in<br />
Canberra when he called last week on two occasions on the Secretary<br />
of the Foreign Affairs Department, Sir Keith Waller, and when he<br />
called on me yesterday.<br />
Q. Prime Minister, supplementary to that: Have you had discussions<br />
with the United States Government or the U. S. Embassy about the<br />
purposes of the various American bases in Australia?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No.<br />
Q. You have not?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No. </p>
<p>0. Can you tell us if any of their purposes are involved in the<br />
logistics of the American presence in Vietnam?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I'm assured they are not.<br />
I've been very careful to make all possible inquiries on that issue<br />
I'm assured that they have no bearing on any operations in Indo-China.<br />
Q. Can you tell us if you will be seeing the Americans about the<br />
full purposes of the bases and will you be able to make these<br />
purposes public either to members of Parliament or to the Australian<br />
people generally?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I've had full briefings some weeks ago by the<br />
Australian Foreign Affairs and Defence Departments and the matter<br />
is being considered by Mr Barnard.<br />
Q. Why have you remained silent over the last 10 days on the<br />
U. S. union boycott, especially, in view of the fact that you've<br />
already sent a note of protest to the President? Secondly, will you<br />
now disclose the contents of the note? Thirdly, did Cabinet today<br />
consider the boycott? If so, have you any announcement to make on<br />
that particular point?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Well, let me take it in reverse order. Cabinet<br />
did not consider this matter. It was not mentioned.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: What was the second one?<br />
Q. Contents of the note?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No, I won't disclose the contents of the note.<br />
It would be quite exceptional to disclose the contents of notes between<br />
governments unless they both agree.<br />
Q. Will they be tabled in the Parliament?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: This again would be quite exceptional. I've<br />
said nothing on this because I don't believe by grandstanding on this<br />
issue a quicker solution could have been achieved than has been<br />
achieved. And furthermore I wanted to keep a sense of proportion<br />
in this matter. What is the significant thing for the Australian<br />
Government, or the Australian Foreign Minister, to be concerned with?<br />
A shipping strike or bombing strikes?<br />
I concentrated on the issue in hand the important one.<br />
Q. How would you have been grandstanding if you had made any<br />
comment on this?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Well, I could have got even right across the front<br />
page of your paper, or any paper, if I had said anything on this issue.<br />
But ladies and gentlemen, I at least have kept a sense of proportion,<br />
even if not everybody in Australia or elsewhere has done so. There are<br />
2 ships involved 2 ships: one a cruise liner and the other, I think,<br />
a container ship. Two ships.<br />
Q. Have you told your Ministers not to make statements on<br />
foreign policy?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: The Cabinet didn't discuss this matter either, but<br />
I can assure you...<br />
0. I asked you whether you have asked your Ministers? </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER: All I choose to say is that there will be no<br />
further statements on foreign policy except by the Minister.<br />
But I would like you to understand that some of the statements<br />
that have been made were made pursuant to arrangements concluded<br />
days or a couple of weeks before while the bombing was proceeding.<br />
Q. Do you feel that the Australian-American relationship has been<br />
damaged by the events of the last couple of weeks?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No, not the events of two or three weeks ago; by<br />
the resumption of the bombing.<br />
Q. How would you like to describe what the current state of play<br />
in Australian-American relations are at the moment?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Following the cessation of the bombing and the<br />
resumption of talks the relations have improved. The only cloud on<br />
the horizon in relations between the United States and Australia<br />
arose when the bombing was resumed.<br />
Q. Was that indicated to you by the Ambassador, Sir?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Well., what indicated?<br />
Q. The damaged' state of relations between the two countries?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No, I don't say what passes between the Ambassador<br />
and me or between any of our representatives and representatives of the<br />
American Government. I'm just stating as a fact if the bombing had not<br />
been resumed relations between the present Australian Government and<br />
the United States Government would be better than they had ever been<br />
since the Second World War between any Australian Government and any<br />
American Administration. The difference is that in the period before<br />
the American and the Australian elections there was a position where<br />
the Labor Party in Australia was enthusiastic and co-operative with<br />
what the President and Administration was understood to be undertaking<br />
and desiring to achieve, and our opponents, the former Government, were<br />
sulky and sullen as they had been ever since the President took his<br />
great initiative to bring about a detente with China. We were the<br />
co-operative ones. We were the enthusiastic ones. We weren't hesitant,<br />
we weren't sulky.<br />
Q. when you said just now that the statements made by the Ministers<br />
had been pursuant to arrangements in the last two weeks, do you mean<br />
that you approved the statements criticizing the President made by<br />
Dr Cairns and Mr Cameron?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No, not all of them.<br />
Q. Some of them?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Well, what did you mean b that statement that some<br />
of the statements had been made by prior arrangements? I think<br />
Mr Uren spoke at the pleasant Sunday afternoon as a result of the<br />
arrangements which were made about a fortnight before while the<br />
bombing was on.<br />
Q. Had he told you what he was going to say?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No. </p>
<p>Q. Did any of the Ministers clear their statements with you<br />
beforehand? PRIME MINISTER: No.<br />
Q. Sir, which parts of the statements by Mr Cameron and Dr Cairns<br />
don't you approve of?<br />
PRIME M INISTER: I'll not go over this issue at all. I'm not going<br />
to say anything on this issue which would be interpreted or alleged<br />
as in any way impeding the progress of the talks in Paris.<br />
Q. Can I ask then something in relation to your approach to<br />
foreign policy concerning the United States?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Yes.<br />
Q. The previous Government made much of the fact that, as far as they<br />
were concerned, the U. S.-Australia alliance was vital to the security<br />
of Australia. Do you continue to subscribe to that?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I regard, I've said quite recently, on the eve of<br />
Christmas I think it was, that I thought that the ANZUS Treaty was<br />
our crucial international treaty and what goes on in Vietnam, what<br />
has gone on in Vietnam, has not been under ANZUS.<br />
Q. Now that the dispute over shipping appears to be on the way<br />
to being solved<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I thought it had been completely<br />
Q. Yes, the seamen have agreed. Are you now prepared to say what you<br />
think of the merits and demerits of the boycott?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Well, I don't believe that any such action helps<br />
in any way because it distracted attention from the big issue<br />
the bombing that was then going on.<br />
Q. Did you convey that feeling to the seamen?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No, I've not spoken to any officials of the unions<br />
involved. I've regarded this as a matter which was appropriate for<br />
solution in the industrial context, and that's where it has been<br />
solved.<br />
Q. Sir, do you think they were morally correct?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I make no comment on this. As I say, I'm not going<br />
to say anything which anybody can allege or construe as impeding the<br />
resumed negotiations. our whole objective has been to get the<br />
negotiations resumed. our sole interest in Vietnam now is to put an<br />
end to the war and to help in rehabilitating the country.<br />
0. Mr Prime Minister: You wrote a personal letter to the President.<br />
Have you received a personal response from him?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No. He has, however, acted in the way that I<br />
hoped he would.<br />
I think Frank here, has been waiting for a second one longer than you.<br />
May I compliment you on the birth of my god-daughter. </p>
<p>Q. Mr Prime Minister have you had any consultations or any<br />
information from Washington to assist you in assessing the progress of<br />
these negotiations?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No.<br />
Q. Have you been taken into the confidence of the American Government?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No, we do not regard ourselves as involved in any way<br />
in the hostilities. No, the Party's Platform provides, and the people<br />
gave the party a mandate to do two things: to end Australian participation<br />
in the war and to oppose the continuation of the war. Now, we have<br />
completely stopped our participation in the war. our opponents had, in fact,<br />
withdrawn all fighting men, and aircraft and ships and tanks. We,<br />
as you know, have withdrawn the training teams and have cancelled<br />
the military assistance. We are continuing the civil aid. We stand<br />
ready to give greater civil aid when the country is in a sufficient<br />
state of tranquility to be rehabilitated. But, I'd like to emphasize<br />
that our Government has V a mandate to do all it can to stop the<br />
continuation of this war and I hope this is quite clear to everyone in<br />
Australia and abroad. It's our duty to do it. It's been the Party's program<br />
since the first Federal Conference after my becoming Leader. We are<br />
opposed to a continuation of the war and to Australia's participation<br />
in it.<br />
Q. You said, somne time ago, that you thought one of the things we<br />
could do in Australia, in an independent sense, although we're<br />
not actively involved, is to try and bring about a rapprochement*<br />
between China and Japan. I was wondering, again, in an active sense<br />
a rapprochement between America and North Vietnam what we could<br />
do in an active sense and whether you had anything in mind in view<br />
of this stated aim of trying to end the war?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I think what is required is a continuation of the<br />
patient deliberations which are required of both Washington and Hanoi,<br />
and I'm sure I know that is the view of the Japanese Government<br />
also, with whom we have been in consultation.<br />
Q. Do you believe that the retaliatory action of the American<br />
longshoremen in boycotting Australian goods was either encouraged<br />
or suggested by Washington?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I would never make such an offensive supposition.<br />
I mean I assume the trade unions don't make the foreign policy of<br />
the American Administration. I assume the American Administration<br />
doesn't control the affairs of the American trade unions. In fact<br />
the union concerned, I believe, had a boycott a total boycott<br />
of many foreign flagships on the east coast and the gulf coast of the<br />
United States for over twenty years and successive Administrations were<br />
powerless to end the boycott. I don't want to belittle the<br />
ideological purity of the union concerned. I'm told that their latest<br />
boycott was on the importation of some Mao dolls made in<br />
Czechoslovakia weren't they? -Ireland which half? your part or ours?<br />
Q. In practical terms what happens what did happen in the past<br />
ten days when Australian-American relations weren't so good?<br />
That's one question. Secondly, if the Americans did start bombing<br />
North Vietnam again what would the Australian Labor Government do?<br />
Can you tell us the answer to those two questions?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: The first one: both sides went back to the conference<br />
table. The second one: I will not limit myself to a private letter,<br />
but I will be making a public statement. </p>
<p>Q. Did Cabinet consider revaluation compensation today?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No.<br />
Q. Will it be considering it tomorrow?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No. It wasn't mentioned today. It's not on<br />
the Agenda.<br />
Q. Have you had any estimate of the magnitude of economic<br />
stimuluis that would be provided by the welfare measures you've<br />
announced, and do you feel further stimulus to the economy will<br />
be required soon?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I think you had better speak on this to<br />
Mr Crean and Mr Hayden who prepared the submissions. The welfare<br />
measures will be quite a considerable stimulus to the economy<br />
because they will put purchasing power into the hands of people<br />
who have the smallest purchasing power in the community and who<br />
purchase necessities.<br />
Q. How much will the increased pensions and unemployment benefits<br />
cost? a<br />
PRIME MINISTER:, Mr Hayden will give you that.<br />
Q. I notice in the list of Cabinet Committees which was handed out<br />
before you arrived that while Mr Enderby is listed under both of<br />
his portfolios..<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Oh yes, thanks. I'm sorry.<br />
Q. Dr Cairns is listed in the Economic Committee only as Minister<br />
for Secondary Industry. Does this mean a reduction in the importance<br />
and in the policy advising role in the Department of Overseas Trade,<br />
and if so, for what reason?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I thank you for raising this. I meant to say we<br />
appointed five committees. Their names are: Economic, Welfare,<br />
Foreign Affairs and Defence, Urban and Regional Development and<br />
Legislation. You ask specifically about Dr Cairns appearing as<br />
Minister for Secondary Industry in the Economic Committee and as<br />
Minister for Overseas Trade in the Foreign Affairs and Defence<br />
Committee. The point is that Dr Cairns is on each of those<br />
Committees. The Foreign Affairs and Defence Committee will not be<br />
confined to the affairs within the jurisdiction of the-Departments of<br />
Foreign Affairs and Defence. It will cover the whole field of investment,<br />
overseas control, resources, trade, international banking and it is<br />
for this reason that the Treasurer is on it. The Minister for overseas<br />
Trade, who of course is responsible for the international ramifications<br />
of the Departments of Secondary Industry, Primary Industry, National<br />
Development and while, of course, both the Prime Minister and the<br />
Deputy Prime Minister are on it and the Lead~ r of the Government in<br />
the Senate and the Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate<br />
are both on it there is an additional significance in Senator Murphy<br />
being on it as Attorney-General, because we lay so much emphasis<br />
on the reinforcement the application of international law and order<br />
through conventions, the World Court and so on. So Dr Cairns is on in<br />
the Foreign Affairs and Defence one because Overseas Trade obviously<br />
bears on a very-great number of these matters and he is on in<br />
Secondary Industry because this concerns so much the internal economy.<br />
Perhaps I should say a bit more about it time's getting on and </p>
<p>I should have mentioned this earlier. The procedure will be<br />
that when submissions for Cabinet come to me from individual<br />
Ministers I will send them to the relevant Committee. The Committee<br />
will hopefully make a recommendation on them, they will then be<br />
listed on the Cabinet Agenda and the recommendation also listed<br />
and unless anybody wants to debate it further automatically the<br />
recommendation will become the Cabinet decision. The members of the<br />
Committees are under an obligation to attend the meetings of the Committee<br />
but any other Minister will be entitled to attend and hopefully<br />
will do so when on the documents of which every minister will receive<br />
a copy, he sees that his Department is involved.<br />
Q. Sir, could one assume that the Department of Overseas<br />
Trade will not make recommendations to the Economic Committee?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No, this is largely academic because the Minister<br />
for Qverseas Trade will, of course, be attending meetings of the<br />
EconLic Committee because he is also Minister for Secondary Industry.<br />
Q. Will the Economic Committee draft the Budget Sir?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: The Cabinet will do that, but I imagine the<br />
Economic Committee will have quite a deal to do with it in<br />
preparations, but, obviously, all these things and particularly<br />
a matter of such overwhelming importance as the Budget is a matter<br />
which I would expect the whole Cabinet will discuss. I'd be quite<br />
surprised if the Economic Committee's recommendations on the Budget<br />
were not further discussed by the whole Cabinet.<br />
Mr Prime Minister, is there anything more concrete on the move<br />
for talks with the Queensland Premier about the Torres Strait<br />
boundaries? PRIME MINISTER: I'm still awaiting a reply. Perhaps I should say<br />
I'm going from memory here that I wrote to Mr Ejelke-Petersen<br />
on the Torres Strait Island question on the 15th of last month.'<br />
The suggestion I put to him was in the same terms as the suggestion<br />
that was made to Mr McMahon by his Ministers. So I wouldn't have<br />
thought there was any political difficulty federally in putting<br />
these suggestions. They were proposed to my predecessor I made<br />
the decision to send them on.<br />
Q. Second question, Sir. Do you agree with Mr Gordon Bryant on<br />
the need for a referendum of some sort among the islanders and the<br />
Commonwealth? PRIME MINISTER: I don't comment on remarks made by my colleagues,<br />
but frankly I'm not going to get into the habit of commenting on reports<br />
which are made of or attributed to my colleagues.<br />
Q. R. Sorby, Financial Review... In outlining your list...<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Your one of the few members of the staff still<br />
on the Financial Review aren't you? Oh, are you under offer too?<br />
I mean John Fairfax has been very good to us Jim Osmond and all<br />
these other members of the staff of the Financial Review.<br />
Q. The initiatives you outlined for the next few months... you didn't<br />
put down any priorities on them? Have you any priorities for the<br />
legislation itself? Which particular one will be first off the rank,<br />
and secondly, on the offshore mineral question offshore soverei~ pty<br />
to what extent does this effect the offshore petroleum legislation? </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER: It won't affect it. You'll notice the wording was<br />
quite careful. Broadly, it would combine the Territorial Sea and<br />
Continental Shelf Bill of 1970 and the Minerals Submerged Lands Bill<br />
mentioned by Mr Swartz I think it was acting on behalf of the<br />
then Foreign Minister, Mr McMahon, at the same time. Now, you ask<br />
what priorities there are here. We have naturally been concerned<br />
at having as much legislation drafted as we can for this coming<br />
session or period to carry out our program, and the fact that<br />
I have mentioned certain things today doesn't mean that these will<br />
necessarily be the first to be implemented. Obviously those in the<br />
Social Services field will be brought in. They'll be brought in, in<br />
the first day or so. There ought to be no difficulty in drafting<br />
them, but some of the others such as the offshore legislation<br />
mightn't come in until just before Easter or ' after Easter. But we're<br />
hopeful of getting all the Bills that I've mentioned and ma * ny<br />
others which will keep us similarly busy I imagine at Cabinet meetings<br />
this month and next in the first session. The Ministers have all<br />
been asked to identify the items of the Program which will require<br />
legislation. They have been asked to do that, I think, by the end<br />
of next week I think it is. Also, they have been asked, by a week later,<br />
to suggest the references that should be made in the Governor-<br />
General's speech opening the Parliament to their pieces of legislation.<br />
Perhaps I should announce that arrangements have now been made for<br />
me to make a visit to New Zealand... Where is that? ( press comment)<br />
Across the Tasman.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: God, you'll make sayings of the year. I'll be<br />
visiting New Zealand from 20-23 of this month. The New Zealand<br />
Secretary for Foreign Affairs will also be visiting Australia commencing<br />
next Thursday for discussions with Foreign Affairs officials. My visit<br />
will coincide with the anniversary of the Canberra Pact made between<br />
New Zealand's Prime Minister Peter Fraser and our John Curtin in 1944.<br />
It was Norman Kirk's happy thought that we should have the meeting<br />
on that anniversary.<br />
Q. Has your Government had any approaches made either through the<br />
Minister or from parents for assistance in any way in claims for<br />
help and against Distillers company by parents of thalidomide children?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I haven't heard of them but this would be a matter<br />
where I think you should ask Dr Everingham. He'd be the Federal<br />
Minister who might have some information on it.<br />
Q. Is it a matter which you think the Government should or would<br />
intervene?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I wouldn't express an opinion off the cuff.<br />
I mean, quite frankly, you don't expect me to express opinions<br />
on matters which can end up in the courts.<br />
2Perhaps I should, for the sake of the international press here,<br />
mention that Mr Grassby has completed his consideration of the case<br />
of the Rolling Stones and they'll all be arriving.<br />
Q. Have you yet decided whether Mr Anthony should have his status<br />
and his salary upgraded? It is now below Mr Lynch?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: This is a painful matter. I don't think I could<br />
usefully say anything to resolve the differences. </p>
<p>12.<br />
Q. Have you yet received a letter from Mr Anthony asking you to<br />
consider it?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: To arbitrate? No. I've had letters from them about<br />
their staffs, and I expect to be discussing this with them. There are<br />
some things here which are, quite frankly, no affair of the Government.<br />
It's the Speaker who allocates accommodation, and there is legislation<br />
which describes persons in terms which the authors never expected to<br />
bear upon their own fortunes. I'll naturally be very happy to discuss<br />
the legislation but I'd like to have a combined submission.<br />
Q. I'd like to ask what can you tell us about the Commonwealth<br />
Police investigations into these two army officers perhaps<br />
Mr Barnard?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I did see a note that Mr Barnard has on the matter.<br />
I'd ask him.<br />
Q. Could we ask him?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Well, he's here is he? Yes, yes.<br />
MR BARNARD: Well, inquiries are being made into allegations made<br />
by a private businessman into or concerning two comparatively senior<br />
army officers. It would not be correct for me, of course, at this<br />
delicate stage of the investigations, to make any statement that<br />
would prejudice either the police officers who are carrying out<br />
the investigation or the army officers who have not been charged.<br />
However, I expect a report will be available, it will be considered<br />
and if charges should be made they will be. There was a sensational<br />
statement of course. It involved surplus equipment from Vietnam.<br />
There's certainly nothing in the allegations or nothing that has<br />
flowed from the investigations so far, that would substantiate<br />
such a charge.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: All our top-ranking officers have been withdrawn<br />
from Vietnam. I don't think it's very gracious to suggest that<br />
gun-running takes place in the Australian Armed Forces.<br />
I didn't know... you should have been sitting here I didn't realise<br />
you were here.<br />
Q. Prime Minister, you said that the Cabinet Meeting would continue<br />
tomorrow. Can we expect another news conference at the conclusion of it?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I think I'll just announce the decisions. I'll hand<br />
them out. I don't think we'll have another press conference. I think<br />
Mr Walsh will give you the decisions. I think that's better. Quite<br />
frankly going into tomorrow means that my appointments have to be a<br />
bit readjusted and if you'll excuse us?<br />
Q. Which Committee is drawing up the terms of reference into the<br />
P. M. G. inquiry, and when would you hope the inquiry would begin<br />
and end?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: They're meeting<br />
tonight. Do you want to know who the ministers are?<br />
Q. Well, which of these committees, the five committees?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Oh, no, no. This is an ad hoc one. it's just a meeting<br />
of half a dozen or so ministers tonight. I'll say who they are if you<br />
want to. </p>
<p>They're meeting at 8 o'clock tonight, and they're just drawing up<br />
the terms of reference and they've been authorised to approach<br />
suitable people to conduct the inquiry but I wouldn't guess as to<br />
how long the inquiry would take. We would certainly expect to have<br />
advice from the inquiry on some aspects before the Budget.<br />
Q. When you say suitable people, might it be a judicial type of<br />
inquiry? PRIME MINISTER: Maybe judges, maybe senior counsel, maybe junior<br />
counsel, maybe economists. I don't think we ought to get the idea<br />
that inquiries of this nature should be conducted only by judges.<br />
Some of the most effective inquiries conducted in Britain have been<br />
conducted by bodies on which there are no lawyers or a minority of<br />
lawyers. But clearly some economists and management people would be<br />
considered in any panel " to make this inquiry.<br />
I notice that there is quite a number of representatives from<br />
overseas newspapers. I have, on an earlier occasion, thought it might<br />
be helpful if I were to give priority to representatives of the<br />
afternoon papers. Now, maybe next week or the week after you might<br />
think it suitable the President of the gallery might suggest to<br />
me when to give priority to any members from overseas papers who<br />
want to ask questions. Let them all have one question before any<br />
of the indigenous press ask questions. I mention this partly because<br />
I've been inundated with requests for interviews by overseas newspapers<br />
and I think this is the greatest discovery of Australia since Cook,<br />
and I've been unable to oblige all the kind gentlemen concerned as yet. </p>
