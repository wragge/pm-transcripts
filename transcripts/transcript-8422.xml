PRIME MINISTER<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON. P. J. KEATING MP<br />
HEWSON " RESPONSE"<br />
Dr Hewson stands alone as the only person in Australia who<br />
thinks the Government should do nothing about the recession.<br />
Tonight he said the Government should not spend one cent to<br />
get the economy moving.<br />
His response to the One Nation plan for the future was<br />
nothing more than a litany of reasons why Australia could<br />
not succeed.<br />
Labor believes Australia can succeed.<br />
