STATEMENT BY ACTING PRJME MINISTER<br />
THE HON TIM FISCHER MP<br />
LABOR: AS OUT OF TOUCH AS EVER<br />
By opposing the Youth Allowance, Kim Beazley is sending a very clear message to the<br />
people of Australia. Labor would rather have young people on the dole than<br />
improving themselves in study or training.<br />
By its reaction to the Government's reform of payments to young people, Mr Beazley<br />
and the Labor Party has once again demonstrated how desperately out of touch it Is<br />
with mainstream Australia.<br />
The Youth Allowance addresses the Government's highest priority providing young<br />
people with jobs by changing the incentives to make it more attractive for young<br />
people to study and train than just be on the dole.<br />
M~ r Beazley obviously prefers a situation where young people are encouraged to be on<br />
the dole rather than acquiring skills for employment.<br />
All the usual scaremongering and bluster can't hide the facts that:<br />
Everyone on Newstart Allowance or sickness benefit at the time of the<br />
announcement will not have their payment affected;<br />
The new means test ( around $ 4 1,000) is more generous than Labor's was ( around<br />
$ 37,000 for a family with one child at homne), and<br />
Rural and regional Australians will also benefit by up to $ 75 per fortnight from the<br />
extension of rent assistance to young people who are studying or in training<br />
All young Australians win from having the incentive to prepare themselves for the job<br />
market. Students and young Australians undertaking vocational education, along with rural and<br />
regional families will also be better off.<br />
M~ r Beazley and Labor's reaction show they have nothing to offer young job-seekers.<br />
In this regard they remain consistent with their failed record in Government.<br />
