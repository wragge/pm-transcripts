PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 18 November 1986<br />
An Office of Multicultural Affairs is to be established within<br />
my portfolio, reporting to me and to Mr Hurford who, in<br />
addition to his present responsibilities, is to be Minister<br />
assisting me in Multicultural Affairs.<br />
The responsibilities of the Office will embrace both ethnic<br />
and multicultural affairs.<br />
It will be basically an advisory and research body, with the<br />
administration of established programs of a specific nature<br />
remaining where they are now.<br />
The general research and advisory functions in the ethnic<br />
affairs field which are presently in Mr Hurford's portfolio<br />
will be included in the new Office.<br />
Consistent with the other Offices in my portfolio, the new<br />
Office will not have a statutory basis.<br />
There will be an Advisory Council established, serviced by the<br />
Office, to report to me and to Mr Hurford as Minister<br />
Assisting. While the Office will not be responsible for programs of a<br />
specific nature, it will be responsible for the development<br />
and management of the grants-in-aid program and for some<br />
information activity and sponsorship of research.<br />
A structure for the Office, and other details associated with<br />
its establishment, are expected to be settled in the course of<br />
the next two or three weeks.<br />
Compared with previous arrangements, this new Office, and its<br />
associated Advisory Council, will be able to make a more<br />
active and effective input into the development of<br />
multicultural policies and programs. They will be well placed<br />
to promote better co-ordination and to bring to notice ethnic<br />
and multicultural interests wherever appropriate in the normal<br />
policy development and decision-making processes of the<br />
Government. </p>
