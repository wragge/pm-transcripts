    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Battle For Freedom<br />
JEFFERSON ORATION<br />
By SIR ROBERT MENZIES, The Prime Minister. of Australia</p>
<p>It is a rare privelege for the Prime Minister of a nation of something under eleven millions of people  to be invited be invited to speak, in the United States of America, on a day which commemorates the Declaration of Independence and, 50 years later, the death of its draftsman, Thomas Jefferson.</p>
<p>Yet I take comfort from the fact that, when Thomas Jefferson<br />
became President of the United States, he presided over<br />
the destiny of a nation with only half of the present population<br />
of Australia. Yet he is immortal, and his work endures. </p>
<p>There is nothing more stimulating than to recall that the<br />
American Colonies, as they moved into independence through<br />
blood and revolution and much suffering, and encountered<br />
the immense practical problems of fashioning a system of<br />
self-government, had in their service a group of men so<br />
superbly talented as Washington, Jefferson, Hamilton, Madison,<br />
John Marshall, and their great contemporaries. They did<br />
not all think the same way, but each was remarkable. These<br />
names, after a lapse of time of a century and a half, remain<br />
familiar to millions of people with even a superficial knowledge<br />
of political and constitutional ' history.<br />
But it is important to recall that men of great talent who<br />
embark upon the stormy seas of public affairs, and particularly<br />
those who achieve posts of leadership and responsibility,<br />
will frequently be over-praised by their friends and overattacked<br />
by their opponents. For the arts of propaganda are not<br />
of modern invention. They were in a flourishing state in the<br />
United States of America and elsewhere in the first quarter of<br />
the nineteenth century, and -have been practised ever since.<br />
The great trouble about all contemporary propaganda is that<br />
it tends to create a false dichotomy. The people under discussion<br />
are, so we are -asked to believe, all pure and shining, or<br />
wicked and worthless. This is, of course, absurd. History, we<br />
hope, sorts these things out and finds an immense variety of<br />
shades of grey.<br />
The art of politics, and the ' history of politicians illustrate<br />
this simple truth. For, in spite of people of allegedly superior<br />
and independent mind, politics derives its vigour from partisanship<br />
and partisans.<br />
The only non-party system of government is a dictatorship.<br />
But one by-product of the party system is that if we come into<br />
a long era of Tory domination, the names of former great<br />
Whigs become dimmed. And vice versa.<br />
The great name of Thomas Jefferson has experienced these<br />
" whirligigs of time." Greatly admired in the formative years of the United States, draftsman of -the Declaration of Independence,<br />
George Washington's first Secretary of State, Vice-<br />
President, President for two terms, his career as a statesman<br />
was a formidable and glittering one.<br />
Add to this his astonishing attainments as a scholar, a<br />
lawyer, a farmer, an architectural designer and you ' have a man<br />
not easily to -be surpassed in any country or at any time. I love<br />
the remark attributed to President Kennedy at a ' White House<br />
dinner for a notable group of guests. " I think this is the most<br />
extraordinary collection of talent, of human knowledge, that<br />
has ever been gathered together at the White House-with<br />
the possible exception of when Thomas Jefferson dined alone."<br />
Yet when his political opponents had achieved their turn of<br />
office, a turn which lasted a long time, the name of Jefferson<br />
appears to have suffered an eclipse. It was not until the twentieth<br />
century that a suitable memorial was erected to him in<br />
Washington, and Monticello re-purchased and preserved.<br />
I do not profess to understand with any precision the philosophical<br />
differences between your Democrats and Republicans<br />
of today. I suspect that your party lines are not so sharply<br />
drawn as ours are in Australia, where, as Winston Churchill<br />
once said, we " conduct our political battles with a fine eighteenth<br />
century vigor." The currents of your history -have buffetted<br />
your parties so much that no outsider could hope to<br />
trace the ' history of one party and find in it complete consistency<br />
or continuity. I am convinced that you have had great<br />
leaders of one paty who, generations later, might have proved<br />
to be leaders of another.<br />
This is, of course, inevitable in any changing world or<br />
progressive society. Yet certain beliefs have an enduring validity.<br />
This,. indeed, is the secret of Thomas Jefferson's immortality.<br />
He believed in the importance of the persistent search for<br />
truth, and therefore in the liberty of the mind. But the liberty<br />
of the mind which he sought was something which was to be<br />
enjoyed by the well-furnished mind. It has never occurred to<br />
me that he believed in the appeal from Philip Sober to Philip<br />
Drunk. He had disciplined his own mind by the most amazing<br />
intellectual training. He was equipped for freedom. He<br />
wanted others to be so. His founding of the University of<br />
Virginia was in reality his testimony to this truth; a democracy,<br />
to be effective, must be educated.<br />
Looking at the matter in the light of my own extensive<br />
experience in my own country, I would be disposed ( if, in<br />
this famous place, this. is not a species of blasphemy!) to<br />
647 </p>
<p>VITAL SPEECHES OF THE DAY<br />
think that Alexander Hamilton and his " Federalist" colleagues<br />
were right in attaching great importance to the creation<br />
of a powerful national administration and authority.<br />
I am even imprudent enough -to think that many of today's<br />
Democrats have a not dissimilar view. But Mr. Jefferson was<br />
strong against tyranny or the means of creating it. To him<br />
individual liberty was the vital essence. American history has<br />
reconciled both conceptions. For it has been your glorious<br />
destiny, notably in the turbulent years of the twentieth century,<br />
to evolve a system in which national power has grown<br />
on the basis of a passionate and Jeffersonian belief in individual<br />
freedom.<br />
The Communist powers, who have created a ruthless imperialism<br />
of their own, to the acute discomfort of their neighbours,<br />
have, for diversionary reasons of their own, painted a<br />
picture of " American imperialism."<br />
It is therefore important to recall, and to emphasise, that<br />
the interventions of the United States in world affairs have<br />
been directed, not to territorial expansion, but to the achievement<br />
and preservation of individual liberty in far-away countries<br />
where that liberty is threatened.<br />
Throughout the whole of my adult life, the great ideological<br />
conflict in the world has been -between those who believe that<br />
the national power of governments is something granted by<br />
free people to their political rulers, and those who believe in<br />
the all-powerful State which concedes to its citizens such freedoms<br />
as it thinks fit.<br />
Well before the Declaration of Independence, Jefferson himself<br />
had resolved the matter in classical terms:-<br />
' These are our grievances, which we have thus laid<br />
before His Majesty, with that freedom of language and<br />
sentiment which becomes a free people, claiming their<br />
rights as derived from the laws of nature, and not as the<br />
gift of their chief magistrate."<br />
This truth is, of course to us " self-evident," so that we find<br />
it difficult to realise that so many hundreds of millions of<br />
people either reject it or are unaware of it. Yet it is important<br />
that we should arrive at a clear realisation of the facts.<br />
We are all a little disposed, when interesting ourselves in<br />
the emerging independence of some former colony, to think<br />
that democracy can be successfully transplanted in a comparatively<br />
brief time.<br />
We are so utterly familiar with what I will call " parliamentary<br />
self-government" that we somehow forget that it has been<br />
a thing of slow and sometimes painful growth; that it has<br />
come from below, and not from above. You cannot create a<br />
democracy as quickly as you can create independence.<br />
There are still too many influential people who forget that<br />
the granting of political independence is not an end in itself.<br />
It is, indeed, a beginning, just as capable of producing a new<br />
tyranny as it is of producing an independent community of<br />
free men. Indeed, we all know of more than one case in which<br />
independence has been followed by either chaos or something<br />
singularly like dictatorship.<br />
There are lessons here for all of us. You are Americans.<br />
You detest colonialism because, to you, it connotes subordination.<br />
Whenever you see some surviving colony, somewhere,<br />
you are eager to make it independent. But it is a mistake to<br />
underestimate two factors.<br />
The first is that a modern and intelligent colonial powerlike<br />
Australia in respect of our Papua and New Guinea territory-<br />
while aiming at complete independence as the goal,<br />
realises that the process of fitting native inhabitants for selfrule<br />
must be relatively slow if it is to be relatively sure. We<br />
know a good deal about this territory, with its confusion of<br />
tribes and languages, its rugged mountains, its towns in which<br />
the Papuans are comparatively advanced in civilisation, its remote valleys and jungles in which sheer savagery survives.<br />
When well-meaning people tell us that we should create<br />
complete political independence in one blow by the simple<br />
process of creating a popular Assembly and arming it with<br />
full powers, we marvel that they should think self-government<br />
so artificial and so easy.<br />
This does not mean that we favour dilatory tactics; freedom<br />
is too precious a thing for mankind to be wantonly denied.<br />
But the best guarantee of individual freedom is the existence<br />
of a community so constructed that freedom is its daily guide.<br />
The building of such a structure, starting with the foundations<br />
and not with the roof, takes time and conscious effort.<br />
I repeat, in a slightly different way, that you cannot endow a<br />
country with democracy as simply as you can endow it with<br />
money or goods.<br />
I am saying these things because I think that we are all in<br />
danger of considering our international relations in too<br />
limited a way. The great issues of peace or war, of armaments<br />
and alliances, remain paramount so long as we live in a world<br />
in which aggressors multiply and are strong.<br />
The great issues of trade, to which we are all currently<br />
directing much attention, have all the complexities which are<br />
inevitable when legitimate national interests have to be reconciled<br />
with the clear need for growing markets and rising production<br />
in a world whose population is increasing at an almost<br />
bewildering rate. But are we yet doing enough to increase<br />
our knowledge of other peoples, or their knowledge of us?<br />
If, as Mr. Jefferson did, we believe that an informed democracy<br />
is the greatest and most humane system of government<br />
ever devised; that it elevates and enfranchises the individual<br />
citizen; that it reconciles some demagogery with much dignity;<br />
are we doing enough to make it understood by other<br />
nations and peoples? Are we, perhaps, too negative in our<br />
democratic faith, defending it against aggression from outside,<br />
but not doing enough -to preach its gospel abroad? What<br />
would Mr. Jefferson do and say if he could revisit us and look<br />
out upon this new world? For freedom was his burning faith.<br />
It was not something just for the study or for reflection. It<br />
was a faith to be practised, but it was also a faith to be<br />
preached. For Mr. Jefferson was a vastly civilised man, with<br />
the roots of his learning and philosophy deep in the soil of the<br />
old world. Virginia itself was a characteristically English community<br />
in many essentials. The colonies themselves felt no<br />
sense of quarrel with the people of Britain. Yet, when the need<br />
arose, they took up arms and by declaration, severed their ties<br />
with their mother country.<br />
Here was no war for territory. Here, indeed, was no ideological<br />
war in the sense in which we now understand that<br />
expression. It was simply a battle for freedom, fought in fact<br />
against an unimaginative government in London and British<br />
soldiers and mercenaries in America, though in form, ( ironically<br />
enough) against -the people of Britain, whose record in<br />
the achievement and defence of freedom was and is so long<br />
and honourable.<br />
This is one of the paradoxes of history, but, in the result,<br />
a happy one. For, just as ' the issue of the War of Independence<br />
was freedom, so was freedom the result, exalted in the minds<br />
of the colonists and destined to give character and direction<br />
to their later national history.<br />
You are today doing great honour to an Australian. May I,<br />
therefore, say something about my own country and yours?<br />
Australia has, I need hardly say, many points of contact and<br />
understanding with the United States. It is the fashion among<br />
a few cynical observers to treat our friendly attachment to<br />
your country as a sort of " cupboard love," based upon selfinterest<br />
in a dangerous world. This is a superficial view, for<br />
at least three reasons.<br />
648 </p>
<p>JOHN BARTLOW MARTIN64<br />
When Britain's colonial adventure in America ended<br />
in 1782 with the birth of a new nation, Captain Cook<br />
had already explored and reported upon the East Coast<br />
of Australia, but there had been no white settlement.<br />
It -had been the practise in Britain in the 18th century<br />
to transport to -the colonies large numbers of persons<br />
convicted of offences ( many of them very trivial)<br />
against the law. Between 1717 and the War of Independence<br />
the historian records that some 50,000 English<br />
convicts were received into America. But this had<br />
now ceased. Where could such people be sent in<br />
future? The choice ultimately fell on Australia, the<br />
particular site chosen being Botany Bay, just south of<br />
Sydney. A fler under Captain Phillip arrived at Botany<br />
Bay in 1788, and the modern history of Australia<br />
began The first settlers were convicts and their custodians.<br />
In short, a colony began in my own country<br />
just after and because colonialism ended in America.<br />
When people in England make jesting remarks to me<br />
about these lowly origins of our now thriving and<br />
law-abiding Commonwealth, I make the good-natured<br />
retort that, though many thousands of convicted persons<br />
were sent to America, and many thousands to<br />
Australia, -the records show -that the great majority of<br />
persons convicted in England during the transportation<br />
era remained in England.<br />
The whole point I make is that, though nobody<br />
could have foreseen it at the rime, your War of Independence<br />
created as it turned out, two nations; one<br />
your own, the other Australia.<br />
When, at the close of the 19th century, the Australian<br />
colonies decided to federate and become one nation,<br />
it was to -the Constitution of the United States that<br />
the draftsmen of the Australian Constitution turned<br />
for light and leading.<br />
During the months and years in which some of the<br />
best political and legal thinkers in Australia were engaged<br />
in the work of drafting, the Constitution of the<br />
United States of America was never far away from<br />
hand. In the great Convention Debates, the decisions<br />
of the United States Supreme Court were extensively<br />
cited. True, your Union had grown out of armed conflict;<br />
ours came more peacefully, by reason and argument,<br />
the gradual persuading of self-governing colonies, each<br />
with a well-defined local pride, that a national existence<br />
should be achieved. It came about that the Australian<br />
distribution of legislative powers between<br />
Commonwealth and States is much like your own. The<br />
separation of powers, legislative, executive and judicial,<br />
though not, perhaps, such a high matter of doctrifle as with you, still makes its impact upon judicial<br />
decisions. Your founders were, of course, much influenced by<br />
the great French commentators upon a British C6nstitution<br />
which in a real sense had no existence. And<br />
so, for example, your Executive does not sir in Congress<br />
or, in a direct sense, answer -to it. But we inherited,<br />
and bad long practised, responsible Cabinet<br />
government, with Ministers sitting in Parliament and<br />
answering to it and, from time to time, being put out<br />
of office by it. It is this fact which gives a special<br />
colour to the Australian Constitution, and provides an<br />
underlying difference partly concealed by remarkable<br />
similarities of form.<br />
In my bhey-day at the Bar of -the High Court of<br />
Australia in constitutional cases, it was still the practise<br />
to make much reference to the currents of American<br />
judicial opinion, currents, may I say, in which backeddies<br />
have occasionally occurred, but the main stream<br />
of which, as in Australia, has moved towards an enlarging<br />
interpretation of national powers. We may not<br />
always like this if we believe in a federal and not a<br />
unitary system of government and see, as Mr. Jefferson<br />
did, some guarantee of individual liberty in a<br />
division of governmental powers.<br />
But there has been, particularly in times of national<br />
emergency or strain, a real value in a Constitution<br />
which can be applied to new circumstances without<br />
crippling rigidity.<br />
But 1 grow tedious. All I really wanted to say was<br />
that, if the na-mes of your great founders and brilliant<br />
political philosophers are familiar in Australian minds<br />
and mouths, it is largely because our constinutional<br />
history -has been profoundly influenced by your own. A<br />
Jefferson memorial would not be out of place in<br />
Canberra. My third reason has, I believe, a fine Jeffersonian ring.<br />
For I feel sure' that Mr. Jefferson, though he worked<br />
primarily for the liberty of Americans and felt no call<br />
to impose his views on an older world, would, confronted<br />
by the -problems of the modern world, have<br />
vastly approved the world defence of individual liberty,<br />
a defence in which the U. S. A. is playing such a splendid<br />
and vital part.<br />
Australia has a deep feeling for your country, not<br />
just because your friendship contributes so greatly to<br />
our national security, but basically because, great or<br />
small, we work for the same kind of free world. The<br />
freedom of man is not a local perquisite and cannot be<br />
defended in isolation. There can be no better place<br />
than Monticello in which to remind ourselves of this<br />
great, though occasionally forgotten, truth.</p>
