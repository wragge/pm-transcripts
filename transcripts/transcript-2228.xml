COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA<br />
SPEECH BY<br />
The Rt Hon. J. G. GORTON, M. P.<br />
ON<br />
BACKGROUND TO COMMONWEALTH-STATE<br />
TALKS ON OFF-SHORE LEGISLATION<br />
( Ministerial Statement)<br />
[ From the ' Parliamentary Debates,' 15 May 1970.]<br />
Mr GORTON ( Higgins-Prime Minister)<br />
-by leave-This is not a statement on the<br />
control of off-shore minerals or on the need<br />
to decide where proper legal authority for<br />
that control should lie. That is best left for<br />
a discussion of the Bill. But last Friday the<br />
former Minister for National Development,<br />
the honourable member for Farrer ( Mr<br />
Fairbairn), placed before the House his<br />
interpretation of meetings with the States<br />
and his belief that the Commonwealth<br />
Government had broken commitments which<br />
he had made with the States. I think that<br />
that interpretation is mistaken and I believe<br />
I should put on the record the Government's<br />
interpretation in this matter. In<br />
February 1969 Cabinet decided that the<br />
Commonwealth should legislate to assert<br />
total rights over the seabed outside the<br />
3-mile limit. It deputed the Minister for<br />
National Development to inform the State<br />
Ministers for Mines of this decision. This,<br />
Sir, was not an offer to the States. It was<br />
not an approach which said: ' If you agree<br />
to us legislating for control outside the<br />
3-mile limit we will agree to you controlling<br />
inside the 3-mile limit'. It was simply a<br />
clear and unequivocal statement of intention<br />
on the part of the Government.<br />
At the Australian Minerals Council meeting<br />
of 3rd March, the Minister made a statement<br />
setting this out very clearly. The state-<br />
16067/ 70 ment begins on page 39 of the tc-anscript<br />
and the significant words are on page 41.<br />
They are:<br />
As to off-shore minerals other than petroleum,<br />
the Commonwealth is of the view that it should<br />
proceed on the footing that it enjoys total rights<br />
outside the three-mile limit. It proposes to legislate<br />
in pursuance of this position.<br />
On page 44 of the transcript the Minister<br />
was asked:<br />
When do you intend to legislate?<br />
And he replied:<br />
No date has been set but I assume it wilt be<br />
done as soon as is reasonably possible.<br />
From that time forth all the discussions and<br />
all the proposed arrangements were held<br />
against the background that the Commonwealth<br />
had announced its intention to<br />
legislate and to legislate as soon as was<br />
reasonably possible The Ministe'r undertook<br />
at that meeting that there would be further<br />
discussions with the States before the legislation<br />
was actually introduced. But those<br />
discussions were not to be on whether the<br />
Commonwealth would legislate, or when it<br />
would legislate, because clear statements of<br />
intention had been made on that. They were<br />
to be discussions on consequential matters<br />
which would arise as a result of the legislation<br />
we had announced-matters of<br />
administration, royalties and things of that<br />
kind. Such discussions were in fact held in </p>
<p>September 1969. The March 1969 meeting<br />
closed with the ordinary, normal, machinery<br />
provision that the next meeting of the<br />
Minerals Council, to discuss these matters,<br />
would be held in Perth in February 1970.<br />
Then on 30th July the former Minister for<br />
National Development wrote to me. He said<br />
that he wished to write to the States and<br />
indicate that he was unable to hold a meeting<br />
before the one scheduled for February<br />
1970, and he also wished to write to them to<br />
tell them that the Commonwealth would not<br />
legislate unilaterally until there had been an<br />
opportunity to discuss fully and frankly the<br />
views he had expressed to them at the<br />
March meeting. I replied on 18th August<br />
raising no objection to his writing to the<br />
States on the general matter of the meeting.<br />
However, I said:<br />
I would want to avoid if at all possible a situation<br />
where the Commonwealth became committed to<br />
long drawn out discussion or consultation with<br />
the States on this matter. For this reason I would<br />
prefer that you eliminate from your proposed<br />
letter the suggestion that the Commonwealth will<br />
not legislate unilaterally until after the completion<br />
of full and frank discussions with the States on<br />
this matter.<br />
I think the Minister fully understood that I<br />
did not want to give any assurance to the<br />
States that we would defer legislation, for<br />
after receiving my letter the Minister did not<br />
write to the States in the terms he had proposed,<br />
or, indeed, write to them at all.<br />
Further, I think the Minister was in no<br />
doubt that the introduction of legislation<br />
did not depend on prior agreement with the<br />
States, for his quotation from his letter to<br />
me of 30th July is immediately followed by<br />
In the meantime my Department is pressing on<br />
with the basic work necessary for the preparation<br />
of legislation. This will be of value whether or not<br />
we eventually succeed in achieving an amicable<br />
arrangement with the States.<br />
The ' amicable arrangement' referred to was<br />
on the regime-not on whether we should<br />
legislate. The Minister then arranged, or<br />
agreed to, a meeting of the Minerals Council<br />
to be held on 26th September 1% 9. That<br />
meeting was held against the background I<br />
have just outlined. That is, the State<br />
Ministers had been told by the Minister<br />
that we proposed to legislate as soon as<br />
possible. The discussions wbich had been<br />
suggested were not discussions on whether<br />
or when we should legislate, but discussions<br />
on the administrative and other consequential effects of our legislation on what is<br />
called the regime. And the Minister was<br />
proceeding on the basis that the introduction<br />
of legislation did not depend on agreement<br />
being reached with the States.<br />
I can see no evidence in the records<br />
before the House that in the September<br />
transcript there was anything to show that<br />
this position was changed. The Minister<br />
does not retract his previous statement that<br />
we intended to legislate. Nor did he retract<br />
the statement that we intended to legislate<br />
as soon as possible. He did agree that there<br />
would be further discussions. There have<br />
been further discussions and I have no<br />
doubt that there will continue to be more<br />
discussions. But I can see no commitment<br />
that he would delay our legislation until<br />
after those discussions had been held. In<br />
short, Sir, it seems to me that the transcript<br />
shows that we were committed to further<br />
discussions but not to prior discussions.<br />
What happened was that the State Ministers,<br />
through Mr Griffith, made an opening<br />
statement expressing the view that the<br />
petroleum legislation should be taken as<br />
the model for further legislation. That is,<br />
it was suggested that no attempt should be<br />
made to discover where sovereignty and<br />
responsibility in this matter legally residewhich<br />
was the object of the Commonwealth<br />
Government's legislation. The Minister<br />
undertook to place these views before<br />
Cabinet and, Mr Speaker, he had verbal<br />
authority to say that he would place those<br />
views before Cabinet. This was done by the<br />
incoming Minister. Cabinet considered them<br />
carefully, but it decided that -the question of<br />
legal responsibility should in the national<br />
interest be determined.<br />
That meeting of 26th September then<br />
discussed, from page 6 of the transcript<br />
until page 39, the method by which new<br />
titles should be granted in what was called<br />
the ' interim' period, or the ' interregnum'.<br />
That is, I take it, the period between the<br />
date of the discussions and the date when<br />
Commonwealth legislation was to be introduced.<br />
That discussion on the method of<br />
issuing titles arose because the Minister had<br />
told the States in March that pending the<br />
introduction of the legislation he had<br />
announced to them he did not wish the<br />
States to issue new titles outside the 3-mile<br />
limit unless the Commonwealth had first<br />
concurred. </p>
<p>The States did not wish to accept this.<br />
They wished to issue titles themselves out<br />
to the continental shelf, with the Commonwealth<br />
merely having the authority to<br />
object if there was a Commonwealth bead<br />
of power involved. It was this matter with<br />
which the discussions of 26th September<br />
were concerned, from, as I have said, page<br />
6 to page 39 of the transcript. I can see in<br />
them nothing to substantiate the claim that<br />
they contained -any commitment, or any<br />
agreement, as to whether or when the Commonwealth<br />
should legislate. But the former<br />
Minister thinks he does see in them passages<br />
which show he entered into a commitment.<br />
So I will examine these passages which he<br />
quotes, for while I do not for a moment<br />
reflect on his own beliefs, I do not think<br />
that the passages he quotes support his own<br />
beliefs. He quotes a passage from his letter<br />
to me, which reads:<br />
I will suggest that the matter be taken up at the<br />
next scheduled meeting of the Minerals Council,<br />
which is set down for February 1970.<br />
And he says rightly that I did not object to<br />
this. But this means merely that the<br />
Minister had written to me saying he did<br />
not feel that he could propose a firm date<br />
for a meeting before February and the<br />
' matter' referred to is the discussion on the<br />
administrative arrangements consequent on<br />
the Minister's announcement that we intended<br />
to legislate. Next he quotes a<br />
passage from page 18 of the transcript in<br />
which he agrees to hold a meeting in<br />
December, instead of February, if the States<br />
wish. This is evidence that there was to be<br />
another meeting or meetings, but that question<br />
was never in doubt. In fact there have<br />
bbee enm omree, e tibnugts ita nids ntohte rae cwoimll, m iIt maemn t suthrea, t'<br />
nothing would be done by the Commonwealth<br />
before there was a further meeting<br />
or meetings. After all, we had already<br />
announced our intentions to legislate as<br />
soon as possible and discussions had to be<br />
held on matters flowing from that discussion.<br />
The former Minister next quotes Mr<br />
Griffith on page 24 of the transcript:<br />
I have pressed you to a meeting in December and<br />
with this in mind-the possibility of the status quo<br />
arrangements being continued until the Commonwealth<br />
and the States come to a mutual arrangement-<br />
I would gladly withdraw and suggest you<br />
call the meeting when you are ready.<br />
The former Minister asks: ' Are not those<br />
the words of a man who believes he has<br />
entered into an agreement?' But the transcript shows that the answer to that question<br />
must be no, because what Mr Griffith was<br />
saying to the Minister was: ' Let us-the<br />
States-continue to issue titles as we are<br />
doing at present. Do not change that during<br />
the interregnum. If you will agree to this I<br />
will not press for an early meeting.' But the<br />
Minister replied that he could not agree to<br />
the suggestion as put and that if the States<br />
issu~ ed titles without first conferring with<br />
the Commonwealth-' It is on your own<br />
head.' Mr Griffith at once replied-page<br />
26 of the transcript:<br />
It looks to me as if you will not come our way at<br />
all. You are not proposing to budge an inch from<br />
the March statement. You are not prepared to<br />
give us anything.<br />
Mr Speaker, those are not the words of a<br />
man who believes he has entered into an<br />
agreement. The next passage quoted, from<br />
page 30, is an exchange between Mr<br />
Griffith and Mr Bowen which shows nothing<br />
except that Mr Griffith was asking what<br />
would happen under the legislation which<br />
the Commonwealth had said it proposed<br />
to introduce to assert control outside the<br />
3-mile limit. The last passage quoted by<br />
the Minister arises in this way: The Minister<br />
stated on page 36 that in the interim period<br />
the Commonwealth could not go further<br />
than to say that it would support titles<br />
issued by the States if there had been consultations<br />
with the Commonwealth, but he<br />
would not guarantee to support such titles<br />
if there had not been consultations. Mr<br />
Griffith said he was prepared to leave that<br />
matter on that basis and suggested not that<br />
the States would accept a later meeting to<br />
meet the convenience of the Commonwealth<br />
but that they wanted a later meeting<br />
-in May-so that there would be an<br />
opportunity for some of the members to<br />
visit the north of Western Australia at that<br />
time. To this the Minister replied:<br />
All right, and we would have an interim meeting<br />
as soon as we are ready to discuss this particular<br />
matter. Since the particular matter discussed for the<br />
last 30 pages of the transcript bad been the<br />
method of issuing titles in the interim<br />
period I think it is difficult to think that<br />
this particular matter can refer to anything<br />
but that.<br />
Sir, I have spent some time on these<br />
excerpts quoted by the former Minister<br />
because they are the evidence he produces<br />
to suggest a breach of commitment by the </p>
<p>Commonwealth. I do not think that they<br />
support that charge. They do show a commitment<br />
to further discussions. But the<br />
Government does not think they show a<br />
commitment to refrain from announcing<br />
legislation before those discussions. Mr Fife,<br />
a member of the Council, summed it up<br />
on page 39 of the transcript when talking<br />
about the Press release which might be<br />
made. He said:<br />
I think all we need to say is that we have<br />
asked the Commonwealth to agree to a proposition<br />
similar to the off-shore petroleum legislation.<br />
Secondly the Commonwealth has agreed to consider<br />
this proposal.<br />
That was all. Yet I do not believe the<br />
honourable member for Farrer would make<br />
the statements he has made unless he<br />
thought he had a basis for them. We have<br />
only the transcripts to go on. It may be that<br />
there was an impression not shown by the<br />
transcripts. Maybe there was an impression<br />
left around the table that there would be<br />
discussions-not just discussions but discussions<br />
before the Commonwealth proceeded<br />
on the course or announced again<br />
the course which it had previously<br />
announced, with additions. But the records<br />
do not show it. All they show is that while<br />
there was an undertaking for further discussion-<br />
which has taken place on some<br />
matters-there was no undertaking recorded<br />
by the Minister on behalf of the Commonwealth<br />
that that legislation would be<br />
deferred until after those discussions.<br />
But, even assuming that there was an<br />
impression, an understanding, a feeling in<br />
the minds of the people around the table,<br />
which does not appear in the records of the meeting-let us assume that that is so<br />
-what in fact flows from that? It would<br />
mean, on that assumption, that there was<br />
an impression in the Minerals Council that<br />
before further discussion the Minerals<br />
Council would be informed of the Commonwealth's<br />
decision on their proposals to<br />
it. Well, the Minerals Council was not so<br />
informed. It was not called together. It<br />
was not so informed although each<br />
individual member of the Council was<br />
individually informed. So I suggest that<br />
even if that impression was there-and this<br />
is not evident in the transcript-that is the<br />
most that can be made from that approach.<br />
So I believe that the records sustain no<br />
charge of ill faith. I think the most that<br />
can be said of any impression, if there was<br />
any, was that the Council was not called<br />
together to be told of the Commonwealth's<br />
rejection of its proposals for petroleum<br />
legislation. I think that all these papers are before<br />
the House for analysis by each honourable<br />
member. I believe that that seems a flimsy<br />
ground on which to accuse the Government<br />
of dishonour and it is not supported by the<br />
record. I do not doubt for one moment<br />
that the former Minister has given his<br />
interpretation with sincerity and that he has<br />
expressed his views of the feeling of the<br />
meeting at which he presided-and he could<br />
well be supported by others. I do not doubt<br />
that he has given that interpretation with<br />
sincerity. But, Sir, so has the Government<br />
on the record which it has placed before<br />
these Houses of Parliament.<br />
Motion ( by Mr Snedden) proposed:<br />
That the House take note of the paper.<br />
