    <content><![CDATA[<p>63/ 134<br />EMBARGO NOT TO BE PUBLISHED BROADCAST OR TELEC-AST BEFOBE 7,15 PM<br />ON TUESDAY, HVEM3ER 19.<br />BROADCAST NO. 3<br />BROADCAST 3Y TT-E PRIME MINISTERo THE RT. HON.<br />SIR ROBERT MENZIES, OVER ABC NA. IIONAL STATIONS<br />AT 7.15 PM ON TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 19, 1963<br />here does labour stand on Australia's alliances and<br />mutual security arrangements? This is a tremendously important<br />question, for we are living in a very dangerous world, and we<br />need friends if we are to survive.<br />The Labour Party's policy and I must keep on<br />emphasising this is not made by Mr. Calwell and his Parliamentary<br />colleagues. It is made for them by an outside group six from<br />each State not elected by the people, and not responsible to<br />them. Yet what a majority of the 36 decide to be labour policy<br />absolutely binds Mr. Calwell and his colleagues, whatever they<br />say or promise during an election. Cast your minds back only a<br />few months to the time when the 36 were meeting behind closed<br />doors at Canberra to decide whetiier Labour should oppose the<br />establishment of an American Naval Communications Station at North<br />West Cape-a station whose work could be absolutely vital to<br />Australia s security in the event of war.<br />You remember the picture: Mr. Calwell and Mr. ihitlam,<br />the aspiring Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Minister of Australia,<br />wAtig outside in the cold, waiting for their orders. The leftwingers<br />inside, no lovers of America, were just beaten by the<br />narrowest of majorities (: Thich could of course quite easily be<br />reversed next time!) and an instruction came out to these so-called<br />leaders that they could approve, on unacceptable terms.<br />Neither my colleagues nor I speaking for Australia at<br />international conferences and in direct discussions with Prime<br />Ministers and Presidents, have over had to cable for instructions<br />from a body of men, not in Cabinet or Parliament, to whom we owed<br />obedience. Do you think that the new order would strengthen<br />Australia's voice and authority abroad? Do you think that it will<br />strengthen our alliances, our understandings and our security?<br />Labourts outside law-makin; body has a curious history,<br />in practice. Only a feui years ago it was opposed to increased<br />defence, it was demanding the recall of our troops from Malaya it<br />was following the very left-wing line internationally. Recently,<br />and quite obviously for purposes of this election, it switched;<br />but in a curiously ambiguous way. It will support Malaysia, but<br />only on terms which it knows to be impossible. It will support<br />defence? but only at the expense of setting aside the modern<br />conception of very mobile and heavily armed forces available whore<br />they are needed, and reverting to a curious and antiquated notion<br />of defending Australia along its coastline; a sort of Maginot line<br />conception. At the same time, it wishes to deprive our nuclear allies<br />of any right to defend us rith nuclear weapons South of the<br />Equator against a Comaunist nuclear attack from North of the<br />Equatorl / 2</p>
<p>-2<br />The truth is that the though Mr. Calwell<br />is no more a Communist than I am, must compromise with the<br />left wing to survive.<br />I can't discover that the Labour Party has plans<br />to make any new friends internationally unless it is by voting<br />to install Communist China in the Security Council and give<br />it a crushing diplomatic victory all over South-East Asia.<br />But I have observed that Mr. Calwell is pledged to do two<br />things in relation to the United States. One is to ' e-negotiate"<br />the North West Cape Agreement, which has already been signed<br />and ratified. The other is ( if I understand him) to cancel<br />our most valuable agreement about the TFX bomber:<br />Is this what you want in the voice of Australia?<br />a nation which, to live must command the respect and confidence<br />of the outside free world?<br />You will make your answer on November 30th, There<br />will be no useful second thoughts thereafter.</p>
