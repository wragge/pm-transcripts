PRIME MINISTER<br />
ADDRESS BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THU R0n P. J. EATING, NP<br />
NATIONAL PRESS CLUB, CANBERRA, 22 JULY 1993<br />
It is a pleasure as usual to be here, even for the<br />
nineteenth time.<br />
I thought I should come along and be re-assured that I<br />
exist. I was a pretty sure I did; my colleagues assured<br />
me, the numerous people with whom I have been consulting,<br />
the people on talkback, the people on committees, the<br />
Chinese, the Koreans, various Heads of State. They all<br />
seemed happy with the degree of my visibility.<br />
But I should have remembered the old maxim I speak at<br />
the National Press Club therefore I am.<br />
Let me begin with a quotation from a very familiar<br />
source. When King George VI died Robert Gordon Menzies made the<br />
following observation:<br />
The death of the King has once more reminded us that<br />
our great Commonwealth is united, not by legal<br />
bonds, not by the Crown as an abstract notion, not<br />
by fine-spun constitutional theories, but by a<br />
common and all-powerful human emotion which discards<br />
form and penetrates instantly to the substantial<br />
truth.<br />
It is not very often that I quote the words of Bob<br />
Menzies. My opponents do it enough for all of us.<br />
The Liberal Party is like a hound which cannot be induced<br />
to leave its master's grave. It is always scratching<br />
around in the dust for a hint, an indication, some sign<br />
which will tell them who they are, and what they stand<br />
for, and what they should do next.<br />
But I agree with what Bob Menzies said in this instance. </p>
<p>2<br />
I agree that what unites a nation or a Commonwealth<br />
has less to do with the law than with feelings held in<br />
common. 9<br />
Menzies developed a very similar philosophy about the<br />
Queen. He took her extraordinarily popular visit in 1954<br />
to be evidence that Australians' affection for her " was<br />
one of the most powerful elements converting them from a<br />
mass of individuals to a great cohesive nation."<br />
I agree with him there too.<br />
I agree that there is such a thing as national sentiment<br />
and that it is a powerful force in the shaping of a<br />
nation, in the cohesion of a nation, in the success of a<br />
nation. I agree that in the 1950s and for a surprisingly long<br />
time afterwards Australia's unity with Britain was built<br />
on something more than friendship it was built on an<br />
implicit sense of unity, on an instinct.<br />
And I agree that in 1954 the Throne of England, and in<br />
particular the new Queen, constituted a considerable<br />
element of Australia's national sentiment.<br />
I agree with all this. I think more national sentiment is<br />
what we need now, and more unity, and cohesion.<br />
We need it because the old affections are not there in<br />
the same way.<br />
Even though there is widespread affection for the<br />
monarch, there is simply not the same affection for the<br />
monarchy. Our relationship with Britain has changed irreversibly<br />
as irreversibly as our culture and the composition of our<br />
people has changed.<br />
We are a very different country in a very different<br />
world, faced with entirely new challenges which will have<br />
to be met in entirely new ways.<br />
In Asia and the Pacific we have opportunities of a kind<br />
we have never been offered before.<br />
To grasp them I believe we need a new sense of unity a<br />
new kind of national sentiment.<br />
And in 1993 it can only come from one place. From<br />
Australia from the democracy, from shared values,<br />
shared aspirations, from the necessities we face.<br />
I have been saying it for some time now: we need a sense<br />
of common purpose, of fellow feeling the things which<br />
will both inspire Australians and bind them together. </p>
<p>And if you could transport Bob Menzies from the era in<br />
which he lived, and put him down in this one with all the<br />
necessities it imposes on us, and all the opportunities,<br />
I am pretty sure he would say the same.<br />
We cannot expect to change the direction of our trade and<br />
commerce, adapt to the revolutionary changes in the<br />
processes of production and the nature of work and to the<br />
equally radical changes in the global economy without<br />
cultural change.<br />
We cannot expect to live in this new era with the<br />
institutions, symbols and attitudes of an old one.<br />
We cannot find our place in this new world without<br />
finding and cementing the common ground among ourselves.<br />
These are not radical ideas. They are common-sense ideas<br />
pragmatic ideas.<br />
Let me say it again, if only for John Howard's sake: many<br />
of the things which bound together the Australians of<br />
Menzies, era are either irrelevant or no longer on offer.<br />
In fact there is something much better on offer: there is<br />
the chance to make good in our region, which is the<br />
fastest growing in the world; and to do it on our own, by<br />
our own collective initiative and genius.<br />
In the last decade of the twentieth century the chance<br />
exists for this generation of Australians to set<br />
Australia up for the DeA century.<br />
That is why last year I made a deliberate decision to<br />
depart from the usual overseas travel priorities of<br />
Prime Ministers by concentrating first on Australia's<br />
main regional relationships.<br />
So, as you know, I went to Indonesia, Papua New Guinea,<br />
Japan, Singapore, Cambodia.<br />
And this year to New Zealand, Korea and China.<br />
To our regional partners I wanted to underline<br />
Australia's credentials as an economic and political<br />
player in the Asia-Pacific; to emphasise our commitment<br />
to economic engagement in the region; and to strengthen<br />
our voice in regional affairs.<br />
To the Australian public, I wanted to underline the<br />
enormous benefits that will accrue to our country through<br />
closer economic integration with the region.<br />
During the 1980s the countries of North-East and South-<br />
East Asia grew twice as fast as the rest of the world.<br />
During the 1990s they seem likely to easily repeat that<br />
performance. </p>
<p>But one of the main messages I wanted to impress in Korea<br />
and elsewhere in Asia, is that Australia is very well<br />
placed to expand our exports of technology-based goods<br />
and services.<br />
And in both Korea and China there was concrete evidence<br />
that the expansion and diversification of our trade is<br />
already gathering pace.<br />
The radical reform and continuing growth of the Chinese<br />
economy are providing numerous opportunities for<br />
Australian companies and, as you know, I was able to<br />
witness a number of joint venture signings between<br />
Australia and Chinese enterprises.<br />
The Chinese leaders made it clear that they were<br />
interested in a long-term strategic relationship with<br />
Australia in the development of the Chinese steel and<br />
woollen textile industries.<br />
At my discussions in Korea and China there was agreement<br />
to strengthen the government-based mechanisms which<br />
support these important economic relationships for<br />
Australia. And our Trade Minister, Peter Cook, will<br />
follow with visits to both countries in September.<br />
I went to Indonesia last year with great enthusiasm.<br />
in the course of that trip and my subsequent ones to<br />
other East Asian countries the enthusiasm has become<br />
conviction. I came away from Korea and China last month more than<br />
ever convinced of the enormous potential the East Asian<br />
economies provide for Australian business and therefore<br />
the potential for Australia's future our integration with<br />
the region holds.<br />
I came away more convinced of this, and more convinced of<br />
the potential of APEC.<br />
The Korean and Chinese leaders very much agree with our<br />
view about the importance of ensuring that the economies<br />
of North America and the Western Pacific be locked<br />
together in one great and dynamic market.<br />
Since my return, of course, President Clinton has issued<br />
his invitation to host an APEC leaders meeting in Seattle<br />
this November.<br />
President Clinton's announcement is very good news for<br />
Australia. It opens up an historic opportunity to<br />
promote the economic integration of the Asia-Pacific<br />
region in a way that serves the interest of all members. </p>
<p>It is important that the process of Asia-Pacific economic<br />
cooperation provides genuine benefits not only to the<br />
advanced economies of the United States and Japan, but<br />
also to the rapidly developing economies of South East<br />
Asia. If the Seattle APEC leaders meeting goes ahead as<br />
proposed and I am fairly confident that it will it<br />
will put Australia at a table which really matters:<br />
the APEC economies account for half the world's<br />
output and forty per cent of world exports<br />
three quarters of Australia's exports now go to the<br />
APEC region<br />
Establishing a process of periodic leaders' meetings will<br />
greatly increase the status and authority of APEC a<br />
forum which, of course, Australia was instrumental in<br />
creating and has helped define and promote ever since.<br />
The process is necessarily long-term. But this is the<br />
best evidence of progress towards that goal, and the best<br />
possible spur for further progress.<br />
There is, then, this extraordinary opportunity for<br />
Australia. We should not overestimate the speed with which the<br />
process will occur. But it is even more essential not to<br />
underestimate the chance it gives us.<br />
It is essential that we are positive in our approach to<br />
it. And essential that we find the common purpose and<br />
collective will to grasp it.<br />
It is essential that we find the national unity our<br />
effort will require.<br />
Most of you will know that famous story about Menzies<br />
which got him into a bit of trouble at the time: how he<br />
came back from Britain in 1941 and said to the waiting<br />
press how despondent he felt upon returning to all the<br />
local petty politicking.<br />
I love politicking I think it is how the democracy<br />
advances but when I came back from China last month I<br />
think I had an inkling of what he experienced.<br />
I thought here is this fantastic opportunity for<br />
Australia, an historic opportunity to which the whole<br />
national effort really should be turned.<br />
But what do we hear? </p>
<p>23/ 07 ' 93 16: 02 006 273 2923 PM PRESS OFFICEApart<br />
from the usual healthy and not-so-healthy cynicism<br />
we always hear, we hear in the debate over the Mabo<br />
judgement a mad retreat to parochialism and petty self<br />
interest. We hear politicians playing to the lowest denominator of<br />
public opinion.<br />
We hear deliberate misinformation and the encouragement<br />
of outright bigotry.<br />
All this on an issue of fundamental importance, not only<br />
to the Australian economy, but to the values on which<br />
Australian democracy, the Australian ethos, and<br />
Australia's reputation abroad are built.<br />
There has been an element of mischievous and ill-informed<br />
journalism in the Mabo debate. But the primary<br />
debilitating role-has been played by the Opposition.<br />
Tim Fischer goes to Hong Kong and assures his audience<br />
that there is nothing to fear. In Hong Kong he tells the<br />
truth. But in Australia he tells the people that they<br />
will lose their backyards. In Australia he tries to whip<br />
up fear and panders to the worst feelings in the<br />
community. Yet, we expect this from the National Party. Paranoia and<br />
parochialism is to the National Party what grass is to<br />
sheep and goats.<br />
But the party which has Most failed Australia on the Mabo<br />
debate is the Liberal Party. Confronted with a great<br />
national issue which needed, above all others in recent<br />
times, a great deal of good will and good feeling and a<br />
concerted search for consensus, the Liberal Party chose<br />
to foster ill-will and ill-feeling. They chose the role<br />
of spoiler.<br />
And the chief spoiler has been Dr Heweon. Not only has<br />
he refused to distance himself or ta-ke'issue with<br />
outrageous comments from people like Tim Fischer and Hugh<br />
Moqrgan, he has actually joined the little company who<br />
claim that people's homes are at risk. Dr Hewson knows<br />
that they are not.<br />
Last month we saw him on national television talking<br />
about what he called " massive uncertainty" " are titles<br />
secure, is your home secure, your mine secure, your farm<br />
secure?", he asked.<br />
Dr Hewson knows the answer to these questions is<br />
unequivocally " Yes".<br />
Mabo calls for something much better than this. It calls<br />
for nothing more or less than a mature national response. </p>

The High Court judgement entailed recognition that the<br />
fiction of terra nullius was indeed a fiction; that<br />
native title, where it had not been extinguished,<br />
continued to exist; and that the appalling treatment of<br />
Aboriginal Australians did in fact occur.<br />
It is hardly revelatory. In essence it recognises what we<br />
have long known to be true.<br />
The Mabo judgement places great responsibilities upon us,<br />
but it seems to me these responsibilities create the<br />
opportunity to set right some aspect. of Australian life<br />
which have long been wrong. it offers a chance to raise<br />
the level of dignity on both sides.<br />
And these responsibilities are no greater than the<br />
responsibilities which the United States, New Zealand and<br />
Canada all confronted last century. These countries<br />
faced up to their responsibilities while they were still<br />
in their infancy.<br />
I am one of those who believes that in our maturity we<br />
too can meet our responsibilities that we can make a<br />
mature national judgement.<br />
It must be a national response: the entire continent was<br />
declared terra nullius; native title was denied<br />
everywhere; the abuses occurred in all the states.<br />
The need to find solutions is a national need. If the<br />
word " Australia" still means, as I believe it does, a<br />
belief in democracy and social justice, if that remains<br />
the national sentiment, then a just national solution<br />
must be found.<br />
From the first Cabinet discussion a year ago, the<br />
Government has seen as the nub of the matter finding a<br />
rational reconciliation of two imperatives: the certainty<br />
about land tenure which a resource-based economy requires<br />
and the discharge of our deep obligations to Aboriginal<br />
and Torres Strait Islander people whose legal rights have<br />
been granted them by the highest court in the land.<br />
We have been determined that it must be a reconciliation<br />
managed by Governments rather than left to the fate of<br />
protracted conflict and unpredictable litigation.*<br />
We have moved as quickly as possible. Mabo amounts to<br />
the biggest change in Australian land law since we became<br />
a nation. That is why I announced last October that we<br />
would be taking a year to consult on the issues, consider<br />
them carefully and formulate our policy.<br />
I remind you that during the election campaign the Leader<br />
of the Opposition supported the process and the<br />
timetable. </p>
<p>23/ 07 ' 9 18: 04 WS I_ M72 93P PRESS OFFICE<br />
I will not attend now to any of the shrill and irrational<br />
charges that have been made in the course of the debate.<br />
As for the charge that the States have been browbeaten, I<br />
won't go back over the twists and turns of discussion and<br />
drafting that went on at the COAG meeting in June.<br />
But if it is browbeating the State. to ask them to accept<br />
one of the most important-and positive decisions the High<br />
Court has ever taken if it is browbeating the States to<br />
ask them to do more than simply pocket a Commonwealth<br />
offer to validate their grants and pick up the entire<br />
compensation bill if it is browbeating the States to<br />
ask that effective mechanisms be established to determine<br />
native title claims, and that laws be updated to<br />
recognise and protect native title and if it is<br />
browbeating the States to get them to understand that<br />
Mabo has a significance well beyond the nitty gritty of<br />
land management then the States have been browbeaten.<br />
And the Government will not waver from its view of Mabo<br />
as a national issue requiring a national response.<br />
At our initiative, consultations have been held with the<br />
States since last year, in every State capital and in<br />
multilateral meetings the work has continued since COAG.<br />
I reiterate what I have said to the Premiers and Chief<br />
Ministers: in dealing with the land management<br />
challenges posed by tMabo, our preferred course is<br />
complementary legislation, cooperatively achieved.<br />
That does not mean we will accept the lowest common<br />
denominator, or will fail to establish appropriate<br />
national standards and mechanisms for dealing with native<br />
title. If Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people have one<br />
overriding request of the Government it is that the<br />
Commonwealth set the benchmarks. And this we will do.<br />
As we work on legislation, we are going to keep the lines<br />
of communication open to Aboriginal and Torres Strait<br />
Islander representatives, to representatives of industry<br />
and to others. The political heat of the issue will not<br />
deflect us from that sound, deliberative, consultative<br />
course on which we embarked last October.<br />
The legislation we will introduce in the. Budget sittings<br />
will make Mabo work. It will demonstrate that native<br />
title is not incompatible with efficient land management<br />
or with the national economic interest.<br />
Dr Hewson made another contribution to the Mabo debate<br />
yesterday. He said that Mabo threatened to lead to<br />
recession. </p>
<p>23/ 07 9i3 006 917 PM PRESS OFF 005<br />
9<br />
Dr Hewuon appears unable to live without recessions.<br />
When he doesn't have one, he conjures one up. Late last<br />
year, you will remember, he said that the recession was<br />
deepening. Double dipping. Then he said that we were on<br />
the verge of a depression.<br />
Dr Hewson has also been talking about how the Government<br />
must not " go beyond" Mabo, as if it is possible to<br />
deliver a complete response without paying regard to the<br />
wider implications of the judgement.<br />
Let me say that it is not " going beyond" Mabo:<br />
to see how the decision, by sweeping aside the<br />
doctrine of terra nullius, also sweeps aside the<br />
foundation of the dispossession of the indigenous<br />
Australians or to note that the decision itself talks of<br />
Aboriginal dispossession as having underwritten the<br />
development of Australia<br />
or to consider then what might be done for those who<br />
have been dispossessed<br />
or to consider also how the apprehensions of landbased<br />
industries and the hopes of Aboriginal people<br />
for economic improvement might both be addressed by<br />
giving the latter a greater sense of involvement in<br />
industry<br />
or to recognise, as the High Court has now done,<br />
Aboriginal customary law and traditions as a source<br />
of Australian common law<br />
or to recognise why, therefore, the Mabo decision<br />
can be seen as a major contribution to the social,<br />
cultural and economic standing of Aboriginal and<br />
Torres Strait Islander people with the potential to<br />
establish a new basis for the relationship between<br />
indigenous and other Australians<br />
None of these aims exceed our capacities as a community<br />
and a nation: none of them exceeds our democratic or<br />
social aspiration. They are, I believe, consistent with<br />
our values and beliefs.<br />
The spoilers, no less than the bigots, should know that.<br />
And they should know that no amount of sophistry, or<br />
denial, or lies will deliver us from the truth. None of<br />
it will help Australia escape judgement in the eyes of<br />
the world. And none of it is needed.<br />
What we do need and what we will have is a workable<br />
solution that will actually improve the quality of our<br />
national life, which will build up the values we hold in<br />
common, and nourish the reconciliation process. </p>
<p>-j/ 07 ' 93* 16: 08 006 273 2923 PM PRESS OFIC -a 006<br />
And there is no doubt that we would be considerably<br />
closer to this solution if the Liberal Party had not<br />
decided that it was in their interest to subvert the<br />
national interest.<br />
But, in fact, as Judith Brett wrote the other day, the<br />
Liberal Party is " philosophically bankrupt". They no<br />
longer have any idea how to address those things which<br />
their founder understood instinctively the need for<br />
unity, the importance of social values, the essential<br />
role of a responsible political party to find the means<br />
by which a society can cohere around common principles<br />
and aspirations.<br />
The Liberal Party, the alternative government, has<br />
comprehensively lost its way. This is a fact which in<br />
some circumstances might give the Labor Party comfort,<br />
but there is no comfort for any Australian in their<br />
present behaviour.<br />
And there is little prospect of their improving. Having<br />
just lost an election, they number among their leadership<br />
aspirants the man who contributed more than any other to<br />
the loss.<br />
And having lost it on a Thatcherite program, they allow<br />
to be a contender a politician who, in an embarrassingly<br />
transparent imitation of Mrs Thatcher before she<br />
mellowed, said the other day that government should be<br />
" Poor", and " the laws of the free market are as immutable<br />
as the laws of gravity".<br />
Among their youth two of their brighter sparks are avowed<br />
monarchists. The former Hewson adviser, now Hewsonhater,<br />
Abbott; and the Melbourne lawyer, Costello.<br />
Abbott and Costello lead the youthful wing of the Liberal<br />
Party, along with the likes of the Member for Menzies<br />
who, to judge from an article in The Aae the other day,<br />
makes the man after whom his seat is named look like an<br />
Irish rebel.<br />
But no one is more culpable in the present fiasco which<br />
is the Liberal Party than the bloke who only six months<br />
ago was still believed to be their hope for the future.<br />
In what appears to be a sort of penance for his sins, he<br />
now tramps around the country saying things he doesn't<br />
believe or he knows to be untrue.<br />
It is well known, for instance, that privately John<br />
Hewson will tell you Australia must move on to be a<br />
republic. But unlike the Greiners and the Faheys and Sir<br />
Rupert Hamer and many other leading Liberals, he will not<br />
say so. He will not lead. He does not have the courage<br />
of his convictions. </p>

Le will not cater to Paul<br />
The nation's ambitions apparently no longer enter into Dr<br />
Hewson's political equation.<br />
Nothing will persuade Dr Hewson that economics cannot be<br />
divorced from social policy, that our economic<br />
performance depends in considerable part on the strength<br />
of our social bonds and on the development of a uniting<br />
spirit. That our success in Asia will depend on these things as<br />
well. I think it is safe to say that Australian business<br />
understands what the political Opposition fails to.<br />
Business knows that in the end it will not be the<br />
Australian Government which carries the day in the Asia-<br />
Pacific. It will be business.<br />
It will not be Government which ultimately carries the<br />
day in Australia. It will be business. Business, unions,<br />
the workforce: public and private institutions, schools<br />
and universities, communities, individuals.<br />
In the end it will be, as I said, the quality of our<br />
national effort which determines our success.<br />
That is what increasingly impresses me in Asia the<br />
number of Australian initiatives which are succeeding.<br />
it is what increasingly impresses me here. It's what<br />
impressed McKinsey in the survey of 700 new exporters.<br />
We will help business up wherever we can. We won't be<br />
shutting down the economy as some people are saying we<br />
should. We'll do what we can to sustain demand.<br />
But once it gets going we'll get out of the way.<br />
Right now it is particularly important that governments<br />
get the broad parameters of economic policy right.<br />
To generate investment and jobs Commonwealth and State<br />
Governments must get their budgets right: they must<br />
support the economy in the short run by providing a<br />
stimulus to spending; but they have to able to show that<br />
in the medium term deficits will be scaled back to allow<br />
private saving to be used to fund business investment.<br />
We cannot allow our private savings to be used solely to<br />
fund big budget deficits. </p>
<p>23/ 07 ' 93 18: 09 -BOO 273 2923PMPESOIT 0O<br />

We have to have more business investment and we have to<br />
free up our private savings to pay for it.<br />
This is what we did in the 1980. when we built up those<br />
big budget surpluses. I<br />
More recently, the Treasurer, the National Fiscal Outlook<br />
and the Fitzgerald Report have reinforced this simple<br />
point. In the medium term, big budget deficits are not<br />
consistent with a strong economy.<br />
That is why the Government is committed to reducing the<br />
budget deficit to 1 per cent of GDP by 1996-97; and why<br />
we are aiming for a budget deficit of around $ 16 billion<br />
this year.<br />
The economy has been recovering for seven consecutive<br />
quarters but, while the medium term looks good, the<br />
process has been stubbornly slow.<br />
We can be thankful that with more and more of our trade<br />
in the Asia-Pacific we are not so dependent on the OECD<br />
economies to sustain our export growth.<br />
But sluggish growth in the OECD area has inevitably made<br />
it difficult for us in Australia.<br />
There are some forecasters suggesting that the GDP growth<br />
in 1993-94 might be little different from 92-93.<br />
Private consumption conceivably could weaken.<br />
The economy could therefore do with the stimulus this<br />
financial year that the One Nation tax cuts are scheduled<br />
to bring next year.<br />
on the other hand, because inflation is much lower, the<br />
One Nation tax cuts are now more generous than they were<br />
intended to be when they were announced in February 1992.<br />
It is for these two reasons that the Government is<br />
considering how the One Nation tax cuts can be best put<br />
into place best for the economy and best for taxpayers.<br />
The tax cuts now legislated are to be paid in two parts<br />
one in July 1994 and the second in January 1996.<br />
we are now in the process of considering the extent to<br />
which the first leg can be brought forward to boost the<br />
economy, and the second put back to secure the savings<br />
task in the interim. </p>

As I said earlier, when the tax cuts were announced in<br />
February 1992, they were intended to encompass fiscal<br />
drag. The subsequent better performance on inflation now<br />
implies that they are substantially more than fiscal drag<br />
substantially more than was intended.<br />
Delaying the introduction of the second leg will bring<br />
the tax cuts backs into line with what was intended and<br />
announced in February 1992 while still seeing the tax<br />
cuts paid.<br />
In this way the incidence of income tax will not rise,<br />
savings will be boosted, and the economy will receive a<br />
fillip at a time when it's still needed.<br />
These tax cuts will be delivered in full this financial<br />
year. They will be L A W law.<br />
And what is more, they are R E S P 0 N S I B L E<br />
responsible law.<br />
I began by talking about Australia's national values; or,<br />
if you like, this system of belief which unites us.<br />
I have said before that this a country which has got its<br />
basic values right.<br />
Those values remain, by and large, democratic,<br />
egalitarian, tolerant and far more than before open.<br />
But I do think we need to be more generally aware of<br />
them, and they should be reflected more obviously in our<br />
national symbols and institutions.<br />
I think as Australia changes and old affections<br />
inevitably fade it is essential that we get these things<br />
right for future generations.<br />
It seems to me that there is no better recent evidence of<br />
the need for this than the Mabo debate particularly<br />
where it has been led by our conservative opponents.<br />
In the end, however, I am supremely confident that the<br />
better instincts of the vast majority of Australians will<br />
prevail. I recognise, just the same, that none of this can be<br />
divorced from our economic performance our ability to<br />
provide long term security and prosperity.<br />
That, despite the slow recovery, is now on offer as never<br />
before. It is what the government, and a great many<br />
Australians, have been seeking for some time.<br />
There are profound reasons to believe we will succeed<br />
and in the end nothing will be more important than belief<br />
itself. </p>
