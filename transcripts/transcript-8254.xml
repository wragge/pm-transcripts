SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
ROAD TRANSPORT INDUSTRY FORUM<br />
MELBOURNE 19 FEBRUARY 1991<br />
Bruce Mclver, Chairman<br />
Last year, I addressed the Road Transport Industry Forum at<br />
the Sydney Opera House on the opening day of the campaign<br />
for my Government's fourth term. You probably recall a<br />
small incident concerning the placement of microphones on<br />
the lectern but nevertheless we went on to win the<br />
election campaign.<br />
It is a pleasure to return to this Forum, and to these<br />
microphones, with a renewed mandate, and with a continued<br />
determination, to tackle the challenge of land transport<br />
reform. On that occasion at the Opera House, I spoke about the<br />
importance of land transport, of improved regulation of road<br />
safety and of road funding. In the last twelve months we<br />
have moved a. significant distance in these areas, and we<br />
will see even greater change before this term of Government<br />
is out.<br />
This will net be reform just for the sake of it.<br />
We have not embarked on improvements to land transport in<br />
Australia because it is easy. It is not.<br />
We do not seek reform because it will be cheap. It will not<br />
be. And we have not taken an interest in this area in order to<br />
court popularity. As we have seen repeatedly, it is all too<br />
simple for critics of land transport reform to get cheap<br />
popularity by claiming that it threatens the life-blood of<br />
remote communities, or that it is a cover for milking the<br />
industry for more revenue. </p>
<p>Such criticisms are of course totally inaccurate. They fail<br />
to recognise that the industry, though highly competitive,<br />
is held back by inappropriate and inconsistent State<br />
regulation, and by a lack of balance between the three<br />
variables of diesel excise, road damage, and road<br />
expenditure. Substantial variations in charges between<br />
States create distortions so severe that in some cases heavy<br />
vehicles which principally use roads in New South Wales can<br />
escape most of the cost recovery mechanisms by registering<br />
in, say, South Australia and buying fuel in Queensland.<br />
The nation cannot afford a system of regulation that allows<br />
that kind of distortion, and that is the reason my<br />
Government is keen to remove impediments to the industry's<br />
efficiency. The Industry Commission's analysis of road transport is the<br />
most thoroughly researched study of this issue available.<br />
It suggests that the value to the Australian economy of<br />
reform of road transport alone is worth $ 1.2 billion a year.<br />
And rail reform because of its relative inefficiency may<br />
be worth a further $ 4 billion.<br />
To put that in context, coastal shipping reform about<br />
which we hear so much, and where many changes are also<br />
taking place may generate an extra $ 500 million a year a<br />
small sum by comparison. Even tariff cuts and the<br />
elimination of bounty payments are not worth as much to the<br />
economy as the creation of a fully competitive, commercial<br />
and properly regulated land transport system. It is in this<br />
sense the most important industry reform yet it receives<br />
the least attention from many who claim to be interested in<br />
structural change.<br />
In the early years of this Government, the principal focus<br />
of land transport reform was on road funding in order to<br />
direct more funding to roads of economic significance and<br />
on providing a simple means of allowing interstate vehicles<br />
some consistency in road regulation under the Federal<br />
InterState Registration Scheme.<br />
That was an appropriate focus for the time. However,<br />
following the! Special Premiers' Conference last year, new<br />
and tougher areas for reform are now under scrutiny. They<br />
are: first, the competitive relationship between road and<br />
rail, including the abysmal return on billions of<br />
dollars of taxpayers' funds tied up in out-dated,<br />
poorly-utilised and unrealistically-priced rail freight<br />
operations; second, the need for consistency in regulation between<br />
States; </p>
<p>third, the need f or a clear relationship one accepted<br />
by Government and industry between cost recovery and<br />
expenditure on roads, and effective delivery of road<br />
programs; and fourth, the need to ensure that capacity for road<br />
damage -is assessed in setting cost recovery levels for<br />
different types of vehicles.<br />
Negotiations with the States, which control much of this<br />
area, are on. Ly part complete. But let me tell you what I<br />
can of the pr~ ogress being made on these issues.<br />
First, the road-rail interface.<br />
Many of you will be legitimately concerned to know what the<br />
Commonwealth is doing in the rail area, as it has the<br />
capacity to affect your business.<br />
Let me take iLt from first principles. You believe your<br />
industry is highly competitive. We agree. You believe the<br />
rail system is subsidised, inefficient and sets prices<br />
without reference to commercial standards. That is, it does<br />
not have to face commercial realities. We agree.<br />
And we would add that rail has also been at a singular<br />
disadvantage because its freight operations have been the<br />
? poor cousin' to passenger operations; because it has been<br />
even more heavily-constrained in cross-border operations by<br />
different State regulations than your industry; and because<br />
of an absence of new investment over decades.<br />
Our commitment to rail freight is to remove these<br />
constraints. The States cannot do so on their own. And the<br />
nation cannot: afford so poor a return from its rail network.<br />
We intend to set up the National Rail Freight Corporation to<br />
take over as much of the inter-State rail freight task as<br />
possible. Intra-State services will remain with the States,<br />
although they may seek to contract them to the Corporation.<br />
The Corporation will charge commercial rates. It will have<br />
a commercially-developed capital base. It will have a new<br />
award structure and work practices essential to its<br />
commercial focus. It will be expected to pay its own way<br />
without subsidies.<br />
If these requirements cannot be met, there is no incentive<br />
for the Commonwealth to invest in rail freight. The future<br />
for State rail services, particularly other than commuter<br />
rail operations and some bulk tasks, must then seem very<br />
bleak. I do not expect that all of you will welcome with open arms<br />
the revitalisation of rail freight. However, two important<br />
factors suggest that you should not fear it: </p>
<p>first, combined road-rail services can offer a very<br />
effective method of freight forwarding, so the benefits<br />
of improved rail efficiency will be obvious and<br />
valuable to your industry;<br />
and second, this will not be subsidised competition.<br />
Your industry will be able to compete on its merits.<br />
Turning to the need for consistent road regulation,<br />
Commonwealth and State officials have reached broad<br />
agreement on a single national heavy vehicle registration<br />
scheme to cover all vehicles 4.5 tonnes or more fully laden.<br />
This would in~ volve an integrated set of State registries,<br />
offering rapi~ d information exchange.<br />
We have also broadly agreed to introduce uniform regulation<br />
in other areas including weight limits, driver licensing,<br />
loading codes, enforcement and road-worthiness.<br />
About time tcoo, you might say. I agree. And I am confident<br />
that the Premiers do too.<br />
The third and fourth areas of reform which I mentioned<br />
relate to the inter-related questions of cost recovery,<br />
roads expenditure and road damage.<br />
There will be much less heat and much more light generated<br />
in this area if we can get to a better-understood linkage<br />
between what you pay in cost recovery charges and what we<br />
and the States spend on roads. That may be optimistic, but<br />
it is our objective.<br />
Since coming to Office, my Government has allocated more<br />
than $ 10 billion to road funding Australia-wide. In 1990-91<br />
we will provide $ 1.6 billion for roads and other land<br />
transport projects an increase of 13 percent in real terms<br />
on last year.<br />
But the present system of responsibilities for roads<br />
expenditure is a mish-mash, despite all efforts to refine<br />
the system which has been in place for decades.<br />
When it comes to roads, some seem to be more preoccupied<br />
with passing -the buck rather than spending it.<br />
The effective way out of this is for the Commonwealth to<br />
designate a specific set of roads which are its<br />
responsibility to construct and maintain, and for the States<br />
and local government to do likewise. In the case of the<br />
Commonwealth, something like an expanded National Highways<br />
System is one concept. What that will mean in practice,<br />
however, is yet to be determined. Again, much depends on<br />
our colleagues in the States. </p>
<p>We are also discussing with the States major changes to<br />
their cost recovery practices and to ours. There is perhaps<br />
a greater degree of acceptance, following the early rounds<br />
of discussion, on the principles established by the<br />
InterState Commission.<br />
That said, I do not believe we will end up with a system<br />
which equates completely to that proposed by the ISC.<br />
There are many reasons for this. Governments need to<br />
implement systems which are practical and which recognise<br />
the interests of the industries in which they operate.<br />
There is also frequently a need to phase in reforms,<br />
particularly where the nature of change is very broad, as is<br />
the case here.<br />
While charges could rise for some perhaps, relatively, a<br />
few vehicles, there is at least the possibility that<br />
charges will fall for many others. This is an aspect of the<br />
ISC's report which has not been given much attention, and<br />
yet which has not been ruled out either.<br />
Much will depend on the co-operation of the States and the<br />
understanding of the industry.<br />
I can give you a guarantee that this is not a grab for new<br />
revenue. I can also guarantee further consultation with your industry<br />
representatives before we finalise our position.<br />
In return, I hope that you will continue to contribute to<br />
the reform process and help us, after the May Premiers'<br />
Conference, implement a better system for road transport in<br />
Australia. The rewards for our nation will be enormous. </p>
