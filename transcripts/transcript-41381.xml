    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Australian and Western Australian Governments have reached agreement to bring Western Australia into the National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS).</p>
<p>The agreement replaces the agreement signed in January 2017 by the previous Western Australian Government for a WA administered NDIS.</p>
<p>Western Australians with a disability, as well as their families and carers, now have certainty on the future of the NDIS.</p>
<p>Joining the nationally-delivered NDIS means people with a disability in Western Australia, and right across the country, will have the support they need through a nationally consistent and nationally delivered NDIS.</p>
<p>Todayâ€™s announcement reflects the shared commitment by Australian Governments to the NDIS and is the final step towards making the NDIS a truly national scheme.</p>
<p>From 1 July 2018, the National Disability Insurance Agency will assume responsibility for the delivery of the NDIS in WA.</p>
<p>The NDIS will continue to roll out on a geographic basis and will be fully rolled out across Western Australia by 2020.</p>
<p>People already taking part in the WA NDIS will transfer to the nationally delivered scheme in a phased approach from April 2018 and conclude by December 2018.</p>
<p>The Australian and Western Australian governments will work closely with the National Disability Insurance Agency to implement the transition.</p>
<p>The Turnbull Government is committed to fully funding the NDIS through raising the Medicare levy by 0.5 per cent. We encourage our colleagues in the Senate to support a modest increase to the Medicare Levy to give all Australians with a disability and their families the certainty they deserve.</p>
