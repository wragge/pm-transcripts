STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
GENETICALLY ENGINEERED EUCALYPTS<br />
I am pleased today to congratulate the CSIRO on the<br />
development of a genetically engineeredi~ hucailyptus tree.<br />
CSIRO scientists successfully transferred a gene from a<br />
bacterium into cells from red gum. Each " 1transgenic" cell<br />
has already re-generated into a young river red gum,<br />
growing in sterile conditions in a laboratory.<br />
Genes have been transferred successfully into other plant<br />
species, but this is the first scientifically confirmed<br />
genetic transfer into the river red gum.<br />
The harmless bacterial gene transferred into the gum tree<br />
by the CSIRO's Divisions of Forestry and Plant Industry<br />
is simply a " marker" to show that the technology works.<br />
Next, the scientists plan to repeat these experiements<br />
using two temperate eucalypts ( Eucalyptus nitens and<br />
globulus) both of which are important commercial<br />
plantation trees in Australia.<br />
As an environmental safety measure, the next step is to<br />
genetically engineer sterile plantation trees. Once this<br />
has been achieved, there will be no risk that unwanted<br />
genes might spread into native forests. The CSIRO's " gene<br />
shears" technology, which switches of f unwanted genes,<br />
will be used as part of the sterility program.<br />
The development of transformation systems and sterility<br />
would then allow for changes in important economic<br />
properties, such as pest resistance and high density<br />
wood. The genetically engineered trees will not be able to<br />
breed, so they will have -YEo-propagated by laboratory<br />
cloning. Scientists will be able to choose the best<br />
plantation specimens and produce large numbers of these<br />
elite trees.<br />
The transformed trees are growing under secure laboratory<br />
conditions, and it will be some time before plants are<br />
available or officially approved for field testing.<br />

<p>I am also pleased today to declare open new laboratories<br />
for the CSIRO's Division of Forestry, and to launch the<br />
Co-operative Research Centre for Temperate Hardwood<br />
F-6rstry in Hobart.<br />
The new research centre, one of 50 such centres<br />
throughout Australia, brings together scientists from<br />
several institutions and from the forestry industry to<br />
tackle common research problems.<br />
