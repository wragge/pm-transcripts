PRIME MINISTER 42/ 95<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON PJ KEATING MP<br />
ROBERT HENRY JOHNSTON AO, CHAIRMAN OF AUSTRADE<br />
I was deeply saddened to learn of the death of the Chairman of Austrade, Mr<br />
Robert Johnston a true captain of Australian industry.<br />
It was typical of Bob Johnston's commitment to Australia and to excellence<br />
that after a lifetime building our motor industry he devoted his retirement to<br />
strengthening Australia's export push as Chairman of Austrade.<br />
His dedication to guiding Australian industry and promoting exports was<br />
unparalleled. I last saw Bob Johnston at the CeBIT technology fair in Hanover. It was a<br />
measure of his dedication that despite illness he worked tirelessly to ensure<br />
the exhibition was a success.<br />
The opening of the new Toyota production plant in Melbourne last month was<br />
a testimony to his faith in Australia a legacy of his period as Chief Executive<br />
Officer of Toyota Australia. The plant sets a new benchmark for the<br />
Australian motor vehicle industry.<br />
I wish to extend my personal and the Government's condolences to his<br />
family. I also wish to offer the thanks of the Australian people for a life which helped<br />
make Australia a more modern and productive place.<br />
CANBERRA 8 May 1995 </p>
