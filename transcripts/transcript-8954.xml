PRIME MINISTER<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P. J. KEATING, MP<br />
MABO LEGISLATION<br />
Today marks an important point in the Government's resolution of the Mabo issue.<br />
The Government is releasing a detailed outline of its proposed legislation. The<br />
legislation will resolve the uncertainties created by Mabo, while ensuring that native<br />
title is treated with fairness and justice.<br />
Our proposals are also today being sent to State and Terrtory Governments,<br />
Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander representatives and relevant industry bodies. We<br />
wish to proceed expeditiously, but also wish to provide a reasonable opportunity for<br />
consideration of our proposals. Final decisions will then be taken by the Government,<br />
a Bill prepared and the legislation introduced into Parliament in October.<br />
The legislation will necessarily be complex. The issues are complicated ones.<br />
But running through the complexity and the detail are certain clearly drawn lines of<br />
policy and principle:<br />
1) ungrudging and unambiguous recognition of native title in Australian law;<br />
2) a fair, rigorous and efficient means for determining who has native title, where, and<br />
what the key attributes of that title are in particular cases;<br />
3) a just and workable regime under which dealings in land can go on, and which<br />
provides clear processes within which our vital land based industries can operate;<br />
4) the right of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people to be asked about<br />
proposed actions affecting native title land, but without any special veto or<br />
" locking-up" of the land;<br />
full security for people holding grants of interests in land provided by governments<br />
in the past, and at no cost to them;<br />
6) fair compensation for any extinguishment or impairment of native title rights; and </p>
<p>7) an opportunity for the States and Terrtories to manage dealings in land which<br />
affect native title so long as they meet the standards for recognition and protection<br />
of it set out in the Commonwealth legislation.<br />
These are the solid, principled foundations of our policy. They respond to the calls by<br />
industry for certainty and for clear rules under which land dealings can proceed. They<br />
respond to the equally legitimate demands by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander<br />
people for the rights accorded by the High Court decision to be respected in Australian<br />
land management. They respond to the calls by the States and Territories for<br />
recognition of their key role in dealings in land under our Federal system.<br />
And they respond, I am sure, to the wish of the wider Australian community namely<br />
that Mabo be accepted, but also that it be made to work.<br />
Ours is no jerry-built proposal designed to provide a quick fix for this or that<br />
particular sectional interest. We are building something to last, because the<br />
implications of the High Court's decision will now be with Australia forever. It is<br />
fatuous, unjust and impractical to the point of irresponsibility to suggest that the<br />
decision might somehow be ignored or overturned. And any policy which sees only<br />
one side of the equation is destined for failure.<br />
From the outset the Government has had twin aims:<br />
justice for Aboriginal and Tortes Strait Islander people in relation to legal rights<br />
granted by the highest Court in the land; and<br />
the integrity of our land management system as one of the foundations of our<br />
economy.<br />
The alternative to simultaneous achievement of these two goals is conflict, antagonism<br />
and endless litigation. We need a coherent, balanced approach which achieves a<br />
reconciliation of the two goals, a reconciliation managed by Government rather than<br />
left to fate in the courts. Our proposed legislation alone among any so far proposed<br />
in Australia -will do this.<br />
Let me now highlight the main provisions.<br />
First, the Bill -will remove any doubt which the existence of native title creates about<br />
the validity of existing grants of interest in land. Nobody holding any, land tenure need<br />
have any fear on this score once our Bill is passed.<br />
Second, the Bill will not leave up in the air what impl icat ions this validation of past<br />
grants has for existing native title. It will make clear that for freehold, and for<br />
residential, pastoral and tourist leasehold grants, the validation extinguishes any native<br />
title rights inconsistent with those grants. For mining leases, and lesser interests over<br />
land such as licences and permits, the validation will not extinguish the native title.<br />
But the Bill will confirm that any native title is subject to the lease or licence for as<br />
long as it runs. I emphasise that this is totally consistent % rtexsing practice in<br />
relation to mining leases over other private interests in land. </p>
<p>3<br />
Third, the approach to validation will preserve native title to the maximum extent<br />
possible. Those who would like to see wholesale extinguishment should be required to<br />
answer this question: How can it be just to end an Aboriginal legal right which has, by<br />
definition, been preserved for hundreds and perhaps thousands of years in order to<br />
validate an invalid grant when there is no need to do so to achieve that objective?<br />
Thus: * the Bill will permit the reassertion of native title rights at the conclusion of a<br />
mining lease or lesser grant; and<br />
* it will protect any legal rights of native title holders which can co-exist with the<br />
rights under the grant.<br />
Fourth, in validating past grants, the rights which people may have to renewals or<br />
extensions in the future will also be protected.<br />
Fifth, having cleared up the problems of the past, the Bill goes on to provide a<br />
comprehensive framework for future land management by the Commonwealth, State<br />
and Territory Governments. This will allow dealings in land to go on efficiently, but<br />
with native title being properly taken into account. The Bill recognises three basic<br />
ways in which future dealings affecting native title land can proceed:<br />
it makes provision for conversion of native title to statutory title, should Aboriginal<br />
or Torres Strait Islander people wish. In this way they have the flexibility to deal<br />
with the land, for example leasing it for tourist development or selling part for a<br />
mining project;<br />
it makes provision for acquisition of the land by a government ( for example for<br />
some essential public purpose) and for the extinguishment of native title in this<br />
case. The native title holder would be afforded the same protections of fair process<br />
which apply to anybody else; and<br />
the Bill will provide fair and workable processes of notification, negotiation,<br />
arbitration and determination where a government proposes to make a grant of<br />
interest over the land. The native title will be subject to the grant for the period of<br />
the grant, not extinguished by it forever.<br />
Sixth, the Bill recognises that some grants ( for example a major mining lease) will<br />
have greater impact on native title holders and their land than other grants ( for example<br />
most exploration licences). We are therefore providing an expedited process for<br />
decisions about grants of the latter kind, a process which still however affords rights to<br />
Aboriginal people to be asked and to have their say.<br />
Seventh, the Bill provides processes for managing dealings in land in the inevitable<br />
interim period before we know whether native title actually exists in a particular area.<br />
There must be no hiatus. Land dealings cannot come to a halt. The key here is<br />
appropriate notification of, and consultation with, bone fide claimants and relevant<br />
Aboriginal organisations. </p>
<p>Eighth, the Bill gives Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people a right to<br />
compensation on just terms where native title is extinguished or impaired whether in<br />
relation to validation of past grants or the issue of future ones.<br />
Ninth, the Bill will establish a National Native Title Tribunal, comprising:<br />
Judges of the Federal Court who will hear native title claims and determine the<br />
existence, boundaries and attributes of native title over particular land;<br />
the Tribunal Registrar, who will registcr claims and decisions about native title,<br />
and will need to be satisfied that a claim meets certain standards before it is<br />
registered; Tribunal Assessors, who will mediate claims; and<br />
Tribunal Members who will assist negotiations between native title holders,<br />
governments and people seeking grants, and make decisions if negotiations fail to<br />
produce an agreement.<br />
Tenth, the Bill will permit the Commonwealth to accept State and Territory bodies in<br />
place of the Commonwealth Tribunal and State and Territory processes for the<br />
handling of grants of interest in land if they meet the criteria set out. There can be no<br />
legitimate complaint that we are putting the States in a strait jacket they have the<br />
option to come up with one of its own which equally well satisfies the objectives.<br />
Finally, the Bill will make certain provisions in the interests of the community as a<br />
whole: that laws and regulations of general application apply equally to native title land;<br />
that governments are able to confirm existing Crown ownership of resources; and<br />
that existing public rights of access to such places such as beaches, waterways,<br />
recreation areas and so on can be confirmed.<br />
With this proposed Bill the national government is accepting its national<br />
responsibilities. The Commonwealth has profound obligations to Aboriginal and<br />
Torres Strait Islander people, to the protection of their rights under the law and to the<br />
betterment of their economic and social condition. We also have profound obligations<br />
to all Australians for the security of their rights in land, and for the wellbeing of the<br />
national economy.<br />
Others may feel they have the luxury of taking a narrower view, of pushing a particular<br />
interest or of following the instincts of short-term political expediency. We do not.<br />
As Australia's Government we cannot.<br />
Regarding the role of the States and Territories, I reiterate what I have put to them<br />
namely that the Commonwealth's preferred approach is complementary legislation,<br />
co-operatively achieved. Therefore, as well as inviting their comments on our </p>
<p>proposed legislation, I invite State and Territory leaders to join with us in a national<br />
approach. Our proposal<br />
permits the States to run their own land management, with the Commonwealth<br />
performing the role most appropriate to it; setting national standards and<br />
establishing an overall framework;<br />
provides legal certainty to the States that they are able to validate existing grants;<br />
provides clewr and fair " rules of the game" for dealings in land and to assist<br />
economic development; and<br />
can be underpinned by the Commonwealth's preparedness to accept an appropriate<br />
responsibility, with the States and Territories, in relation to funding.<br />
This legislation will not satisfy everybody's demands. It would not be good legislation<br />
if it tried to do so, and such an enterprise would be impossible. Rather, our proposal is<br />
the product of intensive consideration of each of the issues on their merits. In this way<br />
we have achieved an approach which has consistency and integrity.<br />
It is also the product of the extensive process of consultation on which the Government<br />
very deliberately embarked last year. We have not been deterred in that time by<br />
pressure, misinformation or hysteria from the pursuit of good, durable policy. We<br />
have stuck to the timetable announced at the outset. The outcome will be all the better<br />
for the time that has been taken to hear, understand and reflect upon the views that<br />
have been put.<br />
This proposed legislation gives Australia a way of settling the land management<br />
challenges posed by Mabo. But the Government remains committed to the view that<br />
the significance of Mabo does not begin and end there.<br />
The crux of the matter is that the High Court has formally recognised what should<br />
have been accepted long ago that Australia was not Terra Nullius, a land belonging<br />
to no-one when the Europeans arrived. There were prior owners. They were often<br />
dispossessed. To understand this deeper significance of Mabo is to recognise that it provides an<br />
opportunity and obligation an opportunity for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander<br />
dignity in our society and for genuine reconciliation; an obligation to press forward<br />
with initiatives directed towards greater justice and economic development for<br />
Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people.<br />
As a second stage in our response to Mabo, I expect to make announcements about<br />
these wider matters later in the year.<br />
