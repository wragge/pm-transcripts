AS DELIVERED 2<br />
Jj AUSTRAL IA<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA THURSDAY, 22 JULY 1982<br />
FARE; LL DINNER FOR SIR ZELMA2 N COWEN<br />
This is a small dinner Your Excellencies to say thank you<br />
very much for what you have done for Australia over the<br />
last four to five years. Your record Sir Zelman, is<br />
Australian ( inaudible). It is one in which we can all take<br />
pride. In academic areas you were twice Vice-Chancellor, as a lawyer<br />
your writings and your publications, your biography of Sir<br />
Isaac Isaacs, the numerous papers that you have published on the<br />
law and education and national affairs stand high by any<br />
standards. There was one work that you wrote entitled " The<br />
Trial of Lady Chatterly, the Trial of Oz". I am not quite<br />
sure what it was about and I don't intend to go into it on<br />
this occasion. Well His Excellency says that he will. I<br />
sit down and this floor and forum is yours for as long as<br />
you like.<br />
You have served Australia with great distinction in many<br />
areas, many offices and more particularly for the last four to<br />
five years as the Governor-General. Your past history and<br />
your own training has made it possible for you to take that<br />
office with a great knowledge of what is required, with a<br />
very keen understanding of the importance of the office to<br />
the central position of Australia's constitutional affairs.<br />
You have been the Queen's represcntative here and in many<br />
ways Sir Zelrnan you have followed her example. She has been<br />
through all history a unifying factor of British affairs in the<br />
Commonwealth. You have sought to be so in Australian affairs.<br />
I believe you have achieved that with very great distinction<br />
and with remarkable success.<br />
I thank you Sir very much for what you and Lady Cowen have<br />
achieved. You have been far above the debate which takes<br />
place in the: Federal Parliament, which seeks not to unify<br />
so often, buat to divide and whatever you have done has been<br />
to unify Australia as one nation. You have earned the respect<br />
of everyone throughout this country. You have earned the respect<br />
of all members of Parliament. In particular I believe you have<br />
earned the respect of all the people in this room tonight<br />
because whether it is in law, the courts, Parliament, the<br />
Public Service or in the military, you have in this room the<br />
people who a~ re the very core, of the fabric of Australian<br />
Government. </p>
<p>-2<br />
I don't know if the Earth opened up and everyone in this room<br />
fell into a great bottomless pit, there would be a few good<br />
jobs going. on the pay that you all get, I don't know that<br />
there would bie too many cases, but I certainly know that<br />
the Governmen. t of Australia would be much worse off if<br />
that happene6.. The fact that so many people who are vastly<br />
important to the Government or the Commonwealth are here tonight<br />
is a small example of the respect that all Australians hold<br />
for you and Lady Cowen.<br />
I was interested to know in your Press Club speech yesterday<br />
or the day before that you don't regard your officers as fat<br />
and I am delighted to know it because I never have. In many<br />
ways the constitution, the Office of the Governor-General is<br />
much more important than many Australians think or many<br />
Australians understand. That was not by some accident of<br />
history, it is not because of some powers that come from<br />
the monarch i~ n ancient times. It comes from the deliberate<br />
act of Australia's founding fathers, the kind of constitution<br />
that they wro~ te and the powers of that constitution gave to<br />
the Office of the Governor-General. That imposes many<br />
important obligations upon the office of the Governor-General,<br />
upon the person holding that office and Sir, you have fulfilled<br />
all those responsibilities with the very highest distinction.<br />
In many ways the Governor-General is the custodian of the rights,<br />
the basic rigjhts of all Australian people. As President<br />
of the Executive Council it is possible by what is said, but<br />
what is done by the manner of holdin~ g. that office, it is good<br />
for Ministers and it will have an af-fect on their thinking<br />
and there is nothing wrong with that and much good in it.<br />
The speeches you have made from one end of this country to<br />
the other you have exercised that intellectual influence on<br />
the Australian community. You have put many things into a<br />
national perSpective. You have had more public engagements<br />
over a period of 4 to 5 years than any of your predecessors.<br />
You very actively sought to take the office of the Governor-<br />
General and the personality of yourself and Lady Cowen out to<br />
every corner of Australia. I know that there are many tens<br />
of thousands of Australians who are very grateful to you for<br />
that. They have had a chance to meet with you, to talk with<br />
you, to hear what you have to say and they have appreciated<br />
it greatly indeed.<br />
You have travelled very, very widely, whether it is the Cocos<br />
Islands or the Christmas Islands or Norfolk Island or every<br />
part of Australia. I think one of your main achievements<br />
has been to bring Australians together. You I think in a<br />
very real sen2se undermined the parochialism, the ideological.<br />
rifts that so often appear whether it is in Parliament or<br />
somewhere else. You have emphasised the real interests<br />
Australians do hold in common. </p>
<p>3<br />
In your Australia Day Address in 1978 1 think you indicated<br />
that you regard the office and your part in the Office as a<br />
symbol of the unity of all the people of Australia. You have<br />
carried that through throughout the four or five years in a very<br />
remarkable way. an<br />
I think it is not/ uncommon thing to say that somebody who<br />
has done a job as well as you have, could not have been<br />
done so well had it not been for your better half. Lady Cowen<br />
has always been with you, she has alw.. ays supported you. She<br />
has always done much more than the people of Australia could<br />
have asked. She has had her own involvement in the welfare<br />
of many different groups throughout the Australian community,<br />
assisting people who are less fortunate than most of us.<br />
Lady Cowen I would like to thank you also very much for the<br />
way you have dlone your part of this Office.<br />
In one way Sir, and this is not an offence, you have been a<br />
very cheap price because we got two for one and I am not<br />
prepared to say ( inaudible)........ But you are both worth<br />
a very great deal and thank you very much.<br />
On Australia Day in 1982 in this year you indicated in your<br />
address that Australians should concentrate their minds<br />
proudly on what it is that keeps us all together. I believe<br />
Sir, that that is one of the most important tasks in front of<br />
all of us. It is so easy to be cut up into different groups,<br />
to different Parties, in different sectional or economic<br />
interests. But what you have epitomnised over the years is<br />
the fact that as Australians our real interests are interests<br />
in common and you have personified that in a very real way.<br />
You have got to remind us of it and I thank you for that.<br />
So you leave Australia in a few days time temporarily, I am<br />
sure you leave with enormous goodwill on the part of all<br />
of us. You go to look after the affairs of Oriel College<br />
Oxford and I am sure you will ease your mind and put your<br />
stamp on that college which is no stranger to you. As a result<br />
there will be many people who would never understand Australia<br />
and what we are all about. I hope to be here Sir on an occasion<br />
and able to offer you a dinner whenever it is you wish to return<br />
on an occasion such as this and welcome back the Governor-General<br />
that left us, but he came back and for whom we have a great<br />
affection and a very great regard.<br />
So, thank you very much for what you have done for this country.<br />
You have done a great deal in many different tasks, but what<br />
you have done as Governor-General both you and Lady Cowen is<br />
something tha~ t we will always remember. It will be written<br />
in the history books, it will be written that you heal, that<br />
you unified and you filled the office with very great<br />
distinction and I ask all of you to rise and drink a toast. </p>
