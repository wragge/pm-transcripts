<p>Well thank you very much Quang and to Nigel Milan the Managing Director</p>
<p> of SBS. I'm here today to do two things, to express the Government's</p>
<p> ongoing support for SBS. SBS was created by a Government of which</p>
<p> I was a member back in the 1970s and it's provided a marvellous</p>
<p> link amongst people of non English speaking background within the</p>
<p> Australian community.</p>
<p>It provides a very high quality service, it provides certain services</p>
<p> for English speaking as well as non English speaking Australians which</p>
<p> are denied or not available in quite the same magnitude, and I'm</p>
<p> thinking of particular sports, on other free to air channels. But</p>
<p> it has been a very successful Australian exercise in keeping communities</p>
<p> together and providing members of individual communities with important</p>
<p> cultural links and important associations with the heritage that they</p>
<p> treasure so much.</p>
<p>This wonderful outside broadcast van which is the second and more</p>
<p> proximate reason for my being here today, will enormously enhance</p>
<p> the capacity of SBS Radio to take its services and to take its facilities</p>
<p> to the people that it wants to reach and wants to service.</p>
<p>This van has a number of features unique to outside broadcast vans</p>
<p> in Australia. There will be two, primarily located, I think, in Melbourne</p>
<p> and Sydney but they will travel around the country and in that way</p>
<p> SBS Radio will be able to improve and to upgrade the quality of the</p>
<p> service which is available.</p>
<p>Can I say from my own personal experience that SBS does provide a</p>
<p> great service. A good example of it was that I was able to do an interview</p>
<p> on SBS Television before departing for the APEC Meeting and it was</p>
<p> an ideal forum with its particular interest in foreign affairs for</p>
<p> me to appear on and I've had many opportunities to appear on</p>
<p> both television and SBS Radio over the years.</p>
<p>I therefore have very great pleasure in launching the van, commending</p>
<p> SBS Radio and commend you Quang in particular on the leadership that</p>
<p> you've brought to that organisation and I wish it well and this</p>
<p> new van will add enormously to a very, very important part of the</p>
<p> Australian community and a service that is particularly valuable and</p>
<p> particularly appreciated by Australians who speak a language other</p>
<p> than English.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
