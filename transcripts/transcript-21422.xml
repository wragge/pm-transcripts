    <content><![CDATA[<p>I am pleased to announce that the first grant awarded under the Australian Government's $20 million National Community Crime Prevention Programme (NCCPP) is to the Hills Community Support Group in Western Australia.</p>
<p>The Group's innovative partnership project will receive $331,000 under the Community Partnerships Stream of the NCCPP.  Working with the Swan Chamber of Commerce, the Western Australian Police and the Midland Redevelopment Authority this programme will provide a variety of opportunities for young people in the Swan and Hills areas in Perth.</p>
<p>It will focus on early intervention, mentoring support, team building and "job ready" training opportunities with the overall aim of building positive skills and self-esteem in young people who have been, or are at risk of becoming involved in crime.</p>
<p>The Hills Community Support Group has already demonstrated its ability through innovative programmes and services for youth at risk, older people and those with disabilities, and is a fine example of an organisation which has developed great partnerships with the local community, business and government.</p>
<p>  The Australian Government has committed $20 million over four years to the NCCPP, which has as its key centrepiece a national community grants scheme to support community projects designed to prevent crime and improve community safety and security.</p>
<p>There has been an overwhelming community response to the establishment of NCCPP with over 180 applications received by 30 June 2004.</p>
<p>Further grants under the NCCPP will be announced shortly.  </p>
