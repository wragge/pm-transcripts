    <content><![CDATA[<p>Work on the new Mackay Stadium kicked off today with the commencement of preparatory earthworks at the site.</p>
<p>The Rudd Government is investing $8 million into this vital piece of community infrastructure which will support jobs today while delivering lasting benefits to the people of Mackay.</p>
<p>The Mackay Stadium construction is delivering on the Rudd Government's election commitment, and is expected to support over 100 jobs during construction as well as providing ongoing employment for Mackay residents.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Kevin Rudd toured the earthworks with local candidate Mike Brunker and Member for Dawson James Bidgood.</p>
<p>The community and council have worked long and hard for close to a decade for this new stadium, and the Rudd Government is pleased to be partnering with them in its delivery.</p>
<p>When construction is complete, this first-class stadium will be the proud new home of the Mackay Cutters and be used by the ten local Junior Rugby League teams.</p>
<p>In addition to being a regional hub for rugby league, the local schools, sporting clubs and organisations will be able to use the stadium for sports like soccer and touch football as well as specialty events.</p>
<p>The new Mackay Stadium will also be a first class multi-use stadium able to host regional and interstate sporting fixtures.</p>
<p>Tenders for the main stadium are currently open and close on the 5th of May.</p>
