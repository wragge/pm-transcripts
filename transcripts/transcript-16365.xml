    <content><![CDATA[<p>To Adam Gilchrist, Chair of the National Australia Day Council, Warren Pearson, National Director of the National Australia Day Council, Australian of the Year finalists, one and all. And where is Aaron Paul? Put your hand up. Aaron Paul, seriously decent bloke. Distinguished Australians, one and all.</p>
<p>I begin by acknowledging the First Australians on whose land we meet and whose cultures we celebrate as the oldest continuing cultures in human history.</p>
<p>Australia Day.</p>
<p>First of all, on behalf of Therese and myself, welcome to our home. It's an honour to have you with us this morning. And that's not a statement of politeness. It's not that. It's that having spent a little time speaking with each of as you've come in the door and to be reminded of who we are privileged to have among us today.</p>
<p>Each of you are leaders within your communities and therefore leaders across the nation. And you're not here for idle purpose, you're not here for random reasons. You're here because of the things that you have done, and because of the things that you will do and that's a good thing.</p>
<p>Leadership is really important and each of you in your own spheres have demonstrated those qualities of leadership which begin with one core and enduring quality, and that is service.</p>
<p>As I look through the extraordinary array of talent we have here, we have town leaders, community leaders who've bridged the gap between cultural and ethnic divides. We have sea rescuers, we have wildlife rescuers. We have businessmen, philanthropists, we have band leaders, those engaged in the campaign against childhood obesity.</p>
<p>Founders of youth charities, Paralympians, victim support workers, indigenous sports heroes, indigenous leaders, advocates and representatives of the stolen generations. Sporting legends. We also have motivational speakers who assist with those who are doing it tough. Sporting legends also who have now chosen to make a difference when it comes to the great fight against cancer.</p>
<p>We have also young writers and artists, scientists, medical specialists. We have literacy advocates, revolutionary school principals, church leaders and leaders in their local communities.</p>
<p>And then we have Peter Cundall. Yes, you. Gardening expert extraordinaire. Whose first line as he walked into The Lodge this morning was âwhat a waste of lawn'. His second great remark to us all was âI'd turn that into a potato patch'. So Cundall, whatever happens for the rest of the day, you're now on informal, unpaid commission. Therese will be in contact, smarten up and get your ideas ready.</p>
<p>None however could beat the extraordinary greeting I had this morning from Sam Cawthorn, if you've met Sam it's a unique experience. He's the bloke who knows the serious meaning of a firm handshake. As he leaves his hand in your hand.</p>
<p>He has an artificial hand. It's more than a party trick, let me tell you it takes your breath away. I met Sam the other morning in Hobart, his, he's told me this morning that his little girl, his little daughter provided him with an Australia Day dare to do that to the Prime Minister. What's your daughter's name?</p>
<p>CAWTHORN INTERJECTS: Emilia.</p>
<p>Emilia. Mission accomplished. I am still recovering and still in therapy.</p>
<p>This is going to be a great day and tomorrow will be an even greater day. It's great because it's a time when we acknowledge not just the ties that bind and form this nation Australia, not just acknowledge the wonder of the achievement of bringing about a nation for a continent and a continent for a nation and achieving such extraordinary unity under such extraordinary diversity.</p>
<p>It's all those things and each is important. But in terms of this event it's about honouring leadership and achievement. As I said at the beginning these things are not lightly considered nor are they lightly given. So however things turn out, know this from me as your Prime Minister: I admire and respect deeply what each of you has done and what each of you will do.</p>
<p>Equally I admire the achievements of our former Australians of the year. We have one slightly famous country and western singer  -  where is he? Oh there he is up there, bloke in the funny hat. Not you Dodson. D1, D2  -  B1, B2.</p>
<p>But thank you for your work this year. It has been a good voice for rural Australia in what has been a hard time for the bush.</p>
<p>As I conclude these remarks and they are purely remarks of welcome for what will be a couple of days of great celebration in the nation's capital - let's hold fast to this core truth about Australia and where we are in our current national voyage.</p>
<p>And it's the truth which has been with us for centuries past, sometimes better and in greater strength than others, but certainly with us today. And that is whatever challenges lie ahead for us this year and lie ahead for us in the century ahead, we are all in this together. Every one of us, wherever we have come from.</p>
<p>Businessmen, union leaders, indigenous leaders, other community leaders, those who are town mayors, shire presidents in the farthest outback, in the bush, our State governments, our national government, our cabinets, our church and community organisations. Those who are out there at the forefront of the medical and caring professions, those who are out there at the pioneering edges of science and innovation, those of you who are out there pushing the boundaries in terms of literary and creative endeavour.</p>
<p>And the challenges which lie ahead in the great admixture which equals this nation Australia, your talents in the year ahead will be called forth as community leaders. Many of us in this nation will need encouragement which as community leaders you are perfectly positioned to provide that.</p>
<p>In a much more difficult time in our history, one former resident of this grand old house, John Curtin, had this to say. The people of the nation are the 'strength of the nation'. The people of the nation are the strength of the nation.</p>
<p>Here we have leaders of the people, each and every one of you, and in you lies our strength this year as we the nation will prevail.</p>
<p>A very happy Australia Day.</p>
