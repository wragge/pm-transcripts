    <content><![CDATA[<p>Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull will visit Jakarta and Berlin ahead of the G20 and APEC Meetings this month.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister will visit Jakarta on November 12 to meet President Widodo and discuss Australia-Indonesia bilateral cooperation, with a particular focus on trade and economic ties, and common regional challenges.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister will then visit Berlin to meet Chancellor Merkel and discuss deepening  Australian relations with Germany and receive the recommendations of the Australia – Germany Advisory Group.</p>
<p>On 15-16 November the Prime Minister will attend the G20 leaders’ summit in Antalya, Turkey. Leaders from the world’s major economies will build on the outcomes from Brisbane last year and discuss ways to promote economic growth. G20 leaders will also discuss the challenges emanating from the conflict in Syria.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister will then travel to Manila to attend the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) leaders’ meeting on 18-19 November. APEC leaders represent 21 economies that account for more than half of global GDP and almost three quarters of Australia’s trade in goods and services. The theme for this year’s APEC meeting is ‘Building Inclusive Economies, Building a Better World’.</p>
<p>On 21-22 November, the Prime Minister will attend the tenth East Asia Summit (EAS) in Kuala Lumpur. This forum addresses the region’s political, strategic and economic challenges. Its members represent almost 70 per cent of Australia’s two-way trade and include eight of our top 10 trading partners. Discussions will include countering violent extremism, maritime cooperation and regional health security.</p>
<p>The challenge is to create the right environment for innovation, trade and investment to grow and flourish. This is essential to lifting the living standards of people all over the world, as it is here in Australia.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister looks forward to discussing with world leaders how we can work together to achieve our shared vision for a prosperous, open, innovative and energetic region and world.</p>
