PRIME MINISTER'S PR,-S, CONFERENCE, j-2 IS, N'VMBER 1974<br />
QUESTION: Are you going to make any major announcements here<br />
in Mt Isa?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I don't have it in mind to make any particular<br />
announcement, any one announcement. The approach that my<br />
Government has to Mt Isa can be seen from the fact that we have<br />
set up a Department of Northern Development. We particularly<br />
want to concentrate on developing this most distant part of<br />
Australia and the first Minister for Northern Development,<br />
Dr Rex Patterson, is a public man who knows the North from<br />
east to west more than any one has ever known it.<br />
There have been quite a number of specific things<br />
that we have been able to do for Mt Isa, for instance, we<br />
have now put through the Parliament it went through the Senate<br />
on Thursday night the Local Government Grants Bill constituting<br />
the first recommendations made by the reconstituted Grants<br />
Commission and Mt Isa City Council will get $ 250,000 within<br />
a fortnight to spend as it sees fit. Cloncurry will get<br />
$ 86,000. My colleague Mr Frank Stewart, the Minister for<br />
Tourism and Recreation, has already I believe announced a grant<br />
of $ 115,000 to a community recreation centre in Mt Isa.<br />
My colleague Mr Bill Hayden, the Minister for<br />
: oial Security, will be opening a regional office of the<br />
De -rtment of Social Security this financial year. There are<br />
par cular difficulties facing the residents of Mt Isa because<br />
of . ie city's isolation. A social worker will be included among<br />
the st of the Social Security office in Mt Isa. It won't<br />
theret r-e dealing just with paym-nts and the assessment of<br />
payments; i ill also have a person trained to give advice.<br />
I think there are 340 aged pensioners in Mt Isa, 133 invalid<br />
pensioners, 123 widow pensioners and 4,000 families receiving<br />
child endowment. I don't think ever in Australia I've been<br />
received by so many babes in arms at an airport. I have at<br />
Rabaul, in Papua New GC: inea, but never in Australia. Mr Hayden's<br />
Deprrtment is also considering an application for a 34-bed<br />
ho,' tal for the care of the aged in Mt Isa.<br />
Now perhaps I can give the Northwest Star details<br />
of th . e afterwards. You aren't going to press until Monday<br />
are you.<br />
QUESTION: This ' 250,000.....<br />
PRIME MINISTER: It is for -he Council to spend as it sees fit.<br />
QUESTION: Has any request been made to you for finance ( unclear)<br />
PRIME MINISTER: That's being considered by the body that the<br />
Australiai and State Governments have all set up. It's being<br />
reviewed by that body the Screening Committee of the National<br />
Water Program and it may be that the Queensland and Australian<br />
Government will be able to make some announcement. There has<br />
been no proposition made by the State Government than the one which </p>
<p>we accepted in the legislation in 1972 and then again earlier<br />
this year. An agreement was signed between our two Gove
on 11 April this year embodying the only matters which had becn<br />
formally put b the State Government to the Australian Government<br />
up till that time or at all. I also should tell you that there<br />
is. going to be. a legal aid office opened in Mt Isa. In the<br />
overall context Mt Isa will have the great advantage of being<br />
a pivotal point on the National Highways Program. The Australian<br />
Government has alway-had the authority under the Constitution<br />
to build roads to promote trade between the States or access to<br />
the Territories, so we are going to undertake the whole cost<br />
of maintaining and constructing the Flinders and Landsborough<br />
Highway. That means you will at last be certain there is a<br />
decent road available all the time between Mt Isa and Brisbane<br />
and all points south and between Mt Isa and of course, the<br />
Northern Territory. Mr Connor, is very keen to upgrade the railway, which<br />
is now fully extended and he may tell you more about his proposals<br />
for the phosphate deposits for which the railway would have to<br />
be upgraded between Duchess and the Coast.<br />
You not only have copper here and so on but in this<br />
region you also have the very best deposits that Australia has<br />
ever discovered in phosphates, and they're very large items of<br />
import to Australia. These places from which we've been importing<br />
phosphates are running out Nauru, Ocean Island, Christmas Island,<br />
in the Indian Ocean and we have these very great deposits within<br />
Australia, within this region.<br />
QUSTION: The building industries in town are worried about the<br />
lack of housing commission homes which are to be built in the<br />
next year within this city. Are there any commission homes<br />
planned early in 1975 to keep these men who are frightened of<br />
losing in employment?<br />
PRIME MINISTL_. The State Government builds housing commJisuoi.<br />
houses; the Australian Government finds the money for thE<br />
Last June I gave every State Premier a blank cheque to bui,.,<br />
housing commission b-uses. As many houses as the Queensland<br />
Government can let a ntract for will be financed by my Government.<br />
There's no bottleneck far as the Australian Government is<br />
conct-rned. Every house which the Housing Commission can build<br />
in t, ensland will be immediately funded by the Australian<br />
t. That has been the position ever since last June 7.<br />
You are mentioning building too. There is, I don't know the<br />
details f-t -stance schools in Mt Isa, but a year ago the<br />
Australian i iament passed legislation to provide for additional<br />
funds for schoo uildings for 1974/ 75. Queensland to date has<br />
only sought 18% o-the m, -v which the Australian Parliament passed<br />
twelve months ago for GoveL..-nt school buildings. So that<br />
means there is an inense amou: i ) f nioney available for housing<br />
commission homes as many as the StaLe Government can construct<br />
and for school buildings. The Government can have as much money<br />
for those buildings as it has so far spent.<br />
QUESTION: Can I ask Mr Connor a question?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Yes indeed. I would like you to. This is one<br />
of the mineral capitals of Australian and he's the Czar of<br />
minerals in Australia. </p>
<p>-3-<br />
QUESTION: Th-.. ee countries have taken measures to boost<br />
maintain the copper price? What will Australia b1-doing ahojc this-<br />
CONNOR: Well the CIPEC countries that's Peru, Chile, Zambia<br />
and Zaire have decided to curtail production by 10%. It's<br />
debatable as to what the net result of it will be. Copper is of<br />
course, is a highly volatile metal in price and its history has<br />
traditionally been one of production in politically unstable<br />
countries. We in Australia have tried to maintain a stable<br />
price and I wouldn't like to hazard a guess as to the ultimate<br />
effect. I don't think it will have much. The trend in copper<br />
has been downwards. Copper at one stage was right up around<br />
$ 2.260 a ton so dear, in fact, that it was pricing itself our<br />
of the market and substitutes were coming in. The position t0lay<br />
is a much more healthy one, providing we can hold the present<br />
price structure.<br />
QUESTION: There's no question of you suggesting that Mt Isa<br />
Mines should cut their production?<br />
CONNOR: I think we can place all that they can produce<br />
immense amounts.<br />
QUESTION: Are you expecting a censure motion in the House on<br />
Monday? PRIME MINISTER: I just have to read what you have to say in<br />
the papers. I don't know.<br />
QL. ' TION: Are you going back for the Parliament on Monday?<br />
PRIIE PINISTER: Yes I'll be going back.<br />
QUESTION: Yr i made a comment a while ago that the petrol sn1 : y<br />
for country .: eas would only affect mining companies and sm.<br />
Do you think this is really true when you ccnsider thai , T<br />
of petrol now costs llÂ½ more than when the subsidy was i, t".<br />
which is now coming out of the woilking man'.-pocket-<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Th( . rincipal beneficiaries were mining companir<br />
in this city and in Western Australia. In this context I buliev<br />
th; 4orking man in general would be much more assisted iby<br />
ele : ity. As you will appreciate, there are . rr, qreat<br />
numhel of people in this region who don't have Lars a. J1l and<br />
the petr-l subsidy makes no difierence to them. There ctre ve<br />
few indeeu don't use electricity and provincial cities ir<br />
Queensland pa, -re than provincial cities anywhere else in<br />
Australia. Las. Jane I ' rote to the outgoing Premier suggesting<br />
that his Government and Government might co-operate in a str-v<br />
to ascertain the cost Y e1 -tricity in Queens-la:;. i : vinci<br />
cities and in th: State gcne. Ad be Drought dowi. cise:<br />
the average price of the eastern Stares. He hasn't yet answered<br />
the letter.<br />
QUESTION: Has Mr Hawke contacted you about the ajrline sLrik.-<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Yes. Yes.<br />
QUESTION: Can you tell us anything.... </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTE: No I don't publicise conversations I ha,.<br />
QUESTION: He apparently was anxious....<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Well that may be but I'm not going to. I never<br />
have and I'm not going to. A very great number of people speak<br />
to me face to face or on the telephone and I do not make a<br />
practice of announcing what we discuss.<br />
QUESTION: Have you spoken to Mr Jones?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No. Well what do you mean by telephone? No.<br />
QUESTION: Could I ask whether you support the idea of TAA and<br />
Ansett together discussing the wage issue? With the....<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I believe that the domestic pilots ought to<br />
go to Arbitration. I have no sympathy whatever at their<br />
resorting to direct action so promptly as they've become<br />
accustomed to do.<br />
QUESTION: Did they not resort to direct action because the<br />
Government airline and Ansett would not negotiate with them?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: It's for them to say why they resorted to direct<br />
action. The proposition is that they should go to Arbitration.<br />
QUESTION: Yesterday a comment was made by a prominent ALP man<br />
that especially in Queensland, the employers were forcing or<br />
inti. midating the worker into strike action to make it look bad<br />
for the ALP. Do you have any comments on that?<br />
PRIME D NISTER: No, quite frankly I haven't seen the papers.<br />
Where vas this supposed to be said? The other chaps here with<br />
us wou. d ki. i that I don't comment on comments like this. Y<br />
can ask me tu my views but I'm long experienced now; I<br />
that there's nothing in commenting on somebody's summary<br />
selection of somebody else's comment.<br />
QUESTION: I would 1-e to talk about thc National Highway Schem?&amp; te.<br />
The Landsborough Highway is now a national road but the slightcst<br />
amoint of rain closes it. What allocation frow the Highway Scher,.<br />
wil] he Government make for this stretch of road?<br />
PRIME Ii[ NISTER: I haven't got at my fingertips the exa, amiour<br />
There a: national highways in Queensland the one<br />
State bcrde ar Warwick through Brisbane to Cairns and ther: will<br />
be another one om Cairns up to Mt Isa and the Territory border.<br />
We have now accented the sponsibility of maintaining and<br />
constructing those roads. er since the war successive<br />
Australian Govcrnments have -11 hundreds of millions of dollrs;<br />
to State Governments for roads and State Government i<br />
succeeded in producing a national highway scheme. You c; jinot cgo<br />
at every time of the year with certainty between the varous Stc. t,*<br />
Territory -apitals. In those circumstances the Australian Gov. i<br />
has decided to accept the responsibility which it has always<br />
had under the Constitution.<br />
QUESTION: What plans do you have or does the Government have<br />
to improve the statistical information regarding economic changes<br />
which Treasury delivers to the Government? </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER: I'll be in a better position to tell yr. within<br />
a week.<br />
QUESTION: There are plans for this....<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Yes, but it would be premature for me to mention<br />
them.<br />
QUESTION: Why do yoL say within a week, Prime Mi . ister?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Well I might be able to tell you that ii, a few<br />
days. I'll issue communique in a few days, probably on that.<br />
QUESTION: Prime Minister, will you answer questions today about<br />
the transfer of Mr Crean from Treasury portfolio?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No.<br />
QUESTION: Do you think that the Premier is taking the ri. jht<br />
line in campaigning on national issues in the State election?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I welcome the opportunity to expose his lack of<br />
co-operation on national issues. We have decided to accept<br />
responsibility for a national roads scheme because of the failures<br />
for 17 years now of Country Party/ Liberal Government in this<br />
State. It's true that in two years we have been unable to<br />
overcome the deficiencies of 17h years of LCP Government, Federal<br />
and Queensland. We're doing our best. He doesn't like it but there<br />
are other Premiers who don't like it either but they are accepting<br />
-t where they see it is of benefit to their citizens. Other<br />
Pi. tiers realise that there have been shortcomings which have<br />
developad and they swallow their pride and accept our assistance<br />
in (. veicoming those shortcomings. But the Queensland Premier<br />
alone c7-s not do so. I have pointed to the fact that the<br />
Premie h. c -ived his State of at least $ 50 million udcir<br />
schemes whi have been accepted by every other State.<br />
legislation has been passed by the Australian Government<br />
with the support in most cases of the Liberal and Countr'<br />
in both Houses. Sometimes those parties have divided e.<br />
Country Party suppo '-ed the Schools Program; the Liberals opposeit<br />
b-it it went throus,, both Houses. Any schemes we enact apply<br />
to The whole of Australia. They are available on the same con: Li<br />
in c ' ery part of Australia and the other States have accepted<br />
theoL s-hemes, e. g. the scheme for reducing the r -cc of land&amp;,<br />
for bu..-ding in regional centres.<br />
is a situation resented by the Queensland Libera<br />
leader, Sir G. ion ChalTk, the Treasurer, the Deputy Premier. He<br />
would have ente. I into these schemes, the same as any other<br />
Liberal Premier in Austr._ i as well as the Labor leaders in<br />
Australia have already don.<br />
QUESTION: This $ 50 million that Mr Bjelke-Petersen hasn't spent;<br />
how much has this contributed to unemployment? Have you got any<br />
figures on the jobs that may have been provided with increasel<br />
expenditure? </p>
<p>4 -6-<br />
PRIME MINISTE~ R: No I haven't but very obviously there w,. uld b<br />
a great deal of employment created by the development of growth<br />
centres or laind development schemes. That has been the case in<br />
Monarto in South Australia and Albury-Wodonga and with Bathurst-<br />
Orange. But I would say the big contribution to employment is in<br />
the building industry., i. e. if they would only in this State use<br />
the money which is available for school buildings and welfare<br />
housing. </p>
