ELECTORATE TALK<br />
In the coming week I will be attending a Commonwealth Meeting<br />
in New Delhi, which will bring together Heads of Government<br />
of 16 countries from the Asian and Pacific regions. The meeting<br />
is the second Commonwealth Heads of Government Regional Meeting,<br />
the first was held in Sydney in 1978.<br />
The Commonwealth of Nations differs from all other international<br />
associations in that its members share not a common ideology or<br />
interest, like the non-aligned movement, nor the same geographical<br />
region, like ASEAN or the Organisation of African Unity, but<br />
a similar heritage, derived from institutions associated with<br />
the former British Empire. This historical link provides the<br />
Commonwealth with many of the features which makes it unique.<br />
mongst its members are to be found countries in all parts of<br />
the world, at every size and stage of economic development, with<br />
a variety of political systems and ideological beliefs and a<br />
multiplicity of languages, religions and cultures. The<br />
Commonwealth is a unique institution. But its special quality<br />
goes even beyond the exceptional features I have identified.<br />
It remains a voluntary association which operates only on the<br />
basis of consensus. There are no obligations connected with<br />
membership; no treaty or other written commitments; only a<br />
dedication to the ideals of the Commonwealth," such as those<br />
enshrined in the Declaration of Commonwealth Principles, adopted<br />
by Heads of Government in Singapore in 1971.<br />
There, the Commonwealth members expressed the belief that<br />
international peace and order were essential to the security<br />
of mankind: that the liberty of the individual was sacrosant;<br />
that racial prejudice was a dangerous sickness; that all forms<br />
of colonial domination and racial oppression were to be opposed;<br />
that the wide disparities in wealth now<br />
existing between different sections of mankind were too great<br />
to be tolerated; and, that international co-operation was essential<br />
to remove the causes of war, promote tolerance, combat injustice,<br />
and secure development amongst the peoples of the world.<br />
A source of particular strength in the Commonwealth is its<br />
tradition of holding its discussions confidentially, and reaching<br />
decisions without voting. This enables the members to engage in<br />
full and frank exchanges of view, but at the same time to mak: e<br />
special efforts to reconcile different points of view in solving<br />
global and regional problems. / 2 </p>
<p>2<br />
It was in this context that the Commonwealth was instrumental<br />
in achieving a breakthrough in the political impasse over<br />
Rhodesia's future, through the Lancaster House talks last year.<br />
The independence of Zimbabwe and its admission to the CoimmonwealLh<br />
are a great tribute to the association's role in contemporary<br />
diplomacy. At a less publicised, but no less important level, are the<br />
Commo,. ealth's activities in ec0onmic and functional co-operation,<br />
which provide worthwhile and practical results to member countries.<br />
The concept of a Commonwealth Heads of Government Regional Meeting<br />
arose from an Australian perception that the countries and<br />
interests of South East Asia and particularly the Pacific Ocean<br />
regions were not receiving the attention they merited at<br />
regular Heads of Government Meetings because of the Commonwealth's<br />
size and pre-occupation with other world-wide issues.<br />
The Government accordingly decided that, to bring greater<br />
Commonwealth focus to bear on the areas of Australia's north west<br />
and east, all Commonwealth countries in the Asian/ Pacific region<br />
would be invited to a meeting in Sydney in February 1978. This<br />
meeting demonstrated that the CHOGRI. I-as it has come to be<br />
called concept had responded to a genuinely felt need by the<br />
participants, particularly from the South Pacific, for a<br />
Commonwealth forum of greater relevance and suitability to their<br />
interests, and the agreement to hold the second meeting in<br />
New Delhi underscored the success of that Australian initiative.<br />
The Sydney meeting was successful not only from the point of view<br />
of the expanded consultative process it has created, but also<br />
because it instituted a general pattern of both ecoic and<br />
political consultation and understanding which has-enabled the<br />
island leaders of the South Pacific to find roles for their<br />
countries in the* international community.<br />
The flow-on from the Sydney CHOGRM has seen the creation of<br />
a. network for. exchanges of ideas at the official and political<br />
levels throughout the region which could not have been achieved<br />
without the institution of that meeting.<br />
The New Delhi meeting has the capacity to promote dialogue<br />
between Heads of Government at a particularly critical time in<br />
international political and economic developments. It will bring<br />
together Heads of Government from a region which borders on the<br />
scene of some of the most serious political issues now confronting<br />
the world, in Afghanistan and South East Asia. It is also expected<br />
to give major attention to ways and means of increasing<br />
co-operation between member countries, particularly in the areas<br />
of energy, and industrial development. Australia will play its<br />
full part in these efforts.<br />
It has already been announced that Melbourne will be the venue<br />
for the full Heads of Government Meeting late next year. This<br />
will be the most important international meeting ever held in<br />
Australia, bringing together more than 40 I-leads of Government.<br />
Arrangements are already in hand for the organisation of this<br />
meeting and I am confident that it will enjoy the success that has<br />
characterised past meetings and that it will make a significant<br />
contribution to the consideration of important world issues and<br />
the furthering of Commonwealth co-operation. I would also like to<br />
add that the , ary fact that that meeting is being held in Australia<br />
is, in a sense, a compliment to Australia and a compliment to the<br />
role that Australia ' has played in a constructive way in Commonwealand<br />
international affairs. 00 </p>
