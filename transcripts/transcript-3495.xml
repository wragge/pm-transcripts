PRICES JUSTIFICATION TRIBUNAL<br />
PRICES OF IMPORTED GOODS<br />
The Prime Minister, Mr Whitlan, announced today<br />
that the Prices Justification Tribunal had begun to conduct<br />
field surveys to check the prices of imported goods on<br />
sale at retail stores.<br />
Mr Whitlam~ said that these prices would be checked<br />
back against the landed prices of goods. These figures<br />
would be supplied by the Department of Customs and Excise.<br />
Where appropriate, discussions would be held with<br />
the companies concerned in relation to any markups considered<br />
to be excessive. Mr Whitlam. said that the membership and staff of<br />
the Tribunal were being expanded to provide for these<br />
operations. A new retail branch had been established, he<br />
said, and a member with specific responsibilities in the<br />
retail area would commence duty on 2 January 1975. In<br />
the meantime, work was going ahead in this area.<br />
Mr Whitlam. recalled that in his Second Reading Speech<br />
on the Prices Justification Bill he had said:<br />
" The Tribunal will employ additional powers,<br />
particularly, but not exclusively, in actively enquiring<br />
into and reporting upon both retail prices and the prices of<br />
imported goods. For these purposes, we shall provide a<br />
modest expansion of the Tribunal's staff and will ensure<br />
that the Tribunal is backed by the collaboration of other<br />
departments and agencies. Steps have already been taken to<br />
this end in conjunction with the Department of Overseas<br />
Trade, the Department of Customs and Excise and the<br />
Australian Bureau of Statistics."<br />
