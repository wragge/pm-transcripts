INTERVIEW WITH D. WEBB, HSV 7, MELBOURNE<br />
Question: We are very interested to know your reaction to<br />
Mr. Dunstan's comments.<br />
Prime Minister: I've got no comments about that at all.<br />
It's a Victorian Government matter so far as I am concerned.<br />
I've got no comment about that.<br />
Question: But his comments were pretty personal about you.<br />
1to say<br />
Prime Minister: That doesn't mean/ I would have to reciprocate.<br />
No. I've got no comment, it'-s a Victorian Government matter.<br />
I would like to say that one report-. I saw in this morning's<br />
newspaper is totally false.<br />
Question: You didn't get in touch with Mr. Hamer?<br />
Prime Minister; Mr. Hamer had a phone call booked to me and<br />
told me what action he had taken at lunchtime on the day.<br />
That's all.<br />
Question: And you did not move to have Mr. Dunstan sacked?<br />
Prime Minister Good heavens no. I said that's a Victorian<br />
Government matter and Mr. Hamer told me he'd made his decision<br />
and so far as I was concerned that was it. But I haven't put<br />
a view to Mr. Hamer and I haven't sought to.<br />
Question: Do you have any objection to Mr. Dunstan's reference<br />
to your handling of the economy?<br />
Prime Minister; Well, I just believe Mr. Dunstan is wrong.<br />
T'he economy is starting to improve significantly, inflation is<br />
c-oming down. It is going to come down further. Interest<br />
rates are starting to come down. The shading of the last<br />
Commonwealth Loan was still marginally less than the loan before<br />
and having this flow through into, as it ultimately will,<br />
to home loans for home purchases, to the ordinary bank overdrafts<br />
for individuals all around the country. At the last election<br />
I used the example; you get a 2% reduction in interest rates<br />
for the average home buyer and that saves a young couple ten<br />
dollars a week. Now, that was stated as an objective. It's<br />
still the kind of objective we are after and having got that<br />
we would want to go further.<br />
Question: This is what Mr. Dunstan says he was after really;<br />
he wanted help for the building industry which he says is in<br />
a very serious situation in Victoria.<br />
Prime Minister; I think Victoria may be starting to go through<br />
some of the problems that other states have experienced at<br />
an earlier time. I think you know that there had been a large<br />
surplus stock of houses in a number of states that built just<br />
couldn't be sold and that's been a drag on the market for I think<br />
much longer than many people thought. But in the we had to<br />
come to the view that there was too much reliance in total terms / 2 </p>
<p>-2<br />
Prime Minister: ( cont)<br />
on the Federal Budget for housing and therefore we<br />
wanted matching arrangements because we had been advised<br />
that the States were -asking for funds and that they<br />
were going to cut their own Budget allocations to housing<br />
and you know our coffers aren't inexhaustible and everyone<br />
knows that and so therefore we wanted an arrangement that<br />
would make sure that the States still put up their cash for<br />
housing and therefore a base grant from the Commonwealth<br />
together with additional sums on a matching basis which was<br />
estimated against the sort of historical performance of<br />
the States. In addition to that, the States have very large<br />
sums available through re-cycling of the funds through the<br />
housing you know, the sales of older houses and the States<br />
can influence the extent to which those funds are available<br />
because they can influence the extent to which houses are<br />
sold in any one year.<br />
Question: You are saying the States should be doing more<br />
in this direction?<br />
Prime Minister; Without me saying that, at the time of<br />
the last Premier's Conference on the estimates given us by<br />
the States, the sums available for re-investment in housing,<br />
welfare housing, through the sale of houses, through re-cycling<br />
of the funds, is going to be significantly greater this year<br />
than last year and taken overall, the direct grants, the matching<br />
grants, the re-cycled funds, on the information available to<br />
the Commonwealth, Australia as a whole ought to be maintaining<br />
a program at least as large as last year and depending upon<br />
the rate of inflation, maybe a bit better than that.<br />
Question: Finally, Prime Minister, there was a reference in<br />
Mr. Dunstan's outburst about your old school do you object<br />
to that?<br />
Prime Minister; I thought it was a good old school there are,<br />
a lot of old schools. I've been in politics a long while...<br />
boy<br />
Question: A Melbourne Grammar/ doesn't make the sort of comments<br />
that Mr. Dunstan made?<br />
Prime Minister: No, it's not a question of that. I think<br />
a Melbourne High School kid mightn't make those sorts of comments<br />
either and over the years there have been many personal attacks<br />
on myself of different kinds. I always try not to reply in<br />
that vein. 000---</p>
