    <content><![CDATA[<p><strong>NEIL MITCHELL:</strong></p>
<p>Mr Abbott, good morning.</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER:</strong></p>
<p>G’day, Neil.</p>
<p><strong>NEIL MITCHELL:</strong></p>
<p>Prime Minister, the brutal murder of James Foley, in a sense, as some of the experts are saying, is this a warning to Australia as well?</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER:</strong></p>
<p>It’s a sign of the evil barbarity of the ISIL movement, that’s what it is. It’s a sign that there is an utter ruthlessness and depravity about this movement which is hideous and sickening and deplorable and it just strengthens my resolve and, frankly, it should strengthen every Australian’s resolve, to do whatever we humanly can to ensure that we never have the slightest hint of this kind of thing here in Australia.</p>
<p><strong>NEIL MITCHELL:</strong></p>
<p>Some of the international commentators, and in fact, even the Indonesian President, is saying that world leaders need to reunite to stand against radicalisation. This is a British accent – the killer has a British accent – this is the point. Is it not sending a message about home-grown terrorism?</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER:</strong></p>
<p>Well, I think there’s much in what you’re saying, Neil. We know that there are about 60 Australians fighting with ISIL and other terrorist groups in the Middle East. We know that there’s about 100 others who are involved in various support networks for these people. This is a deep concern. Yes, it’s a tiny, tiny, tiny – miniscule – percentage of our population, but nevertheless, it doesn’t take very many people. As the September 11th assaults on the United States showed, it doesn’t take very many people to do enormous damage to countries using modern technology, with all of the abilities that the modern world gives them.</p>
<p><strong>NEIL MITCHELL:</strong></p>
<p>Do you think the use of the British accent, though is designed… or the man with a British accent – a British person – is designed as a message to the West?</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER:</strong></p>
<p>I have little doubt that the ISIL movement are masters of propaganda; they’re masters of social media. They are probably the most effective terrorist movement the world has yet seen, and that’s why it’s very important that we redouble or vigilance and boost our efforts to ensure that our country is safe.</p>
<p><strong>NEIL MITCHELL:</strong></p>
<p>Does this increase the threat to Australia?</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER:</strong></p>
<p>The formal threat level remains that same as it’s been for years, but the fact that there are significantly larger numbers of Australians participating in this terrorist movement than there were participating in Afghanistan with the Taliban about a decade or so back, does suggest that we do need more resources and we do need renewed powers to cope. Back in the Taliban days, about 30 Australians went overseas to get involved and of those that came back, about two thirds were subsequently involved in terrorist activities here, Neil.</p>
<p>So, we do need to take this very, very seriously. Yes, what happens in Syria and Northern Iraq is a long way away, but it has ramifications for our country because there are Australians involved.</p>
<p><strong>NEIL MITCHELL:</strong></p>
<p>A number of Islamic leaders have pulled out of meetings with yourself and with the Attorney-General. Are you getting enough support in this this atmosphere from the Islamic leadership in this country?</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER:</strong></p>
<p>Well I’d rather focus on the very many that have come to these meetings rather than the few who, in my mind, have rather foolishly boycotted them. And look, the spirit in the meetings that I did have was very, very good – very, very good. Not everyone agreed with me on everything, but nevertheless, I think there was a Team Australia spirit amongst them and one was even good enough to say, “We are all part of Team Australia, and you are our captain”, which showed a great enthusiasm for our country.</p>
<p>Look, Australian Muslims are as enthusiastic for Australia as every other immigrant group. The measures that we are talking about are not directed against any particular community or any particular religion; they’re directed against terrorism and potential terrorism.</p>
<p><strong>NEIL MITCHELL:</strong></p>
<p>Will you speak to the Indonesian President given he’s said there needs to be international leaders standing against radicalisation?</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER:</strong></p>
<p>Well, I certainly speak quite often to President Yudhoyono. He’s been an extraordinarily good President of Indonesia and a great friend of Australia. Sadly, he’s leaving office soon, but I have high hopes of an equally good relationship with Jokowi, who has replaced him, and I’m looking forward to meeting the new Indonesian President as quickly as I can.</p>
<p><strong>NEIL MITCHELL:</strong></p>
<p>Does all this change the imperative in Iraq, or the involvement of Australia, in the region? Does it increase the possibility of boots on the ground?</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER:</strong></p>
<p>President Obama has been crystal clear that there is no intention of sending combat troops into Iraq or Syria and look, we are always ready to talk to our allies and partners about what we can do as part of what are essentially humanitarian missions. But, like President Obama, I certainly wouldn’t envisage Australian combat troops on the ground.</p>
<p><strong>NEIL MITCHELL:</strong></p>
<p>I notice Jemaah Islamiah, which has certainly been a problem for Australia and South East Asia – it was once known as the South East Asian arm of al-Qaida – I notice Jemaah Islamiah has supported ISIL. Jemaah Islamiah certainly did and has a foothold in parts of Asia. Does that concern you?</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER:</strong></p>
<p>Yes it does, Neil. The ambitions of ISIL are extraordinary. The declaration of a caliphate is a sign of their grasp for universal dominion and their claim to universal allegiance from Muslims everywhere. The interesting thing is that rather than being scoffed at, at least some people of influence and significance seem to have been energised by this. The fact that Jemaah Islamiah, which has been the leading Indonesian terrorist sponsor, is now saying that they are loyal to ISIL, I think is quite concerning and it’s a sign that this is a different level of threat to that which we’ve seen in the past.</p>
<p><strong>NEIL MITCHELL:</strong></p>
<p>The most serious we’ve faced?</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER:</strong></p>
<p>Well, as I said, this ISIL movement appears to be the most effective terrorist organisation we’ve yet seen, or has the potential to be the most effective terrorist organisation we’ve yet seen, and that’s why, Neil, it’s so important that we redouble our domestic vigilance and that’s why we’ve committed an extra $630 million to our various security agencies over the next four years.</p>
<p><strong>NEIL MITCHELL:</strong></p>
<p>Prime Minister, if I may, on a couple of other things – Senator Jacqui Lambie is urging the reintroduction of national service. Could we ever go back to national service?</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER:</strong></p>
<p>Look, I don’t see it. I think there are many people who emotionally and instinctively think it’s a good idea, but if you talk to the military chiefs they’re not so sold on it. I think any form of national service that we might contemplate today wouldn’t be exclusively, or even largely, military. I mean, Neil, I want young people to be making a contribution and one of the reasons why I’m determined not to allow young people to leave school and go on the Dole is because I want young people to start their adult lives making a contribution to our country rather than sitting around. That’s my objective: to keep people active and busy and useful, but not necessarily drag them into the armed forces.</p>
<p><strong>NEIL MITCHELL:</strong></p>
<p>Prime Minister, will you look at exempting children from the Medicare co-payment, the $7 to visit a doctor?</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER:</strong></p>
<p>Neil, look, we’re determined to try to ensure that we fix Labor’s debt and deficit disaster and part of that is keeping Medicare sustainable for the long-term. We want to keep Medicare sustainable for the long-term and, as Bob Hawke said back in the early ‘90s when Labor introduced a co-payment, as the Labor Party has long said in respect of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme co-payment, sometimes you’ve got to pay something to appreciate what you’re getting. Medicare is a great scheme and I think if there is a modest co-payment, that will increase the way we value and respect our marvellous Medicare system.</p>
<p><strong>NEIL MITCHELL:</strong></p>
<p>So, will you consider exempting children, or not?</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER:</strong></p>
<p>Well, obviously, we’re talking to crossbench senators about the proposed legislation and let’s see where these discussions go. But, I don’t see why the same principles that govern the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme shouldn’t govern Medicare as well.</p>
<p><strong>NEIL MITCHELL:</strong></p>
<p>I noticed the Reserve Bank Governor says it’s not actually a tough Budget at all.</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER:</strong></p>
<p>Well, it’s interesting. He said it was hardly draconian…</p>
<p><strong>NEIL MITCHELL:</strong></p>
<p>“Not that tough”, quote, unquote.</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER:</strong></p>
<p>‘I don’t think, really, that the Budget was that draconian’ – that’s what he said. And, he also said that it was a prudent and sensible strategy – a prudent and sensible strategy – to build up the savings measures over time. So look, I welcome what Glenn Stevens has said. I think it’s one of the more sensible comments about the Budget over the last month or so.</p>
<p><strong>NEIL MITCHELL:</strong></p>
<p>He does say, quote, “Not that tough”, unquote. Is it tough or not?</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER:</strong></p>
<p>Well, if you listen to the Labor Party, it’s the end of the world as we know it…</p>
<p><strong>NEIL MITCHELL:</strong></p>
<p>Well, what’s on the table – what is on the table now? We’re told this could be the week where things are renegotiated. What is up for renegotiation – the Medicare co-payment, one? Indexation? What about pensioners?</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER:</strong></p>
<p>Neil, we brought down a Budget. It’s the Governments answer to Labor’s debt and deficit disaster. We fully support the budget measures, we stand behind the Budget measures, we accept that we’ve got to get it through the Senate, and obviously, that involves a conversation, a dialogue, a negotiation. But, we are asking the Senate to support the Budget that we brought down and, frankly, if the Labor Party had any sense of shame for six years of chaos and debt and deficit disaster, they would tell us what their solutions are.</p>
<p><strong>NEIL MITCHELL:</strong></p>
<p>But things are clearly on the table. I mean, Senator Leyonhjelm suggested reverse mortgages for pensioners who own their own home. Is that on the table? Will you look at that?</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER:</strong></p>
<p>Well, the short answer is, the Budget is on the table and we want the Budget passed…</p>
<p><strong>NEIL MITCHELL:</strong></p>
<p>Will you rule out at least… a lot of people are frightened of these reverse mortgages being compulsory for pensioners. Will you rule that out?</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER:</strong></p>
<p>It’s not a proposal that’s ever been put to me and it’s not something that we have any intention of doing.</p>
<p><strong>NEIL MITCHELL:</strong></p>
<p>It’s been put by Senator Leyonhjelm, one of the cats you’re trying to herd.</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER:</strong></p>
<p>Not to me – not to me, Neil.</p>
<p><strong>NEIL MITCHELL:</strong></p>
<p>You don’t like the idea?</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER:</strong></p>
<p>Well, Neil, it’s not an idea that’s been put to me, it’s not an idea that I’ve considered; it’s not an idea which is any part of the Government’s thinking.</p>
<p><strong>NEIL MITCHELL:</strong></p>
<p>Well, it’s been put to your Treasurer.</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER:</strong></p>
<p>Well, it’s not an idea that’s been put to me; it’s not an idea that’s part of the Government’s thinking.</p>
<p><strong>NEIL MITCHELL:</strong></p>
<p>Pensioners are going to war today. What can you offer them?</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER:</strong></p>
<p>Well again, Neil, the best thing we can do for all Australians is to get the Budget under control because if we want a strong economy, we’ve got to have a strong Budget. So, rather than people looking at things in isolation and saying, “Oh, this is the impact on me”, we’ve got to look at the impact on Australia. If we are going to have a strong, prosperous economy, a safe and secure Australia, we need to get the Budget under control. Pensioners are patriotic people. They know what it’s like to run budgets, to run families and they understand that we’ve got to live within our means and I think, also, they’re grateful for the abolition of the carbon tax because that will save pensioners money as well as saving everyone else money.</p>
<p><strong>NEIL MITCHELL:</strong></p>
<p>Thank you for your time. In a word, dealing with all these crossbenchers and the Palmer Uniteds of the world and the Motorist Enthusiasts, is this a bit like herding cats? How would you describe it?</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER:</strong></p>
<p>Look, it’s business as usual. Just about every government in the post-war era has had to negotiate with the Senate and it’s no different with us than it’s been with our predecessors.</p>
<p><strong>NEIL MITCHELL:</strong></p>
<p>Thank you so much for your time.</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER:</strong></p>
<p>Thank you, Neil.</p>
