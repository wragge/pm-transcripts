PRIME MINISTER'S 3KZ LABOR HOUR BROADCAST<br />
( Recorded 28 November 1974 for replay 1 December 1974)<br />
Two years ago tonight, Labor was poised for its<br />
first Federal election victory in 23 years. It was a moment<br />
of great optimism, great promise and high hope for all of<br />
us in the party and the movement. Those hopes have been<br />
fulfilled. A great record of achievement stands behind us.<br />
And despite our difficulties, despite world-wide economic<br />
problems, our hopes are still high.<br />
As you know, we are contending with the twin<br />
problems of inflation and unemployment which afflict every<br />
industrial Western * country. For the first time we are fighting<br />
both these problems at once. We are carrying on the fight<br />
with every available weapon, every measure at our disposal,<br />
every constitutional power we possess. We've had very little<br />
help or co-operation from our opponents in the Senate or<br />
elsewhere. But I ask you to remember this: Australiansare<br />
everywhere better off than they were before Labor came in.<br />
Average weekly earnings, allowing for inflation, have increased<br />
in real purchasing power by 3.2 per cent in the year to June<br />
1973 and by a further 3.9 per cent in the year to June 1974.<br />
That's a gain of more than seven per cent in real living<br />
standards under a Labor Government.<br />
Throughout the year we have taken a wide range of<br />
economic decisions. We no. longer regard the Budget as our<br />
sole instrument of economic policy. We have been much more<br />
resourceful, much more flexible in our approach. only three<br />
weeks ago I announced a new series of measures to stimulate<br />
the economy and reduce unemployment. We have made cuts in<br />
taxation which, together with those in the Budget, will be<br />
worth $ 1200 million. And those tax cuts are based on a<br />
brand new scale designed to benefit the families most in need,<br />
the people most neglected in the past.<br />
At the same time we have pressed ahead with our great<br />
program of social reform and innovation. Our opponents have<br />
done their best to obstruct that program. You'll remember<br />
that last April they took the extreme step of blocking<br />
supply in the Senate cutting off our money. So we went to<br />
the people: and the people endorsed our program for the<br />
second time. You returned us to office. You put us back<br />
on the job. Already we have put many historic measures through<br />
Parliament. We have extended-the educational program we<br />
launched last year into the new area of technical education.<br />
We will be spending $ 100 million on technical and further education<br />
in the next two years.<br />
We have set up our Petroleum and Minerals Authority<br />
to help keep the ownership and control of our vast natural<br />
resources in Australian hands.<br />
We have opened the way for ordinary Australians to<br />
participate in our economic development through the A. I. D. C.<br />
and the National Investment Fund. </p>
<p>-2-<br />
We have given pensioners the biggest increase<br />
on record. We've got our child care program underway.<br />
We've got our health insurance legislation through<br />
an historic Joint Sitting of Parliament.<br />
We've tackled the vexed and difficult question of<br />
wage indexation to protect workers against inflation.<br />
We've brought in historic legislation against<br />
restrictive trade practices to ban price fixing and protect<br />
consumers. We've introduced our National Compensation Scheme<br />
to safeguard every working man and woman against injury or<br />
sickness, however caused.<br />
We've won new markets for our goods overseas and<br />
vastly increased our returns from the sale of our coal<br />
and iron ore. This year saw the opening of the first Australian<br />
Government Community Health Centre here in Victoria.<br />
It is one of 356 new health centres and other projects approved<br />
under Labor's community health and mental health programs.<br />
We are the first. Australian Government to recognise<br />
the needs of local councils. we approved grants this year<br />
of $ 56 million to help councils throughout Australia improve<br />
their services-and amenities.<br />
We have launched our plans for a vast national highway<br />
system and have set aside $ 1200 million for this purpose over<br />
the next three years.<br />
These are a few of the major initiatives we have<br />
taken this year in fulfilment of our program a program twice<br />
approved by the people. I am proud of all we have done. Our<br />
overriding purpose is to widen the opportunities and raise the<br />
living standards of every Australian. In 1974 we have come a<br />
long way towards achieving our goals. It has not been easy for<br />
US. It has not been easy for you. I look to all Australians,<br />
to all sections of the community and especially to Labor's<br />
traditional supporters for co-operation in carrying forward<br />
our great task in the years to come. </p>
