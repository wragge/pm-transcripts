OPENING OF JOHN McEWEN HOUSE<br />
CANBERRA, A. CT.<br />
Speech by the Prime Minister, Mr John Gorton 4 NOVEMBER 1968<br />
Mr Chairman, Mr Moss, John McEwen and Ladies and Gentlemen<br />
present: My task this afternoon is, I am told, to open the building<br />
officially, and I was told that I would be presented with a gold key<br />
when I arrived so that I could do it, but Mr Moss being a rather<br />
canny type of man, as I know from old, hasn't yet given it to me.<br />
I am putting him on warning that I will need it I don't mean to<br />
keep; I just mean to open the building.<br />
It is a compliment to me to be asked on this occasion<br />
to open this door, and it is a compliment for two reasons. Firstly,<br />
because this building is named after a man who has given to the<br />
national Parliament thirty-four years of service, a longer time than<br />
any sitting member except one has spent in the Federal Parliament.<br />
During that time, he has filled many important posts,<br />
becoming Deputy Leader of the Country Party in, I think, 1943, and<br />
Leadet in 1958, and who during the time he has filled those posts,<br />
has become known, I believe to all Australians of whatever political<br />
colour they may be, as one of the outstanding negotiators overseas<br />
for Australian products and the sale of Australian products and the<br />
arranging of agreements with other countries, all to the benefit<br />
of the producers of Australia.<br />
He has been Prime Minister. I think perhaps the only<br />
significant post he hasn't filled is that of External Affairs, and I<br />
am not at all sure that at some stage he might not have acted there.<br />
( Mr McEwen " I was Minister") You were Minister. All, right<br />
that's a full hand,<br />
He also has, during that period of time, become known<br />
to those of us closer to him not only as a highly successful farmer<br />
and practical farmer, but as a first-class colleague and a man to be<br />
trusted as a colleague, and as a great Australian.<br />
And so this house is named after him and in his honour.<br />
This is the first reason why I regard it as such a compliment to me<br />
to open it today. But there are other reasons. For some eighteen years<br />
now, the Liberal not Conservative but Liberal and Country Party<br />
coalition has given to Australia, I believe, enlightened government<br />
and government which has enabled progress, such as has not been<br />
seen in this nation before, to take place, a government which has<br />
taken account of the needs and aspirations of the individual citizens<br />
who make up the country. </p>
<p>-2<br />
Now it is not to be-supposed that-in that-period of eighteen<br />
years or in any other period of years there will not, from time to time,<br />
arise problems on which, in a coalition government, part of the<br />
government may have one view and part of the government may have<br />
another. This may inevitably occur in coalition governments, but given<br />
good will, given a discussion of these matters not on a caucus basis, but<br />
on a basis of individuals sitting around a table and expressing their<br />
judgmnents, th en these difficulties can be overcome.<br />
This. is unusual, I think, and it is a tribute to John McEwen, to<br />
the previous leaders of the Country Party, to the previous leaders of the<br />
Liberal Party that this has operated in this way and that both leaders and<br />
both parties have put what they believed to be the good of their country before<br />
their immediate aims on such occasions as any disagreement might arise.<br />
This is a way a joint government works, must wort-and will continue to<br />
work, given such men as have led our party and as have led the Country<br />
Party. After all, as I have just pointed out, there are a number of<br />
matters we have got in common. Mr Anthony said how the Country Party<br />
was dedicated to fighting for producers, not only producers of butter or<br />
wool or wheat, but also producers of machinery or oil or things from<br />
factories. Well that makes two parties dedicated to those ends, and with<br />
both of us on their side, they ought to get along all right! We have got<br />
that in common.* If the past is a prelude to the future, and I believe it is, then<br />
as a Liberal Prime Minister, it is good for me, and pleasing to me, to<br />
stand here to open this building, symbolising such a long and such a<br />
successful and such a progressive partnership and indicating that for the<br />
future what I believe will happen will happen . that that partnership<br />
will go on in the same way to the benefit of this nation of Australia.<br />
That does not mean that we both won't from time to time be contesting<br />
various seats against each other, but at least we will be contesting them<br />
with the same ultimate objective in mind and seeking to attain ultimately<br />
the same goal. That is the cement that h~ as bound us together and will<br />
continue to bind us together while we have such men as Sir Artrhur Fadden<br />
or John McEwen or Sir Robert Menzies or Mr Holt leading the sections of<br />
this coalition government which, starting as two sections, has become a<br />
whole, and I believe a whole for the good of this nation. </p>
