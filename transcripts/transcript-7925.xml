PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW WITH RADIO JOURNALISTS, SHERATON<br />
BRISBANE, 26 FEBRUARY 1990<br />
E 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, when did you find out about the<br />
New Zealand change of mind?<br />
PM: Well I must say that when I was in New Zealand the<br />
Prime Minister indicated to me that this was the likely<br />
outcome but he obviously didn't want me to say anything<br />
about it. I am particularly grateful at this change of<br />
position by New Zealand because it's not just another<br />
country but it is the country after whom the convention,<br />
the proposed convention is named, the Wellington<br />
Convention. I think if it's seen around the world now<br />
that New Zealand has come aboard with Australia and<br />
France that's going to have a very significant<br />
psychological impact and it gives me great encouragement,<br />
a feeling of pride that an initiative which in the<br />
beginning was regarded as mission impossible is now<br />
shaping up as one which will be accomplished. I think<br />
that the developments in the United States look very<br />
favourable. I think it's now unlikely that the United<br />
States will ratify and if that emerges then I think we're<br />
just about there.<br />
JOURNALIST: You made that point in the United States<br />
last year, that you expected the United States to come<br />
around but what are the developments in the Congress that<br />
are encouraging you?<br />
PM: Well, we have in Senator Gore a very, very strong<br />
supporter of our position. He is a man who is regarded<br />
very, very highly. He is getting around him and the<br />
others who are supporting him in the Congress, a very<br />
great deal of support. As is happening in the rest of<br />
the world, so does the United States that the<br />
environmental movement is pushing this issue very<br />
strongly and public opinion is growing and growing in<br />
support of us. I think the politicians in the United<br />
States, as they come up to the mid term elections, are<br />
going to be taking account of these considerations.<br />
After all, I don't think it requires very much<br />
imagination to see that it is, as I've continuously put<br />
it, an obscenity to take the risk of mining in the<br />
Antarctic. So intrinsically the position is strong and </p>
<p>2<br />
in terms of opinion growing up, I think the politicians<br />
are going to take notice of that.<br />
JOURNALIST: Since your last visit have you pursued it<br />
further with the President?<br />
PM: Indirectly and I have asked for my friend, Jacques<br />
Cousteau, who's going there shortly, to contact me after<br />
his visit. And in the light of what he writes to me,<br />
I've indicated that I'll make another approach then. it<br />
seemed to me to make sense to allow Jacques Cousteau to<br />
go there and use his influence. He'll be going to<br />
Washington and talking to people on the Hill and when I<br />
get a report from him I would on that basis, I think,<br />
contact the President.<br />
JOURNALIST: It was only a few months ago that New<br />
Zealand was saying the only way to stop mining was to<br />
keep the treaty and they were saying flatly that they<br />
would not accept the Australian position. Why this<br />
sudden change?<br />
PM: I think it shows the power of persuasion, doesn't<br />
it. JOURNALIST: If you were aware of it while you were over<br />
in New Zealand why announce it now? Does it deliberately<br />
coincide with the campaign?<br />
PM: No, no. Mr Palmer, as Prime Minister, was in a<br />
position where he'd come to the view that he thought when<br />
what I was arguing was correct. But he had to talk to<br />
his own Ministers, there are others there who had other<br />
views and he had to talk with them and persuade them so<br />
it was quite improper for me to jump the gun. As soon as<br />
he was able to get his Cabinet to the position of<br />
endorsing that he announced it.<br />
JOURNALIST: Is it an election coup for you though?<br />
PM: I don't know whether it's a coup but I certainly<br />
find it very, very satisfying but I think people would<br />
regard New Zealand as very important on this issue for<br />
the reasons I've put. It does give a very considerable<br />
momentum to our case, and that's the important thing<br />
rather than the election that we really do now look with<br />
a great deal of confidence in achieving that objective on<br />
which I set out last year and which, as I say, was<br />
regarded by many as mission impossible.<br />
JOURNALIST: If the treaty is abandoned what's the next<br />
phase to getting the whole area declared a wilderness<br />
reserve? PM: The next phase is the meeting later this year which<br />
was agreed on at the Paris meeting last year and that<br />
meeting will consider the next step and essentially on<br />
the basis of the Australia-French proposal. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: That's really the deadline in a sense,<br />
time's still running out for you.<br />
PM: I wouldn't say time was running out. I think time's<br />
running our way now. I really do believe time is running<br />
our way because the momentum is moving towards us. More<br />
and more countries are saying Australia's right. I think<br />
that there's no basis now for anyone saying, well the<br />
moratorium won't be respected. Of course it will be and<br />
that will give us time now to start at this meeting later<br />
this year, and I think more and more countries will come<br />
on board. I mean, the hard work will have to be done.<br />
The constructive work of saying alright we've spent all<br />
that time on CRAMRA now let's really do the sensible<br />
thing. It was not sensible in my judgement, it wasn't<br />
logical to be talking about saving the environment and<br />
saving the Antarctic from mining via a minerals<br />
convention. It didn't' make any sense. Now the sensible<br />
thing is to start working out an effective, constructive<br />
way of protecting the environment, making it a world<br />
nature reserve by a comprehensive environmental<br />
convention. JOURNALIST: But is there a timetable on that when you'd<br />
like to see the reserve?<br />
PM: Well the sooner the better. But the important thing<br />
is that if the mind of the majority of nations is for<br />
that objective then we know that there will be no mining<br />
while that is being done and we'll have the time then to<br />
make sure that all our best resources are put in to<br />
creating the most effective, comprehensive convention.<br />
The important thing is that if the mind is there for that<br />
objective then nothing will happen in the meantime and<br />
it'll give us whatever amount of time is required to get<br />
an effective outcome.<br />
ends </p>
