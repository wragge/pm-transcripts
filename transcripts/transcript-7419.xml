    <content><![CDATA[<p><br />Â 26 OCTOBER 1988</p>
<p><br />I am delighted that the Greek Prime Minister, Mr AndreasÂ Papandreou, in response to a request from me, has decidedÂ that the priceless golden wreath from the Royal Tombs ofÂ Vergina will be included in the exhibition of treasures from<br />Ancient Macedonia to come to Australia.</p>
<p><br />The exhibition, to be opened by the President of Greece,Â Mr Sartzetakis, on 24 November at the Museum of Victoria in<br />Melbourne, is a major contribution to our Bicentenary from<br />the Government of Greece. I welcome Mr Papandreou'sÂ decision which reflects the importance of the friendly<br />relations between our two countries.</p>
<p><br />The exhibition of Macedonian antiquities, the largest and<br />most comprehensive ever to leave Greece, will give thousands<br />of Australians a rare insight into the culture of Ancient<br />Macedonia, one of the well-springs of western civilisation.<br />It covers the rich cultural heritage of Ancient Macedonia<br />over 4000 years from Neolithic times to the reigns of King<br />Philip and his son Alexander the Great and the RomanÂ conquest of 197 B. C.</p>
<p><br />The addition of the golden wreath will give added lustre toÂ this magnificent exhibition and heighten its appeal toÂ scholars, students, and the general public. 296 3</p>
