F77/ 148EMBARGO: AGAINST DELIVERY<br />
PRWME MIN ISTER<br />
FOR PRESS 13 July 1977<br />
ADDRESS TO THE NATIONAL PRESS CLUB<br />
It is very good to be able to address the National Press Club<br />
again. A July appearance at the Canberra coliseum has become an<br />
established a very productive part of my schedule.<br />
When I addressed this Club in July 1975, 1 outlined a basic<br />
philosophy for putting Australia back on the road to recovery,<br />
and for restoring individual liberties and incentives eroded<br />
by the public sector's increase in power and size. The Government<br />
was elected later that year on a far ranging programme of responsible<br />
Liberal reform which sought to put this philosophy into practice.<br />
In my speech here in July last year, I summarised the principal<br />
objectives of that programme they were: cutting government<br />
spending and freeing resources to individuals and business<br />
enterprise; providing incentives to investment; making governments<br />
more responsible; protecting individuals against unlegislated<br />
taxes on their earnings; helping those in need; and protecting<br />
individual rights against an increasingly powerful and intrusive<br />
state. The half-way mark has now been reached in the first term of this<br />
government. This period has been one of real achievement in respect<br />
of each one of the objectives to which I referred last year.<br />
Government spending has been brought under control, and the<br />
spiralling growth of the Commonwealth Public Service has been<br />
reversed. This has helped to restore confidence and impetus<br />
in the private sector and has played a major role in our<br />
unremitting fight against inflation.<br />
Inflation has hurt us all and as the. Henderson Report revealedit<br />
hurt none so hard as the poor and the least privileged.<br />
Australians recognise that getting inflation firmly under control<br />
is vital to our future and that to do this, government spending<br />
must be tightly controlled. Our anti-inflationary policies have<br />
been notably successful. The C. P. I. figures issued in April<br />
showed that the annual inflation rate, after adjusting for<br />
Medibank, had fallen in just one year from almost 17% to<br />
we will reduce inflation further. ./ 2 </p>
<p>To hasten recovery and revive the private sector, we introduced<br />
a generous investment allowance and other tax reforms. Changes<br />
in the financial relations between the Commonwealth and the<br />
states which will make Governments responsible for<br />
their actions, are well advanced.<br />
For individuals our promise of tax indexation has been introducednot<br />
in three years but in one. This is an historic reform,<br />
it caused a rise in everyone's paypacket last week, and will<br />
ensure that any government which wishes to increase income tax<br />
must legislate to do so. Even Labor has now belatedly endorsed<br />
this reform.<br />
In social welfare, assistance has been directed to those most<br />
in need and has increased choice and individual self respect.<br />
There is no better example of this than the Family Allowance Sche*<br />
The indexation of pensions is also a significant advance, and<br />
another-* of our reforms which Labor has now endorsed in principle.<br />
We have vigorously protected individual rights against the<br />
bureaucracy. Some of the things we have done in just 18<br />
include: appointing the first Ombudsman; bringing in legislation<br />
to establish a Human Rights Commission; commencing the work of<br />
the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and expanding its<br />
jursidiction; giving every citizen the right to require that reasons<br />
be given for any administrative decision which adversely affects<br />
him; introducing legislation defining the powers of the<br />
Commonwealth Police in criminal investigation; and, rationalising and<br />
improving the delivery of legal aid.<br />
We are moving to introduce Freedom of Information legislation<br />
and to confer greater political rights on the citizens of the<br />
A. C. T. and the Northern Territory.<br />
This record of reform and I pay due tribute to the<br />
Attorney-General, Bob Ellicott singles out this government as the<br />
greatest Liberal reforming government since Federation.<br />
These reforms have been introduced without fuss, without controversy<br />
and have largely gone unnoticed. Yet I believe they constitute<br />
an historic achievement of which this government can rightly<br />
feel proud.<br />
In industrial relations we have moved to further protect rights<br />
of individual unionists, notably by the introduction of secret<br />
postal ballots.<br />
Lastly, and this is not an unimportant consideration, we have<br />
established an efficient and better coordinated government. But<br />
there are still significant problems in our society. There is<br />
still much to be done. / 3 </p>
<p>Unemployment is of the greatest concern. The present level of<br />
unemployment is unacceptably high. Unemployment, for those who<br />
genuinely desire employment, is a dispiriting and wasteful<br />
experience which undermines self-respect. The Government has<br />
implemented a number of innovative schemes to alleviate<br />
unemployment, and the results have been encouraging. The<br />
Community Youth Support Scheme imparts basic skills to some<br />
15,000 young people under 118 separate programmes.<br />
The National Employment Training Scheme ( or NEAT) has been<br />
expanded to cover 18,000 people three quarters of whom have<br />
found a job at the end of their term under the Scheme.<br />
NEAT's special youth employment training programme is particularly<br />
successful. It subsidises employers to hire young people who<br />
have been unemployed for a lengthy period of time. Over 70% of<br />
them retain their job when the subsidy expires.<br />
The " CRAFT" scheme for promoting apprenticeships<br />
has also been a notable success. It now covers over 35,000<br />
apprentices and since its introduction, there has been a rise of<br />
more than six percent in apprenticeships throughout Australia.<br />
Relocation assistance is paid to those who have to move to<br />
another area to obtain employment. The total cost of all these<br />
schemes in the year just ended was over $ 83 million.<br />
The Government has also commissioned the Norgard Inquiry into the<br />
Commonwealth Employment Service, to see whether more effective<br />
methods of serving the unemployed might be devised.<br />
The Report is now before the Government. It recommends a<br />
major overhaul of the C. E. S. and suggests many ways in which<br />
the operations of the C. E. S. might be improved. Among the major<br />
recommendations are: that the management of C. E. S. should<br />
be vested in a statutory authority solely concerned with<br />
employment and manpower matters; that other activities such as<br />
administering unemployment benefits and collecting labor<br />
market statistics should be conducted by the<br />
Department of Social Security and the Bureau of Statistics<br />
respectively; and the C. E. S. operations should be reorganised.<br />
Mr Norgard has recommended that an immediate start should be<br />
made on the introduction of computer assisted job matching;<br />
that the placement function should be reorganised into a three tier<br />
service in recognition that not all job seekers require the same<br />
level of service a self-help service, a counselling service<br />
for those with labour market problems, and specialised help for'<br />
those who are significantly disadvanta~ ed; that counselling<br />
and guidance services should be greatly improved to assist<br />
special groups of job seekers who could be expected to find<br />
job seeking difficult.<br />
The Government has already agreed to a significant upgrading<br />
of the staff and facilities of C. E. S. offices on the basis of<br />
Mr Norgard's preliminary findings, and we shall be considering<br />
shortly what further action is required in the light of<br />
the findings of Mr Norgard. 4 </p>
<p>Aprime cause of the unemployment problem, is, quite bluntly,<br />
w age awards which have priced many people out of the labour<br />
market. We have not yet recovered from the wages explosion<br />
of 1974 when real male award wages rose by 17%. In money<br />
terms they increased from $ 77 to $ 104. Over the same period<br />
real female award wages rose in money terms from<br />
$ 63 to $ 90. This may be compared to an average annual<br />
increase over the previous decade of under three percent in real awar
As profits and investment declined, employers sought further<br />
means to minimise their work force. It is a cruel irony that<br />
the 1974 awards which appeared so favourable to the Australian worker<br />
have in fact provded to be the harshest weapon ainst him.<br />
Because of the high price of labour, employers-awrreluctant<br />
to take on more employees even when their sales increase.<br />
They prefer to purchase more labour saving machines. Excessive<br />
wages impeded economic recovery and reduce employment opportunities.<br />
This situation calls for a responsible attitude towards wage<br />
increases by union leaders. In the present economic environment J<br />
one man's wage increase is another man's job.<br />
Another cause of unemployment in far too many cases is industrial<br />
disputes. In our major export based mineral projects, stoppages<br />
are having a most damaging effect. The industrial record<br />
in the Pilbara is appalling, an average of over one strike a<br />
week. The dispute between the Seaman's Union and the Utah Company<br />
in Queensland has led directly to the suspension of the<br />
$ 250 million development at Norwich Park. </p>
<p>The management company has had to postpone conclusion of subcontracts<br />
and employment has been seriously affected. The same<br />
could happen to other major developments which should play an<br />
important role in our economic recovery.<br />
It has been estimated that the use of Australian-manned ships<br />
would increase the cost of freight for coal by 60-80%. The<br />
demands of the Seamans Union clearly have grave implications<br />
for the coal and iron ore industries which must maintain<br />
competitive ' Drices to secure and maintain overseas sales contracts.<br />
Mr. Nixon and Mr. Street will be reporting to me on these matters<br />
I have asked the Premiers of New South Wales, Queensland,<br />
and Western Australia to meet with me. We will be meeting<br />
on Friday. Labor, as we all remember, was in government less<br />
than two years ago. How did they see the morality of uranium<br />
mining and export when they were responsible for their actions?<br />
on 31 October 1974, the Minister for Minerals and Energy said<br />
that Australia " will ensure that our major trading partners<br />
Japan, Italy, and West Germany obtain an equitable share of<br />
the uranium we have for export." In October 1975, the then Minister<br />
for Aboriginal Affairs stated in the House " International<br />
assurances have been provided by Ministers that Australia will<br />
meet the uranium requirements of our major trading partners which<br />
could amount to about 100,000 tons of uranium". In March 1975,<br />
the then Deputy Prime Minister, Dr. Cairns, and the Minister for<br />
Agriculture, Senator Wriedt, visited Iran. At the end of their<br />
visit, they issued a joint statement with Iran that " Iran would<br />
be given access to supplies of uranium from Australia under<br />
favourable conditions".<br />
In the Parliament on 2 June 1975 the present Shadow Minister for<br />
Minerals and Energy, Mr. Keating, said " Japan is interested in<br />
moving into nuclear power and enriched fuel. We are prepared<br />
to give the Japanese any amount of fuel that they need, enriched<br />
if we can do so". " The only thing is that we would like to do<br />
the enriching. Instead of sending just yellowcake at bargainbasement<br />
prices, we want to get the profit that comes from<br />
enrichment." At Terrigal in June 1975, the ALP Conference<br />
resolved to develop Australia's uranium resources, and build a<br />
uranium enrichment plant. At that Conference, a motion was<br />
proposed that there should be a twelve month ban on uranium<br />
development, while a full scale Government inquiry into the<br />
problems of nuclear technology was conducted. Mr. Whitlam<br />
flatly opposed the motion, because, he said, it would jeopardise<br />
Australia's credibility and delay the negotiations his government<br />
was conducting for the sale of uranium to Europe. He also said<br />
that Australia had done all it could to see other countries<br />
adhered to the IAEA safeguards.<br />
Ultimately, only four Victorians supported the call for a<br />
moratorium. Where was the Deputy Leader of the Opposition then<br />
hiding his moral scruples under his We all know where<br />
one of the advocates of the indefinite moratorium the Premier<br />
of South Australia was. He was promoting the establishment of<br />
a uranium enrichment plant in South Australia. The only problem<br />
/ he </p>
<p>-6<br />
he could see with respect to uranium was whether South Australia's<br />
water supply was adequate for the enrichment plant. One final<br />
fact on November 28, 1975, Mr. Whitlam and representatives of<br />
Peko Mines and the Electrolytic Zinc Company signed a memorandum<br />
of understanding between the Government and the companies for the<br />
development and mining of uranium ore deposits in the Ranger area<br />
in the Northern Territory, and for the production and sale of<br />
uranium concentrate from that ore.<br />
M~ r. Ehitlam's press statement announcing the umemorandum, said:<br />
" The Government believes that the Ranger project can be a major<br />
export earner and it will be working with Peko and EZ to bring<br />
this-fully Australian mining project to fruition." Those who<br />
speak about the morality of the decision should ask themselves:<br />
T~ what morality is there ia resolution that takes the unprecedented<br />
step of declaring that any contracts entered into by-* anon-Labor-<br />
Government would be repudiated? What morality is.-there in a<br />
resolution that pays absolutely no heed to the ' world's need for<br />
energy resources? What morality is there in a resolution that<br />
does not look at its consequences for-other nations? What morality<br />
is there in a resolution that ignores that one of its consequences<br />
would be an accelerated move to the plutonilm economy? What morality<br />
is there in a resolution on which the ALP's' leading figures refuse*<br />
to even speak despite their reservations?<br />
There was no reference in the Labor Party resolution to the energy<br />
needs of other nations. Mr. Dunstan, outside the Conference,<br />
summed up Japan's needs very well. Japan, he said " does not have<br />
an alternative energy technology to the development of nuclear power"<br />
But he showed no sign of concern about this no interest in the<br />
impact of this on the Japanese people and Japanese society. He<br />
only referred to the grave economic consequences to Australia of<br />
refusing to sell uranium to Japan.<br />
Our decision, however, does not only affect us. It affects other@<br />
nations. Its impact on them must be considered. It affects the<br />
nations of Europe who are short of energy supplies. It affects<br />
the future development of the third world. Moral issues deserve<br />
debate, positions need to be put, their consequences assessed.<br />
Mr. Hawke made some pertinent observations on this issue. He said<br />
he was not convinced as a matter of intellectual integrity of the<br />
arguments for leaving uranium in the ground. He said a decision<br />
against mining would not " do anything about the dangers, the<br />
disposal of nuclear waste, about terrorists acquiring weapons."<br />
It could lead to an increase in the price of energy and to the<br />
cost of living in developed and developing countries.<br />
These were important observations which should have been argued<br />
out. Mr. Hawke, Mr. Hayden and Mr. Whitlam sat mute during the<br />
Conference debate. They were the very people who had an obligation<br />
as leaders or aspiring leaders to discuss the issues. Their words<br />
were uttered before and after the resolution was discussed and<br />
adopted not during it. It was not pure hearts and simple minds<br />
that caused the resolution to be carried, but a cynical political<br />
/ deal </p>
<p>-7<br />
deal in which the major opponents of the resolution kept quiet<br />
* during the debate and spoke up later.<br />
The Government of Australia has cornr-tenced its consideration of the<br />
desirability of uranium mining and export, and the many other issues<br />
raised by the Fox Report. We have al * ready announced that if<br />
uranium is permitted to be exported, the most stringent set of<br />
safeguards will be applied, both through compliance with the<br />
requirements of the International Atomic Energy Agency and through<br />
bilateral agreements between Australia and each user-country.<br />
Mr. Whitlam in the House on 29 March in a debate on uranium, laid<br />
down a set of safeguards which he argued should be applied to<br />
uranium exports. The Government's Safeguards Policy encompasses<br />
all Mr. Whitlam's requirements and indeed goes beyond them in many<br />
respects, particularly as regards eligibility of customers and<br />
added safeguards to be contained in the bilateral agreements.<br />
We do not simply have to make one fundamental yes or no decision.<br />
SA whole range of inter-related decisions are required which affect<br />
V not only Australians but people throughout the world.<br />
Let me mention just some of the issues involved. We must consider:<br />
the adequacy of international safeguards to prevent nuclear<br />
proliferation; our obligations under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation<br />
V Treaty, and particularly Article Four of that Treaty; the problem<br />
of the disposal of nuclear wastes and the fact that the reliable<br />
supplies of Australian uranium can defer the move to the plutonium<br />
economy, a deferral which would provide greater time for an<br />
international solution to be found for effective controls on the<br />
hazards of plutonium and high level waste; the urgency of the<br />
world's needs for uranium supplies to provide energy and the<br />
ethical question of whether we are entitled to withhold them; the<br />
world tension which would be created if we refused to supply uranium;<br />
our reputation as a stable and assured supplier of natural resources;<br />
the effect mining will have on aboriginal communities and all<br />
other Australians living near minesites; the appropriate boundaries<br />
of national parks near minesites; the impact of mining on our economy<br />
particularly on our foreign reserves, on unemployment, and on the<br />
economy of the Northern Territory; the proper regulation of mining<br />
if it is to be permitted, including its effect on the environment.<br />
Above all, we must consider the impact of our decisions, not only on<br />
ourselves, but on our children, and future generations.<br />
We spent most of yesterday's Cabinet discussing environmental issues,<br />
and the possible impact of mining on the aboriginal people.<br />
These are fundamental issues, and no decision will be made on<br />
mining until we are absolutely satisfied that the needs and<br />
interests of the aboriginal people are safeguarded, and that the<br />
environment is fully protected.<br />
Our deliberations are continuing. Decisions of this importance<br />
will not be decided overnight, nor should they. But when we have<br />
finally reached our conclusions, they will form a proper and<br />
considered response to all these inter-related and complex issues. </p>
