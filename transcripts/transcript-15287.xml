<p>Good Morning,</p>
<p>The Government's overriding economic goal over the past 11 years has been to ensure that low-income people get a fair share of our national prosperity. New figures show that our policies have been doing just that.</p>
<p>The latest Australian Bureau of Statistics figures reveal that the Government's tax and welfare systems are redistributing our wealth in favour of low income earners.</p>
<p>It shows that only the top 40 per cent of Australian households are paying net tax after the value of all government benefits are counted. </p>
<p>That means average households receive more in government benefits than they pay in tax.</p>
<p>When I announced the Family Tax Initiative policy just prior to the 1996 election, I had in mind a tax system that would give low-income families a fairer share of our nation's wealth, and we have kept faith with that promise.</p>
<p>This has not been a rich man's government; this has been a government for the battlers of this country.  </p>
<p>It is a government that will continue to ensure our prosperity is shared throughout the community.</p>
<p>Our economy is performing strongly and the Government's policies are ensuring that our prosperity is being shared. A Rudd Labor Government would put all of that at risk.</p>
<p>[ends]  </p>
