PRIME MINISTER'S PRESS CONFERENCE j<br />
PARLIAMENT HOUSE, CANBErRRA<br />
TUIE-TrhAY, 18 ? V PCI 1975<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Ladies and gentlemen, I understand that Mr<br />
Bjelke-Petersen the Premier of Queensland, has claimed credit<br />
for the sales of beef to Japan which I announced yesterday.<br />
I should e'xplain that I instructed the Secretary of the Department<br />
of Foreign Affairs, Mr Renouf, to raise this matter with<br />
the Japanese Ambassador in Canberra on Saturday.<br />
Over the last twelve months the Australian Government<br />
has mounted a major effort to have the Japanese re-open their<br />
beef market. Soon after imports were cut-in February last<br />
year representations to Japanese officials and consultations<br />
with them began. A formal Aide-Memoire protesting at the<br />
action taken was lodged on 14 June after the ban was formally<br />
imposed. in July a high level delegation led by Dr Harris,<br />
then Deputy Secretary of the Department of Overseas Trade,<br />
with senior industry representatives including the Chairman<br />
of the Meat Board, Niisited Tokyo. Follow-up discussions with<br />
Japanese officials took place in Canberra at the time of the<br />
joint Agriculture talks in August last year with the Secretary<br />
of the Department of Overseas Trade leading for the Australian side.<br />
The Minister for Agriculture, Senator Wriedt, pressed<br />
the matter with senior Japanese ministers during a visit to<br />
Tokyo to discuss the supply of Australian primary products to<br />
Japan, that was on the 10 of October last year. In the same<br />
month, at the special meeting convened in Washington on<br />
Australian initiative to discuss the world beef crisis and to<br />
launch its proposal for an International Meat Consultative Group<br />
( since successfully established in the GATT), the Japanese<br />
were again pressed to re-open the market, that was on the 18th<br />
of October. The matter arose in discussions between Prime Minister4<br />
Tanaka and me on 1st of November. The Japanese were yet again<br />
strongly urged to re-open the market.<br />
As you know, the Queensland Premier has tried to<br />
indulge in his own form of resources black-mail on this issue<br />
threatening not to permit coal deposits in his State being exported<br />
to Japan. He, of course, has no power in thi * s issue which the<br />
Australian Constitution specifically provides is within the<br />
power of the Australian Government and the Australian Parliament.<br />
The Qucenslafid Minister for Agriculture was in.<br />
Japan recently and has been negotiating with the Japanese<br />
on some issues concerning the Queensland Government. However,<br />
the Minister, Mr Sullivan assured the Australian Embassy that<br />
he had no intention of seeking to negotiate on the beef issue.<br />
It is nonsense for Mr Bjelke-Petersen to suggest<br />
that his black-mail rather than our serious and consistent<br />
negotiations have caused a change in the Japanese attitude on<br />
this issue. Unlike Mr Bjelke-Petersen we are interested in<br />
results rather than in grand-standing. </p>
<p>-2-<br />
QUESTION: The Country Party leader, Mr Anthony today called on<br />
the Government to protest to thco North Vietnamese about the death<br />
of Mr Graham Lewis. Have you done so, and do you intend to?<br />
P19IME MINISTER: I haven't.<br />
QUESTION: Has there been any progress or contact with the PRG<br />
on the question of setting up an Information office in Australia?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: There was an approach through the North Vietnamese<br />
and we said that any office in Australia would be along the lines<br />
of those established in Scandinavia.<br />
C-FSTION: Since late December there has not been a single petroleum<br />
explcyration well drilled on land in Australia. This level of<br />
zero being the worst for more than twenty years. How do you<br />
reconcile this with Australias pressing future needs for oil<br />
supplies? PRIME MINISTER: The people who have been exploring in* Australia<br />
for oil, of course explore in many parts of the world. They have<br />
thought that the prospect of finding oil on land where greater<br />
in other parts of the world.<br />
QUESTION: I understand that Mr Renouf also talked about the Nara<br />
Treaty with the Japanese Ambassador at the weekend. Could you<br />
say or could you outline the state of negotiations on that treaty<br />
and would you say that it is, in jeopardy at the moment because<br />
of the stalemate?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: The negotiations have been temporarily suspended<br />
while we wait for further clarification of the Japanese position<br />
on a technical and legal point. When we receive this clarification<br />
and if it meets our position, we expect the talks will 1? e<br />
resumed and quickly concluded.<br />
QUESTION: Can you tell us why you have not protested against<br />
to the Vietnam Government over the death of Mr Lewis?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: It's not clear who destroyed the plane. I am not<br />
going to assume and I don't suppose anybody is in a position<br />
to assume that it was the North Vietnamese the Viet Cong or the.<br />
South Vietnamese. There is no information on it.<br />
QUESTION: Are inquiries being made?<br />
PRIME MINISTER! I think inquiries are being made, yes.<br />
QUESTION: On the Nara Treaty again could you say what exactly<br />
the hold up is, the particular clauses which are in dispute between<br />
the Australian Government and the Japanese Government?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No, no I won't go into details on this. It is a<br />
technical, narrow matter.<br />
QUESTION: They don't concern Japanese ownership * of minerals and<br />
resources in Australia?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No, that's not the precise issue. I </p>
<p>QUESTION: Mr Stirn a French Government Minister said yesterday<br />
that if it was possible there would be further atmospheric<br />
nuclear tests in the Pacific. Would you comment on that?<br />
PR. IME MINISTER: I saw a report to that effect. I had an hour<br />
with him this afternoon he said nothing of the sort.<br />
QUESTION': Senator Wheeldon announced that he had written to the<br />
Federal Executive of the ALP asking them to take action against<br />
Mr Bill Hartley over the PLO. Do you intend to support<br />
Senator Wheeldon in that action?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: This is a matter which w ' ill come Pefore the<br />
Federal Executive, so I suppose I ) would have to express a view<br />
in that body when I hear the facts. You wouldn't expect me<br />
to pr !-judge the matter.<br />
QUESTION: What priority do you place on re-establishing the<br />
Australian Embassy in Phnom Penh? I just wondering, not'when,<br />
but in what circumstances would it be re-established?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: When Phnom Penh is safe.<br />
QUESTION: fugardless of what government?<br />
, PRIME MINISTER: Of course. We have made our attitude clear all<br />
along, for over two years. That we will have diplomatic relations<br />
with whatever government is installed in the Capital of Cambodia.<br />
We have relations with the Lon Nol Government. Our diplomats<br />
have been withdrawn because there was no sufficient Australian<br />
interest to justify their being in jeopardy in Phnom Penh at<br />
this time. And that attitude has been adopted by most other<br />
countries which had diplomats still in Phnom Penh. We don't<br />
believe that Australian lives should be jeopardised in the<br />
circumstances there at this time.<br />
QUESTION: Are you concerned that a possible change of Opposit~ in<br />
leadership might open threats of an early election?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I don't know what the attitude of any of the<br />
suggested contenders is on this matter. I find it difficult<br />
to keep track of the attitude that Mr Snedden has expressed<br />
from time to time on it. Indeed from week to week or day to day.<br />
I got, the very distinct message, three or four weeks ago, that<br />
he was challenging me, he was going to put me to the jump on<br />
thi4s question of having a refusal of Supply and an election.<br />
As I understand. he's changed his mind and guaranteed that there<br />
will not be a refusal of Supply in the middle of this year.<br />
I don't know what his guarantees are worth in this respect. I don't<br />
remember any of the other contenders, any of the people who go<br />
to these social gatherings on Sunday night, have said about this<br />
matter. But of course the whole question is that it is the<br />
Country Party which) in season and out of season, has said that<br />
there should be a refusal of Supply. It first said that you<br />
might remember in September 1973.1 And then six or seven months<br />
later Mir Snedden agreed. Despite the fact that we won the election<br />
and the coalition lost the election last May, thelte have again<br />
been these threats. They were being bandied abroad in October<br />
last year, they were being bandied about in February </p>
<p>-4-<br />
and March this year. Perhaps its well to recall that at the<br />
election during the campaign last May neither side said<br />
that if it failed to get a majority in the House of Representatives<br />
it would use an evenly divided Senate to refuse Supply to the<br />
s ide which got a majority in the House of Representatives.<br />
I never said that if we only broke even in the Senate but didn't<br />
have a majority still in the House of Representatives that we<br />
would be using the evenly divided Senate to reject money bills.<br />
Nor in fact did Mr Snedden. Nor in fact did Mr Anthony at that<br />
time. But we all know what Mr Anthony's game is. He's bullying<br />
Mr Snedden, who has shown on many occasions in Government and<br />
in opposition that he will bow to Country Party pressure.<br />
I'm told that Mr Fraser would do it more. discreetly. Hle would<br />
i the arrangement with Mr Anthony in advance, that is they<br />
would confer on a joint attitude, the Country Party attitude<br />
would prevail but it would be done more decently, between<br />
gentlemen rather than delivering an ultimatum publicly to<br />
Mr Snedden who then after some hesitation would fall into line.<br />
QUESTION: If there was a change in Opposition leadership who<br />
would you see as a greater threat to you in the Parliament?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I'm not going to come in on that. I'm quite<br />
satisfied with the present leadership of the Opposition. I think<br />
I express the view of my party in that respect.<br />
QUESTION: How do you react Sir to statements by Mr Nixon of the<br />
Country Party, that you are shielding Professor-Downing of the<br />
ABC, for what he calls'inadequacies'i and from his statement<br />
that thereare too many " pinkies" and even out and out socialists<br />
in key positions in the ABC?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: You come from one branch of the ABC? I don't<br />
won't to do anything to jeopardise your position. What. has<br />
Mr Nixon made another statement on this? Well quite frankly<br />
I've got bigger fish to fry or to toast at this-moment than<br />
Mr Nixon. I gather that Mr Nixon's original complaint was that<br />
some ABC newscasts had referred to forces opposing the government<br />
in South Vietnam or Cambodia. And Mr Nixon said that the ABC<br />
should have said they were communists. I would have thought that<br />
even Mr Nixon would know that its not only communists who are up<br />
in arms against the government in Saigon and in Phnom Penh. These<br />
simplifications do nobody any good at all. We suffered from that<br />
sort of simplication too long. Sure its a better headline, single<br />
word always is and particularly if it can Le abbreviated. But<br />
there are very many elements including communists who are opposed<br />
to the present regimes in Phnom Penh and in Saigon. I saw nothing<br />
inaccurate in what the ABC said,, nothing objectionable and in most<br />
countries nowadays this wouldn't have been regarded as inaccurate<br />
or objectionable.<br />
QOESTION: Mr Whitlam, Alan Thornhill, Sydney Morning Herald,<br />
Mr Bjelke-Petersen suggests that you have his phone tapped,<br />
whether jokingly or not, do you?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No, I can give you an unqualified assurance.<br />
I've never heard of the suggestion before.<br />
Incidentally, i've just been passed a note.<br />
Our Embassy in Tokyo has been in contact with the Japanese </p>
<p>department concerned, which cannot recall a telephone call from<br />
Queensland oi,, 1ecf.<br />
Perhaps I might mention, for the benefit of the record.<br />
It would be well known to all you Ladies and Gentlemen, what<br />
is the niain spring of the Country Party's stirring on this<br />
question of an election. For entirely selfish and internal<br />
reasons one can expect that the Opposition, whoever the leader<br />
of it may be, would continue to agitate for an early election.<br />
We were elected for three years, they sought to be election<br />
for three years, we succeeded, they failed. Now, , there can be<br />
no question that the public expects us to get on with the job,<br />
unimpeded, uninterrupted, for that three years. But the<br />
Country Party is constantly agitating on this question, and<br />
bullying Mr Snedden and any other Liberal leaders or aspirants<br />
who will yield to their bullying because they want another<br />
election on the present boundaries.<br />
Particularly, in the three largest States the<br />
boundaries-are quite unacceptable. In New South Wales, in<br />
Victoria, in Queensland, in each case there are some electorates<br />
which now have more than 80,000 people on the roles, and there<br />
are others which have fewer than 50,000 people on the roles.<br />
In New South Wales, Mitchell has an enrolment, at the end of<br />
last December of 82,700, Robertson of 81,000; on the other<br />
hand, Hume has an enrolment of 49,800, and Darling an<br />
enrolment of 46,600. In Victoria, Diamond Valley at the end<br />
of December, had an enrolment of 86,000, Bourke 83,200; on<br />
the other hand Malley had an enrolment of 49,600, Wimmera of<br />
49,100. In Queensland, Macpherson had an enrolment of<br />
93,100, another seat Maranoa had fewer than half that number,<br />
46,300. There was another seat in Queensland with an enrolment<br />
of 80,400, Bowman, and other one with an enrolment of 51,000,<br />
Kennedy. Now I don't think that Australian democracy should<br />
have to suffer such great disparity of numbers.. The Country<br />
Party believe that those niumbers suit them; but I don't believe<br />
that the Labor Party, or any self-respecting Liberals should<br />
accept such a distortion of the democratic process in Australia.<br />
The new distributions which have been put to the Parliament<br />
provide that instead of there being a disparity of over 30,000<br />
or even 40,000 between electorates in the three largest States,<br />
in no case will tbere be a disparity of more than 5 or 6,000.<br />
The electorates which are under the quota, are the growing ones;<br />
the ones that are over the quota. on the new distribution proposals<br />
are the ones which are static in population. That's the-. whole<br />
objective of the Country Party, the present system suits them,<br />
but it doesn't suit the other parties in the Parliament, nor<br />
of course, should it suit electors in general. </p>
