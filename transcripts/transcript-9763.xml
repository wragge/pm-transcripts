PRIME MINISTER 104/ 95<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON PJ KEATING MP<br />
DEBT TRICK<br />
Mr Howard's launch today of his so called Debt Truck makes it clear that<br />
there will be no room for truth in the Coalition's election strategy.<br />
It is outright dishonesty for Mr Howard to praise the Australian investment<br />
environment in the morning and then undermine it in the afternoon with a<br />
cheap and misleading stunt.<br />
This morning Mr Howard said that " any potential overseas investor couldn't<br />
do other than look upon Australia as a place where continuing long-term<br />
foreign investment remains extremely attractive."<br />
To then continue with his cynical Chicken Little scare campaign shows that<br />
Mr Howard stands for nothing and will try any trick to slip into office.<br />
Today's stunt is part of Mr Howard's broader scheme to deceive the<br />
Australian people into believing that foreign debt is owed personally by them.<br />
Mr Howard may deny this, but his endorsement of Senator Winston Crane's<br />
campaign of lies in sending fake foreign debt invoices to his constituents is<br />
proof of his complicity.<br />
Despite knowing full well that the bulk of foreign debt is owed by private<br />
companies he is prepared to back Senator Crane's deceit.<br />
Mr Howard last month made a distinction between " telling the truth" and<br />
" campaign hyperbole" today's dishonesty from the Opposition Leader<br />
illustrates his point.<br />
