ESSENDON RALLY<br />
in just three days, the men and women of. Australia will make a<br />
decision about our great country's destiny. The alternatives are<br />
clear. Will you reject Labor's policies of futility and fear.<br />
Will you choose our policies of growth and confidence our policies<br />
of success. Our country is poised to move into the 80s and beyond<br />
with new hope, new spirit and a new sense of security. We are now<br />
a nation of many cultures, many rich traditions a nation to which<br />
people from all over the world have contributed. We face the<br />
future with a new sense of purpose, of rekindled pride.<br />
The first stage of the job this Government was elected to do<br />
is complete. We are now ready to move into a new era of<br />
prosperity and development. Our achievements have matched<br />
our prqmises. We promised to reduce Labor's inflation.<br />
Inflation is down to and it is falling.<br />
We promised to control Government spending. We have already<br />
halved. Labor's $ 4,500 million deficit. We promised to revive<br />
incentive, restore fair reward for achievement. We have<br />
-substantially cut every Australian's taxes. It is now<br />
worth working overtime again.<br />
We promised to get Australia moving again. Industry is investing<br />
again. our natural resources are being developed again, and<br />
there is new confidence in our manufacturing industry.<br />
$ 6,000 million worth of firmly committed projects are under<br />
way or ready to go. Many billions of dollars more are in the.<br />
pipeline. Udra Liberal Government Australia's vast-potential will be<br />
~ realised.. we alone have the-. polic'ies which will keep our<br />
country grow3ing."* Polidles. which'are successful, which -will<br />
* create new jobs.<br />
We will reduce inflation to between six and eight per cent by<br />
next June. we will keep industry investing. We will keep<br />
interest rates falling. Over the next twelve months they<br />
will fall by up to two per cent. That will save the average..<br />
young couple buying a new.-home $ 520 a year, $ 10 a week.<br />
We have got the real answer to unemployment. Investment 7 that<br />
means jobs; getting interest rates down that means jobs;<br />
restraining Government expenditure that means jobs. / Becau' 56<br />
F77/ 295 /. Z </p>
<p>necause we have held back Government spending, we have been<br />
able to cut taxes for every Australian. We have already<br />
stopped Labor's tax ripoff by indexing taxes, and in just<br />
seven weeks our new tax cuts start. Because we have reduced<br />
inflation, these tax cuts will create more jobs. Because<br />
people can spend more, our factories will have to produce<br />
more. There will be a demand for more employees. We have<br />
set up training and job assistance schemes which have already<br />
helped more than 120,000 people. Npoone eligible for any of<br />
these schemes will be turned away. We will expand the very<br />
successful education programme for unemployed youth, and<br />
extend the coverage of the NEAT scheme.<br />
We will spend $ 50 million over and above existing commitments<br />
to overhaul outmoded inner-city technical colleges. We are<br />
tackling the problem of improving and adapting the education<br />
of our children to meet more closely , he req tirements of the<br />
Australian job market.<br />
The Williams Inquiry has been appointed to examine this<br />
fundamental issue. We will act swiftly and decisively when<br />
the report is received.<br />
our strategy to create jobs is working. Total employment has<br />
risen by 180,000 since we came to office, and from next<br />
February unemployment will start to fall and keep on falling.<br />
We are determined to encourage Australian industry's new<br />
found-vitality<br />
Our predecessors'favoured buying cheap foreign products.<br />
This Government buys Australian.<br />
We will give export sales fresh impetus with a new five-year<br />
export incentive scheme. We will provide special help to<br />
Australian businesses competing for overseas projects. We<br />
will actively promote more processing in Australia of our<br />
basic raw materials. We will make finance more readily<br />
available to small businessmen,<br />
Unlike the Opposition, we are giving Australian industry,<br />
Australian jobs and Australian workers, the protection they<br />
need. We have increased protection for industries employing<br />
over a quarter of a million Austra lian. men and women. Our<br />
swift and effective. action has-meant.. the. survival.-ofzthe<br />
apparel-, . textile._ and-_-footwear in strieS whch employ<br />
120,000 people.<br />
Last week, the Labor Party refused to support our action.<br />
They turned their backs on 120,000 working Australians,<br />
of whom = re women, and many of whom are migrants.<br />
It iE; Labor -is the Party of unemployment.<br />
Mr. Whitla--= fe. unemployment a deliberate, calculated part<br />
of Governnr policy. It was Mr. Whitlam who, when he was<br />
Prime Minister, despite the warnings of a top level report,<br />
made his notorious, indiscriminate 25% across the board<br />
tariff cut a cut which put tens of thousands of Australians<br />
out of work. / In May. 1974 </p>
<p>In May 1974, there were almost 1.4 million Australians<br />
employed in manufacturing. By May 1975, just over one Year<br />
later, that number had dropped by over 100,000.<br />
O Now Mr. Whitlam wants to do it again.<br />
The Executive Director of the Apparel Manufacturers has<br />
said " No industry could be certain of survival if a Labor<br />
Party came to power",<br />
And he's right.<br />
Labor's tariff p olicy would cause massive unemployment.<br />
its commitment to higher taxes would reduce demand and<br />
create further unemployment. Labor wants a ' crash' spending<br />
programme involving $ 800 million in six months. That is an<br />
annual rate of $ 1,600 million a year.<br />
And Labor has made other promises worth billions of dollars<br />
and many more they have not costed. All this would more than<br />
double the deficit, unleash inflation once again, and increase<br />
interest rates. This could only have one result more<br />
unemployment.<br />
This is not just guess work. We know from bitter experience<br />
what Labor would do.<br />
For the-ten years before Labor last came to office, average<br />
unemployment was In three years, Labor increased<br />
unemployment to 5.4% of the workforce. In one year Labor<br />
increased unemployment by 157%_-, by almost 200,000 people.<br />
Labor has said it would repeal our 1st February tax cuts<br />
that are already law. ~..-/ People </p>
<p>People earning between $ 10,000 and $ 16,000 a year will pay<br />
a marginal rate of tax of only 32 cents in the dollar. Under the<br />
Hayden scales it was 45 cents. That means it will now be<br />
worth working overtime again. These tax cuts are a significant<br />
social reform. A quarter of a million low income earners, tens<br />
of thousands of pensioners, widows,. and students, with taxable<br />
incomes under $ 3,750 a year, will no longer pay any tax at all.<br />
These are the people Labor forgot. To. pay fof abolition, Labor would<br />
have to grab $ 850 million this year and $ 1,900 million next year<br />
out of the hands of the working men and women of Australia.<br />
Labor would pay these vast amounts to big and profitable comipanies.<br />
No jobs would be created. The companies have said so.<br />
The working men and women of Australia will not vote for a party with<br />
that policy. Mr Whitlam's Labor Party no longer represents the<br />
working men and women of Australia and he knows it.<br />
Labor knows its support is eroding, that's why it has mounted<br />
a campaign of fear in this last week of the election campaign.<br />
The Labor Party is desperately trying to frighten Australians out<br />
of think about the issues, by talking about division and confrontatio<br />
by talking about suicide and crime increasing; by showing a<br />
disgraceful advertisement on the uranium question which. shows<br />
a photograph of an infant playing with a hand grenade.<br />
I am certain this will offend all Australians.<br />
Australians are coming to know the hypocrisy of La bor's uranium<br />
policy. The fact that Mr Whitlam signed an agreement to mine<br />
and export uranium when he was in power. Australians are comig.<br />
to know the hypocrisy of Mr Dunstan the man the Labor Party<br />
has put on television to oppose uranium development.<br />
They're learning that Mr Dunstan has secretly granted exploration<br />
rights for uranium on an Aboriginal sacred and historic area.<br />
That he has encouraged the mining and stockpiling or uranium. at the<br />
Roxby Downs mine; and that he had licensed a foreign company to<br />
explore for uranium--just-30-kms.-south-and north of Adelaide.<br />
You have probably seen Labor's commercial which shqos Mr Dunstan<br />
diiging in the garden and talking against uranium. mOn-his recent<br />
record, I bet I know'what he is( dggingfor ( uinium)...<br />
H'es probably-got uranium exploration-' licence for-half of Adelaide.<br />
SLadies and gentlemen, in every area,. the Governmenthas laid<br />
firm foundations for national recovery. We have established a<br />
good framework for industrial relations. We have shows that a<br />
Government pr--zed to take a firm and fair stand can protect the<br />
community. ke Labor, we believe that no one should be above<br />
the law. I-_-i-al unionists have a right to be heard and a righ'<br />
to have a say -i how their union is run. It is the responsibility<br />
of Goverment to protect the entire community.<br />
Our record matches our promise: secret postal ballots for<br />
union elections are now compulsory; the Industrial Relations Burea<br />
is now operating; unions must now tell their members how their </p>
<p>dues are spent; individuals no longer have to join uions<br />
against their will. These are fair and firm laws they are<br />
supported by responsible unionists. Given a chance, Labor<br />
would repeal each one of these laws as soon as it could because<br />
it is the Labor Party's official policy to put unions above the law.<br />
We will not back away from these laws. The Government has<br />
also made fundamental reforms in social welfare.<br />
We have helped 300,000 poor families with 800,000 chuldren through<br />
our family allowances. Because of our legislation, pensions are<br />
now increased automatically to keep up with inflation.<br />
We know our ethnic communities have made a great contribution to<br />
Australia. Australia is proud to offer people from around the<br />
world the opportunity to build an independent life for themselves<br />
and their families.<br />
In the next three years we will concentrate on overcoming the<br />
lang' 2age barriers in our society both by expanding the teaching<br />
of English and the teaching in our schools of ethnic languages<br />
and cultures. Government departments will have ethnic liaison<br />
officers. We Wi! lpovide more interpreters, translators<br />
more migrant resources centres. The Government has decided that<br />
the age service pension, should, and will be, paid to non-British<br />
members of the allied forces. We have put ethnic broadcasting<br />
on a secure long term basis. We will establish ethnic television.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen, the Government offers Australia a return<br />
to prosperity, a higher standard of living and continuing policies<br />
which have provided Australians with new hope. We will press<br />
ahead with -our programmes which are now so clearly succeeding.<br />
In the next few years, Australia can fulfill our great promise.<br />
Through a sense of national unity of purpose, a determination<br />
by all Australians that we shall succeed, we can build a<br />
better life for everyone.<br />
As a concerned and caring community we can provide effective.<br />
help to those disadvantaged and in need, and give them. ignity and<br />
hope. As ipeople-conscious-oFour-responsibilities to<br />
other nations around the world we-can play a leadini role in<br />
developing a safer world a-less selfish world, a world that<br />
learns to use ; ts natural resources as a force for good and not<br />
for evil. we do all this, it is now within our grasp.<br />
I have no' hat the Australian people are ready and willing<br />
to play ther = art. My commitment to you tonight is that this<br />
Gover-ment Liberal/ National Country Party Government<br />
will lead Ats. alia to this better future. </p>
