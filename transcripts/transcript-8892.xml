STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
LAUNCH OF " EMERGING EXPORTERSO<br />
Today I am pleased to launch the final report " Emerging Exporters: Australia's<br />
High Value-Added Manufacturing Exports" that was prepared Jointly by<br />
McKinseys and the Australian Manufacturing Council. I acknowledge the role<br />
the AMC has played in commissioning research in this important area.<br />
The key findings of the study that we have a significant group of dynamic<br />
small firms achieving export success are now well known. The growth of<br />
these exporters is evidence of the transformation of the Australian economy<br />
since the mld-1980s.<br />
This transformation did not happen by chance.<br />
It reflects Australian firms responding to competition in the international market<br />
place. I<br />
It reflects our well trained workforce and our strong technological base.<br />
It reflects increasingly competitive communications and transportation systems.<br />
It reflects government policies that have opened up the Australian economy<br />
and encouraged Innovation and the emergence of new firms.<br />
And above all, it reflects the ingenuity and commitme nt of many individuals, of<br />
a new breed of Australian entrepreneurs.<br />
It Is these individuals who have recognised and taken opportunities. Some<br />
have built there success on unique products, others on innovative approaches<br />
to mark~ eting. B~ ut they all have relied on providing quality Australian goods<br />
tailored to the needs of their customers.<br />
The study has identified 700 firms that have been central to Australia's success<br />
in raising our exports of elaborately transformed manufactures in recent years<br />
by 15 per cent each year on average. .15/ 93 </p>
<p>This Is impressive, but it Is not enough. These successes are from a relatively<br />
small base.<br />
The challenge now is to encourage the development of new firms. Even more<br />
Importantly. it Is to encourage more of the 90% of existing manufacturing firms<br />
who are not actvely engaged In the international market place to do so. It will<br />
never be easy to export for the first time, but the rewards for those who<br />
persevere can be immense. These will be the firms of the future, and the<br />
leaders will be Australia's business leaders.<br />
The conditions for Success have never been better. Our production costs and<br />
our exchange rate are extremely competitive; our inflation rate Is among the<br />
lowest In the world; the tax changes introduced In investing in the Nation mean<br />
that we compete fa~ iourably not only among OECD countries but also In our<br />
region; our work practices are becoming much more responsive; our workforce<br />
is better trained: and our research effort has been strengthened and directed<br />
increasingly to commercial applications.<br />
Emerging Exporters is largely a message for our entrepreneurs, managers and<br />
other employees. It shows how we can succeed even in today's difficult<br />
economic circumstances,<br />
The report also contains important messages for government policy.<br />
Economic policies under Labor were pivotal In many of these 700 success<br />
stories. As the report makes clear, tariff reductions have forced manufacturers<br />
to become Internationally competit * ive and once a company is competitive.<br />
looking to overseas markets is an obvious step. This change in culture has<br />
been profound. For example, three-lquarters of the emerging exporters<br />
identified by the study haye r ecently begun exporting after an average of 27<br />
years of domestic activity,'<br />
The report also highlights. thie importance of other government policies to these<br />
firms, policies that include direct Incentives for exports, support for research<br />
and development, microeconomic reform, cooperative industrial relations and<br />
so on.<br />
These policies have produced results, but just as individual firms need to be<br />
responsive to changing demands so too policy needs to be responsive and<br />
relevant. The Report makes a number of policy recommendations of both a general and<br />
specific nature. Many build on or modify existing programs. My Government<br />
will be closely examining these, but some brief comments are warranted now.<br />
Changing Attitudes </p>
<p>Attitudes are changing, but some fundamental messages must be driven home.<br />
That Is why today's report Is so valuable, and why the Government welcomes<br />
the Australian Manufacturing Council's continuing involvement In encouraging<br />
dialogue and spreading the message.<br />
A central message is that exporting requires attention to quality and service.<br />
This was the motivation behind the launching of the Australian Quality Council<br />
In March ealer this year. It Is also why the Australian Quality Council Is<br />
working with NIES to introduce a Best Practice manual for small and medium<br />
sized enterprises ( SMEs).<br />
The Report also recommends that the Australian Best Practice Demonstration<br />
Program be more consciously targeted at SMEs. The Government will<br />
examine how to moreG effectively demonstrate best practice to SM Es.<br />
Market Access<br />
The Report contains some important observations about access to markets,<br />
particularly to Asian markets, that go beyond the rules of the game that<br />
governments set. Of course, an open multilateral trading system is needed to<br />
ensure that our exporters have appropriate access to their markets and thus<br />
resolution of the remaining hurdles in the Urugu ay Round Is a very high priority.<br />
Also, we are actively engaged in enhancing regional trade through APEC and<br />
our bilateral relationships.<br />
There is a pressing need to change the Image potential buyers have of<br />
Australia. Our image as a country cf wide open spaces and unique wildlife has<br />
served our tourist industry very well, but the report identifies the need to also<br />
present Australia as a modem., sophisticated society where high tech products<br />
equally reflect contemporary reality as the quality of our beaches.<br />
We are committed to bripadening perceptions of Australia. This will require a<br />
quire a continuing stratdgy on a number of fronts including, for example, the<br />
recent commencement of ABC TV services to the region. We will also explore,<br />
with business, whether a jointly funded campaign to change our image abroad<br />
should be developed as recommended in the Report. </p>
<p>1<br />
The Report highlights the hurdles that many of this group of emerging exporters<br />
face In getting started In overseas markets. Because it Is difficult to go it alone,<br />
business organisatons and the NIES program have helped to getting flrms to<br />
form themselves into clusters or networks. We can develop these mechanisms<br />
much further. The establishment of common marketing, distribution and other<br />
support facilities in strategic locations in Asia, including some of the foreign<br />
access zones that operate there, would assist many potential entrants. The<br />
direct Involvement of Australian banks would strengthen the operation and put<br />
the banks in a better position to assess the risk associated with particular<br />
exports. Technology The report highligh~ s*-the critical role that innovation plays in fast-moving<br />
international markets.<br />
Our policies are playing a key role in supporting business research and<br />
development. We have made the 150 per cent tax concession for research and<br />
development a permanent feature of the tax system, provided a range of grants<br />
for industrial research and development, provided funding for CSIRO, and set<br />
up the highly successful Cooperative Research Centres program.<br />
Australia now has one of the fastest growing rates of business R&amp; D in the<br />
OECD. Of course, much more needs to be done: our level of business R&amp; D Is<br />
still on the low side by world standards.<br />
The report suggests that we need. to ensure that our programs are effectively<br />
targeted and delivered. The competitive advantage of many of the emerging<br />
exporters identified by McKlnseys. relled in large part on a particular<br />
technological edge. In most cases this technology was developed within the<br />
firm with few of these firms having research connections to outside research<br />
institutions such as the riSI. RO or a university.<br />
I welcome CSIRO's current work in progress on developing a strategy to build<br />
better links with emerging exporters and smaller businesses. In addition, the<br />
Industry Commission's inquiry into research and development will look at<br />
incentives and impediments to the creation of linkages between research<br />
agencies, higher education institutions, and business. </p>
<p>Finance The availability of finance is a major issue for many emerging exporters who do<br />
not have the support of a largo parent. The reasons for this are clear there is<br />
always a high failure rate among smaller firms while expanding into new<br />
ventures, especially exports, can be very risky. But the rewards can also be<br />
very high and as a nation we need to be able to supply adequate finance to this<br />
group of emerging exporters.<br />
In Investing in the Nation we encouraged the banks to go further down the path<br />
of developing close relations with their business customers. The Treasurer will<br />
very shortly be in a position to announce the details of the measures in<br />
Investing in the Natortand see them put into effect. One of these measures<br />
will be the establishment of a business advisory council that will advise the<br />
R~ eserve Bank board on the concerns of small and medium size enterprises.<br />
The Governor will report on the advisory council's deliberations to both the<br />
Treasurer and Minister for Industry, Technology and Regional Development<br />
who confronts the question of finance routinely in his discussions with industry.<br />
In many cases traditional bank finance will not be appropriate. it is important<br />
that other forms of finance, both debt and equity, are available on suitable<br />
term's, Monitoring the availability of all forms of finance will be a priority of<br />
Government as economic recovery proceeds.<br />
Support for Exports and Small Business<br />
Small and medium sized enterprises ] MEs) have provided the engine of<br />
growth in Australia and indeed in most advanced countries in the last few<br />
years. By the end of 199$ employment in small firms exceeded that in larger<br />
Australian companies for-the first time. During the recession new jobs have<br />
continued to be treated ih smaller companies. This study shows how many of<br />
them have succeeded in'export markets.<br />
The Government has placed considerable emphasis in giving small business a<br />
" hand up", particularly in the areas of developing export markets. A number of<br />
programs have been effective:<br />
Export Access provides training and practical assistance in developing an<br />
export strategy, and Is expected to reach 700 companies over four years;<br />
AUSTRADE is helping an increasing number of small firms to enter markets<br />
overseas, and is establishing more services specifically designed for the<br />
needs of SMr~ s;<br />
* The Export Market Development Grants program, administered by<br />
AUSTRADE. has helped most companies which have succeeded in<br />
overseas markets: </p>
<p>* The NIES program, jointly funded by the Commonwealth and the States,<br />
priovides consultancy services to SMVEs which can improve their<br />
performance in a range of areas.<br />
In many countiries the emphasis of industry policy has been changing in favour<br />
of smaller companies and away from bigger firms, which often have the<br />
information and resources needed to look after themselves.<br />
While the Government already assists smaller firms in a number of ways, as<br />
we have seen, the nature of the support for this sector and the effective<br />
coordination of programs will be examined In the coming months. The findings<br />
and recommendations of the AMC-McKinsey study provide a valuable<br />
contribution to any a~ sessment of the policy environment for smaller Australian<br />
companies. CANBERRA June 1993 </p>
