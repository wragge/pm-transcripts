E OZ PROOF ONLY<br />
PM Hawke on Diana Warnock 6WF<br />
27/ 1/ 89<br />
DW; The coming State election is an important one. It's the first of<br />
several this year and commentators are seeing it as a barometer for the<br />
fortunes of both the ALP and the Conservative Parties federally. The<br />
short campaign has been distinguished by the visit of numerous<br />
political illuminaries from the east. This morning we welcome to the<br />
studio Australia's Prime minister, Bob Hawke. Welcome to the studio.<br />
PX; Tlweink yuu vtxzy muuh1 Diana.<br />
DW: Well now you will have obviously heard that polls are<br />
predicting a very close result indeed in the WA election and it is<br />
known too that the preferences of the minor parties and independents<br />
will be vital this time. How important is this State election to<br />
Federal Labor's fortunes do you think?<br />
PM: Well I don't say it is vital, but every State election has its<br />
significance. We would obviously rather wine and I believe we will.<br />
It will increase our confidence correspondingly if the opposition<br />
didn't win here having set such high store on it will effect their<br />
moral and standing. So it would be very dishonest politician to say<br />
that it's not significant. But it is not crucial in the sense of what<br />
happens here will determine the federal outcome.<br />
DW: It can't be long of course until the next federal election and you<br />
don't feel at all that the result here is likely to influence that. I<br />
am thinking of the domino effect that some people...<br />
PM: Oh no the next Federal election is in the order of a yea~ r away and<br />
I repeat for the benefit of your listeners what I have said publicly<br />
now the sort of period within which the election will come will be some<br />
latter part of this year to May of 1990. So it is in the order of 12<br />
months away.<br />
DWs Prime Minister the minor parties are very much a feature of this<br />
campaign suggesting perhaps disillusionment with the major parties.<br />
Does that confirm that Labor has lost touch with the ordinary person as<br />
some people have been suggesting for about a year or two now?<br />
PM: No I don't think so. I think it is true to say though Diana that<br />
about a year ago it couuld be uaid there was evidence of that sort of<br />
feeling and I suppose the most dramatic illustration of that was in the<br />
results of the NSW State election. I am very confident that; in regard<br />
to our base of ordinary working people, and when I say ordinary working<br />
people that's not just at the lower income level, I mean we have got a<br />
lot of support now right up the salary scale. And I think in there<br />
that support has come back during 1988. </p>
<p>DWz Prime Minister people appear to be hurting financially. H~ ow firm<br />
a commitment can you give that low and middle income earners the people<br />
you were talking about will get tax cuts?<br />
PHI I can give an absolute commitment. I have done it -, QlIready<br />
within the last f ew weeks, I take this opportunity Diana on your<br />
programme to say to the people of Western Australia that those tax cuts<br />
will come in July lst. They will as I have said be targeted tovards<br />
the lower and the middle income groups. People who may I say take this<br />
opportunity of again Baying directly to them, have paid an enormous<br />
role in the great economic progress of this country by exercising.<br />
restraint and the time has come where with responsible 19conomic<br />
management we believe that we can assist them to improve their living<br />
standards, their living standards will go up during this year as a<br />
combination in this state of the tax cuts that we will bring in, the<br />
lowered inflation rate which is coming through in 1989 and mixy I also<br />
say that in regard to the wage movements the position of my Govt and my<br />
party reflected by Mr Dowding is that people should get legitimate wage<br />
increases as against the Conservatives who have opposed every wage<br />
* increase in the last 6 years. So the combination of tax cuts, lowered<br />
Winflation and wage increases, with the additional element in Western<br />
Australia of the performance of the Dowding Govt in keeping State taxes<br />
and charges to zero in this last year, .11 those things together in<br />
Western Australia will mean as a combination of the Dowding and Hawke<br />
Labor Govt's improve4 living standards.<br />
DW; But you do admit a moment ago you said that people had had to be<br />
restrained for some time. Do you think any anti-Labor backlash during<br />
this campaign might be the result of delays in relief for the average<br />
tax payer?<br />
PM: No I don't think so, because I had to f ace up to this issue in<br />
1987 Diana, of whether you were taking unacceptable political risks in<br />
being absolutely frank with the Australian electorate. I was told by a<br />
lot of people in the Labor Party that I was risking electoral suicide<br />
in 1987 going in and telling them it was tough and they had to have<br />
their belts pulled in and that's what we had done and will continue to<br />
do while it was necessary. And I think what happened turnod<br />
0traditional political wisdom on its head. In other words I believe<br />
and I have for a long time that the Australian electorate is more<br />
mature and more intelligent, more adult than most political<br />
commentators and politicians give them credit for. I mean we lost $ 11<br />
billion of our national income there in 1985/ 1986 as a result of no<br />
fault of your listeners, the workers of this country it was just wiped<br />
off Australia's national income by the decline of the terms of trade.<br />
Now that meant standards had to come down and we did it in the most<br />
equitable way possible.*<br />
DWI The cost of building and buying a house of course is a big issue<br />
in the State election campaign and that is what we are righ~ t in the<br />
middle of now. You've deliberately tightened monetary policies sending<br />
up interest rates. Have these policies damaged the local State Govt's<br />
chances? </p>
<p>-3-<br />
PM: Well let me say this. It is true that for anty politician, any<br />
political party, govt or opposition interest rates are always<br />
significant and i would rather have interest rates lower than higher.<br />
There is no politician alive who wouldn't rather be operating with them<br />
down rather than up. But at the same time you have got to understand<br />
that monetary policy is part of the overall policy and for-.~ the<br />
Australian people, people of Western Australia included, we have still<br />
a problem on the external account where we cannot keep on sucking in<br />
imports in an unlimited way. We have got to temper the level of<br />
economic activity in Australia so that our import bill is manageable<br />
and therefore the problem I have got as Prime Minister in managing the<br />
Australian economy is not a weak economy, but one in a sense which is<br />
growing too strong, so we have got to keep the level of activity down a<br />
bit so that we will be able to accommodate the other areas of policy<br />
including the reductions in taxation this year. But interest rate.<br />
will stay high for no longer than is necessary to deal with the overall<br />
management of policy and containing the level of growth. rA~ fd may I<br />
* Just make this point in regard to housing and interest rates, in all<br />
those difficult circumstances interest rates under my Govt have not<br />
reached anywhere near the peak they did under the Howard/ Fraser Govt.<br />
DW i Prime Minister I want to move on to another subject. Labor in<br />
this State like Federal Labor has been criticised f or its close links<br />
with big business. Do you believe that Labor is simply changing with<br />
the times and doing what any political party in the 1980s and<br />
approaching the 190s must do to govern today, or do you think that that<br />
is a liability for Federal and State Labor, the perceived liLnks with<br />
business? PM: I think that those links were in the case of Federal Govt grossly<br />
overstated and I think here as well. I came to Govt, in the election<br />
of 1983, you will recall I said this is going to be a Govt which is<br />
going to have close co-operation with the trade union movement and with<br />
business. I called the summit, had the representatives of big<br />
business, small business and the unions that's been the characteristic<br />
of this Govt.<br />
M~ So it is a necessary part of Govt in the<br />
PM: It is a necessary part of Govt to be able to have communication<br />
with close dialogue with and consultation with the business community.<br />
But you've got to be in a position where in the end you make the<br />
decisions that are in the interests of the community. That no-one can<br />
say that the decision you take is a dictate of business. Now it cannot<br />
be said in this State and it certainly can't be said Federally and I<br />
guess in the end the best test of the outcome of this consultation<br />
Diana is what's happened in the area of jobs and could I just remind<br />
you that under this Govt Federally and under this Govt hero in this<br />
State, we have had the highest rates of job. growth in our history and<br />
twice and fast as the rest of the world and you only get that because<br />
you have co-operation with both the trade union movement; and the<br />
business community. You get common goals and understanding.<br />
DWs Well the opposition don't necessarily feel that links with<br />
business for this Govt certainly in western Australia have been<br />
fortunate.* Your Federal colleague MAbtrn 1, John Moore.. was here this<br />
week and he said a Fitzgerald type enquiry should be held here to look<br />
into Govt business ties, Rothwells and so on, what would you Say? </p>
<p>-4-<br />
PM: It is very easy for John Moore, a singly indistinguished Federal<br />
politician if I might say so, to come here a man who was head of the<br />
Stock Exchange in his home state of Qid a man who has the most intimate<br />
historical ties with business to be talking on this sort of plane. The<br />
fact is that the people of Western Australia will be making their<br />
decisions on the issues of cost of living, the care for the elderly,<br />
jobs, education where our record is impeccable and leaves their record<br />
for dead and if the John Moore's ex-President's of the Stock Exchange<br />
is now in the political world, if they want to talk about the question<br />
of relations between political parties and business let them look at<br />
the only parts of Australia where any suggestion of corruption between<br />
a political party and business exists and that is in Qid and now in<br />
) 1tw.<br />
DW: Prime Minister thanks very much for your time today that's all we<br />
have time for. I know that you are very busy, thank you for joining<br />
Us. PM: it has been my pleasure Diana.<br />
DW;. And Just before you leave us just let me quickly give you the<br />
cricket score. The first wicket has fallen in the cricket, with Marsh<br />
out for 4, Taylor is on 7 and Boon still to score.<br />
PM: Oh well it's not a bad target they have got though iB it, great<br />
performance by Border.<br />
DW: Thank you.<br />
ENDS.<br />
