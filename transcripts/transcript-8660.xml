    <content><![CDATA[<p>My attention has been drawn to the latest baseless allegations and imputations made against me by Senator Michael Baume, accusing me of some impropriety in relation to my private investment in a piggery.</p>
<p>All details of my entirely proper investment have been declared as required on the Parliamentary_ pecuniary interests register.</p>
<p>People should be wary of what is clearly an orchestrated and baseless smear campaign being waged against me in the Senate by Senator Baume and others, at Dr Hcwson's behest. This is Dr llewson playing entirely personal and cowardly politics at its worst. No Opposition Leader in my memory has had his agents mount such scurrilous and personal attacks.</p>
<p>Dr Hcwson has returned to these tactics chiefly because he has had such an appalling week in the House of Representatives.</p>
<p>Senator Baume in particular has made repeated allegations against me, all of which have been proved to be baseless. Not only were they wrong, but he knew they were wrong before bhe raised them.</p>
<p>CANBERRA<br />16 September, 1992</p>
