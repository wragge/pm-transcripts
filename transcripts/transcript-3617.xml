PRIME MINISTER Press Statmnt No. 453<br />
14 February 1975<br />
ADDITIONAL FUNDS FOR THE STATES IN 1974-75<br />
Following discussions at today's Premiers' Conference<br />
thie Australian Government has undertaken to support the<br />
provision of additional funds for the States and their<br />
authorities in 1974-75 totalling $ 240 million. This is<br />
made up as follows:<br />
* additional general revenue grants of $ 60 million<br />
* additional State Government Loan Council programs<br />
of $ 60 million<br />
* additional borrowing allocations for larger State<br />
Authorities of $ 50 million<br />
* additional employment grants of:<br />
$ 30 million for roads<br />
$ 40 million for general employment purposes.<br />
A table showing the State by State amounts is attached.<br />
The additional general revenue grants and State<br />
Government Loan Council programs are being provided, and<br />
the additional borrowing programs for State authorities<br />
are being supported, on the basis of the States' firm<br />
4W assurances that the funds will be used in such a way that<br />
they have the greatest practicable effects within the<br />
remainder of this financial year in terms of employment.<br />
The additional employment grants for roads and for<br />
general purposes will be subject to additional conditions<br />
of an appropriate kind.<br />
The employment grants scheme will be in addition to<br />
the on-going Regional Employment Development Scheme.<br />
These additional funds will have a substantial effect in<br />
enabling the States to retain employees whose jobs would<br />
otherwise have been at risk and in enabling them to take<br />
on additional employees.<br />
