    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Australian veteran and ex-service community will have their views represented by the fourteen Australians appointed today to the Prime Ministerial Advisory Council on Ex-service Matters, the Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd, and Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Alan Griffin announced today.</p>
<p>The members of the Council are different to any other current veteran representative group.  Members are drawn from every part of the veteran community, including servicemen, partners of veterans, war widows and veteran advocates.  The Council reflects and brings together the diverse groups in the veteran and ex-service community. </p>
<p>The Chair of the Council will be Dr Allan Hawke, former Secretary of the Departments of Veterans' Affairs and Defence and the current Chancellor of the Australian National University. </p>
<p>Dr Hawke will be assisted by Frank Benfield, Dr Robert Black AM RFD, the Hon Graham Edwards, June Healy OAM, Commodore Nick Helyer MBE RANR, Warrant Officer Peter Hind OAM, Ken Kipping AM, Gail MacDonell, Anne Pahl, Philip Pyke, Donna Reggett, Brigadier Keith Rossi AM OBE RFD ED (Rtd) and Brigadier Neil Weekes AM MC (Rtd).</p>
<p>âAs a group, these people have personal and professional experience spanning the three services, in advocacy, rehabilitation and parliamentary processes, and have an understanding of the impact of service on families.  I look forward to hearing their input on ex-service issues,â said Mr Rudd.</p>
<p>The Minister for Veterans' Affairs sought the views of the ex-service community about how they wanted their issues communicated to government.  More than 100 submissions to a discussion paper were received, and the Minister met in excess of 800 people at consultation meetings held throughout Australia during the Parliamentary recess.</p>
<p>âAs you'd expect, I've heard a variety of views, but veterans themselves were very supportive of the concept of the Council,â said Mr Griffin.</p>
<p>The Council will advise the Government on veteran and ex-service issues, and identify problems and priorities to improve the Government's provision of services.</p>
<p>The Council will meet for the first time in October 2008. At its first meeting it will confirm its terms of reference and advise on a review of current consultation mechanisms between DVA and the ex-service community. The Government will also seek the Council's advice on major issues facing the portfolio in coming months, including the study of suicide in the ex-service community and the reconsideration of the Clarke Review recommendations not accepted by the previous Government. Further information on the Advisory Council is available at minister.dva.gov.au.</p>
<p>The establishment of the Council delivers on another of the Rudd Government's election commitments.</p>
