    <content><![CDATA[<p>As part of the Government's response to the Regional Telecommunications Inquiry I have appointed a Prime Minister's Taskforce to monitor the implementation of the $181 million package designed to further improve telecommunications in regional, rural and remote parts of Australia.</p>
<p>The Taskforce will be chaired by the Member for Hinkler, Mr Paul Neville, with the Member for Indi, Ms Sophie Panopoulos, as Deputy Chairman.</p>
<p>Other members of the backbench taskforce will be Senator Richard Colbeck from Tasmania, the Member for Kalgoorlie, Mr Barry Haase, the Member for Grey, Mr Barry Wakelin and the Member for Parkes, Mr John Cobb.</p>
<p>These Liberal and National Party members representing regional areas of all states of Australia are well placed to monitor the rollout of improvements to telecommunications services.</p>
<p>The Taskforce will report to me at regular intervals and will have access to all the information they need to do the job.</p>
<p>The Government's response to the Regional Telecommunications Inquiry will improve existing fixed line, mobile and data services and ensure that Australians living in regional, rural and remote areas continue to share in the benefits flowing from advances in telecommunications.</p>
<p>It includes $142 million for a National Broadband Strategy to take affordable, always-on, high speed data services to regional areas; $15.9 million to further extend terrestrial mobile phone coverage; $4 million to extend the satellite phone subsidy and $10.1 million to fund IT training in rural and remote areas.  </p>
