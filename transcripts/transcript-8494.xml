TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
INTERVIEW WITH PETER CAVE MONDAY 27 APRIL 1992<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
PC: Prime Minister, you described the trip to Kokoda and<br />
Lae as one of the most moving experiences in your<br />
public life. Why was that?<br />
PM: Because it was the place where the sovereignty of<br />
Australia was fought and decided by young conscripts in<br />
the main, the AIF was there too, but in the main young<br />
conscripts, boys 18, 19, 20 years of age who just died<br />
there in one of the most vicious campaigns of the war,<br />
and on the 50th anniversary we were there to remember<br />
it and to say thank you.<br />
PC Why did it move you so much personally?<br />
PM: I think it was probably the location, the ground where<br />
the commemoration was, was actually fought over, people<br />
had actually died there and that and the village, the<br />
village hadn't changed very much in the years and the<br />
mountains in the back, it was as though you could have<br />
been there. I'm sure if I'd have had a son there you<br />
would not be composed and stand there, you could not be<br />
composed and stand there. I felt as the Prime Minister<br />
an obligation to express appreciation on behalf of the<br />
nation to those families who left their sons there.<br />
PC: Is it fair to say that this whole trip has really been<br />
about nationalism away, for maybe finding our place in<br />
history in Papua New Guinea, finding our place in the<br />
world in Jakarta?<br />
PM: No, it's about two things. It was about the<br />
neighbourhood, making our place more certain in the<br />
immediate region, trying to put the Indonesia<br />
relationship into its proper context and at the same<br />
time accepting the Prime Minister of Papua New Guinea's<br />
offer to be there for the 50th anniversary of the Papua<br />
New Guinea campaigns on Anzac Day. We lost 2000 boys<br />
in that campaign and this was the appropriate time, for<br />
me anyway, to remember them and say something about it. </p>
<p>PC: In Indonesia did you feel you had to make a point that<br />
there were more important things in the relationship<br />
than human rights?<br />
PM: Well I thought I got the balance right. That was being<br />
able to say and having said that we thought the events<br />
in Timor were a tragedy, that the military was too<br />
tough, that there had to be a better basis of dealing<br />
with the problem. Essentially one of a process of<br />
reconciliation, while at the same time saying that the<br />
whole relationship is important to Australia. And not<br />
only important, that the whole relationship the<br />
Government of Indonesia had brought to Australia and<br />
brought to the region 25 years of stability. If the<br />
Indonesian archipelago were fracturing or breaking up,<br />
Australian strategic policy would be completely<br />
different and the Timor debate would be set in an<br />
entirely different context.<br />
ends </p>
