FOR PRESS: P. M. No. 2/ 1966<br />
RHODESIA<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister, Sir Robert Menzies<br />
Cabinet yesterday, after a complete review of<br />
the proposals of the Prime Minister of Nigeria for a special<br />
Commonwealth Conference on Rhodesia, reaffirmed its view,<br />
which I had already announced, that such a conference should<br />
not be attended by Australia as a participant. We will ask<br />
Sir Abubakar Balewa to permit our High Commissioner to Nigeria,<br />
Mr. Cumes, to attend as an observer only.<br />
ire have taken our decisions on this matter on a<br />
ground of important principle adherence to which is in our<br />
opinion of the greatest importance to the long-term future<br />
and interests of Australia and of the Commonwealth. We put<br />
them in this order because<br />
1. Our prime duty is to Australia.<br />
2. If the modern Commonwealth, on the initiative<br />
of some or many of its members, begins to claim<br />
the right to intervene in and give orders in<br />
relation to matters which are the proper concern<br />
of some individual member of the Commonwealth<br />
good relations cannot long continue, nor can the<br />
present Commonwealth structure long endure.<br />
As I have previously pointed out the last Prime<br />
Ministers' Conference in 1965 unanimously declared ( not for the<br />
first time) that " the authority and responsibility for leading<br />
her remaining colonies, including Southern Rhodesia, to<br />
independence must continue to rest with Britain."<br />
Britain having the sole authorit and ility,<br />
is it for the rest of us to give instructions to ritain<br />
as ohow she is to use her authority and discharge her<br />
responsibility? My Government strongly believes that it is not.<br />
For if Britain can be instructed or coerced by the Commonwealth<br />
or most of its members in a matter which is by concession,<br />
hers and hers alone to deal with, then Australia can some day<br />
be instructed or coerced on some matter in which the sole<br />
jurisdiction resides with Australia.<br />
We emphasise this. It is the essence of our<br />
case, and the basis of our attitude. g7e state it not simply<br />
as something affecting the present Australian Government; it<br />
will be of continuing importance for all future Governments in<br />
our country. There need be no misapprehension about our attitude<br />
towards the events in Rhodesia. V'e have not given either<br />
orders or advice to Britain. We have supported her actions<br />
by similar actions in the fields of non-recognition, in economic<br />
and financial sanctions. We are opposed to the use of force<br />
for compelling a constitutional settlement. . e wish to see<br />
by proper degrees and with reasonable preparation, a majority<br />
of African voters in Rhodesia. ' e hope that Rhodesians themselves<br />
will become , illing to reopen negotiations with Britain to<br />
achieve this result. / 2 </p>
<p>2-<br />
We are not a party principal in this matter<br />
our prime responsibilities and problems are nearer home. With<br />
great respect to the distinguished convener of the Special<br />
Conference, we cannot see any useful result flowing From it.<br />
If all the Commonwealth countries take the same view as Britain<br />
does ( and as we do), there is no occasion for a special conference<br />
to record that fact. If, as seems painfully clear, there are<br />
Commonwealth countries which will be satisfied by nothing less<br />
than armed force directed against Rhodesia, with all its<br />
dreadful consequences for Africa and for the relationship of<br />
the races in that country, the conference could not do more than<br />
expose great differences and create much bitterness, with all the<br />
distortions and even misrepresentations which such a ' tate of<br />
affairs would inevitably produce.<br />
It will then be seen that we base our decision<br />
upon what is to us a gTeat principle, and also upon the immediate<br />
practical considerations which I have endeavoured to state.<br />
CANBERRA, 6th January, 1966 </p>
