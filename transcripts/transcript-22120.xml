    <content><![CDATA[<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister is it now time to widen the inquiry into the possible bribes paid to the Iraqi regime?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p> Mr Cole does not think so and he is the most objective and independent authority on this subject. What he's made very clear this morning is that he would like a widening of the terms of reference in relation to the BHP investigation. In relation to the role and involvement of Commonwealth people, he has said at this stage he does not think any widening is necessary. If he were to change his mind, then he would approach the Government and as I've said earlier if there is such an approach we will consider it on its merits. But I think it is interesting what he said this morning, I don't want to take it any further than that because the inquiry is still under way. I do very strongly support, however, the remarks he made repudiating the offensive suggestions emanating from the United States that he was not independent of the Government. I had something to say about that this morning in advance of the comments of Mr Cole, I thought they were offensive inaccurate remarks and I totally agree with his repudiation of that baseless allegation.</p>
<p> JOURNALIST:</p>
<p> Mr Howard how can Australia have confidence with men who go overseas and behave like that?</p>
<p>   PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I don't know that all the photographs taken, of all of us in certain circumstances, wouldn't in some way if published in a newspaper end up embarrassing us.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p> But it's not something you've done, toting gun?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No. Look I am not going to get into a commentary on a couple of photographs. The commission is inquiring into certain matters, Mr Cole has said subject to the one broadening in relation to BHP, that he is satisfied with the terms of reference. Now that's what he said this morning, that he was satisfied with terms of reference. He was saying this morning that he did not at this stage feel constrained by the current terms of reference except in relation to the BHP matters. Now as to the conduct of the AWB people, findings in relation to AWB, that is a matter for the commission of inquiry. AWB is entitled to its full day in court and we should not try and pre-empt what the commission will find. So far as the Government is concerned, it remains the case that we will continue to cooperate fully with the inquiry. Information sought will be provided, if I were asked to attend or any of my ministerial colleagues, we would do so. Any officials of the Government who are asked to attend will do so and my only request of everybody is that they tell the truth.</p>
<p> JOURNALIST:</p>
<p> Does it prevent him from addressing the legality or otherwise of the public servants who will be questioned?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p> No, you should read his statement.</p>
<p> JOURNALIST:</p>
<p> Are you still confident in the behaviour of DFAT in the lead up to all of this given the email that was released yesterday?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p> The email released yesterday did not identify AWB as being involved in kickbacks. Now, the question of whether AWB has been or has not been is germane to the inquiry and I am not going to comment on it. On the information that I have been given and based on the advice that I have received, I do not believe that anybody in DFAT has behaved improperly.</p>
<p> JOURNALIST:</p>
<p> You heard three times from the Canadian Government, the US and the CPA that these allegations had been made. Why was it not properly investigated before the Volker Inquiry?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well those matters were investigated at the time and the nature of those investigations has in part been provided in evidence and I am sure that matter will be further examined when the DFAT officials appear.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister are you sure that no-one in the Government knew what was going on?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I did not know, Mr Downer and Mr Vaile did not know and on the information that I have and based on the advice I have received I do not believe that anybody in the Departments were told that AWB was paying bribes.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Do you believe that Mr Cole is confident that no one in this Government knew?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I can't speak for Mr Cole. If you want to ask Mr Cole a question, you go and ask him a question. The only thing I would say about him is that he is a lawyer of very, very high repute. As he pointed out this morning, he served for years as a member of the New South Wales Court of Appeal which is second only in status in this country to the High Court of Australia; status and seniority. Any suggestion that he is doing other than conduct a proper inquiry in accordance with the principles in his judicial oath is wrong and offensive. Thank you.</p>
