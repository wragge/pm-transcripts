TRANSCRIPT OF DOORSTOP, CHANNEL NINE STUDIOS, MELBOURNE<br />
" AUGUST 1989<br />

JOURNALIST: conunent on Ian Sinclair's' cla: im that unless.<br />
, the: C oal: itio6 gets its policy arnd philosphical act together<br />
i t has little hope of winning the next election.<br />
PM: He's right. You can' t~ rely on Ian Sinclair getting<br />
0it'straight arnd right but he's 100% right in saying that<br />
the Coalition is not ready for Government, don't deserve<br />
government. It's a pretty damning indictment comIng from<br />
the person who was their number two person until very recently.<br />
He's absolutely right. Why? They have no policies and in<br />
the area of policy consideration there are absolutely<br />
fundamental divisions within the Liberal Party, within the<br />
National Party and between elements of the Liberal Party<br />
* and the Nati onal Party. They have no Policies. They have<br />
no leaders'that are trusted by themselves., The. inter-, sting<br />
thing' abu I r Peadock and the Liberals, none of ' them hav~ e<br />
any confidence in him as a man of substance. They thought'<br />
HoWard had some substance, they thought Peacock had none<br />
but he was going to be a better salesman, So they've got<br />
no confidence in him in terms of policy. And of course with<br />
Mr Blunt the Leader of the National Party, they describe<br />
him, they do, as a billy goat. So no policies, divisions<br />
and no confidence in their leaders. So when you put all<br />
that together Sinclair's<br />
0OVRNALIST:* Do you also agree with his comment that the<br />
recent leadership changes ha,% only gone to confuse the electorate?<br />
PM. Well ' T. don't know that the electorate is confused..'<br />
t think the opp osit6 Is true. ' I think the pleotorate is<br />
* far fromn confused. They say, well 1ook at this mob. The<br />
simple rule. They can't govern themselves, they can't govern<br />
the country, It's a good rule of politics. In the Labor<br />
Party we were to a large extent rightly condemned on that<br />
., fundamental -principle of the Australian Mc. oerc. Vc. 2' T,* Ihey.<br />
., say to th parties -of Austria if you na'o r eoe~ ser<br />
VOU e nogoing to governus<br />
JOURNALIST: Is it a good move as far as the ALP is concerned?.<br />
* PM: Well, we show that we can govern ourselves. We are<br />
a united, tough,; competent, compassionate team. That shows<br />
, ii 4v ! una I I 4h nb n ta WA a^ na A-0et LW1~ r e7.* w1 . rw s ua.<br />
so we can govern the country*. On the other side they are<br />
a collection of unprincipled opportunists. Mr Sinclair is<br />
I mp., pa~ itig, t' 4I issued the warning straight and clear 1.<br />
I </p>
<p>to billy goat Blunt,^ he say's you're fair game boy, you butted<br />
me out billy goat and I'm about to butt you right out at<br />
the earliest opportunity. Good luck to them as they play<br />
their games. They expend all their energies on hating and<br />
fighting one another. We'll get on with governing the country.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Sinclair rs vowed to challenge for the leadership.<br />
Do you think he will butt his way back in again?<br />
PM: I would think if I were Mr Blunt I would have the very<br />
very heaviest padding around my backside and py bacl
he'll get butted and stabbed. There's no doubt about that.<br />
He needs very heavy protective armour because rlt's face<br />
