TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P. J. KEATING MP<br />
DOORSTOP, DREAMTIME CULTURAL CENTRE, ROCKHAMPTON,<br />
TUESDAY, 19 JULY 1994<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
J: Mr Keating, you made some remarks about the importance of regions,<br />
we're talking about the Central Queensland region here, how important<br />
will it be in Australia's future?-<br />
PM: Well, I think, that regional development is going to be important across<br />
the country, but probably especially so in states which have better<br />
than average growth opportunities and, I think, this is true of<br />
Queensland it's got this temperate climate running for it, it's got a<br />
population shift running for it. Regions, I think, are getting better<br />
organised, they are more tightly focussed and they do engender their<br />
own confidence. I mean, what studies show is where we see regional<br />
leadership we see progress beyond the national average. Now, the<br />
Commonwealth is prepared to get in and help people in such progress.<br />
We are prepared to get in and help regions do these things, but it's got<br />
to be on the basis that people are there to help themselves too.<br />
But, I think, in this part of Queensland where we are seeing people<br />
are aware of the fact that there are enormous international<br />
opportunities here as well as national ones. I think, that's a big break<br />
through.<br />
J: What is the significance of talking to the young Central Queenslanders<br />
this morning?<br />
PM: Well, I always get a charge out of talking to young people because<br />
their minds are, apart from being fresh and alert, they are not weighed<br />
down with a whole lot of baggage and prejudices and they're just<br />
happy to take things as they come, think about them and respond.<br />
They are always a tough audience young people. They are tough<br />
judges and I always like to give them the opportunity to at least say<br />
things to them directly and it is not filtered through the media or </p>
<p>something else. So, I enjoy the opportunities and well, I think, they<br />
did.<br />
J: How did you impress on them the days of riding on the sheeps' back<br />
are over. It's a tough message to deliver in an area that is so rurally<br />
focussed.<br />
PM: Well, it is not to say that we don't need rural industry, we do, and rural<br />
industries contribution to Australia is still very obvious. Fortunately<br />
now because of the change in the last ten years, rural industries are<br />
now more competitive than it used to -be. But, it is not enough to<br />
sustain the Australian population. It needs more than it. It needs<br />
innovative product markets, internationally traded services and the<br />
other thing is we can have them and we can particularly have them<br />
with a big through put to our education system. You know, high<br />
participation rates in schools, huge addition to university and TAFE<br />
places, all of this is going to power along, push along product<br />
innovation and our capacity to market sophisticated products. So, I<br />
think, with rural industry what we want to do is do the traditional things<br />
well, but add value where we can and our changes of doing that now<br />
are much greater than they were 10 years ago.<br />
J: Shoalwater Bay is obviously the biggest regional issue at this time.<br />
Will you be having a look at it?<br />
PM: Let me confess my interest in some of the pristine areas of this<br />
country. I was one of the members of Cabinet that supported the<br />
decision to preserve the Daintree rainforest, more recently Jervis Bay<br />
in NSW and 1, as you know, commissioned the study of Shaolwater<br />
Bay, looking at the economic and environmental values of the area:<br />
Now, the report has been presented. The Cabinet is about to consider<br />
the report and I hope that will be soon.<br />
J: Have you also had a look at what the miners have had to say about<br />
the report?<br />
PM: Well, I've had some cursory examination of that, but I think, this will all<br />
be revealed in the Cabinet discussion we'll have.<br />
J: So, you can't give any hopes to the ' greenies' here today?<br />
PM: Well, I think, the hope to the ' greenies' as you put it is the fact that the<br />
review is there in the first place and it is now reported and the<br />
Government will have to deal with its recommendations, but there is a<br />
thing called due process and due process means that you don't rush<br />
the judgements.<br />
J: Any comment today on home lending. Banks is a big issue the word<br />
in Canberra today. </p>
<p>PM: Well, I think, the Reserve Bank is doing what central banks do they<br />
keep an eye on the system they run they run the banking system,<br />
look at its impact upon the national economy, its prudential<br />
supervision, and the Government has obviously, you know, had some<br />
communication with the banks about housing lending, its modalities<br />
and its impact on the economy.<br />
J: Should we feel confident then with new home lenders, new home<br />
buyers?<br />
PM: I think, there is more tha n enough. I m-ean, you are seeing now an<br />
absolute proliferation of home lending institutions. An absolute<br />
proliferation of them. We've got the ACTU joining with one of the big<br />
mutual funds to provide housing lending, we are seeing it coming from<br />
some of the smaller savings banks, so I don't think the housing market<br />
has ever been better serviced than now.<br />
J: What about re-regulation as the way to go?<br />
PM: Well, if we are talking about re-regulation in the pure, no, of course, it<br />
is not the way to go. We just spent a decade getting out of it, but that<br />
is not to say that the sensible supervision on the system, that is, the<br />
central bank nudging the system in one direction or another isn't an<br />
appropriate thing for a central bank to do.<br />
J: the drought will worsen, is there anything further the Federal<br />
Government can do to help the farmers?<br />
PM: Well, we think that these climate change affects are now so profound<br />
that they are with us almost every year, that these are no longer simply<br />
a, sort of, fall into disaster category. It is almost part of managing rural<br />
enterprise and accordingly we have now included drought<br />
arrangements in the Rural Adjustment Scheme, well, in the breadth of<br />
the Rural Adjustmenf Scheme ra ther tlian simply regarding it as a one<br />
off, because they are not one offs, they are around most of the time in<br />
one form or another. We are now looking at this scheme and Bob<br />
Collins was, I think, here recently, is now seeking a review of the<br />
scheme to make sure that it is meeting its objectives in terms of<br />
assistance to drought affected areas.<br />
J: The farmers are upset that you haven't been to a droughted property<br />
on this particular tour?<br />
PM: Well, I have on others. I mean, I know what the problem is and it is<br />
coming from these obviously climate change affects. As I say, it is<br />
more or less a permanent feature of the landscape in one place or<br />
another. So, the thing to do is to try and deal with it systemically<br />
through something like RAS and where we think that it is not working<br />
right, think about it, talk about it, review it and get it right. </p>
<p>J: Mr Keating, the remarks made on ' AM' this morning from Thailand's<br />
Deputy and Foreign Minister, are you aware of the pointed criticism of<br />
Australia's stand on human rights issues?<br />
PM: Someone did tell me about it. Look Australia's human rights record is<br />
as good as any in the world I think. It comes from the deep sense of<br />
democracy in this country. People do have a very tolerant attitude to<br />
one another and respect for one another and that's where that respect<br />
for human values come from and I've really thought it is one of our<br />
great strengths here and abroad.<br />
J: Well, how does it feel, the Bishop of Dill making comments that throw<br />
into question Australia's stand and supposed inconsistencies in<br />
dealing with..<br />
PM: Look, no inconsistencies. We've always been concerned about<br />
violations to human rights and we express our concern forth rightly<br />
whenever we have the opportunity. In the case of Indonesia, the way<br />
to express that concern is in the context of an environment of a broad<br />
relationship that matters to us and matters to Indonesia. I think<br />
throwing stones from a distance doesn't have any impact at all. It's a<br />
matter of whether one wants to be effective in registering ones disquiet<br />
of these things or to feel good about it.<br />
J: Do you think it's quite strange that we are standing on Aboriginal land<br />
as you're saying those things?<br />
PM: Why would it be strange? I mean, that's another thing where I think<br />
Australia's record is second to none. We've just passed into law<br />
that's the Labor Party, and some elements of the Senate one of the<br />
largest pieces of property and cultural law that any government has<br />
ever contemplated which is giving justice to Aboriginal people.<br />
J: Will the skills training that we are going to have full employment, there<br />
has got to be jobs there. How do you answer claims from the<br />
Opposition that you have got to have job creation, if you've got to have<br />
trained people?<br />
PM: Well, you've got to have growth, economic growth, and that's where<br />
the jobs come from as the economic growth of the last year has proven<br />
5 per cent economic growth and 3 per cent employment growth.<br />
There is no substitute for growth, but the Opp osition has always<br />
proven it can't manage a growth economy. Whenever it's around<br />
inflation reares its ugly head and the only way they know to stop<br />
inflation is to kill the growth. They are saying well, growth is terrific,<br />
but it brings inflation so we can't have that so lets not have the growth.<br />
When we don't have the growth we don't have the employment, so it's<br />
no accident that Australia is leading the pack in terms of internationel<br />
change, in terms of international growth rates, in terms of employment </p>
<p>growth and it's in this way that we'll get Australians back to work. We<br />
have already had 150,000 job growth in the last year.<br />
J: Mr Keating, do you agree though with the Reserve Bank's concerns by<br />
limiting home loans and funding for home loans, that that is the way to<br />
control inflation?<br />
PM: There is a relationship there between the Governor and the banks<br />
which is a banks relationship and I'm not privy to all this and that's<br />
what we have a Reserve Bank for to manage this sort of relationship.<br />
ends </p>
