PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P. J. KEATING, MP<br />
DOORSTOP, PARLIAMENT HOUSE, CANBERRA, 13 MARCH 1994<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
J: Prime Minister, do you think the swing t owards the Government is due solely<br />
to Carmen Lawrence?<br />
PM: I think there are two messages here. There is a mark from the public to the<br />
Government for having sensible policies and endorsing a good candidate and there is a<br />
heavy mark against the Coalition foiF-agarbage tin campaign having no structure and<br />
no policies. They are, I think, the two messages.<br />
J: So, you would be expecting something similar for Bonython next week would<br />
you? PM: I think the Government has generally taken its mandate on conscientiously and<br />
done what it could to deliver on the things that we have said matter most; such as<br />
engendering a recovery which we now have; restarting employment growth 200,000<br />
jobs later I tfiik -wecan fairly claim that has started; settl. Iing big nati-ojiji issues like<br />
Mabo and now working on long-term unemployment as well as the ovei r archin-gis-suie<br />
of our place in the world.-These thifigi, 1 -think , the public understand and will mark<br />
the Government sensibly on.<br />
J: What is the message for John Hewson and the Opposition in this?<br />
PM: The first thing is that Malcolm Fraser said it all a week ago when he said a<br />
year after Fightback was essentially denied by Dr Hewson, we don't know what the<br />
Liberal party stands for The Liberal party doesn't have policies and in a campaign<br />
both in Parliament and in the by-election of personal vilification against Dr Lawrence,<br />
where the Liberal party did rip up the rule book, I think, garbage tin politics never<br />
takes you anywhere in Australia and the Australian public is quite wise about all this<br />
stuff. They go right through it to the heart of the matter: and the heart of the matter<br />
was that they thought the Government had done well enough and that Dr Lawrence as<br />
a candidate had the standing to return her with that kind of vote. For Dr Hewson it<br />
means until he decides what his philosophy is and his party's philosophy is and until he<br />
can establish some sort of relativity between that and the community, the Liberal party<br />
will continue to wallow. </p>
<p>J: Prime Minister, who do you think you will be facing as Opposition leader?<br />
PM: It doesn't matter to us who we think. I have already made a comment today<br />
about Mr Howard saying he is not yesterday's man, he is almost last century's man.<br />
Only in Australia if you walked around this country looking for a 35 year old person<br />
with the views of Mr Abbott, only could such a a person bob up in the Liberal party.<br />
And it is this sort of harking back to the Menzian epoch of the 1950s when the world<br />
was completely different, when Australia was essentially a mono-culture, is not and<br />
will do nothing for the Liberal party and for Australia.<br />
J: Do you really think though that the Liberal party is, in fact it sounds like your<br />
saying, consigning itself to the margins of Australian politics.<br />
PM: This has happened to parties periodically right over the course of this century<br />
and I think it is happening with the Liberal party. Mr Howard pushed all of the centre<br />
ground people out of the main stream of the Liberal party and if the Liberal party had<br />
to ask itself a question did Bob Menzies do well in nominating Andrew Peacock as<br />
the young member for Kooyong and did the NSW Liberal party under Mr Carrick's<br />
stewardship do well in putting John Howard into Bennelong: the answer would have<br />
to be a resounding no on both counts because the two of them between them have<br />
rendered the Liberal party almost now an irrelevant organisation. Dr Hewson coming<br />
from a private advisory job and a financial market job to the leadership of a major<br />
political party has proved that you need more qualifications than that to make that<br />
jump. J: Prime Minister, given all the expectation, what do you think the result in<br />
Fremantle says about the Mabo issue?<br />
PM: I think it means that all the foreboding about Mabo, that people who think that<br />
the Australian community have lesser instincts than those that we would like them to<br />
have, Fremantle proves that wrong. That is, that the comnmunity has felt good about<br />
Mabo. By and large they think a good thing has been done and while it has had its<br />
trials and its tribulations and still got teething problems in the application of the<br />
legislation, I think, a result like this in the heartland of Western Australia and Perth<br />
gives lie to the claim that the Western Australian people in some way are biased<br />
against Aboriginal Australians.<br />
J: One year on, are your ambitions for the next few years as great as they were in<br />
terms of Mabo, the economy<br />
PM: One of the things that I most want to do in the next two years is excite young<br />
Australians about their future. And that means their future in the world. And the<br />
Government is getting Australia set, it's getting set, getting Australia set in Asia in<br />
the place where we live, the place where the opportunities are, in the place which<br />
will give Australians interesting secure and well paid jobs. That I think is something<br />
that I'd really like to see happen. As part of that we have now got a tremendous roll<br />
on in getting our links into Asia, and just soon I'll be making a visit to Thailand,<br />
Laos and Vietnam, and later in the year I'll be attending the next APEC leaders'<br />
summit with President Soeharto and President Clinton and others in Jakarta. It is<br />
important I think that Australia's stewardship of APEC, that we keep up the<br />
momentum of change, and that we find when we look at any conversation like this<br />
one year after the next election that Australia is well and truly well placed in the Asia<br />
Pacific, and our community knows it, and is feeling the buoyancy of it. That in the<br />
end is what I think the next couple of years are going to be about. </p>
<p>3<br />
J: You've hinted at a policy job for Carmen Lawrence today and some other<br />
changes. Are we likely to see some changes in the actual structures of the ministry<br />
rather than just the personnel?<br />
PM: You all are well aware now when you move one place in these Cabinets a<br />
whole lot of other places move. Now I'm not proposing in the event that Dr<br />
Lawrence is chosen by the Caucus a major reshuffle of the Cabinet, but it will<br />
obviously mean some changes. But I think Dr Lawrence's standing as a former<br />
Premier, her standing in the Labor Party, and might I say her standing with women<br />
in this country demands that she have a policy job.<br />
J: What sort of policy job?<br />
PM: That I'll tell you later.<br />
J: There is a bit of tidying up to be done though isn't there? The ministry's certainly<br />
not in the same shape it was when the super ministries and so<br />
PM: Because I think things move on. When we had transport and communications<br />
together it made sense at the time, the big issue then was telecommunications reform<br />
and reform in some areas of transport. That is now passed. Communications issues<br />
today are much more finely textured issues. Transport is now changed away from<br />
simply the privatisation of the airlines down to things like rail and road and these<br />
things, and again there are going to be a different set of specialisations. So therefore<br />
the super ministry is not right for now. So I think the country changes, the issues<br />
change, and the structures have to change to accommodate them.<br />
J: Prime Minister are you convinced that Australia can now handle four per cent plus<br />
growth without it spilling into inflation...<br />
PM: I think so. I think that we have broken the back of inflationary expectations,<br />
which is the important thing. That's not to say though that the Government or the<br />
community can be cavalier about inflation. I think we will always need to be vigilant<br />
about inflation. But the notion now that we should put our foot on the brake just<br />
after we've got the economy growing, while we've got a lot of unemployed<br />
resources, or under-employed resources both in people and in capital stock, is too<br />
gloomy a view to be contemplated. And now's the time to actually let the growth.<br />
move through and to take that up, but keeping our eye on inflation as well.<br />
J: What's your message for the markets which don't share your optimism?<br />
PM: In the end the Government will always have a better hold on the productivity<br />
cost inflation picture than the markets will have, because simply we know more<br />
about wages and we know more about what's happening in these particular indices.<br />
And what we have said about inflation over the years has been more right than a lot<br />
of people in the markets have been I think. So what we say is now is not the time to<br />
see interest rates rise, but in saying that, that's not to say they will never rise because<br />
we will always keep a very weather eye on inflation.<br />
