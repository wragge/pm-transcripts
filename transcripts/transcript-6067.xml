PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA Monday, 28 March,_ 1933<br />
During the election campaign I promised to institute a review<br />
of the Parliamentary Contributory Superannuation Scheme.<br />
In particular, the review considered limiting the commutation<br />
of benefits to a lump sum payment.<br />
Restrictions on payment of benefits where beneficiaries were<br />
in receipt of-Government salaries or payments were also<br />
examined.<br />
The review recognised the concern expressed about the level<br />
of some lump sum payments and the potential for larger payments<br />
in the future.<br />
As a result of the review, Cabinet will soon consider a submission<br />
to amend the Parliamentary Contributory Superannuation Act so<br />
that: commutation of the pension to a lump sum payment will<br />
be limited to no more than 50% of the parliamentary<br />
pension;<br />
where a member who has commuted part of his or her<br />
pension dies, the spouse's annuity will be related<br />
to the residual pension and not the pension that<br />
would have been payable had the member not commuted;<br />
the pension or annuity payable to a member of spouse<br />
will be reduced by any salary he or she receives as<br />
the holder of an office of profit under the Crown<br />
( including an office with the Commonwealth, a State<br />
or Local Government or any authority or agency of those<br />
governments) or pension or spouse's annuity arising<br />
therefrom; in this context, the member or spouse will<br />
be required to give notice of taking up, or intending<br />
to take up, any office of profit under the Crown; and<br />
a member who opts to commute part of the pension will<br />
be prevented from accepting an office of profit under<br />
the Crown for a specified period.<br />
After Cabinet has considered the amendments, it is probable that<br />
they will be introduced in the May sittings.<br />
The changes will only apply to M. P.' s retiring from Parliament<br />
after the date of the proclamation. </p>
