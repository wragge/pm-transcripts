PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 29 JANUARY 1991<br />
Cabinet has agreed today to my making a major statement<br />
on the C: overnment's strategy and policies for the medium<br />
and long-term economic development of Australia.<br />
The statement is not a mini-Budget. The statement, to be<br />
given to Parliament on 12 March, will be complemented by<br />
more detailed statements, both in the Parliament and to<br />
the media, by relevant Ministers including details of<br />
specific industry policy measures in a statement by the<br />
Minister for Industry, Tehnology and Commerce, Senator<br />
Button. At my request, portfolio Ministers have been providing me<br />
with ideas for the microeconomic and clever country<br />
agenda to be covered in the statement.<br />
The specific measures for announcement in the statement<br />
will be considered by Cabinet over the coming weeks<br />
commencing next Tuesday.<br />
The Government will not be revealing any further details<br />
of measures until the statement is made.<br />
