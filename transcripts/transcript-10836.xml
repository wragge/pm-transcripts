    <content><![CDATA[<p> Australia will implement a $50 million initiative over the next</p>
<p> three years to assist economies in the region affected by the financial</p>
<p> crisis.</p>
<p>The Economic and Financial Management Initiative will help APEC members</p>
<p> take practical measures to strengthen their economic and financial</p>
<p> management. Improved economic governance, and in particular strong</p>
<p> supervisory and prudential institutions will b vital to achieving</p>
<p> a return to sustainable growth.</p>
<p>Our aid will be target on priority areas identified in an APEC economic</p>
<p> governance survey sponsored by Australia. Examples include training</p>
<p> of central bank officials and technical assistance for prudential</p>
<p> supervision programmes. The initiative will cover programmes in China,</p>
<p> Indonesia, Thailand, The Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Korea and</p>
<p> Papua New Guinea.</p>
<p>The initiative represents a further significant Australian contribution</p>
<p> to overcoming the economic difficulties in our region. It builds on</p>
<p> our contributions to IMF-sponsored packages for Korea, Thailand and</p>
<p> Indonesia and the substantial resources we have made available through</p>
<p> our development cooperation programme.</p>
<p>The initiative underlines Australia's long-term commitment to</p>
<p> the region, and the clear economic and security interest we have in</p>
<p> an early return to growth in East Asia.</p>
<p>The package represents new programmes which will be funded from within</p>
<p> the existing aid budget.</p>
