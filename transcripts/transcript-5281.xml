PRESS OFFICE TRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW WITH BERT NEWTION. OF 3UZ<br />
FRIDAY 29 FEBRUARY 1980<br />
Newton Mr. Fraser you just made a very successful debut on The Don Lane<br />
Show. Have you considered at all perhaps changing roles and<br />
going into variety?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Well if Don will take my job and if he left me with his for a<br />
month, we could swap and see what happened.<br />
Newton Did you enjoy it?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
I enjoyed it very much yes.<br />
Newton It must be rather nice to be confronted with somebody who wants<br />
to get you to public media but not necessarily talk about politics,<br />
not necessarily talk about the government of the day.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Well it is a change and I think it is a happy one because generally<br />
you are talking about, being asked about very serious subjects and<br />
to talk about some other happier things is a very pleasant change.<br />
Newton Just looking around the studios this evening particularly prior to<br />
your arrival, it doesn't happen very often in a television station<br />
that we have so many security people, and so many people who are<br />
here because the Prime minister of our land is about to join us.<br />
Have you ever thought what it's going to be like when you retire<br />
from politics, retire as Prime Minister or otherwise these people<br />
aren't going to be around you. Do you think it's going to be a<br />
very relaxing feeling for you or do you think you'll miss public<br />
life?<br />
Prime minister<br />
I think it will be very relaxing and it will be fun.<br />
How soon do you think you'll be able to relax and enjoy some fun?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Oh I am not contemplating it just at the moment. At the end of last<br />
year when I had a couple of weeks enforced down on the farm I<br />
hadn't been there so long in one stretch for years and I found that<br />
I really enjoyed it. I really got tempted to send a telegram and<br />
say I'm going to stay here mate. .2 </p>
<p>Newton Tell us about the hose episode whilst you were ill there at the<br />
Lodge and is the person still living?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Iramie was going to have a lunch or something and wanted the Lodge<br />
to look nice. So she wanted the windows cleaned. And somebody<br />
went around and shut all the windows and I opened my window and<br />
I was meant to be in bed, so I got back in bed and the water just<br />
came straight through the window. It was a second storey window.<br />
So I don't know if they knew whose bed it was reaching. But when<br />
I got up and yelled out the window.<br />
Newton What did you yell out as a matter of interest?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Well do you want to have your licence taken away?<br />
Newton You have the power to prevent that Mr. Fraser.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
No I don't think so. We've given it to an independent bodyhaven't<br />
we?<br />
Newton Oh that's right. I thought you may forgotten that just for a moment.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
You know they -would be much tougher than we would.<br />
Newiton You were saying on television tonight with Don that you do enjoy<br />
humour. And we've just talked about the fact that it is rather<br />
nice to see the Prime Minister of the country in a non confrontation<br />
setting. In the last couple of days both yourself and Mr. Hayden<br />
have been cast members of most dramatic interviews in Mr.<br />
Hayden's case with John Laws in Sydney with yourself Richard<br />
Carleton on the ABC. Do you believe that public figures and/ or<br />
interviewers now depend primarily on confrontation?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Well they shouldn't no. I think the degree and I said it in the<br />
Parliament yesterday I think that what has happened in the<br />
Parliament and the confrontation in the Parliament were vastly<br />
serious issues, has not done the Parliament any good. I believe<br />
overwhelmingly, Australians would have been ashamed listening in<br />
to the debated when they found their legislators arguing about the<br />
sort of trivia that was taking the time of the Parliament when<br />
there were enormous issues at stake which ultimately and without<br />
dramatising it, the independence, the survival, the integrity of<br />
nations and people depends. And it ought to be possible as it is </p>
<p>Prime Minister ( continued)<br />
inf Britain, as it is in the United States and other places to debate<br />
this sensibly without personalities just looking at the issues.<br />
And I think it ought to be possible to do it on television or on<br />
radio also without debating personalities and motives just talking<br />
about the issues. And for some reason it seems very difficult to<br />
do that in Australia.<br />
' Newton<br />
Tuesday aside, in most cases both sides of the House are at fault<br />
with cat calling and name calling. What do you say to your blokes<br />
after an incident such as Tuesday?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
We try and keep them quiet. I think by and large they are not too<br />
bad. I do not want to try to lay blame for the sort of things that<br />
have gone on. But I would invite anyone who wants to try and made<br />
a judgment about what has gone on what I am going to suggest is<br />
very dull, but I would just get them to read Hansard and some of<br />
those debates.' Then I think they will learn a great deal<br />
about some of the speakers who have participated.<br />
Newton It just seems that listening to Parliament now that very seldom do<br />
you really have a full House unless it's opening day, fewer<br />
members seem to be in the House, at any one time unless there's<br />
something of great significance. Does this mean we're moving<br />
toward an executive controlling our country and running our country<br />
eventually. Prime Minister<br />
No I don't think so. It has always been like that. Members of<br />
Parliament hc--ve work to do, correspondence to answer, people to<br />
se, departments to approach on behalf of constituents or something<br />
they are interested in and all this goes on while the Parliament<br />
is actually sitting. So if a member is not interested in a<br />
particular debate, he probably will not be in the House in the<br />
Parliament itself for that debate. He will be in his office or<br />
somewhere else talking with people. And it has always gone on like<br />
that. When you are a stranger to the place you go in and you see<br />
somebody speaking on a subject which is important to the speaker<br />
and to other people out in the community a mere handful in the<br />
Parliament you wonder what it is all about. But there is no<br />
change in that and I think it will always be so.<br />
Newton As a matter of interest who tells you to get in there, if you should<br />
be in the Parliament I mean it's quite easy to understand that<br />
ministers can be suggested by more senior people like yourself.<br />
But who suggests to you, you should be in the House if something<br />
rises? Prime Minister<br />
Oh I do. 4<br />
-I </p>
<p>Newton You have your ear tuned all the time to what's happening in the<br />
House or you have<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Somebody either the Leader of the House for the Government or<br />
somebody in my office will say look something is happening in<br />
the House, you ought to be in there, or if I am scheduled to<br />
participate in something, they will say you are on in three<br />
minutes or you are on in five minutes or you better start moving.<br />
I'm nudged. I am put in the right place.<br />
Newton You're nudged but not pushed?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Oh it depends how quickly I move.<br />
Newton And who is nudging.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
That is right yes.<br />
Newton OK, given that maybe Tuesday is an exception and given that perhaps<br />
the Parliament has not always been filled over the years, I think<br />
you'd agree that in latter years particularly since you and Gough<br />
Whitlam came head on, firstly as Prime Minister in his case and<br />
Leader of the Opposition in your case, the roles were reversed<br />
perhaps because you're both very big men you're both quite unique<br />
men. I would suggest there's not another Gough Whitlam. in Australia<br />
and there's not another Malcolm Fraser in Australia, either in<br />
appearance or in attitudes and delivery it seemed then that<br />
Parliament started to take a different turning and I'm not blaming<br />
you and Mr. Whitlam. for the violence. I don't know who started it<br />
but there was a personal honing in on the other wasn't there?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
I think there might have been a bit. But that also isn't new. I<br />
first listened in to the Parliament in the middle 1950s when the<br />
Labor Party split and you had first the Labor Party anti communists,<br />
with about nine members in the Parliament. And every day, day after<br />
day that group of mine would get up and attack them the rest of<br />
the Labor Party. And the rest of the Labor Party would return the<br />
fire. And if people really want to know what a bitter debate is<br />
all about, go and read some of those debates and it would make what's<br />
happened in recent times look like kindergarten. It really would.<br />
All I'm saying is that it is not an excuse for it, it's not a new<br />
phenomenon. At different stages in the Australian Parliament there<br />
has been a great deal of bitterness and even venom. I think it is<br />
a tragedy. I think the people in Australia deserve much better than<br />
that. </p>
<p>Newton Is it native to Australia that we seem, unlike America, once an<br />
Election has been run and won, we don't close ranks neither the<br />
Liberal voter nor the Labor voter closes ranks. They don't get<br />
behind their Prime Minister. Is this a good or a bad thing?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
.1 would hope that it depends on the issue. If there is a major<br />
issue and an important issue, I would hope that the nation would<br />
. be behind the Prime Minister, whoever it might be. I am not just<br />
there to govern for liberal supporters or National Party supporters.<br />
My job is to govern with all my own team as well as possible as well<br />
as I can, for all Australians Liberal, Labor or whatever. I<br />
think a recognition ought to flow through from the policies and<br />
attitudes that a Government expresses. It shows quite clearly that<br />
it is a Government of all the people, not just of one section or<br />
of one group.<br />
Newton Just one question on Moscow. It would appear that the country is<br />
divided who is to say whether it's 50/ 50 or 60/ 40 in either favour,<br />
but would you consider a referendum?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
I don't think you can make important decisions by referendum. I<br />
really don't. Ultimately it is going to have to be the Australian<br />
Olympic Committee that will have to make up their mind. We are<br />
not going to use the methods of the Soviets and withhold passports<br />
and this sort of thing and that would be using their methods.<br />
It is not something that we in our society ought to contemplate.<br />
So it is a question of persuasion and therefore trying to have as<br />
many people as possible understand the consequences and the triumph<br />
that they could well give the Soviet Union if Australian and<br />
A~ merican and British and French and German athletes go to Moscow.<br />
They are not going as individuals. They are not going as Bert<br />
Newton or John Smith or whatever. They go as representatives of<br />
their country. And with the sort of attitude that the Soviets have<br />
taken to it, saying as they have that the awarding of the Games is<br />
a political success. It is a social event and it is one which<br />
shows that all those participating approve our policies and our<br />
foreign policies. Against that background it is very hard to<br />
we can't say that politics and sport are separate they are not.<br />
They are so mixed up together. I think this is one of the things<br />
that athletes find hard to understand. They would like to keep it<br />
separate. But people in other places have already mixed them very<br />
much. Newton You keep talking about the eventual decision to be made by the<br />
Olympic Federation. The Government has the power to prevent the<br />
team from going.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
By withholding passports yes.<br />
Newton Would you go that far?. 6 </p>
<p>Prime Minister<br />
No we have said we would not. We do not believe we should use the<br />
methods the Soviets would use. That is a sort of arbitrary thing.<br />
I don't think short of war time, short of sometimes people don't<br />
get a passport to go out of the country if you think they are<br />
going to bomb somebody or something in some other country. In that<br />
category passports can be and have been sometimes withheld. But<br />
for a citizen wanting to go about his business it would be unthinkable<br />
to withhold an Australian passport. And we are not going to do it.<br />
Newton This week, just harking back to the interview that Mr. Hayden had<br />
with John Laws about which, of course, I wouldn't ask you to comment,<br />
but also the interview that you had with Richard Carleton it would<br />
be fair to say that in both cases you would seem to have lost your<br />
cool, both gentlemen. Do you think that how hard is it for you<br />
now under the pressure you must be feeling because of the Moscow<br />
situation... Prime Minister<br />
You didn't see that thing with Richard Carleton?<br />
Newton No I didn't -no.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
I thought it was very quiet and very cool. I really did. I think<br />
anyone who saw it did too.<br />
Newton But there's cool and cool isn't there? Were you as cool as you<br />
were with Mike Willesee?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
It depends which interview.<br />
Newton Yes I saw you interviewed by Mike one evening and he said ' good<br />
evening' and you said ' what do you mean by that'.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Did I?<br />
Newton Yes you did.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Well it must have been one of my more acidy moments. No I thought<br />
I really was. I didn't get annoyed at Richard Carleton. I didn't<br />
feel annoyed because I have been interviewed by him so often. I<br />
do a little work before I didn't do any work because this was<br />
almost by surprise and anyway I thought you might have been safe.<br />
But with Richard Carleton, if he has spoken on a subject, I read </p>
<p>Prime Minister ( continued)<br />
what he has said the night before and the night before that and I<br />
had. So I knew exactly the line he was going to take. I had<br />
worked out in my own mind that he would not ask me the questions<br />
that would enable me to say what I wanted to say. So I was going<br />
to say what I wanted to say in any case, in spite of the questions.<br />
Newton I think I'm with you. What's the standard of political journalism<br />
like in Australia today judging on world standards?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Well I don't see all that much. What I do see of the British and<br />
American journalism is probably the best of it the articles that<br />
come out here it's not the froth and the bubble. In Australia<br />
of course we see it all. There are some journalists who can get<br />
beneath it and understand the substance of events that are occurring.<br />
There are others that seem more concerned with the froth and the<br />
bubble. They won't go to the seriousness of the issue to show the<br />
debate the presence to them is everything, not so much the<br />
substance of the issue that is being discussed. I think the way<br />
they report it politicians are principally responsible but the<br />
way they report it helps I think to personalise politics in the<br />
Parliament. Because this is the sort of thing that journalists<br />
like reporting.<br />
Newton Do you have your favourites among the journalists?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Well obviously but I wouldn't want to name them because that would<br />
destroy them.<br />
Newton You just guessed my next question. Mr. Fraser, I thank you very<br />
much indeed for your time. I realise that you spent a lot of<br />
time with Don on camera. I thank you for coming round and spending<br />
this time with me. Just to end up a question out of the blue.<br />
Have you ever voted Labor? Thank you Mr. Fraser.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
You would have been very surprised at the answer.<br />
Newton OK, I'll turn this tape off now. It's off.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
It's still going.<br />
Newton On Arthur Caldwell's memory I promise it's on. Thank you very<br />
much indeed Mr. Fraser. Yes it is on. 9 </p>
