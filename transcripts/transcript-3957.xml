PRESS STATEI2ENT BY THE MVINISTER FOR NORTHERN AUSTRALIA<br />
MVR PAUL KEATING, M. P. Canberra 4 November 1975<br />
BURDEKIN BASIN INVESTIGATIONS<br />
The Minister for Northern Australia, Mr Paul<br />
Keating, said today that investigations into the potential<br />
for development in the Burdekin Basin region of north<br />
Queensland were nearing completion.<br />
" The program of investigations, now in its third<br />
year, is under the supervision of the joint Federal/ State<br />
Burdekin Projects Committee".<br />
" Particular attention had been paid to an assessment<br />
of potential future commitments of the water resources of the<br />
Basin for industrial, urban, irrigation and power purposes,<br />
and for flood mitigation. The development potential of the<br />
large coal reserves in the Burdekin Basin is alsn receiving<br />
considerable attentinn".<br />
" The-se investigations have involved engineering and<br />
hydrological studies, while soil surveys and field trials<br />
have been undertaken for an assessment of the potential of<br />
unproven soils in the lower Burdekin for intensive agricultural<br />
development., The environmental consequences of further<br />
industrial development in the Basin are also under study.<br />
Consultants have been engaged where necessary, particularly<br />
with regard to industrial processing investigations".<br />
M~ r Keating said that the Burdekin Basin, an area<br />
of 130,000 square kilometers, was well provided with<br />
infrastructure facilities and these would contribute<br />
significantly to future large-scale development in the region.<br />
The Burdekin Project Steering Committee met in<br />
Brisbane on 3 November to discuss progress of the program of<br />
investigations and other requirements for a report to be<br />
completed next year. </p>
