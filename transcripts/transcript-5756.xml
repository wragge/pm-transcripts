FOR MEDIA MONDAY, FEBRUARY 22 1982<br />
PRE-BUDGET CONSULTATIONS<br />
As in past years, the Government will be holding pre-Budget<br />
consultations over the next three months with key bodies to<br />
seek their views and ideas in the context of the preparation<br />
of the Federal Budget for 1982/ 83.<br />
The meetings will provide organisations and Ministers with the<br />
opportunity for a frank exchange of views on the State of the<br />
economy and discussion of appropriate Budgetary policy measures.<br />
The Government believes that these annual-meetings are extremely<br />
beneficial to both the Government and private organisations.<br />
The consultations have been scheduled early in the budgetary<br />
process so that organisations may have maximum input into the<br />
formation of this year's budget.<br />
A diverse range of organisations will be attending the<br />
consultations, representing a wide spectrum of business, trade<br />
union and coirmunity groups. A full list of the organisations<br />
attending the consultations is attached.<br />
