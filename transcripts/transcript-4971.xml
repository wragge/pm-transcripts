SENATOR WRIEDT INTERVIEWqED ON MR. PEACOCK'S FOREIGN POLICY<br />
STATEMENT IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.<br />
FROM ABC'S 27/ 2/ 79<br />
Huw Evans:<br />
Senator, to what extent are you in accord with Mr. Peacock's<br />
with Mr. Peacock's analysis, particulary in relation to<br />
South East Asia.<br />
Wriedt: The Chinese themselves of course have said that the reason that<br />
they have invaded Vietnam is in order to punish Vietnam. They<br />
have not said precisely why they what to punish Vietnam. It may<br />
be because of theinvasion of Kampuchea. It may be because of<br />
the treatment of ethnic Chinese by the Vi6tnamese Government.<br />
It may be because of the border dispute between the two countries.<br />
It may be because of the alliance between Vietnam and the Soviet<br />
Union. It is probably a mixture of those things but quite<br />
obviously China has taken it upon itself to exercise its unilateral<br />
judgement to punish Vietnam. I don't think one can isolate any<br />
of those factors.<br />
Huw Evans:<br />
But the Opposition has taken the view, has it not,' that the<br />
Government is taking a pro-Chinese line in this issue?<br />
Wriedt: That was evident from the statement put down by the Prime Minister<br />
back in June of 1976 and this point should be stressed again and<br />
again. The Prime Minister is wanting now to appear as some sort<br />
of mediator on the world scene. He should have thought about<br />
trying to play that role two and a half years ago when he made it<br />
quite clear that the Australian Government would in fact be<br />
taking a pro-China attitude in the Sino-Soviet dispute. One cannot<br />
divorce that dispute from the events which are taking place<br />
now between Vietnam and China, and indeed Kampuchea.<br />
Huw Evans:<br />
What does it have, in terms of an affect in world policy though?<br />
I m~ ean that we have aligned ourselves presumably with the United<br />
States, the western powers, those countries who have sided with<br />
China, presumably, against the Soviet Union?<br />
Wriedt: The operative word, siding with China, of course is the key point.<br />
It is a tendency of course, of nations to take sides in international<br />
disputes and as soon as you do that, particularly when you are<br />
dealing with the major powers, there is a tendency for the world<br />
to polarise into opposite sides. The more nations that do not allow<br />
themselves to become involved in either side, the greater force they<br />
are to acting collectively as mediators between the warring factions.<br />

27 FEBRUARY 1979 </p>
<p>-2-<br />
Wriedt: Australia opted out of that role two and half years ago.<br />
I'm certain now Mr. Fraser wishes he had not done that.<br />
Huw Evans<br />
Aren't there polarisations within the Labor movement itself<br />
as to who is right and wrong in this dispute?<br />
Wriedt: In every party you will find differences of opinion but we have<br />
taken a firm view, and I think this is substantiated by the<br />
debates which have taken place today in the Parliament, in both<br />
houses, that we are taking an even-handed view. We want'<br />
Australia act in a genuine capacity of a nation that has the<br />
trust of both sides. That is the distinction between our position<br />
and that of the Government.<br />
Huw Evans:<br />
Can we have a look at one of the other major issues that Mr. Peacock<br />
has referred to today, and that is the question of Australia's<br />
assessment and reaction to the change of Government in Iran.<br />
Would Labor have responded any differently to what happened there<br />
than the present Government.<br />
Wriedt: I don't think Chat we are in a position to effect that. The<br />
Iranian people will decide what form of Government evolves from<br />
the present dispute within Iran. It's not the role of us or<br />
the Australian Government to try and dictate the course, or influence<br />
the course of those events.<br />
Huw Evans:<br />
Isn't it fair though, that Iranian exports of oil may well dictate<br />
the res-Donse of western countries to the new Government.<br />
Wriedt: Naturally all the traditional customers of Iran will wish to see<br />
Iranian oil. back on the world markets as soon as possible. But<br />
I would have grave reservations about the comment which is contained<br />
in Mr. Peacock's statement in which he suggests the ' west may need<br />
to take certain action to protect itself in respect of the<br />
Iranian rroblem. I don't know quite what he means by that, but<br />
I cert-ainiv. would disassociate ourselves with any implication, or<br />
any implied remark that any intervention should take place in<br />
Iran by any outside powers whatsoever. 000---</p>
