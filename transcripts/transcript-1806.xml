FOR PRESS: PM. No. 37/ 1968<br />
DEATH OF SIR WILLIAM ANDERSON<br />
Tribute by the Prime Minister, Mr John Gorton<br />
The sudden death of Sir William Anderson the Honorary<br />
Federal Treasurer of the Liberal Party is a great loss for the Party,<br />
for me and for all of his many friends and colleagues in the political<br />
field. He was a great Liberal, one of the architects of the<br />
Liberal Party in 1949 which has done so much for Australia, and<br />
organisationally was a key man in the party. He will be sadly missed.<br />
To Lady Anderson, my wife and I and members of the<br />
Federal Parliamentary Liberal Party extend our deepest sympathy.<br />
CANBERRA, March, 1968 </p>
