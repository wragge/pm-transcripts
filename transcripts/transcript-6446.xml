P. M. cont...<br />
bipartisanship about the questions of immigration, and I see<br />
no reason why we can't resume that position.<br />
JOURNALIST: Why don't you, Prime Minister, then just simply<br />
instruct the members of your parliamentary party anyway, not<br />
to raise the issue and not to debate it at all.-<br />
Well, I think, Trevor you will see that from our side of<br />
politics we won't be injecting this into the political and<br />
electoral situation.<br />
JOURNALIST: How would you achieve that?<br />
Well leave that to me.<br />
JOURNALIST: Were you impressed With John Howard's speech?<br />
Yes.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, you said earlier in the week that you and<br />
Bill Hayden were in total accord on the issue specifically of<br />
U. S. bases in Australia following his comments in Geneva.<br />
Yes.<br />
JOURNALIST: Are you in total accord generally on ALP policy?<br />
I would think an examination of the record,, George, over<br />
a long period -including when Bill was Leader of the Oppositionwould<br />
show that there have been very very few issues of domestic<br />
or international politics on which there has been a divergence<br />
between Bill and myself. And indeed that has been a matter of<br />
comment by many people that there really hasn't been ideological<br />
arguments between Bill and myself. There was the question of<br />
leadership, but I have received from Bill Hayden since he has<br />
become Minister total support. In the development of initiatives<br />
in the foreign policy area, there has been. gull co-operation between<br />
Bill and myself, For instance very soon after we came into office,<br />
I told him when he was going on his first visit to Indonesia<br />
and the question of Indo-China was to come up that I had the<br />
view that because we in Australia had a unique position of<br />
relationships not only with the ASEAN countries, but with China<br />
and a capacity to talk to Vietnam, and good relations with the<br />
United States, that I thought.: we could play some sort of role<br />
not overstating it-through this range of contacts and good relations,<br />
to try and develop some initiative there of moving towards a<br />
resolution of this tragic situation. And Bill accepted that artd<br />
he hasI think,, excellently pursued that course. So it will be a<br />
pretty barren exercise for you,, George, if you try and look for<br />
significant areas of difference between Bill and myself.-<br />
JOURNALIST: If, as you say., there are no significant ideological<br />
differences between you and Bill Hayden, why did the Centre Left<br />
come into existence and why is Bill Hayden regarded as the<br />
titular head of that group. It's-because they disagree with you<br />
basically. .13 </p>
<p>3.<br />
P. M. No.-wellthe facts, as usual, dispute your assumptions and it.' s<br />
a good idea to look at the facts rather than develop your<br />
assumptions well at least to check your assumptions against.-<br />
the facts. The statements of the Centre Left, which have been.<br />
made from the beginning, have been in terms of support for me,<br />
my positions and my leadership. Now statements may not be enough,<br />
so we have to check statements against facts. And it is the<br />
fact that at the ALP National Conference, that on every issue<br />
which I had been developing over the months they supported me..<br />
For instance uranium, the entry of foreign banks, basic economic<br />
policy. On all of those issues the Centre Left supported me.<br />
Now again thirdly, let's check the statement and the facts against<br />
the reactions of others. What did others, the Left say? The<br />
Left attacked the Centre Left because they had been,-it was said,<br />
tame supporters of the Prime Minister. So, you have their<br />
statements, you have their actions and ydui have the assessments<br />
of the other factions.<br />
JOURNALIST: I have to repeat, if they don't disagree with you,<br />
if they don't regard themselves as being to your left that's<br />
why they called themselves the Centre, Left, why did they come<br />
into existence? Oh well, that's another question and the answer I think<br />
is fairly straight forward.. If you look at the history of the<br />
Labor Party, in particular in a National Conference context .' over<br />
the past, what you had is, if you like, the NSW Right'-I use<br />
the descriptions that are easily applied, I don't accept the<br />
accuracy of labels, but people know what we are talking about<br />
the NSW Right) j and you've had the Victorian nen,'-socialist Left.<br />
And they have tended to adopt their positions as against the<br />
Left and the people in the other states. South Australia, Western:<br />
Australia, Queensland, Tasmania have tended not to be organised<br />
and have come along with the non-Left generally in support of the<br />
more organised grouping in NSW and Victoria. And they have<br />
regarded, in my judgement understandably, that they have had<br />
a lack of identity and have been residuals in the process.<br />
And that's been true not only at the National Conferqnce, but<br />
to some extent in the Caucus. And I can understand an attempt:<br />
to get some sort of ohesivenessa amongst that group. From the<br />
very beginning you will know that publicly and privately I have<br />
not condemned its formation, I have not seen it as a threat and<br />
I think they have been useful. Indeed at the National Conference,<br />
while we would have won on uranium even if the Centre Left<br />
hadn't been formed, the fact that they were formed enabled a<br />
certain amount of cobesiveness. and discipline amongst-itheir<br />
group to produce the slightly larger majority than perhaps<br />
we otherwise would have had.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, if we lookatthe history of the<br />
Labor Party one thing that concerns every Labor leader is<br />
divisiveness and factional disputation. Now you're getting<br />
signs of that being a problem with the pre-selections for the<br />
new seats. Is that concerning you? / 14 </p>
<p>4.<br />
I would, and any Labor Leader would always, I guess,<br />
particularly in a per-election period have no bubbles(?), and<br />
it would be quite dishonest to say other wise. But I accept<br />
the fact that now we have in Australia a Federal Labor Government<br />
and four State Labor Governments and they have come to office<br />
in the historical situation of factions within the Party. But,<br />
importantly, in addition to what we have delivered federally,<br />
the state Governments have delivered the goods. And the peoplemade<br />
the judgements about alternative Governments on the basis<br />
of performance and if you want to again take the question of<br />
comparison if you look at the coalition parties.-the real deep<br />
differences of ideologies are not confined to the Labor Party,<br />
they are becoming increasingly apparent oD the side of the<br />
conservative coalition. Now...<br />
JOURNALIST: I'm sorry, do you think the pre-selections are going<br />
well. In NSW, in particular, it seems that the candidates<br />
coming through are to the left of the position that you would like<br />
to see. Well, I don't accept that Robert. We've got not merely the<br />
existing seats, but the new seats. And it would be my<br />
judgement that in total, as far as NSW is concerned, when the<br />
preselections are finished that, if you like as between the<br />
Left and the more central position that I occupy, the balance<br />
would be from NSW after the election more my way.<br />
JOURNALIST: Do you see problems for yourself in being perceived as a<br />
Government thiat's a Labor Government that's cuddling up too close to<br />
business, that you're seen as the friends of business and that the<br />
Left will sell that as; you having sold out to business.<br />
P. M. Well, I thi-nk that it's perhaps summned up in an article<br />
in yesterday's Sydney Morning Herald by Ross Gittins. I'm sorry<br />
about mentioning the opposition but the heading was good<br />
Paul does care but the trendies are last to know. I'll just<br />
quickly read two paragraphs of it which make the point. " Paul<br />
Keading may not look like a bleeding heartbut his Budget confounds<br />
middle income-earners at the expense of the poor, thereby<br />
abandoning traditional Labor values in the interests of their base<br />
political ambition. The new conventional wisdom that Bob and Paul have<br />
got into bed with big business and big unions and are screwing down<br />
on the very people Labor is supposed to protect contains a large<br />
deposit of codswallop." This mistaken view--is being vigorously.-<br />
propogated. It's said by Labor's own left wing," although I don't<br />
think it is true " small-L Liberals in the Melbourne press and the<br />
trendy lefties who have overrun that formerly sensible organisation,<br />
the Australian Council of Social Service." And Gittins, as do<br />
others, goes ahead and analyses what in fact has happened under<br />
18 months of my Labor Government, which has seen a significant<br />
improvement in the welfare conditions of those most in need<br />
in the country. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: The businessmen also seem to think that you are<br />
friend of theirs though, have they been duped?<br />
And you see, you have put your finger on the great truth<br />
of the success of this Government. What I have tried to convey<br />
to the people of Australia and to the trade unions and to business<br />
and to those who depend upon social welfare is that they should<br />
not see themselves as competing interests. The fundamental truth<br />
which I have tried to get the Australian People to grasp and which<br />
I think they overwhelmingly do, is that the.-interest of business<br />
and unions and the social welfare group are not to be seen as<br />
contradictory. What is most likely to happen is that they are<br />
all going to benefit;-business, workers and social beneficiaries<br />
if we co-operate together-increase economic growth, increase<br />
employment. Now the facts are th~ ere. We have achieved the highest<br />
rate of economic growth in the western world-. We have achieved<br />
the highest increase in employment, it will be 400,000 new.. jobs<br />
by June of next year. And we have produced falling inflation and<br />
falling interest rates. Now, in the resuLt, business profitability<br />
is up back to the highest levels, as a proportion, for the decade.<br />
The trade union movement has got secured real levels of disposable<br />
income, they have increased. And the beneficiaries have got the<br />
situation where they had real-reductions in their benefits under<br />
7 years of conservative rule very substantial increases in their<br />
real benefits under us. So the truth is that business benef its frm us,<br />
workers benefit from us and social beneficiaries benefit from us.<br />
We have put behind us fighting one another, we.! re getting the<br />
truth understood that if we co-operate together each group will<br />
benefit. JOURNALIST: You seem quite convinced that t~ he traditional Labor<br />
supporter understands that are you still with him?<br />
Well, all I can say, all I can say,, George, as distinct:<br />
from conjuring up assumptions in the back of my mind-as you appear<br />
to do, I prefer to look at the evidence. I~ t is always the sensible<br />
thing to do. All I can say is that in the admirable publication<br />
over which Trevor Kennedy presides, the Bulletin which puts a<br />
regular testing apparatus out on the views of people consistently<br />
I have the support of over 90% of Labor voters.<br />
JOURNALIST: Do you think you are a. bit sensitive to the reaction<br />
of this Budget?<br />
No. I don't. I believe that my job as Prime Minister is;<br />
to explain the Budget and if mistaken criticism is made, and there<br />
has been very little of it.-overwhelmingly it has been a positive<br />
response to this Budgetr but where some commentators have misunderstoo(<br />
the facts about the increase and the level of tax receipts, then<br />
I have had to explain that. And I must say to the credit of those<br />
involved, and I won't name names, that when I have pointed the<br />
mistake of their analysis and that in fact the increase in tax<br />
receipts is fundamentally aL reflection of the enormous growth.<br />
in the economy they have understood that and accepted it.<br />
JOURNALIST: Well as a commentator we appreciate the help that you<br />
give us, but you bit a journalists head off in Melbourne the<br />
other day and then had to back-track and concede that his figures<br />
were right and you were wrong.<br />
* 4 </p>
<p>P. M. Don ' t let'Is be elliptical about this. You are referring to<br />
Max Walsh, and I didn't bite his head off. What in fact happened<br />
is that Max on Budget night referred to -the 23% increase in irne<br />
tax receipts and I pointed out that in fact the figure that<br />
you had to look at was the 10.7% in PAYE earnings. And'tha-t wh-en you<br />
looked at that, that was explained precisely by the two factorsof<br />
the 7 %. increase in average weekly earnings, a 34% increase<br />
in employment-and that in fact if we hadn't made the tax cuts<br />
that we did that increase would not have been 10.7%, but 15.8%.<br />
And Max to his credit accepted that analysis.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Prime Minister isn't there some justification<br />
for criticism of the tax cuts given that statistics have shown<br />
that about one million Australians will move into a higher tax<br />
bracket next year.<br />
P. M4.: No, there's not. The facts of course are on that,. that<br />
with growth in incomes it is inevitable that you have moves<br />
in brackets. The thing to understand that is that an enourmous<br />
number of people, more than a million, wi. be in a lower tax<br />
bracket with the introduction of the 25 cent step. And on<br />
balance the great majority of taxpayers are going to be better off.<br />
JOURNALIST: But, the way . the Budget is currently being sold.<br />
surely is that this is of long standing benefit for Australians at<br />
large.-which it isn't. li<br />
On the contrary, it is.. I mean just let'. s look at<br />
some of the facts which we can put to refute the sort of attitude<br />
of the opposition who are trying to put this proposition.<br />
If you look at PAYE tax collections as a percentage of GDP<br />
and that's what you've got to do whether you are getting the<br />
economy growing or not are there more . people in jobs and therefore<br />
paying tax' wasthretinhip of the tax take to what's<br />
happening in the economy. In the last two years of our opponents<br />
Trevor, the proportion that net PAYE was of gross domestic product,<br />
was 11.7% in 81/ 82, 11.5% in 82/ 83 and in our two years 83/-84 itY has<br />
come down to 10.6 and 10.9%. Now we are not able to be criticised<br />
for the fact that we have got the economy growing. The function<br />
of growth is that the Government receives more revenue, because<br />
by the end of next year, next financial year Trevor, by June<br />
there will be 400,000 more Australians in work than we came to<br />
office. So that instead of outlays on unemployment benefits<br />
for a growing army of unemployed we have now transformed the economy<br />
where many many more people are in work and they are making<br />
contributions. Now that is the factual situation and it is the<br />
case that the tax cuts that we have given represent much more than<br />
full indexation.<br />
JOURNALIST: So are you saying then, that -there are not people out<br />
there who are going to gain by the tax cuts and then lose next<br />
year when they move into the higher bracket? ./ 7 </p>
<p>As people move into higher brackets always it means that. the<br />
marginal dollar will be more under the higher bracket than it wras<br />
before. But it is a function of growth in. income. It's the same<br />
way that we are receiving much more in company tax very very much<br />
more in company tax than before. The reason why we are doing that<br />
is that company income has grown dramatically. And if you ask<br />
the businessman what does he prefer as a position one where he<br />
is paying less tax because he has got less income or because hi~ s<br />
business is growing he pays more tax.-he'll tell you what the<br />
answer is. Now we don't pretend George that the present tax scales<br />
are perfect because if I wanted to say to youthat that was the case<br />
it would be dishonest. But what we have done is to try and introduce<br />
elements into the tax scale now which ensure greater equity.<br />
You see if we had followed the system of our predecessors when they<br />
talked about tax benefits what they did meant that you three:<br />
people and me people on higher incomes we got far and away the<br />
biggest benefit. While those at the lower and middle level of income<br />
got less. Now we happen to think that in this society that WE! are<br />
trying to build -whiere we are working together-we are trying t~ o<br />
have growth and equity, it was sensible to introduce the two<br />
new steps into the tax scale which meant that in terms of the 1.3<br />
billion that we had judged we had available for tax cuts~ that I t<br />
meant that those at the lower and middle level got a greater benefit.<br />
And I happen to have that faith in our fellow Australians that<br />
they approve of that arrangement.<br />
JOURNALIST: The end result Prime Minister of.. everything-. that we<br />
are trying to do with economic Poli~ cy with the accord and growth<br />
and business investment is to get unemployment really down?<br />
Yes. Yes.<br />
JOURNALIST: Now Ralph Willis seems to be talking about us<br />
accommodating ourselves and becoming used to a Iong-term. unemploymenrt rate<br />
of around about now isn't that the fundamental problem that.-<br />
you have that you can't get the unemployment down.<br />
No, Ralph is not talking about that as a long-term level.<br />
We have been able to get the unemployment down -as you know<br />
by about 1 percentage points approximately 10.3% to 8.8%,<br />
in a relatively short. And the Budget assumes a further slight<br />
reduction in unemployment in 84/ 85.<br />
JOURNALIST: Some people would say that these are very modest...<br />
Well some people would also say that it is an unbelievable<br />
improvement on seven years of conservatism. In the last..<br />
JOURNALIST: Wasn't it only a slight reduction though.<br />
Well, in 84/ 85 we are talking about a reduction which,<br />
well let me put it the other way-through the year we are looking<br />
ata3 roughly increase in employment. Now if you assume that<br />
the labour force grows and the figure is about 1.7/ 1.8% growth<br />
in the labour force you are looking at the possibility of a further<br />
reduction of the order of 1% plus. Now what we are saying is that<br />
the essential thing was what we have done already that is<br />
to stop the explosion of unemployment. The explosion of one<br />
quarter of a million in unemployment that took place in the last<br />
twelve months before we came into office, we' 1ve stopped that ./ 8<br />
'-p </p>
<p>P. M. cont:<br />
we've delivered our promise. I said that we would stop the<br />
explosion of unemployment, we'd create jobs and over three years<br />
we'd create half a million new jobs.<br />
JOURNALIST: Now, just a minute I just want to make it clear that your<br />
first steps have got to be the turn around we've done that and'<br />
we are ahead of that target that we promised the people of half' a<br />
million new jobs in our first three years. Now the important thing<br />
Robert and you correctly put your finger on how we've got to be!<br />
looking in the longer-term, ykou've got tc make the right basic<br />
decisions about the structure of the Australian economy, your education<br />
system and your trading relationships which will give you confidence<br />
through the longer period through-a coherent and cohesive<br />
combination of proper macroeconomic policies and education policies<br />
and restructuring and trading relationships that you are going to<br />
offer the opportunity of a gradual reduction through time. And.<br />
that's all I am promising, I have delivered every promise I have<br />
made about employment and unemployment and that is directed in the<br />
longer stage to gradually bringing down those levels and we will do<br />
it.<br />
JOURNALIST: Is this country going to see full employment again in<br />
our lives? I don't think, Robertthat we will ever see a restoration<br />
of what characterised that first generation after the war which<br />
was that in this country you had more jobs available than people<br />
to fill them. That's not going to come back. So what as-,&amp;=_. spciety<br />
we've got-and this is where the emphasis upon education is so<br />
important-and why we've had the participation and equity program<br />
and the continuation of that, the creation of another 30,000 hew.<br />
places in the tertiary sector in the next few years, We've got<br />
to make our education system relevant to the nature of the economy<br />
that is developing., so that the people who are coming through into<br />
the workforce are going to have the best possible chance of being<br />
equipped to fill the sorts of jobs that a.. changing economy is going<br />
to provide. And it will be an inevitable feature of our life into<br />
the future that working time will decrease. That has been the<br />
characteristic of history and with the rapid improvements in<br />
technology it will become more so. So what as a society we-havegot<br />
to do is to have our education system making our people best<br />
equipped to be able to fill the increasing number of jobs that will<br />
be available. but also that they are going -to be able, all of us, to<br />
accommodate ourselves to less time involved in the work-place.<br />
JOURNALIST: Have you any figure in mind, say 5% by 1990 or something<br />
that you can offer us?<br />
I don't think it's useful to put a figure on it now. I<br />
think what I ought to do is what I have done. In February/ March of<br />
' 83 I made specific promises. I said I'll stop the explosion<br />
of unemployment, we've done that. I said we will create more jo: bs,,<br />
get employment growing, and I took a three year period then and<br />
I thought it reasonable then to say that I could promise a half<br />
million jobs in three years. You will recall Trevor that when<br />
made those promises people pooh-poohed me. Now we are ahead of<br />
target so what I am saying now and I will be more specific in the<br />
election campaign when it arises. I will carefully say to the ./ 9<br />
V 1. 1 </p>
<p>P. M. cant.<br />
Australian people look I have delivered these promises,<br />
these are the sorts of things that I think I can promise in the<br />
near future. But importantly what I am able to say to the Australian<br />
people is that we are directing ourselves to those sorts of<br />
considerations that Robert Haupt referred to, and that is<br />
we have got to make these fundamental changes about the structure<br />
of our industry to develop those things which we are best able to<br />
do, to develop our trading relationships with this fastest<br />
growing area of the world in SouthtEast and North-East A. õ ia<br />
so that we can get the benefit of their growth and make a<br />
contribution to it and importantly make our education system<br />
relevant. It is no good just increasing funds for education. .: Et<br />
is necessary and we have done it. But that's why I have appointed<br />
the Karmel Review into the quality Of educuation, because I<br />
want to ensure that the money which Australian people through their<br />
taxes pay on the education system in both the public and the private<br />
sector is most likely to ensure that our young people are going;<br />
to have the best opportunity of taking advantages of growth.<br />
JOURNALIST: You talked in the last election campaign about a<br />
new class in this country and you were referring to thet unemployed,<br />
could you see political danger for you in youth unemployment<br />
that young people could become disillusioned by a Hawke Government<br />
because jobs are not being created for them.<br />
No, because I have a higher judgement about the pqrppicac'ity<br />
of those people than you seem to have because there are two<br />
things which are true and indisputable. First, that we have<br />
created thousands of more jobs f or these young people.-' efore they<br />
were facing increasing levels of unemployment-under this<br />
Government there are more jobs. And secondly whereas they were<br />
treated with contempt by the Liberal National Party coalition<br />
their benefits were frozen and therefore reduced in real terms.<br />
We've increased the benefits in a short time for adult and junior<br />
unemployed by over 25%. So they see a Government which is not<br />
just words but it has produced the.. right policies to produce more<br />
jobs and in respect of those who are still unfortunately unemployed<br />
we have with compassion moved in real terms,* not just money terms,-,<br />
to improve their position.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister turning to foreign affairs issues<br />
and your about to take off for Tuvalu for the South Pacific Forum<br />
at that Forum there will be a proposal for a nuclear free zone<br />
in the South Pacific. Is such a proposal feasible orisitjust a<br />
pie-in-the-sky.<br />
Yes, it is feasible Robert. You will appreciate that I<br />
advanced that proposal here in Canberra at the meeting of the<br />
Forum last year, and got a very substantiah11favourable response.<br />
we will continue those discussions in Tuvalu and there were the'<br />
indications of Port Moresby of even stronger support. Now,<br />
what has to be understood about that is that in the proposal that<br />
I put last year and will develop again this year that includes<br />
the right of passage of nuclear -powered or nuclear-armed vesse* Ls*<br />
through the region and the right to individual countries to accept<br />
those vessels in their ports. We had to put it in that way because </p>
<p>P. M. cant.<br />
of our alliance relationship with the United States. Now I<br />
think, therefore, that for instance the United States understands<br />
the commitment that we have to this policy and it is afterall<br />
a very sensible thing. What we are about it to try and ensure<br />
that there be no testing of nuclear weapons in our region, that<br />
there be no dumping of nuclear waste in our region, and that the'-<br />
countries of the region undertake themselves not to manufacture<br />
or store nuclear weapons in their areas. Now these are legitimate<br />
aspirations of sovereign nations and should not be seen as any-thing<br />
other than likely to lead to an improvement in our part of the<br />
world and making a contribution to our part of the world to the<br />
search whic4 I believef is deeply felt. by the overwhelming majority<br />
of men and women-kind, and that is that we want to see a reduction<br />
of the level of nuclear armaments in this world. We cannot<br />
contemplate the holocaust of a nuclear disaster.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, given what you have said about the passage<br />
of ships and nuclear-powered nuclear-armed vessels and. the United<br />
States.. You could never see yourself in a position such as that<br />
that David Lange is in at the moment, your Labor counterpart in<br />
New Zealand could imagine yourself saying to the Americans<br />
we are not going to take those ships and if you don't like that<br />
that means ANZUS has had it.<br />
No, we have been through that in our party, and our position<br />
is clear, and it. is historically well based. It was the Labor<br />
Government of John Curtin which forged the relationship with the<br />
United States. We are not an unaligned country. We are an aliLgned<br />
country through our alliance. Now our judgement is; and the<br />
party has endorsed this, that that alliance involves obligations<br />
and those obligations we will adhere to.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister on another subject, just forthe moment,<br />
you did say the other day that your Ministry was the biest<br />
since the war...<br />
Yes<br />
JOURNALIST: and that your trust and confidence in the Ministers<br />
had been repaid. Does that mean that after the election<br />
we won't. have a re shuffle?<br />
Well, what you have got to understand under the constitution<br />
of the Labor PartyiTrevor, is that I don't elect those who are<br />
in the Ministry.<br />
JOURNALIST: You allocate the portfolios.<br />
I'll allocate, but you see that's relevant. to your question.<br />
I' mean if, in.* the election by the Caucus , there are changes Of pe! ople<br />
there. JOURNALIST: Well perhaps I should have sdid are there likely to be any<br />
reshuffle of portfolios?<br />
There may be some reshuffling but I would say at this time<br />
that my thinking that it would be minor, because I believe that. the<br />
Ministers in their portfolios have done excellent jobs. May I say,<br />
Trevor on that, that perhaps some people to some extent may discount<br />
the pride of a Prime Minister in his term when he says it is the<br />
best since the war. I would remind you and viewers of the statement<br />
by Mr John Reid, and I believe his assessment has a particular .11/<br />
vz-~ ie-, k r. </p>
<p>P. M. cant.<br />
significance because you will recall the. contretemps that occurred<br />
in the latter days of our opposition. Now Mr Reid who is<br />
a man who at first hand has had the opportunity of witnessing and<br />
working with a large number of Governments since the war,<br />
himself it was reported recently as saying of this Ministry that<br />
it is the best collection of talent assembled in Canberra since<br />
the war. I think the the proof is there.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke you said earlier in -the week that you would<br />
tell the Australian people in a reasonably short period of time<br />
I think was the phrase whether or not wde are going to have<br />
an election this year.<br />
P. M. Yes.<br />
JOURNALIST: Aren't you, like so many of your predecessors, merely<br />
fuelling speculation about'an election, with that sort of a comment.<br />
what the heck is a reasonably short period of time.<br />
No, George of course again, yo~ u are wrong. It's the opposite<br />
of my predecessors. From quite early in my Government I said that<br />
because of the actions of my predecessors who had completely<br />
broken the electoral rhythm by calling an unnecessarily early double<br />
dissolution; the Australian people were faced with the fact that<br />
under the Constitution by April of next year there has to be a<br />
half Senate election. So I said to the people very early that I<br />
think the best interests of everybody is served by not having another'<br />
election because if we had the half Senate election by April of<br />
next year, then we'd have to have the.. House of Representatives.<br />
So I said to them early, we will have the two together, which hasbeen<br />
the normal practice over the history of Australia, to have<br />
the House of Representatives and half Senate. Now I have said<br />
that that's what would happen and I have, from. the very early<br />
piece, said that that will mean that the election will be in the<br />
period December to March. Now that has been made quite clear<br />
it has become accepted that that's what will happen, now obvious; ly<br />
as Prime Minister I am entitled to look at the whole complex of<br />
situation and make the judgement as to that time as what would<br />
be best, not only in the Government's point of viewbut in the<br />
country's point of view. I will be now wait a minute George<br />
I will be making that decision within a matter of weeks and thert<br />
having made that decision, I won't keep it i~ n my mind and *. play<br />
around with the people and not tell them. As soon as I have madle<br />
up my mind, which will be in a very short period, as I have made<br />
up my mindI will tell the Australian people. Now every part of'<br />
that is in distinct contrast to our conservative predecessors.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, thank you for joining us.<br />
Thank you very much Robert, and Trevor and George. </p>
