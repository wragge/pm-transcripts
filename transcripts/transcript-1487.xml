NEW ZEALAND TOUR 1967<br />
JOINT STATEMENT ISSUED BY MR. HOLYOAKE,<br />
PRIME MINISTER OF NEW ZEALAND AND MR.<br />
HOLT, PRIME MINISTER OF AUSTRALIA FOLLOWING<br />
CABINET DISCUSSIONS 3RD FEBRUARY, 1967<br />
The Prime Ministers of New Zealand and Australia have<br />
greatly welcomed this opportunity for a general discussion in the company<br />
of members of the New Zealand Cabinet, on matters of common interest to<br />
our two countries. All have found it of great value and the Prime Ministers<br />
intend to take the further opportunities they will have for close discussion<br />
during the remainder of the visit.<br />
This meeting continues and expresses our close association,<br />
and falls within the context of a series of intimate but informal talks which<br />
have. taken place between the two Prime Ministers during the past year in<br />
London at the Prime Ministers' Conference, in Canberra for the meeting of<br />
the SEATO Council and at the Manila Conference.<br />
Today we have talked together on our outlooks and policies<br />
on matters of common interest in the South-East Asian and Pacific region,<br />
international trade and the trade between our two countries. Our discussions<br />
confirm that our interests run very much together.<br />
We agree about the need to continue military assistance in<br />
the defence of Viet Nam while, at the same time, actively searching for a<br />
peaceful settlement. We recognise that, hand in hand with the military<br />
effort, there is an increasing need for civil aid for the Vietnamese people.<br />
We see the turn of events in Indonesia, of course, as of<br />
major importance to both our countries, and we hope to see Indonesia<br />
playing its full part in promoting peace and progress in the region.<br />
Taking an overall view of South-East Asia, movements there<br />
for greater regional co-operation offer encouraging possibilities for the<br />
future. Having regard to the vital interest for both our countries in the<br />
future of the region, we are agreed that Australia and New Zealand should<br />
pursue policies designed to encourage these trends.<br />
Along with our interest in South-East Asia is our concern<br />
with developments within the South-West Pacific Region.<br />
International trade and related matters are of particular<br />
significance for our two countries. W~ e have a common interest in<br />
achieving more realistic marketing arrangements for agricultural products.<br />
British entry into the Common Market would produce problems for both<br />
countries and the prospect of this calls for the continuation of our closest<br />
consultation. Matters relating to the Free Trade Agreement will be the<br />
subject of further and detailed discussion between our Deputy Prime<br />
Ministers who are to meet shortly. </p>
<p>-2-<br />
We see scope for mutual benefit in closer co-operation<br />
on tourism, particularly in the encouragement of movement of tourists<br />
from other countries to New Zealand and Australia.<br />
Australia and New Zealand share a deep-seated attachment<br />
to the Commonwealth. They recognise, however, the growing complexities<br />
and problems arising in our multi-racial Commonwealth and will co-operate<br />
together towards promoting the Commonwealth as a force for peace and<br />
progress in the world. We welcome the world role which Britain continues<br />
to play in the achievement of the purposes of the Commonwealth. In this<br />
connection, we attach great importance to the decision of Britain to maintain<br />
a presence East of Suez and to continue to accept a role in South-East Asia.<br />
Australia and New Zealand remain equally determined to play their part in<br />
maintaining an adequate Commonwealth presence in the area.<br />
We feel that in today's discussions we have been able to<br />
further our common ourposes on immediate political and economic problems<br />
and on world issues of special significance to our two countries. Our<br />
discussions have been informal, frank and friendly, as befits our close<br />
relationship. We intend that there shall be further similar meetings. </p>
