FOR PRESS. PT! No. 36/ 1971<br />
CANCELLATrION OF SOUTh AFRICAN CRICKET TOUR<br />
Statement by the Prime Å“ Iinister, 7r. illiam , ciahon<br />
Tne Government has consistently expressed<br />
the view that visits of international sporting team-;;<br />
should be arranged between the sporting bodies concerned<br />
and that politics snould not be introduced into sport.<br />
Grave practical difficulties are, however,<br />
associated with the cricket tour. The Australian Cricket<br />
Board is best able to assess these difficulties. It<br />
has obviously taken account of the possibility that a<br />
minority would be prepared to go to extremes to disrupt<br />
the tour. I appreciate that the great majority of<br />
Australians wanted the tour to proceed, but I recognise<br />
the Board's problem in arranging a successful tour in<br />
the face of the difficulties.<br />
CAN! BERRA<br />
