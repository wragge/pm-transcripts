PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA WEDNESDAY, 11 NOVEMBER 1981<br />
ADELAIDE AIRPORT<br />
The Commonwealth has agreed to provide a separate<br />
international passenger terminal at Adelaide Airport.<br />
The decision follows discussions on 6 November<br />
between myself and the Premier of South Australia.<br />
It recognises the importance both governments place<br />
on dstablishing Adelaide as an international<br />
gateway.<br />
A number of airlines, including Qantas, have<br />
expressed an nterest in operating international<br />
services into Adelaide.<br />
The facilities, which will be similar to those<br />
recently completed at Townsville Airprt, will<br />
include a separate terminal building, associated<br />
apron, taxiway, roads, car park and services.<br />
Full health, immigration and customs facilities<br />
will also be available.<br />
Planning wif 1l proceed immediately so that construction<br />
can commence as soon as possible.<br />
Provision of these facilities will allow international<br />
services to commence by the end of next year..<br />
