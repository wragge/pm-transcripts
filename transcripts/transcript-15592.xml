<p>PRIME MINISTER HOWARD: </p>
<p>Good morning ladies and gentlemen, we will each make a very short statement.  As is typical of two countries that have a very close and friendly, and deep relationship, I have had a very fruitful meeting with the Prime Minister of Japan, Mr Abe. We propose to issue two statements coming out of our meeting.  The first statement is on climate change and energy matters.  It reflects the very close similarity of views between our two countries on these matters and I record my appreciation for the strong support given by the Prime Minister in preparation of the Sydney declaration.  The second statement sets out a framework for detailed implementation of the security agreement signed between Australia and Japan earlier this year.  Mr Prime Minister it's been wonderful having you and your wife in Sydney for the APEC meeting, you are always welcome in our country, and I reaffirm the great strength of this very deep and rich relationship between Australia and Japan. </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER ABE: </p>
<p>I would first like to thank Prime Minister Howard and the people of Australia for warmly welcoming myself, my wife and my delegation to this APEC meeting.  Despite the fact that our meeting was short, we were able to have a fruitful meeting between the two of us.  Based on our joint declaration on security cooperation which we issued in March this year, we have now agreed on an action plan. We agreed to promote practical cooperation based on this action plan between the two of us.  We intend to steadily implement this action so that both Japan and Australia can contribute further to the peace and stability of the region.  We also intend to promote cooperation among Japan, Australia and the United States. As Prime Minister Howard has just mentioned, we shared the view that Japan and Australia are in a position to lead international efforts to resolve the issues of climate change and energy security.  In order to expand cooperation between our two countries in this area, Prime Minister Howard and I have issued a joint statement.  A global effort is urgently needed to deal with these issues, I intend to promote cooperation between Japan and Australia based on this joint statement. Concerning the EPA negotiations, we intend to continue constructive discussions while paying due regard to the sensitivities on both sides, especially the importance of agriculture and other sectors for Japan.  My hope is that the conclusion of the EPA will lead to stronger economic relations between Japan and Australia. Concerning regional issues, we discussed the nuclear issue and the abduction issue of North Korea and Prime Minister Howard was kind to express his support, and support for Japan's position concerning this issue and agreed to cooperate.  I intend for my country and Australia to cooperate together in dealing with various issues that the international community faces.  Thank you very much. </p>
