    <content><![CDATA[<p>Today I met Premiers and the Acting Chief Minister of the Australian Capital Territory to discuss the Commonwealth's National Plan for Water Security. The meeting was constructive and progress was made. As an earnest of our desire to achieve a positive outcome we have agreed to meet again on Friday 23 February where it is hoped that agreement will be reached. </p>
<p>In the meantime our respective officials will come together to resolve issues of detail. I understand that they will be meeting next Tuesday 13th February. </p>
