INAUGURAL ADDRESS ON MULTICULTURALISM<br />
TO THE INSTITUTE OF MULTICULTURAL AFFAIRS<br />
Mr Chairman, Councillors and members of the Institute,<br />
distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen. I greatly<br />
welcome the invitation to give the Australian Institute<br />
of Multicultural Affairs' inaugural lecture because of the<br />
opportunity it provides to explore issues important to the<br />
future of our country.<br />
Like most people, my sense of what the future might hold is<br />
conditioned by my understanding of the present and of the<br />
past. History and experience impose responsibilities upon<br />
us. In many areas, they compel us to respond to unpleasant<br />
facts. To do otherwise would be to betray reason and responsl. hility.<br />
History and experience also illuminate what we may strive for,<br />
and it is no less a betrayal of reason and responsibility to<br />
be afraid of achieving the full extent of what is possible.<br />
Jt is perhaps the greatest failure of all to be blinded<br />
to real possibilities by myth and prejudice. Many of the<br />
world events which have taken place in our lifetime may giye<br />
us just cause for pessi'mis. 1i. In Australia's case, however,<br />
in the area we are considering tonight, we are fortunate that<br />
our recent history reveals above all that our country has<br />
an enormous capacity for social change, and has developed<br />
a maturity and tolerance that few would have dared predict<br />
in 1945.<br />
Although Australians have always traced their roots to a<br />
variety of cultures, at the end of the Second World War the<br />
balance of numbers and perspectives was such that any discussion<br />
of multiculturalism would have been dismissed as irrelevant<br />
or anathema. Public and political opinion decisively favoure. a<br />
maintaining a population and culture overwhelmingly Anglo-Celtic<br />
in character and so apparently did the Australian tradition,<br />
The lessons of Australian history appeared to support the view,<br />
that the diversity our society would tolerate was strictly<br />
limited. We had witnessed the disastrous unwillingness of<br />
/ 2 </p>
<p>-2<br />
of white settlers to even contemplate a just accommodation<br />
with the aboriginals, and the bitter course of relations<br />
between Europeans and the Chinese and South Sea Islanders.<br />
We had experienced the importation into a new nation of conflicts<br />
between English and Irish, protestant and catholic, which<br />
formed the basis of long-lasting divisions. We had seen<br />
newer European migrant groups being given a less than welcome<br />
reception by the established society. Of course even ties<br />
of blood did not spare the British migrant from a measure of<br />
suspicion and hostility especially if he or she was so<br />
unwise as to express a word of criticism about life down under.<br />
Yet despite all this, driven by the conviction that Australia<br />
must " populate or perish", governments in the post-war period<br />
mounted a massive program of immigration, a program which was to<br />
create one of the world's most diverse populations. The<br />
transformation wrought by that program on our society has been.<br />
immense and dramatic, but-it was not deliberate.<br />
Australia's first Minister for Immigration was merely expressiLng<br />
the public and political consensus when he advised the<br />
Parliament in 1946, " The Government's immigration policy is<br />
based on the principle that migrants from the U. K. shall be<br />
given every encouragement and assistance. It is my hope<br />
that for every foreign migrant there will be ten people from<br />
the United Kingdom... aliens are and will continue to be<br />
admitted only in such numbers and of such classes that they<br />
can readil. y be assimilated". Such a statement was an absolute<br />
prerequisite for the new immigration program to secure the<br />
support of all major political parties and the general<br />
Australian community.<br />
Policy consensus and continuity was made clear by his successor<br />
from the other side of the House in 1950: " This is a British<br />
community and we want to keep it a British community..."<br />
Considerable social and political efforts were made to achieve<br />
the twin goals of maintaining an* homogeneous population,<br />
and assimilating those who were different. But these<br />
efforts were in vain.<br />
The hope that settlers from the United Kingdom would vastly<br />
outnumber others was confounded by the composition of successive<br />
migrant intakes. And as immigrants from other source countries<br />
settled in growing numbers, they refuted the expectation that<br />
they would assimilate, that they would shed their identities<br />
like snakes their skins. They held fast to the parts of their<br />
heritage they valued and endeavoured to pass them on to their<br />
children. But if the initial premises of immigration policy<br />
were soon invalidated, so too were the fears that prompted themn.<br />
/ 3 </p>
<p>-3<br />
The record shows that Australia has since 1947 settled almost<br />
three and a half million people from more than 100 countries.<br />
The record shows that Australia has been capable of embracing<br />
an ever increasing degree of ethnic and cultural diversity.<br />
The record shows ' that the Australian ' people, from wherever<br />
they have come, have enriched and strengthened this country<br />
with their cultures, their energies, th ' eir commitment and their<br />
children. Together, we have built a nation which today, by<br />
any international standard of comparison, must be judged a<br />
success.<br />
There is no doubt that this achievement has been sustained by<br />
the economic growth and prosperity Australia has generally<br />
attained since the war. History shows that societies are<br />
most prone to racism and communal disdrd during periods of<br />
economic difficulty. In Australia as elsewhere tolerance has<br />
been at a premium when the gold has run out, or work difficult<br />
to find. But there has been far more to our acceptance of<br />
diversity than favourable economic circumstances. Our<br />
achievement reflects social and political processes as well<br />
as economic ones. It is important that we recognise them.<br />
One critical process has been the way Australia's ethnic<br />
communiti * es have developed, the initiatives they have<br />
taken and the responses they have evoked. Migrants established<br />
churches, community groups, welfare associations, schools and<br />
sporting clubs through which they could preserve and develop<br />
those aspects of the inheritance they valued.<br />
They established ethnic communities, but they did not cut<br />
themselves off from the community at 1 rge. They asserted<br />
their right to be accorded a place * of'respect within the<br />
Australian community, within its established constitutional<br />
framework, a place that acknowledged their linguistic and<br />
cultural needs and rights. Patiently and doggedly ethnic<br />
commnunities sought out and changed the attitudes of the press,<br />
educators, welfare agencies, churches, politicians, public<br />
servants and the general public. They secured acceptance<br />
of the issues which concerned them as legitimate and<br />
significant items on the nation's social and political agendas.<br />
The process of change which was involved took place with<br />
relative speed. I say " with relative speed" not in order to<br />
gloss over the years of neglect, but rather to emphasise that<br />
it takes time to re-appraise established ways of seeing<br />
society and yet that is what has been achieved.<br />
What has occurred is more profound and more subtle than the<br />
recognition of the needs of ethnic communities, important as<br />
that has been. We have not simply grafted an ethnic dimension<br />
on to an otherwise unchanged conception of ourselves. There<br />
has been a fundamental reappraisal of the established way of<br />
seeing Australia. In iQ'Ulticulturalism, we have forged a / 4 </p>
<p>I -4-<br />
ra dically innovative basis upon which we can respond as a<br />
nation to Australia's diversity, to its challenges and<br />
opportunities. It is a basis which offers at once both an<br />
understanding of the present and a vision of the future built<br />
upon that understanding.<br />
The key elements of multiculturalism can be simply stated.<br />
They are based both on realism and idealism. The starting<br />
point is the recognition and appreciation of the fact that<br />
the Australian population is derived from a wide variety of<br />
ethnic and cultural backgrounds, and that these backgrounds<br />
are important to the way Australians see themselves. The sheer<br />
dutation and magnitude of immigration into this<br />
country, the plain facts of the composition of Australia's<br />
population mean that even if we wished otherwise ethnic and<br />
cultural diversity can neither be ignored nor readily<br />
extinguished.<br />
We know that the attempt to enforce conformity holds high<br />
costs both for the individual and the society. It denies<br />
people their identity and self-esteem. It drives a wedge<br />
between children and their parents. Ultimately it poses a<br />
real threat of alienation and division. We cannot demand of<br />
people that they renounce the heritage they value, and<br />
yet expect them to feel welcome as full members of our society.<br />
Realism alone dictates that cultural differences must be<br />
responded to in a positive way.<br />
But multiculturalism is concerned with far more than the<br />
passive toleration of diversity. It sees diversity as a<br />
quality to be actively embraced, a source of social wealth<br />
and dynamism. It encourages groups to be open and to interact,<br />
so that all Australians may learn and benefit from each other's<br />
heritages. Multiculturalism is about diversity, not division<br />
it is about interaction not isolation. It is about cultural<br />
and ethnic differences set within a framework of shared<br />
fundamental values which enables them to co-exist on a<br />
complementary, rather than competitive basis. It involves<br />
respect for the law and for our democratic institutions and<br />
processes. Insisting upon a core area of common values is no<br />
threat to multiculturalism but its guarantee, for it provides the<br />
minimal conditions on which-the well-being of all is secured.<br />
Not least, multiculturalism is about equality of opportunity<br />
for the members of all groups to participate in and benefit<br />
from Australia's social, economic and political life. This<br />
concern with equality of opportunity is dictated by both<br />
morality and hard-nosed realism. I am talking here about<br />
basic human rights, not benevolence which the giver bestows<br />
or withdraws at will. No society can long retain the<br />
commitment and involvement of groups; that are denied these<br />
rights. if particular groups feel that they and their children<br />
are condemned whether through legal or other arrangements to<br />
occupy the worst jobs and housing, to suffer the poorest heal. th<br />
and education, then the societies in which they live are bent<br />
on a path which will cost them dearly. </p>
<p>Thus multiculturalism speaks to us forcefully and directly<br />
about a ra[ nge of fundamental issues of relevance to all<br />
Australians. It is not an abstract or alien notion, not a<br />
blueprint holding out utopian promises, but a set of guidelines<br />
for action which grows directly out of our society's aspirations<br />
and experiences. That is why multiculturalism has so<br />
quickly entered our political and social vocabulary and<br />
become a central reference point.<br />
Many of you present tonight were and continue to be central<br />
actors ixD the history of Australia's multiculturalism.<br />
It must be a source of wry amusement for you to hear on<br />
occasion the suggestion that multiculturalism is some opiate<br />
for the ethnic masses concocted to divert attention from what<br />
are described as " real issues". To haVe one's heritage<br />
respected, to be treated with dignity on one's own terms, to<br />
contribute as full and equal participants in Australian<br />
society, these are issues of the most fundamental importance.<br />
I think each of us will have our own perception of the moment<br />
when multiculturalism became more than an aspiration. In my<br />
own perspective, in terms of substantive governmental action,<br />
that moment came with the Commonwealth's acceptance in 1978<br />
of the Report of the Review of Post-Arrival Programs and<br />
Services to Migrants, popularly known as the Gaibally Report.<br />
The report identified multiculturalism as a key concept in<br />
formulating Government policies and recognised that Australia<br />
was at a critical stage in its development as a multicultural<br />
nation. It re-examined existing assumptions and methods, and<br />
urged the need for policies and programs to take new~ directions.<br />
Central to these directions-~ was a commitment to the principles~<br />
of equal opportunity and equality of access to general services,<br />
the provision of special services where these are needed; respect<br />
for cultural diversity; consultation, self--help and self reliance.<br />
On the * basis of. these the Galbally Report charted a * bold new-course.<br />
A number of its recommendations broke new and untried ground,<br />
some were complex and difficult of achievement, and required<br />
considerable organisational adaptation. The Government warmly<br />
welcomed the report, accepted its recommendations in toto and<br />
moved rapidly acro ss a broad front to mount initiatives and<br />
programs designed to overcome the years of neglect and ad hoc<br />
responses.<br />
Accordingly the Commonwealth has, since 1978, developed a major<br />
orientation program for new arrivals and introduced innovative<br />
Engligh language instruction; promoted multicultural education<br />
in Government and non-Government schools; boosted the child<br />
migrant education program; extended the provision of special.<br />
welfare services to migrants by substantially increasing<br />
the number of grant-in-aid social workers; established a<br />
network of migrant resource centres; established the Australian<br />
Institute-of Multicultural Affairs; extended ethnic radio<br />
services; and carried out a range of research projects in<br />
particular areas of need. / 6 </p>
<p>6<br />
Another of the Report's recommiendations relates to an initiative<br />
that I regard as particularly significant, the establishment<br />
of Channel 0/ 28 a service unique in the world. It is very<br />
deliberately . entitled " multicultural,"-not " ethnic television",<br />
because its intended audience is all Australians, whatever<br />
languages they speak, whatever their particular ethnic and<br />
cultural identity. Multicultural. television has screened an<br />
impressive range of high quality international programs and presented<br />
aspects of Australian life which other channels have tended to<br />
ignore._<br />
Many of the achievements of the first twelve months have been<br />
encouraging. The news program, for example, has been widely<br />
praised in media circles for the scope-of its international<br />
coverage. Channel 0/ 28 has established a viewing audience<br />
not just from ethnic communities but from the community at<br />
large. Even the sceptics have been impressed. Indeed it was an<br />
unusual, but not unpleasant experience to have " The Age"<br />
reversing its initial editorial stance by admitting that<br />
" Channel 0/ 28 is making its critics ( ourselves included) eat<br />
their words". Multicultural television wa ' s just one of the ma ny<br />
initiatives that was recommended in the 6albally Report. The<br />
task of putting these initidtives<br />
in place has required a considerable commitment of effort and<br />
resources on the part of all, involved, and as it is now three<br />
years since the Government agreed to the Galbally Report, both<br />
the community and the Government need to know what the results<br />
have been. Accordingly, as the GaJ-bally Report recommended,<br />
there will be an independent evaluation of its objectives<br />
and outcomes, and whether changes need to be made. The Institute<br />
of Multicultural Affairs has been requested to undertake the<br />
evaluation, and we expect the report to be presented in time<br />
to be considered before next year's Budget.<br />
We need to know whether the recommendations of the Report have<br />
been effectively implemcnted, whet'her timetables have been<br />
met, whether expenditure has kept in line with commitments<br />
and, where adjustments have been made, whether they were<br />
appropriate. We need to know whether the recommendations<br />
reached the objectives they were designed to achieve, whether<br />
outcomes have measured up to intentions, and if not, we need<br />
to examine avenues for further action. Wie need to know whether<br />
the experience gained over the past three years indicates<br />
alternative means of achieving the objectives, or even the<br />
need to pursue new objectives and programs.<br />
Let me make it quite clear that the Government is unequivocally<br />
committed to programs which meet priority needs. We are committed<br />
to further action where priority needs are not being met by<br />
existing programs, and to maintaining the impetus generated<br />
by the Galbally Report. What is important above all is to<br />
have in place programs and. services which do work to create<br />
and strengthien the fundamentals of a multicultural society. / 7 </p>
<p>-7<br />
I have spoken at length about the role of Government, but<br />
there are limits to what Government on its own can achieve.<br />
In the first place it is quite plain that the success of<br />
Government programs themselves is dependent on popular support:,<br />
without that support even the most elaborate plans and prograns<br />
are of little value, symbols rather than substance. A truly<br />
multicultural society cannot be created by political will and<br />
action alone. Multiculturalism is reflected in and determined<br />
by the face to face relations of every member of the community.<br />
in all walks of life. The essence of multiculturalism can be<br />
realised only in the attitudes and behaviour of people in<br />
areas which are beyond the proper reach of democratic government.<br />
A law on the statutc book punishing those who use racial or<br />
ethnic insults will not compel neighbours to respect and<br />
appreciate each other's cultural heritage. A code of<br />
conduct for the media, which warns against denigrating ethnic<br />
groups will not prevent advertisers and scriptwriters using<br />
exclusively anglo-saxon models for their heroes and heroines.<br />
Educational institutions can introduce multicultural courses<br />
to raise their students' awareness of Australia's social<br />
adversity, but these cannot guarantee cultural sensitivity in<br />
all places where it is most needed, by doctors toward their<br />
patients, by teachers toward their pupils, by lawyers and<br />
social workers toward their clients.<br />
Ultimately, the responsibility for multiculturalism rests not<br />
just on the Government but on the community at large. And in<br />
the Australian community, over the past decade, multicultural<br />
awareness and practice have indeed spread at a growing pace,<br />
and ideas and impetus for change continue to flow from<br />
individuals, groups and organisations.<br />
I believe it is no coincidence that the strengthening commitment<br />
to Australian multiculturalism has accompanied the expansion<br />
of our foreign policy perspectives and ties with inany new<br />
nations. It is in part because we have reconsidered our own<br />
society that we have been willing and able to make a distinctive<br />
international contribution to the struggle against racism<br />
to the defence of human rights, and to the needs and<br />
aspirations of the Third World. These have earned us<br />
recognition and support amongst nations with whom we once<br />
believed we had little in common, and who viewed us with more<br />
than a touch of suspicion. If empathy and respect for each<br />
other's basic values and concerns are the heart of multiculturalism,<br />
their growing prominence has had a deep impact on our affairs<br />
abroad.<br />
But we are not here to celebrate the arrival of the multicultural<br />
millennium, much more needs to be done, by Government, by the<br />
community, by each and every one of us. The commitment to<br />
multiculturalism is demanding of our time, our energy and our<br />
resources, and there is no finishing post where we can stop<br />
and say that the task is done. * But the commitment is a<br />
necessary one. / 8 </p>
<p>8-<br />
Multiculturalism is the most intelligent and appropriate response<br />
to the diversity which characterises our society, but anyone<br />
with an understanding of history knows that appropriate and<br />
intelligent responses are not the only ones. There are no<br />
-forces of historical inevitability which guarantee our<br />
progress in multiculturalism, this depends on the actions and<br />
commitments of individuals. The challenge is ongoing, because<br />
social change is inevitable. The nature of our present<br />
social diversity will itself continue to undergo change as some<br />
countri~ s decline as major sources of immigrants, and others<br />
emerge.-We will need to adjust to new groups, just as we have<br />
previously adjusted to those who now form an integral part of<br />
the Australian community.<br />
The " w of whom I speak i-s not only A~ istralians of Anglo-Celbic<br />
origins, but all Australians. To a newly arrived group,<br />
earlier migrant communities and their children are now as much<br />
a part of the established community as are those who can trace<br />
their forebears to the First Fleet. If there is any doubt<br />
about the importance of a multicultural response it is dispelled<br />
by what we can learn from the record of ethnic and cultural<br />
conflicts in other countries.<br />
The key lesson to be drawn from their experience is that there is<br />
no social peace to be found in the failure to acknowledge<br />
the rights of ethnic minorities to realise their full potential<br />
socially, economically, politically and culturally. For if<br />
these rights are not recognised the assured consequence is a<br />
loss of trust in the society that cannot be quickly regained.<br />
The result is demands for change generated at a tempo that<br />
no society can accommtodate. Attitudes and bargaining positions<br />
harden. The less constructively a society responds to its own diversity<br />
the less capable it becomes of doing so. Its reluctance to<br />
respond, fuelled by the fear of encouraging division, becomes<br />
a self-fulfilling prophesy the erosion of national cohesion<br />
is a result not of the fact of diversity but of its denial<br />
and suppression.. That is the lesson that we should learn from<br />
overseas, that the path'---we have chosen is correct. Let us grasp<br />
the reality of our own experience. our reality is that in<br />
Australia people can retain a commitment to their heritage-.-and<br />
make a total commitment to Australia. Our reality is that by<br />
responding to the fact of Australia's diversity we have not<br />
created, and will not create, situations where particular<br />
ethnic communities form exploited, alienated, separate groups<br />
within our nation.<br />
There are differences between ethnic groups in Auistralia,<br />
but they are not the product of structural and impenetrable<br />
barriers. Look at any of our major post-war migrant groups<br />
and their children, and you will find significant numbers who<br />
have acquired new skills and resources, and made achievements<br />
and contributions of which they and all Australians are justly<br />
proud. Our reality is that agrowing number of Australians<br />
share the conviction that for Australia multiculturalism is anr<br />
opportunity to be seized, not a threat from which to retreat. / 9 </p>
<p>9-<br />
The appointment of the first group of members of the Institute<br />
who are convened here for the first time is a very real and<br />
tangible indication of this. Your appointments are both a<br />
recognition of the contribution you have already made, and an<br />
expression of confidence in the work . you will continue to<br />
undertake in promoting multiculturalism. At the political<br />
level all major parties are in broad agreement on the general<br />
approach that multiculturalism offers. In the community at<br />
large we are more open to and trusting of social diversity<br />
than we have ever been. This is particularly true of our<br />
youth. -They have grown up with diversity as part of their<br />
lives, they are at ease, with it, and do not have the fear<br />
and distrust that grows from the unknown.<br />
Australian multiculturalism is a uniquo achievement. Australia<br />
may have stumbled into the multicultural epoch. We were a<br />
nation comparatively small in size and insular in outlook.<br />
But within a period of time that is short in historical<br />
perspective, Australia has been enlarged in capacities,<br />
talents and outlook by millions of men and women from every<br />
corner of the globe.<br />
Today, while other societies still perceive ethnic cultural<br />
diversity as a problem to be contended with, Australia, without<br />
pain, without conflict, has broken through and this breakthrough<br />
is a significant achievement indeed, especially for our children.<br />
Let us take strength and confidence from this knowledge and<br />
work together to bring the promise of multiculturalism to<br />
fruition, that promise of a cohesive nation that draws strength<br />
and unique character from its diversity. That is my faith<br />
and my commitment.-coo---</p>
