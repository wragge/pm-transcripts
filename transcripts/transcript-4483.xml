The Opposition Leader quoted last night in his National<br />
Broadcast from the Prime Minister's Report to the Nations<br />
The relevant passage from Mr. Whitlarn's text was as follows:<br />
" Let me emphasise as forcefully as I can that here the<br />
scientific knowledge does exist. The technology does<br />
exist. The scientific knowledge and technology have been<br />
applied to the problem of waste. The technology is knowni."<br />
This is just not true. Let me emnphasise that as forcelcully<br />
as I can: at most, there are disposal processes which have<br />
only and I quote the words of the Minister for Environment<br />
in Parliament<br />
" proved to be technically feasible at pilot plants"<br />
The quotation was selective. The Prime Minister's full comment,<br />
with the omitted section underlined, was as follows:<br />
" LetL-me emphasise as forcefully as I can that here the<br />
scientific knowledge does exist. The technology does<br />
exist. The scientific knowledge and technology have been<br />
applied to the problem of waste. The technology is known-.<br />
It has worked on a trial basis, and plans are now under<br />
way to adopt it on a much largier scale."<br />
