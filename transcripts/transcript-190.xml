WORK AT KIMBERLEY RJL] SEARCH STATION TO BE<br />
DOUBLED<br />
Statement by the Actingi Prime Minister, Mr. J. McEwen<br />
The Commonwealth Government has agreed to increase its<br />
assistance to the work of the Kimberley Research Station.<br />
An expanded programme of agricultural research is to<br />
be carried out over the next five years at the Station, which is<br />
located in the Ord Valley, North-W4estern Australia.<br />
Annual expenditure on this work will be almost doubled.<br />
The station has been operated jointly by the Commonwealth<br />
and Western Australian Governments since 1946. The agricultural<br />
research is carried out by the Commonwealth Scientific<br />
and Industrial Research Organisation and the -lestern Australian<br />
Department of Agriculture. Each Government meets half the costs<br />
involved. The results of the Station's work in irrigated agriculture<br />
are already being applied in several northern Australian<br />
areas. The Stationts annual funds ( exclusive of salaries) for<br />
carrying out its work uill be increased from œ C50,000 to œ C92,000.<br />
The research staff will be increased.<br />
The programme decided upon for the next five-year period<br />
provides for an expansion of work on rice and safflower. These<br />
two crops are giving very encouraging results. Further work will<br />
be done on a number of other crops which appear to have good agronomic<br />
prospects. It will be recalled that the Government of destern Australia<br />
decided to spend in the Ord Valley part of the œ C5 million<br />
grant provided by the Commonwealth for new development works in<br />
the northern part of Western Australia. It is now proceeding<br />
with the construction of a weir on the Ord River to serve an irrigation<br />
area of from 10,000 to 15, GLOO acres.<br />
This decision of the t4ostern Australian Government has<br />
emphasised the necessity for expanding the work of the Station, so<br />
that it can handle technical problems arising from the commercial<br />
venture. . CANB fRA, 15' th June ,1960 </p>
