STATEMENT ON<br />
COMMONWEALTH AID ROADS<br />
ARRANGEMENTS 1969-70 TO 1973-74<br />
The present Commonwealth Aid Roads legislation will<br />
expire on 30 June. Before the end of the current session of the<br />
Commonwealth Parliament we therefore propose to seek legislative<br />
authority for new arrangements to operate for the next five years.<br />
Thxe isingarrangements provided for Commonwealth<br />
Aid Road grants of $ 750 million for the five year period 1964-69.<br />
This was $ 250 million, of 50 per cent, more than was provided for<br />
the five year period before that. In addition, other Commonwealth<br />
financial assistance to the States for roads purposes, such as the<br />
" beef roads" schemes, amounted to $ 36 million during the five<br />
years. The Commonwealth has long acknowledged a financial<br />
obligation to contribute to the development of the Australian<br />
roads system and is nowadays financing more than one-third of the<br />
total amount spent annually on roads throughout Australia.<br />
At the operational level, responsibility for the detailed<br />
planning and carrying out of road works in the States has rested with<br />
the States. Naturally we have become increasingly concerned with<br />
the problem of achieving the best allocation of national resources.<br />
between the building and upkeep of roads and other pressing demands<br />
for developmental works. We want to ensure that the resources<br />
made available for roads are applied in ways which will best serve<br />
the nation's evolving road requirements.<br />
Following the 1964 review of the Commonwealth Aid<br />
Roads arrangements, we set up the Commonwealth Bureau of Roads<br />
to undertake a thorough survey and appraisal of the existing roads<br />
system and of foreseeable roads requirements.<br />
Whilst considering what new arrangements we should<br />
propose for financial assistance to the States for roads during the<br />
next quinquennium we have been greatly assisted by the<br />
information and advice the Bureau has furnished to us. The<br />
Premier' s have already received copies of the Bureau's report. </p>
<p>I feel sure that they too would have found it enlightening and<br />
helpful. It would have been impossible for the Bureau to prepare<br />
such a report without the extensive assistance it received from the<br />
State authorities concerned with roads matters. We appreciate<br />
their contribution and the way they have co-operated with the<br />
Bureau. The Commonwealth Government ac. epts the Bureau's<br />
assessment that, provided it is applied economically, expenditure on<br />
roads at a rate considerably higher than at present could and should<br />
be undertaken during the next five years. 4e recognise the high<br />
returns, in terms of increased productivity and reduced<br />
transportation costs, that can flow from well-directed investment<br />
in this field. WVe are, therefore, prepared to increase very<br />
considerably, under a new set of arrangements, the amount of<br />
Commonwealth financial assistance to the States for roads purposes.<br />
The new arrangements we have in mind aim to bring the distribution<br />
of Commonwealth assistance as between the States more closely<br />
into accord with relative needs for road expenditures, and to direct<br />
this assistance more specifically than in the past to the development<br />
of particular classes of roads that seem to us to have high<br />
importance from a national standpoint. </p>
<p>3.<br />
We propose that Commonwealth assistance should be<br />
provided specifically for<br />
construction and reconstruction of arterial and sub-arterial<br />
roads in urban areas;<br />
construction and reconstruction of non-urban arterial<br />
roads; construction, reconstruction and maintenance oi other<br />
rural roads;<br />
planning and research.<br />
Under the existing arrangements the Commonwealth has<br />
imposed a speciiic requirement that at least 10O% oi* the total Commonwealth<br />
Aid Roads grant be spent on construction and maintenance o√± roads in rural<br />
areas, other than highways, trunk roads and main roads.<br />
Under the arrangements proposed the allocation of money<br />
lor such roads will be the same amount of money as was received in 1968/ 69<br />
plus an escalation of 5T% each year waich will be compounded.<br />
Ta-us although the old formula oi 403% of the total grant<br />
available has been abandoned the actual amounts available for alich roads<br />
will increase in eaca year of the L'ive year period, and such roads will<br />
rceceive an amount of $ P394. 55 million an increase of 9i 65 million on<br />
the amount required to be spent on this class of road during the last<br />
quinquennium. The proposed specific allocations for arterial and<br />
sub-arterial roads in urban areas and for non-urban arterial roads will<br />
be innovations. We consider that a big increase in construction and<br />
reconstruction of arterial and sub-arterial roads in urban areas is needed<br />
to help overcome the acute traf-iic problems of the larger cities. The<br />
central place the non-urban arterial roads must have in the progressive<br />
development of a more efficient highway system spanning the nation fully<br />
warrants the provision of specific assistance for their development. The<br />
allocatici fcr both these classes of arterial roads would, we propose, be<br />
for construction and reconstruction only. </p>
<p>The proposed all ocation for planning and research<br />
reflects our view that considerably more resources should be directed<br />
to these activities and tnat planning and researcn will pay handsome dividends<br />
and permit us to plan and build more efficiently in the future.<br />
We are therefore prepared to make the States a<br />
" 1principal" Commonwealth grant for these purposes of 200 million<br />
during the next five years.<br />
Tiie method of dividing the total sum available between<br />
the States has been adopted in order to approac more closely a pattern<br />
of distribution in accord with relative needs for road expenditure.<br />
We have felt unable to move abruptly from the formula<br />
o. L-distribution which has been in use for the last five years to one<br />
entirely in accord with economically evaluated needs as portrayed by<br />
the Bureau of Roads because doing so would not pay sufficient regard<br />
to the disruption of the existing pattern oi roads expenditure and the<br />
operational and other problems that drastic, rapid, changes could<br />
create f1or various States.<br />
We iiave thereiore decided miat, for the next five years<br />
and as a transitional arrangement, the distribution between tne 3States<br />
should be primarily on the basis oi. giving equal weight to the distribution<br />
under the existing legislation and the distribution indicated by the Bureau's<br />
" scheduling programme". The " scheduling programme" is based upon an<br />
estimate by the Bureau of Roads, made after consultation with the State road<br />
authorities, of tae amount of road work capable oi yielding high economic<br />
returns wiiich can be carried out during the next five years with the<br />
resources likely to be available in that period.<br />
We therefore propose that the sum of 40, 20J million<br />
be distributed between the States on the basis recommended in the<br />
minority report oi the Bureau. </p>
<p>This distribution will produce the following results:<br />
million<br />
New South Wale 3.4<br />
Victoria .2 54. 4<br />
Queensland 2% 31. 6<br />
South Australia 12<br />
Western Australia<br />
Tasmania 54.3D<br />
Totaljj<br />
E~ ven thouL; h this partly reflects the existing distribution we<br />
recognise that it could create difficulties for some States. Because of this<br />
the Commonwealth is prepared to provide special supplements to ensure that<br />
no State receives over the next five years less than 52 per cent more than in<br />
the present quinquennium. These supplements will be " phased out" t by the<br />
end of the period. These special supplementary grants, which would be available<br />
for expenditure on construction and maintenance of any type of road, would<br />
total million and would be distributed in this way: million<br />
South Australia J<br />
Western Australia 42-. 8<br />
Tasmania 2.25.<br />
TogTether the principal and the supplementary grants would<br />
amount to 252, 935 million: an increase of $ 5.32. million, or 67 per cent, </p>
<p>on the grants for the present quinquennium. I will circulate a table showing<br />
the distribution between States for each year of the next quinquennium.<br />
Let me explain in greater detail our proposals for specific<br />
allocations, within the sum of 203 million I mentioned, for urban and nonurban<br />
arterial roads, other rural roads and planniny and research.<br />
Urban arterial and sub-arterial roads are those falling within<br />
Classes 6 and 7 defined by the Bureau of Roads in Appendix V to its report.<br />
Non-urban arterial roads are those in Classes 1 and 2 and other rural roads<br />
those in Classes 3, 4 and 5. These classes of roads are described in a<br />
statement I will circulate.<br />
Wie also propose that 1. 5 per cent of each State's share of the<br />
203 million be specifically allocated for expenditure on planning and<br />
research approved by the Commonwealth.<br />
The differences be tween the total of each State's share of the<br />
2) 3 million and the sum of the allocations for expenditure in that State on<br />
" other rural roads" and planninx and rescarch comprise the specific allocations<br />
for urban and non-urban arterial roads. The relative sizes of these<br />
allocations in each State corresponds with the proportionate relationships<br />
between them in the Bureau's " Scheduliny Programme".<br />
Combining-the fig--ures for all States, the total allocations would<br />
be as follows:-million<br />
Construction, reconstruction<br />
and maintenance of " other<br />
rural" roads 39.. 55<br />
Construction and reconstruction<br />
of non-urban arterial roads 186.76 </p>
<p>7.<br />
Construction and reconstruction<br />
of urban arterial and subarterial<br />
roads 69<br />
Planning, and Research 18. 3<br />
Total Principal Grant 1, 230. X).<br />
As I mentioned earlier, urban arterial and sub-arterial roads<br />
would be those falling within Classes 6 and 7 as defined by the Bureau; nonurban<br />
arterial would be those within Classes 1 and 2; and other rural roads<br />
those within Classes 3, 4 and 5. 1 add that, for this purpose, the<br />
delineation between urban and non-urban areas will be mapde by defining as<br />
urban areas those areas of capital cities designated by the Statistician as<br />
Capital City Statistical Divisions and the urban areas of major provincial<br />
cities having populations greater than 403, 03-0 at the last Census. The<br />
Commonwealth will consult with the States re--arding the particular roads<br />
that will be included in each of the main classes. </p>
<p>8.<br />
ych.-tbe. separate and specific allocations or<br />
funds for the three-broad classifications are to be used for the class of<br />
roads specified. The amounts to be provided are very large and we<br />
recognise that, in exceptional circumstances, especially in the case of<br />
construction of urban arterial and sub-arterial roads, a State might<br />
encounter difficulty in using all of its annual allocation because of planning<br />
or other delays. Provio ion will accordingly be made in the new<br />
legislation to meet such problems, if they arise. Under the present<br />
legislation, amounts of Commonwealth funds set aside by the States<br />
during 4 year for expenditure on roads, have to be spent within six months<br />
after the end of that year. We do not intend to insist on this in future,<br />
and propose that on request by the States, the States may accumulate<br />
funds within each class during the term of the new Commonwealth Aid<br />
Roads Act, subject to the Commonwealth being satisfied that evely<br />
effort had been made to spend the money available within six months<br />
of the end of the year for which it was available The funds would<br />
be held in respect of that class by the Commonwealth until required for<br />
expenditure by the State. We are also prepared, in exceptional circumstances,<br />
to allow limited transfers between the funds. In both cases it would<br />
rest with the State concerned to seek the variation.<br />
This brings me to the matching arrangements. Under<br />
the existing legislation, each State has been required, if it was to qualify<br />
for a specified part of the total grant, to spend an equivalent amount<br />
from its own resources in excess of a base figure. For the next five<br />
years, we propose that each State should increase its expenditure on<br />
roads from its own resources at the same rate as the number of motor<br />
vehicles on register in the State. The broad objective would be to ensure<br />
that the State Governments' allocations for roads expenditure from their<br />
own resources increased progressively. The proposed requirement<br />
would not be an unduly onerous one certainly not in relation to the<br />
proposed increase of 67 per cent in the Commonwealth's contribution. </p>
<p>SThe arrangements I have outlined will, we believe,<br />
enable roads development and maintenance to match the increase in<br />
demand for roads and also achieve a significant reduction in backlog of<br />
road works. It is obvious that there will be a significant and nationwide<br />
improvement in standards. They are also designed to ensure the progressive<br />
development of a national roads system along lines best designed to<br />
serve our evolving road needs,<br />
We face a huge and complex task and one that calls<br />
for the closest co-operation between all the road authorities, both<br />
Commonwealth and State. Through co-operation much can be done to<br />
meet the problems in this field an6 develop an efficient roads system of<br />
which all of us, as Australians, can be proud.<br />
We also want to improve co-operation with the States<br />
over the wider field of transportation generally. For this reason we<br />
propose that studies be made in depth on a co-operative basis of all<br />
aspects of transportation problems in Australia.<br />
Let me crystallise the proposals in this way. The<br />
arrangements we are proposing for the next quinquennium are likely<br />
to ensure that the Commonwealth will be providing a substantially<br />
increased share of the finance for expenditure on roads.<br />
The proposed increase in our grants* will be<br />
$ 502.05 million or 67 per cent. An increase of over half a billion<br />
dollars is, we think, a very generous one and one that must considerably<br />
improve the standard of roads in this country during the next five<br />
years. </p>
