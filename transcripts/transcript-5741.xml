FOR MEDIA TUESDAY, 26 JANUARY 1982<br />
DAY OF SOLIDARITY WITH POLAND<br />
Because they dared to try to obtain for themselves some small<br />
part of the freedoms which we take for granted, the Polish<br />
people are now suffering appalling hardship and repression<br />
under martial law.<br />
The bare essentials of life are in hopelessly short supply.<br />
Thousands of workers have lost their jobs because they refused<br />
to give up their union membership.<br />
Nobody can doubt that Soviet influence stands behind the<br />
present situation. It is a scathing indictment of totalitarian<br />
systems that they cannot meet people's basic needs or recognise<br />
fundamental freedoms.<br />
January 30 is being set aside in a number of countries as a<br />
" Day of Solidarity with Poland". The Day of Solidarity has<br />
the Government'. s full support. It will give Australians the<br />
opportunity to join with people from other countries to oppose<br />
the imposition of martial law on the Polish people, and to<br />
support a return to the path of freedom.. We cannot ignore<br />
what the Polish Primate, Archbishop Glemp, only last Sunday<br />
described as " voices full of pain and distress plagued by<br />
impatience due to prolonged misery".<br />
An international television program, entitled " Let Poland be<br />
Poland", is being organised for the Day of Solidarity. I have<br />
agreed to take part in this program, together with a number<br />
of other Western%, Heads of Government including President<br />
Reagan. The Day of Solidarity provides a further opportunity for the<br />
community to make contributions in terms of practical humanitarian<br />
assistance to the people of Poland. The Government has<br />
contributed $ 1 million to the " Help Poland Live" appeal.<br />
Private humanitarian assistance is, according to the<br />
information available to the Government, apparently reaching<br />
the people for whom it is intended. The flow of private<br />
aid for the benefit of the Polish people will obviously continue<br />
with the Government's full support. </p>
