    <content><![CDATA[<p>I look forward to welcoming economic leaders, ministers, senior officials and business leaders from APEC's 21 member economies to Sydney for APEC Leaders Week.  This is the most significant gathering of its kind ever hosted by Australia.  It is a historic opportunity for us to showcase our economy, our industry and business, as well as Sydney itself.  The theme for the week is Strengthening our community, building a sustainable future.</p>
<p>APEC Business Advisory Council members begin meeting today and report to leaders later in the week.  Effective communication between business and political leaders is very important if APEC is to continue delivering for the business community.  Many of the region's most prominent business and political leaders meet on Thursday and Friday at the APEC Australia 2007 Business Summit.  WTO Director-General Lamy has come to Sydney to participate in discussions, and I will be meeting him to explore options for generating momentum in the crucial Doha Round.</p>
<p>APEC senior officials also begin talks today in support of a meeting of APEC ministers on Wednesday and Thursday which will make recommendations to APEC leaders.  The week will culminate in the APEC Economic Leaders Meeting on Saturday and Sunday.  I am confident that over these two days leaders will make real progress on the critical challenges facing our region particularly on climate change, energy security and clean development, multilateral trade and regional economic integration.</p>
<p>I will also be hosting four bilateral guest-of-government visits over coming days.  The President of China, His Excellency Hu Jintao, will visit from 3 to 9 September.  I look forward to discussions with President Hu and the signing of a number of agreements which will further strengthen our bilateral ties and our important economic relationship.  The President will visit Western Australia, Canberra and Sydney.</p>
<p>The President of the United States of America, the Honourable George W Bush, will visit from 4 to 8 September.  His visit provides a timely opportunity for discussion of important international issues and furthering the exceptionally close bilateral relationship.  A number of agreements will be concluded.  </p>
<p>The President of the Russian Federation, His Excellency Mr Vladimir Putin, will make the first ever visit to Australia by a Russian head of state from 7 to 9 September.  The visit takes place in the 200th year of official contact between our two countries.  </p>
<p>The Prime Minister of Canada, The Right Honourable Stephen Harper, will visit Australia from 6 to 11 September.  This historically close relationship is developing strongly.  The highlight of the visit will be the first address by a Canadian Prime Minister to members of both Houses of Parliament in Canberra on 11 September. </p>
