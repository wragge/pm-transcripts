PRIME MINISTER w<br />
FOR MEDIA 6 APRIL 1979<br />
MIGRANT SETTLEMENT COUNCIL FOR THE<br />
NORTHERN TERRITORY<br />
The Prime Minister today announced the composition of an<br />
eight-member Migrant Settlement Council for the<br />
Northern Territory.<br />
The Council is one of eight to be established one for each<br />
State and Territory to supervise development of an<br />
initial settlement programme for newly-arrived migrants.<br />
Its formation is a further step in implementing the $ 50 million<br />
package recommended by the Galbally Report for upgrading migrant<br />
services and programmes over the next three years.<br />
" The composition of the Northern Territory Council reflects the<br />
many facets of community concern with migrant welfare: Federal,<br />
State and Territorial Governments, non-Government organisations<br />
and ethnic communities', Mr. Fraser said.<br />
" The Settlement Councils will be concerned with implementing<br />
programmes that meet local needs and it is essential, therefore,<br />
that members have the support of the wider Australian community.<br />
" I am certain that the calibre of the people who have been<br />
chosen to serve on the Northern Territory Council will<br />
attract and justify that support".<br />
Mr. Fraser said an important aspect of the work of the Councils<br />
would be to engage the voluntary sector which played such an<br />
important role in Australian welfare services. The Galbally<br />
Report points out, it is most important that the voluntary<br />
sector, including ethnic groups, should establish links with<br />
incoming migrants as soon as possible.<br />
