    <content><![CDATA[<p>I am pleased to have signed today with Premier Vivian and Prime Minister Clark the Niue International Trust Fund Deed.</p>
<p>The deed formally establishes the Niue trust fund which will provide a long-term, dependable revenue stream for Niue's economic development.  Today's signing sets in place the formal legal arrangements for the fund's operation.</p>
<p>I announced at the Pacific Islands Forum in 2004 a contribution of $4 million towards establishment of the fund. Since that time, Australia has provided a further $1 million to the fund account through the Government's overseas aid programme.</p>
<p>The trust fund will help Niue improve existing levels of social and economic infrastructure and services.  Management of it will be overseen by a three-member Board of Directors, including a representative from Australia.  The fund is modelled on the successful Tuvalu trust fund which has been in operation since 1987 and to which Australia has also contributed.</p>
<p>  Australia and Niue enjoy a friendly relationship, based on shared membership of Pacific regional organisations and development assistance.</p>
