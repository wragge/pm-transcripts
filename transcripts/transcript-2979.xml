PRIME MITISmTR'S VISIT TO MEXICO<br />
The following is the text of the communique issued at<br />
0 the conclusion of the visit to Mexico by the Prime Minister and<br />
Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Whitlam:-<br />
At the invitation of the President of the Republic, His<br />
Excellency Mr Luis Echevarria, the Prime Minister of Australia, the<br />
Honourable Gough Whitlam, made an official visit to<br />
Mexico from 24 to 28 July 1973. The visit was notable also as the<br />
first by an Australian Prime Minister to a country of Latin America.<br />
0 During the talks which took place between the two lenders,<br />
SPrime Minister Whitlam and President Echevarria exchanged views on<br />
matters of bilateral interest as well world problems. These exchanges<br />
took nlace in an extremely cordial atmosphere reflecting the growing<br />
community of interest between Australia and Mexico, as two Pacific countries<br />
Of Darticular concern in their discussions were the<br />
possibilities that exist of develoning and strengthening the<br />
relations between Australia and Mexico, having regard to the new<br />
nolicies of the Australian Government which are progressive like<br />
those of the Mexican Government. / 2 </p>
<p>-2-<br />
The Prime Minister and the President recognised that the<br />
different characteristics of Australia and Mexico in no way limit<br />
or exclude the possibility of close relations in the fields of<br />
cultural, economic and social development, but that on the contrary<br />
differences can complement each other, especially in the economic<br />
field. In order to bring about such aspirations it was considered<br />
anpropriate that the two Governments should study ways to overcome<br />
the problems inherent in the relatively great distance separating<br />
the two countries. In the light of the problems that face a very important<br />
O sector of the nations of the world, the President and the Prime<br />
Minister expressed their conviction that it is necessary to make<br />
further efforts aimed at balancing economic relations between the<br />
industrialised countries and the developing countries.<br />
SBoth leaders declared their conviction that Mexico as<br />
well as Australia can play a decisive role in the task of reconstructing<br />
on a sound, realistic and eauitable basis both international<br />
O trade and exchange of technology in order that the countries of the<br />
Third World may obtain the just benefits which are their due.<br />
Prime Minister Whitlam assured President Echevarria that his<br />
Government would continue to approach the international meetings<br />
concerned with the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States<br />
in a sympathetic and constructive manner. Both leaders were<br />
hopeful that such discussions could lead to a wide agreement making<br />
possible the adoption of such an instrument at an early session of<br />
the United Nations General Assembly. ./ 3 </p>
<p>-3-<br />
The Australian Prime Minister referred in terms of warm<br />
praise to the Treaty of Tlatelolco. The Prime Minister and the<br />
President recognised the benefits inherent in the establishment of<br />
a nuclear free zone in Latin America. Both leaders reaffirmed their<br />
strong opposition to the current and future testing of nuclear<br />
weapons, particularly in the atmosphere. The two Governments agreed<br />
to cooperate in all appropriate forums to bring all nuclear weapons<br />
testing to an end.<br />
In the course of their talks the President and the Prime<br />
Minister had a detailed discussion on questions relating to the law<br />
of the sea. The Prime Minister took notice with interest of Mexico's<br />
position in favor of the patrimonial sea. In this regard they firmly<br />
supported the aim of a considerable number of states to exercise<br />
exclusive fishery rights in a zone adjacent to the territorial sea<br />
up to a distance of 200 miles. They also supported the aim of these<br />
states to sovereignty over seabed resources in a wide zone adj2cent<br />
to their coasts. In analysing the commercial exchange between Australia<br />
and Mexico they noted that this has been reduced and they decided<br />
that their Governments should examine the best means of raising<br />
trade relations to their existing potential and taking advantage<br />
of the complementary character of their respective economies. As<br />
an immediate possibility for the increase in trade between the<br />
two countries and the benefits therein they agreed that it was<br />
necessary to prevent the erection of barriers to trade.<br />
The Prime Minister referred to the new measures S../ 4 </p>
<p>-4-<br />
established by his Government to reduce import tariffs, including<br />
new preferential arrangements for developing countries.<br />
Mexico will be able to take advantage of these measures<br />
to increase oprortunities for exports to Australia. Both leaders<br />
exchanged points of view on the possibilities to effect co-investment<br />
projects in Mexico. To this end the Government of Mexico invited an<br />
Australian mission to study, on site, the possibilities that Mexico<br />
offers in this area.<br />
Both leaders referred with satisfaction to the close<br />
collaboration that had existed between Australia and Mexico for<br />
many years in a wide range of international organisations. They<br />
decided that such coope-ration between the representatives of the<br />
two countries should be further intensified. In particular, the<br />
President ex-nressed Mexico's satisfaction for the new interest<br />
displayed by the Government of Australia in sending representatives<br />
to observe conferences concerned with ILatin America.<br />
Both leaders considered that it is necessary to<br />
encourage tourism between the twvo countries as well as an exchange<br />
of students and young technicians. Their Governments would study<br />
the most efficient methods to attain these ends.<br />
The President and the Prime Minister agreed that their<br />
Governments will proceed immediately to establish the basis for<br />
the development of scientific and technical exchanges between<br />
Australia and Mexico. The President of Mexico aelcomed the<br />
suggestion by the Prime Minister of Australia that cooperation<br />
between Australia and Mexico, for examTnle in the field of </p>
<p>agricultural science, should be increased immediately. To that<br />
end Mr Whitlam, as a first step, extended an invitation to the<br />
Government of Mexico to send to Australia, during the period<br />
1973-74, two Mexican graduates to pursue studies in Australia on<br />
this field. The President invited the Prime Minister to send a grouD<br />
of young technicians and professors to make studies at the Commission<br />
for the Study of the National Territory ( C7T7NAL). The President<br />
and the Prime Minister made reciprocal offers to create<br />
scholarships for graduates of different disciplines.<br />
The Prime Minister invited the President to visit Australia.<br />
The President accepted the invitation and pending the setting of<br />
a date, high level Mexican officials will go to Australia in the<br />
near future. </p>
