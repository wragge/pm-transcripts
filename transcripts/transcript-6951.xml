TRANSCRIPT OF MIKE WILLESEE 11 JUNE 1986<br />
E 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
WILLESEE: Does this mean you have now taken a more direct<br />
responsibility for the economy?<br />
PM: In one sense, but I want to say that I am deeply indebted to<br />
the assistance I have received from Paul Keating, who has been<br />
shoulder to shoulder with me in the preparation of this material.<br />
And I also thank my colleagues on the ministerial committee who<br />
have been involved with me. But it is the case Mike that as<br />
Prime Minister and particularly in a time of crisis I have to be<br />
up front, out there leading. That is what I am doing.<br />
WILLESEE: You realise the purpose of the question of course,<br />
coming right after your clash with the Treasurer. Is his status<br />
as Treasurer diminished in any way by this?<br />
PM: I believe not. Let me say, and I can say it with absolute<br />
sincerity, the personal relations between Paul Keating and myself<br />
are as close as they have ever been and my confidence in his<br />
capacity is undiminished.<br />
WILLESEE: Did he collaborate and did he endorse the address?<br />
PM: Entirely. I could not have had a greater degree of close<br />
collaboration and if I may say so in the best sense of the word,<br />
comradeship, in the preparation of this because Paul knew that it<br />
was going to be the Prime Minister up front in economic matters.<br />
I could not have received more assistance from him.<br />
WILLESEE: Prime minister, would you agree that this is more like<br />
a pep-talk from the national coach rather than a set of<br />
government decisions?<br />
PM: On the contrary, while it's not lacking in a pep-talk,<br />
certainly that has got to be there. It is replete with specific<br />
hard decisions, not only in the statement I have made to the<br />
nation, but in the examination also of the fuller statement that<br />
has been released tonight. And may I say, as far as the economic<br />
future of the country is concerned, some very hard decisions in<br />
the area of wages policy, in the area of government expenditure<br />
not only my government, but my indication of the hard line that </p>
<p>will be taken with the Premiers. We are about creating, within<br />
the area of our responsibility and opportunity, the appropriate<br />
economic environment to enable Australian industry to rise to<br />
this challenge.<br />
WILLESEE: Well, you have talked about tough decisions. You said<br />
in your statement that you would rather risk electoral defeat<br />
than take soft options. But my guess is, with respect, that a<br />
lot of people will be asking where are the hard options the<br />
specific decisions.<br />
PM: Let's nominate them.<br />
WILLESEE: I have got them chronologically, if you would like me<br />
to take you through them? Your call for wage restrictions. Now<br />
is that a tough decision by government, or a request.<br />
PM: Let me say that under our institutional arrangements, the<br />
Arbitration Commission sets wages not the government. But what I<br />
have flagged very clearly is this that the decision coming out<br />
of the current case should be the only national wage case this<br />
year. There shouldn't be another one before the 1st January<br />
1987, Mike. And I have said that as we read the economic<br />
situation we will be going into that next case and arguing for a<br />
further discount.<br />
WILLESEE: Has the ACTU indicated it will comply with your<br />
request?<br />
PM: No, it has not. And that is in the nature of the Accord<br />
that there is the right to the parties to the Accord to take into<br />
account the economic circumstances. It is my responsibility on<br />
behalf of the people of Australia as a whole to analyse the<br />
economic situation and to say what we think is necessary. And we<br />
will be putting that to the Arbitration Commission. Under the<br />
Accord, there will be discussions with the ACTU but we will be<br />
putting that position to the Commission.<br />
WILLESEE: Restraint on executive salaries of course is a<br />
request.<br />
PM: Yes,' we have no constitutional or institutional capacities<br />
to do more than make that request. Let me say this that under<br />
the Advisory Council on Prices and Incomes, which was set up<br />
following the 1983 summit, that we wrote to the major<br />
organisations and the heads of major companies around Australia<br />
asking that such restraint should be exercised. And Mr Willis<br />
has said, both to me privately and he has said publicly that for<br />
a long period the business community responded positively in this<br />
regard. Unfortunately, in the later period there has been on the<br />
evidence a breakout in that area. I will be writing again to the<br />
business organisations and to individual businesses asking that<br />
they exercise the same restraint. And I want to make it clear,<br />
it is the case that wage and salary earners, by definition, </p>
<p>constitute the largest sector of the national income and<br />
therefore there has to be restraint in that area. -But it is<br />
going to be much easier to expect such restraint from the<br />
ordinary workers of this country, who I believe, will respond if<br />
in fact they see that those who are not by law subject to the<br />
same institutional and constitutional restraints, voluntarily<br />
exercise that restraint. I hope and expect that that will be<br />
done.<br />
WILLESEE: Price increases to be kept to a minimum, that is also<br />
a request?<br />
PM: We have no constitutional power to control prices. we have<br />
set up the Prices Surveillance Authority. I have made it clear<br />
in my statement that I expect the business community of Australia<br />
to exercise great responsibility and restraint in this area. And<br />
it is in their own interests, as well as the interests of the<br />
Australian economy, that they should I have made it clear<br />
that whatever assistance the Prices Surveillance Authority<br />
requests from the Government to increase their efficacy will be<br />
forthcoming from the Government.<br />
WILLESEE: Do you mean a bigger budget?<br />
PM: For them?<br />
WILLESEE: Yes.<br />
PM: I don't know that they will be asking for more resources but<br />
if they were to make an increase for more resources, and in a<br />
context where we could see that that would produce more<br />
efficiency in the exercise of surveillance over prices then we<br />
would consider that sympathetically.<br />
WILLESEE: But isn't that a bit vague?<br />
PM: No, it is not vague. It is not vague beyond what the<br />
constitutional limitations upon us are. I don't believe in, and<br />
nor may I say is the trade union movement, asking for price<br />
control because we believe that that would be counter-productive.<br />
But we do want the business community to embrace the voluntary<br />
guidelines in regard to the operation of the Prices Surveillance<br />
Authority as have been outlined. I believe they should do that.<br />
And I think the Australian community is going to become very,<br />
very much more conscious of the pricing decisions of business<br />
because the ordinary Australian who understands, I believe,<br />
without knowing all the economic theory of it, but I think they<br />
understand that we do face a challenge. I believe that they will<br />
be prepared to co-operate. But they will expect the business<br />
community to co-operate. And I hope that the Australian<br />
community will themselves exercise surveillance over prices. * And<br />
part of the thing that we can do with the Prices Surveillance<br />
Authority, I think, is to ensure that the mechanisms of the<br />
Authority are improved to enable the communication, the better </p>
<p>communication, between the Authority and the public. And we have<br />
now specifically designated a Minister, Mr Hurford, who is the<br />
Minister assisting Paul Keating, to accept specific<br />
responsibility in this area of prices.<br />
WILLESEE: You say there will be tough decisions in the budget<br />
this year. And you say you have identified savings of $ 1<br />
billion, but you don't say that you will save it.<br />
PM: I wasn't playing with words because we haven't completed the<br />
budget process. I can assure as the chairman of the Expenditure<br />
Review Committee that we have spent countless hours already going<br />
through the Government's own programs. And when I say we have<br />
identified, I am not saying well we have ticked them off and it<br />
is not going to happen. That is where we have got so far, there<br />
is more to be done. And the appropriate place basically for the<br />
revelation of the Government's approach in the budget area and<br />
the savings that it will have effected, of course, is in the<br />
budget. There was no cleverness, Mike, intended by using the<br />
word identified.<br />
WILLESEE: But it is not hard decision?<br />
PM: Yes, it is.<br />
WILLESEE: To identify?<br />
PM: I am saying that it was not appropriate to tick off what<br />
those items are at this stage because the budget process isn't<br />
completed. I can assure you and the people of Australia, Mike,<br />
that those savings will be made.<br />
WILLESEE: Do you undertake to reduce the deficit this year?<br />
PM: One thing that you have got to understand is that if the<br />
wages outcome that we are seeking eventuates, that of itself,<br />
will have the effect of significantly increasing the budget<br />
deficit because you see, if we reduce the wages outcome below<br />
what would have been anticipated before, that significantly<br />
reduces the Government collections under PAYE.<br />
WILLESEE: That is right, but that is you requesting again. You<br />
are seeking the co-operation for the national good to do that.<br />
But are you going to take a tough decision you keep talking<br />
about tough decisions and say we will reduce the deficit.<br />
PM: We are aiming to reduce to deficit. But I am simply saying<br />
that if you get an additional billion dollars on your deficit as<br />
a result of the beneficial result of reducing the wages outcome,<br />
th'af-is an element which will make that task harder. That is all<br />
I am saying. We will operate within the Trilogy to further<br />
reduce the deficit as a proportion of the GDP. Since we have<br />
come into office we have halved the deficit as a proportion of<br />
GDP. We will continue to do that Mike. </p>
<p>WILLESEE: You talked about the opportunity for those on the dole<br />
to undertake community work. Now are you talking about something<br />
voluntary or compulsory?<br />
PM: The framework that we've got in mind is that we believe, and<br />
I certainly know talking with young people, that they want to do<br />
something for the dole. I mean they would much prefer to have a<br />
job. They want to do something for the community. So what we'll<br />
be doing in consultation and co-operation with the relevant<br />
organisations in the community is to try and build up a bank of<br />
community work that can be done by the people who are in receipt<br />
of unemployment benefits. The question of compulsion is not<br />
relevant, I think, in a sense that because of the judgment that I<br />
make about the young people on unemployment benefits there will<br />
be more people wanting to do this than there will be jobs<br />
available. WILLESEE: So you're not planning something compulsory?<br />
PM: It's not compulsory in the sense that you will have the<br />
relationship between more jobs to be done and people to do them.<br />
If as time goes on you've got a situation where you developed a<br />
large number of community jobs and you were to get a position<br />
where people were saying no we're not going to do them then<br />
the Government would have to look at that position.<br />
WILLESEE: That's not taking a tough decision saying you'll have<br />
to have a look at it. What do you intend?<br />
PM: Look Mike, it is taking a very firm decision that what we're<br />
going to do is create a situation where the community is not just<br />
paying out very large sums of money for unemployment benefit and<br />
there is no nexus between society and~ the unemployed other than<br />
this quite sterile thing of handing over a dole cheque. when you<br />
talk about compulsion it involves the assumption that the people<br />
on the unemployment. benefit, particularly the young, don't want<br />
to do something for the community, they do. I know that they do.<br />
our problem, in my judgment will be, as a community, finding<br />
enough community jobs to satisfy the demand that there will be<br />
from the unemployed. Now if we reach the situation where we are<br />
able, as a community, to create that many jobs, these would be<br />
the number of people who are wanting to do them, and people were<br />
saying no we're not going to do it, then I think the community,<br />
in that circumstance, would want the Government to look at that<br />
next step you're talking about. But what the community rightly<br />
wants is not just to be in a situation where they're handing out<br />
money and that's the end of their relationship with the<br />
unemployed. And that's what we're going to do.<br />
WILLESEE: Are you threatening compulsion?<br />
PM: The very thing this Government is about is not threats.<br />
That's not the way you run a co-operative society, a society<br />
that's going to address itself to problems. If I thought that </p>
<p>what we face was a great number of unemployed, who simply don't<br />
want to do any work and of course there are some of those but<br />
overwhelmingly the unemployed in this community want to have a<br />
relationship with the community which is not simply a taking of<br />
money. They want to do something. The community wants them to<br />
do something. As a Government we're going to satisfy that nexus.<br />
WILLESEE: So isn't this more a social matter than a cost saving<br />
matter? PM: No I don't think it's just a social matter, although<br />
primarily I want to satisfy what the community wantsand what the<br />
unemployed want. That is a productive relationship between the<br />
community and the unemployed. There will be economic<br />
implications to it in this way. I think to the extent that we<br />
can get the unemployed doing something in the community, other<br />
than just taking the unemployment benefit, that that-will give<br />
them an experience, that will be of assistance to them. That is<br />
an economic advantage. It may be that as people see that this<br />
practice is going to develop of doing some community work, it may<br />
for some of them say I'd rather go, I'd rather try harder to go<br />
out and get a job in the market. If that is of significant<br />
dimensions it will have an economic impact. But what we've<br />
really got to do is, as far as we can as a society, to have a<br />
positive productive relationship between the society and those<br />
who at this stage can't get a job. That's what the community<br />
wants. It's what the unemployed wants. And that's what we're<br />
going try and bring about.<br />
WILLESEE: So you're not saying at this stage whether it will<br />
cost money or save money?<br />
PM: I don't think at this stage that you can make that final<br />
judgment for this reason, it's quite obvious that in creating<br />
these community sort of jobs that we're talking about there will<br />
be some cost element. Basically it will be supervision, not<br />
capital sums involved.. So there'll be some money for<br />
supervision. I think the community will be saying, in net terms<br />
even if there were to be some cost they would much rather have a<br />
situation in which the unemployed are doing some things for the<br />
community. What I'm saying, particularly from the point of view<br />
of the unemployed, and I had a great deal of experience during<br />
that Priority One period, that the kids themselves are saying<br />
Mr Hawke, we don't just want to get the dole, isn't there some<br />
things that we can do. If there's not a job, of course we'd like<br />
to get a job, but if there's not a job we'd like to be doing some<br />
things and that's admirable and I think the attitude of the<br />
community is right.<br />
WILLESE Prime Minister just briefly to wind up. Rip-offs in<br />
the welfare system are estimated variously between $ 100 million<br />
and $ 1 billion. will you be making concerted efforts towards<br />
fixing that problem? </p>
<p>7<br />
PM: Yes. And as Brian Howe, the Minister has said in the<br />
Parliament and elsewhere, this Government has done more than any<br />
other to tighten up the administration of the social security<br />
sector and Brian is currently working in this area, as well in<br />
the work test area, to try and ensure that as far as possible the<br />
resources of this community shall only go to those who are in<br />
need. ends </p>
