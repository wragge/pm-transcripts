PRIME MINISTER<br />
CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
BHP CENTENARY DINNER MELBOURNE 13 AUGUST 1985<br />
Ladies and gentlemen. I very much appreciate this<br />
opportunity to join you tonight.<br />
This celebration by BHP of its centenary is a very<br />
special occasion.<br />
The last 100 years have seen BHIP prosper.<br />
It is now the largest Australian company, and a<br />
very large company by world standards, rating equal<br />
to some of the companies in the top 50 US<br />
corporations.<br />
BHP's magnificent centenary publication " Australians in<br />
Company" has vividly documented BlIP's rise to the great<br />
enterprise it is today.<br />
There was the move into iron and steel, which<br />
started it along the path to being a leading force<br />
in Australia's secondary industry.<br />
There was the development of minerals exploration,<br />
mining and export.<br />
There was the development of energy resources,<br />
particularly in Bass Strait and on the North West<br />
Shelf, and<br />
There was the move offshore, most particularly by<br />
the purchase of Utah, to become a substantial<br />
multinational corporation.<br />
The development of BHP through these phases mirrored the<br />
development of Australia itself: </p>
<p>The development of an indigenous iron and steel<br />
industry, and the associated metal handling<br />
industries was an important part of the industrial<br />
development of Australia, and is still an important<br />
contributor to the vitality of Australian<br />
manufacturing industry.<br />
The development of Australia's resources,<br />
particularly minerals, has played a crucial part in<br />
generating exports, in stimulating economic growth,<br />
and in fostering closer ties to other countries<br />
through international trade.<br />
Two features of BHP's performance stand out.<br />
BHP always has always been known for its technical<br />
proficiency in resource-related industries.<br />
BHP has in recent time made a most successful<br />
effort to restructure itself, to orient itself more<br />
closely towards the international marketplace,<br />
within the new international disciplines to<br />
strengthen efficiency and competitiveness, and to<br />
take advantage of opportunities provided throughout<br />
the world.<br />
Australia needs competitive, outward looking companies,<br />
companies that know the recipe of long-term success.<br />
Only in this way will the Australian economy grow and<br />
afford all Australian a better standard of living. Only<br />
in this way can real inroads be made into the<br />
unemployment queues and secure employment be provided at<br />
the high living standards which Australians, rightly,<br />
expect.<br />
We have seen these processes begin their work in the<br />
Australian economy in the last two years. As the<br />
economy has been turned around, as Australian industry<br />
has adjusted and conditions of international<br />
competitiveness have been reestablished, the employment<br />
situation in this country has been transformed.<br />
Unemployment has now been reduced to 8.2 per cent, the<br />
lowest level in nearly three years and the total number<br />
of new jobs created since the Summit has reached over<br />
410,000 well on the way to our three year target of<br />
500,000 new jobs.<br />
If these gains are to be maintained, sound<br />
macro-economic policies will have to be sustained. It<br />
is particularly important that, within the framework of<br />
the Accord, labour cost pressures continue to be<br />
controlled. Certainly the Government for its part will<br />
be acting responsibly to ensure that a debilitating </p>
<p>inflationary spiral does not emerge out of the cost<br />
pressures that have become apparent since the<br />
devaluation. This will be an important factor in<br />
sustaining Australian industry competitiveness.<br />
Restoring industry competitiveness also requires a sound<br />
Government industry policy.<br />
The Government's approach to the problems of the steel<br />
industry immediately after we came to office was a clear<br />
example of what was needed.<br />
The steel industry in early 1983 was experiencing major<br />
difficulties to which quotas on imports were an<br />
ineffective and inappropriate response.<br />
Now, following nearly two years of the steel plan and<br />
nearly two years since quotas were replaced with<br />
assistance more relevant to the market, the steel<br />
division is again profitable with a more certain future.<br />
The Government is determined that assistance<br />
arrangements not become a substitute for improved<br />
efficiency; rather assistance should be short-term and<br />
the minimum necessary to encourage industry to<br />
reorganise and become more competitive.<br />
A recent most noteable example of BHP's involvement in<br />
an exercise of great national significance has been the<br />
company's key role in the development with China of the<br />
Australian iron and steel initiative.<br />
The development of the Chinese economy holds great<br />
promise for commercial co-operation between Australia<br />
and China. In no industrial sector is there greater<br />
complementarity and hence opportunity for cooperation<br />
between our two countries than in iron<br />
and steel.<br />
The Government, through a program of frequent high-level<br />
contacts with Chinese leaders and the establishment of<br />
the Iron and Steel initiative, has provided official<br />
momentum for the pursuit of opportunities by commercial<br />
entities in both countries.<br />
BHP has been at the forefront in developing the<br />
commercial aspects of co-operation, most rapidly in<br />
relation to manganese and iron ore exports, and<br />
semi-processed steel from Whyalla and the east<br />
coast centres. Together we look forward to the<br />
conclusion of further and larger contracts, to the<br />
benefit of all parties. </p>
<p>In the final analysis, it is up to individual companies<br />
to take advantage of the opportunities afforded them.<br />
BHP has positioned itself well to meet the emerging<br />
challenges. It has expanded its activities by diversifying<br />
widely in Australia and by purchasing international<br />
assets. Utah is the most spectacular.<br />
It has reorganised its own management and operating<br />
structure announced under the banner " Organising<br />
for Profit and Growth" to reflect its new pattern<br />
of activities.<br />
The diversity of BHP's trade, often involving both raw<br />
materials and processed products, requires it to be<br />
aware of any sensitivities in the world market. The new<br />
corporate plan facilitates the flow of communication<br />
within the management structure, essential if BHP is to<br />
take full advantage of opportunities offered to its<br />
different corporate activities.<br />
I believe that BHP has every reason to be confident of<br />
the future: A future based. on outward-looking, competitive<br />
attitudes to international trade.<br />
A future which recognises the advantages of a<br />
properly structured management.<br />
A future where productivity levels and new<br />
activities see competitiveness in world markets<br />
maintained.<br />
BHiP and the strength of the Australian economy, are<br />
closed intertwined. This is particularly apparent in<br />
BHP's role in the development of Australia' s national<br />
mineral and energy resources.<br />
The framework established for the development of these<br />
resources allows this to be done in a manner beneficial<br />
to all Australians.<br />
BHP plays an important part in that process.<br />
A process always evolving as was most recently<br />
attested through the announcement of the go-ahead<br />
for the export stage of the North West Shelf. </p>
<p>BHP's further spectacular move to multinational status<br />
involves it in a new order of responsibility. It will<br />
inevitably bring it into closer contact with the<br />
aspirations and policies of a range of Governments.<br />
BHP's move in this direction this internationalising<br />
of BHP mirrors closely the internationalising of the<br />
Australian economy during the term of this Government.<br />
Our decisions to float the dollar, to permit foreign<br />
bank entry and to pursue a committed course of<br />
deregulation of foreign exchange markets have<br />
transformed the Australian economic scene.<br />
These have been paralleled by our steady progress to<br />
open Australian production of goods gradually to greater<br />
international competition, notably in steel, motor<br />
vehicles, textiles, clothing and footwear and ( the<br />
Senate willing) dairy products.<br />
In a quite unprecedented way Australia is now open to<br />
the challenges and opportunities of the international<br />
market place.<br />
BHP is obviously a key player in this new scene.<br />
Certainly, in the last 100 years it has a proven track<br />
record in Australia. It has worked hard for its name<br />
" Australia's BHP". It has done so on the basis of the<br />
contribution to the company and to this country of many<br />
thousands of Australians.<br />
Sir James Balderstone, in his forward to<br />
" Australians in Company", said " Today and for the<br />
years immediately ahead the company sees its<br />
mission as achieving profitable growth servicing<br />
diverse markets as a competitive international<br />
producer and supplier of resource-related products<br />
and services, while growing in other areas by<br />
making use of the expertise drawn from its existing<br />
businesses"<br />
BHP's success in this mission is important to all of us.<br />
Certainly I know everyone here joins me in<br />
congratulating BHP on its centenary and joins me in<br />
wishing it every success in the next 100 years.<br />
It is my particular pleasure now formally to ask all<br />
guests to join me in toasting the past success and<br />
future prosperity of BHP. </p>
