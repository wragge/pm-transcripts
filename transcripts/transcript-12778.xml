    <content><![CDATA[<p>
The death of Neil O';Reilly is a sad loss to Australian journalism.  I remember Neil well from his time in the Federal Parliamentary Press Gallery in Canberra.  He was a decent, honourable person to deal with and had a keen nose for a good story.<br />
He always behaved with great civility and professionalism, balancing his journalistic pursuits with a good sense of humour.  I extend my sympathy to his wife and family. </p>
