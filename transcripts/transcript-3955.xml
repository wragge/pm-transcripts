PRIME MINISTER'S WEEKLY BROADCAST<br />
RMR FRASER'S CLOWNS<br />
SUNDAY 2 NOVEMBER 1975<br />
I don't suppose there has ever been a time when the<br />
Opposition's behaviour has come closer to sheer knockabout<br />
farce than it did during the past week. At the centre of<br />
it all was the continuing drama of Mr Khemlani. For days<br />
we were led to believe by the Opposition and the press that<br />
Mr Kheilani had the answer to all Mr Eraser' s prayers<br />
evidence which would somehow incriminate the Government and<br />
justify the Opposition in blocking the national Budget.<br />
Mr Khemlani's documents, we were told, would prove that<br />
the Prime Minister . had been associated in the loan raising<br />
activities of thn Government,<br />
Mind you, I have never been able to understand why<br />
a Prime Minister should not be associated with the loan raising<br />
activities of the Government it would be extraordinary and<br />
reprehensible if he were not. But let that pass. Mr Khemlani<br />
duly arrived in Canberra. The world waited with bated<br />
breath while his luggage -was examined by the Opposition.<br />
Now my colleague, Fred Daly, has a well known talent<br />
for humour, so I thought I'd read from an account he gave to<br />
Parliament of what happened on Mr Khcmlani's arrival.<br />
Fred Daly had been studying all the press reports of thse<br />
incidents, so naturally his version is authentic. He pointed<br />
out that a Comnmonwealth car was booked by the Deputy Leader<br />
of the Opposition to meet Mr Khemlani on his z. rrival at<br />
Canberra Airport. He was greeted by members cf Mr Lynch's<br />
staff. Fred Daly went on:<br />
" Mr Khemlani was then pushed into the Commonwealth car<br />
along with 2 sinister bearded staff members and taken<br />
on a high speed car chase through the back streets of<br />
Fyshwick reaching speeds of 100 kilometres per hour,<br />
turning down side streets, and doing sudden U turns<br />
before coming to a sudden stop at his destination<br />
a $ 23 a night room at the Hotel Wellington. Mr<br />
Khemlani, still using the car, and the men then disappeared<br />
into room 49 the room adjoining the motel shoe-shine<br />
box. Lemonade, potato chips and 2 Sydney afternoon<br />
papers were pushed through the breadfast hatch. He<br />
stayed locked in his room while the staff members<br />
stayed huddled in a corner sifting through his 8<br />
suitcases of documents. Later in the afternoon Mr Khemlani<br />
was taken on another high speed car chase. This time,<br />
as a taxi pulled up at the front of the motel,<br />
Mr Khemlani disappeared out the back door and sped off<br />
in a late model gold Torana with the manager of the<br />
Wellington Hotel at the wheel. That is service. It<br />
raced through the peak hour traffic, went one and a half<br />
times round State Circle, and reached speeds of up to<br />
120 kilometers along Commonwealth Avenue before swinging<br />
around and returning to the hotel. Then Mr Khemlani<br />
dis ineared." </p>
<p>2.<br />
That waG Fred Daly's account. Of course, the<br />
real embarrassment for the Opposition canme later, when<br />
SMr Khemlani's" documents" were examined by Mr Ellicott, their<br />
appointed spokesman on Aboriginal Affairs of all things.<br />
Presumably it was felt that Mr Ellicott's'; legal training<br />
could quickly enable him to : ac. ' sc the documents as evidenc.<br />
As it happened, Mr Ellicott promptly offe: red his considered, . ind<br />
no doubt honest opinion, that the documents proved nothing.<br />
They did not implicate the Prime Minister in any wuy. To use<br />
his own words: " There is no direct evidecnce in the documents<br />
I saw which involved the Prime Minister." But that wasn't ( jood<br />
: enough for the Opposition. Mr Ellicott war summoned to a<br />
meeting of the Shadow Cabinet and later issued another statement<br />
saying that while there were not documents passing between<br />
Mr Khemlani and the Prime Minister, he was sure the Prime Minister<br />
was involved. I was reminded of Mr Chipo's humiliation a few<br />
weeks ago when he stated publicly that the Liberals would scrap<br />
Medibank and was later persuaded to issue a statement saying<br />
the Liberals would do nothing of the kind. The trouble with<br />
Mr Fraser's shadow ministers is that they are often too candid<br />
for Mr Fraser's comfort and too outspoken for their own good.<br />
While the so-called loans scandal was collapsing<br />
around the Opposition's heads, some pretty large cracks<br />
were appearing in the temple of Liberals unity which Mr Fraser<br />
has proclaimed. Mr Fraser keeps saying that he won't yield<br />
on this issue, but what about his senators, what about his<br />
friends and followers? His whole case depends on getting an<br />
election for the House of Representatives as soon as possible.<br />
That's the purpose of the whole discreditable exercise a<br />
quick election. Yet Mr McMahon, a former Prime Minister, was on<br />
the radio this week telling us that he didn't know when the next<br />
election would be held. I quote him " It might not be in<br />
the immediate future, it might be a little later on, next year<br />
or even the year after." Obviously the former Prime Minister<br />
isn't too confident that an election will be held before 1977:<br />
and we all know the views of Mr Gorton, the Liberal<br />
Prime Minister before that.<br />
The truth is that behind these sideshow antics there<br />
remains a grave threat to the nation's economy, to social order<br />
and our democratic institutions The farcical side of the<br />
Opposition's conduct is in marked contrast to the behaviour<br />
of the more responsible Opposition senators. Senator Bessell,<br />
for example, can see very clearly the perils involved.<br />
Senator Bessell is -one of a small groups of Liberals who have<br />
grave reservations about Mr Fraser's chosen course. Senator<br />
Bessell said firmly this week that he would never vote against<br />
the Budget, and he added again I quote good many others<br />
would feel the same way as I do." All that Senator Bessell and<br />
his group are prepared to do is defer the Budget. Only in this<br />
way, on this tenuous measure of support, can Mr Fraser sustain<br />
his threat to deprive the Government of the taxpayers' money and<br />
bring the nation to a standstill.<br />
We had a very good illustration of the anxieties of<br />
these senators during an incident in the Senate on Wednesday.<br />
Senator Missen and Senator Baume two of the waverers, the </p>
<p>" jellyfish" as Mr I" raser's people contemptuously call them<br />
were presenting petitions fi.: cm Australian citizens prot esting<br />
at the opposition's tactics. Senator Greenwood objected to the<br />
petitions being received. Senator Missen and Senator Baumne, to<br />
their great credit, insisted on the right of the Australian<br />
people to protest. It was a revealing moment. It came 24<br />
hours after another Liberal, Senator Wlood, failed to turn<br />
up for a division on one of the crucial money bill~ s.<br />
The way things have been going for Mr Franer, we<br />
can hardly be surprised by the results of the latest opinion<br />
polls. Normially it's my practice not to comment on opinion<br />
polls, but the recent surveys have been so unanimous, so<br />
clear-cut-so decisive and essentially so relevanrt, to the<br />
nature and origins of the present crisis that no one can ignore<br />
them. Certainly Mr Fraser can't ignore them. The polls<br />
show that 70 percent -of the people believe the Senate should<br />
pass the Budget; well over half the people believe the<br />
Government should remain in office. it is rare for any opinion<br />
poll on a matter of basic political allegiance to produce<br />
a result so unmistakable, so overwhelming; but in the present<br />
context the polls have a special significance. Mr Fraser<br />
has tried to justify his action in blocking supply by repeated<br />
claims that the people were demanding the Governmient's disis-sal.<br />
He talked of a great upsurge-of public opinion, a rising tide<br />
of anger, a veritable public clamour to see the Government<br />
removed. These lofty insights into the national mood, so<br />
mysteriously vouchsafed to Mr Fraser, are now revealed as<br />
illusions if indeed Mr Fraser ever really believed them.<br />
If Mr Fraser wants to liv e by the polls, let him now accept<br />
the verdict of the polls. The people have given him their<br />
answer with dramatic clarity. They want an end to the farce;<br />
an end to the fruitless fishing expeditions of the past week,<br />
with their wild charges, their web of innuendo, the car<br />
chases and suitcases; and end to these threats of economic<br />
and social disruption; an end to this challenge to our<br />
democratic system. Mr Fraser has one course only left open<br />
to him. Hie must let the Budget pass. Hle must let the<br />
Government govern. He must let the economy and the nation<br />
go forward. </p>
