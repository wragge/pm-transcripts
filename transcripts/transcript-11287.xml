    <content><![CDATA[<p align="left">It is with great pleasure that I open Australiaâs first Rural Transaction Centre in Eugowra, New South Wales.</p>
<p>I congratulate the people of Eugowra on their initiative in putting together an excellent proposal and working with the Federal Government to bring services back to their town.</p>
<p>The Rural Transaction Centres will provide access to a range of services that have disappeared from many small, regional communities.</p>
<p>Those services include banking, Medicare Easyclaim and Centrelink as well as training and business support. Importantly, each community selects the services it needs.</p>
<p>It is part of the governmentâs strategy to rebuild regional Australia and to give regional communities the tools they need to build their futures.</p>
<p>The Coalition Government is playing an active role in taking services back to regional Australia in a number of areas. As well as transaction services we are working to improve medical and legal services in the bush.</p>
<p>The Federal Government will support up to 500 Rural Transaction Centres around Australia as part of a $70m programme. The development of Rural Transaction Centres was a key election commitment in 1998 and I am proud to officially open the first of many.</p>
