The Prime Minister, Julia Gillard, today announced the Australian Government will increase its assistance to help prevent and control chronic diseases like diabetes and cardiovascular disease across the Pacific.</p>
<p>Ms Gillard is attending the 42nd Pacific Islands Forum in Auckland, New Zealand</p>
<p>Australia will provide $25 million over the next four years to help Pacific nations tackle these serious health problems.</p>
<p>Ms Gillard said that Australia has a great health system and as the largest nation at the Pacific Islands Forum we will play our part in assisting our smaller neighbours keep their populations healthy and productive.   </p>
<p>Non-communicable diseases are a leading cause of death and disability in Pacific countries. They put a burden on local health systems and they reduce productivity and household income.</p>
<p>Australia will work with Pacific Island nations to tackle health issues and the funding will help prevent non-communicable diseases through healthy lifestyle campaigns including school nutrition, assist countries to introduce tobacco and alcohol legislation and fund diabetes clinics.</p>
<p>This builds on previous programs that have funded 21 Pacific Island countries and territories to implement their national non-communicable diseases strategies and provided 73 grants to non-government organisations in the Pacific for community activities focusing on disease prevention.</p>
<p>As part of the program Australia will also provide an additional $1 million to expand its existing Australian Sports Outreach Program (ASOP) to help tackle disease in the Pacific.</p>
<p>The ASOP is already working with to increase physical activity as well as improve diets and control tobacco and alcohol use.</p>
<p>A sport program on Aniwa Island in Vanuatu that recently introduced football and volleyball to communities has already achieved great results with a 50 per cent reduction in obesity among participants between 2009 and 2010.</p>
<p>Kiribati will also receive $500,000 to encourage residents to participate in exercise and fitness more.  This program will train sport volunteers to run regular volleyball, football and basketball activities in and around the capital, Tarawa.</p>
<p>With a strong focus on increasing physical activity these additional funds will expand existing sports programs using sport to deliver vital health messages. They will bring sports, health ministries and development partners together to accelerate the delivery of non-communicable disease action plans. 1</p>
