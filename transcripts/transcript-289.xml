Your Royal lighrnses, and Chance"' o<br />
Have 1I W daam. your permission to address this conglegation<br />
without nW hat on? 1 know that Is very well established<br />
that one addresses you capped. but a long life of politleal<br />
spe@ h-fmkiflg has ijersuaded me never tc spea" with my hat ce<br />
I don't know why# because somvetU-nes It might have been a<br />
protection, when I was listening to that ! wre-thask~ nd and loso-than<br />
trw. speech mde about me earlier tod. ay, nVy mind ran baox over<br />
some of the occasions on which I've beeni given a degree not a<br />
degwe0 that T ' d oarned in the nor. ia1 arduous fashion, but degrees<br />
that have since been given to me sometimes I ' ve thought in a<br />
rather light-hearted way. I didn' t know what I had dons fie<br />
rdaensgerev er lgthtetm , a robtuint a ththeye awreo rldv. o ry Yaogu, r ee( atob lel ooakl l att hme e) s aynoau; wtohuelyd a'I<br />
believe that I am a g'raduate of' ct~ ll or that I am a graduate<br />
of Laval In Q~ uebeo where Indeed I made Vy speech, partly in<br />
what I believed to be P'rench; but was regarded,, f subsequently<br />
dieoovered, by the raench Canadians, to be a brilliant rendering<br />
of one of the lesser-know dialects of the Arunta tribe in<br />
Australia. I was on'-e ,' Iven a degree in Malta and I've always<br />
remembered that one, beenuse Jlust at the last moment I was<br />
presented with a long oath In Latin that had to be taken It<br />
was a very long ano, it woulk~ i haive weighed heavily on rrW' coaciene<br />
in any language, I t ran to about 20C~ % ords and I had no time to<br />
discover what went on in Maltap whether you spoke In the old<br />
pronunciation or the new, or In wha3t T call " law-court* Latin<br />
which Is quite diffarint from any other. And I had to sk-the<br />
VieemChancellor about It at the last moment the Vie-<br />
Chancellor or any university being. the fount of all wisdom* lie<br />
saidt ' 1 wouldn't worry about it, if I were you none of thai<br />
will un. Ierotand It ainyhow. Mumble it'.<br />
well, I'aam# here today of course I experenced, amcing<br />
other things, a double pleasure. ' rho first to that you, yourself,<br />
your Royal Iiighnonaa z'iecile over this University. Thisn Is a<br />
wonderful thing, T think, for this i~ nimersity, And the seeand<br />
i9 that your Vloe-Chanoellor has coat aore money ( or nW<br />
Government , av money) than any other person now In this roam,<br />
or for all I know now in the whole city of Leeds. Beeauase<br />
not long after I came back into office after a well-deserved<br />
JourntW in the wilaerness ( these things happen, you know) the<br />
spirit moved me to have a look at the universities position In<br />
Australia; and very unsatisfactory It was We haves unhappily,<br />
not had as some American universities have had enmous<br />
private benefactione. There have been some but not so ninn, and<br />
the result In that the difference between the foom that are p&amp; 14<br />
and what it woets to conduct the university beame gweateffiabd<br />
ber ws sr heavily on the revenues of the State. Well, I've been<br />
a Treasurer a~ self p and I know how difficult it Is to defeat<br />
the Treasury In a straight-out contest. You mst let mes give<br />

Wo~ nvtmat It to be gonorall known. And so haTIng looke<br />
at the problem,# and having made up sW aind that, thov%* the<br />
a % biltt self the Counvet of Australia# had s<br />
dirot resposbility rot universities ezest tWe alvere<br />
which was establishted in Canberra the time had om when we<br />
must do sonaetbia, about it, Be I went o" t to Hnnland an<br />
other inatters and# while he" e# t had a talk with airi Keith Uazay,<br />
I Persuaded the then Chancellor of the . xehoquerv Mr. Hlarold<br />
Uacmillan, to lot me borrow him for' a while. wAn I " neas the<br />
Obaaoellor seemed very agreeable on that oceaslon . sst Anlim<br />
to say: ' Certainly, qW dear follows whatever yma ask'" until~<br />
of ecare, I realised that the more months tfAt Murray me out<br />
of Eagland. the loss oppor'tunit~ y would there be of getting<br />
reoumnudatioue in from1 University Grants Coiguisin, of which<br />
he was the Chairean. And so I got Sir Keith Murray* I~ o<br />
Sir Charles mIorrIs and than I got some distinguished mn ii<br />
Australia aid established a Committee of enquiry, and it me<br />
only just its it wias about to " o announced that I broke the neos<br />
to the Treasury. A-* sn I &amp; ida t Ynxow what a shattering blow<br />
these people would inf lict on ffs. Itere we were@ we had in miami<br />
ways been Making grants to the Otates on university acounmt,<br />
relatively smll grants totallInly perhaps up to a million or<br />
a million and a half a year. AnW this Cordttes of disomn<br />
people all Vice-Chancellors are dlisarmaing ( they have to be<br />
they disarmt their opponlents carletely iiado a imgIfleault<br />
report. I t raised tho priae that I would have to pay on behialf<br />
of the Conunoalthg tran ( let us say) 3j -nillion, in 3 years,<br />
to 21 million in 3 years. I took it to the Cabinet; we sat<br />
all foorning, we, sat all the afternoon, we sat until midnight,<br />
and by sheer exhaustion I got V. own way. And the 21 million<br />
went down on the record.<br />
Ra~ w this, you rmiih% think, was a great enough shook few<br />
anyone to ousta&amp; in. But not at allI one of their reommuendations<br />
was that we should a~ ppoint a Jaiversities CcnIsuseien of<br />
our own, So we didj anid I picked outp oi' * ourse, the most<br />
frugaly-minded non of standing that I could find in Australia*<br />
AMd they have Just brought In their report for the second<br />
TrIannium -the first# rernenber, was 21 million -this one Is<br />
11I. There's a little moral In all this theres a moral, Ad<br />
It's a good ome. Before the war the numbor of people mating<br />
a Uiveseity traiin,-was not urilimited. Universities wmo<br />
relatively smll. But sine this last war# what has been<br />
happening here, has beew hao'pening in Australia as wall*<br />
Thousands of people come. alons. 9 wanting to have University<br />
training whether this Is due to Irrproved financial cicumstaowem<br />
or whether it is due to a now conception of the need fow<br />
higher training, both,, I needn't determine. All I know Is<br />
that whzen Sir Charles was sitting on this Coim~ tte and wrift<br />
a report@ only a few years ago very few estimaztes were mde<br />
for them for future po,, ulm. tions, under-graduate populations In </p>
<p>various univereltles. They've all. been falsified since*<br />
It's quite clear that wherever someobody thought ' Well there'll<br />
be 5CpGOC an: ergraiuates a oertain titse' there'll be<br />
And if somebody t1hou'-ht thait there'l1l be 7U 000, at some time<br />
there'll be 90, ' he demand iio risi,! so repidly. My own<br />
