E. O. E. PROOF ONLY<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW ON SUNDAY PROGRAM 2 JUNE 1985<br />
JOURNALIST: Thanks very much for joining us this morning,<br />
Prime Minister. Before we turn to tax, there has been a<br />
lot of comment about the effect that the job of Prime Ninister<br />
has had on you that you are looking older and tireder and<br />
it wouldn't be the first time that it has happened to a world<br />
leader. Have you found that the job of Prime Minister was<br />
tougher than you thought it was going to be?<br />
PM: No, not really, Robert. It has been very long hours,<br />
but that has been as I expected. I think this year has been<br />
a little bit tougher than one would normally have thoughth of<br />
because in addition to the normal tasks of the Prime Mi. nister's<br />
job we have had the Expenditure Rev4. w Committee w. hich led up<br />
to the Ila,-Statement with that savi1it o-$ 1 billion and that<br />
$ 1 billion wasn't lying around easily to be found. There was<br />
a lot of work in that. And in addition to that we have had<br />
the preparation of the tax white paoer, so I don't think there<br />
will cver be a more horrendous six months than this last one.<br />
JOURNALIST: Just on that tax paper. There were a couple of<br />
Cabinet meetings that swallowed up Sunday night and went onto<br />
early Monday morning. You can't go on like that can you?<br />
PM: Well, and nor do we intend to. But, as 7 say, those two<br />
things were there to be done. Wc had to get the May Statement<br />
out because we were committed to the economic strategy of which<br />
you are aware to bring down the deficit, to create the<br />
conditions for growth for Australians ore jobs, sustainable<br />
levels of inflation. And you just don't get those things by<br />
sitting in your lounge chair at-the Loage and saying, I want them.<br />
Yon have got to do them. And if you are going to do them it<br />
is hard work. And then in addition to that, as I say, there<br />
was the preparation of the tax paper. Now, I don't believe<br />
there will be another six months in which you will have that<br />
conjunction of heavy circumstances.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, over the last few weeks we have<br />
had headlines like is he still up to the job a tired,<br />
depressed PM loses his magic touch Prime Minister's backdowns<br />
is it becoming too much for Hawke and a real beauty PM not<br />
back on grog. I am just wondering why you think that<br />
perception has suddenly developed and what you are going to do<br />
about it. </p>
<p>Pi-: Wall. I think it has got something to do with the answer<br />
I just gave to Robert that times have been hard. You just<br />
couldn't work any longer hours and not just disintegrate.<br />
Arnd one has been doing it. And when you get very very very<br />
tired -I guess it is true of all of us that y~ ou operate<br />
at less than your optimum. Now you just have to make a<br />
judgement as to whether the job3 that you have got there and<br />
that have to be done within a particular timeframe whether<br />
you have got to do them. Now I made the judgement that<br />
they had to be done. If you look at the tax exercise, Paul<br />
Keating and myself, despite some nuances that appear to be<br />
in the press, have worked hand in glove on that. And it has<br />
been Paul and myself. In regard to the Expenditure Review<br />
Committee, I just could not avoid being in that because it is<br />
not just economic decisions, but it is political decisions as<br />
well. Now, if yo-u are working those inordinately long holirs<br />
because you know that something has got to be done, you<br />
realise that you are going to be at som'ething less than your<br />
best. Now it is a question of judgement. They had to be done.<br />
They are behind me. And I want to assure you, Laurie, and all<br />
your viewers that I feel great now and, as for that last<br />
observation about the grog. It is now exactly five years<br />
since I gave it up. I have not had a single drop in that five<br />
year period. But you know, Laurie. You have had something of<br />
the same experience. People are always sitting there wanting<br />
to be half smart. They are the ones that finish up %. ith egg<br />
on their face, not us, Laurie. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Isn't it the case though1 Mr Hawke) that those<br />
headlines are occurring because people are wondering whether or<br />
not, as Laurie said, you're up to the job. T-nd the man who had a<br />
approval rating now has about a 50% approval rating~ Ilie man<br />
that the Labor Party put in as their leader because they knew he<br />
could win is now, according to the polls, quite beatable.<br />
PM: Well I've not ever said George that those figures of over<br />
were permanently sustainable. One enjoys them while they're there.<br />
But I've made it quite clear to the people of Australia,<br />
particularly during the last election campaign and since, that Australia<br />
has entered into a period where a whole series of tough<br />
decisions have to be taken. I think the record is quite clear now<br />
that I and my Government are prepared to do the hard work which<br />
involves taking the hard decisions and a lot of those don~' t make<br />
you popular. And T would prefer to be 5Cefl as a. Prime Minister<br />
leading a Government which is going to take the tough correct<br />
decisions. And if that means in the process that you lose some<br />
popularity points, so be it. The judgement will be made at the<br />
end of the road where those decisions have helped to get Australia<br />
into the position where we are going to continue as we are now<br />
-performing better and far better than the average of the rest of<br />
the world.<br />
JOURNA. LIST: But wouldn't it appear that Bob Hawke who looked like<br />
an invincible charismatic leader is now back with the pack. He's<br />
an ordinary politician who could get done?<br />
PM: Well that's for people to make their judgement. 1-hat I'm<br />
saying to you George is that I believe that by the time that we<br />
get to the next election the Australian people will be making<br />
their judgement on the issues that matter~ to them. Is this<br />
economy performing better than the rest of the world? Are we<br />
providing more jobs, at sustainable levels of inflation? Have we<br />
rz: forniod the whole economic system. And at the same time, which<br />
tends to be forgotteninsthere's this concentration on economic<br />
management, are we gradually moving to do things in the area of<br />
equity social welfare, education, which provide a better more<br />
just society? We've been doing that. They tend to get forgotten.<br />
In the area of social welfare we've done more for pensioners in<br />
real terms than the previous Government ever looked like doing.<br />
In the area of real need in social welfare you're single parents,<br />
with kids, massive increases for them. Field of education there has bei<br />
some talk about tertiary education-forgotLen. that for seven<br />
years -the previous Government neglected tertiary education. Frr<br />
the first time in seven years we've provided additional real<br />
funds, real places iriall these areas-welfare housing. Now<br />
we'll continue to do th~ ose things, look after the people most in<br />
need, create a growing economy.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime minister, perceptions, images are also<br />
importan~ t in politics. </p>
<p>PM: Of course they are.<br />
JOURNALIST: And there's a perception abroad at the moment that<br />
you're vacillating, that you're not a strong leader. Do you agree<br />
that Paul Keating being quoted about how difficult it is to keep<br />
you in the tax cart, that sort of thing has effected your image<br />
adversely. PM: Well it may have, I don't know, but as far as<br />
JOURNALIST: How do you feel about that?<br />
PM: I feel quite relaxed about it because Paul Keating and Bob<br />
H-awke know what the truth is. And the truth has been from the<br />
beginning of this Government that we've worked closer together,<br />
probably than any other prime minister and treasurer in the<br />
history of this country. We have a close professional<br />
relationship. We have an extraordinarly close personal<br />
relationship. Our families have a close personal relationship.<br />
A-md between two people of intelligence and integrity there are<br />
going to be points at which you'll have some difference of<br />
emphasis. One is not the clone of the other. But the<br />
relationship between Paul and myself I believe has never been<br />
better than it is now.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister there is a difference in the<br />
perception of yourself and Paul Keating, and I think it comes from<br />
this, that Mr Keating has taken a stronger and tougher stand on<br />
tax reform -has been more consistent on tax reform than you.<br />
PM: Well I think the truth about the tax reform situation is this and<br />
neither Paul nor myself have tried to put it differently. Paul,<br />
as Treasurer, has had the ministerial responsibility for<br />
developing a tax reform package, and that'i's his direct<br />
responsibility. My responsibility as Prime Minister is to<br />
oversight that work, as of other ministers if you like, and also<br />
to take account of the total environment within which initiatives,<br />
including tne tax reform package, have been undertaken. I have<br />
never wavered, as Paul understands, from the beginning in believing<br />
that if you are going to have, Robert, a comprehensive<br />
reform, which gives to the mass of Australian people, a fairer,<br />
simpler, more economically efficient system, then ideally you<br />
need to go to the preferred package that we will be putting in our<br />
white paper. Now I've had to look at that in the context of what<br />
is achievable. And I've done that and I've come to the point of<br />
not changing from what we said in the beginning. And you will<br />
find in the white paper that the position that Paul Keating and<br />
iryself have guided, if you like, through Cabinet, is there on the<br />
understanding that the people of Australia, through the summit,<br />
and elsewhere have to look at that package in exactly the terms<br />
hat I've put in this debate from the last election. There has<br />
been no wavering by Paul Keating, myself or the Government from<br />
the approach of the election. Nine principles, including, </p>
<p>specifcally, the f'nal ninth principle, that whatever is done to<br />
get ta: reform in this cointry, Robert, must be generally<br />
acceptable to the Australian community.<br />
JOURNALIST: So -are y saying that you've been in and out of<br />
the tax cart<br />
PM: No I'm not, I'm saying the opposite. I am saying that from<br />
the beginning I believed that the ideal approach is the preferred<br />
approach that will appear in the white paper and we are a-1i saying<br />
Paul, myself, the Government are saying, there it is are<br />
saying to the Summit and the people of Australia, that you've got<br />
to look at that. You've got to see whether on your judgement,<br />
with a package which will always include some losers, as well as<br />
an overwhelming majority of qinners-look at the package as a whole.<br />
Do you make the judgement at the end, that that package is most<br />
likely to produce a fairer, simpler and more economically<br />
efficient system. And I do not waver from my belief that that is<br />
achievable. JOURNALIST: Do you believe that you are more aware of the<br />
electoral consequences of the tax package than Paul Keating is?<br />
PM: Well what I would say is this. As Prime Minister it is my<br />
responsibility to look at the overall implications. It isPaul's<br />
responsibility, which he has discharge,' magnificently, to go<br />
ahead withthehighly complex technical Losk of oversightirig an<br />
examination, which is the most comprehensive that's been<br />
undertaken in the history of this country. He's oversighted that<br />
task with dedication, and I believe enormous competence. Now<br />
while he's engaged in that I have to support and sustain him, as I<br />
believe I have in that andalso try and understand what sort of<br />
problems there are in the application of the preferred option.<br />
Let me just make one point. Its been quite glear from the very<br />
beginning that if you move to a new system which has a broad based<br />
consumption tax element into it then prima facie that can be<br />
regressive. it can hurt people on lower incomes, and social<br />
welfare beneficiaries. So we've had to look at the compensatory<br />
mechanisms that you can put in and try and guarantee your<br />
satisfaction that those people are going to be looked after. Now<br />
I've had to make sure in my mind as the process goes on that that<br />
can be achieved. I believe it can. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Mr Kawke, just to pull it together this<br />
deceived difference irn approach to tax reform between yourself<br />
and Ar KeE: t-ing. Is it in fact because of your consensus<br />
ap-proach to try arid be all things to all people whereas<br />
Paul Keating doesn't like steppinc on toes and upsetting some<br />
members of the commnunity at least. And that is why he is<br />
conceived as being tougher on this whole issue.<br />
PM: No; that is very simplistic, George, and inaccurate,<br />
and unfair to Paul Keating, I m2_ ght say. Because Paul wo. iuld not<br />
be pressing the third option if there had not been an enormous<br />
amount of work done by him and his officers to satisfy themselves<br />
that the least privileged in the community would not be hurt.<br />
He has had this matter very much in his mind. He is not a<br />
steamroller man who san,,, this is something which is going to<br />
be economically efficilent, therefore do it come what may. I am<br />
simply trying to make the point that Paul and the Treasury<br />
people have had the major carriage have necessarily had to<br />
concentrate on the technicalities. I have had to have a<br />
broader vision. And the thing that satisfies me so much at the<br />
end cf the exercise is that we share the belief that what we<br />
believe is the most economically efficient and equitable and<br />
simpler system, is one which we believe the majority of the<br />
community will come to see, not only satisfies those tests, but<br />
has built into it the mechanisms which will look after those<br />
in the community who need to be protected.<br />
JOURNALISTr: So Paul Jaating is not pulling the tax cart and<br />
dragging you the rest of the Government along with him?<br />
PM: Well I have made that quite cltar in the previous answer.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, word has leaked out that you are<br />
going to tax perks like company cars and cheap loans and travels<br />
and all those things. Now how are you proposing to do that?<br />
PM: Well I think it is preferable that the details that we<br />
wait on the exposition until Paul releases the paper on<br />
Tuesday. But let me say this ldicadly, Robert, which will be<br />
useful. I think that you will see that there is a message<br />
whereby these sorts of things may be ta: ed in the employer's<br />
hand rather than the employee's, %.' icivñ will meet, I think,<br />
a lot of the problems that people have in their mind about. this.<br />
JOURNALIST: Even when the employer is a trade union or the<br />
ACTU giving a car to a union official?<br />
PM: You will see, I believe, that there are no exemptions in<br />
tEhe sort of way you ar'e talking about.<br />
JOURNALIST: But Prime Minister, if you tax the employer<br />
charge him 45 cents in the dollar for perks I mean, surely<br />
the employers w-, ill stop giving perks. The workers will be<br />
affected anyway. </p>
<p>PM: No, I think that there will be a variety of reactions,<br />
Laurie. There will be in some areas there may be that<br />
reaction. In others, there will be some absorption by the<br />
employers. I think you can't give a blanket ansl ; er, but what<br />
you have' got to understand is this when you talk about this<br />
area. It is an exploding area and you will find when you see<br />
the white paper projections that it is exploding at such a<br />
rate that if something is not done about it, then the ordinary<br />
taxpayer will again have a greater burden imposed upon him and<br />
her. I wonder whether I could just, setting the background to<br />
this very briefly, give you a view a~ s an indication of just how<br />
the last 30 years the burden of the tax syste-m has changed. If<br />
you compare back to ' 54, ' 55 with ' 84, ' 85. You have got the<br />
situation where the person on average earnings 30 years ago,<br />
average rate 19 cents. It is now 46 cents. And the average<br />
has gone fromu 10 to 25. Now that is an enormous increase in the<br />
burden. You have got the situation where just over 2 million<br />
2.1 million taxpayeis which is 39% of people in full time<br />
employment are at the 46 cent rate. Now, 30 years ago 1%<br />
were at that 46 cent iate. Now that is the sort of order of<br />
change. You have got the position where the top tax rate<br />
cents is now biting in at 1.6 times average earnings. Now,<br />
years ago that was 18 times averae carnings. Translated in<br />
price terms, $ 35,000 rnow is where the top tax rate bites in.<br />
In 1954 terms that would need to be $ 400,000 now to have the<br />
same thing. So those are the sorts of things that have happened.<br />
JOURNALIST: By definition, Pri~ iie Minister, to prevent that,<br />
you have got to raise a lot of money.<br />
PM: Yes.<br />
JOURNALIST: Now, is the only way to raise that money through<br />
a broad based consumption tax?<br />
PM: Well, let me put it this way, Robert. You can do<br />
something about broadening the direct tax base. But you have to<br />
say two things about that. Firstl. y, there is a limit under the<br />
operation of the law and the mechanics of the tax office as to<br />
what you could get. To be sure-that you c~ ould really get into<br />
all the areas of avoidance and evasion you would have to have<br />
such a massive army of people in the tax office that it would be<br />
the sort of system that wouldn't be tenable. So there are limits<br />
tc what you can get from the direct tax broadening base. And<br />
therefore, if ther-are those limits which mean you can only get<br />
$ 1 billion, $ 1 billion, there, you are talking about tax relief<br />
in personal taxes which are significantly less than what you<br />
were able to give in the last Budget. If you are going to get<br />
substantial amounts you have to look elsewhere.<br />
JOURNALIST: And the place where you can get that money really<br />
the only place where you can get that money is through sonte<br />
large indirect tax. You are not going to get it out of capital<br />
gains. You are not going to </p>
<p>PM: No, capital gains may I just quickly refer to capital<br />
gains, Robert. There has been a lot of loose reporting of<br />
capital gains. It has been put as a massive heavy impost<br />
because you are talking about the tax operating at the<br />
marginal rate. But what is not understood and hasn't been<br />
put clearly is that it is not tax on nominal gains. it<br />
is a tax on real as offset the losses and prospective gains<br />
and at the time of realisation.<br />
JOURNALIST: But it also covers things you inherit, doesn't it,<br />
and gifts?<br />
PM: Well let me I don't want to go into all the details.<br />
The thing that it doesn't cover and w.. hich has got to be made<br />
clear, is the personal home. That is excluded. And it is a<br />
relatively minor impost going back -I mean, I want to pursue<br />
your point, Robert, and this is the important point, as to<br />
amounts. You will see in the white paper that the amount which<br />
is derivable from a capital yjams tax is very very small. it<br />
has its importance, and I hope that the community, including<br />
my friends in the rural. community and I am entitled to say<br />
my friends, because I recognise that the rural commnunity<br />
is terribly importctnt. It provideF: 40061 of our export income.<br />
And we arc not about hurting them. Wve are not. What they have<br />
got to understand is that without a capital gains tax this<br />
community is not going to have all the instruments available<br />
to it to stop the tax avoidance andI evasion which is imposing<br />
increasing burdens on the mass of the people. So comirng<br />
back to your point, unless there is a source of income in the<br />
consumption area, then the mass of Australians the ordinary<br />
taxpayers are not going to be able to. get the substarntial<br />
cuts in personal direct taxes to which they are entitled.<br />
Because you can't have a situation, I believe, where your<br />
ordinary taxpayers are just getting into the situation of paying<br />
half their incomes in taxes. There will be another quarter of<br />
a million people...... </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke ort the question of capital gains, still, its<br />
always been envisaged as a tax that would only affect a wealthy<br />
minority, bu*. there ara suggestions being made that your approach<br />
coulJ mean that all sorts of people across the board could be hit,<br />
that it isn't going to be restricted to just the wealthy few.<br />
PM: Well I think that the debate which will emerge after Tuesday,<br />
will satisfy people, George, that it is a proprosal, and that's<br />
all we are at this stage with the draft white paper, a proposal.<br />
It is a proposal which will be seen to be fair. Let me make it<br />
clear, the last thing in the world that this Government, which<br />
more than any other Government, has shown its commitment to<br />
st: imulating economi~ c growth and expansion of job opportunities.<br />
The last thing in the world that this Government is going to do is<br />
to contemplate the bringing in of a tax reform with an element<br />
which is going to have adverse impact upon econiomic growth. We<br />
simply wouldn't do it. Our whole record shows that. And we're<br />
not about trying to impose burdens upon people which shouldn't be<br />
imposed. But if the community wants a tax system which is gcing<br />
to be fair, and mean that you have, as a community, every<br />
instrument available to you to stop hillicnis of dollars being<br />
avoided and evaded in tax, then its sensible to have it. And<br />
particularly, if I may make this point finally in regard to<br />
capital gains tax. You do have to ask yourself a question, as<br />
Australians. Wqhy is it that virtually every other country in the<br />
western world has such a form of tax, iLn part to stop avoidance<br />
and evasion. W~ hy shouldn't Australia have it.<br />
JOURNALIST: Priimc M. 1inister can we look at the politics of the<br />
consumption tax.<br />
PM: Sure.<br />
JOURNALIST: It seems to me from talk back radio and from opinion<br />
polls that its quite clear the public doe'sn't want this. They<br />
dread it. The Unions obviously don't want it. How can you sell<br />
it. Aren't you taking a heck of a risk, and is it worth it?<br />
PM: Yes we are taking a risk. But I just want to make this<br />
point, if I could, by preface to going to answer the question<br />
particularly. What this country has needed despecately for years<br />
now is a government ahich is prepared to Aface up to what has to be<br />
done to get this economy in proper shape. We have across us in<br />
the Parliament a group of people ; Tho in government did the<br />
analysis of what needed to be done. Floating the dollar they<br />
did the work and then they wouldn't jump the hurdles. Sorry too<br />
hard, might be problems. Deregulating the financial market did<br />
the work, Yes that must be happening. Came to the hurdles<br />
said no, difficulties, p. roblerns, wouldn't do it, and so on.<br />
JOURNALIST: But if you do this and then lose the election,<br />
they're the ones who benefit.<br />
PM: Well let me say this. I'm not in politics and never have </p>
<p>been in public life just to be their ric'e a popularity wave and<br />
do what you think is going to popul. ar. What needs to be done<br />
is to have a Government in this country w~ hicb is prep'arel to face<br />
up to the great challenges facing this country. We're coming to<br />
the end of this twentieth century. We cannot any longer afford to<br />
go on, take soft options and say she'll be Light mate. The world<br />
is not going to say to Australia, she'll be right. Now if you<br />
don't have your tax system which is an intrinsically important<br />
part of seeing that your economy runs efficiently. If you just<br />
say, sorry too hard we won't do it, then perhaps it might be<br />
easier politically for us. But let me remind you of this. When<br />
in the last election I said we were going to approach the question<br />
of tax reform I put up the nine principles. I guess you don't<br />
want me to run through them. I can if you want me to. But the<br />
final principle was this. That if tax reform is going to work<br />
then it must have broad community support, so the job we've got at<br />
the Tax Summit, and leading up to the Tax Summit is to try to get<br />
prejudices and narrow interests, as far as possible off thie table,<br />
and ask all Australians to look at the package as a whole. Now we<br />
want to do the job of selling that to the people. If<br />
overwhelmingly they say they don't want it, then under the ninle<br />
principles, so be it. it will be a tragedy for Australia if we<br />
baulk at tax reform because it might hurt me here, it might hurt<br />
you there. Now for God's sake let's, as Australians, say what<br />
does Australia as a whole, what do our children nieed in the next<br />
generation. Do they want a tax system which has just beern slin<br />
slop, mish mashed together over thirty~ years, with no point or<br />
purpose, and which is inefficient.<br />
JOURNALIST:. Well you used the word earlier, hurdles, ahout the<br />
Liberals going up to the hurdle on deregulation and not jurlping<br />
the hurdle. The hurdle on consumption tax it seems to me is the<br />
ACTU. If you can't get them to agree to it, then it won't happen.<br />
Now if it doesn't happen, that's the first part of the question,<br />
the second part of that, if it doesn't ha p~ en can you, and<br />
particularly Paul-Keating, draw back from consumption tax with any<br />
credibility left at all?<br />
PM: Well let me remind you of the seventh principle. I mean I'm<br />
going to have to read them all cut in a minute. But the seventh<br />
principle put to the people of Australia was that if there be a<br />
proposal to move to a broad based consuImption tax, then you are<br />
going to have to have the support of the Trade Union movement,<br />
because what woul~ d be totally cdis~ strous and not acceptablie. And<br />
that's why I put it to the people in the election campaign, is<br />
that to have a consumption tax which had the immediate effect of<br />
lifting prices, and thc~ n having the Trade Union movement saying<br />
having got an enormous cut in direct taxes wanting to double di;;<br />
anid saying we want our wages adjusted to that as well. Now so I<br />
said to the people, ui~ ess there is an acceptance of this and no<br />
discounting, then it can't be done. Now I believe that, part of<br />
the work that Paul Keating has done so well, is to talk with the<br />
Trade Union miovement, as v. ell as with business, and say here are<br />
the advantages. Now I know that the ACTU is going into the Tax </p>
<p>Summit with an open mind. They've kept their options open.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke you've got a unique relationship with the<br />
Trade Union movement. Most of those guys are mates of yours. Is<br />
Bob Hawke going to be the Bob Hawke of old and convince the ACTU<br />
to accept a thing like a consumption tax.<br />
PM: Bob Hawke is going to be standing shoulder to shoulder with<br />
Paul Keating seeking to persuade the ACTU, persuade business,<br />
persuade the rural community, that what each section, including<br />
the Trade Union mQvement has got to do, and we've reached the<br />
point as Australians where this is what has got to be done. We've<br />
got to stop thinking about a particular self interest, a<br />
particular concern. We've got to say what is it that's going to<br />
be best for Australia as a whole. Now I think I have the<br />
capacity. Certainly, whatever capacities I've got, I'll be trying<br />
to use those to make my fellow Australian men and women say that<br />
you can't have a continuation of a tax system which is<br />
haemorrhaginq, imposing burdens on those least able to bear them,<br />
economically inefficient. Now I'll try and persuade the Trade<br />
Unions. I'll try and persuade social welfa. re people. I'll try<br />
and persuade the business community. I hope we'll be successful,<br />
because if Australia rcfuses to face up to this issue we'll slop<br />
through, Oakes, Negus, Hawke and Haupt. We'll slop through. Our<br />
children will pay an enormous price if through our self indulgence<br />
and self interest we refuse to remedy this system.<br />
JO'JRNALTSC: Prime Minister, just one last que; tion. We're<br />
running out of time. We read in today's press that the Australian<br />
Rugby authorities intend to approach the Australian Crickot Board<br />
for a joint submission to try and change your Government's mind on<br />
sporting contacts with South Africa. Have they got any chance of<br />
succeeding? PM: No. But let me say this. If people want to make submissions<br />
to us they can. We'll receive Lhein. I don't want to be emotional<br />
about this issue, but just let me make this point Robert. We are<br />
members of the Commonwealth of Nations. And I think that's<br />
something that we should be proud of. That Commonwealth of<br />
Nations, the Gleneagles Agreement, has said that it is an<br />
obscenity to witness what is happening in South Africa, where the<br />
overwhelming majority of people, simply because they were born<br />
black, are to be treated as second rate, third rate, fourth rate<br />
citizens. And they have said, the Commonwealth conservative<br />
politicians, the most conservative, the most liberal, back and<br />
white have said together. There is one area in which we as a<br />
Commonwealth caii do something, not to give international prestige<br />
and standing to that eegime. And its through refusing to have<br />
competitive sporting contests. Now that seems to me to be a<br />
reasonable thing. I do want to make this point because it seems<br />
to me to be absolutely fundamental. I am not asking. This<br />
Government is not asking. Mr Fraser and his Government were not </p>
<p>12.<br />
asking people to embrace their particular politica'l phil T1hy or<br />
ideologies. We're just asking people to understand one t,<br />
that no human being in this world can control, deterin'ne ti,<br />
colour they are born. And if you want to think of the grco,<br />
obscenity in the world I think it is this, that a kid that i irn<br />
without control over their colour is going to be subjected to<br />
di. scrimination because of difference of colour, then we've got: tt<br />
say we will not do anything we possibly can to sustain and helfr<br />
regime which continues to condemn kids because they wore born<br />
black.<br />
JOURNALIST: Well you've been accused of hypocrisy in not having<br />
the same attitude, or of taking the same measures on trade, and I<br />
know your answer to that, which is the trade we can't effect. it<br />
has to be done with an international agreement. Now we're about<br />
to go on the Security Council of the United Nations. Are we going<br />
to try and lead the way to getting a world trade embargo on South<br />
Africa. PM: Certainly Robert. I believe that we should, and will take a<br />
lead there. I can come to this with I think impeccable<br />
credentials. For ten years I represented tu. e Australian workinq<br />
mnen and women at the International Labor Organisation. And when<br />
they had their emotional gatherings there saying we're going to<br />
have trade embargoes, I said that's beaut. I said what you've got<br />
to do is go back to your Government and make sure that your<br />
emotional voicp hare is backed by Government decision so that such<br />
sanctions can w-, ork. Now we will with others take a lead in that.<br />
JOURNALIST: We'll initiate something in the UN. Is that ahat<br />
you're saving.<br />
PM: Well I believe that with others we will. Certainly we will<br />
tFake a lead, but what I'm saying to the actual mechanics of it.<br />
There'll be others associated with us I w'ould think.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister we must leave it there, thanks for<br />
joining us. </p>
