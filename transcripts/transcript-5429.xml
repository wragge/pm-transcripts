PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA THURSDAY, 28 AUGUST, 1980<br />
BURDEKIN DAM PROJECT<br />
The Prime Minister today announced the Commonwealth Government's<br />
decision on funding the Burdekin Dam.<br />
Mr. Fraser recalled his announcement on 26 June 1980 which<br />
stated that the Commonwealth Government was prepared, in<br />
principle, to assist the Queensland Government in the<br />
Burdekin Project. At that time, the Prime Minister had<br />
foreshadowed discussions between Commonwealth and Queensland<br />
officials to report on options for financing the project.<br />
Today's announcement stems from the consideration of that<br />
report.-The Prime Minister went on to say that the Commonwealth<br />
Government has decided to offer to Queensland outside the<br />
-National Water Resources Program assistance by way of grants<br />
for the complete cost of the Daim ($ 84.5 million at June 1980<br />
prices). This offer is on the basis that Queensland will<br />
finance, from 1 July, 1980, the initial works associated with<br />
the project ($ 14.9 million) and will also bear the cost of the.<br />
irrigation area development works ($ 109.2 million) possibly<br />
through recourse to the special infrastructure borrowing<br />
arrangements of the Loan Council.<br />
The Prime Minister stated that this decision to finance the<br />
Dam will not be at the expense of projects currently assisted<br />
W in Queensland, or of projects with high priority for future<br />
assistance under the National Water Resources Program.<br />
Mr.-Fraser said that the dam, when completed, would have a<br />
storage capacity of 1.75 million megalitres. It will be utilised<br />
to supply water for existing population centres in the Burdekin<br />
basin and to meet the future urban water needs of Bowen and<br />
Townsville. The dam will give rise to substantial benefits -it has been<br />
estimated that the project will generate an increased average<br />
annual gross value of production of some $ 117 million, on the<br />
assumption of a sugar price of $ 220 per tonne. The benefits will,<br />
of course, be even higher when current sugar prices are taken<br />
into account. / 2 </p>

When the project is finished, it will provide an additional<br />
45,125 hectares annually with irrigation water and will lead<br />
to the creation of about 660 new farms.<br />
Mr. Fraser concluded by commenting that the Commonwealth's<br />
decision to DarticApate with Queensland in funding the<br />
Burdekin project will provide a great stimulus to Queensland.<br />
It will produce substantial economic benefits and is a clear vote<br />
of confidence by the Government in the development of the<br />
North. 000---</p>
