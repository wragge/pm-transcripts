PRESS STATEMENT NO. 470<br />
17 March' 1975<br />
AUSTRALIAN BEEF EXPORTS WITH JAPAN<br />
The Prime Minister, Mr. Whitlam, announced today<br />
that the Japanese Government had allocated an im~ port<br />
quota of 2,400 tonnes of beef for the Okinawa market.<br />
Mr. Whitlam said the-Japanese Government had<br />
made a simultaneous announcement of its decision in Tokyo<br />
this afternoon. Commenting on the reopen-ing of the Japanese beef<br />
market Mr. Whitlam, said:" The amount is not significant<br />
compared with our peak exports tc Japan of 115,000 tonnes<br />
in 1974. " What is welcome is the reaffirmation I have<br />
received from the Japanese Goverrmen-t that they will<br />
be approaching the question of further meat imports in a<br />
forward looking constructive matter."<br />
Mr. Whitlam said the Australian Government<br />
expected that Australia would get at least its traditional<br />
share of the new beef quota.<br />
The Prime Minister said that the Australian<br />
Government would continue to make strenuous efforts to<br />
persuade the Japanese Government to purchase more Australian<br />
meat. He recalled-that during the visit to Australia of<br />
the then Japanese Prime Minister, Mr. Tanaka, in November,<br />
he took every opportunity both public-ly and in private,<br />
to emphasise the plight of the Australian beef producers..<br />
His colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, made similar<br />
strong representations to senior Japanese ministers when he<br />
was in Tokyo in October last year.<br />
" jWe will continue to maintain our efforts and we<br />
now have greater reason to hope for more substantial<br />
development as the Japanese situation further improves,"<br />
the Prime-Minister concluded.<br />
