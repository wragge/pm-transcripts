PRESS CONFERENCE THE HION P J KEATING MP, PRIME MINISTER<br />
THURSDAY 16 JANUARY 1992, MELBCUPNE<br />
E OE PROOF ONLY<br />
PARTIAL TR~ ANSCRIPT ONLY LAST QUESTIONS MISSING<br />
J: Well how did the talks go?<br />
PM: Well I thOught it was a very productive day, which makes<br />
two very productive days. Very interesting talks this<br />
morning with the unions and the Committee for Melbourne at<br />
lunch time and there has been a lot of cross dlussion<br />
between the various industrial sectors and industrial<br />
groupings here on Melbourne and Victoria and the Committee<br />
for Melbourne has got now a reasonably clear agenda. Of<br />
course the Premier attended that meeting 8nd I think -it was<br />
a very good meeting where we had a chance to discuss the<br />
impact of the recession upon Victoria, structural things<br />
about Victoria, ways in which Victoria might play a part in<br />
the recovery.<br />
J: So you're thinking of making special offers to help<br />
Victoria in t'Ais structural process?<br />
PM:. I'd like t: o think that anything we might be able to do<br />
can be, whilst national in character, be also usefully<br />
4mployed in Victoria. But I've said and I will say again<br />
that Victoria, confidence levels are down in Victoria more<br />
than they are in other parts of Australia and to generate a<br />
recovery, I believe a substantial recovery has to be<br />
generated in -the state of Victoria, and that the national,<br />
if you like, aconmic conditions is in part itself<br />
conditioned by events and circumstances in Victoria.<br />
J: Do you shisre Mr Elliot's view that Victoria is the key<br />
to Australia's3 economic recovery?<br />
PM: Well I thl~ nk that is an important part, I wouldn't say<br />
key. But a ve~ ry significant part and probably weigh~ er than<br />
most of the other states.<br />
J: Did you hear anything from the Victorian unions that<br />
particularly interested you?<br />
PM: Well a 101: of the themes and threads thread through<br />
Committee for Melbourne's own agenda which has now all been<br />
reasonably widely discussed institutionally here, in the<br />
unions, by the unions with business via the various people<br />
within that Committee and the Government, of course.<br />
J: What about: this submission on changes to the tarriff<br />
policy? PM: Well there wasn't very much said about that. </p>
<p>J: They did actually present you with a written submission?<br />
PM: Yes I knowd. There was not strong advocoacL of that ina<br />
the meeting./<br />
J: The Opposition today in light of the record unemployment<br />
numbers is calling for an imumediate cut in immigration and<br />
for a of any national wage rise.<br />
PM: Well I haven't seen any of what the opposition said. I<br />
saw today's employment numbers, Itt still records a very high<br />
unem loymnent rate, marginally up only than last month but<br />
thata not the point. The fact is that itse still too high<br />
and thats the whole point of the statement, to try and get<br />
it down and to get a recovery going but I think thatA what<br />
we are basically focussing on, thats the very point of this<br />
exercise. J: Do you rule out any cut in immigration within the next<br />
month or so?<br />
PM: Yes because we'll review immigration, the normal cycle<br />
of the Cabinet review which will be about April of this<br />
year. J: ( inaudible3)<br />
PM: Well I presided over an economy which grew at twice the<br />
rate of growth in seven years as it did in the previous<br />
seven before I became Treasurer. So for seven and a half of<br />
my eight and a half years as Treasurer, the Australian<br />
economy grew at twice the speed as it did in the previous<br />
seven years. And the fact that there is a recession was not<br />
of the Goenet wishes and, of course, is part of the<br />
English speaking world-wide recession, which has come of the<br />
globalisatioi of financial markets, the collcqp. in asset<br />
values and the belief that inflation will no longer cut the<br />
mustard in in-vestment, that people have got to invest in<br />
things which are income producing. You just can't buy a<br />
building and ' hope to make a profit from it. And now that<br />
realisation has sunk in, asset prices have fallen. This is<br />
not a phenomena which is peculiar to Australia. Now it is<br />
two years ago this month that I first reduced interest<br />
rates. Official policy should not be promoting continuing a<br />
recession at this point. While it had a role, certainly in<br />
inducing the recession the fact that interest rates came off<br />
two years ago, came of f in earnest eighteen months ago,<br />
would by all -other measures and reckoning mean we would be<br />
into a reasonably firm recovery. We are not because of<br />
factors which are not peculiar to Government policy and this<br />
is true of the United States, true of Britian, true of<br />
Canada, true of New Zealand where recessions are in fact<br />
deeper and gloomier in some of those places than they are in<br />
Australia. So I'm going back to doing what I did mostly,<br />
that is, gene-rate faster rates of growth and employment.<br />
J: fastest possible sustainable rate of growth.. </p>
<p>PM: What the late ) 80s proved is that once the Australian<br />
economy went over four per cent growth a year~ it. spilled<br />
into imports, but the countries around us, th~ e so called<br />
newly industrialised countries, the tigers, could grow at<br />
six and eight per cent a year before they spill into<br />
In other words they add so much industrial capacity they<br />
could handle six to eight per cent growth before they<br />
started to rely on imports. We can only get just above four<br />
before we start to rely on imports. That's why the Liberals<br />
should hang their heads in shame after 30 years of running<br />
Australia. The best the place could do when it got a bit of<br />
speed up, was get to about four per cant growth then spill<br />
to imports. And this is what this government has been<br />
about, trying to rebuild our capital stock in our productive<br />
sectors which we've had substantial success in from the<br />
sloth of most of the post war years.<br />
J: Where is this point now?<br />
PM: Where is it? We hope its going to be in the longer run<br />
where this is sustainable you're asking?-well it's<br />
obviously sustainable under four and a half per cent, 4 per<br />
cent or something. But I'm not suggesting and your question<br />
does not require me, I don't think to indicate that that's<br />
the desira-l speed because we can't at the moment get<br />
back, get out of negative growth, so we want to get back to<br />
a sustainable growth troJectory, one which is sustainable<br />
for inflation and sustainable for Australia in the longer<br />
run, adding to the capital stock and producing more goods<br />
and services. I mean it needs to be remembered, because<br />
there is a perception that you know we tried some in the 0<br />
and we sort of lost it now. I notice some people are saying<br />
our manufacturing base has been deci'mated it is worth<br />
recording these facts; manufacturing production is twice<br />
today what it was in 1980 twice. Manufacuturing exports<br />
are 300 per cent greater than in 1983, we have exported our<br />
heads of f all through the 1980s and are doing more of it<br />
now. So the fact is that we have got to continue though to<br />
build that capacity and that's what it is all about now,<br />
going back to a-recovery, but a recovery which builds that<br />
productive capacity.<br />
J: Mr Keating, do you believe that with the economic policy<br />
you have been pursuing in your statement, that you'll be<br />
able to bring the unemployment down from it's present 10.6<br />
per cent level, this year?<br />
PM: Wel. l I'm not going to be making estimates about what the<br />
rate will be. But the aim will be to stabilise unemployment<br />
quickly and to turn it around,, which was our objective in<br />
1983, which of course we accomplished in 1983 and we would<br />
be hoping to' do something of the same during the course of<br />
1992. J: Prime Minister, talking about sustainable growth, that's<br />
in terms of the ecological sustainable also? </p>
<p>The environmental aspects of this growth is there now a<br />
readjustment towards 7<br />
PM: Well we are part of the international discussion about,<br />
which will take place next year in Brazil about greenhouse<br />
gas emissions, about the whole ecological sustainable<br />
development questions and that conference will be of some<br />
significance in determining how the rest of the world, the<br />
Northern Hemisphere economies approach these questions. But<br />
at the moment: we have got a lot of spare capacity laying<br />
about and theirefore, what we are about are employing current:<br />
capacity, current in-store capacity and that capacity has<br />
been installed at times when it has been operating at<br />
optimum level. s in the past', So it's not a matter of any new<br />
policy in thait sense, I mean we are aboutfor a start, just<br />
getting that existing capacity working.<br />
J<br />
PM: Wall it's too complex to give a simple answer to.<br />
J: Mr Keating, how do you react to the President of the<br />
ACTU's comments, Mr Martin Ferguson, that it's now time for<br />
the Governmen~ t to get it's house in order on Industry<br />
Policy, but basically the Government's industry policy over<br />
the last few years has been a disaster?<br />
PM: Well it's wrong. Because, manufacturing production is<br />
200 per cent greater than in 1980-83, 200 per cent<br />
improvement. Manufacutring exports are 300 per cent<br />
greater, they are Just simply facts. They just have to pick<br />
up any statisticians release and have a look through it.<br />
J: So you think you have a fundamental difference of<br />
opinion.. PM: No, let6 be clear about this. The ACTU have had a focus<br />
on industry policy for years. What I said was wrong, was<br />
that the policy has been a disaster that's obviously,<br />
plainly wrong. Now I don't know whether Martin said that or<br />
whether you concluded that.<br />
J: What he specifically said is it's time for the<br />
government to get its house in order.<br />
PM: Well that's part of the ACTU claim, and it has been for<br />
a number of years. And that's a continuation of that and<br />
that's fair enough, and we're doing all that we can to<br />
induce better industry policy in this country with the<br />
statement which we made in March of 1991 and to the extenW<br />
that what we might do in this statement, which will be<br />
focussed on a recovery, as I said yeste , also hopefully<br />
will have good structural elements to it which would also be<br />
improving of and improvement to the general industrial<br />
structure of Australia.<br />
J: Mr Ferguson is obviously concerned that the March<br />
industry statement and the later job statement didn't go far </p>
<p>enough so will you say that your coming statement will go<br />
further in terms of industry policy?<br />
PM: It will have a number of objectives the first will be to<br />
promote a recovery, but to promote it in a way which adds to<br />
the common wheel, makes the place structurally more strong<br />
and that will. be around, obviously the structure of<br />
industry. Now whether in the end what we do is a approved<br />
of by Mr Fercruson time will tell.<br />
Does it concern you that the ACTU might not approve of<br />
the industry policy?<br />
PM: They don't approve of everything we have done over the<br />
years, nor doi we approve of every view they have.<br />
J: They have given you a lot of support over the years?<br />
PM: And they have got a lot in return.<br />
J: Mr Keating superannuation funds. What is you view<br />
on the ( inaudible)?<br />
PM: It's not so much for wvzJ~ housing, I think it is for<br />
housing. There is a view that benefits preserved could be<br />
used by some people in a way which preserves, largely keeps<br />
the preservation about it, that is if it were used for<br />
housing being returned to the pool of preserved benefits at<br />
some stage. It's. something we are prepared to have a look<br />
at. One of the difficulties with superannuation is<br />
encouraging very young people in the workforce to be as<br />
enthusiastic about it as older members of the workforce and<br />
I think the view may be that if younger members of the<br />
workcforce could draw down preserved benefits or at least use<br />
them in some-way for housing it gives them more immediate<br />
rationale for superannuation rather than simply the benefit<br />
which comes at age 55. That's rational and that's why we<br />
will have a look it.<br />
J: Mr Keating is there anything that you have heard from<br />
the last two days that apart from change., foreshadowed<br />
changes in economic policy in terms of Victoria, giving<br />
Victoria some sort of assistance..<br />
PM: No they are not asking for assistance for straight<br />
federal funding. The Committee of Melbourne proposals, for<br />
instance, and the ones the Government of Victoria<br />
are associated with go to the infrastructure of Melbourne.<br />
It's not been a claim, by Victoria upon us for funds to<br />
administer itself..<br />
J: There has been talk within the Victorian government of<br />
accelerating f ederal f unding f or housing, f or example.<br />
PM: That hasn'It been mentioned.<br />
3: Mr JKeatinr the dollar dropped again a level today<br />
according to t~ he market it was a report going through </p>
<p>the markets t~ hat the Financial Review tomorrow is reporting<br />
a budget deficit blow out of 8-10 million dollars. I'm not<br />
expecting you to comment on what a newspaper may or may not<br />
be going to print but can you tell us what the lastest<br />
estimate on the budget deficit Is?<br />
PM! I don't know Don. I don't know off the top of my head.<br />
J: Could it possibly be anything within that figure range?<br />
PM: Look I simply don't know and I would doubt that very<br />
much and there's no point in me speculating on what<br />
newspapers might say about numbers I don't know about,<br />
J: ( inaudible)<br />
PM: I think that is very unlikely, but no one has talked to<br />
me about it.<br />
J: Mr Dawkiniqs aid just a couple of days ago that..<br />
PM: Yes, well that would be right. If he said that that<br />
would be right.<br />
J: ( inaudible)<br />
PM! No I thought that it may be prudent on our part to see<br />
how the application of legislation goes in respect of the<br />
Tasmanian election and the ACT election and the by-election<br />
in NSW and just see whether the Bill which was itself a<br />
compromise of discussions in the Senate as one that actually<br />
does fill the bill so to speak. With some practical having<br />
been applied.<br />
J7: Are there any circumstances in which you would scrap it?<br />
PM: No. Let me at least reserve a right to have a look at<br />
it. See how it has worked in these particular instances.<br />
J: ( inaudible)<br />
PM! There's no, point in me giving a cheek by jowl commentary<br />
on elements of the Bill. I will have a look at it in total.<br />
J: But your aim in that review would be to refine and<br />
streamline not: to get rid of it?<br />
PM It passed the House of Representatives the day I was<br />
elected Prime Minister. Within a couple of days we had to<br />
swear in new Ministers, a couple of days after that I had<br />
President Bush~ here, a couple of days after that I had a<br />
Cabinet meeting, a couple of days after that I had this. It<br />
has not been on the top of my agenda the Bill I am<br />
speaking about.<br />
J: On a totally different subject Mr Keating I believe<br />
tomorrow's your birthday, is that correct? </p>
<p>PM No its not. Saturday I think it is.<br />
J: Wall what are you doing on your birthday on Saturday?<br />
PM: Not very mouch I don't think. Have you got any ideas?<br />
3: Are you shouting yourself a present.<br />
PM: No, I think once yourtpast the Pour-O, on does have a<br />
diminished opinion of birthdays. And I'm heading for the<br />
Ff've<br />
J: On the mretings of the last couple of days, there seems<br />
to be a lot of people coming out with a lot of enthusiam,<br />
barely negat~ ive. How important do you think it is?<br />
PM: If people come and say that they were positive and<br />
enthusiastic-about the discussions I think thats how they<br />
found them, not for cosmetic effects at the fran door, or<br />
for effects beyond that but because that's how they found<br />
them. I mean, that for instance that the Federal Government,<br />
certainly al: the level of Prime Miniater and senior<br />
Ministers would have consulted the Victorian trade union<br />
movement, probably the first time in our period of office.<br />
The Committee for Melbourne which is represented by the<br />
Premier and the Government as well as senior people from the<br />
business community and the trade unions have also enjoyed a<br />
deep, relatively deep, discussion about various points of<br />
interest which they think are important to Melbourne. and<br />
Victoria. The business community, the BHPs, the banks etc.,<br />
today Pacific Dunlop, Ford, are talking about their industry<br />
perceptions about the economy in general, what they think<br />
might be worth doing, what they think is sensible and<br />
practical to do and they have a chance of having a serious<br />
discussion with the members of the Government who are likely<br />
to have the greatest impact on the statement. So, I think<br />
that's a good process for them, but it'Is very good process<br />
for us. So we said we'd come and listen and try and learn<br />
and pick things up and I think we have, we have picked<br />
things up and it is worth talking to people in this vein.<br />
3: tha public, that there's these sort of talks going<br />
on? PM: I should, think so. I think the public would probably<br />
believe thait a spirit of co-operation, the Government<br />
earnestly looking for ways to improve the way in which the<br />
economy can now function and then the longer term augers<br />
well for the economy. That is, that we are interested in<br />
promoting a recovery and getting one as quickly as possible<br />
and doing it: in ways which are deemed sensible and<br />
reasonable by these various representative segments of the<br />
community.... end of tranuicript </p>
