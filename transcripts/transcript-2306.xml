STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MlNSTER ON RECEIPTS DUTIES<br />
Discussions this afternoon centred upon the arrangements to<br />
be applied regarding receipts tax during the four years after 1970/ 7 1.<br />
It was agreed that the total amount which would have been<br />
collected by each State on transactions in 1970/ 71 would be accepted as the<br />
base figure for collections in future years for that State. This figure is to<br />
be the subject of discussion with each State.<br />
It was also accepted that the figure arrived at for each State,<br />
as a base, would be escalated in the remaining four years of the present<br />
finai. zial assistance arrangements in accordance with the formula applied<br />
to tax reimbursement grants at the June Premiers' Conference.<br />
The States agreed to meet together to seek some common field<br />
within the area covered by the receipts duty in which they could commonly<br />
impose a tax, such taxation revenue to be an offset against the Commonwealth<br />
liability for payment to the States.<br />
It was agreed that if a common field of such taxation could not<br />
be discovered the States would try to work out, each one, a field in which tax<br />
could be imposed. These arrangements we re made subject to the proviso on the<br />
part of the Commonwealth that they depended on the conditions governing the<br />
offers of the Commonwealth made at the June Premiers' Conference.<br />
Liability for receipts duty of all kinds, as at present levied,<br />
ceased on transactions after 30 September.<br />
