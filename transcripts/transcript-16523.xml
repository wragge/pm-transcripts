    <content><![CDATA[<p>COAG today agreed to establish a Compact with Young Australians.</p>
<p>This will ensure that as we recover from the global recession, young Australians have the skills required to realise their potential.</p>
<p>Under the terms of the Compact agreed today, every Australian under the age of 25 will have a guaranteed education or training place.</p>
<p>This education and training guarantee will ensure anyone under the age of 25, including those who lose their job, will be able to take part in further education or training.</p>
<p>The Compact is based upon three core principles:</p>
<p>     * Anyone under the age of 17 must be earning or learning, you must be in full time school, training or work;</p>
<p>     * If you are under the age of 20 and are not working, you will be provided with a training place with the first priority - a year 12 or equivalent VET qualification;</p>
<p>     * If you are under the age of 25 and you are not working you are guaranteed a training place to ensure you have the skills needed to be part of the recovery.</p>
<p>The Government anticipates that the Compact with Young Australians will provide up to 135,000 young people with higher qualifications.</p>
<p>We must not make the mistakes of the past and allow the young people who lose their job today become the long term unemployed of tomorrow.</p>
<p>In a global recession young people always feature heavily in the ranks of retrenched and laid off workers.</p>
<p>This Compact is to ensure that young Australians who lose their job in this recession are trained to be the tradespeople and professionals of the recovery.</p>
<p>We cannot allow the skills and training needed by a modern economy to skip a generation because of a global recession.</p>
<p>Strengthening conditions for welfare payments</p>
<p>To support this new Compact the Australian Government will strengthen the conditions unemployed young people must meet to receive Youth Allowance.</p>
<p>Anyone under the age of 20 without a year 12 or equivalent qualification must be in education or training in order to receive youth allowance.</p>
<p>This same condition must be met if the parents of young people in the same circumstances wish to receive Family Tax Benefit Part A.</p>
<p>If young people or their parents want to receive government benefits the quid pro quo is that the young person is working or earning a year 12 equivalent qualification.</p>
<p>Building on the Education Revolution</p>
<p>The Compact with Young Australians agreed today will form part of the Rudd Government's Jobs and Training Compact with all Australians.</p>
<p>Today's Compact has allowed COAG to accelerate by five years the COAG year 12 attainment goal.</p>
<p>COAG now aims to lift the national year 12 attainment level to 90 per cent by 2015.</p>
<p>The Commonwealth agreed to provide reward payments of up to $100 million for the achievement of improved performance against this goal.</p>
<p>The measures announced today build on the Government's Education Revolution which includes a $2 billion commitment to provide 711,000 additional vocational education and training places.</p>
<p>They build on historic and dramatic increases in investments in our schools  - public and private  -  to lift the quality of education for young Australians.</p>
<p>As a result of these investments, a total of $62.1 billion will flow to schools from 2009-2012. </p>
<p>This represents an 85 per cent increase, or getting close to double the $33.5 billion invested by the previous Government in the last four years on recurrent funding and infrastructure.</p>
<p>Today's Compact puts education and training front and centre to ensure Australia's future productivity.</p>
