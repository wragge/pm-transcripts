    <content><![CDATA[<p>Canberra</p>
<p>Prime Minister Julia Gillard today announced the start of the COAG Review of Counter-Terrorism Legislation.</p>
<p>The Review will examine the Commonwealth, State and Territory counter-terrorism legislation that was introduced in 2005 after the London terrorist bombings. </p>
<p>It will look at control orders, preventative detention and certain emergency stop, question and search powers held by police.</p>
<p>Terrorism is an ever-present threat and the review of our laws is important to ensure that our laws remain necessary and provide effective powers for our police and security agencies.</p>
<p>The Hon. Anthony Whealy QC, who recently retired from the NSW Court of Appeal, will chair the COAG Review. </p>
<p>The other members of the Review Committee are:</p>
<p>â¢           Judge David Jones AM, retired Victorian County Court judgeâ¢           Mr Richard Bingham, South Australian Ombudsmanâ¢           Commander Justine Saunders, Australian Federal Policeâ¢           Assistant Commissioner Mike Condon, Queensland Policeâ¢           Mr Graeme Davidson, Office of the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions</p>
<p>The Review Committee will provide a written report to COAG within six months.</p>
<p>The Independent National Security Legislation Monitor, which was established in 2010, also reviews Commonwealth counter-terrorism and national security laws.</p>
<p>While the Monitor's role is separate, the Review Committee will liaise with the Monitor, Mr Bret Walker SC, on this review.</p>
<p>The review has no relationship to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security's examination of potential national security reforms.</p>
<p>More information on the details of the Review, including the legislation the Review will cover and opportunities for public consultation can be found at <a href="http://www.coagctreview.gov.au">www.coagctreview.gov.au</a>.</p>
