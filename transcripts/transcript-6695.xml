PRIME MINISTER<br />
. EMBARGOED UNTIL 5.30 PM i<br />
PRIME MINISTER'S ADDRESS TO THE NATION 18 AUGUST 1985<br />
Tonight I want to speak to you about the Australia we live<br />
in today.<br />
And the kind of Australia I believe we should be living in,<br />
in the future.<br />
There's not a country on the face of this eatth that doesn't<br />
have problems of one kind or another.<br />
in Australia we have fewer than most, but problems<br />
nevertheless.<br />
We still have unemployment.<br />
It is improving. As you will have seen in the figures<br />
released last week unemployment has fallen to its lowest<br />
level in three years. Our employment programmes are workiing.<br />
It's very gratifying to me as I'm sure it is to you.<br />
But there is still a great deal for all of us to do.<br />
I guess it's a cliche, but the world we live in is one<br />
of rapid change.<br />
And the problems that this change presents are not something<br />
that can be fixed overnight.<br />
Not today, not tomorrow.<br />
But they will be fixed.<br />
And I'd like to address myself tonight to the people who are<br />
going to play a major role in coming to grips with the<br />
challenges of change.<br />
The young people of our country. Young Australia.<br />
It's this generation of young Australians that's now coming<br />
into the workforce their brains, their energy, their<br />
enthusiasm that will lift this country to the front line<br />
of the world's industrial powers. We must settle for nothing<br />
less.<br />
We can nurture the talent, the energy, the vigor, the<br />
creativity of young Australia.. </p>
<p>2.<br />
or we can let it wither on the vine.<br />
I don't believe there is one among us who would contemplate<br />
the latter.<br />
We must nurture, not squander, the talents of young Australians.<br />
What a tragic waste it would be if they became the second<br />
class inhabitants of a second rate nation.<br />
We must all ask ourselves What we can do. My Government has<br />
spent a lot of time and a lot of effort addressing that<br />
question what can we do as a Federal Government.<br />
We have spoken to youth groups to young people throughout<br />
the country.<br />
I have been touched by the genuine will of young Australians<br />
to give it a go to do their very best.<br />
All they want is a chance.<br />
1 understand their sense of frustration their anger when<br />
they're not given that chance.<br />
Tonight I will briefly outline my Government's resolution to I<br />
help provide those opportunities.<br />
I would like to speak about the Government's role in a w'ide<br />
ranging programme designed to assist and develop young Australia.<br />
The core of this programme is education and training. Preparation<br />
for employment.<br />
Your first job, if it is a worthwhile job, means independence, I<br />
self respect, dignity, self confidence.<br />
To get it requires training. The development of skills that<br />
are of value to the employer and to the community.<br />
To help you acquire these skills, my Government will establish<br />
a system of traineeships.<br />
They mean you can undertake training while you get on-the-job<br />
experience. It's like an apprenticeship, except that it will apply to a<br />
wider range of jobs and industries.<br />
In both private enterprise, and in the public sector.<br />
As well as some positions that we'll be making available in<br />
various Government bodies and departments, we have identified<br />
a number of areas in private enterprise where traineeship<br />
schemes can be introduced immediately.<br />
In the coming year, 10,000 traineeships will be made available.<br />
That means 10,000 more young Australians will start their<br />
working life knowing they have a chance to get the qualificationsI<br />
for a rewarding future. </p>
<p>If we all co-operate, our aim of 75,000 young people in<br />
traineeships will be achieved in the bicentennial year, 1988.<br />
You can imagine the impact that this will have both on the<br />
lives of the young people themselves and on the quality of<br />
our society as a whole.<br />
I believe that whatever our occupation, as Australians<br />
we all need to be proud of the things that we do and tne<br />
things that we make.<br />
I want us to be able to hold our head up in the company of<br />
the world and point to the best quality goods at the best<br />
price and know they have a label that reads " Made in Australia".<br />
We're not going to achieve this by taking the backward step<br />
of cutting youth wages.<br />
Training, education, the development of skills, is the way for<br />
us to go.<br />
And the way for us to grow, as a nation and as individuals.<br />
A commitment to education is a further aspect of my<br />
Government's commitment to Australia.<br />
it will come as no surprise to learn that the worst area<br />
of youth unemployment is among those vc~ ung people who drop<br />
out early.<br />
Not only do we have to make education more interesting, more<br />
relevant so that these young people will want to stay at<br />
school longer.<br />
But we have to provide the economic means for them to do so.<br />
To this end,* we have developed a system of youth allowances<br />
that are designed to help you remain at school if you wish2<br />
to resist the economic need to find a job or, indeed, toj<br />
. seek unemployment benefits;<br />
V o enable you to obtain better qualifications and find, in<br />
L-the future, a decent job.<br />
~ As well, the number of positions that will be available at<br />
1, universities and TAFE colleges will be increased.<br />
The details of these and the other aspects of the Government's<br />
youth programme will be released in Tuesday's Budget.<br />
This is not just another Government support scheme.<br />
There are already a number of such schemes for young people.<br />
What I am announcing tonight is a total approach to the<br />
problems faced by young Australians.<br />
It is a means of bringing all of the Government's resources<br />
all of them every facet of Government activity to bear on<br />
our single most important priority. </p>
<p>But it is only a start. Right now we're looking at what else<br />
we can do, as a Government.<br />
And I'd like to ask the young people of Australia to give<br />
that question some serious thought.<br />
Because at the end of this year we'll review where we stand.<br />
And I'll be inviting all young Australians to participate in<br />
that review.<br />
You can tell us where we got it right and where we got<br />
it wrong.<br />
In the meantime, let's all make a start.<br />
The Government can't do it alone.<br />
So tonight, I make an appeal to all Australians.<br />
To our business people when you're setting your plans<br />
for the future make it your first priority to find jobs,<br />
and to create training opportunities for young Australians.<br />
The Government will back you in ways that are both specific<br />
and concrete.<br />
Tuesday's Budget will provide you with the details.<br />
To the trade unions make it your priority to find<br />
opportunities for young people, to give encouragement, and<br />
support, to the various training schemes.<br />
And to all Australians take pride in young Australia. It<br />
is our future.<br />
The welfare and the encouragement of young Australians is<br />
our first priority as a Government.<br />
It is my first priority as Prime Minister.<br />
And it is our collective priority as a nation.<br />
Thank you. </p>
