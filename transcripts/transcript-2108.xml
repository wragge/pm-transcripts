K( INGSTON ELECTORATE LIBERAL PARTY DINNER<br />
Glengowrie, S. A. J, 2 September 1969<br />
Speech by the Prime Minister, Mr, -Lphn Gorton*<br />
Mr. Chairman and Miss Kay Brownbill or after what you said about how<br />
one-eyed everybody is should I call you " Madam Cyclops" you did say<br />
durinig the course of your introduction that I was going to be stuck with the<br />
people of South Australia and I was going to be stuck with you do you<br />
remember? Kay, there is nothing I would want more than that we would<br />
be stuck with you in the House of Representatives for years and years to<br />
come and I hope that all of you present here will keep it that way.<br />
But it is true to say that I have an interest in the people of<br />
South Australia and the State of South Australia. Let me make this quite<br />
clear even though I am speaking in South Australia that it is not an interest<br />
which transcends my interest in the people of We,-tern Australia or New<br />
South Wales or Victoria or any other part of Australia but which takes no<br />
second place to the interest I have in people in the other States.<br />
And this has, I think, been shown I know it can be argued<br />
against by the Opposition but it has been shown by a number of things<br />
which have been done and I hope tonight to be able to indicate one other<br />
area in which we have, as an Australian Government, an interest in this<br />
State. You have got here, and have had for some time an<br />
Australian-renowned, and I think I could almost say a world-renowned,<br />
Festival of Arts. You have taken the lead in Australia in getting this Arts<br />
Festival running and getting people coming to it from all over Australia.<br />
It has been an enormous success. And you are now engaged, I understand,<br />
in an appeal to build a proper centre in which to hold some of this Arts<br />
Festival. The State Government is very generously contributing to this<br />
and so is the Lord Mayor and his Council. But after the State Government<br />
has contributed and after the Council has contributed, there is a requirement<br />
for the raising of $ 300, 000 of public subscription in order to obtain<br />
the total amount required. Your Premier, who never lets an opportunity<br />
pass to make suggestions to the Australian Government how they might<br />
take a greater interest in South Australia, wrote to me and suggested that<br />
the Australian Government might open up a certain Act we have in order<br />
to enable donations to this public appeal of $ 300, 000 to be tax-deductible.<br />
This would be in the same way as they are tax-deductible to appeals for<br />
the Sydney Opera House, I think I find that rather difficult to understand<br />
because it's for so long: and other projects of that kind. And we had<br />
some little discussion about this because had this happened and it's not<br />
going to happen but had it happened and had we made donations taxdeductible,<br />
probably the Australian Government would have lost say<br />
/ 2 </p>
<p>$ 150, 000 out of the $ 300, 000 because it would be about $ 1 in every $ 2 that<br />
the donor would have saved. And we were prepared to do this if your<br />
Premier was prepared to accept it. But then we had another talk and we<br />
both agreed that perhaps it might be more suitable for the State of South<br />
Australia and perhaps it might be more suitable for those interested in<br />
the Festival of Arts if instead of doing this, the Australian Government<br />
was to donate $ 200, 000 of the $ 300, 000 that was sought to be raised by<br />
public appeal. And so this is what the Premier and I have decided would<br />
be the best course of action to take and this is what I said in the beginning<br />
is another example of an interest in the State and people of South Australia.<br />
I propose to take advantage of this opportunity you have<br />
afforded me tonight to speak of some matters that are important to the<br />
country, are important to you, and important to me.<br />
Now, I am not going to go through all the things which are<br />
of significance to Australia which I think are going to be the subject of<br />
decision by people in this room and those whom people in this room can<br />
influence. I want to talk really on only a couple of subjects. And one is<br />
the future defence and security of this country because I think that is at<br />
stake in this election and we have heard insufficient about it.<br />
We have an Opposition which, if it became a government,<br />
would be prepared to abandon National Service training and has said so<br />
without equivocation. I look to the post-Vietnam period. Surely we would<br />
need to mainrLain in Australia in our new situation an army at least of its<br />
present size, post-Vietnam. one-third of our present army is made up<br />
of National Service trainees. Can we afford to allow a government which<br />
would in effect cut our army by one-third, because that is what it means.<br />
Or is it not better for us as we grow stronger, as the conditions in which<br />
we live change from those in which we have all grown up, is it not better<br />
for us to do as we would propose to do and that is to maintain National<br />
Service training in order to ensure that the forces of the size we require<br />
are kept in being for we no longer have the shields we used to have.<br />
This is of great significance, I think, to the future security and defence<br />
of Australia. I think it would be utterly wrong to put into power in this<br />
country a government which would withdraw immediately all ground, sea<br />
and air forces which we now have stationed in Malaysia and in Singapore<br />
as an indication and an earnest of our interest in the security of that<br />
region. Because if the people were to decide that the Opposition should<br />
become a government, then the Five Power Treaty would be shattered and<br />
there would be no longer in the areai to our North any Australian military<br />
presence whatsoever. This, I believe, is ingrained in Australians and<br />
properly ingrained in them that this would be a course detrimental to<br />
our future security. And this is of importance to Australia's future. / 3 </p>
<p>3-<br />
Would it be sensible for us because we depend basically<br />
for our ultimate protection on the United States of America, and through<br />
depending on the United States of America, we depend on the ANZUS<br />
Treaty would it be sensible for us to refuse to play our full part in that<br />
Treaty? Should we say to the United States, " You want to set up some<br />
kind of a defence base, something like the North-West Cape, some other<br />
kind of base which will be of importance to your defence and to our defence<br />
and therefore to our joint defence, you want to do this? Well, we are<br />
going to quibble about it. We are going to argue about it. We are not<br />
going to let you do it. We are going to renegotiate the arrangements under<br />
which the bases which now exist are allowed to exist". Would this be<br />
sensible? Because this is what the present Opposition would do were it<br />
the Government. It is what we would not do. And if it were done I believe<br />
it would break the spirit of the ANZUSTreaty riot necessarily the letter<br />
but break the spirit and that it would for that and other reasons make us<br />
able to rely on protection from this Treaty from the United States with far<br />
less certainty than we can now rely. For a small country such as ourselves,<br />
this again is something of great significance to our security.<br />
Again, I don't suppose there is anybody in this room who is<br />
not horrified at the thought that nuclear weapons exist in the world and of<br />
the destruction they can cause. But they do exist and they do so in some<br />
countries, particularly in China not so far from us. In those circumstances,<br />
don't you think it is detrimental or could be to Australia's security to sign<br />
a Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and give up all chance of protecting<br />
ourselves against any possible future attack unless and until we were<br />
certainly assured that the protection we gave up would come without fail<br />
from some other source. I believe it would be playing with the future of<br />
Australia's children if we did that, If we can get an effective and an<br />
efficient and a proper treaty, one which gives us full protection, of course<br />
we want it, of course we will sign it. But we won't sign it until we reach<br />
those conditions. The Opposition will, at once and without question, and<br />
that is another matter of great significance to Australia's future defence.<br />
On this subject of defence and of foreign affairs, I have been<br />
latterly thoroughly astonished at the interpretations which have been put on<br />
a recent speech made in the Parliament by the Minister for External Affairs,<br />
Mr. Freeth. When I arrived in Adelaide today, somebody poked a microphone<br />
into my face at the airport and said, " What about this defence arrangement<br />
with the Russians?" It seems to be an odd kind of growth with nothing<br />
whatsoever to back it at all, and I'd like to take this opportunity to talk<br />
to you a little of this matter.<br />
Sir, let me go into the history of this a little. The Minister<br />
for External Affairs set out in a speech he made in Parliament, in the<br />
first part of that speech, the approach of President Nixon and of the<br />
United States to the problems of Asia and of South East Asia. He said how<br />
he and we welcomed the President's pledge of the continued interest of the<br />
/ 4 </p>
<p>4-<br />
United States in the cQuntries of Asia and the President's intention that<br />
the United States would fulfil its treaty commitments.<br />
The Minister pointed out that the President emphasised the<br />
security of the countries of Asia must primarily be a matter for themselves.<br />
The Minister reaffirmed that we ourselves in Australia have always believed<br />
that successful resistance to aggression, either direct or indirect, depends<br />
in the last resort on the will and ability of the peoples of the countries in<br />
that area to resist either subversion or aggression. And the President<br />
pointed out that he wished and the Minister stated that we wished as we<br />
have stated before that those countries would develop sufficient strength<br />
in themselves to be able to protect themselves while being helped in the<br />
meanwhile. And the Minister emphasised and this is important that by<br />
sufficient strength, he didn't necessarily mean military strength alone.<br />
We meant also and even more importantly in many respects an<br />
improvement in the standards of living in those countries, the installation<br />
of efficient and honest and incorrupt administrations and public services,<br />
the fostering of harmonious relations with neighbouring countries and the<br />
easing and eventual abolition of communal tensions and racial clashes<br />
within those countries. For all of these matters of which I have just spok-en<br />
are the basis of will and ability to resist aggression, are the basis of will<br />
and ability to resist subversion. These are matters which are sine qua non<br />
if a country is to resist aggression and subversion and this is what we<br />
seek. And in seeking to attain these objectives, as the Minister pointed out,<br />
we have helped and we will continue to help, for these are our objectives<br />
and they are in our national interest to attain.<br />
Now, against that background let me carry the story further.<br />
Mr. BrehZnev recencly stated that the Soviet Union was of the opinion that,<br />
and I quote, was of the opinion that events are putting on the agenda<br />
the task of creating a system of collective security in Asia". And we know<br />
no more of it than that, and the Minister indicated that we knew no more of<br />
it than that. No proposals in any depth or anything else have been put<br />
forward except that one indication of an interest. There have been no<br />
proposals, but as I pointed out at the beginning our objective and the<br />
objective of the United States is to develop regional co-operation, economic<br />
development and therefore security. We recognise in Australia as well,<br />
perhaps better than anyone in the world, that Russian communism has as<br />
its objective, as its ultimate objective, the spreading of the system of<br />
communism throughout the world and is in that sense an imperial power.<br />
We should feel, as we have made it clear that we always<br />
would feel, that our ultimate security in Australia would be threatened by<br />
the establishment of any Russian naval or military bases anywhere in our<br />
own region. We feel that any military alliance between Russia and a<br />
country in our own region would pose a threat to ourselves. We cannot<br />
forget Czechoslovakia and Hungary and the Berlin airlift and all the sorry<br />
chapters of the past. </p>
<p>We have no Intention, nor have we ever considered as the<br />
remotest possibility any military understanding between ourselves and the<br />
Soviet Union or any active military involvement by Soviet Russia in any<br />
collective security arrangement among the countries to our North. For<br />
we think that would be dangerous for us. That should be made clear. I<br />
hope it has now been made clear.<br />
But if, and as yet we do not know, but if proposals are<br />
eventually put forward to help build the economic strength of countries to<br />
our North and those proposals have no strings attached, if proposals are<br />
put forward to lend influence to persuade countries to our North to join a<br />
collective security pact amongst themselves without a Russian military<br />
presence and that is our objective then we should at least be prepared<br />
to examine such proposals, albeit we examine them with caution and with<br />
scepticism and without gullibility. And this was all the Minister for<br />
External Affairs stated in his speech. Yet for some reason I don't<br />
understand, it has been built up and puffed up as if there was some great<br />
change of policy or some sudden soft-line approach towards the USSR. I<br />
don't understand the interpretation, Sir, and I reject it, though I reaffirm<br />
that if acceptable economic help to attain our objectives is suggested, and<br />
is suggested without strings, then it would be ridiculous riot to examine such<br />
suggestions. And I reaffirm that if help in attaining a system of collective<br />
security among the nations of our North amongst themselves is offered<br />
and that is our objective then it would be absurd not to examine those<br />
suggestions, although with the scepticism I have mentioned. That, Sir, is<br />
our approach on this matter. I wonder what the approach of the Opposition<br />
would be? On their past performance, on the way in which they have<br />
excused all the Russian excesses except those in Czechoslovakia, I doubt<br />
very much whether the stand that we have taken on this matter would not<br />
be altered by them in a direction which would in the ultimate endanger this<br />
country. These are all matters which should be in your mind and in the<br />
minds of all Australians when on October 25 they choose whom they wish<br />
to govern them for the next three years.<br />
I have no time now to talk of other issues of significance<br />
and importance in this coming campaign. There are other matters of<br />
social services, of the general developmert of Australia, of the lives which<br />
Australians can lead, but in a meeting such as this and at a time such as<br />
this, I will not go into them, other than to say this. What we will do in<br />
the future by way of development and by " we" I mean all Australians<br />
what courses we will adopt to help those amongst us who are In need of<br />
assistance, what actions we will take to provide more opportunities for<br />
all people throughout our country will in the ultimate depend on those<br />
first matters which I have raised before you. That Is the ability to retain<br />
our own independence, to build up our alliances: to contribute to them with<br />
our own defence forces because that is the rock upon which our development<br />
and indeed our very existence will finally stand. / 6 </p>
<p>S--6-<br />
When you go out from this room, I want you to do what you<br />
can in your own way to see that Kay is returned for this seat to support<br />
those policies, those defence policies I have put before you and those other<br />
policies which at a later time and at a more appropriate time I will also<br />
put before you. For it is the Members you elect that keep a government<br />
in office, and if you agree with the policies proposed, and I hope you do,<br />
and if you are satisfied with your Member, and I know you are, then come<br />
with us in October because we need you and I think Australia needs you.<br />
