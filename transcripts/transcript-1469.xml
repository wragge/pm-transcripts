FOR PRESS-: P. M. No. 7/ 1967<br />
CIVIL AID FOR VIET NAM<br />
The Prime Minister, Mr. Holt, today spoke with the<br />
Minister for External Affairs, Mr. Hasluck and Mr. Askin and Sir Henry<br />
Bolte about possible aid for Viet Nam from New South Wales and Victoria.<br />
As a result of today's talks with Mr. Hasluck, arrangements<br />
Swill be made for a First Assistant Secretary of the Department of External<br />
V Affairs, Mr. K. C. 0. Shann, to meet the New South Wales Minister for<br />
Conservation, Mr. J. G. Beale, to discuss what New South Wales might have<br />
in mind with regard to technical aid.<br />
At Avalon this morning, Sir Henry Bolte indicated to Mr.<br />
Holt Victoria's interest in whatever might be done along these lines.<br />
The Federal Cabinet will have before it a paper on civil<br />
aid for Viet Nam at its next meeting on WeVdn esday week.<br />
CAPBERRA, 23rd January, 1967.<br />
NOTE This is not a Prime Ministerial statement. You could use it as<br />
a statement of fact or attribute it to a spokesman or to me.<br />
By the way, I notice that a lunch-time radio news bulletin quoted<br />
the Prime Minister as describing the Ky visit as an " unqualified success".<br />
VWhat he in fact said was that the visit had served the common purposes of<br />
the two countries very well, and went on to describe why the visit had been<br />
a success. At no time did he use the word " unqualified". A. EGGLETON<br />
Press Secretary to the Prime Minister </p>
