Jj. AUSTAI<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA TUESDAY, 24 FEBRUARY, 1981<br />
PRE-BUDGET CONSULTATIONS<br />
As in past years, the Government will be holding pre-Budget<br />
consultations over the next three months with key bodies to<br />
seek their views and ideas in the context of the preparation<br />
of the Federal Budget for 1981-82.<br />
The meetings will provide organisations and Ministers with the<br />
opportunity for a frank exchange of views on the state of<br />
the economy and discussion of appropriate Budgetary policy<br />
measures. The Government believes that these annual meetings<br />
are extremely beneficial to both the Government and private<br />
organisations. This year, consultations have been scheduled earlier in the<br />
budgetary process so that organisations may have maximum input<br />
into the formation of this year'soBudget.<br />
A diverse range of crganisations will be attending the<br />
consultations, representing a wide spectrum of the business<br />
commuhi-yv, taxpayers, trade unions, consumers and women's<br />
groups. A full list of the organisations attending the<br />
consultations is attached. </p>
