SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
ZHANGZHOU WOOL TEXTILE FACTORY<br />
24 MAY 1986<br />
YOUR EXCELLENCIES, SECRETARY HU OILI, GOVERNOR HU PING<br />
1HEN GENERAL-SECRETARY HU YAOBANG VISITED AUSTRALIA,<br />
ACCOMPANIED BY SECRETARY, HU OILI, IN 1985, HE AND I<br />
DECIDED THAT AUSTRALIA AND CHINA SHOULD CONCENTRATE SOME<br />
OF OUR EFFORTS ON DEVELOPING CO-OPERATION IN THE FIELD OF<br />
WOOL, ITS PRODUCTION, PROCESSING AND MANUFACTURE. THE<br />
OPENING OF THIS JOINT-VENTURE WOOL TEXTILE MILL GIVES<br />
TANGIBLE EXPRESSION TO THOSE ASPIRATIONS, THIS ENTERPRISE<br />
HAPPILY COMBINES ELEMENTS OF RAW MATERIALS PROCESSING,<br />
MANUFACTURE AND EXPORT OF FINAL PRODUCT TO THE OBVIOUS<br />
MUTUAL BENEFIT OF SEVERAL RELATED INDUSTRIES IN BOTH<br />
COUNTRIES. MACQUARIE ! ORSTEDS IS A WELL-KNOWN AUSTRALIAN PRODUCER OF<br />
WOOLLEN TEXTILES. MR ROB HODGE, THE CHAIRMAN OF ITS PARENT<br />
COMPANY, GENERAL INVESTMENTS, HAS MADE A MAJOR COMMITMENT<br />
TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF HIS COMPANY'S RELATIONS WITH CHINA<br />
IN RECENT YEARS TO SUCH AN EXTENT THAT HE IS NOW<br />
PERSONALLY QUITE AN ACCOMPLISHED CHINESE LINGUIST. EARLIER<br />
THIS WEEK, I WAS PLEASED TO WITNESS THE SIGNING IN BEIJING<br />
OF A JOINT-VENTURE AGREEMENT BETWEEN HIS COMPANY AND THE<br />
' EIJING ! O0. 1 TEXTILE MILL, SOME OTHER JOINT VENTURES ARE<br />
UNDER CONSIDERATION. r </p>
<p>2.<br />
DISCUSSIONS BETWEEN MACQUARIE WORSTED AND THE ZHANGZHOU<br />
JUTEMILL FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THIS JOINT VENTURE<br />
HAVE GONE PARTICULARLY SMOOTHLY. INDEED, WE MAY SAY THE<br />
CO-OPERATION BETWEEN BOTH PARTIES IN THIS JOINT VENTURE<br />
IS AN EXAMPLE TO OTHER AUSTRALIAN COMPANIES WHO ARE THINKING<br />
OF INVESTING IN THE CHINESE MARKET. THE COMBINATION OF<br />
MACQUARIE WORSTED'S MODERN WOOL TECHNOLOGY AND THE HIGHLY<br />
SKILLED CHINESE LABOUR FORCE WITH CENTURIES OF TEXTILE<br />
EXPERIENCE HAS CREATED A HIGH QUALITY WOOL FABRIC WHICH CAN<br />
COMPETE SUCCESSFULLY ON THE INTERNATIONAL MARKET. INITIAL<br />
SHIPMENTS OF FABRIC TO AUSTRALIA AND THE UNITED KINGDOM<br />
HAVE BEEN FAVOURABLY RECEIVED BY LEADING MANUFACTURERS.<br />
IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PROGRAM OF CO-OPERATION WE HAVE<br />
DEVELOPED UNDER THE UMBRELLA OF THE AUSTRALIA/ CHINA WOOL<br />
WORKING GROUP, WE HOPE THAT IN THE FUTURE MORE SUCH JOINT<br />
VENTURES WILL BE ESTABLISHED IN CHINA TO USE AUSTRALIAN RAW<br />
MATERIALS AND SEMI-PROCESSED MATERIALS FOR FURTHER PROCESSING<br />
AND RE-EXPORT TO THE WORLD MARKET. THIS TYPE OF COMMERCIAL<br />
ENTERPRISE MAKES THE BEST USE OF AUSTRALIA'S ADVANTAGES IN<br />
WOOL PRODUCTION AND CHINA'S ADVANTAGES IN LABOUR-INTENSIVE<br />
MANUFACTURING INDUSTRY TO THE BENEFIT OF BOTH SIDES.<br />
IN ADDITION, THIS VENTURE SERVES CHINA'S MOST URGENT NEED<br />
NOT ONLY TO DEVELOP NEW PRODUCTIVE CAPACITY THROUGH THE<br />
INTRODUCTION OF NEW TECHNOLOGIES, BUT ALSO TO CREATE NEW<br />
EXPORT MARKETS IN WHICH IT CAN EARN MUCH-NEEDED FOREIGN<br />
EXCHANGE. </p>
<p>3.<br />
IT IS THEREFORE A VERY HAPPY OCCASION THAT I AM ABLE<br />
TODAY, IN THE COMPANY OF MR Hu QILI, TO OPEN THIS PRACTICAL<br />
EXAMPLE OF CO-OPERATION IN ADVANCING OUR MUTUAL TRADE AND<br />
COMMERCIAL INTERESTS, </p>
