ASIAN TOUR 1967 KOREA<br />
ARRIVAL STTEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, MR. HAROLD HOLT<br />
6TH APRIL, 1967.<br />
Mr. Prime Minister, Mrs. Chung, Distinguished Guests:<br />
I thank you for the warm welcome you have given me<br />
Mrs. Holt and my party on this our first visit to Korea It is<br />
indeed the first visit ever made to your country by an Australian<br />
Prime Minister. I hope this fact alone will be some assurance to<br />
you of the interest my country has in Korea and its people, and<br />
will ue accepted by you as an expression of our oodwill towards<br />
you. We look forward to learning over the next few days more<br />
aoout your country and your people.<br />
Australia has folloed your fortunes closely since<br />
1950 when, without pr , vocation or warning you were invaded from<br />
your Vorth. I was a member of the Australian Caoinet then, it<br />
decided nromptly to send Australian forces to assist you in<br />
repelling that ag ression. I oelieve we were the first country<br />
after the United States puolicly to declare our intention of<br />
giving military assistance to Korea. Later we were ' lad to join<br />
in helping you to reconstruct your ravaged country.<br />

rate of growth. You have a Constitutional Democracy. You are<br />
highly respected throughout the free countries of the ' orld.<br />

distruoing influences of communist subversion and aggression<br />
have been brought under control.<br />
The ood example you provide has given you increasing<br />
influence amongst free na ions of Asia and the Pacific. Australia<br />
applauded your initiative in calling the successful conference of<br />
ASPAC last year. Your own experience undoubtedly affected you in your<br />
decision to give substantial military help to Vietnam in its<br />
efforts to resist communist aggression. are proud to have<br />
Australians fighting alongside your own troops in Vietnam, as<br />
they did in Korea in those earlier years.<br />
I was glad to collaborate with your distinuished<br />
President and other national leaders at the Su. imit Conference<br />
in FManila last year.<br />
I am greatly looking forward to our meetin together<br />
again, and to the useful discussions we shall oe aole to have.<br />
Mr. Prime M inister, thank you for this most friendly<br />
reception. Thank you also for affording to me and my party this<br />
welcome opportunity to develop better knowledge and understanding<br />
of the Korea of today. </p>
