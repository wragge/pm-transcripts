PRIME MINISTER'S SPEECH<br />
PARLIAMENTARY LUNCHEON FOR THE KING OF TONGA<br />
KING TAUFA'AHAU TUPOU IV<br />
CANBERRA THURSDAY 8 SEPTEMBER 1988<br />
Your Majesty,<br />
Your Royal Highness,<br />
Distinguished guests,<br />
I am very pleased to welcome Your Majesty and Your Royal<br />
Highness to Australia in this, our Bicentennial Year. In<br />
this visit, we see the continuation of a personal and family<br />
connection with Australia which goes back fifty years and<br />
which will continue for many note.<br />
This is a time of great change in the Pacific. It is<br />
difficult to foresee the impact on our region of current<br />
economic, social, cultural and technological developments.<br />
But it is a time which demands cooperation between the<br />
nations of the Pacific.<br />
For many years now Australia and Tonga have shared a<br />
relationship which demonstrates that independence and<br />
constructive cooperation can go hand in hand.<br />
As members of the Commonwealth and of the South Pacific<br />
Forum, our nations have striven together for the betterment<br />
of our people and of our region.<br />
We are now looking for ways to expand our cooperation.<br />
One way that this could be achieved is through the media. I<br />
know, for example, that Tonga's radio station transmits news<br />
bulletins from Radio Australia. When Tonga introduces<br />
domestic television, I should like to think that we nay be<br />
able to share visual news and current affairs programs.<br />
There is also great value in regular working contact between<br />
our leaders and representatives. The visit to Tonga by the<br />
members of our joint committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence<br />
and Trade in June showed how beneficial such contact can be.<br />
Our Parliamentary Representatives would have had the<br />
opportunity to see for themselves the unique blend of<br />
Polynesian tradition and Parliamentary Government which you<br />
have developed in Tonga. We respect the independence </p>
<p>2.<br />
displayed in pursuit of your regional and international<br />
objectives, We also congratulate your Government on the<br />
stability and confidence it has maintained in the evolving<br />
Pacific arena.<br />
And may I offer you my personal congratulations<br />
Your Majesty, on your recent 70th birthday. We heard in<br />
Australia about the spectacular success of the Royal<br />
Birthday Ball.<br />
On a practical level, there are close and constructive links<br />
between Tonga and Australia in day-to-day life. There is a<br />
Tongan conmunity of some 6,000 in Australia today. Each<br />
year some 50 Tongan students study in Australian<br />
universities and colleges on official scholarships.<br />
Your Majesty, our nations also share a keen interest in<br />
sport. You have done a great deal yourself to nurture sport<br />
in Tonga.<br />
Australians have watched with enthusiasm over the past two<br />
years as Tongan oarsmen have swept across the Pacific,<br />
taking trophy after trophy. I recall the excitement in Apia<br />
in may 1987, when the Tongan canoe achieved a very popular<br />
and impressive victory. I understand that you may be<br />
enlisting Australian expertise in the quest for an even<br />
faster craft. I think that this is an excellent opportunity<br />
for a friendly exchange of information and skills.<br />
You will be aware of the continuing Australian interest in<br />
the developing Tongan tourist industry. From your visits to<br />
some of our resorts in Queensland, you will have had the<br />
opportunity to see the possibility of joint ventures.<br />
I would like to thank Your Majesty for Tonga's participation<br />
both at Expo and in Townsville, where I saw your impressive<br />
display at the Pacific Arts Festival. I am sure you will<br />
enjoy Expo when you visit it on Tonga's National Day.<br />
Later this month, Your Majesty, I am very much looking<br />
forward to visiting Nuku'Alofa for the meeting of the South<br />
Pacific Forum. This will be an important meeting and your<br />
hosting of it is a further sign of Tonga's shouldering of<br />
its regional responsibilities.<br />
Your Majesty,<br />
I thank you for doing us the honour of visiting Australia.<br />
Your visit has been most valuable in helping to cement the<br />
strong, stable and constructive relationship between Our<br />
nations.<br />
