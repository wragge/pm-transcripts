COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA<br />
SPEECH BY<br />
The Rt Hon. W. McMAHON, M. P.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
ON<br />
Defence Forces Retirement Benefits<br />
Ministerial Statement<br />
[ From the ' Parliamentary Debates', 26 October 1972]<br />
Mr McMAHON ( Lowe-Prime Minister)<br />
-by leave-I am now able to inform the<br />
House of the outcome of the Government's<br />
consideration of the report of the Joint<br />
Select Committee on Defence Forces Retirement<br />
Benefits legislation tabled in the House<br />
on 18th May 1972 by the Chairman of the<br />
Committee, the honourable member for La<br />
Trobe ( Mr Jess). Honourable members will<br />
recall that the Committee was formed in<br />
September 1970. It quickly embarked on<br />
a wide-ranging inquiry in the course of<br />
which it recieved 459 written submissiois<br />
from individuals, departments and organisations<br />
and heard evidence from 65 witnesses,<br />
in Victoria, New South Wales,<br />
Queensland and the Australian Capital<br />
Territory. The main recommendation of<br />
the Committee was the introduction of a<br />
completely new scheme to replace the<br />
existing pre-1959 and post-1959 DFRB<br />
schemes. The DFRB scheme has now been<br />
in existence for 24 years. It commenced<br />
in 1948 after an inquiry by an interdepartmental<br />
committee under the chairmanship<br />
of the Honourable J. J. Dedman, then<br />
Minister for Defence.<br />
The original scheme, which had much in<br />
common with the Commonwealth superannuation<br />
scheme, proved to be very inflexible<br />
in operation and in 1957 a committee<br />
chaired by Sir John Allison was<br />
appointed to renew it. The result was the<br />
establishment in 1959 of a new and quite different type of scheme to apply to future<br />
members. This is the new scheme now<br />
known as the post-1959 scheme. Existing<br />
members were not transferred on to the<br />
new basis. Instead special arrangements were<br />
made that preserved for them their accrued<br />
rights and established a basis for them to<br />
contribute for additional benefits as -they<br />
arose. These arrangements, which were<br />
significantly modified in 1965 to permic<br />
members to limit their contributions, are<br />
now known as the pre-1959 scheme. T'ne<br />
pre-1959 scheme is most complex and has<br />
attracted a great deal of criticism.<br />
About 12,000 of the present DFRB<br />
membership of around 80,000 still contribute<br />
on this basis and the present majority<br />
of present pensioners were pre-1959<br />
members, The pre-1959 element of the<br />
DFRB Fund is, however, in a most houyant<br />
position. The report of the Commonwealth<br />
Actuary on his fourth quinquennial investigation,<br />
which the Treasurer ( Mr Snedden)<br />
received from the DFRB Board earlier this<br />
week discloses that on the basis of the DFRB<br />
scheme continuing in its present form, and<br />
I emphasise that proviso, there was an<br />
available surplus of $ 14.9m as at 30th June<br />
1969 in respect of around 19,000 pre-1959<br />
contributors and pensioners. The post-1959<br />
element of the fund, on the other hand,<br />
was approximately in balance, there being<br />
a small deficiency of little importance in </p>
<p>actuarial terms. The treasurer will table<br />
the reports of the Actuary and the DFRB<br />
Board on the fourth quinquennial investigation<br />
later today.<br />
The post-1959 scheme is simpler than the<br />
very complex pre-1959 scheme, but the<br />
Jess Committee concluded that it is still unnecessarily<br />
complex. It has two distict<br />
parts, one covering other rank members,<br />
the other officer members. Each contributor<br />
pays throughout his service a fixed percentage<br />
rate of contribution which varies<br />
with his age and rank at entry. The percentage<br />
rates range from 4.75 per cent for entry<br />
at 15 or less to a maximum of 6 per cent for<br />
other rank members entering at age 30 or<br />
more. Only service from age 20 onwards<br />
counts for pension purposes but both officer<br />
and other rank members who enter before<br />
that age pay lower rates of contribution. The<br />
difference between the maximum contribution<br />
rates for other ranks and officers reflects<br />
the different basis on which other rank<br />
and officer pensions are assessed. The other<br />
rank pension is determined by length of<br />
service while the officer pension is determined<br />
by age at retirement, the maximum<br />
in both instances being a pension approximately<br />
70 per cent of final pay, although<br />
the maximum tapers down -to around 60 per<br />
cent for the most senior officers as in the<br />
superannuation scheme.<br />
Both the pre-1959 and post-1959 schemes<br />
are actuarially based and members' contributions<br />
are retained in an invested fund.<br />
The earning rate of this fund has increased<br />
rapidly in recent years. The estimated<br />
earning rate for the year ended 30th June<br />
1972 is 6.58 per cent, which would be an<br />
increase of 0.24 per cent over the rate for<br />
1970-71. The Jess Committee recommended<br />
that the present fund be transferred to the<br />
Commonwealth, that members' contributions<br />
in future be paid to consolidated revenue<br />
and that the Commonwealth guarantee the<br />
benefits provided and meet all costs not<br />
covered by members' contributions. In the<br />
new scheme recommended by the Committee,<br />
the contribution rate would be a<br />
flat 5.5 per cent of pay for all members<br />
and the level of pensions would be determined<br />
for both officers and other ranks by<br />
length of service.<br />
All service, including service before age<br />
would count for pension purposes and pensions would range from 35 per cent of<br />
final pay after 20 years' service to 76.5 per<br />
cent of pay after 40 years. Officers, like<br />
other rank members, would be entitled to<br />
a pension on completion of 20 years' service,<br />
but a pension reduction penalty of 5 per cent<br />
would apply for each uncompleted year of<br />
service if an officer were retired at his own<br />
request before he reached his retiring age<br />
for rank or an other rank member before<br />
the end of his engagement. The Committee<br />
also recommended that, after retirement, the<br />
whole of a member's pension be adjusted<br />
annually to maintain relativity with average<br />
weekly earnings. The Committee said that<br />
a possible method of achieving this would<br />
be to maintain the relativity of benefits to<br />
current pay for the rank held on retirement.<br />
Other recommendations include desirable<br />
extensions and improvements to provisions<br />
that exist in the present scheme.<br />
The Jess Committee was rightly concerned<br />
to seek to avoid complexions in the<br />
future operations of the DFRB scheme. Far<br />
this reason the Committee concluded that<br />
all present contributors should be compulsorily<br />
transferred to the new scheme and<br />
that they should not be offered a choice of<br />
remaining in their present scheme. The<br />
Government is attracted to the concept of<br />
a simple, comprehensible scheme as outlined<br />
by the Jess Committee, but, in a letter to<br />
the Minister for Defence ( Mr Fairbamn),<br />
the Committee expressed the strong opinion<br />
that if any of the Committee's recommendations<br />
were detrimental to any section of<br />
existing contributors, special short term<br />
arrangements should be made to ensure<br />
that no detriment occurred. The Government<br />
accepted this view and on 20th September<br />
last the Minister for Defence<br />
announced that no-one would be disadvantaged<br />
by participating in the new scheme,<br />
that everybody would have a right by<br />
election to ensure that by participating he<br />
would not be disadvantaged. This inevitably<br />
raised the question whether it would be<br />
possible to make this assurance effective<br />
without introducing a -third DFRB scheme<br />
to supplement the pre-1959 and post-1959<br />
scheme. The Government has no desire to<br />
do so.<br />
There have been strong representations on<br />
-behalf of post-1959 late entrant officers.<br />
There have also been representations on </p>
<p>behalf of those pre-1959 contributors who<br />
have taken the opportunity available to them<br />
of limiting their contributions and receiving,<br />
without increasing the level of their contributions<br />
further, the Commonwealth element<br />
of future accruing pension entitlements. The<br />
crucial point, therefore, is whether it is<br />
practicable to transfer in an equitable way<br />
the pre-1959 and post-1959 contributors to<br />
such a new scheme, without detriment to<br />
any one of them. We shall have an independent<br />
expert examination of this problem.<br />
One supplementary suggestion from the<br />
Jess Committee related to late entry<br />
officers. The number involved are<br />
significant. At 30th June 1972 there were<br />
3,516 officer members who entered at age<br />
23 or later; 773 officers entered at age 33<br />
or later. Because of the change in the basis<br />
for officers' pension to length of service in<br />
the Jess Committee scheme, many of these<br />
late entrant officers would have a lower<br />
pension entitlement. The Jess Committee in<br />
a letter to the Minister for Defence recommended<br />
that these officers, in addition to<br />
receiving the surplus of their contributions<br />
above 51 per cent of salary, should be<br />
allowed to purchase back notional service<br />
to bring the pension they would be contributing<br />
for under the less scheme up to<br />
the level for which they were contributing<br />
under the post-1959 scheme. This proposal<br />
is being actively investigated now.<br />
The Government, like the Jess Committee,<br />
is attracted to the concept of a simple,<br />
comprehensible scheme provided it is possible<br />
to transfer the existing pre-1959 and<br />
post 1959 contributors to the new scheme<br />
without detriment. This is strongly favoured<br />
by the Services. -But if the Government's<br />
assurance of transfer without detriment<br />
should prove to be impracticable, the Government<br />
has decided that it would instead<br />
incorporate many of the recommendations<br />
of the Jess Committee in an improved version<br />
of the post-1959 scheme to which pre-<br />
1959 contributors would be given the<br />
opportunity of transfer on an equitable<br />
basis. In any event, the following 7 specific<br />
recommendations of the Committee have<br />
been accepted by the Government:<br />
Marriages of pensioners before age 60<br />
will be recognised for widows' pension<br />
purposes; A dependent spouse of a female member<br />
or pensioner will be entitled to pension<br />
on her death;<br />
Subject to conditions yet to be determined,<br />
de facto spouses and illegitimate<br />
children will be recognised for<br />
pension purposes;<br />
Children's benefits payable to students<br />
will be continued until age<br />
There will be payable to the estate of a<br />
contributor or pensioner, who dies<br />
without leaving dependants entitled to<br />
pension, an amount equal to one and<br />
one half times his contributions less,<br />
in the case of a pensioner, any pension<br />
or other benefits received;<br />
The tapering of the entitlements of more<br />
senior officers will be eliminated;<br />
A retiring member will not be penalised<br />
by reason of his refusing to sign on to<br />
a reserve force.<br />
The Government has also adopted in a<br />
modified form 6 other recommendations of<br />
the less Committee:<br />
An officer will be able to retire on pension<br />
before reaching his designated<br />
retiring age on completion of 20 years<br />
service for DFR. B purposes;<br />
The present category structure will be<br />
eliminated. Contribution rates will be<br />
expressed as a percentage of pay for<br />
DFRB purposes and pensions as a<br />
percentage of final pay;<br />
For members who enter at age<br />
retirement pensions will range from<br />
35 per cent of final page at age 40 to<br />
70 per cent at age 57 or later;<br />
A retired member will have an unfettered<br />
right within a specified period of<br />
retirement, say, 12 months, to commute<br />
up to the existing one-third of<br />
his pension, other than an invalidity<br />
pension. The amount of the<br />
commuted sum will be determined on<br />
an appropriate annuity basis;<br />
Appropriate provision will be made for<br />
the purchase of past non-contributory<br />
service by present serving members<br />
including those members who in 1948<br />
elected to remain on deferred pay<br />
rather than enter the DFRB scheme;<br />
The concept of an appeals tribunal has<br />
been accepted. </p>
<p>As I have earlier explained, the Jess Committee<br />
recommended that DFRB pensions<br />
be adjusted annually after retirement to<br />
maintain relativity with average weekly<br />
earnings and mentioned a possible method<br />
of doing this. We have concluded that the<br />
issue of post-retirement pension adjustments<br />
cannot be dealt with in the DFRB<br />
context alone. In the past DFRB pensions<br />
have been adjusted at the same time and<br />
on the same basis as Commonwealth<br />
superannuation pensions and similar<br />
adjustment principles have been applied to<br />
other Commonwealth superannuation-type<br />
pensions. The House will recall that last<br />
year the Treasurer in his Budget Speech<br />
announced that the Government was investigating<br />
alternative methods of adjusting<br />
DFRB and superannuation pensions.<br />
We have now decided to refer this<br />
important issue to independent expert<br />
investigation. This investigation will be<br />
called upon to report on various methods<br />
of adjusting pensions for which the Commonwealth<br />
is responsible and the interrelationships<br />
of the various schemes and how<br />
they might be affected by the various<br />
adjustment methods. Additionally, the<br />
investigation will report on the economic<br />
and financial effects of the various methods<br />
considered. The personnel members of the<br />
Navy, Army and Air boards have all<br />
agreed that it is premature at this stage to<br />
press for an annual updating of DFRP pensions<br />
in the light of the other schemes<br />
needing similar consideration. Children's<br />
and orphans' pensions in both the DFRB<br />
and superannuation schemes are expressed<br />
as fixed amounts, although there is an<br />
alternative basis for assessing orphans' pensions.<br />
The manner of determining children's<br />
and orphans' pensions in the DFRB<br />
and superannuation schemes is at present<br />
under consideration and any decisions<br />
taken will be incorporated in whatever<br />
scheme emerges,<br />
We have also given careful consideration<br />
to the Committee's recommendation that<br />
the DFRB scheme be administered by the<br />
Department of Defence and that the<br />
Minister for Defence should be the responsible<br />
Minister. The Government is satisfied<br />
that the present arrangement of the one<br />
organisation-the office of the superannuation<br />
and DFRB boards-servicing both the<br />
DFRB and superannuation schemes, is effective and results in significant economies<br />
through the common use of highly<br />
specialised staff and facilities. There is also<br />
a clear need for co-ordination of policy in<br />
relation to the main Commonwealth contributory<br />
superannuation schemes, namely,<br />
the DFRB scheme, the superannuation<br />
scheme, the schemes of the Commonwealth<br />
Banking Corporation and the<br />
Reserve Bank and the parliamentary and<br />
ministerial retiring allowances schemes. In<br />
the Government's view, this is at present<br />
facilitated by one Minister, the Treasurer,<br />
having responsibilities in relation to all 6<br />
schemes. Another important recommendation of<br />
the Jess Committee was that the present<br />
invested fund of members' contributions,<br />
which stood at $ 154m at 30th June 1972,<br />
be transferred to the Commonwealth and<br />
contributions of members in future be paid<br />
to Consolidated Revenue. I referred earlier<br />
to the improvement in the earning rate of<br />
the DFRB Fund. An invested fund is<br />
likely in the long term to return earnings<br />
at a level that enables members' contributions<br />
to provide greater support for<br />
benefits than would otherwise be the case.<br />
Accordingly, the DFRB Fund will be<br />
retained. The Government has, however,<br />
decided that the investment powers relating<br />
to this fund and the superannuation fund<br />
should be widened so that up to 25 per<br />
cent of each fund can be invested in<br />
shares, debentures, real property, and in<br />
loans to building societies. The Government<br />
proposes also to establish an investment<br />
trust to handle the investment of the<br />
2 funds. The Government is working<br />
towards the necessary amending legislation<br />
being ready for introduction in the<br />
Autumn sitting next year. As already<br />
announced, the legislation will operate<br />
from 1st October 1972. We believe that<br />
the improvements that will be effected by<br />
the legislation will simplify the present<br />
arrangements and result in a very much<br />
better DFRB scheme.<br />
Before I commend this paper to the<br />
House, may I refer in particular to the<br />
dedicated and excellent work that has been<br />
done by the honourable member for La<br />
Trobe ({ Mr Jess), the ' honourable member<br />
for Isaacs (-Mr Hamer), and the honourable<br />
member for Herbert ( Mr ' Bonnett). . I<br />
have read the Committee's report and I </p>
<p>have listened to the arguments that those<br />
honourable member's put to me. I have had<br />
to accept that there is no monopoly of wisdom<br />
in any official group or-perhaps I<br />
could put it this way-in any Ministerial<br />
group. These honourable members have<br />
made a notable contribution. They have<br />
persuaded me that some of the amendments<br />
' which they have suggested are worth<br />
while and in the interests of the active and the retired servicemen. I believe they make<br />
a notable contribution to the DFRB<br />
scheme. I congratulate those honourable<br />
members ; because I think they have done<br />
an immensely important job on , behalf of<br />
the servicemen of this country. I now commend<br />
this paper to the House. I present<br />
the following paper:<br />
Defence Forces , Retirement , Benefits-Ministerial<br />
statement, 26th October 1972.<br />
