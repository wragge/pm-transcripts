PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 26 FEBRUARY 1986<br />
I have sent the following message to President Corazon<br />
Aquino of the Philippines:<br />
" Please accept the congratulations and best wishes' of the<br />
Australian Government and-people on your great victory.<br />
The will of the Filipino people has prevailed.<br />
This would not have been possible without your courage and<br />
determination, which have won you admiration in Australia<br />
and around the world. I pay tribute to that. I pay<br />
tribute to the magnificent resolve of the millions of<br />
Filipinos who, through their commitment to democracy and to<br />
fairness and justice in the conduct of your country's<br />
affairs, managed to secure the victory that was properly<br />
theirs. That this has been achieved with little evident<br />
violence reflects great credit on the Filipino people. The<br />
roles of church and other leaders have been both courageous<br />
and exemplary. The many who put their lives at risk<br />
deserve the highest praise.<br />
As a near neighbour and regional partner, Australia has a<br />
keen interest in the Philippines and a strong concern for<br />
the welfare of the Filipino people. our feelings have been<br />
with you during the recent difficult and indeed critical<br />
weeks. We now look forward to developing a relationship<br />
which is based on shared respect for political freedom,<br />
human rights and democratic choice.<br />
In recent years the Philippines has not been able to<br />
participate to its fullest potential in the expanding<br />
inter-relationships of this region. While the previous<br />
regime was in office, I myself chose not to visit the<br />
Philippines as Prime Minister. Your impending Presidency<br />
allows us a new start in building a relationship which is<br />
commensurate with the Philippines' important place in the<br />
region, and I am looking forward to a meeting with you at<br />
the earliest opportunity. If it is convenient to you, the<br />
Australian Foreign Minister, Bill Hayden, plans to visit<br />
Manila in the next few days to establish high level contact<br />
between our Governments. </p>
<p>L.<br />
The Australian Government recalled our Ambassador to the<br />
Philippines over the weekend as a mark of protest against<br />
signs that Mr Marcos would cling to that power which the<br />
people had already denied him. We have now asked our<br />
Ambassador to return to Manila to take over the Embassy,<br />
which I am glad to note has already established friendly<br />
and cooperative relations with you and your colleagues.<br />
Your accession to the Presidency, with the clear support of<br />
the majority of the people, marks a new beginning. We now<br />
look forward to the smooth assumption of your authority<br />
across the country.<br />
Clearly the Philippines faces a huge task in the<br />
restoration of democratic processes and the implementation<br />
of economic reforms. You have the best wishes of the<br />
Australian Government and people as you tackle these<br />
challenging problems. I can assure you of the Australian<br />
Government's full cooperation and support.<br />
Bob Hawke" </p>
