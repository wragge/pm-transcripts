VJITH THE RT. HON. THE PRIME MINISTER,<br />

23RD APRIL, 1963.<br />

Ex-Senator Condon Byrne<br />
Mr. H. J. Summers,<br />
( News Editor ( QTQ9)<br />
DEAN BADDELEY:<br />
PRIME MINISTER Mr. Prime Minister, may I say how much I adore<br />
every minute of the four and a half years I have<br />
been in Australia. One of the things which I find<br />
awfully fascinating here is to see the sort of<br />
various levels of influence coming from other parts<br />
of the world the American influence, the European<br />
influence and the Asian influence. Now, in th-e<br />
present situation, all of these influendes are of<br />
tremendous significance to our whole way of life.<br />
I wonder if you would like to comment how you think<br />
this pattern will take shape in the future, whether<br />
we shall gear ourselves more to one or the other<br />
to Europe, to the United States, or to Asia,<br />
Well, you know, I think that there are some influences<br />
which are superficial and therefore obvious, There<br />
are others that are perhaps more profound and it is<br />
very difficult to forecast which will fall into<br />
that group or which into that group. The influence<br />
of America on Australian habits and speech is, of<br />
course, obvious, largely as the result of the moving<br />
pictures in the earlier days and still to an extent,<br />
to television and what-have-you; and the vocabulary<br />
in Australia tends to be garnished with American<br />
expressions. All that's quite true. How far that<br />
is permanent I wouldn't like to say. It is equally<br />
true that with a lot of immigrants coming into<br />
Australia, particularly from the European countries,<br />
we are beginning to take a little interest in cooking<br />
food new dishes new stYles, and I am sure that<br />
the impact of these new citizens on what you might<br />
call the " restaurant habits" of Australia is<br />
immediate and obvious. But all these things, I<br />
think, are on the whole, superficial. They are<br />
interesting, certainly; they are sometimes very<br />
engaging but they are superficial, if I may repeat<br />
that worA. Our habits of mind are pretty deop down<br />
in us and I think it will take a long, long time<br />
before the instinctive processes of thought derived<br />
from Great Britain are altered. You know, I<br />
frequently say to myself and to other people if they<br />
will listen, that the British habit of mind is<br />
inductive. 1feIar gue always from the particular to<br />
the general and this is deep in our consciousness,<br />
It is the history of our parliaments; it is the<br />
history of the common law, whereas Continental<br />
countries are deductive and , aherica, to a remarkable<br />
extent is the same: Lay dow~ n the general principle<br />
and then deal with the particular case. It is a<br />
different habit of mind. 66009 @ 06690/ 2 </p>
<p>-2<br />
QUESTIONER Would you say th~-is is because in the English way of<br />
life there is a tremendous value set upon individual<br />
enterprise, individual thought, individual<br />
ingenuity?<br />
P. M. I think that's right but it is not the entire<br />
explanation. I think this goes back to the fact<br />
that England developed a process of civilization<br />
which wasntt entirely dominated by the old Roman<br />
ideas. Exccept for a fleeting century or two,<br />
they were never in the Roman Empire and if you go<br />
back to the roots of our legal system, our<br />
parliamentary system, you will find something that<br />
you won't find in Justinian, speaking legally or<br />
in the codifications of Europe, speaking polilically.<br />
Yes, I think there is a profound difference.<br />
Q. We proceed, Sir, from the particular case to the<br />
general principle and don't rely so much on codes<br />
of law like the Code Napoleon or the Justinian Code.<br />
P. M. I thoroughly agree with you.<br />
Q. Do-vm from precedent to precedent.<br />
P. M. Yes. And, of courso, the fact is that our systems<br />
have been worked out on encountering a problem and<br />
saying, " Well, now, what's the thing to do about<br />
that, What makes justice and sense about that,"<br />
and it's decided to do it this way. And in a<br />
hundred years' time, some clever graduate comes<br />
along and does a study on this and discovers that<br />
certain principles have been evol~ ved. But the<br />
people who did the things weren't much concerned about<br />
the principles that they wore evolving, as in the<br />
intrinsic justice and practicability of what they<br />
were doing.<br />
Q. What about Asia?<br />
P. M. The Asian influ,. nce, I would have thought at the<br />
momentl was very slight. Of course it is quite<br />
true that, geographically, we have an intimate<br />
association and will have a more and more intimate<br />
association with 1' sia. I don't agree with people<br />
who say that means that we are now to be regarded<br />
as an Asian country. I don't think that's true.<br />
I think that we will continue to be a country with<br />
all our basic principles, our basic ideas deriving<br />
from the old world. But more and more, we will have<br />
to learn to live with the Asian countries, to<br />
understand them not only to keep the peace with<br />
them but to establish positive goodwill with them.<br />
This is not going to be an easy or quick process.<br />
QQ There is their cultural and trade associations in<br />
Malaysia,<br />
P. M. Yes, and we have much to learn from them and they<br />
will have something to learn from us. I say all<br />
that and I believe all that, 2 but I don't accept the<br />
proposition that we ought just to go around saying,<br />
11, doll, we are an Asian country now in Australia,<br />
with no connection with the Old World," 1 but we<br />
have e 9 / 3 </p>
<p>-3<br />
Q. But you cannot escape geography, Sir.<br />
P. M. Oh, no, Exactly. But I thought the point I was trying<br />
to make was that, geographically, there we are<br />
Indonesia next door Malaya, Laos, Viet Nain, Burma,<br />
India, Pakistan, China, all'these countries, they are<br />
in our section of the world, and I don't ignore<br />
geography. I think that how we get to understand<br />
them and how we can perhaps influence the way they go<br />
about things may have a lot to do with our future.<br />
But I can say all that and still be, as the Scots<br />
would say, Robert Gordon Menzies QMingies") ( Laughter)<br />
Q. Sir Robert, that brings us on to another aspect of the<br />
whole situation and it is this: Presuming that<br />
Australia does retain the hard core of the traditional<br />
British point of view, traditions and culture; now,<br />
we find a new British Commonwealth emerging, newi<br />
Asian nations, coloured nations, black nations, with<br />
different ethnic ties; we are going to see a<br />
completely new British Commonwealth. Can this new<br />
Commonwealth, in its new form, assume the place of<br />
the old one? Australia obviously can fit into the<br />
pattern but can they? Therefore, what part do you<br />
thinks hr Robert, that the new emerging British<br />
Commonwealth, with all these vast differences that<br />
are now injected into it, can play in the new world?<br />
P. M, Well, you have now put what I believe but the Dean<br />
will know better than i do the 064 question.<br />
Because, I don't think really, that anybody can answer<br />
that question. You See, my memory goes back a long<br />
way. I remember attending a Prime Ministers'<br />
Conference it wasn't then called such in 1935.<br />
A long time ago. I wasn't Prime Minister, but I went<br />
there to represent my Prime Minister, Mr. Lyoens, who<br />
was ill at the time:-. And there were five of us,<br />
sitting at the table, that's all. Ie were all the<br />
same kind of fellow, we all spoke the same language,<br />
iwe all had grown up on the samu body of ideas. All<br />
thi -s was quite simple and the last one I attended,<br />
last year, there were what, fourteen or fifteen of<br />
us, togethr with five or six or seven observers who<br />
next time will be Prime Ministers themselves. And<br />
it would be idle to contend that it is the same sort<br />
of thing. It isn't. Itts a very strange mixture<br />
this new Commonwealth because some of us are in Zhe<br />
direct allegiance to Zhe Throne and ethers, who<br />
recognise the Queen as the head of the Commonwealth,<br />
but are themselves, republics. The Queen's writ doesn't<br />
run in their countries, And, of course, some of them<br />
are pretty rich in experience. You tako a statesman<br />
like Mr. Nehru. He is as rich in experience of public<br />
affairs as anybody could be, And take President Ayub<br />
of Pakistan or the Tunku in Malaya these are people<br />
who by long association really do think mere or loss<br />
as we do, Then you get somo new countries, just<br />
emerged, with the echoes of their struggles still in<br />
their ears. You can't expect them to be looking at<br />
things in the soa way and, in fact, if we all looked<br />
at things in the same way, it wouldn't be much of a<br />
Commonwealth, would it? I must say, I still find<br />
myself saying every now and then, " I wish I knew what<br />
he had in the back of his maind," 1 and perhaps he is<br />
saying the same thing. 0 0 / 4 </p>
<p>Q. Isn~ t it a fact Sir Robert that each one of those<br />
countries is changing, undergoing a process of change?<br />
Australia, itself, is undergoing a profound process of<br />
change, You would agree on that?<br />
P. M. Oh, entirely, And as a matter of fact, what you say<br />
just reminds me of this. We are a little bit tempted<br />
to lump them all together. To take all the African<br />
countries, for instance, that have merged and say,<br />
IhVell, now, the African countries think so and so,"<br />
It's silly because they are all different. The first<br />
thing that we have to learn, if we are to be wise, is<br />
to know that they are different, that there is a world<br />
of difference, from the point of view of the Prime<br />
Minister of Nigeria, Sir Abubakar Balewa, and Nkrumah<br />
in Ghana, and probably a great deal of difference between<br />
them and Tanganyika or wherever it may be. These are<br />
not the same countries. You just can't apply a simple<br />
rule and say " Well, that's where they fit in," because<br />
the fact thai they have become independent means T~<br />
they all have their own national aspirations. Difficult<br />
enough to persuade a New Zealander that he's the same<br />
as an Australian. ( Laughter) Much more difficult to<br />
persuade a Ghonian that hets the same as a Tanganyikan.<br />
Q. Sir Robert, do you think any common point of view<br />
British Commonwealth point of view can continue to<br />
emerge among these nations? That again is purely<br />
speculation.<br />
P. M. Well, I must say I am optimistic about this because at<br />
several recent meetings I am practically the oldest<br />
inhabitant now, you see<br />
Q. You are the doyen of the corps.<br />
P. M. and at the last meeting or two I have noticed<br />
acute differences of opinion, then some discussion and<br />
I have been interested to see how much advance is made<br />
to a more common point of view, a more common understanding.<br />
You can have a conference at which people<br />
begin by emphasising their differences and at the end<br />
of a week they are emphasising the matters on which they<br />
agree. And that is the spirit of the Commonwealth.<br />
So I am no pessimist,<br />
Q. It's encouraging because the British Commonwealth should<br />
have a tremendous part to play if it can retain its<br />
integrity, its unity in the new world.<br />
P. M. Tremendous, and the less dominating it is in the physical<br />
world, the more influential it can become in the world<br />
of tile spirit. It can indeed, presenting quality, wisdom,<br />
character and experience.<br />
Speaking of the changes in Australia, Sir Robert nobody<br />
would have seen as much experience as you. In ail<br />
Australian history, there hasn't beon a man who has so<br />
long held the Prime Ministership as yourself. Nobody<br />
would be in a position mere than you to judge the change<br />
gradual, but ever so constant change in this country.<br />
Viewing it as from today, what would you say are the<br />
most significant changes in Australia's development, over<br />
the span of your political life? 0 &amp; 00.1a/ 5 </p>
<p>P. M. Well, that would be a difficult one. Wie have had, of<br />
course, the most tremendous internal physical development<br />
and that goes on. But I think, on the whole, the greatest<br />
development has been in the position that we occupy in<br />
relation to other countries. I do think that we can say<br />
without boasting that we have a significance novi with other<br />
countries, a significance in London, a significance in<br />
Washington which porhaps we didn't have before except by<br />
fits and starts. I think there has been a very great<br />
development of an understanding in those places of us and<br />
of an understanding on our part of them. This, I think,<br />
has been a great development.<br />
Q. Do you think, Sir Robert, that our significance is somewhat<br />
out of proportion and greater than our physical<br />
strength, our population?<br />
P. M. I am sure of that.<br />
Q* And even our remoteness?<br />
P. M. I am sure of that. Our remoteness may perhaps be a<br />
contributing factor.<br />
Q. We stand a bit aloof from the scene?<br />
P. M. Oh, yes. Here we are; we attract the attention of some<br />
of the old Wiestern powers by the very fact that we are<br />
remote and that we are carrying on in the old traditions,<br />
and I think this is a source of strongth for us.<br />
Q. There are of course the cha--nges developmentally. There<br />
are changes in the emphasis on Australian development.<br />
You would agree I think we Queonslanders like to think<br />
that it is so that there has been a greater emphasis in<br />
recent times, very recent times, on the potential of the<br />
north and the development of the north.<br />
P. M. I think that over the last five years, the growth of<br />
emphasis on northern development has been quite remarkable,<br />
and it is not just all a matter of government or governments'<br />
point of view. The discovery of uranium at the<br />
time was most exciting and attracted a great deal of<br />
attention; the great bauxite deposits in the north;<br />
the phenomenal mineral developments in Mount Isa the<br />
increasing emphasis in the public mind on mineral wealth<br />
as a source of Australian development. All this has<br />
happened in just a few years. And of course,<br />
This oil discovcury in Queensland is, of course of<br />
dramatic importance and if it is followed by other<br />
discoveries, as I think we may reasonably hope.....<br />
Q. In other parts of Australia?<br />
P. M. Yes, or in Queensland or wherever it may be. If this<br />
happens, of course, this could revolutionise the Australian<br />
external ecotiomy by reducing the drain on our overseas<br />
resources. I think it is in the mineral field that you<br />
have had the dramatic and exciting things over the last<br />
five years and they have all lifted eyes to the north.<br />
There is no doubt about that. */ 6 </p>
<p>-6-<br />
Q. Unfortunately, Sir Robert, we arc suffering in Queensland<br />
from the fact that we do not seem to be attracting the<br />
migrants here. Apparently migrants are attracted to<br />
those areas where there is heavy industrialisation. We<br />
are a magnificent primary-producing State. It would<br />
appear that some conscious and determined effort by the<br />
Commonwealth the State and the private sector of<br />
business will be necessary to redirect the trend,<br />
otherwise we become the victim of circumstances and the<br />
gap between us and the industrialised States gets wider<br />
and wider. Would you think that is the position?<br />
P. M. I think that is the position. It's quite true. I read<br />
with great pleasure about certain industrial developments<br />
that are occurring here. There is, I think not the<br />
slightest doubt that migrants will go where there is a<br />
prospect of industrial employment. Indeed, unless we<br />
have increasing secondary industrial activity, I don't<br />
think we can sustain the flow of migrants because there<br />
is not much additional employmunt to be got in the rural<br />
industries, Every authority on the rural industries will<br />
admit that.<br />
Q. Particularly with increased mechanisation?<br />
P. M. That's right. With increased mechanisation, and therefore<br />
if you are going to have a hundred thousand people coming<br />
into the country each year, there must be a sustained<br />
development of secondary industries. Well, I think I can<br />
look back to a time, you know, many years ago, when<br />
industrial development wasn't f5Aightfully encouraged in<br />
some States. I think that's right.<br />
Q. That's perfectly true. The sugar industry for one.<br />
P. M. So far as I am concerned, I think that every State that<br />
has the potential within itself ought to be encouraged<br />
in industrialization, so that it has a balanced economy.<br />
I remember the time when South Australia was a purely rural<br />
ccmmaunity, and during the war when I was Prime Minister,<br />
we put a number of munitions establishments into South<br />
Australia, South Australia is now, in terms of percentage,<br />
one of the ziost highly industrialized States in Australia<br />
and that's why the proud moment cane when Sir Thomas<br />
Playford was able to say, " We are no longer a claimant<br />
State".<br />
Q. And, Sir Robert do you visualise that that position might<br />
develop here with the concentration of effort in those<br />
three centres?<br />
P. M. I do. Well, I don't mind telling you and I am not just<br />
saying this because I am in Brisbane that a lot of people<br />
in England have spoken to me from time to time, " Where do<br />
you think So-and-So ought to go to got in on the great<br />
stream of development in Australia?" I always say<br />
Queensland.<br />
Q. Splendid.<br />
P. M. Because I think Queensland has a greater potential for<br />
future development than any other State in Australia.<br />
I do. And it is beginning to come. oa. * e oa/ 7 </p>
<p>-7<br />
One of the great contributions that Queensland has<br />
made, it seems to me, is in the export market and I<br />
think I am right in saying and you must correct-me<br />
if I am wrong that the contribution made by exports<br />
from Queensland last year and previous years too,<br />
exceeded by far anything else that any other State made.<br />
P. M. You mean per head?<br />
Q. Yes.<br />
P. M. That wouldn't surprise me at all. You take sugar, for<br />
example. The export of sugar from Queensland, ten years<br />
ago, twelve years ago, was about half a million tons.<br />
Today it is a million and a quarter tons. This is a<br />
very big item. The Mt. Isa developments alone will<br />
produce an export income which nobody dreamed of seven<br />
or eight years ago. The bauxite deposits, all these<br />
things, coal exports now why, it is only the other day<br />
that we were importing coal. You see? And now exporting<br />
coal, and of course the big industry, the cattle industry<br />
in Queensland, has suffered from time to time by droughts<br />
and one of the counter-agents to the drought is to have<br />
effective means of transporting cattle out; and beef<br />
roads that are going on now all these steps I hopewill<br />
continue and continue and mean that the exports of<br />
beef from Queensland will grow and, I think, quite<br />
phenomenally.<br />
Q. I shall think you are a Queenslander in a moment,<br />
instead of a Victorian. It's very heartening,<br />
P. M. Well, Itm a Queen's Counsel. ( Laughter)<br />
Q. It is very heartening for us in Queensland to hear you<br />
say these things because we talk a great deal about the<br />
future of Queensland and think of oil and bauxite and so<br />
on, but I don't think half of us quite realise the<br />
tremendous contribution it will have to the future of<br />
Australia,<br />
Q. Well, against this background of the future of Queensland<br />
and of-Australia, so very very bright and so very.<br />
promising and now starting to get under way, comes the<br />
whole question of Australian defence, the integrity and<br />
security of the country. Mr. Prime Minister, would you<br />
care to comment on this? Do you think Australia is<br />
regarded as a sort of Southern bastion of the American<br />
defence arcl or do you think Australia and i1erica*<br />
reciprocally have common security engagements, each as<br />
important, significant, perhaps indispensable for the<br />
other.<br />
P. M. I think our relations with America must be regarded as<br />
reciprocal. It would never do if we underplayed our<br />
part in defence. I think we constantly have to revise<br />
what we are doing in the defence field. We are doing<br />
it now, at this very moment in the Cabinet, because we<br />
can't just leave it to the other fellow. If we want<br />
America to stand by us in a time of crisis, we must<br />
stand by America. It is as simple as that. You can't<br />
have one-way traffic on this matter and, really, I have<br />
been very upset by some of the isolationist tendencies<br />
which manifest themselves in some of this recent talk<br />
4P eo/ 8 </p>
<p>8-<br />
P. M. about a nuclear-free Southern Hemisphere; whether<br />
( Contd,) the Americans ought to be allowed to have a signalling<br />
station in the north-west of Australia. I think this is<br />
just old-fashioned isolationism, and quite inconsistent<br />
with our treaty arrangements with the United States.<br />
Q6 It is something that is giving the Australian people<br />
cause for very grave thought.<br />
P. M. I am sure it is.<br />
Q* In the course of your long and very distinguished<br />
service as Prime Minister of Australia, Sir Robert, you<br />
must have also seen great changes in the world of<br />
education.<br />
P. M. Yes I think I have. This is, of course, the evergreen<br />
topic. I even find myself being attacked for not<br />
being interested in it. I think it is a little<br />
ironical.<br />
Q. I remember a speech you made at Queensland University....<br />
P. M. But really it is phenomenal when I look back at my own<br />
schooldays, going to a country State school and then to<br />
a State School in Ballarat, going to a secondary school,<br />
going to a public school and then to a University, and<br />
think of the relatively primitive arrangements that<br />
existed then and the relatively small amount of money<br />
that was spent in State Budgets on education. I really<br />
thank heaven that things have changed so much. Of<br />
course, we can always spend moro but the rate of<br />
expenditure today is, I think, quite exciting. And, of<br />
course, in the case of the universities which I have<br />
made rather my own special responsibility well, when<br />
I spoke to Sir Keith Murray in England ana said, " Would<br />
you come and be the Chairman of the Committee?" and<br />
finally stole him from Harold Macmillan who was then his<br />
Minister and he came out, I wasn't even game to tell the<br />
Treasury what I was doing. And we got the report and<br />
this, of course, ran into almost as many millions as<br />
people had been thinking in thousands, and each three<br />
years it doubJ~ es itself and I don't grudge a penny<br />
of it. But I think there is a terrific challenge to<br />
us in A-ustralia. We are either going to become an<br />
increasingly highly-trained and well-educated people<br />
technologically, yes scientifically, yes culturally,<br />
in the humanities, perhaps, much more important than<br />
some people think. We are going to do this and become<br />
more and more influential and responsible in the world<br />
or we will become not only remote but second-rate and<br />
that's no good.<br />
Q. Do you think that the fact that the system of education<br />
is very much bound up with each State is a weakness or<br />
a strength?<br />
P. M. No, I don't. I think it is a strength. I don't believe<br />
in uniformity on these matters. I don't want to have a<br />
Commonwealth power over education. I don't want to have<br />
some centralised bureaucracy at Canberra deciding what<br />
is a good systom for North Queensland and what's a good<br />
system for South Tasmania. Really it doesn't work,<br />
That's no good. Education is someohing that you do to<br />
/ 9 </p>
<p>9<br />
P. M. the individual, not to the mass. It is the individual<br />
( Contd.) that you are dealing with and therefore -there must be<br />
a tremendous lot of individuality about State systems of<br />
educatilon and regional systems of education. No, Heaven<br />
forbid that we should have uniformity in this,<br />
Q. What is true there, Mr. Prime Minister, is true also in<br />
the general sense, the general administrative, executive<br />
and political sense.<br />
P. M. Quite right. This is the case for Federalism. I'm a<br />
Federalist. I think it would be a bad thing if we had<br />
everything centralised. You know, my dear fellow, we<br />
have both met these fellows who say, " I believe in<br />
centralisation of power and decentralisation of<br />
administration." As you would say, Dean, " Hooey".<br />
( Laughter)<br />
Q, Mr. Prime Minister, would you think that perhaps the<br />
Commonwalth Constitution is requiring some amendinelit in<br />
some particulars that may centralise some aspects of<br />
power more,<br />
P. M. I think that there are some amendments that could very<br />
well be made to the Constitution but the difficult is to<br />
get any five people to agree on them.<br />
Q. And certainly to carry a referendum?<br />
P. M. Yes,<br />
Q. What about the other method, Sir Robert, of the States<br />
under the appropriate section transferring powers? They<br />
are most reluctant to do that I would think.<br />
P. M. Oh, we have had an almost unbroken failure on that front<br />
because if one State does, another State doesn't. You<br />
can't have a Federalpcier that limps along, operating in<br />
three States and not in three. But it is high time we<br />
got over this idea that the States are all separate<br />
bodies, that they are sovereign, because as you know, they<br />
are not sovereign. They exercise sovereign powers just<br />
as the poor old Commonwealth does. We all exercise<br />
sovereign powers in our sphere of them, what has been<br />
given to us. But we ought to preserve Federalism, but<br />
to cu-1tivate the habit of thinking nationally a little<br />
more than we do. The two things are not irreconcilable.<br />
Q. Do you think, Sir, that oven though the States lost<br />
a great deal of their sovereignty once the power of<br />
diruct taxation was substantially accumulated in the<br />
Commonwealth, that there is still a residue of sovereignty<br />
that is well worth preserving and is most valuable and<br />
salutary, a0 0 0 0 1 0* 0 00 </p>

P. M. Well, you know, this word " sovereignty" is rather abused.<br />
You don't have a sovereign State in a Federation. That<br />
was settled a hundred years ago. You have sovereignty<br />
in the community as a whole divided up, some parts of the<br />
sovereignty going to the central Parliament and some<br />
parts remaining with the States. This is the whole<br />
essence. Sovereignty lies in -the nation. And I think<br />
that if we just begin to think that way a, little and to<br />
be first of all keen on what happens to the nation, we<br />
can still be pretty strong Federalists. I am myself.<br />
I don't want to see unification in Australia. I am<br />
a Federalist, but I am also a Nationalist in the sense<br />
that I balieve in this nation. Indeed I ought to.<br />
They have been trusting me with the business of looking<br />
after them for a long time.<br />
Q. Do you think it will come off? Her Majesty The Queen<br />
will have a residence in Canberra? She will be resident<br />
here for say, two months of the year?<br />
P. M. With very groat respect to His Grace the Archbishop, I<br />
think this rather sweeping, a sort of bravura gesture,<br />
because an awful lot has to be worked out, you know,<br />
You can lay out a lot of money and have a residence and<br />
who lives in it except for a month when The Queen comes<br />
and what do you do writh it? Oh no. All I say is that<br />
these proposals are well worthy of some study but they<br />
don't adimit of a kerbstone reply.<br />
Q. I shouldn't have thought it was practicable. If she did<br />
it to Australia she would have to do it to New Zealand,<br />
she would have to do it to other parts of the Cormonwealth.<br />
Sheo would never be at home. So it does seem a little<br />
bit unrealistic and I am quite sure that we all feel that<br />
the recent visit of Hor Majesty was an unbounded success<br />
and tihat Australia is as loyal to the Crown as ever before.<br />
P. M. No doubt about it.<br />
Q. I am sure you are basking in your Thistle. ( Laughter)<br />
P. M. 14 Basking in a thistle is not a prospect that appeals to me.<br />

DEAN Uell, I think on tha-t rather humorous note, I ama afraid<br />
BADDELEY we must draw our programme to an end, Mr. Prime<br />
Minister, will you please accept the gratitude of our<br />
viewers and listeners and the immense gratitude of this<br />
station and particularly of Messrs. Summers, Condon<br />
Byrne and myself for honouring us with this visit.<br />
P. M. T'hank you.<br />
DEAN Web always feel it is a jolly good thing for Southerners<br />
BADDELEY: to come and sniff some of Queensland's sun and the<br />
expansiveness and fun of it all and I hope that you will<br />
go away a little refreshed by your very short visit to<br />
Queensland. Thank you very much indeed for coming. </p>
