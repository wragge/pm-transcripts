    <content><![CDATA[<p>The New South Wales Premier - and the most senior Labor person in office in Australia - has given the Opposition Leader, Mr Beazley, a lesson in putting the national interests ahead of partisan political point scoring.</p>
<p>Speaking at a St Patrick's Day luncheon at the Lansdowne Club today, Mr Carr said "You won't find me talking down the Australian economy". In the same speech he said that the fundamentals of the Australian economy were sound.</p>
<p>This responsible approach by the New South Wales Premier is vastly different from the irresponsible attempts of the Federal Labor Leader to undermine confidence in the Australian economy by referring to the possibility of a recession.</p>
<p>Like Mr Carr, Mr Beazley is aware that the Australian economy is basically sound. He should put Australia's interests first and say so.</p>
