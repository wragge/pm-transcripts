PRIME MINISTER I np R A<br />
FOR MEDIA WEDNESDAY', 7 MAY, 1 a' LD'<br />
ADDRESS TO PACIFIC BASIN ECONOMIC COUNCIL<br />
It was weith great pleasure that I accepted your invitation to<br />
address this annual meeting of the Pacific Basin Economic<br />
Council, the theme of which is to be " The Pacific * Basin in<br />
the 80s". It is a most timely theme.<br />
As you will be well aware, the pastyear has witnessed a significant'<br />
growth of interest among individuals-, institutions and<br />
gov. ernments in the prospects of, and the need for, enhanced<br />
co-operation among the countries of-the Pacific Basin.-region.<br />
Someone, indeed, has referred to the Pacific Basin as an<br />
idea whose time has come.<br />
You, as members of an organisation which came into existence<br />
as early as the mid-1960s to foster co-operation and<br />
understanding among countries of the region, may be inclined<br />
to say, 1 " and about time too".<br />
If you are, you will have earned the right to do so, for<br />
the Pacific Basin Economic Council has been one of the<br />
trail-blazers in advancing the sense of community in the<br />
wider region.<br />
In any case, in the context of this very interest it is a<br />
particular honour for Australia to have the opportunity<br />
to act as host to representatives of other nations of the<br />
Pacific region to discuss these matters: both at this<br />
meeting of the Pacific Basin Economic Council and at<br />
the non-governmental regional seminar to be held at the<br />
Australian National University later this year.<br />
At the beginning of this century, the American Secretary of<br />
State John Hay wrote: " The Mediterranean is the ocean of the<br />
past, the Atlantic is the ocean of the present, and the Pacific<br />
is the ocean of the future". What is happening now is that we<br />
are beginning to enter that future.<br />
That we are doing so, is due to the cumulative effect of<br />
three revolutionary processes which have impacted on the<br />
region since the Second World War. / 2 </p>
<p>-2<br />
First, there was the political revolution which brought<br />
to an end the Western colonial systems which had<br />
previou~ ly been imposed like a grid on the region.<br />
That did not occur without great turmoil and the<br />
independent states which emerged were initially weak<br />
and insecure. But in a remarkably short space of time<br />
they have overcome formidable difficulties and<br />
consolidated themselves. That political revolution was<br />
a necessary precondition for the evolution of any sense<br />
of community. For as long as colonial rule remained, the<br />
attention of each colony was necessarily-directed out of<br />
the region towards its metropolitan centre, where power<br />
ultimately resided, rather than towards its neighbours.<br />
While the region freed itself of outside political control,<br />
the economic system associated with colonialism initially<br />
remained in place. Most of the new countries remained the<br />
providers of raw aterial and foodstuffs for the developed<br />
countries and the markets for their manufactured goods.<br />
But in the last two decades a second revolution an<br />
economic one has taken place which has substantially changed<br />
this. The're has been a breath-taking transformation from colonial<br />
economic-systems to export-oriented manufacturing<br />
economies, based in the first place on labour intensive<br />
_ light manufactures but increasingly on capital and skill<br />
intensive maufactures.<br />
This process is not, of course, anything like completed,<br />
throughout the region. We should keep a proper sense of<br />
proportion and remember the very considerable areas of<br />
poverty and economic backwardness which still remain.<br />
Yet, when one remembers what the condition of the region was<br />
as little as 25 years ago; when one remembers how<br />
pessimistically its prospects were assessed; when one<br />
remembers the cliches about the ' stagnation"' and<br />
" immobility" and lack of entrepreneurial-skills of Asian<br />
people who lacked the " Protestant Ethic" when one remembers<br />
these things, what stands out is the magnitude of the<br />
qualitative and quantitative changes-which occurred.<br />
Economically, we are living in a different region. The third<br />
revolution which has had a major impact on the region has<br />
been a technological revolution a revolution involving among<br />
many other things communication satellites, jet transport,<br />
computerisation, tele-printers, containerisation and<br />
super-tankers.<br />
For two reasons, this revolution has been particularly<br />
important for the Asia-Pacific region. First, because of its<br />
impact on transport and communications. The Pacific ocean<br />
covers a huge area roughly one third of the world's<br />
surface and distance has always posed formidable problems<br />
/ 3 </p>
<p>-3<br />
for those living in it and on it's rim. Technology<br />
has now solved many of these problems. Secondly, the<br />
fact that this technological revolution coincided with<br />
the industrialisation of the region meant that countries<br />
in the region were able to enjoy the advantage of the<br />
latecomer and exploit it very successfully. The<br />
visual evidence of the dynamic which has been generated<br />
by the combined impact of these three revolutions is<br />
evident throughout the Asia-Pacific region.<br />
In statistical terms, we are talking about economies which<br />
have been able to sustain G. N. P. growth rates of 6.7 and in<br />
some cases 10 per cent, as well as export growth rates<br />
of several times that order.<br />
That countries in the region-were able to achieve these<br />
growth rates during the 1970s was striking: that they<br />
were able to maintain them in the 1970s when-theinternational<br />
economywas-characterised by recession is<br />
remarkable; and that they were able to do so, in many cases,<br />
in the absence of any extensive national resource endowments<br />
is truly extraordinary, and testifies to the crucial<br />
importance of sound policies-and strong motivation in<br />
achieving economic progress.<br />
Economic growth, trade and structural change have<br />
proceeded more rapidlyin North7East and South-East Asia<br />
than in other areas of the-world economy during the last<br />
decade. The growth of Jaopan as a-ma-jar industrial power and the<br />
expanding market it has-. provided for other regional countries,<br />
as well as the industrial progress achieved by the " newly<br />
industrialising countries" ( the Republic of Korea, Taiwan,<br />
Hong Kong and Singapore) and, to a lesser extent, other<br />
ASEAN member countries, has contributed to spectacular<br />
growth and trade expansion in the region.<br />
It is worth emphasising in this context that, while resource<br />
endowments within the region are unevenly shared and while as<br />
I have said the lack of a resource base has not inhibited<br />
remarkable growth in several countries the region as a whole<br />
is nevertheless rich in resources.<br />
It contains five of the world's major food exporters<br />
Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Thailand and the United States.<br />
These same countries plus Indonesia, Malaysia and the<br />
Phillipines produce between them most industrial raw<br />
materials.<br />
* As apercentage of the world market economies' total<br />
production, the region produces 49% of copper, 54% of lead,<br />
of nickel, 69% of tin and 60% of iron ore, with<br />
significant percentages of many other minerals. </p>
<p>4<br />
Moreover, the Chinese modernisation program offers the<br />
possibility of new opportunities emerging for other<br />
regional countries in that market in the future.<br />
Such developments have led to forecasts that there may be<br />
a progressive tilt in the world economic centre of gravity<br />
away from the Atlantic/ Europe region towards Asia and the<br />
Pacific in future.<br />
Substance is lent to this by the fact that in 1978, United<br />
States trade with the West Pacific exceeded total trade<br />
with West and East Europe for the first time in its<br />
history. These extraordinary growth achievements have been paralleled<br />
-by incrcacing-economic interdependence.<br />
The-value -of total tra-among the market economies of<br />
0--the-West and Noroth-East. Pacific increased from $ US29 billion<br />
in 1965 to $ US173 billion in 1977 an astonishing growth,<br />
even allowing for inflation.<br />
For-all r-egional countries, except the United States and<br />
Japan, more than half their trade is with other countries<br />
within the region and for most the proportion is much<br />
higher.<br />
-Near-ly half of Japan's trade is intra-regional.<br />
In the case of the United States, as I have noted already,<br />
with the Pacific is assuming an increasing<br />
imnnrt-ance.<br />
A similar pattern of interdependence has emerged in the<br />
investment field and countries of the Pacific, with the<br />
exception of the United States, are doing most of their<br />
investment within the region.<br />
And even with the United States, investment in the Pacific<br />
region, while not great in absolute terms, is nonetheless<br />
substantial. In addition to this economic and investment interdependence<br />
there are the effects of the declaration of economic zones<br />
by many coastal states in the Pacific. These declarations<br />
have accompanying obligations, with certain conditions, to share<br />
the resources within such zones.<br />
For our own part, a substantial number of Australia's more<br />
important bilateral relationships are with countries of<br />
the Pacific region. These have grown considerably over<br />
the last fifteen years.<br />
Parallel to these developments, Australia has sought to develop<br />
closer political relationships with the countries of the<br />
Pacific region both bilaterally and through multilateral<br />
channels such as ESCAP, the Asian Development Bank and<br />
the South Pacific Forum. </p>
<p>Our businessmen, of course, have also played an active<br />
role within the Pacific Basic Economic Council since its<br />
inception. The upshot of these developments is very<br />
significant.<br />
What they indicate, in the simplest terms, is that for the<br />
countries of the West and North East Pacific, including<br />
Australia, their economic relationships with each other<br />
are assuming a very great importance and that economic<br />
importance and that economic interdependence within the<br />
region is now extensive.<br />
A principal rationale advanced by proponents of a Pacific<br />
community is that this state of affairs is not<br />
adequately reflected in the existence of regional institutions<br />
and arrangements at present and that it should-. be..<br />
On_ the-one-hand,--it. is -maintained that market. forces. andtraditional<br />
bilateral arrangements are no longer. adequate,.<br />
given the complexity of the relationships and the need for<br />
a regional. focus in dealing with issues emerging from<br />
growing regional interdependence.<br />
On the other hand, i~ t is pointed out that existing<br />
international economic institutions are to some extent<br />
Atlantic-centred and were originally created primarily<br />
to cope with the needs of the economies of that regionnot<br />
of the Pacific Basin.<br />
-While they have subsequently been adapted to meet changes<br />
. athe. inter-national -sys-tem, some would argue. that. theystill<br />
reflect their origins to some-extent.<br />
In terms of its progress, it is claimed that the Pacific<br />
reg-ion-is institutionally under-developed. What institutions<br />
there are, are not, in terms of history, membership,<br />
resources or.. character seen as adequate for handling theopportunities<br />
and problems created by the quite dramatic<br />
changes which are occurring.<br />
Just as the Atlantic countries have created a range of<br />
institutions designed to serve their interests, it is argued,<br />
so the dynamic and interdependent countries of the Pacific<br />
must now make the same effort.<br />
Not only is-this required, but, as a consequence of the<br />
revolution in communication and transport, it is now feasible<br />
in a way in which it was not, even a decade or two ago.<br />
The central purposesenvisaged for a Pacific community<br />
arrangement flow from this rationale. They are: to foster<br />
closer links and greater co-operation between states which<br />
have an increasingly large volume of economic transactions<br />
with each other; to assist the effective management of<br />
increasing economic interdependence, bearing, in mind that / 6 </p>
<p>6<br />
such interdependence brings with it the possibility of<br />
increased friction as well as new opportunities; and<br />
to foster the continuing economic dynamism of the region<br />
by encouraging greater rationalisation within it, based<br />
on the principle of comparative advantage.<br />
It has also been urged that the aims should extend beyond<br />
that into co-operation in the social and cultural field,<br />
involving greater exchanges of people, research and<br />
related matters.<br />
This is seen as an important means of promoting greater<br />
mutual understanding in a region which, over the centuries,<br />
has been characterised by wide differences from one country<br />
to another.<br />
But it should be stressed that the basic motivation supporting<br />
the--onceprt is-clearly quie diff erent-from that which led<br />
to earl-i-er-efforts at-regional--o--erperation, when political<br />
and strategic security considerations dominated.<br />
As to the institutional form such a new grouping might<br />
take, many different ideas have been floated, not all of them<br />
mutually exclusive.<br />
Dr. Peter Drysdale of the Australian National University<br />
and Professor Hugh Patrick of Yale have proposed an organisation<br />
for Pacific-Trade and DevelopmCht ( OPTAD) in connection with<br />
recent United States Congressional hearings.<br />
it-i-o-spo~ i-iiity -xni~ gh 1rurt of scaled down<br />
OECD to facilitate consultation and to collect, analyse and<br />
disseminate economic information.<br />
Other ideas include a loose arrangement of over-lapping<br />
functional groups, perhaps with variable membership, and a<br />
-Pacific pr of Ieads-of-Government-r-lin-sters along the<br />
model of the Commonwealth.<br />
There is also the difficulty of determining membership. The<br />
Pacific region encompasses a large number of states.<br />
They include super powers and mini-states: the most developed<br />
countries in the world and some of the least developed: countries<br />
committed to the market economy and countries dedicated to<br />
comprehensive central planning: countries with widely differing<br />
ideologies and cultures.<br />
Not all the countries of the region hold entirely friendly<br />
feelings for each other. There are special cases like Taiwan,<br />
and perhaps Hong Kong, to consider.<br />
And again, although most of the interest in the concept so<br />
far has come from the West and North East Pacific, there are<br />
the ten Latin American countries which border on the Pacific<br />
-to be tak-n into account, althoug-so far they-have had a<br />
limited interaction with countries on this side of the ocean. / 7 </p>
<p>-7<br />
There are, therefore, formidable problems about prospective<br />
membership about how literally the phrase " Pacific Basin"<br />
should be taken and how widely any arrangement should<br />
cast its net.<br />
And there are other difficulties: of ensuring that the<br />
interests and development of existing sub-regional organisations<br />
such as ASEAN and the South Pacific Forum are not undermined<br />
and that any wider arrangement will be mutually advantageous<br />
and will not put the progress of those valuable institutions<br />
at risk; of ensuring that any steps taken would not result<br />
in an inward-turning community which would weaken the<br />
commitment of countries within the region, including Australia,<br />
to a liberal international economic system; of accommodating<br />
the economic super powers without creating something which<br />
will simply be their instrument and of ensuring that any<br />
new regional grouping does not just become another " rich<br />
man's club"-; and of avoiding the creation of a large,<br />
expensive bureaucracy-which might be intrusive and<br />
meddlesome, if only to justify its existence.<br />
Taken together these difficulties are formidable. But<br />
the existence of difficulties is not in itself a<br />
justification for resignation or inaction otherwise we<br />
would still be decorating the walls of our caves.<br />
Any large and ima ginative enterprise will give rise to<br />
the kinds of difficulties I have referred to and they must<br />
always be balanced against the advantages which would flow<br />
from its implementation. </p>
<p>8-<br />
The dogmatists on both sides of the argument will claim to know<br />
in advance what the outcome of such a balancing will be: for the<br />
rest of us it is something to be examined and thought about.<br />
That is why Australia, in its intial response to the proposal,<br />
has put its emphasis firmly on the need for a thorough, extended<br />
examination of the concept.<br />
We are positive about tLhe need for such an examination and at this<br />
stage cautious bat hopeful about its outcome.<br />
This attitude is justified by at least four considerations.<br />
First the complexity of the issues raised by the concept and the<br />
lack of precision and detail which so far characterises it warrant<br />
caution. Second, the fact that nearly all our major foreign<br />
policy interests and a preponderance of our important trading<br />
interests fall within the Pacific region means that much is at<br />
stake and that we must proceed with caution. Third, and despite<br />
this preponderance, Australia is a world trader and we must be<br />
sure-that any arrangement which is proposed-will not restrictus<br />
in this respect. And fourth, because we already enjoy fruitful*<br />
bilateral dealings with other countries of the region and participate<br />
in a numrberof regional institutions, we need to consider<br />
carefully whether these existing arrangements are inadequate to<br />
our current needs or incapable of adaptation, before entering<br />
into new commitments.<br />
In short, Australia, along-with every-e-&amp; country involved,-<br />
will have to determine whether the benefits for it would outweigh<br />
the_ costs and obviously there would be costs.<br />
But our approach to this task and to the concept itself<br />
should be a positive and sympathetic one. It is not a matter of<br />
simply sitting back sceptically and saying, ' convince but<br />
of actively participating along with other countries of the region,<br />
in the examination, testing and shaping of the concept.<br />
We recognise also that a number of other countries, for varying<br />
reasons, are cautious about the idea and that some have expressed<br />
concern about the possible side-effects of a wider regional<br />
arrangement. It is all the more important, therefore, that we proceed<br />
carefully and seek to arrive at a broad regional consensus.<br />
It was against this background that during Prime Minister Ohira' s<br />
visit to Australia earlier this year, we agreed that a series of<br />
non-governmental seminars held at academic or similar institutions<br />
within the region, over a period of years, would offer an<br />
important means of exploring the concept in depth.<br />
As a step in this direction, Australia agreed to sponsor such a<br />
seminar at the Australian National University, under the direction<br />
of Sir John Crawford. Since then, we have been delighted by the<br />
interest that has been shown in participating at this meeting.<br />
In opting for a thorough examination of the concept of a Pacific<br />
community, we should not delude ourselves that this process will<br />
resolve all difficulties or remove all obstacles. You as.<br />
businessmen, and I as a politician, know that in any worthwhile<br />
enterprise an irreducible element of uncertainty will always<br />
remain. </p>
<p>9<br />
There is no such thing as a risk-free initiative.<br />
But it is as well to remember that in some situations the<br />
most risky course is to do nothing.<br />
Mr Chairman, I spoke earlier of three revolutions which had impacted<br />
on the Asia-Pacific region in recent decades the political,<br />
the economic and the technological.<br />
For the Pacific community to become a reality rather than a<br />
very partially realised aspiration-a fourth revolution would have<br />
to take place: a psychological one.<br />
We would have to think differently and feel differently.<br />
If we are not to be overtaken by events if objective changes<br />
are not to outrun subjective ones this process will have to<br />
proceed. I am not suggesting that in itself this will be enough,<br />
but it is a necessary condition for progress.<br />
I believe that in an unsensational but sustained way, this Council,<br />
along with other regional organisations, is making an important<br />
contribution to this quiet revolution. </p>
