FOR PRESS P. M. No. 21/ 1971<br />
RESPONSIBILITY FOR ABCRIGINES<br />
The Prime Minister, Mr. John Gorton, today made<br />
the following comment on reported remarks by the Premier of<br />
Queensland about aborigines in that State<br />
" The Commonwealth, and not the States, has the<br />
paramount responsibility for aborigines, as a result of<br />
a decision made by Australian electors at a referendum.<br />
The MVinister for Aboriginal ANairs has been<br />
working closely with State Governments and leaving<br />
the administration of policies to the States. But it<br />
still remains a Commonwealth duty and responsibility<br />
to ensure that discriminatory racial laws do not persist<br />
in Australia."<br />
CANBERRA 19 February 1971 </p>
