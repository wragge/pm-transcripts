TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P. J. KEATING MP<br />
INTERVIEW WITH ANGELA CATTERNS, TRIPLE J, 10 MAY 1995<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
AC: Welcome to Triple J.<br />
PM: Thank you Angela. I have been before, but not here.<br />
AC: Not to Triple J central.<br />
PM: Not to Triple J central.<br />
AC: Are you pleased with the way this Budget has gone down.<br />
PM: Exceptionally. I think what pleases me about it is that it confirms that<br />
we can continue growing through the 1990s. That is what the whole<br />
thing was about sustaining the _. grQ~ wth and sustaining the<br />
employment growth. We have had this amazingly high level of<br />
employment growth'in the last year, four per cent, and we want to try to<br />
keep those sorts of levels running through the rest of the 1990s. But,<br />
we had to reduce the Government's call on what is called our savings.<br />
And that means we have got to take the-. Budget from deficit into<br />
surplus, so we are adding to savings, not subtracting from them to<br />
kee p the growth going. That is what basically we did last night and the<br />
other thing we did was we put into it the first ever comprehensive<br />
savings plan for Australians. So, this will be the first generation, your<br />
audience will be the first generation of Australians in our history who<br />
will have security right through, that is economic security, right through<br />
their working lives and beyond.<br />
AC: This audience would possibly say to you that why should they be<br />
forced to put money away for their old age when the oldies around<br />
today didn't have to do that.<br />
PM: Well, the difference will be that they will have an income twice, as you<br />
put it, the oldies today have got. So, it means that they will be the first<br />
generation ever that won't have to say ' well, what will I do later?' </p>
<p>When you are in your teens or twenties, the last thing you think about<br />
is your retirement.<br />
AC: Absolutely.<br />
PM: But, that all changes by about your mid 30s and you start saying ' well,<br />
you know, I am 20 years away from retirement, what am I going to do?'<br />
Last night that was all pretty much decided that is, by this great<br />
change, as I say, for the first time ever you will have people, well if you<br />
take someone on average weekly earnings that is about now $ 33,000.<br />
At the end of their working life they will have a lump sum of just on half<br />
a million which will give them $ 30,000 a year for going out into the<br />
future. So, it is a very great change.<br />
AC: Although, I wouldn't agree that necessarily young people see the<br />
advantage of that right now. I'm sure that they would rather enjoy the<br />
benefits of tax cuts now, for instance, rather than having to wait until<br />
they are 60 when they can finally kick up their heels.<br />
PM: Well, again we had the tax cuts, the first round, at the end 1993, but<br />
the main thing to know is that this is a very lightly taxed country. This<br />
is the second lowest taxed country in the western world, but again the<br />
things that matter in this Buge o ntne i dcto hc<br />
matters to your audience, we have got $ 16 and a half billion over the<br />
period 1996 to 1998, we have got another 11,000 new places in<br />
universities in Queensland and NSW and Western Australia by 1998<br />
and that is on top of the massive funding we have got in TAFE,<br />
technical and further education.<br />
AC: Students do seem finally quite happy with you, would you agree their<br />
protests worked in spite of you telling them to go get a job?<br />
PM: No, no because we were never going to put up-front fees for<br />
undergraduates. I mean John Howard, my opponent, he believes in<br />
up front fees. He says if you can' t ' pay for it, you take the incentive out<br />
of things. You have got to give people the incentive so therefore you<br />
have full fees. Now, we have always said, I made that clear at the<br />
time, I mean, at the time I made the remark you just referred to I had<br />
someone walking beside me for about 500 metres yelling abuse at me<br />
about HECS. I said ' well, hang on, all the HECS ' money is going back<br />
into places. We have had a 37 per cent increase'-in places, we have<br />
gone from 360,000 to 550,000 university places all with the HECS<br />
money going back in and we only ask you to pay some of it back when<br />
you get to average weekly earnings'. So, that is why I was saying to<br />
somebody ' if you don't want to pay your HECS, give it to someone else<br />
who does.' But, the big beef was erroneously that the Government<br />
was about to introduce up front fees. So, the Budget has come and<br />
gone, there is no up front fees for undergraduates, there is no increase<br />
in the size of each students HECS debt and the repayment of HECS<br />
still doesn't begin until the student hits average weekly earnings. So, </p>
<p>I'm afraid it was a kafuffle for nothing. That was the point I was trying<br />
to make at the time.<br />
AC: Mr Keating, you mentioned unemployment, but there still seems to be<br />
an awful lot of people still unemployed. How can you cut Working<br />
Nation by more than $ 1 billion?<br />
PM: That was about $ 200 million odd a year, we put in about $ 1.6 billion,<br />
so we are cutting that money from $ 1.6 billion a year. The answer very<br />
simply Angela is we have had such great success with employment.<br />
Last year long term unemployment which Working Nation is directed<br />
at, that is for people unemployed 12 months or more, dropped by<br />
102,000. When we had the election just over two years ago we had<br />
360,000 long term unemployed people, this year we have got 260,000<br />
a huge fall and because that category of persons has changed so<br />
much we just don't need the funding we had there, but it doesn't<br />
reduce the target. The target is five per cent unemployment by the<br />
Year 2000 and you might remember at the election we had 10.5 per<br />
cent unemployment, we are now at 8.7 per cent and in the Budget we<br />
are forecasting 8 per cent. So, we are, if you like, half the way to 5 per<br />
cent in less than half the time.<br />
AC: Mr Keating, how will you try and reduce youth suicide?<br />
PM Well, I think, this is a big issue and I think we all understand and feel<br />
deeply about it. I think the best thing that government's can do, I'm not<br />
sure that government is the ultimate answer on youth suicide. I think it<br />
is a phenomenon of personal debilitation and de~ i-i -thfink it needs<br />
families, it needs the support of friends, I think those things matter<br />
more than anything a government can do. But what governments can<br />
do is provide opportunities for training and employment, to give young<br />
people a very clear future, the fact that they have confidence, that they<br />
can get a job and an interesting job and be trained, we can provide<br />
support through the social safety net which, of course, this<br />
Government has championed. In things like Working Nation we can<br />
support people with labour market programs to get them trained and<br />
back into work. Through Creative Nations to see them do interesting<br />
things, through funding for TAFE to find these interesting programs<br />
being opened up to them. In the Youth Training Initiative in One<br />
Nation we are taking young people now in years 11 6nd 12 and<br />
streaming them already into TAFE courses, into accreditation in TAFE.<br />
In One Nation we said we won't let any young person between 15 and<br />
19 slip through the system without case managing them, talking to<br />
them and getting them back into education or structured training or a<br />
job. So, I think that sort of Government support matters. I think case<br />
management, the thing we did in One Nation. Let me just tell you<br />
listeners about case management and what it means. It means that<br />
somebody like you would talk personally to 30 or 40 people, you get to<br />
know about their personalities, their aptitudes, their readiness for a<br />
job, their educational attainments, their previous work experience and </p>
<p>then you deliver to them the labour market program, the job subsidy or<br />
the training. In other words, they just don't turn up to a CES. counter<br />
and get the brush off or a social security counter and get the brush off<br />
and go back in despair. They actually have somebody interested in<br />
them. That is what Working Nation did and, I think, they are the sort of<br />
programs we can help with, but I don't think that is the full answer. I<br />
think it has to be as well, I mean opportunity, a brighter horizon,<br />
interest by government, the community saying you are important and<br />
we want to help you, that we are not going to let you slip through the<br />
system, but they must have families and friends. I think there is a lot of<br />
loneliness with many young people today that we are not getting this, if<br />
you like, clannishness and I still actually think the family and that<br />
environment is the best support system for any of us.<br />
AC: And their radio station helps too, I might put in bit of a plug there. Mr<br />
Keating, can you understand the cynicism of young people towards<br />
politicians?<br />
PM: Not really. No, I can't because the political system has in this country<br />
made changes you could never have dreamt of 10 years ago. Ten<br />
years ago, I mean look, let me just say this, we ran the risk of drifting<br />
into the 21st century with the hang overs; from the 19th century. The<br />
Queen, the great lie about terra nullius the land of no one that<br />
Aboriginal people had no rights, had no property, the sort of values of<br />
the 1950s, John Howard's dead end jobs. ' You know, in my day' he<br />
said ' they could get a job at 15'. Well, yes, they could, but it was a<br />
dead end job with low pay. This was the sort of attitude we had in a<br />
closed country ringed by tariffs. Look at what we have got today. In<br />
years we have seen ' such a dramatic change. It is now an<br />
externally orientated country, it is trading with Asia. Ten years ago<br />
only three young people in ten completed secondary school. This year<br />
it is nearly nine in ten. And 40 per cent of those are being streamed<br />
through universities where we have added 60 per cent of places. This<br />
Government has created the equivalent of 18 universities the size of<br />
Sydney and Melbourne university since 1985/ 86.<br />
Now, that kind of change trained with interesting jobs, in a society<br />
which is confident about its culture, which is coming to terms with its<br />
indigenes, which is engaging Asia, the political system has done this.<br />
This Government has done this.<br />
AC: And you think young people should be grateful rather than cynical?<br />
PM: No, not grateful, but you asked me why should they be cynical and I<br />
said I can't understand it. I mean, in my day I started work at 15 years<br />
of age as a clerk and all I had to look forward to was night school for<br />
my higher school certificate and then if my parents could afford it to go<br />
through university. There was really no TAFE system. I mean, look at </p>
<p>the opportunities for young people today. As I say an 80 per cent<br />
retention rate in years 11 and 12 and when John Howard left the<br />
government to me it was three in ten. Only three young people in ten<br />
completed secondary school in 1983. That is now eight and a half in<br />
ten going on to nine. So, why should I accept the argument that<br />
people have got a right to be cynical about politics.<br />
AC: Well, the youth suicide figures certainly speak for themselves.<br />
PM: I know, but what about all the young people who have got interesting<br />
jobs, that are taking up these places in the labour market. I mean, I<br />
think this generation is fantastic, the young generati~ n. The vitality,<br />
the verve, the vigour, the confidence, I think you are right, there is this<br />
sort of sliver or slice of concern alienation of what should we say,<br />
despair et cetera. But, look at the ones who are actually out there into<br />
it. I mean, the confidence of young people today in their teens, in their<br />
early 20s compared to my time is just not to be compared. I got into<br />
the House of Representatives when I was 25. 1 won the preselection<br />
for one of the safest seats in Australia at 24, it was just a purgatory.<br />
Where today the system is wide open for them.<br />
AC: John Howard is taking young Australians very seriously, he has<br />
actually promised a youth ministry and a minister that is part of the<br />
Cabinet.<br />
PM: Yes and he has also promised people $ 3 an hour for work. I mean,<br />
that is John Howard for you.<br />
AC: What do you think of his idea of a youth minister?<br />
PM: Let me say, what John Howard would give you is the Queen, we would<br />
have none of the truth of Mabo, we would have none of our pulling our<br />
national culture together, our sense of ourselves, there would be no<br />
way we would engage Asia, he would have us with only three young<br />
people in ten completing secondary school, he would have full up front<br />
fees for universities, he would have $ 3 an hour. That is what he would<br />
have and if he wants to hand out the sort of, what you may think the<br />
sop of a ministry, all we say is don't be so gullible.<br />
AC: You think that is a folly, the idea of a youth ministry and a youth<br />
minister?<br />
PM: No, because you are better to do the things that really matter. I mean,<br />
it is not the youth ministry that has created that massive participation<br />
rate in schools. It is not the youth ministry that has got for the first time<br />
young women taking the predominant number of places in Australian<br />
universities, it is the edujcation. policy of the Government. This, if you<br />
like, trying to tokenise things and particularly for people who have<br />
shown, I mean, how could you when you when Howard was the<br />
Federal Treasurer of Australia for five years and the leading member </p>
<p>of a government, ieave office with only three young people in ten<br />
completing secondary school. Seven in ten essentially going out to a<br />
changing labour market untrained and then have the temerity to turn<br />
up and so ' oh, yes, I will give them a youth ministry.'<br />
AC: Mr Keating, how do you think your vision for young Australians differs~,<br />
from that of the Liberals?<br />
PM: I believe in the zing and zest and creativity of Australia. I believe in us<br />
having an independent culture, a destiny of our own. I said in the last<br />
election campaign it is always, with the Liberals, a contest between the<br />
enlarges of life and the straighteners. John Howard and the Liberals<br />
belong with the straighteners. You know, keep your head down, keep<br />
working, don't answer back. Whereas my Party, what we believe in is<br />
something bigger in life. Something better. If you give people a<br />
chance, if you give them the opportunity, if you believe in them, if you<br />
have faith in them, they will do better. Now, that is the essential<br />
difference and you can't have the sort of straighteners view of the<br />
world and believe in knighthoods and queens and European enclaves<br />
and all the rest of it and they say ' oh, just by the way, we are really the<br />
future'. I mean, as we always say in Canberra with John Howard it is<br />
back to the future.<br />
AC: Mr Keating, do you think young Australians though are more<br />
concerned do you know about interest rates than they are about the<br />
big issues?<br />
PM: No, I don't think so. I think they are concerned properly with the things<br />
that matter. They are concerned with the country's values. They are<br />
concerned with their own values. They are concerned with their<br />
creativity, with their education. They are concerned about the<br />
environment. They are concerned about the nature of society, whether<br />
we care for one another. I mean, one of the things I admire about<br />
young people is they don't take the half hearted view, they actually<br />
believe in inclusion. They believe in us going ahead together. They<br />
are not saying survival of the fittest and devil take the hind most they<br />
actually believe in inclusion and so do I. I mean, we are standing up,<br />
Ralph Willis was standing up last night with a Budget which didn't rip<br />
the guts out of payments to schools, payments to universities,<br />
payments to TAFE, payments to families, payments to low income<br />
families because we don't believe in those things.<br />
AC: Have you got time to take some calls, to talk to some listeners, would<br />
you mind putting the head phones on?<br />
PM: I'd be delighted to.<br />
C: Annita. Good morning Mr Keating, I would just like to ask you, you<br />
were talking about sustaining growth before and I was wondering how<br />
sustainable is the Australian economy going to be if governments keep </p>
<p>on selling off all our public utilities when it comes up to election time<br />
rather than cut spending?<br />
PM: Well, Annita they are not the things that are sustained. What is<br />
sustained is the capacity of the country to invest. That is, when the<br />
business community go to the market to put Australian savings into<br />
investments which create jobs, those savings should not be there with<br />
a perpetual drain from the public sector. That is what makes the<br />
growth sustained. The growth comes from investment and only from<br />
investment. So, what we did last night was to stop ' the public sector<br />
drain or the public sector call on Australian savings by getting the<br />
Budget back into surplus.<br />
C: It still seems to be a quick fix method.<br />
PM: No, it is not a quick fix, no, no. This is a completely sustainable<br />
change so the Budget will now be back into surplus through the<br />
balance of the 1990s. Now, there are some asset sales in there, that<br />
is what you were talking about, I think, but the Commonwealth buys<br />
assets all the time and it also sells assets. That is not changing the<br />
fiscal or budget picture. The budget picture is one of a structural<br />
change which is seeing the budget back into surplus which means<br />
those investment funds are going to be there for the jobs that keep the<br />
growth going. And what the Treasury did in its forecast yesterday was<br />
say that we will have now sustainable growth over the next three years<br />
and we have already had it over the last three years. So, it does<br />
mean, I think, there is more than a lot of hope in these documents,<br />
there is a lot of concrete evidence that we are going to basically be a<br />
relatively high growth, high employment society through the balance of<br />
the 1990s.<br />
C: Dave from Alice Springs. I am a registered nurse in Alice Springs<br />
here. Now, you have allocated in the Budget pnrnar-y h ' ealtli care<br />
million. In my opinion that is still fairly low, it is less than $ 5 per capita.<br />
PM: Are you talking here for Aboriginal people are you?<br />
C: Well, my wife is Aboriginal, but apart from that overall in Australia it<br />
still seems to me that we are still working towards treatment services in<br />
the health care system, tertiary and secondary treatment, rather than<br />
aiming at primary health care to try to reduce that further down the<br />
line.<br />
PM: I think we are doing both. I think early diagnosis, understanding better<br />
health and better well being, less reliance upon, if you like<br />
pharmaceuticals, less reliance upon expensive diagnosis, diagnostic<br />
imaging and pathology and these things. I mean, I think Australians<br />
have generally taken this message on board. I mean, there is much<br />
more today healthier lifestyles, you can see that in the change in<br />
cardiac disease, I mean that lesson has been picked up and I think we </p>
<p>are generally supporting that. And, also part of these programs we<br />
have basically tried to inculcate the medical profession and GPs in<br />
looking at, if you like, better practice in their own practices is about<br />
meeting your point.<br />
C: I quite agree with that, but certainly I still feel we are not really<br />
attacking the issue of primary health care especially in line of<br />
agreements we have signed with the ULN and also in line with things<br />
such as the food and nutrition policy which your government<br />
developed in August 1992 which is up for review this year which aims<br />
at making healthy food choices easier. Now a lot of the communities<br />
that I go out to, that is not happening because of the problems with<br />
transport costs and so on because of particular store keepers, those<br />
sorts of issues are not being addressed and certainly vegetables are<br />
not an alternative out there because they can't afford them.<br />
PM: They can't get them. I know that and the other thing is that we do have<br />
to, I think, when I was up recently at Hopevale and Cape York, one of<br />
the lessons from the Cape York Health Council was that the Aboriginal<br />
communities themselves need to be part of the strategy. There is no<br />
way a government can wave a magic wand and decide what an<br />
Aboriginal person will feed to their children that morning or feed<br />
herself or her family. They have to be involved in it to. I think we want<br />
to approach Aboriginal health care on that basis. That is,<br />
environmental health, better water, better sewerage, better drainage,<br />
better housing and direct health, primary health, better services,<br />
pharmaceuticals, better diagnosis and, as you say better diet, better<br />
hygiene. It is a group thing, it is not something the government can<br />
do, it is something we have got to do with Aboriginal communities.<br />
C: Renee. I'd like to raise a question about HECS. I was really glad to<br />
see that there has been some attention to the private students with<br />
something like 72 per cent still living below the poverty line. But, I'd<br />
also like to point out that within universities if you get out there and talk<br />
to the students you will find that many of them are radically dissatisfied<br />
with the quality of the education they are receiving and I'd like to know<br />
why it is that our HECS can't be spent directly on education.<br />
PM: Well, it is. All the HECS revenue, that is every dollar of it is ploughed<br />
straight back into higher education. As a consequence HECS revenue<br />
has allowed for a 37 per cent increase in places since 1988. So, we<br />
have got roughly 600,000 people in universities 240,000 of those<br />
people are there only because of HECS. So, in other words, if we<br />
want the bigger participation, can I just make this point to you, there is<br />
not much point the Government saying to young people ' stay in year<br />
11 and 12 and when you qualify, sorry, there isn't a place for you'. So,<br />
we have added this enormous number of places to the system 60 per<br />
cent but 37 per cent since 1988. The reason we have been able to<br />
keep up the high growth in university places is through HECS. All of<br />
the HECS proceeds go back. I mean, there is this sort of notion </p>
<p>around that it goes to the Government. It doesn't. It all goes back into<br />
higher education and as I say, we only ask people to repay it when<br />
they join the workforce, after they have graduated and their income<br />
goes up to average weekly earnings. It is only then that in the tax<br />
system that it starts to be repaid. So, it is the fairest thing you can<br />
imagine and that is why a lot of other countries are now coming to<br />
Australia to look at it, to think about adopting it themselves.<br />
Remember this, I think this is also important to know, that HECS only<br />
covers 20 per cent of the cost of the education, roughly 20 per cent of<br />
a university degree is covered by HECS.<br />
C: And so you are saying that all of our HECS goes directly into the<br />
education budget?<br />
PM: The lot, every dollar. Nothing goes to the budget.<br />
AC: Mr Keating a fax came this morning, it has an interesting question for<br />
you. You were quoted in The Age on the second of March as saying<br />
access to the national information infrastructure should be no less a<br />
right than water, public transport or electricity. Is there any money in<br />
the Budget to fund access for everyone to the Internet through the<br />
public library system?<br />
PM: Well, we are extending through Creative. Nation, we are extending<br />
access to multi media including through the Internet and we are<br />
looking in the first instance at schools and such institutions as public<br />
libraries. But, of course, the great access will come with the roll out of<br />
the cable, that is the fibre optic cable. You know this<br />
Telecom/ Newslimited venture is rolling out the cable which will be<br />
largely paid for by pay television, but it will then be the telephony<br />
revenues that will also help to pay for it. Now, once you have that<br />
piece of glass under your front door you are then connected to the rest<br />
of the world and that is basically going to be the great liberator. And,<br />
that we are trying to do in a sensible way and you have got Optus<br />
Vision which is also there and it will be competing with Telecom to get<br />
your attention and for you to pick their piece of glass rather than some<br />
one else's. So, I think that is how it is going to happen, but you are<br />
asking me a question about the priority. The priority in our view has to<br />
be for the educational institutions and for the dissemination of<br />
information, but that is going to go way beyond that to everyone's<br />
personal computer.<br />
AC: Are you on the Internet?<br />
PM: No, my office is on Internet.<br />
AC: Have you got an Email address? Bill Clinton does. </p>
<p>PM: Yes, we have an Email address. We are just getting a bank of stuff to<br />
go on. I mean, Bill Clinton has something on there about his cat or his<br />
dog or something.<br />
AC: Well, you have got a dog haven't you?<br />
PM: We have a dog, but we haven't got him on the Internet.<br />
AC: Mr Keating, can I throw you a few hypotheticals?<br />
PM: Sure.<br />
AC: Apart from yourself, obviously, who would you like to see as next PM<br />
of Australia?<br />
PM: Well, someone who has faith in the country's identity and culture. That<br />
is, someone who is a believer. Someone who believes in Australians<br />
and can take the nourishment they all provide to make the country<br />
stronger and greater and not somebody who is harking back to the<br />
1950s and someone, if you like, excepting the leadership of any other<br />
society. So, that is who I believe should be next Prime Minister of<br />
Australia somebody who has those core believes. That is, faith in<br />
Australians, faith in what we have become, confident about what we<br />
have become as a nation and able to advance it at home and abroad<br />
and not to be, sort of, picking up any derivative culture.<br />
AC: Do any names spring to mind?<br />
PM: Well, in my Party, there is a clutch of people. There is and I have<br />
mentioned them before and I am happy to mention again, Gareth<br />
Evans, Kim Beazley, Carmen Lawrence, Simon Crean, Michael Lee,<br />
Michael Lavarch, Laurie Brereton. You can look at all these<br />
contributors to our Cabinet, all of them in various ways could handle<br />
that leadership role. And, of course, some of them have, you see<br />
Simon has done it with the ACTU. Gareth has done it with his great<br />
stewardship of foreign policy. Kim has done it in major policy areas<br />
and now as Minister for Finance. Ralph Willis who has been an<br />
outstanding Minister and Treasurer.<br />
AC: Which other country of the world would you like to be Prime Minister of<br />
given the chance?<br />
PM: None. I mean, I think this is the only nation in the world that has a<br />
continent to itself. We don't share a border with anybody. We have<br />
got this great old country, this is one of the oldest parts of the world's<br />
crust and the age of Australia and the colour of Australia and the light<br />
of Australia and the flora and fauna of Australia are something, I think,<br />
if you are born with you get to love and to appreciate and once one<br />
has picked up the resonances of Australia, to go back to the old<br />
societies of Europe, the old tribal wars, the old problems of Bosnia's et </p>
<p>cetera, or even the difficulties of North America, I mean Australia is<br />
now such a country of opportunity and such a great spirit of inclusion.<br />
You know, this is still a kind society, this is not a winner take all<br />
society. This is not a dog eat dog society. So, it is the values, the<br />
landscape and this great opportunity. For the first time ever we are<br />
living near the fastest growing markets in the world. Always they were<br />
in Europe or North America. Now they are in Asia, right on our<br />
doorstep so Australia picks itself out. I mean, I happen to be the Prime<br />
Minister of Australia, but if I had had a choice it would have been this<br />
country because, in a sense, it picks itself out.<br />
AC: Who do you look up to, everybody looks up to somebody, who do you<br />
look up to Mr Keating?<br />
PM: Well, I think, there are people I admire and I look up to, but they are<br />
all, in a sense, they are not public names, they are all unremarkable in<br />
that sense, but they are quite remarkably personally.<br />
AC: Who?<br />
PM: Well, they are just people I know. Friends of mine, people who I think<br />
have got good values, have shown great fidelity to, if you like I think,<br />
core values, good principles. In my political life the two people in my<br />
younger political life that I was interested in were Franklin Roosevelt<br />
and Winst ' on-Churchill. One was a great builder, the other a great<br />
adventurer and both great leaders. But, as life goes on and your set of<br />
problems become complex and overwhelming the role models tend to<br />
drop away because all of a sudden the role has changed and it keeps<br />
on changing. So, I think, it is not a case of looking to people, but<br />
looking to experiences, but being sustained by the joy of knowing<br />
people who have got value and substance. I think that is the point, I<br />
mean, all my friends, people if you like who nourish me, are names<br />
that most people wouldn't know.<br />
AC: Could you, given that this is radio after all, describe to the listeners<br />
what you are wearing? Is it an Armani suit?<br />
PM: No, I'm not sure what it is. I think it is a Zegna suit, what I normally<br />
wear, they cut, but I'm sure of this. I know one thing for sure, the wool<br />
came from Yass.<br />
AC: Did it now?<br />
PM: Yass, because this is where the superfine wool comes from and this<br />
again is another point. Here we are with this tremendous industry<br />
where we are almost alone, we have a monopoly on this particular<br />
fibre and I just hope that fashion, we have got to be selling creativity, I<br />
think, all the things that we need to do are to sell. Whether it is film<br />
and television or clothing or fashion. I mean this is the thing to be in<br />
selling our brains. </p>
<p>AC: Ironic though that we probably export the wool to be<br />
PM: But we are doing better now. We are now starting to make the fabrics<br />
here, we are changing.<br />
AC: Mr Keating, we have got 50 seconds. What finally made you come on<br />
Triple J today?<br />
PM: I think it is important, I mean, we had a debate, for instance, we had a<br />
few questions, a debate about HECS and up front student fees, it is<br />
important to say we were never going to do those, there is no change<br />
to the size of each students HECS debt et cetera. It is important, I<br />
think, to say what the Budget means for young Australians and to<br />
make the point I made right at the opening. This will be the first<br />
generation of young Australians who won't have to worry about the<br />
security in the latter part of their lives. They might say ' oh yes' but<br />
they'll know that this is something of value to them. So, I've got the<br />
chance to come and say this and to talk to you so why not take it.<br />
AC: Good on you and you had better come again or else! Mr Keating, it<br />
has been lovely to meet you, lovely to have you on Triple J.<br />
PM: Thank you.<br />
