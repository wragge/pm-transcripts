FOR MEDIA 11 July 1983<br />
An industrial monitoring committee will be established to<br />
monitor and advise on the transfer of former Gordon-below-<br />
Franklin darn workers to new projects.<br />
The committee, which will consist of representatives of thle<br />
Federal and State Governments, the unions and the Hydro-Electric<br />
Commission, will ensure that no workers are disadvantaged in<br />
the transfers.<br />
It was agreed to establish the committee at a meeting today<br />
between myself and a representative delegation from Tasmania<br />
consisting of the State Opposition Leader, Mr. Ken Wriedt, the<br />
General Manager of EZ, Mr. Reg Barker, the President of the<br />
Tasmanian Trade Union Council, M1r. John Devereux, the Secretary<br />
of the Tasmanian Farmers and Guraziers, Mr. Laurie Kelly, the<br />
Warden of Queenstown, Mr. Peter Schulze, and the Secretary of<br />
The Tasmanian Trades and Labor Council, Mr. Bob Watlingj.<br />
The meeting also agreed that discussions between the Federal and<br />
Tasmanian GovTernments should proceed quickly on a thorough<br />
investigation of the State's power needs, which can most<br />
appropriately be met by hydro-electricity,.<br />
The investigation will ensure that Tasmania will not be<br />
disadvantaged in its future economic development because of a<br />
lack of appropriate energy supplies.<br />
In response to issues raised by Mr. Schulze, it was agreed that<br />
the needs of the West Coast community would be fully taken into<br />
account in discussion of alternative employment projects and the<br />
future management of the South West.<br />
It was also agreed that I should visit the South West soon, after<br />
further work has been done on the development of alternative<br />
employment projects which will ensure no former Dam workers will<br />
be disadvantaged.<br />
I was very grateful that the delegation and its individual<br />
members could find the time to discuss these issues with me and<br />
the constructive manner in which they approached these talks. </p>
