CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
LAUNCH OF THE NATIONAL WOMEN'S HEALTH POLICY<br />
WESTMEAD HOSPITAL 20 APRIL 1989<br />
We are making history today as we launch Australia's first<br />
national women's health policy.<br />
Australia is one of the very few countries in the world to<br />
have determined to find out, and then to address, the<br />
special health needs and priorities of women.<br />
And we could hardly be celebrating this launch at a more<br />
appropriate venue than Westmead Hospital, which itself<br />
represents the response of a previous Labor Government to<br />
the health needs of women.<br />
From the day it first opened its doors, Westmead has shown a<br />
special understanding of, and dedication to meeting, the<br />
health needs of women.<br />
I take this opportunity to recognise the achievements of<br />
Dr Jenny Alexander, Westmead's General Superintendent, and<br />
Carla Cranny, the Director of Health Services Development<br />
for the Western Sydney Area Health Service.<br />
What Westmead Hospital is achieving in this regard is what<br />
the National Women's Health Policy is all about providing<br />
an imaginative, sensitive and flexible approach to the<br />
health concerns of the Australian community.<br />
Women's health is a central plank of the National Agenda for<br />
Women, which is my Government's blueprint for the<br />
improvement of the status of Australian women towards the<br />
Year 2000.<br />
Clearly, the good health and well being of women has to be<br />
assured before any credible claim can be made about the<br />
attainment by women of full and equal participation in<br />
Australian life.<br />
It is also clear to us that if we were to produce a credible<br />
and practical women's health policy, it must be based upon<br />
views obtained from as many Australian women as possible. </p>
<p>The National Women's Health Policy reflects in a unique way<br />
the views and priorities of more than one million Australian<br />
women who were consulted around the country the young and<br />
the elderly, those who live in the cities and those who live<br />
in the country, women in the paid workforce and women at<br />
home. Because it is based on such an extensive round of<br />
consultation, we can be pretty sure that the Policy indeed<br />
reflects the concerns of Australian women about health.<br />
In particular, Australian women told us they were concerned<br />
about seven major issues. They are:<br />
reproductive health and sexuality;<br />
the health of ageing women;<br />
women's emotional and mental health;<br />
violence against women;<br />
occupational health and safety;<br />
the health needs of women as carers; and<br />
the health effects of sex role stereotyping.<br />
To meet these concerns and to improve women's health, the<br />
policy nominates these five key areas where action is seen<br />
as necessary: improvements in health services for women;<br />
provision of health information for women;<br />
research and collection of data on women's health;<br />
training of health care providers; and<br />
women's participation in decision-making on health.<br />
Whether the women consulted in the development of the policy<br />
were in the country or the city, whether they were raising<br />
families or living alone in retirement, whether they were<br />
from affluent or struggling areas of Australia, there was a<br />
remarkable consensus on the key issues of concern.<br />
Not surprisingly, the overriding concern expressed was that<br />
the health system should be more sensitive to the needs of<br />
women. Women want doctors and other health care providers to listen<br />
to them and to treat them with dignity and respect as<br />
people, and not just as female patients.<br />
Women want better access to the variety of general and<br />
specialist services they need through their lives, and they<br />
want more women to be trained to deliver those services. </p>
<p>Women want better information on health and lifestyle issues<br />
and they want it to be easier to understand so that they can<br />
make more informed choices about their own health care and<br />
take more responsibility for maintaining their own health.<br />
These expressed concerns of women are eminently reasonable<br />
and they form the basis of this policy.<br />
Now that we have gathered these views and come to understand<br />
more clearly the health needs of the Australian women, what<br />
happens next?<br />
Does this report just sit in a file somewhere and gather<br />
dust? I give you my commitment that will not occur.<br />
State Health Ministers, including the NSW Minister Peter<br />
Collins, have endorsed this report in principle and their<br />
Governments will be considering its recommendations.<br />
I take this opportunity to thank Peter Collins for his<br />
strong support of the policy.<br />
At the Federal level, Neal Blewett will be bringing a<br />
submission to Federal Cabinet on this report.<br />
It is not possible of course to determine in advance just<br />
what Federal Cabinet will conclude.<br />
But I do give this commitment: we will give this report<br />
very close and very sympathetic attention.<br />
And I believe that our record of achievement on behalf of<br />
Australian women does indeed show that we are sympathetic to<br />
the needs of women in this regard.<br />
Let me summarise briefly for you some of those achievements.<br />
First among them was the introduction of Medicare.<br />
Medicare enfranchised two million Australians who were<br />
previously without health cover. Women, as the main users<br />
of health services and as those who assume the greatest<br />
responsibility for health care of the whole family, were the<br />
main beneficiaries of this reform.<br />
Medicare gives genuine meaning to equality of access in<br />
health delivery services, so it was an essential<br />
prerequisite to meeting the specific health concerns of<br />
women.<br />
At the same time, we set about other social reforms which we<br />
viewed as beneficial to the well being of women. These<br />
include removal of barriers to women's workforce<br />
participation; programs to assist entry and re-entry to the<br />
job market; and affirmative action legislation. </p>
<p>We have created more than 1.3 million jobs since 1983 and<br />
almost 60 per cent of them have gone to women.<br />
We introduced the Family Allowance Supplement to provide<br />
valuable assistance for low income families with children.<br />
We established the Child Support Agency to ensure that<br />
non-custodial parents take appropriate financial<br />
responsibility for their children.<br />
The Government has directly funded an increase of 64,000<br />
child care places since April 1983 and a further 30,000<br />
places will be created by 1992.<br />
April has been a significant month for Australian women,<br />
taking them several steps further towards realisation of the<br />
goals of the National Agenda for women.<br />
Given that the Women's Health Policy identified violence<br />
against women as a major concern, it is appropriate that<br />
April is Domestic violence Awareness Month. This is part of<br />
our nationwide campaign to raise public awareness of this<br />
widespread and all-too-often hidden problem.<br />
And of course last week, with the April Statement, the<br />
Government announced the wages-tax-family package which will<br />
continue to build upon these achievements. This package<br />
includes: tax cuts which will, particularly through the reduction<br />
in the lowest rates, benefit women workers;<br />
dramatic increases in Family Allowance payments;<br />
additional payments for families in receipt of the<br />
Family Allowance Supplement; and<br />
further assistance for one income families, including<br />
sole parents.<br />
I would like to thank everyone who has been involved in the<br />
preparation of the National Women's Health Policy not<br />
least the women who provided the comments and views on which<br />
this report is based.<br />
As the State and Federal Ministers have shown, there is<br />
considerable bipartisan agreement to put the protection and<br />
promotion of the health and well being of Australian women<br />
on a sure basis.<br />
This approach acknowledges that implementation of policies<br />
and programs designed to improve women's health, well being<br />
and life opportunities must be one of Australia's major<br />
goals in the closing years of the twentieth century<br />
So I have much pleasure now in launching the National<br />
Women's Health Policy a blueprint for fostering the better<br />
health of Australian women and the greater well being of all<br />
Australians. </p>
