OPENING OF MIATTARA FESTIVAL<br />
NEW~ CASTLE, N. S. YI. 1st September, 1967<br />
Speech by the Prime bMinister, Mr. Harold Holt<br />
My Lord Mvayor,<br />
Alderman Bell,<br />
The Princess of Mattara, 1966, my greetings, and<br />
ly congratulations in advance to Princess of Mattara, 1967,<br />
1Vdy greetings to all the Distinguished Visitors present, and<br />
To you, Ladies and Gentlemen,<br />
Boys and Girls,<br />
This is for me quite a unique occasion because although<br />
it is your 7th Lattara Festival it is my first and I am delighted<br />
to have the honour of being with you, ( I understand with the duty<br />
of formally declaring the Festival open), and I hope I do not<br />
forget to do so by speaking too long, but also to be with you on<br />
what represents part of what has occurred to me to be a very<br />
balanced diet of living as one finds it here in this rapidly<br />
developing city of Newcastle. Because you now rank as the sixth<br />
urban area in point of size in the Commonwealth of Australia,<br />
only surpassed in size by five of the capital cities and I suspect<br />
that you will catch up with one or two of those before you are<br />
O much older. . Earlier today as I flew around the city with the Lord<br />
1ilayor, I found him very knowledgeable, pointing out to me all<br />
the important developments which were occurring here. I could<br />
not fail to appreciate the significance which Newcastle occupies<br />
in the life of this great Commonwealth of ours. Not only are<br />
you ranking sixth in numbers but in industry, significant in the<br />
diversity of your industries both of the engineering industrial<br />
type and on the land with a wine industry which commands a<br />
premium price around Australia. You have here one of the most<br />
critically important areas of the whole of the Commonwealth of<br />
Australia. But proving that men and women do not live by bread<br />
alone or even wine alone you have developed this happy Festival,<br />
this Mattara Festival, the Mattara I understand signifying the<br />
hand of friendship, and if there is one characteristic which we<br />
regard as typical of the Australian, it is his capacity for<br />
mateship, for feeling at one and happy with his fellow citizen,<br />
and your Festival here tonight appears to symbolize that spirit<br />
which we prize so much in our national character.<br />
Now it is not my purpose to dletain you at length when<br />
you have such greater attractions in the young ladies I have<br />
been seeing backstage to come before you and accept the judgment<br />
of those who have been set that difficult task.<br />
But I do ex -press the hope that just as the years which<br />
have gone have marked a most remark~ able development in Newcastle<br />
that here you have deve-boped a civic and community spirit which<br />
I believe not only puts a stamp of individuality upon your<br />
community but marks you out as one of the great thriving<br />
enterprising areas of the nation as a whole.<br />
Because with that you have also developed this festive<br />
balance to the otherwise more sombre and serious aspects of life,<br />
I hope that this 7th Mattara Festival will prove to be the most<br />
distinguished, the most festive, the most happy of all those which<br />
have made up the series. And it is with good wishes to you all,<br />
the hope that you can go on as a community from strength to. strength<br />
