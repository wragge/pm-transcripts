SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER, RT. HON. R. G.<br />
MENZIES, AT THE OPENING OF THE OVERSEAS TELECOMMUNICATIONS<br />
CONFERENCE, 12 SPRING STREET,<br />
SYDNEY, 28TH SEPTEMBER, 19529<br />
Sir, I am very grateful to you for your very kind<br />
words, but you struck a chill into my heart when you referred<br />
to what I an about to say as an " inaugural address", because I<br />
don't mind telling you that I said cheerfully to one of your<br />
Masters here today " How long do I go, about 12 minutes?" and I<br />
distinctly got the impression that that would be acceptable unless<br />
I could improve on it and make it eight. And to have<br />
this signified by you, Postmaster-General, as an " inaugural address"<br />
is really rather terrifying.<br />
Still it is a family conference. I hope you will allow<br />
me to talk to you in a family way. I have been attending<br />
family conferences, meaning by that, conferences in which have<br />
been represented Great Britain anid Canada and Australia and<br />
New Zealand for more years than the locust has eaten. In fact<br />
you wouldn't think to look at me, with my boyish outlines<br />
( laughter) that the first one I attended was just on a quarter<br />
of a century ago at No, 10 Downing Street.) and I have been,<br />
by some accident or other, at many of them since and I enjoy the<br />
family conference. And particularly is it a good thing when you<br />
don't just meet to exchange a few ideas and produce one of those<br />
famous communiques with which I have been associated in the past,<br />
from which all meaning is religiously excluded. After all,<br />
this is in a very true sense a business discussion. You are go<br />
-ing to deal with a great enterprise, which I am sure we will<br />
all approach in a most co-operative way. It is a reat enterprise<br />
that will bring us even closer together and more securely<br />
together in the field of oornmuni cations.<br />
When I knew that I was to do this and I knew because<br />
Charles Davidson ordered me to do it, and he's a Colonel, and I<br />
therefore treat him with a certain amiount of meretricious respect,<br />
I allowed my mind to play on the subject of'corimunications,<br />
Well, it is, I think one of the remarkable things of<br />
this century to look back I look back over my own lifetime<br />
and to ask oneself: " In what field of humian activity is it that<br />
the greatest developments have been m~ ade in my lifetime?". I<br />
put on one side the subtle mysteries of the bio-chemists and the<br />
people who have wrought their own miracles, but in ordinary human<br />
relations the most remarkable miracle that has been wrought<br />
has been in the field of communi cations.<br />
One has only to look back on it, I am old enough to<br />
remember the first time a telephone appeared in our village at<br />
any rate and it filled me with such horror that I've never<br />
quite got over it. My staff tell me that I'm tho rudest man on<br />
the telephone they've ever known, Well that's only because,<br />
when you pick that thing up and you're asked a question you say<br />
" Yes" and hang up, or Then the other fellow hangs up.<br />
But they tell me I am not very good at it, that it is all rather<br />
abrupt, and perhaps the reason for that is that in my later<br />
youth, which some of you will remember very well, it was a great<br />
thing to get on to the telephone in the evening and talk to some<br />
young woman with whom you were passionately in love, or thought<br />
you were, Those conversations used to last about three quarters<br />
of an hour. They were not conversations they were interrupted<br />
by long silences while each partner to this curious transaction<br />
tried to think of something amusing to say, and failed hopelessly.<br />
But the telephone well, look at it, you find yourself<br />
on one side of the world and you say " I'd like to speak to somebody<br />
in Australia", or " I'd like to speak to somebody in the </p>
<p>United States" or " the United Kingdom" and quite frequently you<br />
bet through. That, I think, is fascinating and not infrequent<br />
-ly, when you have got through, you hear wha the other man has<br />
to say! They tell me it's very " good, and of course it is a<br />
miracle. The other day I had occasion to answer the telephone<br />
in the morning.. They put a call through to me and it was my<br />
wife and she was travelling to Tasmania aboard the new ferry<br />
" The Princess of Tasmania". She launched it and they gave her<br />
a free journey the first time. And I said to her " Hello.' Did<br />
you have a nice voyage?", you see one of those fatuous remarks<br />
and she said " We are at sea" t. Well that is a state<br />
that I have been in so frequently that it took me nearly a minute<br />
to realise that they were still on the water, using a radio<br />
telephone, and really, it was as if you were in the same room<br />
carrying on a conversation.<br />
The telephone the telegraph, wireless, broadcasting,<br />
television, those are all matters of communication, these are<br />
all matters that bring us nearer to each other and now they<br />
have discovered a now way of communicating wih ' the moon, by<br />
hitting it. Well that is ag-ain an essay in the field of communication,<br />
because it is perhaps occasionally overlooked that<br />
all these satellites are sending their owm nessages just as<br />
pilotless aircrafts send their own messages. We have the whole<br />
of this simply phenomenal development of communic,: itions. You<br />
exports take it for granted because you understand about it and<br />
you can see the next step arising, but I assure you that when I<br />
sat down and said to myself " Well there's the telegraph,<br />
there's telephone, wireless, there's broadcasting, there's television<br />
and there are satellites isn't this the most remarkable<br />
revolution that's occurred, humanly speaking, in -the last quarter<br />
of a century?". And I an sure that it is. I was talking<br />
to a very distinguished business man the other day from another<br />
country and we agreed that if understanding between countries,<br />
and business contacts between countries could advance in the<br />
next 10 or 20 years as phenomenally as communications between<br />
countries and individuals have advanced, the world had a fair<br />
chance of improving itself before this century is out. And<br />
that, of course, is so true.<br />
You have made the world smaller. It isn't your fault,<br />
nor, I hope, is it m-. ine in particular, but it certainly isn't<br />
your fault, that in the very period in which you have enabled<br />
people almost literally to stretch out their hands and touch<br />
each other, and speak with each Uther, as if they were face to<br />
face, in that very period tho."* Cld has'% boen very busy<br />
building up divisions of other kinds. We have had one of the<br />
greatest waves of acute nationalism since the War that the World<br />
has ever seen. Prejudices have been exacerbated, hostilities,<br />
sometimes very bitter ones, have been played on, some of the<br />
most barbarous things in modern history have occurred, and all<br />
this, in spite of the fact that you have put into the hands and<br />
minds of men and women these priceless means of talking with<br />
each other, coimmunicating with each other, 7, etting,, to understand<br />
each other. And therefore I hope that we are going~ to have a<br />
second revolution coming on top of yours indeed the World<br />
needs it very much,<br />
Anybody who is concerned with politics, anybody who<br />
attends, as I do myself, International Conferences in which we<br />
discuss the grave issues of peace and war and of International<br />
understanding, can't help being struck, time after time, that<br />
while we have had put into our possession the whole mechanics of<br />
International understanding, we have, so far, not yet acquired<br />
the spirit. Our hands have been, to that extent, more adroit<br />
than our hearts, or than our minds.<br />
But, Sir, I believe that when we have broken down<br />
some of the barriers, when Leaders of Great Nations have come to </p>
<p>3.<br />
regard their meetings as a commonplace and not as some phenomenon<br />
which requires massive headlines, when they have got into<br />
the habit of saying " Well I'm so close to this man, my means of<br />
communication are so easy that I'll have a talk with him tonight,<br />
I'll ask him to come over tomorrow.." don't forget that<br />
the Jet Aircraft is one of the great means of communication, and<br />
not merely a means of destruction think we ought to have a<br />
chat next week-end". This kind of thing which is commonplace in<br />
your own country will, I hope, become a commonplace, internationally.<br />
And when it does I think great changes will come to the<br />
world. You know, if you can stand right off and be at arms'<br />
length it is terribly easy to nurse your prejudices and to<br />
nurse your hatreds and to say " That nan's no good"'. I have met<br />
a lot of fellows in the world in my lifetime that I thought were<br />
terrible fellows. I became quite fond of them after I met them.<br />
I even can remember this is very confidential having a deputation<br />
come to me once from a few sturdy characters and at the<br />
end of it, one ofthem stayed back and said: " I think I'd just<br />
like to tell you that you're not half such a big so-and-so as<br />
they told me you were". There you are, that was the benefit of<br />
direct face to face cormmunication<br />
But, really Gentlemen, it is, I think, a great and con<br />
-structive piece of work to be able to sit down to discuss this<br />
Cable, to discuss this great enterprise which will bring our<br />
family closer together, and it is a jolly -ood thing to start<br />
with the family, because not one of us is contemplating fighting<br />
the other and we all know that on all the great occasions of<br />
trial, we are the one people and we stand together, We know<br />
that, and therefore something that brings us closer together is<br />
a great thing, but it doesn't only bring us closer together it<br />
is another stop in this remarkable development which has put into<br />
the hands of the people of the world one of the greatest instruments<br />
for peace that the world has ever had. I would like<br />
you to think of it in that way. These are great instruments<br />
for peace, because they are great instruments for mutual understanding,<br />
and if we are such fools in the world as not to use<br />
these implements as we shoid, well then, that's a reflection on<br />
us, but, I venture to say, not a reflection on you,<br />
As far as we are concerned in Australia, we have an<br />
undiminished belief in the significance of the British Commonwealth<br />
in this world, and if I may say so, we have the oldest<br />
associations in the world, with the countries that are here represented,<br />
indissoluble associations, We can have an argument,<br />
occasionally, but the argument is never fatal, it is an enjoy<br />
able argument.-we are all argumentative people, except New Zealanders,<br />
and of course they take it for granted that you will<br />
agree with them anyhow.<br />
But to get together in this fashion in this new exhibition<br />
of co-operation in the communications field will, I<br />
believe, be a very powerful contribution to the sanity and civilization<br />
of the year. To tell you the truth, and this of<br />
course is very secret information, I'm much more interested in<br />
what you are going to produce out of this conference and the results<br />
which I hope will flow from it, than I am in the question<br />
of " Who next hits the moon with a rocket?". I don't like this<br />
monkeying about with the Moon myself. The moon has been quite<br />
useful to you and me in its day cnd of course it has other trifling<br />
advantages in the world's geography and oceanography.<br />
But these are the straight, simple means of bringing<br />
people closer togethor. Many things that have been happening<br />
since in the International world, though they would be great instruments<br />
of bringing us together, are thought of, and written<br />
about, as if they were instruments to divide us, to make us </p>
<p>jealous of somebody else and to stir up hatred in our bosoms.<br />
Indeed, to no, it is one of the reflections on our tine that<br />
whereas even I can remem. ber the tine when, if some scientist<br />
produced sone new wonder, the whole world applauded it the<br />
whole world wanted to take advantage of it. They didn~ t say:<br />
" What side of an Iron Curtain was he on?" or " What country was<br />
he The people who pioneered the great anti-biotic drugs,<br />
these fellows, the marvels, the Flemings and all those people of<br />
the world, they wore International property, everybody was proud<br />
of them, everybody was delighted with what they did, and I think<br />
that one of the things I hold most against certain people in the<br />
world is that they have now set out to teach us -to believe that<br />
a great piece of technology, a splendid piece of Applied Science,<br />
in whatever field it nay be, is to be regardod so~ lely in terms<br />
of rivalry, so that we get our tails dowm if the other man wins<br />
the first heat, or the third heat. What a lot of nonsense it<br />
is. I have no sense of shamie about what people of our kind,<br />
not me, I'm the least scientific of mortals, but the record of<br />
people of our kind in the world, in all those discoveries of<br />
science which have brought untold benefits to hum--anity, will<br />
take a good deal of knocking about by somebody who in some particular<br />
or specialised field manages to do something, and do it<br />
extraordinarily well, that nobody else has yet done.,<br />
And so, Sir, I commwend your task it is perhaps pedestrian<br />
from the point of view of those engaged in rocketry, but<br />
it is vastly important and I believe that as a result of all<br />
these discussions, and what gYoes on, we will find ourselves able<br />
botween ourselves, to make this new developruent and to forge<br />
another link in the chain of communications that will bring us<br />
closer together, and, in due course, bring the people of the<br />
world closer together.<br />
And so, Charles, I have the very reatest honour indeed,<br />
not in delivering an address, but in declaring the Confer-~<br />
ence open, and I think, Sir, that you won't be entirely irregulawhich<br />
you frequently are I ought to propose, quite impertinently<br />
to this meeting that when I have sat down you might<br />
perhaps instal the Postmaster-General in the Chair, so that the<br />
business hereafter m~ ay be regular. </p>
