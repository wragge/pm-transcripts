PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR NEDIA30 JULY 1990<br />
it is my practice whil-e overseas rnot to coment on domestic<br />
matters. Rovever, as the proposal for a special national conference<br />
has generated significant interest, I believe it is<br />
appropriate to make the following comment:<br />
I have been kept informed of this proposal. It is a serious<br />
proposal and should be discussed within the Party. I will,<br />
of course, be involved in those discussions when I return. </p>
