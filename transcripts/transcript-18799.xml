I am pleased to announce that I have reappointed Ms Lisa Paul AO PSM as Secretary of the Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations.</p>
<p>Having received a report from the Secretary of my Department, as required by the Public Service Act 1999, I have reappointed Ms Paul for a term of five years from 3 December 2012.</p>
<p>Ms Paul is a highly experienced Secretary who has already made a significant contribution to the Australian Public Service. In 2011 Ms Paul was made an Officer of the Order of Australia for distinguished service to public sector leadership in key policy and program implementation, particularly through driving reform in education, employment and workplace relations. I express my appreciation for her ongoing contribution. </p>
