    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Prime Minister and the Chief Minister are pleased to announce</p>
<p> the formation of a $10 million Katherine Region Redevelopment Programme,</p>
<p> to help the community of Katherine recover from the devastating floods.</p>
<p>The target is $10 million, of which the two Governments will contribute</p>
<p> one third each and is in addition to the significant contribution</p>
<p> of $31 million already announced by the Commonwealth.</p>
<p>We are now asking business in the region, from banks to mining companies,</p>
<p> to contribute the remaining third of this fund.</p>
<p>Corporate contributions will be tax deductible.</p>
<p>It is understood that Westpac Bank is supportive of the programme</p>
<p> and will be making a statement later today. I join with Shane Stone</p>
<p> in applauding this prompt response from Westpac.</p>
<p>It is in everyone's interests that Katherine is operating normally</p>
<p> again as soon as possible. The primary focus of this fund will be</p>
<p> to get business started again in Katherine, so that income can start</p>
<p> to flow and people can begin to rebuild.</p>
<p>Last week the Federal Government announced an emergency $5 million</p>
<p> worth of road funding to rebuild the Sturt Highway - the main delivery</p>
<p> route for goods into and out of Katherine.</p>
<p>Today's fund will cover areas such as re-establishment of electricity,</p>
<p> rehabilitation of Katherine Terrace (the main business centre), assistance</p>
<p> to restart business and repairing the Tourism Information Centre.</p>
<p>This will complement other Government action to help the residents</p>
<p> of Katherine. These include funding to help restore infrastructure</p>
<p> and financial assistance to rebuild homes and businesses.</p>
<p>The Commonwealth has already committed some $31 million in direct</p>
<p> disaster relief so far, with a further $11 million in direct assistance</p>
<p> from the Northern Territory.</p>
<p>Both leaders praised the way the community has pulled together in</p>
<p> this difficult time, in the best traditions of Australian mateship</p>
<p> and helping your neighbour.</p>
<p>The Australian Defence Forces have also been magnificent with the</p>
<p> assistance they have provided to Katherine residents.</p>
<p>They paid special tribute to the efforts of the Australian Defence</p>
<p> Forces, Police and Emergency Services and other volunteers for the</p>
<p> magnificent assistance they have provided to the residents of Katherine.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Howard and Chief Minister Stone said the workers'</p>
<p> efforts deserve the highest praise.</p>
<p>The flooding at Katherine has been quite extraordinary in the damage</p>
<p> it has caused. Houses and businesses have been covered in water for</p>
<p> days at a time. The business centre of Katherine has been very badly</p>
<p> damaged. This represents a significant impediment to the ability of</p>
<p> Katherine and the region to recover from the flooding.</p>
<p>The flooding is greater than a one in a hundred year event and this</p>
<p> has necessitated an additional effort from Government.</p>
<p>This need for an extra effort is behind the formation of the Katherine</p>
<p> Region Redevelopment Programme.</p>
