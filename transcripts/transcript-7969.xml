PRIME. MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW BETWEEN ALAN JONES ( 2UE) AND PRIM4E<br />
MINISTER, BOB HAWKS.<br />
16 MARCH 1990<br />
H OE PROOF ONLY<br />
JONES: My special guest between now and half past eight, the<br />
Prime Minister of Australia, Mr Hawke. Thank you for your time.<br />
PM: Good to be with you, Alan.<br />
JONES: Prime Minister, can I use an analogy that you might<br />
appreciate, if you don't mind being called the Vo Rogue of<br />
Australian politics. Getting on a bit in years, still the crowd<br />
favourite, carrying a lot of weight in the saddle, form a bit<br />
patchy, but in this latest outing appears to be leading all the<br />
way. Are you still in front?<br />
Pm: well, we seem to be but I want to make it quite clear I am<br />
not complacent. I think it's a hard campaign and I'll be going<br />
flat out until a week tonight.<br />
JONES: Before we tackle those issues you've been talking about<br />
for the last weeks, can we just take one foreign policy issue,<br />
which I'm sure all Australians are interested in? How up to date<br />
are you on the Papua New Guinean position whereby apparently<br />
there was an insurrection that we knew nothing about?<br />
PH: I spoke to Rabbie Namaliu last night. I rang and had quite<br />
a long conversation with him because, as you know, I have a very,<br />
very close interest in what's happening up there as any<br />
Australian Prime Minister should. And the Prime Minister assures<br />
mg. these things: one, that there was no support for Tohian's<br />
dxunken escapade<br />
JONES: Yes, he got drunk apparently.<br />
PM: From within the armed forces from within the Army. And very<br />
little from within the police. He says that the Opposition has<br />
been central in their support of his position because they<br />
recognise the implications of giving any encouragement to that<br />
sort of insurrection. And he seems confident from the discussion </p>
<p>I had with him, Alan, that things are under control. I took the<br />
opportunity, of course, of assuring him of the Australian<br />
Government's complete commitment to constitutional processes in<br />
Papua New Guinea.<br />
JONES; Yes, it's a difficult place. Whether it is ungovernable<br />
or not remains to be seen. Prime Minister<br />
PM: Very difficult to<br />
JONES: The Reserve Bank. Could we just start with the Reserve<br />
Bank and the question of interest rates? Do you acknowledge that<br />
it's a fully autonomous statutory authority?<br />
PM: Yes. And I also acknowledge that it operates under the<br />
legislation and that under the legislation there are not only the<br />
opportunlities, but the requirements for consultation and<br />
discussion between the Government and the Reserve Bank.<br />
Processes which are always followed with complete propriety by my<br />
Treasurer and by the Governor of the Reserve Bank and the Board.<br />
JONES: But the Board make the decisions about policy, don't<br />
they? PM: Well, to put it as simply as that is not the case. They<br />
don't JONES: Under the Act, they do though.<br />
PM: That it is the case under the Act that there is provision<br />
for discussion and that is what follows. And what happened<br />
before this election campaign started, for instance<br />
JONES: But It's a pretty....<br />
PM: Wait a minute, let me finish. What happened before the<br />
campaign started was that there were discussions between the<br />
Treasurer and the Governor. And out of those discussions, then,<br />
there was a meeting of the Board and the Board made the decision<br />
which brought down prime rates.<br />
JONES: But it's a pretty loaded statement, isn't it, that you've<br />
made to say that we will be discussing it, presumably interest<br />
rates, and I hope I quote you accurately with them....<br />
PM: ( Inaudible)<br />
JONES: Yeah, I'm trying to. With them on the basis that<br />
interest rates should come down.<br />
PM: It's not like that at all. </p>
<p>JONESS It's a bit of big stick stuff, isn't it?<br />
PM: No, no. On the contrary. It's the obligation. It's the<br />
obligation of the Government to let the Reserve Bank know what<br />
the policy and the position of the Government is. That's always<br />
been the case the case under the previous Governmeflt... the<br />
case under this Government. And we have been in a position where<br />
we've been able to act in complete propriety and sympathy with<br />
the Governor who was appointed by the previous Governm~ ent that<br />
was Bob Johnson as well as with the Governor we ' ye appointed.<br />
JONES: So you've said that interest rates should come down? Now<br />
before the West Australian election, you said they'd be down by<br />
Christmas. PM: Yeah, well, we've been over that. Now let me make it quite<br />
clear. Like every economist in the public and private sector, at<br />
that stage I and the Government underestimated the strength and<br />
9demand in the Australian economy. And I've publicly conceded<br />
that. And with the strength and demand that went through last<br />
year, in f act, rates had to stay high. The important thing now<br />
is that, as you appreciate, ( inaudible) in the media in the last<br />
24 hours,. the banks are saying they expect rates to come down<br />
under the policies that we've got in place.<br />
JONES: Do you underestimate, though, the gravity of the problem?<br />
I mean, the facts of interest rates, as you've been telling<br />
everybody, is because of the debt. There's no attempt and<br />
I'll talk about this in a minute but seemingly to stabilise the<br />
debt PM: On the contrary. On the contrary. There is. We've got the<br />
three major policies in place to do that. Firstly, our wages<br />
policy. We've got a predictable wages outcome which is making<br />
Australian industry more competitive. There's enormous growth<br />
in the export of manufactured goods. And the figures that came<br />
out yesterday, Alan, # seethe figures that came out yesterday-<br />
P the December quarter balance of payment figures are accepted by<br />
every economic commentator as showing a turnaround in the<br />
position. So much so that there's been there's been a<br />
reduction in the ( inaudible) rates today.<br />
JONESt Take that point. I said to stabilise the debt that would<br />
taquire the Prime Minister to be able to tell the electorate from<br />
March 24, that the debt would stay where it is today. Now to do<br />
that, as I understand it, would require in real terms, imports to<br />
fall by three percent, exports to grow by five percent that's<br />
impossible. P14: Not from the first day of the 25th<br />
JONES: That's what stabilising the debt means. </p>
<p>PM: No, don't misrepresent me. I said that it is a legitimate<br />
target to do that within three years. That's what I said.<br />
JONES: But you'll have the debt continuing.<br />
PM: *...... 0stabilisation of the debt is to get your current<br />
account deficit as an acceptable proportion of the gross domestic<br />
product. And I am saying that we've got the three fundamental<br />
policies in place to do that. The wages policy, which is making<br />
our industry more competitive. And importantly, Alan,<br />
importantly.... a budget surplus. in regard to the f irst one,<br />
they will have a wages explosion. In respect of the second,<br />
where we have done what no Government has ever done before, for<br />
the past three years, budget surplus 17 billion dollars paid<br />
of f every cent of overseas debt of the Commonwealth Government.<br />
The other mob will blow the surplus. And thirdly, a<br />
superannuation plan which, by the end of this decade, will give<br />
S us between six and seven hundred billion dollars in<br />
superannuation funds, which will mean that Australian industry<br />
will be able to call upon domestic savings and not need to borrow<br />
overseas. Now those three fundamental policies are in place to<br />
be able<br />
JONES; You just raised another question. I just want to repeat<br />
I find it impossible for you to believe that you'd be<br />
telling the electorate that you could stabilise the debt which<br />
would require imports to reduce by three percent a year in real<br />
terms when the average growth of them in recent years has been<br />
about 22 percent growth. You've got to cut that back to three<br />
percent and get exports up. And you tell me that all these<br />
policies can contain that debt. I'm saying that the public...<br />
PM: I'm simply saying to you that if you look at the December<br />
quarter balance of payment figures, which were published<br />
yesterday, that there you see what is happening. A turn<br />
around in the nett export position. I mean, I've got the figures<br />
there, I can go to them. They show a significant increase in the<br />
export-trend. A decline in the import trend.<br />
JONES: Sure, but...<br />
PM: Now those things are happening. On the basis of that I<br />
-don't say it's going to be stabilised tomorrow. But what I have<br />
said, Alan, is it15 a legitimate target in the light of the<br />
evidence that emerges that within a three year period, I would<br />
hope, that you would get to that stabilisation period. Not<br />
tomorrow, three years.<br />
JONES: When the country, of which you're Prime Minister, of 16<br />
million people </p>
<p>PM: Seventeen million.<br />
JONES: Seventeen million. With a nett f oreign debt of about<br />
118 billion....<br />
PM A hundred and eighteen.<br />
JONES: A hundred and eighteen billion dollars<br />
PM, Yeah.<br />
JONES: The whole of the Eastern Bloc has a population of 400<br />
million and their nett debt is 105 billion dollars.<br />
P14: Nonsense.<br />
JONES: It's not nonsense, it's true.<br />
0 PM: Absolute nonsense.<br />
JONES: Well, tell me what their foreign debt is.<br />
PM: I don't know, but I know it's not that.<br />
JONES: I'm saying it's that.<br />
PKS! Yeah, where did you got that from?<br />
JONES: I'm telling you it's that. I wouldn't be telling you if<br />
It wasn't the case.<br />
PM: I'm saying I don't believe it.<br />
JONES: I'll show you the source, but I'll come back.<br />
PM: Okay.<br />
JONES: I'll come back to the paint I was making. I'll come back<br />
to the point I was making before.<br />
PM: Righto.<br />
JONES: You've got the growth in foreign debt and you're saying<br />
Thbat you can stabilise that? Six percent of GDP paid f or the<br />
foreign debt in 1980, now we need 32 percent. Now, I'm saying<br />
this debt has occurred<br />
PM: C( inaudible)<br />
JONES: No, no, no. But you're saying you can turn this<br />
around.... </p>
<p>PHI I am saying that what you have in respect of what'Is under<br />
the Government's controll we have not only turned around, we are<br />
now a nett international creditor to the tune of four billion<br />
dollar~ s. Sixty five percent of the debt, Alan, is in the private<br />
hands, and those...<br />
JONES: Yeah, but you don't<br />
PM: Now, just a minute, Alan, , you've had your say. Just give<br />
me a little bit of an opportunity for a response...<br />
JONES: ( inaudible)<br />
PM: Thank you very much. Now, when you look at that f oreign<br />
debt, have a look at the other side of it. Look at what Access<br />
Economics has said. They've said 45 billion dollars that they've<br />
identified of investment actually under construction or totally<br />
committed which will be bringing in an additional 5 billion<br />
0dollars a year of export earnings. So the other side of those<br />
debt figures that you look at have got to be seen as constituting<br />
what will help us in the years ahead to overcome the debt<br />
problem. It has been investment to restructure Australian<br />
industry. Now what I'm saying is that what you need to do is to<br />
move up to a point where your current account def icit is at an<br />
acceptable proportion of GDP, in the order of about two and a<br />
half to three percent. I believe we can do that because of the<br />
fact that we're talking about firstly, that we are making a<br />
more competitive Australian industry..,. 54 percent increase in<br />
manufactured exports in the last four years. A 69 percent<br />
increase in exports of services. Secondly, we've got a budgetary<br />
policy which will mean that the Government is releasing its<br />
demand and, in fact, creating a new situation where the private<br />
sector is able to call upon the Australian savings. And thirdly,<br />
a massive increase in Australian savings through superannuation.<br />
Now, all those things together, in our judgement, and I think<br />
importantly, in the judgement of the market, means that we are<br />
going to be able effectively in this three year time scale, to<br />
tackle this problem.<br />
JONES: Prime Minister, we've just had a world economy, in the<br />
last five, six, seven years, which has been in good shape,<br />
.6we ' ye had record returns from our commodity sector record<br />
returns in other words, our export value and volume has never<br />
tten better, yet we have record debt. We have record interest<br />
rates. We have record levels relative to the overseas<br />
PM We don't have record interest rates. We don't have record<br />
interest rates. The 90-day bill rate was 22 percent in April of<br />
1982. JONES: Well, relatively. </p>
<p>PM: Well you can't have it relatively.<br />
JONES: Well, hang on. Here we are in Australia<br />
P14: How would you like that in rugby, to have a relative record?<br />
JONESt Hang on. Here's The Economist,.. the Australia's interest<br />
rates is at the top of the chart on a chart of The Economist last<br />
week 19.* 5 percent prime lending<br />
PM ( inaudible) Australia..*..<br />
JONESs Hang on PM, hang on PM. Belgium *.. wellw# e ' ve got to<br />
compete with these people to make a quid.<br />
PM: Yeah.<br />
JONES: You keep saying that. Belgium 13.25, Canada, 14, France<br />
11, Germany 10. We're 19.5. Record interest rates. Record<br />
debt. Record levels of inflation. And now unemployment<br />
yesterday, the highest it's been in twelve months. True, isn't<br />
1. t?<br />
PX: Now, come on. Can I have a chance now?<br />
JONES: No, but is that true? The highest for twelve months?<br />
PM: The highest for twelve months, yeah.<br />
JONES: Is it? Now, do you think the figures that came out<br />
yesterday are current?<br />
PM: The figures that came out in regard to employment<br />
JONES: Are current?<br />
PM: Yes, I think they're current.<br />
JONES: And that's the position today?<br />
PM: Yeah.<br />
JONES: Now that's the latest statistics. Is it the latest<br />
-ftemployment reality? Or do you think it's worse since those<br />
figures came out.<br />
PM: No, I wouldn't think it's worse.<br />
JONES: Can I ask you to drive this morning just down here to the<br />
Oak Club the Oak Club at Neutral Bay we're talking interest<br />
rates have a look on the right hand side, you'll find fifty<br />
shops that are vacant as a result of interest rates. </p>
<p>PHM: Okay.-<br />
JONES: i Fi fty. They're closing down. Do you understand that's<br />
happening out there?<br />
PM: I understand it. There's hardship, yes. I said it in the<br />
policy statement. Now..... have you finished your Speech? And can<br />
I have a response? or are you going on?<br />
JONES: No, it was a question. it wasn't a speech.<br />
PM: Okay. Alright. Now let's now let's go to some of the<br />
assertions. Okay? Firstly, you talked about record interest<br />
rates. Now we're talking about this country. It is simply not<br />
true. The record interest rate is under the previous Government<br />
when the ninety day bill rate was 22 percent, in April of 1982.<br />
There have not been record interest rates under my Government.<br />
But now we've come to employment, my dear friend. There you are<br />
with your tongue so f irmly set in your cheek it's nearly<br />
hitting me over this side of the room. I mean you talk about<br />
employment... JONES: I said unemployment.<br />
PM: And unemployment. Employment and unemployment. Okay, let's<br />
talk about it. Under my Government.....<br />
JONES: I don't want to debate unemployment because you've done a<br />
great job. You've done a great job.<br />
PM: Okay. We'll talk about the other<br />
JONESs Yesterday ( inaudible) losing jobs<br />
PM: I thought it was my turn.<br />
JONES: No, why don't you talk about unemployment?<br />
PM: Okay, and I want to.<br />
JONES: Okay. Go on. Go on.<br />
Okay, thank you. The unemployment rate that we inherited<br />
JONES: I can't remember that one.<br />
PM: No, I bet you can't. You wouldn't want to talk about it.<br />
JONES: But it's so long ago. </p>
<p>pm: But I'm saying is that we've massively brought down the<br />
unemployment rate massively brought it down in this country.<br />
The situation in that when I came to office, in the previous<br />
year, a quarter of a million Australians were thrown on the<br />
unemployment scrapheap, and we have consistently for the whole of<br />
the period that we've been in office, brought down unemployment.<br />
Now, you told me that we needed to slow the economy down because<br />
interest rates were too high. We've slowed the economy down<br />
somewhat by having high interest rates. Because we're dealing<br />
with the problem we started with the international debt. But<br />
then you tell me that because you're doing the right thing Mr<br />
Prime Minister by slowing the economy down to deal with the<br />
international debt problem and the slowing down of the<br />
economy.... JONES a Did I say that?<br />
PM: Yeah, well, that's what you started off, Alan, by saying<br />
that the major problem is the question of debt<br />
JONES: Oh, but I didn't say the only way to do it was to<br />
PM: Well, what's the other way?<br />
JONES: ( inaudible) interest rates<br />
PM: Well, what's the other way? What's the other way?<br />
JONES: I'm not the Prime Minister.<br />
PM: Well, I'm telling you the three arms of policy, my friend.<br />
One: f iscal policy. And fiscal policy, I've done it. Never<br />
been done before in this country. Three years in a row of<br />
surplus; 17 billion dollars. In all their years, the<br />
conservatives could never run the business of this country to get<br />
a surplus.<br />
JONES: You've grabbed a lot of revenue, have a look at that<br />
figure. It was 41 billion in 82, 83. The residue is now 8 91<br />
billion... PM: And do you know what the revenue figure is? The percentage<br />
take that we take from the gross domestic product is the same as<br />
-when we came to office. We haven't increased it by one fraction<br />
of a percentage point....<br />
JONES: That is true.<br />
PM: Thank you.<br />
JONESs Now, can I just show you that chart there? We were<br />
talking about.... </p>
<p>PM: What about unemployment? Can I have ( inaudible) at that?<br />
JONES: Well, I I... is there an answer?<br />
PM: The answer is that we have massively reduced unemployment in<br />
this country. We've had a rate of employment growth twice as<br />
fast as the rest of the world.<br />
JONES: Yes. Because that employment growth comes from the very<br />
debt that you're talking about, doesn't it? You keep telling me<br />
that the debt is in the private sector<br />
P14: And 93 percent 93 percent of that 1.6 million new Jobs in<br />
the private sector<br />
JONES: Yeah, I know. But you keep Baying to me it's not our<br />
problem, the debt. That's because all these people are<br />
investing. But you take the credit for the jobs.<br />
PM: No. What I take the credit for is creating an environment<br />
within which we've been able to have a rate of employment growth<br />
under my Government five times as fast as under the predecessors.<br />
JONES: Can I<br />
PM: Who.. who. whose economic policies don't let's talk<br />
history their current policies for the future would mean a<br />
return to massive unemployment and massive hikes in interest<br />
rates because because, Alan, don't lets avoid it because<br />
they will have a wages explosion and they will have an interest<br />
rate explosion because they've got a six to seven billion dollar<br />
unfunded set of promises.<br />
JONES: Prime Minister, can I just show you that diagram there?<br />
There's no need for my listeners to see it,.*. e.. but the red<br />
indicates expenditure and the other colour indicates<br />
productivity.... PM: Yep.<br />
JONES: I mean,. the gap between expenditure and productivity is<br />
enormous. You can see that. We're living beyond our means.<br />
-kren't we?<br />
PM: That's precisely why you had to have high interest rates.<br />
There's a simple statistic, you don't need that. I mean, I'll<br />
give you the simple statistic. Last year, consumption increased<br />
by 8 percent, production by 4 percent and that gap of 4 percent<br />
was made up by imports. We had to lower imports, therefore,<br />
tighter monetary policy.... </p>
<p>JONES: There's a whole heap of people out there who have never<br />
imported anything in their life. And are paying interest rates<br />
at 20 percent never imported anything in their life.<br />
PHI But every person in Australia consumes an imported product.<br />
There's not a person in Australia who doesn't consume an imported<br />
product. And this is the height of stupidity, if I may say so<br />
with respect, to say you have a little group of people who import<br />
and the rest of Australia hasn't anything to do with imports.<br />
There is not one of our 17 million Australian citizens who is not<br />
an importer in terms of consuming imports. Every one of us does.<br />
And we were doing it to such a level in that last year that we<br />
could not sustain that level of imports. We had to slow the<br />
level of activity down and we've done it.<br />
JONES: Can I just refeor you to a page out of the Budget papers<br />
talk about the accord and wages. and you talk about a<br />
wages explosion this diagram shows that almost the whole of<br />
the underlying inflation rate in this country, is consumed by<br />
market wages. There's the figure and you'll notice that the<br />
lines coincide almost entirely. Don't you think our wages<br />
growth whatever you might claim the achievement of it is the<br />
wages growth is unaf fordable? Mr Keating said a couple of weeks<br />
ago that we were looking at GDP growth of what.... a GDP growth of<br />
about one and a half percent. But a wages growth of seven. I<br />
mean if you do that in a school assignment, if you did an<br />
assignment for me and it was so bad that I could only give you<br />
one and a half because that was all you were worth but I said<br />
well, don't worry about it Bob, I'll give you seven because it<br />
looks a bit better and it'll make you happier the rest of the<br />
kids would say you're a cheat. You're giving him something he<br />
hasn't earned. Now, how can we give seven percent wage growth<br />
when our gross domestic product has only likely to increase by<br />
one and a half percent?<br />
PM: Well, just let me make it quite clear and even the<br />
opposition understands this. That in the setting of wages,<br />
productivity is not the only consideration. You've got to take<br />
account of what happens to prices and you've also got to take<br />
account in this situation of what people are doing in terms of<br />
restructuring their whole award situation. And the fact is that<br />
under the seven percent wages outcome that's been negotiated in<br />
the beginning of this year, the expectation is and is accepted<br />
-by economic commentators that there will be a reduction in the<br />
rate of inflation. You've got to set the predictability of the<br />
wages outcome that we've put against the certainty against the<br />
certainty that under the policies of the Opposition there will<br />
be a wages explosion. Because what they are saying is the<br />
Government gets out, you don't have a centralised system, you<br />
just leave it for the employers and employees to fix it. So don't<br />
let's be theoretical. You know what would have happened last<br />
year under the policy of the Opposition, you would have had a </p>
<p>thirty percent increase in salaries for the pilots because they<br />
said let that happen. And once you got a thirty percent increase<br />
for the pilots, under the Opposition policy, then hey presto,<br />
happens everywhere else like it did at the beginning of the<br />
And the economy collapses<br />
JONES: You keep telling us that the union movement is very<br />
responsible. it was when you were leading it, wasn't it?<br />
PM: And it is now.<br />
JONIES. And it wouldn't prejudice jobs by seeking wage increases<br />
that weren't affordable, would it?<br />
PM You ask the head of the business organisations in this<br />
country whether or not it is a fact that what Kelty and the ACTU<br />
have been doing in the last two years is knocking back wage<br />
increases which people employers have been going to their door<br />
knocking on their door and saying we want to give the<br />
increase. The ACTU have said no, we are sticking to the accord.<br />
There would have been any amount of opportunities for the trade<br />
union movement in this country in the last few years and you<br />
know it because you've talked about it. There's been any amount<br />
of opportunities for them to take extra wage increases. They<br />
wouldn't. That's what the pilots dispute was about.<br />
JONES: Do you think, though, that<br />
PM: And if they had their way, if the Opposition had their<br />
way, that would be it. Free f or all. Pilots get their thirty<br />
percent. Everyone else says alright, the pilots have thirty<br />
percent, can we have thirty percent too?<br />
JONES: Yeah.* We've been through that and...<br />
PM: And you agreed with me.<br />
JONES: Yeah, I did agree with you about that. But that doesn't<br />
mean to say that what you're doing currently in wages policy is<br />
affordable. </p>
<p>JONES: Yes, we've been through that and-<br />
PM: And you agreed with me.<br />
JONES: Yes, I did agree with you on that but that<br />
doesn't mean to say that what you're doing currently now<br />
in wages policy is affordable. But I just want to take<br />
the point that out there I just wondered whether you<br />
shouldn't have run a campaign where you gave people<br />
nothing and said we've all got to work harder and get off<br />
our backsides. Professor Helen Hughes, whom you<br />
previously I think acknowledged knows a bit about what<br />
she's saying, she said this, not long ago, except for<br />
continuous process industries in Australia, factories<br />
typically work one shift, four and a half hour week.<br />
Your capital invested in buildings and machinery is<br />
therefore used 20% or less of the time that is available.<br />
It's idle almost 80% of the time. Over a year, taking<br />
into account public holidays which are amongst the<br />
highest in number in industrial countries, Australia's<br />
competitors in manufacturing typically work their capital<br />
50-60% of the time. Now this is what it's about isn't<br />
it. What are you going to do<br />
PM: Ok, I'll tell you what we're doing. I'll tell you<br />
what we're doing. That's very interesting. Now just<br />
give me a chance to respond to that. I'll tell you where<br />
.1 went to in the campaign. Down in Melbourne to the<br />
Pacific Dunlop new tyre factory out there in the suburbs<br />
of Melbourne. New factory, just established. Right<br />
round the clock, right round the clock they were working,<br />
with a plant which they say will have the most modern<br />
technology in the world. They sent people for 12 months<br />
-managers, workers over to the United States, brought<br />
it back, and they've got the best technology in the<br />
world. That's what's happening. I mean, and it's<br />
happening, as they acknowledge, why because of us.<br />
What did Alan Jackson just say yesterday? I'll tell you<br />
what Alan Jackson said yesterday the head of BPR Nylex<br />
-announcing his record profit. He said that's been able<br />
to be done because of this Government. This Government<br />
has created the best industrial relations environment<br />
we've ever had. And he is now not only competing in<br />
Australia but on the basis of his Australian operations<br />
is also operating overseas. We are becoming infinitely<br />
more competitive. We are having new practices, around<br />
the clock hours being worked and shifts, new attitudes<br />
both by management and workers. Now I've been I'll<br />
take you into the factories where it's happening. It's<br />
no good talking about the past because the past is the<br />
inheritance of 30 years of conservative government.<br />
We've turned it round. You haven't got a 54% increase in<br />
manufactured exports because of the past. You've got it<br />
because of the present policies of this Government.<br />
JONES: Can I use that word inheritance. Just supposing<br />
that when you've passed on, that is for everybody who<br />
passes on, you had a few assets, and including in amongst </p>
<p>them was the family house that you and Hazel had and you<br />
decided to leave that to your daughter. But she already<br />
had a home and she wanted to educate the kids so she<br />
thought well I'll sell Dad's house. She would have to<br />
pay, under your Government, a capital gains tax on that<br />
sale. Isn't that a death duty?<br />
PM: No. I wish you'd get the facts right. It applies<br />
to assets before ' 85. The situation is<br />
JONES: The house you bought before<br />
PM: There is no proposition of an inheritance tax, only<br />
a tax will apply if subsequently and then it would be<br />
JONES: ( inaudible)<br />
PM: Difference in real value<br />
JONES: Yes, sure.<br />
PM: Difference in real value between the time of the<br />
inheritance and the time<br />
JONES: Death duties.<br />
PM: It is not.<br />
JONES: Hang on. Your daughter's got her own house and<br />
Dad's house he bought in 1930.<br />
PM: She doesn't have to pay any tax at all through the<br />
fact of inheritance. A death duty is something which you<br />
know, if you know anything about economics, a death duty<br />
is something that applies<br />
JONES: ( inaudible)<br />
PM: through the fact of inheritance.<br />
JONES: Answer my question.<br />
PM: I'm answering your question. Because you're saying<br />
death duties, and you know my dear friend, you know that<br />
a death duty is something that would attract the tax<br />
through the fact of inheritance.<br />
JONES: I just want to<br />
PM: No, don't dodge me because you know you're wrong.<br />
JONES: I'm not dodging you. answering my question.<br />
PM: I'm answering your question and saying no death duty<br />
because there is no duty which is attracted through the<br />
fact of inheritance. </p>
<p>JONES: Alright, well let me change<br />
PM: Change, because you're wrong.<br />
JONES: change the emphasis.<br />
PM: You're wrong.<br />
JONES: No I'm not.<br />
PM: You said death duties. You said death duties and<br />
it's not a death duty.<br />
JONES: Let's forget the names then because we're just<br />
arguing semantics.<br />
PM: No we're not. We're arguing the fact that you said<br />
it was a death duty and you're accepting now that you're<br />
wrong. JONES: No, I'm not accepting I'm wrong.<br />
PM: It's not a death duty.<br />
JONES: I'll admit I'm wrong if I am wrong, but I just<br />
want to go back to<br />
PM: Will you accept Alan that it is not a death duty?<br />
JONES: My listeners want you to answer this question.<br />
When you and Hazel leave the house to your daughter and<br />
you bought the house in ' 35 and Roslyn decides to stay<br />
in the house she's living in now, says she doesn't want<br />
Dad's house but she needs the return from the sale of<br />
that house to educate the kids, so she says we'll sell<br />
Dad's house. Does she pay a tax on that sale?<br />
PM: Yes, she<br />
JONES: Yes or no.<br />
PM: Wait a minute. Let me answer the question. First<br />
of all, through the fact of acquiring it, she doesn't.<br />
Now if there is<br />
JONES: ( inaudible)<br />
PM: Why don't you let me finish.<br />
JONES: You said she doesn't pay any tax.<br />
PM: I'm telling you she doesn't pay any tax through the<br />
fact of inheritance. Correct?<br />
JONES: ( inaudible)<br />
PM: Alan Jones started off this proposition by saying<br />
it's a death duty. Now Alan Jones knows as well as he </p>
<p>knows anything that Alan Jones is wrong because the<br />
characteristic of a death duty is that you pay a tax, you<br />
pay a tax through the fact of inheritance.<br />
JONES: Would Roslyn pay a tax on that sale? Would she?<br />
PM: Wait a minute. When she sells it, if there is an<br />
increase in the value of the house<br />
JONES: ( inaudible)<br />
PM: inheritance and the time of sale, a real<br />
increase, not a increase, she will pay tax on that.<br />
JONES: So she is going to pay tax on that.<br />
PM: On that basis. But not through the fact of<br />
inheritance, as Alan Jones started off saying. And Alan<br />
Jones was wrong.<br />
JONES: Alright Prime Minister, you're a busy man. I<br />
S thank you for your time. I must end this by<br />
congratulating you on the fact that the campaign, the<br />
Labor Party has thrown it all into your lap. I think<br />
that there are many people out there, whether they're<br />
going to vote for you or not, think you've done a<br />
colossal job carrying the radio, television, and public<br />
presentation of the campaign. I wonder where some of<br />
those people are that were wanting to replace you twelve<br />
months ago Prime Minister. They haven't been too visible<br />
during the course of the campaign.<br />
PM: That's not too fair. If you're talking about the<br />
Treasurer in particular, he's been doing a very hard job.<br />
JONES: You've carried the most of it though haven't you?<br />
Are you tired?<br />
PM: No I'm not. I feel great actually. I feel great.<br />
SJONES: I see a report here that if you get beaten you'll<br />
want to stand for the leadership of the Opposition.<br />
PM: No, no, acutally get it right. You can't get<br />
death duties right and you can't get that one right.<br />
What I said<br />
JONES: I've established that your daughter will pay tax<br />
PM: No, no, I hope you'll read the transcript of that<br />
one and see what you said in the first place and how you<br />
had to backtrack.<br />
JONES: Leadership of the Opposition, is that a position<br />
that attracts you? </p>
<p>PM: No, not particularly, not particularly. But I<br />
simply said that if they wanted me to consider it I'd<br />
look at it. But I said I'd do no more than look at it.<br />
But it's entirely hypothetical. If you want to look at<br />
leadership, can I just share one thing with you mate.<br />
What do you think about this, where you have, in the<br />
second last week of the campaign, the leader who was<br />
dumped, John Howard, being given the opportunity down on<br />
a Melbourne talkback program, being given the opportunity<br />
to say he believed Andrew Peacock when Andrew said he<br />
didn't know anything about the push. And Don Chipp gave<br />
him the opportunity, and he refused to say he believed<br />
Andrew Peacock. Which led Chippy to say there's only one<br />
inference you can draw from your reply John and that is<br />
that you don't believe Mr Peacock. Not a bad situation<br />
is it, in the second last week of the campaign, to have<br />
John Howard in the position where he will not say that he<br />
believes what Andrew Peacock is saying. leadership<br />
on the other side.<br />
JONES: But like Vo Rogue you do have a lot of lead in<br />
0 the saddle. The people out there really are suffering<br />
aren't they, and hurting, on interest and those sorts of<br />
things, unemployment.<br />
PM: Sure, but Alan I said that in my policy speech.<br />
Some hard decisions have had to be taken but the point is<br />
that we've now got in this country Alan and I think you<br />
basically share this view we've got the building blocks<br />
for an enormous future in this country. We are getting a<br />
restructured industry. I think you'd share my pride in<br />
the fact that we are now exporting manufactured goods<br />
that we never could before. We are doing that<br />
JONES: Sydney Airport when are you going to fix up<br />
Sydney Airport? That's tourism. Millions of dollars<br />
down the drain.<br />
PM: But listen, look what's happening, the latest<br />
statistics in today's and yesterday's papers. They are<br />
coming back. They are coming back.<br />
JONES: Yes, but the potential is there and you're not<br />
realising it because some bloke in your Party holds the<br />
seat near the Airport.<br />
PM: On the contrary. Who was the bloke who said we'll<br />
take the tough decisions?<br />
JONES: But we've had enough environmental impact<br />
statements haven't we? We need an airport.<br />
PM: The work is being done. The work is being done and<br />
I've made the decision that the third runway should go<br />
ahead. We've got to it's perfectly proper that people<br />
should have the opportunity to put their position about<br />
environmental considerations. I would've thought that<br />
you'd agree with that. You just can't ride roughshod </p>
<p>over the legitimate rights of citizens to put a point of<br />
view about environmental considerations. I mean we're<br />
not getting to that sort of society where I sit up there<br />
in Canberra and say that's what the answer is and I<br />
ignore the interests of other<br />
JONES: Do you reckon if we had an interview here and you<br />
were Prime Minister in four months time we'd be talking<br />
about your decision to export more uranium?<br />
PM: Export more uranium? No we wouldn't be talking<br />
about that.<br />
JONES: We wouldn't be?<br />
PM: No we wouldn't be. I mean the fact of the matter is<br />
that with the three uranium mines we've got mate, we're<br />
battling to get a reasonable price for<br />
JONES: Do you reckon under Bob Hawke's Prime<br />
S Ministership, if it continues, that the Kakadu decision<br />
that was taken would be a firm decision or would we be<br />
sort of thinking the election's over now<br />
PM: Of course it's a firm decision.<br />
JONES: hole in the ground that Gareth Evans talked<br />
about. PM: Have you been to Kakadu?<br />
JONES: I have been to Kakadu.<br />
PM: Well I would've thought Alan you would've been on my<br />
side. JONES: your predecessor declared it part of the<br />
great national heritage.<br />
PM: He started off on the first part but then we took it<br />
ahead and we've got a position now where the successors<br />
to Malcolm Fraser would desecrate his heritage by saying<br />
that they'd have exploration in Stage II and State III.<br />
JONES: Gareth Evans called it a hole in the ground<br />
didn't he?<br />
PM: No he didn't.<br />
JONES: What did he call it?<br />
PM: He referred to some of the area as clapped out<br />
buffalo country. That was his phrase some of it, some<br />
of it. But the fact is that where they want to mine is<br />
right on the headwaters of all that water that goes into<br />
the Kakadu Park. I'll tell you what, as far as I'm<br />
concerned, if there is a doubt about mining which might </p>
<p>ruin that marvellous world heritage of Kakadu National<br />
Park, I'm coming down on the side of being careful.<br />
JONES: Professor Pennington, is he a bloke that you<br />
respect? PM: Professor Pennington, I know him, I don't know him<br />
very well.<br />
JONES: He headed up your enquiry though into the health<br />
system in 1984.<br />
PM: Yes, he was in it.<br />
JONES: He wrote a letter to The Australian recently in<br />
which he said that there needs to be a broad enquiry,<br />
that Medicare has failed, the incentives are nearly all<br />
in the wrong direction. He says rising costs, closed<br />
public beds, lengthening waiting lists, crises in<br />
critical care, lack of funding for new equipment or<br />
treatment, all illustrate the problem.<br />
PM: There are problems in the health system. No-one has<br />
ever said... But the fundamental fact is that you can<br />
have an alternative in this country. You can have a<br />
government, that is us, which has demonstrated that it<br />
can have a system which delivers health care to all<br />
Australians in an equitable way, or you can have the<br />
Opposition whose spokesman stands up and says publicly<br />
that the record, the Liberals and National Party's record<br />
in health is deplorable and I don't have to remind you in<br />
government. They cannot run the health system of this<br />
country. They have said it themselves. They said we are<br />
hopeless. And they're right.<br />
JONES: The concern out there is that you might be still<br />
in Government and these problems will persist. A caller<br />
rang me, can I just tell you this, a caller rang me<br />
earlier this week. He said he'd had quadruple by-pass<br />
surgery. The doctor's fee was $ 3500, the schedule fee<br />
$ 1385, the Medicare refund $ 1038. So he had to pay<br />
$ 2215. He's paying the levy, he's paying private health<br />
insurance. PM: And I'll tell you what the alternative is. Let that<br />
fellow have the alternative. And what you'll have in<br />
this country is a situation where millions of our fellow<br />
Australians will not be covered. They will not be<br />
getting any assistance and they'll be returned to the<br />
situation we had before where millions of Australians had<br />
hanging over their heads the threat of penury coming from<br />
doctors's bills and hospital bills.<br />
JONES: Hang on, you're a sensitive and compassionate<br />
sort of bloke. This bloke's just a day's work, he's<br />
just working. He suddenly collapses on the floor. He's<br />
had a massive heart attack and they ask him to have this<br />
quadruple by-pass surgery. The public hospital queues </p>
<p>are a mile long, he goes into the private sector, and<br />
he's up, he's got everything. He's got top of the chart<br />
insurance, he's got the Medicare levy, he's got to pay<br />
the gap and he's up for 5700 bucks. Where do you find<br />
that money? Why can't you let him insure for the gap?<br />
PM: I'll tell you what we have done and why we've done<br />
it. Why we have the system now that we do have is<br />
because in the absence of the Medicare-type system, which<br />
is universal, you will have, as we had when we came to<br />
office, two million Australians uncovered in any way,<br />
uncovered in any way. Now I ' m not prepared to do that.<br />
JONES: No, let them have that, let them have Medicare.<br />
But why don't you let this bloke insure for the gap? Why<br />
can he not insure for the difference between the schedule<br />
fee and what he's..<br />
PM: Once you start to do that you weaken the whole basic<br />
structure that we've got.<br />
0 JONES: There are queues a mile long. out of the<br />
queues. PM: Do you remember the NSW State election here? You do<br />
remember it. And do you remember what the Liberals said<br />
here before the 1988<br />
JONES: doesn't mean I do.<br />
PM: I'll tell you. Because the Liberals said, it's one<br />
of the things they got right, they said the question of<br />
hospital queues is not a matter to do with Medicare, it's<br />
a matter to do with State Government policy. That's what<br />
the Liberals of NSW said in the 1988 election. And they<br />
were right.<br />
JONES: You got part of your surplus by squeezing the<br />
States. PM: No I didn't.<br />
JONES: Yes you did.<br />
PM: And in this election campaign who's squeezing the<br />
States that mob on the other side. Mr Peacock and<br />
Hewson and Blunt are going to rip off the State of NSW<br />
another $ 122 million to pay, help to pay for their<br />
promises to put billions of dollars back into the pockets<br />
of the rich. That's what the citizens of NSW are facing<br />
in this election. From Hawke, not a cent being taken off<br />
for the grants in NSW. But under the Peacock policy,<br />
$ 122 million being taken off. I ask your citizens of<br />
NSW, your listeners, to say does that make a lot of<br />
sense, that they have a $ 122 million taken off them so<br />
that billions of dollars can be put in the pockets of<br />
Peacock's wealthy mates. </p>
<p>JONES: I know you're busy. Are you going to drive past<br />
Neutral Bay and the Oaks and have a look at all those<br />
empty PM: Yes, yes.<br />
JONES: Thanks for your time.<br />
PM: Are you going to vote for us mate?<br />
JONES: I'll vote for whom I think on the day is going to<br />
do the best job for Australia.<br />
PM: Thanks mate.<br />
JONES: Thanks for your time.<br />
ends </p>
