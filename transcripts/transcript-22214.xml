    <content><![CDATA[<p>I invite all Australians to join me this year in commemorating the 400th anniversary of the first European mapping of our coastline by visiting the replica of the 16th century Dutch ship, the Duyfken, as it stops at ports around the country.</p>
<p>The voyage honours the achievements of Willem Janszoon and his crew on the original Duyfken, or 'Little Dove', when in 1606 they charted 350km of Australia's coastline, from the western shore of Cape York to Cape KeerWeer.</p>
<p>For the next 250 years, Dutch, French, Spanish and English navigators continued to expand the world's understanding of the Australian coastline.</p>
<p> The Australian Government is the major sponsor of the 1606-2006 Duyfken Voyage, which will give all Australians an opportunity to learn more about our nation's important coastal and maritime heritage.</p>
<p>This year the Australian Government is placing a special focus on Australia's maritime history highlighting Australia's affinity with the ocean and encouraging a better appreciation of Australia's early maritime heritage.</p>
<p>  I am pleased to announce today that two of the places associated with the era of early European maritime exploration will be included in Australia's most prestigious heritage list-the National Heritage List.</p>
<p>Cape Inscription in Western Australia, where Captain Dirk Hartog landed in October 1616, and the site of the 1629 shipwreck and survivor camps of the Dutch ship Batavia, will become the 25th and 26th places on the National Heritage List</p>
<p>This 400th Anniversary of Dutch-Australian contact provides an opportunity to reflect on the strong ties between the Netherlands and Australia.</p>
<p>Today we honour all those who explored our coast and helped us create our nation.  I wish Captain Gary Wilson and Duyfken crew a safe passage on this historic voyage.</p>
