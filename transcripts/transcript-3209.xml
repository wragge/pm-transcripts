PRESS STATEMENT NO. 219<br />
8 April 1974<br />
ADJUSTMENT ASSISTANCE FOR THE DAIRY INDUSTRY<br />
The Prime Minister, Mr Whitlam, announced today<br />
that the Australian Government is prepared to invest<br />
substantially in the dairy industry during the next two<br />
years to help it towards long term stability.<br />
When it was agreed in July last to phase out the<br />
dairy bounty, this Government undertook to introduce<br />
restructuring measures which would best help the dairy<br />
industry and the smaller dairy farmer.<br />
Cabinet yesterday approved a program of assistance<br />
to the dairy industry, the cost of which could amount to<br />
the order of $ 28 million over the next two years.<br />
Later today Senator Wriedt will explain fully the<br />
details of the program. However, one important aspect I<br />
would emphasise is that loans made to cream suppliers to<br />
assist in the change over to whole milk supply will be<br />
interest free.<br />
I am confident these measures will be of great<br />
long term benefit to the dairy industry in meeting the<br />
changing world demand for dairy products.<br />
