F . PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR PRESS MARCH 24, 1976<br />
Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser and Deputy Prime Minister<br />
Doug Anthony, welcomed the fact that Goff Letts, Majority<br />
Leader of the Legislative Assembly, his Deputy Grant Tambling<br />
-and other members had come to Canberra for discuss ions.<br />
Tile discussions had b. Ieen useful and constructive coi-cerning<br />
a number of aspects of concern to Territorians and to the<br />
Legislative Assembly of the Territory.<br />
Amongst major matters discussed was the question of legislation<br />
concerning Aboriginal land rights.<br />
The Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister gave a complete<br />
and unequivocal affirmation as had the Minister for Aboriginal<br />
Affairs that there would be full and thorough consultation on all<br />
aspects of the preparation and implementation of the proposed.<br />
legislation.<br />
At the moment the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs was in the<br />
process of preparing a submission to p'it before the Government.<br />
Once the broad guidelines of that submission had been determined<br />
wide-ranging consultations would be necessary with all interested<br />
parties. Out of that consultation, detailed proposals for<br />
legislation would develop.<br />
It 5. s hoped that legislation would be introduced in the Federal<br />
Parliament in this session. It may well be tha~ t the legislation,<br />
once introduced, would require further consultation. Since this<br />
is a matter vitally important for the future development of the<br />
Northern Territory and for all people in the Northern Territory,<br />
the Commonwealth is determined that all views will be taken into<br />
account. * The possibility of complementary Territory legislation<br />
is also a matter that needs to be examined.<br />
The Commonwealth has responsibilities given to it under the<br />
Referendum concerning the future of Aboriginal people, and it<br />
cannot in any sense, abdicate from the responsibilities placed<br />
upon it by that Referendum. However, it has always been the<br />
philosophy of the Liberal and National Country Parties that<br />
problems should be approached cooperatively.<br />
We are committed to working with the States in a spirit of<br />
partnership, cind that applies equally to the Northern Territory<br />
which is destined for Statehood. We will pursue that partnership<br />
constructively. </p>
