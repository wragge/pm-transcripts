FOR PRESS: PM No. 48/ 1971<br />
DEATH OF SIR RODERICK MILLER<br />
Statement by _ the Prime Minister, Mr. William McMahon<br />
It is with regret that I learnt of the death of<br />
Sir Roderick Miller. Chairman and Managing Director of<br />
R. W. Miller ( Holdings) Limited, Sir Roderick was one<br />
of Australia's leading businessmen.<br />
Amongst other achievements Sir Roderick<br />
Miller was instrumental in revolutionising the handling<br />
of oil in the Australian coastal shipping trade.<br />
He was an outstanding Australian.<br />
Sir Roderick, a New South Wales rugby<br />
union representative, was a personal friend of mine.<br />
I extend my sincere sympathy to his widow.<br />
