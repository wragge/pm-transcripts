FOR MEDIA SUNDAY, 24 AUGUST, 1980<br />
ELECTORATE TALK<br />
Last week's Budget continues the Government's responsible<br />
approach to economic management. It consolidates the-gains<br />
of the last five years and provides a blueprint . for the<br />
development of Australia in the years ahead. Above all, it<br />
maintains the fight against inflation.<br />
Our main objective during our five years in office has been<br />
to strengthen the economic health of Australia and to provide<br />
the foundation for renewed economic growth. This has meant<br />
an unrelenting fight against inflation, which has required<br />
hard decisions. Unlike Labor we have been and are -willing<br />
to face up to reality and take those decisions.<br />
The fact that this Budget will achieve a balanced domestic<br />
position is a landmark in Australia's economic recoveryr. No<br />
longer is Australia living beyond its means. We have paid off<br />
Labor's debts.<br />
This Budget the first of our Budgets for the 80s squarely<br />
faces up to the challenges that the decade will hold. Above<br />
all, it provides a base for the continuing growth and expansion<br />
of industry and for the development of our great natural<br />
resources. It is essential'that growth should open up<br />
opportunities for all Australians to share in these developments.<br />
There is no merit in development for development's sake. -But<br />
the reason my Government encourages development is that it<br />
enables more Australians to have lasting and decent jobs; it<br />
enables more families to pursue their own future in their own<br />
way; it also gives Governments the resources to provide the<br />
kind of care and concern for those people most in need.<br />
Let's not Jforc-et that Australia's greatest natural resource is<br />
the people of Australia. There is simply no point in development<br />
and growth unless all sections of the community, particularly.<br />
the disadvantaged, the handicapped, the elderly, the young<br />
and the sick, are able to share in its benefits.<br />
We believe that together with voluntary organisations, Governments<br />
have an obligation to help those least able to help themselves.<br />
Almost $ 10,000 million-is earmarked this year for social security<br />
and welfare programmes. This is a 12.4 per cent increase over<br />
last year. </p>
<p>2<br />
Some of the increased welfare payments in this year's Budget<br />
include: the handicapped child's allowance will be increased by<br />
$ 8 to $ 73 a month. The double orphan's pension will be<br />
increased by $ 8 to over $ 55 a month;<br />
the additional pension or benefit payable to eligible<br />
persons with dependent chilren will be increased by<br />
$ 2.50 to $ 10.00 a week for each child. About 560,000<br />
children will benefit as a result;<br />
single oensioners it children and supporting<br />
parent beneficiaries will receive an additional S2 a wa; er.<br />
About 190,000 single parent families will benefit,<br />
the six month waiting period for the supporting parent's<br />
benefit will be removed, providing benefits for an<br />
additional 15,000 or more supporting parents.<br />
As we all know, Australia is to the forefront in many areas of<br />
science and medicine. Our researchers have achieved the highest<br />
levels of excellence and international recognition. We believed<br />
that there was a need to encourage further that outstanding<br />
work. To meet that need, Budget outlays for medical research<br />
were increased by 30%, and the allocation for the Australian<br />
Institute of Marine Science has been increased by over<br />
Here we had particular regard to the obligations in relation to<br />
the Great Barrier Reef and to the need to learn more about the<br />
200 mile economic zone which is of such imoontance tO us.<br />
The Budget was framed in a period of heightened world tension.<br />
Soviet power play around the world has meant an increased<br />
obligation on Australia as an independent and middle-ranking<br />
power and indeed on all democratic countries to upgrade<br />
our defence preparedness. We have increased defence spending<br />
by over $ 500 million, or 7% in real terms. Much of this<br />
increased vote will be spent in Australia on purchases and<br />
equipment made within Australia. Our objective is to lift<br />
capital equipment expenditure to about 25% of the total defence<br />
budget. While these funds would have had to be provided for defence<br />
in any case, the increased Government revenues from our oil<br />
pricing policy have certainly assisted us in meeting this<br />
particular object√± e. in additcn, those reen.. s are also<br />
making possible the tax cuts of over $ 600 million which applied<br />
from 1 July this year, and which is very much an integral part<br />
of our total budgetary approach. The oil revenues also<br />
assisted in helping us to reduce the deficit. These are three<br />
important objectives.<br />
The 1980-81 Budget demonstrates our integrity as economic<br />
managers. We have refused to enter into a public auction for<br />
votes with the taxpayers' money. There is no way we will follow<br />
Labor down that path. / 3 </p>
<p>3<br />
This is a Budget of responsibility; a Budget of stability;<br />
a Budget which enables all Australians to be confident in<br />
their individual and national capacity. And, above all, it is<br />
a Budget of compassion and conern; a Budget which promotes<br />
the economic health and continuing economic strength of this<br />
country. It will further assist in making our economy the<br />
envy of many around the world. It is a Budget in which, I<br />
believe, we have discharged our responsibilities to all<br />
Australians with fairness and with honour;<br />
