PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR PRESS NOVEMBER 4, 1976<br />
MESSAGE TO MR CARTER<br />
The following is the text of a message sent to Mr Carter,<br />
President Elect of the United States, by the Prime Minister<br />
today. It gives me great pleasure to offer my personal congratulations<br />
and those of the Government and people of Australia, on your<br />
election as President of the United States.<br />
Australians recognise the great responsibilities that rest upon<br />
the United States, and in particular, the responsibilities that<br />
rest upon the President. In your statement on foreign policy,<br />
you have expressed a keen appreciation of the many challenges<br />
that confront democratic nations. In meeting these challenges<br />
much will depend on the attitudes and decisions of the United<br />
States.<br />
The Australian and American peoples have many aspirations in<br />
common. We-are democratic and free nations. We have many<br />
similar values and objectives. We both recognise that we<br />
live in an . unsettled and uneasy world where much remains to<br />
be done. Australians are very much aware of their own<br />
responsibilities to work towards a just and peaceful world.<br />
While pre-eminent responsibilities rest upon the'United States<br />
as the most powerful of all the free countries, we believe<br />
there is much that a country such as Australia can contribute.<br />
As I indicated when I spoke to you from New York during my visit to<br />
the United States, Australia stands ready to discuss areas where<br />
our policies are inter-related. When we spoke on that occasion,<br />
you asked Australia's position on a number of foreign policy<br />
matters. The Australian Government looks forward to further<br />
discussing our views with your Administration and in working<br />
with the United States in our common search for a world where<br />
all people can live with dignity and self-respect.<br />
My warmest personal regards, Malcolm Fraser. </p>
