    <content><![CDATA[<p>I am very pleased today to announce a further $4 million for the restoration of the historic Fort Scratchley site.</p>
<p>This extra funding brings the Australian Government's commitment to almost $10 million and will ensure the site is restored in a manner that befits its special place in Australia's military history.</p>
<p>The Fort was built in the late 1800s in response to fears of Russian naval attacks on Newcastle and fired on a Japanese midget submarine in 1942.</p>
<p>It is listed on Commonwealth Heritage Register and is a prominent historic landmark and popular tourist attraction at the eastern end of Newcastle Peninsula. The site includes fortifications, gun pits, magazines, underground tunnels and open areas. </p>
<p>In 2004, the Australian Government and the Newcastle City Council executed an agreement for the Commonwealth to restore Fort Scratchley with Commonwealth funding for the restoration capped at $5.51 million. </p>
<p>The Council allocated $400,000 for restoration and refurbishment works.</p>
<p>Vandalism and the requirement for more extensive site decontamination and remediation, has meant the overall project costs have escalated over time. </p>
<p>I am also pleased to announce today that the Australian Government has signed a contract for the restoration with Kane Constructions Pty Ltd and expects these works to commence before the end of May. Completion is scheduled for early 2008.</p>
<p>I would encourage the Newcastle City Council to continue to work with the Australian Government to ensure this restoration project is a success.  </p>
