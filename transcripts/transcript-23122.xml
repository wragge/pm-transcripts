    <content><![CDATA[<p>The opening of the South Australian Health and Medical Research Institute in Adelaide will advance research in key areas such as Indigenous health and cancer.</p>
<p>The Institute will significantly increase Australiaâs capacity for world leading scientific research by bringing together a team of more than 600 researchers in world class facilities.</p>
<p>It will be a key feature of the South Australian Health and Biomedical Precinct which includes the new Royal Adelaide Hospital, the Adelaide University Medical School and the University of South Australia Cancer Research Centre.</p>
<p>The Institute benefitted from Federal Government funding of $200 million during the construction phase.</p>
<p>The Institute specialises in Indigenous health, cancer, nutrition and metabolism, infection and immunity, heart health, mind and brain; and healthy mothers, babies and children.</p>
<p>I congratulate the Instituteâs Board of Directors and Chairman on the opening of what will surely become a great asset to Adelaide, the country and, indeed, the world.</p>
