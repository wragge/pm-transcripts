    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Federal Coalition will contribute $20 million toward the cost of upgrading the Bucketts Way, the 158 kilometre road that connects Raymond Terrace, north of Newcastle, with Gloucester, Wingham and Taree.</p>
<p>The upgrade of the Bucketts Way is part of the Coalitionâs future action plan for transport in this region. Only the Coalition has an integrated plan to improve our regional roads. Only the Coalition has the plans, the experience and the people to make the hard decisions that Australia needs.</p>
<p>The Bucketts Way is the principal transport route for Gloucester and its surrounding districts. It provides access to the Barrington Tops National Park, and is used by tourists as an alternative to the Pacific Highway.</p>
<p>The roadâs condition does not match its significance. The road is rough, narrow, and its shoulder width is generally inadequate. It has too many pavement defects, such as potholes, and has half the number of safe overtaking opportunities that are normally required. There have been 790 accidents on the road over five years, including 4 fatal accidents and 154 cases of serious injury.</p>
<p>The Coalitionâs decision to upgrade the Bucketts Way was only possible because of the hard work and strong advocacy of Liberal and National Party candidates for Paterson, Bob Baldwin and Ian Shaw.</p>
<p>The Coalition will contribute $20 million over four years toward the cost of upgrading the road to an acceptable standard, which has been estimated at $66 million. The road is already receiving about $10 million in funding, including $1.6 million from the Federal Black Spots program and $2 million from the Gloucester, Great Lakes and Taree councils. The remaining cost will need to be contributed by the New South Wales Government.</p>
<p>The region will also benefit from the Coalitionâs $1.2 billion Roads to Recovery Program, which is helping local authorities upgrade their roads. The region will receive $8.8 million in Roads to Recovery funding over four years.</p>
<p>The Coalition Governmentâs contribution to the Bucketts Way will be drawn from the existing roads program.</p>
