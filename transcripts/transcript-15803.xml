    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Australian Government today announced a range of new development assistance measures for our nearest neighbour Papua New Guinea.</p>
<p>The measures announced by the Australian Government today will:</p>
<p>     * Assist PNG in its fight against the spread of HIV/AIDs</p>
<p>     * Help PNG work towards meeting its Millennium Development Goals on health and education</p>
<p>     * Build better roads</p>
<p>     * Develop sporting facilities to encourage young people to participate in sport</p>
<p>The fight against HIV/AIDs</p>
<p>The Australian Government will provide increased funding to help fight the spread of HIV/AIDS in Papua New Guinea.</p>
<p>The Australian Government will commit $13 million to NGOs working across Papua New Guinea with people affected by HIV/AIDS.</p>
<p>NGOs working in this field who will receive support will include Save the Children, Anglicare and World Vision.</p>
<p>AusAID projections for Papua New Guinea on HIV/AIDS infection rates out to 2025 are alarming. There are currently between 40,000 and 60,000 people with HIV/AIDS:</p>
<p>     * a “business as usual” response will result in half a million cases by 2025;</p>
<p>     * a strengthened response will result in 350,000 cases by 2025; and</p>
<p>     * a heightened response through education, prevention and management will result in 220,000 cases by 2025.</p>
<p>This funding boost will allow NGOs to continue working on awareness programs, prevention, treatment and counselling for people living and working in areas most affected by HIV/AIDs.</p>
<p>Helping PNG meet its Millennium Development Goals</p>
<p>The Australian Government will increase overall aid funding to PNG by up to $25 million in 2008-09. This funding will go to education, health, law and justice support and incentive based payments.</p>
<p>These new funds will be targeted at upgrading schools, doing more in the fight against malaria, and doing more to maintain and upgrade key roads.</p>
<p>Incentive based payments will offer the possibility of more funding once jointly agreed performance criteria are met. These funds could then be used by the Government of PNG for further work in areas such as infrastructure. This is one of the ideas at the heart of the Pacific Partnerships for Development announced yesterday in the Port Moresby Declaration  -  mutual responsibility.</p>
<p>Building better roads</p>
<p>The Australian Government will release $25 million for the maintenance of the Highlands Highway, a vital link for trade and commerce. This funding is being released following the PNG Government's commitment of $87.8 million through the Key Roads for Growth Maintenance Project.</p>
<p>The joint funding arrangement reflects the shared commitment of the Australian and PNG Governments to this important infrastructure project.</p>
<p>Encouraging sport</p>
<p>The Australian Government today announced a series of programs to help develop sport in Papua New Guinea  -  particularly Rugby League.</p>
<p>A new $260,000 package will be targeted at enhancing facilities at sports grounds and providing equipment such as boots, jumpers and shorts. The Government will provide $50,000 to help around 2000 young players meet the registration costs for playing football.</p>
<p>The Government has also agreed to a request for the Australian Rugby League to use the title “Prime Minister's XIII” for a match against the PNG national team the Kumlus.</p>
<p>The Australian Government wants to give a real boost to sport in PNG. Helping provide young people with access to sporting facilities and organised sporting activities is a good way for us to send messages about fitness and good health among young people.</p>
