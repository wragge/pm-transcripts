I wanted to make three observations about what we've achieved since the last the last summit and three observations about what I think we need to achieve for the future.</p>
<p>Since the last summit I am able to report that Australia has honoured the three commitments we made.</p>
<p>We have ratified the Nuclear Terrorism Convention and as we've taken that action in our own country we've also furthered work to assist with nuclear security and research that enables medical isotopes to be obtained using low enriched uranium, rather than highly enriched uranium and as a result, not have a need for highly enriched uranium for our own purposes for medicine.</p>
<p>We've also been at the forefront of developing forensic science to enable the detection of illicit nuclear materials.</p>
<p>The second commitment that we made was to work within our region on nuclear security and I am able to advise that we are bringing together a meeting in Australia for the countries of our region to discuss nuclear security questions.</p>
<p>And third, in keeping with the commitments we made in Washington, we are having an independent IAEA review of our own nuclear facility, which is at Lucas Heights in Australia.</p>
<p>Mr President, as we move towards the next summit I wanted to offer three reflections on things that I believe we need to consider.</p>
<p>We will attend the next summit in the Netherlands in 2014, but at that summit I think we need to agree what will sustain these efforts beyond 2014, what will make a focus on nuclear security a permanent feature of what we do.</p>
<p>In that regard, I would suggest that in 2014, and as we move towards that meeting, we need to consider the following three things: We need to determine how we can further empower the International Atomic Energy Agency to continue its important work beyond 2014.</p>
<p>Secondly, I think we need to establish an accountability framework on nuclear security that builds confidence beyond 2014.</p>
<p>In that regard, one thing that we might consider would be regular peer reviews of our domestic nuclear security arrangements that would ensure ongoing transparency and keep each of us, and all of us, on our toes, which is where we should be as we deal with this challenge.</p>
<p>And third, I think we should find mechanisms to foster co-operation between governments and the private sector.</p>
<p>There are major corporations who play a role in the nuclear industry and to the extent that we can further collaboration with them, then I think we would further our ambitions for nuclear security.</p>
<p>Thank you very much Mr President for this opportunity and for once again being in Korea. Thank you. </p>
