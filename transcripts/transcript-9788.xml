TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P. J. KEATING MP<br />
INTERVIEW WITH RICHARD UTTING, RADIO 6WF, PERTH,<br />
OCTOBER 1995<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
RU: Prime Minister, how are you?<br />
PM: I'm good Richard, thanks.<br />
RU: Now, this poll in today's Age and I think all the polls are showing that<br />
the Coalition is enjoying a substantial lead over the Government.<br />
PM: Some do, I mean the Morgan poll had us two party preferred<br />
yesterday, 52 for the Coalition and 48 for Labor. That is only four<br />
votes the difference, that is two to change changes all that. The<br />
Newspoll today had us up two to 39, the thing about them is in<br />
quantitative terms they are pretty unreliable and they give you some<br />
hint of the directions really, only. I think governments are never in<br />
front during the life of a parliament or rarely.<br />
RU: Now, the last election campaign was you went in trailing and everyone<br />
was writing you off then, were you trailing then as much as you are<br />
now and the same time?<br />
PM: By a bigger margin, but I said the other day in an television interview, I<br />
mean the place I want to be and this is one out and one back. I<br />
couldn't think of anything worse than going into an election campaign<br />
in front because what happens is everybody wants to drag you back. I<br />
am happy to have Mr Howard in front, that's where I had Dr Hewson.<br />
RU: Yes, well Dr Hewson had what they have termed the longest suicide<br />
note in history.<br />
PM: He is now in a Merchant Bank somewhere.<br />
e </p>
<p>RU: But, do you have the same advantage, I mean John Howard is as they<br />
say occupying the porcupine position rolling himself up into a ball,<br />
making a very small target of himself.<br />
PM: Gradually the policies are coming out. Andrew Robb their Federal<br />
Director said on the Sunday program on Channel Nine two Sundays<br />
ago, they had 98 per cent of their policies prepared. If they have got<br />
98 per cent of their policies prepared, why aren't they showing them to<br />
the Australian people. They are saying ' oh look, we are hiding them<br />
from Mr Keating'. But, they are not hiding them from me, they are<br />
hiding them from you, they are hiding them from your listeners, they<br />
are hiding them from the public in general and what other basis of<br />
credibility or morality in their politics can there be without showing<br />
what your policies are. The public are entitled to expect from major<br />
political leaders the policy directions, where they would take the<br />
country. Mr Howard has got all these nasty views but he thinks that<br />
the public won't like them so he will slip them in three days before the<br />
election or a week before the election or if he can get away with it not<br />
at all. By contrast, everything the government does is explained and is<br />
in the public domain the budgets, the accords, the republic structure,<br />
the native title act, you name it and it is all out there but they are not.<br />
Under pressure he is now letting a bit out to keep himself credible. A<br />
week ago on Mascot Airport in Sydney, which in a sense if you live in<br />
Perth you'd say ' well why does it matter. What mattered about it was<br />
this, he has been saying ' the government has taken Australia so far,<br />
but we are the sort of tough cookies who will crack the tough nuts'<br />
you know, waterfront, ports, airports the biggest micro economic<br />
reform in the infrastructure of Australian airports is the third runway at<br />
Mascot. It is the gateway to Australia. He wants to cut its capacity by<br />
per cent because it is affecting-a few people in his own seat. He<br />
has got a margin of three per cent, he says he thinks he can beat me<br />
at an election and become Prime Minister, but he is actually worried<br />
about losing his own seat.<br />
The other thing we squeezed him out on was industrial relations. On<br />
industrial relations he makes clear where he stands and last night he<br />
said ' changes to Australia's industrial relations system are the key to<br />
solving Australia's twin problems of high debt and high unemployment'.<br />
He said he was ' a believer in capitalism and the profit motive, we<br />
should be talking about reducing the costs of doing business.' Now, all<br />
that can only mean cuts in wages. He runs around saying he supports<br />
Australian families, but everytime he says it I think Australians should<br />
ask themselves how do you support Australian families on low wages<br />
without job security. So, he is getting a few things out and we are<br />
starting to see the same sort of line, he is running the same line that<br />
Mr Kierath is running here in Western Australia. Basically, hop into<br />
working people and rip their wages down while crying crocodile tears<br />
on television about them. </p>
<p>RU: Have you identified industrial relations as being one of the key areas<br />
leading up to this next election whenever it may be?<br />
PM: I think it is because this sort of view about making capitalism affluent,<br />
to have people engage in a dog eat dog struggle in society which is, I<br />
think, the gist of it, in other words you rip and tear at the bottom end of<br />
the labour market for every dollar you can get. I don't think we want a<br />
dog eat dog society, I don't think we want Australians scrubbing<br />
around for low paid jobs without security, we don't want as the<br />
Americans have an army of working poor. And do you notice by the<br />
way, Richard, the Pope refused to see the republican leadership,<br />
Gingrich and Bob Dole and he refused to see them, I think, if we can<br />
believe the reports because he thinks that the gap between rich and<br />
poor in the United States is too great. You saw that member of the<br />
British Conservative Party resign to say he was going to support the<br />
Labour Party this week in Britain robbing Mr Major of a further vote in<br />
his slim margin in the House of Commons and he said there was no<br />
regard in the Party for the interests of working people.<br />
Now, these are all the policies John Howard and Keirath and their ilk<br />
support. The Pope has made a strong statement, I think, saying I've<br />
not come to America to cuddle up to people who are trying to,<br />
essentially, push working people asunder, divide the country and have<br />
no compassion about them.<br />
When John Howard said last night that changes in the Australian<br />
industrial relations system were key to solving the problems of<br />
unemployment and debt, that he was believer in capitalism and the<br />
profit motive, let me quote him we should be talking about reducing<br />
the costs of doing business Now, every business person you speak<br />
to Richard, you can talk to the major companies or the smaller ones,<br />
they'll say labour costs in Australia are not a problem. We are hugely<br />
competitive abroad, our labour costs are not really an issue. I was in a<br />
plant in Melbourne a week or so ago, in a business which is competing<br />
abroad and the Manager said to me " where we have got such a margin<br />
Mr Keating, he said, is that the labour costs here are so competitive<br />
with our competitors. The technology is about the same, but the<br />
labour costs are good" and he said " it really puts us in with a chance."<br />
What Howard is talking about, in reducing the costs of doing business<br />
is just code for ripping wages down, yet at the same time he wants to<br />
disingenuously talk about Australian families. He says he believes in<br />
families as if, of course, the rest of don't, he believes in families but he<br />
doesn't believe in family support. This sort of hard hearted view that<br />
the strong take the wealth and the devil take the hind most, which is<br />
the Gingrich/ Dole view of the world, the Pope said not for me, I'm not<br />
going to glorify this view by meeting you. But this is the view that<br />
Howard has. </p>
<p>RU: Perhaps you might need to get the Pope to Australia because I<br />
suppose one of the problems that you are facing is that you have been<br />
in power for 13 years now, don't you think that is your biggest<br />
handicap?<br />
PM: Yes, but one problem we are not facing and that is an immoral position<br />
on society. A position about dividing society, I mean, this Party<br />
believes in a good social wage. Australia is a cohesive, good society,<br />
we have got high employment growth because the Government has<br />
focussed on employment. We have had strong growth in household<br />
disposable income disposable income of Australian households,<br />
Richard, has risen by 40 per cent since 1983. Forty per cent in real<br />
terms since 1983. We have got Medicare sitting there, basically giving<br />
access and equity in health, you've got now massive participation rates<br />
in secondary school which we didn't have 10 years ago. These are the<br />
things that bind a society together, but this sort of snaky, rich view that<br />
the millionaires are not doing well enough and we have got to send the<br />
All Ordinaries Index not from 2150 but to 2500. You know in America I<br />
think I have got this number right, but if I haven't got it exactly right it is<br />
like this, in the last decade 70 per cent of the incremental wealth in the<br />
American economy has gone to three per cent of the population. How<br />
can they defend that? America is a tinderbox, you can see it in the O. J<br />
Simpson trial, you can see it in the riots in Los Angeles, it is a<br />
tinderbox because the poor are getting poorer and when the US<br />
Secretary of Labour Robert Reich, the Minister for Labour comes out<br />
and said ' look, yes we have had plenty of employment growth in<br />
America, but we have falling real wages, we've got an army of working<br />
poor'. This is the model that John Howard wants for Australia. What<br />
we say is that is why there has to be a no disadvantage test, you can<br />
have enterprise bargaining and flexibility but you can't reduce the<br />
package of the working person.<br />
RU: Allright, now wouldn't the proper thing to do then rather than to<br />
speculate what John Howard may or may not be about.<br />
PM: I'm not speculating, he said it last night. I just quoted you.<br />
RU: You are drawing conclusions from it perhaps some uncharitable<br />
people, some cynics might say. If you called an election now to get rid<br />
of the uncertainty, to flush out his policies then we could all see what<br />
they are.<br />
PM: Why doesn't he just do the moral thing that leaders, he says he<br />
believes he has a position such that he can lead Australia, let's have<br />
a look at them. Let's get the policies out there. This sort of sneaky<br />
stuff, wait until the last three weeks of the campaign and then try to<br />
put them out so that they don't get adequate scrutiny and we can sort<br />
of slip under the wire unnoticed. Haven't we got past that. Can I just </p>
<p>say also, did you see him the other day on foreign affairs and<br />
defence because you see, as we squeeze the tube a little bit of paste<br />
comes out the end. Sometimes he has to give a bit out to remain<br />
barely credible and what was he saying, he made a speech that<br />
Harold Holt could have made. Now, in the last decade, take HMAS<br />
Stirling here, we've given Australia an east and west coast defence<br />
base, we have now built Stirling into the major naval defence base,<br />
we have taken the tanks from Puckapunyal in Victoria where the<br />
Liberals had them. I don't know what they thought, we were going to<br />
be attacked from Antarctica? And we put them into northern Australia<br />
with the big airbases at Tindal and other places. He made a speech<br />
the other day that Harold Holt could have made, it basically said, and<br />
let me quote him, he said ' unresolved tensions between the<br />
Government's focus on the defence partnership that is with<br />
Indonesia, Singapore, Malaysia et cetera and they are exercising in<br />
Australia unresolved tensions between the Governments focus on<br />
the defence partnership with the region versus the region as a<br />
potential source of threats'. In other words, what he is saying is<br />
you've got these people down like Kingaroo 95 doing the exercises<br />
with them, but they might be the enemy. What we should do, he said,<br />
is rebalance our policy and move closer to the United States. In<br />
other words to say to the US well here we are, we can't defend<br />
ourselves, the neighbourhood we are suspicious of it. Basically, they<br />
are sort of enemies there. So, instead of going out in the 90s as I<br />
am doing, engaging Indonesia, engaging Vietnam. When the leader<br />
of Vietnam came here 6 weeks ago, Do Moi, John Howard wouldn't<br />
meet him, refused to meet him. He went back 2 days later and sat<br />
down in a meeting in Hanoi with the US Secretary of State, Warren<br />
Christopher. He was good enough for Warren Christopher to meet,<br />
but not good enough for John Howard to meet. He won't engage<br />
them he says let me have the stewardship of the Asian relationship,<br />
but you have got to say to yourself, well, how could we let you have it,<br />
John, you have still got a sort of 60s view of the world. I mean, he's<br />
still re-fighting the Vietnam War. I mean, he is suspicious of<br />
Indonesia, he's suspicious of Malaysia, he's suspicious of Vietnam,<br />
and you want to be cuddling up to the Yanks.<br />
RU: For all of that, I mean, that's a marvellous election speech, isn't it?<br />
PM: No. No.<br />
RU: A marvellous election speech.<br />
PM: No, it isn't let me just correct you. It's about the first responsibility of<br />
any Australian Government, to the security of its people. And if<br />
Howard believes that he can't engage the region we live in, what<br />
hope would he have of leading Australia. That's what it's about. I<br />
mean, gradually Richard, you're right in your comments he hasn't<br />
got the policies into place, but the little bits he has got out there his </p>
<p>6<br />
gutlessness on Mascot airport, you know, that weakness, the sabrerattling<br />
Harold Holt type speech of last week, last night again about<br />
trying to hop into working people, but not saying you know, in a<br />
sneaky not saying exactly that he will cut their wages. This sort of<br />
weak and sneaky stuff, I think, has got nothing going for it.<br />
RU: You use words like weak, sneaky, gutless and so on don't you really<br />
think you are bringing political debate down to the gutter?<br />
PM: No. They call me a liar, he calls me a liar every day of the week<br />
every day of the week. I have got his party president running around<br />
saying I am one of the richest people in Australia that I have entered<br />
public life for my own personal benefit. I mean, the stuff I have got<br />
Senator Baume in the Senate attacking me every day. I mean, I get<br />
questioned about what's being spent at The Lodge every day of the<br />
week I mean, it's just outrageous what they do. I mean, I'm talking<br />
about his policies, I'm not talking about his personal life, as he does<br />
about me. I'm talking about his policies defence and foreign affairs,<br />
wages these are all legitimate issues. I mean, it is gutless to say<br />
that we will cut the capacity of Mascot airport by 35% in the gateway<br />
to the country, which affects then the ongoing flights to Perth,<br />
Melbourne, Brisbane etc, because he thinks he might lose his margin<br />
of 3.5% in the seat of Bennelong. Because in 1989 he supported<br />
building the runway. So, the first bit of pressure he gets he gets a<br />
little bit of pressure and what does he do? He caves in. They're<br />
about legitimate public issues.<br />
RU: Well, let's talk about a public issue that has been winding down in<br />
Perth, I suppose, and that's the Easton Royal Commission. If you're<br />
a betting person, you might think that could well come down with an<br />
adverse finding against Dr Carmen Lawrence, your Health Minister.<br />
Would that make any difference to your support for Dr Lawrence?<br />
PM: No. The Commission is completely discredited. I mean, I think Mr<br />
Marquet hit the nail on the head the Clerk of the Upper house<br />
when he said in his evidence I don't know if it was well publicised<br />
here that what he said was it would have been improper for Carmen<br />
Lawrence to have required on a Party basis Mr Haviland not to<br />
present Mr Easton's petition. That any person has the right to<br />
petition the Houses of Parliament. I mean, any one of your listeners<br />
that has a grievance can put a petition to that House of Parliament,<br />
and it's the duty of MP's to put those petitions. Whether they agree<br />
with its content, or act upon, it's their duty to put them. But, what was<br />
argued implicitly in the Terms of Reference drafted by Mr Court, was<br />
that, you know, she should have stopped this, Of course, after Mr<br />
Masters and Mr Lightfoot raised on her behalf for 2 years earlier,<br />
all these issues in the West Australian Parliament. In fact, Mr<br />
Masters quite I think it was Mr Masters said on Perth radio about 4<br />
weeks ago, quite brazenly, oh yes he said, I said to penny, look I </p>
<p>raised these issues, and do you really think I should do more? And<br />
she said oh yes, I'm sure I'm right on this, so you get back in there.<br />
They did this for 2 years, and then drafted the Terms of Reference<br />
only around Haviland's presentation of the other side of the family's<br />
interests. So, you know, what can you make of it?<br />
And here we have the West Australian today talking about Wanneroo,<br />
and here's Richard Court who wants a full, public $ 5 million<br />
extravaganza on Carmen Lawrence, trying to cover up this Wanneroo<br />
Inc issue and the West Australian, let me quote from this, this is<br />
from the editorial, and I don't normally quote from West Australian<br />
editorials, it's not my favourite paper, but it says this: " People will not<br />
be satisfied that the inquiry has got to the bottom of the allegations of<br />
corruption in the city of Wanneroo in the 1980s, unless it is covered<br />
by privilege and open to the public. The longer Mr Court<br />
procrastinates over giving the Kyle Inquiry the powers of a Royal<br />
Commission, the more he will fuel the perception he has something to<br />
hide". And I also notice the is it the Chancellor of the University<br />
saying..<br />
RU: I think it's Murdoch.<br />
PM: Murdoch University saying that's Peter Boyce saying there were<br />
already too many Royal Commissions in Australia, but the serious<br />
allegations surrounding Wanneroo Inc warranted some form of full an<br />
public inquiry. So, Mr Court's rancid duplicity on this I mean, he is<br />
always up there speaking in pious tones, but, you know, this was put<br />
on basically to cover the stink that was going on in the Western<br />
Australian Liberal Party. Here's Noel Crichton-Browne trying to get<br />
in, here's Withers saying that he was expelled in terms which were<br />
dubious, you have got Fred Chaney talking about funding the thugs,<br />
the political thuggery in the Party, " rather greasy and sleazy", he<br />
says, " I would say the circumstance where the Liberal Party can't<br />
conduct its affairs honestly and in a principled way, why should<br />
people want to contribute to The Lawrence inquiry was put on to<br />
smother that fight. Now, I mean, I think he is going to be hoisted on<br />
his own petard, Premier Court. That is, he can't continue with the<br />
Wanneroo Inquiry without it giving appropriate protection to the<br />
witnesses. So, you know, I mean one bad act begets another. And<br />
it was a bad thing to do the Easton Inquiry was a bad act,<br />
essentially, by a Premier who wanted to inflict personal damage on<br />
an opponent he had already beaten. I mean, not content to have won<br />
the election against Carmen Lawrence, he wanted to destroy her<br />
personally. He's a very nasty person, Court.<br />
RU: All right. Now, can I move on I have been saying these questions<br />
from some of our listeners, but one other question if we've got time<br />
for just a couple of other quick ones when we, can we expect the </p>
<p>emu and kangaroo to grace our Coat of Arms instead of the lion and<br />
the unicorn? That's not a bad question.<br />
PM; In Western Australia?<br />
RU: Anywhere.<br />
PM: Well, there's an emu and a kangaroo on the national crest, which is<br />
rather appropriate. I'm not sure about Western Australia it's got a<br />
swan somewhere there, I think. There are swans around here.<br />
RU: I suppose implicit in that is the whole idea of the republican debate,<br />
which seems to have gone to the backburner. Now, you raise this...<br />
PM: Can I just say from my point, not at all, but go on sorry.<br />
PM: But this is something you ran on very strongly some time ago do you<br />
see, at the next election, whenever it may be, that the republican<br />
issue will be one that needs to be thoroughly addressed by both<br />
parties?<br />
PM: Oh, absolutely. And what I have done is laid down a blueprint for an<br />
Australian republic. You see, again let me just take the chance on<br />
this to reinforce a point I made earlier I didn't say wink, wink, nudge,<br />
nudge I think we need a republic, But I won't give you the details. I<br />
put down a speech in the House of Representatives, you know, the<br />
people's House, on television, the whole framework for an Australian<br />
republic. What did Mr Howard do? He slipped and slided for 3 days,<br />
and then said oh look, I don't believe in a republic myself but if I<br />
were elected, I would put a republic referendum if people wanted me<br />
to, but at that referendum, I would vote for the monarchy. Well<br />
Richard, you know this to get any Constitutional change through in<br />
Australia, the Government has got to be going flat out for it. So,<br />
effectively, there is only one Party that will give Australia a republic,<br />
and that's the Labor Party. because for a Coalition Government to<br />
say look, we promised you that we would put a referendum on the<br />
republic, but you know this would be Mr Howard I'm in favour of<br />
keeping the monarchy, so, have a vote on it. You have got a majority<br />
of electors in a majority of States to pass it, so effectively, what he<br />
said is there will be no republic under the Coalition. And what I'm<br />
saying is there will be a republic under the Labor Party we will put<br />
the referendums, and we have already put the structure down.<br />
But how can we make our way I mean, this goes back to his whole<br />
view of the world how can we make our way with these old societies<br />
like Indonesia, 190 million people, South East Asia, Malaysia,<br />
Thailand, Vietnam, the Philippines, these sort of countries, and at the<br />
same time saying here is Australia, a unique and important nation, a<br />
country with a unique culture, that is a partner in the region, but by </p>
<p>the way, our Head of State is the Queen of Great Britain. I mean, the<br />
Queen I have a great regard for the Queen, and the monarchy<br />
works fine in Britain, this is not about the Queen it's about the ability<br />
of Australia to express its sovereignty in full. That's what it's about.<br />
And, you see, but John Howard isn't interested in the region he<br />
thinks, essentially, Indonesia is still a threat. He thinks the<br />
Vietnamese are still a threat. And he would head straight for the<br />
White House. If I was an American President, if another Leader<br />
turned up as a mendicant, you would have to say oh God, not another<br />
one. Not another one coming asking us to defend them. Not another<br />
one. You see, what the Americans know with a Labor Government<br />
you can see it with Stirling, you can see it with Tindal, you can see it<br />
with bases in the North, you can see it in engagement with Asia, you<br />
can see it with APEC they know we are out there doing a job, and its<br />
one that they can identify with, and support. That's the sort of ally<br />
they want.<br />
RU: Right. Well, Paul Keating, we have to leave it there. You're not<br />
going to tell us give us any hint about this election, and....<br />
PM: Richard, can I say about a year after the last election, John Hewson<br />
was saying the Prime Minister is going to take us to an early election,<br />
and that went on for months. And then Mr Downer got the job, and in<br />
the first flush of his victory over others, when he came up in the polls,<br />
he said the Prime Minister is going to take us to an early election he<br />
was hoping he would get an early election. Then Mr Howard got it<br />
and said the same. When the Government produced a surplus<br />
Budget in the middle of the year, many of the newspapers said [ I was]<br />
clearing the decks for an election that was May. This is October<br />
there still hasn't been an election, because I think the public do want<br />
value for from these Parliaments. That is, they don't want tricky<br />
Governments, trying to trick them at a poll, called at a time when they<br />
think the Government should be doing the nation's work. So, I know<br />
it would help your ratings if I announced the election on your<br />
program, and I would like to do you the favour, but I can't.<br />
RU: Nah, I don't need help in ratings, Paul.<br />
PM: How are you going you're going well? Well, good on you. That sort<br />
of right-wing adventure down the road your friend and mine, Mr<br />
Sattler I mean, all power to you.<br />
RU: Paul, we'll leave it there.<br />
ends. </p>
