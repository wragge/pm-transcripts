. JJAUSTRALIA&amp;. A AA<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA TUESDAY, 19 AUGUST 1980<br />
OFFICE OF NATIONAL ASSESSMENTS<br />
Mr Speaker In relation to allegations of security breaches<br />
in the Office of National Assessments, the Director-General of<br />
ONA, Mr Furlonger, asked the Director-General of Security,<br />
Mr Justice Woodward, to review security practices in ONA and<br />
report. Subsequently there were further allegations of deliberate<br />
security breaches and the Director-General of Security was asked<br />
to investigate these also.<br />
Mr Justice Woodward has now reported on these: matters and<br />
I have examined his findings.<br />
The report, as would be expected, deals with a number of<br />
matters of high security content and, in accordance with normal<br />
practice in the Parliament and elsewhere, I do not propose to<br />
make the report public. I shall make it available to the Leader<br />
of the Opposition if he so wishes. However, in view of the<br />
public and parliamentary interest the matter has attracted,<br />
I think I should indicate now in general terms what have been<br />
Mr Justice Woodward's findings.<br />
Mr Justice Woodward's report finds that there is no credible<br />
evidence of any ONA document having got into the wrong hands, nor<br />
of the improper use of classified information by any ONA officer, / 2 </p>
<p>2.<br />
nor of any serious breach* of security by any ONA officer.-, And*<br />
therefore no reason, arising from the ASIO inquiry, to conclude<br />
that ONA is not'a basically secure organisation.<br />
On the particular question, which attracted much public<br />
attention, of a missing security document, Mr Justice Woodward<br />
has reported that his investigation has established beyond<br />
reasonable doubt that the missing document was destroyed in ONA<br />
by an officer whose duty it was to dispose of unwanted papers<br />
and who in this instance had no reason to doubt that he was doing<br />
so lecqitimately. Before that happened, however, there was<br />
mishandling of the paper, about which the ASIO report is properly<br />
critical. The report nevertheless makes a number of recommendations.<br />
for improvements in security procedures in ONA, and confirms other<br />
security measures already taken by the Director-General ONA. It<br />
observes that its recommendations should not be regarded as<br />
implying any culpable weakness in ONA's former practices.<br />
As. I have said, Mr Justice Woodward's report is available<br />
to the Leader of the Opposition if he so wishes.<br />
The Director-General of ONA, Mr Furlonger, has reported to<br />
me that he has taken, and is taking, action to implement the<br />
recommendations made in the ASIO report. It is of course essential<br />
that this be done. The Government attaches the highest significance<br />
to the work of ONA, and obviously its security is an essential part<br />
of its continuing overall effectiveness in contributing to the bases<br />
on which Australia's external policies in the political, strategic<br />
and economic fields are formulated. </p>
<p>The ASIO report also provides the occasion to express arnd<br />
underline the Government's concern that there should be strict<br />
application of security procedures and practices in all<br />
Commonwealth organisations. Steps are being taken, as it is<br />
deemed appropriate, to improve such procedures and practices and<br />
to ensure that the requirements are strictly observed.<br />
More recently there have been assertions in the media that<br />
in some way the Director-General of Security was pressed to change<br />
some of the ASIO findings about ONA practices, and in some way to<br />
water down the strength of his conclusions.<br />
I am informed by Mr Justice Woodward, in respect of this<br />
report, that it is false in every specific point made and in its<br />
implications. Mr Justice Woodward has written to me stating that<br />
he took all the significant decisions about the two parts of the<br />
report himself; that at no time did he decide that any of the<br />
contents were too damning to be given to me, as alleged or even<br />
consider such a question. His only concern was that the report<br />
should be absolutely accurate and as fair as his judgement could<br />
make it. Mr Justice Woodward rejects utterly the implication<br />
that in some way his report was watered down deliberately to meet<br />
some accommodation of ONA.<br />
May I say I accept Mr Justice Woodward's assurance<br />
absolutely as I am sure the House does also.<br />
Mr Justice Woodward's letter to me on this issue also is<br />
available to the Leader of the opposition to peruse.<br />
C . i./ 4 </p>
<p>4.<br />
Mr. Speaker, not everything has been right in ONA's procedures.<br />
Actions of some officers gave ground for criticism. But<br />
things are being put right have largely been put rightand<br />
there is no ground for any public apprehension about<br />
-the basic security and continued value of ONA.<br />
Genuine debate and responsible and balanced criticism<br />
in respect of ONA or ASIO, or indeed any areas of Government<br />
administration, are to be expected and not shied away from.-<br />
The ciiticisms of ONA and ASIO have tended to have the effect<br />
of undermining public faith in these two organisations.. The<br />
Government for its part will continue to support and encourage<br />
ONA and ASIO in the proper discharge of their importantresponsibilities.<br />
I urge others to do likewise. 000---</p>
