PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF NEW CONFrENOL, AUSTRALIAN SUBMARINg<br />
CORPORATION, ADELAIDE, 16 NOVEIBER 1989<br />
9 &amp; 0EH-PROOF ONLY<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister what would you rate the chances<br />
of going ahead with the other two suibmarines?<br />
PM: I can' t ake a statement on that now. I need to get<br />
briefing from Kim Beazley and the Departments. I hope of<br />
course, looking to the future that the excellence of the<br />
product that has a ome out of here will enable us to be<br />
attractive to a number of other countries.<br />
JOURNALIST: On national issues Prime Minister, what in the<br />
purpose of the special Cabinet meeting?<br />
PM: The speaial Cabinet meeting?<br />
JOURNALIST: The special Cabinet meeting that's been called<br />
for-<br />
PM: I notice reading the paper today there'. some story<br />
that there's some special Cabinet inee ting. Essentially what<br />
is happening is that I am going to be repeating what I often<br />
do and particularly as you come up towards, you know. soae<br />
election period, you know not too far' out. But we always<br />
have a political discussion about Just how things are going<br />
and the general considerations that need to be taken into<br />
account and that'sa what's going to be done. There ' s nothing<br />
JOURNALIST: You don't think it'll be setting the agenda<br />
for next year?<br />
PM: No. We don't suddenly set agendas like that. The agenda<br />
for 1990 will be a continuation of seeking the goals that<br />
we have been for many years. that is a stronger economy.<br />
a fairer society, a country which is enmeshed with this region<br />
and a nation which in a proud meber of the international<br />
counity. Those are our basic goals. basic agenda and Youa<br />
don't change those basic objective. just by s ome whim of<br />
an election. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Sir Ran Brierley's saying that big business<br />
is concerned that the Labor Government might be in disarray,<br />
there's no firm economic leadership.<br />
PM: I would suggest that Sir Ron, for whom I have<br />
considerable respect and particularly I admire his love of<br />
Cricket I might say, but you know he should concentrate on<br />
the affairs that he's involved in. I would simply suggest<br />
that the economic leadership that we have provided has done<br />
these things out of which the business cmunity has been<br />
the beneficiary. Just remember them. When we came to office<br />
the profit share at it. historically lowest debt point, some<br />
1 1%.<br />
JOURNALIST: inaudible<br />
PHM: Weit a minute. Lot me finish please.<br />
JOURNALIST: You just paused, that's all.<br />
PM: Well yos, everyone's entitled to a pause.<br />
S JOURNALIST: We're Just anxious, that's all.<br />
PM: The profit share has under this Government gone from<br />
that low point now to over 16%. It's gone that way with<br />
the co-operation of the trade union movement. As a result<br />
of that you've had a move to profit, a move to investmnt<br />
with invesment being at it. highest level since statistics<br />
have beon recorded and with employment creation at its highest<br />
rate. Now those are the things which have benefitted business<br />
and the economy-and the couizmity generally. If you want<br />
to compare that with the mesa we inherited and the mess that'.<br />
necessarily involved in the alternative., well and good.<br />
JOURNALIST: Has Mr Bannon spoken to you personally about<br />
high interest rates?<br />
PM: Mr Bannon has spoken to me on a number of occasions<br />
over the years about the economy general ly and what' s<br />
happening In South Australia. We have quite regular<br />
conversations. We've been having them for years. nothing<br />
special now.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, during this election campaign<br />
the Premier, Mr Bannon, has offered great incentives for<br />
mortgage relief. Are you going to take that on board<br />
yourself? PM: Now wehat we'vye had to say at the Federal level about<br />
this now a State Premier is able to look at these issues<br />
in term of his own affairs and what we have in South<br />
Australia is a State economy which has boon very, very well<br />
managed, you have the lowest level of debt of any State and<br />
within that framework Mr Bannon feel. that he would be able<br />
to make these decisions to direct assistance to those most<br />
in need. That's appropriate for him to do that if he wishes. </p>
<p>"" I" hL. TST: A lot of people in Australia are saying that<br />
there is a lot more than those ink South Australia. would<br />
You see then that there are more people in this country that<br />
would need more mortgage relief?<br />
PM: I've made my comments and the Governmaent's made its<br />
decision in this area.<br />
JOURNALIST: High interest rates has become an election issue<br />
in South Austral ia. Are you concerned that that haG became<br />
an election issue?<br />
PM: Well you're simply asserting that. I'm saying that<br />
as far as the State election is concerned this is an election<br />
about* State issues and a decision as to whether they are<br />
going to have John Bannon as Premier or Mr Olsen, that's<br />
the essential issue and we'll be having a Federal election<br />
next year and it's at that election that people will be able<br />
to make their Judgements as between the two groups that can<br />
do anything or offer policies about the Australian situation.<br />
That in the Australian Labor Party federally and the mismatch<br />
you can hardly call it a marriage but this alliance of<br />
the Liberals and the National Party in Canberra, that's where<br />
those issues will be decided at that federal election some<br />
time next year. Here the simple issue is South Australians<br />
need to make up their minds whether they want John Bannon<br />
and the good government he's provided or Olsen and that's<br />
as simple as it is.<br />
JOURNALIST: It is unusual for you to be in South Australia<br />
for only three and a half hours during a State election.<br />
PM: No, not at all<br />
JOURNALIST: Are you coming back? </p>
<p>4.<br />
PM: I wonder if I've got the opportunity of having a<br />
question, of even starting to answer it could I do that<br />
please? Thanks. Since I've been Prime Minister live made<br />
it clear that the involvement that I will have in State<br />
elections is a matter which should be judged by the States<br />
in term of how they see the issues and positions, and I<br />
have done that here. I've happily agreed to be over here at<br />
this time its had to be a rushed trip. I've got<br />
comitments in Melbourne tonight, I had commitment. in<br />
Canberra yesterday and last night, but I warn happy to come<br />
over here and to be associated with my friend and colleague,<br />
John Bannon, and that'. it.<br />
JOURNALIST: Will you be coming back before the election?<br />
PH: I wouldn't think sa, Parliament's sitting next week.<br />
JOURNALIST: Just one more. Mr Olsen has talked about<br />
having a bill of ethics, or a code of ethics what do you<br />
think about that? He's talking about no infidelity, no<br />
messing around outside of marriages?<br />
PM: It's interesting isn't it? Two things are interesting<br />
about that. Piratly, if you haven't got much sensible to<br />
may about real issues of how you'd run an economy and things<br />
like that, you'll always try and get a diversion. I mean,<br />
the classic example of that at the moment in Australian<br />
politics is up in the State of Queensland* The most<br />
corrupt administration that we've had in the history of<br />
Australian politics. So what are they doing, they're<br />
talking about moral matters the great diversions. And the<br />
second thing that'. interesting,, if you look at politics in<br />
this country and over. a., I give you a'warning -where you<br />
have people getting up on the moral bandwagqon, just start<br />
sniffing around a bit because its very remarkable how often<br />
you find the great hypocrisy amongst the moralists. Those<br />
who preach it, the sort of people they're with, they don't<br />
have the greatest record<br />
JOURNALIST: Can you tell me about John Olsen. record?<br />
PH: I'm not saying anything about him personally, I don't<br />
mean that. I mean it. the people that I don't make a<br />
practice of getting into my opponents, political opponents,<br />
on personal terms. That'. what they do. I don't do it.<br />
sizply maying that people who take up those arta of<br />
issues when its made an issue you find groups who are<br />
associated with that are the ones that often have a lot to<br />
answer for. The most important thing to understand is that<br />
as far as this election campaign is concerned and what the </p>
<p>election is about in the end, is about do you want John<br />
Bannon and a proven team and a proven Government running the<br />
State or do they want to put John Olson in, who wants to<br />
talk about these moral issues. I'm not going to get into<br />
those questions of people's personal habits, because I don't<br />
believe its relevant. I've never got into that sort of<br />
caper of trying to attack my opponents on the basis of their<br />
behaviour because I believe that its improper to do so, and<br />
in the end, may Z say, I think its also counter-productive.<br />
I don't think the people of South Australia vill buy that<br />
crap.<br />
JOURNALIST: Do you agree with Brian Loton that we need an<br />
economic crisis to shake Australia out of its complacency?<br />
Pli I've got nothing to say about what Mr Loton had to may.<br />
JOURNALIST: Are you aware of a decision that was made by<br />
the Defence Force Development Committee last Wednesday on<br />
whether it thouqht we needed the extra two submarines?<br />
PM: I'm not aware of it. Mr Beazley will be talking to me<br />
about these things at the appropriate time.<br />
