A national memorial service will be held at 10.00 am on Thursday, 24 October 2002 in the Great Hall, Parliament House, Canberra.<br />
The service will commemorate those Australians and others who have died or are still missing as a result of the horrific terrorist attack in Bali.  It will also be an opportunity to pray for those who were injured and those who support affected family and friends, and to give thanks for those who have rendered such magnificent service in a time of need.<br />
The Governor-General, State Governors, Premiers and Chief Ministers, the Leader of the Opposition and other parliamentarians have been invited along with representatives from the Diplomatic Corps, including those countries with citizens affected by the terrorist attack.<br />
I hope the service will provide a focus for the general public to show their support for their fellow Australians and for us all to seek to strengthen our resolve as a nation to overcome the challenges to our freedom, our openness and our way of life.<br />
I would particularly welcome families and friends of those who have been affected by the Bali tragedy although I understand that the circumstances may make it difficult for some to attend.  The Government will endeavour to facilitate travel for up to two members of the immediate families of those who have died or who are still missing.  I hope that the service will support all those grieving and waiting for news at this trying time.<br />
Further details can be obtained from (02) 6271 5166.  Notices have been lodged for publication in Saturday';s major newspapers. </p>
