AUSTRALIAN~ INSTITUTE OF POLITICAL SCIENCE<br />
SUITER SCHOOL CAN~ BERRA<br />
27 January 1973<br />
Opening Address by the Prime Minister, the Hon. E. G. Whitlam,<br />
M. P.<br />
It is a happy coincidence that this Summer School on Australia's<br />
international relations should open on such a momentous day in the<br />
history of our region and of the world the day tof the ceasefire in<br />
Vie t-Nam. A generation of war and havoc and suffering lies behind us.<br />
The problems ahead, in Viet-Nam, in Indo-China and in the region are<br />
immense. They will tax statemanship to the limit, yet it is impossible<br />
at such a time, on such a day, not to feel a sense of profound relief<br />
and profound hope and a sense of excitement at the new opportunity which<br />
this week's historic events have opened up for us all. It is in the<br />
context of change, of hope, of new opportunities that I put my remarks<br />
in opening the Summer School.<br />
On 2 December the nation changed its government, but did not<br />
and could not by that act change the essential foundations of its foreign<br />
/ 2 </p>
<p>-2-<br />
policy. Australia's national interests did not change. Australia's<br />
international obligations did not change. Australia's alliances and<br />
friendships did not change. Nonetheless, the change is real and deep<br />
because what has altered is the perception and interpretation of thosa<br />
interests, obligations and friendships by the elected government. The<br />
essential change is that the views and policies of the Australian<br />
Government working within the same framework of facts as its<br />
predecessors are now those of the Australian Labor Party. The<br />
Australian Government acts on a mandate given to it by the Australian<br />
people. On 2 December that mandate was given clearly to the Australian<br />
Labor Party. I make these remnarks at the outset not to strike a partisan<br />
note, but to place on record a simple, obvious but powerful fact which<br />
should never be forgotten at home or abroad, neither by our opponents<br />
here nor our friends abroad.<br />
The mandate of the Labor Government was abundantly clear on<br />
specific matters of our foreign relations. In the Policy Speech we did<br />
not for instance say just in general terms that we would work for<br />
normalisation of relations with the People's Republic of China. We said<br />
specifically " The Labor Government will transfer Australia's China Embassy<br />
from Taipei to Peking." We have done so. We did not just say that we<br />
would deplore resumption of French nuclear tests in the Pacific. We said<br />
" We will take the question of French nuclear tests to the International<br />
Court of Justice." We preparing to do so. We did not just say that we<br />
deplored racial-selection of sporting teams. We said " We will give no<br />
visas to or through Australia to racially selected sporting teams."<br />
We shall not. </p>
<p>Beyond, however, these and other quite specific pledges, there<br />
were other great matters which were stated more generally and yet which<br />
must be given commanding force and weight if we are to take our mandate<br />
seriously. For example, the reference in my Policy Speech to Viet-N~ tm<br />
was relatively brief and general. This was not just because in November<br />
the ceasefire then seemed much closer than it turned out. It was<br />
because there was not a matter in the whole range of policy domestic<br />
or foreign on which the intentions and determination of the Australian<br />
Labor Party and an Australian labor Government ran so deep, clear and<br />
straight. But on three great matters the three relevant matters for an<br />
Australian political party or an Australian government there had never<br />
been any doubt about the attitude of my Party. Those principles were:<br />
opposition to Australia's military involvement; opposition to the<br />
bombing of North Viet-Nam; and, thirdly, a determination to use<br />
Australia's influence to end the war.<br />
From 28 April 1965 the day Sir Robert Menzies announced the<br />
sending of the first battalion these three attitudes had never been in<br />
doubt nor in question at any level of the Australian Labor Party. Nobody<br />
could be under any illusion that once we had formed a government we would<br />
delay for a day or an hour in acting upon these policies and these<br />
principles upon this mandate.<br />
Yet our mandate and duty to maintain the American alliance was<br />
equally clear. This we will do. The ending of American intervention in<br />
Indo-China will remove the really serious difference between the two<br />
administrations. There will be another result of profound importance.<br />
The end of intervention with all the bitterness and dissension it<br />
brought will free the spirit and energies of the American people and<br />
help mightily to restore the United States to her proper and constructive </p>
<p>-4-<br />
role as the world's most generous and idealistic nation. But let me also<br />
say this:-At no time in the eighteen years since the United States began<br />
her military commitment in Indo-China, or in the ten years since Australia<br />
first sent advisers there, or in the eight years since Australia<br />
committed troops on the ground in strength, or in the seven years since<br />
the bombing of North Viet-Nam began, has it ever been suggested by any<br />
President, by any Prime Minister, by any responsible Congressman that<br />
Australia's attitude to the war in Viet-Nam or any phase in the war in<br />
Viet-Namn was a condition of the continuation of ANZUS. There is no<br />
such suggestion now. ANZUS is a legal embodiment of the common interests<br />
of the people of Australia, New Zealand and the United States. Those<br />
interests remain constant beyond changes of administration in Washington,<br />
Wellington or Canberra.<br />
It is true that the changed Australian attitude to Viet-Namn<br />
did lead to an alteration in the degree of consultation on American policy<br />
in Viet-Nam between Washington and Canberra. That alteration had nothing<br />
to do with the change of government. It occurred under the previous<br />
government as the Australian commitment waE. wound down. As the<br />
significance of the Australian commitment lessened, the less Australia<br />
was told and the previous government did not and could not complain.<br />
But this was an alt,-, ration related solely to Viet-Nam. It had nothing<br />
to do with ANZUS.<br />
However, for all its enduring importance, adherence to ANZUS<br />
does not in itself constitute a foreign policy. It is a treaty at the<br />
centre of our relations with only two nations, albeit one our closest<br />
partner and the other the world's greatest power. Yet insofar as<br />
ANZUS represents a security guarantee in the ultimate peril, reliance<br />
upon it as the sole objective of our foreign policy would in fact place<br />
our foreign policy in suspension until the peril emerged. </p>
<p>The real test of a successful foreign policy is the extent to<br />
which a balance is struck and kept between a naition's commitment and a<br />
nation's power. The United States herself now accepts that its cold<br />
war commitment to global containment of Communism represented a gross<br />
over-extension of her real power. This was one of the inexorable lessons<br />
of Viet-Nam. To see the change which has occurred because of Viet-Nam<br />
it is enough to compare the circumspection of President Nixon's second<br />
Inaugural with the sweeping rhetoric of John Kennedyts Inaugural with<br />
its vision of an unlimited universal acceptance of burdens by the<br />
United States. In my Policy Speech I said:<br />
" A nation's foreign policy depends on striking a wise, proper<br />
and prudent balance between commitment and power. Labor will have four<br />
commitments commensurate to our power and resources;<br />
" First our own national security;<br />
" Secondly a secure, united and friendly<br />
Papua New Guinea;<br />
" Thirdly achieve closer relations with our<br />
nearest and largest neighbour,<br />
Indonesia;<br />
" Fourthly promote the peace and prosperity<br />
of our neighbourhood."<br />
The fourth of those is, of course, an extremely general<br />
proposition. Yet Australia's actual situation in our region makes it a<br />
meaningful objective for an Australian Foreign Policy. It is a<br />
commitment realistically commensurate with our power, our resources and<br />
our interests. </p>
<p>-6-<br />
Australia's actual situation is this: We are far and away the<br />
richest nation in the neighbourhood. We have a gross national product<br />
equal to that of all the countries between the Bay of Bengal and the South<br />
China Sea. Those countries have twenty times our population. We ar3 an<br />
island continent with one of the most formidable natural defences in the<br />
world. We have no serious conflict of interests with any of our<br />
neighbours and there are no foreseeable conflicts likely to arise well<br />
beyond this decade.<br />
We have an assured economic partnership a relationship of<br />
interdependence, not dependence with Japan, the strongest power in the<br />
wider region. Both Australia and Japan are moving swiftly into an<br />
area of better understanding with the largest power, China.<br />
If I appear to be placing such great emphasis on the rosier<br />
aspects of our present situation, it is because I wish to contrast the<br />
new realities with the old fears, shibboleths and suspicions. One<br />
might say, with Canning, in a very different context ana very different<br />
sense, " I call the new world into existence in order to redress the<br />
balance of the old." I hasten to say that absolutely no significance<br />
whatever is to be attached to my preferring Canning above Metternich.<br />
Tc give an independent view from the other side of the world<br />
I quote from the " Guardian" of 15 January:-<br />
" Australia is the richest most powerful and most advanced<br />
country in a part of the world that is otherwise empty of influential<br />
states. It is proper and healthy that Australian policy should reflect<br />
this political and economic fact.<br />
" But until the new government came along a succession of<br />
governments in Canberra had tended to accept for Australia a more<br />
dependent status than the country actually enjoys. Since the Second<br />
World War Australians and Americans have understood each other and have </p>
<p>-7-<br />
depended upon each other to a degree that was unknown before Pearl Harbour.<br />
But friendship between Australia and America does not require Australia<br />
to be subservient." I am determined that under this Government the Australian. people<br />
will be encouraged to shed the old stultifying fears and animosities which<br />
have encumbered the national spirit for generations and dominated, often<br />
for domestic partisan purposes, the foreign policy of this nation.<br />
The other great theme our Government will wish to stress both<br />
with the great powers and our neighbours is that with the end of foreign<br />
intervention in Viet-Nam the region has a second chance. The West threw<br />
away an opportunity for a settlement in 1954 after Korea, after Geneva.<br />
I believe the United States, the Soviet Union, Japan and China are<br />
determined not to let the second opportunity slip because assuredly it<br />
will not be offered a third time. In particular the Australian<br />
Government will discourage at all levels the kind of thinking which<br />
would place North Viet-Nam in the role of the new antagonist as a<br />
replacement for China and which wiould place Thailand in the role assigned<br />
to South Viet-Namn in the early ' 60' s. Accordingly, we shall support<br />
the ASEAN proposal for a zone of peace and neutrality in South East<br />
Asia and encourage the other countries involved in the region to endorse<br />
the proposition. I have spoken on several occasions in recent months of the<br />
great importance wie attach to the development of our relations with<br />
Indonesia and stressed it in the Policy Speech. The importance of<br />
Indonesia to Australia is indisputable. We need, however, to see the<br />
development of ) ur relations with Indonesia within the wider South<br />
Ehst Asian regional context. I do not want to give the impression that<br />
by giving priority to our relations with Indonesia we would do so at<br />
-/ 8 </p>
<p>the expense of our relations with other ASEAN countries. Indonesia is,<br />
of course, closer geographically and much larger than the other members.<br />
But our standing in other regional countries is not irrelevant to the<br />
importance which Indonesia will attach to Australia. In the same way<br />
as our destiny is inseparable from Indonesia, so Indonesia cannot<br />
separate her own destiny from those of her immediate neighbours to<br />
the north in ASEAN. So the continued development of our relations with<br />
Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand and the Philippines is important not only<br />
in the wider regional context, but in the context of our own relations<br />
with Indonesia. We see our relations with Indonesia as complementary<br />
to and not in any way competitive with her or our relationships with<br />
other ASEAN countries. This is what I mean in saying that in giving<br />
priority to the development of our relations with Indonesia we are<br />
not doing this at the expense of our relations with the other ASEAN<br />
countries. I might sum up our general approach to the affairs of our<br />
region by stating the situation I expect to exist by 1975. With New<br />
Zealand, relations wrill have grown even closer through a series of<br />
co-operative endeavours to promote the welfare and harmony of the<br />
South Pacific. We shall have as our close neighbour an independent Papua<br />
New Guinea which will have for the rest of this century the first call<br />
on our substantially increased foreign aid programme. We shall be<br />
working closely in co-operation with the Government of Papu~ a New Guinea<br />
through a specific and guaranteed economic programme.<br />
We do not see any immediate threat of external aggression<br />
to the countries of South East Asia. We do not want to look on South<br />
East Asia as a front line in terms of the old cliche of forward defence. </p>
<p>-9-<br />
We do not see South East Asia as a frontier where we might fight nameless<br />
Asian enemies as far to the north of' our owm shores as possible in<br />
other people's backyards.<br />
To meet the new realities and our perception of them we shall<br />
be seeking new forms of regional co-operation. In its present form,<br />
ASPAC no longer reflects those realities. In particular, the continued<br />
presence of Taiwan makes ASPAC anacronistic. Three of ASPAC's members<br />
Australia, New Zealand and Japan recognise Peking as the sole legal<br />
government of China. We will not be withdrawing immediately from ASPAC<br />
although we consider that unless there is a change in its present<br />
membership, it cannot function effectively or continue for very long.<br />
In Wellington the New Zealand Prime Minister and I expressed<br />
our intention to work with our Asian and Pacific neighbours in making<br />
adjustments to existing arrangements and seeking new forms of co-operation.<br />
We shall be consulting with our neighbours including Indonesia, Japan<br />
and others before any final decisions are reached on how we should<br />
proceed. There is no question of seeking to change or enlarge ASEAN.<br />
We should like to see all our ASEAN neighbours in a larger regional<br />
association for Asia and the Pacific, but ASEAN itself is a sub-regional<br />
grouping which is doing valuable work and any enlargement of the<br />
organisation is a matter for its members.<br />
Regional co-operation will be one of the keystones of<br />
Australia's foreign policy for the 701s. We shall be charting a new<br />
course with less emphasis on military pacts. It will be based on an<br />
independent outlook in foreign affairs and will be directed towards a<br />
new regional community geared to the realities of the<br />
The guidelines of the regional community that I foresee will<br />
be an organisation genuinely representative of the region, without / io </p>
<p>ideological overtones, conceived as an initiative to help free the region<br />
of great power rivalries that have bedevilled its progress for decades<br />
and designed to insulate the region against ideological interference<br />
from the great powers.<br />
I do not intend that Australia should try to impose a detailed<br />
formulation for setting up such a community and we shall not seek to<br />
intrude beyond our realistic capacity to participate and assist in the<br />
realisation of this concept. We shall be patient and punctilious in our<br />
consultation and prepared at every turn to take account of and participate<br />
in the genuine aspirations of the region. But we shall be active in<br />
seeking this end. I have already initiated efforts in the relevant<br />
Departments of my Government and I shall continue to advance this concept<br />
as an earnest of Australia's genuine interest in the developmnent of a truly<br />
representative regional community.<br />
I conclude by expressing our profound satisfaction that this<br />
auspicious day should mark a new beginning or at the very least a chance<br />
for a new beginning in our region. I take it as a happy omen indeed that<br />
this should have occurred so early in the life of the new Australian<br />
Government. Events of this week add a new importance and a new dimension<br />
to this Summer School. Australians like yourselves who wish to help us<br />
frame new policies and take the debate on foreign affairs to a new level<br />
can now do so free of the overwhelming preoccupation of Viet-Nam.<br />
I have long stressed that a Labor Government would seek and welcome<br />
the help of Australians in framing our policies at all levels. Your views<br />
and ideas are doubly welcome at this time. </p>
