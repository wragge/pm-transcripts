    <content><![CDATA[<p>On behalf of the Government and people of Australia, I express my deep sorrow and sympathy on the passing of the Head of State of Samoa, His Highness Malietoa Tanumafili II. </p>
<p>  As Chairman of the committee which prepared Samoa for independence, His Highness was rightly regarded as one of the fathers of both Samoa and American Samoa.  Upon independence in 1962, His Highness became joint head of state with Tupua Tamasese Mea'ole, and then sole head of state from 1963. </p>
<p>Australia has warm relations with Samoa, underpinned by regional cooperation, bilateral aid and defence cooperation programmes and strong people-to-people links through the significant Samoan community residing in Australia.<br />
On behalf of the Australian Government and people, I extend my sincere condolences to His Highness' family and to the government and people of Samoa. </p>
<p>Australia will be represented at His Highness' State funeral on Friday 18 May 2007 by the Governor-General, His Excellency Major-General Michael   Jeffery AC CVO MC (Retd).  </p>
