    <content><![CDATA[<p>I am pleased to announce that the President of Hungary, His Excellency</p>
<p> Arpad Goncz, will visit Australia from 15 February to 21 February.</p>
<p> The President will travel to Sydney, Canberra and Melbourne.</p>
<p>This is the first visit to Australia by a Hungarian head of state</p>
<p> and the visit provides an excellent opportunity to expand the relationship</p>
<p> between our two countries.</p>
<p>Hungary was a significant source of post-war migration to Australia</p>
<p> and today our Hungarian community numbers around 70,000 people. In</p>
<p> addition to drawing attention to the Hungarian contribution to Australia,</p>
<p> this visit will give a timely boost to our commercial links.</p>
<p>As a country with a growing economy and prospects for membership of</p>
<p> the European Union, Hungary is a valuable partner for Australia in</p>
<p> eastern Europe. Similarly Australia's place in the Asia-Pacific</p>
<p> region offers opportunities to Hungary.</p>
<p>I look forward to welcoming the President to Australia.</p>
