FOR MEDIA 26 April 1990<br />
STATEMENT BY THE ACTING PRIME MINISTER<br />
THE HON PAUL KEATING MP<br />
The Government has finalised the terms of reference for the<br />
Resource Assessment Commission's inquiry into the use of the<br />
resources of the Kakadu Conservation Zone. The Prime<br />
Minister has written to the Hon Justice D G Stewart,<br />
Chairman of the Resource Assessment Commission, formally<br />
asking him to commence the inquiry. A copy of his notice to<br />
the Commission setting out the terms of reference for the<br />
inquiry is attached.<br />
This follows consultation with State and Territory<br />
Governments and a range of other inmdustry, conservation and<br />
Aboriginal organisations on the terms of reference for the<br />
inquiry. The terms of reference now finialised will enable<br />
the Commission to undertake a proper examination of all<br />
major issues relevant to the Conservation Zone.<br />
The Resource Assessment Commission was established by the<br />
Commonwealth Government last year to conduct independent<br />
inquiries into major complex resource issues. The issue of<br />
the future use of the resources of the Kakadu Conservation<br />
Zone involves conisideration of a range of particularly<br />
complex and contentious resource, environmental and<br />
Aboriginal. issues. The reference will form the Commission's<br />
second inquiry following the referral of the issue of forest<br />
resources to it late last year.<br />
The Governor-General has appointed Professor Roger Kitching<br />
and Dr Gregory McColl as special Commissioners to the<br />
Resource Assessment Commission for the purpose of this<br />
inquiry. Both are well qualified to assist Justice Stewart<br />
with the inquiry.<br />
Professor Kitching is Professor of Ecosystem Management at<br />
the University of New England and has an extensive<br />
background in scientific research and analysing<br />
environmental issues.<br />
Dr McColl is a consulting economist with considerable<br />
analytical experience in economic and resouirce matters.<br />
The Prime Minister has asked for the report to be completed<br />
by 26 April 1991. 61987 </p>
