    <content><![CDATA[<p>Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for attending this game in such numbers and with such enthusiasm.</p>
<p>Of course, it’s so typically Australian, isn’t it, to want to lull England into a false sense of security! So far, it’s all going to plan!</p>
<p>But, I have to say that the bigger the challenge, the greater the achievement, and it was nice to be spoken to by Chris Rogers earlier this evening and let’s hope he’s just as inspirational to the team downstairs, because they will certainly need plenty of inspiration and encouragement!</p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen, it’s fitting that the man who started this tradition here at Manuka Oval was none other than Sir Robert Menzies.</p>
<p>Like other Australian Prime Ministers, myself included, he was a rather ordinary cricketer, but he did love the sport and he did understand the value of tradition.</p>
<p>I was recently reading the transcript of his final press conference back in 1966 reflecting on his innings of 18 years as Prime Minister. He was asked this important question: he was asked was Canberra a blunder? And of course, Menzies had transformed this capital from what had been unkindly described as a ‘sheep station with lights’ to a city.</p>
<p>Under his guidance, six suburbs in search of a city actually became a city. Menzies championed the construction of Lake Burley Griffin, the Parliamentary Triangle and the Australian National University. He set Canberra up to be the sparkling city that it is today. And so he answered at that press conference the question with these words: he said, “Canberra is my pride and joy”. So, I can think of no better way to celebrate Sir Robert's legacy than joining two of the things he loved most: Canberra and cricket.</p>
<p>This Prime Minister's game has had its ups, it’s had its downs. It’s been the breaking of some old legends such as Bradman and Fingleton, whose returns to the pitch in this fixture could be described as ordinary at best, but it has also been the making of some future legends; people like Richie Benaud, David Boon and, of course, last year's captain, Brett Lee, and I suppose today we should remember another selection for the Prime Minister's XI back in 2009 – Phillip Hughes. Phillip Hughes will always remain a shining light in cricket's firmament.</p>
<p>So, as Ian has observed, I am the seventh prime minister to choose a Prime Minister's XI.</p>
<p>Menzies inaugurated this tradition and Bob Hawke revived it back in 1984. That’s the same year that Hawkie took to the field in a game against the Press Gallery and had his glasses smashed down the road at Kingston Oval. It was a feat at the crease almost the equal of John Howard's bowling in Pakistan and you can understand with those predecessors I do not propose to take the field myself! And unless anyone claimed that I am sledging my predecessors, I should point out that at age 13 I was briefly put in the nets at school to bat and to bowl and was promptly told to report to the rowing sheds.</p>
<p>I do rely on others to advise me on cricket and I want to thank my unofficial adviser on all things cricket, Group Captain Cate McGregor, who again this year helped to select a stellar team.</p>
<p>I want to thank Chris Rogers for stepping into Mike Hussey's shoes as Captain. I can think of no better man to lead a run chase and I want to thank the selectors for their inspired choice.</p>
<p>Cricket, perhaps more than any other sport, evokes an extraordinary sense of tradition.</p>
<p>Cricket is a shared language for all those nations who play it, with a code of behaviour and conduct; a code of decency, no less, to which all cricketers aspire.</p>
<p>It’s fitting, therefore, that Australia and New Zealand have the privilege of hosting the 2015 Cricket World Cup, given that this is the centenary year of the Gallipoli campaign.</p>
<p>It’s also fitting that today's charity partner is Stand Tall for Post-Traumatic Stress, and I want to thank Tony Dell for everything he has done to raise awareness of this important condition. We all want to do the right thing by those who have done the right thing by our country and no-one has done the right thing by our country more than our military personnel, particularly those on the frontline. We all know how many of them carry the unseen scars of war and they deserve the best possible support.</p>
<p>All team sport is about having a go and joining the team. That’s why we think that sport builds character. So, in the spirit of sportsmanship, I want to wish both sides all the best for the second half of this game.</p>
<p>I particularly thank Cricket Australia for its support of the Prime Minister's XI this year and Cricket ACT for supporting the game again. I pay tribute to Mark Vergano who has been a splendid CEO of Cricket ACT for 13 years. I want to acknowledge Cricket Australia Chairman, Wally Edwards, who is handing over the reins to David Peever later this year. Wally, you have been a great steward and a great guardian of the best traditions of this great game. You have also been a great supporter of this fixture under various prime ministers. I have enjoyed your company, I have enjoyed your counsel and, well, I think you will find I am taking some of your counsel in the next day or so and I am sure it was your counsel that caused Prime Minister Gillard to put the lights up here – a very sensible decision from the former government!</p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen, may it be a great game and may cricket and all of us be the winner.</p>
