PRESS OFFICE TRANSCRIPT 23 MARCH 1979<br />
ETHNIC MEDIA CONFERENCE, SYDNEY.<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
matters that are current and of interest to you. But quite<br />
apart from your own particular concerns, I would be very happy<br />
to try and answer questions on any general matters that you<br />
want to put to me. I think one of the things that has been of<br />
concern to my Government over the last three years is the<br />
adequacy of communication and consultation with different groups<br />
and people within Australia and that obviously includes the<br />
ethnic communities. I think that that consultation is very<br />
important for a Government to have an adequate understanding<br />
and awareness of the concerns, of the interests, of the problems<br />
of people in different parts of Australia and coming from<br />
different groups within Australia. One of the things that we<br />
have sought to do in recent times as you know, is to provide<br />
much improved services, post-arrival services, for people<br />
who have come to Australia. We commissioned the Galbally<br />
Inquiry and after very extensive consultation with community<br />
groups right around the Commonwealth they made their report<br />
and the Commonwealth has adopted that report in total.<br />
The general implementation of the report's recommendations<br />
I think is proceeding in a satisfactory way and we will be<br />
continuing to press on with that. We have established a particular<br />
machinery within the Commonwealth itself to make sure that<br />
the programmes are implemented as quickly, expeditiously, as<br />
we would want. In some areas the process of consultation<br />
that we believe to be necessary has to an extent delayed<br />
implementation of one or two elements of the programme. But by<br />
and large, I think that it is going very well indeed. For example,<br />
over the nex * t few months,, as a result of the report, there will<br />
be two multi-cultural resource centres established; one in<br />
Liverpool and one in Wollongong. They ought to improve the<br />
services to these areas and I would hope stimulate further efforts<br />
to self-help within those particular communities. We envisage<br />
that the centres will enable community involvement and also<br />
immediate coverage of their purpose and of their establishment<br />
will encourage people from those communities to make use of<br />
those resource centres. I don't think at the outset I would<br />
like to say any more. I imagine we will cover a wide range of<br />
topics as a result of whatever questions you might put to me.<br />
I do believe, as I am sure you do, that you have a very particular<br />
responsibility to the communities that you seek to serve and<br />
the responsibility to represent the interests of your readers,<br />
I hope also, as you would believe, to help your own readers to<br />
understand the decisions of Government especially where they<br />
are related such matters as the Galbally Report and its<br />
recommendations which is meant to advance the interests of<br />
many people within ethnic communities. 2 </p>
<p>-2<br />
Question: As Secretary for the last 25 years of the Association of<br />
Foreign Language newspapers I would like to start the ball rolling<br />
and to thank you for the fact that at long last, after about<br />
five, six years of you could say frustration, we have the<br />
opportunity to personally speak with you as the Head of the<br />
present Government. For the last four or five years there has<br />
been little or no contact between the foreign language press<br />
and the Government. The previous Federal ( inaudible) by the<br />
Coalition Government had established, first under the late<br />
Sir Richard Boyer, an immigration publicity council which<br />
contained nominated members of the various ethnic medias<br />
and Australianmedia of all media which met four times<br />
a year with the Minister for Immigration, the Head of the<br />
Department of Immigration and some of his responsible officers.<br />
When the Labor Government came in this was abolished and has<br />
never been re-established since. That has created a complete<br />
lack of communication between the foreign language press and<br />
the Government. During the last five-six years the Association<br />
has written numerous letters to the Minister for Immigration,<br />
the Minister for Post -and Telecommunications and as you may<br />
recollect, in despair at the end, to you personally trying<br />
to get a personal talk about our problems. Now, at long last, we<br />
are in a position, thanks to you, to have an open-hearted talk<br />
about it; because during the last five-six years the foreign<br />
language press, which has started the communication between<br />
the Australian Government and the ethnic communities, has been<br />
treated, I wouldn't say ( inaudible) but certainly as the<br />
black sheep of the family, of the unwanted child. I have here,<br />
you can have a look at this whenever it suits you, photocopies<br />
of all the correspondence during the last five years between the<br />
Association and the Minister for Immigration, there is also one<br />
lette ' r addressed to you and you replied to it, and nothing has<br />
come of that. The Minister for Immigration never had time to<br />
see us, even though we put some very great pressure to bear<br />
upon him at the end of last year when there was a special<br />
meeting, not only of members of the Association, but of all<br />
foreign language newspaper editors here and a special petition,<br />
a special resolution was sent to him stressing again the great<br />
problems and what we may expect from the Federal Government so<br />
that we can continue the work we are doing. The main points in<br />
it were I will give you the file so you can have a look at<br />
the correspondence the main items were: ( inaudible)<br />
re-establishment of regular contact between the Government and<br />
the ethnic press; also support in the way of sufficient<br />
Government advertising which has been promised, unofficially,<br />
and which has come in a haphazard way now and then. For the<br />
last 25 years we have tried to get the special concession rate<br />
postage for the foreign language press as another way of<br />
indirect assistance and that has always been rebuffed with the<br />
idea the post office loses all that, so much, on publications<br />
registered publications. Let that be. If there can be millions<br />
put into ethnic radio and ethnic television, would it be such<br />
a sacrifice to buy a special concession rate, considering<br />
the educative purpose and task of the foreign language press,<br />
to lose $ 20,000-$ 30,000 extra on that? The other point, of course,<br />
was what we stressed, that if money is made available for the<br />
foreign language press in the way of advertising, it is used in<br />
3 </p>
<p>-3<br />
Question: ( continued)<br />
an indiscriminate way. Lots of that money is frittered away<br />
onto small ( inaudible) magazines little society magazines<br />
and all that kind of thing. We have insisted in previous<br />
letters to the Minister for Immigration, which you will find<br />
in your pile too, that that should be thoroughly scrutinised<br />
so that the money which is available for advertising in the<br />
foreign language press goes to bona fide papers. Well you<br />
may ask who is going to be the judge. There again, there is<br />
no longer a Commonwealth Publicity Migration Advisory Council.<br />
There cannot be a judge but certain civil servants of the<br />
Department who do not know very much about it, only our<br />
names. So the re-establishment of it, the Commonwealth<br />
Publicity Advisory Council, with nominated representatives<br />
from the various media, not people picked in a haphazard way,<br />
willy-nilly, from various groups by the Minister either I<br />
won't say social-cl ' imbers but people who like to hear their<br />
own voice. The matter of the ethnic radio and the future of<br />
ethnic television, which has been in the news so much and is<br />
going to cost the Federal Government millions of dollars, has<br />
now developed into a kind of ( inaudible)<br />
they are now grabbing in the fields of the foreign language<br />
press in that respect that they become unjustified competition<br />
in the way of advertising, by announcing social functions from<br />
clubs and societies which previously used to be advertised in<br />
the foreign language press, even though ( inaudible), and this<br />
is for most of the ethnic radio programmes, as making obituary<br />
announcement, which used to be advertised, and all these kinds<br />
of things. This of course, is not in my opinion the task of<br />
radio stations but that is not the point. The various European<br />
countries, when radio and television started to take part of<br />
the income away from the press, a certain slice of what was<br />
spent on that was given to the press during a period of years<br />
as a kind of compensation and either the ethnic radios stop<br />
from giving free advertising or a certain slice of the money<br />
spent on them should be spent, as a compensation, on the<br />
foreign language press. These are only a very few points.<br />
Mr. Prime Minister I have been fighting in the front line of<br />
this foreign language press interest for the last 27-28 years<br />
and this maybe my swan song, because I am getting a bit old<br />
and a bit tired of it. The frustration that we had to go<br />
through in the past five-six years has taken a lot out of us<br />
because when we write letters like the ones you have there in<br />
front of you and there is no reply and there is a flat refusal<br />
to come and discuss it with us, well you can understand how<br />
the frustration works on us and how the problem costs us years<br />
of our lives which is neither here nor there. We want to be<br />
constructive. We want ( inaudible) in which a Government can<br />
help us financially by a concessional postage rate for which<br />
we have been fighting for 25 years and always been put off<br />
in an officious way when we are losing already so much money.<br />
On the other hand, millions are spent on other things like<br />
ethnic radio. Also, a fair deal of Government advertising<br />
channelled into the right channels, in the bona fide newspapers<br />
and not frittered away in any way. And if, after fighting for<br />
27 years, something can be achieved by this talk with you,<br />
well I can put my head to rest in a couple of years ( inaud). / 14 </p>
<p>-4<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
Thank you for that question. It's my understanding that the<br />
Minister, Mr. MacKellar, does make himself available very<br />
frequently for discussions with different people, including<br />
the ethnic press. I've said at the outset that I have wanted<br />
to have meetings with you more frequently than I have in<br />
the past, but this isn't the first ethnic press conference<br />
that I have had in Sydney, although I think there are more people<br />
here than there have been on other occasions. It is not the<br />
first by any means and I recognise some familiar faces amongst<br />
you. You raise two problems: the question of postage of ethnic<br />
newspapers is not one that it would be easy to confine merely<br />
to ethnic press. It really wouldn't. I live in a country part<br />
of Australia where, when I first became a Member of Parliament,<br />
there were about 14 local newspapers. Now they were small<br />
regional newspapers servicing a small country town, small country<br />
community maybe a slightly larger town like Warrnambool<br />
or Hamilton, one's 20,000 people the other's 10,000 people.<br />
I have had many more representations from them about postage and<br />
newspapers than I think you might have made to the Commonwealth<br />
in your interests. But the interest and the concern is the<br />
same. We've sought to see that changes in postage rates hasn't<br />
worked too much against the interests of ethnic press, or small<br />
regional newspapers, because we recognise the importance of<br />
the papers and recognise that they have a responsibility to<br />
serve their own communities or their own regions. I will talk<br />
with Tony Staley, the Minister for Post and Telecommunications,<br />
about the present position and see what is planned for the future<br />
and I will have a look at the position with him. But it is<br />
a long-standing position, as you made plain. It doesn't only<br />
concern you, it concerns a number of other newspaper proprietorsnot<br />
the great national dailies but the small local country, or<br />
regional newspapers.<br />
The point on advertising is an important one and over a period<br />
of six or seven years the sums the Commonwealth spends on<br />
advertising quite directly in the ethnic press has gone from<br />
I think about $ 5,000 a year to about $ 250,000 a year. Now you<br />
might say that it ought to be much more than that but we recognise<br />
the importance of advertising and making sure that Government<br />
programmes are understand and to assist you in servicing your<br />
own people. Again, I will have a look at future plans for<br />
advertising in that area. We have made considerable strides in<br />
recent times in quite directly increasing the sums available<br />
for advertising in ethnic media. That p olicy will be continued.<br />
The question of competition between ethnic press and ethnic radio<br />
isn't one that I had put to me before. I can see that it has<br />
its sensititivies and maybe has its difficulties. I think there<br />
was a need, is a need, to encourage ethnic radio and later<br />
ethnic television. I can understand your concerns in relation<br />
to that and let me say I will talk to both Tony Staley and<br />
Michael MacKellar on that particular point. </p>
<p>Question: (" Unification" Russian)<br />
Diplomatic and non-diplomatic staff , representatives from the<br />
Soviet Union are travelling freely in Australia, completely<br />
without any ( inaudible). They are visiting centres like<br />
Geelong, in Victoria, Newcastle in NSW and other places, and<br />
they are communicating constantly with ( inaudible) of the Soviet..<br />
in Australia. My question is, do our Australian representatives,<br />
diplomatic, trade, etc., have the same degree of freedom of<br />
movement and communication in the USSR and if not, why not?<br />
Second question is: Soviet publications of all sorts, and films,<br />
are distributed in Australia at very low prices. In fact, it<br />
would amount to the dumping of Soviet publication on the<br />
Australian market and this is done also without any restrictions<br />
whatsoever. The question is; do our Australian publishing and<br />
film companies have the same unrestricted access to the market<br />
in the USSR and if not, why not? Would you not sir agree,<br />
that if the answers to the above questions are in the negative,<br />
that this situation is in direct contravention of the Helsinki<br />
Agreement to which our Government, you sir, are in direct support.<br />
The third questions concerns the defence and I am referring to<br />
the recent statement of the President of RSL in NSW, ( inaudible),<br />
who expressed concern for the safety of this country, which is<br />
certain when the Soviet ( inaudible) military agression and<br />
revolution. They also called-* on your Government to increase<br />
defence spending and look into the possibility of creating an<br />
Australian nuclear deterrent force. Do you agree with Sir Colin's<br />
assessment of the situation and if yes, what practical steps<br />
may be taken by the Government in this direction?<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
No, our diplomats and officials don't move as freely around the<br />
Soviet Union, by any means, as theirs do around Australia and<br />
our publications don't get free issue in the Soviet Union as<br />
theirs do in Australia. The-reason for both these things<br />
I think is a very simple one. Australia is a free and it is an<br />
open society and we believe that that is one of our great<br />
strengths. The Soviet Union is not a free society. It is<br />
not an open society. To that extent it is a fearful society.<br />
We are not going to change Soviet leaders in*-these particular<br />
matters overnight. With their present philosophy, maybe not at<br />
all. But because they do that I don't think is any reason for<br />
Australia to move away from its principles of freedom. We know<br />
what Soviet officials are, we know what they can do. We know<br />
the contacts they try to make. But at the same time I have<br />
a great confidence in all Australians, wherever they come from<br />
and how ever long they have been here, that they will be able to<br />
judge matters in their own-right. I-f-we sought to inhibit the<br />
movement of Soviet officials, or prevent the publication of<br />
Soviet magazines and whatever in Australia, I think we would only<br />
be exhibiting a fear and a concern of their influence which<br />
would be totally unjustified. As a free people, in these issues,<br />
it is not we who have something to fear, it is the Soviet Union<br />
in a sense. It is in defiance of the Helsinki Accords. I don't<br />
know who ever thought the Helsinki Accords would ever be put<br />
fully into effect. They are an ideal, but it indicates the kind<br />
of exchange that seems very difficult to achieve in relation<br />
to the Soviet, Communism, Eastern Bloc countries. I think we need<br />
to live and hope for the day that it will come because it will be<br />
6 </p>
<p>-6<br />
Prime Minister: ( continued)<br />
a better world and hopefully a safer and more peaceful one<br />
if there is wider communication amongst peoples.<br />
I did see those statements about defence. I don't say I<br />
entirely agree with them. We do spend significant sums on<br />
defence each year and in spite of some of the recent publicity,<br />
we are spending, each year in our budgets, we have been giving<br />
a real increase in expenditure to the defence forces. In one of<br />
our predecessor's years they spent something under 6 percent<br />
of the defence vote on new capital equipment, for example. Now<br />
we've that up to something approaching 15 percent. We think it<br />
is not high enough but it is important that Australian forces<br />
be as well equipped as possible with the best possible most<br />
modern equipment. Therefore,, we want to increase further the<br />
proportion of the defence vote spent on equipment. That does<br />
mean, to maximise that objective, that we have had to squeeze<br />
if you like, some current activities. The defence forces are<br />
tremendous consumers in current terms, in terms of their activities.<br />
A large military exercise is a very expensive thing to mount.<br />
Some current activities have been made more restrained with the<br />
objective of getting a larger total vote going into capital<br />
equipment. I think that is a sensible course to take under<br />
present, circumstances. I think you will also know that, because<br />
I've said this publicly before, that quite recently I ordered a<br />
new analysis of Australia's strategic position having in mind<br />
the changes in Afghanistan, in Iran, in Indochina and having<br />
in mind Soviet activities in the horn of Africa. We have also<br />
taken decisions which will involve the defence vote growing at<br />
a slightly faster rate than was envisaged at the time of the<br />
last Budget. We are conscious of these concerns. I don't believe<br />
Australia opting for a nuclear option would really make<br />
Australia safer, not at the present time. In that area we need<br />
to understand the major international objectives of non-proliferatio;.<br />
If more and more countries come to possess nuclear weapons the<br />
chances of somebody unfortunately or irrationally or unreasonably<br />
putting their hands on a nuclear trigger at the wrong time would<br />
be increased. I am not in favour of that. We have our alliances,<br />
as you know. Wle have confidence in those alliances and we<br />
work in close and harmonious relationship with our near neighbours<br />
in Southeast Asia and not only with the United States across<br />
the Pacific,, but with Japan and China. All in all, I think the<br />
direction of Australia's foreign and defence policy is a<br />
sensible one and a constructive one. I recognisethe concerns<br />
that you express and anyone would need to when you have one<br />
of the major superpowers spenlding 12 percent of its gross<br />
national product on defence purposes year after year after year.<br />
That is a cause for concern.<br />
Question: ( inaudible)<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
No, 14 percent of its gross national product, or 12% to 14%.<br />
That's about as much as Germany was in 1938 so in a sense that<br />
puts it into perspective. We are not the only country to express<br />
concern. I did first on behalf of the Government in June 1976<br />
but the concerns I then expressed have been repeated many times<br />
by the Liberal, Conservative, or Socialist countries of 7 </p>
<p>7-<br />
Prime Minister ( continued)<br />
Western Europe -the NATO countries. They have expressed<br />
the same concerns at the Soviet military build-up which would<br />
seem to be out of all proportion to the self-defence needs<br />
of the Soviet Union.<br />
Question: ( Ethnic Newsweek)<br />
I don't know whether we are member of the ethnic press or<br />
the foreign language press. Our magazine is an English<br />
language magazine but it specialises in ethnic affairs. Since<br />
the invitation is for ethnic press, we decided to come.<br />
My question relates to the area of participation. In the<br />
Calbally Report it is very strongly recommended that ethnic,<br />
or people of ethnic origin, basicallybe given the opportunity<br />
to serve in the areas of ethnic affairs. Would the Government<br />
consider seriously, in the future, that participation is of<br />
so much importance to this nation that the areas of ethnic affairs,<br />
and for that matter other areas, that migrants, people of<br />
non-English speaking backgrounds, be considered in the policy<br />
making a'reas. whether it be Government, or semi-Government<br />
institution and so on.<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
I think we already seek to do this and if there are deficiencies<br />
in the present procedures I would certainly like to have your<br />
views about-that. The Galbally Report itself was a result of<br />
very extensive communication, consultation, with ethnic communities.<br />
The fact that the Report was born out of that consultation<br />
and that is has been accepted by Government, I think has been<br />
widely welcomed by those communities and indeed where one or<br />
two programmes under the Galbally general programme are not<br />
quite up to scratch the original timetable its as much<br />
as anything because of the nature and extent of consultation<br />
that its been necessary, not only with ethnic communities but<br />
also sometimes with State Governments and with other groups who<br />
are involved in the delivery of services. Continuing consultation<br />
is a very important part of that programme. There are ethnic<br />
community councils being established in the States and in other<br />
areas the Northern Territory and right around Australia. There<br />
is the National Ethnic Broadcasting Advisory Committee NEBAC<br />
and State ethnic broadcasting advisory committees.<br />
What we are seeking to do is to establish a wide network of<br />
communication and consultation and that will be a continuing<br />
policy. If there are particular areas where you think there has<br />
been not adequate communication, not necessarily but afterwards<br />
or whatever you like, I would like to hear that. I recently<br />
announced that the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs<br />
is going to be assisted in terms of general communication by<br />
members of Parliament coming from Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane,<br />
and whatever, and their purpose is a very direct liaison one<br />
between the Minister and ethnic communities and most of the<br />
members of existing consultative bodies ethnic advisory<br />
councils and the other bodies I mentioned; are people themselves<br />
who have ethnic backgrounds. The Migrant Settlement Councils<br />
in the State and the Settlement Committees at hostels will help<br />
communication again, at that level. Again, on those bodies,<br />
our purpose is to have as many people as possible with ethnic<br />
backgrounds and two-way flow of information is very essential. / 8 </p>
<p>8-<br />
Prime Minister: ( continued)<br />
If there are areas where the network of communication is<br />
proving to be inadequate, I would certainly like to hear<br />
about it and I am sure the Minister would.<br />
Question: I will, if you don't mind, later on send you a letter,<br />
because my question would be much longer than that,. to<br />
draw your attention to probably some of the areas I mentioned.<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
I would welcome that very much and this is one of the purposes<br />
of this kind of press conference, so that if you think there<br />
are deficiencies in communication or in the nature of programmes<br />
I can understand what you feel about it.<br />
Question: I was mainly interested in the policy-making area of<br />
Government appointments in areas which relate to ethnic<br />
affairs and ethnic services.<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
Within the Public Service itself?<br />
Question: Within the Public Service itself.<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
I would certainly support that objective.<br />
Question:<br />
Within the Public Service and without.<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
I would certainly support that objective and I would like to<br />
see more people with an ethnic background breaking through into<br />
higher reaches of the Public Service. I have not the slightest<br />
doubt about that. This is something that I can bring to the<br />
attention of the Chairman of the Public Service Board. I think<br />
you know in our system, I wouldn't want to change it in this<br />
context, the Public Service makes its own appointments and<br />
they are subject to appeal and all the safeguards. I don't<br />
believe in a system that would lead to politically-based<br />
appointments and therefore the Government doesn't say that<br />
a particular person must be in a Public Service position.<br />
The general objective of trying to get more people with an<br />
ethnic background involved in the ( inaudible) of the Public<br />
Service I think is a very good objective and one that I would<br />
want to see implemented. / 9 </p>
<p>9-<br />
Question: ( Polish News)<br />
I have just recently come back from living in England for<br />
two years, or just under two years, and its a slightly<br />
different ethnic problem in the sense that the Australians<br />
in England. There are two newspapers there, there London-Australian<br />
Magazine and the Australasian Express, which is often the<br />
only means of ( inaud.) news of what is happening in Australia.<br />
I was in the lucky position that I got information from Australia<br />
so I could get ( inaudible) but the journals are extremely<br />
biased and coloured in reporting the news and what is happening<br />
and what is the purpose of various Government policies ( inaud)<br />
restrictions and so on. It is not only read by Australians<br />
in London but it is read by a great majority of English people.<br />
There is such an influx of tourists. These magazines are given<br />
out free so obviously they are going to pick these journals<br />
up. They are picked up by Germans, they are picked up by<br />
the French and so on. This is a very important way of communicating<br />
matters and if people get it in a biased way, and one example<br />
I can give is that if I may so, there was a picture of yourself<br />
and it said ' What has Fraser done for Australia r turn to<br />
Page 16'. And you turn to page 16-and there is a blank column.<br />
It got me mad. Is there anything one can do or can something<br />
can happen. I am sure you get communications from Australia ( inaud).<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
I think getting adequate news of Australia overseas is a very<br />
real problem. I think the reporting, not only in those two<br />
journals, but also in the British press generally of Australia is<br />
minimal and is often biased. When you look at the byline and<br />
find out who wrote the bit, you generally find somebody in<br />
Australia who you wouldn't ( inaudible) might have written it.<br />
I don't know what you do about those two journals. I would like<br />
to know who sponsors them and funds them. It would be interesting<br />
to find out I think.<br />
Question: Is the Australian Government considering the relocation of<br />
the present Australian Embassy in Beruit, to Damascus, Syria.<br />
If so, have they given strong consideration to the inconvenience<br />
and hardship that this may cause some 140,000 Lebanese people,<br />
of Lebanese origin in Australia and their first and second<br />
generation families considering that the Syrian population<br />
is only ( inaudible).<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
We are very much concerned with the problems that have been<br />
present in Lebanon and the difficulties that has caused and<br />
the concern that that has caused for many thousands of Lebanese<br />
who are living in Australia; concerns not only for their<br />
relatives and families but concern also for their friends in<br />
Lebanon. The circumstances haven't always been very easy in<br />
maintaining Australia's own embassies and offices opened as<br />
you know, and there have been troubles in the past. I am not<br />
aware of any present move or decision to alter the location.<br />
I will make some inquiries to see if at any other level that<br />
has been suggested. I do know that there has been concern about </p>
<p>10<br />
Prime Minister: ( continued)<br />
the capacity of Australia's offices in Lebanon to be able<br />
to carry on their job effectively and to be able to provide<br />
the very kinds of services that you are talking about so that<br />
there can be adequate liaison and adequate servicing of<br />
people who have friends or relatives, or people who potentially<br />
might want to come to Australia, to migrate. I am afraid you<br />
will have to forgive me. I will see if I can get you any<br />
more precise detail and let you know.<br />
Question:<br />
Would the Prime Minister give strong consideration to<br />
consultations ( inaudible).<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
Yes, certainly. That can be done. During some of the<br />
particular difficulties in Lebanon, both the Foreign Minister<br />
and Michael MacKellar, on at least one occasion, myself I was<br />
personally involved in direct communication with leaders<br />
of the Lebanese community about their concerns. That will<br />
certainly continue.<br />
Question: / 11 </p>
<p>11<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
If the plane lands I suspect it wouldn't be. The point you<br />
put would seem to be reasonable and I will take that up<br />
with Peter Nixon and get you a fuller reply in relation to it.<br />
I think the question that you put recognises the point but<br />
if the cheap fares are to be a reality and are to be maintained,<br />
that does depend upon keeping the loadings in the aircraft<br />
up. That's why we've had to reconstruct international air fares<br />
policy, to get higher loadings so that we can at the same time<br />
get cheaper fares. In the areas where agreements have already<br />
been made the policy is working well. The fares have been cut<br />
very greatly, as you know, between Britain, Germany and<br />
Yugoslavia. Fares have been cut by a third and in some areas<br />
by up to 50 percent. There are very substantial additional<br />
bookings, in tens and tens, even up to a couple of hundred<br />
thousand additional bookings as a result. We are in the process<br />
of negotiating cheaper air fares with other countries. There<br />
are negotiations proceeding at the moment with Greece, Italy,<br />
France and the Netherlands. I think the negotiations with<br />
Greece are fairly well advanced, maybe one or two problems still<br />
to be overcome. We are conscious, in particular I think, of<br />
the benefit that the lower air fares at certain times of the year<br />
can be to members of ethnic communities in Australia, again, to<br />
their friends or relatives in their country of origin. We will<br />
be pressing on with the programme with as many countries as<br />
possible. The particular point that you asked about a person<br />
being allowed to get off if the plane is stopping at a certain<br />
point, if they are prepared to pay the full fare right through<br />
from the end point to end point, it is an interesting question<br />
which I will follow up and again, I will write to you in a more<br />
detailed way about the answer.<br />
Question: we heard the story about some passengers being disallowed<br />
to disembark * in Damascus and they had to go to Europe because<br />
they bought cheap tickets<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
Let me follow that up and I will get a more detailed answer<br />
for you.<br />
Question: ( Turkish co-ordinator, Ethnic Radio)<br />
The matter I would like to raise with you deals with radio ethnic<br />
radio. We have a problem. The time that is given to us, for<br />
all languages, starts from 6: 00 am until midnight and there is<br />
no possible way to accomodate all languages to their satisfaction...<br />
I know that the Government has made available money and the<br />
frequency will be changed in July and we will have a higher, or<br />
more powerful, transmittor. When that thing happens the<br />
frequency will change. My suggestion, if you could consider this<br />
matter, that the present frequency which will be left when the<br />
new frequency will become available, could it be re-allocated<br />
to ethnic radio hence giving better distribution of time... / 12 </p>
<p>12<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
You want two ethnic radios two frequencies?<br />
Question: Two frequencies. The same radio. It will not cost the<br />
Government more than, at an educated guess, roughly around<br />
$ 50,000 to $ 100,000 a year and I can assure you that it will<br />
not cost you more than that.<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
Let me take that up with Mr. Staley also.<br />
Question: The second matter I would like to raise with you deals<br />
with a similar problem to the previous... . but not quite the<br />
same, because Damascus is served by Qantas airlines. But no<br />
city in Turkey is served by Qantas airlines, therefore the<br />
Turkish traffic would have to go via another place and whilst<br />
in the off-peak period somebody pays $ 566 to go to London,<br />
at all times the minimum amount of money to be spent is $ 1,140,<br />
which is two-thirds of the distance. I think that's a terrible<br />
anomaly and the only reason-why Qantas will be coming to the<br />
party is because Qantas doesn't fly through Turkey.<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
The cheaper air fares are only possible when you get a high<br />
loading on an end point to end point so that the aircraft is<br />
being used. We need to understand also that those cheaper<br />
are only available for part of the year and then they rise<br />
depending on how busy the season is. When you haven't got a<br />
great deal of traffic to a particular location it is very difficult<br />
to provide the same sort of service. This is one of the real<br />
problems. Question: I have figures supplied by the Department of Transport which<br />
justify an end to end traffic to Turkey...<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
77 passengers?<br />
Question: Yes, an averagQ of 77.<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
Yes, but with a 747 they want about 400 don't they? / 13 </p>
<p>13<br />
Question: That's not for end to end, that's stopover, and that justifies<br />
the international airlines<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
Let me take that up with Mr. Nixon. I will again advise you.<br />
( TAPE TURNED)<br />
Question: Community Relations, Mr. Grassby, might be about to seek<br />
re-endorsement for his old Federal seat of Riverina.<br />
Any reaction to that?<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
Not really, no. Did you expect one?<br />
Question: ( Time of Lebanon)<br />
I am President of the Australian-Lebanese National Liberal Party<br />
in Australia and in New Zealand. I have a very problem.<br />
The problem is my husband has... . because we have here a lot of<br />
Australian and the family is here expect the one in<br />
Lebanon. He has no home, no money and you know what is happening<br />
now in Lebanon. He has come to Immigration ( inaudible)<br />
Immigration does not give him any form<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
He wants a tourist visa, does he, to come...<br />
Question: Tourist ( inaudible).<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
Can you give me the name and address of the person.<br />
Question: Yes, I have a lot of names and addresses, and we have a problem<br />
with these people, really.<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
I thoughtit was one person -it's several people?<br />
Question: I will give you one my brother-in-law and we<br />
we are all here. We have houses, we have the money, we<br />
can look after him and his family. He has no house, he has no<br />
work he is a sick I have a problem. I cannot bring him<br />
from Lebanon. </p>
<p>14<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
You give me his name and address and I will look into that<br />
for you.<br />
Questioi: ( Australian Chinese Community Association Kip Fong)<br />
Recently the Community has been asking these questions regarding<br />
the ( inaudible) system on selecting migrants. A lot of people in<br />
the community feel that it is rather an unfair sort of system<br />
because the method of selection they have got to be fluent<br />
in English and so on some of these people who came from a<br />
country in which English was not taught, so therefore<br />
would be minimising their chances of migrating to Australia although<br />
they might be qualified in other fields. Some other aspects people<br />
are looking at although the White Australia policy is supposed<br />
to be abolished, but it seems to be to these people now that<br />
the ( inaudible) system in some sort of a way is introducing this<br />
policy again similar to the education test.<br />
The other point the community also raises regarding family<br />
reunions. Some people having their families back in China, for<br />
instance, they try for those people to come over here and<br />
the Australian Government's attitude is this: you go and get<br />
a visa from China before we consider at this end. But over in<br />
China, the other end,, they say right, you get approval from<br />
Australia before we give you an exit visa. So this sort of a<br />
is getting nowhere and also people are getting rather<br />
frustrated about it.<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
The last point is in relation to people in China?<br />
Question: Yes, in China.<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
And getting a visa from China before they get permission to<br />
come to Australia?<br />
Question: The Australian Government requires an exit visa from the<br />
Chinese Government before they would consider the application in<br />
Australia to entry permit. So the other says you show<br />
the approval from the Australian Government before we give you<br />
an exit permit. So how are we going to solve this...<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
Are you trying to say that you need approval from us before<br />
they will give you an exit permit?<br />
Question: I have seen those problems, yes. </p>
<p>15<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
Well let me look into that because if both Governments are<br />
saying that somebody has got to move first.<br />
Question: I have already raised that sort of a question with the<br />
Ambassador of China.<br />
Prime Minister;<br />
Let me look into that and see, because quite plainly it won't<br />
work if both Governments are saying somebody else has got to<br />
move first. So let me look into that for you. NUMAS as you<br />
know if a new system of assessment. On all the advice available<br />
to us we were led to believe that it would be a fairer system<br />
overall and a more just system. English ability has always been<br />
given some weight in migrant selection and it continues to<br />
be a factor,, but I am not aware that it is given a greater weight<br />
than it has in the past. Fluency is not required, certainly.<br />
English is the language spoken by most people here and to the<br />
extent that one can speak English you are going to be able<br />
they are going to able to settle in and beat problems there are<br />
better. I am advised that there are some cases where the new<br />
system doesn't seem to accurately reflect the acceptability of<br />
people and there is discretion from senior officials in such<br />
cases. In a sense, there are exemptions in certain areas; for<br />
aged parents. Refugees don't have to reach the minimum<br />
pass rate to be able to come to Australia, for example.<br />
I think, quite plainly, it is a new system and wel are going to have<br />
to-reassess it. But you've got to know or look at the source<br />
of migrants to Australia in recent years to know that what was<br />
called the White Australia Policy is totally and absolutely<br />
dead and that's the way it is going to remain.<br />
Question: The ethnic radio you might be aware they are using<br />
very often materials supplied by various consulates, or<br />
foreign affairs, the embassies, from behind the iron curtian.<br />
They are used as material which is broadcast, through the<br />
ethnic radio in various languages. That material, as you can<br />
suspect, disguise or just direct propoganda materi~ al very<br />
biased. How can we and what can be done to stop the<br />
influence of foreign embassies or consulates to interfere<br />
with the activities of the ethnic radios which are run by the<br />
Government funds.<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
They are run by Government funds but not run by Government<br />
because we believe that<br />
Question: But using the funds / 16 </p>
<p>16<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
They are using the funds, but it is not the Government that<br />
determines the programmes. I think it would be a very bad thing<br />
if it was a Government that determines the programmes.<br />
To the extent that a particular community is not satisfied. with<br />
the nature of the programmes in that community's language time,<br />
I would have thought then, through consultation with those<br />
responsible for ethnic radio, that they should try to seek<br />
to influence that through your own ways. The special<br />
broadcasting service has been created as an independent statutory<br />
body to do a job. Wle don't want Government day-to-day decision<br />
making. I could think of nothing worse, for example, and. the<br />
Government have to resolve the very difficult question as to<br />
which communities are to get which time and how much time. Now,<br />
that's a matter that<br />
Question: It is not a question of time.<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
I know it's not but I'm just giving-an example of how I think it<br />
would be a bad thing is a Government was interferring and I<br />
think it would be a bad thing if a Government was interferring<br />
with the material that is used. from ethnic radio. I don't<br />
know if any of you who are from ethnic radio want to help me<br />
answer the question.<br />
Question: ( Inaudible)... . ethnic radio.. . serves the purposes of the community<br />
residing in Australia. It pays not attention to Governments..<br />
no interest in relating any Government, or any consulate or<br />
embassies'information. The concern we have within ethnic<br />
radio is to serve the communities as they reside here. They are<br />
not divided into programmes for nationalities. There is no<br />
French programme because.. there is a French language programme,<br />
or Arabic language programme the subdivision of cultures<br />
this is the tradition and divisions within Australia as such.<br />
There are instances... . where possibly some material being issued<br />
by consulates or embassies, or cultural attaches may reach particular<br />
broadcasters who think that it is valuable material and they may<br />
decide... . to use it. I would suggest, from my experience..<br />
this is certainly not a very frequent occurrance and would suggest<br />
that any safeguards which are needed We agree with the principle.<br />
We agree that we are not working for any country or any government<br />
overseas. -Governments change-, may change, political, geographical<br />
boundaries may change we are concerned with the cultural<br />
definition of ethnic groups within Australia<br />
so any safeguards they may wish to have are welcome, but fromn my<br />
experience I can assure you that this is not 7-I have<br />
Question: I am a member of NEBAK and this subject was brought before NEBAK<br />
on several occasions but unfortunately there was not evidence as<br />
to what was put on that was supplied by different type of governments,<br />
and unfortunately this was not If there are evidences, I am<br />
sure they will be taken care of. / 17 </p>
<p>17<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
The statement of objectives and purposes which we had from the<br />
back of room, is one that I would certainly support.<br />
Question: The answer to all that lies in the system; the ethnic radios<br />
and when we we know that militants they are the ones that<br />
are active on a voluntary basis. What we call moderates ususally<br />
are self and that is the whole crux of the problems. They are<br />
either militants-or people who like to the answer is in the<br />
wholesystem when<br />
Question.: I am from the German newspaper and I must say that I am<br />
28 years, nearly 29 years in Australia and I am sick and tired<br />
always to be called ethnic and foreigner I think we should<br />
sit together one day and work how can we do a good Australia<br />
not to bludge this country we have so many bludgers here<br />
already. $ 60 million for bludging the country who is listening<br />
to the radio ( Inaudible)...<br />
Do we need this. We came here to live in peace and we would like<br />
to live in peace. If we could ask the community what the community<br />
says about the Australian public, we spend Australian money not<br />
our money it's all our money together because we have to pay<br />
very high rates for people to get $ S0 or $ 60 to produce one hour,<br />
plus all the comes together.<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
I think there are many people who have come here from many places<br />
who only want to be known as Australians. But at the same time<br />
I think Australia is made a richer place and a better place if<br />
the cultural heritage that people bring with them when they come<br />
to Australia can be preserved, enhanced, and mingles in and produces<br />
something distinctively Australia. I agree with you wholeheartedly.<br />
Arguments from other lands ought to be left behind. We don't want<br />
them in Australia.<br />
Question: We did this for 28 years. We have our German clubs here, we have<br />
our German Saturday school, as most of the countries have their own.<br />
I am born in Rumania as a German in Rumania. we used to keep<br />
our culture but we used to be very good Rumanian citizens. This is<br />
what we can be Polish, German or anything in this country. You<br />
have a lot of German people here of German descent people in<br />
the country. They are good people but they don't come to the<br />
country " please can we have something" because they are paying<br />
their rates. / 18 </p>
<p>18<br />
Question: Could I ask you a question in relation to amnesty. There has<br />
been a lot of comment in Australia, in various States, that an<br />
amnesty can be considered, or should be considered for what<br />
is called there are about 30,000 40,000 illegal migrants.<br />
These people have come out here under different circumstances<br />
and there is an argument for and against on the fact that by<br />
giving them amnesty they can start a proper new life with the<br />
possibility with more rewards in the nation's ( inaud)<br />
it causes the problem of having to send them back. I'm sure<br />
that the majority of migrants believe that an amnesty should be<br />
considered. Would you be able to consider what are your comments<br />
on that?<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
. Can certainly consider, but I think there are some real problems.<br />
There was an amnesty shortly after we came into office and therefore<br />
anyone who has come here or who was here then as an illegal<br />
migrant could have come forward. Anyone who has come here since<br />
could have come here, or sought to come, under the immigration<br />
rules as they are. With unemployment as it has been in Australia,<br />
migration intake has necessarily had to be restricted. We have tried<br />
to do that in the fairest way possible, giving priority to family<br />
reunions and other matters-to people who have particular skills<br />
in short supply in Australia. For every, if you like, illegal<br />
immigrant or somebody who comes here trying to jump around the<br />
rules that have necessarily been established when you have a<br />
limitation on the overall number, it means somebody who sticks with<br />
the rules is not able to come. I think there are very real<br />
difficulties and we have a second amnesty now, in two or three<br />
years people will say, " oh, they will have a third", and this will<br />
tend to encourage illegal immigration with people saying well,<br />
we can come out to Australia and hide around for a year or two<br />
until the next amnesty comes. It is not as simple as just having<br />
an amnesty and then you get rid of the problem. I don't think<br />
you do. It is a very difficult one in times when economic<br />
circumstances cause us to have a limitation on the overall programme.<br />
Question: Can I add a question. At the time when the amnesty was announced,<br />
it was claimed that there were about 50," 000 illegal migrants<br />
only 7,000 or 8,000 of them came forward and the others didn't.<br />
Would it be possible to reconsider the same amnesty with the same<br />
conditions, except with a different deadline?<br />
Prime Minis-ter:<br />
So that anyone who has come since wouldn't qualify?<br />
Question:<br />
No. ./ 19 </p>
<p>19<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
Why would you think that people who didn't come forward then<br />
would come forward again? They've already had one chance to<br />
come forward.<br />
Question: The reason why I am putting this is because of the fact<br />
that I don't know what reasons they had... . but since these people<br />
are here in our society and they have been here long enough, they<br />
are in hiding and they are not taking anything more than what<br />
have... . wouldn't it be more humane to give them another chance<br />
to come forward. They would have qualified in 31 December 1975,<br />
so could they, and only them, be given another chance?<br />
It's not another amnesty it's..<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
In a sense it is. It's another amnesty because it is different<br />
in time scale and if you did that people would say, why is this<br />
a restricted amnesty for some illegal immigrants and not for<br />
others. I think it, again, would be in difficulty. I don't rule<br />
this approach out completely but I do say there are difficulties<br />
and make the point that when you have a restriction on the total<br />
number that you think you can take during a period of relatively<br />
high unemployment, that breaches of the rules, or amnesties, can<br />
pose very real problems. One of the things that we seek to do<br />
in Australia is make sure the migration programme remains something<br />
which the broad general community can and does support. If a<br />
programme is too large at a time of high unemployment, it would<br />
soon be something which became divisive within the Australian<br />
community and then that would be bad. That would prejudice the<br />
interests of those who have a continuing concern for migration<br />
programmes and hopefully as economic circumstances improve, for<br />
a larger programme. I hear what you are saying, I will discuss<br />
it with Michael MacKellar but I don't want to unduly arouse<br />
hopes because I think there are difficulties.<br />
Question: Could I add one point to the last question.. why didn't they<br />
come out at the time, why would they come out now? . there was<br />
an enormous fear amongst these people that this was just an<br />
excuse to bring them out of hiding and then ( inaudible).<br />
You might say it was unjustified fear because the Government has<br />
always been fair in treating them, but when people are in hiding<br />
for a long time they tend to develop a number of<br />
for this reason a great number of those who could have and would<br />
have at the time come out, did not take the chance...<br />
when it was seen afterwards, the result of the fact that those<br />
( inaud) This is one of the reasons why it did happen at the<br />
time and one of the reasons why it could...<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
I'm glad for the implied vote of confidence in our attitude to<br />
Australians in relation to that. </p>
<p>20<br />
Question: In the last years some publicity has been given to the so-called<br />
rift between the Maltese Government and the Australian Government.<br />
In this year, a mnember of Parliament, namely Mr. Allan Cadman,<br />
visited Malta in an unofficial capacity. I believe he managedto<br />
establish good contact with both sides of the Parliament in<br />
Malta. Are there any plans for the Australian Government to help<br />
Malta in its endeavour to become fully an independent nation,<br />
regarding economy, etc.<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
I'm not quite sure what role Australia could play in that.<br />
As I understand it one of the problems was because the Government<br />
of Malta I think expected Australia to provide a good deal of<br />
foreign aid to Malta. Now, foreign aid, as you know, has been<br />
concentrated in other areas geographically closer to Australia,<br />
and my Government didn't believe that supplying Malta with<br />
substantial foreign aid was really a foreign policy objective of<br />
the Government the resources are limited and the needs in a<br />
number of countries closer to Australia was of more importance,<br />
largely because they come from our own region or geographic area.<br />
Now, as I understand it, this was at the basis of much of the<br />
concern of the Government of Malta with Australia. So far as I<br />
am concerned, the argument is all one way. I have no quarrel<br />
with the Government of Malta at all.* For some reason they seem<br />
to have had a quarrel with us. I'm not quite sure why.<br />
Question: I understand, sir, that Malta was being opened to the Australian<br />
Government, as far as concerned, to use it as a base for Australian<br />
goods for the shipment to Europe. Say, for instance, establishing<br />
factories in Malta, say, like exporting butter from here, going to<br />
the Common Market<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
That that was our policy or their policy?<br />
Question: No Malta's policy. One of the talks that we I'll let you<br />
go on.<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
We would certainly be very attracted if Malta could help us<br />
to get into markets in Europe.<br />
Question: there ever any, ( inaud). ./ 21 </p>
<p>21<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
I haven't heard of that but I will certainly follow<br />
that point up.<br />
Question: ( Croatian Weekly)<br />
You mentioned earlier that your Government has increased<br />
expenditure from $ 5,000 to nearly $ 1/ 4 million. I presume<br />
you meant for the ethnic press. My question is, what criteria<br />
is being used by the Government for its.., system, in<br />
allocating advertisements to the various ethnic newspapers.<br />
As the facts can prove that some of the newspapers get<br />
quite a large amount, in number, of Government paid advertisements,<br />
where the other newspapers ( inaud)<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
The only criteria I would be aware of is the relevance of<br />
the programme being advertised or the substance being advertised<br />
to the community served by the newspaper.<br />
Question: ( Inaud).. . what is of interest to one community is just of<br />
the same importance to the other part of the ethnic community<br />
of Australia and therefore....<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
In some programmes, yes, but in other cases no. I mentioned<br />
two centres being opened one at Liverpool and one at<br />
Woollongong. Well, advertising the opening of those centres<br />
is obviously only of relevance to the people in those communities<br />
and to the newspapers servicing them. It wouldn't be much good<br />
advertising in Melbourne about the Woollongong centre.<br />
Question:* Yes, but in general terms not only in local newspapers<br />
but in general terms of the ( inaudible) irrespective of<br />
what ethnic background that particular newspaper might represent.<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
Most general policies would clearly be of concern to all<br />
members of ethnic communities, I agree with that. I think there<br />
would be some judgement on the numbers of people serviced by<br />
particular papers also.<br />
Question: ( inaudible) Vietnamese community here, being a new community<br />
to Australia and we need a lot of information; news and so<br />
on and instructions about people. The ( Inaud) has been established<br />
to serve and because we are a new community and we are not...<br />
we do not have enough funds to run it. . stops until we get<br />
more money and we can run again. Already twice I have had the<br />
opportunity to contact, to meet, Mr. MacKellar and I submitted<br />
the matter to him. This is not my own idea but this idea has<br />
been proved in America that such a mechanism is needed for<br />
the newcomners to this country, especially the refugees. / 22 </p>
<p>22<br />
Question: ( continued)<br />
Twice I submit to Mr. MacKeliar and so far we haven't got<br />
any from his Department for this new I would like<br />
to take this opportunity to ask you, the Prime Minister<br />
especially, the consider the policy to set up some<br />
information leaflets to us every month at least in<br />
the... . of our settlement in Australia. If the Government is<br />
not capable of doing so, we would appreciate it if you<br />
give us some assistance financially, that you can donate<br />
continuously, not like now few months we stop, a<br />
few months we run again. ( Inaud) aware that we spent so<br />
money on the Galbally Report and you paid so much and I believe<br />
without the ethnic radio, without ethnic magazines or ethnic<br />
radio the people cannot appreciate it. So I suggest policy<br />
to help us in this matter, particularly on the information<br />
and news<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
There is a great deal of infEormation available in the<br />
Government service. A good deal of it is put together in a<br />
form which is meant to be of service and help to the media.<br />
I will make some enquiries to try and make sure that whatever<br />
we do have available is sent to you so that you can use what<br />
you want.<br />
Question:<br />
We ( inaud) every week the news from the ethnic affairs<br />
department. They are all in English but our difficulty is<br />
the money to buy paper, to buy ink, to run it..<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
You've approached Mr. MacKellar about that have you?<br />
Question:<br />
Twice. Prime Minister:<br />
How long ago?<br />
Question: It would be about eight months ago. I even gave to him a sample<br />
of the newspaper in Amer~ ica ( inaudible) In America it is<br />
published in two languages, English and Vietnamese. Somehow,<br />
until today, we have heard nothing about it, and I believe<br />
this Prime Minister:<br />
Let me take that up with Mr. MacKellar and see what's<br />
happened about it.<br />
Question: ( Greek newspaper)<br />
Thousands of people come to Australia, they have tourist visas. / 23 </p>
<p>23<br />
_ question:-( continued)<br />
You know the last trouble two weeks ago in Melbourne, the<br />
Greek people, the woman and girl married in Australia and<br />
their children born here ( inaud).. and sent back.<br />
I want to ask one question: if the people come here and<br />
make ( inaud) come Greece to here but have tourist<br />
visas -can stay here?...<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
If people break the rules in coming here and plainly so,<br />
I think they especially when there is a limit to the total<br />
number of migrants who can come to Australia in any one<br />
year they really need to understand there is a very difficult<br />
task in front of the Department if the rules are not applied<br />
because if somebody comes here on a tourist visa, or a<br />
visitor's visa, or if somebody comes here on a visa wanting<br />
to marry one girl and ends up by marrying another I think<br />
that's what happened in this case.--then that means somebody<br />
who has applied through the normal channels for permanent<br />
residence doesn't get here. Is that fair to them?<br />
Question:<br />
The mother and father are here they are Australian<br />
citizens. Prime Minister:<br />
I was talking about the parents and is it really fair to<br />
bend the rules for people who have deliberately bent the<br />
rules to get here and to try and stay here when there are<br />
others who apply, and taking some time to apply or to get<br />
into the country and do it in accordance with the rules.<br />
Every time we make an exception we are virtually saying<br />
somebody who wants to stick with the normal procedures and<br />
stay with it, well " sorry, you can't come, because we broke<br />
the rules for somebody else who themselves broke the rules".<br />
I think that if the rules had not been applied you would<br />
create a very considerable injustice for many other people.<br />
This creates difficulties, but the lesson out of it all is<br />
surely; look, we can understand there are rules, we can<br />
understand that there have to be limitations because of<br />
the number of people unemployed at the moment and therefore<br />
we ought to do what we can to discourage people to come<br />
here with the intent of breaking the immigration rules.<br />
Personally I would much sooner have the economic circumstances<br />
when we can say we love you all and want you all to come<br />
and stay here. But we haven't got that and if we did do<br />
that we would soon get total opposition from the trade union<br />
movement to additional migrants coming here, because they<br />
would say it is a threat to Australian jobs. We don't want<br />
that. We want to maintain the circumstances so that as<br />
the economy starts to pick up we are going to able to build<br />
up and expand the migration programme again. When you get<br />
people breaking the rules, as that young couple did with<br />
the young baby, they are making it hard for other people,<br />
they are making it hard who stay by the guidelines. They<br />
are miaking it hard for the administration and I don't think<br />
they serve their own commiunity well by really trying to put<br />
pressure on the Government or the Minister to breach the<br />
rules. I really don't. ./ 24 </p>
<p>24<br />
Question: But if the parents are here...<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
The parents?<br />
Question: Yes. Prime Minister:<br />
These two broke the rules. Quite plainly.<br />
Question:<br />
A thousand people break the rules every day coming to<br />
Australia... . break the law?<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
Break the law? Well basically if they'break the law in<br />
coming to Australia they don't stay here.<br />
Question: can stay here. Thousands come.. from everywhere.<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
That's a refugee situation and I think the judgements in<br />
a refugee situation are different. We've got a stated and<br />
public policy in relation to refugees. You do exert different<br />
standards, different rules, then. These are people who<br />
are just put out in boats, expelled from Vietnam with nowhere<br />
to go and there is an obligation on us and on other countries<br />
to try and do something thcre about a very real human tragedy.<br />
Question: The Government must thousands of complaints everywhere<br />
( inaudible)<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
The rules are plain and in the case you've quoted, the couple<br />
had broken the rules, very plainly. Some people say, I<br />
don't make the charge, but some people say the rules were<br />
broken deliberately. I -just don't think it's fair to people<br />
who stick with the rules. If we didn't have a limit on the<br />
migration programme these matters wouldn't be so important<br />
but the rules are known and one the things that we are seeking<br />
to do is to make sure that people who come here under<br />
visitor's visas, or whatever else, know the rules before they<br />
come and know that they don't get deceived by travel agents<br />
in some other country, for example, and don't get given<br />
wrong information which can lead them into difficult when<br />
they get here. That sometimes happens also.<br />
