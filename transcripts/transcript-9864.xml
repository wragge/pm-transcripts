TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
SPEECH AT THE MEMORIAL SERVICE FOR MR YITZHAK RABIN,<br />
CENTRAL SYNAGOGUE, BONDI JUNCTION, 3 DECEMBER 1995<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
Well Dr Oystragh, Ambassador, Consul-General, Rabbi Franklin, Rabbi Wolff, Rabbi<br />
Ingram, my Parliamentary colleague, ladies and gentlemen.<br />
Thank you very much indeed for paying me the honour of asking me to come on<br />
this occasion to remember Yitzhak Rabin and to remember what a significant life he<br />
had, and to recall the very great things he did for the Jewish people and for the<br />
State of Israel.<br />
I had never met him. He is one of the people when one goes through life and you<br />
often think I would like to meet this person. He was one of the people I would have<br />
liked to have met. But I never, ever, had the opportunity.<br />
But I always admired, obviously, his physical courage, his courage as a soldier and<br />
a politician and remember well some of the things which have already been said<br />
about his work, about his role in 1948 and in 1967, and how much and how<br />
important he was to the people of Israel and to the State of Israel.<br />
I think people came to his funeral to pay tribute to his courage and to underline how<br />
important his work had been. And his courage was not simply the courage of a<br />
soldier, but the courage of a politician in the sense that he understood that, in a<br />
democracy, people need to feel the community, they need the plasma of<br />
democracy, they need the pulse of community and community opinion and one<br />
ceases to be, in a sense, a democrat if one is removed from them. So one always<br />
had the sense of the accessibility that he gave to the people of Israel and,<br />
of course, the attendant risks which he took and the courage which, of course, he<br />
showed. The security of Israel and the survival of Israel was, of course, the one thing running<br />
through his whole life. But that he had the flexibility to see that that aim could be<br />
achieved by other than the policy he had formerly adopted was the mark, perhaps,<br />
of his greatest strength.<br />
That he understood that while Israel could be defended in a military way, it couldn't<br />
be defended permanently in a military way and that to make it secure, one had to<br />
gamner the support of the surrounding nations and peoples, and to do it on the basis<br />
of friendship and to do it with magnanimity. And, I think, having dedicated his life to<br />
its security and its survival, he saw peace as the way in which that aim would be<br />
secured and the magnanimity of the peace process was important to securing the<br />
peace. </p>
<p>And I was very moved by similar thoughts that Shimon Peres had to say when<br />
I visited him, saying that he would dedicate himself to this process, that he would<br />
put his Government on it and that it was more important than the Government itself.<br />
And that, were they not to succeed in this, then the security of Israel which Yitzhak<br />
Rabin and he, Shimon Peres, had dreamed of may allude them.<br />
And one had the impression, just in a short visit to Jerusalem seeing the young<br />
people particularly the young people with the peace signs all over the city was<br />
very moving indeed. And I thought that that sense that the community had to<br />
embrace peace not just at the political level, but right down through the society, was<br />
very much in evidence during the period I was there.<br />
I was also struck by the informality of the funeral. A funeral without pageantry. One<br />
which was, again, accessible and wasn't distant from the people and in my view it<br />
underlined, again, the democratic tenor of Israel and the sense of democracy of the<br />
place that the funeral was as it was without pomp, without an overbearing<br />
ceremony and accessible to all the people. And, I think, that the shock and the loss<br />
was borne, in a sense, by the dignity which has come to Israel's democracy and<br />
those who are participating in it.<br />
SO, I think, we one month later think about this very great man and we know what<br />
he has done for Israel and we know what he was doing with a very intricate and<br />
precise process of peace. In, first of all, building the confidence within his former<br />
opponents, building the confidence so they could be confident enough to move from<br />
the political to the constitutional to the administrative to be able to actually operate<br />
an authority, to be able to operate a system of civil government and to invest that<br />
importance in them and, in so doing, lift them up so that the peace process could<br />
actually be accomplished.<br />
This takes a great understanding of human nature, a great understanding of one's<br />
opponent. But a very great understanding of one's objectives and I think<br />
Yitzhak Rabin, obviously, had these things.<br />
I can only wish Shimon Peres well in this, as we all do. And in watching him pursue<br />
the peace process, with I think a renewed vigour from the people of Israel, and in<br />
the securing of it, we will do more than anything we can say tonight, or elsewhere,<br />
to remember Yitzhak Rabin and to pay tribute to his life and to his work and to his<br />
strength and, in that way, to see his dream come true.<br />
I appreciated very much the invitation to the funeral. I appreciated the fact I could<br />
even be there. But his life mattered too much not to be there. That is why I went<br />
and that is why I am here tonight.<br />
