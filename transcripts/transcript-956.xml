PRESENTATION TO THE PRI12 MINISTER,<br />
SIR ROBERT M~ ENZIES, BY THE INSTITUTE<br />
OF BUILDERS AT THE GROCERS' HALL,<br />
LONDON JULY,_ 1964<br />
Speech by the Prime Minister, the Rt. Hon. Sir Robert Menzies.<br />
I was told by my staff that there would be no<br />
speeches. So far the prophecy seems to be wrong. But I am bound<br />
to tell you that if I once got going and developed some of those<br />
themes of yours, you would all be here a long, long time.<br />
I want you to realise what a versatile fellow I am.<br />
( Laughter) I am a gynaecologist and obstetrician, as you said.-<br />
I am a surgeon, I am a physician, I am an arc-hitect I couldn't<br />
be relied on to design a hen coop ( Laughter); I am a plumber,<br />
a builder. The gynaecologists, like you, were good enough to<br />
give me a -tie, here in London quite splendid and the last<br />
time I wore it, I was going out to Government House with a couple<br />
of new Ministers to be sworn in, and the Governor-General said to<br />
me, " That's a rather decorative tie. What's that?" I said,<br />
" That's theGynaecologists' and Obstetricians"'. , He said, " It's<br />
a very odd tie to wear". I said, " Not at all I ye just been<br />
giving birth to two new Ministers". ( Laughter ( Applause)<br />
But you know, Sir, I am grateful for this. I have<br />
always admired builders and, at the same time, envied them. My<br />
line of country, as you have courteously pointed out, has been<br />
heavily involved with politics. Dear me, when I look at my<br />
respectable days at the Bar and I now realise that I have been a<br />
Member of Parliament, one way or another, for about thirty-five<br />
years and a -rmMei nister for sixteen or seventeen of them, I<br />
realise that my lines have been cast inevitably in that field.<br />
And, of course. you know, poli'iicians are neve-r given credit for<br />
building anything. Indeed, there is no evidenc--. risible that<br />
they7 have. Everybody knows if the country is gc-Lhg well, that<br />
it was his fault and not the fault of the politician. Everybody<br />
knows if the country is going badly that the politioians are lousy<br />
and that the Government ought to be changed. So we lose both ways.<br />
I suppose we do have to write a great deal on water<br />
or on sand and that's inevitable. Those of us wuith enough vanity,<br />
occasionally conso le ourselves in the still watches of the night<br />
by saying, " Ah, well, when history comes to be written you know<br />
that frightful platitude when history comes to be written, old<br />
boy, you'll get an honourable mention, ( Laughter) even if it is<br />
only in a footnote." I'm never too sure of it, all the same.<br />
The historians can't be relied on, and therefore one never knowa,<br />
but at the same time, you have your monuments all about you.<br />
I was talking this afternoon about Mannie Hornibrook,<br />
whom some of you know in Australia, a great bridge-builder. We<br />
now have a lake in Canberra I make bold to say we wouldn't have it<br />
if I hadn't been advocating it like mad for a long time, persuading<br />
the Treasury and having the item struck out in my absence and<br />
having it struck in again when I came home ( Laughter) but really,<br />
the man who has got a memorial in relation to the lake is Sir<br />
Manuel Hornibrook. He built two magnificent bridges across it, a<br />
great credit to him and a great credit to the city of Canberra.<br />
And so you will understand why I really feel this afternoon I am<br />
in company that is a little too good for me. ( Laughter) I feel a<br />
little above myself because here you are, mortals though you be,<br />
v e.* e/ 2 </p>

you occasionally produce the stuff of immortality. People like<br />
mqe, we just hope for the best.<br />
But anyhow, whether it is the best or the worse,<br />
politics is a most interesting business, frustrating, sometimes<br />
terribly amusing. I'ni. at a Prime Ministers' conference now which<br />
is very amusing because I am the only fellow who makes speeches<br />
that are speeches anid not written out, so mine are the only ones<br />
that never reach the newspapers. ( Laughter) ( Applause) We meet<br />
in private, great frankness is to be observed, you know, this is<br />
the theory of it, and if I haven't heard too clearly what somebody<br />
is saying, it's all right, I open a paper the next morning and<br />
there it is, because I know it's gone out.<br />
When I first attended a Prime Ministers' Cdonference,<br />
I wasn't a Prime Minister. I was there representing my then Prime<br />
Minister, Mr. Lyons. That waa in 1935, so I'm the senior<br />
inhabitant. At thattime, there were four of us. Ramsay<br />
MacDonald was the Prime Minister, Geurge Forbes was the Prime<br />
Minister of New Zealand, I think R. V. Bennett was there from<br />
Canada and I was representing Mr. Lyens, and I am not sure that<br />
at the same time, sitting discreetly in the corner, there wasn't<br />
Godfrey Huggins from Southern Rhodesia. We've been arguing today<br />
about Southern Rhodesia. Things have changed. Godfrey used to<br />
turn up. He wasn't invited. ( Laughter) He had no right to be<br />
there because Sou~ thern Rhodesia wasn't a member of the Commonwealth<br />
but he arrived, very sensibly and sat there and we all liked him<br />
immensely. Now there is a terrific argument going on, of course,<br />
as to whether Southern Rhodesia is to be given certain orders or<br />
not. When I look back over those thirty years, it seems a little<br />
hard to believe, doesn't it, that a country which has been sitting<br />
with us should today be the subject of dlebate, and somewhat<br />
acrimonious debate at times. Still, I think we got through that<br />
one pretty well. We w-ill resume again next week. I am now sitting<br />
there looking at the representatives of eighteen countries,<br />
including. my own, eighteen, all sorts and condi. tions, all sizes<br />
and shapes. I will just tell you one simple remin-iscence of two<br />
days ago. At the last Prime Ministers' Conference, the Prime<br />
Minister of Sierra 1Leone, Milton Margai, was present. I don't<br />
know whether any of you ever met Milton Margai, but he was a little<br />
chap and he wore a cap such as my old Scotch grandmother used to<br />
wear, you know, with Leads. ( Laughter) And he was a splencd<br />
chap, wonderful chap. He delivered himself to one representative<br />
whom I didn't care for very much, one day, in the most spirited<br />
fashion. It would have done great credit to an Australian in a<br />
bad temper. ( Laughter) I admired that very much indeed. Well,<br />
he's dead and his brother, Albert Margai, is now the Prime<br />
Minister of Sierra Leone, and he arrived. He's a huge fellow.<br />
He's about six feet five and he's large in every conceivable<br />
direction. He's a terrific fellow. And I being the oldest<br />
inhabitant and therefore entitled to a certain amount of privilege<br />
and impudence, walked across to him and shook him warmly by the<br />
hand and said, " Now tell me, are you a brother of Milton's?"<br />
He said, " Yes". I said,' " Don't think I'm being offensive, but<br />
same mother and father?" ( Laughter) He said, " O0h, yes, same<br />
mother and father" and then he gave a great hearty chuckle and<br />
said, " Mind you, Milton was the only little fellow in the family."<br />
( Laughter) 0 .0a / 3 </p>
<p>3-<br />
Ycu know, Sir, it is not what emerges from a Prime<br />
Minister's Conference, because I lay odds that, as usual, the<br />
communique at the end of it will be the greatest collection of<br />
cliches that the world has ever seen. It always has been in the<br />
past, because you see, we have a unanimity rule. ( Laughter) There<br />
are aighteen vet oSE and it is only when a proposition is so<br />
harmless, such as the accommodation was gcod, or something like<br />
that, that it gets into the oommunique ( Laughter) and then our<br />
friends of the Press write scathing articles about it. Very<br />
properly. It is a most awful, dreary collection of platitudes<br />
in the world. But the real point is not in the commuaique, but<br />
it is that round the table are all sorts of fellowB, some of whom<br />
may poop off in their own countries and make fiery speeches and<br />
breathe threatenings and slaughter. But when you are sitting<br />
around, chatting with them at intervals, or across the table,<br />
you find that they are all, basically, people you can talk with<br />
and get to understand, and this is what distinguishes the Prime<br />
Ministers' Conference, or one of the things that distingu shes<br />
it from the United Nations because in the United Nations, pecple<br />
haven't time to sit down and have little friendly conversations<br />
breaking the ice. They are all round the corner cooking up<br />
an amendment or lobbying for something. ( Laughter) Well, we<br />
don't go in for that.<br />
Therefore, long mar we survive and Sir, long may you<br />
survive. In spite of this accident that has happened to it<br />
today ( Laughter), I hope the Institute goes on and flourishes<br />
for a thousand years, aiid all I need ada is that I am most<br />
greteful to you azd to your members for the honour you've done<br />
me. </p>
