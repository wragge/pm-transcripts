On behalf of the Australian Government, we condemn in the strongest terms the bombing in Jerusalem on 23 March that killed one person and resulted in injuries to scores more.</p>
<p>The Australian Government extends its condolences to the friends and families of those killed and injured, and calls for the perpetrators to be quickly brought to justice.</p>
<p>Terrorism of this kind is a cowardly and brutal act for which there can be no justification.</p>
<p>We also express the condolences of the Australian Government for those civilians killed in Gaza in attacks by Israeli forces on 22 March.</p>
<p>The Government is deeply concerned by the recent escalation of violence in Israel and the Palestinian Territories, including rocket attacks on Southern Israel by militants in Gaza and the killing of civilians in Gaza, the West Bank and Jerusalem.</p>
<p>We call for all parties to show restraint and reject outright the use of violence, which undermines the prospects for a peaceful resolution of the conflict between Israelis and Palestinians.</p>
<p>It is the Australian Government's firm position that the conflict can only be resolved through negotiations between the parties that lead to a secure Israel living side-by-side with a secure and independent future Palestinian state.</p>
<p>The Australian Government urges parties to negotiate urgently on final status issues, and refrain from actions which undermine trust, including settlement construction and terrorist attacks. </p>
