P. M. No. 7/ 1960<br />
COMMON~ iALTH SCHO LIRSHI P AND FELLO ISHI P PLAN<br />
SCHOLA. RSHIPS BY CANADA<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister, Mr R. G. Menzies.<br />
The Prime Minister, Mr. Menzies, announced today<br />
that Canada has offered post-graduate scholarships for<br />
immediate competition by Australian students. The scholarships<br />
will cover return fares to Canada and the payment of<br />
living and other allowances.<br />
This is the second offer made to Australia under<br />
the. Comfmonwealth Scholarship and Fellowship Plan, under<br />
which governments of Commonwealth countries will provide<br />
opportunities for post-graduate study in their own countries<br />
by men and women from other parts of the Commonwealth. This<br />
plan was adopted by the Commonwealth Education Conference at<br />
Oxford last year.<br />
Mr. Menzies said that there had been strong<br />
competition from Australian graduates for the awards offered<br />
by the United Kingdom and he anticipated a similar response<br />
to the Canadian offer.<br />
He went on to say that Australia will very shortly<br />
offer similar scholarships to other Commonwealth countries.<br />
These will have the effect of * ringing graduates from those<br />
countries to study in Australian universities, thus contributing<br />
further to what he regarded as a most valuable<br />
exchange of high-quality graduate students.<br />
Persons interested should make enquiries<br />
immediately from the Registrar of any Australian university<br />
or university college, or from the Commonwealth Office of<br />
Education. Successful applicants will commence their studies<br />
in Canada in October, 1960,<br />
CANBn-LUIRA<br />
February, 1960. </p>
