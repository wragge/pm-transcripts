Australia's leading clean technology companies were showcased today at an event launched by Prime Minister Julia Gillard and Innovation Minister Senator Kim Carr.</p>
<p>The Clean Technology Showcase presented work from innovative Australian companies who are already at the cutting edge of new green technologies.</p>
<p>The Gillard Government is helping Australian businesses develop clean energy technologies as part of our Plan for a Clean Energy Future.</p>
<p>Through our Clean Technology Program we are providing $1.2 billion to help our manufacturers make investments into clean energy opportunities here in Australia.</p>
<p>A new $10 billion commercially oriented Clean Energy Finance Corporation will also be established to drive innovation through commercial investments in clean energy through loans, loan guarantees and equity investments.</p>
<p>This support is in addition to our record investment of $9.4 billion into science research and innovation this financial year.</p>
<p>Putting a price on pollution will also encourage companies to innovate and invest in new technologies to use energy more efficiently.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister said that investment in clean technologies was good for businesses, good for jobs, good for our environment and our economy.</p>
<p>Innovation here at home will also open up huge opportunities on the international market were we can become leaders of technologies of the future.</p>
<p>Minister Carr said the power and potential of clean technology was demonstrated by Carbon Revolution (CFusion Pty Ltd), an exhibitor at the Showcase.</p>
<p>This Australian company is commercialising the world's first one piece carbon fibre automotive wheel, which offer huge weight savings and therefore efficiency and performance benefits to the global automotive industry.</p>
<p>Carbon Revolution is now collaborating directly with the world's largest and most sophisticated vehicle manufacturers in Europe to bring this technology to the market in large volumes.</p>
<p>This is just one example of how embracing clean technology can open up huge global opportunities. Through Clean Energy Future and the innovation agenda, the Gillard Labor Government will help many more Australian firms transform and access these opportunities. </p>
