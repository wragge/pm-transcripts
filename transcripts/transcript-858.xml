    <content><![CDATA[<p>EMBARGO NOT TO PE PUBLISHED BROADCAST OR TELECAST BEFORE<br />8 PM. ON MONDAY, NOEMEI 18.<br />BROADCAST NO, 2<br />BROADCAST BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE RT. HON. SIR<br />ROBERT MENZIES OVER ABC NATIONAL STATIONS AT 8 PM.<br />ON MONDA, NOVEMBER 18, 1963<br />In an earlier broadcast, I disposed of the campaign<br />being conducted by my opponent, in a mixture of shouting and<br />whispering, about my alleged imminent retirement from office<br />after the election.<br />But Mr. Calwell's tactics do not end there,<br />Clearly in a straight-out conflict of policies, having<br />in mind the record growth of Australia in the last ton years,<br />and having in mind also the vital importance of a clear and<br />unequivocal Australian foreign policy and Australian relations<br />with our allies, Mr. Calwoll has no groat faith in victory.<br />That is why he is busy raising these side-issues on which he<br />* thinks he can secure votes either by fomenting animosities or<br />by creating fears in the public mind.<br />The one I want to mention briefly on this occasion is<br />his statement that if my Government is re-elected, it will impose<br />another far-reaching " credit squeeze", presumably out of a<br />spirit of sheer hardheartedness. I don't like this because, as<br />all my colleagues know, I am not a hardhearted person. Now,<br />if Mr. Calwell knows anything about public finance, he must<br />know that severe economic restrictive measures can be needed or<br />produced only in order to chock or defeat an inflationary boom.<br />He knows, or should know that a prosperous economy in which the<br />extravagances of speculation have been checked, as they<br />undoubtedly have been in the last two years, an economy in which<br />effort is concentraded upon production and supply and in pushing<br />forward works and national development, both public and private,<br />is not an economy which invites extreme measures at all.<br />We have had the benefit of a great deal of experience<br />in these matters in recent times. For myself and for the<br />Government, I see no reason why continued economic growth should<br />S not continue to be associated with stability of costs and prices.<br />' we will do all in our power to avoid a cost-price spiral because<br />we know that inflation, the fall in the value of money, hits<br />ordinary citizens far more than it hits a well-to-do minority.<br />But did you hear or read Mr. Calwellis Policy Speech? I hope<br />you did. It contained the longest and most extravagant and<br />expensive series of bids for your votes that have marked any<br />election in my time. Really, it treated you as if you had your<br />vote for sale! In his eagerness to achieve office ( because I<br />suppose that for him this may well be the last chance), he<br />proposed to add to the supply of money in this country on such<br />an astronomical scale that he has left hirself, in the event of<br />victory, with the choice of two evils. One is to have an<br />inflationary boom so violent that even a Labour Government would<br />be compelled to take the most stringent measures to counteract<br />it, or alternatively, such an enormous increase in taxation,<br />including no doubt new forms of taxation, as would be well<br />calculated to destroy business confidence and lead to an acute<br />depression. Mr. Calwell tries to make your flesh creep with imaginary<br />fears of which we would do. I would strongly advise you to get<br />out of this realm of fiction and do some hard thinking about the<br />price that you would have to pay one way or the other for the<br />policy on which he csks you to elect him.<br />I</p>
