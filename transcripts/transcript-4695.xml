Ã¸ 23 April 1978<br />
Prime Minister, Electoral Redistribution of Queensland<br />
We refer to your request for an interim report<br />
herein. We have considered the material which appears<br />
in Hansard and certain further matter sent to us by the<br />
Honourable the Minister for Finance.<br />
We have written to and received a letter from<br />
the Member for Fadden who has neither yet made available<br />
to us the Statutory Declaration incorporated into Hansard<br />
nor any further declarations.<br />
We have also been recently informed of the<br />
existence of further evidence which bears upon our previous<br />
report to you. It is our view that further investigation is<br />
required. The investigation would need to establish the<br />
correctness of conflicting allegations and is therefore<br />
of a nature we are unable to undertake. Whilst it is our<br />
view that the form any investigation should assume is a<br />
matter for the Government to determine, we consider that a<br />
judicial inquiry would be preferable. Yours sincerely,<br />
Attorney-General<br />
Solicitor-General<br />

The Rt Hon J. M. Fraser CH MP<br />
Prime Minister<br />

CANBERRA ACT 2600<br />
My dear Prime Minister<br />
I refer to the accusations that have been made against me<br />
by the Member for Fadden in respect. of the 1977 Electoral<br />
Redistribution in Queensland.<br />
The personal explanation by the Member for Fadden on<br />
7 -April and my statement to the House on 10 April 1978<br />
have canvassed the issues which broadly are:<br />
generally, that I allegedly, directly or indirectly<br />
sought to influence the decisions of the Electoral<br />
Commissioners in the proper discharge of -their duties<br />
under the Electoral Act; and<br />
specifically, that I allegedly so acted to my own<br />
advantage and to the detriment of others including<br />
the Member for Fadden.<br />
I know now that statements to this effect by Mr Cameron at<br />
the Declaration of the Poll for the Seat of Fadden were made<br />
by innuendoes against me and that following certain other<br />
events my knowledge was affirmed in discussions hel. in<br />
your Office in January 1978 and referred to in Mr Cameron's<br />
speech to the House on 7 April 1978.<br />
I gave to you on that occasion in January 1978 and<br />
subsequently by my press statement of 7 April and to the<br />
Parliament by my statement of 10 April 1978 my personal<br />
assurance which I now reiterate that I deny without<br />
equivocation the general and specific import of these<br />
allegations. It is not necessary for me to repeat the specific terms of<br />
those denials. I should only. mention that when they were<br />
made I was conscious of the fact that at all times I was and<br />
remain an elected Member of the House-of Representatives and<br />
a Minister of State in the position of the utmost good faith. </p>
<p>2<br />
A stain has been set upon my integrity. I continue to be<br />
incredulous that, having given the assurances mentioned<br />
above, I should be seen to be in the position where I must<br />
justify or prove my innocence.<br />
I am anxious that these allegations concerning me an d<br />
involving others should be disposed of as soon as possible.<br />
Since the Attorney-General and the Solicitor-General have<br />
indicated that they cannot resolve this matter and advised<br />
that further investigation is required, I repeat to you the<br />
assurance that I initiated and gave the Acting* Prime Minister<br />
in Sydney on 21 April 1978 that I willingly agree to any<br />
enquiry which may be found to be desirable in order to dispose<br />
of the matter speedily.<br />
I am, and have been conscious of the standards of propi~ iety<br />
and good faith required of me as a Minister of the<br />
Commonwealth. Being secure in the knowledge that these-allegations are.<br />
without foundation, I do not see the mere-raising of the<br />
allegations in any way renders me less fitted to undertake<br />
the duties of my office.<br />
if however it is de-termined that a formal enquiry be embarked<br />
upon and if it is your wish, I will seek Ministerial leave<br />
during the period of any such enquiry.<br />
Yours sincerely<br />
Eric L. Robinson </p>
