P. M. No. 14/ 1961<br />
AUSTRALIAN EXCHIBITION FOR TATE GALLERY, LONDON<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister, the Rt. Hon, R. G. Menzies.<br />
The Prime Minister, Mr. Menzies, said today that while he<br />
was in London for the Prime Ministers' Conference he had taken<br />
the opportunity to discuss with the Chairman of Trustees of<br />
the Tate Gallery, Sir Colin Anderson, and the Director, Sir<br />
John Rothenstein, arrangements for an exhibition of Australian<br />
art to be held in the Tate Gallery in the i glish winter of<br />
1962. The Prime Minister said the exhibition would comprise<br />
about 200 paintings and that the Commonwealth Art Advisory<br />
Board had already given considerable thought to its<br />
composition. There would be a small section of Australian<br />
historical paintings and a few paintings of the impressionist<br />
period but the main emphasis would be on contemporary Australian<br />
paintings. It was also hoped to include paintings by young<br />
Australian artists whose work is comparatively unknown outside<br />
Australia. The Prima Minister also said that never before had an<br />
Australian exhibition of the scope of the one proposed been<br />
shown in London and he was grateful to the Tate Gallery<br />
authorities for this opportunity of bringing to the British<br />
public an outline of Australian artistic achievement.<br />
The Prime Minister added that the exhibition would most<br />
likely be shown at centres outside London aftor-the Tate<br />
showing. CANBERRA,<br />
14th April 1961. </p>
