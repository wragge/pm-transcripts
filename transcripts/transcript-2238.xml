FEDERAL COUNCIL MEETING OF THE<br />
LIBERAL PARTY OF AUSTRALIA<br />
Canberra, A. C. T. 8 JUNE 1970<br />
Ãµ peech! th_ ePrime Minister, Mr. 14ohngorton<br />
Mr. President, Parliamentary Colleagues and Ladies and Gentlemen:<br />
It will be twenty-one years next December since the<br />
Liberal Country Party coalition assumed the Governme.. of this nation.<br />
They are twenty-one years in which there have been three wars Korea,<br />
the Malayan emergency and now Vietnam; twenty-one years of great<br />
national development and industrial progress. There has been an<br />
increase in the population perhaps greater than any other country has<br />
had, except Asian countries, in that period of time. It has been<br />
a periodd gready a~ pnded trade; a period in which our exports have<br />
been immensely developed; a period of growing involvement with<br />
that area of Asia to which we find ourselves contiguous; a period of<br />
improvement of the living standards generally for our population; a<br />
period of greatly expanded social services; a period a2 greatly<br />
expanded opportunity for the individual.<br />
We have helped to bring this about, because at the time when we<br />
came into office, wa stood for the right of the individual to engage in the<br />
occupation of his choice and to so conduct himself in that occupation as<br />
he believed best. We stood ainstthe concept that the individual<br />
ought to be told by the State that his enterprise could riot be f reely<br />
used in a field of his own choosing because there were ce-rtain areas<br />
in which the state might forbid it.<br />
We stood for the concept that the Government should create<br />
a climate where individual enterprise was encouraged, and where<br />
the planning of enterprise and its expansion was a matter for the<br />
myriad individuals engaged in it. We stood against the concept that<br />
all planning in all fields should be undertaken by a government or<br />
governments and forced upon the citizens of this country.<br />
We stood for a political system where elected representatives<br />
of a party should themselves decide the policies to be followed by that<br />
party. We stood &amp; Insjt a system which made elected representatives<br />
subject to direction and instruction from unelected persons from<br />
outside. And that we were right in all these attitudes ic, I believe,<br />
evident from the results of this past twenty, nearly twenty-one years. / 2 </p>
<p>Since I spoke to you-: ast, s~ e _ j<br />
two years ago, other significant advances havedeen made in many<br />
areas in Australia, and new initiatives have been taken.<br />
We have found ourselves in a situation where our own<br />
defeuce has necessarily had to occupy our attention in a way which<br />
it has never needed to do in the past years of our history. We have found<br />
ourselves in a situation where our involvement with the countries -of Asia, our<br />
political involvement, our economic assistance has necessarily hald to<br />
grow because we have become contiguous to, and in a sense, a part of<br />
this region of the world, this region of Asia in which we live.<br />
I do not need, I think, to explain to you the new initiatives<br />
which my colleague, the Minister for Defence has undertaken in the field<br />
of defence, the new burdens imposed upon this country, n or the new<br />
economic assistance which my colleague, the Minister for External<br />
Affairs has beea instrumental in extending to the countries to our North,<br />
nor the political initiatives which led, just recently, to that Conference<br />
in Djakarta initiated by an Asian nation to which we were asked and to<br />
which we so greatly contributed.<br />
In other areas, we have gone into an overseas shipping<br />
service let me quickly add, Sir in, partnership with private<br />
enterprise. We have given attention to the requirements of the aborigines<br />
in our midst. We have managed, after some attempts which did not<br />
succeed, to redistribute electoral boundaries. We have given attention<br />
to new roads agreements, adding $ 500 million over five years and<br />
breaking the old requirement that 40 per cent of this must be spent in<br />
country areas. We have taken the decision to convert to the metric<br />
system. We have taken the decision to introduce nuclear power. We<br />
have taken many initiatives, one of which I will speak of later, to provide<br />
incentives for, and to help to maximise Australian ownership of<br />
Australian industry. We have greatly increased aid for the performing<br />
arts, established an Australian film and television development<br />
corporation. We have introduced a tapered means test which gives<br />
incentive to people to save and to earn because their pensions are<br />
not automatically cut out if their means as assessed or their earnings<br />
are above a small amount, and in this particular field of social<br />
welfare, increased pension rates, increased unemployment and sickness<br />
benefits, given full health insurance for low-income families and newlyarrived<br />
migrants, are in process of introducing the new health scheme<br />
and embarked on a omprehensive -programme of. homne care for the aged.<br />
Sir, these are only sonio of ihe new things, some of the<br />
new initiatives which have been taken in-. that period of time, and I<br />
believe that they continue the tradition of this Party to care for people<br />
and to bring new thought to new problems as they arise. </p>
<p>-3-<br />
Sir, we had in -the progranmme which we have followed,<br />
three proposals in particular which have occasioned much debate in<br />
the country and in the Parliament. One is the health scheme promised<br />
at the last election which I very much hope will become law this week;<br />
one is the Act to set up the Industry Development Corporation which has<br />
already become law, and one is the proposal to discover which Government<br />
has the legal responsibility for the seas which lap Australia's coast.<br />
Each of these matters is important. Each of them, I think, is<br />
illustrative of an approach of the Libemal Party, and about each of them<br />
I wish to talk to you briefly.<br />
The medical benefits scheme, or the health scheme, is<br />
designed, as you know, to remove the fear of heavy doctors' bills<br />
from the insured patient. In order to do this it was necessary to<br />
remove that fear from those patients who had to attend special ists<br />
and who therefore became liable for the higher fees which specialists<br />
charge. And in order to achieve that it was necessary that Government<br />
subventions and fund benefits should be greater for such patients than<br />
they were for patients who did not need or receive specialist treatment.<br />
This led to considerable opposition from a section of the<br />
doctors and this opposition was reflected in debates in the Party room<br />
and in the Parliament. It also led to protracted negotiations and<br />
discussions between my colleague, the Minister for Health, the<br />
Australian Medical Association, and organisa tions representing sections<br />
of thc. general practitioners.<br />
The main arguments advanced agains t the proposals<br />
were if specialists received higher bcnefits frorm the funds and the<br />
Government, evc.,-y doctor would seek to become a specialist and<br />
there would be no general : izactitioners. But since specialists now<br />
charge and receive higher fees from their patients, it is, I think,<br />
doubtful if this argument is valid.<br />
The second argument<br />
consult specialists without having to<br />
everyone would consult a specialist.<br />
not believe that this will happen, but<br />
scheme will finally decide this point,<br />
out to be well grounded, then further<br />
to it. was that if patients were able to<br />
pay a monetary penalty, then<br />
For a variety of reasons we do<br />
only time and the operation of the<br />
and if the fears expressed turn<br />
attention will have to be given<br />
But now, or shortly, all those who need medical<br />
attention, even of the most specialised kind, will be able to get it<br />
without incurring a burden of crippling debt. I think this is an advance<br />
which illustrates that care for the individual which is the Liberal<br />
approach and of which the organisation and the Party can be proud. </p>
<p>-4-<br />
but I must warn you of one thing.<br />
Neither our scheme, nor the scheme of our opponents,<br />
will achieve its desired end unless the majority of doctors charge the<br />
co~ mmon fee and unless that common fee is only altered at reasonably<br />
spaced periods and by reasonable amounts.<br />
Turning now to the Austral ian Industry Development<br />
Corporation, I speak of an Act which was attacked, for reasons<br />
incomprehensible to me, as an Act which somehow violated . Liberal<br />
principles. Let me give you some of the reasons for passing this<br />
Act. Ouir nation is going throtgh a period of industrial<br />
expansion and of great mineral development. We need large and<br />
continuing infusions of capital from overseas in order to sustain this.<br />
In the last five years, one-sixth of all such investment capital came<br />
from oversea-s. And inevitably that infusion of capital tends to bi ing<br />
with it a greater degree of overseas ownership and control of our<br />
la rger industries and our mineral developments and ultimately cf<br />
our processing of our minerals.<br />
As one example of this, overseas investment in mining<br />
five years ago was $ 34 million in the year. It has risen to something<br />
like $ 250 million in the year, while Australian control production<br />
in minerals alone has dropped from 63 per cent in 1963 to 47 per cent<br />
in 1967. At the same time, Australian requirement to service<br />
existing capital by remitting abroad, has risen from 8. 3 per cent<br />
to 10. 5 per cent of our export earnings in the last five years. And<br />
there is a build-up ot commitment s for further remittances in the<br />
future because income earned in Australfia by overseas investors<br />
and ploughed back has more than doubled in five years.<br />
Sir, these are prices we can afford to pay for<br />
development. We can afford to pay, for 4w benefits ' we<br />
get outweigh the costs of which I have spoken, and we couldn'.. develop<br />
as we should without this influx. But though they are prices we can<br />
afford to pay, they are not prices we should pay unless we must.<br />
So we should provide the opportunity to retain as much Australian<br />
ownership and as much Australian control as we can, provided we<br />
do not inhibit growth. To that end, we have brought down guidelire s for<br />
borrowing inside Australia which provide incentives towards<br />
Australian ownership. We have brought down a'takeover code"<br />
and we are proposing to bring down the matter of convertible notes<br />
which again -will provide an opportunity and incentive for Australian </p>
<p>5.7<br />
ownership. And the Australian Industry ievelopment Corporation is<br />
designed to further these ends.<br />
It is designed to borrow abroad, on behalf of Australian<br />
companies which ask it to do so, which it judges to be viable, and which<br />
might not themselves be able to borrow, and which might '-ereforo<br />
have to surrender equity to an overseas partner.<br />
Its objectives cannot be claimed to be opposed to Liberal<br />
principles, and indeed, I do not think I have heard its objectives so<br />
claimed. Nor, do I believe, can its method of operation. True, it is<br />
provided with capital by the Government, but it will be autonomous.<br />
It ' will be governed by directors drawn from the field of private<br />
enterprise and applying the judgments and standards of private<br />
enterprise to applications to borrow. It will have no power to<br />
interfere with a company or to act financially on behalf of a company,<br />
unless it is by that company asked to act. It will be subject to the<br />
same taxes as other companies engaged in its field. It will compete<br />
on equal terms, and it cannot do any more than compete.<br />
It will indeed offer a choice to a borrower, and the<br />
preservation and expansion of the right of choice has always been a<br />
basic tenet of Liberalism, ever since 1949 when Sir Robert Menzies<br />
pointed out the need to retain the right of choice.<br />
Sir, if this is a departure from Liberal principlae,<br />
a foray into socialism, then I suppose on that test, so is TAA, or<br />
the Commonwealth Trading Bank or the State Savings Banks or the<br />
Australian National Shipping Line, or a myriad other enterprises.<br />
I think that this action will, in the future, be hailed as a service to<br />
Australia. I believe it will help to retain the greatest possible<br />
Australian ownership of growing Australian enterprises without<br />
interfering with that inflow from abroad that we need. Indeed, I think<br />
it will be an adjunct to the growth of Australian private enterprise,<br />
of Australian private enterprise industry and to help it grow as<br />
Australian industry. Surely, Sir, these aims are proper ones for a Liberal<br />
Party. In turning to the proposal, somewhat loosely described<br />
as offshore minerals legislation, we turn to one which has, I think,<br />
been greatly misunderstood. It has been referred to as an attempt<br />
to take the benefits of mineral deposits on the seabed away from the States.<br />
It isn't. It has been described as an attempt to take away States' legal </p>
<p>-6<br />
rights. It isn't. It is purely and simply an attempt to discover,<br />
by the only means known to me, who is legally responsible for the<br />
cortrol of the seas around Australia, who has legal rights which are<br />
at present in unresolved dispute.<br />
We want, and we believe, that the nation needs a<br />
clear legal definition of this matter which we do not now have. Both<br />
the State Governments and the Commonwealth Government claim this<br />
legal responsibility and both claim it from low water mark to the outer<br />
Continental shelf. The legal claim of the States is not confined to the<br />
area between low water mark and the three-mile limit any more than<br />
the cl aim of the Commonwealth is confined to the area from the threemile<br />
limit to the Continental shelf.<br />
We are the only nation which does not know what the<br />
legal position is and where sovereignty lies, and it can surely not be<br />
claimed to be an act of centralism to seek to discover this. In<br />
Canada, the issue was resolved by stating a hypothetical case to the<br />
High Court or the equivalent of the High Court. It is not possible<br />
to do this here. Here, all that can be done is for an Act asserting<br />
legal responsibility to be passed and for that Act to be challenged in<br />
that High Court which was set up by the Constitution for the purpose<br />
of interpreting the Constitution in cases which are not clear. Nor<br />
will this clarification, when it comes, prevent full Commonwealth,<br />
State co-operation. The petroleum agreement, which specifically does<br />
not resolve the q uestion of legal responsibility, will continue. And<br />
agreements patterned on the same lines can be entered into concerning<br />
all other minerals, and we are prepared to enter into themn.<br />
But as a nation we will know where we stand. We<br />
will know whether the nation's writ runs inside and outside the threemile<br />
limit, whether it runs in part of the area but not the whole, or<br />
indeed whether it runs in any of the areas. And it is hard to see why<br />
this question should remain any longer in doubt, hard to see why this<br />
question should remain in doubt any more than questions relating to<br />
defence or overseas trade or the other sections of our Constitution<br />
where primary responsibility is not in doubt.<br />
It is hard for me to see why there should be<br />
objections to Constitutional methods of clarifying the Constitution, and<br />
it is certain that after clarification, Commonwealth and State co-operation<br />
in the granting of leases for minerals, and Commonwealth, State<br />
agreement s for royalties and fees in administration can be patterned 7 </p>
<p>-7<br />
on that petrolewnm agreement which it is so oftmauggested should be<br />
followed. Those, Sir, were three of the new initiatives, the<br />
new actions taken which, because they have occasioned country-wide<br />
debate, I thought I should speak of to this Conference.<br />
I turn now to another question of debate, of relations<br />
between the Commonwealth and the States.<br />
As far as financial relations are concerned, Sir,<br />
you will know that the previous agreement is shortly to run out and a<br />
new financial agreement requires to be negotiated. At the moment,<br />
discussions are continuing between Com,-monwealth Treasury officials<br />
and State Treasury officials on this matter.<br />
At the Premiers' Conference, it was made clear, I<br />
think by me that there would bejia new agreements to be worked out<br />
between us, more available for State Governments than would have been<br />
the case bad the old agreement continued with its set down yearly<br />
increases. And we were able to meet one of the specific requirements<br />
of the Steering Committee, which was that the area of State debt should<br />
be reduced and gradually taken over by t. he Commonwealth, and the<br />
charges on it revoked, and that there should be, each year in the<br />
future, a sum of money which previously would have been provided<br />
as Loan money on which interest wac charged but which, for the future<br />
would be provided as a share of revenue for the States to spend as<br />
revenue rather than as Loan funds.<br />
For the rest, the matters of betterment factor and<br />
things of that kind, this is still the subject of negotiation between us.<br />
Last time I spoke to you on this general matter, I<br />
said this: ,' In my view, Sir, it would be unthinkable for an<br />
Australian Government not to have the overriding power<br />
over the maintenance of the Australian economy as a whole".<br />
And this, I am glad to see, has been endorsed by the report of the<br />
Steering Committee. I also said<br />
" If there is a requirement for cheap power in, for<br />
example, Gladstone in Queensland, in order to be able to<br />
bring about industrial development which vtill benefit the<br />
nation; if there is a need for a pipeline or some other work<br />
in South Australia to carry natural gas, which in turn will<br />
benefit the nation, and if these things cannot be achieved without </p>
<p>-8<br />
' hssistance from a national governmnent, then a<br />
national government needs the right and capacity<br />
to assist in these things.<br />
I imagine there would be few here who Wo uld dispute that approach,<br />
and particularly in view of the Steering Committee's recommendation<br />
that provision for the needs and problems of the less populous States<br />
be maintained. Last time I spoke to you, I suggested that there was<br />
a need to see that the facilities for the education of a child were<br />
roughly comparable no matter in what part of. Australia that child<br />
was educated. And I suggested there wEas a need to ensure that<br />
facilities for the care of the ill in Australia were roughly the same,<br />
no matter in what part of Australia that citizen becaine ill.<br />
I said then I did not think it right or proper to<br />
describe such suggestions as those of a centralist. And I repeat<br />
that I do not think they indicate a centralist way of thinking. But there<br />
are always those who seek to over-simpl ify everything and to apply<br />
labels. There are always those who seek not to have the kind of<br />
discussions I called on us all to have and which we have had with<br />
benefit, but rather to make prejudgment and to use these labels.<br />
In his address today, the President referred to<br />
the word " centralism" and " centrali&amp; e. I am not entirely sure what<br />
these words mean for they are rarely defined by those who use them.<br />
But if they mean a system or person who wants all power, all policymaking,<br />
all administrative decisions concentrated in one place, then<br />
there are none of us here who could possibly be described as centralist.<br />
And I believe that all of us here could properly be described as<br />
opponents of centralism, if that is what it means.<br />
Similarly, if a federalist is one who believes that<br />
a national government should have no responsibility and no voice in<br />
such matters of nation-wide importance as education or health or<br />
national development or agriculture or in any other fields, that there<br />
is no room there for co-operation between a national government and<br />
a state government, then I do not think that such a person is a true<br />
federalist or serves the nation well.<br />
Indeed, Sir, these words, these labels, unless they<br />
are defined in depth, have no real meaning, but the danger is that<br />
they are labels which can be used as a substitute for thinking. A<br />
proposal may be advaoced or a practice may develop which is new<br />
or different and I speak not only of proposals advanced for po-wers<br />
to come to Canberra or practices which develop, I speak of the<br />
living thing of federalism where, in either direction, proposals can / 9 </p>
<p>9-<br />
be advanced. And in such a case, always if such a thing happens,<br />
there should be analysis and examination in depth to see whether what<br />
is proposed is advantageous to the nation as a whole, to each of the<br />
citizens who make up the nation, just as they make up the various<br />
States, and whether it is adva~ ntageous to a State or States or to the<br />
citizens who make up the State or States.<br />
There should in such circumstances always, in an<br />
ad hoc matter, be debate of a friendly and constructive kind, not<br />
debate designed as an advocacy of previously-determined positions,<br />
but debate designed to discover argument and to discover where<br />
the true balance of advantage lies, whether the goals sought are<br />
proper goals and whether they might perhaps be better attained in<br />
some other way; to discover whether the proposal fits properly inlto<br />
the co-operative federalism which we seek to retain. Too often,<br />
this exercise in thinking can be avoided and sometimes is by the<br />
initial use of a label and the condemnation of a proposal on the basis<br />
of that label. Let us always, Sir, examine these things on the<br />
basis of a close analysis, close examination, looking at the merits<br />
or demerits of any proposal and looking at the continuance we all<br />
desire of an evolving but not static Liberal federalism in Australia.<br />
I think that those who do not wish to do that perhaps will do both<br />
Australia and the Liberal Party a disservice, for we cannot remain<br />
static, and we do wish to preserve a federal system which our<br />
opponents, should they have the chance, would undoubtedly destroy<br />
completet. y as they have made more than evident over the last -year.<br />
Sir, we believe in a federal system but not a static<br />
one. Our opponents don't believe in a federal system at all, and this<br />
is a great and continuing difference between us.<br />
We were told this morning, Sir, in your speech,<br />
that we must discover what the Australian people hope far and that<br />
we should seek to govern as a government and seek to Zdvise as an<br />
organisation in such a way that we can best attain those hopes and<br />
wishes, and indeed we must.<br />
Many of these hopes and wishes must already be<br />
knownqjqeAd the wish of young people to be able to obtain adeposit for a<br />
block and to build a house on it without facing a lifetime of heavy<br />
debt, the hope for continuing improvement in education opportunity<br />
and let us not be apologetic on this, for education opportunity under<br />
the various State Governments and with some assistance from the<br />
Commonwealth has improved immensely over the last decade. But<br />
there is always room for further improvement. </p>
<p>There is the hope otbeing-able. to-retire in<br />
modest comfort and of being cared for when ill without crippling<br />
bills; the opportunity for personal development, personal development<br />
of talent and personal atisfaction in life by engaging in an occupation<br />
which gives satisfaction to the individual.<br />
Then there is the wish for reasonable stability<br />
in prices and the cost of living, the desire to cleanse the environment<br />
in which many now live, the sense of bel tonging to and contributing<br />
to a nation growing in material wealth, . In personal opportunityy , in<br />
Christian concern for the unfortunate. And, of course, the desire<br />
and the wish that all this should be done with, if possible, no taxation<br />
at all: Many of these new hopes and asplxations are good.<br />
But they have sprung from the prosperity created in the climate we<br />
have provided in the last twenty years A-which has taken the more<br />
pressing problems which used to intrude away. Well they cannot<br />
all at once be met. But the way which will meet them best is the<br />
Liberal way, the way of creating a climate where individual enterprise<br />
and the right of choice to the individual will be continued, the way<br />
where competition is fostered but laissez-faire is not allowed to run<br />
wilId, the way that has stood the test of time and which has made<br />
Australia not a perfect state for it is very far indeed from that<br />
but a country which offers its citizens be cause of their exertions, and<br />
because of the wise husbandry of the results of their exertions, a<br />
fuller life, a life of more opportunity than perhaps of any other country<br />
I know. We will go into the future as a. Party with heavier<br />
burdens for our defence than we have ever known before because of<br />
changing world situations, with greater involvement with the-nations<br />
who our neighbours, with these new problems I have sketched to you<br />
before us needing to be overcome, but with the firm and unshakeable<br />
belief that the way to overcome them is not by all-embracing state<br />
planning, is not by abolition of a federal system but by that general<br />
approach which we -have followed for over twenty years and which,<br />
projected into the future, and changing slightly to meet changing times<br />
and changing problems after debate, will best meet those problems<br />
for the good of this nation and all those citizens who live in it. </p>
