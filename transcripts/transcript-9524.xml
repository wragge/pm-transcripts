TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
INTERVIEW WITH ELIZABETH JACKSON, RADIO 2CN<br />
23 MARCH 1995<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
EJ: Prime Minister, welcome back to 2CN.<br />
PM: Good, Elizabeth. Glad to be here.<br />
EJ: Now, I recall the memorable chat that you had with one of my<br />
predecessors the last time you made an appearance on 2CN, but I<br />
don't think time permits this morning to ask you about your pj's<br />
perhaps we should go straight to the Saturday by-election. Now, John<br />
Howard yesterday morning was talking about a 5 per cent by-election<br />
swing to the Liberals are you expecting that it will be decided on<br />
Green preferences?<br />
PM: Well, I don't know. I mean, I never get too clever or prescriptive about<br />
elections or by-elections. I always give the public the right to make<br />
their own decisions about these things and to evaluate the Parties, but<br />
by-elections always do give electors a chance to send signals of some<br />
kind to the Government of the day and no doubt some opportunities<br />
will be taken here.<br />
EJ: So how important will the Green preferences, in particular, be do you<br />
think?<br />
PM: Well, I -think, this is a 50 -per -cent -plus 1 system it's a preferential<br />
system. Therefore, the preferences add up and they matter, so all<br />
preferences which flow to the Labor candidate, of course, matter.<br />
EJ: Now, internal Party polling, I understand, indicates that for the first<br />
time in 18 years, the result will go to preferences. The Party is in<br />
some trouble isn't it, if in a traditional Labor town like Canberra, it's the<br />
preferences that ultimately decide the outcome? </p>
<p>PMV: Well, look, in the middle of Parliaments, and this is the middle of a<br />
Parliament, I don't think any Government ever gets to the point where<br />
it's travelling so well it can just tick up by-elections with ease. But in<br />
the ACT, I think, we are entitled to have our candidate returned. I<br />
mean, for a start, we've got a woman replacing Ros Kelly, who was a<br />
member of the Cabinet. Sue Robinson is a Labor person who is in<br />
touch with the community, she works with the community, she talks to<br />
people, she's a representative person, she would behave like this as a<br />
Member of Parliament, and if you look at the ACT, I mean, under this<br />
Government, it's essentially not even a carbon copy of what it was in<br />
the past. I mean, it's a stronger, much more privately oriented<br />
economy than it's ever been in the past and, as you know, we have<br />
always put a premium on the employment conditions of the people in<br />
the public sector here in Canberra. And I think, perhaps, one of the<br />
strongest things to say about the Government's stewardship of the<br />
ACT is that, right at the moment, the ACT unemployment rate is 6.9<br />
per cent it's the lowest of any of the States or Territories.<br />
EJ: Prime Minister, let me ask you about Sue Robinson, seeing as you<br />
have mentioned her. She has called now for a moratorium on<br />
woodchipping. Do you support that?<br />
PM: Well, I haven't seen exactly what she said. I mean, but if she is talking<br />
about a moratorium....<br />
EJ: She wants to see an end to the exporting of woodchips.<br />
PM: I think her view and mine is basically the same. That is, we are saying<br />
that we want to phase woodchipping out.<br />
EJ: No, but she wants to stop it now.<br />
PM: Well, what one wishes to stop now, I mean, I haven't seen her words,<br />
but the policy of the Party is, and the policy of the Government is, that<br />
we should phase woodchipping out. And you know that just in the<br />
early part of the year I said we would cut by 20 per cent a year<br />
woodchip volumes, which is the biggest single policy initiative that's<br />
been made to actually reduce the volume of woodchips to virtually<br />
nothing within five years, other than to see them used in some way<br />
which adds value. I think the more important point is, and I think this is<br />
where Sue and I are at a complete agreement, that is that we think<br />
what the public wants is these important stands of trees to be<br />
protected. That is, where there is heritage and old growth values.<br />
EJ: But, Prime Minister, can I put it to you that she wants more than that.<br />
She wants to stop the export of woodchips and she wants to stop the<br />
logging of old growth and wilderness forests right now?<br />
PM: Well, if that is her aspiration... </p>
<p>EJ: Will she get it?<br />
PM: Many Australians will share her view and she is entitled to argue that...<br />
EJ: Will you give it to her though?<br />
PM: in the councils of the Party and the Caucus. But if you are asking me<br />
for an instant Cabinet decision, of course, you know I can't give you<br />
one.<br />
EJ: Prime Minister, the Greens say that this looks very much like a last<br />
minute desperate ploy for Green preferences.<br />
PM: Well, last year, before this matter became an issue, at this<br />
Government's initiative, and let me say at mine, we reserved for the<br />
nation forever Shoalwater Bay, Jervis Bay, and these are major areas<br />
of the Australian east coast. You can compare them with any areas of<br />
the US coast, or the European coast I mean these are huge areas,<br />
important areas of the coast of Australia. And in the Budget of last<br />
year, at my initiative, we put in $ 24 million to buy back the so-called<br />
" hole in the heart" of the Daintree Rainforest. Now, this didn't take any<br />
prodding from the Greens, as you call them, or anybody else. This<br />
was done by the Government. Now, we had the support of the<br />
Conservation Foundation on Shoalwater Bay, but what magnificent<br />
changes that that wonderful thing at Jervis Bay has preserved forever.<br />
The Shoalwater Bay, which has been in Defence hands for years, with<br />
all of its pristine quality is kept. And we keep one of the most<br />
important of the rainforests, certainly where it meets the sea, in the<br />
Daintree without the subdivisions Joh Bjelke-Petersen put through it<br />
ripping it apart. Now, this, I think, underlines the Government's<br />
credentials in terms of the environment. What we have been having a<br />
debate over is about the licence renewals for this year. But in the<br />
context of that debate I've also made the huge change of saying, well<br />
next year we'll be cutting the volumes by 20 per cent and then the<br />
following year after that by 20 per cent. I mean, no other Prime<br />
Minister has ever made those decisions.<br />
EJ: Mr Keating, let me ask you about your now, I guess, infamous " so<br />
what" remark. Now, a lot of people who talk to me and I think....<br />
PM: Just hang on Elizabeth, I'm just having a cup of tea and a lamington<br />
here.<br />
EJ: Alright, well, I'll ask you this while you're having a munch.<br />
PM: No, it's not lunch, it's afternoon tea.<br />
EJ: A munch. </p>
<p>PM: Morning tea.<br />
EJ: I think Bob McMullan pointed to this on my program during the week,<br />
you appeared to be very dismissive of the ACT election outcome.<br />
PM: No, no, nothing to do with the ACT but dismissive of an argument that<br />
said, in what was exclusively a set of issues in a campaign in an<br />
election fought out on local issues, that we were to then read<br />
immediately into it huge national implications. Of course I dismissed it.<br />
EJ: But, Prime Minister, it was perceived here in Canberra through letters<br />
to the Editor, through phone calls that we got, people took offence to<br />
that. They said that you were incredibly arrogant in the way you did<br />
that.<br />
PM: It's not a matter of any arrogance. It's just that nobody should try and<br />
ascribe to me or the Federal Government a whole lot of national<br />
sentiment coming out of one local election. I mean, of its essence, it's<br />
unreasonable, is it not?<br />
EJ: Well, even Bob McMullan, when he spoke to me said, " look, you know,<br />
had Paul Keating asked me for advice I probably would have told him I<br />
don't think it's a good idea to say that" I mean it's the perception that<br />
counts isn't it? And this is the perception that people have been<br />
talking about for a long time now about you. They see you as being<br />
arrogant. Do you think that's a problem? Are you arrogant?<br />
PM: But I get the mail through, don't I? I mean, I got the Native Title Bill<br />
through didn't I? I got the Land Fund Bill through didn't I? I mean,<br />
look at John Howard. He was on your program yesterday talking over<br />
the top of you, uittering away, jabbering away. What we saw from him<br />
was a complete lack of leadership and a backflip over the Land Fund<br />
Bill. We have now got his veiled threat that he will gut the Mabo Bill to<br />
make it workable, as he puts it. He has shown no leadership over the<br />
Racial Hatred legislation. There's that sordid affair with Mr McLachlan<br />
where he was party with Mr McLachlan in misleading the House of<br />
Representatives. McLachlan resigned but he wouldn't. And then the<br />
disgraceful push-polling exercise in the ACT. I mean, that's his form<br />
what's my form been?<br />
EJ: So you just don't think you are arrogant?<br />
PM: Well, don't confuse arrogance with pride in one's craft, or an urge to<br />
see about getting things done. If I sat here and passed the parcel like<br />
a lot of Liberal Prime Ministers in the past, not taken on Native Title,<br />
not taken on the Land Fund, not taken on APEC, not taken on the<br />
inflation rate, if I had said, look I won't go too hard here, I mean, I won't<br />
take risks or show any urgency here, I'll make this very laid back so </p>
<p>nobody will say of me, oh he's arrogant. I mean, he actually wants to<br />
get something done. I mean, I think it's about time people understood<br />
that pride in one's work and a sense of urgency about the nation's<br />
progress and not dropping one's bundle is not arrogance.<br />
EJ: Prime Minister, you spoke about push-polling and I would like to ask<br />
you something else about that. Now, some commentators have<br />
publicly stated their belief that by latching on to push-polling, you have<br />
effectively sacrificed Sue Robinson in return for having a go at John<br />
Howard's leadership abilities because, ultimately, inevitably, some of<br />
the mud that was thrown at her will stick.<br />
PM: I think that's a contorted piece of logic. To defend her name, and to<br />
attack what was a most vicious tactic, that is spreading to 400 or 500<br />
people at a time, severe defamations. If one doesn't rebuke that, what<br />
does one do? I reject out of hand any notion that we sacrificed Sue<br />
Robinson. I think that's your point and I don't think it's got any veracity<br />
to it.<br />
EJ: But you were very keen on turning the whole thing on to John Howard<br />
weren't you, as an attack on his leadership?<br />
PM: Well, we don't do those things. The Labor Party doesn't spread<br />
defamations of people. And when the Coalition does while he wants to<br />
parade himself around as Honest John, a decent guy and the rest, it is<br />
completely valid for me to say: this is unAustralian, it's<br />
unacceptable and you the Liberal Party shouldn't do it.<br />
EJ: But, Mr Keating, I bet some people would accuse you of playing dirty<br />
by making unsubstantiated claims about John Howard doing deals with<br />
Kerry Packer. I mean isn't that casting aspersions on his integrity?<br />
PM: But that is in the public marketplace. I make my claims right up front. I<br />
mean, I'm not about getting some pollster to claim as true, because<br />
that's what the polls said, the following statements are true, and then<br />
list a series of defamations and then put them out to private people. I<br />
mean, that's what Andrew Robb did and you notice Andrew Robb took<br />
the responsibility. Howard had him up there over at the old Liberal<br />
Party headquarters taking the rap to give Howard a clean bill of health.<br />
But, of course, we caught up with him a week later, when he was at the<br />
tactics committee, agree that Mr McLachlan should try and frame the<br />
Minister for Aboriginal Affairs for photocopying and disseminating<br />
information, which Mr Howard knew, was done by him.<br />
EJ: Prime Minister, just briefly on another matter. The Liberal Senator for<br />
South Australia, Nick Minchin, has issued a statement claiming that at<br />
least 41 Australians have served prison sentences for failing to vote in<br />
the 1993 election. Now, in his view this is offensive and undemocratic </p>
<p>and an inevitable outcome of compulsory voting. Should we be locking<br />
people up for failing to vote?<br />
PM: I know nothing about it, and while you've got me on here Elizabeth,<br />
stay on the main game. I mean, chasing madcap South Australian<br />
Coalition Senators down every rabbit hole with every claim they make,<br />
has got no interest to me.<br />
EJ: But, I mean, Prime Minister, if 41 people have served gaol terms for<br />
not voting, is that acceptable?<br />
PM: I have no idea whether that's true none.<br />
EJ: And you don't wish to comment any further presumably?<br />
PM: No, I'd have to find out about it.<br />
EJ: Alright. Can I finish up then by asking you about the Governor-<br />
General. Now, I noticed you didn't like Sir David Smith's suggestion of<br />
allowing the Parliament to elect what could be Australia's last<br />
Governor-General, but you in fact want to advise the Queen on who it<br />
should be. Who do you have in mind?<br />
PM: Well, I'm not telling you.<br />
EJJ: Go on.<br />
PM: Go on?<br />
EJ: No clues?<br />
PM: Not any. But, I do like talking about my opponents though, and I've<br />
still got a few minutes on them if you want to keep cracking.<br />
EJ: Well, Bill hasn't been in touch with you has he seeking an extension<br />
before he goes farming?<br />
PM: No, the Governor-General is entirely proper about his future and I was<br />
delighted that he was able to serve or extend his term and I was very<br />
grateful on behalf of the country that he so did.<br />
EJ: Prime Minister, just before I let you go, did you ever end up wearing<br />
those silk pyjamas you were given on the Midday Show?<br />
PM: I don't think so. I think the silk is a bit too cold on the old skin, isn't it?<br />
In the ACT, I mean, you put the silk on it, and one thing about every<br />
Canberra night, of course, you open that window and after the sun<br />
comes down and the cool breeze comes in, which I always find a<br />
delight, but I don't want a little dose of pneumonia out of it either. So, I </p>
<p>keep rugged up in the Canberra winters, I can tell you. And in the<br />
summer, well the summer is a bit different, but there we are. But you<br />
know, let me say this, I've lived now in the ACT for 12 years and one of<br />
the things of great pride to me is that the ACT, the national capital,<br />
looks like the national capital, growing like the national capital.<br />
EJ: You like the way it looks? Because you spoke of course about<br />
architecture in Germany not so long ago. Do you think we've got it<br />
right here?<br />
PM: I think the work of the old NCDC and the successful bodies in the<br />
interests of the Government and the community in the ACT has, I think,<br />
made it a good place to live and it's had a lot of growth and a lot of<br />
employment. Let me just take you back. When we are talking about a<br />
by-election coming from a seat which was part of the election of 1993,<br />
in that election, the Government was essentially re-elected to restart<br />
growth and employment. And we've had, since the peak of<br />
unemployment in the ACT, employment here has grown by 11,600. So<br />
there's 11,600 people in work, or that's just under 8 per cent<br />
employment growth in three years, which is a tremendous number. In<br />
fact, in the last seven months, we've had 5,500 jobs in the ACT.<br />
EJ: Didn't do Rosemary Follett much good though did it?<br />
PM: But it was the Federal Government that made these changes. So,<br />
when Mr Howard goes around saying we've had five minutes of<br />
sunshine, let him go and tell that to the 11,500 who have got jobs. Let<br />
him tell it to the 590,000 in the nation who have had jobs since the<br />
election, or the 36 months of growth we've had since the recession<br />
that's three years of growth with very low inflation. I mean, the one<br />
thing the people of the ACT have got to know about the Liberals<br />
they'll cut Canberra to ribbons. I mean, just yesterday, Mr Costello<br />
was talking about, you know, Canberra and Canberra-bashing and<br />
how much money is being spent, and the fact of the matter is, the<br />
Liberals would rip Canberra to pieces. They would cut the Federal<br />
appropriations to this part of the world. They would cut back in areas<br />
which would be very meaningful to the community of the ACT. So that<br />
per cent unemployment rate, you know, really corresponds with<br />
just about the best performance around the world in OECD-type<br />
countries.<br />
EJ: And, Prime Minister, Ralph Willis then, you're saying, won't make<br />
those cuts?<br />
PM: Well, no, we will not rip the public sector to pieces as these people<br />
propose to do, and particularly, show the contempt they had for the<br />
ACT in Malcolm Fraser's day. I mean, you need to be around here a<br />
while. This place was like a graveyard in the 1970s, under Malcolm<br />
Fraser. You know the only building that was going when Fraser left </p>
<p>8<br />
office was Parliament House. The only one. There were no private<br />
buildings. There were no private developments. There was no other<br />
public development. There was just Parliament House. Now, you<br />
compare that to the city we see today, and the capital we see today,<br />
that's what's at risk in putting liberal Government Liberal MPs into<br />
Parliament.<br />
EJ: Prime Minister, thanks for your time.<br />
PM: Thanks very much Elizabeth.<br />
ends.<br />
