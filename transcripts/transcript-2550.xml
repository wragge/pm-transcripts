PRIME MINISTER<br />
REGIONAL DAILIES ASSOCIATION DIVINER<br />
CANBERRA, A. C. T. IIARCH, 1972.<br />
Speech by the Prime Minister, the Rt. Hon. William McMahon CHMP.<br />
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen,<br />
I feel a little like Daniel as the guest of the<br />
regional lions. Mostly, I come face to face with the papers in<br />
the morning an hour or so before breakfast. On this occasion,<br />
it is a pleasure to meet you at the end of the day, and in pretty<br />
distinguished company. I know you have no intention of spoiling<br />
m y dinner as you sometimes spoil my breakfast.<br />
As I see it, 11r. President, the reqional dailies are<br />
to the Metropolitan press what local Government is to State<br />
Government. They are closest to the people. And like their<br />
Metropolitan brothers, they are free and independently minded, very<br />
independently minded.<br />
We in Canberra respect the regional papers for the<br />
qualities they have. But please don't misunderstand me, I don't<br />
agree with everything you print, far from it.<br />
Over the years, experience has tempered my judgemient<br />
and I am now a fatalist where newspapers are concerned. Frc'm my<br />
experience, a reply to a newspaper article resermbles the t Dnt of<br />
Hercules to crop the Hydra. There isn't t"-he slightest chance of<br />
ultimate success. But I am an optimist too, and tonight I want to<br />
talk a little about why we are going to win the next election.<br />
We have been through a difficult economic period. There<br />
are still plenty of difficulties around. But I can see daylight<br />
and so can many of the people around me. Not only in the Government,<br />
but in large sections of business and industry where the man who<br />
spots the trend early qets the advantage as the recovery gathers<br />
momentum. II<br />
believe that as we generate more<br />
confidence, Lnd we in Australia have greater reason for confidence<br />
and future prospects than most other countries I know, if we can<br />
have less industrial trouble and less wage and price movements, we<br />
can get smoothly into ton gear again. Here the press ha-r a vital,<br />
indeed critical, role. / 2 </p>
<p>You are professional newspaper people, and you have<br />
every right to say you are the best judges of what is news.<br />
What I can do is to make an appeal for a place for good news<br />
alongside the bad to make an appeal for some priority for<br />
matters of substance over trivia.<br />
Confidence has a psychological basis and you cannot<br />
beat this by Government edict and action alone. It needs to be<br />
attacked on a broad front with the intelligent understanding and<br />
support of the Press. People do believe what they read in<br />
newspapers and that is why those of you who belong to the<br />
honourable profession of journalism have a great trust to keep.<br />
You are a spur to governments and a voice for the people.<br />
It is a year since I became Prime Minister and I<br />
confess it has been a tough year, tougher than I thought it would<br />
be. We have faced up to taking unpopular measures. We have<br />
accepted our responsibility to hold firm. We have set ourselves<br />
unmistakably against the social and economic evil of excessive<br />
inflation. And now we are finding some satisfaction in seeing<br />
the right trends beginning to emerge.<br />
That is not my opinion alone. Remember what Mr<br />
Gibbs, the Managing Director of GMH said only this week about the<br />
upturn in the economy. His company is going to put on about as<br />
many men as it laid off in recent months. Two thousand are going<br />
back on the payroll. Mr Gibbs anticipates more people will be<br />
buying cars in the next few months as the stimulus measures<br />
announced at the Premiers' Conference work through. It is a<br />
hardheaded business assessment based on experience, facts and<br />
estimates. We support it.<br />
Then there are signs, too, that the rate of increase<br />
in savings bank deposits is starting to slow down. As people get<br />
more confidence, they will be spending more. These are facts,<br />
not wishful thinking. We heard nothing, I note, from the Leader of the<br />
Opposition this week about his famous prediction in January that<br />
we were going to see a further 50,000 people out of work in<br />
three months' time. Well, all I can say is that two months ha-e<br />
gone by and in the first of those months, unemployment fell by<br />
15,000. Unemployment is on the way down. And we can be sure that<br />
in this month of March there will be a further improvement.<br />
Mr Whitlam now seems to be whispering his predictions.<br />
There has been a similar deafening silence on this<br />
subject from Mr Clyde Cameron who went even further out on a<br />
limb. He forecast 200,000 out of work. I ' now it is hard to<br />
believe. It was a completely irresponsible fear-promoting<br />
exercise that got about as far as Mr Cameron's other short-lived<br />
attempt at getting the Labor Party to agree on its industrial<br />
policy. His efforts as sha-low Minister for La -ur have not<br />
exactly been crowned with success.<br />
The Labor Party is very fond of substituting wishes<br />
for predictions and speculations for certainties. We are going<br />
to see a lot more of it this year. When you do, take a moment<br />
to remember those predictions of theirs about unemployment. / 3 </p>
<p>3<br />
But let us turn from their wishful predictions to<br />
more of the facts as we know them today.<br />
The economy is healthy and growing<br />
Look at the country. What a depressing outlook it was<br />
a year ago! The bottom had fallen out of wool, it<br />
seemed, and rural unemployment was high. Now wool and<br />
other commo . r-ity prices have got better and the rural<br />
depression is lifting.<br />
tany companies are showing better results and the stock<br />
market is more buoyant, without the previous unhealthy<br />
sneculative elements.<br />
Overseas trade is healthy. Our reserves position is<br />
strong.<br />
Interest rates are down. Money is available for<br />
investment. These are ingredients for success. But the fight<br />
against inflation must go on. As we have said often, the remedy<br />
lies in wage restraint together with increased productivity.<br />
Before the year is out, we will be going to the polls.<br />
I will say I believe we will win, and win on our mcrits. We will<br />
fight and win on the vital issues of the day on the economy<br />
defence social welfare national development.<br />
I do not yet want to nominate a priority of issues.<br />
They are all very important. We will show how wide the gulf is<br />
between the Government Parties and Labor on issues like imnigration,<br />
industrial lawlessness and thE-ANZUS Treaty.<br />
Only yesterday, the Presidential envoy, Mr Marshall<br />
Green, re-emphasised the closeness of the trust which has been<br />
renewed between ourselves and the United States. Australia is<br />
a close friend with whom we share our confidences to a degree we<br />
do with no-one else, uas how Mr Green put it, on arrival in Sydney.<br />
We will also show how fundamentally cur -hilosophies<br />
differ ours the philosephy of individual rights and free<br />
enterprise theirs Labor's the dominance and supervision of<br />
the state. Who governs this country? The elected representatives?<br />
Or a small band largely nominated and dominated by the Left Wing<br />
Unions? That is another major issue.<br />
We all know industrial lawlessness took the edge off<br />
the reduction in actual unemployment last month. And it remains a<br />
constant threat to the pick-up in the economy to whieh I have just<br />
referred. / 4 </p>
<p>A<br />
I note what Mr Hawke has had to say about industrial<br />
action in an election year. He wont-hold off to help his political<br />
friends, as the Labor Executive meeting showed. He is a law unto<br />
himself in these matters. He has encouraged certain unions to go<br />
in for non-industrial strikes.<br />
We have already had enough industrial strikes for<br />
non-industrial reasons. The public is sick of them. Only the<br />
noisy minority with motives of their own support them. They<br />
climb on any lawless bandwaggon that comes along. Some of the<br />
Left-Wing unions go beyond the bounds of all reason and commonsense.<br />
There are other issues. We will show we are real<br />
federalists with true respect for the rights of the States. We<br />
will remind Australians that our commitment to the sanctity of<br />
our foreign relations is firm, and that we will not, like Labor,<br />
brush aside the arrangements we have in Asia and the Pacific.<br />
At the same time, we will show that we can progress<br />
step by step towards more normal arrangements with foreign<br />
powers having political philosophies alien to ours.<br />
These are some of tho issues to be argued this year.<br />
We will do so against a background of an impressive record of<br />
constructive legislation.<br />
We have done a lot in a year despite economic<br />
difficulties difficulties of a type which hc-V taxed the best<br />
economic managers in the Western world. The list is available.<br />
I want to mention just three examples which show conclusively<br />
I have not hesitated to grasp the nettle.<br />
First; Trade union amalgamations. We are determined<br />
to stick to our policy not to interfere, despite apparent political<br />
advantages. Second The doctors. We did not hesitate to aopoint<br />
the Arbitrator once it became clear that negotiation was not going<br />
to settle the common fee issue in New South Wales.<br />
And third The Public Service unions. I was accused<br />
of political cowardice for not acting in the postal workers disputes.<br />
For the first time since Federation, we have now introduced<br />
reasonable legislation which can, if necessary, be used in such<br />
situations. Does anyone seriously suggest that such actions taken<br />
in an election year are those of an indecisive Government?<br />
Does it also show indecision to stand un and state our belief that<br />
wage increases must be curbed to control inflation and then to<br />
back up our statements by intervervening in every mator wage<br />
hearing? What rubbish! If our critics can't come up with<br />
something better than that, we won't have to worry much about which<br />
way the votes will go.. </p>
<p>In the samne way, the Parliamecnt has recently been<br />
misu~ sed by time-waiting and q * uite childish arguments over the<br />
interpretation of one word or another. Some may say that is fair<br />
game in politics, but it reflects no credit on the Opposition or<br />
dignity on the Parliament. op~ position membe-rs ought to have<br />
more resp'ect for themselves as Parliamentarians than to operate<br />
as a " jeer squad" In the House.<br />
I also emphatically reject Labor's recent pathetic<br />
and transparent manoeuvres to show some contrived differences<br />
within the Ministry and the Party. It was ridiculous to suggest<br />
a rift between the Treasurer and myself because he gave a pa * per<br />
to the Taxpayers' Association meeting that I hadn't read first.<br />
There was no earthly reason why he should. He was not committing<br />
the Government. I don't read advance conics of every speech<br />
responsible Ministers make.<br />
In the Party room, as in the Cabinet room, I encourage<br />
the freest discussion. That's the Liberal way. We stand for the<br />
rights and freedoros of the individual. Not like the straightjacket<br />
policy fastened on the Parliamentary Labor Party by its<br />
outside Federal Conference.<br />
The Coaliti-Pn, too, is as solid as a rock. My colleague,<br />
the Daputy Prime iMinister, who is at this table tonight will, I<br />
am sure, ag~ ree with that.<br />
He will also agree that together we are going to win<br />
the election. </p>
