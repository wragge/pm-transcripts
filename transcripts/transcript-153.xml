LOAN COUNCIL<br />
The Prime Minister today sent the following<br />
telegram to the Premier of New South Iales, Mr. Heffron:<br />
" I acknowledge your telegram of 3rd February Stop<br />
I understand that at least four premiers have asked for a<br />
meeting of the Loan Council and therefore under the<br />
financial agreement one will be convened by my colleague<br />
the Chairman Stop But as to the matter of a Premiers Conference<br />
the views of the Commonwealth Government were clearly set down<br />
in my letter of 25th January and these views still stand".<br />
