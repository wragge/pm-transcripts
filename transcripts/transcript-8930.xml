MEF PROOF COPY<br />
BEV: Fint ofalI would kc to akets opportunity to say how very proud and<br />
honoured Nauru is to havc the Prime Minister of Australia, Paul Keatg<br />
visiting Nauru. TIs is tho first visit by an Australia PK~ and Governncut, and<br />
dhe people of Nauru arc really grateful for this opportunity. I am also pleased to<br />
a&amp; nounce that Australia and Nauru reached an agreement to se th de case<br />
before the 1Ci. Mr Keating and myself will be sigifts a compact of sculeinet<br />
agreement tomorrow afternoont, at about 5pM and Natmu looks forward very<br />
much to the exciting future with the cooperation and asaistcc which our<br />
people, our nadcm~ i will be receiving from the Govemmint and the people of<br />
Auwalia. Onc4 aan 1 take this oppottunty to thank most sincerely Paul<br />
Keatin&amp; and his Mitnister, Gordon Bilncy, for the cooperative spirt in wich<br />
t" i setllcmcut has bee rcwc&amp;<br />
Well, could I thank the President for Wis introductory rernwka. ThI% is, I t&amp; ink.<br />
an important " ement for the people of Nauni, and it is an inpovant<br />
actfimtnnt and agreement for the peoples of Atatrafia and Namrn. D. aume we<br />
arc doin~ g simply more thcen a settlement, which-I rnight say is being negottd<br />
principally by my oolicaguc the Minister for Deveopment Co-operatiem and<br />
Pacific Island Affairs, Gordon Bilney, and I would l~ ke to complimnent 0ordon<br />
for the achievemnrt of this settlemntz as I do Presidenrt Dowiyogo. The<br />
compct of bettlemeint essentiAly involven a setilement of $ 107 million die bulk<br />
uf it paid by the end or Augut 1994, so in die next 12 nmths.<br />
And then there is a Ovram of pa) Tmcnts which run over the next twenty years,<br />
which will bc a form of stable inicome by way of " bi settlement to the Nauru<br />
budget and economny.<br />
As well as tis, we have concluded a treaty-level commitment by NaWUr to<br />
withdraw its ICJ ows and munce fujture claims arisng out of Ausi'<br />
administration of Nauru. </p>

Alp* we have agreed a joint declaration of principles guiding future relatonA<br />
between AustraWi and Nauru. Now this is quite uique in Australian ternis, we<br />
don't havc such a declaaion of principles guiding thc rclatits with any other<br />
countries. We have an atecrent with Papau New Guinea but not a declaration<br />
of principles of treaty status, and I think this will be important to our relations in<br />
the fluture. It will be important to the people of Nsuzai so tt they hav a<br />
doctunztt to rely upon in thuir relations with Australia. Thar why I think the<br />
President hAs correctly called this a compact of setlement It is not simply a<br />
legal settlement elaimsv for damages, but as well as that an aprecnent, a treaty,<br />
abou how we reooone another in the future. So thawhen Nauugetsto<br />
the point where the revenues which it has had from phosphate miniing and the<br />
reat expie, and it has to rebas its economy thmr is something solid upon which<br />
that robasement can occur. So for thoue reasons I think we amc opening up a<br />
new phase of Australis-Naurd relations, and I am quite sare that this is a<br />
important compact in Nauru's history and certainly in its history of its rc~ atons<br />
with Australia.<br />
3: Is $ 107 million cnouOh to oomplete the rehabilitation of a third of the Wsand?<br />
PM: The tems of the aillayncit and the functions and uses of the settlement monies<br />
is a matter for Prvaident Dowiyogo and his Governmnent. It's for the<br />
Governmcnt to map out 3 1ong, term policy for the Wsand, because obviously<br />
when phosph= t ning revcnucs ceasc, apart from the income from its other<br />
invcstmnts, othcr industries like tourism for which now the Government has<br />
improved facilitics, infrastructure these sorts of industries will, be important in<br />
the 14ture. Therefote the use of settlement funds bears upon these questions.<br />
So it may not be simply a Straight reClaMalion, but other developments as well.<br />
BD: Mfay I add to that; the commission of inquiry which lookod into the<br />
rehabilitation of the worked-out photphatc, came out with a f%= ur of about $ 72<br />
million. So this S 107 million on the figurcs is quite generous.<br />
J1: So you are pleased with the agreement?<br />
BD: More Owa pleased. And 1 am very proud to have reached this settlement with<br />
1Prime Ministcr, Paul Keatin.<br />
J: What areas would a joint declaration coVer?<br />
PM: Well it covers really most of the things about we will let you have these<br />
tomorrow, but it refers to our history and it goes into such things as access for<br />
education and cooperation in such thing s, finAncial services, aviatimn, other<br />
transpoft, other service, fisheries, surveillance, health and medical cooperation,<br />
rohabilitation and envirornent Coomeation, developmient cooperation,<br />
comimunication and travel, et cetera.<br />
J: How much will the tiovW paymcufls be worth? A rTJ 1' 4U V I I. V4 V </p>
<p>PM: Well they are worth about S50 million owr twenty years. Now the Government<br />
can obviously recetve that payment intcrmincntly over the period as maintained<br />
in real terms. It is about $ 2.5 million a year over twenty years maintained in<br />
real terms, or they could of course assign it to a financial institution and take it<br />
at its net present value now, or at some point in the fature. It does give them, I<br />
think, flexibility and that is a good thing.<br />
BD: Ifl may also add to that, the very valuable point of this treaty is that after twenty<br />
years Nauru and Australia can continuc to discuss other forms of cooperation.<br />
J: Mr Keatin&amp; what contribution will you be seeking from New Zealand in terms<br />
of th; s agreement?<br />
PM: Well Nauru will be assigning its claims to the other former mcmbers of the<br />
British Phosphate Commission to Australia. So Australia will be seeking some<br />
payments from both New Zealand and Britain in reaching this agreement and<br />
settlement as the claims which would otherwise be made by Nauru will have be<br />
assigned to Australia as past of the tenrm of the settlement<br />
J: Are you able to put a ball park figure on what you miht be looking for from<br />
New Zealand?<br />
PM: No.<br />
J: Will you be approaching Mr Bolger here at the forum on that?<br />
PM: I will simply mention, I think the President tomorrow will mention, that we have<br />
reached an agreement, so Mr Dolger will have known that. And then when I<br />
see him, as I will be, I will mention that.<br />
J: Mr President how long do you think it will take to get the iland back to the<br />
state you would like it in? Do you have a timetable?<br />
BD: Well we hope to start very soon. This morning during the discussions with the<br />
Prime Minister and our officials, there were some ideas, some proposals which<br />
can be started immediately. One of the priorities is to set contract housing for<br />
our peoplc, and we have discussed about assistance from Australia in terms of<br />
town planners and experts to come up and help to establish that project. That is<br />
an urgent one for us and then we will look at the rest of the projects afterwards.<br />
There is no doubt that the island can be rehabilitated. I suppose you have been<br />
up to Topside, and you have seen some parts of the island where the pinnacle<br />
rocks have been taken out and levelled. And we also hope to set up a sports<br />
stadium up there, and a water reservoir, but in October this year we will be<br />
commissioning our desalination plant, so we will be looking at things. We hope<br />
to commence very soon.<br />
J; How long do you think the whole thing will take?<br />
DB: It won't bc done overnight. It will take a generation, ten, twenty years, and we<br />
will aee from there.<br />
