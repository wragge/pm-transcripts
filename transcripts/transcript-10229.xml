Fax from PRIME MINISTER<br />
BLIND TRUSTS AND MANAGEMENT AGREEMENTS<br />
In October last year I commissioned a report on the possible use of Blind<br />
Trusts by Commonwealth office-holders, including Ministers and<br />
Parliamentary Secretaries.<br />
The report, prepared by the secretaries of the Department of Prime<br />
Minister and Cabinet the Attorney-General's Department and the<br />
Treasury,-concludes that Blind Trusts and management agreements do not<br />
provide a complete solution to problems of conflict of interests for officeholders.<br />
They could, however,-be worthy of greater examination to see if<br />
they are appropriate additions to the range of available measures.<br />
The Government is still considering the report.<br />
At the time of commissioning the report I undertook to consult widely<br />
before deciding whether any changes to the current arrangements are<br />
necessary. I am therefore providing copies of the report to the Leaders of the<br />
Opposition and the Australian Democrats and seeking their comments.<br />
The report is also available on request from my office and on the Internet<br />
( hup:// www. nla. gov. au/ pm c/ blinct'index . html). I would welcome<br />
submissions or comments from individuals or organisations.<br />
