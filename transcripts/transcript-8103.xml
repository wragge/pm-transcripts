SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
HANDOVER OF CONSTITUTION ACT<br />
CANBERRA 23 AUGUST 1990<br />
Sir Geoffrey and Lady Howe,<br />
Excellencies, Parliamentary Colleagues,<br />
Distinguished Guests,<br />
Ladies and Gentlemen<br />
I am delighted today to take formal possession, on behalf of<br />
the Government and people of Australia, of this original copy<br />
of the Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act 1900.<br />
This Act of the British Parliament gave birth to the Australian<br />
Constitution and, with it, to the Australian nation. By the<br />
terms enacted in this document, Australians were legally bound<br />
together as one people.<br />
Until now this document has been part of the public records of<br />
the United Kingdom one of only two vellum originals of the<br />
Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act 1900.<br />
It is entirely understandable that the British authorities<br />
should have jealously safeguarded the integrity of historical<br />
records such as this and indeed of the entire heritage of<br />
public records that, as Sir Geoffrey reminds us, stretches back<br />
without break to the Thirteenth Century.<br />
So it was all the more a welcome and significant token of<br />
goodwill towards us, that the British Parliament passed special<br />
legislation earlier this year to allow this document to be<br />
handed over today for permanent safekeeping in Australia.<br />
This document is a proof of the deep friendship that exists<br />
between Australia and the United Kingdom, and it is a<br />
remarkable-token of the intimate ties of history and<br />
constitutional democracy that we share.<br />
It is, simply, a gift of inestimable value and I stress the<br />
word ' gift'. This document has never before been owned by<br />
Australia. At the same time, it takes nothing away from our sense of<br />
gratitude to observe that this object, gift as it is, has<br />
always been Australian. Though it is only now that we<br />
formally own it, it is, in a real sense, simply being<br />
" returned" to us.<br />

That is, of course, because the Constitution and Federation<br />
that were enacted with this legislation were the end-product,<br />
the cap-stone, of a long and vital process by which the<br />
Australian people themselves decided to unite and live as one<br />
nation. It was the product of some ten years of intense negotiations by<br />
the leading members of the six Australian colonies. In draft<br />
form, it was put to popular vote and was adopted by a majority<br />
in each of the six colonies.<br />
So the words of the Australian premiers in 1900, when<br />
responding to British suggestions for amendments to the<br />
Constitution Bill, are timely today:<br />
" The Commonwealth Bill belongs in a very special sense<br />
to the people of Australia, whose only mandate to<br />
Governments and Parliaments is to seek its enactment by<br />
the Imperial Parliament in the form in which it was<br />
adopted by the people."<br />
History records that this viewpoint was largely accepted and<br />
the Bill passed the British Parliament on 5 July 1900. It<br />
received Royal Assent from Queen Victoria on 9 July and on<br />
17 September 1900 she signed a Proclamation having the effect<br />
of bringing the Constitution Act into force on 1 January 1901.<br />
Australia already holds duplicate originals of both the Royal<br />
Proclamation and the Commission of Royal Assent.<br />
So in obtaining this document today we are completing the set<br />
we are bringing together the trinity of documents which<br />
constitutes the birth certificate of Australia.<br />
So this document is now back where it rightly belongs in the<br />
possession of the Government of Australia, on display in the<br />
Parliament of Australia, for perusal by the people of<br />
Australia. For such an achievement, many people deserve credit.<br />
To Sir Geoffrey Howe, as the representative of the United<br />
Kingdom Government and Parliament, our primary thanks are due.<br />
When I met Prime Minister Thatcher in Gallipoli in April I took<br />
the opportunity of thanking her personally for this gift. I<br />
ask, Sir Geoffrey, that you take back to Prime Minister<br />
Thatcher and to your Parliament the heartfelt gratitude of the<br />
entire Australian Government, Parliament and people.<br />
Alf Morris also deserves great praise not only because his<br />
private member's bill did so much to break the logjam but also<br />
because, as leader of the ANZAC Parliamentary Group at<br />
Westminster he had the determination to garner cross-party<br />
support for the proposal, harnessed to an accurate<br />
understanding of the symbolic importance to Australians of the<br />
document in question.<br />
Many people on the Australian side have also contributed to<br />
this occasion 1 I </p>
<p>Senator Gareth Evans first suggested we seek an original<br />
copy of the Constitution from the British for our<br />
bicentennial celebrations<br />
our High Commissioner in Britain, Doug McClelland, has<br />
played an essential behind the scenes role<br />
and, not least, the Secretary of my Department Mike Codd,<br />
has assiduously pursued this matter with his British<br />
counterpart.<br />
Finally, it is appropriate to acknowledge the role of the two<br />
million or more Australians who have already visited this<br />
Parliament House and who have seen this document on display<br />
just above where we are standing demonstrating beyond doubt<br />
the interest of Australians in this fundamental part of our<br />
political, legal and cultural heritage.<br />
This is an occasion of which our founding fathers, the pioneers<br />
of the Australian Constitution, would have been deeply proud.<br />
So I add my welcome to all the descendants of these original<br />
statesmen of the Australian nation, who are honoured guests<br />
today. As you have mentioned, Sir Geoffrey, I have recently called on<br />
Australians to undertake a new effort to modernise and to make<br />
more efficient the Federal system under which we live. Part of<br />
this may involve a new initiative to amend by referendum some<br />
of the terms of the Federal compact agreed on by our colonial<br />
forebears nearly 100 years ago and enacted in this document.<br />
It is perhaps a matter of wonder that the original terms of the<br />
Constitution have proven so resilient to change over the years<br />
despite numerous opportunities for change being presented to<br />
the Australian electorate by Governments up to and including<br />
the present one. I can only assume that the frequency and<br />
strength of ' No" votes in referendums must be due to the<br />
abiding affection Australians feel for every section,<br />
sub-section, clause and word of the original Federal compact.<br />
Now that visitors to this Parliament House can see the original<br />
Constitutional documents in all their unabridged, unarnended,<br />
turn-of-the-century glory they may you never know hear the<br />
siren call of reform sounding in their ears. If " No" votes<br />
become " Yes" votes, we nay well have double reason for<br />
gratitude to you Sir Geoffrey and to your Parliamentary<br />
colleagues for your generosity.<br />
I now have great pleasure in accepting this gift on behalf of<br />
all Australians.<br />
