18 March 1997 TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
THE HON JOHN HOWARD MP<br />
NIGHTLINE WITH PAUL LYNEHAM<br />
E&amp; OE<br />
LYNEHAM:<br />
Prime Minister welcome to Nightline.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Pleasure. LYNEHAM: Do you think the situation in PNG has eased now?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well it's eased. And I'm pleased that the authority of the elected government has been<br />
inserted and it obviously still remains quite a tense situation but I welcome the fact that<br />
the authority of a duly elected democratic government has been established.<br />
LYNEHAM: Do you expect Sir Julius Chan to persist with his plan to use the mercenaries now or is<br />
that less tenable?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, that's really a matter for him to judge. I mean, all I can do, respecting the<br />
sovereignty of Papua New Guinea, is to make very clear that if he does there will be<br />
significant consequences to the relationship between Australia and his country. </p>
<p>LYNEHAM: Are you talking about our $ 320 million of aid?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well I'm not going to go into the detail of it. I've told him...<br />
LYNEHAM:<br />
That's your biggest stick, isn't it?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I've told him what our response will be he's in no doubt. And I repeated that<br />
position in Parliament today and I repeat it on your programme tonight.<br />
LYNEHAM: Along with that stick there's also the carrot, isn't there? Does that involve perhaps<br />
more military assistance ( inaudible) peace talks in Bougainville?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
What we have done is to put some appropriate alternatives on the table to the use of<br />
the mercenaries. I had four-and-a-half hours talks with him in Sydney the weekend<br />
before last and he has a very clear view of what we are willing to do and what we<br />
intend to do if certain circumstances lapse.<br />
LYNEHAM:<br />
On the ' work for the dole' scheme, legislation goes to the Parliament tomorrow.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Yes. LYNEHAM: Will the Government resist attempts to amend it to try to put more training into it to<br />
make it more a pathway to real jobs?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, we have other programmes dealing with that. This is a ' work for the dole'<br />
programme and we won't want to amend it in a way that robs it of its efficacy. We'll<br />
have a look at any amendments that are Put up but... </p>
<p>LYNEHAM: So how will you benchmark the success or failure of this scheme?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well that's the whole purpose of the pilots to establish benchmarks, see how these<br />
schemes work...<br />
LYNEHAM: Well what will you be looking for?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, we'll be looking for community response and if the early signs are any guide it's<br />
fantastic. It's talked about very widely, particularly in regional Australia...<br />
LYNEHAM:<br />
Jeff Kennett's been talking about it too.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Yes he has, I noticed that. Our members are very keen about it and, most importantly,<br />
the public sees it as working out the principle of mutual obligation in our community.<br />
We have an obligation to look after people who can't get a job. They, in return, have<br />
an obligation to respond to any reasonable request to work out the value of the<br />
unemployment benefit.<br />
LYNEHAM: Well Jeff Kennett says that it's crazy to exclude work in industries. He says that's<br />
where youngsters will pick up the sort of experience that will help them get into work.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Yes but you have training schemes for that. And you can't ask people to work five<br />
days a week for the dole because that would amount to paying them two or three<br />
dollars an hour.<br />
LYNEHAM: The first report on Senator Colston's travel claims was not tabled as promised in the<br />
Senate today. Is he getting special treatment from the Government?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
No. </p>
<p>LYNEHAM: Well he requests and then receives extra time to explain, then he'll put a published...<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well hang on a moment. He made that request to the President of the Senate. I've got<br />
no control over the President of the Senate.<br />
LYNEHAM: There's nothing going on behind the scenes?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Oh look, break it down. Look, he's not getting any special treatment. If you want to<br />
ask about the circumstances of that extension of time, go and ask the President of the<br />
Senate.<br />
LYNEHAM: From your long Parliamentary career, have you ever heard anyone before claiming<br />
travel allowance for 265 days in one year?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Yes I have actually.<br />
LYNEHAM:<br />
Oh, Paul Keating?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
No, well, well look, I don't carry around a recollection. But I have actually, I do recall<br />
some claims being made for numbers of days that were equal to or in excess of that,<br />
yes. LYNEHAM: And what about doing committee work on an Easter Sunday?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I don't, I don't have access... </p>
<p>LYNEHAM:<br />
These documents were put out today. These are Senators' travel claims over the last<br />
five years and I would have thought that Howard's battlers would look at this and say<br />
this is like a license to print money, this is offensive.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, I would have thought Howard's battlers, if people have rorted the system, are<br />
entitled to be angry. That applies to anybody who's roiled the system. Now I haven't<br />
gone through those. I've had a few other things on my plate today...<br />
LYNEIIAM: There's not much of a plot but it's very interesting reading.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well it may be interesting reading. But Paul my position is very simple, that there are<br />
privileges attached to being a member of Parliament and I have no time for any<br />
member of Parliament on either side who abuses privileges. Where they are abused<br />
people deserve everything they get. Equally, everybody's entitled to a fair hearing<br />
and/ or presumption of innocence.<br />
LYNEHAM: So let the cards fall where they may?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Indeed, where they may, no matter who is involved.<br />
LYNEHAM:<br />
Prime Minister thanks for your time.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Pleasure. </p>
