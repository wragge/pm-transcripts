    <content><![CDATA[<p>20 September 1996<br />E&amp;OE.........................................................</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER:</strong><br />Thank you very much Mr Chairman for that introduction. I welcome this opportunity in nearing the end of my first visir to Japan as Prime Minister to say a few words about<br />that visit; the reason why I came, what has been achieved and the significance of that visit to the relationship between Japan and Australia.</p>
<p>I came to Japan in the first major overseas visit I have undertaken as Prime Minister quite deliberately because of the extremely close relationship between our two countries, my desire to establish a personal association with the Japanese Prime Minister, particularly before the meeting of leaders of the APEC countries and to make it abundantly clear that although the new government of Australia was going to do some things quite differently from the former government, there was an essential continuity of the relationship and the foreign policy positioning of Australia so far as the Asia-Pacific region was concerned. It is for that reason also that this visit embraced a visit to Indonesia carrying with it the opportunity for me to see President Soeharto for the first time in my capacity as Prime Minster. I can report that those goals in relation to both Indonesia and Japan have been completely achieved but my remarks this afternoon will appropriately be directed towards my visit to Japan.</p>
<p>I have established a very friendly working relationship with the Japanese Prime Minister. Our discussions both in the formal session and over lunch were warm and frank. I was able to tell him of the importance that the new Australian governinent placed upon the relacionship with Japan and I was able to canvass a number of specific items both in the context of our bilateral relationship and also in the context of our common membership of the APEC grouping and also our common identity as partners in the Asia-Pacific region. But I will come to those particular items in a moment.</p>
<p>The visit was also an opportunity to speak to leaders of the business community here in Japan. I had the opportunity of getting their views on investment flows and the reactions were entirely positive. I was struck at both a political and a business level at the knowledge of the initiatives of the new government and the widespread approval of those business and political leaders, of the initiative of the government in tackling the budget deficit and also the initiative of our government in proposing reforms to the labour market and other micro-economic reforms. Virtually every personÂ I met raised these initiatives in an entirely positive and welcoming fashion.</p>
<p>I extended an invitation to the keidanren to send a mission to Australia next Â year andÂ that invitation was warmly accepted. I have also renewed the invitation of theÂ government to Mr Hashimoto to visit Australia next year and also a longy standingÂ invitation to H-is Majesty the Emperor to visit Australia.</p>
<p>In addition to the matters that were mentioned at our joint press conference thisÂ morning, I also raised with the Japanese Prime Minister two specific matters ofÂ particular concern to certain Australian interests. One of those was a request to theÂ Japanese Government that it include in its detailed plans for APEC a major initiativeÂ towards fuirther trade liberalisation in the area of agriculture. I also raised the specificÂ timing problems involved in the auction of foreign quotas of rice imports into Japan,Â the current timing of which particularly disadvantages Australian rice producers andÂ exporters.</p>
<p>I can say, ladies and gentlemen, that there is a remarkable coincidence of viewsÂ between Australia and Japant regarding regional issues. Both of use share a very strongÂ commnitment to the goals of APEC. Each of us realises that the details of particularÂ action plans and the specific intent of the member countries of the APEC groupingÂ regarding trade liberalisation will ultimately demnonstrate how successfuil the groupingÂ and its goals are going to be. We also, as mentioned at our press conference, shareÂ fairly common views regarding the importance of engaging China and in particular ofÂ securing the inclusion of China in the World Â Trade Organisation.</p>
<p>Over lunch the Prime Minister and I had the opportunity of canvassing a very wideÂ range of regional and indeed world issues and I particularly valued the more than twoÂ and a half hours that we spent together today. It gave me a unique opportunity soÂ early in my Prime Ministership to get the views, the very candid and open views of theÂ Japanese Prime Minister about world and regional political issues and what thoseÂ exchanges demonistrated to mne yet again was that the relationship between AustraliaÂ and Japan is anything but just an economic relationship. Over the years it has ripenedÂ into a very diverse and intricate relationship; certainly a very strong, indeed a criticalÂ economic component so far as both countries are concerned but it also has a very richÂ political cultural and increasingly personal dimension to it. I found in all of thoseÂ respects my meeting wvith the Prime Minister today to be extremely beneficial and itÂ certainly has provided an excellent stimulus for close relations between the newÂ Government of Australia and the Government of Japan. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong><br />In Japan the general election will be comning up very soon and one of the major agendaÂ for the Japanese election would be the administrative reform. Now, in your countryÂ Prime Minister Howard you have been implementing administrative reform. I wonderÂ if you could elaborate the goals behind your effobrts to reform the administration andÂ the Government and what you intend to do with the reform and what has been theÂ response on the Australians vis-i-vis your reform efforts? You have stated that yourÂ reform efforts been favorably received by the Japanese political and the businessÂ leaders but what has been the response within your own county.</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER:</strong><br />The domestic response has beart one of near universal acclaim. We've had a very, veryÂ positive response fiom. the people. We brought down a strong but fair budget which<br />provided for very heavy cuts in government spending and an underlying surplus by yearÂ three of our administration and that has certainly been accepted by the Australian<br />people by and large. There are obviously some areas of criticism but by and large itÂ has been very, very well accepted, in fact beyond the expectations of some so far as its<br />reception is concerned.</p>
<p>The purpose of our reforms is very simple and that is to address the fundamentalÂ problems of the Australian economy and those problems mean that we cannot grow at<br />a fast enough rate to reduce unemployment. And the reason we can't grow at a fastÂ enough rate to reduce unemployment is that we have a chronic savings problemn which<br />means that when we grow we suck in too many imports and wve have to depend uponÂ the savings of foreigners in order to finance those additional imports. Anid the other<br />weakness we have is that our labour market is very rigid and we've proposed majorÂ reforms in that area So, we're tackling the savings problem via. reducing the budget<br />deficit and we're tackling the structural rigidity problem by reforming the labourÂ market and there are other subsidiary reforms but they are the core reformns which are<br />being proposed by the Government. They were reforms that I believe received theÂ endorsement of the Australian people at the election six months ago and I think the<br />Australian public wants those reforms implemented and rthe Australian public believesÂ that they ought to be given an opportunity of working their way through the economny<br />and we want to take the spced limits off growth because it is only by doing that, thatÂ we can hope, over time to reduce unemployment.Â </p>
<p><strong>QUESTION;</strong><br />You mention you had raised APEC with the Japanese Prime Minister specificallyÂ asking himn for Japan to present a liberalisation measure in agrictlture. What was his<br />response arnd do you have any specifies in mind that Japan might be able to present inÂ November?</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER:</strong><br />That and the issue relating to r-ice will be considered by the Japanese Government.Â You asked meÂ for some examples of major initiatives that's perhaps something thatÂ Â we may ffurther canvass with the Japanese Governmnent between now and the meetingÂ but the matter is now obviously going to be considered and the proposal that I put toÂ the Prime Minister, but beyond that it wouldn't be appropriate for me to say anything.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong><br />I understand how in July this year your Government and the US Government hasÂ discussed the strengt~ hening of your ties in the security field and you have also carriedÂ out a joint exercise with the United States. I wonder if you could explain the backdropÂ as to, explain the backdrop of your strenigthening your security ties with the UnitedÂ States, are you expecting the United States to, are you intending to enhance yourÂ security position of your own country through greater presence of US forces in yourÂ country or are such manoeuvres more or less intend or have in sight the, have in sightÂ China. In other words is China one element in your efforts to enhance your securityÂ ties with the Tlnitcd States? That's the first question.</p>
<p>Secondly, we understand that Australia is contemplating a possible expansion ofÂ exercises by your marine, by your marine core, your marines.. As you know there areÂ some rumors within Japan that should Australia be expTanding your marine forces thenÂ that could possible lead to a reduction of US forces, the size of the US forces station inÂ Okinawa? In other words the expansion of your marines could in a sense effect lead toÂ realignment or consolidation of the US forces bases now stationed Okinawa. Are youÂ in the future contemplating accepting US forces to your soil in Australia because of the Â vast land that you enjoy or is inviting US forces to your soil not part of the agenda andÂ if that is the case why would you not contemplate accepting US forces on your soil?</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER:</strong><br />WellÂ Australia has had a long standing security arrangement with the United StatesÂ and it seemed to the new Government the most natural thing in the world that thatÂ security arrangement should be reaffirmed and given a freshen up which is basicallyÂ what occurred at the AUSMIN talks. Incidentally the Japanese Prime MinisterÂ remarked with approval today at both our private discussion and if I recall at our jointÂ press conference at the desirability of the joint declaration between Australian and theÂ United States in July and in fact likened it to the, although it has a different dimensionÂ and different history, he likened it to the joint declaration made between himself andÂ President Clinton.</p>
<p>I think the best way I can answer the second part of the question is say there is noÂ Okinawa link It is a completely separate situation and it would be to misunderstandÂ the context in which we reaffirm, and if you like, freshened up the defence alliance withÂ the United States to see it as having any kind of link. The Okinawa situation is aÂ matter between the United States and Japan and it is not something that was inÂ contemplation when the AUSMJN talks to place.</p>
<p>The facilities and the exercises that will be made available and will take place by and inÂ Australia are really just a progression of the relationship which has been very close, itsÂ been veiy long standing. I happen to believe, my Governmecnt believes and I know theÂ Japanese Government anid the Japanese Prime Minister believes that the presence ofÂ the United States is a force for stability in the region. I don't put it in the context ofÂ being country specific so far as other regional powers are concerned it is obviously aÂ force for stability.</p>
<p>It is in ' the interests of all countries in the region to have a United States presence andÂ we are quite open, we are quite unambiguous about that and in mny discussions with the<br />Japanese Prime Minister today he was of the same mind and we both warn the UnitedÂ States in the region and I think one of the, if I may say so, one of the very best things<br />in foreign policy the Japanese Prime Minister has done is the way in which he handledÂ the relationship w~ ith the United States. The joint declaration of a few months ago<br />brought to an end some trade difficulties betwcen the two countries and I think showedÂ great vision and great leadership and he deserved all the praise that he received for it.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong><br />You mentioned that in your discussions with Japanese political and business elites thereÂ was a generally good response on the questions of both your fiscal and industrial<br />relations reforms. For the benefit of our Japanese hosts you do not control the UpperÂ I-ouse of the Australian Parliament the Senate, and you need the Senate vote to get<br />those reforms through. Do you think there was a clear message from Japan, as ourÂ biggest trading partner, to an obstructionist Senate in Australia?</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER:</strong><br />I am sure that my hosts were too well mannered to interfere in Australian domesticÂ politics. They expressed in all cases spontaneously support for the meAsures that weÂ had taken, that we were proposing. They did not then go on ' to say ' I hope it is notÂ obstructed in the Senate'. They obviously didn't do that. It would be inappropriate. IÂ think the messages to the Senate are really messages to me IQ convey. I wouldn't seekÂ to put words into the mouths of my hosts. That would be wrong. But nobody shouldÂ be in any doubt at a that across the boayd, both~ political and businesswise, they wereÂ aware of what we had done with the budget, they are aware of what we are proposingÂ in respect of industrial relations. Some of themn, of course, particularly some of theÂ security houses, were aware of what we are proposing in relation to Telstra anid thereÂ is very great interest in it and -very great support for it. I would be putting words intoÂ their mouths if I said they mentioned the Senate, they didn't.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong><br />Australia is a very signficant member of the UK Commonwealth-As amember of theÂ Commonwealth how do you assess, how do you view the Royal Family in Britain andÂ what future outlook do you have for the Royal Family ofÂ Britain?</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER:</strong><br />That is an interesting way of asking me whether I think Australia should become aÂ republic, or not. My anti-republican views are well known in Australia; they were notÂ disguised from the Australian people in the lead-up to the election nor was my veryÂ strong view that Australia's constitutional future is a matter To be decided by theÂ Australiant people in accordance with the processes of the Australian Constitution. It isÂ not normallyÂ a matter that I would myself raise outside of the country. I was critical ofÂ my predecessor for raising the matter, outside of Australia, I-do not intend to fall intoÂ the same error. In answer to your question, whether or not Australia becomes aÂ republic will be determined entirely by the Australian people. It is uniquely for theÂ Australian people and for nobody else to decide. I should perhaps add what I added inÂ Indonesia to a similar question asked in a slightly different fashion and that is that IÂ don't think it really matters what our constitutional form is; it is the quality andÂ substance of our attitude to the nations of the world and the nations of this regionÂ which will determine whether we have good relations with themi or not. The nations ofÂ the Asia-Pacific region are a mixture of constitutionial forms but beyond that I reallyÂ think the question of Australia's republican or other status is a matter for theÂ Australian people to decide and I will certainly see to it during my Prime MInistershipÂ that there is a vote on the issue as I promnised. L</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong><br />You have outlined aspects of your reform agenda, I am just wondering how you assessÂ the risk of ainy short term transitional costs in the form of higher unernpioyment orÂ higher industrial disputation?</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER:</strong><br />I don't believe our proposals will lead to high unemployment, 1 believe they will lead toÂ low unemployment. As far as industrial disputation is concerned there will be noÂ warrant or justification for any industrial disputation in response to the legislationÂ because there is nothing in the legislation which is unfai to the trade union movementÂ and there is nothing in the legislation which was not made known to the AustralianÂ people before they voted us in with a majority vote of 40 in the House ofÂ Representatives. In both political and moral and industrial terms there would be noÂ justification and I do not believe, in the broad sweep of things that there will be anyÂ significant industrial disputation as a consequence. ' That has been my personal viewÂ and remains my strong personal view and the view of the Government.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong><br />I would like to ask about the venue of the international Excpo for the year 2005. FromÂ what we understand from some reports by local newspapers in Australia it seems thatÂ the Gold Coast and the environs of Queensland would be expecting its candidacy toÂ host the in ternational Expo, from what we have heard the State Government is alsoÂ endorsing the Gold Coast as a bid to become the venue, As the head of the FederalÂ Governmnent, Prime Minister, have you received -any formal or informal indication fromÂ the concerned parties in Australia about the possible candidacy? Secondly, I am sureÂ that during the course of your stay in Japan you have heard about Japan's interestÂ about hosting the international Expo in the year 2005. Should the local community inÂ your country decide to host the international Expo what would your position be vis-a-visÂ possible support rendered to the Japanese Government? I do hope you willÂ understand my interest because IÂ am from the local community of the Aichi Prefecture.</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER:</strong><br />The answer to that is that obviously if there is an Australian candidate I will be veryÂ strongly supporting the Australian candidate. It is a bit difficult for me to hypothesiseÂ as to what happens if there is not because that might sound back home as though IÂ don't think there is a worthwhile Australian candidate. I would never want to give thatÂ impression. Obviously if there isn't, then given our close association with Japan IÂ indicated to a number of people who had raised it and a number of people had raised it,Â I indicated that we would obviously give sympathetic consideration. But I can't reallyÂ say any mnore than that at this stage. I don't even know what other countries may beÂ putting forward proposals and it is still in the very formative stages. Certainly I amÂ aware of the proposal from the Queensland Government and I will naturally be veryÂ sympathetic according to the merits of it and you have to wait arnd see what happens.</p>
<p><strong>MODERATOR:</strong><br />I would like to thank you for comingÂ and responding to issues and questions whichÂ covered a very wise and broad spectrum in a clear cut manner.</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER:</strong><br />Thank you very much.</p>
