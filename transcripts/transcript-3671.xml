QUEENSLAND BROADCAST NO. 2<br />
RESOURCES<br />
RECORDED BY THE PRIME MINISTER FOR BROADCAST 30 MARCH 1975<br />
ONE OF THE GREAT THINGS THE LABOR GOVERNMENT<br />
HAS DONE FOR QUEENSLAND IS SECURE FAIR MARKET PRICES<br />
VASTLY HIGHER PRICES FOR HER MINERAL EXPORTS. THIS<br />
IS ESPECIALLY TRUE OF QUEENSLAND' S COAL. OUR POLICIES<br />
HAVE BROUGHT A HUGE INCREASE IN WEALTH AND EXPORT<br />
EARNINGS To AUSTRALIA AND TO THIS STATE IN PARTICULAR.<br />
YOU'LL REMEMBER THAT WHEN LABOR WAS<br />
ELECTED ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS WE DID WAS SET UP A<br />
NEW DEPARTMENT OF MINERALS AND ENERGY. BECAUSE OF THE<br />
IMPORTANCE OF AUSTRALIA'S MINERAL RESOURCES WE WANTED<br />
A STRONG DEPARTMENT, WITH A STRONG MINISTER, TO LOOK<br />
AFTER THE EXPLORATION, DEVELOPMENTo PROCESSING AND SALE<br />
OF OUR RESOURCES IN COOPERATION WITH PRIVATE ENTERPRISES<br />
WE WERE DETERMINED THAT OUR MINERALS WOULD BE DEVELOPED<br />
IN A WAY THAT WOULD BRING MAXIMUM BENEFITS TO THE<br />
AUSTRALIAN PEOPLE, ,1/ 2 </p>
<p>-2-<br />
THINGS WERE IN A PROPER MESS WHEN WE<br />
CAME IN. THERE WAS NO NATIONAL POLICY FOR OUR MINERAL<br />
AND ENERGY RESOURCES. MORE AND MORE OF THEM WERE<br />
FALLING INTO OVERSEAS HANDS. AFTER YEARS OF LIBERAL<br />
COUNTRY PARTY RULE, 62% OF OUR ENERGY RESOURCES<br />
WERE CONTROLLED BY FOREIGN COMPANIES, THE PREVIOUS<br />
GOVERNMENT HAD ALLOWED THE MINING INDUSTRY TO WRITE<br />
LONG-TERM CONTRACTS AND DETERMINE PRICES FOR OUR<br />
EXPORTS WITHOUT REGARD FOR THE NATIONAL INTEREST,<br />
THE RESULT WAS THAT EXPORTING COMPANIES WERE FIGHTING<br />
EACH OTHER, CUTTING PRICES FOR THE SALE OF OUR MINERALS<br />
AND REDUCING THE RETURNS TO AUSTRALIA, ONE OF THE<br />
SILLIEST ASPECTS OF THE ' ANYTHING GOES' APPROACH<br />
WAS COMPETITION BETWEEN THE STATES. QUEENSLAND WAS<br />
ONE OF THE PRINCIPAL LOSERS IN THIS FREE-FOR-ALL.<br />
OUR NEW DEPARTMENT, HEADED BY MY<br />
COLLEAGUE, REX CONNOR, PUT AN END TO ALL THIS, WITHIN<br />
WEEKS OF COMING TO OFFICE WE DECIDED THAT THE NATIONAL<br />
GOVERNMENT SHOULD HAVE FULL AUTHORITY OVER THE EXPORT OF<br />
OUR MINERAL RESOURCES. WE DECIDED IT WAS TIME TO<br />
HALT THE DRIFT OF OUR INDUSTRIES INTO OVERSEAS HANDS. </p>
<p>-3-<br />
YOU HEAR A LOT OF CRITICISM OF REX<br />
CONNOR AND HIS DEPARTMENT, BUT THE FACTS AND FIGURES<br />
PROVE JUST HOW SUCCESSFUL OUR POLICIES HAVE BEEN.<br />
THE FUTURE OF QUEENSLAND's COAL INDUSTRY HAS NEVER<br />
LOOKED BRIGHTER, EXPORTS ARE AT A RECORD LEVEL, BOTH IN<br />
VOLUME AND PRICES IN QUEENSLAND, WHERE THE COAL INDUSTRY<br />
is 85% FOREIGN OWNED, INTERVENTION BY THE AUSTRALIAN<br />
GOVERNMENT IN NEGOTIATIONS HAS RESULTED IN SUBSTANTIAL<br />
PRICE INCREASES, ThE TOTAL VALUE OF INCREASES NEGOTIATED<br />
BETWEEN THE BEGINNING OF 1973 AND THE END OF SEPTEMBER<br />
LAST YEAR WAS MORE THAN $ 1,364 MILLION OVER THE FULL<br />
DELIVERY TERMS OF ALL QUEENSLAND COAL EXPORT CONTRACTS.<br />
THE VALUE OF THE INCREASES ACTUALLY RECEIVED IN THE SAME<br />
PERIOD WAS IN THE ORDER OF $ 67 MILLION. AUSTRALIAN<br />
COAL EXPORTS TO ALL MARKETS ARE ESTIMATED TO BE ABOUT<br />
$ 1100 MILLION FOR THIS-YEAR, 1975. THAT IS AN INCREASE<br />
OF ABOUT $ 476 MILLION OVER LAST YEAR. IN THE CASE OF<br />
IRON ORE, THE TOTAL VALUE OF AUSTRALIAN EXPORTS TO ALL<br />
MARKETS THIS YEAR IS LIKELY TO EXCEED $ 800 MILLIONS<br />
THAT'S MORE THAN DOUBLE THE EXPORT EARNINGS IN 1972,<br />
THE LAST YEAR THE LIBERAL-COUNTRY PARTY GOVERNMENT WAS<br />
IN OFFICE. o. a/ 4 </p>
<p>OF %-COUISE THAT' S NOT ALL WE'VE DONE IN THE<br />
MINERALS AND ENERGY FIELD. WE HAD A GREAT BATTLE<br />
IN PARLIAMENT TO GET OUR LEGISLATION THROUGH FOR A<br />
PETROLEUM AND MINERALS AUTHORITY. LIKE THE MEDIBANK<br />
BILLS, IT HAD TO BE PASSED AT THE JOINT SITTING<br />
OF BOTH HOUSES LAST YEAR, AND LIKE MEDIBANKo PEOPLE<br />
ARE NOW SEEING JUST HOW VALUABLE AND NECESSARY OUR<br />
PETROLEUM AND MINERALS AUTHORITY IS. ITS AIM IS TO EXPLORE,<br />
DEVELOP, PRODUCE, TRANSPORT, PROCESS AND SELL AUSTRALIAN<br />
PETROLEUM AND MINERALS. AND IT WILL DO SO WHILE<br />
RETAINING MAXIMUM AUSTRALIAN OWNERSHIP OF OUR RESOURCESTHAT'I<br />
S WHAT IT'I S ALL ABOUT. A MAJOR PORTION OF THE<br />
AUTHORITY'S EXPENDITURE OF $ 50 MILLION THIS FINANCIAL YEAR<br />
IS AVAILABLE TO ASSIST AUSTRALIAN MINING VENTURES.<br />
WHEN REX CONNOR WAS WITH ME IN QUEENSLAND LAST YEAR<br />
HE ANNOUNCED THAT THE AUTHORITY HAD TAKEN UP ITS FIRST<br />
EQUITY IN A QUEENSLAND VENTURE MAREEBA MINING. IT<br />
NOW HAS EQUITIES IN' TWO OTHER COMPANIES AS WELL,<br />
WE HAVE MADE A GREAT START IN OUR PLAN FOR<br />
A NATIONAL PIPELINE SYSTEM TO CARRY NATURAL GAS<br />
INTERSTATE. THE NATIONAL PIPELINE WILL MEAN TWO THINGSSTEADY<br />
SUPPLIES OF GAS AND STABLE PRICES, OV/ ER 400<br />
KILOMETRES OF THE PIPELINE HAVE ALREADY BEEN LAID.<br />
WHEN IT'S COMPLETED IT-WILL BE THE BIGGEST ENGINEERING<br />
ACHIEVEMENT IN AUSTRALIA'S HISTORY, AUSTRALIA AT<br />
PRESENT MEETS ONLY 7% OF HER FUEL AND ENERGY NEEDS FROMNATURAL<br />
GAS; COMPARABLE INDUSTRIALISED COUNTRIES USE<br />
22% 1 I </p>
<p>So WHEN OUR GAS RESOURCES ARE BEING FULLY USED<br />
AUSTRALIA WILL BE MUCH LESS DEPENDENT ON IMPORTED<br />
FUEL OIL, AND MILLIONS OF DOLLARS WILL BE CUT<br />
FROM OUR IMPORT VILL,<br />
SIMILARLY, TO DEVELOP AUSTRALIA'S VAST<br />
URANIUM DEPOSITS IN THE NORTHERN TERRITORY, WE HAVE<br />
AUTHOR ISED THE ATOMIC ENERGY COMMISSION JO MINE AND SELL<br />
OUR URANIUM RESERVES AT RANGER IN THE ALLIGATOR RIVER<br />
DISTRICT. I FOUND TERMENDOUS INTEREST IN THE<br />
PURCHASE OF AUSTRALIAN URANIUM DURING MY RECENT<br />
VISIT TO EUROPE, AT THE SAME TIME WE HAVE REACHED<br />
AGREEMENT WITH JAPAN ON A JOINT STUDY IN URANIUM<br />
ENRICHMENT A PROCESS THAT WILL GREATLY INCREASE<br />
THE VALUE OF OUR RESERVES.<br />
THESE ARE ALL SOUND, PRACTICALPOSITIVE<br />
ACHIEVEMENTS. THEY WILL NOT ONLY INCREASE OUR<br />
NATIONAL WEALTH AND STANDARD OF LIVING BUT MAKE US MORE<br />
SELF-SUFFICIENT THE WORLD ENERGY SHORTAGE HAS<br />
BROUGHT PROBLEMS TO MANY OF OUR GREAT TRADING PARTNERS<br />
WITH AUSTRALIA'S PRECIOUS RESOURCES KEPT AS FAR AS<br />
POSSIBLE IN AUSTRALIAN HANDS, AND DEVELOPED IN AUSTRALIA'S<br />
INTERESTS, WE ARE GOING TO BE IN A MUCH BETTER POSITION IN<br />
THE YEARS AHEAD TO DEFEND OUR STANDARD OF LIVING AND<br />
DEVELOP OUR COUNTRY IN AN ENERGY-HU4GRY WORLD,<br />
SOME OF OUR POLICIES MAY NOT FIND FAVOUR WITH PARTICULAR<br />
GROUPS OR INTERESTS AT THE MOMENT, BUT BELIEVE ME, THEY<br />
ARE IN THE LONG-TERM INTERESTS OF OUR COUNTRY AND OF<br />
ALL THE AUSTRALIAN PEOPLE, </p>
