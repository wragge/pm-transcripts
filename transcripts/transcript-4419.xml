AUSTRALIA<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
UNEDITED TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME 1IMISTER'S ADDRESS TO THE<br />
COMMONWEALTH HEADS OF GOVERNMENT -MEETING, LONDON, 9 JUNE 1977<br />
The remarks made by the Prime Minister of' Singapore and the reply<br />
from Guyana yesterday have prompted me to try and put one<br />
or two points from an Australian perspective.<br />
First could I say that I think there is much in what<br />
the Prime Minister of India has said to us. As one of the newest<br />
representatives here I would be disappuointed if a number of heads<br />
of government, as we are, sat round for a few days but were not able to<br />
make some advance on one or two of the vexed and difficult<br />
problems that concern us all and issues on the agenda of<br />
Southern Africa, economic issues, 11orth-South issues. It would<br />
be a disappointing conference if we could not see an advance<br />
in these areas at-the end of the day.<br />
There is an inter-relationship with what happens, that almost<br />
makes Singapore and Guyana both right in what they said yesterday.<br />
That might sound oad, but there is a many-sidedness to the<br />
truth of certain situations. I woc. ie'-r whether it does not lie<br />
in the interaction of power, of ideas, of actions and that it<br />
is an understanding of that that is part of our basic dilemma.<br />
As Guyana said, there is a third option, or certainly appears to be,<br />
between a very stark choice of Communism on the one hand or<br />
a nti-Communism on the other. At the same time there is a<br />
certain reality that affects us all. We might not sometimes like<br />
that reality and what the Great Powers do certainly what the<br />
Super Powers do, but what other countries do in many ways<br />
affects us all, or affects a number of us. Sometimes they<br />
might take actions that affect us Intentionally; quite often<br />
they might take actions that affect other countries<br />
unintentionally. However, the point I would like to<br />
develop is that I do not think it is possible for any of us really<br />
to say that there is something going on that might be affecting<br />
a significant part of the world, but that does not affect us all.<br />
What is involved is sonething that -will affect us impinge upon the<br />
way we can go about our own business. Let me develop this<br />
for a moment.<br />
It is not just military power, or the power of ideas or<br />
economnic power or numbcer alone f!: idetermines the course of<br />
world events, although quite clearly all these things have significant<br />
impact on it. It is the inter-relationship of the complex network<br />
/ 2 </p>
<p>2.<br />
of all these things that'ult imat elY determines what happens, whether<br />
it is in my part of the world, or whether it is in other parts.<br />
If I could give one or two examples. The choice. was mentioned<br />
yesterday between Communisifi and anti-Communism, and<br />
Prime Minister Lee mentioned some facets of Communism which appearto<br />
' have been the same: that refugees always flee; people do<br />
not seem to want to go to Communist regimes; the countries<br />
have not escaped its embrace once it has absorbed them.<br />
On the other hand, I believe, it is very clear to all of us that<br />
there are great differences between the Communism practised in<br />
different countries or at least in the attitude of those countries.*<br />
It would be hard to say Russian and Chinese Communism is the<br />
same or Yugoslavian or Vietnamese Communism. Do we know<br />
yet how divergent Communism in different countries is going to<br />
become or do we believe that in the future they will become more<br />
and more the same?<br />
In the nature of things I think it is more likely that there would<br />
be a divergence and perhaps an increasing one, but quite obviously<br />
South-Easth Asia is much affected by the course , that China takes,<br />
by decisions that China makes, or fails to make, by support<br />
for activities-outside its own borders one way or another, and<br />
South-East Asia can also be much affected by the course of<br />
Vietnamese actions, by the relationship that develops between<br />
the present states of Indo-China and China itself.<br />
We cannot avoid being affected at least in my part of the world<br />
by the flow out of these particular changes.<br />
In another area where I believe the Australian position has<br />
often been much misquoted by the media I think any statements<br />
I-have made or my Foreign Minister has made have been moderatethe,<br />
Indian Ocean. We have been concerned for balance, balance at th.,!<br />
lowest possible level, and certainly do not want to see any arms<br />
race between super powers or anyone else in that particular area,<br />
but we do-want to * see a balance. People might-disagree with that,<br />
but I have not really heard that concept itself attacked.<br />
Why is that area important? It'is not only important-to the<br />
littoral states, but it is also important to Japan, as a source<br />
of oil supplies which must get through the trade routes.<br />
If that were at any stage,* at any time, interdicted there would'<br />
obviously be very serious consequences niot only for Japan but<br />
for the course of action that-* Japan would have to take to protect<br />
her own future. So again we have an inter-relationship and I think<br />
sometimes we might fail to stand off sufficiently far to understand<br />
the full consequences of actions that might take place in one<br />
corner, and to note that those consequences might be<br />
in much wider areas.<br />
Prime Minister Lee also mentioned the question of trade and<br />
protection. I believe this is something that affects all of us,<br />
but it is also a subject which we all intrinsically look at from our<br />
own particular points of view. I know quite well that Asian<br />
countries, for example, would want a greater degree of trade<br />
with Australia, greater access to Australia's markets, even though<br />
those markets are in total relatively small. But protection<br />
on our protected goods, manufactured goods, has in fact come down<br />
about thirty percent, and for the last several years Asian trade </p>
<p>3.<br />
with Australia has increased its penetration of our<br />
markets by twenty-nine percent each year. I do not think as<br />
great a rate of penetration as that is really sustainable<br />
without domestic effects-which could obviously be serious<br />
and result in domestic reaction that one would not, want.<br />
But then again, what Australia can do in trade, what another<br />
country can do must relate to other parts of the world.<br />
I will not go into this in any detail, but I think there are<br />
certain difficulties especially where you have pressures<br />
to have less protection on manufactured goods and pressures<br />
in relation to agricultural goods..<br />
I know in -relation to developing countries the LOME Convention<br />
has given some degree of access, bu t whether that is comissary<br />
with the kind of access that the developed nations that<br />
Europe expects for manufactured goods, I would somewhat doubt.<br />
We have seen in the last few days how some manufactured products<br />
from Japan have been banned in Italy for the time being.<br />
How long the ban will last I suppose nobody knows, but<br />
does anyone stop to think what impact that is going to have?<br />
If that is starting to introduce into -manufactured goods the<br />
kind of protective devices that have hitherto only been used<br />
by the Community in agricultural commodities, then the consequences<br />
for a country like Japan are going to be enormous and go far beyond.<br />
the immediate perspective of trade or the inability to trade<br />
and in this area perhaps Japan is a long way from Europe.<br />
Australia's perspective on Japan' s necessities might be<br />
quite different from Europe's, but as we would see it, Japan,<br />
which is pre-eminently a manufacturing and trading nation,<br />
with a resource basically for her own people alone, needs<br />
to have access to markets, needs to have access to raw materials<br />
and also regards as important her defence relationship with the<br />
United States.<br />
If the defence relationship with the United States were upsetand<br />
there is no suggestion that that would occur the present<br />
course of her policies, as the Prime Minister of Singapore<br />
indicated, I think yesterday, might well have to be re-thought,<br />
even though that could involve a change in her Constitution<br />
but if market access to the only areas in the world which can<br />
presently give Japan the markets which are necessary to sustain<br />
her United States and Europe begin to be denied her,<br />
then the consequences for the Pacific region, and for far beyond,<br />
I believe, would be very great indeed. I do not think we should<br />
ignore the fact that two or three ministers of the present government<br />
have said that they take some signs in the trading of the world as<br />
consequences that caused Japan to arm and go to war in the thirties.<br />
Again, banning the import of manufactured goods in one line,<br />
Italy to Japan, people might think is an action which has no real<br />
great consequence, but how does it * go? Where is the next step?<br />
W~ hen does that road end, because if it goes too far, the<br />
consequences would be very great indeed. Part of what I am saying<br />
is that there is one world, in a number of areas, such as in trade,<br />
and in what happens to the inter-relationship between nations,<br />
it is also one world geographically, because whether it is<br />
the Southern Pacific, or Asia, these areas can be affected<br />
by the policies of major powers, whether those areas wnat to be<br />
affected or not. We would hope for example, that there is never<br />
a competition for influence in our area or the area to the north<br />
of us, but if that competition for influence emerged could any </p>
<p>one of the* countries in that particular area stop it against<br />
major powers? I think it might be very difficult to<br />
stop. So again, it is a question of what everyone does that<br />
affects us all. The course that Japan takes, I have indicated,<br />
could have repercussions over a much wider area, even though we did<br />
not want it. Europe involved the whole world in world wars twice and now<br />
we hope that the European Economic Community and its political objective<br />
will prevent that ever happening again. Again, wherever we live,<br />
there is a possibility not only of being infected but by<br />
being involved even against our worldo-and I think<br />
this again indicates it is not really possible to shut doors<br />
and pre . tend that problems of difficulties do not exist.<br />
The question of human rights, which is very much in our minds<br />
and ' in the minds of many people, obviously affects the relationship<br />
between nations and the problems of Southern Africa are going to be<br />
discussed at a later occasion, but there there are the policies<br />
pursued by countries which are an offence to human decency and<br />
are a scourge on the dignity of man. How long will they continue?<br />
I think there is no policy more offensive than the policy of<br />
Apartheid, and whatever one might think of it in terms of*<br />
its own logic, it is doomed to failure, but at the same time to suggest<br />
that what happens in Africa is not going to affect relations between<br />
places in many different countires nobody is suggesting that: now.<br />
but agai'n, emphasising the point that there is inter-relationship<br />
between what happens in one place, with what happens in another<br />
place, even though it might be on the other side of the world.<br />
It cannot be ignored.<br />
Just a couple of other points. I sometimes suspect there<br />
is a danger of habit for international forums. The problems<br />
are there and they remain. We are here this year. If they are<br />
not solved we will be back again in a couple of years and maybe<br />
progress will be-made before then. I would hope the Commonwealth<br />
can put aside the danger of habit, and have a renewed approach, as<br />
the Prime Minister of India,' think, wanted to. see in major problems..<br />
What: happens is not really separable and we cannot pretend things<br />
are not going to affect us. I suspect the presence of everyone<br />
here is a recognition of that. We should make sure words<br />
do not become a substitute for action, but at the same time we need<br />
a tolerance which has already been demonstrated in the diverse views<br />
around this forum. We need to understand the consequences of<br />
our actions not only on ourselves, but on other people sometimes<br />
far from us, an inter-relation between what we-do., and<br />
what other people do, is very real; -that it needs to be understood<br />
and I would very much hope than when we get to the specific<br />
areas, and are recognising some of the points that<br />
have been made during the course of this debate, we will be able<br />
to take advances on specific areas which will come before us.<br />
