%, AUSTRLIA<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 23 March 1983<br />
Premier Zhao Ziyang of the People's Republic of China<br />
will visit Australia on 17-23 April 1983.<br />
Premier Zhao will be accompanied by Wu Xueqian,<br />
Minister for Foreign Affairs, Jia Shi, Vice Minister responsible<br />
for trade and He Kang, Vice Minister responsible for agriculture.<br />
The visit marks the 10th Anniversary of the establishment<br />
of diplomatic ties, under a previous Labor administration, between<br />
Australia and China.<br />
The visit underlines the importance both Australia and<br />
China attach to their relationship.<br />
I look forward to meeting the Premier, andcdicussing<br />
with him a wide range of matters of international and regional<br />
concern. The meetings and discussions which are scheduled will<br />
contribute to a further development of the ties between the two<br />
countries.* The Premier's itinerary has been arranged to allow him<br />
to see as much of Australia as possible while providing time<br />
for official discussions.<br />
The itinerary will include visits to Canberra, New South<br />
Wales and Queensland. In Canberra, the Premier will hold talks with the<br />
Prime Minister and Ministers on a wide range of international and<br />
bilateral matters. The Premier's itinerary in New South Wales and Queensland<br />
will be developed in consultation with State Premiers.<br />
The Prime Minister has already discussed the itinerary with<br />
Mr Wran and Mr Bjelke Petersen and appreciates the cooperation that the<br />
will be extending during Premier Zhao ' s visit to New South Wales and<br />
Queensland. </p>
