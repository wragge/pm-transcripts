EMBARGO: AGAINST DELIVERY ( 8. l15PM)<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P. J. KEATING MP<br />
CEDA SYMPOSI4UM, MELBOURNE, 3 AUGUST 1992<br />
Ladies and Gentlemen, many of you here tonight will have<br />
heard me go through my paces as Treasurer many times.<br />
I can still do a passingly good imitation of a Treasurer<br />
when I'm asked.<br />
But these days I prefer to leave that thankless task to<br />
John Dawkins.<br />
Tonight I thought I might stand back a bit and outline<br />
what we see as great possibilities for Australia in the<br />
future. I want to talk about the philosophy_ of the Government,<br />
our ideas and priorities.<br />
I'm told there's a rumour going round that the government<br />
is run by fanatics, pointy-heads and zealots.<br />
Those who have observed us over the years as you have<br />
will know this is a long way from the truth.<br />
These people do exist, it is true but they are not our<br />
people. And, contrary to another related rumour, we have never<br />
been of the New Right view that the way to economic<br />
success is through a mixture of rationalisation and hope<br />
and only a hope that new competitive industries will<br />
miraculously rise to replace the old inefficient ones.<br />
We are wiser than that. We take the view that there is a<br />
role for government to clear the decks for business<br />
to create a market and sometimes where appropriate do<br />
business with business.<br />
We believe in competitiveness. It has been the linchpin,<br />
the guiding philosophy a'nd the one great goal since<br />
we came to office nearly a decade ago. And it remains so.<br />
You and we both know that an economically competitive<br />
Australia is the only Australia which can survive as a<br />
healthy social democracy into the twenty-first century. 955 </p>
<p>As a Labor Party whose primary commitment is always to a<br />
healthy social democracy, we have taken the business of<br />
competitiveness more seriously perhaps than the<br />
conservative parties were ever able to.<br />
Indeed it is an irony that it took a Labor Government to<br />
give Australia and open market economy.<br />
For us economic policy is the servant of a greater goal<br />
which is prosperous society, but, more than that, a fair<br />
and just society.<br />
I think that is why we took up the task of restructuring,<br />
renovating and radically reforming the<br />
Australian economy when the Opposition, over seven years,<br />
had failed to.<br />
For us, nothing we wanted to do could be done without it.<br />
We could not think of social reform without facing the<br />
fact of economic reform.<br />
You should remember that, I think as all Australians<br />
should: strange as it may have seemed at the time to both<br />
Labor and conservative observers, we grabbed the<br />
initiative on these changes for the same reason that<br />
Labor has alw~ ays grabbed the initiative they were<br />
necessary to realising our traditional ambitions for<br />
Australia. I say you should remember it because there is an<br />
immutable lesson there that is, if you want to see the<br />
necessary change in this country, Labor is your best, if<br />
not your only, bet.<br />
We have a much bigger incentive. Change is our reason for<br />
being. Change is our business.<br />
Our opponents might do a bit of this and a bit of thatthey<br />
will do some slashing and some burning and you can<br />
be fairly sure that they'll do a lot of hoping.<br />
But you can't be sure they'll follow through.<br />
And they won't take the country with them.<br />
What they will do is alienate a lot of people and a lot<br />
of important organisations.<br />
They'll raise the temperature of industrial relations,<br />
for instance.<br />
Some of you might not like trade unions.<br />
Some of you might not like environmentalists either.<br />
That I do not share that view is not the point.<br />
q 7,1 </p>
<p>The point is that, if you weigh the record, you'll see<br />
that it's better to come to terms with them, better to<br />
show a bit of subtlety, a bit of give and take, a bit of<br />
understanding, than to trigger guerilla warfare across<br />
the country.<br />
Not just a bit better fundamentally better, more<br />
profitable and productive.<br />
The consensus approach has accelerated reform, and not as<br />
our opponents assert, retarded it. Many of the things<br />
that have been achieved would never have been achieved by<br />
their confrontationist methods.<br />
The fundamental improvements in our industrial relations<br />
system. which have seen strikes reducd-to thir lowest'<br />
levelfor 30 years, wages at competitive levels, a decade<br />
of growth and now inflation reduced to an historic low,<br />
simply would not have been achieved by the policies of<br />
our opponents.<br />
Rancour is not a creative condition. We've got a lot of<br />
it out of the system out of the most important<br />
relationship in the economy, the workplace relationship.<br />
And, as you know, we're still pushing towards a more<br />
rational, effective and competitive workplace.<br />
To take just a couple of examples:<br />
in shiping, in the last three years crew sizes have<br />
fallen by a quarter, to equal the average crewing<br />
for OECD ships visiting Australia. As a result ship<br />
owners have spent nearly $ 2 billion on 28 new ships<br />
about a third of the fleet.<br />
on the waterfront, by October this year the<br />
stevedoring workforce will be half of what it was<br />
three years ago. Our reforms have doubled the<br />
number of containers handled per man.<br />
I said on the night we delivered the One Nation statement<br />
that our reforms to industrial relations have been the<br />
most constructive step we have taken in this country<br />
since the war: that a nation cannot be strong if at the<br />
very point where wealth is created the people are locked<br />
in conflict; that modern industry has to be a<br />
cooperative process.<br />
I say it again, in part to remind you of the government's<br />
philosophy and achievement, but more importantly to<br />
remind you of Augtralia'Ls achievement.<br />
I mean the degree of the change and it's a continuing<br />
change should not be underestimated. It should give<br />
all of us confidence. -957 </p>
<p>For there ha be remarkable change in Australia in the<br />
past ten years. Australians have recognised necessity<br />
and adapted. They've proved both their willingness and<br />
their capacity.<br />
I believe we should recognise this as an important<br />
factor in the nation's favour.<br />
At the same time I think we should recognise that there<br />
are costs~ for people in this process social and<br />
psychological costs and they must never be left out of<br />
the economic equation.<br />
That's why I say it's important to take the country with<br />
US. It's why I say that it is always a government's<br />
responsibility to play a role, and those who still argue<br />
that the market, unfettered and alone, should determine<br />
national outcomes do not understand good government, good<br />
economics or what is good for people.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen<br />
We take an eclectic view, not an ideological one.<br />
We have not gone willy-nilly into industry plans, but<br />
where we have thought it sensible to intervene we h~ ave<br />
intervened.<br />
Where we think our responsibility stops at getting the<br />
business and industrial environment right, we will stop<br />
there.<br />
Which leads me to another rumour presently doing the<br />
rounds. Don't believe this one either.<br />
If people ask what good the great reforms of the last<br />
decade have done, tell them heaps.<br />
When we opened up the Australian economy with a. floating<br />
dollar, open financial markets and and phased dbwn<br />
industry protection, we were aiming at making Australian<br />
industry more internationally competitive.<br />
And today it is.<br />
When we set out to replace conflict with cooperation in<br />
industrial relations, to restore profit share, encourage<br />
workplace bargaining, and dramatically reform the<br />
waterfront, aviation and telecommunications industries,<br />
we were determined to give our industries a chance.<br />
Today they have a chance.<br />
o~ o </p>
<p>When we put foreign policy to the service of Australia's<br />
trade, with thei-amal-ja-mat ion of the Foreign Af fairs and<br />
Trade departments, when we created Austrade and this year<br />
expanded it, took the initiative in tihe formation of the<br />
Cairns Group and APEC, we sought to integrate Australia<br />
with the fastest drowing economic region of the world.<br />
Today we are integrated as never before.<br />
Don't believe the claims that it hasn't worked.<br />
Both our service exports and our manufactured exports<br />
have tripled over the last decade.<br />
Last year, for the first time, we exported more<br />
manufactured products than rural products.<br />
A decade ago we imported more goods and services than we<br />
exported. Today we export more than we import.<br />
A decade ago we did not have a tourist industry<br />
deserving of the name. In the eighties it was our<br />
fastest growing industry. In the first four months of<br />
this year, foreign arrivals were nearly twenty per cent<br />
higher than in the first four months of last year.<br />
A decade ago, as we came out of recession, we had double<br />
digit inflation. Today we have entrenched our<br />
competitive advantage with one of the lowest inflation<br />
rates in the industrial world.<br />
I'm inclined to think this is not well enough known.<br />
I'd also venture that the fact that Australian<br />
manufacturing has grown by 10 per cent since we came to<br />
office is -not' well known.<br />
People who talk and write about Australian manufacturing<br />
as if it were without hope should look at the evidence.<br />
So should those who want to tear the place apart in<br />
search of what they think will be economic progress.<br />
Look more closely at the evidence. Look at the growth in<br />
Elaborately Transformed Manufactures, for instance.<br />
We're all aware there is still a lot more distance to be<br />
travelled, but it does not hurt to remind ourselves that<br />
we are on the right path and that we've already come a<br />
long way.<br />
Elaborately Transformed Manufactures, of course, are<br />
generally characterised by high levels of value adding.<br />
They include motor vehicles and motor vehicle parts,<br />
computers, scientific equipment, industrial machinery,<br />
telecommunications equipment. 959 </p>
<p>Australian exports of ETMs have recorded the fastest<br />
growth of any export category since 1981.<br />
Exports of minerals in that period increased by 104 per<br />
cent. Rural products increased by 38 per cent. ETMs<br />
increased by 211 per cent.<br />
In 1981 ETM exports were worth 2.1 billion dollars. Last<br />
year they were worth $ 10.1 billion.<br />
Motor vehicle exports increased from $ 20 million to S414<br />
million. Motor vehicle engines increased from $ 28 million to $ 351<br />
million. Office machines and computers increased from $ 19 million<br />
to $ 415 million.<br />
Telecommunications equipment increased from $ 27 million<br />
to $ 226 million.<br />
Industrial machinery increased from $ 235 million to $ 799<br />
million. Asia was the fastest growing market: between 1981-1988<br />
averiage annual growth rates of 30 per cent or more to'<br />
Korea, Taiwan Japan: between 1988-91 growth of 40 per<br />
cent or more to Thailand and Indonesia while maintaining<br />
strong rates of growth in the North Asian countries.<br />
That's to name a few.<br />
Significantly, ETMs have sustained their export<br />
performance through the recession: indeed, in most of the<br />
cases quoted, the greater part of the increase has been<br />
recorded in the last two or three years.<br />
The performance can be put down to a number of factors:<br />
our increased competitiveness is obviously one of them.<br />
The much more competitive environment which the opening<br />
of our economy has created has been complemented by the<br />
adoption of international best practices in many<br />
companies. Those who say there is no light on the horizon should<br />
look at Toyota in Melbourne, or Email in Orange,<br />
Henderson's Automotive in Adelaide, ICI at Yarwun in<br />
Queensland and more than 120 other companies whose<br />
radically overhauled workplace arrangements have been<br />
ratified by the Industrial Relations Commission and who<br />
are now enjoying improved productivity and<br />
competitiveness. 960 </p>
<p>Our increased concentration on Asian markets is plainly<br />
another reason for the improvement. That is where the<br />
greatest growth has been in North Asia, and in the last<br />
three years, in South-east Asia.<br />
And, while a few people are making a lot of noise about<br />
foreign investment in Australia there is no doubt that<br />
our export performance has benefited from the increased<br />
integration of Australian manufacturing into world<br />
productions processes which companies like Toyota, Ford,<br />
IBM, Mitsubishi and Erricson have brought to this<br />
country. As I said, we take the view that what is best left to the<br />
market place should be left to the market place but,<br />
equally, where government can play a role it should.<br />
It's not the simple position to take. It involves<br />
judgements difficult judgements which can prove both<br />
socially and politically costly.<br />
It's a position which requires skill and subtlety.<br />
To my mind it is simply part of a government's<br />
responsibility. But it is also logical.<br />
We could demonstrate the logic in any number of ways<br />
but one of them is that a sizeable part of the growth in<br />
exports of elaborately transformed manufactures is coming<br />
from areas of the economy and where the Government has<br />
shown an interest.<br />
We will continue to phase down tariffs which have<br />
rendered Australian industry so uncompetitive, but we<br />
will not leave good viable industries to fail for want of<br />
a fair chance.<br />
We believe Australia should have a sugar industry, so<br />
while we have reduced tariffs, there will be no further<br />
reductions without consultation with the industry.<br />
We believe in a motor vehicle industry, so we are<br />
reducing tariffs, but not to zero.<br />
And we believe in textile clothing and footwear<br />
industries, so we have established a Textile Clothing<br />
Development Agency to help the TCF industries make the<br />
adjustments which must be made if they are to have a<br />
future. For workforce and industry adjustments we have provided<br />
$ 250 million in assistance.<br />
Government action through the Parnerspfor Development<br />
Progran has played a subs tanti1al role 7in the g rowth of<br />
' the Computer industry whose exports alone have more<br />
than quadrupled in the last four years. 961 </p>
<p>It is estimated that the 21 participating companies in<br />
the Partnerships Programs will generate over 400 million<br />
dollars on Research and Development and produce exports<br />
worth b[ li-on by -1997.<br />
It's projected that the* Factor F _ Pro ram will have<br />
generated 1.13 billion diollars in pharmaceutical exports<br />
between 1988/ 89 and 1993\ 94. By 2000 it is expected<br />
that, through Factor F programs, exports will be in the<br />
vicinity of 2 billion dollars per year.<br />
Just two weeks ago my colleagues the Minister for<br />
Industry, Technology and Commerce, Senator Button, and<br />
the Minister for Industry and Commerce, Mr Crean,<br />
announced a $ 12.7 million 4 year program to encourage<br />
greater efficiencies in food production, more cooperation<br />
between producers, processors and marketers, and a<br />
sharper focus on international markets.<br />
This is a great country for food for growing it and<br />
processing it. All kinds of food.<br />
We can grow the kind of food that the people of Asia<br />
traditionally eat.<br />
We can also grow food that, as the region changes, the<br />
people of Asia will increasingly eat.<br />
Food processing is an industry with enormous potential<br />
for Australia 7 billion dollars' worth, we estimate, by<br />
the end of the decade.<br />
Without doubt, there are more industrial opportunities<br />
in the construction industry for instance. And in the<br />
tourism and finance industries.<br />
We are looking for others.<br />
We want the Industry Commission to find the impediments<br />
to industries * which should be doing better than they are.<br />
We are getting moving on those programs for<br />
infrastructure development we announced in One Nation.<br />
The 2 billion dollar road works which are about to begin.<br />
The beginnings of construction of the national rail<br />
highway. If you want to understand our philosophy One Nation is<br />
the place to look.<br />
You will see there, beside the great capital works which<br />
will serve industry well into the next century, programs<br />
and initiatives designed to further improve the<br />
environment for free enterprise<br />
-accelerated depreciation<br />
9 G2 </p>
<p>the development allowance<br />
special arrangements to encourage private sector<br />
participation in infrastructure developments<br />
All of which have given us a business tax system<br />
competitive with the best in the OECD.<br />
You will also see in One Nation a commitment to training,<br />
and the reform of the training system, which just a<br />
fortnight ago was realised in the creation of the<br />
Australian National Training Authority and the Young<br />
Australians Plan for Employment and Training.<br />
We haven't stopped with One Nation. Ninety two years<br />
after Federation, in March next year we will create a<br />
national market for goods and occupations under an<br />
agreement in which all the States and the Federal<br />
government recognise each others standards and<br />
regulations.<br />
After March 1993, if it can be sold in one state it can<br />
be sold in any other. If your occupation is recognised<br />
in one state it will be recognised in all states.<br />
All these programs are aimed at building a successful<br />
industrial nation for the twenty first century.<br />
It is for that reason that we are prepared to support<br />
industries with a future.<br />
It is for the same reason, of course, that we have<br />
introduced the Superannuation Guarantee Charge we will<br />
need savings.<br />
They will give ordinary Australians a chance. They will<br />
give business a chance and Australia a chance.<br />
It is necessary change as necessary as those changes we<br />
made to internationalise and open up the economy in the<br />
1980s. And as necessary to our ambitions for a great<br />
Australian social democracy.<br />
I said earlier that there were costs associated with the<br />
radical changes Australia has undergone in the last<br />
decade. I believe good government demands that we take account of<br />
them. While most of the current high level of unemployment is<br />
due to the downturn in the economy some is a consequence<br />
of restructuring.<br />
But we cannot cry success while we have such high levels<br />
of unemplomment. 963 </p>
<p>In the coming budget we will be doing what we can to<br />
create jo; bs, extend the reach of training and retraining,<br />
and soften the blow for those who have dropped<br />
out of the work-force.<br />
We will do everything we can to attack unemployment.<br />
But we do not believe that an assault on the living<br />
standards and security of those in work constitutes a<br />
sensible or proper approach.<br />
We don't believe this any more than we believe that an<br />
inflationar-y consumption tax, cutting award wages, or a<br />
return to an adversarial industrial relations culture,<br />
constitutes a useful approach to unemployment.<br />
We don't think that a policy of putting up prices through<br />
a consumption tax and cutting wages is the answer to our<br />
problems. I don't think untrained men or women whose jobs have<br />
disappeared should alone bear the burden of structural<br />
change or the burden of recession.<br />
I think the nation should share it.<br />
If we all want our industries to be efficient, and we all<br />
know that this means jobs will be shed, then we all have'<br />
a responsibility to the unemployed and their families.<br />
Caring for them is as much a part of the process of restructuring<br />
as anything else we have done.<br />
We saw at the meeting on youth unemployment how willing<br />
Australians are to take on this sort of responsibility<br />
Australian trade unions, governments, communities, and<br />
business. But of course everything we do to ease the pain ot:<br />
unemployment, every effort we make to reverse the trend,<br />
must occur within the context of economic growth.<br />
And it seems to me that here again we need a national<br />
effort. We need it from those same groups who were so<br />
enthusiastically represented at the meeting on youth.<br />
We need leadership, ideas and commitment from the private<br />
sector. We have the lowest interest rates and the lowest<br />
inflation in a generation.<br />
We have radically transformed the taxation sys tem, added<br />
incentives and removed impediments to busiiness.<br />
964 </p>
<p>We have the fastest growing economic region in the world<br />
at our doorstep.<br />
With our vast natural resources, our climate and<br />
environment, our standards of education, our experience,<br />
our incentive surely we can find a profitiable future<br />
in the region.<br />
Last week I was in Queensland.<br />
In Innisfail I visited the Northern Iron and Brass<br />
Foundry. Not a big plant, but expertly managed, clear<br />
goals, very keen on training I presented a dozen or<br />
more awards to their apprentices. They supply local<br />
industry and they export to Asia and the Pacific.<br />
I went to the South Johnstone Sugar Mill. Expertly<br />
managed, the right technology, clear goals, keen on<br />
training. They're exporting.<br />
I went to Townsville and officially launched the harbour<br />
devlopment there funded by One Nation. It's a harbour<br />
for exporting.<br />
I went to Gladstone where nearly 20 million tonnes of<br />
coal was exported last year 60 per cent of it to Asia.<br />
And, among other things, nearly 180,000 tonnnes of<br />
aluminium all of it to Asia.<br />
I went to Yarwun nearby, where ICI have built a chemical<br />
plant to supply local industry state of the art in both<br />
technology and management.<br />
Gladstone was a town of 6000 people a few years ago.<br />
It's now 23,000. It's built on exporting. It's future<br />
is substantially Asia.<br />
Recently I read of how a decade ago Australian winemakers<br />
had made a thorough re-assessment of their industry a<br />
" technological re-assessment". They knew they had a good<br />
product. They knew that Australia had a future in wine.<br />
They now have expertise second to none in the world.<br />
They're growing the right grapes, making the right wines.<br />
And they're exporting. In May they sold as much wine<br />
overseas as they sold in twelve months a few years ago.<br />
Last year they sold 100 million bottles, for S234 million<br />
in income. With the export drive they plan they expect to<br />
raise that figure to Sl billion.<br />
And every time they sell a bottle of course they do more<br />
than earn income they project the name Australia in the<br />
world, as a country which makes things. Very good<br />
things. 9 </p>
<p>As taste changes in Asia the winemakers can expect to<br />
increase sales there.<br />
Today's announcement by Cadburiy that they will be<br />
investing $ 28 million in Tasmania makes the point.<br />
They're investing the money because the M~ arket for<br />
chocolate is growing in Asia.<br />
These seem to me to offer glimpses of Australia's future<br />
string them together for a moment and you see a clear<br />
horizon. In each of these recent cases the common threads appear<br />
there has been earnest investment in the right products,<br />
technology, the right management, the right training, the<br />
right marketing.<br />
The truth is, if we invest in what we have here, if we<br />
invest in ourselves, there can be no doubt about the<br />
future of Australia.<br />
There are very good reasons why business should now<br />
respond. Very good reasons in particular why the bankseven<br />
allowing for the burns they received in the boomshould<br />
now be lending.<br />
You can be sure we will go on looking for ways to<br />
encourage the growth we need.<br />
Where we can remove obstacles we will remove them.<br />
In the last few months we have managed to make some break<br />
throughs in things like aviation, pay television, and<br />
technical and vocational training.<br />
Where we can, we are prepared to break through log jams<br />
in industrial development.<br />
And where we can inspire or engineer a national effort<br />
such as that which emerged from the meeting on youth we<br />
will also do this.<br />
Because it has become increasingly clear to me i. n-the<br />
past few months there are vital intangibles in this<br />
recovery, which go under such names as spirit, and hope<br />
and purpose.<br />
As modern business people you will understand their<br />
importance.<br />
As Australians I believe you will want to join the<br />
Government in attempting to deliver them to the nation. </p>
