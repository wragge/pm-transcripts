<p>I was so sad to learn this evening that Hazel Hawke has died.</p>
<p>Ordinary Australians saw the best of themselves in Hazel  -  many women of her generation will feel they have lost a friend.</p>
<p>Hazel was one of those rare people who are liked and respected in equal measure.  Her warmth and generosity of spirit in success were only matched by her courage and dignity in adversity.</p>
<p>Bob Hawke's public achievements in the union movement and in Government are unthinkable without Hazel's steadfast support.    </p>
<p>After her diagnosis with Alzheimer's disease, Hazel's life of service to Australia continued in ever more trying circumstances.</p>
<p>We have lost a wonderful Australian.</p>
<p>In coming days the Government will discuss with her family an appropriate way to recognise Hazel's contribution to public life. </p>
