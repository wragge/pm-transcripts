STATES GRANTS ( RESEARCH) BILL 1965<br />
SECOND READING SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTE~ R, THE RIGHT HONPURABLE<br />
SIR ROBERT MENZIES, Q_,<br />
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, 12TH NOVEMBER, 1965<br />
The purpose of this Bill is to establish machinery which<br />
will enable grants to be made to the States for the benefit of<br />
individual research projects of particular merit. Under the<br />
authority of this measure the responsible Minister will have power<br />
to approve Commonwealth grants to selected research workers in the<br />
States, within the limits of the amounts of money appropriated by<br />
the Parliament from time to time.<br />
The Australian Government believes that in order to obtain<br />
the best possible use of the funds which it, and where appropriate<br />
the State Governments also, will provide for scientific research,<br />
grants should be made for the direct benefit of selected research<br />
activities which are-judged most likely to make a significant<br />
contribution to the advancement of science and of scientific<br />
knowledge in Australia. These special research grants will be<br />
available to research workers in the universities and other<br />
institutions, but not to those employed by government authorities.<br />
However, the adoption of this method does not mean that other forms<br />
of research will no longer receive Government support. For instance,<br />
the Australian Universities Commission will be fre~ e to provide for<br />
the needs of research in the sense of the training of postgraduate<br />
students within its general recommendations for the support of the<br />
universities. To decide which research project should be supported is<br />
clearly a difficult task and one requiring expert knowledge.<br />
Therefore, we established the Australian Research Grants Committee<br />
under the Chairmanship of Professor R. N. Robertson to receive<br />
applications, assess their relative merits, and select the most<br />
worthy projects. The Committee, which comprises distinguished<br />
representatives of the major fields of learning, has considered a<br />
large number of applications and has recommended research grants in<br />
various branches of science and learning, including in the humanities<br />
and the social sciences.<br />
Within the limit of the total sum of Å 2million nominated<br />
for it, the Committee has recommended grants during 1965 and the<br />
whole of 1966 to a total value of Å 1,848,875 of which the<br />
Commonwealth will pay Å 932,214, assuming that each State provides<br />
half of the amounts recommended for research workers in the<br />
universities in that State. The distribution of these grants among<br />
research workers in the various States is set out in a table which,<br />
with the concurrence of Honourable Members, I will have incorporated<br />
in Hansard. My colleague the Minister in Charge of Commonwealth<br />
Activities in Education and Research has released the details of the<br />
Committee's recommendations and has ahnounced that the Australian<br />
Government accepts these recommendations. A statement setting out<br />
the details has been distributed to Honourable Members.<br />
The sum of k2million which was nominated for the Australian<br />
Research Grants Committee, is the balance of a sum of Å Smillion which<br />
the Australian Universities Commission in its Second Report recommended<br />
should be provided by the Commonwealth and the States for research in<br />
State universities during the 1964-1966 triennium. By agreement the<br />
Commonwealth and the States are providing the other Å 3million for<br />
general research training purposes during the triennium. </p>
<p>On this occasion almost all of the grants recommended are<br />
for the benefit of research workers in State universities and the<br />
Commonwealth stands ready to meet half the cost of such grants.<br />
It is, of course, the prerogative of each State Government to decide<br />
whether and, if so, to what extent, it will join with the Commonwealth<br />
in matching the grants. While the States have known for some time<br />
about this programme of support for special research projects and of<br />
its financial implications, they could not know until the Australian<br />
Research Grants Committee had framed its recommendations what the<br />
financial commitment of each State would, in fact, be.<br />
I am pleased to inform the House that the Governments of<br />
five States have agreed to support the Committee's recommendations<br />
in full. The Government of New South Wales is still considering its<br />
position. This Bill gives general authority for the payment of special<br />
research grants to research workers in the States who will be selected<br />
under the procedures I have outlined. The Appropriation Bill ( No. 2)<br />
1965/ 66 includes provision under Division No. 945.1 for the estimated<br />
expenditure of Å 750,000 during the current financial year, on the<br />
first series of special research grants.<br />
I commend the Bill to the House. </p>
