PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 6 March 1984<br />
I have now seen transcripts both of what the Attorney-<br />
General said on Radio 2GB early this morning and of his<br />
personal explanation in Parliament today.<br />
Senator Evans was not in any way intending to attribute<br />
direct or indirect responsibility to the Opposition for<br />
the outrageous bombing of Justice Gee's home.<br />
Indeed, because he was aware that remarks about the dangers<br />
involved in creating a climate of opinion hostile to the<br />
judiciary might be misconstrued as an unfair attack on the<br />
Opposition, he in fact, as I understand, specifically made<br />
the point to the ALP Caucus meeting this morning that any<br />
such remarks in answer to Parliamentary questions would be<br />
inappropriate.<br />
We will not allow any misconstruction of Senator Evans'<br />
statement to divert attention from the totally unprincipled<br />
behaviour of the Opposition in relation to the whole tapes<br />
issue. </p>
