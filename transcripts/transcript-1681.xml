DEATH OF LORD ATTLEE<br />
Tribute from the Prime Minister, Mr Harold Holt<br />
Lord Attlee had an honoured place in modern history.<br />
He was a political leader whose statesmanship rose above any partisan<br />
allegiance. Practical common sense and wisdom established him<br />
firmly as a leader of the British Labor Party at a cr4tical period of his<br />
nation's history. His wartime co-operation in the Coalition Government<br />
enabled a concentrated national support for the nation's policies, not only<br />
in defence of Britain, but in the cause of freedom throughout the world.<br />
He will be widely mourned as he was widely respected.<br />
