PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 19 May 1985<br />
LOCAL GOVERNMENT INITIATIVE GRANTS<br />
The Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Bicentenary,<br />
Mr Barry Cohen, MP today announced a $ 17.5 million grants program<br />
aimed at helping local government authorities around Australia to<br />
undertake Bicentennial activities in 1988.<br />
Mr. Cohen said that under the Local Government Initiative Grants<br />
Program each local government authority in Australia would be<br />
eligible for a grant of $ 2,000 plus $ 1 per head of population in<br />
the area. Local government authorities would be required to<br />
match the grants on a dollar for dollar basis.<br />
Provision had also been made for unincorporated areas such as the<br />
Australian Capital Territory, Australian Island Territories and<br />
certain areas in the Northern Territory.<br />
" The Program is an example of the efforts being made by the<br />
Commonwealth Government and the Australian Bicentennial Authority<br />
to ensure that communities throughout Australia will be able to<br />
participate in the celebrations", Mr Cohen said.<br />
" It is important that the celebrations in 1988 involve all<br />
Australians and these grants provide an excellent incentive for<br />
such involvement."<br />
The Minister said the grants could be used to finance a -aide<br />
range of Bicentennial activities from capital projects to<br />
activities of a more celebratory nature.<br />
He said proposals nominated for funding should be of benefit. and<br />
significance to. a broad cross section of the community. They<br />
should be relevant to the Bicentenary and be carried out or:<br />
completed in 1988.<br />
Authorities could direct their resources into regional projects<br />
if they agreed to combine all or part of their grants.<br />
Mr Cohen said it was a condition of the scheme that local<br />
government authorities select Bicentennial activities in<br />
association with local Bicentennial Community Committees.<br />
Already, more than 400 of these Committees had been established.<br />
Mr Cohen said the Chairman of the Australian Bicentennial<br />
Authority, Mr John Reid, AO would be writing to each local<br />
* government authority to give details of the program.<br />
The closing date for funding applications will be January 1986. </p>
