FOR PRESS: 65/ 127<br />
P. M. No. 76/ 1966<br />
COMMONWEALTH AID FOR COMSERS OF MUSIC<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister, Mr. Harold Holt<br />
For some time it has been suggested from various<br />
quarters that the Commonwealth Government give financial support<br />
designed to encourage the development of Australian music.<br />
From time to time the Government has examined the<br />
question, but decided against taking any action, largely because<br />
young musicians and composers are able to benefit from the<br />
Commonwealth University Scholarship Scheme, and because<br />
considerable help is given to musia through the activities of<br />
the Australian Broadcasting Commission.<br />
The Commonwealth Government has now decided to<br />
provide assistance to enable Australian composers to make their<br />
works known. This is an important type of aid not previously<br />
covered by any form of financial assistance from the Commonwealth<br />
Government. Each year a sum of money, initially $ 10,000, will<br />
be made available for the purpose of having composers' * riginl zamical<br />
scores copied or printed in numbers sufficient for them to be<br />
played by orchestras, and to have these scores played by orchestras<br />
and recorded on tape for audition purposes, but not for commercial<br />
use. Arrangements for the administration of this aid<br />
have yet to be decided, but they will be made known as soon as<br />
possible. CANBERRA, August, 1966. </p>
