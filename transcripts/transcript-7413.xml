    <content><![CDATA[<p>C0<br />PRIME MINISTER<br />CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY<br />SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />1988 BICENTENNIAL EXPORT AWARDS<br />BRISBANE 15 OCTOBER 1988<br />Let me at the outset, on behalf of everyone here tonight,<br />congratulate the organisers of the Bicentennial Export<br />Awards. This occasion is important not only because it recognise.<br />the achievements of successful Australian exporters, but<br />also because it reinforces in the minds of all Australians<br />the need to strive to make our economy a more active and<br />competitive international player.<br />AS all here will fully'appreciate, Australia has<br />traditionally relied on exports of minerals and agricultural<br />goods to maintain its standard of living.<br />tFoo r cognrtoiwntuhe , i nw el imvuisntg csotnatnidnaured s doawnnd tehmep lopaytmhe nto f oprpeosrttruuncittuireisnag<br />our economy by broadening our export base.<br />The need for a major economic restructuring became starkly<br />evident with the collapse in world commodity prices in<br />1985/ 86. That slump not only demonstrated Australia's<br />vulnerability to sharp movements in commodity prices, it<br />revealed how ill-prepared Australian manufacturing and<br />service industries were to take advantage of the<br />depreciation of the Australian currency. This inflexibility<br />Was due to the highly protective tariff barriers that had<br />sheltered manufacturing industry and inefficiencies in<br />public and private sector service activities that-had long<br />gone unchallenged.<br />Action across the spectrum of Government policy and changes<br />in attitude by Australians generally have been required. it<br />is with great pride that I am able to say that we have<br />provided such action and, as I announced only this week, we<br />1 are determined to continue the work.<br />We have encouraged manufacturers to face the challenges and<br />opportunities of interna tional competition by gradually<br />reducing barrier protection. The tariff reductions<br />announced in the may Economic Statement will result in the<br />greatest reduction in domestic trade barriers since the<br />per cent across-the-board reduction in 1973. 267.9<br />Land<br />craf t<br />-1 the<br />PIRB those<br />-inday<br />ce in</p>
<p>He Gayi<br />We have also undertaken the most comprehensive reform of the ext<br />micro-economy attempted by an Australian Government in 40 mak<br />years. we are moving to eliminate inefficiencies and to<br />improve competitiveness because through such reforms liesTh<br />the promise of improved prosperity for all Australians. be<br />AS part of this process the Government has introduced mill<br />significant reforms in the domestic aviation and liner abtt<br />shipping sectors. AS well as those, there have been the coo<br />reforms in the primary industry and telecommunications ni c<br />sectors, and in Government business enterprises. We<br />Of particular interest and concern to you as exporters is ele'<br />reform of the waterfront, reform that is necessary to make par<br />Australia truly competitive and export oriented. abo<br />I would like tonight briefly to recount what I said on this i<br />subject to the Business Council of Australia. corn<br />From the Commonwealth's perspective, there are two basicin<br />areas which must be addressed. we need an appropriate<br />incentive structure and competition amongst stevedoring<br />companies to encourage a greater level of productivity. And<br />we need a positive attitude from port authorities, both in<br />reducing the costs they impose on exporters and importers,<br />and in encouraging a competitive use of port infrastructure.<br />Port authorities are the principal Government bodies on the<br />waterfront. While there have, very recently, been<br />significant statements by port authorities on the need'for<br />them to encourage greater competition on th'e waterfront,.<br />there have been few specific initiatives.<br />State Governments need to ensure that the ports do not' it<br />burden users with outdated work practices, nor charge for AwF<br />costs which are unjustifiable. clc<br />The Commonwealth's recent reforms to its own business shF<br />enterprises provide a lead. set<br />In a further move to reduce the overall regulatory burden on<br />business, I announced that the Government had dec idad to<br />adopt a requests and response procedure to review existing<br />regulation.<br />our overall policy approach has received widespread support. As;<br />For example, during a visit to Australia in may this year, exI<br />the Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund, Mr mat<br />Michel Camdessus, stated: As;<br />think the world has a good deal to learn from what o<br />is taking place in Australia now." Thi<br />He went on to state that: th: Au:<br />Ido admire the way in which the economic strategy ont<br />has been conceived and implemented." h<br />2676</p>
<p>He made particular mention of the Accord between the<br />Government and the trade union movement as having added an<br />extra dimension to the traditional tools of economic policy<br />making. The constructive attitudes which underpin the Accord have<br />been directly responsible for the creation of more than 1.1<br />million jobs since 1983. They have also been replicated in<br />a broader, economy-wide sense and this expansion of the<br />cooperative spirit has greatly facilitated reform of the<br />micro-economy.<br />We place heavy emphasis on consultation as an integral<br />element of reform as a means of ensuring that those<br />parties affected by reform are involved in it, and informed<br />about it.<br />It is encouraging to note the commitment with which<br />companies are meeting the economic challenges of an<br />increasingly deregulated environment:<br />The c-ntribution of manufacturing and services ( notably<br />tourism) to export earnings has increased<br />manufactured exports as a percentage of total<br />exports have increased from 21 per cent in 1984-85<br />: to more than 26 per cent in 1987-88<br />-Over the sa;.. e period, tourism earnings increased<br />from 4 per cent to 6 per cent of goods and services<br />exports.<br />It is also qratifying to note that these Bicentennial Export<br />Awards attracted a record number of applicants.<br />Clearly Australia has the potential to capture a larger<br />share of the international market for its manufactures and<br />services It can boast a stable political environment, an<br />abundance of raw materials, a skilled workforce, well<br />developed infrastructure and proximity to the fastest<br />growing region in the world.<br />Asia is becoming ever more important as a market for our<br />exports. Already half of our exports are sold to Asian<br />markets. It has often been said that our future lies in<br />Asia. How, when we consider that the most dynamic economies<br />on earth are just to our north, can it be otherwise?<br />That is why I told the Asian Studies Association in February<br />this year that it was no exaggeration to say that as<br />Australia enters its third century of European settlement,<br />one of the most important and testing challenges we face is<br />the challenge of finding our true place in Asia. 2677</p>
<p>Australians should recognise that our self-interest lies in<br />our becoming an integral part of the region, a full<br />participant in regionalefforts towards peace and security<br />and an economic partner co-ordinating our skills and<br />specialisations with those of Asia to the consequent<br />prosperity of all.<br />Asia will continue to demand substantial supplies of our<br />primary commodities for decades to come.<br />But, in addition, as the wealth of Asia increases and as the<br />exchange rate pressures of industrial success begin to force<br />the most rapidly growing exporters to restructure, Asia will<br />also increasingly demand processed raw materials,<br />manufactures and services.<br />Unfortunately there are certain factors which have inhibited<br />our trade performance in Asia.<br />Research has shown that Australian companies enter export<br />markets in a typical sequence, starting with New Zealand and<br />the South Pacific, proceeding to the West Coast of the USA<br />and then trying the UK. They are less interested in the<br />markets of Asia, despite their high growth rates and<br />geographical proximity.<br />A major factor in this relative lack of interest in Asia is<br />that Australian business people, in general, feel less<br />comfortable in Asian cultures than in countries where<br />English is the natural language and familiar business<br />practices are followed.<br />This year's Export Award applicants reinforce the point:<br />finalists were much more likely to employ people proficient<br />in languages than were non-finalists.<br />Sensitivity to other cultures will also be a key to<br />Australia's ability to compete successfully in Asia. We<br />need to look beyond the imaginary and irrelevant differences<br />between people in order to understand and respect the real<br />differences which together make up the rich fabric of<br />humanity.<br />Again, this year's Export Award applicants confirm the<br />point. Finalists spent twice as much time visiting their<br />overseas customers as did non-finalists. And more effort<br />went into visiting customers in regions such as the Middle<br />East and Asia whose cultures are significantly different<br />from Australia's.<br />Finally, I would like to congratulate all of the 1988<br />Bicentennial Export Awards applicants. Their determination<br />and commitment need to be emulated by companies throughout<br />our manufacturing and service industries if Australia is to<br />secure a more prosperous future.<br />2678</p>
