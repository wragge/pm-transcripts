EMBARGO: 9<br />
FOR MEDIA TUESDAY, OCTOBER 12 1982<br />
OPENING OF AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL GALLERY<br />
It seems only a short while, Your Majesty, since you were<br />
here with us opening the High Court, the companion building<br />
of this National Gallery. I hope you will take pleasure in<br />
what you will find and see here.<br />
I would like to thank the Council of the Gallery, its<br />
present and its former Chairmanfor the work they have<br />
done preparing for this day.<br />
It was the Government of Sir Robert Menzies, in 1965, that<br />
made the decision to establish a national gallery and<br />
significant purchasing of works of art for this occasion<br />
began in 1969 when substantial funds were first set aside<br />
to acquire a national collection.<br />
This is a collection now of very considerable value.<br />
Sir Darryl Lindsay and Sir William Dargie were particularly<br />
important in making it possible to build up a first-class<br />
national collection. I would like to pay a special tribute<br />
to James Mollison, present Director of the Gallery who has<br />
devoted 13 years of his life to this moment.<br />
I was able to have a quick preview of the collection not<br />
long ago. I believe he should be complimented on the way<br />
the collection has been put together and prepared for<br />
public presentation. The acquisitions of this Gallery will<br />
enable visitors to see major significant works of art of<br />
all the major important periodsJ from nearly every<br />
. significant school and from every continent.<br />
Australia is represented in all those periods. That in<br />
a very real way will allow us to see ourselves, to judge<br />
ourselves against the perspective of the background of<br />
the wider world. My sister reminds me on those rare occasions<br />
when we meet, that art is truly international and for its<br />
purpose national boundaries do not really exist. The way<br />
this collection has been put together demonstrates that<br />
that is so. ./ 2 </p>

Turning to the building itself, I think everyone will<br />
agree that its entrance is imposing. Some may judge that<br />
from certain angles, it is not the most beautiful building<br />
in the world, but when the trees already planted around it<br />
grow, the lines of the concrete will soften.<br />
It also needs to be understood that this Gallery has been<br />
designed and built for a particular purpose. It has been<br />
designed to enable works of art many of which have a<br />
degree of fragility to be housed in special conditions.<br />
It has been designed to allow works of art to be stored,<br />
exhibited and protected in an environment that will enable<br />
them to be seen by all Australians, and by overseas visitors,<br />
for generations to come.<br />
I would also like to make the point, Your Majesty, that<br />
this building has been designed so that disabled people<br />
in wheelchairs are able to enjoy the building and to share<br />
the value of this collection with other Australians. Further<br />
measures are being taken to improve still further the<br />
facilities for the disabled.<br />
I believe that the architects should be complimented that<br />
the designers, the builders and everyone who has played a<br />
part in the creation of this Gallery should be complimented<br />
for what they have achieved. This is a young gallery, but<br />
it is undoubtedly going to become one of the great galleries<br />
in the world.<br />
It would be invidious for me to mention particular artists<br />
but I am going to make one exception. I thinkwe all greatly<br />
regret that Fred Williams is not with us today. For 10 years<br />
he had been a member of the National Gallery Council.<br />
Fred Williams was one of the few Australians to have exhibited<br />
in the Museum of Modern Art in New York indeed, he had a<br />
solo exhibition there and he exhibited in most of the<br />
world's major art centres, including a further solo exhibition<br />
in Paris. That he died a few months before this opening is<br />
a matter of great regret, but it is a great pleasure to have<br />
here his wife and three daughters.<br />
I have been asked by the Gallery Council to announce tonight<br />
that three galleries are to be named after Australian<br />
artists in recognitionof their outstanding service to the<br />
Gallery. One is to be named after Fred Williams, one after<br />
Sir William Dargie, and one after Sir Darryl Lindsay.<br />
Your Majesty, Australia is now starting to cast her eyes ahead<br />
to 1988 when the Australian Bicentennial is to be celebrated.<br />
Much planning is going into the events of that year. This<br />
Gallery will then be 5 years old. Its activities will be an<br />
important part and it will obviously have a significant role<br />
to play in celebrating the Bicentennial., / 2 </p>

There is a continuing need for the national collection to<br />
be further enhanced. The Gallery Council is now charged<br />
with the responsibility of securing corporate and individual<br />
donations from all sections of the community to add to the<br />
collection. I don't know if they have got a collector around<br />
the corner, but I am sure arrangements could be made.<br />
The Government, for its part, is announcing a $ 27 million<br />
contribution to the Gallery purchases over the next 5 years<br />
to be known as the Bicentennial Collection. I hope the<br />
corporate and private sectors will follow our example to<br />
enable this great Gallery to build upon its present<br />
achievements. </p>
