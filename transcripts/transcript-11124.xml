    <content><![CDATA[<p>E&amp;OE................................................................................................</p>
<p>Can I just say that the devastation that has been caused here, of</p>
<p> course, has produced a great wave of concern and sympathy all around</p>
<p> Australia and the vivid television images of the utter devastation</p>
<p> to the community certainly has had an impact on all Australians. And</p>
<p> I want to say first and foremost how much I know the Premier and I</p>
<p> certainly join him and admire the work of the State emergency services.</p>
<p>The miracle of Exmouth is that nobody lost their life and nobody was</p>
<p> injured. Now, that is an incredible achievement and that has been</p>
<p> in no small measure due to the work of the State emergency services</p>
<p> who have warned people effectively in advance of what should be done.</p>
<p> And I think once again that great volunteer Australian spirit has</p>
<p> come to the fore and people have prepared themselves and as a result</p>
<p> we have minimised physical and personal damage. But the property devastation</p>
<p> is extensive. Now, as I think you all know there are a number of arrangements</p>
<p> that are in place between the Commonwealth and States whereby the</p>
<p> two governments share the cost of disaster relief and those arrangements</p>
<p> apply naturally in the case of this event.</p>
<p>But over and above that, the Premier and I have agreed on several</p>
<p> measures. The first is that we are going to establish a $10 million</p>
<p> trust fund which will be jointly contributed to by the two governments</p>
<p> of $5 million each which will provide general relief, business assistance</p>
<p> and generally to get started the process of community reconstruction.</p>
<p> And over and above that, the Commonwealth on an ex-gratis basis will</p>
<p> make available to every family whose home was destroyed or severely</p>
<p> damaged an amount of $1,000 and plus $200 for each child. Now, this</p>
<p> is an ex-gratis arrangement which was applied in relation to the floods</p>
<p> in Katherine.</p>
<p>We will continue to talk to the Western Australian Government. It</p>
<p> will be some weeks before the full extent of the cost of repairing</p>
<p> infrastructure will be known and obviously we will keep in touch.</p>
<p> But on occasions like this it is necessary for governments to promptly</p>
<p> come to the assistance. There are standing arrangements and what I</p>
<p> have announced today is over and above those standing arrangements.</p>
<p>But can I again say to the people of Exmouth and the surrounding districts</p>
<p> that the events of the past few days have certainly not left you neglected</p>
<p> by the rest of your other fellow Australians and we certainly feel</p>
<p> for you and want to help you. The community spirit is strong but as</p>
<p> the process of reconstruction gathers pace inevitably there will be</p>
<p> difficulties and we want to be there to help.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Can you just say what those standing arrangements are?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Oh yes, well under those standing arrangements where it's necessary</p>
<p> for the State's Family and Community Services Department to provide</p>
<p> cash and emergency assistance once it gets over, I think, $200,000</p>
<p> the Commonwealth picks up half the cost and the State the other half.</p>
<p> And once it goes a bit higher then a further percentage is picked</p>
<p> up and then in addition to that there are some standing arrangements</p>
<p> in relation to infrastructure. But I think it is necessary for the</p>
<p> State....for the cost of the infrastructure renewal to pass $16</p>
<p> million before the Commonwealth makes a contribution. And that's</p>
<p> one of the reasons why we are saying now we will put $5 million in</p>
<p> and $5 million from Western Australia so that immediately there is</p>
<p> a joint trust fund available. And we'll keep in touch with the</p>
<p> Western Australian Government. I can just assure the people that they</p>
<p> won't be left alone, they won't be left to fend for themselves.</p>
<p> Obviously there are private insurance arrangements but on occasions</p>
<p> like this it is the responsibility of both governments to help people,</p>
<p> to help people repair their life, to help people get back on their</p>
<p> feet, to help businesses get going. Nobody can guard against acts</p>
<p> of God and you have just got to help people. And we won't be</p>
<p> cheese paring about it, the State Government's not cheese paring</p>
<p> about it and we just want to make sure that this community which has</p>
<p> shown some tremendous stout, good stout courage gets back on its feet</p>
<p> as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>You have had a look around how do the locals appear to be coping with</p>
<p> the....</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, very well. They're in tremendous spirits and Australians</p>
<p> are like that. They struggle with adversity very well. They get about</p>
<p> fixing things up, they preserve their sense of humour even though</p>
<p> things are difficult and that great Australian spirit came through</p>
<p> once again. And can I say that I am very pleased that Mr Beazley,</p>
<p> the leader of the Opposition, was able to come with me. On occasions</p>
<p> like this, politics is swept aside and it's a question of us</p>
<p> all digging in and helping.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, what did you think of the damage?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Oh, I was amazed and absolutely incredulous that nobody was hurt.</p>
<p> I mean, nobody lost their life and I just can't believe watching</p>
<p> the extent to which houses are just completely destroyed and twisted</p>
<p> and trees uprooted and the devastation of walking through a couple</p>
<p> of those homes and watching the unmitigated mess and then the heartbreaking</p>
<p> side of those, I am just amazed that nobody was hurt. I think it is</p>
<p> just a miracle. I can't describe it any other way and the emergency</p>
<p> services...and can I also thank the Royal Australian Air Force.</p>
<p> The Hercules have been transporting people to and from the district.</p>
<p> They have been bringing in generators, they have been helping with</p>
<p> fresh water and the way in which all of the emergency services have</p>
<p> responded and the way in which people just work together. I mean,</p>
<p> we are very good at that, working together in adversity and it brings</p>
<p> out the best in the Australian spirit.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, have you got any special thoughts for pastoralists</p>
<p> that have been completely wiped out with this cyclone?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I have got thoughts for everybody who has been affected and</p>
<p> I want to make certain that the people who are most in need of immediate</p>
<p> assistance get it and that is why I have announced these additional</p>
<p> arrangements and we'll keep them under review. And if any anomalies</p>
<p> emerge we'll have a look at them.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Do you have any message for insurance companies for people making</p>
<p> claims that might not have fully prepared for this?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, be generous. Obviously people are entitled to their legal rights</p>
<p> on both sides of it but this is a disaster, it requires generosity.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>It requires generosity so is an increase possible....</p>
<p>RICHARD COURT:</p>
<p>Can I just make a comment, sorry, in relation to the pastoral properties.</p>
<p> I didn't have time to fully brief the Prime Minister but we have</p>
<p> now had a...lost everything, they have lost their homes, their</p>
<p> shearing sheds, some of them are about to do shearing and they simply</p>
<p> don't have the facilities to do it. So.....</p>
<p>[Interruption]</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>....you won't be left alone, we'll help you. You deserve</p>
<p> help and you'll get it.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Just a quick question, a quick reaction to the developments in Europe,</p>
<p> to the bombing of Kosovo.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, obviously any use of force of this type is something that countries</p>
<p> only do so reluctantly. But NATO had no alternative. They had persevered,</p>
<p> they had tried, they'd cajoled. Milosevic has proved to be extremely</p>
<p> stubborn and intransigent. They could have reached an agreement in</p>
<p> Rambouillet at the conference with the ethnic Albanians. They didn't.</p>
<p> I don't think NATO had any alternative. It's very regrettable,</p>
<p> it always is but history has told us that if you stand by in the face</p>
<p> of that kind of intransigent you pay a very heavy price later on.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Would you appeal for calm amongst the Yugoslav community of Australia?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I don't appeal and the reason I don't is that the</p>
<p> question assumes that they aren't first and foremost the people</p>
<p> who are part of the Australian community. We have actually over the</p>
<p> last few years been refreshingly free by and large with one or two</p>
<p> exceptions of domestic overreaction from different sections of the</p>
<p> Australian community to events overseas. And we have had one or two</p>
<p> exceptions to that recently but there was a lot of talk at the time</p>
<p> of the gulf crisis that we were going to have difficulties, we didn't.</p>
<p> People from different parts of the old Yugoslavia have made a magnificent</p>
<p> contribution in Australia and they are very much apart of the Australian</p>
<p> community. They are valued people in the Australian community and</p>
<p> I am certain that they will first and foremost behave as Australians</p>
<p> understanding the sympathy and concerns they all have for their loved</p>
<p> ones in Kosovo or in Belgrade, that would be understandable. And like</p>
<p> any other Australian citizen they have a right to express their point</p>
<p> of view through lawful protest but I think calm will be observed because,</p>
<p> not because I call for it or anybody else calls for it because they</p>
<p> respect the laws and the customs and the freedoms of Australia.</p>
