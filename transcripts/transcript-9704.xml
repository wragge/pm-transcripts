ROD HENSHAW: Let's go back to Con in Townsville. Con Sciacca you also have a very<br />
interesting and very special guest for us this afternoon?<br />
CON SCIACCA: I do Rod. probably my chiefest backer in this whole program has been the<br />
prime Minister Paul Keating, welcome Prime Minister, I guess you'd have a certain amount of<br />
interest in this, there's no doubt about that. Don't you agree that we really did need to do<br />
something on this very special year?<br />
PAUL KEATING: I think so con. This was too significant a commitment, the losses were too<br />
great, for it not to mean something 50 years later, the community action of this kind, which<br />
Australians had never seen the likes of before, and as I said the commitment was too great. was<br />
not something to simply be left to contemporary memory, but now the opportunity was ours, half a<br />
century later, to tell Australians about the Pacific War, to lift it in our history, to understand that<br />
this was the fight to save Australia, and Australia was saved, liberties were kept, our way of life<br />
we created here was maintained, and that we owe it all to those people who did that, to keep<br />
going. ROD HENSHAW: Prime Minister, Thanks very much for joining us on the program this<br />
afternoon. Like me you were born after the war, but had you taken a personal interest in<br />
Australias involvement to such an extent, before the Australia Remembers juggernaut got going.-<br />
PAUL KEATING, Yes, I've made it one of the quite interestingly in my Prime Ministership<br />
which started at the end of December 1991, it started just before the 50th Anniversary and the fall<br />
of Singapore, in 1942, so through this period, 1992 to 1995, 1 really had the opportunity to span<br />
the war years, shadowed by 50 years. So when I went to Kokoda in Papua New Guinea in 1992,<br />
and then to Hell Fire Pass in Thailand, and Kanchanaburi, to various other sites around Asia, I<br />
wanted to use the opportunity to bring home the lesson of the Pacific War which was not really as<br />
well understood in Australian History, as the First World War, yet this was the war that saved<br />
Australia. And you may also know that one of my own family died in one of the death marches<br />
from Sandakan to Ranau In North Borneo, and I was aware of that, I was aware of all of that<br />
prisoner of war, the prisoner of war saga of Australia even when I was a child and so these things<br />
have been in my mind but overwhelmingly what's in my mind is to teach younger Australians, this<br />
generation of Australians that we owe a debt to the generation, that heroic generation, that fought<br />
and saved Australia, and to understand that this was the battle for Australia. While we had allied<br />
obligations in the First World War, it did not involve the defence of Australia, this happened in the<br />
Second World War and it's why I have as Con said, been a strong supporter of his, and of<br />
Australia Remembers because this was the opportunity to bring it together with Victory in the<br />
Pacific. the commemoration 50 years on.<br />
ends </p>
