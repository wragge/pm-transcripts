    <content><![CDATA[<p>This blog was open for comment from 11 to 25 September 2009.</p>
<p>Kevin Rudd says...</p>
<p>One in five Australians are under 25 and make an enormous contribution to Australia's economy, our culture and our nation.</p>
<p>From designers like RM Williams, who was 24 when he designed his famous elastic-sided boots for stockmen, to the artists and musicians who have challenged and entertained us, and athletes who lift our nation's pride. And every young person studying and working is vital to our economic recovery and future prosperity.</p>
<p>Growing up has its challenges.</p>
<p>As I've visited hospitals around the country to discuss health reform, medical staff have told me we need to do better for young people.</p>
<p>One in four young Australians aged between 16 and 24 have experienced mental health disorders in the previous 12 months, yet only a quarter of young people receive professional help.</p>
<p>Obesity is on the rise. The proportion of overweight and obese Australian children in the 5-17 age-group has increased from about 21% in 1995 to about 25% in 2007-08.</p>
<p>We're all concerned about street violence - often the result of one drink too many. Assaults have almost doubled since 1995 with young males and females aged between 15 and 24 having the highest rate of being victims of assault. About one in five men and one in six women aged between 18 and 24 drink alcohol to dangerous levels at least once a week.</p>
<p>Policies and programs for young Australians are spread across a whole lot of different government and community organisations, making it hard to get information and get involved. Health services and other youth programs are not always designed around young people's lives. It can be difficult to work out who to go to for help.</p>
<p>You have already told us some things that would make a difference. Making it easier to get information, creating public spaces designed by and for young people, and providing more help to those who need it before problems get worse are just a few of the themes coming out of the Australian Youth Forum and the 2020 Youth Summit last year.</p>
<p>The Government is developing a plan for young Australians - with young Australians - so that all young Australians are safe, healthy, confident and resilient, with the skills and supports they need to build their own futures.</p>
<p>To get us rolling, I want to hear from you what matters most - at home, at school, online and out in the community.</p>
<p>If you were Prime Minister for a day - what would you do to:</p>
<p>     * help our young people grow up safe, happy and resililient</p>
<p>     * give young people the skills they need to learn, work and fully engage in community life ?</p>
<p>     * reduce the physical and mental health risks facing young Australians, including negative body image, anxiety and depression, obesity and alcohol-fuelled violence?</p>
<p>     * enable young people to accept responsibility for their actions and their behaviours?</p>
<p>     * help young people to negotiate the challenges of today's society?</p>
