TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER THE HON P. J. KEATING MP<br />
DOORSTOP, PARLIAMENT HOUSE, CANBERRA, 5 NOVEMBER 1995<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
PM: lull just give you a comment on Mr Rabin's assassination. The first<br />
thing I would like to do is to offer my condolences to his family, to his<br />
wife and his family, to the Government and people of Israel on behalf<br />
of the people of Austral! a.<br />
I was left incredulous I must say at Mr Rabin's assassination. He was<br />
a real leader who made great strides for peace. He took the risks, he<br />
was a tough person, he had the support of the sceptics in Israel. The<br />
people in the military have had to fight conflicts over these issues. He<br />
had the power and he summoned it and he used it and it is a tragedy,<br />
a personal tragedy, that the world has lost him and a tragedy for Israel<br />
that he has been taken away.<br />
The bad feature of this is that Jewish people around the world always<br />
regard Israel as a sanctuary from violence and to have violence done<br />
to their leader by one of their own, I'm sure damages that dream for<br />
them. But, the sad fact is that the people who have sought the peace<br />
and made the steps in the Middle East Anwar Sadat, in the first<br />
instance, now Yitzhak Rabin and others have had to wear the supreme<br />
sacrifice of their own lives.<br />
I offer to Shimon Peres, the Acting Prime Minister, our very deepest<br />
condolences and to say that the thing that can be best done in the<br />
memory of Yitzhak Rabin is to continue the peace process and to see<br />
it consolidated and you know here that we have played a role in that<br />
process ourselves during these negotiations. We have had peace<br />
keepers in the Sinai, we will commit ourselves fully to that peace<br />
process which will do more, I think, than anything else to honour the<br />
memory of Yitzhak Rabin.<br />
J: Mr Keating, has any thought been given to who will attend the funeral<br />
on Australia's behalf? </p>
<p>PM: We are thinking about that now. I would like to go myself. It is on<br />
tomorrow night at 10: 00pm Australian time. So, it is just over 24 hours<br />
and there are no regular air routes there, so we are just trying to look<br />
at what arrangements might or could be put in place.<br />
J: Mr Keating, does this have implications for the peace process given<br />
that you just described the Prime Minister toughness, experience<br />
with the military a peace maker, is there someone to take on that<br />
role now?<br />
PM: Well, that is a matter for the Israelis, but no doubt all the people in<br />
Israel that value peace, they would feel I'm sure as I feel that the way<br />
to honour Yitzhak Rabin and his work would be to consolidate and<br />
accelerate that process. That political fillip and commitment inside<br />
Israel is probably as important as whoever it might be leading the<br />
country.<br />
J: Prime Minister, are you concerned that this event may make Israel<br />
somewhere that Australian citizens should think twice about visiting<br />
the country?<br />
PM: I don't think. I think that it is just another tragic event in the long road<br />
to peace in the Middle East. But, it doesn't hold any implications for<br />
the safety of any Australian person there. Thank you.<br />
