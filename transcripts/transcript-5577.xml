PRIME MINISTERI.<br />
FOR MEDIA SUNDAY, MAY 3 1981<br />
ADDRESS TO THE STATE ZIONIST COUNCIL OF VICTORIA<br />
On this occasion, which celebrates the 33rd anniversary of<br />
the founding of Israel, a memorable evefft for other nations<br />
and other peoples as well as for the Jewish people, I think<br />
it is appropriate to reflect on. the significance of Israel's<br />
experience for Australia.<br />
Both Israel and Australia are young societies, both established<br />
in countries of immense antiquity. And yet how different<br />
is the character of the antiquity of the two lands for there<br />
is a real sense in which the vast majority of Australians<br />
would be more familiar with the age-old names and places in<br />
Israel than with the oldest names and places in this country.<br />
Australians have had to come to terms with Australia. It was<br />
an alien land, and only in comparatively recent times have<br />
we come to feel fully at home in it and familiar withit.<br />
environment How different is the situation of Israel.,<br />
There was an age-old homeland repossessed. The challenge<br />
was not to know it, but to defend its survival.<br />
I suggest that both countries have attracted their people<br />
because ( 5T an-idea. For Australia, that idea has been<br />
freedom -the longing of people to be free of oppression and<br />
fear, and the search for opportunity to build ones own life<br />
in a land of peace, where security is not in question from<br />
day to day. Freedom has also been a dominant idea for Israel<br />
the freedom to realise the dream of home for an age-old<br />
people, and to follow the vision of justice and peace.<br />
And if Australia was harsh environment for Australians<br />
to come to terms with, how much harder has it been for the<br />
Israeli people to maintain their commitment to their vision.<br />
But there has been a preparedness to risk much<br />
to risk all, for the sake of that vision.<br />
it is the presence of a dream which has given rise to the<br />
magnificent spirit of Israel and which supports its<br />
capacity as well as its right to survive. The fire of conflict<br />
in the defence of that dream has, I believe, produced a realis~ m<br />
and a standing which make the people of Israel an example to<br />
other'nations. The proximity of danger encourages realismi,<br />
because the costs of delusion are potentially mortal. ./ 2 </p>
<p>-2<br />
The Australian people too have fought for their ideals<br />
and have realised their national identity as a result.<br />
Both nations still face the risks of an'uinstable world.<br />
But Australians have been fortunate in the enjoyment of their<br />
freedom,-without the constant challenge to national survival<br />
which has faced Israel. We have been able to pursue more<br />
pleasant ways, and to concentrate far more on redlising<br />
our private ambitions and ideals, at least in recent decades.<br />
As a result, we have built here a way of life which I<br />
believe is without compare in the world a way of life<br />
with higher levels of confidence, openness and trust between<br />
people than exists anywhere else in which freedom and<br />
individual achievement has become taken for granted.<br />
That difference is fundamental to our attitudes -we<br />
tend to take for granted what Israel has never been able<br />
to assume national survival. The result is that Australians<br />
often have alow awareness of matters affeeting our national<br />
security. I am often asked: Why does Australia, as a middle-ranking<br />
power, speak out in the way we do'on matters which are<br />
more directly the business of the super powers? The attitude<br />
is that as a middle-ranking power, Australia cannot do much<br />
about these issues, so the conclusion*-is often drawn<br />
that it would be more sensible to confine ourselves to matters<br />
of trade and aid, and of regional and local security.<br />
It is sometimes even suggested that Australia is in some way<br />
demonstrating an unrealistic and grandiose view of its place<br />
in the world by concerning itself with major questions that<br />
involve world peace with Soviet imperalism, with European.-. j:<br />
security arrangements, with the future of Israel.<br />
The best answer to this question would be to take th6<br />
person asking it to any Australian town, from the largest<br />
to the smallest, and invite him to look at the memorial<br />
he would find there to the Australians who'died in the wars<br />
of this century. The lists are long.<br />
Too many Australians have died in places remote from their<br />
home in Europe, in the Middle East, in Korea, in South-East<br />
Asia for us to be unconcerned about the preservation of<br />
world peace. Their sacrifice not only confers a right but<br />
imposes-a duty on Australia to speak on these issues.<br />
The middle-ranking countries of the world should recognise<br />
that they have a role to play. It would not only be foolish,<br />
but a political and moral failing to assume that nations such<br />
as Australia should be seen but not heard on the great issues.<br />
It is not--some exaggerated and unrealistic notion about the<br />
extent of the influence an Australian voice can have which<br />
moves me to speak out on these issues. It is rather my<br />
belief that in a Western world characterised by a great deal<br />
of self doubt and division, and by a degree of disillusionment<br />
which has not yet been wholly overcome, every-contribution<br />
to clarifying issues and strengthening resolve is valuable. </p>
<p>-3<br />
Obviously there is a limit to what a nation of 14 million<br />
people can do, but there are some things-Auist-alia can do.<br />
Our history shows that the great issues of peace and security<br />
affect us all, even if the threats are far-away.<br />
The graves of Australians in the Middle East and'Europe<br />
provi-de a basis for our right to speak out and the basis<br />
of an obligation on every Australian government to do so.<br />
our responsibility to the future-6f this country provides a<br />
further-basis -of a right to speak out.<br />
All wisdom on matters of security and world peace does not<br />
reside with the super powers. A nation of the middle rank,<br />
realistic about protecting its own vital interests, must<br />
form its own independent judgments, and then speak out<br />
on their behalf.<br />
That is a matter that Israel well appreciates it is<br />
less well appreciated here. No . Israeli government would<br />
believe that anyone but Israel would define and defend<br />
Israel's vital interests and the broader interests of regional<br />
peace. And in saying this, you will not understand me to<br />
imply any lessening in the degree of support which Israel<br />
is entitled to expect from other countries.<br />
In Australia, there is a temptation to commit on e of two<br />
dangerous errors. The first is to imagine that distance is<br />
so protective of Australia, that Australia can afford to<br />
be inward-looking and unconcerned with wider issues of security.<br />
The other is the equally dangerous assumption that irrespective.-<br />
of what we do, Another country can be relied on to secure..;-<br />
our national interest, that our great historic allies..<br />
remove from our shoulders the necessity to do anything o-f<br />
substance ourselves, or to form our own independent Judgments.,<br />
Both assumnpt ions are wrong. They are mistakes that tend<br />
to occur wqhen a people has enjoyed long peace and where<br />
conflicts have been far away. They are errors that would<br />
seem strange to Israel.<br />
Israel is a nation unmistakably independent in its thinking<br />
and strong in its expression.. There is a realis m in its thinking<br />
which is a valuable example to Australia. We in Australia<br />
need to realise that-our interests are bound up with world<br />
peace, that we should be concerned with relations between<br />
the super powers, and prepared to speak out on behalf of<br />
our own independent judgments about the ways in which<br />
Australia's interests can best be served.<br />
. Some two-years ago at Harvard, Solzhenitsyn spoke of the<br />
prevalence in the West of a self-deluding interpretation of,<br />
the contemporary world situation, " It works", he said,<br />
as a sort of petrified armour around people's minds<br />
it will be broken only by the pitiless crowbar of events"<br />
We must hope that Solzhenitsyn is wrong in his conclusion<br />
that.' only after bitter experience will people see things<br />
as they are. ./ 4 </p>
<p>-4<br />
But he is surely right in identifying the capacity for<br />
self-delusion as a critical danger. I-believe we are fortunate<br />
to have in the United States at the present time an<br />
administration whose foreign policy is based on principles<br />
which will contribute effectively to securing peace.<br />
When this is the case, it is a sign not of dependence, but<br />
independence, to say so clearly and unequivocally.<br />
So much depends on the President of the United States that<br />
if he embarks on a course which we believe advances our<br />
ideals we should say so. He depends on the support of a<br />
congress which i's in turn greatly influenced by American<br />
opinion. The American people in turn are influenced by their<br />
awareness of what people in other countries are thinking.<br />
our concern with the future of our own children and our<br />
own country must lead us to become invojyed in putting<br />
our conception of what the situation requires. This is not<br />
a presumptive view of what can be achieved by 14 million<br />
Australians. We are not powerless to work for good in<br />
these great issues.<br />
We in Australia can take heart fromi the example of Israelwhich<br />
shows what a small nation can do when it is de termined<br />
to defend what it knows to be right.<br />
I make these points not to raise issues of foreign policyin<br />
the Middle East, issues on which the Government's policies<br />
are well known and firmly held. I make them rather to record<br />
the recognition by the Australian Government of the magnificentachievement<br />
embodied.. in the State.. of Israel. I make thev...:-<br />
also to express the opinion that the experience of Israei*<br />
shows the vital importance of smaller nations making their<br />
own independent assessments of their interests and -ideals. </p>
