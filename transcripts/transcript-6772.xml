1, USL I(<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR<br />
WESTPAC PRESENTATION TO<br />
SURF LIFE SAVING ASSOCIATION<br />
BONDI<br />
OCTOBER 1985<br />
ALAN WHELPTON ( PRESIDENT, SLSA), GUS STAUNTON ( EXECUTIVE<br />
DIRECTOR, SLSA), IAN MATHESON ( DEPUTY MANAGING DIRECTOR,<br />
WESTPAC), JOHN CHATTERTON ( GENERAL MANAGER, NSW WESTPAC),<br />
JEANNETTE McHUGH ( MEMBER FOR PHILLIP), JOHN BROWN ( MINISTER FOR<br />
SPORT) AND ALAN SLADE ( DEPUTY MAYOR, WAVERLEY COUNCIL)<br />
FIRST OF ALL, THANKS VERY MUCH IAN, FOR THIS CHEQUE WHICH I<br />
ACCEPT MOST ENTHUSIASTICALLY ON BEHALF OF THE SURF LIFE SAVING<br />
ASSOCIATION. IT MAKES IT DOUBLY SATISFYING TO BE HERE AT BONDI<br />
TODAY. IT'S A LONG WAY FROM THE BAHAMAS TO THE SURF AND SAND OF BONDI.<br />
AND DESPITE ALL THE ATTRACTIONS WHICH A PLACE LIKE THE BAHAMAS IS<br />
SUPPOSED TO HOLD I MIGHT SAY I DIDN'T SEE MUCH OF THE<br />
PLAYGROUND WHILE I WAS THERE I CAN TELL YOU IT IS NO LETDOWN TO<br />
COME BACK TO AUSTRALIA, ESPECIALLY TO SYDNEY AND PARTICULARLY TO<br />
THE WORLD'S MOST FAMOUS BEACH.<br />
IT'S NO SECRET BY NOW THAT I DO LIKE THE OCCASIONAL BIT OF SPORT.<br />
I'M ALSO PARTICULARLY INTERESTED IN THOSE PECULIARLY AUSTRALIAN<br />
ACTIVITIES WHICH ARE ALLIED WITH SPORT.<br />
THE GREAT PUBLIC SERVICE PERFORMED BY THE SURF LIFE SAVING<br />
MOVEMENT IS ONE OF THE MOST WORTHY AND VALUABLE OF<br />
THESE ACTIVITIES THAT YOU COULD FIND.<br />
FOR ALL THESE REASONS, IT'S GOOD TO BE HERE AT BONDI, TO PLAY A<br />
ROLE IN ONE OF THE OTHER GREAT FEATURES OF AUSTRALIAN LIFE.<br />
AND THAT IS TO HIGHLIGHT THE PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN THE SPORTING<br />
AND PUBLIC SERVICE BODIES AND THEIR PRIVATE SPONSORS.<br />
THIS PRESENTATION OF A CHEQUE FROM THE WESTPAC BANKING<br />
CORPORATION FOR $ 3.61 MILLION IS A GREAT EXAMPLE OF THE<br />
PARTNERSHIP WE ALL NEED IN AUSTRALIA BETWEEN VOLUNTARY<br />
ORGANISATIONS, AMATEUR SPORTING BODIES AND THE PRIVATE SECTOR. </p>
<p>2 THE RESULT OF THIS PARTNERSHIP IS A GREAT DIVERSITY IN AUSTRALIA'S SPORT.<br />
ING LIFE AND IN OUR NATIONAL CHARACTER, AND A<br />
TREMENDOUS EFFECTIVENESS IN THE SORT OF PUBLIC SERVICES WHICH THE<br />
SURF LIFE SAVING MOVEMENT PROVIDES.<br />
THE PARTNERSHIP WITH WESTPAC DOES MUCH TO MAKE THE SURF LIFE<br />
SAVING ASSOCIATION THE VIABLE, EFFECTIVE AND OUTSTANDING<br />
MOVEMENT THAT IT IS TODAY.<br />
WE MIGHT BE A LARGE NATION IN TERMS OF AREA, BUT WE ARE A SMALL<br />
NATION IN TERMS OF POPULATION AND IN TERMS OF FINANCIAL<br />
RESOURCES. AS A GOVERNMENT, WE DO WHAT WE CAN TO HELP ORGANISATIONS SUCH AS<br />
THE SURF LIFE SAVING ASSOCIATION AND ITS RESCUE SERVICES.<br />
BUT WE CANNOT PROVIDE THE SORT OF ASSISTANCE YOU NEED<br />
WITHOUT THE VALUABLE CONTRIBUTION OF THE PRIVATE SECTOR.<br />
ESPECIALLY OF GROUPS SUCH AS WESTPAC WHICH HAVE A LONG AND<br />
CREDITABLE RECORD OF ASSISTANCE TO THE SURF LIFE SAVING<br />
ASSOCIATION AND TO THE HELICOPTER RESCUE SERVICE.<br />
ALAN WHELPTON TELLS ME THAT TODAY'S PRESENTATION REPRESENTS<br />
AUSTRALIA'S SINGLE LARGEST LIFE SAVING SPONSORSHIP. I BELIEVE<br />
THAT IT ALSO REPRESENTS THE LARGEST COMMERCIAL SPONSORSHIP OF<br />
LIFE SAVING IN THE WORLD.<br />
IT IS ESPECIALLY FITTING THAT WE SHOULD HAVE THIS PRESENTATION<br />
HERE TODAY ALONG WITH THAT GREAT IRON MAN RACE WHICH WE HAVE JUST<br />
WITNESSED. IT SYMBOLISES THE TWO ARMS OF THE SURF LIFE SAVING MOVEMENT.<br />
THE TREMENDOUS SERVICE DONE IN PATROLLING OUR BEACHES AND<br />
THE OUTSTANDING SPORTING AND PHYSICAL ACHIEVEMENTS OF THE<br />
MOVEMENT' S ATHLETES.<br />
WITH SUCH A STAR-STUDDED LINE-UP OF COMPETITORS INCLUDING:<br />
CRAIG RIDDINGTON, ROBERT CHAPMAN, GRANT KENNY, GUY LEECH AND<br />
MICK PORRA<br />
AND TWO UP AND COMING JUNIORS, SEAN KENNY AND DARREN MERCER,<br />
COMPETED AGAINST THEM.<br />
MOST OF THEM STARS IN THEIR OWN RIGHT.<br />
IT IS A PITY THAT THERE CAN ONLY BE ONE WINNER OF THIS<br />
WESTPAC TROPHY.<br />
BUT THESE FELLOWS HERE, AND THE MEN AND WOMEN WHO OPERATE THE<br />
RESCUE SERVICE AROUND AUSTRALIA, REPRESENT SO MUCH OF WHAT MAKES<br />
AUSTRALIA AND THE SURF LIFE SAVING MOVEMENT THE SPECIAL PLACE AND<br />
MOVEMENT THAT. THEY ARE. </p>
<p>3<br />
WE HAVE SEEN THE BEST THAT THE IRON MEN CAN DO. AND I BELIEVE WE<br />
WILL ALSO BE SEEING THE BEST THE RESCUE SIDE HAS TO OFFER WITH<br />
THE WESTPAC HELICOPTER AND THE JET BOAT.<br />
WE MUSTN'T FORGET THAT THE SURF LIFE SAVING MOVEMENT AND THE<br />
RESCUE SERVICE IT PROVIDES AP NOT LIMITED TO LOOKING AFTER<br />
PEOPLE WHO GO SWIMMING AT THE BEACH.<br />
OFTEN CALLED UPON TO HELP OTHER PEOPLE ON THE WATER,<br />
OFF-SHORE IN BOATS, OR FISHING FROM ROCKS.<br />
EVEN PEOPLE IN TROUBLE ON LAND.<br />
THIS PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN THE SURF LIFE SAVING ASSOCIATION AND<br />
WESTPAC IS ALSO RELEVANT TO THE EFFORTS WE HAVE BEEN MAKING IN<br />
GOVERNMENT OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS THROUGH JOHN BROWN, MY<br />
COLLEAGUE AND OUR MINISTER FOR SPORT.<br />
TO ENCOURAGE THE PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN THE PRIVATE SECTOR AND<br />
AUSTRALIAN SPORTING BODIES.<br />
WE ARE SETTING UP THE SPORTS AID FOUNDATION TO HELP CHANNEL<br />
PRIVATE SECTOR TAX DEDUCTIBLE FUNDING THROUGH TO SPORTING<br />
BODIES. A POLICY WHICH RECOGNISES THAT WE CAN NOT, WITH LIMITED<br />
RESOURCES, EVER HOPE TO PROVIDE BY OURSELVES THE SORT<br />
OF ASSISTANCE WHICH THESE ORGANISATIONS NEED.<br />
WE HAVE SUBSTANTIALLY INCREASED THE RESOURCES ALLOCATED BY<br />
CANBERRA TO THE SURF LIFE SAVING ASSOCIATION.<br />
THIS YEAR, $ 850,000 FOR SUCH ACTIVITIES AS GEAR AND<br />
EQUIPMENT SUBSIDIES, RUNNING COSTS FOR THE JET BOAT AND<br />
RUBBER DUCKIES, PUBLIC EDUCATION PROGRAMS, AND SOME OF THE<br />
SLSA'S ADMINISTRATION COSTS.<br />
SO FAR WE HAVE ALREADY HANDED OVER $ 200,000.<br />
THE REMAINING $ 650,000 WILL BE MADE AVAILABLE TOWARDS THE<br />
END OF THE YEAR.<br />
BUT I AM ASSURED BY GUS STAUNTON THAT ALL THIS CERTAINLY DOES NOT<br />
MEAN THAT THE SLSA NO LONGER NEEDS YOUR SUPPORT. THEY MOST<br />
CERTAINLY DO.<br />
IT IS GREAT TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH THE SURF LIFE SAVING MOVEMENT,<br />
BOTH AS PRIME MINISTER AND AS3 VICE PATRON OF THE ORGANISATION.<br />
IT IS TREMENDOUS THAT BOTH GOVERNMENT AND PRIVATE CORPORATIONS<br />
SUCH AS WESTPAC CAN BE IN PARTNERSHIP TO SPONSOR THIS GREAT<br />
AUSTRALIAN TRADITION. </p>
<p>4<br />
ANY ASSISTANCE IS GOOD IF IT HELPS YOUR CLUBS, THE SURF LIFE<br />
SAVING CLUBS OF AUSTRALIA, TO REPORT PROUDLY EACH YEAR THAT WHILE<br />
PATROLS ARE ON DUTY THERE WERE " NO LIVES LOST".<br />
AND IT IS ESPECIALLY WORTHWHILE IF IT HELPS TO MAKE THE REST OF<br />
OUR COASTLINE SAFER, AS WELL.<br />
ONCE AGAIN, THANK YOU VERY MUCH WESTPAC FOR YOUR DONATION.<br />
