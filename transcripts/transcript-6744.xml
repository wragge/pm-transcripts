PRIME MINISTER<br />
E O. E. PROOF ONLY<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF PRESS CONFERENCE, 26 SEPTEMBER 1985<br />
PM: Ladies and Gentlemen, after lengthy discussions with Mr<br />
Reid tonight I came to the conclusion that I had not received<br />
a satisfactory response to my letter of the 17th September to<br />
Mr Reid in which I had said to him inter alia. " So that there<br />
can be no confusion let me state in the clearest possible terms<br />
that I seek from you an assurance that Dr Armstrong's settlement<br />
was not a device contrived to avoid or to minimise taxation.'<br />
Not being able to be satisfied in that respect, I had no alternative<br />
but to ask Mr Reid for his resignation and he has given me that<br />
resignation in these terms.<br />
" Dear Prime Minister, Following our discussion this evening<br />
and your clear wish that I should resign as Chairman of the<br />
Australian Bicentennial Authority, I hereby tender my resignation<br />
pursuant to Section 73 of the Australian Bicentennial Authority<br />
Act 1980. 1 further hereby shorten the notice under that section<br />
in order that my resignation shall take place forthwith. Yours<br />
sincerely, JB Reid"<br />
I have contacted Mr John Utz, a member of the Board of the Authority<br />
and he has indicated to me that he will accept appointment as<br />
Chairman of the Authority. That will be on an interim basis.<br />
I finally want to say that I thank Mr Reid for the work that<br />
he has done in his capacity as Chairman of the Australian Bicentennial<br />
Authority since its inception in 1980, the work that he<br />
has done in preparation for the bicentennial year celebrations<br />
in 1988.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, do you expect that all the money<br />
will now be paid to Mr Armstrong?<br />
PM: My understanding is that the money has been paid.<br />
JOURNALIST: It's not recoverable?<br />
PM: Well, I will obviously have to have discussions now that<br />
this position has been reached as to what is involved. I am<br />
not therefore in a position until I have had such discussions<br />
to answer tnatc question. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, it's you who insisted that Dr<br />
David Armstrong should resign. And it's you who told Mr John<br />
Reid that he should err on the side of generosity. So why do<br />
we find a situation here where it's John Reid who has resigned?<br />
PM: Well the answer to that is very simple. I was given clearly<br />
to understand in my discussions with Mr Reid that what would<br />
be involved was the buying out of a contract. It was six years<br />
of the contract was mentioned that there were entitlements under<br />
a contract in those terms. In those circumstances I indicated<br />
that Mr Reid should, if anything err on the side of generosity<br />
in respect of entitlements under a contract. It has become<br />
clear and indeed contained as an appendage to the letter from<br />
Mr Reid to me tonight, that if you go back to the letter of<br />
12th October 1979, that indeed there was no contract which went<br />
to the question of having to go to the period of 1990 five<br />
or six years out. There was the clear statement in it that<br />
you or the Authority may terminate your employment by four months<br />
notice in writing except in the case of your misconduct when<br />
the Authority will be entitled to terminate your employment<br />
forthwith. Now in fact, the termination arrangements that were<br />
concluded were therefore not in relation to the buying out of<br />
a contract which was the understanding which Mr Reid proceeded<br />
after his discussion with me on 19th. And indeed, the arrangement<br />
that was arrived at was one which after I spoke with him on<br />
September, the question of tax advantage arose in that<br />
conversation. And I immediately then signalled my concern<br />
is why I have in fact proceeded to the decision that I have<br />
taken.<br />
JOURNALIST: When did you first become aware that there was<br />
a four month notice clause there?<br />
PM: This is the first time that the letter from Mr Reid to<br />
Dr Armstrong has been in our possession. And I recapitulate<br />
for you the sequence of events. When I spoke to Mr Reid on<br />
the 15th August and said that I believed that Dr Armstrong's<br />
employment should be terminated and he went away to think about<br />
that that is Mr Reid went away to think about that. On 19th<br />
in writing and in the conversation then that I had with him,<br />
he indicated to me that what would be involved would be a buying<br />
out of the remainder of the contract. He mentioned a period<br />
of six years then. And he went away to negotiate in those terms.<br />
Now, when I spoke to him 10th and raised the question with him<br />
then of my puzzlement about the change in the composition of<br />
the settlement and it was pointed out to me then that this<br />
involved advantages for Dr Armstrong my immediate response as<br />
Mr Reid has acknowledged was one of concern about whether in<br />
fact this involved some tax avoidance or tax minimisation.<br />
And I indicated then that I wanted a response as to whether<br />
that was in fact involved. And I followed that up with my letter<br />
of 17th September to him in those terms which I just read out<br />
to you. And it is tonight that I have received a reply to that<br />
request on 17th September. And I simply am not able to be satisfied<br />
that the arrangement then arrived at, contrary to the understanding<br />
given to me as to the buying out of the contract was six years.<br />
That arrangement I am not able to satisfy myself at all, is </p>
<p>not one that involves tax minimisation. And that is not acceptable<br />
to me or to the Government.<br />
JOUR~ NALIST: What tax act has it reached?<br />
PM: It is a tax minimisation. It is at least a tax minimisation.<br />
It may be more than that.<br />
JOURNALIST: Could you give us some details about that?<br />
PM: Well the sum of 240,000 has been included in the agreement<br />
between Mr Reid and Dr Armstrong, an amount which doesn't go<br />
to the buying out of a contract, but which is in terms of undertaking<br />
not to do certain things which we are given to understand would<br />
not attract tax, but which of course, if it had been paid as<br />
a buying out of a contract, would have. And that is unacceptable.<br />
And I have made it clear to Mr Reid on the phone on 10th September<br />
and confirmed by writing on 17th that that was not acceptable.<br />
JOURNALIST: Was the settlement overall too generous, do you<br />
think now?<br />
PM: You see, you have got to go to the point of if it was<br />
a buying out of a contract if there was a contract that existed<br />
which if to be bought out meant a payment of x number of years<br />
of salary, then that would have been in that ballpark, because<br />
it would have involved the payment of x number of years of salary<br />
plus the associated long service leave entitlements and annual<br />
leave and that sort of thing. And that would have been of that<br />
order. What is totally unacceptable is that he has reached<br />
a position where the same sort of figure has been arrived at<br />
in a quite different way which involves tax minimisation. Now<br />
that is not acceptable.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke are you saying Mr Reid misled you about<br />
this?<br />
PM: Well, I don't want to use the word mislead. I don't want<br />
in regard to Mr Reid, any more than for that matter in regard<br />
to Dr Armstrong, create by any statement of mine any unnecessary<br />
hurt for Mr Reid, particularly, as I say, that I freely acknowledge<br />
the contribution that he has made. What I say is that he has<br />
not been able to satisfy me that what is done has been in accordance<br />
with the proposal that he put to me on 19th August, nor in the<br />
consequence am I able to be satisfied that this does not constitute<br />
a contrived scheme of tax minimisation, at the least.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, did you ask for Mr Reid's resignation<br />
tonight, or did he offer it?<br />
PM: I have already said that I asked for it. / 4 </p>
<p>4. I<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr HAwke, what is the figure of tax advantage gained<br />
under the way the deal was formulated?<br />
PM: Well, we find in the letter, let me go back one step, in the<br />
earlier letter from Mr Reid, I think of the 28th of August, he<br />
indicates that he would forward to me a figure of the total<br />
tax involved. We still haven't received that but it appears<br />
that the amount of tax that would be involved would be something<br />
of the order of $ 7,000 in this settlement. But we haven't got<br />
the figure yet.<br />
JOURNALIST: Tax<br />
PM: Yes, but I want to be completely clear to you about this.<br />
We still haven't got the figure from Mr Reid as to what the total<br />
tax figure may be. But it is clear that in regard to the figure<br />
of $ 240,000 which has been put up there to make up the amount to<br />
the order of what was talked about to me on the 19th of August<br />
that that amount apparently attracts no tax. As distinct from<br />
what would have obviously been the case of attracting tax if that<br />
original statement to me as to what was going to happen if that<br />
arrangement had been adhered to.<br />
JOURNALIST: So is it a moral or a legal question that we are looking<br />
at? PM: Well, it is at least a moral question. Now, I would need now<br />
to take advice that the matter has been completely discussed with<br />
Mr Reid. One would need to take advice as to whether the arrangement<br />
of the $ 240,000 was more than minimisation. I will need advice<br />
on that. I am not in a position to say whether it is more than<br />
minimisation. JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, if this scheme is unacceptable and it isw<br />
within normal commercial practices, will you take steps to stop<br />
it happening elsewhere in the corporate world?<br />
PM: But I am not accepting that it is within normal commercial<br />
practice. JOURNALIST: What happens to the Authority now, Mr Hawke.<br />
PM: I am glad you asked that, Barrie. I am indebted to Mr Utz<br />
in difficult circumstances for his immediate response to my request<br />
to accept the interim chairmanship. He understands that it is<br />
important to achieve a continuity of operation and I believe<br />
we all owe a dept of gratitude to him for accepting that. I<br />
trust that now under his chairmanship we will be able quickly<br />
to move to the appointment of a" executive director, a chief<br />
executive, which position had been filled in an acting capacity<br />
by Mr Reid himself, that we can do that and that we can then<br />
find a chairman who will be not an interim chairman, a fulltime<br />
chairman. I want to make it clear, as I have attempted to before,<br />
that a great deal of work, good work, has been done, much remains<br />
to be done. I have been pleased as I go around Australia to see </p>
<p>PM cant: the extensive interest there is in ensuring that we have<br />
an admirable year of celebrations in 1988. The good will of the<br />
community is there for that purpose and I believe that now we can<br />
proceed to do that and I trust that that will be the desire of<br />
everyone concerned in this matter.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, since the Board voted to say it<br />
approved of the way Mr Reid handled this matter, hadn't you<br />
better replace the Board?<br />
PM: I don't believe that that follows. I think it, one relevent<br />
response to that Laurie is that a prominent member of the Board<br />
in Mr Utz has accepted what has occurred now tonight and following<br />
his acceptance of that has accepted the interim chairmanship of<br />
the Board. The belief I have is that the Board will accept now<br />
the further exposition of all that has been involved in this<br />
matter and will continue to operate under the interim chairmanship<br />
of Mr Utz. That is my hope and my belief.<br />
JOURNALIST: Has Mr Utz told you why he thought Mr Reid did the<br />
right thing?<br />
PM: No, he didn't.<br />
JOURNALIST: Did you ask him?<br />
PM: No I didn't.<br />
JOURNALIST: Why did Dr Armstrong have to go?<br />
PM: Well, from the beginning I repeat what I have said before.<br />
I have not wanted to engage in an exposition about the performance<br />
of Dr Armstrong which would unnecessarily create hurt or<br />
embarrasment for Dr Armstrong. I made it clear to Mr Reid<br />
in the discussions I had on the 15th of August that there were<br />
a number of considerations but, all of which centred on the<br />
fact that there was a range of dissatisfaction about certain<br />
aspects of the operation of the Authority. And that the advice<br />
I had including particularly from my own Department was the<br />
belief that these problems would not be overcome while<br />
Dr Armstrong remained there. And in those terms therefore I<br />
believe that I had the responsibility in the interests of<br />
the people of Australia, given that advice and that broad<br />
advice to initiate the removal of Dr Armstrong. I emphasise<br />
that it was not done with any sense of animus against Dr Armstrong,<br />
far from it. And now that he is no longer there and Mr Reid is<br />
no longerthe obligation upon the Government is to ensure that<br />
we put in place people in the two chief positions of authority<br />
who will conduct the affairs of the Australian Bicentennial<br />
Authority in a way best calculated to ensure an appropriate<br />
standard of celebrations in 1988. And I reaffirm my belief<br />
that that will be able to be achieved. And in the process of<br />
course of the discussions that I will have with Mr Utz and<br />
in the discussions which will then follow with the new Chief<br />
executive when appointed and then subsequently with the chairman<br />
that is appointed after the interim chairmanship of Mr UTz, we will<br />
look at the ways in which, in an administrative tense there can be<br />
if you like, a tightening up of procedures, an increase in the<br />
reportability of the Authority to the Government. So that by<br />
taking these collection of measures we will be able to achieve<br />
that objective of an outstanding year in 1988. I am totally<br />
confident that that can be done. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, you have said that you now know that there<br />
was no contract between the Authority and Dr Armstrong. Surely<br />
it follows from that that there was therefore no legal obligation<br />
on the Commonwealth to pay the $ 220,000 whether in the form of<br />
buying out the contract or in the form of this contrived tax<br />
avoidande scheme which you talked about?<br />
PM: It is part of what I have been putting to you, that now that<br />
I have the letter from Mr Reid and with the attachment of the<br />
letter from him of the 12th of October ' 79 to Dr Armstrong, that<br />
it is clear that what was put to me on the 19th of August was not<br />
on the clear reading of that letter a contract which required the<br />
buying out of a contract going up until approximately 1990. Now,<br />
however, the negotiations conducted by Mr Reid, which he has<br />
again indicated he appropriately had to undertake. Those<br />
negotiations have proceeded on a basis which in terms of<br />
the contract that existed was not necessary. It is quite clear.<br />
JOURNALIST: Do you believe there is now a case for revealing<br />
the full details of the removal of Dr Armstrong?<br />
PM: Well, the details are clear. I have in response to a question<br />
earlier this evening indicated that in a sense I don't think it<br />
is fair to Dr Armstrong to go to every element of what was involved.<br />
But I emphasise to you again, as I did in an earlier question, that<br />
the advice to me) summarised in advice from my own head of<br />
departments was in terms that it could not be a legitimate<br />
expectation that the problems that had arisen could be overcome<br />
nor could we expect a totally satisfactory outcome in 1988 if<br />
Dr Armstrong remained in the position. Now, that was the<br />
compelling reason. And it is a sufficient reason. I repeat<br />
I have never in my public life sought, when you are dealing<br />
with a problem which involves hurt for a particular individual<br />
to try and compound that hurt. It is not in my nature and it<br />
certainly wasn't in this case. What I had to do was act in<br />
a way which I believe was necessary in the interests of this<br />
country. I have done that. And I believe that the interests<br />
of the country will be served by the action that has been<br />
taken. JOURNALIST: But isn't the taxpayer footing the bill for it?<br />
PM: The taxpayer is footing the bill for the arrangement that<br />
was negotiated for Mr Reid.<br />
JOURNALIST: Among the documents you tabled last week there is<br />
a legal opinion to the Authority that the arrangement reached on<br />
the financial settlement was satisfactory. Do you have an<br />
opinion to the contrary?<br />
PM: I certainly have a view myself which is shared by those<br />
advising me that the arrangement that has in fact been arrived<br />
at is not one which is in any way in accordance with the understanding<br />
of the basis upon which I understood the negotiations would be<br />
taking place. But most specifically there is a clear judgement<br />
that I make that the arrangement that has been entered into involves<br />
at the least tax minimisation. Perhaps more. But it involves in<br />
the least tax minimisation. And that is not acceptable. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, why wasn't this picked up earlier. I<br />
mean aren't we only in this situation tonight because you didn't<br />
identify these defects when you first<br />
PM: No let me make it clear that when I spoke to Mr Reid on<br />
the 15th and he then proceeded after the conversation on the<br />
19th with me, I had absolutely no reason to believe that the<br />
Authority, the Australian Bicentennial Authority, would proceed<br />
to an arrangement that involved tax minimisation. It was<br />
the furthest thought from my mind that that would take<br />
place. Now, when I spoke with Mr Reid on the 10th of September<br />
and at that point expressed my puazlement at the difference in<br />
the composition of the settlement from what I understood<br />
would have followed from my discussion with him on the<br />
19th of August. Reference was then made to the advantages<br />
that would flow to Dr Armstrong from that arrangement.<br />
My immediate, and I emphasise immediate, my immediate<br />
response when that was put to me was to say is there a<br />
tax avoidance or minimisation involved in it. Because,<br />
I suggest it wouldn't occur to anyone else, it simply<br />
had not occurred to me that some arrangement would be made<br />
which could involve tax, could or would. And as soon as<br />
I raised that in response to the observation that this would<br />
be to the advantage of Dr Armstrong I immediately said, as I<br />
have indicated on anumber of occasions, well I want you to<br />
tell me if there is any element of avoidance or minimisation<br />
in this arrangement. And followed that with the letter of<br />
the 17th of September indicating that I wanted that in writing.<br />
Now I just received that letter today. And I reeat that letter<br />
has not satisfied me in any way that that is notlas occurred. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: But when you first got the details of the settlement,<br />
did you seek advice on that?<br />
Pm: Well, as I said in the Parliament, I got that and perhaps one<br />
could have raised the question of the composition of the settlement<br />
earlier. I have already said that. But even at that point when I saw<br />
the difference of the composition the thought of tax minimisation<br />
did not occur to me and then I talked with Mr Reid and I said to him<br />
then, it was the first case, and I said ' well, look, I am puzzled by<br />
the change in composition', and it was as soon as I had said that<br />
and it was put to me that ' well, this is to the advantage of<br />
Dr Armstrong'. As soon as that was put to me I said, ' does that<br />
mean there is some question of avoidance or minimisation', because<br />
I would have no bar of that and insisted that I be informed as to<br />
whether that was involved. Now, it was only tonight that I got the<br />
letter and I have had to come to the conclusion that that is not the<br />
case. There isn't at least tax minimisation involved. And it is in<br />
that context that I have found it necessary to ask for the resignation<br />
of Mr Reid.<br />
JOURNALIST: Can you just indicate for us what the difference, the<br />
after tax difference between what Dr Armstrong will be getting<br />
after the current package and what he should have got under proper<br />
PM: What I have said before is that we are still to receive from<br />
Mr Reid the indication that he said earlier that he would give of<br />
the total amount of tax involved in this arrangement. But what does<br />
seem to be quite clear is that in regard to the $ 240,000 element which<br />
has been in under these other arrangements that no tax applies to<br />
that. Now quite clearly, if there had been an adherence to what I had<br />
understood was the arrangement of a buying out of a contract then tax<br />
would have applied to that.<br />
JOURNALIST: The top marginal rate<br />
PM: Well, it was over 6,000 and 7,000, yes. So that is right.<br />
Now, until we get that full statement from Mr Reid as to what is the<br />
total tax amount on the other element then I can't, as you will<br />
appreciate, give you that final answer. What I can say with assurance<br />
is that this amount of $ 240,000 that has been put in unrelated to( A<br />
buying out of a term of a contract, which the contract appears not<br />
to exist anyway in those terms, but in regard to that $ 240,000<br />
no tax. Now that is not acceptable.<br />
JOURNALIST: The $ 7,000 tax which you mentioned before, what-. exactly<br />
does that refer to?<br />
PM: Well, that relates to the taking out of those elements of the<br />
payments to Dr Armstrong that were in the nature of salary. See there<br />
are elements of it of long service leave entitlement. Part was also<br />
an element of future long service leave entitlement. But I can assure<br />
you that when I get the full statement from Mr Reid as to the tax<br />
elements of that non-$ 240,000, I will make those available.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, does Mr Reid finish up immediately or<br />
is he serving out some....... such as six months?<br />
PM: No, I have read that out before and I said, ' I further hereby<br />
shorten the notice under that section in order that my resignation<br />
shall take place forthwith'. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Is there anything in the letter of October 12, 1979<br />
which would indicate that Dr Armstrong would have had a belief that<br />
he would have had4job in the ABA until 1990?<br />
PM: Yes, but that doesn't go to the question of the contract.<br />
Let me read the whole of that paragraph:<br />
' You or the Authority may terminate your employment by<br />
four months notice in writing c.,,, ept in the case of your<br />
misconduct when the Authority will be entitled to terminate<br />
your employment forthwith. Should you not resign or be<br />
terminated forthwith the last date of your employment by<br />
the Authority will be the 30 June 1990 when the Authority<br />
will cease to exist. If the Parliament of the Commonwealth<br />
decides that the Authority shall cease exist on some other<br />
date then that would be the date applying in lieu of<br />
June 1990.'<br />
Now quite clearly, here we are having a situation where someone was<br />
being taken on as Chief Executive and Mr Reid was indicating the<br />
expectation of what the period of the employment would be in normal<br />
circumstances. But he is doing that in the context of saying in the<br />
first sentence as to what the contractual situation, ' you<br />
Dr Armstrong, or the Authority may terminate your employment by<br />
four months notice in writing &amp;; Xept in the case of misconduct'.<br />
JOURNALIST: Did Mr Reid indicate whether or not Dr Armstrong would<br />
have been willing to resign now if he didn't get the package that<br />
was offered to-him?<br />
PM: No, all that has been conveyed to me is that following my<br />
discussion with him on the 15 August, then he went into that weekend,<br />
he had discussions with Dr Armstrong and indicated that the view was<br />
that the employment should be terminated. And when he came back to<br />
me on the 19th he indicated well, yes, Dr Armstrong would accept that.<br />
And they then went into the negotiation with their solicitors as to<br />
the terms of that. Negotiations which on the basis, as far as I was<br />
concerned, of what Mr Reid had said to me ' well, there will be<br />
a fairly large amount of money which is represented by the buying<br />
out of a contract which has got about six years to go'.<br />
JOURNALIST: Is Mr John Menadue being considered........ offering<br />
a position at the Authority?<br />
PM: Not by me, I have not addressed my mind to his name.<br />
JOURNALIST: Dick Smith?<br />
PM: No. Bill Jones?<br />
JOURNALIST: Dick Smith from Dick Smith Electronics?<br />
PM: No, his name had not occurred to me.<br />
JOURNALIST: What sort of settlement package will Mr Reid receive?<br />
PM: Well, can I say I have not addressed my mind to that and knowing<br />
John Reid as I do I would think he wouldn't be looking for one. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, there have.-now been three resignations from<br />
the Authority. Who must bear the ministerial responsibility for<br />
the statements reached?<br />
PM: There is no question of ministerial responsibility for the<br />
third one. Which is the third one you have got in mind?<br />
JOURNALIST: Ranald MacDonald......<br />
PM: Well, certainly no question of ministerial responsibility for<br />
Mr MacDonald's......<br />
JOURNALIST: Who must accept the responsibility for the state of the<br />
Authority as perceived by the Australian public at the moment.<br />
PM: How does the Australian public perceive it? Are you the<br />
spokesman for them.<br />
JOURNALIST: I don't think they see it very well.<br />
PM: Well, when I feel that yotwm the spokesman for the Australian<br />
public I will come and ask your opinion.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, on the matters which you suggest might go<br />
beyond tax minimisation, have you got anyone in the tax office,<br />
are they looking into that or are you planning to refer that to them?<br />
PM: How we will proceed with that matter I have got to address my<br />
mind to. That arises out of the discussion this evening. I have said<br />
on a number of occasions that I believe it's certainly minimisation.<br />
I don't think there is any argument about that. As to whether it is<br />
more than that I will have to take advice on that in the light of the<br />
discussion which has only taken place this evening.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, will you make public Mr Reid's letter of<br />
resignation.......<br />
PM: I don't know how much more public I can make the letter of<br />
resignation than reading it out twice. Would you like me to dance<br />
up on the rafter with it?<br />
JOURNALIST: You also mentioned material that was appended to it.<br />
Will that be made public?<br />
PM: I have not mentioned anything that was appended to it for the<br />
very simple reason that nothing was appended to it.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, how do you think you have come through<br />
it? Do you think you are vulnerable in any way in Parliament or<br />
outside?<br />
PM; No, I believe not. In the one thin5 I indicated to the Parliament,<br />
perhaps I could have directed my mind to the change in the composition<br />
between the end of August and the 10th September. But I was engaged<br />
in a number of other matters but I believe that I have properly<br />
discharged the responsibility that when I raised the question with<br />
Mr Reid and he indicated to me an arrangement which involved an<br />
advantage for Dr Armstrong. Instantaneously I said I had a concern<br />
about this tax avoidance or minimisation. I could not have raised that<br />
more immediately when it was brought to my attention because I repeat<br />
the thought that the Authority would be involved in tax avoidance or<br />
minimisation simply had not occurred to me. Let me finish please. </p>
<p>As soon as that matter came to my attention in a conversation with<br />
Mr Reid, I immediately said I want you to give me assurance that<br />
that's not involved. I wrote on the 17th and I had no indication<br />
on the 10th or after the 17th that that was involved. And the letter<br />
that I have received tonight as I said at the outset of this<br />
conference, simply cannot satisfy me, or I would suggest anyone else,<br />
that that is not involved.<br />
JOURNALIST: But doesn't that whole explanation really amount to<br />
an admission that you closed the stable door after the horse had<br />
bolted? PM: No, I think that what it indicates/ that I accepted that following<br />
the 19th of August conversation that a certain course of action would<br />
be pursued. When it became clear to me in the conversation that<br />
hadn't been then I took the immediate action that I needed to take<br />
to satisfy myself that that hadn't happened. And I have come to the<br />
point tonight, having received the letter from Mr Reid and having<br />
had conversation with him that my concerns in the respect had not<br />
been satisfied, I have taken the action that has been necessary.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, how do you react when you discover that someone<br />
of the calibre of Mr Reid has left you the Prime Minister of Australia<br />
at least under a misapprehension?<br />
PM: Well, I am unhappy that we have a situation where for whatever<br />
reason on Mr Reid's part, there is a different course of events<br />
pursued from that which I understood would be pursued which course<br />
of events has involved tax minimisation I am both unhappy and sad<br />
about that.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, will Mr Reid's and Dr Armstrong's replacement<br />
both be Australian?<br />
PM: Well, John Utz is a vigorous Australian, so the answer to your<br />
question is already satisfied in that part and I would believe that<br />
the replacements would be Australians. But we are an open society.<br />
I don't put bars upon those who will be appointed.<br />
JOURNALIST: Just to clear up on that point you are saying that<br />
the only specific provision for the termination of Dr Armstrong's<br />
employment was four months notice?<br />
PM: That's now what is put to me in the letter the attachment.<br />
I asked for Mr Reid tonight to come with all relevant information<br />
and that what is attached. Now that is all that I am aware of.<br />
JOURNALIST: And all the rest is really cream on the top?<br />
PM: Well, I must say, I mean I think it's been explicit and implicit<br />
in what I have said, is that in the terms of that contractual<br />
relationship, and that's all that has been put before me as to what<br />
the contractual relationship is then four months notice met the<br />
requirements of that relationship. </p>
