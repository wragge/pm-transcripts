PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR PRESS: PM. No. 56/ 1972<br />
PRESIDE'T i'IXOS VISIT TO THE U. S. S. R.<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister, the Rt Hon. William<br />
McMahon, M. P.<br />
The Prime Minister, Mr. McMahon, today described President<br />
Nixon's recent visit to the Soviet Union as another massive<br />
stride along the road toward-reducing international tensions and<br />
another contribution towards making the world a more peaceful<br />
place in which to live in freedom and peace of mind.<br />
In Mr. Nixon's own words, " a foundation has been laid for a<br />
new relationship between the two most powerful nations in the<br />
world." Mr. McMahon said that the Australian Government welcomed<br />
the agreements signed during the summit meeting and applauded<br />
the President's initiative and the constructive approach that<br />
both the United States and the Soviet Union has taken in their<br />
discussions in Moscow. The agreements limited strategic arms<br />
were clearly a signifi: Fai-t achievement.<br />
They could well mark an historic turning point in the efforts<br />
to halt the arms race aid to bring a'out a meaningful relaxation<br />
of world tension.<br />
Mr. McMahon also said he believed that the declaration of<br />
basic principles between the U. S. A. and the U. S. S. R. was<br />
significant both in substance and psychologically.<br />
The declared principles opened up new avenues for the<br />
development of the future relationship between the two super-powers<br />
and must make a contribut-ion towards detente between east and west.<br />
Of particular importance is the undertaking both nations have<br />
given to exercise restraint in their mutual relations and to<br />
negotiate and settle differences by peaceful means. Among these<br />
were Vietnam and the Middle East.<br />
The Prime Minister also sa'd that there are satisfying reasons<br />
for expressing our gratitude to President Nixon for the initiatives<br />
he had taken towards opening up consultations with Peking and Moscow.<br />
/ 2 </p>
<p>92. A real contribution had been made towards reducing many of the<br />
previously existing regid in i. ne: aticr. al : f; airs and<br />
the tensions which have cxi . te. i cn ' tcse three great nations.<br />
Whilst the long-term results o visits will be seen in the<br />
future, the missions had achieved their main purpose.<br />
They had given grounds for the hope that a new era has commenced<br />
an era in which all nations can pursue their aspirations for social<br />
and economic progress in an atmosphere of peaceful co-operation. </p>
