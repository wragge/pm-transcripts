FOR PRESS: P. M. No. 91/ 1965<br />
FURTHER DROUGHT RELIEF FOR NEVI SOUTH WALES<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister, Sir Robert Menzies<br />
The Premier of New South Wales, Mr. Askin<br />
informed me yesterday that because of the failure of the<br />
harvest in the northern areas of the State, it was urgently<br />
necessary to transport wheat to those areas for use in the<br />
manufacture of stock feed.<br />
I sent Mr. Askin a telegram today to let<br />
him know that the cost to his Government of freighting<br />
this wheat will be accepted by the Commonwealth Government<br />
as a drought relief measure for the purposes of the general<br />
assistance grant to be made by the Commonwealth ' to New South<br />
Wales to support the State's budgetary position.<br />
