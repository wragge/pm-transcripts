TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
LAUNCH OF THE YOUTH TRAINING INITIATIVE PROGRAM,<br />
PARRAMATTA TOWN HALL, PARRAMATTA, 2 DECEMBER 1994<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
Thank you very much for that Introduction, Eden. Caroline and Ian, my<br />
ministerial colleagues Simon Crean and Ross Free, and Paul Elliott, the<br />
Member for Parramatta and his wife Julie, the Sarah Redfern High School<br />
and young Australians. It is a very great pleasure for me to be involved today<br />
with my colleagues in this initiative which came from Working Nation.<br />
Because, I think the thing you have to know is that 11 years ago when those<br />
of you who are now completing High School were 7 years of age, or those of<br />
you who are in Year 11 were 6 some of us were thinking about a new<br />
Australia. We were Imagining a country completely different than the one we<br />
had at the time. Because you know enough about our history to know why we<br />
inherit this vast continent, and have it as one to ourselves, we were part of<br />
the old industrial culture of the West European/ North American world under<br />
what used to be called Imperial preference. And we built up an industrial<br />
base in this country which became antiquated and out of touch and<br />
unproductive, and when the countries we traded with went into trade blocs<br />
like Britain went into the European Community -Australia was left with this<br />
ring fence of tariffs, and inside it a great heap of industrial archaeology.<br />
Before that, of course, as the clip said, there were jobs aplenty. But, they<br />
were unskilled jobs for low-value products. But, the history of the post-War<br />
world with the rise of the great states like Japan and Germany, and the<br />
continuing growth of the big industrial economies like the United States has<br />
put the wealth into value added and into production which had with it<br />
Innovation, and we in this country have had to now try and re-adapt Australia<br />
in a relatively short period of time.<br />
Now, that meant two things: how to employ our people what do they do, and<br />
what sort of jobs will they have? And particularly our young people how<br />
can we encourage them to be part of a society which produces good and </p>
<p>T2EL.: Dec. 94 16: 13, No. CiI6 P-. 02/ 05<br />
innovative things, a clever. country that has an international future? One<br />
thing we all did know, was that we could never hope to be a clever country<br />
when those of you in Years 11 and 12 were 6 and 7 years of age, we knew<br />
that only 3 out of every 10 of you completed secondary school because that<br />
is as it was. And that the rest that went back out were largely untrained 7<br />
out of 10 untrained, Now, how can you develop a smart society with that?<br />
And how could you look a young person in the eye and say, " We have a<br />
place for you"?<br />
So, we had to do 2 things remodel the Australian economy quickly,<br />
rebalance It and take away all the ring fences, open Australia up to the world,<br />
and at the same time, start to bring up the education of our young people.<br />
Now, it is one of the great matters of pride to me, that in this year that same<br />
cohort of young people it is not 3 in 10 completing secondary school, it is 8<br />
in 10. 8 in 10. And 40% of that output is going through universities, and all<br />
of those thousands of places have been added to the system since 1985.<br />
Indeed, about 16 universities of the size of Sydney University have been<br />
added to the system by this Government since 1985. But, because that is<br />
you don't have to be a mathematician to work out the great majority of<br />
young people were coming out of the system and not going to university, and<br />
many untrained. Indeed, the majority untrained.<br />
So, what we have focussed on in the last few years is developing vocational<br />
ed -ucation, or as you would call it, TAFE. So that we have a national TAFE<br />
system, and a national system of accreditation and a training certificate which<br />
will give you mobility in this country, and the capacity to pick up a job. Now,<br />
Simon Crean, Ross Free and I have been working now for a number of years<br />
with some of our colleagues to build up that TAFE system. Because we have<br />
got the universities well and truly up and running, the challenge now is to<br />
build that TAFE system up, and to have it there so that as you leave school in<br />
Year 12, you go in to that training and this period is the period we focus on<br />
to 19 as a period of vocational preparation. In other words, the school to<br />
work transition. So, this is what the Youth Training Initiative is about.<br />
We had 2 things about young people in Working Nation: one was the<br />
Australian Youth Traineeship Foundation, which is about encouraging young<br />
people to start streaming themselves into vocational education in Years 11<br />
and 12, while at school. That Is, to start taking on work experience and away<br />
from school training, and picking up units for accreditation in TAFE while at<br />
school. And Simon, Ross and I launched that in Gosford about 3 months<br />
ago. Today, we are launching the second part of It, and that is the Youth<br />
Training Initiative. And, the reason we are doing that is that about 14% of<br />
students are dropping out of both school and further study. In other words,<br />
they are not going to TAFE even if it is there, they are not going on) to a<br />
tertiary education they are simply dropping out. Now, we have a view, and<br />
that is that we are optimistic about this country. You saw this week we are<br />
growing now at about 6% GDP growth, we have got inflation at under we<br />
have had 400,000 job growth since the election. Now, this is a workforce of 8<br />
million 400,000 jobs since the last election is a phqpomenal rate of<br />
TEL </p>
<p>TEL 3<br />
employment growth. But we want to -stream young people ' into that flow of<br />
jobs, and we believe that there is great cause for optimism about Australia<br />
wo have never been mora w. mpatitive, wie have rievw Ucwi muiis iiriuvallve,<br />
our education system is up and really driving product innovation, we are now<br />
exporting to the Asia-Pacific as we have never done before we are actually<br />
sitting beside the fastest growing markets in the world for the first time in<br />
Australian history, and you might know that with APEC Asia Pacific<br />
Economic Co-operation in a very historic declaration I was involved with in<br />
Indonesia 2 weeks ago that we have agreed all of us the countries of the<br />
Asia-Pacific, to develop a free trade area. Now that means that Australia will<br />
be part of a large market that it has never been part of before, and the<br />
exciting possibilities are there for young people to look at some of these<br />
countries, and some of these great cities like Shanghai in China where you<br />
see this enormous activity, or in Ho Chi Minh City in Vietnam, or Jakarta in<br />
Indonesia these are all the possibilities. You could be working for an<br />
Australian company and very easily find yourself there, then find yourself<br />
back in Australia, then find yourself in North America the range of<br />
possibilities for you now Is endless and entirely invigorating.<br />
So, with that sort of prospect and this sort of growth, we want all of you, that's<br />
every one of you, to take the opportunities of a tertiary education, a<br />
vocational education, and we don't want you slipping through the cracks of<br />
the system into unemployment where your self esteem drops, where you think<br />
the world is not interested in you, and you start turning your back on society.<br />
This place is too rich and it has got too much going for it, for that to happen.<br />
So, the Youth Training Initiative is something we've thought up which will start<br />
from the first of January next year and it will work in this way: if you're under<br />
18 and you've been unemployed for 13 weeks you'll be eligible for<br />
assistance. Now, that assistance comes by way of a case manager. A case<br />
manager is a person who individually makes a relationship with you and<br />
starts to understand your educational attainments, your personality, what<br />
your aptitudes are, what you might do. So, you have that one to one<br />
relationship, you don't just go down to a CES office and give your name<br />
across the counter looking for a job, or worse, not go at all. We actually have<br />
this case management, one to one relationship where the case manager<br />
helps you to Identify your needs, to search then for suitable education,<br />
training and work opportunities and to help you coordinate access to services<br />
such as labour market programs.<br />
Now, a labour market program is something where there is a job subsidy and<br />
there Is structured training. So, this person assesses you, tries to understand<br />
what you are capable of, gets you back into structured training or education<br />
or into work. In other words, we don't let you fall through the system,<br />
somewhere. So, the Youth Training Initiative is one of those links perhaps<br />
one of the last links in this hierarchy of changes to take young people who<br />
are part of that 14 per cent, who run the risk of falling out of the system and<br />
believing that nobody wants them and society isn't interested in them. This is<br />
our way, the government's way of saying, we are interested,. we will pick you<br />

4<br />
up, we will individually enquire about you, we'll take a personal interest in you<br />
arid we'll put you back in the system. So, this is what we are launching today.<br />
We're launching the Youth Training Initiative. And, it also means if you're<br />
assessed as being at high risk, that is, the likelihood of you being at high risk<br />
of long term unemployment because of, say, your attitude, your attainment,<br />
your family background or something a combination of factors leads one to<br />
assess such a person as being at high risk of long term unemployment<br />
then the case manager will start managing you immediately. In other words,<br />
there is no 13 week wait.<br />
So, we think that this is a great social improvement, The whole of Working<br />
Nation was about a social Improvement. It was about saying that those<br />
people who've been out of work for 12 months or more and that can be<br />
people In their middle age, or young people who may be unemployed 18<br />
months or two years that we say that this is not good enough for Australia.<br />
This Is not good enough for a country which believes in fairness and equality.<br />
And, we will pick you up, case manage you, train you, give you a job subsidy<br />
and get you back into work. Now, I told you a few minutes ago that since the<br />
election just under two years ago, we've had 400,000 job growth. About<br />
100,000 of those have gone to the long term unemployed. This is the cause<br />
of much satisfaction on the part of the government. Because, were we<br />
speaking about this 10 years ago and we had 400,000 jobs, maybe 20,000<br />
would have gone to the long term unemployed, or 25,000. Now, we're talking<br />
about 100,000 so a quarter of the jobs are going to the long term<br />
unemployed. And, that is because of what we call the labour market<br />
programs and those labour market programs are actually focusing these<br />
people up.<br />
So, Working Nation was about that. It was about streaming the long term<br />
unemployed back into work, it was about saying as we all move on as a<br />
country we will move on together, we won't have an underclass where the<br />
long term unemployed are the shock absorbers in the system who carry the<br />
burden of economic change. But, rather, we bring them along with us and we<br />
move them along together. But, whatever we do in this respect, as a<br />
government, we are entirely certain we must do that and more, with our<br />
young Australians. That is, if we believe that Australia has such, now in the<br />
nineties, a low Inflation and high growth future producing innovative products<br />
and exports and linkages to the rest of the world, we know that, properly<br />
trained, the jobs are going to be there for young Australians. Because, our<br />
experience In the eighties was the same in the last ten years we've created<br />
nearly two million jobs. Young Australians got more than their share of those,<br />
but those who are not trained can't, and won't. And, that's why we want to<br />
train them. Now, I don't know that there are any other countries that have<br />
programs quite like this, we think this is a pretty revolutionary approach.<br />
Because, we are saying, as a matter of national policy, we won't let one<br />
young person slip through the system if it is avoidable, and that we will go<br />
and case manage them and strike up a personal relationship with them, and<br />
get them back into structured education or training, or into work experience. </p>
<p>ILL: 2. LJBC 16: 13 No. 013 F. C~/ C~<br />
So, you look at that panoply of things: tertiary education, the massive<br />
participation rates now in schools, the growth in tertiary education, the<br />
building of vocational education, the Australian Traineeship Foundation, for<br />
students in years 11 and 12 to start streaming their way into work experience<br />
while at school, setting up their career path while at school. And, then, those<br />
who are untrained, the 14 per cent, the ones who drop right out of education<br />
and training this initiative is about getting them back in. So, you run right<br />
across the spectrum, from those with the highest TERs going on into tertiary,<br />
to those who have fallen out of the system, we say the system should have<br />
everybody. So, that's what It Is about, that is what we've been seeking to do. And, I am<br />
delighted to find so many people in education, so many young people<br />
responding to these programs and doing so with a confidence, that I<br />
believe young Australians must have. One of the key things I would like to<br />
see this government achieve, indeed the country achieve, is that the optimism<br />
we have is passed on to every young Australian that they feel good about<br />
Australia, they feel good about themselves, they feel good about the nation's<br />
identity and its sense of self confidence, and they believe that there is a place<br />
in there for them. This is what this is about. So it is with very great pleasure<br />
Indeed, that today, I launch this Youth Training Initiative on behalf of the<br />
Commonwealth Government, and believe that every young Australian, as a<br />
con-sequence, can have the hope that if the system doesn't work quite right<br />
for them, in double jig time, we'll have them back on the track and back in this<br />
society that cares for them, that nurtures them and that loves them. That's<br />
the sort of country we want.<br />
ends. TEL 2 Uec .* J416 13 No. 013 F* 05/ 0c-" </p>
