TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
SPEECH AT A RECEPTION FOR THE AUSTRALIAN NETBALL TEAM,<br />
PARLIAMENT HOUSE, CANBERRA, 29 AUGUST 1995<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
Well thank you very much, Kirsten [ Wheeler], Michelle ( Fielke],<br />
Jill [ McIntosh], members of the successful team and ladies and gentlemen.<br />
It is a great pleasure to be here with John [ Faulkner] on this occasion to be<br />
able to say congratulations and thank you to Michelle and the team for a<br />
great Australian victory. A great victory, out there, against the rest of the<br />
world, to demonstrate on two consecutive occasions that it wasn't something<br />
that just was a flash in the pan, that you could keep it up. And that in what<br />
was a most unusual as you say, won by one on two occasions a most<br />
unlikely outcome. And then, of course, that final win which was, of course, a<br />
very strong and convincing one.<br />
I am very pleased for you all as a team, but particularly as individuals, to be<br />
given this opportunity to be out there to actually have that win and for<br />
Australians to share with you the joy of that victory. I was delighted for you<br />
and for all the people interested in netball, yesterday, to see the reception<br />
that you received.<br />
I think it has meant a lot to everybody in this country. We have always had<br />
such tremendously strong women in sport. It has been a part of our great<br />
sporting tradition and keeping it up, out there, where now of course the<br />
competition is always so fierce and the training is so much better than years<br />
ago, it is so much harder to do it.<br />
I am delighted that the Institute of Sport has been able to play a role because<br />
in the 1980s when we were cutting Government expenditure and I used to<br />
sit in the Expenditure Review Committee night in, night out. We cut many<br />
things, but always put money into sport because this is an area where I think<br />
young Australians can show their commitment, what they are made of and it<br />
is a place where we can show our belief in them and our support for them in<br />
one of the rare ways in which a Government can actually have a role and<br />
make a difference and I hope in this respect we have. </p>
<p>Running a political party is a bit like running a netball team. Except in public<br />
life there are no grand finals. In your game, at least, there is a grand final.<br />
In our's, even after you win the election, they say " they'll never win another<br />
on" There is a problem a week later and it all sort of turns to ashes.<br />
So there are no grand finals and you know how hard it is to keep the<br />
psychology of the team together and to keep that belief in yourself and that<br />
sort of instinct to go on, that determination, that willingness to will yourself on.<br />
All of these things are true in public life as they are, I think, in sport. It is one<br />
of the rare parallels I think you can make with world championship sport.<br />
Now I am not saying we are as fit a team as you are we are not or that I am<br />
the fittest one of the team because I am not. But the fact of the matter is, we<br />
do have a slight idea of what it is like to be out there all the time in that<br />
competitive environment, all the time knowing that it is a mind-play most of<br />
the time. You have got to have the general state of fitness and the dexterity<br />
to be in it, but in the end you have got to have the belief in yourself and the<br />
belief in the group of you as a corporate entity, as a group of people and<br />
of course, in this case, in your values and what you want to achieve.<br />
In this building we all know you have these things because you can't do what<br />
you have done without them and I think that is the thing that brings so much<br />
pleasure to us. The fact that young Australians, as you are, have this belief<br />
and these values and this is what has willed you on to win and you are, as<br />
John said, a role model for many thousands of Australian young people and<br />
especially young women who in this day and age where we are all buffeted<br />
by opinions and views and news and everything else and cultural change and<br />
economic change and all of the other things that move our lives around<br />
today, much more than they have been moved by other generations I mean<br />
out there to have some shining lights is a really, I think, important thing for us.<br />
So on behalf of all Australians we thank you most sincerely and salute what<br />
you have been able to do.<br />
Could I just say a few words about Margaret Pewtress. I didn't know her well,<br />
but I got to know her reasonably well. She was a great woman, a great<br />
believer in young Australians, a great contributor to sport and we are very<br />
sad at her passing. She always provided such gusto to the general question<br />
of the organisation of sport in Australia, particularly for women, and I know<br />
she is sorely missed by you and will be by the rest of us. She is one of those<br />
real foot soldiers of Australian sport. She was always in there, every year,<br />
through the good years and the bad years, in there basically trying to make it<br />
better. So I am delighted we will remember her by a special award which will<br />
be associated with the Prime Minister's Award and it couldn't be a more fitting<br />
person to have that, if you like, longtermn acknowledgment by all of you and<br />
those associated with you and those hundreds and thousands of young<br />
Australian women in the sport, for Margaret.<br />
So perhaps I will conclude by again congratulating Michelle, on behalf of the<br />
team, and Jill, who has coached them, and the other key members of the side<br />
to say what a great job you have done, how you have kept it together and </p>
<p>3<br />
doing it on two consecutive occasions is proof positive, if we needed it, that<br />
you really have what it takes. And Michelle the fact that you have been able<br />
now to finish your career on such a high point, is no doubt a personal<br />
pleasure for you and as it is for you, it is for the rest of us.<br />
I think this is another thing, of course, which we have often seen in sport.<br />
That some people never quite retire at the time that they think they should<br />
have and that shows again judgement and good sense and it comes to the<br />
course at the crowning moment in your career. Congratulations. Thank you,<br />
all of you, for your magnificent efforts on behalf of Australia. We are all very<br />
proud of you indeed.<br />
