PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA TUESDAY, 1AY 4 1982<br />
VISIT BY THE PRIME MINISTER TO JAPAN<br />
The Prime Minister announced today that he will visit Japan<br />
later this month in response to an invitation extended to<br />
him at the time of the visit to Australia of the late<br />
Prime Minister Ohira in January 1980.<br />
The Prime Minister will arrive in Tokyo on 20 May from the<br />
United States and hold discussions with the Japanese Prime<br />
Minister, Mr Zenko Suzuki, on 21 May.<br />
The Prime Minister said Japan and Australia shared a common<br />
interest in having an exchange of views at the highest level<br />
before Mr Suzuki attended the Versailles Economic Summit in<br />
June. As partners in the Western Pacific with common links<br />
with Western industrial countries, Japan and Australia shared<br />
many interests and the Prime Minister-welcomed this opportunity<br />
to discuss these with the Japanese Prime Minister.<br />
The visit will also provide an opportunity to exchange views<br />
on important developments in the region, and internationally. </p>
