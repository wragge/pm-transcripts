More than 160,000 Australians per year will benefit from the Australian Government's decision to provide subsidised access to 48 medicines, including treatments for serious heart conditions including heart failure in infants and children, rare but serious infections like tuberculosis, and cancer.</p>
<p>These listings include drugs that were deferred in February and new drugs recently considered and approved for listing by Cabinet.</p>
<p>When some listings on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) were deferred in February, the Government said it would reconsider these drugs when fiscal circumstances allowed.</p>
<p>Budget savings created by price reductions arising from more competitively priced medicines, as well as a number of recent Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee (PBAC) recommendations, mean that it is now possible to list these medicines.</p>
<p>These PBS listings come as the Government also agreed with consumer and industry groups to improve the certainty around the PBS listing process.</p>
<p>As part of our commitment with the Consumers Health Forum, Generic Medicines Industry Association and Medicines Australia:</p>
<p> * 	The Government, industry and consumer groups agreed to work together to discuss ways to manage deferrals into the future.<br />
 * 	They also agreed to work together on further savings for the 2012-13 Budget and other savings following the expiry of the memorandum of understanding between industry and Government.<br />
 * 	The Government committed to not defer any drugs that cost under $10 million a year for the coming year, while it works with all parties to achieve longer-term PBS sustainability.<br />
 * 	Industry has also agreed to legislative amendments to complete price disclosure reforms, which will help to end anomalies in the current pricing system.</p>
<p>This builds on the Gillard Government's strong track record of working productively with industry and consumer groups to deliver a sustainable PBS that provides Australians with access to affordable medicines.</p>

<p>Pradaxa</p>
<p>The Government has also considered the advice of the PBAC of March 2011 with respect to the medicine dabigatran (Pradaxa®), which will cost the budget up to$1 billion over the forward estimates.  PBAC advised that, based on the results of the pivotal clinical trial, Pradaxa represents a safe, efficacious and cost effective therapy for some ‘at risk' stroke patients.  </p>
<p>However, PBAC also raised some important questions about listing Pradaxa on the PBS that require further consideration. Importantly, PBAC advised the Government that the benefit of Pradaxa® observed in a clinical trial context may or may not be reflected wholly in the Australian population which may lead to this medicine being over prescribed without an adequate education campaign for doctors, pharmacists and patients.</p>
<p>Following this advice, the Government will commission Emeritus Professor Lloyd Sansom AO, the former Chair of PBAC, to inform the Government on options for improving the health outcomes of patients treated with anticoagulation therapies, including optimising the use of currently available treatments in Australia as well as the future role of newer therapies for the treatment of atrial fibrillation, such as Pradaxa®.</p>
