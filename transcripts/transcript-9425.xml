TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P. J. KEATING MP<br />
AND HIS EXCELLENCY MR KIM YOUNG SAM, PRESIDENT OF THE<br />
REPUBLIC OF KOREA, JOINT PRESS CONFERENCE, PARLIAMENT<br />
HOUSE, CANBERRA, 18 NOVEMBER 1994<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
PM: Thank you very much ladies and gentlemen, could I perhaps begin<br />
with a short statement. I would just like to repeat what I said last night,<br />
that it has been a personal as well as an official pleasure to have<br />
President Kim Young Sam visit Australia. Not only because we have<br />
worked together closely on multi-lateral bodies such as APEC and on<br />
regional issues, but because of my very deep respect for the<br />
President's very distinguished commitment to democratic reform in<br />
Korea.<br />
The President and I talked over dinner last night, we have had a formal<br />
meeting this morning, we have just joined our Cabinet colleagues and<br />
come from there and we are having a private lunch after we see you.<br />
We got through quite a lot of work today and I just thought I might<br />
repeat to you those bilateral issues which we discussed.<br />
First of all, the President was kind enough to give me an indication of<br />
the relations between South Korea and the DPRK and I was pleased<br />
to have that information and view about how the President sees<br />
relations on the Korean peninsula. I said to the President that I<br />
thought that the inter-Korean dialogue was extremely important, not<br />
only to Korea and relations on the Korean peninsula, but to those of us<br />
in the region to know that there is a dialogue going on, that there is a<br />
relationship, that progress can be made, and that we regard that that<br />
is the dialogue as a matter of necessity.<br />
On bi-lateral relations we have agreed to support stronger investment<br />
links. We are negotiating now an investment protection and promotion<br />
agreement and we hope to bring that to conclusion. We have agreed<br />
to establish a joint fund to facilitate industrial technology projects of<br />
about roughly half a million each side over three years in priority areas </p>
<p>such as the information super highway and clean energy. We have<br />
agreed to upgrade science and technology co-operation through a new<br />
science and technology agreement. We have agreed to promote<br />
closer co-operation on energy through a ministerial level energy<br />
symposium looking at such issues as long-term supply and potentially<br />
joint investment. We further agreed to co-operate on environmental<br />
matters. We have agreed to also expand our tourism relations, that is<br />
expand our tourism sectors to try to facilitate the carriage of more<br />
people between both countries. We had a brief discussion about<br />
submarine technology given Australia's program and we have also had<br />
discussions generally about trade issues and the trade deficit.<br />
The President was kind enough to say that he was very moved by his<br />
experience this morning at the Australian War Memorial and that he<br />
would join Australia in making a contribution to a monument which we<br />
would see in Anzac Parade a monument to the involvement of<br />
Australians in the Korean War during the 1950s.<br />
I think that is a resume of our discussion, but I would like to again<br />
repeat that we are delighted to have the President in Australia. I am<br />
particularly delighted to have him here after this bi-lateral co-operation*<br />
we have had in the greater story of APEC. Very shortly Korea will be<br />
Australia's second largest trading partner. We have a very high<br />
premium on the relationship and I am exceptionally delighted that the<br />
President was able to come to Australia after APEC to get to see our<br />
country, to get to know us better and to make our relationship just that<br />
much stronger. With those words I might invite President Kim Young<br />
Sam to make an opening statement.<br />
SAM: Not translated.<br />
PM: Thank you very much, Mr President. I think, after that opening<br />
statement by both of us we might take questions and perhaps we might<br />
have a question from an Australian representative and then we will try<br />
to alternate it.<br />
J: Prime Minister Keating, did President Kim express an interest in<br />
purchasing our Collins Class submarines?<br />
PM: We didn't have a discussion about purchasing submarines. Korea is a<br />
very confident ship building country, it is probably now building more<br />
tonnage than any other country in the world, it has its own submarine<br />
program. I think, what is significant here is that as with each program<br />
the technology improves and Australian technology, particularly the<br />
sophistication of the weapons fit could lead to a basis of co-operation<br />
between us on some of these specialised areas of submarine<br />
technology. That is the direction to go rather than any notion, certainly<br />
at this point, of anyone buying anyone else's submarine.<br />
J: Korean question not translated. </p>
<p>SAM: Not all translated this issue will be discussed and the solution will be<br />
found and this issue will be definitely very positively revealed Prime<br />
Minister Keating and I discussed the specific issue and based upon<br />
the growing partnership between the two countries I expect that the<br />
Australian government would consider this issue in a very favourable<br />
perspective and after the working level discussion on this specific<br />
issue we will get a response from the Australian side.<br />
J: Robin Poke Voice of America. Just prior to APEC the President<br />
mentioned the possibility of North Korea becoming part of APEC, was<br />
that discussed between you either in Bogor or has it been discussed<br />
while you have both been in Canberra?<br />
PM: North Korea becoming part of APEC. It wasn't discussed in Bogor<br />
because the President and I didn't meet there bi-laterally, we only<br />
meet there in a multi-lateral context and new members were not<br />
discussed other than to say that the current membership of APEC<br />
thought that APEC needed to be consolidated before it opened itself<br />
up to new membership. As you know, Mexico and Papua New Guinea<br />
and Chile joined on this occasion, but I think, APEC members see a<br />
case for being a little abstemious about membership until we get some<br />
further consolidation of APECs work and that includes North Korea.<br />
J: many schemes to reduce tariffs between Korea and Australia<br />
especially for textile and automobile industries.<br />
PM: The President raised with me the trade imbalance between Korea and<br />
Australia. We are conscious of that trade imbalance, but we have<br />
taken uni-lateral steps to reduce our industrial protection. Australia<br />
will have an average level of trade weighted tariff protection of 3 per<br />
cent by the year 2000 which is not so far away and already tariffs are a<br />
long way down and there is no quota protection in this country. So, we<br />
are opening Australia up, but I think, Australia probably will be a raw<br />
materials supplier and a supplier of some specialised high technology<br />
goods and services to Korea and the likelihood is that that will keep<br />
the trade relationship in deficit. But, I have always seen as is the<br />
case with Japan a triangle of trade. That is Japan for instance enjoys<br />
we enjoy a very large surplus in trade with Japan, it enjoys a large<br />
surplus of trade with the United States, and the United States enjoys a<br />
large surplus of trade with us. Korea is in the exact same markets.<br />
The likelihood is that we will enjoy a surplus of trade with Korea.<br />
Korea, I think, enjoys a surplus with the United States and the United<br />
States certainly has a surplus with us and a heavy one.<br />
But, because the President and I have seen the virtue of opening up<br />
trade in the Pacific through APEC, we do see the possibility of letting<br />
markets equilibrate, to even themselves out, and this is the best<br />
approach we could take. </p>
<p>J: Prime Minister, a question for both you and the President. You<br />
mentioned the new Industry Investment Fund $ 500 million over three<br />
years from both of you in what specific industries and in what specific<br />
steps do you intend this fund, how do you intend it to operate?<br />
PM: We will probably begin, first of all looking at where we can co-operate<br />
industrially, but also in the initial period looking at the information<br />
super highway in ways that we can facilitate technology between us.<br />
As you know Australia is doing a lot of primary research into areas<br />
such as photonics, fibre optics and generally is encouraging the<br />
development of information products. I think, the President is also<br />
struck by Australia's atmospheric conditions and the question of clean<br />
energy comes to mind as one of the early things that we can cooperate<br />
on in terms of industrial projects given Korea's energy<br />
demands and the premium that President Kim places on the<br />
environment, that clean energy is perhaps one of the areas where we<br />
would first look under these arrangements, but at any rate I will ask the<br />
President to add to that.<br />
SAM: With regard to this issue we have exchanged our views fully,<br />
environmental issues, mineral supply and the long term staple supply*<br />
of energy all these issues have been discussed and we agreed to<br />
establish a joint fund to promote these activities and detailed Yes, I<br />
discussed with Prime Minister Keating in very much detail the c* ooperation<br />
in the areas of energy supply, high tech industries and<br />
mineral resources and environmental co-operation especially we are<br />
very much interested in having a stable long term supply of the energy<br />
sources from Australia and we have decided to leave the matter for<br />
further consultation between the related ministers of both countries.<br />
PM: We'll just have two final quick questions one from the Korean side<br />
next. No one from the Korean side? Australia.<br />
J: Camille Funnell Radio Australia. Was the issue of access of<br />
Australian beef to the South Korean market raised in the talks and<br />
secondly, there is also a suggestion that South Korea is not going to<br />
ratify the GATT legislation until after the US decides what it is going to<br />
do and was that issue raised?<br />
PM: The President and I are about to have lunch and we haven't at this<br />
stage discussed beef, but may well do over lunch. But, on the<br />
ratification let me make very clear that the President has very<br />
forthrightly, in the APEC context, spoken about ratification of the GATT<br />
and, indeed, the communique urges each member country of APEC to<br />
ratify the GATT, but that is a matter for him and I will ask the President<br />
would he answer that part of the question.<br />
SAM: I would like to tell you that we didn't discuss this time specifically the<br />
issue of import of Australian beef to Korea. Regarding the WTO<br />
ratification, the government policy is to actively support the launching </p>
<p>of the World Trade Organisation, but we are not in a hurry to rush to<br />
the ratification. Possibly, I think, that as you have mentioned we can<br />
ratify this important bill after the United States has confirmed the<br />
ratification. We are taking a very comfortable approach to the<br />
ratification, we don't like to hasten passage through the national<br />
assembly.<br />
PM: Any more questions from the Korean side?<br />
J: The Korean Minister of Trade Mr Kim Chul Su is going to run for the<br />
Secretary-General of WTO, I would like to know whether Mr Keating<br />
would support him or not?<br />
PM: We do, I made clear to him last evening that we would be supporting<br />
Kim Chul Su for the Chair of the World Trade Organisation. I thought<br />
originally the question was about the Organisation itself, but I am very<br />
happy to say that we are supporting your Korean candidate because<br />
we think it is important that these key positions in the world fora are<br />
not continued to be held by Europeans, that they are actually, these<br />
major positions, are spread around the world and particularly where<br />
most of the growth is in Asia, it is entirely appropriate that a person<br />
from Asia lead this liberalising body which has so much to offer the<br />
world and so much for our region.<br />
J: There was also the point about the United Nations Security Council.<br />
PM: On the Security Council, let me again say, I am happy to confirm that<br />
Australia supports Korea's position in respect of the Security Council<br />
and the President was kind enough to say at some point in the future<br />
when Australia puts up its hand we might have some support from<br />
Korea too. Ladies and gentlemen, could I finish our press conference<br />
there. Thank you very much for attending. I thank the President for<br />
his time.<br />
ends </p>
