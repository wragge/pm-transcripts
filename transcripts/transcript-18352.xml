I extend a very warm welcome to everyone gathered here today:</p>
<p>To those of you who are becoming Australian citizens and to those who have come to support you.</p>
<p>Not only your family and friends.</p>
<p>But complete strangers who have come to offer you their embrace, knowing that the gift of citizenship is a gift that grows with sharing.</p>
<p>Today is first time this ceremony has been held in this location, amidst some of our nation's greatest landmarks.</p>
<p>We look up ANZAC Parade to the shrine honouring those who served our country in the most profound way possible  -  with the sacrifice of their lives.</p>
<p>We look around the lake to great institutions of culture, learning and justice, beyond we see symbols of Australia's democracy in the old and new houses of parliament.</p>
<p>And just across the Commonwealth Avenue Bridge is Albert Hall where Prime Minister Chifley officiated at the very first Australian citizenship ceremony in 1949.</p>
<p>Today we live in very different times, but the meaning of this ceremony remains unchanged across six decades.</p>
<p>It is modern Australia's greatest story  -  the story of inclusion and belonging which is immigration; culminating in our free acceptance of the duties and benefits of citizenship.</p>
<p>Since that first citizenship ceremony in 1949, more than 4 million of us have chosen to officially call Australia home.</p>
<p>Those four million of us left behind the life we knew: loved ones, familiar places, language, culture.</p>
<p>A brave and often painful decision, but a good decision.</p>
<p>Because for whatever we left behind, we gained so much more.</p>
<p>Freedom and opportunity.</p>
<p>Reward for effort</p>
<p>And a land of wide open spaces, not just geographically but wide spaces of the mind and heart to dream big dreams and imagine different, better future free of fear.</p>
<p>Today you join a rich and enduring story, begun countless centuries ago by the First Australians and continued by we who came here to build a great nation â€˜with heart and hand'.</p>
<p>With the pledge you are about to make, you confirm in law what you have already accepted in your heart:</p>
<p>That is this your home  -  for you and your descendents forever.</p>
<p>And from all our different journeys, the Australian story has become our own. </p>
