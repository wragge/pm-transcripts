PRIME MINISTER 42/ 92<br />
FOR MEDIA<br />
STATEMENT FROM THE OFFICE OF THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
The Prime Minister regrets not being able to attend<br />
Saturday's celebrations in Townsville to mark the<br />
anniversary of the Battle of the Cofra-l Sea.<br />
There have been several Coral Sea commemorative events, some<br />
of which the Prime Minister has attended.<br />
Unfortunately, he is unable to attend all of them.<br />
Some time ago the Prime Minister was invited by the<br />
Australia-United States Coral Sea Council to attend the<br />
wreath-laying ceremony on Sunday, May 10 which has been<br />
designated an Event of National Importance.<br />
He agreed to attend this event.<br />
Contrary to some media reports the Prime Minister did not<br />
" promise" that he would be able to attend Saturday's events.<br />
When this office declined the invitation to Saturday's<br />
events it was explained that the reason for this was the<br />
need for the Prime Minister to prepare for the special<br />
Premiers' Conference to be held on Monday May 11.<br />
It was also stressed that the Prime Minister deeply<br />
regretted not being able to attend the Townsville ceremonies<br />
but that this was unavoidable.<br />
