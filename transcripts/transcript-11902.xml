<p>E&amp;OE................................</p>
<p>Look I've just got a couple of things to say about this.</p>
<p>The first is that everybody knows that three months ago when this meeting took place, there was a lot of criticism of the way the Government was handling a number of issues. I accepted that criticism and the Government accepted that criticism. And what I set out to do and what the Treasurer set out to do was to respond to that criticism. To try and address areas of community concern. Political parties who don't listen to criticism, political leaders who don't listen to criticism are unrealistic and failing in their duties to the Australian public.</p>
<p>I will never be somebody who is unwilling to cop criticism. I will never be somebody who's unwilling to adjust to community concern. As far as the personalities in this are concerned, I want to say that I have full confidence in Shane Stone as Federal President. I have full confidence in Peter Costello. I admire the job that Peter has done with me in responding to areas of community concern and he's making a tremendous contribution to the Government.</p>
<p>And I'm now going to enjoy a very important evening. Thank you very much.</p>
