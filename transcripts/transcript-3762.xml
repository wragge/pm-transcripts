PRIME MINISTER Press Statement<br />
3 June 1975<br />
NEW URBAN ROAD PROJECTS<br />
The Werriwa electorate will benefit from new urban road<br />
projects which were recently approved by the Federal Transport<br />
Minister, Mr Jones.<br />
The Prime Minister and member for Werriwa, Mr Gough<br />
Whitlai said today that the 7 projects in the Werriwa area<br />
would cost an estimated $ 1,032,000 in 1974/ 75.<br />
He said that $ 158,000 would be spent on Elizabeth Drive,<br />
involving construction and widening to six lanes from Copeland<br />
Street to Maxwell Avenue, Liverpool. In Copeland Street<br />
$ 342,000 would go towards widening to six lanes the divided<br />
carriageway from Hinkler Avenue to Hoxton Park Road, Liverpool.<br />
A project in Cabramatta will improve Cabramatta Road West,<br />
with construction work to widen it to four lanes from Church<br />
Street to Gladstone Street, Cabramatta.<br />
Mr Whitlam said that the damaged bitumen pavement<br />
in Terminus Street from Scott Street to the Hume Highway<br />
in Liverpool would be reconstructed for $ 40,000.<br />
More than $ 450,000 will be spent on three projects<br />
improving sections of the Humne Highway in the area. Construction<br />
work will be carried out at the intersection with Cowpastures Road,<br />
Leppington. This will cost $ 90,000. Another $ 102,000 will<br />
go towards widening the Highway from Cross Roads to South Western<br />
Freeway. Mr Whitlam said that $ 250,000 would be spent on the<br />
construction of kerbside lanes and reconstruction of damaged<br />
pavement from Atkinson Street Liverpool to Cross Roads.<br />
He said that the urban roads program showed how determined<br />
the Australian Government was to help with improving the standard<br />
of Australia's roads wherever they happened to be. In this case<br />
the program had been worked out between the appropriate sections<br />
of the Australian and N. S. W. State Government. This showed just<br />
how practically useful such sensible co-operation could be.<br />
He said that the overall contribution by the Australian Government<br />
towards improved and updated transport in urban areas of N. S. W.<br />
woiald be over $ 59 million this financial year alone.<br />
