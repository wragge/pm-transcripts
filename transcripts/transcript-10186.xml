HEAD OF STATE DEBATE<br />
The government has commenced consideration of matters related to debate on<br />
Australia's head of state.<br />
When these deliberations, which will involve consultation with the Coalition joint<br />
party room and State Premiers, have been concluded a statement will be made.<br />
This is an important issue which requires careful consideration.<br />
The government remains steadfast in its commitment to fully involve the<br />
Australian people in this issue which is of such fundamental importance to our<br />
system of government.<br />
I note the comments made today by the Leader of the Opposition. The<br />
government seeks a constructive debate and will take into account the<br />
Opposition's latest position.<br />
As I have said a number of times, if Australia were to become a republic then<br />
such a change should occur in circumstances which unite the Australian people<br />
and not divide them.<br />
