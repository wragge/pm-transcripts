PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 7 August 1986<br />
JOINT PRESS RELEASE BY THE PRIME MINISTER AND THE CHIEF MINISTER<br />
OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORY, MR HATTON<br />
The Prime minister and the Chief Minister of the Northern<br />
Territory, Hir Hatton, today announced that a project to research<br />
and publish an Aboriginal Pharmacopoeia had been granted funding<br />
under the joint Commonwealth-State Bicentennial Commemorative<br />
Program. The Pharmacopoeia project involves the evaluation and<br />
documentation of Aboriginal traditional medicines and an<br />
assessment of their-use in modern health care. The project will<br />
make a major contribution to modern health care programs run by<br />
Aboriginal Health Workers and to the wider Australian community.<br />
The Aboriginal community will be actively involved throughout the<br />
project. Tihey will act as editorial advisers and artists, and<br />
Aboriginal holders of traditional herbal knowledge will<br />
participate in the gathering of information.<br />
Mr Hawke said that the Commonwealth was pleased to be associated<br />
with this distinctive and imaginative project.<br />
" The publication of an Aboriginal Pharmacopoeia captures the<br />
essence of the Bicentenary. The project entwines the threads of<br />
the past and the present. Traditional knowledge, born from the<br />
Aboriginals' long and intimate relationship with the earth, will<br />
be complemented by modern scientific methods and enquiry. The<br />
project is an exciting example of the theme of the Bicentenary,<br />
' Living Together'<br />
Mr Hatton said that the project would help safeguard knowledge of<br />
traditional herbal lore and contribute to modern health care.<br />
The Aboriginal Pharmacopoeia project will cost a total of<br />
$ 446,000, half of which will be contributed by each Government.<br />
Other projects in a joint program valued at some $ 5 million in<br />
current prices are currently being developed by the Northern<br />
Territory Government in consultation with the Commonwealth<br />
Government and are expected to be announced progressively over<br />
the next 12 months. -1, A&gt; UOSYT1VRWALO I_ A&amp;,&amp; </p>
