EMBARGO: 9630PM MOND) AY 17 SEPTEMBER 1973<br />
-SPECHBY THE PRIME MINISTER MR. E. G. WHITLAM, M. P.,<br />
TO THE ANNUAL DINNER~ OF THE AUSTRALIA. N ELECTRICAL MANUFACTURERSt<br />
ASSOCIATION, LAKESIDE INTERNATIONAL HOTEL, CANBERRA,<br />
MOND~ AY 17 SEPTEMBER 1973<br />
Your convention is the second of two conventions I have<br />
attended in the past fortnight. Yours is an annual event; the<br />
Constitutional Convention occurs with roughly the frequency of<br />
Halley's Comet. The last one was 82 years ago. I notice that one<br />
of our magazines published a photograph of me on its cover the<br />
other day, purporting to show me in the midst of that distinguished<br />
company in a state of unaccustomed somnolence. All I can say is<br />
that this convention promises to be a more electrifying occasion than<br />
that one. This is by no means my first speech to a manufacturers'<br />
dinner. Two weeks ago I spoke to the Chamber of Manufactures in<br />
Sydney. Next Friday I shall be speaking to the South Australian<br />
Chamber of Manufactures, and next Monday to the Heavy Engineering<br />
Manufacturers' Association here in this hotel.<br />
Now whatever you may think of the Government, I can hardly<br />
be accused, in these circumstances, of snubbing the manufacturers.<br />
My only fear is that you will grow weary of hearing the same message<br />
five times in succession. So let me assure you that tonight's speech<br />
is a completely new model there's no wasteful proliferation of<br />
speeches in qy department. My real difficulty is that two weeks from<br />
tonight I shall be speaking yet again to the Chamber of Manufactures<br />
in Brisbane. I shall have to tell them what I have already told<br />
manufacturers in the southern States. You will understand, of course,<br />
that it always takes a little longer to get our message through to<br />
Queensland. If I may be permitted a truism, gentlemen, we live in changing<br />
times. When I spoke earlier this year to the Metal Trades Industries<br />
Association in Melbourne, we were about to introduce the 25% cut in<br />
tariffs which we announced in July. When I spoke to the Chamber of<br />
Manufactures in Sydney just over a fortnight ago, we had just brought<br />
in our Budget. Now, as I speak to you tonight, we have just announced<br />
a further revaluation of the dollar, a new policy by the Reserve Bank<br />
towards Government securities and interest rates, and, more recently,<br />
our intention to submit to the Australian people a referendum to give<br />
the national Government power over prices. You can see the hazards<br />
of going to too many businessmen's dinners. Basic to all our economic<br />
measures are two clear and simple purposes, two consistent and<br />
overriding aims to stimulate a more vigorous and competitive climate<br />
in Australian industry, and to stem inflationary pressures in the<br />
economy0 </p>
<p>-2-<br />
Let me speak first about inflation. One thing I caution you<br />
against and caution the Au stralian people against is a sterile<br />
obsession with inflation such as our opponents seem determined to<br />
foster. Inflation is not the sole issue for the Australian Government;<br />
the be-all and end-all of economic management. Exaggerated fears may<br />
be as damaging as inflation itself by encouraging defeatism and<br />
timidity, be encouraging a needless, heedless rush to put up prices<br />
against the vague possibility of competitors doing likewise. I would<br />
hate to see the price structure become as irrational, as psychologically<br />
vulnerable, as fickle a feature of our economic life as dare I say itthe<br />
share market. I appeal to you to keep the whole issue of prices<br />
in perspective, to bear in mind that Governments throughout the world<br />
face the same problem that we do, that my Government is determined and<br />
pledged to do all in its power to restrain inflationary pressures0<br />
We shall do this with or without the assistance of the States, with<br />
or without the assistance of our opponents. But we shall do it, I<br />
believe, with the assistance and concurrence of the Australian people.<br />
In our attack on inflation I want to stress one thing above<br />
all: we are pledged to a program of reform and renovation of<br />
Australian society, we were elected to carry out that program, and<br />
we shall carry it out steadily, steadfastly as we have been doing<br />
since last December. It is all very well for our opponents to talk<br />
of curbing inflation. Their last and most notorious attempt to do so<br />
was the Budget of 1971/ 72. Statesmanslike as I always am on these<br />
occasions, I forbear to remind you who was the author of that document.<br />
But you all remember its consequences: stagnation, a paltry growth<br />
rate of 2 or the worst unemployment for 10 years, and, when our<br />
predecessors left office, the highest rate of inflation for 20 years.<br />
That was our inheritance. That was our lesson. You will all remember<br />
how my colleagues and I, when we were in opposition, were regularly<br />
accused by the previous Government of " calamity howling". Yet no one<br />
hawls calamity more than they do. At least they give us calamities<br />
worth howling about: We now have a strong demand for labour: growth<br />
at 7% and rising; and record profits. We have combined this strong<br />
and basically healthy economic situation with the most effective and<br />
far reaching program of economic reform ever undertaken in this country.<br />
We shall not, however, fight inflation with the methods of our opponents.<br />
We shall not throw away people's jobs, we shall not resort to clumsy<br />
stop-go economics,, we shall not renounce our commitments to the people<br />
of this nation and especially to the poor, the children, the sick,<br />
the migrants, the city-dwellers, the low and middle-income earners<br />
whose interests have been neglected so shamefully for so long.<br />
The weapons we have chosen to fight inflation are the same<br />
weapons with which we hope to achieve more competition and greater<br />
efficiency in Australian industry. There is one other weapon, however,<br />
which the Australian Government lacks, and which we shall ask the<br />
people to grant us. That is power to control prices. Our opponents<br />
are rece-nt converts to the idea of a prices and incomes policy. Not<br />
long ago they were saying such policies wouldn't work. For myself, I<br />
frankly confess that I have always had reservations about the value of<br />
price control powers reservations I have publicly acknowledged and<br />
explained. But I have no doubt and I believe the people will have<br />
no doubt that it is intolerable that Australia should be the only<br />
country in the western world whose Government is denied such powers,<br />
and which cannot use them if the need arises. Equally I have no doubt<br />
that if such powers are to be applied, they must be immediate,<br />
unchallenged, uniform in their application. </p>
<p>-3-<br />
The States have these powers. They have refused to exercise<br />
them; they have refused to refer them to us, either temporarily or<br />
permanently. They won't use them; they won't let anyone else use<br />
them. And with their allies in the national Parliament, they propose<br />
to campaign against the very suggestion that the people employers,<br />
employees, housewives, businessmen, manufacturers should be allowed<br />
to decide whether the national Government should have the powers<br />
or not. Yet these are the Premiers, these are the parties, who<br />
protest about inflation and whip up people's fears about it.<br />
If I were more cynical about these matters, I might be<br />
tempted to believe that our opponents had a vested interest in<br />
inflation, and hoped to confound the Government and weaken its<br />
nerve, I am sorry to disappoint them. We will not be dismayed.<br />
We will not be deflected. We will beat inflation, and beat it with<br />
measures that are fair, constructive and humane.<br />
The prices referendum bill which we introduced in Parliament<br />
today will be a test of the good faith and sincerity of our<br />
opponents. I hear some of them say that we ought to include incomes<br />
in the referendum. Well, of course, incomes are already fixed for<br />
the vast majority of Australians either by negotiation or arbitratio n.<br />
Apparently there are some people, until recently quite vociferous in<br />
defence of the arbitration system, who now lack faith in the ability<br />
and judgement of the Arbitration Commission. But let that pass. I<br />
have no doubt that if the people of Australia give us power to control<br />
prices, we can count, if necessary, on the responsible cooperation of<br />
the trade union movement in restraining wages and incomes. I give that<br />
assurance, Let there be no mistake about the persistence or the consistency<br />
with which I have approached the question of power over prices. At the<br />
opening of the Constitutional Convention just two weeks ago I first<br />
invited the Premiers to refer to the national Parliament the powers<br />
held by the States. I explained that the Australian Government could<br />
seek a constitutional change by referendum, but that this would take<br />
some months, depending upon the behaviour of the Senate. I said:<br />
" The Parliament can obtain the power by reference, by some<br />
or all State Parliaments. That is something which could<br />
be done in a matter of weeks. The reference of power could<br />
be permanent or temporary. If, however, the Governments<br />
in the two great States of New South Wales and Victoria,<br />
Governments which currently have a majority in both Houses<br />
of their Parliaments, decline to introduce a Bill, then<br />
the reference would be ineffective. I venture to say that<br />
without New South Wales and Victoria, it would be a largely<br />
futile exercise, while, with those two States alone referring,<br />
it could be made effective throughout Australia."<br />
On the following day, the Tuesday, I appealed again for a<br />
reference of these powers. It was all too clear, however, that<br />
nothing in the private or public responses of the Premiers of<br />
New South Wales, Victoria or Queensland gave any room for hope that<br />
they would do so. The position then is this:<br />
We have had a Premiers' Conference on inflation; we have had a<br />
Constitutional Convention. The States in this context, of course, </p>
<p>-4-<br />
I am referring to the anti-Labor States have bluntly refused to<br />
budge or co-operate. It is fruitless to ask them again. We can<br />
only appeal to the people. If our bill is passed this week, we can<br />
have a referendum within two months. Ar~ d by Christmas, I assure you,<br />
we shall have passed legislation to stabilise the growth of land<br />
prices throughout Australia. That will be our first and most important<br />
action if the referendum is carried.<br />
The measures we have taken against inflation revaluation,<br />
tariff cuts will have several important consequences. They will<br />
help keep down the price of imports, they will increase the supply<br />
of goods within Australia, they will reduce any artificial stimulus<br />
to capital inflow, they will stimulate competition. I suggest that<br />
Australian industry, because of strong domestic and world demand,<br />
and buoyant conditions in the rural sector, is well placed to absorb<br />
the effects of our revaluatio ns. Those industries which have special<br />
difficulties we stand ready to assist. And of course, we are assisting<br />
industry in much more positive and enduring ways.<br />
Look back on our decisions and actions since last December,<br />
and you will find our record replete with schemes and initiatives<br />
to benefit industry. Our Budget provided an estimated outlay of<br />
$ 145 million for assistance to industry in 1973-74, $ 34 million more<br />
than actual expenditure in the last financial year. We have increased<br />
assistance under the Industrial Research and Development Grant Scheme<br />
from $ 14 million to $ 16.8 million. We are encouraging higher standards<br />
of industrial design. We have provided $ 1.83 million for better<br />
apprenticeship training. We are developing new manpower policies to<br />
help industry adjust to changing needs and conditions. We are strengthening<br />
the Australian Industry Development Corporation to enable it to<br />
play its full part in developing local industry and keeping it in<br />
Australian hands. We are establishing an Industries Assistance<br />
Commission to coordinate all forms of assistance to industry and to<br />
open up the process of assistance to full public scrutiny. We are<br />
setting up industry panels bringing together employers, employees,<br />
consumers and Government to advise on a whole range of industrial<br />
problems. I do not pretend for a moment that our reforms will be painless,<br />
or that our plans to streamline and invigorate Australian industry do<br />
not involve quite basic structural changes and new attitudes on the part<br />
of us all. It is precisely because I have confidence in the -strength<br />
of indu-stry as well as its good sense and public-spiritedness<br />
that I believe our reforms will be welcomed and understood. Let me,<br />
however, give an example of the sort of practice my Government cannot<br />
tolerate. You will forgive me for choosing an instance that is<br />
uncomfortably, distressingly, close to home. I refer to an agreement<br />
made between five Australian manufacturers for the 12 months to last<br />
April. The agreement raised to an agreed level the minimum price of<br />
Japanese fans exported to Australia. It was entered into after<br />
negotiations between your own Association and the Japan Electrical<br />
Manufacturers' Association. The Commissioner of Trade Practices<br />
investigated the agreement and referred to it in these terms in<br />
his 1972-73 annual report: 00./ 5 </p>
<p>" I notified the parties that I considered the agreement<br />
was contrary to the public interest and should not be renewed when<br />
it expired in April 1973; the agreement had the effect of increasing<br />
the price of Japanese fans to Australian consumers and weakening<br />
external competition without any inquiry by the Tariff Board which<br />
has the responsibility of recommending the level of protection to<br />
which Australian manufacturers may be entitled against imports; in<br />
addition the agreement aggravated a shortage in the total supply<br />
of fans available to the Australian market which occurred in the<br />
unusually hot summer season."<br />
That is what the Commissioner of Trade Practices had to say,<br />
I am glad to record the fact that although your association tdisagreed<br />
with the Commissioner in good faith, the agreement in question was not<br />
renewed. Now I didn't come here to give lectures or to rake over past<br />
history, but I would be less than candid if I failed to make it clear<br />
to you that such agreements as that will not be tolerated by my<br />
Government. Under the restrictive practices legislation we shall<br />
introduce, that agreement would have been illegal. Under our<br />
legislation, consumers will not have to wait while the Commissioner<br />
investigates and makes a report. We shall take action to prohibit<br />
a great range of restrictive practices directly and immediately.<br />
Mr. Chairman, I have spoken bluntly to you. I know you would<br />
not want-from me, or my Government, anything other than straight talk<br />
and square dealing. Let me now tell you with equal candour, with<br />
equal conviction what my hopes are for your industry, and for all<br />
industry. First, we want ready and open communication with you. We<br />
want to hear from you and be involved in your problems. Next, we want<br />
your continued prosperity. Our whole program depends upon a healthy<br />
and prosperous business community. We want to encourage the<br />
transformation of weak, dependant industries into vigorous and more<br />
self-reliant ones, to help industries withstand the pressures of<br />
national change and international competition without the need for<br />
inordinate Government support. We want to encourage more competition,<br />
more rational use of resources, lower prices for the consumer. We see<br />
the growth of sound and healthy industry as basic to the growth of a<br />
modern industrial economy.<br />
Finally, I ask you to keep in mind your basic strength, your<br />
real and growing prosperity0 This year your sales have risen strongly,<br />
your exports have increased, your orders are high. It is fair to say<br />
that, despite rising costs and other pressures, Australian industry<br />
is in better condition today than it has ever been. What better time<br />
to undertake with the new Government, the lasting and far-reaching<br />
reforms that will ensure greater strength and prosperity in years to<br />
come? </p>
