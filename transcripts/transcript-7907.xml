PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 16 FEBRUARY 1990<br />
This morning I called upon the Governor-General and<br />
recommended that the House of Representatives be dissolved<br />
with a view to an election for the House of Representatives<br />
and half the Senate being held on Saturday, 24 March 1990.<br />
The Governor-General has accepted my recommendation.<br />
This election comes after the expiry of a full term of the<br />
current Parliament. With the exception of the 1984 election<br />
which restored the necessary synchronisation of the two<br />
Houses of Parliament, the elections I have called as Prime<br />
Minister have been at full term.<br />
Elections are the key to our democratic system. They<br />
perform the vital task of choosing a Government for the<br />
future. So I call upon all Australians to participate fully in the<br />
forthcoming campaign, both by thinking carefully about the<br />
issues that are at stake for the nation, and by exercising<br />
your democratic right to vote.<br />
The election on 24 March will resolve a basic question of<br />
vital importance to us all as individuals, as families and<br />
as a nation as we enter the 1990s.<br />
That question is, whether we continue forward as a<br />
community, creating a fair society, an efficient and<br />
productive economy and a healthy environment for ourselves<br />
and our children or whether we turn the clock back to the<br />
days of entrenched privilege, lost opportunities and<br />
environmental degradation.<br />
At the outset of the 1990s, Australians face a very clear<br />
choice. The comparisons between Labor and the conservatives<br />
are stark.<br />
Australians can decide to continue along the path of steady<br />
reform, so our country can be equipped to take full<br />
advantage of the exciting challenges of the twenty-first<br />
century. Or we can choose, under the conservatives, to sacrifice the<br />
opportunities and squib the challenges of the future, in a<br />
self-destructive and traumatic re-run of the failures of the<br />
early 1980s. </p>
<p>It is my most profound conviction that Australia's<br />
Government must continue to be a Government for all<br />
Australians a Government that will defend and enhance the<br />
real interests of the Australian nation.<br />
I seek re-election for a full fourth term as Prime Minister<br />
because I know that only Labor can provide such a<br />
Government. As the campaign progresses, my Ministers and I will be<br />
announcing a range of initiatives that will'demonstrate our<br />
capacity to build such an Australia through the 1990s.<br />
These initiatives will be progressive and practical, they<br />
will be relevant to the needs of Australians in the 1990s,<br />
and they will be fully funded.<br />
Next week the Treasurer, Mr Keating, will be revealing<br />
details of the next round of wage increases and any tax cuts<br />
negotiated between this Government and the trade union<br />
movement. This announcement will demonstrate anew our capacity to<br />
secure the long term interests of Australian families and<br />
individuals, and to do so in a way that best ensures the<br />
well-being of the national economy.<br />
Our political opponents have hastily cobbled together an<br />
industrial relations platform that would remove from the<br />
hand of the Federal Government the means to achieve such an<br />
outcome. That policy failure, and the essentially unfair commitment<br />
to abolish the capital gains tax, coming on top of their<br />
health fiasco and their $ 6 billion in unfunded pledges,<br />
demonstrate comprehensively that the Opposition has no<br />
legitimate claim to exercise the responsibility of national<br />
Government. So, too, does their philosophy of development<br />
at any price, which would bequeath to our children a barren<br />
legacy of a degraded environment.<br />
After seven years of Opposition, they still have failed to<br />
develop workable and effective alternative policies.<br />
That failure of course reflects their failure at the level<br />
of leadership.<br />
They remain the disunited band that was defeated in 1987.<br />
Their fatal flaws, if translated to Government, would cost<br />
the Australian people dearly.<br />
I believe that Australians, when they look closely at the<br />
records and qualifications of the two main political<br />
parties, will conclude that Australia needs a continuation<br />
of the stability and commonsense policies Labor has<br />
delivered so far. </p>
<p>Even those who wish to exercise their right to support<br />
independent candidates still have the responsibility, under<br />
our preferential system, of choosing a Government.<br />
They should recall that only a Labor Government united,<br />
stable has the breadth of concern that can truly encompass<br />
the aspirations of all Australians.<br />
Labor has proven that, for all the economic difficulties we<br />
face, it is possible to harness the skills and commitment of<br />
the whole community so as to advance our collective wellbeing.<br />
And we have shown we will stand firm against those who would<br />
harm or undermine that collective well-being.<br />
On the international stage, through the Cairns Group and our<br />
new forum for Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation, through<br />
our initiatives to protect Antarctica and to eliminate<br />
chemical weapons, and through our efforts to find a solution<br />
to the tragic conflict in Cambodia, Australia under Labor<br />
has been a creative and responsible leader in economic and<br />
political causes of profound importance for the 1990s.<br />
We simply cannot afford to slip back to the inflexibility<br />
and short-sightedness that still characterises the outmoded<br />
mindset of the Coalition parties.<br />
We know that these have been difficult times for many<br />
Australians, and we acknowledge the hardship that is being<br />
experienced. But there are no easy solutions just the promise that with<br />
a continuation of sensible policies and of committed hard<br />
work, national and individual economic conditions will<br />
gradually improve.<br />
As they improve, we will have the knowledge that they will<br />
be permanent improvements, because we will have made the<br />
right choices and done the hard work to guarantee<br />
sustainable prosperity for the future.<br />
And in the meantime, the Australian people know that Labor<br />
will not sacrifice for short-term political gain the values<br />
that are essential to our national interest stability;<br />
national self-confidence, growth that is ecologically<br />
sustainable, prosperity that is fairly shared.<br />
For the 1990s, Australians need and deserve no less. </p>
