PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR PRESS 22 SEPTEMBER 1978<br />
TRADE COMMISSION FOR THE SOUTH PACIFIC<br />
The South Pacific Forum has welcomed an Australian Government<br />
offer to finance the establishment in Australia of a Trade<br />
Commission for the South Pacific under Australia's aid<br />
programme. The off'er was made at the South Pacific Forum in Niue this<br />
week. Australia will fund and help set up a South Pacific Trade<br />
Commission, possibly located in Sydney. The Trade Commission<br />
will identify products from the island countries of the South<br />
Pacific Forum which can be successfully exported to Australia,<br />
and will provide commercial information and practical expertise<br />
to aid the islands' marketing efforts.<br />
It will also help Australian companies make contact with island<br />
governments and private companies in connection with other<br />
Australian trade and industry-oriented development programmes<br />
designed to help the islands.<br />
Australia has suggested that the Trade Commission'be run under<br />
the auspices of the South Pacific Bureau for Economic Cooperation<br />
( SPEC) and is prepared to make up to $ 150,000 available on an<br />
annual basis for an initial five-year period to meet the<br />
Commission's expenses. The Forum has requested the Director<br />
of SPEC to enter into consultations with Australia on practical<br />
arrangements. The proposal reflects Australia' s concern that the islands<br />
should not be handicapped in using existing market opportunities<br />
in Australia because of lack of representation or practical<br />
experience and expertise.<br />
The offer to fund a Trade Commission has been made in an effort<br />
to overcome these problems.<br />
The ability to market competitively is one of the main factors<br />
affecting the islands' development prospects. Some 97 percent<br />
of island products imported in Australia currently enter on a<br />
duty free basis. </p>
