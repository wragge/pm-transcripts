FCR PRESS: PM No. 6/ 1971<br />
CONGRATULATIONS TO NEW C. P. LEADERS<br />
Commentby the Prime Minister, Mr. John Gorton<br />
My warmest congratulations to Mr. Anthony on his election<br />
as Leader and to Mr. Sinclair on his election as Deputy Leader of<br />
the Country Party.<br />
Mr. Anthony is a worthy successor to Sir John McEwen, and<br />
I am sure that under the new leadership there will be a continuation of<br />
the special relationship that has been a feature of the coalition for so<br />
many years.<br />
