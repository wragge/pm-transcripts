" MEE~ T THE PRESS"<br />
Ztjeyision InterviewL givenu by-tbg Prime Minlister~ the Rt. Hon.<br />
R. G. Menzies. on Channel TCN. Sydney onSunday_,*" th November,<br />
MR. McNICOLL:<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Q.<br />
P. M,<br />
Q.<br />
Pam. Good evening Ladies and Gentlemen, We are<br />
very honouxed to have as our guest this evening,<br />
the Prime Minister of Australia, the Rt. Hon.<br />
R. G. Menzies. Mr. Prime Minister, good evening.<br />
The members of our panel Mr. John Gibbs, who<br />
is financial editor of the tSunday Telegraph," l<br />
Mr. Alan Reid, whom you well know from Canberra,<br />
and Mr, King Watson, the Editor of the " Daily<br />
Telegraph." Mr. Prime Minister are you satisfied<br />
that we are spending enough money on defence?<br />
I think so. I think that the programme announced<br />
the other day by Mr. Townley is pretty good.<br />
It represents some increase, and will represent<br />
a little more as the next three years go on.<br />
But the essence of it is a well-balanced programme<br />
and, of course, it is a flexible programme, It<br />
is not to be assumed that, because you have a<br />
three years' programme that you are unable to<br />
alter it in case some new circumstances blow up.<br />
WJe are hoping we will not have new circumstances.<br />
You are ignoring the motives that may have prompted<br />
it. What do you think of Dr. Cairn's suggestion<br />
that the two Parties should come together on the<br />
volume of taxation that should be devoted to<br />
de fence spending?<br />
Wll, 1 it is very interesting to me to gather<br />
that Dr, Oairns thinks we ought to spend more<br />
money on defence, because I have been under the<br />
exactly opposite impression for years. But I<br />
think the Government will take its own responsibility<br />
on that matter, Certainly, until recently,<br />
we were spending far more money on de-fence than<br />
our opponents wanted to spend. They appear to<br />
have had a change of heart recently.<br />
Would increased spending at this stage on defence,<br />
in view of the expanding economy, retard the<br />
development of that economy?<br />
Well, I think it would. But, of course, there<br />
are times when you have to prefer defence to<br />
development, but there is no occasion, at this<br />
time, to sacrifice one for the other. The truth<br />
is that to spend substantially more on defence,<br />
and I don't mean a few millions, but a very large<br />
sum more, would mean more manpower devoted to<br />
defence, more resources devoted to defence, and<br />
therefore less manpower and less resources<br />
available for other matters and what we have had to<br />
do, and it has been a very aifficult task, is<br />
to balance the urgent need for increasing the<br />
population and resources of the nation against<br />
the undoubted need to have an effective defence<br />
force. oeseeece. e/ 2 </p>
<p>-2<br />
Qo Some people talk about our defence in terms of an<br />
anrms race witL Indco sia9 Is this the way the Government<br />
sees the problem?<br />
P. M2 It never occurred to us. We have had a three years<br />
programme operating, and we are now having another<br />
three years programme. It has no relations to some<br />
arms race with Indonesia. It is all related by what<br />
is regarded by our competent advisers, as the nature<br />
of the th. re&amp; t, our strategic position, and emphasis<br />
upon having forces which are available immediately and<br />
can be made mobile and be made effective in a few days,<br />
In the past we have had a capacity for producing soldiers,<br />
but it has taken months to put them into the fi. eld<br />
We, for the first time in time of peace, have permanent,<br />
professional, ready, well-armed and highly-trained<br />
mobile forces.<br />
Q, Is our state of preparedness much better than it was<br />
in 1913 and 1939?<br />
P. M. When I look back on 1939, when I was Prime Minister<br />
for the first time in April, 1939, I think it vas, our<br />
defences today are much more powerful.<br />
QC To what extent, Sir, could we rely upon America in<br />
the event of a crisis in this part of the world?<br />
P. M. If the crisis consists of an attack upon us, and that<br />
includes Australian New Guinea and Papua then I would<br />
have no doubt whatever thab America would instantly<br />
come to our assistance, I am happy to say we stand<br />
very well with the United States of America. They<br />
regard us as their friends, and even though they are<br />
a very great country, and we are a very small country<br />
comparatively, history shows that great countries like<br />
to have some friends, even small ones.<br />
Q. One point is how the outside world views our safety,<br />
Is the amount of capital investment coming in?<br />
Has there been any diminution in the flow in recent<br />
months? No, there has not. In fact right through the somewhat<br />
controversial period in Australia, the capital has<br />
kept flowing in. You are quite right when you suggest<br />
that this exhibits confidence in our future which,<br />
of course, must include confidence in our future<br />
security,<br />
Q. But, Sir, how is that capital made up? Is it capital<br />
investment into factories, or is it investment money<br />
going into, say buying shares in BHoP. Have you<br />
any figures on that which would guide us?<br />
PoM. Well, I can't give you a percentage, but as you know,<br />
it is a bit of each. Portfolio investments I think,<br />
rose in proportion some little time ago, but I would<br />
have thought that, overall, looking back over a term<br />
of eight or nine years, the bulk of this money has been<br />
for investment in industryo </p>
<p>.3<br />
An'd do you thinlc that there is any . ot money, mcAcy<br />
that may come Jin temporarily, an-Ld goes out again?<br />
T,. M0 I donvt think there is very much hot money, There is<br />
some, of course which is the product of credit buying at<br />
a time of imporz restrictions, eana so on. But I think the<br />
quantity of that has fallen away considerably. I am quite<br />
certain that the great bulk of what we call new capital<br />
money coming into Australia is not just for portfolio<br />
not hot money, but is for direct Investment in Australian<br />
industry.<br />
Q. A. L. P. policy demands a nuclear-free Southern Hemisphere,<br />
Is this in the rea2! nof practical politics with you, Sir?<br />
P. M. Well, quite frankly, from the * point of view of Australia,<br />
it is the craziLest proposal that I have ever heard,<br />
Why, Sir?<br />
P. M. Beceause they say " We want a nuclear-free zone. No<br />
nuclear weapons are to be installed or used in the<br />
Southern Hemisphere, south of the Equator." Now, here<br />
we are. America i~ s our friend and our ally under the<br />
ANZUS Pact, and you have places like Manus, soutK of<br />
the Equator, all included in the Labc-Ir resolution. Are<br />
we to say to the United States of America " Look, we<br />
want to tell you that under no circumstances, if you have<br />
to fight alongside us and for us, under no circumstanices<br />
can you use nuclear weapons, or fire one off from<br />
Australian soil, or from any place south of~ the Equator."<br />
What do you suppose the Americans would say? I know very<br />
well what they would say., This is a suicidal policy.<br />
We do not want to be a nuclear power ourselves if we can<br />
avoid it, I personally believe that the fewder countries<br />
that have nuclear weapons, the better. There is less<br />
chance of an accident and, therefore, I stood out against<br />
it and so has my Government in the case of Australia.<br />
But the question of our defence arises in its crucial form<br />
if we are attacked. If we are at war. And to say to the<br />
most powerf'ul. ally we have in the world " Don't you come<br />
here with guided nuclear missiles. Don't you come here to<br />
defend us, You keep away with those things. We won't<br />
have them" this is the policy of suicide,<br />
Q. In -view of the Chinese-Indian instance, would you accept<br />
an assurance from mainland China on nuclear weapons<br />
without adequate supervis-ion?<br />
P. M. Noi Noi I am getting old, I know, but have not become<br />
so decrepit as to accept assurances from those sourcgs, 0<br />
Q. Mr. Prime Minister, over the last week there has been the<br />
greatest interest in Cuba. Do you regard it personally<br />
as a great coup for Mr. Kennedy, the outcome of the Cuban<br />
missile trouble?<br />
P. M. I think, if I may sayr so, that we ought to avoid claiming<br />
something as a coup. I do not think that our relations,<br />
or hi s relations with tChe Soviet Union e by any means<br />
conclusive, This is just his first move, and a very<br />
successfuil one. But, I think we don't want to get into<br />
the atmosphere of saying, " Ah. Khrushchev was compelled to<br />
do this or that." And yet we know that when President<br />
Kennedy made this dramatic announcement, there were quite<br />
a few people around the world, maybe even some here, who<br />
said " Oh this is a very dangerous thing. This is<br />
brinkmanshIp" or whatever the word is. We in the Cabinet<br />
0 0 0 a. 00/ 1+ </p>
<p>-1<br />
POMO<br />
( Contd,) h~ appened to be sittiLng when this news arrived and I at<br />
once afterwards in the House, as you know, made a statement<br />
stanaing behind this statemen6 by ]) resident, Kennedy. It's<br />
very interesting to realise that it was the first statement<br />
of support he had from anywhere, and I think that we did<br />
not lose marks by our promptness on that matter. The<br />
second thing is that, ' uc. doubtedly, this display of firmness<br />
was the thing that has been needed for a long time,<br />
I have had a theory, based upon knowing something of<br />
Khrushchev that the air would begin to clear the first<br />
time he had sitting opposite to him, metaphorically or"<br />
physically, a man of immense powEr, who must be the<br />
President of the United States, who could say to him,<br />
" This is not to happen. If it does then the consequences<br />
will be yours,'" My theory is that the first time that<br />
happened and he believed what the man said, we would begin<br />
to see a little light in the gloom, and that is what<br />
happened here.<br />
In that case, following that through, do you think that<br />
possibly, while it was terribly dangerous for a while,<br />
and a very anxious time for everybody,, that the seare<br />
the people have had, that the next time the big powers<br />
make the next moves, especially America and the U. S. S. R.<br />
and meet on the question of disarmament and nuclear testing<br />
and so on that they may be more inclined to make some<br />
progress towards the road to disarmament?<br />
P. M. I am not without hopes that this may be so because, you<br />
see, the Soviet resistance to the proposals about nuclear<br />
testing has really been outrageous. Everybody else wants<br />
to get rid of nuclear testing, to bring about this business<br />
of fuirther development in this field to an end. Everybody<br />
does, But, of course, naturally, the Western Powers want<br />
to have a system of inspection bothi ways, But, as you<br />
know, you cannot take some people's word very easily, and<br />
as the Russians said " Noth1ing doing." They may perhaps<br />
change their minds now.<br />
Q. So you had the opportunity now to to meet and have<br />
discussions with Mr. Kennedy on three or four occasions.<br />
What is your opinion of him? Is it growing all the time?<br />
P. M. I think so. I saw a considerable amount of him a year<br />
ago 15 months ago and then this year I have twice had<br />
considerable talks with him, and I think he grows in<br />
statuire all the timo. It is impertinent of me to talk<br />
about the President of the United States but, still, I<br />
have met a lot of people in thae course of my life, and<br />
I have some reason to wrork up an opinion about them.<br />
I like Kennedy very mucht, and I respect his intelligence<br />
very much and I think he is a man of courage and this<br />
is a pretty good combination, intelligence and courage.<br />
Q. Apparently he has a rather remarkable wife?<br />
P. M. I have never had the pleasure of either seeing her or<br />
meeting her,,<br />
Q. Have you not?<br />
P. OM. But our Ambassador tells mne she is charming.<br />
Q&amp; Australia's balance oii payments in the September quarter<br />
showed a deficit of Å C90 million or more, and this included<br />
the invisible, of course, and imports rising, and most<br />
people in the trade expect that, as the economic recovery<br />
continues in Australia we may get more imports., Does this<br />
suggest that we may have another balance of payments<br />
crisis? </p>
<p>1"<br />
o, I don't th. in. so. We thought;, and am sure you<br />
h thought in all relevant t; iomes in the past year,<br />
as the econcmic position strengthened9 there would be<br />
an increase in imports. It inevitably happens that way<br />
particularly remembering that a good proportion of our<br />
imports consist cf materials for local manufactures in<br />
Australia, Therefore, it is no su.-prise to find that<br />
imports have been rising. But the rise in the imports<br />
has not reflected itself fully as you know in the<br />
overseas reserves, because of this remarkable inflow of<br />
capital to Australia, But there is no doubt about it<br />
that the tendency for imports to rise is, I think, a<br />
continuing one when the country is well and happy, and<br />
therefore our great problem is to do what we can o<br />
stimulate exports in order to cut down the difference.<br />
Q. With this expansion, Sir, the banks have been a bi. t<br />
confused lately over the Bank Act, There has been a<br />
calling up of the extra depcsits into frozen funds.<br />
Some banks have apparently seemed to feel that this is<br />
a contradiction, and they adopt the attitude that if<br />
we are going to expand, we need all the credit, so why<br />
call up the funds?<br />
P. M. I do not want to become involved in a tectLnical argument<br />
with an expert, but the banks have been, and are,<br />
extremely liquid. No bank would deny that. There is a<br />
very fine state of liquidity. A very high percentage,<br />
and therefore they have a very high capacity to make<br />
advances. Porhaps some of the weakening of confidence<br />
in the last twelve months has reflected itself in the<br />
fact that people who could got finance from the banks<br />
have not done so. This is a weakness of confidence on<br />
the part of the customer, not on the part of the banks.<br />
But, still, they are very liquidWell now, the Reserve<br />
Bank it has the power to call up special reserve<br />
deposits, and it is intended to exercise this power to<br />
maintain a general control over the credit position.<br />
That is what a Central Bank is for, as you will agree.<br />
How, this time they have made a call. Not a big one.<br />
Relatively speaking, a small one. We gave some thought<br />
thi3, because we were informed as to what the Bank<br />
proposed. I can tell you my own view, which was the view<br />
of the Government on this occasion. We have been accused<br />
in the past, I. n 1960, of delayi. ng, and then doing something<br />
too big and too sudden. This time, let us learn from that<br />
experience. Don't let us quarrel about giving the economy<br />
a little nudge occa3ionally and this is a nudge, It is<br />
better to do a little bit at a time and see the effect,<br />
than to save it up until perhaps the autumn of next year,<br />
and then come out with a call to S. R. D. ( Special Reserve<br />
Deposits) three times as big as the one that has just<br />
been made. I think the lesson I have learned from all<br />
these things is that it is better to do things a little<br />
at a time, at the right time, than to delay them for<br />
reasons of the kind you have just mentioned, and then<br />
find yourself compelled to take some much more severe<br />
action if you are going to keep the economy on an even<br />
keel, No, I would not quarrel with what the banks have<br />
done at all.<br />
From what you have said, Sir, some people may interpiet<br />
the fact that your action is precautionarybut it also<br />
indicates that the Government is very confident at the<br />
moment that this recovery and expansion is going to move<br />
along at a pretty fast rate perhaps, what in a few<br />
months? o o. oo../ 6 </p>
<p>P. M. I thixn c that the recovery is going along very well0 I<br />
know there are diffevences of opinions on this matter,<br />
but all the industries that we have indicate that there<br />
is a very considerable and marked recovery, and everybody<br />
wants that to continue, but nobody with whom I have had<br />
discussions business or otherwise, wants it to develop<br />
into an inflationary boom. And that is why, instead of<br />
waiting for some highly inflationary circumstances to<br />
arise, it is a very good thing to do whatever little<br />
dampening down has to be done at the right time. But<br />
we want a high level of prosperitVr, a rising level of<br />
prosperity, but we don't want the conditions that existed<br />
in 1960 to recur nor does any panel of business or<br />
financial men with whom I have had. discussions,<br />
Q. If you were a doctor, Sir, and Australia was your patient,<br />
and you were running the measure over your patient, would<br />
you say that the patient internally was now in a healthy<br />
condition?<br />
P. MO I think so. Very healthy indeed, and if I were a dcctor<br />
which, my dear boy, Heaven forfend, because the patient<br />
would be dead the thing I would be afraid of about this<br />
very healthy patient of mine would be that we must not let<br />
him run into a high blood pressure,<br />
Q. I am sorry to hark back on the question of funds, Mr.<br />
Prime Minister, but there is one other point which I think<br />
should be cleared up. In England, the Bank of England<br />
recently reduced the amount called up into their equivalent<br />
to our from two per cent to one per cent. and they<br />
pay, I think, four per cent. interest on this money. Now,<br />
this one per cent. rise of ours has increased our percentage<br />
to 11 per cent. on which we pay, I think, three-quarters of<br />
one per cent. Why the discrepancy?<br />
P. M. Why draw an analogy between our condition and the condition<br />
in Great Britain?<br />
Q. I thirk the banks draw the analogy, I think they think they<br />
tave been hardly done by.<br />
P. M. This is permissible as a delating point, but the position<br />
of the United Kingdom is affected by her own balance of<br />
payments problem, h: 4 oni circumstances just as ours are<br />
by our own circumstances, and you can't identify thiese<br />
circ-amstanceso<br />
Q. If, Sir, our circumstances improve, does that suggest that<br />
the banking system might re. eive that overhaul, or flexibilit;<br />
that was referred to early this year as far as fixed<br />
deposits are concerned, and the call-up into the<br />
Is there likely to be a more flexible attitude toward the<br />
banks?<br />
P. M. I think you can take it that the door is always open for<br />
that. We had extremely useful discussions with the trading<br />
banks, who were most helpful on this matter early this<br />
year, or earlier this year, and we certainly will be very<br />
happy at any time to discuss in the light of the circumstances<br />
from time to time,<br />
Q. Do you think they are capable of handling their own lending<br />
operations? We have seen the release of funds to the banks.<br />
We know that they have increased the limits and approved<br />
new overdrafts, but the public has not taken them up. Do<br />
you think they are competent to operate and supervise the<br />
proper lending of funds? / 7 </p>
<p>-i<br />
FP0M. T. u* O. I have thFa greatest respect for the capacity of the<br />
trading banks to do these things', and We don't want -to<br />
in~ terfere in tho exercise of their own discretion and<br />
experience. They know far more about it than we do sitting<br />
in a room at Canberra., We are concerned with what I would<br />
call the wholesale aspect of credit. They are concerned<br />
with the retail use of it. But, in that field, they are<br />
the masters as far as I am concerned.<br />
Q8 Is your slim majority in the House of Representatives giving<br />
you much worry, Mr. Prime Ministe:-?<br />
P. M, That is the only slim thing about me. No. You know, it<br />
is very interesting. I am by way of being an expert on<br />
this matter, because I once had a majority of half of one,<br />
That is to say, an Independent, years and years ago. A<br />
majority of one is not a bad majority, as long as everybody<br />
is present and correct and your team is in good order<br />
and enthusiastic, and i must say that the morale among my<br />
own members has been superb. I really have not had any<br />
worry about our Parliamentary position the whole of the<br />
year. In fact, my opponent, my friend, Arthur Calwell<br />
he is a friend of mine complained one day that I was<br />
behaving as if I still had a majority of 32. Iasee<br />
that that was just how I feel.<br />
Q. I understand that Dame Pattie thinks that you have never<br />
felt better in your life, and that it has added ten years<br />
to your life having this slim majority. Is that right?<br />
P. M. Well, sho knows me better thean I knaow myself, but I<br />
would~ n't deny it, I always9 I think, if I may-say so,<br />
do best in difficulties, and I have had them,<br />
Q. Sir, reverting to the economic one, If your guided<br />
optimism, and the optimism of your Labour Minister, Mr,<br />
McMahon, over the placement of school leavers is<br />
unjustified is the Government prepared to take measures<br />
to get a raze of absorption that will ultimately, within<br />
a discern-ible -oeriod, absorb them?<br />
P. M. Now, that is an easy question to answer. After all,<br />
as you know, tU'his is true under our predecessors, it is<br />
true under us, and will be true under our suCcessors.<br />
You m'rist ha-v. e some rise in the number of people applying<br />
for work in Januaiy and February, because you are going to<br />
have wliatever the number may be 50, 60 or 70 thousand<br />
people leaving school, and the moment they register,<br />
they appear on the nominal unemployment list and, therefore,<br />
you will always have a little rise, perhaps a big one,<br />
in January, the real test. Now, this is what happens a<br />
couple of months thereafter when these have been absorebed.<br />
My colleague Mr0McMahon, is justifiably proud of the<br />
fact that quite shortly after the last January and February<br />
flush, the bulk of those school-. leavers, the great bulk,<br />
had been absorbed into employment, and he is very confident<br />
that that problem can be handled more easily this year,<br />
and I would share th~ at confidence, because I believe that<br />
the morale of the manufacturing and business community<br />
is rising. I know there are still a few people that have<br />
some complaints, naturally, But the general improssion<br />
I get and, indeed, I got it the other night at the<br />
Chamber of Manufactures Dinner, is that -there is a good<br />
state of optimism, a good disposition to look forward, and<br />
a good disposition to realise that there is no occasion<br />
to be gloomy about the future, Those things, of course,<br />
wi.]. l translate themselves into productive activity, increased<br />
business in the re-tail stores the whole line running back<br />
to the manufacturors. All this affects the tertiary industries<br />
transport and so on, I share the optimism of Mr.<br />
McMah~ n, </p>
<p>8'<br />
Q, How about outside Australia, Sir? What about replacing<br />
soe of these markets that we are likely to lose with the<br />
Common Market discussions?<br />
P. M. Well, I think that this is of the first importance. I<br />
think that increasingly well, let us put it this way:<br />
there are two tasks here. As far as the Government is<br />
concerned, we have been trying to do it for years, to<br />
provide certain financial means and so on, for assisting<br />
the development of exports, particularly in manufactured<br />
goods where there is such a fertile field for purchase in<br />
South-East Asia. But the other th'ng relates to the other<br />
responsibility, that of industry itself, because we are<br />
always a little bit disposed in a conservative way, to say<br />
that the things we make which can sell in our own country<br />
must be the things that other people ought to buy if we<br />
send them to another country. That is not necessarily<br />
true, We want to diversify our production. I think<br />
there is an immense amount of room for the application of<br />
scientific research to manufacturing procedure and products<br />
so that, if it turns out that Thailand wants a particular<br />
type of thing which is readily saleable, we should put<br />
ourselves in a position to make it. There is a great<br />
challenge here for Australian industry which is eminently<br />
capable of meeting it so long as it does not think too<br />
constantly that the development of export markets is a<br />
matter for the Government alone,<br />
Q. Well that suggests what has been mentioned lately.<br />
People have been thinking we may have an inferiority<br />
complex, that we cannot match people in these overseas<br />
markets,<br />
P. M. Well, if we have, we ought to get rid of it, An inferiority<br />
complex is, anyhow, a silly thing,<br />
Q. Do you think that this present impasse in the Common<br />
Market talks is put down to the fact that Britain is not<br />
very happy about the insistence of the other countries on<br />
her cutting out her subsidies to her farmers. Do you<br />
think that there is any element of hope in it of Mr. Heath<br />
pushing some of the things that we have asked him to push<br />
for us, or is it purely his domestic matter?<br />
P. M. Well, you know those have been rumours that have been<br />
published. I am quite certain myself that some of his<br />
greatest difficulties at present arise from his pushing<br />
our vie: s on the temperate products that concern us and,<br />
I am sure, he is doing this very well. But whether Great<br />
Britain has improved her negotiating position by the events<br />
of the last week or two, I do not know, because the Government<br />
seems to have made it overwhelmingly clear that it is<br />
going in. Well, I respect that view. I do not want t,<br />
repeat what I have said about it. But it did not strike me<br />
as being as strong in a negotiating position as some I<br />
have seen occupied by the Government of the United Kingdom,<br />
Q, Are any moves by the U. So likely to help us replace the<br />
losses that could emerge from Britain's entry into the<br />
E. C. M.?<br />
PoM, The new trade law which President Kennedy has now got<br />
through Congress, and which gives him a discretion to<br />
