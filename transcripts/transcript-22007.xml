    <content><![CDATA[<p>I am pleased to announce a significant Australian assistance package aimed at supporting Pacific states to counter the significant threats posed by Avian Influenza and other infectious diseases.</p>
<p>Australia will provide support of $8 million over four years.  The assistance will contribute to the work being undertaken by the Secretariat of the Pacific Community and the World Health Organisation, both of which are now playing pivotal roles assisting Pacific Island countries and territories with pandemic preparedness.</p>
<p>  Australian funds will strengthen regional and national capacity to respond rapidly and effectively to emerging diseases.  This will be achieved through the strengthening of national and regional quarantine systems, infection prevention and control programmes, and animal health surveillance systems.</p>
<p>Australia's assistance will be coordinated through the Pacific Public Health Surveillance Network which is a part of the Secretariat of the Pacific Community.  Australia supports the Network through its current core funding of the Secretariat of the Pacific Community.</p>
