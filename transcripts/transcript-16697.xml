    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Australian Government is acting to conserve and maintain the graves and memorials of eminent Australians both here and overseas. Until now, there has been no significant Australian Government program to provide funds for the conservation of overseas graves or memorials of Australian citizens who have made significant contributions to the nation and the world. Up to $100,000 a year will be made available from the Department of the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts for the conservation of overseas graves and memorials. This move has been prompted by the recent restoration of the grave of the acclaimed Queensland and Australian aviator Bert Hinkler in Florence, Italy. This grave was restored using funds raised by the Hinkler House Memorial Museum and Research Association, a volunteer body which does not have the capability to ensure the ongoing maintenance of the grave. The Australian Government thanks volunteer groups like the Hinkler House Memorial Museum for their dedication to conserving memorials to significant Australians. It is appropriate that the Australian Government has a formal avenue to consider funding requests for the conservation of graves and memorials of eminent Australian citizens buried here and overseas. The funding will come from existing resources within the Department.</p>
