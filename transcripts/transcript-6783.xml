JOINT STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON RJL HAWKE, AC MP<br />
AND THE PREMIER OF NEW SOUTH WALES. THE HON NK WRAN, QC MLA<br />
SYDNEY, 17 NOVEMBER 1985<br />
NAVY TO MOVE FROM PRIME SYDNEY WATERFRONT SITE<br />
The largest waterfront site occupied by the Defence Force in<br />
Sydney is to be relinquished by the Commonwealth for<br />
qivilian use in the early 1990s.<br />
This was announced jointly by the Prime Minister, Mr. Hawke,<br />
and the NSW Premier, Mr Wran, at a news conference on board<br />
HMAS Adelaide in Sydney today.<br />
The site, which covers about 260 hectares on the Parramatta<br />
River at Silverwater, presently houses the Navy's Newington<br />
Ammunition Depot which is to be moved: to the Jervis Bay<br />
area. Mr Hawke and Mr Wran said the site would be redeveloped<br />
under arrangements jointly agreed by the Commonwealth and<br />
NSW Governments. Possible uses for the site included a<br />
riverfront park and residential and commercial development.<br />
A small area on the western fringe of the site of less than<br />
hectares would be retained for use by the Army.<br />
As a result of nearly 90 years occupation by the RAN,<br />
Newington was a rare green oasis in the centre of the inner<br />
western suburbs. It was unlikely that such a site would<br />
ever again become available for redevelopment. .2/ </p>
<p>-2-<br />
The decision to move the depot to Jervis Bay offered an<br />
unparalleled opportunity and challenge to the two<br />
Governments to contribute to the development of Sydney, they<br />
said.<br />
The ammunition depot, located on the southern side oE the<br />
Parramatta River, was first used as a storage area for<br />
explosives in 1896 and was expanded during World War II. it<br />
is now mainly used for storing gun and small arms ammunition<br />
and as a staging point for other munitions being moved to<br />
and from ships in Sydney Harbour.<br />
" The Federal Government has decided that the depot must be<br />
moved because of the increasing environmental problems<br />
associated with it," Mr Hawke said. " Civilian development<br />
in the surrounding areas and increased traffic both on -the<br />
roads around the depot and on the harbour are making -it<br />
increasingly difficult for the Navy to maintain the<br />
necessary high safety standards.<br />
" The Commonwealth proposes to build a new depot on a far<br />
larger site in the Jervis Bay area at. a cost of more than<br />
$ 100 million. The new depot should be operational by 1992."<br />
Mr Hawke said the Minister for Sport, Recreation and<br />
Tourism, and Minister Assisting the Minister for Defence, Mr.<br />
John Brown, would begin consultations with the NSW<br />
Government almost immediately to prepare a joint land use<br />
plan.<br />
Mr Wran welcomed the Commonwealth's decision to make the<br />
land available for civil use.<br />
" A thoughtful and sensitive mix of development on the site<br />
will benefit all the citizens of Sydney," he said. 3/ </p>

" In return the State Government has undertaken to assist<br />
the Commonwealth in assessing the environmental impact of<br />
the Proposed relocation of Defence facilities to the Jervis<br />
Bay area. The State Government recognizes that a new depot<br />
must be operational before the land at Homebush Bay can be<br />
released by the Commonwealth Government."<br />
Mr Hawke said the decision to relocate the ammunition depot<br />
raised the prospect that nearby Spectacle Island, which is<br />
used by the RAN in connection with the armunitioning of<br />
warships, could be opened to public use.<br />
Spectacle Island, which covers about two hectares, is one of<br />
the oldest naval shore establishments in Australia. . In 1883<br />
NSW made it available to the British Admiralty to store<br />
explosives. The island contains several buildings dating<br />
back to last century and is the repository for many historic<br />
naval relics.<br />
Mr Brown would discuss with the NSW. Government the extent to<br />
which the Island could be used by the public in a way<br />
consistent with the Commonwealth's requirement to use the<br />
Island for the emergency removal of ammunition from RAN<br />
ships.<br />
Mr H-awke also announced that options for the relocation of<br />
the naval supply facility at Rydalmere would be examined by<br />
the two governments. Its transfer to another suitable site<br />
in the Sydney area would make available for development<br />
about 21 hectares of riverfront land on the northern side of<br />
the Parramatta River near the Newington site.<br />
Mr Hawke said that, beside returning the Silverwater site to<br />
civil use and the prospect of other moves, the Government<br />
was considering relocation of other naval facilities away<br />
from Sydney. 4/ </p>
<p>-4<br />
The Minister for Defence, Mr Kim Beazley, had established a<br />
study group in the Department of Defence under the<br />
Ministerial direction of Mr Brown to examine all significant<br />
issues and options associated with a relocation of other<br />
naval facilities in Sydney, including its possible timing.<br />
In particular the study would examine:<br />
options for relocating the present Fleet Base<br />
facilities at Woolloomooloo and Garden Island<br />
( excluding the dockyard), the submarine base,<br />
HMAS Platypus, at Neutral Bay and the pat~ rol<br />
boat base, HMAS Waterhen, at Waverton, including<br />
the prospects for increased ship basing at<br />
EIMAS Stirling in Western Australia;<br />
* strategic, operational, cost and social),<br />
environmental and other public implications of the<br />
relocation options, including implications for<br />
the Jervis Bay region, and<br />
* potential offsets to relocation costs from the disposal<br />
of land, particularly in the Sydney metropolitan area.<br />
" The study group is to present its final report by the end<br />
of June next year," he said. " The move could take up to<br />
to 20 years to accomplish."<br />
Mr Hawke said if all the facilities under study were to be<br />
relocated, the total cost of the move was likely to be in<br />
the vicinity of $ 1000 milrlion, including naval facilities,<br />
housing and community services.<br />
Mr Hawke said that if the relocation went ahead it would<br />
provide a major boost to the South Coast with significant<br />
and lasting economic benefits in the long term for the<br />
Shoalhaven region. </p>
<p>Mr Hawke said that before detailed planning for the first<br />
stage move of the ammunition depot began the Commonwealth<br />
would commission a major environmental study which would<br />
report on the likely impact of the whole proposal on both<br />
the physical and human environment of the Jervis Bay<br />
region. " While the Government is anxious that this major relocation<br />
go ahead we wish to be reassured that it will produce no<br />
harmful side effects," Mr Hawke said.<br />
" All interested community groups will have the opportunity<br />
to contribute to this study and comment on its findings.<br />
" The broad study will be followed by detailed environmental<br />
impact studies for particular projects. The first of these<br />
studies will relate to the relocation of the ammunitio'n<br />
depot." Further Encuiries:<br />
