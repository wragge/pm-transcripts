TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
ADDRESS TO THE VICTORIAN STATE ALP CONFERENCE,<br />
MOONEE PONDS, MELBOURNE, SATURDAY 21 MARCH 1992<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
Comrades, delegates, thank you very much for that warm round<br />
of applause and reception, Paul ( Slape) Victorian Party<br />
President thank you for your kind words, Joan the leader<br />
of the Labor Party and Premier of Victoria, our candidate<br />
Sill Kardaitsis and his wife Haroula, Jenny State<br />
Secretary and friends one and all.<br />
Well these are challenging times and it's nice to be amongst<br />
friends, and I haven't always been amongst friends this<br />
week. But in engaging times like these one needs to know<br />
where one is;. We need to know where we are and what we are<br />
and where we're going. We have to have a very good fix on<br />
what our political policy and strategy is because parties<br />
lose their way and many parties in the past have. But<br />
fortunately that has not happened to us. Not in recent<br />
times. But you might have heard me say that we've been working in<br />
this century between two competing ideas in politics. One<br />
has been that private reward and private initiative was the<br />
main spring of all endeavour and human progress, and on the<br />
other hand, state socialism and government intervention was<br />
the way forward. We have seen these philosophies, Adam<br />
Smith on the one hand, Marx on the other and various shades<br />
in between become the polarity of public life in the<br />
twentieth century, the tug and pull from the poles of those<br />
two competin~ g ideas.<br />
We saw it in the United States with conservatives like<br />
Calvin Coolidge, articulating the policies of reward for the<br />
wealthy and the owing to the reaction against it in the<br />
depression, to the need for governmlent involvement which<br />
came with Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal. And we saw the<br />
swing back t~ o the years of Eisenhower, where again, we saw<br />
the same conservative incantations ran out. And then the<br />
swing back as Americans wanted better with Lyndon Johnson's<br />
New Deal and, support for blacks. And then again back to the<br />
years of greed is good, and that private initiative and </p>
<p>private reward is all that matters in the years of Ronald<br />
Reagan. And we saw it in Britain, with Churchill after the<br />
war and the swing to the government of Clement Attlee, where<br />
government involvement and government initiative was<br />
regarded as being important. And then the swing back to the<br />
dry radicalism of Margaret Thatcher where basically again<br />
the strong prospered and the weak were left in their wake.<br />
We came to office in 1983 against that tide. When we came<br />
to office the political tide was away from government<br />
intervention, government involvement, government engaging<br />
problems in society and the economy. Blut we stood against<br />
that tide, against the tide of Reaganism and Thatcherism,<br />
which was then the international trend. We stood up against<br />
it and we pulled the pendulum back. We dragged the pendulum<br />
back, not to state socialism which we knew was not working,<br />
never worked, and wouldn't work, or to massive central<br />
planning, but to a peculiarly and proud Australian policy.<br />
one that-you would expect from the oldest Labor Party in the<br />
world able to make its own policy and not be caught up in<br />
the fashion of these two competing political ideas.<br />
And we camne up with a policy which was about opening<br />
Australia up, about economic restructuring, of letting<br />
markets have A role in the country, keeping a focus on<br />
efficiency, but at the same time looking at the needs of<br />
people, trying to fashion a social wage which made the lot<br />
of Australians better.<br />
So Labor in the 1980s had a growth model. When I used to<br />
stand up as the Finance minister or the Treasurer at the<br />
OECD and say we have an employment objective, a specific<br />
employment objective, people would look at you as if you had<br />
a sort of case of rabies or something, and they would say<br />
they thought there was something wrong with you. Because<br />
then, employment for those people, for those countries,<br />
employmnent: was the residual, it's the thing that dropped out<br />
the bottom~ f. And if what dropped out was 10 per cent<br />
unemployment or 15 per cent unemployment, so be it. That<br />
was the price, they said, of giving the wealthy t~ heir go, of<br />
letting the goers go and leaving the other people in their<br />
wake. Now, of course, we had big objectives, we had to come out of<br />
a recession, we had to bring Australia back up, we had to<br />
restart investment, we had to get employment going, we had<br />
to overcome inflation and put a suture on our debt. But we<br />
did all of that within a growth model, in partnership with<br />
the trade unions under the Accord. In other words, Labor<br />
included people in. We brought in the unions, which have<br />
always been a strength of Labor and said let'-s to this<br />
together, let's devise a policy which is Australian, which<br />
deals With Australian problems which does not see us as a<br />
government: with a slosh of the pendulum from one side to the<br />
other, being drawn around by these international trends.<br />
Let's decide our policy and let's do it our way to make<br />
things better for Australians work, but with reform. That<br />
is, a role for government but without suffocating </p>
<p>. a L4-' 1 k V<br />
3<br />
creativity, without suffocating the role of the sensible<br />
operationa of the market and with a focus on the things we<br />
knew it had to be on economic efficiency, getting<br />
companies going again, restructuring our old industrial<br />
structure, turning our industrial museum back into a modern,<br />
sophisticated industrial society and getting on with it.<br />
We never accepted the Thatcher view that employment was a<br />
residual, that if the rich got their go what would fall from<br />
the table the crumbs would go to the working anid middle<br />
classes. We never accepted that view. Nor did we accept<br />
the market puritanical view of the New Zealand Labor Party,<br />
of Lange and Roger Douglas. We wouldn't cop them either and<br />
Paul is quite right to make the reference to New Zealand.*<br />
They've basically disseminated a generation over there. In<br />
fact, we had'more growth in the Australian economy in the<br />
1980s than there is total GDP in New Zealand. We had<br />
actually more growth here than there is total product in the<br />
New Zealand economy.<br />
We in fact absorbed Thatcherism and Reaganism, took it in<br />
our stride, used those precepts about markets and efficiency<br />
as we warited to use them in the Labor way, in the Labor<br />
context in the Labor model and followed a Labor policy and<br />
talked to our fellows in the trade unions, our friends in<br />
the trade. unions as the New Zealand Labor Party didn't, and<br />
as the British Labor Party couldn't.<br />
And that's what made us different.<br />
in the 180s we freed up savings for investment, but we<br />
developed this enormous social wage which started caring<br />
about things like:<br />
Health -with Medicare the right to health insurance<br />
whether you were sick, sore or sorry, rich or poor,<br />
single or with a large family, you had health<br />
protection under us. That was an important part of the<br />
social wage.<br />
Women's issues which we promoted strongly all the way<br />
from the 1980s, whether they be equal opportunity, or<br />
affirmative action or access to superannuation, or what<br />
have you.<br />
Pensioners and lifting up the unemployment rate, which<br />
had fallen in real terms under Fraser, as had the age<br />
pensiLon, which we improved dramatically through the<br />
180S.<br />
Income support for the low paid with a family<br />
allowance supplement directed to low paid, low income<br />
famil~ ies, or support to families generally with a<br />
family allowance.<br />
Increased retention rates in school because we knew<br />
that not only was it unfair to our children not to give<br />
them the opportunity to complete secondary school but </p>
<p>4<br />
we would never make it as an advanced country while<br />
ever we took the view that 3 kids in 10 completing<br />
secondary school was good enough. It is now 7 in<br />
and wo then created the equivalent of a dozen<br />
universities to take them as they left the secondary<br />
systemi. And now of course, we're pulling TAFE up<br />
behind it.<br />
Aged care where we're the first government to develop<br />
a comprehensive policy towards the aged. That is from<br />
geriatric assessment, through to home and community<br />
care, through to the hostel program, right through.<br />
Child care giving women the opportunity to go to<br />
work, and giving those who are at home relief with<br />
occasional day care in the course of the day or week.<br />
Superannuation giving Australian workers a chance to<br />
have a standard of living in retirement greater than<br />
that than can be provided by the Commonwealth through<br />
the age pension. Building on the age pension, but<br />
something better, and at the same time develop a pool<br />
of savings for the nation to employ in terms of its<br />
capital re~ tructuring.<br />
We made in fact, a smaller public sector, a better<br />
public sector, by focussing the need, and of course<br />
smaller as a per cent of GDP but with large increases<br />
in spending where it needed to be.<br />
So that was our ' 80s model. We rejected all these<br />
international fashions, we rejected the half hearted view<br />
from the Right. We took our policy, we still opened the<br />
economy up., wellet the market forces take over in many<br />
respects, that is through the exchange markets ae, but we<br />
had a Labor stamp on it.<br />
And now we've developed it further with ' One Nation'.<br />
What ' OneNotion,' does is build on that experience. It sets<br />
out a ole-ar f6le for the public sector beyond the social<br />
wage and income support. It gives the public sector a<br />
further role, a policy of engagement of national problems<br />
not a policy of Withdrawal. Not the policy of withdrawal of<br />
Professor Hewson who wants to tear everything out of the way<br />
to let again the wealthy push their way through the economy,<br />
but basically using and declaring that the public sector has<br />
a role in shaping the fortunes of Australia, particularly in<br />
a difficult period coming out of recession, making that<br />
recovery faster, providing the stimulus we need, getting the<br />
focus back on employment and jobs and recovery, and doing it<br />
in a way which again has Labor leaving its mark and its<br />
stamp on Australia, using the public sector to declare<br />
change in the country, things which only the public sector<br />
can do. Like for instance, rebuilding our national rail<br />
network because we know no-one else is going to build it, no<br />
private company is going to rebuild the Sydney-Melbourne<br />
railway line, no private company is going to standardise the<br />
j j I u u. Lu r ud4/ v </p>
<p>1<br />
gauge from Melbourne to Adelaide, no private company is<br />
going to tie the ports together. It has to be done by the<br />
government, by the public sector. It's not going to be done<br />
as proposed in the Liberal program of withdrawing money<br />
from the rail system, but rather injecting money into it.<br />
To bring u. p, to give us again a choice in transport.<br />
Because wis know we can't carry bulk commodities on our<br />
roads, we know that we can't continually grow in the economy<br />
with road transport alone which is breaking up our highways<br />
and causing congestion and road accidents and the rest on<br />
our roads. We know, as a modern country with vast<br />
differences between our cities, we must have a rail system<br />
and only the public sector can provide it.<br />
' One Nation' makes that declaration, as It does about roads.<br />
Building ring roads around the capital cities, supporting<br />
the states, supporting the Victorian Government in a ring<br />
road around Melbourne and around Sydney and Brisbane and in<br />
the other capitals. Building national highways.<br />
making a decision about our children, again, with technical<br />
and further education. We're not saying leave them out to<br />
make their own way, as Professor Hewson recommends that<br />
people take opportunities in tertiary education by paying<br />
full fees, $ 12,000 a year, so if their parents can afford a<br />
pre-tax income of $ 25,000 to pay for $ 12,000 after tax or<br />
thereabouts, which for most two income families is half<br />
their income to send one child to university that's what<br />
they think is freedom to achieve. They're not interested in<br />
those hundreds of thousands of other people, children, kids<br />
who can't find a place in university, for academic or other<br />
reasons, but who need to be trained, who want to be trained.<br />
Bill ( Kardamitsis) and I went through TAFE a couple of days<br />
ago in the electorate of Wills, just seeing what people are<br />
doing, with very important courses which let them into the<br />
workforce like English literacy, expression, basic computer<br />
literacy, advanced computer literacy, graphic design,<br />
programs to care for the aged, administration for aged care,<br />
administration for child care. All these sorts of things,<br />
and of course the trade courses which can be such an<br />
important part of not only providing employment opportunity<br />
but making Australia a better, more clever, more capable<br />
place. The Government must do it, not by withdrawing but by<br />
engaging ii: which is what ' One Nation' is doing.<br />
As we are assisting big projects with a development<br />
allowance. We're supporting the private sector to go and do<br />
it, but we're doing it in a way which we think maximises<br />
advantages to Australia. Establishing development bonds so<br />
we can see private provision of public infrastructure<br />
nothing wrong with it, nothing wrong with seeing a private<br />
company in transport infrastructure, say the fast transit<br />
line from Tullamerine to Melbourne, no problem it is a<br />
private com~ pany. No problem if we see the electricity<br />
industry of this country change the private provision of<br />
public infrastructure. The main thing is that the services<br />
are there. And setting up pool development funds for<br />
i ial a. v -j o ii u Q LQ r v. o </p>
<p>equity, for the small and medium businesses that just can't<br />
get any support with equity. We're in there doing that.<br />
So ' One Nation' is about those things but it's also about<br />
making markets work sensibly for the nation. It's Labor<br />
deciding that certain markets should work better and looking<br />
at areas of market failure and it's again an ascertain, a<br />
declaration that the public sector has a role in further<br />
designing Labor's grander redesign of Australian capitalism,<br />
which we've undertaken from 1983 onwards. In such things as<br />
the aviation market, we think it is important to create a<br />
market, to. provide services, to get away from a two airline<br />
policy with fares so expensive that an Australian worker<br />
can't fly from Melbourne to Perth, or Melbourne to Sydney<br />
and return, to create a market which serves Australians well<br />
with cheaper fares and destinations outside of Australia.<br />
A national market for electricity with an interstate grid,<br />
so that businesses that need cheap power can get it, because<br />
this country has got a coal seam all down the east coast of<br />
Australia. If there is no other thing we can do well it's<br />
provide cheap electricity. But we're not getting it always<br />
were we need it, in the companies that can be competitive<br />
with cheaper power, and we're creating a market to let that<br />
happen. The most general creation of a market, a more flexible<br />
labour market which is coming now again under the Accord<br />
with enterprise bargaining, where we're seeing a market<br />
exist in the thousands of enterprises across Australia which<br />
was formerly never operating as a market. International<br />
competitiveness, preserving our low inflation rate.<br />
Inflation w~ hich has ripped Australian workers savings to<br />
pieces and put heavy mortgages on peoples backs and made t; he<br />
country uncompetitive. We're basically in there protecting<br />
and pinning that low inflation rate. We're enhancing bank<br />
competition by again bringing more emphasis to banking<br />
system and trying to make the banking system work better.<br />
In other words, ' One Nation' is about making markets work<br />
sensibly. It's not about deciding, as was the case in those<br />
polls I mentioned earlier, of trying to set up state<br />
socialism or government planning but sensibly letting the<br />
creative elements of people and organisations work, but with<br />
Labor, the government, the public sector leaving its stamp<br />
upon it. And that's what ' One Nation' is about.<br />
it's a poliLcy of inclusion, of bringing people together, as<br />
I've said, lowering the drawbridge, letting people in, to<br />
participate, to become more cohesive. And the concept<br />
encompassesJ the Accord where Australia's workers are part of<br />
the process, part of the conversation of government with a<br />
Labor gover7nment. The consultation with business who are<br />
part of the consultation, the inclusion, under ' One Nation'.<br />
The partnerships for progress between government and<br />
business, government and unions, business and unions, the<br />
Comnmonwealt~ h and the States, political government and the<br />
public service. Bringing people together with common goals<br />
41-1-J. </p>
<p>a&amp; Policy Of inclusion with the drawbridge down, not the<br />
drawbridge uip. ' With the elite sitting inside with the Power<br />
and the money looking at the others outside that is flot<br />
our model. Our model is the drawbridge down and the people<br />
-in as part of it, Common goals, working together, making<br />
Australia better.<br />
The only way we can prosper as a nation is working this way.<br />
Having respect for our Institutions, the arts, the public<br />
institutionil like the public service, our central bank with<br />
its balanced objectives of employment and development<br />
against inflation and price stability. All in the sense of<br />
civilised design in the central bank act ought to have the<br />
respect of t: he political system. Or the public service<br />
which carries out the functions of government. Or as I say<br />
those other institutions. The policy of inclusion goes to<br />
those institutions.<br />
And it is about having a national identity. About<br />
understanding that we are able to make our own way, that we<br />
are Australians and we're whole hearted about it and the<br />
policy is ark Australian policy. It's not an American policy<br />
or a British policy, it's not like Professor Hewson's who is<br />
borrowing from the late ' 70s of Margaret Thatcher. It's not<br />
like Labor In New Zealand. It's ours. It's Australian<br />
Labor, it's Aust ralian and it's ours. It's ours because<br />
we're clear about our national identity and we are not half<br />
hearted about it and we're not hesitating about it, we're<br />
declaring it end we're going for it, and we're moving with<br />
direction and purpose in doing it.<br />
go as one nation we are pooling these things for recovery in<br />
jobs, 800,000 jobs we expect over the next 4 years by<br />
government involvement and infrastructure, making markets<br />
work, partnerships f or progress between government and<br />
business, busines's and unions, bringing institutions<br />
together and having an identity, being clear about who we<br />
are and therefore having the confidence to push our policies<br />
and nation forward. In other words we're about, basically,<br />
building on the successes of the 1980s in this way.<br />
Now comrades, I ask you to contrast this with the Liberal<br />
Party, now a party of primitives. A party of primitives,<br />
the throw-backs to the 19th Century robber-baron capitalism,<br />
the Adam Smiths and those who believe that what we should do<br />
is make way for the wealthy because in their slip stream the<br />
rest will pick up something on the way through. Survival of<br />
the fittest if you're not a millionaire there is something<br />
wrong with you and therefore those who have got money<br />
should, be given the opportunity to make their way best.<br />
it's called in Liberal parlance, ' freedom to achieve'.<br />
Justice and opportunities for the wealthy. I notice the<br />
opposition spokesman on education, Mr Kemp, last week<br />
complaining about lack of opportunity for the wealthy. No<br />
role for government, they want government out. Now this is<br />
the party that offers itself as the next government of<br />
Australia. It wants no role for government, it distrusts </p>
<p>the bureaucracy. In the last week the Deputy leader said<br />
they'll ' knee-cap the public service. It distrusts the<br />
central bank who it says doesn't properly focus on the twin<br />
objectives under its acts of employment and price stability,<br />
it's politicised they said by the Government. It distrusts<br />
the Australian taxi office and wishes to compromise its<br />
Commissioner with a board from the accountancy profession,<br />
the same accountancy professors who are now funding the<br />
Fightbacc research centre, the GST research centre, the<br />
major accountancy firms who would send a representative on a<br />
cord to manage the tax office.<br />
And, of course, business is distrusted. They've been<br />
described as bludgers coming for handouts from the<br />
Government. Dr Hewson attacked them again last week. lie<br />
said the saddest thing about them is they turned up and<br />
asked the Government for favours. So these are the people<br />
who want to run us, these primitives. No role for<br />
government, don't trust the bureaucracy, don't trust the<br />
central bank, don't trust the Tax office, don't trust our<br />
institutions, don't trust business. And what the want to<br />
give us as part of their philosophy? Well they want to<br />
lower the drawbridge and run out with the GST and levy it on<br />
everyone's food and clothing and then run back in. That's<br />
their idea of inclusion, that's their idea of cohesion,<br />
that's their idea of making Australia one nation. Go and<br />
put a flat tax on everybody regardless of income, don't<br />
compensate them, let the wealthy get the big break, clean<br />
away all of the other impediments to profitability and then<br />
maybe the rest of them will pick up something on the way.<br />
And when Mr Reith was asked about his inflation forecast of<br />
o to 2 par cent, meaning as it must higher interest rates,<br />
he denied the journalist the words he had given her, not<br />
having the courage to face the consequences of their own<br />
policy, 1: heit own policy meaning higher interest rates and<br />
higher unemployment, all in the manic determination to<br />
simply ideologically serve this rhetoric about Inflation.<br />
A barren, sterile, ancient view of managing a modern<br />
society. The selfish, nark view of the world. The nark<br />
view of the world, the drawbridge up, the wealthy inside,<br />
the government withdrawing from the social equation. That's<br />
their policy. Their fundamentally different from us, but<br />
they always have been. We imagine Australia's future,<br />
determined by imagination, opportunity, inclusion,<br />
togetherness, co-operation, cohesion, pride. They imagine<br />
it determined by cost accounting and privilege. That's<br />
them. Now Professor Hewson is totally limited in his thinking.<br />
Ideologically hamstrung, ideologically divisive, politically<br />
barren, ak cold fish washed ashore by the recession, but a<br />
primitive species we have seen before. And we've Seen it<br />
right through this period whether it's Thatcher, or whether<br />
it's Reacran or Coolidge or any of the others, we've seen<br />
these peo) ple before. We've seen their barren ideology<br />
before. </p>
<p>9<br />
Australia can't afford Professor Hewson or his party or his<br />
policies. Look at their candidate in Wills who our<br />
candidate Bill Kardamitsis is opposing, who says there ought<br />
to be a 30 per cent cut in social security, who said that<br />
pensions should be out and migrants should be driven back<br />
home if they haven't got a job and if someone dare pay money<br />
to the disabled in a sheltered work shop they should chop it<br />
out. These are the sort of primitive views and wasn't it shocking<br />
that that got into the public debate. I mean it was a real<br />
incursion into privacy. Here is somebody running for public<br />
office that's embarrassed by the fact that they actually<br />
believe in cutting pensions and payments under the social<br />
security system by one third, who believe pensioners ought<br />
to be cut back and migrants sent home. Have the disabled<br />
disadvantaged further by withdrawing the support that they<br />
have already from the Government.<br />
Dr fewson is always about saying that I create diversions.<br />
We're saying as a big matter of news for the day that he was<br />
going to the Privacy Commission about letters written by a<br />
political ca ' ndidate or political person in office about<br />
matters of public policy. What a hide they have. This is<br />
revealing of them, very revealing of them. And in fact all<br />
that's happen is that their candidates reveal the policies<br />
they really have, because even though he wrote that in the<br />
middle ' 80s it is still their view. They want to cut<br />
billion out of Commonwealth outlays. They want to levy this<br />
very heavy tax on Australians, they want to heavy this goods<br />
and services tax on all food, clothing, services etc and<br />
that's the limit of their creativity and ability.<br />
Now on the other hand, we offer something better and<br />
brighter. We offer breadth, as we always have, vision,<br />
opportunity, we are as we've always been the builders. And<br />
whether it be the rail network, or the highways, or the ring<br />
roads, or the electricity grids, or the ports, o~ r the TAFE,<br />
or the universities, or the Family Allowance Supplement, or<br />
family a: llowance, or superannuation or Medicare, it is<br />
always Labor doing the building. And we will be the<br />
building. We are the reform party in this country. We're the creators<br />
of the new concept. And we're the people holding our hand<br />
out in friendship to workers, to business, to minorities, to<br />
blacks and to anyone else that needs a hand. in friendship<br />
and in expectation, and hope, hope for Australia, hope for<br />
one nation, one proud nation, one independent nation.<br />
Thank you very much. </p>
