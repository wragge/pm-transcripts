    <content><![CDATA[<p>Shanghai, People's Republic of China</p>
<p>A new campaign to promote Australian tourism, trade and investment opportunities to the rapidly growing Chinese market will be brought to Shanghai following the success of the G'Day USA program.</p>
<p>Australia Week in China will be based in Shanghai  -  China's commercial and financial capital  -  in 2014 to further boost Australia's reputation as a world leading destination and a valuable tourism, trade and investment partner.</p>
<p>The announcement made today in Shanghai comes during a five day visit by the most senior Australian Government delegation to ever visit China.</p>
<p>The week will feature a range of events and activities including a campaign to attract more Chinese tourism to Australia, cultural activities showcasing contemporary performing and visual arts, a gala dinner in Shanghai and investment activities including targeted meetings with potential Chinese investors.</p>
<p>It will be held in the second half of 2014 to coincide with Tourism Australia's Greater China Travel Mission, which attracts more than 120 Australian tourism operators.</p>
<p>As with G'Day USA, the Australian Government will be seeking to partner with the private sector as well as state and territory governments.</p>
<p>China is now our biggest trading partner as well as our most valuable inbound tourism market.</p>
<p>A record 625,000 Chinese visited Australia during 2012, up 16 per cent on the previous year. </p>
<p>Australia Week in China will support our already comprehensive approach to the China market.  It will support Australian exports and attract foreign investment, including in the tourism, innovation, clean energy and infrastructure sectors.</p>
<p>This $1.75 million initiative is part of the suite of activities the Government is undertaking to broaden and deepen our relationship with China as outlined in the Australia in the Asian Century White Paper and Tourism 2020.</p>
<p>The Government launched the China 2020 Strategic Plan in June 2011 to help realise the huge tourism opportunity for Australia  -  in 2011, 70 million Chinese travelled overseas, spending US$69 billion.</p>
<p>We are already seeing increased aviation access between China and Australia  -  half a dozen international carriers currently fly between China and Australia including Qantas, Jetstar, Air China, China Eastern, China Southern and Sichuan Airlines.</p>
<p>Tourism Australia, Austrade, and the Departments of Resources, Energy and Tourism and Foreign Affairs and Trade will work together with industry and governments to deliver the initiative. </p>
