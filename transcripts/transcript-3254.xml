<p>Men and Women of Australia,<br />
Just 17 months ago, I stood here, and from this<br />
place and from this city I asked you to choose for Australia<br />
a new team, a new program, a new drive for equality of<br />
opportunities. You gave us a clear mandate to go ahead with<br />
our program for the next 3 years. For 17 months we have<br />
driven ourselves to carry out you;: mandate, to carry out the<br />
program I placed before you. Now the government you elected<br />
for 3 years has been interrupted in mid-career. Our program<br />
has been brought to a halt in mid-stream.<br />
Everything we promised, everything we have achieved,<br />
everything you expected of us your expressed hopes for<br />
yourselves, your families, your nation all this is suddenly Lt=<br />
threatened. It is threatened by the actions of the men you oco<br />
I rejected a mere 17 months ago.. It is threatened by the actions<br />
of men elected to the Senate not in 1972, but in 1967 and 1970.<br />
It is threatened by men who refused to stand by the umpire's<br />
verdict your verdict to give , s a chance, to give you a<br />
chance, to give Australia a new chance.<br />
These men who have falsified democracy now ask<br />
you to turn back. Turn back to what? Think again how it n<br />
was when you elected us in ! 972. Unemployment was at its " 4 A<br />
worst for 10 years. Our rate of gr: owth was one of the<br />
world's worst a paltry 20. The Australian dollar was<br />
grossly undervalued. Foreign money was. flooding in to buy<br />
up Australian resources and Australian industries on the chieap.<br />
Accelerating numbers of nigrants w/ ere leaving in disillusion.<br />
Australia was still deeply involved in the war in Viet Nam.<br />
Our whole foreign policy was based on hostility to China. We<br />
were running an army on the cheap by conscripting young men.<br />
There were young men in prison foe their conscience.<br />
Australia was a. d2ep3y divided nation. Our young people were<br />
becoming alienated frorr. the mainstream of Australian society.<br />
S The disrespect in which our nation.-al leadership the Liberals<br />
were held at home had spread to cidre~ ect for Australia abroad.<br />
Think again, indeed!<br />
Mark today's contrast. The Australian economy i<br />
one of the most buoyant and vigorous in the world.<br />
Full employTmnt has been restored. Business<br />
activity is at its highest for a decade, company profits are<br />
at record levels and business expectations are at an all time<br />
high. Through our economic policies and our social security<br />
program, Australia's prosperity i3 becoming more fairly shared<br />
than ever before. Abroad, Australia has never stood so tall. We have<br />
buried old animosities. We dare-hold in new respect by old<br />
friends and allies. Never in her history has Australia been<br />
more secure. </p>
<p>2<br />
We have ended national division, national<br />
disunity by ending our involvement in Viet Nam, and ending<br />
conscription. We have opened up new and expanding markets for As,<br />
our farm products. By placing family reunion for migrants above mere f'e<br />
recruiting, we have stopped the rmigrant drift. t<br />
For the first time Australia has a government<br />
determined to promote Australian ownership and control of<br />
Australian industries and resources. 0 N( 446 ' IR<br />
O-^ N&amp; oub<br />
For the first time fcr a generation Australia has<br />
a government dedicated to equal opportunity for all its<br />
citizens. We have more than doubled spending on schools. d JLu-cJG<br />
We have abolished fees at universities, colIee 3 of zaivanced<br />
education and going one better than oar pledge at technical<br />
schools. For the first time Australia has a government<br />
determined to make the conditions of life more equal for all<br />
Australians, wherever they live in Australia.<br />
For the first time Australia has a government WQ A<br />
seriously concerned to give equality of opportunity to women.<br />
For the first time Australia has a national<br />
government involving itself directly in the affairs of. our<br />
cities. For the first time Australia has a government ready an<br />
to give local government direct access to the national finances.<br />
For the first time Australia has a nrational<br />
government prepared to co-operate in renewing our decaying<br />
urban transport systems. 27<br />
For the first time Australia has a national<br />
government determined to fulfil its con: stitutional obligationAa1<br />
towards the aboriginals L<br />
For the first time Australia has a government<br />
determined to preserve, protect and enhance Australia's<br />
national estate our natural and historical inheritance,<br />
what we keep from our past, what we transmit to the future.<br />
For the first time Australia Las a national<br />
government which recognises the significance of the arts and<br />
artists in our society. Our support for the arts has<br />
released an unparallelled burst-of creativity in this nation. N. ox </p>
<p>These achievements are just some of the fruits of<br />
programs based on expert advice. . Je sought and obtained the Ow
co-operation of the most highly qualified Australian men and<br />
women to enquire into and to report upon basic requirements<br />
in Australia's social and economic structures. Tnese reports 5a4<br />
are public. The work of these enquiries and commissions is<br />
the basis of a continuing, coherent. comprehensive program.<br />
The new initiatives 1 announce tonight are the new dimensions<br />
and expanded fruits of this work.<br />
This premature election means that these fruits<br />
are being denied the Australian people. It has meant deferring<br />
our entire legislative program. ' Oe have this legislation<br />
ready to go; it is crucial legislation, and we have it ready.<br />
We ask you to send us back to get on with the business your<br />
business. In the Parliament that has been dissolved four<br />
referendum bills had been twice rejected by the Senate. Under<br />
the Constitution the Governor-General is submitting each of<br />
them to the electors. Six other bills had been twice rejected<br />
by the Senate. That is why under the Constitution the<br />
Governor-General has dissolved both Houses of Parliament.<br />
The Senate had also rejected nine other bills.<br />
Some of them had been introdiuced a" second time. When the<br />
Parliament was dissolved 24 bills were waiting to be passed.<br />
The government will reintroduce all these rejected and<br />
pending bills in the new Parliament. Also,* 107 new bills<br />
have been already drafted and are awaiting introduction in<br />
the new Parliament; a further 104 bills are being drafted on<br />
the government's instructions.<br />
I Our programs the programs you endorsed in 1972<br />
had been developed over the previous si; x , ears. They were<br />
published policies; they were debated in public; they were<br />
scrutinized in Parliament. Time and time again as an<br />
Opposition, we put positive proposals up for debate in<br />
Parliament. By contrast our opponents have never since put<br />
up a single proposal for examination by eitier Parliament or<br />
the public. When they forced tnis election, none of us knew<br />
anything of what they proposed. All we knew was what they<br />
opposed. And that's really all we know now.<br />
In defence of their wealthy friends and vested t<br />
interests, they rejected the democratic principle of equal<br />
electorates; they blocked attempts to democratise and modernise<br />
the trade union movement; they denied representation in the<br />
Senate to the people of the inorthern Territory and the<br />
Australian Capital Territory; they sought ' L deny to local<br />
government direct access to national revenues and borrowings;<br />
they preserved for foreign mining iaterests the right to<br />
exploit our of f-shore resources. -They preserved the inequity,<br />
inefficiency and injustice of an anti{ uated healtA scheme.<br />
They have prevented one million of our fellow-citizens from<br />
having any protection against hospital and medical charges. </p>
<p>4<br />
By shelving the Trade Practices Bill they left<br />
the door open to monopolies and big corporations to fix<br />
prices, organise cartels and exploit the Australian customer.<br />
By shelving the Ausralian ndustry Development Corporation<br />
Bill they blocked the most effective instrument for ensuring<br />
Australian control of our industries and developing new<br />
industries. They left the door open to foreign takeovers and<br />
foreign exploitation of the Australian economy. Yet you had<br />
given us a clear mandate for every one of these proposals they<br />
have opposed and obstructed.<br />
These are the men who forced a premature election.<br />
Now they are asking you to make a judgement affecting your<br />
lives, your families and their welfare, your nation's future<br />
for the next three years on the basis of policies cooked up in<br />
the last three weeks. When they destroyed my government's<br />
power to govern they had no more idea of what their policies<br />
would be than you did. All they knew is that they were out AW<br />
S to destroy the Whitlam Government. The Leader of the g<br />
Opposition in the Senate admitted on the night of the<br />
dissolution of Parliament " T'e embarked on a course some<br />
12 months ago to bring about a House of Representatives<br />
election". In the five weeks that the Senate sat this year<br />
votes were taken on 43 occasions. The three opposition<br />
parties combined to defeat the government on 42 of those<br />
occasions. They had made the parliament unworkable.<br />
What a spectacle This must present to the world<br />
a world where everywhere democracy is under challenge. In<br />
no other country in the world could an Upper louse, elected<br />
3 years ago ' and 6 years ago, use an outdated majority, a<br />
chance majority, to bring down the government elected by the<br />
people only one and one-third years ag.<br />
SAnd in Australia this had never been before<br />
attempted by the Senate. Until our opponents lost office,<br />
after 23 years, it had never even been threatened in the<br />
Australian Parliament. One result of their actions is that for only the<br />
third time in Australia's history, we are to have an election<br />
for the whole Senate as well as the House of Representatives.<br />
In addition, you will be asked to support referen. um proposals<br />
to make the Australian democracy more equitable and more<br />
efficient. REFERENDUMS The last occasion on which you voted for the whole F&amp; W<br />
of the Senate and the House of Representatives was 1951. The<br />
first referendum proposal is desicn-i: to avoid the situation<br />
after 1951. Barely two years aftr the 1951 double dissolution<br />
there had to be an election for h&amp; af the Senate ' and then a year<br />
later a separate House of Representatives election. It is<br />
quite wrong to suggest that the present dissolution of both<br />
Houses of itself synchronises future elections for them. 4 </p>
<p>It does nothing-. of the sr. The-ehiections for the two Houses<br />
will remain out of kilter' unless you accept our referendum<br />
proposal. Australia has too -many elections. Since 1963 we<br />
have had a national election every, 1j years. That is not<br />
good for Australia. It does not make for good government or<br />
for a healthy Parliament.<br />
* Australia needs a period of stable government.<br />
Australia needs a period of stable lecadership. we enter upon<br />
a timne of difficult deci; sions. Such-decisions can * be taken'<br />
* only by a united governme-at1 a united ' leadership, a united -Party,*<br />
a united nation. Anid ou-r government alone offers such unity,<br />
-Such leadership. We need a Parliament which re'fects the will of the<br />
W people as fully and accurately as pom3ible. Our referen'dum<br />
proposals are designed to achieve this.<br />
-Our proposal to synchro-iise elections fo h-Senate<br />
and House of Representatives was reccmmended as far back as-<br />
1958t ye. a1part Contitution Review Committee establishd<br />
under Sir Robert 21enzies in 195G. The second proposa. is to--<br />
allow the Constitucion to be c-Ilt_ red if a m~ ijority of all the<br />
electors in Australia approve anC ilsd a majority of the<br />
electors in not less than one-half of th,! States; this<br />
proposal was also recomaended by the Ct-onstitution Review<br />
Comiteein 1958. The third proposal is that after July 1976<br />
there should be equal electorates in the Uois!_: of Representatives<br />
and in every State Douse of Parliament; thle inethod has been<br />
perfected for the. U. S. Congress and State legislatures by the<br />
U. S. Supreme Corurt over the lz. t 10( years; in Australia'it will<br />
be applied by the High Court. The Sen~ ate o-pposed your having<br />
a vote on any of these issues, eve, th-ose recommended as far back<br />
as 1958. But where tha Senate tcerejects referendum proposals,<br />
the Constitution gives you, peopl. e, the right to vote on<br />
them regardless of the Scnates re-Jection-.---<br />
* It is not i thoui-s. gpifi canc3 that our opponents<br />
-used their -nui-ibe-Ls in the Senate' ock your chance of<br />
having your say as -electo,-s on pronoSals to make Australia<br />
a more stable deniocracY anid a more. iaqial democracy. Despite<br />
their obstruction, you will1, at referendumns on the same day<br />
as the elections, be able to. hav -_, our say.<br />
Iknow that thesc matters require your thought and:<br />
your time if you are to make a reasonable judgement. I ask you<br />
again as I asked you two weeks ago, give close thought to<br />
them and five minutes of your-time for the future of Australia<br />
on the 18 N. ay. </p>
<p>THE ECONOMY Ue Australians all now face together one of the<br />
great historic challenges of our time; to make democracy<br />
work; to make the parliamentary system work; and make it<br />
work better. We share this challenge with most other<br />
parliamentary democracies. Equally, with them, with all<br />
major trading nations, with all mixed economies, we share the<br />
problem of inflation. We are all seeking ways by which the<br />
expectations, the wishes, the aspirations, the hopes of every<br />
member of the community can be reconciled with freedom, good<br />
order, security, stability. There is no simple answer, no<br />
one answer, no easy cure. But if a solution is to be found<br />
or even attempted, we need a strong, courageous, united<br />
Sleadership. We need at the same time, a national leadership<br />
passionately concerned about the preservation of the democratic<br />
system and a leadership compassionately concerned to protect<br />
the weaker members of the community. I suggest to you that<br />
our government, since you elected it only 17 months ago, has<br />
Sshown such dedication and has shown its capacity for firm and<br />
courageous decisions decisions which were sometimes<br />
initially unpopular, opposed by powerful interests, but which<br />
have proved their correctness and which have proved the<br />
doomsayers wrong. World events and the policies of -our predecessors<br />
inevitably meant a higher rate of inflation in 1973 than in<br />
1972. We have acted firmly to moderate these pressures.<br />
s And these policies are beginning to work inflation<br />
has slowed. All our efforts to curb inflation have been opposed<br />
or obstructed by our opponents. Where we took administrative<br />
action, they criticised. Where we took legislative action,<br />
they obstructed. Where we sought more powers from you by<br />
way of referendum, they opposed. Uhere we have sought<br />
co-operation with the States, governments of the same political<br />
persuasion as our opponents have failed to pass the necessary<br />
legislation. SA1dministratively, we cut tariffs by 25% to. reduce<br />
the price of imports without damaging Australian industries.<br />
We have twice revalued the Australian dollar reflecting its<br />
true status as one of the world's strongest currencies.<br />
By legislation, we have tried to promote competition.<br />
As long ago as 1963 the present Chief Justice Sir Garfield<br />
Barwick pointed to the need to outlaw collusion between<br />
corporations in fixing prices above their genuinely competitive<br />
level. Last September we introduced legislation to do just that.<br />
Our opponents in the Senate combined-' three times, not just to<br />
oppose this legislation, but to prevent it from even being<br />
debated. 6 </p>
<p>7<br />
Only the Labor State of South Australia has<br />
cod-operated in setting up land commissions to stop the spiral<br />
in residential land prices. The average price for a home<br />
site in Adelaide is $ 5,000 and has begun to stabilise. The<br />
average price in Sydney is $ 18,500 and is still rising.<br />
Not content with obstructing our efforts, our<br />
opponents in their election promises now propose economic.<br />
vandalism. Their policies mean soaking the average<br />
Australian wage and salary earner. They mean cutting back<br />
on opportunities for creative employment. They mean the same<br />
sort of unemployment Mr Snedden as Treasurer created two years<br />
ago. They mean the same rise in indirect taxes which they<br />
imposed when in government they pretended to reduce income tax<br />
in 1970. They mean disrupting our program for help to all<br />
Australian schools. Their policies mean that once again, as<br />
happened so often in the long life of the previous government,<br />
O Australian children year after year will be set back in<br />
their opportunities. When ' ir Snedden speaks of cutting back<br />
on government spending he means cutting back on schools, on<br />
health, on social security. They are the only fields where<br />
meaningful cutbacks can be made. lhy should the children of<br />
Australia, the migrants, the old, the handicapped, the sick,<br />
the retarded, the aborigines, the disadvantaged groups pay<br />
the price for r Snedden's economic fantasies? Let our<br />
opponents say clearly, honestly, unequivocally, that their<br />
weapons in the fight against inflation in Australia are. to be<br />
the children of Australia, the aged of Australia, the<br />
handicapped of Australia, the aborigines of Australia, the<br />
disadvantaged people in our Australian community. For that<br />
is what their policies mean. These are the consequences, the<br />
undoubted consequences of their rag bag of proposals.<br />
Forget their half--bahed proposals and look at the<br />
performance their performance of obstruction in Opposition,<br />
Stheir performance of mismanagement in government.<br />
You will recall how for a disestrous week before<br />
Christmas 1971 the then coalitioc* 9-g-.'-rnment nearly fell<br />
a'part about the internatioual v. 1iue of the Australian dollar.<br />
The Leader of the Country Party the man who wants to be<br />
Treasurer, the man whose remedy fcr inflation is to double the<br />
price of oil threatened to ., ilk out of the government<br />
unless he got his way. And get his disastrous way he did.<br />
Their division as much as their actual decision to devalue did<br />
great harm to Australia in those days. Australia cannot afford<br />
a repetition yet nri. thiig is m'ore certain, than that the<br />
return of our opponents to government would mean deep,<br />
unbridgeable and continuing division and damage on the matter<br />
of the value of the Australian dollar. Division on such a<br />
matter means undermining the strength of the Australian dollar<br />
u </p>
<p>8<br />
Following the decision in 1971, this nation was flooded with<br />
millions of dollars of unwanted foreign capital, capital which<br />
sought to buy Australia up on the cheap. You must not allow<br />
it to happen again.<br />
This vast infusion of foreign money was one of the<br />
root cauces of the inflationary problem which we have faced<br />
ever since we came into government. The men who created<br />
that problem now ask you to give them back the government.<br />
The same men created the major economic prohierm much more<br />
than an economic problem a social and huxian problem which<br />
we first had to face when we came into government. It was<br />
the problem of unemployment. The Budget of 1971 created<br />
Australia's worst unemployment for 10 years. The man who<br />
made that Budget, the Treasurer who presided over that<br />
unemployment, is the present Leader of the Opposition. We<br />
promised to restore full employment. We have restored it.<br />
Every comparable country in the world shares the problem of<br />
inflation. Ile are distinct from all those countries in this:<br />
that in Australia alone, there is._ no unemployment; in<br />
Australia alone, unemployment and inflation do not march side<br />
by side. Our opponents by their divisions,, by their decisions,<br />
started the new round of inflation in Australia. Yet<br />
simultaneously, they created unemployment. And these are the<br />
men who ask you to give them control over your economic-affairs.<br />
V.. </p>
<p>9<br />
TAXATION The new prosperity our policies have created, the<br />
restoration of full employment we have achieved, the rise in<br />
wages and salaries has brought new problems, in particular for<br />
the lower and middle wage and salary earners. It has created<br />
a whole new range of problems and new inequities in the field of<br />
personal taxdtion. In Septenber 1972 our predecessors appointed members<br />
of a Committee under the chairmanship of Ir. Justice Asprey to<br />
inquire into the structure and operation of the present<br />
Commonwealth taxation system and to formulate proposals for<br />
improving the system by making changes in it, abolishing any<br />
existing form of taxation or introducing new forms of taxation.<br />
The Committee was to have regard to the effects of the present<br />
system upon the social, economic and business organisation of<br />
the community and upon the economic and business organisation<br />
Sof the community and upon the economic and efficient use of the<br />
resources of Australia and to the desirability of a fair<br />
distribution of the burden of taxation and of a system of<br />
collection which not unduly complex and did not involve the<br />
public or the administration in undue difficulty, inconvenience<br />
or expense. The Treasurer, Crean, an:-I have had discussions<br />
with the Asprey Committee, which will make a report to us by<br />
I June. Its recommendations will therefore be taken into account<br />
in this year's Budg et, when we shall be giving urgent consieeration<br />
to the restructuring of the taxation system.'<br />
In my Policy Speech in I! ovember 1972 I promised that<br />
we would expand the terms of reference of the Asprey Committee<br />
to include State and Local Government taxation systems and<br />
Scollection methods. The Premiers of South Australia, Western<br />
Australia and Tasmania agreed to coopel. te but the responses of<br />
the other Premiers made it impossible for the Committee to carry<br />
out the expanded inquiry.<br />
Last month, however,. at a Constitutional Convention<br />
standing committee which I chaired, it was decided that Commonwealth<br />
and State officers should confer and report on the<br />
respective occupancy by the Commonwealth, State and Local<br />
Governments of the fields of income taxation, excise dutie2 And<br />
sales tax, vehicle and fuel taxes, death duties and land and<br />
property taxes. ' e shall be consulting fully with the States<br />
on those items of shared taxation, such as death duties, on<br />
which our officers are to report.<br />
The Treasurer has already announced in Parliament that<br />
the estate duty law is to be amended to e-tablish a Board of Relief<br />
to hear applications for release from liability for duty in cases<br />
of serious hardship. Such a Board has proved its worth in the<br />
case of income tax. The estate duty board will be empowered to<br />
release an estate from all or part of the duty payable where<br />
ayment would impose serious hardsh; ip on a beneficiary or<br />
beneficiaries and where relief granted would be for the benefit<br />
of beneficiaries so affected. </p>
<p>10<br />
One aspect of estate duty is particularly unjust<br />
the taxation of the matrimonial home. This practice constitutep<br />
a failure to recognise the role wo; ien play in our society. The<br />
person who looks after the home and the family contributes as<br />
much to the economic value of the family home as the person who<br />
goes to work. In estates in which the matrimonial home or an<br />
interest therein passes to the widow or widower of the deceased<br />
the value of the deceased's interest, up to a limit of $ 35,000,<br />
shall be excluded from the dutiable value of the estate; the<br />
prooortion of the value exempted from duty will be reduced by<br />
2% for every $ 1,000 above this limit.<br />
This is one of the very few completely new undertakings<br />
in this policy speech. It will cost only about $ 10 million<br />
per year but will ensure that no widow or widower will have<br />
to sell the family home in order to meet federal estate duty.<br />
The present income tax law allows concessional<br />
deductions for dependants to Australian resident taxpayers only<br />
where the dependants are themselves resident in Australia. In<br />
Sthe case of a migrant who comes to Australia intending to bring<br />
his wife and children out to this country as soon as he has made<br />
Sa home for them, a period of 5 years is regarded as a reasonable<br />
time for the wife and children to join the migrant in Australia.<br />
If he maintains the family during this period income tax<br />
Sdeductions for the dependants are allowable to him.<br />
However, migrants who . are maintaining dependent<br />
relatives overseas with no view to bringing them to Australia,<br />
or who may be prevented from bringing them to Australia by<br />
restrictive emigration policies in force in some countries, are<br />
unable to qualify for a tax deduction for dependants. It is my<br />
Government's intention to extend the provisions of the income<br />
tax laws governing dependants' deductions so as to entitle people<br />
in these situations to the taxation advantages availale already<br />
to all of us maintaining dependent relatives who reside in<br />
Australia.<br />
SCUSTOMER PROTECTION The Australian Government has already taken<br />
important measures to protect the -safety and economic interests<br />
of customers. They include the 25% tariff cut and decisions<br />
to. ensure cheaper colour television sets and radios. 7iTen<br />
passed, the Trade Practices Bill will make safety stanrlrds<br />
mandatory, and will require specified information to be disclosed<br />
when specified goods an1 services are offered for sale.<br />
Collusive price-fixing by corporations , ill he prohibited and<br />
the protection of customers will be promoted through the<br />
encouragement of a competitive climate in industry. Last year<br />
we established the Interim Commission on Consumer Standards,<br />
which has recommended that a permanent body.. succeed it.<br />
We will establish a Bureau of Customer Protection.<br />
The Bureau will ensure that consumer interests are properly<br />
consulted and represented in all aspects of governmental<br />
activity on consumer protection. </p>

Committees of Enquiry have been great and continuingi. e<br />
arnel. Cormmtltee on * Schools, now instituted as the ' Schools<br />
Cormais Aon, has transformed the outlook for Australian<br />
education. We have* almost doubled Au-stralian G over nmnt fqlr'.<br />
on education. That money has beens distributed Z1CCo1! din-. J to<br />
needs of all schools. Ile have assum&amp; ed full financial reop-: n0--<br />
bility for tertiary education. Vle have. abolished fees for<br />
tertiary and technical education. For the first-time qeare<br />
giving assistance to teachers' colleges and pre-schcol teachers'<br />
colleqecs on the saine basis as univer. si ties andl colle-,; es of<br />
* advanced education. We are giving much more generous allowancens<br />
to studE-nts and have more than trebled the nu.: iber of teaching<br />
scholarships. The parents of Australia well know -and history<br />
* will record that the greatest single achievement of our<br />
* W Government in its first year was to change the face of education<br />
in Australia, and to change the basic attitudles, of the Australian<br />
people towards education. If we had achieved nothing else, iwe<br />
would be remembered for this-that we buried once and for all<br />
the futile and divisive debrate over so-called " State rights" and<br />
" State aid" for s; chools. T. e not only freed vast amounts of money<br />
f or schools; we freed the whole deboate on'education so that froill<br />
now on, parents, teachers, and educcational authorities can engage<br />
rationally in discussion about what is really best for our schools<br />
what is truly best for our chilcdr. n.<br />
Of course, many reforms st.' 1 remain to be made<br />
within the Australian education system. The Schools Commission<br />
is already conducting a study of those -_ rours not receiving full<br />
Wbenefits their schooling.-the culturally dis~ advantaged<br />
* child, the linguistically disadvantaged, the emotionally or<br />
intellectually aisadvantaged. The greatest inequiity in the<br />
* systcem ' how: ever, as the Karmel Cormm-ittee itself remarked, is its<br />
bias ajainst girls: the fact that so few girls as compared to<br />
boys sit for their final sc'-iooP &amp;; rWAS or continue into the<br />
technical trades or enter the brofes:; ions. This is one. th~ e<br />
major reasons w~ hy women are concentyr-ted in the less wjell paid<br />
Jobs in our society. I have as3-ed the Commission to study the<br />
causes of this situation and recomn. nd remedies.<br />
1have drafted a bill to establish a C-urriculum<br />
Deve) opment Centre. </p>
<p>CHILD CARE The advice of the qualified and the concerned m~ en<br />
and women now being made available through our commissions and<br />
enquiries enables the Government to imlpleMent its broad vision<br />
of the nature and purpose of education in a modern society.<br />
Tile want not only to provide wider opportunities for education.<br />
for a lifetime, we want to provide opportunities for a life-ti!. i-e<br />
of education. Such opportunicties must be made available if<br />
Australians are to be able to lead full and happy lives<br />
rewarding to themselves and to the cOmmunity. In a society<br />
undergoing such rapid change a~ s ours, the plain fact is that a<br />
majority of people will changeterocptonmr hnoc<br />
in their lives. Rcdundancy Is no longer the lot of manually<br />
skilled workers alone. Few occupations are going to be left<br />
untouched by the technological revolution.<br />
In the next Parliament our big initiatives in<br />
education will concern the care and education of pre-school<br />
children, technical training, and adult retraining. The<br />
foundations of our initiatives rest on work done by the<br />
Social 11elfare Commission, the Pre-Schools Committee, * the<br />
J'angan Committee on Techni cal and Farther Education arid the<br />
Cochrane Committee on Adult Training and Re-Training.<br />
There are at Dresent about 1.3 million children<br />
of pre-school age. For more than one in four of these children,<br />
there is no parent at hoi-me during wvorking hours. of these only<br />
one in every 10 attends a chill care centre. A child in<br />
Canberra has twice as gjood a chance Lf attending a pre-school<br />
as a child in Victoria and four times as good a chance as a<br />
child in Nlew -South OaJes. least 15,000 children aire left<br />
totally unattendedi] durincj the day. Thousands more are left to<br />
the care of brothers or sisters. Furthermiore, for too many of<br />
our primary school childran there is , here to go outside of<br />
school hours or during vacations. Too rf; any children begin<br />
school with educational, cul tural. or psychological disadvantages.<br />

and expert basis for hold new initiatives to allow technical<br />

* SOICIAL SECURlITY For too long Australia has demeaned herself and<br />

to work, or to engage with full vigor in the xw. ork and leisure<br />
Sof a vig.:-rous community deserved charity but lost their right<br />
Wto self-respect and dignity.<br />
' 1e inherited a system of social welfare based almost<br />
entirely on the% concert of cash payments. We inherited a system<br />

Wto the disa-dvantacjcd sections of the comnmunity onece it h<br />
settled upon the leval of cash payments JFor tho! se dotoeid to be<br />
in need. It was an easy way to fob off our coillectiv conscience.<br />
It was a systefa which took litt-le ' real account oif true : ei<br />
It was a systeia which did nothing at all. to provide its<br />
beneficiaries o; victims -with a chance for dignity, a chance<br />
for rehabilitation, a chance for taking a real place in the<br />
living community. The Social W4elfare Commission has been established to<br />
help the Government set goals for social welfare and to allow<br />
the community to help determine these goals. The public reports<br />
of the Corai: is ion serve as a standlard by which the comt:, unity<br />
can judge the Government's decisions and performance.<br />
Certainly cash payments for all classes of pensions<br />
and welfare benefits have been sign-ificantly increased. </p>
<p>Since taking office, we have increasedi age and invalid<br />
pensions by 30% a significantly greater increase than the rise<br />
in average weekly earnings or prices.<br />
We have introduced a number of new benefits and<br />
improved a number of exci.-ting oiien. Ne introduced the Supporting<br />
:', others Benefit and the Or-phans Pension. We abolished the<br />
discrimination of classes of widowys all widowis nowr receive the<br />

conditions for Aged Personr' Homes, th! 2 Home Care program and<br />

Ile have proceeded to abolish the means test according<br />
to our promised scheO~ ula.<br />
My G~ overnment's ovar-riding concern, however, has<br />
been to overhaul th: entire system so that Australia s-hall be,<br />
as once she was, as she ceased to be in the coalition years, a<br />
pioneer and a l. eader.<br />
The TAustrAlian Assistance Plan has been established<br />
to expand and enh,, ance, co-ordiix atte yet diversi f-y the activities<br />
of welfare agencies, official anu' ; clunt~. ry alike. The Plan<br />

CITIES In all. these matters in education, social security,<br />
health we have had these great objective.;: to reduce inequality,<br />
to promote equality of opportunity, to make the system itself<br />
rmo re efficient and equitable. 7, J1 ther~ ain 3 aire comnbined in<br />
the biggest new effort my cjo'i-evnt has mido_-in our qreat cities,<br />
in our growing centres all around AUStralicz. At last Australia<br />
has a national governmclnt reparc-d to i nvolv e it-, sel f i~ n the<br />

and our centres. </p>
<p>21<br />
We have recognised, as I said in 1972, that " a<br />
national government which cuts itself off from responsibility<br />
for the nation's cities is cutting itself off from the nation's<br />
real. life". In its direct involvement in cities the Australian<br />
Government has entered the mainstream of Australian life. That<br />
new involvement has been central not onl. y to the affairs of<br />
the great majority of Australian people; it is central to our<br />
relations with State government and local government, Pie not<br />
only want to remould, modernise, revitalise our cities; we want<br />
to remould, revitalise, rnodernise the relations between the<br />
three levels of government national, state, local. tl. have<br />
involved the national governmen~ t in matters w . hich previously<br />
were left to the States or not done at all. If they were left<br />
to the States,* they were too often done inadequately, or not<br />
done at all. If left to local government,. they were too often<br />
done inadequately, finaaced unfairly or not done at all.<br />
0 In this field we have had some examples of splendid<br />
co-operation with the States yet equally we have met some of the<br />
worst obstruction f rom the States.<br />
The Albury/ Uodoiga agreemennt. to create Australia's<br />
first large centre away from the seaboard since the found.' ing of<br />
Canberra has been a splendid example * of co-operation. . Je have<br />
also made agreements with the States for new growth cent)-es,<br />
finarice for sewerage and grants for urban transport. It would<br />
have been unheard of until 1972 that an Australian national<br />
governinent should involve itself di rectly ip regional development,<br />
s-ei\: eracge, urban.-trcunsport. Because previous national governments<br />
even with all their atonopo ly over the really big and gro..,; ing<br />
sources of revenue, w-, ould not involve themselves, nothing effective<br />
* was ever done about c~ ecentralisation; our great cities had the<br />
largest unsewered areas of any comparable cities in the world;<br />
and our urban transport systems were app&gt;-:, a ching breakdown. Of<br />
c~.~: cit hats been impossible in so short a time to reverse<br />
the trendis rc-. salting from decades of neglect. But we have made<br />

LOCAL GOVERNIMENT Yet crucial to making a good continuationi andl a gcod<br />
culmination of these efforts i~ s the role of local goveroi. cnt'.<br />
And it must 1be sai. 1 tChat our efforts to raise the status of<br />
local govern~ ment and to give local government direct access to<br />
th1 nation's finances have met with scant co-operation from<br />
state governments. Ie huave sought to wake local government a genuine<br />
vlrtrtner in f~ ha ; stc T liñ. rvi c. '~ ll1: the<br />

on the amounts of ri,. nay needed to rek-1tce inequalitjes between<br />
regions and within States.-as traditionally it used. to do as<br />
between the States,. </p>
<p>-22-<br />
The role we assign to local governmenit is the real<br />
answer to charges of centralismn. Under a variety of programs<br />
we'have provided local governm-ient with the funds to undertake a<br />
range o activiti-es previously inadequately carried out or<br />
totally neglected. The Auistralian Assistance Plan, the programs<br />
for community health, area imp--rovemnent-, the national estate,<br />
the arts, tourism and recreation a d aborigines all these<br />
provide funds for commrnunity activities to be orqanised by local<br />
government. We deliberately have made and shall make local<br />
government a vehicle for our lcgislation on aged persons' homes<br />
and hostels, sheltered employment, han-dicapped children, mea ls<br />
on wheels, home care and nursing, nursing homies and homeless men<br />
and woi-men. These are all activities which cannot be close],,. y<br />
regulated from the centre and are best planned and implemented<br />
by local government workingq with local communities. They justify<br />
assistance fromn the nation'Is finances but not increases in rates.<br />
W~ e insisted on local, gover-nment representation' at<br />
the Convention on the Constitution in September last year~. We<br />
made local government representation a condition of part iciJ-pation<br />
by the national government.<br />
0At that Convention I put the case for local govevnment<br />
representation on the Loan Council.. The States' Premiers then,<br />
and at a special Premiers' Conference in Octolber, turned down<br />
our proposal that local governiment should have a voice vid a vote<br />
in the Loan Counzcil. Tie forhreferendum now boc": ore you will take the<br />
next crucial step in raising the status of local governriepnt. It<br />
wil. l enable the national government to make grants direct: to<br />
local yoenetbodies, if they wish, zand to borrow m,-oney on<br />
* their behalf, if they wish. Only if this is done can local<br />
governmtent acquire reasonable access to '' le nation's finances.<br />
Only if this is done can local governmenz carry out, the increasing<br />
responsibilities and bear the increasing . h-urdcer-s vyhich federal<br />
and state governments alike iimrpose upocn it and which the p.-eople<br />
* need. Only if this is done can inequality between regions be<br />
reduced. It remains true, as I said in 1972, that more anid more<br />
the standard of life of the Australian citizen depends not<br />
so much on how much hie earns but % Z1tre he lives.<br />

difficult of all our inheritances fromn the previous government.<br />
During the two year: s prior to Deceniber 1972, there was a miassive<br />
growth in money supply within Aust-ralia and vast sums were<br />
channelled to the housing industry for private dwellig<br />
con struct ion. The result of this was that the housinrl industry<br />
became grossly over-extended, long delays occurred in the supply<br />
of materials and labour to building sites, construction times<br />
were greatly extended and excessive cost risQs became the order<br />
of the day. Public housing-proqrairs-for which thle government<br />
provided a record assistance of $ 21l8.65 million in .1973/ 74 were<br />
not being fulfilled because of the demand for resources in private<br />
housing and other building construction. </p>

FORE~ IGN CONTROL OF RESOU31CES<br />
The national estate belongs to all Australians.<br />
We have accepted the responsibility of the national government<br />
to help protect it arid preserve i~ t for the benefit of all<br />
Australians. Equally, we have accepted our responsibility<br />
to protect Australia's resources ' S thtIecfrh utain<br />
will have a greater share in the control and ownership of<br />
their own resources. We have tried to stop the gre at Australian<br />
sell-out. We have tried to help Australians buy Australia<br />
back. In these aims we have met unrelenting obstruction from<br />
our opponents. For years the Australian Labor Party advanced<br />
the idea of the Australian Industr,-y Dc velopment Corp~ oration<br />
Sand in 1972 undertook to expaiid iLs activi-ties: to enable it to<br />
3join aith Aun'L-ralian arnd foreilgr companie-s in the discovery,<br />
development and proces sinq of Austral ian resources. Eight mon ths<br />
ago we introc2uced the legislation; the Senate stalled it.<br />
Con. 1 anion legislation for the National Investment Fund had tlhe<br />
* Same fate. Through this fund wo intend to holp ord~ inary<br />
Australians invest in the devc,.' pwm nt of thei~ r own re,-_ source~ s<br />
and industries instead of subuidising to the tune of millions,<br />
foreign investors and nmulti-n~ itional corporations. T' e F.<br />

bonds to both~ irivate and i~ Lt* inl: n~ ios<br />
Further, the Senate twice re-jected the Pe-trol and<br />
.1inrals Authority Iill. Th1is is designed-as our basic<br />
instrument for ensurinig dcveloprrent of our energy and mineral<br />
Sresources and to maximise thec ownership and control. of th. CEse<br />
W resources by 1' Australians. It was another of th~ e me,_ aSures'-on<br />
which the Governor-General yranted the double dissolution<br />
and it also will be Yrmtbyebfoocrhet the new Parliament.<br />
Our opponents pattern. of resistance to measures<br />
Wdesigned to promote Australian ownership forms part of a<br />
pattern of encouragement of foreign ownership they set when<br />
in Government. The great sell-out occurred when they formed the<br />
Government. They are still the apologiists for forcei-. n ownorship.<br />
Their return to office w~ ould agJain olpen iw. ide the door. As a'<br />
result of thieir policies, 68 of our cnerm' resources are<br />
controlled overseas. just how wide our opPonients opened t ' he door<br />
is now being revealed. T * he Departrent of H'inerali; and Energy<br />
set up by this Government has now received a thoroughly<br />

190,000 rural holdings this year is about 000. Tne average<br />
for the previou5 6 years was less than $ 6,000. Our policies<br />
have contributed in no small measure. In particular, we have<br />
sought aid! to farmers to take the hetadvantage of present<br />
