THE BUDGCT<br />
Interviewer Paul Lynch<br />
Q. Prime Minister, first of all, the Budget that was<br />
brought down by Mr Snedden last night obviously not in any<br />
sense a revolutionary Budget. It is pretty much the mixture<br />
as before with some taxes raised, others lowered. What would<br />
you say in response to this assessment of the Budget?<br />
PM I don't think that is the correct assessment.<br />
But naturally enough, the basic needs of life have to be<br />
treated in the Budget first, such as pensions, and similar<br />
types of matters. On this occasion, not only have we<br />
introduced a number of novel features but they have all been<br />
important. You rightly mentioned our proposals relating to the<br />
abolition of the means test, but we have also introduced childminding<br />
centres for those people who have to go to work and<br />
can't have their kiddies looked after. We have introduced' for<br />
the first time a totally new idea relating to the wives of<br />
pensioners, the wives of invalids and of certain types of<br />
beneficiaries of repatriation. They will now get pensions<br />
even though they are not eligible at the present time. We<br />
have introduced a very substantial change relating to payment<br />
of estate duty. So, too, have we introduced a change of another<br />
kind that I think will be invaluable to oeonle on superannuation<br />
because we have introduced a means by which they will not only<br />
get a greater pension but, as they get older, the pension or<br />
their right to pension will increase. So these are all new,<br />
and in addition, I think I should make one other comment to you,<br />
and it relates to our National Health Scheme. Because we have<br />
now adopted a practice by which we can ensure that to whatever<br />
extent it is practicable, the neonle who go into a nursing home,<br />
or who get nursing attention at home, or whose relatives are<br />
willing to look after them, will receive ? ssistance of a kind<br />
that has never been done in Australian history before. Now I<br />
could go on like this for a considerable time, but I think that<br />
is a big enough series of issues on which I can emphatically / 2 </p>
<p>-2<br />
( PM Contd.)<br />
state that I think there are more revolutionary changes in this<br />
Budget than you mentioned and I think more revolutionary<br />
changes than I have known in any other Budget for the twenty-two<br />
years I have been in Parliament.<br />
Q. Prime Minister, you have been talking very largely<br />
in terms of benefits which will accrue as a result of this Budget,<br />
that is the outgo side of the Commonwealth Government's<br />
finances. on the incoming side of your finances, with this<br />
ten per cent cut in personal income tax, do you feel there is<br />
any risk you won't be able to pay the larger social service<br />
bills?<br />
PM: No risk whatsoever because the Commonwealth always<br />
has the power to be able to pay for the promises it makes and<br />
the legislation it introduces. But I think you do open up one<br />
other subject that in time has to be answered, and that is whether<br />
or not this could create what is called inflation by demand.<br />
I. don't think so. The simple fact is that today the economy<br />
is not ticking over as rapidly or as well as we want it to do,<br />
and consequently this is an occasion when we should have<br />
internal deficit financing even of a substantial kind. It is<br />
my belief as one who has had a pretty good record for economic<br />
management as the Treasurer, I believe what we have done is<br />
just about right, and I think it will turn out to be right in the<br />
long run too.<br />
Q. Prime Minister, have you a figure for this internal<br />
deficit that you were talking about?<br />
PM: Yes, I believe it is about $ 60 million.<br />
Q. So obviously you think this is sound economically,<br />
the whole Budget picture. I would ask you, Sir, whether you<br />
consider it sound in political terms. You have heard the<br />
reactions or read the reactions of Mr Whitlam. and of Mr Hawke<br />
and of other critics of the Budget. What do you have to say<br />
about the points they have made?<br />
PM: Well, I have answered the question already about<br />
economic problems and whether I think this is sound economic<br />
management from a national point of view. I know it is, on<br />
the facts as we know them at present. But as to the political<br />
items that arise by Mr Hawke who seems now to have assumed the<br />
role of the titular leader of the Labor Party, and Mr Whitlam,<br />
I have this to say. Mr Hawke is talking about everything, and<br />
I do not believe that he has a proper understanding of the<br />
problems that are involved and what should be done. But if you<br />
saw him on television last night, I think he created the impression<br />
that there should have been a greater deficit than the one<br />
that we have agreed to. Our attitude has been flexibility, and<br />
if we felt we were not doing enough, of course we could do more </p>
<p>I It. </p>
<p>3<br />
( PPI Contd.)<br />
on a subsequent occasion. But as I spid, on the facts as<br />
we know them at the moment, we think ~ ehavea done exactly<br />
what is right, and those viewas are supporteO. by the<br />
financial authorities, those who give us the advice on<br />
which the Budget is drafted. As to M-r Whitlam, quite<br />
frankly, and I don't lik; saying thisr-too rpuch, blit Mr<br />
Wqhitl-Yn k-nows nothing at all about economics or finance,<br />
and those who listen to him in the H-ouse will know just how<br />
barren of economic and financlal % nowledge hz is. He is<br />
playing politics, he doe'-7n't care what the inipact of h.-is<br />
statements might be. rWe have to take our action. We must<br />
be responsible for what h'an<br />
Q. Turning to w. 7-on's issue-s this year, thore have<br />
been two leading issues that womien have been pressing for<br />
this year so far asking for relief in the :, 3udqret in two<br />
forms. One is child-minding centres, and the ot Lhor is the<br />
reduction or the abolition of the salc! 3 tax on contraceptives<br />
of 27 txor cant sales tax. You havno indeed entered the field<br />
of Commonealth-funded child-minding centres. FWhy did you<br />
not tacklle the iA* ssue of contraceptives?<br />
PM: We didn't tacklc any of th-issu associated<br />
with oales tax on any type of goods, or for that matter on<br />
Motor vcehicles. ntd de-id not lookV at the question of<br />
the abolition of sales ax on contraeceptives.<br />
Q. Two ancillary poi , nts, Sir. FirstI of all, outside<br />
the Budget tslyou IhFav announced that your Government's<br />
policy on the povorty is.-uo h;: s changed and you are appointing<br />
a national encuirY inti-novart". Why this change, Sir?<br />
I perscmally acccp-ted the vi-ew1, -ind I have<br />
said it over and over again, that TI believe it is the<br />
responsibility of eve-ry Government to find out where the poverty<br />
line is, and t-hen to make adequate provisi-on in the<br />
Budget or outside the Bhudget if necessary in order to,<br />
ensure that the pnverty line is at least cove-: red with.-something<br />
to snare for the beneficiaries. Now wIe have had thIe<br />
advantage in recent years of a Fo~ ndorsnn Group ' Report on<br />
Poverty in Melb-ourne an invaluable document. a study in<br />
dpth by pople wIho knrow, what they are talking a) bout. A-nd<br />
in our Budget or -prior to the 3ud'-get I had decidod that<br />
this would be our guideline to de-cide whe-: re reform should<br />
take place; as for exaimple in the case of pensions, in the<br />
case of widow),-s, in the case of invalids,, and also, a--s I<br />
have mentioned before, in the case of hiealth, that is in the<br />
nursing homes and home nursing attenticn. Now,%, my colleague </p>
<p>-4<br />
( PM Contd.)<br />
the Minister of Social Services will, during the course of the<br />
next few days, show exactly what we have done, and I think in<br />
every case, with two or probably three exceptions, you will see<br />
that the benefits we have given take t,. he people involved above<br />
the pcverty line. Now, therefore, this is a remarkably good<br />
achievement and one of which I happen to be proud. So this is<br />
not a bad time in which a poverty enquiry can a new poverty<br />
enquiry can be carried out. That is why I decided, because<br />
the churches were pressing so strongly, and others were pressing<br />
so strongly that against the background that we have created<br />
or the foundations we have created, that I was willing once<br />
again to look at the problem of whether we would have a poverty<br />
enquiry, and we decided that we would do so, and I announced<br />
it yesterday.<br />
Q. And the other ancillary point, Sir, it struck some<br />
people as curious that the day before the bringing down of the<br />
Budget that the Treasurer would announce the terms of his<br />
enquiry into income tax and other taxation reforms. Will it bc<br />
a year before the results of these enquiries can be reflected<br />
in any future Budget or Government fisacl policies?<br />
PM: Longer than that, I believe, unless the Commissioner<br />
in his wisdom desires, or intends to make preliminary or<br />
reports from time to time. That is up to him. I have not<br />
given it very great thought as to whether he should do so, but<br />
I hope he does. But the report will take some considerable time.<br />
I doubt whether we will be able to get the final report within<br />
a period of one or two years. But we haven't waited for that.<br />
In fact, on the average, we reduced income tax by ten per cent.<br />
and we gave the greatest benefits to those on the smaller<br />
incomes. And people on $ 20 or less per week will not be<br />
required to put in income tax returns unless special<br />
circumstances exist. So we haven't waited until this report<br />
has been fully completed. As we believe the need or the<br />
necessity arises, we will tcae action. We have already taken<br />
action in fact, and if we have to take action in the future,<br />
we will do so. Prime Minister, thank you. </p>
