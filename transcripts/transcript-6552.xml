CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY EBRODUTL1P<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
-AUSTRALIAN BUSINESS WOMAN OF THE YEAR, SYDNEY, 15 NOVEMBER 1984<br />
IAM VERY PLEASED TO BE HERE TODAY TO PRESENT THE AWARD OF<br />
BUSINESS WOMAN OF THE YEAR. I AM ESPECIALLY PROUD TO BE<br />
ASSOCIATED WITH AN AWARD WHICH ENCOURAGES WOMEN TO STRIVE<br />
FOR SUCCESS FOR EXCELLENCE IN THE WORLD OF BUSINESS.<br />
WHEN TREVOR KENNEDY ASKED ME SEVERAL MONTHS AGO IF I WOULD<br />
PRESENT THIS YEAR'S AWARD, I WAS HAPPY TO ACCEPT.<br />
MY CONGRATULATIONS GO TO THE AUSTRALIAN CONSOLIDATED PRESS, 0<br />
PUBLISHERS OF THE BULLETIN, AND TO QANTAS FOR PROMOTING THIS<br />
MOST SIGNIFICANT AWARD. IT HIGHLIGHTS THE DIVERSE CONTRIBUTION<br />
WOMEN ARE MAKING To AUSTRALIA'S ECONOMIC LIFE. WOMEN'S EFFORTS,<br />
BE THEY IN SMALL,-ONE-WOMAN OPERATIONS OR IN LARGE AND<br />
EXPANDING ENTERPRISES, ARE INTEGRAL TO'THE CONTINUED PROSPERITY<br />
OF AUSTRALIA.<br />
THE ANNUAL QANTAS/ BULLETIN BUSINESS WOMAN OF THE YEAR AWARD<br />
RECOGNISES THE CONTRIBUTION OF WOMEN TO AUSTRALIAN BUSINESS,<br />
WOMEN ARE MAKING AN INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT IMPACT IN<br />
THE BUSINESS WOR~ LD. THE GOVERNMENT WELCOMES THIS PROGRESS AND<br />
THE ENCOURAGEI-liET IT RECEIVES FROM AWARDS SUCH AS THIS. 2/.<br />
EMBARGOED UNTIL 1 PM </p>
<p>FOR OUR PART, WE AS A GOVERNMENT ARE ALSO ENCOURAGING WOMEN<br />
TO REALISE THEIR FULL POTENTIAL. WE HAVE UNDERWAY AN<br />
AFFIRMATIVE ACTION PILOT PROGRAM IN COOPERATION WITH A<br />
NUMBER OF AUSTRALIA'S MAJOR COMPANIES.<br />
THROUGH THIS PROGRAM, THE GOVERNMENT IS ENCOURAGING EMPLOYERS<br />
TO GIVE GREATER OPPORTUNITIES TO WOMEN, WE HAVE DONE SO<br />
KNOWING FULL WELL THAT THE OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF WOMEN<br />
IN THE WORKFORCE ARE TO BE FOUND IN ONLY A VERY SMALL NUMBER<br />
OF OCCUPATIONS.<br />
WE ARE ENCOURAGING EMPLOYERS TO PROVIDE OPPORTUNITIES FOR<br />
WOMEN WHO WOULD LIKE TO M4OVE OUT OF ' TRADITIONAL' WOMEN'S<br />
JOBS INTO MANAGEMENT OR SUPERVISORY ROLES OR INTO OCCUPATIONS<br />
WHICH IN THE PAST HAVE BEEN LARGELY CLOSED TO WOMEN.<br />
WE ARE ALSO ENCOURAGING EMPLOYERS TO CONCENTRATE THEIR EFFORTS<br />
TOWARDS ENSURING THAT EXISTING EMPLOYEES AND NEW STAFF TAKE<br />
FULL ADVANTAGE OF ACTUAL OR POTENTIAL TRAINING AND<br />
PROMOT IONAL OPPORTUNITIES.<br />
THE AFFIRMATIVE ACTION RESEARCH UNIT IN THE OFFICE OF THE STATUS<br />
OF WOMEN REPORTS THAT PROGRESS TO DATE IS VERY ENCOURAGING.<br />
MOST PARTICIPANTS HAVE ALREADY CHANGED THE WAY THEY ADVERTISE<br />
JOBS, AND HAVE INFORMED THEIR EMPLOYEES OF T1HEIR DETERMINATION<br />
TO REMOVE ANY CONTINUING DISCRIMINATION IN TH4EIR EMPLOYMENT<br />
PRACTICES. THEY HAVE ALSO BEGUN CONSULTING WITH EMPLOYEES<br />
AND UNIONS ON MEASURES TO IMPROVE THE REPRESENTATION OF WOMEN IN<br />
ALL AREAS AND AT ALL LEVELS WITHIN THEIR ORGANISATIONSI a s </p>
<p>7<br />
SOCIAL CHANGE CAN OFTEN EVOKE HOSTILE COMMUNITY REACTION.<br />
ONLY COMMUNITY SUPPORT FOR PROGRESSIVE MEASURES WILL ENSURE<br />
THEY ARE ENDURING. OUR GRADUALIST APPROACH To AFFIRMATIVE<br />
ACTION, GUIDED BY CLEAR PRINCIPLES AND OBJECTIVES, WILL<br />
DO PRECISELY THAT IN THE CASE OF THIS INITIATIVE.<br />
ON BEHALF OF THE GOVERNMENT I THANK THOSE THIRTY-ONE<br />
PARTICIPANTS IN THE PILOT PROGRAM. THE GOVERNMENT VALUES<br />
THE CONSIDERABLE EFFORTS OF ALL THOSE INVOLVED.<br />
ANOTHIER VITAL MEASURE TO HELP REMOVE DISCRIMINATION AGAINST<br />
WOMEN-IN THE WORKPLACE AND THE EDUCATION SYSTEM IS OUR<br />
SEX DISCRIMINATION LEGISLATION PASSED EARLIER THIS YEAR.<br />
As WELL, WE HAVE APPOINTED MORE THAN 100 WOMEN To GOVERNMENT<br />
BOARDS AND AUTHORITIES.<br />
WOMEN ARE ALSO STARTING TO ACHIEVE THEIR RIGHTFUL PLACE<br />
AMONG THE SENIOR RANKS OF THE AUSTRALIAN PUBLIC SERVICE.<br />
SINCE WE CAME TO OFFICE LAST YEAR THE NUMBER OF WOMEN IN<br />
WHAT IS NOW TERMED THE SENIOR EXECUTIVE SERVICE HAS MORE<br />
THAN DOUBLED$ 8494.1/ 0 </p>
<p>THE GOVERNMENT RECOGNISES THAT THE AVAILABILITY OF CHILD CARE<br />
FOR AUSTRALIAN FAMILIES IS IMPORTANT FOR MANY WOMEN. IN MY<br />
POLICY SPEECH ON TUESDAY I PROMISED THAT IN OUR NEXT TERM<br />
WE WOULD ADD AN ADDITIONAL 20,000 CHILD CARE PLACES AN<br />
INCREASE OF ONE THIRD. THIS WILL PARTICULARLY ASSIST WOMEN<br />
WANTING TO PARTICIPATE FULLY IN THE WORKFORCE.<br />
I P) ISCUSSED THE ISSUE OF CHILD CARE AND OTHER MATTERS LAST<br />
WEEK WITH MEMBERS OF THE NATIONAL WOMEN's CONSULTATIVE<br />
COUNCIL, THE BODY CHARGED WITH CONVEYING THE VIEWS OF WOMEN<br />
TO THE GOVERNMENT. AT THAT MEETING WE ALSO DISCUSSED<br />
TAXATION. I ASSURED MEMBERS THAT THEY WOULD BE REPRESENTED<br />
AT THE TAXATION SUMMIT NEXT YEAR AND WOULD HAVE THE<br />
OPPORTUNITY TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE DOCUMENTS WHICH WILL BE<br />
CONSIDERED AT THE SUMMIT. THE GOVERNMENT IS AWARE OF<br />
CONCERN AMONG SOME WOMEN ABOUT ASPECTS OF THE PRESENT<br />
TAXATION SYSTEM SUCH-AS ITS INTERACTION WITH iTHE INCOME<br />
SECURITY SYSTEM.<br />
POSITIVE CHANGE OCCURS THROUGH THE ACTIONS OF INDIVIDUALS.<br />
TODAY WE SALUTE THE EXCELLENCE OF ONE WOMAN IN BUSINESS,<br />
THE AWARD OF AUSTRALIAN BUSINESS WOMAN OF THE YEAR HAS<br />
TENDED TO GO TO WOMEN WHO HAVE SUCCESSFULLY RUN THEIR<br />
OWN BUSINESSES. BUT THIS YEAR's AWARD WILL GO TO ANl<br />
OUTSTAND ING EMPLOYEE. a </p>
<p>I HAVE GREAT PLEASURE IN ANNOUNCING THAT THE WINNER-OF THE<br />
AUSTRALIAN BUSINESS WOMAN OF THE YEAR FOR 1984 IS BEVERLY.<br />
HANCOCK. THIS YEAR'S WINNER IS THE DEPUTY MANAGING DIRECTOR AND<br />
