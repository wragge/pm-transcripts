    <content><![CDATA[<p>E&amp;OE...............................................................................................................................</p>
<p>Thank you very much. I have had the privilege today of opening</p>
<p>   two new facilities which are both very fine facilities for employing</p>
<p>   Australians in my electorate. I am especially delighted to be here</p>
<p>   at JTEC to acknowledge the enormous contribution that it has made</p>
<p>   to high tech in Australia. To particularly acknowledge the heavy</p>
<p>   investment of this company in research and development and also,</p>
<p>   if I may, ladies and gentlemen, remark upon the fact that I am opening</p>
<p>   today a manufacturing facility.</p>
<p>And in the context of a debate that will rage very vigorously over</p>
<p>   the weeks and months ahead, there is no section of Australian business</p>
<p>   which will benefit more from tax reform than the manufacturing sector.</p>
<p>   One of the greatest liabilities of our existing indirect tax system</p>
<p>   is that it discriminates against manufacturing. And it is beyond</p>
<p>   my belief if I can strike, if you'll forgive me, a slightly</p>
<p>   partisan note, it is beyond my belief that the Australian Council</p>
<p>   of Trade Unions and the Australian Labor Party who draw very heavily</p>
<p>   on the membership of manufacturing unions in Australia, should continue</p>
<p>   to oppose taxation reform that will benefit Australian manufacturing.</p>
<p>   Because if we can give Australian manufacturing more jobs, a better</p>
<p>   tax system then Australian manufacturing, whether it is in this</p>
<p>   area, this very high tech area, or it's in other areas, then</p>
<p>   there's the prospect of generating more jobs. </p>
<p>Now, I take the opportunity of making it very plain to all of you</p>
<p>   this morning and through this gathering to the Australian public,</p>
<p>   that my Government, the Government is resolutely committed to reforming</p>
<p>   Australia's taxation system. We're resolutely committed</p>
<p>   to reforming Australia's tax system because it would be good</p>
<p>   for the Australian economy. Now is not the time to turn away from</p>
<p>   necessary change and reform. You said quite rightly Mr Chairman</p>
<p>   that it's a tough market out there. It is. It is hard to export.</p>
<p>   There's a lot of import competition. Therefore, what we should</p>
<p>   be doing as a Government is making it easier for you. And one of</p>
<p>   the ways we make it easier for exporters, for manufacturers, is</p>
<p>   to take the [inaudible] of the wholesales sales tax off their backs</p>
<p>   and replace it with something that's a bit fairer and a bit</p>
<p>   more even handed a bit more encouraging and a bit more beckoning</p>
<p>   to people who are prepared to invest in manufacturing. </p>
<p>For years we have heard quite properly people in manufacturing</p>
<p>   industry say why don't governments do more to help Australian</p>
<p>   manufacturing. I can't think of anything that governments could</p>
<p>   do that would more assist Australian manufacturing than to give</p>
<p>   them a decent taxation system. And the big winners out of tax reform</p>
<p>   will be manufacturing, and their employees, and the people who oppose</p>
<p>   tax reform are opposing manufacturing and opposing manufacturing</p>
<p>   employees. And having said that Mr Chairman, can I also say how</p>
<p>   delighted I am about the contribution that your company is making</p>
<p>   to the amenity of the Bennelong electorate. The people you employ,</p>
<p>   the fact that you are at the leading edge. I was taken on a tour</p>
<p>   of the facilities and it was explained to me just what this company</p>
<p>   does, and the contribution that it makes and the influence that</p>
<p>   it exerts over the high-tech industry and the information technology</p>
<p>   industry of Australia. And it is very significant. And you can't</p>
<p>   really think of the Australia of the future and the reliance of</p>
<p>   that future on information technology and high-technology without</p>
<p>   factoring in the contribution of JTEC.</p>
<p>I understand, ladies and gentlemen, that the new products produced</p>
<p>   in the JTEC technology centre, have in fact produced the best order</p>
<p>   intake in the Australian market in any six month period in JTEC's</p>
<p>   11 year history. And this milestone, I am also very happy to say,</p>
<p>   was achieved just this morning due to an order from the Department</p>
<p>   of Foreign Affairs and Trade. So I am very happy Sir that that particular</p>
<p>   Branch of the Government is living out your request and your injunction</p>
<p>   for Government help in terms of being a good customer and a very</p>
<p>   ready buyer.</p>
<p>It's become, of course, a cliche and almost given for any</p>
<p>   speech that is made about the current state and about the future</p>
<p>   of the Australian economy to speak of the way in which in information</p>
<p>   technology has changed our lives. Without any argument, information</p>
<p>   technology and the changes that it has brought about is exerting</p>
<p>   the greatest influence on the economic structure of the world of</p>
<p>   any event since the industrial revolution. And the way in which</p>
<p>   it has transformed the working lives of people, the way in which</p>
<p>   it has opened up opportunities for people is of enormous significance.</p>
<p>   And the way in which it has created the opportunity for new jobs</p>
<p>   to be created providing we are innovative enough, we provide enough</p>
<p>   support for research and development and providing we get those</p>
<p>   other fundamentals of the economy that need to be changed, such</p>
<p>   as the tax system, right. </p>
<p>So I speak here with an enormous amount of optimism as I did at</p>
<p>   the opening of the GEC Marconi plant in North Ryde this morning.</p>
<p>   Because in both cases we are talking about leading edge companies</p>
<p>   employing highly skilled people. We are also talking about a highly</p>
<p>   trained culturally diverse workforce which is making a tremendous</p>
<p>   contribution to our country and making a tremendous contribution</p>
<p>   to what our companies can offer the rest of the world. The Asian</p>
<p>   region is going through a great deal of economic turmoil at the</p>
<p>   present time. I dismiss out-of-hand talk of depression. I point</p>
<p>   to the strengths of the Australian economy - our low inflation,</p>
<p>   our low interest rates, our strong budget surplus and our strong</p>
<p>   levels of business investment. We have been able to weather the</p>
<p>   meltdown in Asia much better than would have been the case if different</p>
<p>   approaches had been adopted.</p>
<p>And I am very pleased that this country has been able to play its</p>
<p>   part in helping those in the Asian region that have been knocked</p>
<p>   around by the economic meltdown. And what the events of the past</p>
<p>   few months have told us is that in the modern world of globalisation</p>
<p>   you can never rest. You must always be seeking out those further</p>
<p>   changes that are needed to strengthen the country and the economy</p>
<p>   further against challenges from abroad. A year ago nobody was predicting</p>
<p>   the Asian downturn or if they did they took great care not to tell</p>
<p>   anybody or not to record it anywhere. The fact is that it took us</p>
<p>   all a little bit by surprise and that's just the point I make</p>
<p>   that you must always assume the unexpected and you must always take</p>
<p>   care to ensure that the foundations of your economy are as strong</p>
<p>   as possible. And we've done that and the next big steps to</p>
<p>   make them even stronger is to clean up and reform and change our</p>
<p>   taxation system. </p>
<p>This is a globalised world. We are influenced by what happens in</p>
<p>   other countries. If we make ourselves strong domestically, if we</p>
<p>   encourage efficient industries and highly trained people employed</p>
<p>   by them then we can withstand without too much damage to ravages</p>
<p>   of economic downturns in other parts of the world. Asia will come</p>
<p>   back again, it will back with a vengeance. It still represents a</p>
<p>   huge export market for Australia. Of course we must diversify our</p>
<p>   exports. We've been doing that, this Government has been doing</p>
<p>   that over the last two and a quarter years and will continue to</p>
<p>   do it. But nobody should imagine that the Asian market, because</p>
<p>   of recent months, is in any way lost in the long-term to Australia</p>
<p>   - quite the reverse. There are new opportunities opening up all</p>
<p>   the time. </p>
<p>But to you Mr Riedl and to all of your colleagues, and particularly</p>
<p>   to your workforce, we make a tremendous contribution in their skilled</p>
<p>   way to the success of your company. I thank you for inviting me</p>
<p>   and I have very great pleasure in declaring this facility open and</p>
<p>   I hope you make lots of money. I hope you employ many more people.</p>
<p>   I hope you sell many of your products overseas and you will be greatly</p>
<p>   aided in that process by the new taxation system that this Government</p>
<p>   is going to give to the Australian people. </p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
