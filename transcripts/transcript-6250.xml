    <content><![CDATA[<p>CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY CHECK AGAINST DELEIMVEBRAYR GOED UNTIL 7.00 P. M.<br />PRIME MINMSTER<br />SPEECH BY THE PRIME ' MINISTER<br />AUSTRALIAN MERCHANT BANKERS' ASSOCIATION<br />28 OCTOBER 1983<br />IT IS PARTICULARLY TIMELY THAT I SHOULD ADDRESS THIS<br />ASSOCIATION TONIGHT.<br />AT THE BROADEST LEVEL, IT IS TIMELY BECAUSE THE ECONOMIC<br />ENVIRONMENT MAKES IT APPROPRIATE TO GIVE EVEN HIGHER<br />PRIORITY TO LONG-TERM ISSUES RELATED TO THE EFFICIENCY,<br />GROWTH AND RELATIVE STANDING OF THE AUSTRALIAN ECONOMY<br />IN A COMPETITIVE WORLD.<br />IT IS TIMELY AS WELL BECAUSE THE GOVERNMENT WILL SOON BE<br />RECEIVING THE MARTIN COMMITTEE'S-RECOMMENDATIONS ON<br />FINANCIAL REFORM.<br />IN ADDITION, ON ANOTHER MATTER OF CONSIDERABLE INTEREST<br />TO YOUR MEMBERSHIP, MY GOVERNMENT WILL SOON BE COMPLETING<br />ITS REVIEW OF THE FOREIGN INVESTMENT GUIDELINES.<br />AND IT IS MOST TIMELY BECAUSE, FORTUITOUSLY, THIS EVENING<br />1 AM ABLE TO DESCRIBE TO YOU SOME CHANGES IN THE SYSTEMWITHIN<br />,'; HICH THE FOREIGN EXCHANGE VALUE OF THE AUSTRALIAN<br />DOLLAR IS DETERMINED,</p>
<p>THE CONTRIBUTION OF MERCHANT BANKS TO THE ECONOMY SINCE THE<br />EARLY 197Us HAS BEEN SIGNIFICANT, AS DEMONSTRATED BY THE<br />25.5 PER CENT AVERAGE ANNUAL RATE OF GROWTH OF TOTAL ASSETS<br />OF MONEY MARKET CORPORATIONS BETWEEN 1971 AND 1983.<br />COMMANDING TOTAL A-SSETS OF $ 13,8 BILLION, AND, AT JUNE<br />1983, PROVIDING MORE THAN 10 PER CENT OF TOTAL LOANS<br />OUTSTANDING FROM BANK AND NON-BANK SOURCES, THE MERCHANT<br />BANKS HAVE BECOME AN IMPORTANT PART OF THE AUSTRALIAN ECONOMY.<br />MERCHANT BANKS NOW PLAY A VIRTUALLY INDISPENSABLE ROLE IN<br />THE EFFICIENT PROVISION OF FINANCIAL SERVICES TO THE. COMMUNITY,<br />THIS HAS HAPPENED NOT ONLY BECAUSE THEY HAVE BEEN ABLE TO<br />EXPLOIT AREAS IN BUSINESS CLOSED TO tMORE REGULATED FINANCIAL<br />INTERMEDIARIES, BUT ALSO BECAUSE THE DYNAMISM AND COMPETITIVE<br />SPIRIT OF MERCHANT BANKS HAS LED TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW<br />MARKETS EVEN WITHIN THE AREAS OPEN TO THE REGULATED SECTOR,<br />THERE IS NOW A LONG LIST OF INNOVATIONS THAT MERCHANT BANKS<br />HAVE INTRODUCED OR -TO WHICH THEY HAVE ADDED IMPETUS.<br />WITHOUT THE INNOVATIONS MERCHANT BANKS HAVE INTRODUCED IN<br />PROMISSORY NOTES AND A SECONDARY MARKET IN BILLS OF<br />LXCHANGE OR THE VARIOUS FORMS OF LEASING AND PROJECT<br />FINANCING, DEBT FUNDS WOULD BE OLD-FASHION. IED AND UNNECESSARILY<br />EXPENSIVE.</p>
<p>MERCHANT BANKS HAVE PLAYED A MAJOR ROLE IN FINANCIAL<br />INNOVATIONSj IN INTRODUCING NEW TECHNOLOGY, IN DEVELOPING<br />SEMI-GOVERNMENT UNDERWRITING SYNDICATES, IN DEVELOPMENT OF<br />THE UNOFFICIAL FOREIGN EXCHANGE HEDGE MARKET, AND IN THE<br />LAUNCHING OF INTEREST RATE EUTURES AS A MAJOR AREA OF<br />BUSINESS. 1 UNDERSTAND THAT A FUTURES MARKET IN COMMONWEALTH BONDS<br />IS SOON TO BE ESTABLISHED.<br />THESE DEVELOPMENTS ALLOW TRADERS TO OBTAIN INSURANCE AND MAY<br />SERVE TO STABILISE INTEREST RATES BY BROADENING THE FINANCIAL<br />MARKET, IN ADDITION TO PROVIDING AN OUTLET FOR RISK TAKERS,<br />THE EXTRA COMPETITION HAS SERVED TO REDUCE TRANSACTION COSTS<br />AND LOWER THE OVERALL COSTS OF FUNDS, IN ADDITION TO<br />BROADENING THE RANGE OF BORROWING AND LENDING INSTRUMENTS<br />SO THAT CUSTOMERS ARE BETTER SERVED.<br />ALL THESE DEVELOPMENTS ARE DEPENDENT IN PART 01N THE DYNAMISM<br />OF MERCHANT BANKS WHO HAVE TAKEN COMPETITION TO THE OTHER<br />INSTITUTIONS, AND HAVE OFTEN BEATEN FSTABI ISHED FINANCIAL<br />INTERMEDIARIES ON THE LATTER'S OWN GROUND.<br />THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM CANNOT STAND STILL.</p>
<p>WE NEED FLEXIBILITY, ADAPTABILITY AND CONTINUED INVIGORATING<br />COMPETITION. THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM HAS TO EVOLVE AND KEEP PACE WITH THE<br />WORLD IF AUSTRALIA IS TO BE-COMPETITIVE.<br />WE LOOK FORWARD TO THE ORGANISATIONS REPRESENTED HERE TONIGHT<br />HELPING TO KEEP AUSTRALIA UP WITH THE FIELD.<br />WE SEE THIS AS BEING NECESSARY TO THE IMPROVEMENT OF<br />AUSTRALIA'S LONG-TERM GROWTH PERFORMANCE.<br />OVER THE PAST SIX MONTHS THE LABOR GOVERNMENT'S GREATEST<br />EFFORTS HAVE BEEN DIRECTED AT THE MACRO-ECONOMIC CRISIS<br />WHICH WE INHERITED: REVERSING THE HEADLONG DECLINE IN<br />PRODUCTION AND ESPECIALLY EMPLOYMENT THAT HAD CHARACTERISED<br />THE EIGHTEEN MONTHS BEFORE WE TOOK OFFICE; PUTTING INFLATION<br />ON A DOWNWARD PATH; AND ESTABLISHING THE BASIS FOR STRONG<br />RECOVERY WITHOUT REKINDLING INFLATION OVER THE IMMEDIATE FUTURE.<br />WHILE IT WILL BE MANY YEARS BEFORE WE HAVE MADE ACCEPTABLY<br />LARGE INROADS INTO THE POVERTY AND UNEMPLOYMENT THAT HAVE<br />ACCUMULATED IN AUSTRALIA OVER THE PAST NINE YEARS, THERE ARE<br />NOW CLEAR SIGNS THAT WE ARE MOVING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION',</p>
<p>T1HE AUSTRALIAN ECONOM-Y IS RESPONDING TO OUR EXPANSIONARY<br />FISCAL POLICIES, OUR MONETARY POLICIES DESIGINED TO ACCOMIMO1DATL<br />STRONG GROWTH WITHOUT INF LATION, AND THE PRICES AND INCOMES<br />ACCORD., AS WELL AS TO MORE FAVOURABLE SEASONAL AN-D INTERNATION" AL<br />CONDITIONS. ON TOP OF CLEARLY IMPROVED PERFORMAN~ CE ON PRODUCTION AIND EMPLOYMENFt<br />YESTERDAY WE HAD CONFIRMATION OF THE DOWNWARD TREND IN<br />CONSUMER PRICES.<br />IAM CONFIDENT THAT WE HAVE ESTABLISHED A BASIS FOP, SUBSTANTFIAL<br />GROWTH IN PROD) UCTION AND EMPLOYMENT OVER THE YEAR OR TW', O AHEAD.,<br />TOGETHER WITH THE ACHIEVEMENT OF RATES OF INFLATION THAT<br />ARE CLOSER TO THE EXPERIENCE OF THE 1Y50S AND 1960S THAN TO<br />THAT OF THE LAST DECADES<br />THE CONTINUATION OF STRONG NON-INFLATIONARY GROWTH WILL<br />REQUIRE CONTINUED CARE IN MACRO-ECONOMIC MAINAGEMENT IN<br />FISCAL AND MONETrARY POLICY, AND Itl THE RANGE OF POLICIES<br />EMBOD) IED IN THE PRICES AN4D INCOMES ACCORD.<br />BUT AS OUR POLICIES TO ADDRESS THE IMMEDIATE CRISIS TAKE<br />HOLD, INCRE-ASINGLY OUR MAIN ATTENTION WILL BE FOCUSSED ON<br />IMPROVING THE EFFECTIVENESS WITH, wHiCH AUSTRALIAN RESOURCES<br />ARE USED,<br />IN THIS CONTEXT, WE ARE CURRENTLY REVIEWING POLICY IN TWO " REA$<br />OF SPECIAL INTEREST TO YOUR MEMB~ ERS THE MARTIN COMMITTEE<br />RLPORT AND THE GOVERNMlENT ' S REVIEW OF THE FOREIGN I NVESi lEN F<br />GUIDELINES.</p>
<p>ON FOREIGN INVESTMENT, YOU WOULD ALL BE AWARE THAT BOTH<br />THE TREASURER AND I HAVE SIGNALLED THAT WE DO NOT HAVE IN<br />,, MIND MAJOR CHANGES IN POLICY A POLICY THAT HAS ENJOYED<br />BIPARTISAN SUPPORT SINCE THE BASIC LINES WERE SET IN THE<br />LAST YEAR OF THE WHITLAM LABOR GOVERNMENT,<br />THE GOVERNMENT IS LOOKING FORWARD TO THE MARTIN COMMITTEE'S<br />REPORT TO GUIDE THE REFORM OF THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM,<br />AGAINST THIS BACKGROUND THERE ARE TWO VITAL TOPICS I SHOULD<br />NOW WANT TO ADDRESS: NAMELY EFFICIENCY IN THE FINANCIAL<br />SYSTEM AND THE BASES OF OUR MONETARY AND EXCHANGE RATE<br />POLICIES IN THIS FIRST YEAR OF ECONOMIC RECOVERY.<br />OBVIOUSLY THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM HAS TO WORK WITHIN A REGULATORY<br />FRAMEWORK PROVIDED BY GOVERNMENTS. HAVING REGARD TO THEIR<br />WIDER SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITIES,<br />No WHERE; DOES THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM PLAY A MORE IMPORTANT<br />ROLE THAN IN AUSTRALIA, WITH OUR HIGH RATES OF SAVINGS ( AND<br />PARTICULARLY HOUSEHOLD SAVINGS) AND INVESTMENT.<br />AS A YOUNG WELL-ENDOWED COUNTRY WE HAVE A DISPROPORTIONATE<br />SHARE OF WORLD INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES.<br />IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS, GROSS FIXED INVESTIlENT AS A PERCENTAGE<br />OF NATIONAL INCOME HAS AVERAGE 23.7 PER CENT IN AUSTRALIA,<br />WELL ABOVE MOST OTHER DEVELOPED COUNTRIES,</p>
<p>DOMESTICALLY GENERATED SAVINGS HAVE ALSO BEEN HIGH, AT<br />ABOUT 2U PER CENT OF NATIONAL INCOME IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS,<br />BUT THEY HAVE BEEN INSUFFICIENT TO FINANCE ALL THE<br />INVESTMENT UNDERTAKEN.<br />IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS, NET BORROWING FROM OVERSEAS HAS<br />AVERAGED 3.3 PER CENT OF NATIONAL INCOME, AND IT IS IN<br />FACILITATING THESE BORROWINGS THAT THE MERCHANT BANKS<br />AND OTHER FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARIES HAVE MADE ONE OF THEIR<br />MAIN CONTRIBUTIONS TO DEVELOPMENT.<br />BUT, WHILE IMPORTED CAPITAL HAS CERTAINLY ALLOWED US TO<br />IMPROVE OUR PRODUCTIVE POTENTIAL, WE CANNOT SIMPLY BORROW<br />FROM OVERSEAS WITHOUT REGARD FOR OUR EXPORT EARNINGS.<br />WE NEED TO INVEST WISELY, AND, AS IMPORTANTLY, FUNDS MUST<br />BE GATHERED AS EFFICIENTLY AS POSSIBLE, AND AT LEAST COST<br />TO SAVERS, TO MEET INVESTMENT NEEDS,<br />THAT IN ITSELF CAN INDUCE HIGHER DOMESTIC SAVINGS AND MAKE<br />THEM GO FURTHER,<br />WE NEED EFFICIENT FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARIES TO BRING TOGETHER THE<br />GREAT RANGE OF LENDERS AND BORROWERS, BIG AND SMALL, DOMESTIC<br />AND FOREIGN, SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM.<br />SAVINGS HAVE TO BE MARSHALLED., TRANSFORMED IN MATURITY.,<br />PACKAGED AND ALLOCATED TO THEIR MOST PRODUCTIVE USES.</p>
<p>THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM ALSO HAS TO PROVIDE AN OUTLET FOR<br />SECURE SAVINGS FOR RETIREMENT THROUGH SUPERANNUATION,<br />LIFE INSURANCE AND OTHER FORMS OF SAVINGS,<br />IMPORTANTLY THE FINANCIAL SECTOR ALSO. PLAYS A KEY ROLE AS<br />A MAJOR AND " OST IMMEDIATE LINK BETWEEN AUSTRALIA AND THE<br />WORLD ECONOMY,<br />WITH THESE CONSIDERATONS IN MIND, I HAVE BEEN PLEASED RECENTLY<br />TO RECEIVE TWO DETAILED REPRESENTATIONS FROM THIS<br />ASSOCIATION ON THE DEREGULATION OF THE AUSTRALIAN FINANCIAL<br />SYSTEM.<br />ONE OF THESE WAS THE ASSOCIATION'S SUBMISSION TO THE MARTIN<br />COMMITTEE ON THE REGULATION AND CONTROL OF FINANCIAL<br />CORPORATIONS REGISTERED UNDER THE FINANCIAL CORPORATIONS ACT,<br />THE MAIN THRUST OF THIS IS APROPOSAL THAT THE GOVERNMENT<br />SHOULD NOT IMPLEMENT PART IV OF THE ACT, BUT RATHER SHOULD<br />CONTINUE TO USE MORAL SUASION TO ACHIEVE ITS OBJECTIVES IN<br />FINANCIAL MARKETS,<br />THE SECOND SUBMISSION ARGUES FOR REFORM OF THE EXISTING<br />FOREIGN EXCHANGE ARRANGEMENTS.<br />IT OUTLINES RECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN OTHER COUNTRIES WITH MANAGED<br />EXCHANGE RATES AND RECOMMENDS THE LICENSING OF ADDITIONAL<br />FOREIGN EXCHANGE DEALERS.</p>
<p>OBVIOUSLY 1 AM IN NO POSITION TO COMMENT IN DETAIL ON THE<br />FIRST OF THESE SUBMISSIONS, PENDING OUR RECEIPT AND<br />CONSIDERATION OF THE MARTIN COMMITIEE REPORT.<br />BUT YOU CAN FIND GUIDANCE TO OUR.. APPROACH IN iY REPEATED<br />STATEMENTS THAT 1. SEE NO VIRTUE IN REGULATION OF ECONOMIC<br />ACTIVITY FOR ITS OWN SAKE.<br />THE LABOR GOVERNMENT BELIEVES THAT WHERE MARKETS ARE<br />WORKING EFFICIENTLY THEY SHOULD BE LEFT TO DO THEIR JOB<br />UNLESS THERE ARE CLEAR EQUITY REASONS FOR GOVERNMENT INTERVENTION1!<br />YOUR SECOND SUBMISSION TAKES US INTO THE GENERAL AREA OF<br />MONETARY POLICY AND EXCHANGE RATE MANAGEMENT.<br />I AM SURE THAT THIS GATHERING IS PARTICULARLY INTERESTED IN<br />AND WELL INFORMED ON MONETARY POLICY,<br />THE GOVERNMENT SEES ITS MONETARY POLICY AS A CRUCIAL ELEMENT<br />IN ITS OVERALL POLICY MIX TO SET THE ECONOMY ON THE PATH TO<br />RECOVERY, AND THEN TO FACILITATE STRONG NON-INFLATIONARY<br />GROWTH OVER A LONG PERIOD.<br />MONETARY POLICY HAS TO BE VIEWED AGAINST THE BACKGROUND<br />PARTICULARLY OF THE EXPANSIONARY FISCAL POLICY WE HAVE<br />ADOPTED AND THE PRICES AND INCOMES ACCORD,</p>
<p>WE MADE IT CLEAR AT THE TIME OF THE SUMMIIT, AND THE<br />TREASURER EMPHASISED IN THE BUDGET, THAT WE WOULD BE<br />SETTING A MONETARY PROJECTION CONSISIENT WITH STRONG GROWTH,<br />BUT NOT SUCH AS WOULD FUEL INFLATION.<br />IN THE BUDGET, WE MADE ALLOWANCE FOR THE FACT THAT THE<br />VELOCITY OF CIRCULATION OF MONEY COULD BE EXPECTED TO REBOUND<br />IN 1983-84 AS THE ECONOMY PICKED UP AND NON-BANKS PLAYED<br />A GREATER ROLE IN FINANCING ACTIVITY,<br />ON THIS BASIS WE ADOPTED A MONETARY PROJECTION FOR THE<br />12 MONTHS TO THE JUNE QUARTER BASED ON 13 GROdTlH IN THE<br />RANGE 9 TO 11 PER CENT.<br />BUT LET ME REPEAT THE QUALIFICATIONS THE TREASURER MADE IN<br />HIS BUDGET SPEECH:<br />" FOR THE . REASONS I HAVE MENTIONED, HOWEVER, POLICY CANNOT<br />FOCUS-SOLELY ON 113 AND IN THE YEAR AHEAD WE SHALL BE<br />MONITORING THE PROGRESS OF A RAtNGE OF FINANCIAL<br />AGGREGATES WITH COVERAGE BOTH NARROWER AND BROADER THAN<br />" THE PROJECTION IS A CONDITIONAL ONE,<br />" THERE WILL BE A REVIEW OF THE PROJECTION DURING THE YEAR<br />IN THE LIGHT OF TRENDS IN ACTIVITY AND OTHER RELEVANT<br />DEVELOPMENTS,<br />" POLICY WILL AIM AT GRADUALLY MOVING THE EXCESSIVE PRESENT<br />GROWTH IN M5 TO WITHIN THE RECO/ MMENDED RANGE."</p>
<p>11,<br />WE ARE WATCHING CAREFULLY DEVELOPMENTS IN THIS AREA OF<br />POLICY, WE ARE AWARE OF THE DISPARITIES BETWEEN M3 AND OTHER<br />MONETARY AGGREGATES.<br />IN THIS REGARD 1 NOTE THAT SAVINGS BANK DEPOSITS HAVE BEEN<br />RISING STRONGLY AND HAVE CONTRIBUTED MATERIALLY TO THE PICK<br />UP IN HOUSING ACTIVITY,<br />WE WELCOME THIS.<br />WE NOTE, HOWEVER, THAT THIS IS CONTRIBUTING TO THE DISPARITIES<br />IN MOVEMENTS IN THE MONETARY AGGREGATES.<br />WE ARE ALSO CONSCIOUS OF THE EFFECTS OF CHANGING SEASONALITY,<br />THIS IS ALWAYS A PROBLEM IN THE AUSTRALIAN MONETARY<br />ENVIRONMENT, I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT WE ARE VERY CONSICOUS OF WHAT IS<br />HAPPENING; THAT WE WILL BE CARRYING OUT THE REVIEW PROMISED<br />BY THE TREASURER; AND THAT WE WILL BE TAKING PARTICULAR<br />CARE AS SEASONAL TIGHTENING OCCURS IN 1964 TO ENSURE THAT<br />THERE IS ADEQUATE FINANCE AVAILABLE FOR THE RECOVERY TO<br />PROCEED.</p>
<p>-12-<br />WE ARE ALL VERY CONSCIOUS OF THE TREND IN INTEREST RATES,<br />WHICH HAPPILY HAS BEEN GENERALLY DOWNWARDS THIS YEAR.<br />LOWER INFLATION AND LOWER INTEREST RATES WOULD MATERIALLY<br />HELP THE RECOVERY IN THE AUSTRALIAN ECONOMY.<br />WE LOOK TO THE PRICES AND INCOMES ACCORD AND SUPPORTIVE<br />POLICIES TO PRODUCE A SUSTAINED REDUCTION IN INFLATION AND<br />INTEREST RATES.<br />THIS WOULD GREATLY HELP OUR COMPETITIVENESS AND ENCOURAGE<br />INVESTMENT IN AUSTRALIA,<br />IT IS IMPORTANT THAT THE GAINS IN THIS AREA SHOULD BE<br />SUSTAINABLE IN THE FUTURE,<br />THAT IS THE OBJECTIVE OF OUR POLICIES ECONOMIC RECOVERY<br />I<br />ACCOMPANIED BY FALLING INFLATION<br />WE ARE PLEASED AT THE STRENGTH OF THE A. C, TU.' S AND MAJOR<br />UNIONS' ACCEPTANCE OF THE OBLIGATIONS OF THE PRICES AND<br />INCOMES ACCORD AND THE WAGE-SETTING PRINCIPLES RECENTLY<br />DEFINED BY THE ARBITRATION COMMISSION.<br />I COME NOW TO THE MANAGEMENT OF THE EXCHANGE RATE.</p>
<p>-13-<br />FOR OBVIOUS REASONS, THIS IS NOT A SUBJECT ON t', HICH PRimE<br />IINISTERS USUALLY HAVE A LOT TO SAY,<br />BUT TONIGHT I AM ABLE TO MAKE A F'EW REMARKS,<br />THERE HAS BEEN RECENT SPECULATION THAT THE GOVERN1, ENT,<br />HELL-BENT ON REDUCING GROWTH IN M3 AT ANY COST., WAS<br />ALLOWING THE EXCHANGE RATE TO BE DELIBERATELY OVER-VALUED<br />AS AN INSTRUMENT OF ANTI-INFLATIONARY POLICY,<br />I HAVE RESPONDED BY POINTING OUT THAT, FIRST, WHEN REGARD<br />IS PAID TO THE TECHNICAL FACTORS SET OUT ABOVE, IT IS 1NOT<br />CLEAR THAT WE NEED IARKEDLY TO TIGHTEN MONETARY POLICY;<br />AND SECONDLY, THAT OUR OBJECTIVE OF FIGHTING INFLATION AND<br />UNEMPLOYMENT AT THE SAME TIME REQUIRES US TO AVOID PUSHING<br />THE AUSTRALIAN DOLLAR TO AN ARTIFICIALLY HIGH LEVEL.<br />NONE OF THIS IS TO DENY THAT DEVELOPMENTS WHICH AFFECT<br />PERCEPTIONS OF THE UNDERLYING VALUE OF THE DOLLAR WILL<br />INFLUENCE THE RATE.<br />RATHER, WE ARE COMMITTED TO AVOIDING DELIBERATELY HOLDING THE<br />DOLLAR AT A LEVEL ABOVE WHAT MIGHT BE CONSIDERED A MARKET<br />VALUATI ON,<br />IN RECENT t, 1ONTHS., THERE HAVE BEEN SIGNS OF SPECULATION<br />AGAINST THE EXCHANGE RATE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM ITSELF,<br />INDEPENDENTLY OF JUDGEMENTS ABOUIT THE UNDERLYING VALUE OF<br />THE AUSTRALIAN DOLLAR,</p>
<p>-14-<br />ACCORDINGLY, I AM ABLE NOW TO ANNOUNCE, SIMULTANEOUSLY<br />WITH A STATEMENT BY THE TREASURER, THAT THE GOVERNMIENT<br />HAS AUTHORISED THE RESERVE BANK TO IMPLEMENT CHANGES IN<br />THE MANNER IN WHICH THE EXCHANGE RATE IS DETERMINED.<br />THE GENERAL DRIFT OF THE CHANGES IS TO ALLOW THE PRIVATE<br />. SECTOR MORE SCOPE,, AND MORE RESPONSIBILITY., IN THE FOREICGN<br />EXCHANGE AREA, IN RESPECT OF BOTH SPOT AND FORWARD<br />TRANSACTIONS. ON THE SPOT TRANSACTIONS SIDE, THE RESERVE BANK IN FUTURE<br />WILL NOT FIX UNTIL THE END OF THE DAY THE $ A/$ US MID-RATE<br />ON THE BASIS OF WHICH IT WILL SETTLE NET FOREIGN EXCHANGE<br />POSITIONS INCURRED BY THE BANKS DURING THE COURSE OF<br />THEIR DEALINGS THROUGHOUT THE DAY,<br />THE CHJEF PURPOSE OF THIS CHANGE IS TO DISCOURAGE<br />SPECULATIVE CAPITAL FLOWS DURI-NG THE COURSE OF THE DAY.<br />ON THE FORWARD TRANSACTIONS SIDE, THE RESERVE BANK WILL<br />WITHDRAW FROM THE UNDERWRITING OF THE FORWARD FOREIGN<br />EXCHANGE MARKETS.<br />As A CONSEQUENCE., THE BANKS WILL BE PERMITTED GREATER<br />FREEDOM TO HOLD BALANCES ABROAD AND TO BORROW FOR THE<br />PURPOSE OF MATCHING FORWARD TRANSACTIONS.<br />ALL THIS WILL ASSIST THE DEVELOPM-ENT OF A MORE EFFICIENT<br />AND SELF-SUSTAINING FORWARD FOREIGN EXCHANGE tMARKET,</p>
<p>THESE CHANGES, THOUGH LARGELY TECHNICAL SHOULD ASSISrll IN<br />MODERATiNG THE VOLATILITY OF DAY-TO-~ DAY FL. OWS OF FU14DS<br />ACROSS THE FOREIGN EXCHANGES,<br />THIS VOLATAlLITY. HAS, OF CQURS" E, CONIPLICATE1) THE TASK OF<br />MANAGING THE GR~ OWTH OF THE MONETARY AGGREGATES IN<br />AUSTRALIA IN LINE WITH TlHEL OBjECTIVES ANNOUNCED IN THE<br />TREASURE. R'S BUDGET SPEECH,<br />WE BELI EVE THESE CHANGES IN THE MANAGMENT OF THE FOREIGN<br />EXCHANGE MARKETS WI LL MAKE A HELPFUL CONTRIB~ UTION TO<br />MONETARY MANAGEMENT.<br />HOWEVER, SUCH MODIFICATIONS AND ADAPTATIONSj HELPFUL AS THEY<br />ARE, SHOULD NOT BLIND US TO THE FACT THAT, IN -rHE END,,<br />THE VALUE OF THE AUSTRALI AN DOLLAR, AND THE FLOWdS OF FUNDS<br />ACROSS,. THE EXCHANGES, WI4LL NOT BE DETERMINED BY THE<br />PARTICULAR SYSTEMS BEING PURSUED,<br />SYSTEMS WILtL HELP, BUT THEY WILL INOT DETERMINE THE OUTCOME,<br />RATHER, AS ALWAYS, THE FINAL DETERMINING FACTOR WILL BE<br />THE RELATIVE PERFORMANCE* OF THE AUSTRALIAN ECONOMjY.<br />SO FAR AS THE GOVERNMENT IS CON1CERNED, THIS BRINGS US BACK<br />TO THE FUNDAMENTALS OF FISCAL POLICY, MONETARY POLI CY, V.: AGCS<br />POLICY AND P0O. ICI ES AFFEECTI NG THE LONG-TERM GROWTH I N<br />PRODUCTIVITY.</p>
<p>-16-<br />THE CHANGES I HAVE ANNOUINCED TONIGHT, I BELIEVE, ARE<br />SBROADLY IN THE DIRECTION FAVOURED BY YOUR ASSOCIATION,<br />THERE MAY BE SOME CONCERN THAT THE DECISION TO DEFER<br />SETTING THE $ A/$ US MID-RATE UNTIL THE CLOSE OF TRADING<br />WILL CREATE UNCERTAINTY.<br />I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT ANY CONCERN IS WARRANTED,<br />THE " INDICATIVE" $ A/$ US tMID-RATE THAT WILL BE RELEASED WITH<br />THE TWl AT 9,30 A, M, EACH ; ORNING AND RATES ESTABLISHED IN<br />SUBSEQUENT TRADING WILL PROVIDE A GUIDE TO THE SETTING OF<br />THE SA/$ US MID-RATE AT THE END OF THE DAY,<br />THUS, MARKET PARTICIPANTS WILL HAVE A GOOD DEAL OF<br />INFORMATION AVAILABLE TO THEM.<br />SMALL TRADERS WILL STILL BE ABLE TO GET DIRECT PRICES FROM<br />THEIR BANKS FOR TRAVEL AND THE LIKE,<br />TO THE EXTENT THAT THE END-DAY SETTING REDUCES THE<br />OPPORTUNITIES FOR SPECULATION<br />ON MOVEMENTS IN THE $ US IN ASIAN MARKETS OVER THE COURSE<br />OF THE DAY AND SO MAKE PROFITS AT THE EXPENSE OF THE<br />RESERVE BANK WELL AND GOOD,</p>
<p>THE VOLATILE CAPITAL MOVEMENTS THAT SUCH SPECULATION<br />HAS LED TO ARE THE SORTS OF UNPRODUCTIVE AND UNHELPFUL<br />MOVEMENTS THAT WE WISH TO DISCOURAGE.<br />THIS AUDIEN. CE MIGHT BE ESPECIALLY CONCERNED THAT THE<br />DECISION OF THE RESERVE BANiK TO WITHDRAW FROM THE OFFICIAL<br />FORARDMARKET WILL ADVANTAGE THE TRADING BANKS AT THE<br />EXPENSE OF HEDGE MARKET ACTIVITIES IN WHICH THE MFRCHANT<br />BANKS ARE ACTIVE.<br />YOU SHOULD NOTE, HOWEVER, THAT THE BANKS' FORWARD MARKET<br />AS DIST11NCT FROM THE BANKS'I HEDGE MARKET ACTIVITIES WILL<br />STILL BE LIMITED TO'TRADE TRANSACTIONS,<br />CAPITAL TRANSACTIONS WILL REMAIN THE PROVINCE OF THlE HEDGE<br />MARKET.<br />THUS, A GOOD DEAL OF THE BUSINESS OF THE UNOFFICIAL HEDGE<br />MARKET WILL BE UNAFFECTED.<br />CONSISTENTL. Y WITH YOUR SUBMISSION TO ME, YOU WILL HOLD THE<br />VIEW THAT MERCHANT BANKS SHOULD BE AFFORDED LICEN4CES TO<br />DEAL IN FOREIGN EXCHANGE,<br />WE HAVE NOT FORGOTTEN THAT MERCHANT BANJKS FEEL. STRONGLY<br />ABOUT THIS,</p>
<p>I NOTE, HO'WEVER; THAT THE CAMPBELL COMMITTEE CAME TO A<br />DIFFERENT VIEW.<br />IT SUGGESTED THAT TO DO FOREIGN EXCHANGE BUSINESS A<br />BANKING LICENCE SHOULD BE REOUIREDJ. SO THIS PROPOSAL IS<br />MORE THAN A " TECHNICAL" ADJUSTMENT TO THE EXCHANGE RATE<br />MANAGEMENT SYSTEM.<br />THAT IS NOT THE END OF THE MATTER AS FAR AS WE ARE CONCERNED.<br />BUT WE THOUGHT IT INAPPROPRIATE FINALLY TO SETTLE THIS MATTER<br />AT THE PRESENT TIME.<br />THIS ISSUE IS TO SOME EXTENT RELATED TO THE GRANTING OF<br />BANKING LICENCES AND THE GOVERNMENT IS WAITING FOR THE<br />REPORT OF THE MARTIN COMMITTEE BEFORE IT MAKES ANY DECISIONS,<br />WE GREATLY WELCOME THE CONTRIBUTION THAT THE MECRCHANT BANKS<br />1<br />ARE MAKING TO AUSTRALIAN DEVELOPMENT<br />WE LOOK FORWARD TO YOU CONTINUING TO PLAY A KEY ROLE IN<br />IMPROVING THE EFFICIENCY OF OUR FINANCIAL SYSTEM.<br />I INVITE YOU TO REMAIN IN TOUCH WITH US OVER THE NEXT FEW<br />MONTHS, AS WE ADDRESS A RANGE OF ISSUES OF CRUCIAL IMIPORTANCE<br />TO YOUR INDUSTRY, AND TO THE LONG-TERM GROWTH PERFORMANCE<br />OF THE AUSTRALIAN ECONOMY,</p>
