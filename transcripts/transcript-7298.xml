PRIME MINISTER<br />
CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
SECOND JOINT MEETING OF THE AUSTRALIA INDIA<br />
BUSINESS COUNCIL AND THE INDO AUSTRALIA BUSINESS COUNCIL<br />
MELBOURNE 8 MARCH 1988<br />
It was particularly pleasing for me to see tpe Indian vessel<br />
Varuna, sailing on Sydney Harbor on 26 January as part of<br />
the magnificent international fleet of Tall Ships.<br />
Varuna's presence, celebrating as it did the national days<br />
of both Australia and India which we share on 26 January,<br />
symbolised the very friendly and close ties between our two<br />
countries. In talking of those ties I am not seeking to make a dreadful<br />
pun about the Test match played at Madras in 1986. You<br />
could hardly get any closer than that historic tie.<br />
As for our historic and political ties, Australia and India<br />
share a colonial past. We emerged from that past in<br />
different ways, with different constitutional arrangements.<br />
-But we emerged also with a shared and fundamental commitment<br />
to freedom and democracy and with shared membership of the<br />
Commonwealth. Last year, at the Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting<br />
in Vancouver, I had the pleasure of again meeting and<br />
working closely with my good friend the Indian Prime<br />
Minister Rajiv Gandhi.<br />
I believe our relationship at head of government level<br />
mirrors our nations, larger relationship of constructive<br />
cooperation. I place great personal value on such contact<br />
with Mr Gandhi including our work in the Commonwealth<br />
forum to help formulate an effective approach to combating<br />
the evil of apartheid.<br />
The Vancouver meeting was only the latest of a number of<br />
constructive meetings between me and Mr Gandhi.<br />
During Prime Minister Gandhi's visit to Australia in late<br />
1986 he and I agreed to establish formal business links<br />
between Australia and Ind-ia. We believed that there was<br />
enormous untapped potential for business and trade between<br />
Australia and India. 004902 </p>
<p>of course, the progress that has occurred since that time<br />
has clearly vindicated that view. Trade between our two<br />
countries has now passed the half a billion dollars per<br />
annum mark which I believe exceeds the best expectations of<br />
all of us.<br />
The credit for that growth undoubtedly lies with the<br />
business communities of Australia and India and in<br />
particular those who make up the Australia-India Bus-iness<br />
Council and the Indo-Australia Business Council.<br />
Let me pay particular thanks in this regard to Reg Nicolson<br />
for his kind words of introduction. The ANZ Bank, through<br />
its subsidiary Grindlays, is of course * very well represented<br />
in India, and its achievements there stand as a model'to all<br />
companies which wish to do business between Australia and<br />
India.<br />
The priorities that have been identified for the work of<br />
these Business Councils are: to increase exports ansd<br />
imports between the two countries; to establish joint<br />
ventures; to improve the transfer of technology bet~ en both<br />
countries; to establish joint manufacturing and trading<br />
arrangements; and to penetrate third countries and to<br />
develop mutual co-operation in human resource development.<br />
These are worthy goals and there is evidence that progress<br />
is being made towards achieving them.<br />
Endeavours of the substance and importance of the Pipawar<br />
Coal Project, the joint venture between BHP Petroleum and<br />
the Indian Oil and Natural Gas Commission, and the joint<br />
venture between CEL and the University of New South Wales to<br />
produce photovoltaic cells show both the economic<br />
complementarity between our two countries and the potential<br />
for trade between Australia and India.<br />
Despite the success of the last 18 months there is much<br />
still to be done both at the Government level and at the<br />
business level.<br />
For governments, for example, the completion of a double<br />
taxation agreement remains an important priority as does the<br />
important work being undertaken by Austrade to assist<br />
Australian business people entering the Indian market.<br />
At the business level, there are still many opportunities to<br />
be grasped and, at least on the Australian side, much to be<br />
learned about Indian markets and the Indian commercial<br />
sector. I am pleased to see that seven working parties,<br />
established at the first joint meeting, are discussing the<br />
opportunities for trade in a range of areas.<br />
On the broader scene Australia and India share many trading<br />
interests. we are both countries who wish to expand our<br />
economic base and skills and we are both countries looking<br />
to enhance our economic performance by increasing exports. 004903 </p>
<p>We are therefore both well placed to take advantage of the<br />
substantial opportunities each of us offers for doing<br />
business. That is, we in Australia not only look forward to<br />
doing greater business in * India, but look forward equally to<br />
a greater Indian trading presence in Australia.<br />
In this regard it is both encouraging and an honour, at only<br />
the second joint meeting of the Business Councils, to have<br />
present such eminent Indian business leaders. May I welcome<br />
you to Australia and hope that your time is not only<br />
enjoyable but profitably spent.<br />
Let me assure you that you will find Australia a congenial<br />
and productive environment for investment and you will find<br />
Australian businesses willing partners for projects directed<br />
at third markets.<br />
This second joint meeting of the Business Councils comes<br />
after a period of considerable growth in trade between India<br />
and Australia and is opening the way for much greater trade<br />
ye t.<br />
I take personal satisfaction from seeing the obvious success<br />
of the initiative that Prime Minister Gandhi and I launched<br />
in 1986.<br />
That event took place, as I said, during a visit by Mr<br />
Gandhi to Australia.<br />
Apart from visiting New Delhi for a Commonwealth Heads of<br />
Government Meeting in 1983, I. have not had the opportunity<br />
to repay the honour of that visit yet. I hope to rectify<br />
that before very much longer. The Minister for Foreign<br />
Affairs and Tride, Bill Hayden, is also giving consideration<br />
to visiting India during the course of this year.<br />
I wish you well in your endeavours and hope that in this<br />
joint meeting we will see the forming of new business<br />
ventures and the taking of further steps towards the trade<br />
and business relationship that we all believe can be<br />
achieved ' between our two countries. 004904 </p>
