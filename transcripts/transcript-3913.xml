Press Statement No. 569<br />
6 October 1975<br />
TRANSFER OF RESPONSIBILITY FOR ABORIGINAL AFFAIRS<br />
IN NEW SOUTH WALES<br />
The Prime Minister, the Hon. Whitlam, and the<br />
Premier of the Hon. T. L. Lewis, announced today that<br />
formal agreement had been reached for the transfer from the<br />
State to the Commonwealth of responsibility for certain<br />
aboriginal affairs in N. S. W. with effect from ist July 1975.<br />
Under the new arrangements, the Australian Government<br />
will assume increased responsibility for the development of<br />
the Aboriginal people of New South Wales, including responsibilities<br />
for the planning, co-ordination and financing of activities<br />
designed to promote their economic, social and cultural<br />
advancement. Except for a small nucleus of staff to handle State<br />
responsibilities under the arrangements, the staff employed in<br />
the N. S. W. Directorate of Aboriginal Affairs will transfer to<br />
the Australian Public Service.<br />
Under the arrangements, the N. S. W. Housing Commission<br />
will continue to administer special housing for aboriginals<br />
throughout the State while the N. S. W. Minister for Youth, Ethnic<br />
and Community Affairs, Mr S. G. Mauger, and the N. S. W. Aboriginal<br />
Lands Trust will be responsible for housing on reserves.<br />
The Prime Minister and the Premier said that there<br />
would continue to be close co-operation between their two<br />
Governments aimed at improving the welfare of the Aboriginal<br />
people of N. S. W. and the new agreement would help further this<br />
objective. CANBERRA. A. C. T.<br />
