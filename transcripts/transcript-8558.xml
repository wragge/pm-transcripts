E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
Thank you very much Peter ( Duncan), Julie, my Cabinet<br />
colleague Neal Blewett, distinguished parliamentary<br />
colleagues in Federal and State Parliament, distinguished<br />
members of local government, ladies and gentlemen, boys<br />
and girls, there are a few of them here too.<br />
Well it's lovely to be here and its nice to be here with<br />
Peter. It's always a measure of a colleague when you go<br />
to his or her electorate to see how much real and support<br />
they have and how much genuine affection with which they<br />
are held, and if tonight's 700-odd is any demonstration<br />
of that then Peter Duncan is held in pretty high regard.<br />
And that great humanity of him comes through, and that's<br />
why he has got so much support. I'm glad I've had his<br />
support as he is glad he's said to have supported me. I<br />
didn't win by many so I needed it. So thank you Peter,<br />
thank you for the faith, and I hope I won't let you down.<br />
When I was coming here tonight I said to my staff who<br />
will be there? They said the Left will be there, and I<br />
said I'm a bit of a ' Leftie' myself so I'll get on<br />
alright with them. I said all the Left Wing things we've<br />
done like capital gains taxes, fringe benefits taxes,<br />
occupational super, I've been in all those. And they<br />
said there's a few Poms there too, and I said I'll be OK<br />
with them too, It's only the ones in tabloids that I have<br />
a problem with. It's not the local ones, they know what<br />
I'm saying. And &amp; part from that, they said there are a<br />
good supporters of the Labor Party and other people in<br />
the community who are interested in public life and<br />
interested in a fair go. And I said, in that case we'll<br />
do well. </p>
<p>I am very pleased to be in this part of Adelaide and it's<br />
nice to be back in South Australia once more. Peter said<br />
I'll be coming to South Australia more, and it's true I<br />
will because Australia these days does have some<br />
disparity in prosperity between States, and that's why it<br />
is important to get around the States. South Australia<br />
has its share of troubles which are not exclusively of<br />
its own making, just the way in which the nation has<br />
changed. And it is important, I think, for all of us in<br />
national politics to come through you to understand about<br />
the place and to try to focus things the right way.<br />
I think the most important thing for us to know is that<br />
Australia and Australians have a great opportunity in the<br />
world. That's the most important thing to know. Not<br />
many people, in fact we are unique in the sense that we<br />
have a continent to ourselves. No other nation on earth<br />
has a continent to themselves. And not just any<br />
continent, but the oldest continent. The oldest<br />
continent where we came to a place with the oldest<br />
civilisation. The High Court, in a very land mark<br />
decision a week or two ago, made that clear when they<br />
rebuked the doctrine of Terra Nullius. That this was an<br />
unclaimed place when the British arrived.<br />
And we know that we are in a subtle country, an old<br />
country, where the residences of the country changed the<br />
way we all are and make us unique. Even though we may<br />
have European antecedents, we are a unique country<br />
because of the way in which Australia is unique. And<br />
most of us in the Labor Party know that we'll never come<br />
to terms fully with this country until we come to terms<br />
with the original Australians, the Aboriginals.<br />
One of my staff was in a group that climbed the Himalayas<br />
and somebody said to him ' you don't have mountains like<br />
this in Australia'. He said, ' no, ours are fifty times<br />
older than this and they've since worn down'. And that's<br />
a fact this is an old place and the subtleties of the<br />
landscape and the nature of the place have changed us and<br />
mad us unique, uniquely Australian. We're not British,<br />
we're not Dutch, we're not Italian, we're not Lebanese,<br />
we're not Vietnamese, we're not Chines, we are<br />
Australians. And it is time for us to declare that we are Australians,<br />
to make that declaration. It's psychologically important<br />
to us the more often we make it. And it's economically<br />
important.<br />
Our colleagues in the Coalition parties believe that talk<br />
about our nationalism, our Australianess, is a<br />
distraction, thfey say, from the economic facts and<br />
economic life. But there are enough facts around to know<br />
that there can be no distraction from the recession and<br />
unemployment and other things. </p>
<p>It is important to know, and important to our economics,<br />
to * our future, to our trading future, to assert ourselves<br />
economically as we assert ourselves psychologically and<br />
nationally. It's an important link to make.<br />
The great national spirit of one hundred years ago in<br />
another recession, in 1890, put the Australian Labor<br />
Party together and drove the forces of our Federation.<br />
And that nationalism, that high-spiritedness of<br />
Australia, ran until it was snuf fed out in the first<br />
World war. And in that great radical act, where so many<br />
young Australians went and fought, and 60 000 in 4<br />
million died, that radical act was then by our<br />
conservative opponents wrapped in the flag and turned<br />
into a conservative thing. And it has remained a<br />
conservative thing, and the great nationhood and<br />
nationalism of the period died with it.<br />
Then, of course we had the ' 20s under the conservatives,<br />
the 130s in the recession, the ' 40s largely in the War,<br />
the Rip Van Wrinkle years of Menzies until the end of the<br />
160s, and then the do-nothing years of Fraser, and then<br />
finally a chance under Labor to get back to those goals<br />
and threads. To get back to the sense of Australia being<br />
a nation and claiming the place as being a unique place,<br />
a derivative of no other place, and a place where we can<br />
make our way in the world and hold our head up in the<br />
world. Now it is an accident of history that a largely European<br />
country has been developed in the bottom of Asia. That's<br />
now changing as we see people from the Middle East, and<br />
from the Asia-Pacific coming to our shores and being part<br />
of our community. But the fact is the we are now in a<br />
unique position to make Australia part of the Asia-<br />
Pacific, part of the fastest growing region of the world,<br />
and truly define our place in the neighbourhood.<br />
Because at least now we are saying to people in Asia we<br />
want to be here, we want to be part of you, we want to<br />
part of our local community. We don't want to fly over<br />
you to Los Angeles, or fly over to you in London, or pay<br />
lip service to the region, we want to be part of it. And<br />
they are basically welcoming us with open arms.<br />
So this is our great chance to find our place in the<br />
region, in the neighbourhood, to be part of it, to be<br />
relevant, and to share in the wealth and growth of this<br />
very prosperous area. That more than anything else is<br />
what will change the face of Australia, change the race<br />
of South Australia, and change the face of Adelaide.<br />
That single fact. </p>
<p>Now I know, and you all know, that the most important<br />
thing for us now is to get back to recovery. Because the<br />
Labor Party has never believed that unemployment is a<br />
residual that drops out of the policies. This is not the<br />
British conservative government, it's not the US<br />
Republicans, it's certainly not the Liberal Party of<br />
Australia. We don't believe the unemployed are the<br />
people at the end of the queue, the shock absorbers who<br />
take the shock out of the system to protect the economic<br />
viability of everybody else.<br />
And we know that this kind of society cannot tick over<br />
with unemployment rates of 10 per cent, or 10 per cent<br />
plus, or higher in some places. And so we want to get<br />
back to remaking Australia so we can have product growth<br />
and better rates of employment.<br />
But that can only happen by looking forward. It won't<br />
happen by looking backwards, as John Howard would have us<br />
do looking back to the dead-end Jobs, looking back to<br />
the 1950s where he thought things were fine. well they<br />
might hove been, but they won't provide the increments to<br />
growth and wealth that we have today.<br />
The things that are going to put us up the international<br />
scale are technological qhange and education.-And it is<br />
to that withwh ich thisa Government has committed itself<br />
to open Australia up, to make it internationally<br />
competAiive find Australia doing the interesting, novel<br />
things, which add value to products and let us find<br />
places and niches around the world, which give us that<br />
external orientation that we never had. That is, selling<br />
the most valuable resource of all the creativity of our<br />
people. And not the resources which Malcolm Fraser had<br />
ready for us in the mineral boom of the late 1970s,<br />
because that was just another mound of minerals that<br />
somebody found. Or, not another paddock full of wheat,<br />
or even wool, as important as those things are, but the<br />
most important resource of all our creativity and, of<br />
course, our children.<br />
In 1983, three children in ten completed secondary<br />
school. Seven in ten were left untrained. That's how<br />
much regard the Liberal and National Parties had for<br />
Australia's youth. They were happy to see seven in ten<br />
spill out of school on the labour market untrained. That<br />
retention rate today is not eight in ten eight in ten<br />
children now complete secondary school. And between the<br />
middle 1980s and now this Government added 122 000 places<br />
to universities, we've created the equivalent of twelve<br />
new universities, or added 50 per cent extra places to<br />
tertiary education. So that as those kids stay on in<br />
school, 35-40 per cent of them go onto tertiary<br />
education. </p>
<p>And now as a result of our One Nation statement, we are<br />
working on building up the-sy-stenM-6that sits below that<br />
technical and further education, or TAFE. So that the<br />
six to seven out of ten who come out of secondary school<br />
and don't go to university are not cascading into<br />
shopping mall plazas, railway stations, or somewhere, but<br />
they are cascading into training and education. So if we<br />
want to move Australia up the international division of<br />
labour, we move it up with education, creativity, and<br />
skills. And that's the sort of society we're trying to build.<br />
One that has a f ocus on research and development, product<br />
innovation, staffed by a clever workforce with creativity<br />
and ideas. Selling those ideas around the world which<br />
will make Australia a better place. And not staying in<br />
the industrial museum, the industrial archaeology, which<br />
the Liberal and National Parties left us in the late ' 709<br />
and the early 1980s.<br />
and the opposition's policy is basically to let the<br />
unemployed carry the weight of the recession and the<br />
recovery so that those who are in comfortable positions<br />
can carry on.<br />
I said today in another place, that if we take the view<br />
that the Federal Director of the Liberal Party<br />
articulated this morning on television, supporting his<br />
leader John Hewson, that people on unemployment benefits<br />
should go off them after 9 months and find accommodation<br />
in the St Vincent de Paul Society, or the Smith Family,<br />
or any other similar organisation the voluntary<br />
agencies which are already stretched to capacity the<br />
notion that somebody with a spouse and children, or a<br />
single person, should find themselves after 9 months cut<br />
of f from support by the government, stigmnatise the<br />
unemployed, and basically told they're on their own, they<br />
can go down to the soup kitchen, or they can go down to<br />
some other voluntary agency to get some basic modicum of<br />
assistance, or if they don't have accommodation to huddle<br />
under a carton, as you the people huddling all around the<br />
United States looking for warmth in the winter, we'll<br />
have a Los Angeles on our hands in this country at some<br />
stage. That it, the social strife which has racked the<br />
United States is basically generated by poverty.<br />
And in the Labor Party, we won't sign up to those sort of<br />
policies. We're not going to tip the unemployed of f<br />
unemployment benefits after 9 months. We're not going to<br />
be running heartless policies like that. We're not going<br />
to let the unfortunate carry the stigma and shock of<br />
economic policies and economic adjustment. Yet they are<br />
the policies of the coalition. </p>
<p>And then on top of that they want to introduce a 15 per<br />
cent consumption tax, which is a very large level of tax,<br />
when one considers that the average rate of income tax in<br />
this country is just over 23 per cent, is an enormous<br />
addition to the burden of taxation in Australia. And as<br />
the Governor of the Central Bank said during the week, it<br />
will add 6 to 7 percentage points to inflation. It will<br />
take our inflation rate to the record low levels of 1 1/ 2<br />
per cent where we have it at the moment, to around 7 or 8<br />
or maybe 9 per cent once more. And with it will go<br />
interest rates as well, and guess who pays the piper<br />
the low and middle paid people who will see a transfer of<br />
wealth from them to the higher paid.<br />
These are the policies of unfairness which our colleagues<br />
in the coalition are offering Australia. That is, if<br />
you're not basically well-off you are a bludger, if<br />
you're unemployed it's your fault, if you go down looking<br />
f or the job search allowance or unemployment benefits<br />
then you are only sponging on the system, that you are<br />
basically to be swatted off the system after 9 months.<br />
On medicine, Dr Howson stood up a couple of weeks ago at<br />
the AMA and said we'll let the AM set the common fee,<br />
not the government, the doctors. Hie's opposed to all of<br />
the unions except the doctors union, where he'll let the<br />
AMA set the fees for medical consultations.<br />
Then he'll cut Medicare to pieces and say you can<br />
privately insure yourself. And you'll go and privately<br />
insure yourself, which will cost about $ 22-23 a week<br />
extra for the average family so that doctors can charge<br />
what they like, and charge what the traffic will bear<br />
under a privately insured system.<br />
And we'll end up with a position like the United States,<br />
where if you're in an accident or you're critically ill,<br />
you'll go up to a hospital door but if you don't have the<br />
blue cross card in your pocket they don't admit you.<br />
They just turn you back, sick, sore, or sorry. That's Dr<br />
Hewson's Australia.<br />
These are the spiteful policies of the current coalition.<br />
These are the policies which would make Menzies and<br />
Malcolm Fraser look like Bolsheviks. Who would roll in<br />
their graves at this approach to say that if you can't<br />
help yourself you're kicked out. If structural change<br />
has made you unemployed, you're stigmatised and you bear<br />
the burden of it, if you're sick you can only get medical<br />
protection if you can afford it, and if your children<br />
want a place in university it's OK if you pay it for them<br />
full fees and then there's a place for you, but beyond<br />
that, if you're a child of the low paid or middle paid,<br />
there's no place for you in universities or other forms<br />
of training unless you pay full fees. </p>
<p>They call it opportunity to succeed, freedom to achieve.<br />
Freedom to achieve providing your parents have got<br />
$ 12 000 to $ 15 000 for university place per year.<br />
That's an income of $ 30 000 before tax to put one child<br />
through one university course for one year.<br />
And let me take their industrial relation policies.<br />
They're now saying they'll let federal awards expire.<br />
They will let the industrial relations system turn down,<br />
so that an employee cannot band together with his or her<br />
brothers or sisters and make an industrial agreement with<br />
an employer as a union, but only can we see negotiations,<br />
says Dr Hewson, between an individual person and their<br />
employer. That is, no role for unions. And we'll all<br />
have to say, what hope in the end does an individual<br />
person have with an employer? The whole balance of<br />
society which has come from the right to organise, and<br />
collaborate in industrial negotiation would disappear.<br />
And to add insult to injury they want all the federal<br />
awards to expire, and all the conditions under them<br />
rates of pay, conditions of employment, annual leave,<br />
sick pay all go with them. And you only get the award<br />
back if the employer and the employee opt back into the<br />
system. But if the employer doesn't agree to opt back<br />
into the system, the award expires. So all the things<br />
that people have fought for a century holiday, sick<br />
leave, rates of pay go out the door and you're left<br />
tied up as an individual person with a common law<br />
contract between yourself and your employer.<br />
This is the tough world which Dr Howson has ready for<br />
people. Slipping back to early Thatcherite policies of<br />
the late 1970s, or the ' greed is good' policies of<br />
President Reagan's America. if you're not a millionaire,<br />
you're a bludger, you're a layabout. Well we've seen in<br />
that country the extremes widen between the wealthy and<br />
the poor, that finally the poor took to the streets of<br />
Los Angeles and said something about it.<br />
These are the sort of un-Australian policies that the<br />
Coalition are seeking to introduce into Australia. No<br />
sense of togetherness, no sense of community, no sense of<br />
inclusion, no sense of cooperation, no sense of<br />
kindliness to one another, no softness in policy, no<br />
concern for the weak, the sick, the aged, or the young.<br />
Just a hard computer model that comes out the Federal<br />
Liberal Party's Fightback! proposals.<br />
Their Federal Director today brazenly said that the<br />
taxpayer shouldn't have to put up with you if you're<br />
unemployed for 9 months. You can go to a voluntary<br />
agency, which John Hewson has been around making sure<br />
that they're equipped to look after these people. That<br />
is, they're equipped to receive you and hand out someone<br />
else's clothes, or blanket, or food, or throw you on the<br />
mercy of your family because there will be no support<br />
from the state. </p>
<p>They are the things we are opposed to. We want to put<br />
Australia back together. We want it to grow. I can grow<br />
and succeed to become a smarter place while we have the<br />
focus on education, upon technology, upon product<br />
innovation* But in the context of a nice society one<br />
that looks after you when you're sick, one that looks<br />
after you when you're aged, one that looks after you when<br />
you're infirm, one that looks after you when you're young<br />
and gives you an education and a future, one that looks<br />
after You when you're in the middle of your life's work,<br />
and retrains you, or as a woman gives you a child care<br />
place to let you go and work. This is the sort of<br />
society which we believe in.<br />
Ifm always told by John Howson that I'm wearing a Zegna<br />
suit the same as he is, and who am I to say he has<br />
crossed the tracks. So I said to him the other day in<br />
Parliament last night in the Senate we put our hands up<br />
for occupational superannuation. We voted for the<br />
Superannuation Guarantee Charge ( SGC) which will see 9<br />
per cent paid by employers go to employees to give them a<br />
standard of living in retirement which is now twice the<br />
current age pension. All Australian working men and<br />
women. That's what we put our hand up for in the Senate<br />
last Wednesday night. I said to him, where was your<br />
hand? Your hand was down. You had the boots into<br />
ordinary working people again. They might get themselves<br />
an advantage by building up a pool of savings to provide<br />
for a decent standard of living in retirement, they might<br />
even help put together a pool of national savings which<br />
will help with investment and the current account deficit<br />
and our overseas debt. But you and the Liberal Party<br />
voted against it, as you always do.<br />
And that's the difference between us. The boy from<br />
Welfare Avenue crossed the tracks to vote down<br />
occupational superannuation, to vote down Medicare, to<br />
vote down the right to unemployment benefits when you're<br />
unemployed, to vote down the right of education to<br />
children of working class families. These are all the<br />
things that I believe Australians will not tolerate. And<br />
that's why our party stands for the innovators in<br />
Australia and the party which will draw people together<br />
to declare for Australia proud, unique and to hold our<br />
head up in the world.<br />
We know that we have to get the economy cracking again to<br />
get employment going. And we recognise that too many of<br />
our young people are not finding jobs. It is a problem,<br />
a real problem. We're having a national meeting with<br />
employers in a couple of weeks to get to a basis of<br />
agreement on wages, terms and conditions of employment,<br />
and training, that will help provide many thousands of<br />
new jobs for young people, particularly in that 5-19 year<br />
category. </p>
<p>Dr Hewson criticises us for holding a meeting behind<br />
closed doors. Well, does anybody think that the<br />
industrial practices of 40 or 50 years are going to be<br />
traded away under the glare of television cameras, that<br />
there is going to be a real discussion about these<br />
problems other than the genuine one where people can<br />
discuss things and talk genuinely to one another in<br />
private? That can only happen privately. That's what<br />
we're going to have soon. And that will also help on the<br />
employment front, particularly with young people.<br />
So ladies and gentlemen, can I say this. I thank you<br />
very much for coming to support Peter tonight. This is<br />
the start of his campaign for the next election. And I<br />
can't say it's the start of ours because it's going to<br />
start later than this I think. But we're campaigning, in<br />
a sense, all the time. And we're campaigning for the<br />
right to make Australia an interesting country, a country<br />
with economic promise, a country where people are not<br />
left behind, be it the unemployed, the sick, the aged, or<br />
the young, but one where we take the view that everybody<br />
has the right to inclusion, and we sit down cooperatively<br />
as a society and come together and make this country a<br />
greater place than it is already, find our place in the<br />
Asia-Pacific, declare ourselves to be as we are unique<br />
as a nation and to take our place in the world, which<br />
will lift up the prosperity of Australians.<br />
That's what the challenge is about. That's what we're<br />
going to be working to, and are going to be keeping those<br />
Labor principles in mind, for the greater benefit of all<br />
Australians, not just the wealthy, or the well-to-do, but<br />
all Australians, young and old alike, to give them a<br />
decent, prosperous economy, but in a society which is a<br />
soft, nice society where we care for one another, and<br />
where those great humanitarian values of Labor are not<br />
forgotten in the rush to make a quid.<br />
That's what we stand for and that's what we're going to<br />
be fighting for.<br />
Thank you. </p>
