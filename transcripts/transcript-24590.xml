    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Commonwealth Government will invest $274 million to redevelop the fighter base at Williamtown.</p>
<p>This upgrade is part of the Governmentâs $1.2 billion investment in facilities to prepare the base for our new F-35A Lightning II Joint Strike Fighters (JSF).Â </p>
<p>The first F-35A aircraft are due to arrive in Australia in late 2018. Â Fifty-eight of the fleet will be based at Williamtown.</p>
<p>Todayâs announcement will provide new and refurbished office accommodation and commercial facilities. A number of ageing buildings, which currently donât meet building, safety, environmental or security standards will be demolished.Â  Other structures, such as headquarters, operational and storage facilities, will be refurbished.</p>
<p>Engineering services for electricity, sewerage, telecommunications, fire and water will be upgraded or replaced.Â  The base entrance will also be rebuilt as part of a major security upgrade.</p>
<p>RAAF Williamtown is home to over half Australiaâs fighter aircraft, as well as the Wedgetail Airborne and Early Warning and Control Fleet.Â </p>
<p>This project will create more than 250 jobs <em>over the next three years</em><em>.</em>Â  Construction is due to start in the middle of next year and will continue until mid-2021.</p>
<p>Local industry and small businesses in the Hunter region are encouraged to compete for building contracts.Â  With more than 3,000 military and civilian personnel employed on the base, RAAF Williamtown makes a substantial contribution to the local Hunter economy. Â The redevelopment will provide off-site manufacturing and transport opportunities for local businesses. Â </p>
<p>These works demonstrate the Governmentâs commitment to improve the long term capabilities of our armed forces and create opportunities for our businesses to sustain them.</p>
