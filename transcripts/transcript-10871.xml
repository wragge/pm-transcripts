    <content><![CDATA[<p>I am pleased that the Senate today passed the Flags Amendment Bill</p>
<p> through its remaining parliamentary stages.</p>
<p>The Bill amends the Flags Act 1953 to ensure that the National</p>
<p> Flag can only be changed if the electorate approves an alternative</p>
<p> design. The legislation provides that the existing National Flag shall</p>
<p> always be one of the choices offered at a national vote.</p>
<p>This fulfils another government commitment. This ensures that the</p>
<p> people are consulted about their National Flag which is our oldest</p>
<p> national symbol.</p>
<p>There was strong support for the principle that the design of the</p>
<p> National Flag should be changed only by a majority of voters in a</p>
<p> national vote at the recent Constitutional Convention.</p>
<p>All Australians can now be assured that the design of the National</p>
<p> Flag - their Flag - is a matter for them and not for politicians or</p>
<p> pressure groups.</p>
