    <content><![CDATA[<p>E M B A R G 0 NOT FOR PUBLICATION O. R<br />M ID N I GHT BROADCASTING BEFORE MIDNIGHT<br />FOR PRESS: P. M. No. 107/ 1966<br />ITINERARY FOR PRESIDENTIAL VISIT<br />Statement by the Prime Minister, Mr. Harold Holt<br />The itinerary for the visit to Australia by President Johnson<br />from the 20th 23rd of October has now been drawn up.<br />The programme, arranged by the Commonwealth Government<br />and American authorities in consultation with the relevant States, has been<br />approved by the White House. The variety in the itinerary will give the<br />President and Mrs. Johnson some contact with distinctive features of the<br />Australian scene and way of life.<br />In particular, I am very glad that it has been possible to<br />devise a programme that, within the limited time available, will enable<br />large numbers of Australians to see the President. There will be<br />official drives through the streets of Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane, as<br />well as Canberra. An adjustment to the President's initial plans means that he<br />will now be in Australia for an additional night, the 22nd. The original<br />arrangement provided for departure from Australia late on the night of<br />Saturday, 22nd October, but this has now been changed in favour of<br />departure on Sunday morning.<br />When this change was made, it was contemplated that the<br />President would spend Saturday night in Canberra and make an aircraft<br />refuelling stop of about 45 minutes in Brisbane, but it is now provided<br />that he will fly to Brisbane on Saturday night and leave Australia from<br />Brisbane on Sunday morning. This will not only give the people of<br />Brisbane a better opportunity to see the President but will give him the<br />benefit of a longer break of journey in the flight to Manila.<br />The details of the Australian itinerary are as follows:-<br />THURSDAY, 20TH OCTOBER, 1966<br />6. 00 p. m. Ceremonial arrival at RAAF, Fairb aimn<br />Proceed to Government House, arriving at 6. 50 p. m.<br />Later Leave for Hotel Rex at Canberra arriving at about 7. 30 p. m.<br />Dine privately<br />FRIDAY, 21ST OCTOBER, 1966<br />00 a. m.
