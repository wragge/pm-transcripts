PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 28 September 1989<br />
The Government has appointed Mr Roger Holdich as<br />
Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security for a<br />
period of three years.<br />
Under legislation enacted by my Government following<br />
the recommendations of Mr Justice Hope, the<br />
Inspector-General occupies a pivotal position in<br />
ensuring the accountability of Australia's security and<br />
intelligence agencies; for example, he is able to<br />
conduct inquiries as a result of complaints from members<br />
of the public, at the request of a Minister or at his<br />
own initiative.<br />
Mr Holdich, aged 55, is currently Deputy Public Service<br />
Commissioner. He has served the Government in a number<br />
of senior positions and, in 1986, conducted a major<br />
review of Australia's counter-terrorism capabilities and<br />
arrangements. A more detailed resume is attached.<br />
Mr Holdich succeeds Mr Neil Mclnnes, who was<br />
Inspector-General for three years, and the first person<br />
to hold this position. He has played an important role<br />
in establishing the position as part of the Government's<br />
accountability mechanisms. 207% 9 </p>
