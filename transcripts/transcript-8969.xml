TRANSCRIPT OF QUESTION AND ANSWER SESSION WITH THE PRIME<br />
MINISTER, THE HON. P. J. KEATING, FOLLOWING ADDRESS TO<br />
THE ASIA SOCIETY, NEW YORK, U. S. A.<br />
SEPTEMBER, 1993<br />
J: Sir, the Australian dollar has been taking quite a beating lately against other major<br />
currencies and the RBA has continued to come in to prop it up. Do you plan to<br />
continue with this policy or do you just want to let it float downward? I didn't<br />
mean that as an insult at all because a lot of currencies float up and down.<br />
PM: Well, there was a time when I took the questions of screen jockeys seriously but<br />
fortunately for me that time has passed. And I can say that seeking from any<br />
Government definitive statements about its currency is rather expecting too much.<br />
The Australian dollar has been, for a long period of time, governed by the market's<br />
view about commodity prices and our dependency on commodities. I might say<br />
that that dependency is now weakening substantially as the pattern of Australian<br />
exports has changed to elaborately transformed manufactures, manufactures in<br />
general and services.<br />
So as a country we are much less dependent today on commodities than in the<br />
past. But the currency has always been commodity driven. Now you will know<br />
that commodity prices are now down to the levels that we last saw in 1986, which<br />
was a very low level by historical standards and gold prices have been down<br />
recently, too. And] I think that is what's probably brought the attention of the<br />
market -as indeed the United States dollar has strengthened somewvhat.-Now,<br />
these things run along but the notion that the Government is trying to make a rate<br />
is. I think, wrong. We've never sought to do that. But we don't want to see our<br />
currency unnecessarily knocked about by individual transactions and we take<br />
appropriate steps to deal wvith that. But that's all the world of difference than<br />
trying to make a rate, which I don't think we've ever sought to do.<br />
At any rate, that fact is that there is a lot of movement in currencies these days.<br />
It's the way economics equilibrate to the changes in the terms of trade. It's one of<br />
the values in floating exchange rates and you can see by the fixed exchange rate </p>
<p>TEL: 16. Sep. 93 9: 15 NO. 007 P. 02/ 0S<br />
systems of Europe how unreal they become when the strains and stresses really<br />
start. So, I'm afraid if you want to be r4, king guesses about the A dollar you're<br />
going to have to use your professional judgement rather than rely on me, at lunch.<br />
3: Mr Prime Minister you mentioned earlier that Australia's competitive position has<br />
improved considerably and that it is equal to mnany in your region. How do you<br />
see this reflected in the external balance in the merchandise trade, picture and so<br />
forth? Could you elaborate? Has this been reflected in shifts in your external trade<br />
balances?<br />
PM: It certainly has. And I think it is reflected most obviously in our general trade<br />
performance and our capacity to service our debt. Not so many years ago, three<br />
or four years ago we needed about 22 or 23 percent of our export proceeds to<br />
service our debt. That's now down to about fourteen percent. And that's in part<br />
because of a better export performance on our part. And we are very competitive;<br />
we're about 25 percent more competitive than just a couple of years ago. We're<br />
vastly more competitive than a decade ago.<br />
We now have very low inflation, with underlying inflation running at around 2<br />
percent. and we have a competitive exchange rate. We have a high profit share in<br />
the ec6nomy the profit share in GD-P is around about the peak of the late 1980s<br />
already. And all of this, I think, is good for investment, good for production, good<br />
for exports and good for employment and good for jobs. So, we've now got very<br />
competitive macro-economics settings. And in our tax system, for instance, welve<br />
now got a corporate rate competitive with Asia, at 33 percent. We've got no,<br />
there is no double taxation of dividends in Australia. We've got very large tax<br />
concessions for research and development, for accelerated depreciation of plant<br />
and equipment.<br />
So, wherever you look whether it's the tax systemn or it is inflation or it is interest<br />
rates or exchange rates or profits, we are now very, very competitive. And I think<br />
that's showing in our exports and particularly in the changed culture towards Asia<br />
which has taken place across the sectors of Australian manufacturing and<br />
Australian commerce where there's a real sea change in the view of Australian<br />
executives on how they approach export markets and with what fervour and<br />
commitment they approach theni,<br />
J1: Mr Prime Minister, unemployment levels in the world have been getting a 8reat<br />
deal of attention. As you mentioned during the presentation, the Australian<br />
unemployment level is what you would consider very high. Do you view this as a<br />
structural problem and what are some of thc specific steps that the Government is<br />
taking to alleviate the problem and can it be solved in the future? </p>
<p>TEL .3.<br />
PM: Well, it's partly structural and it's partly Cclical. Part of it is from the economic<br />
cycle of the recession; part of its from the churning that's taking place in our<br />
industrial structure. And we're trying to take people and retrain them and put them<br />
back into other sectors of employment and we are directing labour market<br />
programs at the long term unemployed. That is, those people-who are unemployed<br />
for 12 months or more -to give them work experience, training and a36iubsidyto<br />
get them back into the workforce, to get their self esteem up, to give them the<br />
opportunity of getting some specialisations back and some skills back so that they<br />
can maintain their place. And we have a very high success rate with the<br />
unemployed people: who are contacted by our labour market programs.<br />
But aggregate unemployment is still high at around I1I percent although, I might<br />
add, with a very high participation rate. That is, the number of people the<br />
proportion of the population in the workforce is very high in Australia. If we were<br />
comparing for instance the participation rate in the United States with Australia,<br />
were we to have your participation rate we'd have unemployment down to around<br />
6 or 7 percent. But with our participation rate, unemployment is at around I I<br />
( percent).<br />
Now, that means that many people are looking for work and the only way of<br />
finding it, in the end, will be economic growth. And we've got the Australian<br />
economy growing again at about 3 percent and we're hoping for more growth in<br />
the coming year and we see growth principally as a way of providing the jobs.<br />
But, we are now in a productivity laden recovery. This is not an employment<br />
laden recovery as the 1983 recovery was. This is a productivity laden recovery.<br />
And so were gettingrmore output from fewer people, which I guess means that<br />
we've got to have mnore output again, if we are to take up the number of jobs that<br />
we wvant to see be takent up.<br />
As well as that, the Government has commissioned a task force to look at novel<br />
ways in which we might deal with unemployment systemic changes which might<br />
help us deal with this problem, While the cycle of the economy is changing, while<br />
cyclical unemployment is declining and while we are still dealing with the churning<br />
which has come through the change to our industrial structures fromn the old<br />
Australia to the modern industrial Australia. This will be, I think, an important<br />
report for the Government to sec in which ways we can actually do something<br />
novel -in world terms -to help the unemployed.<br />
But, above all else, our commitment will be to growth and emnployment through<br />
growth by letting the Australian economy grow when we see the opportunities to<br />
let it grow. We won't be artificially constraining its growth because we do have an<br />
incomes policy to rely upon, as well as monetary policy, so we are able to let the<br />

-4,<br />
economy grow faster than most other compgrable countries. That, we hope, will<br />
be a longer term answer to unemployment.<br />
3: Mr Prime Minister, in your remarks you-;'* phasise the consensualnauef<br />
politics in Australia. Arnd yet on the mosf recent Budget it seems that things may<br />
have been going something amiss. I'm wondering if you could take a moment or<br />
two just to clarify the Government's position on the Budget and what we might<br />
expect in the weeks ahead?<br />
PM: Well, the first thing I would say to you is we're pretty confident the Budget will<br />
pass through the Parliament. No other Australian Budget hasn't and we think this<br />
one will. The reason that this one is an issue is bt sciee conservative parties in<br />
Australia have decided to vote against, to obstruct the Budget's passage because<br />
they are miffed about losing, having lost the last election. Now, that's not much of<br />
a reason for voting against a Budget, but that is their reason.<br />
And that has meant that the Government has had to go down the highways and<br />
byways of our second chamber to ensure the Budget's passage and that's why it is<br />
in the debate. This is not a policy which can be sustained by the conservative<br />
pariies in Australia. The Government convincingly won the election six months<br />
ago and therefore it has a very firm mandate for its policies. And the notion that<br />
the opposing party can upset it is not one that normally has currency in Australian<br />
public life.<br />
Now the traditions are different in the United States. Gencrally, here the<br />
Republicans don't normally pitch in and help a Democratic administration carry<br />
budgetary mneasures as we've seen in the United States again recently. But in our<br />
country the Government is made in the House of Representatives and the money<br />
legislation of the country is made there and the convention is that it has passage<br />
through our upper house. The conservative parties in Australia, this time, are<br />
breaking that convention which only means we've got to spend more timne about<br />
the Budget's passage. But pass the Budget will; which then has the happy effect<br />
for me of inaking the conservative parties even more irrelevant than they are now.<br />
3: Mr Keating, I just wonder in termns of the Olym pic choice whether it's Sydney or<br />
Beijing what change would you expect Sydney winning the Olympic bid would<br />
have on your economic forecasts?<br />
P M. I don't know that it would change our forecasts all that much but it would<br />
obviously be a good thing for Australia to host an Olympics. Sydney is well<br />
capable of hosting an Olympics. We've got quite unique facilities, I think, in world<br />
termns not just in national terms ror this bid. And were we to win it it would be a </p>
<p>16. Sep. 93 9: 15 No. 007 P. 05/ 09<br />
good thing, I think for the southern hemisphere and for the Pacific in the year 2000<br />
let alone for Australia and Sydney in particular. And I think it would be a good<br />
opportunity for us to advertise the Australian nation, its unique identity and its<br />
success, its social cohesion, its role in the world. All these things, I think, are<br />
opportunities opened up to the host of the Olympic Games.<br />
So, I think that's the tangible benefit from it rather than the impetus to growth in<br />
any particular year. No doubt there would be some impetus to growth in the year<br />
2000 were we to secure the Olympic Games but I don't think that is something<br />
which we need to rely upon to build our economic fortunes. It's just one of those<br />
little pluses that come through along the way. More important, I think, for the<br />
country's culture and its view the view of it in the world than it is for any<br />
particular economic effect.<br />
PM: Well, I think I have exhausted you all. Oh no, there are a few punters over here..<br />
3: Mr Prime Minister, could you elaborate a bit on which countries in Asia you might<br />
see priority in trade with you referred to the continent but any countries in<br />
particular?<br />
PM: Well the great bulk of our trade, the largest most preponderant parcel of our trade<br />
is with Japan. And I was just speaking briefly at the table here earlier about our<br />
trade with Japan which is very large. U. S.-Japan two way trade is about $ 100<br />
billion but Australia. Japan two way trade is about $ 20 billion. We have a fifth of<br />
the trade the United States has but the United States economy is twenty times<br />
larger than ours. Which gives you some indication of the level of trade between<br />
Australia and Japan. That's the principal trade sinew of South East Asia and<br />
around that we've also other trading possibilities and opportunities. Among them,<br />
and most notable I suppose is Korea and more latterly, China and the ASEAN<br />
group of countries. So, it is probably the growth opportunites across them all<br />
the growth opportunites are probably greater amongst the ASEAN countries of<br />
Thailand, Indo-China and China itself given that we already have a high level of<br />
trade with Japan and Korea. But in those two countries the trade is continuing to<br />
change to sophisticate away ftom bulk traded commodities onto manufactures and<br />
elaborately transformed goods. And that, I hope, will continue to grow but there<br />
are enormous growth opportunites in these other economies which we intend to<br />
take up as well.<br />
The important cultural change that has taken place in Australia is the attitude of<br />
Australian business to exports. Instead of regarding exports as an exportable<br />
surplus from some domestic production program, companies are now going in for<br />
exports as a primary business. And you're seeing this in food, in food processing<br />
TEL: </p>
<p>TEL -6,<br />
where we've seen very large acquisition of brand names and the building of quite<br />
large capital structures to export into South East Asia. We're seeing it in<br />
telecommunications, we're seeing it in all sorts of elaborately transformed sectors,<br />
And this is a sea change, as I said earlier, Which we've never had before. So, the<br />
cultural shift in Australia has well and truely been made. It's now simply a matter<br />
of driving it home and maintaining the competitiveness hard won<br />
competitiveness we now have so that we can drive it home.<br />
But wc need the structures to do it in and that's where APEC becomes important.<br />
We need the trade liberalising agenda of APEC to give us the opportunities which<br />
we otherwise wouldn't have the very same opportunities which will make all of<br />
the economies of the region so much wealthier where the velocity of trade can~ be<br />
so much greater. So) while we have distinct and important trading opportunities<br />
we want to get the institutional structures right so that we can not only exploit the<br />
very high levels of growth which are currently obtained in this part of the world,<br />
but even higher levels of growth with even less impediment to trade and<br />
investment so that we can all benefit from a higher velocity of growth in incomnes<br />
through the region. So, really, I think, from Australia's point of view we fire now<br />
in the game in earnest. And we're now earnestly trying to change the institutional<br />
structure so that we remain in the game in perpetuity.<br />
J: Mr Prime Minister, to what extent do you think that the inflationary conditions in<br />
China and the large current account deficit that China has to what extent are<br />
these a threat to trade generally in the Pacific basin and to Australia specifically?<br />
PM: I don't think they're a threat to trade generally. I think China will continue to grow<br />
at a healthy pace. Maybe not growing as fast as it is now, obviously, with<br />
unsustainable levels of investment, And China is now seeking ways of curbing that<br />
activity -while lacking the sophisticated instruments that exist in an economy like<br />
the United States or Australia, They don't have a readily available monetary<br />
systemn to use. Fiscal policy doesn't have the sharpness it has in the United States<br />
or Australiat so there's a much heavier reliance upon administrative mneanis of<br />
slowing up the Chinese economy while at the same time developing these<br />
instruments. So, I would think that yes, we will see China slow down and that will<br />
cause some gnashing of teeth.<br />
But it will still grow at a clip, I think, and it is not simply China's growth though<br />
upon which Australia's trade opponiunites in the area depend or the United<br />
States' trade opportunities in the area though obviously they are enhanced by<br />
China's growth. And the income growth, that's the important thing I think, the<br />
income growth within China itself. But, yes they are in a period of very high<br />
growth, inflation has taken off, they know this is a bad thing for them and they are<br />

.7-<br />
doing all they can, 1 think, to bring it back. Atid we should assist themn where we<br />
can in doing that so that their growth is sustainable and that they're in there playing<br />
a long term role on a sustainable basis and not find themselves in, simply, cycles<br />
which are unsustainable and basically sout their investment sectors and those who<br />
invest in them. So, I think China is going to be a very strong player into the future<br />
and I don't think we ought to believe that the current slowdown is going to be<br />
immeasureably change the nature of their economic transition.<br />
J. Mr Keating, I'm an Australian exporter in the fashion industry, new into the United<br />
States. I was just wondering, are you intending to increase the frequency of<br />
payments under the Export Market Development Grant.<br />
PM: We've put somne changes through in the Budget, I think, to enhance the Export<br />
Market Development Grant Scheme. One of the things which a study we had;, by<br />
the McKinsey company, of 700 dynamic exporting companies or the most dynamic<br />
exporting companies in Australia.... One of the things that survey found was that<br />
export market development assistance was of material assistance in helping<br />
businesses develop new markets in various parts of the world.<br />
And so in the recent Budget we have increased funding for export market<br />
development assistance and from memory, one of those things is more frequent<br />
payment. In other words, you don't have to wait until the end of the year to get a<br />
reimbursement of your expenditure -which I think is the point of your question.<br />
I think you'll find a perusal of the Budget papers will reveal that to you, if I'm not<br />
mistaken.<br />
