3) SECOND READING<br />
[ From the " Parliamentary Debates," 7th May, 1964.]<br />
Sir ROBERT MENZIES ( Kooyong-<br />
Prime Minister) [ 11.181.-1 move-<br />
That the bill be now read a second time.<br />
This bill will carry into effect a promise<br />
,-de by the Government that, if returned<br />
Jpower, it would provide annual amounts<br />
of œ 5,000,000 for the provision of science<br />
buildings and equipment in all secondary<br />
schools, government or independent, without<br />
discrimination, and similar amounts of<br />
000,000 annually for State technical<br />
JIcation. Both grants are to be made<br />
under the powers conferred by section 96 of<br />
the Constitution, and State governments<br />
have agreed to be the channel whereby<br />
amounts will be paid to independent schools.<br />
In the case of the grant for the provision<br />
of science buildings and equipment in<br />
secondary schools, honorable members will<br />
recall that on 5th March last a statement<br />
was made by my colleague in the Senate and<br />
also read by me in this House giving details<br />
of the manner in which these grants were<br />
to be made, and it is therefore unnecessary<br />
to enlarge at length on the proposal. On<br />
that occasion, schools which were eligible<br />
5941/ 64. for assistance, and which were seeking assistance,<br />
were invited to make application as<br />
soon as possible. Up to the closing date<br />
for applications to be considered for assistance<br />
in the year 1964-65, which was set<br />
as the 21st April, some 410 complcted<br />
questionnaires had been received from independent<br />
schools, and a further 96 completed<br />
forms have since come in. So there has<br />
been a very wide response.<br />
Since the original statement, the personnel<br />
an~ d terms of reference of the committee set<br />
up to advise the Government on standards<br />
of science buildings and equipment for independent<br />
schools and on particular projects<br />
submitted by these schools have been<br />
announced and the committee has commenced<br />
operation. In the nature of the<br />
detailed examinations required for each<br />
project, it may take some little time before<br />
all grants for 1964-65 can be approved.<br />
Excellent co-operation -has been received<br />
from the authorities responsible for independent<br />
schools, who are in process of<br />
setting up committees of advice in each<br />
State. </p>
<p>I think we have seen enough already to<br />
indicate the substantial size of the programme<br />
in front of us, and the great need<br />
for improvement in the science facilities of<br />
many independent schools, which have been<br />
struggling along endeavouring to teach<br />
science, often under severe difficulties.<br />
The magnitude of the problem means, of<br />
course, that even with the substantial funds<br />
we have made available, many schools will<br />
have to wait some years for assistance. This<br />
may have some compensating advantages<br />
because many schools will require a good<br />
deal of time to plan in full detail the<br />
facilities best suited to their needs.<br />
Honorable members will observe that<br />
in the First Schedule to the bill the amount<br />
appropriated for science laboratories and<br />
equipment is œ 4,952,900. The remaining<br />
sum required to bring the total to<br />
œ 5,000,000 is œ 47,100 and this is the share<br />
of schools in the Australian Capital Territory<br />
and the Northern Territory, which will<br />
be separately appropriated in the forthcoming<br />
Budget. It will be recalled that the method chosen<br />
to divide the money between government<br />
schools and non-government schools is first<br />
by obtaining from the Commonwealth<br />
Statistician the numbers of secondary school<br />
pupils enrolled in government schools and<br />
the numbers of secondary school pupils<br />
enrolled in non-government schools and<br />
dividing the total amount of œ 5,000,000 in<br />
proportion to those numbers throughout<br />
Australia, and, secondly, allotting the sum<br />
available for government schools to the<br />
various State Governments in proportion to<br />
the populations of the States as certified by<br />
the Statistician. On this occasion, the total<br />
sum available to non-government schools<br />
will also be divided in an identical fashic<br />
although in future years it will prove de\,)<br />
able, from time to time, to adopt a more<br />
flexible division between non-government<br />
schools in the States, depending upon the<br />
urgency of the need as revealed by investigation<br />
of school applications.<br />
Splitting the funds available on t,.<br />
formula I have given will yield the following<br />
results for 1964-65:-<br />

Discussions with the States as to the<br />
avenues for expenditure of amounts available<br />
to them are still in process, but from<br />
the plans put forward so far, and from the<br />
amounts of money being made available by<br />
the Commonwealth in relation to amounts<br />
previously spent by the States. I believe<br />
that the new grants are going to have an<br />
immensely stimulating effect on the teaching<br />
of science in schools throughout the. country.<br />
Emphasis on the significance of this is hardly<br />
necessary. There are two ends to be served. The<br />
first is to raise the general level of education<br />
in a society which is becoming increasingly<br />
dependent upon the scientific use of resources.<br />
The second is the special education<br />
necessary for those young people who<br />
are to take up scientific or technological<br />
careers of all sorts, and who must come<br />
forward in increasing numbers, and must<br />
have an ever-deeper understanding of<br />
science both theoretical and applied. </p>
<p>The new grants will enable States, as we<br />
have already seen from preliminary plans,<br />
to undertake new and imaginative projects<br />
for raising the standards of the best students<br />
and preparing them for work at tertiary<br />
level; and this development will, I am sure,<br />
be paralleled in the private school systems.<br />
Coupled with the opportunities for the most<br />
talented young people to prolong their<br />
schooling through the new Commonwealth<br />
secondary scholarships, I believe that this<br />
plan opens a new era for the development of<br />
scientific education in this country, in an<br />
age when all advanced countries are putting<br />
great emphasis on the application of science<br />
to development and welfare.<br />
Turning now to the grants for buildings<br />
~ Ad equipment for use in technical training,<br />
the split-up in the Second Schedule will<br />
indicate the entitlement for each State. We<br />
had hoped that before the introduction of<br />
-this bill the Committee on the Future of<br />
ertiary Education under the chairmanship<br />
-of Sir Leslie Martin would have reported,<br />
and that we would have been in a position<br />
to take into account those of its recommendations<br />
that may affect the area of<br />
technical and technological education.<br />
There is, however, no difficulty at all in<br />
1964-65 in carrying out the intentions of<br />
the Government with respect to this grant,<br />
which will be spent for any purpose in the<br />
fields of the training of tradesmen, technicians<br />
and technologists agreed between the<br />
Commonwealth and each individual State.<br />
:) There is no intention on the part of the<br />
ommonwealth to exercise a close supervision<br />
over the States either in the field of<br />
science buildings and equipment or in the<br />
field of technical education, provided that<br />
we are satisfied that in both cases expendi-<br />
&gt; ire by the Commonwealth is in addition<br />
1--to, and not in substitution for State expenditure;<br />
and the State Governments have<br />
readily agreed to this proviso. The method<br />
of procedure will be a simple one, involving<br />
agreement in general between Commonwealth<br />
and States as to the type of project<br />
upon which expenditure is to take place,<br />
notification by the States within that general<br />
agreement of the particular projects to be<br />
undertaken, and agreement by the Commonwealth.<br />
Thereafter, construction can proceed at<br />
speed, without detailed supervision by the<br />
Commonwealth. Examples of the type of<br />
project which will be assisted are the very<br />
substantial expansion of the Hobart Technical<br />
College and the Central Technical<br />
College in Brisbane. A wide range of<br />
courses will benefit from this expenditure,<br />
which I might say will represent a very<br />
substantial increase indeed in the size of the<br />
technical education building programme in<br />
the various States; and the moneys available<br />
for producing skilled tradesmen, technicians<br />
and technologists will be greatly augmented.<br />
New ground is being broken in both the<br />
scientific and technical fields, and it is<br />
invigorating to see the readiness with which<br />
all sections of the educational field have<br />
responded to the offers of assistance and<br />
the fresh thinking which has already been<br />
engendered. My hope and I am sure the<br />
hope of all honorable members is that<br />
Commonwealth moneys can with great benefit<br />
be used to stimulate activities which could<br />
not be afforded previously by either State or<br />
independent schools, and that teaching of<br />
science and training of skilled young men<br />
and women will be greatly improved.<br />
Debate ( on motion by Mr. Calwell)<br />
adjourned.<br />
