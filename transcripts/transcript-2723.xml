FOR PRESS: MR. WHITLAM's ECONOMIC FANTASIES<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister, the Rt. Hon. William<br />
r. icMahon, l^. P.<br />
The latest excursion by the Leader of the Labor<br />
Party into economic fantasy and downright inaccuracy illustrate<br />
his complete ignorance of financial principles and facts.<br />
His claim that ne would double national production<br />
in ten years is as ill-considered as his recent declaration<br />
that he would re-value the Australian dollar now, completely<br />
ignoring the damage that would do to our great rural,<br />
manufacturing and mining industries.<br />
It is obvious that Rr. hitlamr. is seeking office by<br />
making promises which he cannot keep, especially against the<br />
background of his Party's declared economic policies and<br />
intentions. The frustrations of being so long in opposition<br />
have led the Labor Party to present irresponsible, grab-all<br />
proposals that would certainly damage the economy beyond<br />
repair. Mr. Whitlam says that a Labor Government would aim<br />
for growth of six to seven percent per year. This is an<br />
astonishingly ambitious target for him, with his policies.<br />
In fact his own election promises would clearly prevent him<br />
achieving his policies. What is worse, they would actually<br />
depress growth. Take their 35 hour week and extended annual leave<br />
proposals. These must reduce output per man that is<br />
productivity, on which growth depends so heavily.<br />
Then there is immigration. In the past this has done<br />
much for national growth. It has enabled employers to find<br />
labour for many development projects and to recruit particular<br />
skills which would otherwise be unavailable. Labor would<br />
reduce immigration and what is more, it would cease Government<br />
recruiting. This vould mean there would be no selection on the<br />
basis of skill. Here again the national economy would suffer.<br />
./ 2 </p>
<p>-2<br />
A growth of six or seven percent has not been<br />
achieved in the past in Australia over more than a very short<br />
period and Mr. Whitlan has not indicated what steps Labor<br />
would take to step up growth other than introduce indicative<br />
planning. But comprehensive indicative planning would require<br />
a significant diversion of manpower from other urgent tasks.<br />
Indicative planning involves target setting and targets which<br />
turn out to be unrealistic -and many must be are worse than<br />
useless. When efforts and resources are devoted to trying to<br />
make thle facts of economic life fit the plans the result is<br />
likely to be reduced rather than enhanced growth.<br />
1M1r. Whitlam falsely says that Australia's growth<br />
rate in the 1960' s was less than 3 percent. The facts are that<br />
Australia's growth rate in the 1960' s was about 5h percent a<br />
year. He also ignored the fact that inflation has eased.<br />
The consumer price index has been rising at 7 percent, but so<br />
far this year it has declined to around 5 percent.<br />
Both these rates of increase in prices are below<br />
what was experienced in the immediate postwar years and<br />
unemployment has been well below the peak of 1961.<br />
Mr. Whitlan also falsely represented the September<br />
quarter figures on growth. Hc said thc: increase was only<br />
.3 percent. While this was the increase estimated in G. N. P.<br />
at constant prices, the figure was sharply affected by a<br />
set-back in the farm sector caused by drought. This is<br />
temporary. The significant figure was that non-farm G. N. P.<br />
at constant prices grew in the September quarter at an annual<br />
rate of 4 percent. It is the Government Partics' objective to obtain<br />
thle maximum growth1* rate our economy can sustain and we have<br />
proved that we can bc successful.<br />
We know our policies and programmes can and will<br />
achieve maximum growth. We also know that Labor could not do<br />
this, on the evidence of Mr. Whitlam's own economic fallibility.<br />
Mr. Whitlam was reported as saying that based on<br />
calculations by the Mielbourne University's Institute of Applied<br />
Economic and Social Research, the growth rate would need to<br />
reach 6 percent to eliminate unemployment next year.<br />
What he has failed to realise is that growth of this<br />
order from now on is, in fact, implicit in the Government's<br />
expectations that G. N. P. at constant prices will increase in<br />
1972/ 73 as a whole by 5 percent. / 3 </p>
<p>-3<br />
But such growth is predicated on the fact that<br />
sound economic policies are followed. If -Mr. Vhitlam's<br />
policies are followed, the very basis of our growth would,<br />
as I have said, be completely destroyed.<br />
The Australian economy is buoyant, unemployment is<br />
at a low level, inflation has eased and the growth rate is<br />
increasing. Personal taxation has been reduced significantly<br />
and the tax scales have been restructured. That is the true<br />
state of affairs today. Hore are the facts in brief.<br />
Inflation The consumer price index hias dropped from an annual<br />
rate of 7 percent to 5 percent.<br />
Employmcnt There were 82,400 persons out of a work force of<br />
million registercd for employment last month. This is<br />
1.46 percent of the work force a figure accepted as close<br />
to full employment and one of the best in t%-hc world. In other<br />
words, around 98.5 percent of the work force is gainfully<br />
employed. Prospects for school-leavers are excellent.<br />
Consumer Demand Retail spending us up 12 percent compared with<br />
8 percent last year.<br />
Building Dwelling approvals are rising very strongly and<br />
seasonally adjusted, are at a record level. The total value<br />
of all building approved in September was the second highnest<br />
figure ever recorded.<br />
Growth A grOw~ th rate of better than 5 percent in real termsnot<br />
3 pcercent as Wgnitlam claims has in fact been achieved<br />
in recent years. We are approaching that level again after the recent<br />
temporary setback to the cconomy.<br />
CANBERRA, 27 November, 1972 </p>
