    <content><![CDATA[<p>Fax from 061/ 6132 g<br />6 November 1996 TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER<br />THE HON. JOHN HOWARD MP<br />OPENING OF<br />NATIONAL SMALL BUSINESS FORUM<br />PARLIAMENT HOUSE<br />E O E<br />Ladies and Gentlemen, I'm very pleased to have the opportunity of being present at<br />this first meeting of' this Forum and the new Government. I hope and from our point<br />of view, I intend that meeting this Forum will be a very important channel of<br />communication between the Government and the small business community of<br />Australia and I am delighted that the Forum comprises such a wide range of<br />organisations, some large, some concentrated, some not so large, but all in all you<br />represent a very significant cross section of the small business community of Australia.<br />It would be no exaggeration to say that we placed an enormous amount of rhetorical<br />emphasis on small business in the lead up to the election. We also placed a lot of<br />policy emphasis on it and a great deal of our energy since the election has been debated<br />in that area. You mentioned a moment ago, Mr Chairman, that you hoped that Peter<br />Reith would be along. I guess of all of the reform measures that the Government has<br />attempted in the last eight months, none has been more important than our attempts to<br />change the industrial relations laws. I hope within a matter of a couple of weeks, if not<br />a little sooner, I don't know the exact date, its always a bit indeterminate when you are<br />dealing with the totality of the Parliament, I hope that the industrial relations laws and<br />changes will be a reality and over the longer term those reforms will have a greater<br />impact on small business in Australia than just about any other change that any<br />government can undertake. They will throw out the existing unfair dismissal laws<br />which I know have been the bane of the existence of many small businesses in Australia<br />for the last three years. They will also introduce a new era in the making of the<br />workplace agreements, they will end for all time the last vestiges of compulsory<br />unionism and the closed shop. They will provide a great deal more choice for those<br />workers who want to belong to unions and I think many of their provisions will deliver<br />a great deal of benefits for small business. 06/ 11/ 96 13: 25 Pg:</p>
<p>Fax from I know from my discussions with him that Peter Reith has talked extensively with many<br />of the organisations who are represented around this table and I want to take the<br />opportunity publicly of congratulating him for the excellent job he has done in<br />negotiating with the Australian Democrats an agreement to a secure passage of the bill.<br />Inevitably when you reach agreement with a minor party there are some compromises<br />that have to be reached otherwise you can't get the legislation through. We might<br />have a majority of 45 in the House of Representatives but we don't have a majority in<br />the Senate and one of the political realities I would ask you to accept, that if on<br />occasions you don't think we are moving fast enough or quite as far as you believe we<br />ought to go or to the letter of what we said in the election we would like to do or<br />suggest we ought to go, I just ask you to understand that when you control both<br />Houses of Parliament you have more flexibility than when you control only one and I<br />occasionally gaze with envy on those governments that control both Houses of<br />Parliament but the Australian people did not give us control of the Senate but we have<br />to live and work with that reality and there is no good stamping our feet and hurling<br />abusive epithets at people, it's a question of working with what the people in a<br />democratic process gave us and see what we can achieve.<br />I have no doubt that the bill in the form agreed between Peter Reith and the Democrats<br />will deliver major reform to the Australian industrial relations scene. It will deliver<br />major benefits to small business and over time the enhanced flexibility that it will<br />provide will not only work for the benefit of small business but also to medium sized<br />and larger firms so it is a very significant reform and we are on the verge of having it<br />achieved and over time it will deliver a lot of benefits to the people whose cause you<br />represent in your daily activities but also around this table.<br />We have delivered on our commitment to reduce provisional tax uplift factor from 8%<br />to We in the budget announced the implementation of a capital gains tax roll-over<br />relief to take effect from the first of July next year as promised. We have received the<br />Small Business Deregulation Taskfor-e 14eport and I guess that will be the subject of<br />some discussion around the table. I thought it was an excellent report and I undertook<br />to the authors of the report and to the public that we would have a comprehensive<br />response to it by the middle of February which is about as quick given the intervention<br />of Christmas, it is about as quick a timetable as we can possibly envisage.<br />There are a number of other initiatives that I would just like to touch on which<br />although they are not exclusively small business they are important to small business. I<br />wanted to emnphasise the importance of our Supermarket to Asia Strategy. It is a<br />special committee that I chair designed to bring together all those activities that can<br />contribute to makdng Australia an increasing source of both fresh and processed food<br />exports to the Asia-Pacific Region. One of the realities of life when we talk about the<br />Asia-Pacific region is that there is a growing middle class in that area whose<br />purchasing power is growing everyday and the capacity of that middle class to become<br />a major purchaser of Australian food, processed food, will just, I think, expand<br />exponentially over the next ten or twenty years and the opportunities that exist there, I<br />am talking here of transport as well as production capacity, the opportunities that exist<br />there, are quite enormous and that's why if the instigation of the Food Council and the<br />National Farmers Federation I brought together a group of people including a<br />Faoxm 06/ 11/ 96 13: 25 Pg: 6</p>
<p>Fax from representative of the ACTU and I am very pleased that the unions are involved in cooperating<br />with this exercise. The food industry, the transport industry and three of my<br />senior Ministers sit on the committee as well and I think the opportunities that focus of<br />this Committee's work will provide for small business will be quite significant.<br />There has been some criticism of budget cuts that affect business. I note that, I<br />understand why some people would be critical of some changes that directly affect<br />their constituents and when you bring down a Budget that achieves such an enormous<br />shift in fiscal policy as our budget did, then inevitably there are going to be some<br />elements of that shift that in a sectoral sense people won't like. I would say in relation<br />to small business that in relative terms it has been I think well treated in relation to<br />those reductions. Let me quote as an example the slightly lesser contribution to the<br />export market development branch but it is in the context of having a much greater<br />focus on small firms rather than the larger ones and I think that you will find that<br />elsewhere, and an interesting statistic that I had unearthed a couple of days ago,<br />indicates that in relation to manufacturing support through the budget from this year<br />through to 1998-99 we will actually be spending 450 million dollars more on<br />manufacturing support than was expended in the last budget of the former government.<br />So it's not in some areas quite as bad as some of the criticism has suggested but I<br />acknowledge there has been some criticism of that but I would ask you to have a look<br />at the overall economic benefit of having cut the deficit so significantly.<br />There is even rumours around this morning of further movements in interest rates. I<br />haven't heard any announcements but if there were to be an announcement this<br />morning the inflationary benefits of that would be quite significant.<br />I won't talk about housing because there has already been very, very significant<br />reduction in interest rates in that area but I would imagine that fibr most of your<br />members lower interest rates leading to more incentives for investment is about as<br />good tonic as any of you could hope to have. Now I would be the last person to claim<br />that the only reason interest rates come down is because there has been a cut in the<br />budget deficit. It is not quite as simple as that. There are a lot of things that feed into<br />lower interest rates, lower inflation, lower wage growth, overseas interest rate<br />relativities but the cut in the budget deficit was part of the mosaic and I would argue<br />very strongly that any sectoral difficulty caused by an individual budget decision is<br />more than outweighed by the overall benefit to the economy of having achieved a very<br />big fiscal shift. I mean, to shift 7-8 billion dollars in the space of two years which is<br />about 2 percentage points of GDP of government expenditure is a very big shift and if<br />we get that all battened down, have it all passed through the Senate that will lay a very<br />firm foundation in our first twelve months in office. You all know, you are all realists,<br />you know that if governments don't take those sorts of decisions in the first year of a<br />government's first term they are probably never going to take them and that was the<br />attitude that we took.<br />Mr Chairman, can I again thank you for your willingness to come here. Can I<br />commend you to the good offices and tender mercies of my Minister, Geoff Prosser<br />who as the Chairman rightly said, came out of the business stable and one of the things<br />I am very, very happy to say, and I want to take the opportunity of saying this against<br />Fa om06/ 11/ 96 13: 25 Pg: 7</p>
<p>Fax from the backizround of some of the nonsense that has been around in recent weeks about<br />people having business interests and coming from a business background, I regard it as<br />a positive badge of honour that I have got a significant number of people in my Cabinet<br />who have had a business background. I think that is a plus, not a minus, and it is not<br />something to be shy about, it is not something to be ashamed of, it is something to be<br />proud of. You need a mixture of people, you don't want a government composed<br />entirely of businessmen, but you want a few of them. You don't want a government<br />composed entirely of lawyers either, but you want a few of them you certainly don't<br />want a government composed entirely of former public servants or former party<br />apparatchiks. Although I have not objection to former public servants being in the<br />ministry or former academics, I have got some of those, and 1 don't mind former<br />apparatchiks of a certain variety but I draw the line at some former Party apparatchiks<br />but you do need mixture and this idea that there is something sort of awkward and<br />difficult about having somebody who has a business background is ridiculous and we<br />need to break that mould and I am delighted that somebody of Geoff Prosser's<br />successfuzl experience in business is available because it does mean that you have a<br />greater understanding of the realities and I have often said that one of the reasons why<br />business complains so much about the red tape and the regulation that is handed down<br />on high is that it is often decided upon by people who have no practical understanding<br />of the impact of red tape on the cost of running a business, particularly a small<br />business, and it's a miracle to me how some men and women in small business find any<br />time to comply with the regula. tions that they are required to meet.<br />So it's very nice to see you all and I hope that you all have a very profitable forum and<br />I'm sure that no matter what the issue is that you will get a very receptive ear from Mr<br />Prosser and I hope you have an opportunity of talking to Peter later in the day because<br />he his a very important message to reinforce on the industrial relations front<br />Wr Chairman, thank you very much, good luck and we value very warmly your<br />counsel and advice.<br />Thank you.
