<p>SATCHELL:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, welcome this morning.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Good morning, nice to talk to you again, Phillip. How are you keeping?</p>
<p>SATCHELL:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, I gather that you just, well, your car was just</p>
<p>   behind a spot of trouble on the road to Para Hills.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Oh, yes, there was an accident and a car had been overturned and</p>
<p>   fortunately, apart from the shock that people have, nobody seemed</p>
<p>   to have been hurt and I spoke to the driver and inquired of him,</p>
<p>   and whatever, and thankfully nobody had been hurt. I can't</p>
<p>   comment any more than that because the police came and investigated</p>
<p>   it and it's not for me to make any observation about what had</p>
<p>   happened.</p>
<p>SATCHELL:</p>
<p>One of my colleagues was interested to know what your first aid</p>
<p>   skills were like?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, they weren't needed.</p>
<p>SATCHELL:</p>
<p>They weren't needed.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>They weren't needed. Fortunately and I'm, you know, it's</p>
<p>   always extraordinary, a car turned over on its side and another</p>
<p>   one smashed in and nobody was hurt, and yet you can get relatively</p>
<p>   minor bumps and people can sustain serious injury. It just shows</p>
<p>   how unpredictable life is.</p>
<p>SATCHELL:</p>
<p>Always shakes you up a bit, though, doesn't it?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Oh, anything does, that's true but fortunately...</p>
<p>SATCHELL:</p>
<p>This one's okay.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>...there was no blood spilt and that's terrific.</p>
<p>SATCHELL:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, I had the privilege this morning, I must say, of</p>
<p>   speaking to Colin Cooper, who was the Commander of the Cessnock</p>
<p>   that the ship got away from, the Indonesian fishing ship got away</p>
<p>   from. It's quite interesting because he did everything according</p>
<p>   to the guidelines that he could do, short of blasting it out of</p>
<p>   the water, and he said: ÂThat's really all I can do now,</p>
<p>   I just have to hand it back to the politicians,' and I suppose</p>
<p>   ultimately that means hand it back to you?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I can understand that and like all of these incidents you have</p>
<p>   to assess what happens against the rules that apply and what can</p>
<p>   and can't be done. I don't have, I will naturally get</p>
<p>   a report on precisely what happened and some advice on whether there</p>
<p>   should be any changed procedures. You will understand that it is</p>
<p>   no light thing to engage in hostilities in a situation like this</p>
<p>   and I will naturally be talking to the Defence Minister and my other</p>
<p>   colleagues about it.</p>
<p>SATCHELL:</p>
<p>What would you say to the Indonesians though, in terms of what</p>
<p>   they should do to keep their own ships out because clearly you can't</p>
<p>   shoot them out of the water, can you?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, of course, I don't mean we...that would be seen as a</p>
<p>   hostile act. Well, we would say, certainly, and we will be conveying</p>
<p>   as we have in the past our concern about this activity, and they,</p>
<p>   I guess in the past have responded to the effect, well they don't</p>
<p>   approve of it and they deplore it and they don't want it to</p>
<p>   happen. But, no country can be held ultimately, perhaps, well, can't</p>
<p>   be regarded as being able to control it, let me put it that way,</p>
<p>   the activities of all of its nationals. It might in some way be</p>
<p>   held accountable for it but we can't control or be responsible</p>
<p>   directly for the misbehaviour of some Australians in other circumstances</p>
<p>   and I guess that applies to other countries. But, it's just</p>
<p>   one of those difficult issues where we have a clear national interest</p>
<p>   in curtailing this activity. There are limits to what we can do</p>
<p>   consistent with our friendly relations with other countries when</p>
<p>   we are dealing with the nationals of those countries that are violating</p>
<p>   our legitimate interest.</p>
<p>SATCHELL:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, with the news, and it is very positive news I would</p>
<p>   have to say from the Government on Australia Post, keeping it pretty</p>
<p>   much...in spite of the advice that you received from the competition</p>
<p>   people but, to keep things very much in place, particularly in the</p>
<p>   country. Is that in effect Pauline Hanson and One Nation starting</p>
<p>   to bite a bit?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, it's just a sensible decision. It's got nothing to</p>
<p>   do with Pauline Hanson. We've got to stop looking at decisions</p>
<p>   of the Government in the context of Pauline Hanson. I mean, we were</p>
<p>   going to take that sort of balanced decision anyway. We have had</p>
<p>   a long standing policy that Australia Post should remain in public</p>
<p>   ownership. We in fact have reversed the closure of post offices</p>
<p>   in the country. There were a lot of post offices closed in the country</p>
<p>   under the Labor Government and we've reversed that and that</p>
<p>   process started long before Pauline Hanson formed One Nation. It's</p>
<p>   got nothing to do with her, it's just got everything to do</p>
<p>   with having a balance in policy making. We are a reformist Government,</p>
<p>   but we don't believe in change for its own sake. We believe</p>
<p>   in change where there is a public benefit. We support the sale of</p>
<p>   Telstra because it will help halve Australia's Federal Government</p>
<p>   debt and the interest saving on that debt can be spent on roads</p>
<p>   and schools and hospitals.</p>
<p>SATCHELL:</p>
<p>But the, interestingly Rob Borbidge in Queensland is saying really,</p>
<p>   you are just playing into their hands. He's in fact taking</p>
<p>   them seriously and saying that you are playing into their hands</p>
<p>   by not, by trying to sell it.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I haven't heard what Rob Borbidge has said but leaving</p>
<p>   that aside....</p>
<p>SATCHELL:</p>
<p>Well, what he actually said was that Richard Alston's determination</p>
<p>   to sell all of Telstra shows that he's not listening to the</p>
<p>   message from the voters.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, you've got to remember, Phillip, that the Queensland</p>
<p>   election was about the State Government, it wasn't about the</p>
<p>   Federal Government and the response that I have is that what you've</p>
<p>   got to do is always take decisions in the interests of Australia.</p>
<p>   If you believe that something is good for Australia, is for Australia's</p>
<p>   benefit, then you do it. If you don't think it's in Australia's</p>
<p>   interest, then you don't do it. If you take decisions based</p>
<p>   on how it will be seen in reaction to another political party, you'll</p>
<p>   end up making some very bad policy decisions. I think the worst</p>
<p>   thing that any Government could do in current circumstances is to</p>
<p>   say now, I've got a decision I've got to take, how will</p>
<p>   that be seen in the light of what another political party thinks?</p>
<p>   I think the Australian public would regard a Government with contempt</p>
<p>   if it did that. I think what the public wants us to do is to listen</p>
<p>   to them, make up our minds as to what we believe is the best for</p>
<p>   Australia and then go ahead and do it and I honestly believe that</p>
<p>   if we sell the whole of Telstra, we will be able to use about $40</p>
<p>   billion as the proceeds and that will cut in half the total Federal</p>
<p>   Government debt of Australia. We'll have all of the interest</p>
<p>   saved on that $40 billion and that can be spent in some years into</p>
<p>   the future. It can be spent on roads and health and education and</p>
<p>   all the things that the Government is required to support.</p>
<p>SATCHELL:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, we understand there's been a breakdown in</p>
<p>   the negotiations with the Northern Land Council over the rail corridor</p>
<p>   from the Alice Springs to Darwin. Is this, you're obviously</p>
<p>   going to have to come into this presumably?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, we guaranteed that we would act if agreement could not be</p>
<p>   achieved and that was part of the commitment that I gave to Mr Olsen</p>
<p>   and Mr Stone. Mr Stone came to see me in Sydney last weekend to</p>
<p>   give me details of what had happened and he's since written</p>
<p>   to me requesting that legislation be introduced. I'm getting</p>
<p>   advice on that and I'll be responding to him next week. I did</p>
<p>   tell him that we would honour in full the commitment we made to</p>
<p>   South Australia and the Northern Territory. Obviously if there could</p>
<p>   be an agreement reached with the Land Council and the Northern Territory</p>
<p>   Government, that would be good. But, if it can't be reached</p>
<p>   then obviously we will have to step in and do what we can because</p>
<p>   we are determined to see that railway go ahead. We are not only</p>
<p>   willing to provide money, we are also willing to provide legislative</p>
<p>   backing. We're not seeking to have the indigenous councils</p>
<p>   treated unfairly, but apparently, according to Mr Stone, some unreasonable</p>
<p>   demands have been made and he feels that the negotiations have reached</p>
<p>   a point where some intervention will be necessary, but it will be</p>
<p>   on fair terms and proper grounds.</p>
<p>SATCHELL:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, just one other thing. The Centrelink question,</p>
<p>   we've picked up that there is just a tremendous load on the</p>
<p>   telephone system. In fact, the director was telling us that it is</p>
<p>   a million calls a day that they're getting and it's exponential</p>
<p>   growth. Again, are you going to have to in fact help them in some</p>
<p>   way?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, we'll do that if it is necessary. It's an interesting</p>
<p>   thing that there's been such an increase. I think the Centrelink</p>
<p>   concept has worked extraordinarily well. People now see it as the</p>
<p>   one focal point for getting assistance....</p>
<p>SATCHELL:</p>
<p>But, you can't get through to them....</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>....information. Well, if there's a problem, we'll obviously</p>
<p>   fix it.</p>
<p>SATCHELL:</p>
<p>I mean it is a terrible problem and it is just growing, just people</p>
<p>   just can't get there.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>If there is a significant problem then we'll obviously fix</p>
<p>   it. I'll talk to the Minister for Social Security who's</p>
<p>   responsible for....(inaudible) ...about that.</p>
<p>SATCHELL:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, can I just ask you one other thing and that's,</p>
<p>   I've often wondered whether you've ever regretted cancelling</p>
<p>   Pauline Hanson's preselection?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, I haven't. Well, that was the decision that was taken</p>
<p>   by the Party organisation in Queensland. I was consulted about the</p>
<p>   decision.</p>
<p>SATCHELL:</p>
<p>None of this would have happened though.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, that is the equivalent of saying that principle doesn't</p>
<p>   count, isn't it?</p>
<p>SATCHELL: </p>
<p>Prime Minister thank you for taking the time to talk to us this</p>
<p>   morning.</p>
