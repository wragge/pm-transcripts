    <content><![CDATA[<p>E&amp;OE .........................................................................................</p>
<p>  It is a real pleasure for me to be here in Nambucca to</p>
<p> make the closing speech of a week long visit to different parts of regional</p>
<p> Australia.</p>
<p>  And it is an opportunity to say very quickly to you that</p>
<p> during that week, I have had reinforced some views that I had when I started,</p>
<p> I've learnt some new things, I've got some better understandings</p>
<p> and most importantly of all, I have had the opportunity of talking directly</p>
<p> to literally hundreds, indeed into the thousands of people from different</p>
<p> parts of regional Australia.</p>
<p>  Of course, this is by no means the first or the last</p>
<p> time that I will make such an investment of time in the regions of Australia.</p>
<p> And I've done it very deliberately because I am aware that although</p>
<p> at a national economic level Australia is performing stronger and better</p>
<p> than it has for twenty-five years and that's a fact : our rate of</p>
<p> economic growth, our levels of business investment, our levels of inflation,</p>
<p> our levels of interest rates are stronger and better than they've</p>
<p> been for a long time. We are seen around the world as one of the strong</p>
<p> economies, not only of our region, but of the industrialised world. And</p>
<p> that condition nationally is a result of necessary economic reforms that</p>
<p> have been carried out, particularly in recent years.</p>
<p>  But, having said that I am aware that not every part</p>
<p> of the country is sharing in a reasonable way the national economic prosperity.</p>
<p> I am very conscious that in some areas of regional Australia, particularly</p>
<p> in some of the smaller communities that have relied very heavily on commodities</p>
<p> that are traditionally part of Australian primary production, there is</p>
<p> a lot of economic difficulty and economic pain.</p>
<p>  I am very conscious that the unemployment levels vary.</p>
<p> Unemployment is virtually ceased to be a major challenge in significant</p>
<p> parts of Sydney and some of the other metropolitan centres. But I know</p>
<p> it remains a problem in regional Australia, although it is lower in regional</p>
<p> Australia than what it was four years ago, and we should keep our perspective.</p>
<p>  So I've learnt a great deal about those things in</p>
<p> more detail. I've learnt of the strength and the resilience of rural</p>
<p> communities. I've learnt of the commitment of regional Australia</p>
<p> to tackling the problems of relations between Aboriginal Australia and</p>
<p> the rest of the Australian community in an open community based way. I've</p>
<p> sought on all occasions not to meet with special interest groups, but</p>
<p> rather to meet with the community as a whole.</p>
<p>  And this is a magnificent gathering of the community</p>
<p> of this part of the north coast of New South Wales. I've been inspired</p>
<p> by the willingness of different groups in the Australian community in</p>
<p> the regions to co-operate together to tackle problems. I think it is important</p>
<p> as we acknowledge the difficulties of many people in the regions of Australia</p>
<p> and their special needs. I think it is also important to remember that</p>
<p> there are some good news stories in the regions. It is not all gloom,</p>
<p> it is not all despair, it is not all high unemployment. There are many</p>
<p> areas of regional Australia that are doing well.</p>
<p>  Mention has been made of taxation reform. We are committed</p>
<p> to taxation reform because we believe that when it's introduced it</p>
<p> will strengthen the Australian economy. It will strengthen regional economies.</p>
<p> To start with it will lead to cheaper fuel than you would otherwise have</p>
<p> because of the significant reduction in the fuel excise on diesel. It</p>
<p> will lead to cheaper fuel than you would otherwise have because we are</p>
<p> going to cut the excise on diesel by a significant amount for non-metropolitan</p>
<p> Australia. And that is something that is going only to non-metropolitan</p>
<p> Australia. That is not going to be available in Sydney. It's not</p>
<p> going to be available in Melbourne. It's going to be available only</p>
<p> in non-metropolitan Australia. And that is an illustration of one of the</p>
<p> benefits specifically for regional Australia of our taxation plan.</p>
<p>  It is very easy to look at taxation reform simply as</p>
<p> the goods and services tax. It is easy to mount an argument in isolation</p>
<p> against the application of the goods and services tax to one particular</p>
<p> item. But what you've got to do is to look at the aggregate impact.</p>
<p> You've got to remember that our tax plan involves reductions of $12</p>
<p> billion in personal income tax. It will result in 80% of Australian taxpayers,</p>
<p> those earning less than $50,000 a year being on a top marginal rate of</p>
<p> not more than 30% on any slice of their income. It carries with it increases</p>
<p> of 4% on the 1st of July in all pensions and other benefits</p>
<p> to cover in advance the price effects of the GST. And the real value of</p>
<p> that will be related to future increases in average earnings, so that</p>
<p> the value of the compensation is not eroded over time.</p>
<p>  There is the abolition of provisional tax which will</p>
<p> be of great benefit to retired people, particularly in the regions. There</p>
<p> is special compensation for the savings of pensioners and self-funded</p>
<p> retirees, also of importance to retired people in the region. We're</p>
<p> totally abolishing the wholesale sales tax. We're getting rid of</p>
<p> the financial institutions duty. Over time we'll get rid of the bank</p>
<p> accounts debits tax and also a range of stamp duties that are levied by</p>
<p> the states.</p>
<p>  In other words, it is an aggregate package. We're</p>
<p> cutting the capital gains tax in half which will be of great benefit to</p>
<p> small business men and women. We're cutting the company tax rate</p>
<p> from 36 to 30% which will be of benefit to businesses. And we're</p>
<p> introducing a simplified approach to the accounting of small businesses.</p>
<p> We're having special provisions to quarantine any adverse impacts</p>
<p> on primary producers. So there is a lot more to the tax reform package</p>
<p> than just a goods and services tax, although that is an integral part</p>
<p> of it.</p>
<p>  And the reason that I've campaigned very strongly</p>
<p> for this, and the reason why we are going ahead to implement the legislation</p>
<p> is that we believe that it will be beneficial for our community and for</p>
<p> our country. I know that there are implementation challenges, and I know</p>
<p> that people need assistance and advice and explanations in relation to</p>
<p> those challenges. And that will be provided by the Government and by the</p>
<p> Taxation Office over the weeks and the months ahead.</p>
<p>  Ladies and gentlemen I am very conscious of the importance</p>
<p> of government services in regional Australia. And I have made it plain</p>
<p> that I do not wish to see any further withdrawal of Commonwealth Government</p>
<p> services in the regions. It's very important in our federal system</p>
<p> that each level of government be accountable for its own responsibilities.</p>
<p> I will answer for the services of the Commonwealth Government and you</p>
<p> will be entitled to hold me accountable and my government accountable</p>
<p> in relation to that. And equally I will expect you to hold Mr Carr and</p>
<p> his government accountable for the services for which they have responsibility</p>
<p> and also of course there are responsibilities at a local government level.</p>
<p>  A reference has been made to revenue sharing. I might</p>
<p> point out that one of the benefits of taxation reform is that every dollar</p>
<p> coming out of the GST will go to the states, every last dollar, all of</p>
<p> it will go to the states. And in the years ahead, because of that as the</p>
<p> revenue from the GST builds up the states will have more funds to provide</p>
<p> the basic services, government schools, hospitals, police services and</p>
<p> so forth. For years the premiers of Australia of all political persuasions</p>
<p> have pleaded for a growth tax. They've begged the federal government</p>
<p> to give them access to growth revenue. Now they have it courtesy of the</p>
<p> goods and services tax. And it represents a major break through in Commonwealth/State</p>
<p> financial relations.</p>
<p>  Ladies and gentlemen, the greatest thing about being</p>
<p> Prime Minister of Australia is the opportunity it gives you every day</p>
<p> to meet the men and women of Australia from all sections of our community</p>
<p> engaged in all occupations and all pursuits. I never tire of doing that.</p>
<p> I have found the last week immensely rewarding and stimulating because</p>
<p> it's enabled me to meet the men and women of Australia of all ages</p>
<p> in all parts of regional Australia.</p>
<p>  Regional Australia is made up of a lot of elements. The</p>
<p> bush as we colloquially call it usually refers to the more remote parts</p>
<p> of Australia, but it helps to define our identity as Australians and,</p>
<p> it is absolutely irreplaceable as part of our understanding of what it</p>
<p> means to be an Australian.</p>
<p>  The coastal communities of Australia have a distinctive</p>
<p> character of their own. They have a great lifestyle, they have a great</p>
<p> sense of community, they have a great commitment to their future. And</p>
<p> they have a great capacity to solve problems at a community level. They</p>
<p> do have challenges that people living in the city don't have. And</p>
<p> part of the journey that I've undertaken over the last week is to</p>
<p> gain a better understanding of that.</p>
<p>  I thank you most warmly for the welcome that you've</p>
<p> extended to me today and I look forward to talking to you over the next</p>
<p> few minutes over morning tea. Thank you so much.</p>
