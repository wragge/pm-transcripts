Joint Communique issued at the conclusion of the visit by the Prime<br />
Minister of Australia to the USSR on 16 January 1975<br />
At the invitation of the Soviet Government the<br />
Prime Minister of Australia, the Hon. E. G.<br />
Whitlam, paid an official visit to the USSR from<br />
12to 16 January 1975.<br />
During his stay in the Soviet Union Mr Whitlam<br />
and his party visited Moscow and Leningrad.<br />
They had an opportunity to see how the Soviet<br />
people live and work, as well as to acquaint<br />
themselves with their achievements in the fields<br />
of economics, science, education and culture.<br />
The Prime Minister of Australia laid wreaths at<br />
the Tomb of the Unknown Solider in Moscow<br />
and at the Piskarovskoye Memorial Cemetery in<br />
Leningrad.<br />
The Prime Minister and his party were everywhere<br />
accorded a warm welcome and generous<br />
hospitality.<br />
The Prime Minister of Australia, E. G. Whitlam,<br />
was received by the Chairman of the Presidium<br />
of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, N. V. Podgorny.<br />
In the talks which took place between the<br />
Chairman of the Soviet of Ministers of the<br />
USSR, A. N. Kosygin, the First Deputy Chairman<br />
of the Soviet of Ministers, K. T. Mazurov<br />
and the Prime Minister of Australia, E. G.<br />
Whitlam, there took part:<br />
On the Soviet side-the First Deputy Minister<br />
of Foreign Affairs of the USSR, V. V. Kuznetsov;<br />
the First Deputy Minister of Foreign<br />
Trade of the USSR, M. R. Kuzmin; and other<br />
officials. On the Australian side-the Special Minister<br />
of State, the Hon. L. F. Bowen; the Ambassador<br />
of Australia to the USSR, Sir<br />
James Plimsoll; the Secretary of the Department<br />
of Minerals and Energy, Sir Lenox<br />
Hewitt; the Secretary of the Department of<br />
Overseas Trade, Mr D. H. McKay; the<br />
Deputy Secretary of the Department of<br />
Foreign Affairs, Mr R. A. Woolcott; and the Deputy Secretary of the Department of the<br />
Prime Minister and Cabinet, Mr G. J. Yeend.<br />
During the talks which were held in a businesslike<br />
atmosphere and in a spirit of mutual understanding,<br />
the parties had a constructive<br />
exchange of opinions on major international<br />
issues of mutual interest as well as on matters<br />
concerning Soviet-Australian relations and the<br />
prospects of their development.<br />
Both sides noted that the positions of the Soviet<br />
Union and Australia coincided or were close on<br />
a number of important international problems.<br />
They noted the significant developments which<br />
had taken place in recent years towards<br />
strengthening international peace and cooperation<br />
and consolidating the spirit of detente<br />
in international relations.<br />
Both sides agreed to make every effort to ensure<br />
that relaxation of tension spread to all regions of<br />
the world and that the steady progress towards<br />
detente became irreversible.<br />
Both parties noted the importance of the agreements<br />
and arrangements concluded between<br />
the USSR and the USA, directed at the further<br />
improvement of the international climate and,<br />
above all, the importance of the agreements on<br />
the prevention of a nuclear war and the limitation<br />
of strategic arms.<br />
The Soviet Union and Australia note with satisfaction<br />
the considerable advances towards<br />
strengthening security and developing peaceful<br />
co-operation in Europe and express their hope<br />
that the Conference on Security and Cooperation<br />
in Europe will be successfully<br />
concluded in the near future.<br />
The Soviet Union and Australia attach great<br />
importance to strengthening peace and stability<br />
in Asia and expressed their determination to<br />
contribute in every possible way to relaxing<br />
tensions further, to ensuring security and to<br />
creating conditions for making Asia a continent </p>
<p>extent of your interests. Such power, such<br />
interests, bring with them great responsibilities.<br />
Australia looks to the superpowers to maintain<br />
the utmost mutual restraint in their relations<br />
with each other and towards other nations. On<br />
such restraint peace and progress ultimately<br />
depend. We look to you for responsible leadership<br />
and action to meet the urgent global problems<br />
of human need and suffering. Thus we<br />
hope, for example, that the Soviet Union and<br />
the United States will co-operate in an adequate<br />
international system of grain reserves to<br />
alleviate the uncertainties and shortages of<br />
supplies in world food resources.<br />
The other great area of responsibility which<br />
attaches to the great powers is the nuclear arms<br />
race and the increasing risk of the proliferation<br />
of nuclear weapons. I expressed Australia's<br />
deep concern on these vital issues, and outlined<br />
some positive steps which the international<br />
community could take to meet these challenges,<br />
in my address to the last session of the<br />
United Nations General Assembly. Statements<br />
by many other leaders reflected the same grave<br />
apprehensions and concern. My Government<br />
has declared its commitment to practical and<br />
effective international disarmament measures.<br />
We have ratified the Non-Proliferation Treaty<br />
and subsequently concluded the Mandatory<br />
Safeguards Agreement with the International<br />
Atomic Energy Agency. Yet we observe some<br />
flagging of international concern over the<br />
consequences of nuclear proliferation. We are<br />
disappointed by the lack of universal support in<br />
our own and other regions for the Non-<br />
Proliferation Treaty, which we consider the<br />
essential foundation for a safer world. Perhaps<br />
we have lived in the shadow of mutual destruction<br />
for so long that we have become accustomed<br />
to it. Can we dare to be complacent about<br />
our very survival?<br />
Since raising our concern for these issues at the<br />
United Nations I have visited each of the three<br />
depository powers of the Non-Proliferation<br />
Treaty. In Washington three months ago, in<br />
London in December, and now here in Moscow.<br />
I have made the same point. We look to the depository<br />
states to maintain international interest<br />
in the Non-Proliferation Treaty and to promote<br />
and enlarge its membership. In this year of the<br />
NPT Review Conference we see a special opportunity to revitalise the commitments undertaken<br />
in this treaty, to strengthen the basis of<br />
peace and awaken us from the nightmare of a<br />
world in which nuclear weapons are widespread.<br />
I was glad to note that in the historic<br />
Vladivostok communique of 24 November,<br />
Comrade Brezhnev and President Ford stressed<br />
the importance of increasing the effectiveness<br />
of the Treaty. We therefore look confidently to<br />
the Soviet Union for constructive leadership on<br />
this issue, not only by virtue of your special position<br />
in relation to the Treaty, but because of<br />
your important role as Co-Chairman of the Conference<br />
of the Committee on Disarmament.<br />
Mr President, I have spoken frankly on matters<br />
of great consequence to us all. Nothing less<br />
would have been appropriate to the dignity of<br />
this unique occasion. Nothing less would adequately<br />
have reflected the true nature of our<br />
relations. These relations are now-though unhappily<br />
they have not always been-characterised<br />
by greater frankness, by greater realism,<br />
by greater seriousness, by greater understanding.<br />
My visit will serve to strengthen this understanding<br />
and bring our peoples much closer<br />
together. For example, I shall be signing agreements<br />
between the Soviet Union and Australia<br />
on science and technology and on cultural<br />
exchanges. We have much to learn from you in<br />
the scientific and technical fields, you I hope<br />
may have something to learn from us. We<br />
warmly welcome the prospect of a Cultural<br />
Agreement between us. Australians deeply<br />
respect and admire the culture of the Soviet<br />
people-the glorious fruits of which I have seen<br />
and heard at first hand during my present visit<br />
to the Soviet Union.<br />
In these and other ways we shall develop the<br />
range of contacts between us. A world in which<br />
states, regardless of their different social systems,<br />
can communicate their views ano<br />
interests clearly and confidently is a world more<br />
amenable to peaceful change and peaceable<br />
policies. I regard the relations between our<br />
countries as a constructive element in the creation<br />
of such a world. I regard my visit to your<br />
country, and the warm hospitality you have extended<br />
to me and my party, as an important<br />
contribution to the strengthening of friendship<br />
between the Soviet and Australian peoples. </p>
<p>of peace through the co-operative efforts of the<br />
states of the region.-<br />
Both sides emphasised the necessity of strict<br />
observance by all parties of the Paris Agreement<br />
on ending the war and restoring peace in Viet-<br />
Nam. They welcomed concrete measures to<br />
implement the Agreement on restoring peace<br />
and achieving national accord in Laos and<br />
expressed themselves in favour of a just settlement<br />
of the Cambodian problem with full consideration<br />
of the national interests and legitimate<br />
rights of the people of Cambodia without<br />
any outside interference.<br />
The parties noted that on the sub-continent of<br />
South Asia progress has been made in the normalisation<br />
of the situation in this region, which<br />
corresponds to the interests of consolidating<br />
peace and security, and establishing true good<br />
neigh bourliness in South Asia.<br />
Both sides expressed their readiness to participate,<br />
together with all interested states on an equal basis, in seeking a favourable solution to<br />
the problem of making the Indian Ocean an area<br />
of peace in accordance with the principals of in<br />
ternational law.<br />
In the course of the exchange of opinions on the<br />
situation in the Middle East, the parties<br />
emphasised the necessity to achieve as soon as<br />
possible a just and stable settlement in that<br />
region on the basis of the relevant resolutions of<br />
the United Nations Security Council, including<br />
realising the legitimate national rights of the<br />
Arab people of Palestine, as well as on the basis<br />
of ensuring the security and independence of all<br />
states of the region.<br />
The parties express their hope that the Geneva<br />
Peace Conference on the Middle East will<br />
resume its work as soon as possible.<br />
The Soviet Union and Australia proceed from<br />
the assumption that the cessation of the arms<br />
race, the achievement of general and complete<br />
disarmament covering both nuclear and conventional<br />
weapons, under strict and effective<br />
MrWhitlam and Mr Kosygin sign the Scientific and Cultural Agreements </p>
<p>international control, would be of paramount<br />
importance for a fundamental improvement of<br />
the international situation.<br />
They believe that the convocation of a world<br />
disarmament conference may contribute to the<br />
practical solution of the pressing problems of<br />
disarmament. Both parties reaffirmed their commitment to the<br />
Treaty on the Non -Proliferation of Nuclear<br />
Weapons and their determination to work for its<br />
effective and universal implementation.<br />
They share the opinion that it is necessary to<br />
agree as soon as possible on the full ban of all<br />
tests of nuclear weapons by all states, and also<br />
on the ban on chemical weapons.<br />
The Soviet Union and Australia attach great<br />
importance to the conclusion of a convention on<br />
the prohibition of action to influence the<br />
environment and climate for military and any<br />
other purposes incompatible with the maintenance<br />
of international security, human wellbeing<br />
and health.<br />
The parties noted that their positions on the<br />
main issues of the law of the sea were close.<br />
Considering the conference on the law of the<br />
sea to be of great importance they expressed<br />
themselves in favour of adopting constructive<br />
decisions in this field on an international basis<br />
with due regard for the interest of all states.<br />
Both sides declared their resolution to promote<br />
the increased effectiveness of the United<br />
Nations on the basis of strict observance of its<br />
Charter.<br />
They believe that the main eff orts of the United<br />
Nations must be directed to promoting the con<br />
solidation of the relaxation of international tension,<br />
to strengthening international peace and<br />
security, and to the development of fruitful cooperation<br />
among states.<br />
During the talks, questions of Soviet -Australian<br />
relations were thoroughly discussed.<br />
Both sides expressed their satisfaction with the<br />
favourable development of relations between<br />
the USSR and Australia in recent years and<br />
reaffirmed their determination to widen further<br />
mutually advantageous co-operation on the<br />
basis of the principles of peaceful co-existence, respect for sovereignty, non -interference in<br />
internal affairs, equal and mutually beneficial<br />
co-operation.<br />
The parties attach great importance to expanding<br />
contacts between state and political leaders<br />
of both countries.<br />
They underlined the usefulness of further political<br />
consultations at various levels on matters<br />
concerning both bilateral relations and international<br />
problems of mutual interest.<br />
It was agreed to continue this practice in future.<br />
The parties consider that there are favourable<br />
possibilities to increase the volume of trade and<br />
the range of goods to be exchanged in both di.-<br />
rections to mutual advantage.<br />
The two sides acknowledged the advantages<br />
which have flowed from the Trade Agreement<br />
signed in 1973.<br />
They noted particularly the part which the<br />
mixed Commission, set up under that Agreement,<br />
is playing in developing trade and economic<br />
relations between the two countries.<br />
The parties exchanged views on prospects for<br />
the development of co-operation in other fields,<br />
including agriculture, energy and mineral<br />
resources, fisheries, maritime navigation, air<br />
communications and also in the field of Antarctic<br />
and world ocean studies.<br />
During the visit, the parties signed an Agreement<br />
on scientific and technical co-operation.<br />
They noted that preliminary steps had alreedy<br />
been taken towards identifying particular areas<br />
in which co-operation would be developed<br />
under the Agreement.<br />
A series of mutual visits by scientists of both<br />
countries was already in progress.<br />
The parties also signed an Agreement on cultural<br />
co-operation between the two countries<br />
which will establish a sound foundation for<br />
further development of Soviet -Australian ties in<br />
the fields of culture, education and sports.<br />
The Soviet and Australian sides noted with sat<br />
isfaction that the talks and discussions which<br />
took place during the visit of Prime Minister<br />
Whitlamn to the Soviet Union were useful and<br />
would make a considerable contribution to the </p>
<p>I'<br />
The Prime Minister with the Mayor of Bonn. Mr Kraemer.<br />
LIN </p>
<p>further development of friendly relations between<br />
the Soviet Union and Australia.<br />
On behalf of the Australian Government, Prime<br />
Minister Whitlam invited the Chairman of the<br />
Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, Mr A.<br />
N. Kosygin, to make an official visit to Australia.<br />
The invitation was accepted with satisfaction at<br />
a time to be agreed upon. </p>
