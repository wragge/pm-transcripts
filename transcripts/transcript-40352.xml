    <content><![CDATA[<p>The attempted coup in Turkey this morning is of great concern.</p>
<p>Australia supports the democratically elected civilian Government of Turkey and calls on all parties to show respect for Turkey’s democratic institutions.</p>
<p>We urge all parties to show calm and restraint.</p>
<p>Australia has strong ties with Turkey and values our partnership in many areas, including the fight against ISIL. Turkey plays a crucial role in sheltering refugees displaced by the Syrian conflict.</p>
<p>Indelible chapters of our two nations’ foundation stories were written in the cruel battles at Gallipoli more than a century ago.</p>
<p>In November last year I discussed these and other issues directly with President Erdogan in Antalya at the G20 Summit.</p>
<p>The Foreign Minister, Julie Bishop, and I have spoken this morning with our Ambassador in Ankara, James Larsen, as well as our own agency heads. We are staying closely advised on the developing and very fluid situation.</p>
<p>Our priority is the safety of Australian citizens in Turkey. Australians in Turkey should stay indoors and avoid crowds, be vigilant, monitor media, follow the direction of local authorities and advise friends and family in Australia that they are safe.</p>
<p>If you have any concerns for the welfare of family and friends in the region, try to contact them directly.</p>
<p>If you are unable to contact them directly, you can call the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade’s 24 hour Consular Emergency Centre on 1300 555 135, or +61 2 6261 3305 (if calling from overseas).</p>
<p>Those planning to attend the Battle of Lone Pine commemorative service at Gallipoli on 6 August 2016 should monitor the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade's Smartraveller website for updates on security arrangements.</p>
