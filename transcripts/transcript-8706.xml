    <content><![CDATA[<p>PRODUCTIVE DIVERSITY IN BUSINESS CONFERENCE<br />MELBOURNE, 28 OCTOBER 1992<br />Ladies and gentlemen<br />I welcome you to this conference on Productive Diversity.<br />It is a timely and important event which may well be seen<br />as a turning point in the way we regard multicultural<br />Australia. in the past decade and a half Australia's policies of<br />cultural pluralism have been among the most innovative<br />and creative in the world. They have also been the<br />hallmark of a decent and far-sighted society.<br />In a world very often afflicted by ethnic and cultural<br />tension, bitterness and bloodshed, Australia stands among<br />those few countries which actually relish their<br />diversity. under the umbrella of an overall commitment to the nation<br />and its uniting values and institutions, a society of<br />great richness and variety and remarkable harmony has<br />evolved here.<br />It has been In part the product of policy, and in part, I<br />think, the product of democratic and egalitarian values<br />which have always run deep in Australia.<br />This is something of which Australians can be very proud.<br />it should give us confidence.<br />If this conference should mark a turning point it will<br />not be in the nature of a break with the past, but rather<br />a Significant Change of emphasis.<br />It is a matter of building on achievements and creating a<br />new multicultural agenda.-<br />There have been three distinct phases In Australia's<br />post-war response to its immigrants.</p>
<p>The first phase was characterised by an expectation that<br />immigrants would fit into the dominant Anglo-Australian<br />culture. The second was characterised by the encouragement of<br />tolerance and respect for diversity, and the effort to<br />ensure access and equity regardless of ethnic origin,<br />And this effort will continue.<br />But we now have the beginnings of a third phase.<br />We now nmust take advantage of the potentially huge<br />national economic asset which multiculturalism<br />represents. That is what Productive Diversity is about. It is the<br />harvest on the crop sown and nurtured by our immigration<br />and multicultural policies.<br />The inspiration for this Conference is the perception<br />that two things must be brought together:*<br />the need for a still more competitive and<br />d4vereified economy with a strong export base and<br />the cultural affinities Australians have with<br />virtually all the countries with whom we want to do<br />business.<br />These affinities might be likened to having<br />representatives in the field who, through their<br />understanding of our customers' culture, language and<br />preferences, can increase our competitive edge.<br />To give you some examples:<br />At a time when the prospect is for increased<br />economic opportunities in Vietnam we have in this<br />country sixty thousand speakers of Vietnamese.<br />At a time when the triangle of southern China, Hong<br />Kong and Taiwan is achieving staggering economic<br />growth rates, we have in this country one hundred<br />and seventy two thousand Australians to whom the<br />Chinese culture and language are a given, not<br />something which needs to be learned.<br />At a time when Australian industry aspires to pick<br />up contracts in Eastern Europe and the Middle East,<br />we have in this country eighty two thousand<br />Australians whose origins were there.<br />And we have a market in Australia whose diversity is<br />a virtual microcosm of the world into which we<br />trade.</p>
<p>The inspiration for this Conference is the realisation<br />that we must as a nation find ways to capitalise on these<br />assets.<br />How can we use our diverse cultural knowledge and<br />language skills to penetrate overseas markets and boost<br />Australian exports?<br />How can companies reach Australia's diverse domestic<br />markets and increase profits at home?<br />How can we better manage the diversity of Australian<br />workplaces and improve our productivity?<br />Australia is a country of extraordinary achievements and<br />equally extraordinary potential.<br />In no small measure, this is because we are a country of<br />immigrants. It takes imagination, ambition and courage to emigrate to<br />a new land.<br />And in my view, it is precisely these qualities that have<br />contributed to our past achievements, and will enable us<br />to use our potential to the full In the future.<br />During my recent visit to Asia, I stressed our country's<br />capacity and willingness to change.<br />I said there, as I have said in various forums in<br />Australia the proof of our capacity to change is in the<br />change we have already made.<br />We now see ourselves very differently, and we are<br />starting to be seen differently by others.<br />And we are different.<br />Australia has opened up, both culturally and<br />economically. We have realised that our future depends on making<br />ourselves relevant to the rest of the world, and<br />especially relevant to the most dynamic region of the<br />world which sits at our front door the Asia-Pacific.<br />If only to take advantage of this great opportunity, the<br />development of an export culture is a national priority<br />for Australia.<br />The change is already well underway.<br />Australian export earnings have reached record levels,<br />despite subdued world trading conditions and depressed<br />commodity prices.</p>
<p>T2EL8: . Oct. 92 17: 26 No. 035 P. 04/ 1<br />4<br />Our export volumes have risen strongly in the nine<br />m~ onths ended March 1992 they were over 10 per cent above<br />year earlier levels.<br />The extent to which our economy relies on trade has risen<br />by around 50 per cent since the early 1980s exports now<br />account for over one fifth of our total output.<br />There are various steps we must take to build on this<br />success.<br />We need a more informed and aggressive national attitude<br />to exporting.<br />We must better educate and train our workforce.<br />And, most critically perhaps, we must use all the<br />resources at our disposal one of which is our cultural<br />and linguistic diversity.<br />Changes in our markets tell us this.<br />In the 1950s, only one quarter of our exports were sold<br />to non-English speaking countries. Today, over three<br />quarters of our trade is with non-English speaking<br />countries. Moreover, our fastest growing major markets over the past<br />four years have all been in non-English speaking<br />countries principally, but by no means only, in Asia.<br />In the next decade income levels in Asia will rise<br />dramatically. The potential market for Australians goods<br />will grow in direct proportion.<br />The challenge for Australian business is to develop<br />export and international business plans that take account<br />of these new markets.<br />We are dealing with countries which are very different.<br />But they are not " foreign" to all Australians.<br />Indeed, for every country which constitutes a potential<br />market for Australian companies, there are Australians<br />who know their way around.<br />The key to gaining better access to all markets is<br />knowledge knowledge of their cultures and languages, of<br />their business practices and networks, and of their<br />political and legal systems.<br />in an address to the National Conference on Arabic last<br />year, the Deputy Director of the National Farmers'<br />Federation, Mr Phillip Eliason, pointed out that we do<br />not necessarily enjoy a great advantage because we speak<br />the language of international business.<br />TEL:</p>
<p>Advantage often lies, he said, with the country or<br />language group whose communications are difficult to<br />penetrate. Our-Asian Australian communities, through their own<br />small-business networks, are making considerable progress<br />in opening up new avenues of trade and consolidating<br />commercial links with all parts of the Asia-Pacific<br />region. A recent study of Australian entrepreneurs from Chinese<br />and Indian backgrounds has shown how personal networks<br />are crucial in building export markets.<br />This is not confined to Asia.<br />The Middle East is a significant export market for<br />Australia. It has also been a significant source of<br />migrants. The same applies to Eastern Europe, as well as the<br />traditional markets of Western Europe.<br />Today, well over 20 per cent of Australians were born in<br />another country. Mure than half of them came to<br />Australia from non-English speaking countries In Europe,<br />the middle East, Asia and South America.<br />Combined with their Australian-born children, they<br />constitute 40 per cent of our population.<br />Such diversity in human resources Is rare by any<br />standards.<br />The advantages of such diversity are not confined to<br />" ethnic" businesses. All Australi~ an businesses have easy<br />access to it. All Australian businesses can profit from<br />this specialised knowledge.<br />Australian firms can draw upon the wealth of language and<br />cultural skills that resides in their own workforce, or<br />they can draw upon them by forging partnerships between<br />" mainstream" and " ethnic" businesses.<br />The Government, through the Office of MultIcultural<br />Affgair shas been piloting and exploring 8 number of<br />initiatives which illustrate these possibilities.<br />For example: In conjunction with New South Wales TAFE, a pilot<br />program to train exporters of primary products in<br />selling to Asian and MIddle-Eastern countries.<br />A proposal to create from ethnic chambers of<br />commerce and other agencies a supportive national<br />network for small and medium sized businesses.</p>
<p>A pilot program to place overseas-trained<br />professionals into Australian businesses.<br />Sponsoring a consultancy group which provides<br />cultural, linguistic and market expertise to<br />companies.<br />The opportunities go beyond exports. They concern<br />productivity and efficiency.<br />A study of migrant skills undertaken I-n 1989 showed that<br />some Australian employers fail to understand or discount<br />the value of training acquired overseas.<br />It fur Lher showed that employers tend to perceive<br />immigrants from non-English speaking backgrounds as<br />identical, whether or not they have skills.<br />Through the National office of Overseas Skills<br />RecQnition, the Government 18 attempting to stem this<br />waste of talent.<br />of course, there is a significant issue of 800181 justice<br />involved here, as well.<br />But rational self-interest alone dictates that we try to<br />liberate resources locked away.<br />And, in the interests of both fairness and economic<br />efficiency, the Government is taking further measures to<br />assist those job seekers whose lack of functional English<br />is impeding their employment prospects.<br />As part of the Employment Package, an additional<br />million has been allocated over the next three years so<br />that all registered job seekers without functional<br />English can be referred to English as Second Language<br />classes. This will assist approximately 48,000 job<br />seekers.<br />Central to the Government's micro-economic reform agenda<br />and to our national prosperity is the determination<br />to revolutionise vocational training based on key<br />competencies. Australians from Non English Speaking Backgrounds and the<br />value of the languages they speak cannot be ignored in<br />this process.<br />This conference will hear of work to identify and<br />document the practical methods some companies have<br />employed to make the most of competencies in languages<br />other than English, or to work around language barriers,<br />or to communicate cross-culturally.<br />It is not just the opening up of overseas markets that<br />can enhance our economic future. There are also markets<br />on the home front.</p>
<p>Ethnic niche markets in suburbs where 70 per cent of the<br />population speak languages other than English at home.<br />The National Australia Ban-k has put in special efforts to<br />reach ethnic niche markets.<br />Indeed NAB has sponsored an ethnic small business award<br />scheme and I look forward to speaking to the award<br />cer-emony tonight in Sydney, via satellite.<br />Telecom Australia, for example, recently commissioned a<br />study of the needs of Its clients from non-English<br />speaking backgrounds.<br />The study will also identify any cultural or linguistic<br />barriers to telephone use among this client group.<br />Telecom already advertises on SBS television, and I<br />believe that the motivation for this study combines two<br />aspects of the Government's multicultural policies<br />social justice and economic growth.<br />In fact the Government has itself seen the need to<br />understand its domestic market better. Through the<br />Office of Multicultural Affairs we've set up a network of<br />more than 600 people who are experts in communicating<br />with ethnic communities and groups.<br />The network was developed in response to the Government's<br />need to identify the views of individuals or groups when<br />planning policies and services.<br />It acts as a channel for the views of those Australians<br />who for reasons of language, culture or geography have<br />been overlooked in the past.<br />Tonight I am pleased to announce that, subject to<br />ensuring that the public interest is not compromised in<br />any particular case, this network will be made available<br />to the business sector on a commercial basis to test<br />products, services and advertising for local niche<br />markets and potential excport markets.<br />Managing a culturally diverse workforce may not be<br />perceived as a challenge by managers and business owners,<br />many of whom think that their workforce is able to speakc<br />and communicate adequately in English.<br />But a number of studies have shown that there are<br />producL. Lvity costs in not paying attention to<br />communication issues, And some companies have seen that<br />it is shrewd to invest in English language training<br />themselves.</p>
<p>We are also exploring the option of contributing, along<br />with business and community partners, to a scholarship<br />scheme for Australians with language and cultural skills<br />to develop international management and marketing skills<br />at the University of Sydney Graduate School of Business.<br />This would complement Austrade's existing business<br />fellowship scheme for Asia.<br />I said before that the Government itself is not exempt<br />from the need to make better use of Australia's<br />multicultural skills.<br />We need to ensure that; key agencies providing economic<br />and trade advice and support to business the Department<br />of Industry, Trade and Commerce, the department of<br />Foreign Affairs and Trade, as well as Austrade also tap<br />into these skills.<br />On the face of it, the evidence suggests that Government<br />could do better. for the public service is<br />dispropoxrtionately of English-speaking background.<br />So as another practical step, I'm asking the Public<br />Service Commission and relevant agency heads to look<br />closely at what special efforts can be made to ensure<br />that we recruit people from culturally diverse<br />backgrounds and utilise their particular skills.<br />We are a nation rich not only in natural resources, but<br />in human resources as well.<br />If we are to maximise our potential, to achieve all that<br />we are capable of achieving, we need to harness these<br />resources. In doing so, we will achieve our twin aims of economic<br />development and social justice for all Australians.<br />Tomorrow, the conference will focus on how we can best<br />use the local knowledge and language skills of our<br />diverse worktorce to penetrate foreign markets, how<br />companies can lift their profits by tapping domestic<br />niche markets, and how we can exploit our manifold<br />workplace skills to lift productivity.<br />you will be exchanging ideas and, I hope, developing<br />strategies which will do much to guarantee our economic<br />place in the world and, with it, growth and prosperity.<br />Lodies and gentlemen<br />I am very confident about the future of Australia, and<br />one of the principal reasons for my confidence is our<br />proven capacity in recent years to adapt and meet new<br />challenges.</p>
<p>9<br />This is a very determined generation of Australians. It<br />is also a very worldly and knowledgeable one.<br />This conference is a means of ensuring that for<br />Australia's sake and for theirs we do not waste their<br />ambition and skills.<br />It is, itself, another reason for confidence in our<br />future.<br />Whatever you come up with whatever you say I can<br />assure you, I'll be listening.<br />I congratulate CEDA, the Office of Multicultural Affairs,<br />and all those who have contributed to this very important<br />conference and I wish you well.<br />Thank you.</p>
