    <content><![CDATA[<p>The President of Ukraine, His Excellency Mr Petro Poroshenko, will make a state visit to Australia as guest of the Commonwealth Government on 10 to 12 December.</p>
<p>Australia’s relationship with Ukraine has deepened since the tragic downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH17 over eastern Ukraine, with the loss of 38 people who called Australia home.</p>
<p>President Poroshenko’s visit provides an opportunity to build on the strong spirit of cooperation forged since the tragic events of MH17 and to discuss our shared commitment to a thorough and robust investigation and to bringing those responsible to justice.</p>
<p>It is also an opportunity for Australia to reaffirm its support for Ukraine in the face of continuing threats to its territorial integrity.</p>
<p>Australia has already provided $97.6 million to the International Monetary Fund loan package to support reforms to Ukraine’s economy, as well as $1 million of humanitarian aid through the International Committee of the Red Cross.</p>
<p>In September, I announced non-lethal assistance to Ukraine’s armed forces and the establishment of an interim Australian Embassy in Ukraine.</p>
<p>President Poroshenko will visit Melbourne, Canberra and Sydney.</p>
<p>I look forward to welcoming him.</p>
<p>10 December 2014</p>
