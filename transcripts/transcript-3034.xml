6 4 PRIME MINISTER'S PRESS CONFERENCE<br />
PARLIAMENT HOUSE, CANBERRA,<br />
TUESDAY, 9TH OCTOBER, 1973<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Thanks. Are there any questions?<br />
QUESTION: If the referendum on price control on December 6 is<br />
carried, can you tell us what precise steps you intend to take<br />
in an effort to control prices. You have mentioned that you<br />
would intend to bring down a Land Stabilisation Act in<br />
Parliament the following week but can you be specific on what<br />
other steps, and also can you give me a ditto answer if the<br />
referendum on incomes is carried?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I indicated that t he incomes referendum would<br />
enable us to have the same procedure for determining non-wage<br />
incomes as the Constitution has always provided for the<br />
determination of wages. In other words, we would extend the<br />
operation of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission to<br />
specified forms of incomes other than wages.<br />
QUESTION: You announced a series of ministerial changes in the<br />
House this morning. Could you tell us why you made each of them<br />
and whether they indicate that you are unhappy with the<br />
performances of some ministers in some portfolios?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Iwon't accept the second invitation but I<br />
will deal with the first one. The principal reasons were that we<br />
now have several ministers with experience in administration<br />
which means that some of the senior ministers are able to of fload<br />
some of their responsibilities. In particular, I will be<br />
able to give Foreign Affairs to Senator Willesee, Dr Cairns has<br />
been able to give Secondary Industry to Mr Enderby, Mr Barnard<br />
has been able to give Supply to Mr Enderby also and I think it<br />
will be announced this afternoon that Senator Murphy will be<br />
able to let Senator Cavanagh carry out the same responsibilities<br />
in the Senate as Mr Daly carries out in the House of Representatives,<br />
i. e. the determination of the business of each chamber. That<br />
means that the four senior people; myself, Mr Barnard, Dr Cairns,<br />
Senator Murphy are able to share some of their responsibilities<br />
with others. The other major reason is that by giving two<br />
departments or more departments which are due for amalgamation<br />
to the one minister we can accelerate that process of amalgamation.<br />
Already, of course, Mr Jones has both Transport and Civil<br />
Aviation and Senator Murphy has both the Attorney-General's<br />
Department and Customs and Excise. As you know, it is our<br />
intention to combine those two departments or at least to disperse<br />
several aspects of one of them. Mr Barnard now has merely<br />
Defence, Navy, Army and Air which are all to be amalgamated.<br />
into one department. Then there are two minister who each<br />
have two departments now, Mr Johnson has Works as well as Housing<br />
which he's had hitherto and Mtr Enderby has both Secondary<br />
Industry and Supply. Now that means there are five ministers<br />
who all have two or more departments and those departments will be<br />
amalgamated. </p>
<p>-2-<br />
QUESTION: I -take it that Mr Enderby will also have the AIDC<br />
as part of his Secondary Industry responsibilities?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No.<br />
QUESTION: Who will have AIDC?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Dr Cairns.<br />
QUESTION: Why? I mean it was Secondary Industry, it wasn't<br />
Overseas Trade that AIDC was connected with?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No, that's not necessarily so. AIDC is really<br />
to marshal resources in regard to trade and investment-so that<br />
they will not be as much in foreign hands as they have been up<br />
till now, so AIDC will be Dr Cairns, Minister for Overseas Trade.<br />
QUESTION: On Supply you speak of this rationalising this with<br />
Secondary Industry. Is that all of Supply?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No. I haven't gone into detail there. I have<br />
already made a statement about various aspects of Supply being<br />
allocated to different departments. So I have got nothing to<br />
add really to the statement I made on that about a month ago.<br />
Similarly, Customs and Excise will not be amalgamated with any<br />
one department as you realise. To give the two principal<br />
features; there are revenue, there are law enforcement aspects<br />
of Customs and Excise. Well they will go to different<br />
instrumentalities. QUESTION: Are you prepared to make any comment on reports<br />
that Mr Bryant gave up his portfolio only very reluctantly?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No of course not.<br />
QUESTION: Will Dr Cairns retain authority over the Industries<br />
Assistance Commission?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No, that is Prime Minister.<br />
QUESTION: The Special Minister of State. Will that department<br />
continue or will<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Yes.<br />
QUESTION: You talked about divesting yourself of additional<br />
responsibilities. Do you plan to divest yourself from<br />
responsibilities for the Arts and the Industries Commission which<br />
you have just referred to?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I have no present intention of divesting myself<br />
of either, but probably never of Arts.<br />
QUESTION: But what about tariffs?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Well that is protection in general isn't it.<br />
But certainly for some time I would be wanting to retain </p>
<p>-3-<br />
protection, i. e. the Industries Assistance Commission because<br />
there has to be somebody to co-ordinate the various aspects<br />
which will now come to the Industries Assistance Commission<br />
from various departments; Secondary Industry, Customs and<br />
Excise, Primary Industry.<br />
QUESTION: The reasons you gave earlier, sir, don't seem to<br />
cover the reason why Mr Bryant<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I have twice refused to answer any specific<br />
questions like that.<br />
QUESTION: Well you did agree to outline the reasons for the<br />
changes? PRIME MINISTER: I have given the general reasons. I do not<br />
comment on individuals.<br />
QUESTION: You said earlier that you wouldn't make any changes<br />
until after the Senate elections and the question is why have<br />
you? PRIME MINISTER: Did I?<br />
COMMENT: Yes, at a press conference.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Did I. I don't remember having said so.<br />
QUESTION: Well could you give a particular reason why you felt<br />
it was necessary to make the changes now and not say wait until<br />
after Christmas or during the Christmas recess.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: The two reasons I have already given. There are<br />
now several ministers who can take responsibilities which at<br />
the time we became a government, 10 months ago, there was a more<br />
limited number of ministers able to discharge. Secondly, I<br />
want to accelerate the progress of amalgamating some of these<br />
departments. QUESTION: What part did Dr Coombs play in any of the reshuffling?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Well, none.<br />
QUESTION: Like Mr Bryant he didn't have anything to say to you?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Dr Coombs had nothing to do with this.<br />
QUESTION: Did he advise<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Certainly not.<br />
QUESTION: Will you now go overseas next year, I think it's<br />
South East Asia and to the European countries?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Of course, I will be making no fewer trips than<br />
hitherto. </p>
<p>-4-<br />
QUESTION: You have made some tentative approaches to attempt<br />
to resolve the power dispute in New South Wales which is basically<br />
within the New South Wales competence. What steps are you taking<br />
to resolve the airport dispute which is more closely within your<br />
competence? PRIME MINISTER: I expect the Public Service Arbitrator will.<br />
be calling the parties, including the Public Service Board, into<br />
compulsory conference this afternoon.<br />
QUESTION: On your initiative sir?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I was aware.<br />
QUESTION: When, if at all, are you going to recognise Chile?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Thursday.<br />
QUESTION: Do you expect that Thursday's Premiers' Conference<br />
will discuss anything other than Loan Council representation<br />
for local government?<br />
PRIM4E MINISTER: The Conference is being called as was forecastas<br />
was announced by me at the Constitutional Convention five<br />
weeks ago to discuss the participation of local government in<br />
the Loan Council. You know, of course, that the Labor Party's<br />
program since the 1971 Federal Conference has provided that local.<br />
government in each State should have a voice and a vote on the<br />
Loan Council. You will remember that I emphasised this in the<br />
policy speech last November. You will remember also that the<br />
Australian Government insisted that local government should have<br />
delegates at the Constitutional Convention as a condition of<br />
the Australian Government itself attending the Constitutional<br />
Convention. Now it is for that purpose, the discussion of that<br />
program, that the Premiers and I are meeting in Canberra on<br />
Thursday. I doubt if we will have time to discuss other matters.<br />
If so, it would be in quite general terms. In light of the<br />
officials' report which was made about three months ago,<br />
wasn't it I have asked the Premiers to comment on the suggestions<br />
that the officials from the seven Treasuries made. Many of the<br />
Premiers have not yet commented on those suggestions. In<br />
particular, there is, I regret to say, very little activity in<br />
the stabilisation of land prices which is one of the worst<br />
inflationary aspects in Australia and which is completely within<br />
the jurisdiction of the States.<br />
QUESTION: On the subject of prices. Did Cabinet make a decision<br />
yeste! rday not to make a decision on meat?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: It did make a decision not to institute any<br />
tax on the export of meat. The Parliamentary Commiittee on Prices<br />
had by majority made such a proposal; the Calbinet is not<br />
attracted by it. </p>
<p>QUESTION: You haven't announced the decisions Cabinet took<br />
yesterday. Do you intend now to make all these announcements to<br />
Parliament first, or didn't you make. any decisions?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Well take this one here ( on meat). This is a<br />
matter from a Parliamentary committee; it's not a Government<br />
matter. The Government considered, naturally enough, the<br />
recommendation of a Parliamentary committee. Parliamentary<br />
committees are free to make recommendations as they wish.<br />
The Labor Party doesn't, and I don't, believe that any of the<br />
other parties considers what recommendations Parliamentary<br />
committees should make or that the members of each Party on a<br />
Parliamentary committee should make; so the Government considered<br />
the report of this Parliamentary committee. The Government's<br />
attitude will be reported to our party meeting tomorrow. There<br />
aren't, however, any other decisions which I would think it is<br />
appropriate to mention here. There is the membership of one<br />
of these consumer bodies, but I think Mr Morrison has given that<br />
to you already hasn't he the Interim Commission on Consumer<br />
Standards. You have got the membership of that, haven't you?<br />
We have also decided, if you want to know, to introduce<br />
legislation to enable us to ratify the Convention on the<br />
Prohibition of the Development, Production and Stockpiling of<br />
Bacteriological Biological) Weapons and Toxin Weapons and of<br />
their Destruction. We also approved a statement by the Minister<br />
for the Environment and Conservation, Dr Cass, in relation to<br />
the development and management of Australia water resources.<br />
You can get the details of that statement from Dr Cass. We have<br />
also decided to accept the amendment that the Senate made in<br />
the A. C. T. Representation Bill. I would imagine that there<br />
will-be a motion to that effect in the House today. Those<br />
would be the decisions apart from the matter that Mr Chalmers.<br />
asked about the meat.<br />
QUESTION: With respect, you didn't answer my question on what<br />
specific measures you intend to bring in if the price control<br />
referendum is carried?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: You mentioned one; the stabilisation of land<br />
prices. There is one other I have mentioned and that is that<br />
in the meantime, there is any change to the jurisdiction of the<br />
Prices Justification Tribunal obviously legislation will be<br />
brought in under the new prices power in the Constitution to<br />
validate the inquiries and the recommendations of Chat tribunal.<br />
I think that was included however in the resolution of the<br />
Federal Executive last Saturday which I drafted and which<br />
I think the Federal Secretary gave to you on<br />
Saturday, so I didn't go into it again.<br />
QUESTION: Would you see that before Christmas you could put a<br />
freeze on a whole range of foodstuffs or other items?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No, I don't see that. </p>
<p>-6-<br />
QUESTION: It seems rather odd for a Labor Government to<br />
exclude the only people they exclude from higher interest<br />
rates are people with less than $ 4000 in savings banks?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No. This has been left to the banks to<br />
administer and Mr Crean can give you the details there. I think<br />
this was announced by Mr Hayden a week ago.<br />
QUESTION: Is it correct that Senator Bishop was considered for<br />
a position in the Cabinet reshuffle?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Yes.<br />
QUESTION: Did his illness over the weekend have any effect<br />
on the final decision?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Yes, of course it did. I don't want to say<br />
any more about it at this stage until he comes out of hospital<br />
and I have been able to speak to him directly.<br />
QUESTION: Are you not embarrassed that the Federal President<br />
of your party has indicated that he will campaign against you in<br />
your referendum to gain federal control over incomes?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: If he does campaign there will be some<br />
embarrassment but I will not be deterred by it. I will support<br />
the Government's proposals. I deplore sonic of the things which<br />
are said by some people in the union movement about what use any<br />
federal government would make of the incomes power if it is<br />
given to the federal Parliament. There has been a very great<br />
deal of irresponsible extravagent talk on this subject and I<br />
will play my part in repudiating it. It is quite absurd that<br />
the only incomes in Australia that can be regulated are incomes<br />
which take the form of wages, and there have been stages, for<br />
instance, in the early 1950s when the Commonwealth Conciliation<br />
and Arbitration Court as it then was did, in effect, bring in<br />
a wage freeze under existing powers. But the statistics will<br />
show that the proportion of the gross domestic product represented<br />
by wages and salaries has gone down. It is clear, therefore,<br />
that other incomes have amounted over the last 20 years or<br />
years to an increasing percentage of the gross domestic product.<br />
In other words, there hasn't been a regulatin of other incomes<br />
non-wage incomes that there has been of wage incomes. This is<br />
quite unfair. It produces a great deal of social tension and<br />
economic distortion in the community. The Australian Parliament<br />
ought to have this power over incomes. The States have it of<br />
course, except for people covered by Commonwealth awards they don't<br />
use it. They have done nothing to produce a better balance;<br />
socially and economically in the community. It's about time for<br />
the national parliament to have that power.. </p>
<p>QUESTION: Will our Ambassador to Chile be returning to his<br />
post?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No.<br />
QUESTION: Do you intend that Mr Bryant should remain Minister<br />
for the Capital Territory for very long?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I don't want to say any more on this until I<br />
have been able to speak with Senator Bishop. I don't want<br />
Senator Bishop to be reading about things before I have been<br />
able to speak to him directly.<br />
QUESTION: On the incomes referendum. Mr Hawke has said that he<br />
expects the A. C. T. U. Executive, next Monday, to make a decision<br />
contrary to that of the Labor Party's Federal Executive, i. e.<br />
opposing the incomes referendum. If the union movement does<br />
oppose the incomes referendum, do you really expect that it<br />
will succeed?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I know how difficult it is to carry any<br />
referendum. I believe that some unions will there will be<br />
differences of opinion within the union movement there may be<br />
differences of opinion in different cities on this matter.<br />
The way some unions talk it looks as if some of them will be<br />
spending more money on trying to defeat an incomes referendum<br />
than they will in trying to carry a prices referendum. Sheer<br />
sabotage. </p>
