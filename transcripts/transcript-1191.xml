    <content><![CDATA[<p>ASSIUSATMAINACLE TTOE ~ IdNHDERP ENADE dN) T THSEC HOnUOLHST IEIRNI THTEE RAiHUISTTRRYA-LIAN<br />Statement by the Prime Minister, Sir Robert<br />Menzies in the House of Representatives on<br />November, 1965<br />The Commonwealth has adopted a new policy to assist<br />independent schools in the Australian Capital Territory and in<br />the Northern Territory to finance the construction of primary<br />and secondary school buildings and associated facilities.<br />For the last ten years, the Australian Government<br />has been helping this construction in the Australian Capital<br />Territory by paying a subsidy up to the long term bond rate<br />towards mee ing the interest charges incurred by independent<br />schools when they borrowed money for construction. This assistance<br />was first paid for construction of facilities in secondary<br />schools and, inre recently, has been paid for both primary and<br />secondary schools. In future the Government will continue to meet interest<br />charges on approved borrowings of capital, but will also repay<br />the amounts of capital borrowed for appDroved projects. Capital<br />repayments will be made by equal annuai instalments over a period<br />of twenty years. The same assistance will be extended to schools<br />in the Nrhern Territory with the exception of mission schools<br />which have special characteristics and for which special Commonwealth<br />assistance exists already.<br />The Government believes that this arrangement will<br />assist independent schools in the two Territories both by removing<br />the necessity for such schools to repay capital themselves and by<br />enabling them to borrow at reasonable rates of interest.<br />The increased assistance will aptly both to approved<br />projects constructed or begu over the next ten years and also to<br />a group of projects now under construction or on the point of<br />starting. For schools in the Australian Capital Territory and<br />the Northern Territory, the new form of assistance will replace,<br />for the future, assistance now available to provide science teaching<br />laboratories and equipment.<br />In each case where assistance is given, the Australian<br />Government will need to be satisfied that the propnsed facilities<br />are needed and will require that details such as the standards of<br />construc tion, the area of land around the school, and the borrowing<br />arrangements, be approved by it.<br />The increased assistance will not apply to projects<br />already built under the previous scheme.</p>
