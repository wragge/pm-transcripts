FOR PRESS: P. M. No. 8/ 1967<br />
AUSTRALIA DAY MESSAGE<br />
From the Prime Minister, Mr. Harold Holt<br />
Today we Australians celebrate the 179th anniversary<br />
of our founding. Ours is not a long story as the history of many other<br />
nations is counted but in that time we have evolved our distinctive<br />
national identity and character. We have been assisted to do so by our<br />
heritage of British democracy and the cultures of European civilisation.<br />
We owe much to the courage, the industry, the enterprise and the endurance<br />
of earlier generations of Australians.<br />
We are a fortunate people enjoying, in an environment<br />
that is stable, peaceful and yet stimulating, one of the world's highest<br />
living standards. We are growing both in maturity and stature.<br />
But increasingly Australians of today are finding their<br />
thoughts dwelling on the challenges, opportunities and the obligations<br />
which derive from our proximity to the teeming countries of Asia and our<br />
neighbours in the Pacific.<br />
We face our tomorrows 1' n good heart. Our rich and<br />
varied resources are being developed with skill and energy. We rank<br />
already amongst the great trading nations of the world. And so we should<br />
celebrate this national birthday with high expectation and confidence in<br />
our future and with gratitude for our past.<br />
It is a happy coincidence for me that this national day is<br />
also the first anniversary of my own government. Confirmed in strength<br />
so recently by the electorate, it will be my continuing endeavour to<br />
promote the peaceful progress of the nation with fair dealing to all.<br />
CANBERRA, January, 1967. </p>
