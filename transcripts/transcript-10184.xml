CENTENARY OF FEDERATION<br />
I amn delighted to announce the appointmnent of' eight outstanding<br />
Australians to the Centenary of Federation Council.<br />
The Council will be chaired by Mr Dick Smith. The Executive Member<br />
will be Major-General Ken Taylor AO. The other Commonwealth<br />
members will be Mr Gary " Angry" Anderson AM, Professor Geoffrey<br />
Blainey, Mrs Evonne Cawley AO, Ms Phoebe Fraser, The Most Rev.<br />
Peter Hollingworth AO and Professor Trang Thomas.<br />
They bring together a wide mix of expertise and I am grateful that they<br />
have agreed to take part in the important task of planning for the<br />
centenary. The celebration of 100 years of nationhood is a key national event for all<br />
Australians. It is a unique opportunity to take stock of our record as a<br />
nation and to refresh our sense of purpose for the next century. We should<br />
recognise our nation's successes, including the resilience of our<br />
democratic institutions, the growth of stable and prosperous communities<br />
and the great achievements by Australians in all fields of endeavour.<br />
The eight Comnuwealth appointees will contribute in different ways to<br />
the development of a programme which reflects the aspirations of the<br />
Australian people and the diversity within our community.<br />
It is important that the activities belong to the people, not to governments,<br />
and that our communities are involved as participants rather than just<br />
spectators. The Council's terms of reference will expressly require it to<br />
ensure broad community participation in its work. 02/ 12/ 96 16: 12 Pg: </p>

As part of a co-ordinated approach to centenary planning, the Council will<br />
also have representatives from each state, the Northern Territory, the ACT<br />
and the Australian Local Government Association. It will develop a<br />
national programme of activities in consultation with planning bodies in<br />
the individual states and territories, reporting regularly to the Council of<br />
Australian Governments on progress.<br />
I look forward to a co-operative effort involving all governments and the<br />
broader community.<br />
Further information on the appointees and on the Centenary of Federation<br />
Council is attached.<br />
