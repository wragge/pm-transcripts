AIRLINES<br />
Statement by the Acting Prime Minister tbe Mcvn<br />
The Acting Prime Minister, Mr. J. McEwen, said<br />
today that the judgments handed down by the High Court had<br />
established that both a Commonwealth licence and a State licence<br />
were necessary for the operation of intrastate air services.<br />
The judgments had also established that Commonwealth permits<br />
were required for the use of Commonwealth aerodromes and<br />
controlled air space. This meant that the allocation of air<br />
services within New South Wales was a matter for agreement<br />
between the Commonwealth and New South Wales Governments.<br />
Mr. McEwen said, " I have informed the Premier of<br />
New South Wales that the Commonwealth is prepared to co-operate<br />
with the New South Wales Government in a reallocation of air<br />
services which would be fair and equitable to both airlines<br />
operating within New South Wales would provide the best standard<br />
of service to the travelling public and would also result in<br />
the most economical pattern of services involving the least<br />
amount of Commonwealth subsidy." Mr. McEwen said he had<br />
suggested to Mr. Renshaw that representatives of both Governments<br />
confer as soon as practicable in order to give effect to these<br />
objectives. CANBERRA,<br />
