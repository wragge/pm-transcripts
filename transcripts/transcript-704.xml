NAM4ING OF CANBERRA.<br />
" THE DA. Y WYE CELEBRATE"<br />
Speech by the Prime Minister,, the Rt. Hon. R. G, Menzies<br />
Your Majesty7, Your Royal Highness, Your Excellencies,<br />
Ladies and Gentlemen<br />
This is, of course, a great occasion for us. This is<br />
a new city. Your Majesty, you come from an old city, a city<br />
old in history, a city in which the modern builder may still,<br />
when excavating for foundations, come across remains of Roman<br />
or Anglo-Saxon civilisation. This is a new city and its<br />
history is in the making. ' Ve wontt be able to attract the<br />
archaeologists and the historians for a long time yet, but<br />
our history is in the making and we are the people who are to<br />
play our part in making it.<br />
It isnyt so very long ago that on this very spot<br />
the Parliament House was opened. It was a year after you were<br />
born, Your Majesty, and your distinguished parents were here<br />
to open it. At that time, the population of Canberra was<br />
a few thousand. At the time of the ceremony we have just heard<br />
so vividly described, fifty years ago, the population was<br />
probably to be counted in hundreds. It is very interesting<br />
for all of us to know that of the pioneer settlers of that<br />
time, there are some well represented by their descendants<br />
in this gathering. When I first came to Canberra myself, and it seems<br />
a long time ago, the population was six thousand. The population<br />
at present is something over 607000. I am told that by 1970<br />
it will be 100,000. Statisticians, Ma'am always understana<br />
these things to perfection. And on top ol' that, the calculators<br />
of the Commission have, I believe, satisfied themselves and,<br />
indeed satisfied me that by the turn of the century in the<br />
year 1000, the population will be a quarter of a million.<br />
Now I refer to these interesting facts, Your Majesty,<br />
because 2000 is a little way ofLf a little after my own time,<br />
if I may confess it, but not after yours. I look forward, with<br />
the eye of prophesy, to the notion of my own descendants in<br />
2000 standing up and drinking your, health your health<br />
still the Queen. Z Older, but richer than ever in the love of<br />
your people. ( Applause)<br />
This for you, Ma'am, must, possess a certain family<br />
significance. Fifty years ago, when Canberra was named, as<br />
we have just been reminded, your Grandfather, the great King<br />
George V, sat on the throne. It was his lot to encounter the<br />
blasts of war and to be called upon to confront great constitutional<br />
problems which the changes wrought by the war brought<br />
into existence. And he met them with a mixture of high<br />
intelligence and genius; met them so successf'ully that the<br />
new Constitutional Monarchy emerged. I shall always think<br />
of him myself as the first great Constitutional Monarch in the<br />
modern sense. And then, your Father also had to encounter similar<br />
trials with characteristic courage and skill and he carried on<br />
aeoece pooo/ 2 </p>
<p>2<br />
these great traditions and built on them. He was the second<br />
great Constitutional Monarch in the modern sense. And you,<br />
Ma'am, have succeeded him and you are the third.<br />
The line runs strongly. This genius for monarchy<br />
has not disappeared. Indeed, the more I think about it, the<br />
more I believe that in our oim time, our own Boyal Family has<br />
managed magnificently to combine the place and dignity of the<br />
Throne with the ordinary life, the ordinary desires and needs<br />
of ordinary human beings. ( Applause)<br />
Now, of course, these great rulers over this period<br />
of time in which Canberra has been established, were not alone.<br />
There are many people here today who remember with great<br />
affection the late Queen Mary who became a tradition among<br />
her people. We all remember with a singular warmth of<br />
affection your Mother who sat on the Throne with your Father,<br />
George VI. ( Applause) And if I may say so, we have seen,<br />
fortunately for us, so much of His Royal Highness, Prince<br />
Philip, the Duke of Edinburgh, that we have really taken him<br />
to our hearts and have come to regard him as, for all good<br />
purposes, an Australian. ( Applause)<br />
I mention these matters in the presence of our<br />
Queen because I think it is right that she should know how<br />
deeply those ideas are embedded in our omw hearts and minds.<br />
We are her faithful people. We will continue to be her<br />
faithful people. On a visit of this kind, it occurred to the Government<br />
that it might be agreeable to Her Majesty if we commemorated<br />
her visit in some way that would be of interest to her and of<br />
interest to His Royal Highness. Knowing Her Majesty's great<br />
interest in education, knowing in particular His Royal Highnoss'<br />
keen interest in scientific matters and in scientific research,<br />
the Government has decided to commemorate this occasion by<br />
establishing ten post-graduate fellowships a year, to be taken<br />
up by people after the degree of Doctor and to be held in<br />
physical and biological science. And with the very kind<br />
consent of Her Majesty, these will be known, in perpetuity as<br />
they go on and go on, as the Queen Elizabeth II Fellowships.<br />
( Applause) I am also happy to tell you that Her Majesty's<br />
Government in the United Kingdom has taken a keen interest in<br />
this day and in this event. It has been considering what<br />
contribution it might make to Canberra to mark this occasion,<br />
and I think in the most imaginative fashion, the Government<br />
has, through the Prime Minister, communicated with me and has<br />
indicated that it is going to find a very substantial sum of<br />
money which will be spent at our choice, on something that will<br />
commemorate the union, the connection between the two Parliaments,<br />
going back to the old days of Westminster Hall, either by a<br />
series of fountains in front of the new Parliament House, when<br />
we get it ( I notice the President of the Senate nodded approvingly<br />
that time), or alternativoly, by establishing a tower with a<br />
chine of bells in it something, I confess, I have always<br />
wanted to see in this place. But whatever way it goes, this<br />
will be a contribution by the Government in the Old Country<br />
to the Government and Parliament and City in the New and,<br />
therefore, that again nakes it a memorable occasion. ( Applause)<br />
But, Your Majesty, having said all that, at perhaps<br />
too great length, I want to come back to my own constant theme<br />
and that is that what marks this day as the nost outstanding<br />
day, a day that we will always remember, is the fact that you<br />
are here. </p>
