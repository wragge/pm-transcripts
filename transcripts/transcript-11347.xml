    <content><![CDATA[<p>E&amp;OE....................................................................................................</p>
<p>Thank you very much, Councillor Maloney, the Mayor of Longreach. The</p>
<p> last time I was here a few of your were holding placards, but I'm</p>
<p> delighted to be back and to have such a warm and encouraging welcome.</p>
<p>You've all heard me make one speech today and I won't go</p>
<p> over any of that except to say that the Federal Cabinet from the moment</p>
<p> we took office in March of 1996 we resolved to meet on a regular basis</p>
<p> in regional and rural Australia. And when Ian Donges and Wendy Craik</p>
<p> came to see me earlier this year and said they were planning to have</p>
<p> this gathering of the National Farmers' Federation in Longreach</p>
<p> I thought it would be a marvelous conjunction of events for the Cabinet</p>
<p> and for the National Farmers' Federation to meet here at Longreach</p>
<p> at the same time.</p>
<p>We make a practice when we go to regional centres of inviting a cross</p>
<p> section of the community. It gives us an opportunity to talk to community</p>
<p> leaders, an opportunity to understand the particular concerns and</p>
<p> the particular interests of the bush and today has been no exception</p>
<p> to that.</p>
<p>As I said in my speech, although the general economic conditions in</p>
<p> this country are first class, better than they have been for thirty</p>
<p> years, we are very conscious that not every part of Australia is sharing</p>
<p> equally in that economic performance and that there are major areas</p>
<p> of this country the less populated areas in the farming and rural</p>
<p> areas of our community who are still doing it very tough, still are</p>
<p> deserving of a special understanding and of a special consideration.</p>
<p> And I'm sure that the meeting taking place here in Longreach</p>
<p> will drive home to all the delegates to the National Farmers'</p>
<p> Federation that their ongoing responsibilities that they have discharged</p>
<p> so well over a long period of time to represent the interests of rural</p>
<p> Australia.</p>
<p>It is a special part of being a Prime Minister of being a member of</p>
<p> a Federal Cabinet, to go around this vast country of ours and to meet</p>
<p> so many different people in very different circumstances and to be</p>
<p> reminded of the essential character of the Australian people. To be</p>
<p> reminded that we are people who draw a lot of our nourishment from</p>
<p> the volunteer spirit within our communities. It's particularly</p>
<p> so in the bush, people work together they help each other, they care</p>
<p> for each other, they understand each other's problems. And one</p>
<p> of the many characteristics of Australians are that they do help each</p>
<p> other very well in adversity and they do it instinctively and they</p>
<p> do it without regard to somebody's origins or background or whatever.</p>
<p> Some have even presumed to call that mateship. And I think it does</p>
<p> encapsulate extremely well of what this country is about. We do have</p>
<p> some special characteristics as Australians. Part of being an Australian</p>
<p> is either to live in the bush or to feel that the bush is part of</p>
<p> what we are and to me it has always been inconceivable that you could</p>
<p> think of Australia without thinking of our rural heritage. And I am</p>
<p> very conscious as somebody who was born and raised in the suburbs</p>
<p> of Sydney, I am very conscious of the fact that rural Australia still</p>
<p> contributes 25% of our export income. The bush still, that agriculture</p>
<p> produces one quarter of our annual national wealth, that it employs</p>
<p> over four hundred thousand people that it has within its ranks some</p>
<p> of the most efficient farmers in the world. And one of the constant</p>
<p> agonies of being an Australian farmer is that you don't get enough</p>
<p> reward for your efficiency because you are shut out of corrupt world</p>
<p> markets by larger primary producing countries who have the economic</p>
<p> and political clout to do that. But as a government we remain committed</p>
<p> to improving that. As a government we are delighted to be here.</p>
<p>We thank the people of Longreach, we thank you, Councillor Maloney,</p>
<p> once again for your warm welcome, this is the second time that you</p>
<p> have welcomed me to Longreach. I hope to have the privilege of coming</p>
<p> back again, it's a very special regional centre of Queensland</p>
<p> and all of us here today have been in receipt of the typical warm,</p>
<p> open hospitality of the Queensland people and we thank you most sincerely</p>
<p> for that.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
