    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Rudd Government today announced it will fund two studies to assist the Northern Territory with the expansion of Darwin's East Arm Port.</p>
<p>This announcement follows Chief Minister Paul Henderson's far-sighted announcement today to fund a significant expansion of Darwin port's facilities</p>
<p>The Australian Government will fund two separate studies associated with this long term investment in Northern Territory economic infrastructure.</p>
<p>The âAll Tide Access' study will assess the needs of Darwin's East Arm Port to ensure âall tide' access for LNG, Panamax size and larger vessels.</p>
<p>The âTechnical and Financial Feasibility' Study will assess the feasibility of increasing the Port of Darwin bulk export capacity from Panamax to larger vessels.</p>
<p>The Federal Government will invest $3.2 million to fund these studies to help ensure that one of Australia's fastest growing regions is able to meet its future infrastructure needs.</p>
<p>The Northern Territory Government has lodged a detailed submission with Infrastructure Australia seeking a Commonwealth contribution to the cost of the port expansion.</p>
<p>Infrastructure Australia will look at the future needs of the Northern Territory, including the further expansion of the Port of Darwin, as it develops a national priority list for infrastructure investment to be completed early next year.</p>
<p>As part of its strategy to invest in Australia's long term economic prosperity, the Rudd Government established Infrastructure Australia, a national body tasked with developing a long term blueprint for fixing and modernising the nation's infrastructure.</p>
<p>The Federal Government had allocated an initial $20 billion to its Building Australia Fund, money which in the years to come will be used to build critical economic infrastructure such as roads, rail, ports and broadband.</p>
<p>The expanding resource and mining sectors in the Northern Territory are placing increasing pressure on the Port of Darwin.</p>
<p>This announcement today demonstrates the Northern Territory Government's commitment to building the economic prosperity of northern Australia.</p>
<p>It is important that we start work now to increase the capacity of the port to enable it to manage the increasing throughput as demand for Territory's mining and energy resources grows.</p>
