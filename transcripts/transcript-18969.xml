<p>PM: Today we stand by the people of America on their day of loss and grief.</p>
<p>Today is a truly shocking day for Americans.</p>
<p>Twenty children have died; a number of adults have died. </p>
<p>This is a day that is breaking America's heart and has brought the American President to tears.</p>
<p>As Prime Minister I get to visit a lot of primary schools, and they're places of hope and joy and excitement, young kids going about their day, learning, being with their mates.</p>
<p>It is almost beyond comprehension such a happy place could be reduced to a place of death and terror, but that is what we have seen today.</p>
<p>Our heartfelt sympathies go to those families who have lost a child, to those families who have lost a loved one, to those families who are now trying to counsel their young child who has been witness to such shocking scenes and will be so distressed as a result.</p>
<p>Alongside the loss of children, we've seen the loss of some very brave teachers.</p>
<p>It's a time to remind ourselves just how precious a thing it is that so many people devote their lives to the care of children and even in the most extreme circumstances think about the children in their care first.</p>
<p>They are some very brave Americans, and we know we are home too to some very great teachers.</p>
<p>This is a very difficult day. It's a day on which Australians will be thinking of our friends in America and sharing their grief and their sense of loss.</p>
