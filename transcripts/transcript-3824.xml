PRIME MINISTER' S PRESS COINFERENCE, CANBERRA,<br />
July 1975<br />
I should make it clear that I do not intend to respond<br />
to any questions or speculation about the Budget to be brought<br />
down on 19 August.* I-have take n that attitude in 1973 1974<br />
that is normal practice. Nevertheless, it will help you if I<br />
say something about the Government's general approach to the<br />
Budget in the context of our present economic situation.<br />
The forthcoming Budget will be the result of fuller<br />
preparation and consultation than any Budget before it. This<br />
process of consultation and preparation has-been going on for<br />
months. It is a process that involves, not just the Cabinet<br />
and our officials, but many outside groups and interests. The<br />
Economic Committee of the Parliamentary party met yes terday to<br />
discuss the broad terms of our economic policy, with " ir. H~ en,<br />
the Treasurer. The Government's consultations with outside<br />
groups are more extensive this year than they have ever been,<br />
They will conclude with a meeting with A. C. T. U. representatives<br />
tomorrow morning. In addition, the Government itself has set<br />
up new procedures to develop its budgetary strategy. We<br />
established earlier this year you remember, the Expenditures<br />
Review Committee of Cabinet, backed by a committee of officials<br />
who have been wotrking for the last two months.<br />
I want to emphasise that I regard this as a major<br />
innovation in budgeting procedures and one with which I am<br />
very satisfied. The committee of officials is chaired by an<br />
officer of my department and includes officials from the<br />
Treasury and the Departments of Social Security, Labour and<br />
Immigkration ana" Urban and Regional Development. The Cabinet<br />
committee, which is under my chairmanship, has proved very<br />
useful in scrut~ ising the proposals of individual ministers<br />
and looking at hr. ad economic policy. The officials' committee<br />
has produced two vdery full reports on the whol&amp; range of<br />
iGovernment exze-ditures. Ministers will be considering these<br />
reports and debaJ-ting the Budget in general all next week.<br />
As kzn ow, the Government since coming to office has<br />
made many innovatLions and introduced many social policies and<br />
programs that were long overdue. We saw that a lot of things<br />
had to be done, and our task was made more urgent, and more<br />
costly, by the-fact that nearly all these areas had been<br />
neglected for so long by our predecessors. That is why<br />
Government expenditures rose so rapidly in the past two years.<br />
In addition, It was necessary to push expenditures ahead at a<br />
time when unemployment was high and the economy was in recession.<br />
But we also recognised that it would be necessary to review<br />
Government expenditures as the economy recovere<br />
That is what we are doing. In April tifis year I wrote<br />
to all ministers telling them to prepare for c ~ tbacks in<br />
expenditure and draw up their own programs fok cutbacks. </p>
<p>2.<br />
We instructed the officials' committee to examine<br />
thoroughly all on-going programs and new proposals and to<br />
identify the options open to us for reducing expenditures<br />
in the Budget. They have done so in the two reports I have<br />
mentioned. The basic fact is that the industrial western nations<br />
are now starting to climb out of the deepest recession experienced<br />
since the second world war. This recession has not been confined<br />
to Australia; it is not a local affair. Every major country<br />
in the industrialised world has been going through a recession<br />
over the last 12 to 18 months and in most of them the severity<br />
of the recession has been much greater than it has been in<br />
Australia. For instance, in the United States, by far the biggest<br />
economy in the world, industrial production during the recession<br />
has declined by about 14 percent compared with 8 percent in<br />
Australia and gross domestic product is running nearly 8<br />
percent below its level in the last quarter of 1973 in the<br />
United States, compared with a fall of 3 percent in Australia.<br />
Unemployment in the United States has passed the 8 percent<br />
mark. In Australia it is 4.5 percent.<br />
In Japan the decline in production was of the order<br />
of 20 percent. Real gross domestic product fell by about<br />
1 percent. Zn the European Economic Community there appears<br />
to have been a ein in production of about 6 percent over<br />
the last year. : eai gross domestic product of these countries<br />
increased by on-y 1.3 percent in 1974 following a 5.6 percent<br />
growth in 1972. C_-auunity-wide unemployment has risen from<br />
2.7 million to 4.2 million over the past 12 months.<br />
Not only is the recession not confined to Australia:<br />
there are grounds far arguing that it had world-wide origins.<br />
0-r experience has zeen part of the total experience of the<br />
ilu. strialised wor-i-There are, however, grounds for optimism.<br />
T-e latest indicatfins are that the recession is ending in the<br />
United States, Ja= an and Western Eurpoe. And there are<br />
indications tha. it is ending in Australia. </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER: Are there any questions?<br />
QUESTION: I refer to your letter that you mentioned you<br />
sent to Mr Berinson and other Ministers about their staff.<br />
Why have you zecided to ask Ministers to give you such<br />
detailed infor.. ation about their personal staff, and isn't<br />
this task already undertaken by the Australian Security<br />
Intelligence Organisation?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: The Australian Security Intelligence<br />
Organisation doesn't concern itself with aspects other than<br />
security. Itdoesn't concern itself, for instance, with<br />
any business activities, or personal connections of that<br />
character,, which Ministers' secretaries may undertake.<br />
Quite clearly it is necessary to insure that Ministers'<br />
staffs do not do anything which Ministers themselves<br />
are not allowed to do, or not expected to do. I gave<br />
Sevidence on this matter before Mr Riordan's committee<br />
concerning the pecuniary interests of members of the<br />
Parliament. I said that people whom the ministers<br />
appointed should have to make the same declarations,<br />
their interests should be registered, in the same way<br />
O as I advocated, and as the Labor party advocates in its<br />
platform, should be the case with ministers. Now it's<br />
quite clear that ministers'staffs ought to be under the<br />
same, they should operate under the same standards, as<br />
ministers themselves, and I propose to ensure that from now<br />
on this is t-he case.<br />
QUESTION: Who do you expect will be enforcing these<br />
standards? Will it be yourself, Sir? To what use will<br />
this information be put? Will it come to you and will you<br />
O then vet Ministeri-al staffs? The second question, quite<br />
different. Do y: ui hope that in the near future to be<br />
making an announcement about the new Governor of the Reserve<br />
B ank? MINISTER: The second one: yes. The first one, I<br />
have to be informed by ministers of the persons that they<br />
propose to appoint to their staffs. As I say, I need to know<br />
the previous enoio-ment history, the academic attain ments,<br />
and the famil -v noersonal connections of any proposed<br />
appointments. I, in my view, the appointements are not<br />
suitable, then of course, the persons concerned will not<br />
be appointed. I would imagine, however, that discussion<br />
with the minister concerned will see that appropriate<br />
people are appointed.<br />
QUESTION: Have you been happy in the past with the A. S. I. O.<br />
checks on ministerial staff, particularly since December<br />
1972, and is it true that since December 1972 full checks<br />
have only been carried out by A. S. I. O. on two ministerial<br />
staffs? PRIME MINISTER: No, I believe that there have been A. S. I. O.<br />
checks on the staffs of all ministers who would have any </p>
<p>2.<br />
in<br />
connection with matters/ which A. S. I. O. was concerned.<br />
Not only them, but on most ministers. This question<br />
arose several times early in 1973 and answers were given<br />
in those cases. I have no reason to believe that A. S. I. O.<br />
checks were . r adequate. The matters of dissatisfaction<br />
which have clearly emerged would not come within the<br />
sphere of A. S. I. O.<br />
QUESTION: You've prevented witnesses, public service witnesses<br />
under your control, from testifying before the Senate.<br />
You've offered no alternative inquiry into the loans<br />
affair. In the normal procedures of the Parliament you<br />
haven't offered the documents that the -Opposition has<br />
required. And I ask, what are you hiding, how long<br />
can it be hidden, and in particular, is there any truth at<br />
all in the letter that was written by Professor Colin<br />
Howard to the Age, who . was at the time, as is still,<br />
an adviser to the Attorney-General, that the Government's<br />
design was to avoid, was to arrange a method by which it could<br />
get around the Senate's rejection of Supply?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: The Government is hiding nothing. I didn't<br />
read through Professor Colin Howard's letter to the Age,<br />
I don't know if he is . i. adviser to the present Attorn,-y-General.<br />
Nevertheless, I stated in the Parliament last Wednesd. Ay<br />
that there was no bypassing of Loan Council procedures.<br />
I was asked a question about this late in March, I think,<br />
late in May, and I gave an answer. And the answer was correct,<br />
and it hasn't zeen challenged. The matter arose at the<br />
last meeting of the I n Council and nobody demurred at the Loan...<br />
QUESTION: I'm referring to the rejection of Supply, Prime<br />
Minister, not the Loan Council. Professor Howard's<br />
suggestion...<br />
S PRIME MINISTER: Oh, well look, if you don't mind, I think<br />
it was two colur:-sthe letter, so I didn't really read it<br />
through. I thougah you said Loan Council. I didn't read<br />
Professor Howard's letter, and I don't think it's satisfactory<br />
for you to ask -e to comment on your summary of it. The<br />
Government is : zncealing nothing, the Government has<br />
responded to v-erything that the Opposition has asked in the<br />
proper way. Than is, by questions to ministers or motions<br />
concerning ministers. It is the normal procedure for the<br />
Crown to plead privilege in the matters which are in the<br />
Senate summons. The Senate summons concerned the, a meeting<br />
of the Executive Council and matters prior and subsequent<br />
to that meeting. Quite obviously they are privileged. Any<br />
Government would claim privilege for them. You might as well<br />
say that if a witness was called from a newspaper, if an<br />
editor of a newspaper was called-and no Crown. privilege could<br />
be pleaded in respect of a journalist or a newspaper editorthe<br />
journalist or the editor would certainly plead privileges<br />
as to the sources of his information. Are you then to say<br />
that you're hiding something?<br />
QUESTION: Well, you would be hiding something, Prime Minister... </p>
<p>3.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: But the fact is that privilege has<br />
always been claimed, and properly claimed for proceedings<br />
of the Executive Council. That's what the Senate summons<br />
mentioned. That, and that alone. They called public<br />
servants alone. You don't politicise the public<br />
service in this jay. Privilege is something which is<br />
claimed by many people in the Courts or, in the exceptional<br />
circumstances of them being summonedbefore a Parliament.<br />
A journalist pleads privilege as often as not when he's<br />
called as a witness. A doctor pleads privilege similarly;<br />
a lawyer pleads privilege. It is the normal thing, and<br />
it is the proper way in which these things are conducted.<br />
It's been recognised for centuries.<br />
QUESTION: Today Senator Withers, in the Senate, gave notice<br />
that the Senate would affirm its right to summon<br />
the people before it. ( Unclear). This runs in the face of the<br />
Idirections the ministers have given to the permanent heads...<br />
PRIME MINISTER: With respect, it does not.<br />
QUESTION: Well, my answer is, Prime Minister...<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Well, I thought you were wanting an answer<br />
from me...<br />
QUESTION: Well t do you propose to do if the Senate<br />
summons, brings. a permanent head before it, asks a question,<br />
doesn't get an aannds wtehre n decides that he's in breach<br />
of Senate privilege?<br />
PRIM MINISTER: be the day when the Senate presumes<br />
to iorison a pub-Servant for obeying instructions.<br />
QU: STCN: Would v-ol: care to explain the difference between<br />
public servants givinz evidence to Estimates Committees<br />
in the Senate, a5 niic servants giving evidence to the<br />
Senate as a con--ee of the whole?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No public servant has ever been asked by a<br />
Senate com-mittee to give evidence concerning, say, a meeting<br />
of the Executive Council or the proceedings prior or<br />
subsequent to a meeting of the Executive Council. The Senate<br />
has accepted, furthermore, that public servants do not discuss 1<br />
at Senate committee meetings matters of policy, the advice<br />
given to ministers, and so on. Or the discussions between<br />
ministers or the discussions between departments on advice<br />
to ministers. The Senate committees have accepted this<br />
principle. It's all set out in the book of the Senate Clerk<br />
on these matters. / 4 </p>
<p>4.<br />
QUESTION: Has the traditional approach been for public<br />
servants to claim Crown privilege on matters of Government<br />
policy, and not on matters of fact?&gt; Have you now received'<br />
new advice th,-public servants are able to claim Crown<br />
privilege on z=.-tters of fact,. as distinct from Government<br />
policy? PRI14E MINIST.-: R: No public servant has ever been summoned<br />
before the Senate before. The only person who's ever<br />
appeared to give evidence before the Senate before was<br />
the Governor of the Reserve Bank. It may be, I don't<br />
assert it to be the case, it may be, that people like the<br />
Auditor-General or the Governor of the Reserve Bank,<br />
might he able to give evidence. The Auditor-General.<br />
of course, is obliged to advise the Parliament. The<br />
Solicitor-General may possibly be asked to advise, as long<br />
as it doesn't cut across opinions which he's given<br />
to the Governmnent. As long as it's not upon subjects;<br />
the evidence sought from him doesn't touch upon advice7<br />
which he has given to the Government. But public<br />
servants have never previously been summoned before the<br />
Senate, and nor have they been, say, in Britain. The<br />
nearest parallel to this was in 1951 when a Senate<br />
committee requested the Chiefs of the Armed Forces<br />
to appear before it, and the Acting Prime Minister at the<br />
time, Mr Fadden, as he still was, conveyed to the Chairman<br />
of the SenatI--e committee which made the request that they<br />
would not be attending.<br />
QUESTION: M~ r Thomas. fron, tho Age, Sir, if the Government<br />
is concealing nothing about the loans<br />
OPRIME MINISTER: Mr'doubting'Thomas </p>
<p>QUESTION: Could you explain which New York and London based<br />
companies the Government intended to buy back with part of its<br />
$ 4,000 million borrowings. And how did the Government intend<br />
to breach the gap between the 8.35 cost of the borrowings and<br />
the dividend yield of major resources companies here of about<br />
3 or 4 per cent?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: This was all discussed last Wednesday No<br />
I know I didn't and I don't propose to now.<br />
QUESTION: In the likely event that the Senate decides that<br />
the Senate will decide what is privilege-"-. hat evidence<br />
is privileged and not the Government.-Wnat is your reaction to<br />
that? If the Senate tomorrow says that this evidence of<br />
Fred Wheeler/ is, in fact, not t-rue?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Well I expect that the Senate will accept the<br />
advice of Senator Greenwood when he was Attorney-General and<br />
Mr Ellicott ; hen he was Solicitor-General. That is they will<br />
treat the cerwiicates of the Ministers as conclusive.<br />
QUESTION: And i Eney don't?<br />
P?: 2z MINISTER: seli in that case if the Public Servants obey<br />
S their instructions, they would technically be in contempt of the<br />
Senate maybe. T dn't believe the Senate would so resolve and<br />
if it didit's not likely to send them to Goulburn Gaol.<br />
QUESTION: Can't you take it to the High Court Sir. In that event<br />
would the Government try and get a ruling from the High Court on<br />
that matter?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Well, wait until they get to gaol. There may<br />
be dungeons below the Senate Chamber, I don't know. The Senate<br />
Attendants wouldhave their time cut uutguarding thenm,. keeping them<br />
chained up.<br />
QUESTION: A question in relation to ministerial staff / 6 </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER; This is the third from the Financial Review;<br />
we have had 2 from the Age, 3 from the Financial Review. Are<br />
there any other newspapers?<br />
REID: ( interjection: he's not a newspaper).<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Any other media?<br />
REID: Reid, A. C. P.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: This is not the medium; this is the message.<br />
Mr Reid.<br />
REID: In your speech in the House you revealed the oral advice<br />
given by the then Attorney-General on the loans matter to the<br />
Executive Council. Why not then reveal the advice of the<br />
Solicitor-General in the same circumstances as asked for by<br />
Mr Ellicott and other Members of the Opposition.<br />
PRIME MINIST: R: I quoted already the letter which Mr Byers the<br />
Solicitor-General, that is the second Law Officer of the Australian<br />
Crown, wrote to the President of the Senate this afternoon. He<br />
pointed out quoting Attorney-General Greenwood and<br />
Solicitor-General Ellicott, his predecessor, that the privilege<br />
of the ' Crown extends to opinions -of the Law Officers. The principle<br />
applies whether thev be written or oral and Mr Byers, the<br />
Solicitor-General, said " as one of its law officers I may not<br />
consistently with my constitutional duty intentionally act in<br />
opposition to its claim". I didn't quote the opinion of the<br />
then Attorney-General, I said we acted on his advice, his oral<br />
advice. QUESTION: In relation to staff appointments were you told last<br />
year in the presence of Sir John Bunting and several other people<br />
that a certain person who was later appointed to a Ministers staff<br />
had offered bribes in an attempt to obtain Cabinet Documents<br />
from another person connected with another Minister's staff and<br />
-was the same advice given to both Dr Cairns and the former<br />
Attorney-General, Lionel Murphy. / 7 </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER?.: I have never heard of any of this. Sir John<br />
Bunting never mentioned any such matter to me.<br />
QUESTION: I didn't suggest he did. He was present<br />
when it was suggested to you.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I don't remember any such occasion. I don't<br />
remember anybody saying such a thing to me. If you care to tell<br />
me afterwards about it, I'll -pursue it.<br />
QUESTION: I'll do that.<br />
QUESTION: Prime Minister in your speech last week you said the<br />
Attorney-General advised orally that the $ 4 billion loan could<br />
probably be legal within the terms of the financial agreement.<br />
Can you tell me have you received any written advice on this<br />
subject. If so who from? And have you got any advice that<br />
the borrowing was definitely within the terms of the financial<br />
agreement and not just probably within the terms of it?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: There was no written advice sought or received.<br />
The matter was also discussed with Mr Byers and the Secretary of<br />
the Attorney-General' s Department by me.<br />
0 = SSUION: Can v.: u tell us what advice you got from Mr Byers and<br />
. e Secretary O: fh Department as well as what you got from the<br />
2ttorney-General?<br />
PRIME MINIS__: i sought the advice from the three persons<br />
and I acted in accordance with the advice.<br />
QUESTION: Have you decided that Miss Morosi is not to be employed<br />
on any Ministerialstaffs and have you and have you issued the<br />
appropriate instructions? a<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I believe I was asked this at another Press<br />
Conference about a fortnight ago. I gather that your question is<br />
based on one of the Sydney afternoon papers. It could have been<br />
either of them I must confess. Their sense of responsibility </p>
<p>8.<br />
saying that had issued an instruction in respect of Miss Morosi.<br />
I have never m-entioned that the suitability of Miss Morosi's<br />
employment t-D any of my Ministers.<br />
QUESTION: You were quoted in some papers this morning as telling<br />
Caucus that the Auditor-General is somehow involved in<br />
some aspect of the Cairns business and the loans business. Can<br />
you tell us the involvement of the Auditor-General, what he is<br />
investigating, why<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I didn't see any report in the newspapers to this<br />
effect. I don't, what I said in Caucus yesterday was not very fully<br />
reported. For very good reason I didn't tell any of you.<br />
I didn't give a briefing and I didn't give a conference or an<br />
interview to any of you or in any of the Media on the Caucus<br />
proceedings. I don't, I'm not intending to.<br />
QUESTION: can I -clear something' up.: was the<br />
Government intending to dodge a refusal of supply by hocking<br />
what is called now our national heritage<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I saw some suggestion of this. This bright<br />
idea was never discussed. Nor, of course, having been made<br />
in one of the Fairfax papers, was it checked with any of the<br />
persons that . i-t be concerned. </p>
