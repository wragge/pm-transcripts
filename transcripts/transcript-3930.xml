    <content><![CDATA[<p>PRIME MINISTER'S WEEKLY BROADCAST</p>
<p>THE CONSTITUTIONAL CRISIS -Â SUNDAY 19 OCTOBER 1975</p>
<p>I've been astonished in recent days by theÂ flood of messages and telegrams which have come to my officeÂ in support of our stand against the latest abuse of powerÂ by the Opposition. ely have I seen such a massive andÂ spontaneous de ration of feeling on any politicalÂ issue. Aus alians have been roused to anger by theÂ actions the Opposition in the Senate in the past week.Â The position has embarked on a course which imperils<br />C e foundations of our democratic system and threatensÂ the whole nation with chaos. By refusing to pass theÂ Supply Bills they are holding up the money for essentialÂ public services. It's not just my money or their moneyÂ they're holding up it's your-money, the taxes paid byÂ every Australian for the running of the country, for theÂ defence forces, the for Medibank, for schools,Â universitieis, transport and a host of other things. WhatÂ the Opposition is saying is this: " We don't like theÂ Government. Unless it resigns, we'll stop the essentialÂ services of the Australian people. We'll bring the countryÂ to a standstill unless we get our way." In other words,Â the classic demand of the terrorist: " Surrender or we'llÂ take your money."</p>
<p>It's as simple as that. The Opposition isÂ threatening the country with chaos in a grab for political power. They are telling the Australian people that aÂ democratically elected Government, a Government with a<br />secure majority in the House of Representatives, aÂ Government elected for a three-year term, should hand overÂ power half way through its term simply because it suitsÂ the Opposition. Could any self-respecting Prime MinisterÂ yield to such tactics? What leader worth his salt wouldÂ give in to this sort of blackmail? I certainly will not.Â The Government will not. The Opposition's methods areÂ a violation of every constitutional and democraticÂ principle. If these tactics became the rule in future,Â if an Opposition could force a Government to resign wheneverÂ it suited them, Parliamentary Government would becomeÂ unworkable. It is simply not on the Opposition knows it,Â and I believe the people know it.</p>
<p>Having created this constitutional crisisÂ that threatens the whole nation with disruption, theÂ Opposition has the gall to say that it's the Government'sÂ responsibility to get rid of the crisis by surrenderingÂ its mandate. I remind you that it'Is not the G overnmentÂ which is holding up the people's money. It's not theÂ Government which is blocking the use of your-taxes.Â It's not the Government which is threatening the lifeÂ and stability of the nation. It's the Opposition in theÂ Senate. The House of Representatives has passed the supplyÂ bills. Every Labor senator has voted for them. EveryÂ Labor member of Parliament and every Labor senator willÂ go on voting for these money bills until they are Passed.Â The Opposition senators alone are holding them up.Â </p>
<p>Let's look at the Senate which is causingÂ this crisis and threatening chaos to the nation's life.Â Who are the men responsible? It's not the same SenateÂ that was elected 18 months ago. It's a stacked Senate,Â a bogus Senate or as Jim Killen, the Qt. eensland Libera has put it, a " tainted Senate". Remember this:Â Â at the elections in~ ay last year Labor candidates polledÂ 200,000 more votes than all other candidates and partiesÂ combined. We were returned with 29 senators the sameÂ number as the Liberals and the Country Party. And there wereÂ two independents. Since then the Labor senators have beenÂ reduced to 27, because two State Premiers have floutedÂ another great constitutional convention that senators shouldÂ be replaced by a man or a woman of the same party as theÂ one elected by the people. Last Wednesday's resolutionÂ to block supply would-never have been carried but for theÂ death of Senator . M4illiner of Queensland. As the IndependentÂ Senator Steele Hall put it so vividly and accurately this week:Â " Let it be remembered that the Opposition succeeded only<br />because a Labor senator died. They did it over a deadÂ man's corpse. "</p>
<p>A dead man's corpse! It's on that basisÂ that the Opposition now claims the right to subvert theÂ elected Government and bring the nation to its knees inÂ order to achieve its political goals. They say they want anÂ election. Certainly we shall have an election. If theÂ Opposition carries out its threat and finally rejects theÂ supply bills we shall have an election for the SenateÂ for the every House that has brought this crisis on the nation.Â We shall submit this tainted, stacked, vicious and irresponsibleÂ Senate to the people's judgment. It is the-Senate which isÂ blocking supply. It is the Senate which will answer to theÂ people for its actions. And when the normal time comes forÂ the G overnment to go to the people we shall do so confidentÂ that the people will endorse our record over a normalÂ three-year term.</p>
<p>What a sorry spectacle the Australian Liberaland CountryÂ Parties present to the world. How wantonly they've Â degraded our country's reputation in the eyes of other,nations, of the nations of our region, of new nations<br />like Papua New Guinea who should be looking to us now as an exampleÂ of mature and stable democracy. How recklessly they've weakened the democratic cause in every nation where democracyÂ is under challenge. Mr Fraser, byÂ this action,Â has destroyed whatever pretensions he had as a man ofÂ honour and principle. He knows it in his heart. He hasÂ succumbed to the same pressures and embarked on the sameÂ suicidal course as Mr Snedden, the Liberal leader he stabbedÂ in the back only seven months ago. The Opposition failed inÂ these tactics when Mr Snedden tried themi last year.Â They were taught a lesson by the Australian people. They mustÂ be taught that lesson again in a manner they will neverÂ forget. We shall win this battle. It won't be won by me,Â but by the united resistance, the angry defiance of theÂ whole Labor movement, the trade unions, decent parliamentarians,Â and above all by the great mass of ordinary Australians whoÂ cherish our democratic ins-tutions and will not have them Â trampled by a power-hungry Opposition anrd the vestedÂ interests who support them.<br />Â </p>
