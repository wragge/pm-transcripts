    <content><![CDATA[<p>It is with deep regret that I learned of the death of King Fahd bin Abdulaziz Al-Saud of Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p>  King Fahd will be remembered for his contribution to the development and modernisation of Saudi Arabia and his role on the international stage</p>
<p>He promoted a number of domestic reforms including the establishment of the Majlis al-Shura (Consultative Council), the establishment of Saudi Arabia's first basic law and legal codification.  He also presided over Saudi Arabia's first direct elections, the local government elections which took place earlier this year.</p>
<p>In the international field, King Fahd presided over the 1989 Taif Accords which ended the civil war in Lebanon, was a staunch participant in the international coalition to reverse Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990 and provided practical support for multinational forces in the 2003 Iraq war.  Under his leadership, Saudi Arabia has been strongly committed to ongoing efforts to combat terrorism.</p>
<p> Saudi Arabia is home to many thousands of Australian expatriates and their families, and many Australian Moslems have enjoyed Saudi hospitality in undertaking pilgrimages in Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p>I extend our condolences to King Fahd's family, including his brothers King Abdullah and Crown Prince Sultan and the people of Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p>Australia will be represented at King Fahd's funeral by the Governor General.</p>
