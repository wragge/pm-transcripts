    <content><![CDATA[<p>c{ 2~<br />TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />SPEECH AT ALP FUNDRAISING DINNER, TERRACE INTERCONTINENTAL<br />HOTEL, ADELAIDE, 7 OCTOBER 1994<br />E OE PROOF COPY<br />My Cabinet colleagues that I am pleased to have with me tonight, Leader of<br />the Opposition Mike . Rann who I am also delighted to have with us tonight,<br />John Hill, Party Secretary, and most particularly you, ladies and gentlemen,<br />thank you for joining us and being with us. It is an occasion to come to a<br />State and to focus upon its problems, and to get to understand it, perhaps<br />better than its fortunes being touched in the normal ebb and flow of events, of<br />national events, be they in Canberra or elsewhere. And no doubt, the<br />Cabinet coming here today as Nick has said has focused us up on South<br />Australia: its strengths and its weaknesses, its capacities and its needs and<br />I think that as a consequence of doing that, and as he said, getting the<br />buearacracy focussed on it as well, is a good thing for us and a good thing I<br />hope for South Australia because I think, as he said, in the next day or two,<br />some announcements will come from it. But the real value is probably, what<br />we get through gatherings such as these: an idea of what is happening in<br />South Australia, and how we can better integrate it into the mainstream of the<br />economy and society in this country. So, that is why we're pleased to be<br />here, and I'm sure and know that we will enjoy the opportunity.<br />I think that there are a lot of superlatives thrown around in public life<br />adjectives are dreamt up every day of the week but I'm quite sure that one<br />could say truthfully, almost advisedly, that this is probably going to be the<br />most exciting decade in our history. Because I don't think that there has ever<br />been a time when we are more, see ourselves more, as a nation with an<br />identity of our own, I don't think we have ever enjoyed the confidence we<br />currently enjoy about our capacity to do things in the world. We have never,<br />ever had markets the size we have, with the proximity we now have them in<br />the past our markets were always in Europe, and some in North America.<br />Now, the fastest growing part of the world is on our doorstep in Asia. We are<br />more appreciative, I think, of Australia and what we have been given of the<br />opportunity we have had than perhaps any generation has ever been. We<br />now know, because of the mobility our generation enjoys through the 747 and<br />television, we can appreciate what Australia is, and know that not all nations<br />have been endowed as we have. And it is unique. We are the only nation in<br />the world that has a continent to itself, and that big moat of the Pacific</p>
<p>2<br />around us gives us that security, that natural security, and of course the<br />temperate nature and the tolerant society we have bred here makes this I'm<br />sure, the best place in the world to live.<br />It's certainly going to be the best place to be living and doing business,<br />particularly in this part of the world. And I don't think you could have said<br />these things in the decades past. And I like to think and I was speaking to a<br />Labor audience earlier tonight saying it was a century ago you started to<br />see some of these things in the 1890' s. The parallels between the 1890' s<br />and the 1990' s are quite striking it was the period of the great drought, it<br />was the period of our deepest recession, it was a period when Australian<br />nationhood was really brought together, when the threads were bound<br />together. When the States and the nation decided to federate to cede<br />powers to a greater national government. And the social experimentation,<br />and the sense of being an Australian that developed in that decade, and went<br />on to the First World War. I mean, we have all lived with the consequences<br />of the First World War it having automatically introduced the Second. But<br />one of the great consequences sad consequences for us was it snuffed out<br />Australian nationhood, and we went back into that conservative sort of<br />cocoon. And even after the British Parliament passed the Statute of<br />Westminster and said, " look, you can actually have the place and run it<br />yourself', we said " oh, no no thank-you not quite yet". They said " we're<br />actually going to give it to you." " Oh no, no, no, we don't quite want it." And<br />we then went through the torpor what I call the Menzies years. The Rip Van<br />Winkle years, when the place culturally went to sleep, and we regarded<br />Britain as home etc. And, you know, people say there was quite a nice thing<br />on Menzies last week on 565 and they say well, you shouldn't be too hard<br />on Menzies for his time. You know, this was a view that was about that we<br />didn't assert our Australian identity we didn't assert the notion of being an<br />Australian, we didn't have that inner confidence about ourselves. We did<br />regard ourselves as a Branch Office and as some sort of derivative place.<br />Well, this may be fair political analysis, but George Washington wouldn't<br />have had a bar of it, I can assure you. And he had the jump on Menzies by<br />about 150 or 200 years, and so I don't think it necessarily follows that you<br />have got to say that but it was a state of mind. And a state of mind not only<br />that was one that tied us up, in a sense, to markets in the Northern<br />Hemisphere, as sensible as that was, and as understandable and obvious as<br />that was at the time, but it sapped our confidence in ourselves. And the<br />reassertion of Australian values and our confidence, we saw a glimpse of it<br />during the Whitlam Government, and it basically faded again, and that is why<br />I think that now, with the great changes of the 1980' s behind us the, opening<br />up of Australia, the knocking down of the tariff wall, the removal of exchange<br />controls, the free-flow of funds, the free-flow of goods, the competitive<br />culture, the Accord, the change in relative wages, the lift in the profit share,<br />the strong rates of employment growth, the development of the sophisticated<br />Social Security system all of that has put us in a position where now we can<br />actually understand that our identity and our confidence can be not simply an<br />adjunct of what we do, but a central power-house, a central powering<br />element, that pulls into it all of those changes, and uses and springs from the</p>
<p>3<br />changes that were made in the 80' s and are still being made. And that's why<br />I think that you can go back through the decades but there are none where<br />you could see Australia in the position where it can be quite as excited about<br />the prospects as now. Because here we are, opened up to the world. No<br />longer sitting behind a tariff wall. No longer sitting with double-digit inflation.<br />A competitive country where competitive breezes have been well and truly<br />flowed through the economy, where people good managers, investors,<br />people with some clever instincts can now do well because when we<br />opened up the financial markets in the 80' s, we gave a freedom to the clever<br />that was formerly, under regulation, only enjoyed by the wealthy. This is the<br />great levelling up of de-regulation it actually gives the clever a chance<br />against the wealthy who formerly were able to take more than their share of<br />the rations supply of savings that came out of this banking system of the day.<br />It is a great irony that it took a Labor Government to give Australia a market<br />economy, but it did. And that is why if there is to be the outward<br />manifestation of this change, it is as I said in the last election that is,<br />outward meaning into the growing markets of the Asia-Pacific better to have<br />the authors of the policy running the policy than the usurpers. That is why it<br />was important as Nick said to win the 1993 election. Important for Labor,<br />important for the country.<br />Now, I think that if we take stock of where we are and understand the<br />changes which have been made, a number of important ones come to mind.<br />One, I think, is education. This has been in the past Australia's great<br />comparative advantage. There is only one other country in Asia that has an<br />education system like us, and that's Japan. But in 1983, only 3 kids in<br />completed secondary school. This year it's 8 in 10, and it will soon be 9 in<br />And we are streaming 40% of those students into universities where we<br />have added 65% of places since 1985, and we are now building up the<br />Cinderella of Australian education Technical and Further Education,<br />vocational education to play the proper role it should have always played in<br />skills formation in this country. This great change which is going to power<br />product innovation and opportunity in this country is also doing one other<br />thing. And that is this massive participation rate in schools is now being<br />enjoyed by Australian young women who were not enjoying this before. In my<br />generation, young women invariably mostly didn't go on to complete<br />secondary school, and the number of university places granted to them were<br />few. Now there are more women in universities than there are young men.<br />So, this is a very liberating change as well as one which is innovating and<br />pushing the economy along. And it is, I think, playing to our real strengths<br />and our comparative advantage, which is not basically the wool we shear<br />from the sheep, or the coal we dig from the open-cut mines, or the iron-ore<br />mountains we wear down, but rather from the skills which we have, and the<br />capacity to do innovative and clever things. And we are now seeing that, and<br />we are seeing it in places like South Australia where smaller companies and<br />even larger companies are doing things of world class in a world<br />environment, and being competitive. And that is off the back of good<br />management, which is essentially powered along by innovations and<br />education.</p>
<p>4<br />Education is one of these things which gives communities a chance. We<br />have, as a party, said that we believe that Australia will be stronger if we<br />move along together that we believe in the policies of inclusion. That's a<br />word which is now dropped around the political landscape most parties say<br />it and don't mean it. We say it, and mean it. That is, that we will be stronger<br />if we are together. That is why the Government, in the course of the election<br />campaign, said we would not leave the unemployed behind that it is<br />insufferable for a society to damn around 300,000 people who through no<br />fault of their own find themselves to be long-term unemployed. And why it is<br />also an economically inefficient thing as well as an inequitable thing to allow<br />people to drop off the end of the queue and become an underclass. We are<br />too wealthy for that to happen, and when the Government decided and I had<br />the pleasure of introducing the White Paper, Working Nation, which devoted<br />a very large parcel of resources to the long-term unemployed we drew a line<br />in the sand which said we will not have an underclass. If America wants an<br />underclass, it can have one. If Britain wants an underclass, it can have one.<br />But we wont have one. And as a consequence, we are already starting to<br />see a very high proportion of long-term unemployed people taken up in the<br />labour market we have had 4% employment growth this year, over 360,000<br />jobs 75,000 of those have gone to the long-term unemployed. If we were<br />looking at comparable numbers in the 80' s, it would have been only 7 to<br />10,000 jobs that went to long-term unemployed. So these programs are<br />working they're starting to work now as a large systemic change, and the<br />other important thing from it is that we are going to need skills formation in<br />this recovery as it burbles along, there is going to be pressure in the labour<br />market, and we can't afford to have a block of people unemployed, or their<br />resources under-employed their skills under-employed. We are not going to<br />see skills formation from migration as we have done in other recoveries, and<br />that is why in this one it is important that we bring this category of people<br />along, and bring them back into the mainstream of society, So the White<br />Paper is one thing it's an equity issue, it's a social justice issue, but it is'also<br />an economic issue.<br />Another is Mabo. Now, some may say well, it doesn't affect us very much.<br />The High Court said that there is a Native Title coming from indigenous<br />custom title a native title in the common law but that the title is subordinate<br />to the Crown. That is, that the title is subordinate to issues of interest in land<br />by land managers or land ministers of the States. So in other words, a<br />freehold title extinguishes native title. And therefore, one would say, in the<br />capital cities, well, why should I worry about that? Mabo doesn't mean much<br />to me. Out in the back blocks, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders can<br />have access to land if they can establish the traditional connection with it.<br />The important thing is that the principal, perhaps defining feature of<br />Aboriginal culture, is the association that Aboriginal people have with the<br />land. And we cannot, absolutely cannot, go on saying that we are a fair<br />society, that we believe in justice, we believe in inclusion, but we don't<br />believe in inclusion for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. You<br />can't say that, and give meaning to the word inclusion. And you can't go on</p>
<p>in this part of the world holding your head up particularly in Asia saying,<br />" well, here we are, the largely European tribe who happened to inherit a<br />continent, but we're here, but our indiginies aren't. There's no equal place for<br />them". Now, Mabo was a wrong that needed to be... the whole notion of terra<br />nullius, that the continent was basically without people and without a culture,<br />was wrong and needed to be righted. And the High Court made that<br />decision, and the Government supported the High Court by putting the<br />legislative framework to give effect to the decision into place. That is, the<br />Court didn't say what the title was, how it will be dispensed etc, who should<br />have it all those mechanisms were put into place in the Mabo legislation.<br />To have not done it would have been to have denied Aboriginal people<br />justice. To have not done it would have been to hang the High Court out to<br />dry. Now we often hear our conservative opponents talking about the rule of law.<br />They are always interested in the rule of law until it affects them, and when a<br />majority on the High Court found in favour of Mabo, they sailed right into the<br />Chief Justice and all the other judges and the former position of respect that<br />the Court had was very quickly being assailed by those who basically didn't<br />believe that black people should be given land. Now, it is very hard to create<br />institutions in any country, and as you know in our constitution we established<br />the High Court in a position of some substantial pre-eminence under<br />separation of powers from the legislative branch of the government, and we<br />have seen for an 1890' s constitution in a period of telecommunications and<br />television and aviation and all these things that were not really around in<br />those days we have seen a change to the powers of the Commonwealth and<br />delineation of powers by the Commonwealth and the States through the High<br />Court. And so, therefore, I thought, and the Government thought, that the<br />High Court having made an historic and courageous decision, that we should<br />keep the institution strong, and in the doing of it, provide justice to Aboriginal<br />people. That has happened it's a very great change in our society. It's<br />another element of the inclusion that I speak of in saying that if we are to go<br />along together, it has to be together.<br />So you look at these things Mabo, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander<br />Australians, long-term unemployed these are all the sorts of things that will<br />bind Australia together. And as we grow as this recovery comes through,<br />this low-inflationary recovery we will be able to hold our head up high, and<br />we will approach the world we live in and say, " here we are as Australians,<br />we are a unique people with an identity of our own, at peace with each other<br />in a society where we will not have underclasses. Where we are as one".<br />Not everybody will have an equal distribution, an equal lump of the wealth or<br />the opportunity, but at least we will be committed truly committed to the<br />notion of equality, and with it of course, fraternity. This gives us the entry<br />ticket to play in the bigger game on the world stage, and this Government has<br />thought about that, and it has thought about how we can not only create<br />structures within Australia for Australia, but outside of Australia for<br />Australians.</p>
<p>f I<br />And this is where we have committed ourselves in international forums to<br />things like the Uruguay Round, and the GATT, in which Australia played a<br />very important role over 7 years putting the Cannes group together and<br />prosecuting the fight against the Europeans on agriculture, and other nations<br />on services and property rights etc, to get a result which will change the world<br />in terms of free trade and opportunity. Particularly now we are seeing for the<br />first time since the First World War, Russia rejoining the world economy,<br />South America rejoining the world economy and for the first time ever, India<br />joining the world economy, China joining the world economy, and providing a<br />back-drop set of rules under GATT which will allow that to happen. That is<br />one thing that this Government has been involved with, and it will mark out for<br />a trading nation like Australia huge opportunities over the longer run.<br />Another is APEC. APEC is the development of an Asia-Pacific economic<br />community. It started off as a fledgling information exchange body we have<br />now got it up to a Heads Of Government body, and its second Heads Of<br />Government meeting is in Bogor in Indonesia next month, and that will be<br />attended by the 18 leaders of the 18 member states of APEC, including of<br />course the President of the United States, the Prime Minister of Japan, the<br />President of China, the President of Indonesia of course is the Host, and all<br />of the other Heads of Governments from around the region. Why have we<br />interested ourselves in this? Basically, to see that Asia, that the big decision<br />that is going to be made in Asia in the next 5-7 years, is an Asia-Pacific<br />decision, and not an Asian decision. In other words, Asia the<br />comprehension of Asia is a Pan-Pacific view, and not simply a continental<br />Asian issue where we see largely the world developing into three blocks the<br />European Union, NAFTA travelling through Central and South America, the<br />Americans extending their dialogue with the Latins and running into South<br />America, staying at home, and China becoming the dominant central<br />economic force in an Asian economic union of some kind. It's in our interest<br />to see that the United States economically and strategically engages in Asia.<br />Now one of the ways we can do this is to open up trade and investment<br />opportunities for all the countries of the Asia-Pacific, and this will mean'that<br />the United States will not then be focussing on South America, but will be<br />focussing on the opportunities of the great growth of the Asian markets, and<br />in the doing of it, maintaining that unique strategic relationship it has with<br />Japan, and in the doing of that, keeping the strategic environment in North<br />Asia much more passive. This then becomes a very strong point for us in<br />terms of the environment in which we live.<br />As APEC goes on and we adopt a trade-liberalising agenda, we then open up<br />in our immediate neighbourhood as we get trading barriers tariff and nontariff<br />barriers down so we are doing something above the GATT. We got<br />the GATT as a back-drop, but we add to that through APEC, so APEC<br />becomes a GATT-plus outcome. Now, it is a very big issue and it's a very<br />hard thing to do, and it may take us some time. But we are in there trying,<br />and that is why President Soeharto's Chairmanship of this meeting in<br />Indonesia in November of this year is going to be so important. So there is<br />APEC.</p>
<p>The other issue is the developing of our relations with Indonesia. This is the<br />fourth largest country in the world it's just on 200 million people. It is an<br />archipelago 8 flying hours across. It has been held together by President<br />Soeharto's new order Government now for over a quarter of a century. In my<br />view, it poses no strategic threat to Australia. We pose no strategic threat to<br />it, therefore we should be friends, and that is what this Government is<br />seeking to do to develop a relationship of trust, understanding and value<br />with the Government and the people of Indonesia. This will open up<br />tremendous trading opportunities for Australia, and will develop a relationship<br />which will make us stronger, and them stronger. And then, as perhaps we<br />open up the opportunities of AFTA the ASEAN free-trade area where we<br />have a proposal to look at Australasia that's CER, the trade agreement<br />between Australia and New Zealand being part of AFTA, an extension of<br />AFTA, we would then not only see a people to people relationship with<br />Indonesia, but a trading relationship with ASEAN. ASEAN, with Australia it's<br />worth remembering that the Australian economy is about the same size of all<br />the ASEAN economies combined -that's Indonesia, Singapore, the<br />Philippines, Malaysia and Thailand -they are together just larger than<br />Australia. Put Australia and New Zealand together, and we are as large as<br />ASEAN, put the two together and it is a market of $ 1000 billion and 300<br />million people. When we make that connection, Australia's trade<br />opportunities will really blossom.<br />And that is why I say, think of any other decade where this was possible, and<br />you can't think of one. So, the structures inside Australia the opening up,<br />the great social changes like access and opportunity in education,<br />universality of access in health, age care, child care, occupational<br />superannuation for the workforce, strong rates of employment growth,<br />economic policy focussed on employment, wage restraint for economic<br />growth and employment growth via the Accord, a change to the<br />competitiveness and the competitive culture by low tariffs and the removal of<br />exchange controls, the inculcation of a competitive culture inside Australia<br />and the opportunities of that abroad, the opening up of the structures and the<br />development of the structures outside of Australia for Australia all of these<br />things are things which this Labor Party, and this Labor Government have<br />fashioned for this nation. So, when we come to South Australia and we see<br />the things we are doing here, and people say " where is South Australia's<br />place in this?" And I say, " in the centre of it". Because the culture here has<br />always been one which has been about making do, changing, adapting,<br />finding a role for itself in the country where natural opportunities haven't<br />existed that's happening today. That is happening in the innovative<br />products we are seeing from this state. We are seeing it in services, we're<br />seeing it in regions and we say, if we create the environment both<br />economically, socially and we get that right, we get that sense of<br />togetherness, that sense of inclusion right, and we are accepted as a nation<br />with a culture and an identity of our own in Asia, South Australia will have no<br />trouble at all finding its place in all that. So, when we come here and we talk<br />to you, we try to listen for those little bits of information which have their place<br />in the matrix, but the matrix is the much bigger picture of Australia's place in</p>
<p>8<br />the world. And that is why, when you hear our opponents say the republic is<br />basically a distraction, you say that's wrong the republic is central to our<br />economic fortunes. Because otherwise, you go around Asia with the Queen<br />of Great Britain the Head of State of another country as your Head of<br />State. That is, for this country, untenable. Untenable. And that is why, over<br />time, the whole question about identity, inclusion, inclusiveness, social justice<br />and social democracy rejecting the hard-hearted views of Thatcher or<br />Reagan, or the centralised economies of the old Eastern Bloc but going for<br />something new and better, a good competitive economy grafted on with an<br />equitable social policy and an enlightened foreign policy, are concurrences of<br />policy events that I don't think Australia has ever had before. This is why I<br />say, this is the most exciting decade in our nation's history, and why I think<br />South Australians should think that too. Thank you.<br />ends.</p>
