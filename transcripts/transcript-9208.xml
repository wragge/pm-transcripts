TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING, MP<br />
DOORSTOP, POWERHOUSE MUSEUM, SYDNEY<br />
3 MAY 1994<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
J: South Africa, what's your response?<br />
PM: Well, I think it is a matter of great pleasure for all of the people who<br />
believed that the policy of apartheid was wrong. It is a vindication of<br />
the long lonely struggle of people like Nelson Mandela. It is also a<br />
vindication of the leadership of President De KlerK.' My best wishes<br />
now go to the South African people, to the new Government of South<br />
Africa, for the job of consolidation which it will have to do to bring in<br />
the community and give it confidence all of its community. This is a<br />
great job of work to be done. But at least there is a new beginning for<br />
South Africa, one based on truth and justice, and the right of<br />
everybody to participate in that community, and to decide who should<br />
govern them.<br />
J: Has the Australian Government been in contact?<br />
PM: Well, I have this morning dispatched a letter of congratulations to the<br />
President-elect, Mr Mandela, and also to President De Klerk for his<br />
role in the process and the election.<br />
J: Mr Keating, on the White Paper there is some fairly disturbing images<br />
of DEET last night..<br />
PM: I think you will have to wait until the White Paper is delivered tomorrow<br />
on that.<br />
ENDS </p>
