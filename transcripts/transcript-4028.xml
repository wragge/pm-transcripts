PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR PRESS' 15 January 1976<br />
DEATH OF TUN ABDUL RAZAK<br />
, I was shocked and saddened to learn today of the death of<br />
the Prime Minister of Malaysia, Tun Abdul Razak. Australia has<br />
' lost a good and dear friend. The loss is very great. It will be<br />
sadly felt not only by the people ofMalaysia but by the people<br />
of the South East Asian region in particular and the world in<br />
general. i<br />
Tun Razak. has made a significant contribution to the development<br />
of Malaysia both domestically and internationally. He was a<br />
skilled administrator and conducted the affairs of State with<br />
. great dignity, calmness and sense of-purpose. His statesmanship<br />
and his contribution to peace and stability in South East Asia<br />
will lon be remembered by the nations of the region.<br />
He had a suStained and close contact with l1aders of Australian<br />
Government for many years. He was greatly respected by all<br />
Australians for his sense of high purpose and dedication. In<br />
his illness he was a quietly brave man.<br />
On behalf of the Australian Government and people, I express<br />
our sincere sympathy and condolence at the untimely loss<br />
sustained by the people of Malaysia.<br />
I knew Tun Razak for a very long period-of time and feel his loss<br />
personally. As a mark of respect I will be attending the funeral. </p>
