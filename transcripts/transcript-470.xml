    <content><![CDATA[<p>QUEENSLAND BEEF ROADS</p>
<p>Joint Statement by the Prime Minister ( Mr. Menzies) and the Premier of queensland ( Mr. Nicklin)</p>
<p>The Commonwealth Government has approved a proposal of the Queensland Government for the construction of five new beef roads in the State. They are</p>
<p>Georgetown  - Mt. Surprise -  Hann Highway<br />Mount Isa  - Dajarra<br />Dajarra  - Boulia<br />Winton  - Boulia<br />Quilpie  - Windorah</p>
<p>The roads will qualify for assistance under the Queensland Grant ( Beef Cattle Roads) Act 1961, as does the Julia Creek-Normanton road to which approval has already been given.</p>
<p>The Commonwealth Government has indicated that the nature and extent of the work to be carried out on each particular road is a matter for the State Government. Similarly the Commonwealth Government believes that the State Government is best qualified to determine the standards of construction and will therefore leave such decisions to the Queensland authorities.</p>
<p>CANBERRA,<br />16th February, 1962. P. M. No06</p>
