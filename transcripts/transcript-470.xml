    <content><![CDATA[<p>QUEENSLAND BEEF ROADS</p>
<p>Joint Statement by the Prime Minister ( Mr. Menzies) andÂ the Premier of queensland ( Mr. Nicklin)</p>
<p>The Commonwealth Government has approved a proposalÂ of the Queensland Government for the construction of five newÂ beef roads in the State. They are</p>
<p>Georgetown Â - Mt. Surprise - Â Hann Highway<br />Mount Isa Â - Dajarra<br />Dajarra Â - Boulia<br />Winton Â - Boulia<br />Quilpie Â - Windorah</p>
<p>The roads will qualify for assistance under theÂ Queensland Grant ( Beef Cattle Roads) Act 1961, as does theÂ Julia Creek-Normanton road to which approval has already beenÂ given.</p>
<p>The Commonwealth Government has indicated that theÂ nature and extent of the work to be carried out on eachÂ particular road is a matter for the State Government. SimilarlyÂ the Commonwealth Government believes that the State GovernmentÂ is best qualified to determine the standards of constructionÂ and will therefore leave such decisions to the QueenslandÂ authorities.</p>
<p>CANBERRA,<br />16th February, 1962. P. M. No06</p>
