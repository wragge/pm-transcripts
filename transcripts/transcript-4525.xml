. U$ TALIA Lg-<br />
FOR PRESS 27 OCTOBER 1977<br />
STATEMENT TO PARLIAMENT<br />
Mr Speaker, I wish to inform the House that the Government has<br />
recommended to His Excellency the Governor General that the<br />
House of Representatives be dissolved on 10 Novemberinext<br />
and that a general election for the members of the House of<br />
Representatives be held onSaturday, 10 December.<br />
His Excellency has accepted my recommendation.<br />
Mr Sp. eaker,.-the._. p-laces-of-one half of the members of the Senate<br />
will become vacant on 30 June next. If their places are to<br />
be filled by 1 July 1978, an election to fill them must be<br />
held no later than May.<br />
Under the second paragraph of Section 13 of the Constitution an<br />
election to fill vacant Seante places may be held within one year<br />
before the places become vacant.<br />
Members of this House were elected on 13 December 1975; its<br />
term expires on 16 February -1979. However, Section 28 of<br />
the Constitution enables the House of Representatives to be<br />
dissolved before then. It was the general practice prior to<br />
1963 to hold elections forthe House of Representatives and for<br />
half the Senate on the same date. Indeed, in 1955, the Governor-<br />
General, Sir William Slim on the advice of the then Prime Minister<br />
dissolved the House of Representatives much earlier than its<br />
three year term to synchronise the elections for the two Houses.<br />
In that case, the election for both Houses.. was held some<br />
18 months after the previous election for the House of Representative!<br />
In May this year, the Government put to the people a referendum<br />
proposal which was intended to ensure that elections for both<br />
Houses would have to be held simultaneously. The proposal was<br />
supported by all political parties in the Parliament and the<br />
arguments in favour of it were widely canvassed.<br />
It was approved by a significant majority 62 percent of all<br />
voters and by a majority of voters in three States.<br />
It is the view of the Government that at the next election for<br />
half the Senate, an election should also be held for the<br />
House of Representatives. / 12 </p>
<p>This clearly accords with the view of the majority of the<br />
Australian people as reflected in the referendum vote.<br />
Mr Speaker, it is a veiw shared by the Opposition.<br />
Indeed, in a Monday Conference interview on November 1, 1976,<br />
the Leader of the Opposition thought it would be entirely<br />
appropriate to have a combined half Senate and House of<br />
Representatives election at the ned of 1977. I quote the<br />
words he uttered almost exactly a year ago:<br />
" In a year's time, which I would think would be about the<br />
earliest that there could be an election, although<br />
quite a likely' time for the election, it would be a<br />
perfectly reasonable time to have a half Senate election<br />
and once could have the whole of the House of<br />
Representatives at the same time to synchronise the elections.<br />
Mr Speaker, if the elections are not held together it will mean<br />
that -there must. be an -: lection for half the Senate at least by<br />
May 1978, an election for the House of Repre ' sentatives before<br />
April 1979, another electiin for half the Senate before July 1981<br />
and so on.-a major Federal alection every one or two years.<br />
A situation in which a Government is constantly concerned with the<br />
holding of elections is not conducive to sound Government and<br />
hence is not in the public interest.<br />
If the elections for both Houses-are to be synchronised, the question<br />
arises as to when they should be held. In practical terms, this<br />
means should they be held in December this year, or before<br />
the end of May next year? The Government has come to the<br />
conclusion that the elections-for both Houses should be held in<br />
December 1977, and I have recommended accordingly to His<br />
Excellency. Sir, it is appropriate that I should tell the House what<br />
considerations have led the Government to this decision.<br />
At the time the Government was elected in December 1975, Australia<br />
was in a state of severe depression marked by rapid inflation,'<br />
rapidly rising unemployment, and declining output.<br />
Since -that eliection, the Government has pursued policies designed<br />
to correct the situation. These policies have required steady<br />
and resolute action.. There-are now encouraging--signs that they<br />
are succeeding.*-<br />
The economy is strengthening, there is now indisputable evidence<br />
that we are winning the fight against inflation. Interest rates<br />
are falling. Investment is rising, confidence is returning.<br />
The conditions under which real economic growth can proceed<br />
are bein g restored. The Government takes much satisfaction<br />
from these encouraging developments.<br />
Nevertheless, there~ isstill much to be done. The reduction in the<br />
rate of inflation, the achievement of real economic growth and<br />
the progressive reduction of unem~ ployment which is a vital part<br />
of the Government's goals can only be sustained by the continuance<br />
of these policies. .3 </p>
