PRIME MINISTER'S INTERVIEW WITH KERRY O'BRIEN ON. FOUR CORNERS<br />
SATURDAY 18 OCTOBER 1975<br />
O'BRIEN: Mr Whitlam at the outset can we ascertain one thing:<br />
is there going to be a half Senate election?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: There well may be; I will1 not be certain<br />
about this until or unless the Senate rejects * the Budget Bills.<br />
At' this stage they have not rejected them. they've just moved<br />
to defer them.<br />
O'BRIEN: Is it as clear cut as that~ that until such time as<br />
they actually reject the Bills, if they just keep delaying and<br />
delaying? PRIME MINISTER: If it becomes clear that from the extent and<br />
the duration of the delays that they're only hedging, that they<br />
are, in effect, rejecting, then it is very likely that I will ask<br />
for there to be a half Senate election.<br />
O'BRIEN: Wouldn't that be a moot point as far as the public is<br />
concernedJ I mean the situation is here, now?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No, it's a very critical point among the Liberal<br />
and Country Party not maybe among the Country Party but in<br />
the Liberal Party there are very great qualms felt about rejecting<br />
a money Bill. It's never happened in Australia in the Federal.<br />
Parliament yet. And there have been many occasions when the<br />
Government that is, the party with the majority in the House<br />
of Representativeshas not had a majority in the Senate. But<br />
in those circumstances there have been 139 Bills which could<br />
have been rejected by a Senate, where there was an anti-Government<br />
majority, but it's never been done. So they are very reluctant<br />
to come to that crunch.<br />
~ O'BRIEN: Well~ what is your scenario of the next few months?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: All I can be positive about at this stage is<br />
that I will not advise the Governor-General to issue the writs<br />
for the House of Representatives election at the behest of<br />
the Senate. That is, as long as I have a majority in the House<br />
of Representatives.<br />
O'BRIEN: How long can you afford to stall?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Well, this is two Parties here, each taking up<br />
an attitude; one will have to yield. I will not yield on this<br />
issue. It is central not just for my government but for any<br />
Australian Government from now on,, it is an impossible situation<br />
if the Senate can dictate when there are House of Representatives<br />
elections. I will not cop that.<br />
O'BRIEN: Do you hold out any hope that Mr Frasbr might yet<br />
back down?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I'm not going to speculate on what will happ en<br />
in the Liberal Party. All I'm positive about is, that as long<br />
as I have a ' majority in the House of Representatives I will never<br />
advise the Governor-General to issue writs for a House of<br />
Representatives election at the behest of the Senate. I will stand<br />
firm on that, no question whatever. </p>
<p>1~ O'BRIEN: What's your own analysis of how a half-Senate election<br />
would go; could you in political reality hope to gain a temporary<br />
majority in the Senate?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Yes. There are six persons who would be in the<br />
Senate from the day that the polls were declared: six persons<br />
who are not there now. The rest of the Senate, that is the<br />
successors to the people who were elected to the Senate, would not<br />
take office until the first of July. But following on the High<br />
Court decision of Friday week, there will be two Senators for the<br />
Northern Territory and two from the Australian Capital Territory<br />
from the day that the polls are declared and also there would be<br />
a replacement in Queensland and New South Wales for the two<br />
appointments, non Labor appointments, which were made to succeed<br />
the former Labor Senators. So there would be six Senators from<br />
the day that the polls were declared, as distinct from next July.<br />
O'BRIEN: What are you prepared to put the country through in<br />
terms of Public Service disruption?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Well we obviously will do all we can to remove<br />
or reduce the distress that will be caused to Public Servants,<br />
soldiers, patients under Medibank, people in aged persons homes,<br />
students, all those people that can't get payments from the<br />
taxes until the Australian Government gets its Budget passed.<br />
O'BRIEN: Although it was Mr Fraser's decision that forced the<br />
situation, do you have any moral right to expect or ask the<br />
country to share that with you?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Certainly, certainly. This is quite basic<br />
to democracy in Australia. The Constitution says-and everybody<br />
has assumed-that the House of Representatives should last for<br />
k' three years. Now the proposition that is being put up by the<br />
Opposition under Mr Fraser's dictation at the moment is: that<br />
if the Government, the Party with the majority in the House of<br />
Representatives 6oesn't have a majority in the Senate,-that is<br />
O if it is in a minority or if it only has half of the Senatorsit<br />
can be made to have an election at any time within that<br />
three years. Obviously in Octoberwhen the Budget has to be<br />
passed or in April with the Supply has to be passed. Now this<br />
is an intolerable situation. No Prime Minister would have<br />
accepted it in my time Menzies' wouldn't; Holt wouldn't; Gorton<br />
wouldn't and Gorton of course doesn't accept it now.<br />
O'BRIEN: To what extent would you be relying on drastic economic<br />
disruption to turn public opinion against Mr Fraser?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: There will certainly be a great deal of disruption,<br />
From all the signs I see, from hundreds of telegrams pouring into<br />
the office, and also of course, crowds that you saw outside<br />
Parliament House admittedly that was Canberra, full of Public<br />
Servants-on Thursday; from all those indications people are very<br />
much aroused by this thing. Not just Labor supporters; it's true<br />
that in my Government's first term there was a similar threat<br />
half way through. Well, we took it then. Now there is a threat<br />
a second time, midway through our second term; we will not accept<br />
it this time.<br />
O'BRIEN: Just on the point of public support; are you concerned that<br />
a militant response from trade unionists could led to political<br />
violence? -2-</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER: I don't know what you mean by political violence?.<br />
O'BRIEN: In the current...<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I don't know what you mean by political violence<br />
are you meaning, you know, physical violence?<br />
O'BRIEN: Yes physical violence?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: . Oh) I would certainly hope not. Bu't there can be no question...<br />
O'BRIEN: Do you see that the mood is there?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: PeoDle are very incensed, they are very roused<br />
by this and the appalling thing is of course, that it'Is the<br />
conservatives who have flouted the conventions. It was<br />
conservative governments that broke the convention about appointing<br />
Senators of the same party as former Senators to vacancies. It<br />
is now conservatives who are flouting the convention that the<br />
Budget and money Bills generally are passed by the Senate.. And<br />
Qit is the conservatives who are threatening that StLate non-Labor<br />
Governments will advise State Governors,., not just the Governor<br />
of Governor of Queensland but State Governors in general . to<br />
refuse the Governor-General's request to issue writs for a half-<br />
Senate election. Now the conservatives are putting all these<br />
basic conventions in jeopardy.<br />
O'BRIEN: Well what of the conservatives point tha t, in fact, o<br />
wanted to reject Supply in the Senate in 1* 970? yo<br />
PRiME MINISTER: There was one money Bill te, wst it? I know<br />
0 this is constantly... Mind you if they think that the view I<br />
expressed on a particular money Bill at that time was correct..<br />
why don't they reject Supply? But they're shrinking from that.<br />
I did in fact express that view; I might have been right or I might<br />
have been wrong. If they think it is right, why don't they<br />
0bite the bullet, why don't they reject the Budget They haven't.<br />
O'BRIEN: Isn't that awkward ground for you now to be arguing on?<br />
IRIME MINISTER: No, no. When it was for real, let me quote this<br />
there is no question about this circumstance. In 1967 the<br />
: 1 Holt Government was in a minority in the Senate and we and the DLP<br />
-whom I got rid of at the last election combined to reject<br />
increased postal charges: they are not money Bills incidentally<br />
under the Constitution. When the Budget came on the Holt Government<br />
reintroduced those in the form of money Bills. And when they did<br />
that I successfully argued in the Caucus that we should not oppose<br />
them. Now there was a big fight in the Caucus on this, some of<br />
p the Labor Senators wanted to vote against the money Bills; they<br />
could have done it; I said that it was wrong. And I prevailed.<br />
That is when it has been for real when there has been an anti-<br />
Government majority in the Senate that could have rejected a<br />
money Bill, I successfully strove to see that the Labor Party<br />
didn't connive at that course.<br />
O'BRIEN: Isn't expediency the first convention of politicians?<br />
PRI14E MINISTER: No, no" oh no. What my Government does, what I<br />
do as Prime Minister now, can affect every subsequent Australian<br />
Government. If I don't stand firm orn the principle that money Bills<br />
are the responsibility of the Government that Governments are made </p>
<p>7<br />
yor unmade in the House of Representatives, then every subsequent<br />
Australian Government will be under threat by a Senate in which<br />
it doesn't hiave a majority, twice-a year. And it is impossible<br />
for any political party, even in the most'-tranquil times, to have<br />
predominant popularity throughout a three year term. ' No Governmen~ t<br />
can be sure that it will popular in six months' time.<br />
O'BRIEN: Quite obviously') you will be arguing Constitutional crisis<br />
as a main thrust in the campaign?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Yes, quite,, quite; and this is a winning issue.<br />
O'BRIEN: Mr Fraser on the other hand argues the totality of your<br />
performance in government. A failed Budget...<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No...<br />
SO'BRIEN:-' and of the loans affair?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: How can you say that the Budget has failed when<br />
it hasn't been passed? This election when and if it takes placewill<br />
be very largely on the Budget. And for the first time<br />
Mr Fraser would then have to say on behalf of the Liberal and<br />
presumably the Country Par-ties what sort of Budget the Senate would<br />
pass. This is just not an idle thing criticising our'Budget:<br />
it would be a question of what Budget would it pass, what Budget<br />
do they think would be better? And as any viewer would know_.<br />
I'm satisfied that the public believes that Hayden is a better<br />
Treasurer than Lynch would be.<br />
iJ<br />
O' BRIEN: What about his other point., that you have had to sack<br />
two senior ministers because they misled. you?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Well these are very big wounds for the Government)<br />
obviously. And I regret to say that these two senior colleagues<br />
misled. the Parliament. They have paid the penalty.<br />
0 O'BRIEN: 11ow does a man of reputed abilities and experience<br />
allow that, to happen?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I suppose I was too trusting. These were people<br />
who had been in Parliament in one case for 20 years and in another<br />
case for 25 years. They should have known better.<br />
O'BRIEN: Do you accept Mr Khemlani's claim that he's been in such<br />
close and constant touch with Mr Connor?<br />
PRIM4E MINISTER: I don't know; I don't know whether that is so or<br />
not. O'BRIEN: Did Mr Connor explain to you why he misled', you?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No~ he didn't. He didn't dispute that Mr Khemlani<br />
had sent him several telexes about which of course he hadn't told<br />
me, nor the Parliament. But these are side issues. This might<br />
have driven the opposition to the brink) as Senator Gair' s. appointment<br />
* to Ireland. During the campaign you never -heard about Gair. </p>
<p>O'BRIEN: But if we can just pursue that side issue for a moment.<br />
You've said that dismissing Mr Connor, cr accepting his resignation,<br />
was one of the most painful decisions<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Yes of course it was.<br />
O'BRIEN: of your life; how close were you to him?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I thought he was a very capable man. And he<br />
has done, he has produced, a transformation in the attitude of<br />
Australians to their resources. He's been terribly delayed<br />
of course by challenges in the Courts, by actions of the Senate.<br />
But he has brought about a complete transformation in the terms<br />
upon which Australians are able to develop their resources or<br />
sell the products of their resources.<br />
O'BRIEN: Was he an influence on you politically?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: We were on each of us. He is a very able man<br />
indeed. It s distressing that he made this error, a gross error;<br />
an isolated error, I believe. But he has paid the penalty.<br />
O'BRIEN: And you accept none of the blame for either of those two?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: None whatever. I knew nothing about these telexes. He never told<br />
me. He never told anyone. But these are side issuesquite<br />
frankly. Connor's influence on Australia's resources for the good<br />
will endure. It was remarkable the way, when the Liberals<br />
bought out their policy on natural resources or overseas<br />
investment last Monday it was a copy of what we'd brought out a<br />
week earlier.<br />
Q O'BRIEN: Just one last question on that side issue. Does<br />
the buck not stop at Gough Whitlam's desk? Could the Opposition<br />
fairly claim that~ as they also fairly claim~ that under the<br />
Westminster system you should resign?<br />
O PRIME MINISTER: They are wrong. Once I knew that a second<br />
minister had misled the Parliament, there was only one course<br />
he had to go, and he did. Whenever I have found anything like<br />
this, I have acted immediately.<br />
O'BRIEN: Is it political reality to think that you have the<br />
option now ahead of you, of loss or victory at the polls, or<br />
is it more a choice between decimation and respectable loss?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I believe that if my Government goes the<br />
three years for which it was elected, we shall win. After all,<br />
this is a very good Budget, a very good Budget. I think it<br />
will be a popular Budget, but it must by given an opportunity<br />
to work. And this constant threat which we've hadyou<br />
knowtwice a year in the three years we've been in about<br />
rejecting money Bills. because this has been threatened every<br />
time, it was threatened the first six months wewere in<br />
in April 1973 it was threatened. This obviously upsets<br />
business confidence.<br />
O'BRIEN: In this campaign do you have more respect for . the<br />
Opposition leader now than you have had for his predecessors? / 6 </p>
<p>6.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I thought I would have I now don't.<br />
I think Mr Fraser...<br />
O'BRIEN: I mean in terms of him as an opponent?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No, no, I think Mr Fraser is now seen as<br />
a naked opportunist. He'll do anything. he was getting rid of<br />
Holt he got rid of Gorton; he got rid of Snedden; on the<br />
second occasion. And I think people see that he will stop<br />
at nothing. He will eschew no. methods to get into office.<br />
O'BRIEN: Ifafter a half Senate election~ the decision was<br />
made on the vote of Senator Albert Field to go to a double<br />
dissolution, to what extent would you exploit him as an<br />
issue? PRIME MINISTER: Mind you, you're assuming that if the<br />
Governor-General asks the State Governors to issue writs<br />
I( T fhoarv e aa Ssekenda teo n el24e ctpiroenvi, o-usso meotchciansgi ownhsi cahn dG wohviecrnho resv-eGreyn eSrtaalte<br />
Governor has always complied withyou're assuming that if<br />
that's done) Mr Bjelke-Petersen would advise Sir Colin<br />
Hannah not to issue thewrits. From what I know of Mr<br />
Bjelke-Petersenkhe might well do that. From what we now<br />
know of Sir Colin Hannah he is the sort of man who might,<br />
for the first time, break a three-quarters of a century<br />
convention in Australia. The conservatives will stop at<br />
nothing: Premiers, or, I regret to say, some State Governors.<br />
/ h O'BRIEN: Are you aware of a groundswill of support for you with-<br />
I J in the Party now like you haven't bad before? Do you feel that<br />
you're standing is higher?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Well there's no question in our Party<br />
there is a strong feeling of support that this is an outrage<br />
we cannot cop. On the other hand the Liberal Party<br />
is unquestionably beset by qualms over this.<br />
O'BRIEN: Why does it take potential disaster like this for<br />
the Party to pull you together?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I don't feel that it needs, that there is<br />
a potential disaster, I don't feel that it needs a disaster<br />
to pull us together. I think people don't realise that<br />
political parties do change over the years. It's true that<br />
the Scullin Government, the Lang Government, went to pieces,<br />
the last time Australia was going through an economic situation,<br />
world-wide as it was, similar to what Australia, and all<br />
western societies, are going through now. But I don't believe<br />
that this will happen to the Whitlam Government.<br />
O'BRIEN: You've presented a picture in the last few days<br />
of a man who's in a tight corner; who's come out fighting, and<br />
you've looked like you're enjoying the fight. Would that<br />
be an accurate observation? </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER: I wouldn't be, I wouldn't stay, in this life<br />
if I didn't think that there were compensations for the<br />
rigours which it entails. It's a very tough life, but I've<br />
been in it for a long time. I believe in the Parliamentary<br />
system and I'm going to fLight for it.<br />
O'BRIEN: Even allowing for your opti mism in the elections.,<br />
if you did go into Opposition, would you want to stay on as<br />
leader?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: ' I haven't thought about that. Let that<br />
happen. I don't concede it will. There will be a House of<br />
Representatives election sometime before July 1977.<br />
When it comes about~ I shall decide. I shall not advise<br />
the Governor-General to issue the writs at the behest of<br />
the Senate.<br />
3 O'BRIEN: Mr Whitlam, thanks very much for app earing on<br />
' our Corners'<br />
