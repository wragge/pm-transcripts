    <content><![CDATA[<p>E&amp;OE........................................................................................</p>
<p>Thank you very much Mr Mayor for those very kind words of welcome. To</p>
<p> my colleagues Don Page and Larry Anthony, to all the other councilors</p>
<p> and very importantly the representatives of the Ballina community.</p>
<p>I have a connection with Ballina. The brother and sister-in-law of my,</p>
<p> I don't say oldest friend, but my longest standing friend, John and</p>
<p> Sally Lowry. John's brother Peter and I were I suppose you'd</p>
<p> call us best mates at Canterbury Boys High School, more than 43 years</p>
<p> ago, I left school in 1956, and John and Sally settled in Ballina a lot</p>
<p> of years ago and they were always kind enough to turn up whenever I come</p>
<p> to these parts and it's nice to see them again today. And when I</p>
<p> think of Ballina I think of that connection that goes back a very long</p>
<p> way.</p>
<p>But it's typical I suppose of a community like this that it brings</p>
<p> together different strands of Australian society and the Australian people.</p>
<p> It brings together people that have lived in this community long before</p>
<p> it became a lot more attractive to people in other parts of Australia.</p>
<p> There are a lot of people who live in communities like Ballina who have</p>
<p> a very strong and genuine commitment to environmental concerns. I've</p>
<p> met in the short time I've been here the students of a significant</p>
<p> cross section of both government and independent schools offering the</p>
<p> parents of this district a choice in the education of their children.</p>
<p> I was very pleased to hear the representative of the local Anglican school</p>
<p> acknowledge the contribution that the government's new schools policy</p>
<p> had made to the expansion of choice when it comes to the education of</p>
<p> our young.</p>
<p>I've had the opportunity of talking about the social challenges</p>
<p> with the representative of Lifeline. That great organisation started more</p>
<p> than 40 years ago in Australia in Sydney by the then Reverend Allan Walker</p>
<p> and it spread all around the world as a unique way of providing access</p>
<p> to people who feel in the depths of despair and are in need of assistance</p>
<p> in handling their particular personal and emotional problems. And the</p>
<p> value to me of a gathering like this is I guess encapsulated by what I've</p>
<p> just said over the last five minutes or so. It reminds me of this marvelous</p>
<p> collection of people doing good things by their fellow men and women which</p>
<p> is the hallmark of Australian society.</p>
<p>A lot of things are said about Australia. People often remark about our</p>
<p> love of sport and that's accurate because we love it, and I'm</p>
<p> no exception to the rule. People talk about our sense of mateship and</p>
<p> that's accurate too. People talk about the fact that we're an</p>
<p> open society. We respect people according to their worth not according</p>
<p> to their class or according to their background or their ethnic origin.</p>
<p> There's another characteristic of Australian society that's</p>
<p> very important and that is the characteristic of the volunteer spirit.</p>
<p> We are one of the great volunteer societies in the world. We are a society</p>
<p> which gets things done with the assistance of volunteers in a way in which</p>
<p> few other societies are able to accomplish. And some of the best of the</p>
<p> Australian spirit comes out when as a community we come together to respond</p>
<p> to natural challenges and to respond to community needs. And I've</p>
<p> been reminded as I have moved amongst you today of just how important</p>
<p> the volunteer spirit is to the Australian psyche and the Australian sense</p>
<p> of being.</p>
<p>As you know in the past few days I've been moving around the bush,</p>
<p> rural and regional Australia, learning more about some of the opportunities</p>
<p> as well as some of the problems. And I had the pleasure just a few, I</p>
<p> guess an hour-and-a-half ago to open a new credit union, a new Summerland</p>
<p> Credit Union office not far from here and that will bring new services</p>
<p> to this particular part of Australia. And I know how important community</p>
<p> services provided either by governments, by the private sector, or by</p>
<p> a combination of the two, how important those services are to people who</p>
<p> live outside the metropolitan area. Life is different when you get out</p>
<p> of the big smoke. In some respects it's better, in other respects</p>
<p> it represents a challenge and it's important when we look at the</p>
<p> comparisons of the city and the country, or the city and the coastal regions,</p>
<p> we understand that there are plusses and minuses and I'm very mindful</p>
<p> of the fact that people in the regional areas of Australia have a right</p>
<p> to access basic services with the same speed and according to the same</p>
<p> principles of affordability as people who live in the metropolitan areas</p>
<p> of Australia, particularly in the very large cities. And of course your</p>
<p> local member, Larry Anthony, who's now the Minister for Community</p>
<p> Services as well as being the Member for Richmond, has a special role</p>
<p> in responding to the concerns and interests of people in the community</p>
<p> sector.</p>
<p> I've spoken a lot over the last year, indeed over the last two</p>
<p> or three years of the concept I have of a social coalition. What that</p>
<p> concepts really says is that if you want to provide the best solutions</p>
<p> and the best responses to some of our community problems you need to get</p>
<p> the government, the local volunteer sector, the business community, and</p>
<p> public spirited individuals all working together, each contributing what</p>
<p> they can do best towards solving a problem. The government has of course</p>
<p> a fundamental role to finance a social security safety net in our society.</p>
<p> When I talk about this social coalition I don't talk about any concept</p>
<p> of the government reducing its support. I see the government continuing</p>
<p> its support. But I see that support being continued in harness with the</p>
<p> expertise and the goodwill the resources of the community sector.</p>
<p>And in the time that I've been Prime Minister I have tried to involve</p>
<p> many of the great social organisations, welfare organisations of Australia</p>
<p> not just in providing as they can do better than anything else Â</p>
<p> help and advice, and moral and where necessary spiritual support to people</p>
<p> who need it - but also I've tried to involve them in policy making.</p>
<p> And it's been no accident that I've had a Salvation Army captain</p>
<p> from Melbourne Â David Eldridge Â chair my Youth Homelessness</p>
<p> Task Force which has given the government some new insights into stopping</p>
<p> families falling apart in the first place before the young person becomes</p>
<p> homeless. And when it's happened in the early stages if it's</p>
<p> possible to do so, putting the young people back in contact with their</p>
<p> parents. It's much better to have policies that prevent families</p>
<p> falling apart in the beginning and it's also less expensive to the</p>
<p> community, than it is to say well we'll sit by idly, let it happen,</p>
<p> when it's happened we'll provide independent income support.</p>
<p> Now in some cases it's never possible to put things back together</p>
<p> again. We don't live in a utopia, we don't live in an ideal</p>
<p> world. Families and relationships do break up and fall apart and there's</p>
<p> a tragically high incidence of it in the Australia of today. And one of</p>
<p> the reasons why our social welfare demands continue to rise is the simple</p>
<p> fact that more and more families break up or more relationships break</p>
<p> up and more and more is the case that we have sole parent families. And</p>
<p> they do a magnificent job and the fact that we lament that there's</p>
<p> a growing number of them is certainly no criticism of the way in which</p>
<p> many parents, overwhelmingly but certainly not entirely women, soldier</p>
<p> on and look after their children in very difficult circumstances. But</p>
<p> we ought to have policies that keep families together as far as it's</p>
<p> humanly possible to do so. So the digression from what I was saying was</p>
<p> to make that point that the best youth homeless policies are those that</p>
<p> try and stop the youth being homeless in the first instance.</p>
<p>I've also involved people from the welfare sector in relation to</p>
<p> drugs policy. I know that's often an issue of debate in this part</p>
<p> of the world. I know that some of the views that I express on that are</p>
<p> criticised by those who think that there is a different way than arguing</p>
<p> the cause of total rehabilitation and total rejection of drugs. I happen</p>
<p> to believe very strongly that the best way to tackle the drug problem</p>
<p> is to have an increased commitment in three areas. You need to increase</p>
<p> your commitment as a community to law enforcement. And can I take the</p>
<p> opportunity of congratulating the Australian Federal Police and the Australian</p>
<p> Customs Service working in cooperation with the New South Wales Police</p>
<p> for the very significant seizure of cocaine which took place yesterday.</p>
<p> I make no comment for obvious legal reasons on the liability or otherwise</p>
<p> of those who've been arrested. But the fact that a major seizure</p>
<p> of that kind has taken place along with many other major seizures does</p>
<p> indicate that whilst you can never claim any kind of victory in law enforcement</p>
<p> in relation to drugs, we are doing well and the Federal Police and the</p>
<p> Customs Service and the New South Wales Police deserve our thanks as they</p>
<p> always do because of the important community service that they provide.</p>
<p>The second area where we need to act in relation to drugs is of course</p>
<p> education. We need to adopt an uncompromising attitude towards the use</p>
<p> of drugs in schools. And I support and applaud both government and non-government</p>
<p> schools that have a no drugs in our school policy and are prepared to</p>
<p> enforce that policy against people who break it. And I think State education</p>
<p> departments and State education ministers and indeed others charged with</p>
<p> responsibility of schools ought to give full faith and affect to those</p>
<p> sort of policies.</p>
<p>And finally we need more services to help people who want to break the</p>
<p> drug habit. One of the things that we've done recently is to put</p>
<p> a lot more money from a federal level, and I'm pleased to say it's</p>
<p> largely being matched although not completely as yet by the States, to</p>
<p> what I call a diversion program. And this put simply says to somebody</p>
<p> who's caught with a minor drug offence, you simply say to that person</p>
<p> you've got a choice Â you can take your chances with the criminal</p>
<p> justice system and perhaps at some time if your drug offences and the</p>
<p> consequences of that continue end up in gaol, or you can agree to undertake</p>
<p> a program of treatment to break your drug habit. In other words we divert</p>
<p> people from the criminal justice system into treatment and rehabilitation.</p>
<p> And this is being trialed in different ways in some of the States. The</p>
<p> New South Wales government has trialed it in relation to the drug courts,</p>
<p> and other governments are showing increased interest in it. Now I don't</p>
<p> pretend for a moment that the problem isn't other than a huge challenge.</p>
<p> I have to say that I am unconvinced that heroin trials or safe injecting</p>
<p> rooms offers a realistic alternative to the policies that are being followed.</p>
<p> I acknowledge that there are some, perhaps a significant number in the</p>
<p> community who don't agree with me. We'll continue to have the</p>
<p> debate. I'll continue to argue why I think they are not proper alternatives,</p>
<p> and no doubt those who disagree with me will continue to put the other</p>
<p> point of view. But it would be a great pity if the focus by the media</p>
<p> and other commentators on those parts of the drug challenge, it would</p>
<p> be a great pity if they gave the impression that that is really the only</p>
<p> thing that has ever been looked at in relation to drugs. As to most of</p>
<p> the campaign against drugs, can I tell you there's about a 90% to</p>
<p> 95% agreement across Australia between the federal government, the State</p>
<p> government, Labor, Liberal and National Party. It's an issue that</p>
<p> ought to transcend political differences and there's an enormous</p>
<p> amount of cooperation and that cooperation extends into the areas of law</p>
<p> enforcement.</p>
<p> So ladies and gentlemen, I've chosen to say a few things about</p>
<p> those social and community issues today to you because I think they are</p>
<p> important. Of course the economic wellbeing of the community is tremendously</p>
<p> important as well. But a total national health audit if I can put it that</p>
<p> way, includes not only economic issues but also social and human issues</p>
<p> and each reinforces the other. And the responsibility of a government</p>
<p> is to try and get the balance right. We pride ourselves on our achievements</p>
<p> in strengthening the Australian economy and it is stronger and better</p>
<p> and more robust and more competitive than it was four years ago. We have</p>
<p> fewer people out of work, we have lower interest rates, we have lower</p>
<p> inflation, we created something like 580,000 new jobs, we have strong</p>
<p> economic growth, we stared down the Asian economic downturn.. That doesn't</p>
<p> mean to say that everybody's getting a reasonable share. Some aren't.</p>
<p> I understand that. And when the country's doing well over all the</p>
<p> people who are missing out feel it all the more keenly. And one of the</p>
<p> roles of the government as far as it can, and there's a limit to</p>
<p> what the government can do, we've got to try and ensure that the</p>
<p> national economic cake is at least freely available to everybody even</p>
<p> though some will work harder than others to get their share of it.</p>
<p>But today is very much a community gathering and it's an opportunity</p>
<p> for me on behalf I guess of the country to thank the people who work in</p>
<p> a volunteer way in the community, to make life more bearable and more</p>
<p> enjoyable and more comfortable for those less fortunate. I want to particularly</p>
<p> thank the police and the fire services and the other emergency services</p>
<p> for the contribution that they make. It's not easy work. It's</p>
<p> often filled with trauma and a great deal of stress. And it's very</p>
<p> important that the contribution of the police and other services be very</p>
<p> very freely acknowledged.</p>
<p>But over all it's a great experience for me as Prime Minister to</p>
<p> travel around our country. Over the past week I've been to Port Lincoln,</p>
<p> to Quorn in rural South Australia, to Bourke, to Nyngan, to Dubbo, last</p>
<p> night in the Tweed, here in Ballina, going onto Lismore tonight and so</p>
<p> it goes on. And I've learnt a lot. I've had some views reinforced.</p>
<p> I've had some different perspectives placed on things. I've</p>
<p> learnt the value of tackling problems in a community way rather than negotiating</p>
<p> an outcome between the various interests groups. But I'm delighted</p>
<p> to say that at every single gathering I've gone to we've had</p>
<p> a wide cross section of the community. So I'm tremendously impressed.</p>
<p> For example in a place like Bourke where the problems of that city, the</p>
<p> social problems, the difficulties between Aboriginal Australians and other</p>
<p> Australians in that town were being tackled not in a pejorative way by</p>
<p> the community, not with one group sitting in a corner and negotiating</p>
<p> with the other, but rather with everybody seeing it as a community challenge</p>
<p> and a community problem. And I've sought wherever possible to get</p>
<p> a view of what the attitude of the community is not by meeting one individual</p>
<p> group. I haven't had separate meetings with the National Farmers</p>
<p> Federation, or separate meetings with the Aboriginal land councils, or</p>
<p> separate meetings with this or that. Rather what I've done is to</p>
<p> come to gatherings like this and to talk to people as a group. I think</p>
<p> you get a group ambience, you get a better cross section of opinion, you</p>
<p> get a more understanding responsive give and take attitude when you go</p>
<p> to a community gathering like this, rather than trying to get all of your</p>
<p> information from one specific group.</p>
<p>But it has been a great experience and I've learnt a lot. And of</p>
<p> course in this job you go on learning and you go on getting better understanding</p>
<p> and better insights. Can I conclude by saying to you what a tremendously</p>
<p> capable and energetic member you have in Larry Anthony. Larry has not</p>
<p> been a member for very long but he has risen fast because he's done</p>
<p> well. And he's an energetic person who comes from a very long and</p>
<p> honourable family of political tradition, and he's giving very effective</p>
<p> representation to this community. So ladies and gentlemen thank you most</p>
<p> warmly for your very kind hospitality and your traditional Australian</p>
<p> friendliness. I value it very much.</p>
