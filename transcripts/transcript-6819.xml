E &amp; 0E PROOF ONLY<br />
JOURNAPLIST: Mr H-awke, it is good news for the Australian<br />
dollar today.<br />
FM: Yes, it is good news. As In most things in economics<br />
though, there are two sides to every picture. The rural<br />
community and our manufacturers WeO* e benefitting more when<br />
the dollar was down lower. But the~ re is no doubt overall<br />
the dollar had to come up. It was in Australia's best interests<br />
that that happen.<br />
JOURNALIST: Do you think iL will see a fall In interest<br />
rates perhaps?<br />
PM: Well, it is situations like this make statements<br />
likely to influence the market. I simply wanlt to say what<br />
I have said earlier though, that an improvement in the dollar<br />
exchange rate was essential condition for creating a move<br />
downward in interest rates. And we are pleased therefore<br />
that that condition has emerged.<br />
JOURNALIST: inaudible question<br />
PM: changes that take place price of crudc and<br />
the value of-the dollar and see just what decision is necessary<br />
K -to continue the policy that we have successfully adhered<br />
to now for three years. We have made a series of economic<br />
policy decisions which have produced the best rate of economic<br />
growth of any of the OECD countries. That is what Australia<br />
enjoys. We have got the best rate of employment growth<br />
of any OECD, the highest rate of employment of growth in<br />
Australia's history. Those things haven't happened by accident.<br />
Thiey have come from careful consideration of all the relevant<br />
factors that have to be taken into account. And then the<br />
making of tho right combination of policy decisions. Anid<br />
that is what we will continue to do.<br />
