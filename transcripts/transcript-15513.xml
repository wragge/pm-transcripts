    <content><![CDATA[<p>I am pleased to announce with the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources, Mr Malcolm Turnbull, that the Queensland Government has satisfied funding conditions for the Australian Government's contribution of $408 million to the Western Corridor Recycled Water Scheme in south-east Queensland.</p>
<p>The Queensland Government has reached agreement with the Lockyer Valley Water Users Forum on the availability of recycled water from the Western Corridor Scheme to farmers in the Lockyer Valley and the Mid Brisbane River region.</p>
<p>This was a key condition of Australian Government funding for the Western Corridor Scheme.  Irrigators can now finalise their plans for the necessary infrastructure to provide them a secure supply of water into the future.</p>
<p>The Queensland Government has also met the condition to publish financial information for the project including current and forecast costs of construction and operation together with an up to date business case.</p>
<p>We are pleased that the Australian Government has been able to bring a level of transparency for the people of Queensland with the publication of this financial information.</p>
<p>The Queensland Government has also provided assurance that Queensland will not be seeking additional funding from the Australian Government for the Western Corridor project.</p>
<p>The Western Corridor project is the largest recycled water scheme to be constructed in the southern hemisphere.  When completed, it will have the potential to produce purified recycled water for power stations and other industrial uses, agriculture and drinking water supply and will provide positive long term outcomes for south-east Queensland.</p>
<p>The Australian Government announced funding of $408 million for the Western Corridor Recycled Water Scheme project subject to the conditions outlined above on 24 April 2007.</p>
<p>The Australian Government looks forward to working with Queensland to see this important project to fruition. It will help provide a more secure water future for the people of south-east Queensland.</p>
