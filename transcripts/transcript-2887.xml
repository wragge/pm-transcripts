PRIME MINISTER 7 April 1973<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER,<br />
THE HON. E. G. WHITLAM, M. P.,<br />
AT THE OPENING OF<br />
WESTERN MINING CORPORATION' S NICKEL SMELTER,<br />
KALGOORLIE, 7 APRIL 1973<br />
The opening of this smelter is more than a great new<br />
milestone in the remarkable history of the Kalgoorlie<br />
area; it is a mark of confidence of the Western Mining<br />
Corporation in the area's futdre. And I come here today to<br />
express and demonstrate my Government's complete confidence<br />
in the future, not just of this area, but of the future of<br />
the great and diverse resources of this vast western and<br />
northern area of Australia.<br />
Kalgoorlie itself is in a way a living symbol of<br />
Australia's good fortune and it is a symbol also of Australia's<br />
interdependence. Some of the very worst ravages of the<br />
depression which struck the eastern colonies, particularly<br />
Victoria, in the nineties were reduced by the timely discovery<br />
of gold here. It is a matter of record that the personal and<br />
family links between the west and the east, formed as a result<br />
of the gold rush, played a key part in preventing the breakup<br />
of the Federation, or West Australia's secession from it a<br />
generation later. Kalgoorlie itself fell on hard times;<br />
yet today even the gold industry is probably in better shape<br />
than any time for the last decade. The future of the area<br />
is probably brighter than any time in its history.<br />
I would like to give a general outline of my Government's<br />
attitude to the mineral resources of Australia and relate it<br />
to this particular resource of nickel. We have to recognise<br />
that the interests of the mining industry must be placed in the<br />
perspective of the interests of Australia as a whole.<br />
We do not ignore, but we cannot be pre-occupied with the short<br />
term interest of a particular section of the economy or a<br />
special interest within the economy. In short we have to plan<br />
for the economy as a whole, in the interests of industry as a<br />
whole and in the interests of the people as a whole. 9. 9 2/ </p>
<p>And in such planning we have to take account of the wider<br />
international realities. We have to recognise that Australia's<br />
resources, great as they are, are not unlimited.<br />
We have to recognise the growing concern in major industrialised<br />
countries at the rapid depletion of traditional sources of<br />
energy and raw materials. We have to see that our minerals are<br />
sold at reasonable prices in world markets. We have to preserve<br />
the interests of Australians yet unborn, to ensure that our<br />
prosperity is not bought at the price of impoverishment<br />
of future generations. And I mean not only material impoverishment<br />
but the impoverishment of their environment. We have to preserve<br />
for ourselves and for the generations to come the greatest<br />
possible measure of Australian ownership and participation in<br />
the mining industry.<br />
These are the considerations behind the actions my Government<br />
has already taken and those that we plan to take in the years<br />
ahead. Nickel, of course, is basically an export industry.<br />
Australian consumption is less than 8% of current Australian<br />
production so I am very much aware that this industry has<br />
been directly and in the short term, I acknowledge, unfavourably<br />
affected by certain of our measures. You know that we have<br />
placed controls on all mineral exports whether in raw or<br />
semi-processed form. We aim to ensure that exports are sold at<br />
reasonable prices on the world market. Our measures will<br />
encourage more processing of minerals in Australia, lead to<br />
greater employment opportunities, greater industry self<br />
sufficiency and ultimately to a higher unit value for our<br />
exports themselves. We can look to shipping economies for<br />
both buyer and seller. I assure you, however, that in our quest<br />
for these results we will use our powers and apply controls<br />
judiciously, selectively, realistically.<br />
We will be applying the same common sense judgement to<br />
industries and to areas immediately affected by broader economic<br />
adjustments such as those forced on us by developments in the<br />
world currency situation. As you know we have taken certain<br />
necessary steps to protect the Australian dollar. We would have<br />
been failing in our duty to the Australian people as a whole<br />
had we not done so. No section of Australian industry should<br />
place a short term advantage against the long term well being<br />
of the whole Australian economy.<br />
I have said that my Government is determined to have more<br />
processing of our own mineral resources. We are determined that<br />
Australians shall have a greater degree of ownership and control<br />
of their industries. On both these counts I am delighted to be<br />
personally involved in this project today. The shareholding<br />
of Western Mining Corporation is predominantly Australian and<br />
its Board of Management is completely Australian. I know that<br />
foreign companies have made overtures and these have been<br />
resisted by Western Mining Corporation. My Government will<br />
strongly support the Corporation in such efforts and such<br />
resistance. This smelter is being located near Kalgoorlie partly<br />
at the request of the West Australian Government. It signifies<br />
participation by industry in plans for more balanced development. </p>
<p>It is a splendid thing that the great mining skills built up<br />
over generations in this area should be preserved and used in<br />
the area. As a mark of our confidence, as a mark of our determination<br />
to provide opportunities for youth to live and work in the place<br />
where they were born and grew up, the Government proposes to<br />
contribute to the new student residence being built at the<br />
Kalgoorlie School of Mining. We will be contributing $ 75,000<br />
to it and $ 35,000 to a recreation complex being built in<br />
association with the school.<br />
If we are to have more balanced development, if we are to<br />
provide opportunities for our young men and women, if we are<br />
to maintain and build up our national skills, if we are to<br />
achieve more processing in Australia of Australian resources<br />
we will need to have a greater and continuing co-operation<br />
between governments and industry. We cannot achieve these<br />
things without effective planning and we cannot have effective<br />
planning without that sort of co-operation. In this State<br />
we have already embarked upon some far reaching measures for<br />
co-operation and participation in the development of its<br />
mineral resources. Proper planning must transcend State borders;<br />
for example we have agreed upon a feasibility study to determine<br />
the route of a pipeline bringing the natural gas from<br />
Palm Valley in the Northern Territory to Kalgoorlie then to<br />
Perth and thence to the North-West Shelf. We hope to achieve<br />
an assured and cheap supply of energy for the great industries<br />
based in Kalgoorlie. The whole scope of our national pipeline<br />
project is breathtaking but its the kind of thinking, the kind<br />
of planning which we must have if Australian resources are to<br />
be put to the best use for the greatest benefit of all<br />
Australians. I believe that against long term prospects for<br />
development now opening up before us the short term difficulties<br />
fade into insignificance.<br />
I congratulate the Corporation on its achievement and its<br />
contribution. I congratulate this great and historic area of<br />
Kalgoorlie on the great new chapter now unfolding in its history. </p>
