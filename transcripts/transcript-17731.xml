PM: Thank you very much for making me so welcome and thank you to each of you who participated in raising money for the Queensland floods. As I've wandered through and said hello to everyone, so many of you personally came and made a commitment to doing some fundraising, that's the real Aussie spirit and thank you for showing it.</p>
<p>And it's tremendous to be in this wonderful, vibrant city and find so many Australians who are just wowing it here, congratulations to you (inaudible).</p>
<p>As I commented when I was briefly behind the bar, I did offer to do a bit of serving but that was quickly rejected, maybe they worried about my skill levels. But as I commented behind the bar, I don't really get out and about much anymore to drink beer, so it is a very special occasion.</p>
<p>Thank you very much, enjoy yourselves and I'm sure I'll take the beer with me, but probably have to relinquish it, as I go around the rest of the official program. I'm not sure you can turn up at a diplomatic function carrying a beer (inaudible).</p>
<p>In an Australian crowd you're only going to get urged on for the second beer, but please enjoy and thank you very much and I'll be returning to Australia tomorrow, I've had a great visit here in the US, we've been made incredibly welcome wherever we've been and it's been great to see so many Australian on the journey.</p>
<p>Thank you very much.</p>
