PREMIERS' CONFERENCE 1968<br />
STATE TAXATION<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister, Mr john Gorton<br />
I thinkLl it is the proper time for me to make clear the<br />
Commonwealth's attitude on this question of possible extension of the areas<br />
in which the States levy taxation. In particular, I think i must ma-ke clear<br />
our attitude towards the imposition of States receipts duties on wages and<br />
salaries and similar receipts of personal icome which we regard as income<br />
tax. We take as our starting point the arrangements which were<br />
made in 1965 governing the payment of the financial assistance grants.<br />
These arrangements, like the ones that preceded them, were made on the<br />
' tahssumaptiton that the exerciseof taxing powers would remain unchanged and<br />
the States and their authorities would continue to pay Commonwealth<br />
pay-roll tax. An agreement on that basis was, 1 understand, explicitly<br />
stated at the time. I believe that the States then knew that the Commonwealth<br />
of was not undertaking to pay the agreed grants to the States unless the States<br />
refrained from levying income taxes themselves. That was the position, and<br />
as far as we are concerned that remains the position. We have em phasised<br />
that the introduction of State income taxation would in our view be a serious<br />
breach of the present arrazzgernents.<br />
Over the whole period since World War 11, the Commonwealth<br />
has adhered firmly to the principle of uniform, income taxation and opposed<br />
any suggestion of double income taxation. M\ y own Government is convinced<br />
Sthat this principle is sound and beneficial to the nation and that any multiplica-<br />
Wtion of income taxes would be undesirable both economically and socially*<br />
Because th~ e imposition of income tax and the rates of income tax imposed have<br />
' nmaajor timipolicatnions, f or economic and social policies throughout the whole.<br />
the Commonwealth will not stand by and permit its use of income<br />
taxation for policy purposes to be impaired by the itroduction of State income<br />
taxes. At last year's Conference, there was some discussion as to<br />
what scope there might be within the terms of the present financial assistance<br />
arrange ments for the States to extend their fields of taxation should they<br />
desire to do so. In that context the question of State purchase taxes or turnover<br />
taxes on business receipts was raised. The Commonwealth's attitude was that<br />
it would not be opposed in principle to State taxation of this kind providedit was<br />
not carried to the point where it would significantly affect Commonwealth<br />
revenue collections or the carrying out of national policies.<br />
Shortly afterwards, Victoria introduced its new receipts duty<br />
which extended beyond taxation on turnover with which we have no quarrel<br />
to taxation on wages and salaries and other personal incomes. The Commonwealth<br />
stated its objection to this duty insofar as it applied to wages and salaries and<br />
other comparable payments such as superannuation. I know that a tax similuir </p>
<p>-2<br />
in many respects to the Victorian one was already in operation in Western<br />
Australia, and I icnow, too, that the stamp duty legislation of other States<br />
has at one time or another involved minor imposts on wages and salaries,<br />
but we regard any impost on wages and salaries as in fact, substance 4nd<br />
principle, a form of income tax. The Commonwealth is firmly opposed to<br />
such a levy on wages and salaries and will continue to be so opposed.<br />
In our view, such a levy is in breach of the preseat financial<br />
assistance arrangements agree-d to by all States. W-e believe it is wrong<br />
to impose more than one direct tax on Wages, salaries and related . forms<br />
of income, and if such a practice were to become established and to spread,<br />
it would not only add to the tax burdens on wage and salary earnlers which<br />
already are by no means inconsiderable, but also it could give rise to all<br />
of the evils of differential rates of income tax on citizens living in different<br />
States, from which the system of uniform taxation has rid this country.<br />
We want the States to refrain from imposing receipts duty<br />
on wages and salaries and comparable payments. if these imposts are<br />
still in existence when we come to review the present arrangements in<br />
1970, that will be a decisive factor in determining our attitude on the<br />
allocation to a State imposing that form of taxation. In the meantkme,<br />
should a State that continues this impost on wages and salaries impose it<br />
a higher rate than at present, we would mnove forthwith to amend our<br />
legislation and seec to reduce that State's grant.<br />
1 have already said that we do not object in principle to<br />
modest extensions of State taxation into the general field of business<br />
receipts or business turnover, provided it is not carried to a point where<br />
it could significantly affect the Commonwealth's ability to carry out<br />
national policies or to raise Commonwealth revenue. Subject to that<br />
proviso, there would be -no conflict with the present grants arrangement<br />
if any State decided to move into this field. But we do not suggest or urge<br />
this. We are ready to accept it within the limits I have stated.<br />
In recent times there have been suggestions that some States<br />
might impose a tax on pay-rolls, presumably on the lines of the Commonwealth<br />
pay-roll tax. We have studied that possibility and the various<br />
implications it could have. It is right that i should tell you that the Commonwealth<br />
does not look with favour on such action by any State. " We would<br />
regard it as cutting across major Australian interests and purposes.<br />
Pay-roll taxation is an important source of national rexenue and it is also<br />
an instrument that can be used to promoite activities and developments of<br />
benefit to our economy. For example, the rebate of pay-roll tax is<br />
basically involved in the Commonwealth's scheme of export incentives,<br />
which has been of marked success in promoting the growth of exports,<br />
especially of manufactures, and this in turn has helped all of us. W-e<br />
regard that as a kXind of tax that ought to be reserved to the Australian<br />
Government and administered on a nation-wide basis. </p>
