PRIME MRAINISTE<br />
FOR PRESS 4 DECEMBER 1977<br />
DROUGHT RELIEF -WESTERN AUSTRALIA<br />
The Commonwealth Government today agreed to a request from the<br />
Premier of Western Australia to support an increase to<br />
$ 40,000 in the maximum limit for concessional loans to<br />
primary producers for carry-on and restocking purposes<br />
in drought declared areas.<br />
This assistance is being provided under the Natural Disaster<br />
Assistance Arrangements agreed between the Commonwealth and<br />
the States.<br />
The Commonwealth has already agreed to support various drought<br />
relief measures in Western Australia including freight subsidies<br />
for the carriage of fodder, stock and water, a cattle slaughter<br />
compensation scheme, and assistance to local and semi-government<br />
authorities to slaughter and dispose of helpless and unsaleable<br />
stock. Similar drought relief measures have been supported in New<br />
South Wales, Queensland and South Australia.<br />
All producers affected will be eligible for this assistance and<br />
the Commonwealth will meet the cost of all expenditure in<br />
Western Australia above $ 1.5 million in 1977-78.<br />
The Commonwealth sympathises with the plight of the many<br />
producers affected by the drought.<br />
Mr. Fraser said " When natural disasters such as drought occur in<br />
a State, the Commonwealth stands ready to assist the State<br />
financially under the Natural Disaster Assistance Arrangements.<br />
The present assistance being given to New South Wales,<br />
Queensland, South Australia and Western Australia, are<br />
examples of the way in which the Commonwealth helps the<br />
States in such emergencies." </p>
