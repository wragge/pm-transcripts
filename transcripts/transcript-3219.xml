PRIME MINISTER PRESS RELEASE NO. 235<br />
23 April 1974<br />
STRUCTURAL ADJUSTMENT ASSISTANCE<br />
Cabinet today considered the policies to be pursued in future<br />
by the Australian Government in times of str'icl-lviral change. The<br />
details of the manpower program are currently being finalised by the<br />
Cochrane Committee, but the broad outlines of the ultimate scheme<br />
are clear. In the area of structural adjustment assistance to<br />
firms the Interdepartmental Committee has now reported and the<br />
Government has accepted their advice.<br />
Assistance to Individuals<br />
In the case of employees affected by structural change a combination<br />
of income maintenance, retraining and re-location expenses is to be<br />
allowed for. As foreshadowed in the case of the 25% tariff cut<br />
procedures, displaced employees are to be paid an amount equal to<br />
their average weekly earnings for the previous six months subject<br />
to a limit of 1 times average weekly earnings for a period of<br />
up to six months. As an alternative there will be available, on<br />
a voluntary basis, an early retirement scheme. In addition, there<br />
will be a comprehensive retraining program designed to equip<br />
employees with relevant skills. During the training period<br />
generous income maintenance is to be provided. Details of the<br />
retraining and the removal aspects of the scheme must await the<br />
Cochrane Committee Report.<br />
The scheme will be administered sufficiently flexibly for owners<br />
of small scale enterprises to be treated, if they so desire, as<br />
employees. Where it is possible, in terms of a simple set of<br />
criteria, for an employee to prove that he is unemployed as a<br />
result of a structurai change induced by Government policy,<br />
these benefits will supersede the usual unemployment benefits.<br />
The program will be administered flexibly and humanely by the<br />
Departments of Labour and Social Security. It will be of<br />
particular benefit to residents of country towns and to persons<br />
currently employed in declining industries.<br />
Assistance to Firms<br />
Assistance to firms in the Secondary Industry area will be<br />
administered by a special Adjustment Assistance Agency responsible<br />
to the Minister for Secondary Industry.<br />
Structural adjustment assistance is an innovation in industrial<br />
policy for Australia. The Government has decided to continually<br />
monitor the program at IDC level with a view to deciding whether<br />
the criteria for assistance decided upon today are adequate. In<br />
particular, the IDC will be charged with deciding, from time to<br />
time, whether structural adjustment due to Govdrnment initiatives<br />
should constitute the sole basis for justifying assistance. .2/ </p>
<p>-2-<br />
The scheme will involve closure grants where relevant,<br />
consultancy grants to help firms adjust to changed circumstances<br />
when that is relevant, or loan guarantees.<br />
Criteria for Assistance to Firms<br />
The criteria for eligibility for individual firms will be<br />
that the structural change had adversely affected, or<br />
was adversely affecting, the firm to the extent of<br />
rendering a significant separate part of its assets<br />
incapable of economic production; or that the desired<br />
change was unlikely to occur at a reasonable speed and<br />
at a reasonable economic cost without assistance to<br />
the firm; and<br />
that the firm had taken reasonable steps for self-help,<br />
but that this was unlikely to enable complete adjustment<br />
by the firm that the firm was unable to obtain<br />
finance on reasonable terms and conditions from normal<br />
commercial sources); and<br />
that generally-available measures had been utilised to<br />
the full but were inadequate.<br />
Consultancy grants for firms will be available on the basis of<br />
consultancy cost to a maximum of $ 10,000.,<br />
Closure compensation payments to firms will be subject to the<br />
following'conditions: closure compensation to be paid in respect of the loss in<br />
value of fixed assets and stocks rendered unproductive<br />
by the structural change and incapable of economic use<br />
elsewhere in the firm or an associated firm.<br />
claims for compensation to be within one . year of the<br />
occurrence of the structural change;<br />
payments to be on the basis of 85% of the difference<br />
between the written-down value of the assets for taxation<br />
purposes and their realised sales value.<br />
Loan guarantees will be available to firms as a special measure<br />
and subject to the following conditions:<br />
the provision of such guarantees to be covered by legislation;<br />
the concurrence of the Treasurer to be obtained;<br />
in relation to a particular line of activity loan guarantees<br />
to be subject to appropriate conditions 4nd should not be<br />
available in addition to closure compensation.<br />
This program will supersede all programs currently in existence. 3/ </p>
<p>Since coming to office, the Labor Government has been concerned<br />
to improve the allocation of resources in the Australian economy.<br />
It has sought to do this for two main reasons:<br />
inefficient allocation of resources, especially if it is<br />
due to unduly high tariff levels, induces high cost<br />
industries to proliferate, with attendant injustices to<br />
consumers; and<br />
( ii) an economy built on an inappropriate structure, given<br />
its resource base and pattern of skills, adjusts to<br />
changes in the economic climate too sluggishly.<br />
Good economic management in Austr~' lia will from time to time,<br />
therefore,' dictate Government-inspired moves which will require<br />
resources to move.-from one use to another. We have seen this<br />
in the past year in the revaluations and tariff cuts announced<br />
by the Government. In future, there will be similar transfers<br />
of resources needed to accommodate the Government's urban,<br />
regional, defence and technological goals.<br />
For sound economic and social reasons, the Government realises<br />
a mechanism is needed both to promote and make easier the process<br />
of structural change. Worthwhile economic development will be<br />
more rapid if a scheme exists to promote, via various incentives,<br />
the resource flows needed to implement the desired changes. For<br />
a Labor Government, however, there is a more important point. If<br />
changes are desirable in the national interest, it is essential<br />
that the nation, not the individuals affected, should foot the bill.<br />
Accordingly, in February 1973, the new Australian Government set in<br />
train two events. Under the leadership of the Department of Labor<br />
an expert group was set up to study the manpower programs essential<br />
to an efficient and humanitarian policy of economic. change. Under<br />
the leadership of the Department of Secondary Industry, a working<br />
group was established to study the needs of industry in times of<br />
structural change. Both groups were charged with the task of<br />
evolving a set of policies which would make the process of change<br />
more efficient, combined with the requirement that the individuals<br />
affected by change in the national interest should not be required<br />
to suffer financially.<br />
Some urgent structural changes could not wait on the deliberations<br />
of these two working groups. As a matter of principle, therefore,<br />
whenever during 1973 the Australian Government thought it necessary<br />
to initiate change by way of revaluations or tariff cuts it<br />
established generous, short-term specific adjustment programs.<br />
Notably in the case of the 25% tariff cut program, it was announced<br />
that the appropriate assistance measures were a prelude to a more<br />
general, permanent scheme. .4/ </p>
<p>-4-<br />
S . A eature of the Government's Adjustment Assistance<br />
Program is that related to employers. The Government has already<br />
spelled out its general philosophy with respect to industry.<br />
Continuing assistance is to be provided only after detailed and<br />
public inquiry by the Industries Assistance Commission.<br />
Efficiency and enterprise is to be encouraged by a variety of<br />
measures, notable among which are the establishment of a National<br />
Management School at the University of New South Wales and the<br />
setting up of a Small Business Bureau. The former, based on a<br />
report commissioned by the previous Government but never acted<br />
upon, is designed to foster new management skills in Australia,<br />
while the latter is intended to assist businessmen in marshalling<br />
the resources available to them.<br />
In the context of structural change the Government's new policies<br />
fit into the same philosophical frame-work. Emphasis is on<br />
encouraging the process of change, rather than simply compensating<br />
for loss of income. </p>
