STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MIR<br />
DEATH OF SENATOR OLIVE ZAKHAROV<br />
I was deeply saddened to hear of the untimely death of Olive Zakharov. On<br />
behalf of the Government and the Australian Labor Party I extend to Olive's<br />
family and friends my deepest sympathies.<br />
Throughout her life, Olive Zakharov showed a selfless and unwavering<br />
concern for and commitment to improving the welfare of Australian society.<br />
Her interests were many, and she will be remembered for the passion with<br />
which she strove for those things she believed in.<br />
With her tragic death the Australian community and the Labor Party have lost<br />
one of their most tireless fighters for social justice.<br />
Olive Zakharov was elected to the Senate in 1983 and represented the<br />
people of Victoria, especially the women of Victoria, with great skill and<br />
distinction. Her deep and abiding commitment to improving the legal and<br />
social position of women will be her legacy to Australia.<br />
From her own personal experience, Olive Zakharov knew the suffering of<br />
women who were victims of domestic violence and abuse. It was her<br />
understanding of the consequences of domestic abuse that enabled her to<br />
persuade government to do more to attack the causes of the problem.<br />
Olive Zakharov was also one of the earliest fighters in the struggle against<br />
HIV/ AIDS. She was an original member of the First Parliamentary Liaison<br />
Group on HIV/ AIDS. She actively supported the development of the First<br />
National HIV/ AIDS Strategy and the work of the Victorian AIDS Council and<br />
other community groups involved in HIV/ AIDS.<br />
Her invaluable contribution to the parliament and people of Australia was also<br />
shown in her role as Temporary Chairman of Committee's and she wrote as<br />
Chair of the Senate Standing Committee on Employment, Education and<br />
Training. She also served as a member of various other Senate Committees.<br />
Olive will be sadly missed.<br />
