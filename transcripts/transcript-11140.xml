<p>E&amp;OE....................................................................................................</p>
<p>Well ladies and gentlemen, I thought I would have this news conference</p>
<p> to elaborate a little on the outcome of yesterday's meeting in</p>
<p> Bali, and to answer your questions on that and any other matters.</p>
<p> Can I say that the meeting yesterday and the outcomes should be assessed</p>
<p> against the backdrop of two very important considerations.</p>
<p>The first of those was the enormous change in policy undertaken by</p>
<p> President Habibie in relation to East Timor. I said yesterday and</p>
<p> I repeat today that I don't believe in some quarters, indeed</p>
<p> in many quarters, that President Habibie has received as much credit</p>
<p> as he deserves in relation to that change of policy.</p>
<p>The other important element in the backdrop to yesterday's talks</p>
<p> and any assessment of them is the undeniable fact that our own Government's</p>
<p> view, and in particular my letter to Dr Habibie in December of last</p>
<p> year represented the catalyst for the change in the policy of the</p>
<p> Government of Indonesia towards East Timor. And it's very important</p>
<p> to keep both of those things in mind. Dr Habibie had the courage to</p>
<p> undertake a major change in policy, and that was in no small measure</p>
<p> the result of the direct urgings of the Coalition Government in December</p>
<p> of last year.</p>
<p>Yesterday's meeting was very important. I believe the outcome</p>
<p> was as much as could reasonably have been expected in all of the circumstances.</p>
<p> It is an issue that is very difficult. It is easy of simple flamboyant</p>
<p> rhetoric, but in the long run the greatest asset that Australia brings</p>
<p> to this issue is the influence that it can exert over the course of</p>
<p> Indonesian government policy. And having played a decisive role in</p>
<p> influencing the course of that policy a few months ago, it would have</p>
<p> been extraordinarily strange if Australia had abandoned the approach</p>
<p> yet once again trying to bring its influence to bear.</p>
<p>What everybody wants is a free and open choice so that the people</p>
<p> of East Timor can make a decision about their future. You can't</p>
<p> have that free and open choice if the circumstances of harassment</p>
<p> and intimidation and violence continue. That is why the commitments</p>
<p> made both before and at the meeting, and through the agreement at</p>
<p> the United Nations in relation to maintaining peace and relative stability</p>
<p> in East Timor are so important.</p>
<p>There has been a strong commitment made by the Indonesian government</p>
<p> to the holding of an open and clean ballot. Obviously the world will</p>
<p> suspend a judgement until those events take place. But I have no reason</p>
<p> to doubt the sincerity of the commitments that were made yesterday</p>
<p> by both President and also the other ministers who were present.</p>
<p>Australia was able to secure an acceleration of the opening of our</p>
<p> consulate in Dili. We were able to secure an acceptance by the Indonesian</p>
<p> government of an increased presence of agencies such as the International</p>
<p> Red Cross within Timor. And we were also able to secure other understandings</p>
<p> in relation to circumstances affecting the province.</p>
<p>So overall I think the outcome was very positive. It demonstrated</p>
<p> once again the capacity of this country to intelligently use its influence</p>
<p> in areas of the world where that influence really counts. And we do</p>
<p> have a particular, and a very close relationship with Indonesia and</p>
<p> I believe that the increased international focus on the issue that</p>
<p> derived from yesterday's meeting will itself make a contribution</p>
<p> towards ensuring that the free and open ballot that everybody wants</p>
<p> within East Timor does in fact take place.</p>
<p>It is also though important for people to remember that Indonesia</p>
<p> has a population of 211 million people. There are fewer than one million</p>
<p> people in East Timor. Indonesia's greatest problem is economic</p>
<p> stability. Indonesia's greatest challenge is to overcome the</p>
<p> economic difficulties into which it has been thrust by the Asian economic</p>
<p> downturn over the last couple of years. Australia has proved to be</p>
<p> a reliable, but not uncritical friend of Indonesia over a very considerable</p>
<p> period of time. And the value of being a close but not uncritical</p>
<p> friend was demonstrated very starkly, not only last week when I was</p>
<p> able to speak very directly and immediately to Dr Habibie, the speed</p>
<p> with which yesterday's meeting was arranged and the very positive</p>
<p> outcome, and the capacity that we have had to influence in a very</p>
<p> positive way, but also an understanding way, the course of events</p>
<p> so far as Indonesian policy is concerned. Any questions?</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, we hear the word "advisers" in terms of</p>
<p> police, but we heard from the Foreign Minister today that there could</p>
<p> be perhaps a hundred or several hundreds of these "advisers",</p>
<p> is this just a euphemism for police actually doing police work?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, police normally do police and ancillary sort of work. There's</p>
<p> nothing clever intended here. That was the language of the document.</p>
<p> The actual number which President Habibie and I yesterday agreed should</p>
<p> be adequate will be determined by the Secretary General of the United</p>
<p> Nations. We, as a possible contributor, will obviously be putting</p>
<p> a view to the Secretary General about an adequate number. I don't</p>
<p> know what it is, I'm not an expert on these matters, but I'll</p>
<p> get some expert advice.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>How confident are you that this special commission that's been</p>
<p> created within Indonesia can actually oversight some disarming?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I am more confident now than I was a week ago. I'm more confident</p>
<p> now than I was a few days ago. I mean, every time you get a renewed</p>
<p> public commitment, particularly in the presence of the leader of the</p>
<p> government of another country, every time there is a greater international</p>
<p> focus and spotlight on that public commitment the likelihood of that</p>
<p> public commitment being delivered on is increased. And I'm certainly</p>
<p> more confident now than what I was a few days ago and certainly more</p>
<p> confident than several weeks ago. Nobody pretends that this is an</p>
<p> easy situation and that total order and civility has returned overnight.</p>
<p> Nobody's arguing that. But what I think can be said, with growing</p>
<p> confidence, and that is that the Indonesian Government has made a</p>
<p> strong and repeated commitment at the highest level to allowing a</p>
<p> free and open vote and has signed itself up to a mechanism that is</p>
<p> far more likely to achieve that than any other mechanism that's</p>
<p> been around for a long time, and certainly far more likely to achieve</p>
<p> that than just noisy, rhetorical abuse with no particular purpose.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Do you think they can have a free and open vote without total disarmament?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, that is a hypothetical question in the sense that the Government</p>
<p> and the agreement and the agreement that the Government of Indonesia</p>
<p> signed involves a commitment to a free and open vote. It speaks of</p>
<p> a process of the laying down of arms. One of the difficulties in comprehensively</p>
<p> answering that question is that the document that the Indonesian Government's</p>
<p> committed itself to is not yet public. And I believe that when that</p>
<p> document does become public many of the concerns about the fullness</p>
<p> of the Government of Indonesia's commitment to a peaceful process,</p>
<p> a lot of those concerns will disappear.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, the vote, is it not, is for autonomy but not for independence?</p>
<p> Did the President re-state to you yesterday his view that if the autonomy</p>
<p> vote fails then the province will be given its independence?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes, he did. He stated that publicly. He uses the word separation,</p>
<p> which I understand. It means the same thing. There was no doubt at</p>
<p> all, either in our private discussions or in his public utterances,</p>
<p> that if the consultation, the vote  however you describe it</p>
<p>  goes against autonomy within Indonesia then the Government</p>
<p> of Indonesia will accept separation. That's been made very clear.</p>
<p> That is part of the agreement initialled in New York.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Mr Downer said this morning that the police, the Australian police,</p>
<p> who go would be armed only with their side arms. Is anyone in the</p>
<p> Government working on a set of rules of engagement or such should</p>
<p> Australian police see an atrocity occurring?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, we will get a whole lot of advice on that. I'm not in a</p>
<p> position to lay down the detail of it. Clearly work is already underway</p>
<p> in relation to that.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Given the high degree of conflict in the province historically, how</p>
<p> confident are you that the Australians who end up there won't</p>
<p> get caught up in any future hostility?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, there is always an element of risk when anybody goes into an</p>
<p> unsettled area, an area where hostilities have recently occurred and</p>
<p> are likely to occur in the future. There is always an element of risk</p>
<p> and it would be foolhardy of me and wrong of me to pretend that there's</p>
<p> never any element of risk. There is risk in, as we've sadly seen,</p>
<p> in recent times of aid workers who aren't involved in any kind</p>
<p> of police activity being put at risk and put in danger. There are</p>
<p> risks involved in people who are members of international organisations</p>
<p> working in any of the world's trouble spots. It is not uncommon</p>
<p> for Australia to contribute police in different areas of the world.</p>
<p> Quickly calling to mind, I think we've had police in Cambodia,</p>
<p> we've had them in Bougainville, we've had them in Somalia,</p>
<p> we've had them in Cyprus. I think we had them in Latin America</p>
<p> on one occasion. It's a very long list. And I would be foolhardy</p>
<p> to sort of say, no, there's absolutely no risk at all. Can I</p>
<p> say to you that in the discussions with the United Nations and in</p>
<p> the views we put about the size of the police presence, the civilian</p>
<p> police presence, and the circumstances surrounding them, we will naturally</p>
<p> be seeking to secure the maximum guarantees of safety and security</p>
<p> that can be secured in such a situation.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, the ACTU affiliates are meeting in Melbourne on Friday...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I'm sorry, who?</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>ACTU affiliates are meeting in Melbourne on Friday.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>ACTU affiliates, yes.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Unions affiliated with the ACTU...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I'm sorry, yes.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>...are meeting in Melbourne on Friday to discuss industrial action</p>
<p> which would disrupt both Indonesian airlines and shipping. Could that</p>
<p> damage the process at all?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I'll make a couple of observations about that. I don't</p>
<p> remember any of those stoppages in earlier years but we'll put</p>
<p> that aside for one moment. Well, I don't know what they're</p>
<p> going to do. I'll wait and see and then perhaps I'll make</p>
<p> a more detailed comment on it. But I'm not sure that inflicting</p>
<p> further economic pain on Indonesia necessarily helps the ordinary</p>
<p> people of that country or the people who live in East Timor. Remember</p>
<p> that East Timor has one of the lowest living standards of any part</p>
<p> of this world. And Indonesia itself has a very low living standard.</p>
<p> I'm not sure doing anything that increases economic pain and</p>
<p> inflicts more economic difficulty and adversity on the people of Indonesia</p>
<p> is particularly compassionate or helpful or intelligent. I don't</p>
<p> know that it really adds to an appropriate resolution of this issue.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>The medical team that you are proposing to send to East Timor, would</p>
<p> that be likely to come from the defence forces as other medical teams</p>
<p> have to....</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, not necessarily, once again I am not in possession of all of</p>
<p> the options that are available on that. It could be from the defence</p>
<p> forces, it may be arranged and recruited in a purely private way.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>[inaudible] international ...continuance that Indonesia may well</p>
<p> just decide to walk away from East Timor, simply give up on it?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, that really is a question that would be exercising the minds,</p>
<p> I guess, of a lot of people in Indonesia. Not surprisingly at various</p>
<p> stages Indonesian figures and leaders have said, as I said a moment</p>
<p> ago, there are 211 million people in the entire republic, there's</p>
<p> fewer than one million in East Timor. Now, plainly things have happened</p>
<p> there that are not to the credit of the Indonesian Government or the</p>
<p> Indonesian armed forces. And that is the cause of international concern</p>
<p> and that is understood and I certainly understand that, and I understand</p>
<p> that concern and I am part of that concern. On the other hand, the</p>
<p> Government of the Republic has huge problems that affect the whole</p>
<p> of Indonesia and I think people have got to bear that in mind in balancing</p>
<p> the approach and measuring the approach that they take.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Are you confident that the Indonesian Government can bring back under</p>
<p> control the elements of ABRI that you have....</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>You're unfamiliar to me, will you give me your name?</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>John Mair from Reuters.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Where are you from?</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Reuters.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>And what's your name?</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>John Mair.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>How are you?</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Good. I was wondering, are you confident that the Indonesian Government</p>
<p> has control of the elements of the military that you have previously</p>
<p> expressed concern about their actions in East Timor?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>There is no doubt that there has been a quantum shift so far as the</p>
<p> assertion of control both in relation to the military by the Government</p>
<p> and also the central control of the military in relation to its activities</p>
<p> in East Timor. Ask me to micro-define that, I can't, I don't</p>
<p> have enough knowledge. But I am certainly satisfied from what's</p>
<p> happened publicly from the presence yesterday of General Wiranto,</p>
<p> his participation in the discussions and the general attitude taken</p>
<p> by Dr Habibie but there is a realisation that things had to change,</p>
<p> that things have begun to change. How far they've changed, how</p>
<p> effective that change has been is obviously something that we have</p>
<p> to see unfold.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, how can you maintain the confidence given that even</p>
<p> with General Wiranto's presence at a peace ceremony in the territory</p>
<p> itself still the atrocities continue and there hasn't been a</p>
<p> disarming of the militia?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, the confidence that I expressed was a confidence that things</p>
<p> were infinitely better than they were a week or two weeks ago. People</p>
<p> have been running around asking me for guarantees. I can't give</p>
<p> absolute guarantees, nobody can and it's a really ridiculous</p>
<p> question for anybody to ask an Australian Prime Minister. Because</p>
<p> in the end we are dealing with a sovereign nation and you have two</p>
<p> alternatives when you are dealing with a sovereign nation, you either</p>
<p> seek to use your influence over them or you attack them or perhaps</p>
<p> the third alternative you just completely ignore the problem. Now,</p>
<p> we have no intention of adopting either the second or third alternatives</p>
<p> so we are left with the first alternative. And that is what I have</p>
<p> been endeavouring to do and that is what I believe with a reasonable</p>
<p> level of success I have been able to do particularly over the last</p>
<p> week.</p>
<p>But if you are saying to me, can I give you a rolled gold absolute</p>
<p> guarantee? Of course I can't and it's a ridiculous question</p>
<p> to ask of me or to even infer that I can give. What I can say to you,</p>
<p> that is judged on my discussions yesterday with Dr Habibie, the views</p>
<p> of my two Ministers who accompanied me, the views of our officials</p>
<p> who went there, the discussions I had with him over the phone, all</p>
<p> the other assessments and advice I have got I believe the situation</p>
<p> now is a lot better and it has a lot greater chance of being successful</p>
<p> and it is far more likely now that we are going to have a free and</p>
<p> open act of choice. Now, that is a very significant development. Now,</p>
<p> I....if you regard that as my being confident well they are your</p>
<p> words. I can only tell you as I assess it and as I feel it and I just</p>
<p> go back to my opening remark that a year ago nobody was talking about</p>
<p> a vote, a year ago nobody was talking about a UN supervised ballot,</p>
<p> certainly nobody in the Indonesian Government was. And our predecessors</p>
<p> who are fairly free with their advice at the moment, they had 13 years</p>
<p> to persuade the Indonesian Government to bring about a change of policy</p>
<p> in relation to East Timor and my recollection and observation is that</p>
<p> they didn't even seriously try let alone succeed.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, Labor, the Greens and the Democrats have today jointly</p>
<p> released their own draft Constitutional preamble....</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Have they, I haven't seen it. What does it contain?</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Well, it's markedly, significantly different from yours, it contains....</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>That surprises me immensely. What is it, a joint one is it?</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes. It's good to see the Greens and the Democrats acting independently</p>
<p> of the Labor Party.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Well, are you prepared to take up on any of the themes that they....</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I haven't even seen it.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Are you amenable to sitting down with them and talking about....</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I'll have a look at what they have had to say and I'll</p>
<p> have a look at what they have had to say.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>I think you've said Friday is the deadline of submissions to</p>
<p> you, will you be releasing them?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Do you want to see them all?</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Ask a journalist a question and you'll always get an answer,</p>
<p> yes.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>[Inaudible]</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Oh look, I'll take that question on notice and think about it.</p>
<p> And, I mean, some of them are...might be worth releasing, yes.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Can I just return to Indonesia for a minute?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes, certainly.</p>
