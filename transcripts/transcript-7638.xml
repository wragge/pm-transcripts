PRIME MINISTER<br />
CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOREIGN CORRESPONDENTS ASSOCIATION OF AUSTRALIA<br />
SYDNEY 14 JUNE 1989<br />
on Friday I will be departing on an overseas visit that will<br />
take me to France, the United Kingdom, the United States,<br />
the Federal Republic of Germany and Hungary.<br />
The visit, which concludes on Monday 3 July, is an important<br />
one for Australia.<br />
It follows my earlier visits to Moscow, with a stopover in<br />
Japan, in December 1987, to Washington in June 1988 and to<br />
the ROK, Thailand, Pakistan and India in February of this<br />
year. I had planned to go to China in October but, as you know,<br />
the tragic and brutal repression of the pro-democracy<br />
protestors in Beijing has ruled that out.<br />
All these visits are carefully timed elements of a<br />
consistent pattern of personal diplomacy.<br />
As well as pursuing essential bilateral issues, my overseas<br />
travel is always carefully calculated to provide Australia<br />
with linkages at the highest level into the key global<br />
political and economic centres centres which have an<br />
important influence on the shaping of events directly<br />
relevant to Australia and our region.<br />
This forthcoming visit is a further element in this strategy<br />
and has been carefully tailored to coincide with a number of<br />
key events and developments.<br />
The Bush Administration has now been in office for six<br />
months and has substantially completed its review of foreign<br />
policy. The United States of course remains central to<br />
Australia's foreign policy and defence interests and is the<br />
world's largest single economy.<br />
The NATO Summit has just been held and important disarmament<br />
proposals outlined by Presidents Gorbachev and Bush are on<br />
the table. </p>
<p>EC Heads of Government are meeting on 26-27 June an<br />
important step on the way to the proposed 1992 Single<br />
Market. Three of the countries I am visiting are leading<br />
members of the EC. France will, in fact, be taking over the<br />
EC Presidency from 1 July.<br />
The G7 group of countries will be meeting in Paris on<br />
14-16 July. Four of the countries on my itinerary are G7<br />
members. The United Kingdom has very important historical and other<br />
ties with Australia, and a highlight of my visit will be the<br />
unprecedented range of ministerial talks, covering foreign<br />
affairs and trade, defence and industry and commerce.<br />
The Federal Republic of Germany is at a focal point in<br />
East-West relations.<br />
France is in the midst of celebrating the bicentenary of an<br />
event central to the development of liberal democratic<br />
thought the French Revolution.<br />
Despite the severe jolt the events in China have given to<br />
the very positive changes taking places around the world,<br />
these changes are continuing elsewhere, including in Eastern<br />
Europe, where Hungary is at the forefront of change.<br />
The Australian Government has been continuing its process of<br />
economic reform and it is important that this be understood<br />
at the highest levels of our key trading partners.<br />
We have also made firm decisions in respect of the<br />
Antarctic, which are of direct interest to the five<br />
countries I am visiting, four of which are active members of<br />
the Antarctic Treaty System.<br />
So for all these reasons, this visit will be a very<br />
important one, coming at a critical time in world affairs<br />
and dealing with issues of great significance for Australia.<br />
While I have previously visited France, the UK and the<br />
United States, I have not visited the FRG as Prime Minister<br />
and my visit to Hungary will be the first ever by an<br />
Australian Prime Minister.<br />
I have previously met the leaders of the United States, the<br />
UK, France and the FRG. All four Mr Bush, Mrs Thatcher,<br />
Mr Rocard and Chancellor Kohl are people for whom I have a<br />
great deal of respect and with whom I enjoy good personal<br />
relations. They are all people with whom I can talk frankly<br />
and discuss substantive issues in detail, even where our<br />
views do not always coincide.<br />
While I have yet to meet the leadership in Hungary I am<br />
looking forward to meeting people who are, with obvious<br />
courage and vision, tackling such a crucial task of reform. </p>
<p>It would not be proper to go into detail now about the<br />
discussions I will be having overseas; but there is a number<br />
of topics of obvious significance on which I will be very<br />
keen to hear the views of my hosts and to put Australia's<br />
views. I will be discussing with all leaders their perception of<br />
the very positive changes that have taken place in East-West<br />
relations and the changes that are taking place in Eastern<br />
Europe. It is important in terms of our own political and economic<br />
interests that, wherever possible, these changes be given<br />
constructive and positive encouragement.<br />
Events in China are still unfolding, but I will naturally be<br />
exchanging views with my counterparts about the possible<br />
implications of developments there for the wider region and<br />
beyond. Other key issues include:<br />
The developments in arms control in Europe, especially<br />
the proposals put forward by Presidents Bush and<br />
Gorbachev; Global disarmament issues, especially the need for all<br />
countries to pursue actively matters relating to nuclear<br />
non-proliferation;<br />
A chemical weapons convention and-the Government<br />
Industry Conference on Chemical Weapons to be held in<br />
Australia later this year;<br />
Strategic change in the Asia-Pacific region with<br />
particular reference to China, Indo China and<br />
Afghanistan; Developments in the Pacific;<br />
The Middle East peace process and the tragic fighting<br />
going on in Lebanon;<br />
Southern Africa and the need to maintain pressure on<br />
South Africa to end its abhorrent apartheid policies.<br />
One further, and very crucial, issue, which will recur<br />
throughout the visit, will be the environment.<br />
As I suggested earlier, I will be outlining in the clearest<br />
terms Australia's concern to prevent mining in the Antarctic<br />
and the need to provide a comprehensive environmental<br />
protection plan for that continent.<br />
Matters such as afforestation, the ozone layer and the<br />
greenhouse effect will also feature prominently in my<br />
discussions, especially against the background of the recent<br />
Hague Declaration and the London Ozone Conference. </p>
<p>My discussion of these issues will be particularly relevant.,<br />
given the Government's forthcoming major statement on the<br />
Environment. Environmental concerns are global and cut<br />
across national boundaries, and it is important that our own<br />
policies take account of the international dimension.<br />
In addition to these global and regional issues, there are<br />
equally vital issues at stake in this visit for Australia's<br />
specific economic and trade interests.<br />
Over the years, Australia of course has placed very great<br />
emphasis on our links with our Asia-Pacific region. But<br />
that emphasis in no way detracts from, and should not be<br />
seen as in any way excluding, our older, and still vital<br />
ties with Europe.<br />
Some trade and investment statistics demonstrate this very<br />
clearly. The United States, the UK, West Germany and France were, in<br />
1988, all among our top 12 trading partners.<br />
The United States was Australia's second largest trading<br />
partner with the total value of two-way trade a little over<br />
$ 13.5 billion. The UK was our third largest trading partner<br />
with total trading in excess of $ 4.6 billion, the FRG fifth,<br />
at $ 3.9 billion and France eleventh, at a little over $ 2<br />
billion. Between them, the United States, the UK, the FRG and France<br />
provided, in 1987-88, a combined stock of foreign investment<br />
in Australia of over $ 91 billion or just under half the<br />
total stock of about $ 190 billion in foreign investment in<br />
Australia. The UK and the United States were ranked first and second<br />
respectively, with investments in Australia worth $ 44<br />
billion and $ 39 billion. The FRG is ranked sixth with<br />
almost $ 6.5 billion, while France is ranked thirteenth with<br />
a little over $ 1.5 billion.<br />
As for Australian investment abroad, just under half is<br />
located in the United States and the UK a combined total<br />
of about $ 31 billion.<br />
West Germany and France are of lesser, but still<br />
substantial, importance as locations of Australian<br />
investment. Hungary is not, of course, a major trading partner but I am<br />
confident that there are significant prospects for Australia<br />
business in that country, especially with the rapid process<br />
of reform taking place and the keenness of its leadership to<br />
be integrated into the global economy. </p>
<p>These figures speak for themselves. The economic policies<br />
pursued by the countries I am visiting are of very direct<br />
relevance to Australia in a real and practical sense.<br />
So it is important that on this visit I will be discussing,<br />
first, the outlook for the international economy, with<br />
particular reference to the policy settings that we believe<br />
ought to be pursued by G7 members.<br />
Second, and of great importance, I will be discussing the<br />
need for countries to continue pursuing reform of the<br />
multilateral trading system.<br />
Australia's views on the protectionist policies of Europe<br />
and the US, especially in regard to subsidisation of farm<br />
products, are well known. I can assure you that I will not<br />
be wasting the opportunity this trip provides to repeat<br />
those views forcefully, both in public and in private.<br />
I note as well that one of the countries I am visiting<br />
Hungary is of course, a member of the Cairns Group which<br />
has played such an important role in the current GATT round<br />
of negotiations.<br />
I will also be making clear our interest in a liberalised<br />
and open Single Market in 1992.<br />
Finally, regional economic cooperation in Asia/ Pacific,<br />
which very directly involves the US and is of considerable<br />
interest to EC countries, will also feature on the agenda of<br />
my talks.<br />
In addition to these important policy questions my visit<br />
will have a very practical focus by providing Australian<br />
business with further opportunities to pursue their<br />
interests. In London I will be opening a Trade and Investment<br />
Conference which will be attended by almost 300 business<br />
leaders from the UK and Australia. This is the largest<br />
Conference of its kind held between the two countries and, I<br />
am confident, will be an important factor in the further<br />
promotion of our already important economic relationship.<br />
In Paris, Bonn and Budapest I will be accompanied by a<br />
smaller group of Australian business executives from some of<br />
Australia's leading companies. They will not only have an<br />
opportunity to talk to their business counterparts but will<br />
have direct access to the economic decision-makers of these<br />
countries. It is important for Australian companies to take an<br />
increasingly global perspective to their operations and<br />
nowhere is this more obvious than in the lead-up to the<br />
European Single Market. </p>
<p>6.<br />
At the same time, my Government is keen to encourage foreign<br />
investment in Australia, especially in the manufacturing and<br />
the high-tech areas, and this is something I will be taking<br />
up directly with the Government and business leaders of the<br />
countries I visit.<br />
In summary, this is an important visit for Australia,<br />
whether you consider the economic, political or security<br />
aspects of it. At this important time, Australia must make<br />
its presence felt, must make its views known, and must do<br />
what it can to build a world in which our values shared<br />
values of democracy, freedom, and multilateralism can<br />
thrive and prosper. </p>
