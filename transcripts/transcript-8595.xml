PRIME MINJISTER<br />
Joint Statement by the Prime Minister the Hon P J Keating MP<br />
and the minister for Employment, Education and Training, the<br />
Hon K C Beazley MP<br />
A National Employment and Training Plan for<br />
YOUNG AUSTRALIANS<br />
The Federal Government has laid the foundations for a strong<br />
revival in job opportunities for young people with a<br />
comprehensive package of new training and employment measures.<br />
The Prime Minister, Mr Keating, and the Minister for<br />
Employment, Education and Training, Mr Beazley, today finalised<br />
the details of a new national employment and training plan for<br />
all young Australians.<br />
It builds on the historic decision last week in co-operation<br />
with the States and Territories to establish the'Australian<br />
National Training Authority and on the broad indti-stry and<br />
community support demonst~ rated so effectively at the successful<br />
National Meeting on Youth Employment and Training.<br />
Mr Keating and Mr Beazley detailed the plan which will see<br />
government expenditure of $ 297.2 million in 1992-93 and $ 767.2<br />
million over three years and will help almost 100,000 young<br />
people during the course of 1993..<br />
The plan is driven by the Government's desire to lift the<br />
burden of unemployment from the shoulders of Australia's youth<br />
and to eliminate it as much as possible from the national<br />
economy.<br />
To that end the Government will provide every long term<br />
unemployed teenager with the opportunity to find a place in the<br />
job market. Support for other young people will also be<br />
expanded. And in addition to programs outlined in One Nation,<br />
in the Budget the Government will address additional specific<br />
measures for all unemployed. </p>
<p>The key features of the package are:<br />
. An offer to all long-term unemployed young people of a six<br />
month vocational training course, with a JOBSTART funded place<br />
on completion, giving _ employrs a wage__ subsidy to employ a<br />
young person, with funding provided for 35,000 places;<br />
. A milestone change for flexibility in pay and training<br />
arrangements for young people with the creation of a new Career<br />
Start Traineeship, designed by the government and the ACTO and<br />
set up under a single Federal award to target early school<br />
leavers, amongst the most disadvantaged of job seekers;<br />
An expansion of SkillShare and JOBTRAIN and their link to<br />
a wage subsidy for a job beyond training;<br />
A new Landcare and Environment Action Program offering<br />
young peo'l emplbyment experience in environmental and<br />
conservation projects;<br />
Increased subsidies to additional traineeships and support<br />
for apprentices;<br />
A further 12,000 pre-vocational TAFE courses in 1993;<br />
$ 43.6 million over three years to underpin the development<br />
of the new-entry level training arrangements for the<br />
Australian Vocational Certificate recommended in the<br />
Carmichael Report;<br />
$ 48.6 million over three years to fund places in<br />
Carmichael pilots and the new Career Start Traineeships.<br />
The measures in the package, combined with the existing labour<br />
market programs and the opportunities now available in<br />
universities and vocational education, provide a positive<br />
option of employment, education or training for young<br />
Australians. Details of the package are set out in the attachments.<br />
Mr Keating said the plan was the most comprehensive ever<br />
assembled by any government and confronted the fundamental<br />
concerns facing Australia's young people.<br />
Firstly, it provided young unemployed with jobs NOW and also<br />
increased significantly opportunities for immediate training.<br />
Secondly, looking to the future, it provided the infrastructure<br />
by which young people will acquire the skills, competence and<br />
confidence they will need to succeed in tomorrow's workplace.<br />
He said one of the keys to a sustained revival of job<br />
opportunities for young people was in the implementation of the<br />
new Australian Vocational Certificate ( AVC) and its application<br />
to employers across the country. </p>
<p>" The move to the new system will be undertaken through a series<br />
of pilots. All pilot schemes of sufficient quality put to the<br />
government will be funded. We are already impressed by the<br />
willing response of so many of Australia's leading employers<br />
and trade unions to this offer," he said.<br />
Mr Keating said the Government, in cooperation with the ACTU<br />
and employers, will develop a new Career Start Traineeship<br />
( CST).<br />
" This new form of traineeship will enhance the flexibility of<br />
the existing Australian Traineeship System and provide a bridge<br />
in implementing the Carmichael Report. A new national award<br />
will be established to assist in providing quick access to the<br />
new and more flexible arrangements," he said.<br />
Mr Beazley said the CST, the pilot programs and the development<br />
of the AVC training system will transform the approaches to<br />
vocational training in Australia.<br />
" Together, the measures will better prepare our young people<br />
for the rapidly changing world of the workplace and are<br />
essential to create the more highly skilled workforce we<br />
require to increase our living standards," he said.<br />
The employment and training plan for young Australians also<br />
includes a range of immediate measures to assist unemployed<br />
young people into jobs and training courses designed to lead to<br />
jobs. The Prime Minister said that all teenagers who are unemployed<br />
for a year or more would be offered an accredited training<br />
course in either a TAFE or similar training institution. Upon<br />
completion of the course, young people will be able to use a<br />
JOBSTART card to find employment. The JOBSTART card will<br />
inform employers of the subsidy they can receive if they employ<br />
that young person.<br />
This subsidy presently ranges from $ 70 a week up to $ 230 a week<br />
depending on age and duration of unemployment.<br />
" This offer will provide the key to a job that many young<br />
unemployed are looking for," Mr Keating said.<br />
" In contrast John Hewson offers only a wage cut for all young<br />
people," he said.<br />
Today Mr Keating also announced the establishment of a new<br />
Landcare and Environment Action Program to provide young people<br />
with vocational training while working in land care,<br />
conservation, environment protection and cultural heritage<br />
activities. Such a program received strong endorsement at the<br />
Youth Meeting. In 1993, this program is expected to involve at<br />
least 6,000 young Australians. </p>
<p>The Plan also includes the expansion of existing programs such<br />
as JOBTRAIN, SkillShare and JOBSTART to provide for wider<br />
access for young people to integrated packages of training and<br />
wage subsidy. These programs will assist an extra 15,800 young<br />
people in 1993.<br />
Mr Beazley said existing measures that have been successful in<br />
halting the dramatic decline in apprenticeship and traineeship<br />
numbers will now continue to be available to employers until<br />
the end of June 1993. New measures, including extra incentives<br />
to employers hiring additional trainees and a package of<br />
measures to allow group training schemes to take on additional<br />
apprentices and trainees will also assist young people into<br />
jobs and avoid the possibility of skill shortages developing as<br />
the economy recovers.<br />
The Government will also provide an additional 1,650<br />
traineeship opportunities for young people through expanded<br />
intakes into the Departments of Social Security and Employment,<br />
Education and Training, as well as ensuring that the target of<br />
trainees constituting at least 25 per cent of all base grade<br />
recruitment is achieved in other Commonwealth agencies.<br />
Together these range of apprenticeship and traineeship measures<br />
will assist some 24,700 young people in 1993.<br />
Finally, the package includes a range of measures designed to<br />
assist particularly disadvantaged young people who are at risk<br />
of either failing to complete school education, or simply being<br />
unable to take advantage of the opportunities made available by<br />
the Government.<br />
