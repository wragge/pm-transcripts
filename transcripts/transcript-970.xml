JOURNALISTS' CLUB 2' TH ANNIVERSARY DINNER<br />
SYDNEY. N. S. W. 31 st JULY. 1964+<br />
Speech by the Prime Minister, the Rt. Hon. Sir Robert Menzies<br />
Sir, It is a very difficult and dangerous thing for a<br />
politico to make a speech to newspapermen. ( Laughter)<br />
Something you said reminded me of the fact that quite a number<br />
of years ago, but after the occasion to which Ken Slessor<br />
referred I was given a dinner this seems most improbable<br />
but still it's true by some newspapermen when I was in<br />
Melbourne. It was a very, vezy good dinner7 and there was<br />
a certain amount of lubricant ( Laughter) available and I was<br />
no doubt adequately lubricated but others were more so, and<br />
at a certain stage in the night I remember a well-known<br />
newspaperman coming along and standing over me as I sat in an<br />
armchair and saying " You and he was rather tedious<br />
abcut This, He kept on. ( Laufh er) He kept on, he kept on.<br />
It was like a slipped disc. ( Laughter) " You know the trouble<br />
with you is that you don't suffer fools gladly." ( Laughter)<br />
( Applause) Much to my credit, I found myself saying, " And<br />
what do you think I've been doing for the past fifteen minutes?"<br />
( Laughter) Well, the Press and I have always understood each<br />
other. i4e've always been a bit hostile. ( Laughter) We've<br />
enjoyed a ceetain amount of hostility. We've loved it, and<br />
every now and tiien I found myself reading one of my favourite<br />
columnists and Ive read him and I haven't dared to say how<br />
good he was because I knew that in that field, fur every friend<br />
you make, you make three enemies, ( Laughter)<br />
But I'm delighted to be here. I had forgotten that<br />
it was twentyfive years ago that as a young and promising man<br />
but perhaps not so promising as I am now,( Laughter) ( Applause3<br />
Itd gone to Pfahlerb's Hotel..... Do you mind if I tell you<br />
something about PfahleriTs Hotel? ( Laughter) Not that I<br />
pretend to qualify as an extremely bibulous creature, but many<br />
years ago, as it seems to me now, I was a great friend I am<br />
happy to say, of Lionel Lindsay and I had met Norman Lindsay<br />
a few times and we had a natter about this and that and there<br />
was a dinner of some learned society you know, the artists<br />
and architects and what-have-you, at Pfahlert's and I was a<br />
guest. That afternoon I was around talking to Norman Lindsay.<br />
He wasn't a guest, and I having that degree of impudence w. hat<br />
maker a man a Prime Minister ( Laughter) said " Norman, you must<br />
come tonight to Pfahlert's hotel. " Oh, no," with the wellknown<br />
Lindsay voice. " But", I said, " You must come Norman,<br />
you must. Lionel is going to be there." ( Laughter3 And he<br />
said, " Oh, well, yes, old man," and I dragged him along.<br />
Whoever was presiding at this dinner, he was as kind<br />
as he could be. He just put it down to the eccentricity of a<br />
politician, and I arranged with him that I would sit here and<br />
Norman would sit there and Lionel would sit there. Well, now,<br />
truth be admitted, they hadn't spoken to each other for about<br />
five or six years, and I had an idea about this, so thoro they<br />
were. With a suitable interjection by me? like a fellow putting<br />
a rather stupid question at a press interview ( Laughter), ( you<br />
all know what I mean by that) ( Laughter) they got cracking. </p>
<p>-2-<br />
They were going fifty to the dozen, right through the dinner.<br />
The next day I went out to see Lionel, who was a particular<br />
friend of mine, at his house at dahroonga and I said, " Lionel,<br />
I thought that went rather well, last night, you and Norman."<br />
" Oh yes, old man," he said, and you won't understand this unless<br />
you know the Lindsays, he said, " Quite right. Very good fellow<br />
Norman, but the only t√±' ouble is that he talks too much." ( Laughter)<br />
Now, Sir, the second thing I want to say is that by the<br />
great kindness of my deplorable press secretary, Ray Maley<br />
( Applause) whose restoration to health pleases me beyond words<br />
( hear, hear) ( Applause), I was given a copy of the journal<br />
what was it called " Copy", a rather restrained title, so unlike<br />
the headlines tc which I am accustomed but anyhow, I read this<br />
with loving care and therefore I am able to tell you that I share<br />
your pleasure in the fact that since 1941 Snakey Smith has not<br />
been with us. ( Laughter) I didntt know Snakey Smith. I suspect<br />
he was a fellow a bit like me. ( Laughter) Anyhow, Snakey Smith<br />
was turfed out, I don't remember reading in the newspapers<br />
about Snakey Smith being turfed out ( Laughter); I dontt remember<br />
a great cause c6lbre having arisen over Snakey Smith's<br />
expulsion. I donut remember about the rules of natural justice<br />
having been violated, ( Laughter) You know really, you are<br />
terrible, except, I suppose, that you have to take orders.<br />
( laughter) Anyhow, Snakey is not with us.<br />
Then I began to say to myself " Well now, I have had a<br />
good deal of experience of this and that anA I began to think<br />
about that greai; art of reporting now so neglected ( Laughter) and<br />
my mind went back to earlier pulitical days, Now there are<br />
very few of you here who don't know and recognise hive Turnbull<br />
( hear, hear) ( Applause). Now would you allow me to say that I<br />
think Clive Turnbull was one of the greatest reporters. I know<br />
that he is a man of singular talent in many fields and one of<br />
the greatnst reporters in my lifetime. ( Hear, hear) ( Applause)<br />
The moment I began to think about it, I remembered that<br />
in 1932 there was an election in Victoria this is before some<br />
of you were born. But anyhow, there was an election in Victoria<br />
and my crowd were about to win. It does happen occasionally.<br />
( Laughter) For the oni_ time in my life, I was returned<br />
unopposed a rather depressing experience for the electorate<br />
of Nunawading in Victoria. Therefore, Sir Stanley Argyle who<br />
was the leader of my side said, " Well, would you go out and do<br />
a series of meetings around the country?" This was my first<br />
barn-storming tour.<br />
In those days, of course, the perquisites of office were<br />
not all that good ( Iaughter), and so I drove my own car and I had<br />
my wife with me in the front seat, and in the back seat a spare<br />
wheel and Clive Turnbull. ( Laughter) Clive was sent ouZ by the<br />
Melbourne " Argus" which was then in its heyday, and so there we<br />
were. We went around, we drove to Warnnambool, Hamilton, Ararat<br />
and Great Western and Stawell, and Clive was there at the back<br />
with that rather humorous chuckling sound of his. The amazing<br />
thing about this man was that although we had gone to meeting<br />
after meeting and I had said all the usual things and the<br />
audience had either been bored or not so bored, as the case may<br />
be olive would send in a column for the " Argus" which not<br />
only-and I would like you boys to make a note of this<br />
contained a fairly accurate idea of what I had said with a<br />
commendable brevity that I couldn't coimand ( Laughter but also<br />
by a few little brush strokes this was brilliant conveyed<br />
the atmosphere of the meeting. Now this seemed to me to be / 3 </p>
<p>-3-<br />
the greatest exercise in reporting I'd ever known, and looking<br />
back on it I still think it was. The few little smudgy strokes<br />
which let the reader know something of the quality and character<br />
of the meeting. So as the time went on on this journey, I<br />
conceived quite an alfection for Clive. There he was in the<br />
back seat of the car with the spare wheel ( Laughter) on the<br />
left, and my poor wile sitting there, and I am sitting here<br />
driving. I made a powerful speech in the morning at Ararat, If<br />
you have been there, you will know Ararat no not JeDarit but<br />
at Ararat the platform, the stage is the highest in the world.<br />
It's about as high as the wall, so that when you spoke tc your<br />
audience being lucky to get one ( laughter) you peered over,<br />
like a man peering over the precipice. It uas really terrible.<br />
Anyhow we got through it. I made a powerful speech. It perhaps<br />
didn't mean very much, and then we drove on.<br />
The afternoon meeting was to be at three o'clock at Great<br />
Western. You know, Gr3au Western champagne..... Great Western<br />
this and that, and Great Western is a lovely little hamlet on<br />
which th'e sun falls pleasantly, in which, so far as I have been<br />
abJe to observe, nothing ever haopens tut on my paper it said,<br />
" Three o'clock Gre&amp; t Western." So eing the :, lave of the<br />
clock. I arrived at five to three. I pulled up my car with my<br />
wife ' the spare wheel anc' Clive Turnbull, and we identified the<br />
local hall, wnich is not difficult in a place like Great Western,<br />
and at about ten past three, I said, " Well, it doe.-. ntt loolk like<br />
a meating" and at twentyfive past three, a very earnest-locking<br />
man arrived. It might have been a Journalist for all I Imew, but<br />
anyhow, he was very serious√∏ He walked to the place and he<br />
unlocked the door so I hopped out of the chariot and said, " Well,<br />
excuse me, but there is a meeting, isn't there?" He said,<br />
" 0h, yes, a meeting this afternoon. Wbat is your namesir?"<br />
I said, " My name is Menzies" o He said " Oh yes, youtre speaking,"<br />
I said, " You couldntt be more right, but is there a meeting?"<br />
" Oh yes," he said, " That's all right," I said. " The moting was<br />
for three o'clock and it is now twentyfive past, what about it?"<br />
He said, " Oh, don't worry about that. Come in." So I walked<br />
in and there was this little anteroom of the Great Western hall<br />
with seats for twelve per. re. In those days, I was more<br />
ambitious than I am now, and I said, " Twelve people?" He said,<br />
" Yes, that's right. Twelve people. They'll be here." " uat" 9<br />
I said, " Now, wait a moment. It's now half past three." " 0h,<br />
well," he said, " You know. The boys dontt hurry along in these<br />
parts. This is a wine-growing district,"<br />
Well, now, I must tell you I was supporting a rather<br />
battered veteran of my party who didntt quite know what it was<br />
all about at this time and therefore had to be concealed and there<br />
was a Country Party candidate I refer to this with great<br />
deference and there was a Labour man. Well, we went in and<br />
I had a look and I said, " Well, yes, twelve people." Then at<br />
about a quarter to four, the audience began to arrive and believe<br />
it or not, by four oclock, we had eleven people there and my<br />
poor wife was there and Clive Turnbull with a pad, you know,<br />
already to report this exciting event. Then the local man said,<br />
" Excuse me, Sir, I will go and get the chairman."<br />
He galloped along the road a hundred yards and collected<br />
the chairman from the bar parlour ( Laughter). The chairman<br />
arrived and I must say that the chairman had been rather overtrained<br />
( Laughter) because he came in between a hiccup and a<br />
hiccup and he sat there in the chair. Then he said, looking at<br />
me, " All right, ladget going" and the lad got goingand I made<br />
0000/ 1+ </p>
<p>a speech. You must it doesn't matter whether the audience is<br />
eleven or a thousand, you must speak your piece. But each time<br />
I said this is a long time ago, you understand " a thousand",<br />
he used to give a little hiccup and say " millions" ( Laughter)<br />
and so I went along this millionaire course in this speech and<br />
then I, very courteously, as my habit is, said " Any questions"<br />
and two of the eleven had a question to put and eachi time my<br />
answer was amended by the chairman who increased it quantitatively<br />
by saying1 " No, no, Make it millions" and so we finished. At<br />
the end, the chairman, who by this time war quite incapabla, of<br />
rising from his chair ( I have a feeling most of you will<br />
understand) ( Laughter3 said " Ladies and gentlemen. Tile besh<br />
young candidate I ever hearA' and~. I gave a bit of a smirk, a..-id<br />
so we got out and we went to T* Uhe footpath where I had my car,<br />
with my wife, and Clive Turnbull andi the spare wheel,<br />
This old boy came over and said, " Excuse me Mr. Mac,<br />
but would you like to come along and have a bit of a Arink Cat<br />
the corner?" I said " Well, it's very kind of you, : M~ t I am<br />
due to make a speech In Stawell tonight". Oh, I'm sorry, Mr.<br />
Mac but you know, Mrs Mac? you are the test candidate I ever<br />
stood l'r." 1 You knaow, I in not very accustomed to this kind<br />
of flattery ( Laughter) and thereforo I gave t1,9 nearest approach<br />
to a smirk that a fellow like me can make. So I said, " 1Itm<br />
terribly sorry" and we drove off and a quartar of a mile along<br />
the road. to Stawell I pulled up the car and said, " Gosh, I<br />
just remembered, Do you know that my candidate for this seat<br />
is old So-and-So who has held it for some reason or another for<br />
some time, and then thiere's a Labour man and then therets a<br />
Country ' Party candidate whose name is MacDcnala." ( Laughter)<br />
( Applause). I said to Cli. ve Turnbull having then more faith<br />
in you wretches than I have now ( Laughzel,) I said, " What<br />
should I do? Go back and put it a2. l right;" And he said,<br />
1Oh, no ev ta hat. Pus. on to 14tawell," 1 Do you know<br />
that when polling day came, and the results were out the next<br />
day, I had secured the record of the vote Great Western.<br />
I looked at the previous election and the current election, and<br />
we had got exactly the same vote to a man. All I need to say<br />
to you about that is that the following election wtan I dldntt address<br />
the electors of Gre9t Western, Mac won. ( Laughter)<br />
Now, might I tell you one other thing, because this<br />
is really of historic importance. In Washington there are<br />
two press groups. There is the National Press Club which is<br />
replete with quarters, bottles, glasses. Itts a magnificent<br />
place, and when you go there to speak, you are received on the<br />
sidewalk and you are taken up and you are plied with various<br />
liquors and then you go in and you make a speech. Then you<br />
are asked questions,. The chairman has them all put on paper<br />
and Le picks out the oncs that you think that he thinks you<br />
can answer. I find this very advantageous.<br />
Well, I must tell you because this will add to your<br />
store of knowledge, that a few years ago, when Percy Spender<br />
was our Ambassador in Washington, I was made a guest of State.<br />
This is something rather important. You common herd wouldnt<br />
understand this. I once was a guest of honour in Paris and<br />
half the French guards were out on the streets and all sorts of<br />
things happened. In America I was this time the guest at<br />
Blair House, which is something. At Blair House, I must say<br />
that the provision was adequate. But I had accepted an<br />
invitation to make a speech at lunch time at what I thought in<br />
my stupidity was the Press Club, but turned out to be the Press<br />
Association whatever it might be. Well, Percy Spender who<br />
Dos </p>
<p>was much shrewder on these matters than I was, called along<br />
about twelve o'clock at Blair House and bounced upstairs and<br />
saw me and said, " dell, now, before we go to this thing, perhaps<br />
we ought to have a drink." I said, " Percy, nonsense<br />
you know these boys. They'll give you so much to drink belore<br />
lunch that you are very lucky if you make a speech at all."<br />
He raised a query, I must say, in his favour about this but I<br />
said, " Oh no you can't do that." So we ultimately went down,<br />
bone'dry, and we fomd ourselves driven to the Hilton Hotel and<br />
we were ? hen put into that floor that exists between the ground<br />
floor and the first floor, the entresalle or something. Anyhow,<br />
we went there and we met all the most worthy creatures in the<br />
world, but nobody had anything to drink,<br />
Then we went into the large diningroom and there they<br />
had five hundred people and we marched in and I went to my<br />
place. There was a magnificent old man in tne chai from<br />
Florida. He was really a gorgeous person. Old he was as<br />
old as I am. Therefore he was an old man, and he sat there and<br />
I sat here, and I looked down and I saw two tired pieces of<br />
cold potato and a glass of iced water ( Laughter) and I thought,<br />
well, well, this is not the Press Club. ( Laughter) And then<br />
this nic: e old man, whom I shall always recalllouked arouna at<br />
me. He was really a fine old Southern gentleman. He said,<br />
" I'm terribly sorry, you know, but you've been at the Press<br />
Club and they are very rich and we are very poor. We just can't<br />
afford to do these things.': So I said, " Oh, foe-get about it."<br />
Then all of a sudden it occurr3d to mo2 and I aid)<br />
" Now, wait a moment, I'm not complaining, You must forget about<br />
me. Didn't Winston Churchill speak to ycu fairly recentlyT,<br />
about a ycear ego?" And he Said " Yes, he did." " Well," I<br />
said, " Don't tell me that you fobod Winston off with a little<br />
iced water" ( Laughter) and he said, " Well, no, sir". From now<br />
on, if you don't mind, I will say what Winston said in Winston's<br />
own voice as iiearly as I can do it. Ke dida't, ho was a most<br />
courteous chap from Florida. He said, " Well, you know, sir,<br />
we knew that Winston Churchill liked a little alcoholic liquor,<br />
so we sent down below and we got a double scotch and we had it<br />
brought up." I said, " I know exactly what a double Scotch means<br />
in this country. You fill an enormous glass with lumps of ice<br />
and water and all this kid of thing, so that you wouldn't know<br />
what it was√∏" " Well now, sir," he said, " you've got something<br />
th3rel because when the old gentleman picked it up and he tasted<br />
it, he said, " You know, it's very remarkable how the flavour<br />
of good Scotch whiskey dissipates itself.'" ( Laughter) He said,<br />
" You know, sir, I don't know Winston Churchill as well as you<br />
do sir but I got the hint and so we sent down below and we<br />
got neat, without any additions, a doutble Scotch and it was<br />
brought up and poured into the old gentleman's glass, and he<br />
took it up and he tasted it and said ' Mm Yes. I can<br />
distinctly taste the flavour" ( Laughter).<br />
I mustntt be too frivolous any longer because I am a<br />
very serious-minded fellow. Did I make a note of anything<br />
else? Now let me have a look. You know, I'm flogged on by<br />
this fellow Maley who every now and then says to me, " Have you<br />
had any bright ideas" and I very seldom have. Oh yes. There<br />
is one other that I thought I would say something to you about.<br />
This is of great importance to you newspapermen because you<br />
know, don't you, that you are the greatest suckers in the world.<br />
( Laughter) Anybody who starts an old story afresh sells it<br />
as if it were a new story. Now this is right, isn't it? / 6 </p>
<p>-6-<br />
There was a great and good man in England called<br />
Birkenhead and I have had the great pleasure to know a number<br />
of witty and distinguished lawyers in England but every bright<br />
remark that anyone of them ever made is now attributod to<br />
Birkenhead. This is the rule of life. You chaps live on your<br />
own legends. The othar day in Canberra, which is a little<br />
provincial city which you -know but which now publishes a<br />
national newspaper ( Laughter), a gentleman wrote a letter to<br />
the press. Now the letters to the newspapers are fascinating,<br />
aren't they? Unbelievable. I read them with immense joy.<br />
This gentleman, if I may so desci. ibe him, had a very witty<br />
movement in his mind and he wrote a letter$ having discovered<br />
that there was one man in Canberra where we now ave a lake,<br />
and this man wanted to buy a gondola. Now in Melbourne, my<br />
own city, they have a thing called " Moomba". I have never quite<br />
understood it. but there it is. And somebody had a gondola<br />
brought out f6r Moomba and my distinguished compatriot in<br />
Canberra said, " Well 11ll buy the gondola". I wouldn't know<br />
at what price. It might have been quite cheap for all I know.<br />
Anyhow, he decided to buy P gondola and then a witty fellow<br />
must have been from the National University ( laughter) wrote<br />
a letter to the " Canberra Times" wiiich is now, of course, you<br />
understand, under very highbrow control ( Laughter) and said,<br />
" I take great exception to somebody buying a gondola. Why not<br />
a pair and breed from them."<br />
Now this was recited to me in my own household as<br />
almost a paroxysm of wit. A gondola, yes, why not<br />
Until I remembered fiftyfive years ago, literally, whan I was<br />
a schoolboy in Eallarat the stock joke in Ballarat was that<br />
one of the local councillors, when told by another that they<br />
ought to put a gondola on Lake Wendouree satd, " WV not have<br />
a pair and breed from them?" ( Laughter) Ncw really gentlemen,<br />
this is something that you ought to pay great attention to<br />
because'it shows that all humour is a folie circulaira and that<br />
wit is repetitive. I will always be indebted to this learned<br />
gentleman in the " Canberra Times" because I will quote him when<br />
in my own household cir-le I tell a little story so full of<br />
wit, so full of point and the family say, " Cut it out, Dad,<br />
you told us that twenty years ago." ( Laughter)<br />
Now, could I say perhaps one other thing because so<br />
far I've been a little irresponsible. We've just had a Prime<br />
Ministers' Conference, and whatever else happens at a Prime<br />
Ministers' Conference, it does recall you to the basic problems<br />
of the modern world. It certainly does. You don't sit down in<br />
rather halcyon fashion and say to yourself, " How like we are"<br />
but you find yourself saying, " How unlike we are. How different<br />
we are" and therefore a Prime Ministers' Conference is something<br />
rather exciting, quite different from the Conferences of the<br />
past, and if there is one thing that sticks out in my mind about<br />
this last one, it is that we are different. I wouldn't dare to<br />
give my complete impressions of all the people who were there,<br />
but there is just one aspect of this matter that I might just<br />
say something to you about and that is that we have Africa, a<br />
series of countries Nigeria, Ghana Uganda, Tanganyika, Kenya,<br />
Sierra Leone etc. and these present their own problem in the<br />
most difficult way and they produce people of a most different<br />
kind. Now, without making any odious comparisons, may I say </p>
<p>-7-<br />
to you this that the Prime Minister, the head of the Government<br />
of Nigeria Nigeria with 36 million people, the largest single<br />
country in the African continent is Sir Abubakar Balewa.<br />
I would think I was lucky to go through the rest of my life and<br />
meet another man so wise, so full of' character, so understanding<br />
of the problems of the day as Abubakar Balewa. This is a great<br />
man. ( Applause) And I wouldn't say that about everybody else. But<br />
why do I say this about him and not about others? The answer<br />
is that the great problem in today's worldI a problem that we<br />
must all give great thought to, is the problem of countries<br />
surging to their independence politically but economically<br />
dependent on other people. This is a tremendous problem. So<br />
much time is devoted to being able to say, 1-le are politically<br />
independent" whereas to be politically independent and economically<br />
and commercially dependent on the next man is almost a<br />
contradiction in terms. Abubakar Balewa understands this<br />
perfectly. He devotes much of his time to developing his own<br />
country, to strengthening his own country, to making his own<br />
country a self-surviving unit in the African 3ontinent and<br />
when some of his more impetuous colleagues from other African<br />
countries put all their weight and emphasis o political<br />
independence and rather disregard tne economic problem, he<br />
looks at them and occasionally says to them words which<br />
indicate that there are first things that have to con'e first.<br />
I am a great believer in the Prime Minister of<br />
Nigeria ard I fear very much the almost rabid desire or the part<br />
of some people to assert their political independence while<br />
attaching small importance to ho-r they are to live and whether<br />
they are to live at the mercy economically of some other country,<br />
they having forgotten that if you are economically at the mercy<br />
of Country B then you are in a fair way to be -he political<br />
servant of Country B.<br />
Gentlemen, it would be a great mistake for any of us<br />
to be dogmatic about these matters. It would be a great mistake<br />
for any of us speaking for myself as a Prime Minister to<br />
huddle to ourselves the 7rirment of an old Cormonwealth and wash<br />
our hands of new ones. We can't do that. We are all members<br />
one of another. We must do our best, and one of the things that<br />
has to be done is to make it understood, in the most friendly<br />
and helpful way, that no young emerging nation can be a young<br />
and genuinely independent nation unless it has within itself not<br />
only the formalities of political self-government but the<br />
essences of local self-government, of economic welfare of a<br />
capacity to endure whatever anybody e) lse does. Now, we overlook<br />
this in. Australia becnuse we are not only politically independent<br />
but we are economically independent. iJe stand on our own feet.<br />
This is, of course, of tremendous importance, We take for<br />
granted, no doubt, a great deal, I am not saying we can live by<br />
ourselves because any nation that today says it can live by<br />
itself is a fool of a nation, but within those limits, we are<br />
economically self-contained, we arc politically self-contained<br />
and we now have, as I realised when I was in London this or this<br />
nation, politically independent, proudly independent, politically<br />
and economically in an enormous moss of problems. One of the<br />
things we will have to do is not to be superior, not to talk down<br />
but to say to them all, " Well now, we realise your problem, we<br />
value your independence politically, what can we do to help you<br />
with trained men, experts with techniques?" This is not all a<br />
