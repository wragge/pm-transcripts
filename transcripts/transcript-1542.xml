FAREWELL SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER, MR. HAROLD HOLT<br />
AT VIENTIANiE AIRPORT 3RD APRIL, 1967<br />
Prime Minister, Your Highnesses, You~ r Excellencies,<br />
Ladies and Gentlemen:<br />
There is always a sadness when one parts from good<br />
friends, and that is how Mrs. Holt and I and, I am sure, others<br />
of my party are feeling this morning.<br />
We came to Laos as a good friend of your country<br />
but in the short time that we've been here wie have found it<br />
sufficiently lone. to bave built some personal friendships<br />
which we sincerely hope will endure.<br />
We came to learn something of the problems of your<br />
country and to meet your people and see them in their own<br />
native land, and this to us has been a richly rewarding<br />
experience iii knowledge and in a deeper understanding.<br />
We fully appreciate, Prime M~ inister, the importance<br />
to you and, indeed, to your friends around the world, of a<br />
neutrality which will be faithfully observed by other countries.<br />
We hope that countries of good will, whatever their<br />
general political character may be, will join in the efforts<br />
to which Australia will gladly subscribe in promoting the<br />
security, the peace, the progress and the prosperity of the<br />
people of Laos. I look foraiard to welcoming you and Her Highness<br />
to Australia, I hope perhaps even later this year, when you<br />
can find it convenient to come and visit us. It will give<br />
my countrymen great pleasure to join in the expression I now<br />
give you of good will from the Australian people. May Laos<br />
long endure in peace, w--ith progress and prosperity and security<br />
for its people. </p>
