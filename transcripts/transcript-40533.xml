    <content><![CDATA[<p>I’m very saddened to learn of the tragic accident at Dreamworld earlier today.</p>
<p>Theme parks are a place for family fun and happiness, not tragedy. This is a very, very, sad, tragic event. Our thoughts and prayers are with the families of those who lost their lives.</p>
<p>This is a very  sad day, and we trust there will be a thorough investigation into the causes of this accident over the days to follow.</p>
