FOR PRESS: PM. No. 133/ 1c, 7<br />
VISIT BY THE PRIME MINISTER OF INDIA<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister, Mr Harold Holt<br />
The Prime Minister of India, Mrs Indira Gandhi, will<br />
make an official visit to Australia from 13th to 17th January at the<br />
invitation of the Australian Government. She will visit Canberra,<br />
Sydney and Melbourne. Details of her programme will be announced<br />
later. There will be general pleasure in Australia that Mrs<br />
Gandhi is coming to this country. She represents a great people and<br />
nation one of the most populous nations in the world. Australia<br />
attaches high importance to Its relations with India and to co-operation<br />
between the two countries, and Mrs Gandhi will find warm friendship<br />
here among the Australian Government and people. I hope that during<br />
her visit she will be able to meet a wide range of Australians in official<br />
and private circles. My colleagues and I are looking forward to a valuable<br />
exchange of ideas.<br />
CANBERRA, 7 December, 1967. </p>
