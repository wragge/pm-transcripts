FOR PRESS I. . ARY<br />
P. M. No. 58/ 1966<br />
CONDITION ' OF MR. CAWELL<br />
The Prime Minister, Mr. Holt, said this morning<br />
that he had been relieved to find that Mr. Calwell's injuries,<br />
while no doubt painful, were of a comparatively minor nature.<br />
He had also been pleased to learn that the Leader of the<br />
Opposition would be well enough to be discharged from hospital<br />
this afternoon. M= Calwell, who is in Melbourne, has asked<br />
whether, in the circumstances a VIP aircraft might be made<br />
available to take Mr. Calwell home.<br />
The ' overnment readily agreed to this request and<br />
the necessary arrangements have been made. An RAAF Convair<br />
is due to leave Sydney with Mr. Calwell at 4.50 this afternoon.<br />
On arrival at his office in Parliament House this<br />
morning, Mr. Holt's first action was to seek information from<br />
the Royal North Shore Hospital on Mr. Calwell's condition.<br />
CANBERRA, 22nd June, 1966. </p>
