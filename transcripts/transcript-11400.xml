<p>  Major General Peter Cosgrove, Brigadier Evans, ladies and gentlemen, this</p>
<p>   is one of the real privileges that I've had as Prime Minister of Australia</p>
<p>   to say a few words of thanks on behalf of all of the Australian people for</p>
<p>   the superb way in which the men and women of the Australian Defence Force</p>
<p>   under General Cosgrove's magnificent leadership have carried out the mandate</p>
<p>   given to them by the United Nations. Your operation, and the actions of</p>
<p>   you men and women as Australians have brought tremendous repute, tremendous</p>
<p>   regard, and tremendous esteem to our country around the world.</p>
<p>  Australia has a very proud and great military tradition. It's not a military</p>
<p>   tradition that seeks to impose the will of our nation on the will of others,</p>
<p>   but rather a military tradition that is ready to stand up for what is right</p>
<p>   and what is legitimately in the Australian national interest when the occasion</p>
<p>   arises. And you have done that magnificently, you've done it very very efficiently,</p>
<p>   you've done it in a very professional way. And in the process you have won</p>
<p>   the affection and gratitude of the people of East Timor.</p>
<p>  The links between Australia and East Timor as many of you of a military</p>
<p>   tradition know go back a very long way. And there was a time when the people</p>
<p>   of East Timor extended help and succour and comfort to soldiers of the Australian</p>
<p>   Army during World War II when they were fighting the Japanese. And in a</p>
<p>   way, and for a lot of other reasons, that is a gratitude and a debt that</p>
<p>   is being repaid. But I can't tell you how proud I am of all of you, and</p>
<p>   can I say to you that in the 25 years that I've been a member of Parliament</p>
<p>   I have not found an issue that has more united the Australian community</p>
<p>   in a single resolute desire to support an effort conducted in the name of</p>
<p>   Australia.</p>
<p>  You are very much in the thoughts and the prayers of the people of Australia.</p>
<p>   I know that you will be thinking of your wives, sweethearts, children, parents,</p>
<p>   brothers, sisters and friends back in Australia. We are doing everything</p>
<p>   we can to look after them, to provide for them. Of course doing our level</p>
<p>   best, although we can never do it adequately, to share some of the anxiety</p>
<p>   they may feel for you.</p>
<p>  General Cosgrove has given me a detailed briefing this morning that shows</p>
<p>   that your mission has been substantially accomplished. But I will not forget,</p>
<p>   nor will the people of Australia forget, that when you came here you came</p>
<p>   into an uncertain environment, you came into a zone of great danger, you</p>
<p>   were sent to redress some wrongs that had been unfairly inflicted on the</p>
<p>   people of this territory, and you have done that in an absolutely magnificent</p>
<p>   way, in a way that befits the military tradition of Australia and a way</p>
<p>   that makes your country very proud, and in a way that will ensure that you</p>
<p>   will be ever felt and regarded in a grateful way by all of the Australian</p>
<p>   people.</p>
<p>  Can I as Prime Minister, and I know speaking on behalf of all Australians,</p>
<p>   convey to you my thanks, the thanks of the Australian people, my respect</p>
<p>   and admiration for your commanding officer and the commander of the INTERFET</p>
<p>   operation Major-General Cosgrove, for all of the other brigade and other</p>
<p>   commanders, and every last man and woman who's worked so well both in a</p>
<p>   military way and a humanitarian way. You make me very proud indeed to be</p>
<p>   Prime Minister of Australia, and all of your fellow Australians are both</p>
<p>   grateful and immensely proud at what you've achieved. Thank you.</p>
<p>  [Ends]</p>
