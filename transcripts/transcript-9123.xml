PRIME MINISTER 9/ 94<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
VISIT TO TIAILAND, LAOS AND VIETNAM<br />
As a further step in consolidating Australia's links with important regional partners, I<br />
will be making an official visit to Thailand, Laos and Vietnam from 5 to 13 April 1994.<br />
I will in each case have the opportunity to discuss with my counterparts our shared<br />
bilateral interests as well as a wide range of regional economic, political and strategic<br />
issues. I will also be attending the official opening of the Australian-funded Friendship Bridge<br />
over the Mekong River between Thailand and Laos on 8 April. The bridge provides<br />
the first ever road link between those two countries.<br />
My visit to Thailand will provide an opportunity to follow up the discussions I had in<br />
Seattle last year with Prime Minister Chuan Lckpai.<br />
Australia has a strong relationship with Thailand. Our two-way trade in 1992-93<br />
amounted to nearly $ 2 billion. Thailand's rapid growth presents considerable scope to<br />
expand our economic links, for example, through Australian involvement in<br />
infrastructure projects and provision of services for Thailand's increasingly<br />
sophisticated economy. We have worked closely with the Thai Government in the<br />
development of APEC, We also have valuable defence and security links with<br />
Thailand. My visit to Laos reciprocates the visit by Prime Minister Khamtay to Australia in<br />
December last year. Australia has much to offer Laos as a supplier of technology,<br />
expertise and in development of major infrastructure. Transfield's successful bid for<br />
the billion dollar Nam Theun 2 hydro-power project is a good example of the<br />
contribution we can make.<br />
Prime Minister Kiet's visit to Australia in May 1993 ushered in a new phase in the<br />
bilateral relationship with Vietfnam. Our bilateral trade has grown rapidly over the past<br />
two years and I expect that growth to continue as Vietnam opens up its economy.<br />
Australia has already invested heavily in Vietnam's development, including through<br />
BHP's participation in the Dai Hung ( Big Bear) oilfield project.<br />
During my visit I will be discussing with Prime Minister Kiet ways in which our two<br />
countries can further consolidate our economic and other links. Australia needs to<br />
draw on the very constructive role that the Australian Vietnamese community can play<br />
hi fostering these links.<br />
