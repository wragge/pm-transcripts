PRIME MINISTER 113/ 95<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P. J KEATING MP<br />
EPAC PRIVATE INFRASTRUCTURE TASK FORCE: FINAL REPORT<br />
( embargo 12. Olam 19 October, 1995)<br />
I welcome the release of the Final Report of the Economic Planning and<br />
Advisory Commission ( EPAC) Private Infrastructure Task Force, established in<br />
November last year. The Task Force has been inquiring into private sector<br />
Involvement In the funding, management and control of public infrastructure.<br />
The Report provides a substantial fund of ideas on issues relating to private<br />
sector Involvement in infrastructure.<br />
Among other things, the Task Force noted the rapid development of<br />
, infrastructure finance and the growing emergence of superannuation and life<br />
Insurance investments in infrastructure. The package of superannuation<br />
measures announced in the Budget will greatly Increase the pool of<br />
superannuation funds, and the level of funding that is available for<br />
Infrastructure from this source, over the next decade.<br />
The report also highlighted the growing sophistication of the infrastructure<br />
finance industry and the role played by infrastructure borrowings as a catalyst<br />
for private sector involvement. This greater sophistication will, over time,<br />
reduce the need for Infrastructure borrowings.<br />
The Task Force recommends that the tax incentives for infrastructure<br />
borrowings will not be needed after their current life. However, the Government<br />
believes such a judgement is premature, and continues to see a significant role<br />
for them in facilitating greater private sector involvement In funding the<br />
development of infrastructure.<br />
There are many substantive issues raised in the report and I have asked my<br />
Ministers to review them. The Government will respond to the detailed<br />
recommendations shortly.<br />
