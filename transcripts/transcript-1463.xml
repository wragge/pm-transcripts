VISIT TO AUSTRALIA BY PRIME MINISTER KY<br />
Extracts from Press Briefing by the Prime Minister, Mr. Harold_-Holt<br />
at Parliament House, Canberra 11th January, 1967<br />
The Prime Minister, Mr. Harold Holt, announced details<br />
of the visit to Australia by Prime Minister Ky at a press briefing in Canberra<br />
on January 11. After outlining the itinerary, Mr. Holt spoke about the background.<br />
to the visit, gave his views on what he hoped it would achieve and<br />
replied to critics of Prime Minister Ky and the projected visit to Australia.<br />
BACKGROUND TO VISIT:<br />
Speaking about how the visit developed, Mr. Holt said<br />
" Some of you pressmen who were with me In Saigon<br />
in April will remember that the Prime Minister then talked about<br />
his desire to visit Australia again. He had been here in 1956 and<br />
actually put in 79 hours of flying training In this country.<br />
" But quite apart, of course, from any personal desire<br />
to see again the country which he had visited in this way in earlier<br />
years, he expressed a desire at our subsequent meeting together<br />
at the Manila Conference to pay a visit, to have an opportunity, as<br />
he put it, of thanking the people of Australia and New Zealand for<br />
the help they had been giving to his country.<br />
" I have no doubt also that he wants to give the Australian<br />
people an opportunity to make some assessment of their own about<br />
him. " Shortly before Christmas, our Ambassador advised us<br />
that he had been told of the Prime Minister's desire to pay a short<br />
visit here early in the New Year, and I brought this to the notice of<br />
my Cabinet colleagues. They authorised me to inform the Prime<br />
Minister through our Ambassador that we would welcome such a visit<br />
and the opportunity it would provide for him to have talks with us<br />
and to meet those off my colleagues with whom he had not previously<br />
come into contact. " Quite apart from any other result of the visit, 1,<br />
myself, am looking forward to hearing from the Prime Minister his<br />
own account of developments in the military field, in processes of<br />
constitutional development which are going on there, in the way in<br />
which the economy is shaping up under the pressures of military<br />
operations and the presence in that country of so vast a body of<br />
servicemen from other countries. These are things in which we<br />
are very much interested ourselves, and it is very valuable to<br />
have a direct, first-hand account from the man who heads the<br />
Government in the country. Of my own colleagues, some of them<br />
have been there. Altogether this has some relevance to the attitude<br />
which Australia should vezy properly take to this visit." / 2 </p>
<p>-2-<br />
% here were five separate Ministerial visits to Viet Nam last<br />
year, including my own visit. There was the visit of Mr. Whitlam. Mr.<br />
Caiwell decided that he wasn't going himself and requested that Mr.<br />
Whitlamn be enabled to go. There was Dr. Cairns' visit. A Parliamentary<br />
delegation was there also from both sides of the House, and there have<br />
been some visits by private Members of the Parliament. All of these<br />
have been most courteously received and given every consideration and<br />
attention, hospitably looked after. I gather that Mr. Whitlam himself<br />
had an hour's interview with the Prime Minister and was given an official<br />
dinner by the Foreign Minister of the Viet Nam Republic. So it will be<br />
seen that up to this point of time, anyhow, the overwhelming balance of<br />
hospitality and courtesy has been on the part of the Government of the<br />
Republic of Viet Nam, and so I would hope my fellow Australians would<br />
bear these facts in mind when we, ourselves, welcome an official<br />
visitor and his party to this country."<br />
OBJBCTWES OF VISIT<br />
Mr. Holt said that both he and Prime Minister Ky were aware<br />
that the visit would not please everybody, and would be opposed by some people<br />
in Australia who had opposed military participation in Viet Nam.<br />
He said<br />
" Prime Minister Ky was aware of the likelihood of organised<br />
demonstration by the same sort of people who had organised demonstrations<br />
against myself and members of my Government and against President<br />
Johnson when he visited us last year. But I am sure it must have been<br />
in his mind that his visit would provide an opportunity for Australians to<br />
form a more realistic appreciation of the main issues involved in not only<br />
the Viet Nam conflict but the problems which a government engaged in<br />
operations of war has to face in its efforts to build democratic institutions<br />
and establish a democratically-based society.<br />
" Also there is the personal aspect I mentioned of Australians<br />
being able to makce a better, and I believe, a fairer assessment of the<br />
man and the efforts that he and his colleagues are putting into this task<br />
of building a democratically-based society, depsite the continuing<br />
military operations.<br />
DEVELOPMENT OF DEMOCRATIC PROCESSES<br />
" Most of us are sufficiently close still to the events of the Second<br />
World War to recall how we in Australia had to put much of our democratic<br />
liberty in storage for the period of the war, and the Government had to<br />
assume powers under its National Security legislation of a far-reaching<br />
kind, and we recognise the need for this in the emergncy of war.<br />
" Now here is a country where the Head of Government and his<br />
colleagues are in almost daily danger of injury or assassination by<br />
terrorist opponents. I think, myself, that it is quite remarkable that<br />
the Government in those conditions should have pressed on as it has<br />
vigorously with the effort to establish a constituent assembly. I<br />
commented on this, you may remember, when I came back from the<br />
Manila Conference. I would like to remind you of what I said at that<br />
time I said then / 3 </p>
<p>-3<br />
' It struck me as quite remarkable that the representatives<br />
of the Republic of Viet Nam should be able to accept so explicitly<br />
and however regretfully a continuing line of demarcation between<br />
North and South Viet Nam until a decision has been taken by the<br />
people of both areas for reunification. They stated that the work<br />
of the constituent Assembly elected to draw up a constitution for<br />
the Republic of Viet Nam was proceeding ahead of schedule.<br />
They gave an undertaking that general electicns to select a<br />
representative government would be held within six months of<br />
the adoption of a constitution. Believing that the democratic<br />
process must be strengthened at the local level as well as the<br />
national level, the Vietnamese leaders announced that, to this<br />
end, village and hamlet elections would be held at the beginning<br />
of 1967. They further announced that they are preparing a<br />
programme of national reconciliation. They would open all<br />
doors to Vietnamese who had been misled or coerced into casting<br />
their lot with the Vietcong. They would be given amnesty and<br />
assisted to resume a normal existence as to their employment<br />
and community participation.<br />
" Further, the Vietnamese representatives made it clear<br />
that they were not making any demands on North Viet Nam other<br />
than that the aggression should cease. When it is considered that<br />
the Republic of Viet Nam is still subjected daily to military and<br />
terrorist attack with continuing infiltration and external subversion,<br />
the attitude of the Vietnamese representatives at the conference<br />
must be regarded as most helpful and forthcoming........<br />
and so on.<br />
OPPOSITION TO VISIT:<br />
Referring to criticism of the visit, Mr. Holt said:<br />
" It has interested me to note that the strongest criticisms<br />
and these include those of Mr. Calwell have come from, in the main,<br />
people who have neither met Prime Minister Ky nor have visited Viet Nam<br />
and formed any impression for themselves of the situation there.<br />
" It is rather significant that those members of Mr.<br />
Calwell's own Party who have been there have, with the exception of the<br />
statement which came from Dr. Cairns, refrained from comment<br />
certainly of a critical kind.<br />
" T was very interested this morning to see that the' Age'<br />
consistently with the fine traditions of that paper, having taken a strong<br />
editorial line, at the same time gave prominence to a special article by<br />
its Saigon correspondent, Mr. Turner which, I think, gave from my own<br />
contact with Prime Minister Ky in Viet Nam and at Manila, as accurate<br />
an assessment as I could from my own judgment his sincerity, his<br />
earnestness, his devotion to his country, his genuine efforts to build up<br />
democratic institutions there."<br />
Mr. Holt said that in view of the attitude which the Leader of the<br />
Opposition ( Mr. Calwell) had adopted, it seemed that some unpleasantness<br />
might be associated with the visit.<br />
He continued...... / 4 </p>
<p>-4<br />
" However, I am -sure that both he ( Prime Minister Ky)<br />
and I will feel that-the-visit has been of value if it does give to the<br />
Australian-people a better and fairer assessment of the man, his<br />
policies and of the issues for which Australia, together with Viet<br />
Nam and other friendly forces are fighting in that country.<br />
Mr. Holt said he was satisfied In his own mind that the great majority<br />
of Australians would welcome the opportunity to form their own judgment.<br />
He added " That's the sort of atmosphere I have encountered, anyhow,<br />
in my own contacts since this was first mooted. And we are able<br />
from the sort of position in which I sit to get a fair idea of the<br />
strength of public feeling from the correspondence which flows into<br />
the office. " It strikes me as rather odd that it was quite acceptable<br />
to Mr. Calwell for his Deputy to go to Viet Nam and be received in<br />
the manner in which he was, to be personally in discussion with<br />
Prime Minister Ky for what I understand to have been an hour, to<br />
have accepted an official function; this apparently was entirely<br />
acceptable in Mr. Calwell's eyes. To return that kind of hospitality<br />
and in a country which has taken some pride in its hospitable spirit<br />
is, in his eyes, a matter calling for the kind of condemnation which<br />
he has publicly expressed. The only other thing I will say about it<br />
is that having regard to Mr. Calwell's own serious experience and<br />
almost tragic or fatal experience from so recent times, it does seem<br />
the more remarkable that he should be actively inciting people to<br />
demonstration. While he urges that this should be a peaceful atid<br />
orderly demonstration, he recognises, since he disowns any<br />
responsibility for any violence which may occur, that in that kind of<br />
emotionally charged atmosphere,. there is always a danger of some<br />
disorder and even violence as I have learnt myself over recent times.<br />
" But I think that the Australian public is able to put Ito<br />
own valuation on statements of this sort. I don't need to underline it."<br />
PROCEDURE FOR INITIATING VISITS<br />
Replying to a question about what might be considered an " appropriate<br />
welcome" for Prime Minister Ky, Mr. Holt went on to explain to newsmen the<br />
way in which such visits are arranged.<br />
Mr. Holt began by saying he had been intrigued to see that some<br />
press commentators had envisaged Australia would be staging something<br />
comparable with the visit of President Johnson. Mr. Holt said it would be more<br />
appropriate to compare the visit with that last year by the Thai Prime Minister,<br />
Field Marshal Kittikachorn.<br />
A once -in -a -lifetime visit by an American President was an historic<br />
event of considerable Importance for this country and was treated accordingly.<br />
For instance, he didn't think that the former British Prime Minister, Mr. Harold<br />
Macmillan had expected anything. of that sort when he had visited Australia.<br />
He continued.... " Prime Minister Ky's is an important visit but it is a visit<br />
of a kind which we ourselves or I make to other countries, and the<br />
Prime Minister is making here. </p>
<p>Backgrounding the press, Mr. Holt said<br />
" I think you should try and get in the heads of some of<br />
your editorial writers the way these things occur. If I want t6 go<br />
overseas as I did last year, for example, to see our troops hi'<br />
four different countries, I don't sit back and wakt until somebody<br />
says ' Come and visit us' and then as an incident to that seek Eo'<br />
see them. If I have a purpose which seems to me to be important<br />
enough to go to a country, soundings are made through the<br />
Ambassador as to whether such a visit would be acceptable to the<br />
government concerned. You may work out a bit of detail as to the<br />
kind of visit it will be and where it will take you, and then whel<br />
these details are completed, a formal and official invitation comes<br />
as a matter of courtesy. This is protocol conduct from the<br />
government concerned to the visitor. These things are done, but<br />
I don't imply from that that this Is an unwelcome visit.<br />
The press briefing concluded with the following questions and<br />
answers<br />
Q. Will representatives of the Opposition be Invited to Commonwealth<br />
functions<br />
MR. HOLT: Well, this raises a problem. You see, Mr. Calwell is the<br />
official leader of the Labor Party. He has made his attitude, as<br />
spokesman for the party, clearly known. He made it clear that not<br />
only would he not accept any invitation but that he would demonstrate<br />
against the visit personally and lead demonstrations against the<br />
visit. Well, if we were to go behind his back and invite individual<br />
members of his party, I think we could rightly be accused of trying<br />
to make mischief in his own ranks. If, on the other hand, there<br />
is a desire by members of his party, or he conveys any such desire<br />
to us that they should be present at those functions where it would<br />
be appropriate for Members of the Opposition to be present, of<br />
course we would take account of that.<br />
Q. This approach would have to come through Mr. Caiwell, would it,<br />
or would you take it from individual Labor people?<br />
MR. HOLT: Well, I think I would deal with it when I knew what had<br />
occurred and the circumstances but I don't imagine that<br />
we would receive individual approaches. He speaks far his party<br />
and he is, at least pro tem, the leader of the party.<br />
Q. Before Mr. Caiwell started sounding off, did you contemplate<br />
giving time for Mr. Galwell to have a private meeting with Ky?<br />
MR. HOLT: In the ordinary course of events, I am sure that not<br />
only would we have wished to provide an opportunity but I am<br />
certain that Prime Minister Ky would have been glad of an<br />
opportunity to talk to members of the Opposition.<br />
Q. Would you provide this opportunity now for Mr. Whitlam in spite<br />
of the circumstances? ./ 6 </p>
<p>-6<br />
MR. HOLT: Well, as I say, what is the proper course for a Head of<br />
Government to follow when he has an official Leader of the<br />
Opposition? I don't think it would be the proper course for<br />
me to go behind the back of the Leader of the Opposition to<br />
individual members of his party.<br />
Q. Sir, had Marshal Ky kept entirely private his wish to come to thip<br />
country, and approached you unofficially, privately throug4th<br />
Department of External Affairs, would you have invited him<br />
to come now?<br />
MR. HOLT: If he had made known his desire to come, what reasons would<br />
I have for not acceding to that wish? My colleagues were made<br />
aware of the matter, of course; it is not my sole responsibility.<br />
We work as a Cabinet on decisions of this sort. But can I rqmind<br />
you that already in recent times, the Prime Minister has vi sited<br />
Korea, the Philippines, Thailand, the Republic of China, Ma laysia<br />
and Honolulu which does happen to be one of the United States.<br />
So there are six countries, most of them associated in military<br />
operations<br />
Q. Was the United States involved in any way in negotiations for this<br />
visit? Did they seek to persuade us?<br />
MR. HOLT: Officially, I make no comment. Unofficially, I can say to you<br />
there was certainly no attempt to dissuade us, or for that matter,<br />
persuade us. We naturally let them know that this visit wils in<br />
contemplation. We keep in close contact with them. We are in<br />
virtually daily contact with them on the Viet Nam situation.<br />
Q. Mr. Prime Minister, apart from this being a sentimental journey,<br />
will there be any hard political discussions?%<br />
MR. HOLT: Well, I thought I had made it clear that I thought our discussions<br />
in Cabinet would themselves be of considerable value. I ould<br />
hope to see the Prime Minister give us an up-to-the-minute<br />
cover of how things are developing in the military respect;'<br />
You will remember out of Manila, instead of a " search andi<br />
destroy" operation, there was a shift to the " clear and hol01"<br />
type of operation. I would like to know how that is working out<br />
in his eyes, his assessment of the latest operations there,*, how<br />
the civil aid programmes are moving, and also what he feels<br />
tbout the position of the economy under these pressures I spoke<br />
of. Now that will be valuable in Itself for me and for tho hnore<br />
senior of my colleagues who have already had some contact<br />
with him, but for others who have never met him, I think it<br />
will be very valuable also. I am looking to the opportunities<br />
which will arise at one or two points here for closer and less<br />
formal discussions with him myself.<br />
0. Sir, will you be in any position to discuss any expansion of ciVIl aid?<br />
MR. HOLT: I did mention to you earlier, I think, at our press conference<br />
just before Christmas that a good deal of work is in progress in<br />
the relevant Departments, reviewing our civil aid activities,<br />
but I am not in a frosition to speak in any detail on that now,<br />
nor would I expect to go into detail with him on that. That will<br />
call for some further Cabinet consideration. </p>
