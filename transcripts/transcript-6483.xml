TRANSCRIPT or. INTERVIEW WITH MIKE, CARLTON, 2GB, SYDNEY, 26/ 9/ 134<br />
CARLTON: On the line from Kirribilli House in Sydney this<br />
morin~ g. Prime Minister, good morning.<br />
PM: Good morning.<br />
CARLTONt Thanks for your time. Prime Minister, I want to<br />
respect the privacy of your family, but I think there are a couple<br />
of issues that may affect, if you like, the office of Prime<br />
Minister. Could I ask-you just how long you have been aware of the<br />
childrena' heroin addiction.<br />
PM: I want to say in respect of the question of my family that<br />
Flazol when she spoke did that as a result of the instigation Df<br />
my children. And there is an agreement between us that that<br />
statement by Hazel would represent.. the last statemrent that would<br />
be mnade on this issue. It was made at their request. Neithex:,<br />
Hazel nor the children nor myself will hc going to the question<br />
Cain. That was a courageous decision that was taken by my<br />
children. We have an understanding and I: am not going to do anything<br />
in any way which breaks thatL understanding and commitmoent so you can<br />
ask me, Mike, as many questionzs ac-you like. I will not ha breaking<br />
that undertaking to my family.<br />
CAflt-TON; Ilight, I don't want to intrude into that privac-,. y at all.<br />
PM: You are not going to.<br />
CARLTON: OK, but I still ionder if the're is not a question of how.<br />
Icilffcts the conduct of the Prime Minis(, tership.-if you like,<br />
your position at the head of the government.<br />
PM: That's another matter. If yo. an . o as k me questions about<br />
my Prime Ministership and i-he conduct of it, that's another matter.<br />
I of course seek to impose no limii-. ation upon any -questions you g o<br />
into in that area.<br />
CARlLTON: Alright, isl it posuible at any stage that there could<br />
hiave been the ch-ance-of blachmail or preizaure placed upon you as<br />
Prima Minister throucfh the drug addiction of your children?<br />
kl, -121,1 -L-1-<br />
AA111; aAUL 1( L,, k </p>
<p>PM: Of course not. It's a total misreading of not simply<br />
my character, but I think the character of any parent, that<br />
there be a suggestion that the thing uppermost in one's mind<br />
would not be the instigation of a situation in my case that<br />
would make it most likely that anyone connected with this<br />
abomination should be brought to justice. They would misread<br />
not just my character, but the character of anyone, I believe<br />
if they thought that sort of thing could happen.<br />
CARLTON: Yes, what. I am getting at again is that<br />
PM: I understand, I mean, I am not unintelligent. I heard<br />
your question and I think that I made it clear, Mike, that the<br />
implication that anyone could it's not just a question of me<br />
that anyone in public life would be able to allow their concern<br />
not merely for their own children, but for the abomination of<br />
this drug traffic to be manipulated in a way other than to eek<br />
to have it destroyed is an absurdity and I find it offensive that<br />
there should be any continuation of that suggestion.<br />
CARLTON: No, I'm not suggesting that at all, but I wonder if<br />
the drug trade is not so widespread now that a heroin pusher could<br />
deliberately seek to involve the Prime Minister's children to<br />
gain for himself some sort of advantage.<br />
PM: Michael, I am not going to go into the situation that<br />
concerns my children.<br />
CARLTON: OK; we'll forget it.<br />
PM: I would wish you would have the decency to respect not me,<br />
EUt there are other people involved.<br />
CARLTON: Alright, well, we will go ' away from it to the<br />
politics of it. Why is the Costigan Commission being wound up<br />
when Costigan says he was close to big names and when he<br />
appealed for more time to go?<br />
PM: we might ask you the question, Mike. Why do you ask<br />
questions which are based on totally false premises. Let mec<br />
give you the facts. The Costigan Commission is not being<br />
wound down. It is not being wound down. Let me give you the facts.<br />
It was December 1981 when Mr Costigan produced his most devastating<br />
report about the growth of organised crime and particularly of<br />
the drug industry in Australia. That was December 1981. ArLd in<br />
that devastating report he referred to the fact that in his<br />
investigations into the Painters and Dockers Union he had<br />
stumbled into the indu3try of organised crime which he said was<br />
the fastest growing industry in Australia, particularly let me<br />
remind you particularly over the past five years that is<br />
from 1976 to 1981. Now what did the previous government do in<br />
those circumstances Their next Dudget after December 1981<br />
was brought down in ' 82 which determined the financial resources<br />
made available to the Costigan Commission for 1982/ 83. Now those<br />
resources, Mike, were just under throe million. Let me be precise<br />
$ 2,963,805. Now that was the reaction of our predecessors. </p>
<p>The resources they would make available to the Costigan<br />
Commission. when we came in, in our first year 83/ 84, we<br />
more than doubled the financial resoures made available<br />
that was from their $ 2.9 to $ 5.9 million.<br />
CARLTON: But now the Costigan Commission is coming to an end,<br />
isnt iTt, I mean..<br />
PM: I believe that you think you are asking what you<br />
f~ gard as an important question, in making allegations about<br />
the winding down of the Costigan Commission.<br />
CARLTON: No, it is closing, it is.<br />
PM:. Either you regard this as-important or not, Michael,<br />
and you will give me the opportunity of putting into full<br />
context the facts.<br />
CART-TON: OK.<br />
PM:* Now the facts are that this Government in our first year<br />
m ore than doubled: the resources available to the Costigan<br />
Commission. We strengthened it and we; doubled its resources;.<br />
Now we shared with our predecestc-or, Mr Fraser, the view which<br />
had been expressed by Mr Fraser and his Attorney-General and<br />
their spokesman, that the Costigan Comission had to come to<br />
an end and be taken over by a permanent. authority. That wa! s the<br />
view of the previous government and it is our view. And so we<br />
commenced the discussion within the ccommunity as to what shiould<br />
be the form of permanent authority, ongoing authority, to fiLght<br />
crime and the National Crime Authority so emc~ rged. Now the<br />
important thing is that the Cos'cigan Commission activities have<br />
not been brought to an end. All the material of Mr Coimmrissioner<br />
Costigan is being passed over to the National Crime Authority,<br />
a permanent body. The 42 lines of inve! stigation that rr<br />
Costigan has specifically mcentioned are being handed over to<br />
this new permanent authority which has been regarded by both Sides<br />
of politics as necesfsary to take over lthe temporary work of the<br />
R~ oyal Commission.<br />
CARLTON; Yes, but didn't Costician hiinm3elf plead though for more<br />
time. Did you just see you had to draw the line' Somewhere?<br />
P11: Let'Is put that into historical context. Mr Commissioner<br />
-ostigan asked the Fraser Government in the mid ' dle of 1982 for an<br />
extension of two to three years. He asked the previous<br />
government, lMe wanted to be extended for two to three years.<br />
And the previ4ous government wou' ' d not give him that extension.<br />
Hie hat. asked us for an extension and we have given him, not to<br />
the extent that. he asked for. And in that we were at one with<br />
the previous governnmcnt in that you cault have a Royal Commiss~ ion<br />
which is regarded and zacknowledr: ted eas a temporary institution. </p>
<p>CARLTON: Right. What of Mr Peacock's claim that Costigan<br />
was in fact getting too close to a scandal which could<br />
embarrass the NSW Government?<br />
PM: Absolutely untrue. For that proposition to have any<br />
validity at all, you would have to say you were going to be<br />
stopping Mr Costigan handing over and making available, not<br />
only the material, but all his resources to the National<br />
Crime Authority. Everything that Mr Costigan has got, all his<br />
lines of investigation, will be handed over. They have it<br />
already, much of it has been handed over. And I would just<br />
ask you this question, Mike. It is a fundamentally important<br />
question. Any suggestion that the National Crime Authority<br />
cannot or will not continue the work of Mr Costigan involves a<br />
most fundamental attack upon the integrity and the capacity of<br />
the members of the National Crime Authority. They are going<br />
to have all Mr Costigan's material.<br />
CARLTON: But not all his powers of investigation and can't a<br />
state government veto, a line of enquiry?<br />
PM: The point there is that there are single path tracks that<br />
can be taken, but what you have got to understand and what has<br />
been understood by the people who have been investigating ir the<br />
period leading up to the establishment of the legislation<br />
people have understood that if you are going to make a national<br />
authority work, you have to have the co-operation of the states.<br />
And that has been made quite clear. Let me refer to what<br />
Special Prosecutor Redlich has said about this because this<br />
make the point crystal clear as to how you are going to have,, an<br />
effective National Crime Authority. This is page 48 of his<br />
report, Michael. He says throughout its long history, the<br />
debate on the configuration of the Authority has been influenced<br />
by three factors. He referred to three. That is the optimum<br />
moans of detecting and investigating organioed crim: inal activity.<br />
Secondly, the protection of civil liberties. And thirdly, the<br />
integrity of the States and their law enforcement agencies.<br />
CARLTON: Yes, it just seems to me a State can chuck a spanner<br />
in the works if it wants to.<br />
PM: I don't believe that that is the case because if all the<br />
material has been passed over, as it has been, then what you are<br />
going to have is what is happening now is that you have got<br />
Counsel investigating all that material and making recommendations<br />
to the members of the National Crime Authority itself. And then<br />
that goes to the inter-governmental coi-mittee. Now look at the<br />
reality of it. Do you believe thlat there could be a tenable<br />
situation where all that process has been gone through, the material<br />
has come through Mr Costigan, it has come to Counsel, it goes to<br />
the members of the National Crime Authority itself. They<br />
examine it all and they make a recommendation to the intergovernmental<br />
committee. Do you think in political terms a<br />
government could possibly survive which in the front of all<br />
other government members of a politically opposite character,<br />
said, oh no, because we want to protect a situation, we are going<br />
to put a veto on it. It is a political insanity. No government<br />
would survive that process when the Costigan Commision has seen </p>
<p>the material, the members of the National Crime Authority have<br />
seen the material, Counsel Assisting have seen the material,<br />
and CARLTON: And it has been leaked in the National Times.<br />
PM: in the National Times. But you are saying its political<br />
real that when you have got all that spread of knowledge about<br />
a situation any political leader would say I'm sorry I'm going to<br />
put a kybosh on it. Now let me just make one other point<br />
about it so that you're not just having me say this, but I am<br />
terribly concerned, Mike, and I believe you should be and anyone who i<br />
concerned as I am, and I want to get everybody concerned with<br />
organised crime in this country behind bars. I don't want<br />
reputations destroyed by innuendo. I want the proper processes<br />
of a trial. And my commitment is that any person concerned with<br />
organised crime in this country and involved in it should finish<br />
up behind bars. And I am terribly concerned that as a result of<br />
this politically stage-managed exercise thatlis going on at the<br />
moment, the authority and the integrity of the National Crime<br />
Authority is being undermined in its capacity towwl/ ork.<br />
CARLTON: You know why that is. One reason we have had so<br />
many Commissions and Enquiries, particularly here in NSW, and<br />
yet the big fellows, the big fish are still on the loose,<br />
aren't they.<br />
PM: Let me just make one point. Commissioner Costigan made<br />
hTs report, as I say, in December 1981 and in talking about<br />
the growth of organised crime, the fastest growing industry in<br />
Australia, he said it had particularly flourishedlin the last five<br />
years. Let mn make the point, that if you want to talk about the<br />
last 35 years in this country, since 1949, out of those<br />
years 30 of them at the Federal level have been in the hands of<br />
non-Labor government. Now it was only when this government came<br />
in that we double the resources of the Costigan Commission,<br />
that we established an effective national continuing permanent<br />
crime authority which as far as I'am concerned, while I am<br />
Prime Minister, will be under the constant instruction and<br />
initiative to do everything they can to bring every single person<br />
connected with organised crime to trial and if found guilty put<br />
behind bars. Let . me make the point about Senator Chipp and what<br />
he has said.<br />
CARLTON: Prime Minister, I am going to have to finish in just<br />
a second. Will you wear the idea of putting Costigan before<br />
the Senate?<br />
PM: Look, the question of Mr Costigan going before the Senate is<br />
a matter for the Senate. If anyone has got anything to be<br />
worried about in respect of Mr Ccstigan it is not this government.<br />
lUL'TUIN: iMr HawKe we will have to leave it there.<br />
