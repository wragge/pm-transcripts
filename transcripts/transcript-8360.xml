AUSTRALIA<br />
CHECK AGAINST nPELIVFRY EMPARGOED UNTTL DjfLTVE<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
LAUNCH OF THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY<br />
REFORM STRATEGY<br />
CANBERRA 3 DECEMBER 1991<br />
Ladies and Gentlemen<br />
This is a very significant day not just for the AusTralian<br />
building and construction industry, but for Australia<br />
generally. The Construction Industry Reform Strategy marks the<br />
beginning of a co-operative effort to solve some of the most<br />
intractable issues in this vital industry, and to nurture<br />
its considerable strengths.<br />
At the outset, I wish to sincerely congratulate my Ministers<br />
Senator Peter Cook and David Beddall for the initiative and<br />
hard work they have put into developing this strategy. Let<br />
me also commend the cooperation of both sides of industry<br />
and all levels of Government which have made it possible.<br />
Over the past 12 months some 100 senior company executives,<br />
union leaders, industry association personnel, Commnonwealth<br />
and State ministers and officials have worked to develop a<br />
reform agreement and a code of practice.<br />
Today is the culmination of this preliminary work, and marks<br />
the beginning of the next stage.<br />
Australia's construction industry faces many problems.<br />
Costs for major projects are estimated to be up to<br />
higher than those of our major competitors.<br />
The export performance by our construction companies is near<br />
the bottom of the table of OECD countries, and R&amp; D<br />
expenditure by the industry is poor.<br />
Our export orientation is also quite low by international<br />
standards. Latest data indicates that our export/ turnover<br />
ratio is about 2% compared with the OECD country average of<br />
14%. This is deserving of closer attention, particularly<br />
when one considers the excellent international reputation<br />
held by our civil engineers and consultancy firms.<br />
3552 </p>
<p>R&amp; D expenditure by the private sector is of the order of $ 13<br />
million a year according to the ABS. For an industry which<br />
has an output of S40 billion annually this is not good<br />
enough. But the problems are not: confined to the industry. There<br />
exists a maze of planning and building regulations, the<br />
result of a hundred years of provincialism, and certain work<br />
practices which have absolutely no place in an<br />
internationally competit~ ive economy.<br />
The construction industry is one of Australia's largest<br />
currently employing more than 500,000 people it accounts for<br />
some 60% of the nation's gross fixed capital expenditure.<br />
The importance of reforn for the construction industry is<br />
demonstrated by the Cent~ re for International Economics.<br />
Their work indicates that a 10 per cent gain in efficiency<br />
in construction would lead to a 2.5 per cent annual gain in<br />
GDP. That is, reforms this industry could have twice the<br />
impact on GDP of efficiency gains in other sectors of<br />
similar size, such as health and education.<br />
This is because the construction industry has important<br />
links to the rest of the economy, in particular to mining,<br />
transport and tourism.<br />
The In-Principle Reform and Development Agreement signed<br />
today, accepts these challenges and points the way ahead.<br />
The Agreement, by actually specifying the areas for reform,<br />
including restrictive work practices, ensures that these<br />
problems can be seen anti dealt with out in the open.<br />
The code of practice, to apply to tenderers to the<br />
Commonwealth, State and Territory public works markets, is<br />
the foundation for co-ordinated action to facilitate the<br />
development of companies embracing " best practice."<br />
The ratings system for companies, to operate in conjunction<br />
with the code of practice, will give governments confidence<br />
that taxpayers' dollars are wisely spent.<br />
The ratings system is important for two reasons.<br />
First, it will send strcng signals to companies as to where<br />
their public sector clients expect improvement.<br />
Second, the ratings will provide an objective, transparent<br />
framework for decision-m~ akers within government. And the<br />
efficiency of the tender process will be improved.<br />
The Industry Development agenda of the Strategy will focus<br />
mostly on lifting the export, R&amp; D and quality assurance<br />
aspects of the industry. As I indicated at the outset our<br />
efforts in these areas are well below our major competitors. 3053 </p>
<p>Labour market reform is an important element of the overall<br />
reform agenda.<br />
The key areas are identified in the In Principle Reform<br />
Agreement. the implementation of more efficient and flexible work<br />
practices the development of specific measures to reduce the<br />
incidence of lost time<br />
the implementation of award restructuring, the<br />
introduction of new classifications and skill related<br />
career paths and associated training<br />
improvements in safety standards and working<br />
environment<br />
There is more to this program than holding out examples of<br />
efficient practice as beacons in the wilderness for others<br />
to follow and copy. This is not just a program about change<br />
this is a program for change.<br />
The only way to achieve Best Practice is by enlisting and<br />
heeding and respecting all the skills and experience of all<br />
the people involved.<br />
The involvement and commitment of the entire workforce are<br />
absolutely essential to reform in the workplace. Reform is<br />
impossible without them and industry without reform is no<br />
longer an option.<br />
The reform agreement also refers to building regulation,<br />
which involves a key group of people building inspectors,<br />
local councillors, builders of all sizes, and legal<br />
practitioners. The current system of building regulation is complex,<br />
confusing and costly to laymen and industry practitioners<br />
alike..<br />
A little over two years ago, the Premiers' conference on<br />
housing agreed to establish the Building Regulation Review<br />
Task Force. Its charter essentially was to examine how<br />
greater uniformity and " commonsense" could be introduced<br />
into the current system.<br />
The task force, led by Dr John Nutt, Chairman of Ove ( OVAY)<br />
Arup, is today submitting its report.<br />
The BRR report is significant in two respects. It: is a good<br />
example of how the three tiers of government have been cooperating<br />
to drive micro-economic reform, and it provides a<br />
blueprint for future action by governments and industry.<br />
There are three aspects then to the strategy industrial<br />
relations, industry development and building regulation.<br />
3554 </p>
<p>The Strategy will have Commonwealth funding of Sl0.8 million<br />
over three years.<br />
There has been strong suoport from State and Territory<br />
governments for the reform strategy.<br />
South Australia, Victoria and the ACT will be signing the In<br />
Principle Reform Agreement today. Tasmania and Western<br />
Australia have indicated they will sign shortly, and<br />
Queensland has given strong support for the Commonwealth's<br />
initiatives.<br />
A key element of the strategy the code of practice ver-y<br />
much depends on state public works.<br />
However, it is not just a one-way street. Companies will<br />
have the opportunity to increase their business with<br />
government. A comprehensive system for consultation and implementation<br />
has been agreed by the major parties. The main elements are<br />
the establishment of the Construction Industry Development<br />
Council and the Construction Industry Reform Agency.<br />
The Industry Council will have its inaugural meeting today,<br />
chaired by Ministers Beddall and Cook, with membership drawn<br />
from industry and unions and Governments.<br />
The Reform Agency will be a small specialist group, drawn<br />
mainly from the private sector. Its job is to implement the<br />
key elements of the strategy.<br />
I am pleased to announce today that the Chief Executive<br />
officer of the Agency will be Emn MacDonald, the former<br />
chairman of Civil and Civic.<br />
Emn brings to the position years of experience, and the<br />
universal support of the: industry. I sincerely thank you<br />
for accepting this challenging position.<br />
I am also pleased to anrounce that Paul White of Concrete<br />
Constructions has accepted the position of Chairman of the<br />
Board. Board members already approved include Mr Martin Albrecht<br />
( Thiess Constructions), Mr David Chandler ( Fletcher<br />
Construction), Mr Martin Ferguson ( ACTU), Mr Jack Ritch<br />
( AMP), Mr Stan Sharkey ( BWIU), Mr Malcolm Kinnaird ( Kinhill<br />
Group), Mr Robert Milne ( Hooker Cockram). Mr Malcolm Farrow<br />
( DITAC), Mr Bob Marshman ( DIR).<br />
A Member from the States; will also be appointed.<br />
We may now look forward to all the parties working together<br />
to transform this indust~ ry into an internationally<br />
competitive and dynamic one. 3555 </p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen, today is the beginning of a new era<br />
for the construction industry. We have a strategy which is<br />
innovative, timely, based on good practice, has the support<br />
of the major groups, and goes to the heart of the industry's<br />
problems. It will change the way things are done in this<br />
industry for the better.<br />
