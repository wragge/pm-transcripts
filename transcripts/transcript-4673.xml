FOJR PRESS 9 APRIL 1978<br />
THE MEAT INDUSTRY, DISPUTE<br />
Industrial action by two branches of the Australian Meat<br />
Industry Employees Union in Western Australia and South Austral~ ia<br />
is threatening a major market for Australia's primary producers.<br />
A $ 300 million a year trade has been established. This trade<br />
adds significantly to Australia's export income. it is<br />
important, not only for the producers of the sheep, but for all<br />
Australians. It adds to our income as a nation. It adds to our<br />
capacity to provide employment for many australians.<br />
That market, and that income, is being threatened by two branches<br />
of one union, by people who have taken the law into their own<br />
hands, and are determined that trade shall not continue except on<br />
terms that they choose.<br />
The Government cannot, and will not, accept circumstances in which<br />
a union, or part of a union, can dictate the terms of Australia's<br />
export trade. To do so would be to damage the standard of living<br />
of all Australians.<br />
The cessation of this trade, through picketing which began almost<br />
three weeks ago, is particularly serious for the producers.<br />
They have been through bad seasons with low prices, and they have<br />
been suffering for many years.<br />
This particular trade was a ray of light on the horizon. It has<br />
kept solvent many farmers who otherwise would have gone bankrupt.<br />
This industry must keep access to the live sheep market.<br />
The Government has passed laws to protect our export trade.<br />
It will take whatever actions are necessary to maintain those<br />
laws and the trade they are designed to protect. The Government<br />
supports the legal actions that are now being taken to get the<br />
bans lifted.<br />
Let there be no mistake. The community interest must prevail.<br />
It will prevail. That is the Government's obligation.<br />
That must be the inevitable result. I therefore urge members of the<br />
union concerned to lift the bans and let this trade proceed forthwith.<br />
I am certain that when that happens, the legal actions will cease.<br />
If the bans remain, legal actions mrust and will be pursued and<br />
supported by the Gcvernment. </p>
