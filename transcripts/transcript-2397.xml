PARLIAMENTARY LUNCHEON IN HONOUR CF<br />
1H ISRO6YAL H IGHNES57 DD~ ff ED INBURGH<br />
CANBERRA, ACT<br />
SecbyL the Prime Minister, Mr. William McMahon 31 M\ arch 1971<br />
Your Royal Highness, Your Excellencies, Parliamentary Colleagues, Chiefs<br />
of Staff and Gentlemen,<br />
Prince Philip is very well-known to us and we are delighted he has come<br />
back again as our guest to share with us the fiftieth anniversary of the Royal Australian<br />
Air Force. Your personal standard, Sir, is now flying in Canberra. Its four quarters<br />
are a record of the events which brought you to your high and responsible place<br />
alongside the Throne.<br />
The lions and the cross in the first and second quarters remind us of<br />
your ancestors from Denmark and Greece. The fourth quarter contains the arms<br />
of the city of Edinburgh.<br />
But, Sir, it is the third quarter of the standard, with its black and white<br />
stripes, that has an added interest for many Australians. Many of the locals will<br />
claim you as a supporter of the Yass rugby team. Black and white are its colours.<br />
If you went to Collingwood, in Victoria, you would get a riotous welcome. Their<br />
colours, too, are black and white.<br />
But Sir, I'm sure you'd get the best welcome of all if you went to the<br />
Western Suburbs in my own electorate near Sydney. They too play rugby in black<br />
and white. I've heard that Newcastle United in Britain claims your support and that,<br />
in fact, you call your personal standard " Newcastle United". Our teams in black<br />
and white are called " the magpies" and I'll stretch the story a bit further, Sir,<br />
to recall that your f irst command was a naval frigate, H. M. S. Magpie.<br />
But names apart, Sir, my advisers tell me that the black and white stripes<br />
in your standard are the mark of the Mountbattens your family name and one of<br />
great distinction in the British story.<br />
I hope your standard will fly in this country many times and will always<br />
bring with it the same enjoyment as it does today.<br />
Your own family links with the Throne are deep-rooted in history and you<br />
have given matchless support to Her Majesty The Queen. Together you have given a<br />
new purpose and an involvement to the Crown and the people in this neo-Elizabethan<br />
age. / 2 </p>
<p>1 2.<br />
The Crown's adaptability to contemporary life is evident to all of us. It<br />
is based, I believe, simply on a compatability with the world of today and an<br />
understanding of the human values and the qualities that make our society what it<br />
is. You are known Sir, not only as a sailor, airman and sportsman, but as a<br />
man with a social conscience and a deep and understanding sense of community interest.<br />
You have been a spokesman for most good causes and a number of neglected ones.<br />
You have never been to use your own words " a sitting tenant in any<br />
job". Not once or twice, but every time you have been with us, you have had<br />
something inspiring to say.<br />
Your speeches have purpose and point and are candid. They spark off<br />
ideas and promote debate with a cutting edge finely honed for each particular subject.<br />
Your appeals for a public conscience on the protection of our wild life<br />
and the conservation of our environment have done much to win support for what we<br />
want to achieve. It is part of history, Sir, that you managed to have the site of a<br />
housing estate in Western Australia changed so that a " noisy scrub bird" to give it<br />
its full name should not be disturbed, because the species was nearly extinct in<br />
Australia. I am sure you know, Sir, that we have developed plans for a National<br />
Advisory~ ouncil onConservation and also have decided to establish a Commonwealth<br />
Office of the Environment.<br />
You are an eloquent advocate of conservation and this helps to generate<br />
a public awareness of the problem which is one, not for governments alone, but for<br />
everyone. I think, too, Sir, your special interest in young people matches the mood<br />
of the times. We want to expand their horizons and their freedoms. By that I mean<br />
the freedoms that go with health and physical fitness education and opportunity.<br />
These new frontiers must be explored and fertilised if our young people are to live<br />
happy and rewarding lives.<br />
The interest of Australian youth in the Duke of Edinburgh Awards Scheme<br />
shows they will readily respond to new outlets for their enthusiasms, talents and<br />
energies. We value the Scheme as we value the Commonwealth Study Conference<br />
because it is one of those social movements of the fast-moving seventies that you<br />
have sponsored with drive, imagination and more than a bit of blunt speaking.<br />
We don't want Australia to stand still, and, I am sure Sir, neither do you.<br />
You have warned that the propaganda of the " stop-everything brigade" is continuous<br />
and in the long-run fatal. You have done what you can to make the " start something<br />
society" remain active and dedicated. With these goals we all agree. oo. / 3 </p>
<p>3.<br />
And you, Sir, are a family man. Those who have seen you with your<br />
family as so many of us did last year will know how enjoyable and exciting it can<br />
be. It is a reminder that the family remains the foundation of the good society.<br />
When you spoke on television last Sunday you said of the Royal Family<br />
" We have to live as people and we have to have a home".<br />
I agree completely. There is no other foundation on which we can<br />
build if we want to sustain a free and tolerant society.<br />
Sir, it is refreshing to have you with us for all these reasons and to do<br />
honour to the Royal Australian Air Force on its fiftieth birthday. Ilam specially glad<br />
to be associated as Prime Minister with this anniversary, becadse in 1952 1 had the<br />
honour to present, on behalf of Her Majesty, The Queen's colours to the R. F.<br />
at Laverton. Ladies and Gentlemen, this is a special day for the R. A. A. F. The<br />
R. A. A. F. has fought with heroism d. nd distinfction over Europe and Africa, across<br />
the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans and ih the war theatres of Asia.<br />
This fighting Service is vital to our security because I believe air power<br />
to be one of the keys both to survival and to peace.<br />
We are proud that you are here as a Marshal of the R. A. A. F. and<br />
as a rmmber of the Royal F amily.<br />
And that you honour this fighting Service by your presence, as we, in this<br />
Parliament, honour it, too.<br />
We thank you, Sir, for being with us at this time. </p>
