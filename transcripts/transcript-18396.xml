PM: It's a great pleasure to be here with Northern Territorian and Minister Warren Snowdon. It's been a great honour today to attend the events here to commemorate the bombing of Darwin 70 years ago.</p>
<p>As a Government we deliberately sort to ensure that this day would be a national day where we pause to reflect about everything we've lost but also to admire everything we've built.</p>
<p>We've had the opportunity today to honour veterans who were here on that dreadful day when Darwin was bombed, when we saw the first attack on Australian soil. It was Australia's Pearl Harbour and it commenced the Battle of Australia.</p>
<p>It's been a wonderful pleasure to be here last night and today to be able to participate in the commemorative events and I want to ensure that right around the nation people stop and reflect on this day and of course that our school children learn this history which has be forgotten for far too long.</p>
<p>I'm happy to take questions.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST: (Inaudible) Kevin Rudd  -  some videos have come out of him swearing. What's your response to that, his behaviour?</p>
<p>PM: Can I be very clear about all of this. There have been some assertions today that somehow this is connected with my office. That is completely untrue. My office did not have access to the material people have seen on YouTube. I don't know who put that material on YouTube but whoever did it has acted inappropriately.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST: (Inaudible)</p>
<p>PM: I have the strong confidence of my colleagues, their strong support and my focus is on getting on with my job as Prime Minister. We're doing that today marking a very special and important event in Australia's history, but we're doing it every day. Building the strong economy we need for the future while we make sure we deliver a package of policies to support working families today. So that's where my focus is and that's where it will remain.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST: (Inaudible)</p>
<p>PM: Look, I'm not going to be drawn into commentary on the contents of the video.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST: (Inaudible)</p>
<p>PM: I'm getting on with the job with the strong confidence of my colleagues. We are delivering for this nation the change we need to have a prosperous economy for the future so that working Australians can be reassure they'll have a place in that economy and so will their children. And we're working today too to deliver the benefits of a strong economy to working families through policies that support them like Paid Parental Leave, like our expanded Education Tax Refund to help with the cost of getting the kids to school, like more money into childcare than ever before.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST: (Inaudible)</p>
<p>PM: I understand that Darren is feeling pressure, he represents a constituency in the Federal Parliament that is feeling the pressure from economic change and so I understand he's feeling that pressure.</p>
<p>The best way of dealing with that is for us to keep getting on with the job of supporting people and their jobs today and supporting people as we build the new economy that will give them jobs for tomorrow.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST: If there was a leadership spill, do you think you've got the numbers?</p>
<p>PM: Look I'm not going to engage with hypotheticals, but I'm getting on with the job with the strong support of my colleagues to do so.</p>
<p>Okay, thank you very much. </p>
