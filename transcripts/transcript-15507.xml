    <content><![CDATA[<p>Each Australia Day we come together as a people to celebrate our national achievements and all that is great about being Australian.  </p>
<p>Australia Day is a time to consider our nation's history, to acknowledge our past, rejoice in the present and look to the future with confidence.  It is also when we celebrate the good fortune we share as citizens of a prosperous and harmonious nation blessed with natural beauty.  </p>
<p>We are a people bound by common values which include respect for the   freedom and dignity of the individual, a commitment to the rule of law, the equality of men and women and a spirit of egalitarianism that embraces tolerance, fair play and compassion for those in need.  </p>
<p>Australia Day provides us with an opportunity to reflect on our common values and our responsibilities as Australian citizens and to commit to ensuring that we remain an open and harmonious society.   </p>
<p>However you choose to celebrate today, I wish all Australians a happy and safe Australia Day.</p>
