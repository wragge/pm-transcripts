FOR PRESS PM. No. 91 1968<br />
CONTROL OF CORAL SEA ISLANDS<br />
The Governments of Australia and the United<br />
Kingdom today exchanged letters in which the British Government<br />
recognised Australian control over a number of small islands in the<br />
Coral Sea off the East Coast of Australia.<br />
The islands concerned are<br />
Bird Islet, West Islet and other islands forming part of<br />
Wreck Reef.<br />
Cato Island<br />
Herald Beacon Islet and other islands forming part of Mellish<br />
Reef<br />
Observatory Cay and other islands forming part of Frederick<br />
Reef<br />
Observatory Cay and other islands forming part of Kenn Reef<br />
And the island known as Pocklington Reef.<br />
These are all small uninhabited islands lying between<br />
latitudes 10 degrees South and the Tropic of Capricorn and between<br />
longitudes 154 degrees and 158 degrees East.<br />
Australia has exercised control over these islands for<br />
a number of years and the Exchange of Letters merely confirms that<br />
the Queen's Sovereignty over the islands is exercised by the Aust! alian<br />
Government and not the British Government.<br />
