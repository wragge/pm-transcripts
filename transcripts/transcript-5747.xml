* FOR MEDIA WEDNESDAY, 10 FEBRUARY 1982<br />
VICTORIAN STATE ELECTION<br />
April 3 will obviously be an enormously important day<br />
for Victoria. It is a State with many achievements.<br />
Victorians will be choosing whether they are going to<br />
stay with the Party and the Government which has given<br />
them the highest household incomes of any state, the<br />
highest home ownership of any state, the highest<br />
savings bank savings of any state and much more reliable<br />
power than New South Wales; or whether they are<br />
going to turn to the very doubtful quantity of<br />
John Cain and the Socialist Left.<br />
. One thing Victorians will need to understand over<br />
the next few weeks is that the State Labor Party is<br />
controlled by the Socialist Left. They put Mr Cain<br />
in power as Leader of the opposition, and if anyone<br />
thinks Mr Cain would not jump when they told him<br />
what tc: do, then they would be taking a grave risk.<br />
