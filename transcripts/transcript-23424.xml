    <content><![CDATA[<ol><li>The President of the Republic of Korea, H.E. Park Geun-hye, and the Australian Prime Minister, the Hon. Tony Abbott MP, met in Seoul on 8 April 2014 and discussed regional and global security issues.</li>
</ol><ol><li value="2">Our two countries share common values and are strongly committed to democracy, the rule of law and market based economies. Australia helped defend the territorial integrity of the Republic of Korea during the Korean War and remains Koreaâs close friend and partner. The United Nations Command, of which Australia is a key member, continues to preserve peace on the Korean Peninsula.</li>
</ol><ol><li value="3">We agree to work more closely to address the diverse security challenges we face.</li>
</ol><ol><li value="4">We agree that the Korean and Australian Ministers of Foreign Affairs and Defence (2+2 Ministers) will develop a blueprint for further cooperation in security and defence.</li>
</ol><ol><li value="5">Australia welcomes initiatives to address the security challenges of the region including the Northeast Asia Peace and Cooperation Initiative (NAPCI) launched by the Korean government.</li>
</ol><ol><li value="6">The Republic of Korea, Australia and international community face the challenges of achieving enduring peace on the Korean Peninsula and its peaceful unification based on the principles of free democracy and the market economy, and improving the humanitarian and human rights situation in North Korea to build a better future for all Koreans.</li>
</ol><ol><li value="7">Australia works with the Republic of Korea and others to achieve the complete, verifiable, and irreversible denuclearization of the DPRK which is essential for peace and stability in the region and beyond, including by insisting that the DPRK should abandon all nuclear weapons and nuclear programs including its uranium enrichment program and comply fully withÂ all relevant UNSC resolutions and its commitments under the 19 September 2005 Six-Party Talks Joint Statement.</li>
</ol><ol><li value="8">We will work closely to strengthen regional security architecture, particularly the East Asia Summit (EAS), to promote cooperation on the political, security, economic and other challenges facing the region.</li>
</ol><ol><li value="9">We will support practical activities in the region through the ASEAN Defence Ministersâ Meeting Plus (ADMM-Plus) and ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF).</li>
</ol><ol><li value="10">We will work closely with our friends and partners in the region to enhance our mutual security interests at both regional and global levels, while recognizing the contribution of the US rebalancing toward Asia for peace and stability in the region.</li>
</ol><ol><li value="11">We believe that increasing trade and investment provides significant economic and strategic benefits to both countries. The Korea Australia Free Trade Agreement will take to a new level the economic cooperation between our two countries by cutting the costs of trade and promoting new investment in services, energy and resources and agriculture.</li>
</ol><ol><li value="12">To maximise the gains of this Agreement for economic growth and employment, we will work closely together to finalise required domestic procedures to bring the Agreement into force as soon as possible.</li>
</ol><ol><li value="13">To boost investment, we will work closely to improve regulatory quality and promote deregulation across our economies, including through exchanges of experts and business delegations. By eliminating unnecessary corporate regulation we will ensure businesses get the most out of our Free Trade Agreement. We underscored the G20âs continuing central role in supporting global economic recovery through concrete actions to promote growth and employment, including through freer trade and stronger infrastructure.</li>
</ol><ol><li value="14">We will pursue regional and global action to prevent the spread of weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery, including through the United Nations, the Nuclear Security Summits and the Proliferation Security Initiative.</li>
</ol><ol><li value="15">We agree to establish a bilateral cyber-policy dialogue to address common cyber threats and help advance the international dialogue on norms. We will also cooperate in space security.</li>
</ol><ol><li value="16">We will increase our cooperation in peacekeeping around the world.</li>
</ol><ol><li value="17">We will further develop our patterns of bilateral and joint exercising, and strengthen practical defence cooperation including in the fields of maritime security, humanitarian assistance and disaster relief. Our cooperation in the search for Malaysian Airlines Flight MH370 is an excellent demonstration of our ability to work together at short notice.</li>
</ol><ol><li value="18">We recognise the importance of Republic of Korea - Australia - United States trilateral defence cooperation.</li>
</ol><ol><li value="19">We will review the existing bilateral-security framework and agreements, including the 2011 Memorandum of Understanding in the field of defence cooperation and the 2010 Agreement on the Protection of Classified Military Information to ensure they meet the needs of the expanding defence relationship between the Republic of Korea and Australia.</li>
</ol><ol><li value="20">We will explore opportunities to deepen logistics collaboration and to develop defence science and technology and defence-industry and procurement cooperation.</li>
</ol><ol><li value="21">We will promote dialogue between security institutions in both countries, including 1.5 track dialogues.</li>
</ol><ol><li value="22">We will promote maritime security and safety in accordance with international law, including the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.</li>
</ol><p>8 April 2014</p>
