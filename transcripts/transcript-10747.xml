    <content><![CDATA[<p>E&amp;OE.........................................................</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, do you think you're getting your message across?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes, I believe I'm getting my message across. That doesn't</p>
<p>   mean to say that everybody is agreeing with me but it's been</p>
<p>   a great opportunity over the last few hours to listen to people,</p>
<p>   to answer their questions and to put my own point of view. I'm</p>
<p>   a great believer in this kind of campaigning and politicking. I</p>
<p>   think that's the best way. You go and look people in the eye,</p>
<p>   you hear what their complaints are, you answer their questions,</p>
<p>   and you say no when it's not possible to say yes, or it's</p>
<p>   irresponsible to say yes and over time you have a much greater capacity</p>
<p>   to explain yourself and to persuade people than through other methods</p>
<p>   of communication. Although they are important too. I wouldn't</p>
<p>   down play the importance of other methods of communication.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Do you think you've won any votes?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER: </p>
<p>Oh, look I don't know. It's too early to sort of make</p>
<p>   judgements about that. This is not the first time I've been</p>
<p>   to regional Queensland. I've been a regular visitor to regional</p>
<p>   Queensland all my political life but I dealt with some issues both</p>
<p>   this morning and last night that needed to be dealt with arising</p>
<p>   out of the events of the last few weeks and I'll go on doing</p>
<p>   that. I just deliver the message as I believe it to be without any</p>
<p>   embellishment.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Do you see this as an uphill battle though? Given what people have</p>
<p>   been saying to you.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER: </p>
<p>I never concede anything's an uphill battle, Fleur. I'm</p>
<p>   a supreme optimist and all my political career I've been told</p>
<p>   that things have been an uphill battle and I've managed to</p>
<p>   get up the hill.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, do you think you are just giving One Nation more credibility</p>
<p>   by describing them now as one of the four main parties?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, it is one of the four main parties in the State house in</p>
<p>   Queensland. Look, you can't deal with something unless you</p>
<p>   deal with reality. 23% of the Queensland people voted for the party</p>
<p>   in the last election. I don't agree with their decision but</p>
<p>   it is only going to add people to those ranks by behaving in a,</p>
<p>   how shall I put it, contemptuous way towards those people. You've</p>
<p>   got to understand why they did it and try and persuade them not</p>
<p>   to do that at a general election, at a federal election, and that</p>
<p>   is of course my main aim. Many of those people are people who voted</p>
<p>   for the Liberal and National parties in the past and I want them</p>
<p>   to vote Liberal and National at the next federal election. So </p>
<p>you don't sort of start off by insulting them. You start off</p>
<p>   by saying, right you've got a perfect right in a democracy</p>
<p>   to express a point of view. I want to talk to you and say why the</p>
<p>   next time you have an opportunity to express a point of view you</p>
<p>   ought to express in our favour.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>With Queensland now a Labor State, you've got two of the big</p>
<p>   mainland States - Labor Governments. Is that going to make a difference</p>
<p>   in a federal election?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I don't know. I will deal with the elected Government of Queensland...</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>No, in terms of, you know, their sort of, you know, Howard speak</p>
<p>   from the (inaudible) as it were to have....</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I don't know actually, I'm not quite sure that it works</p>
<p>   that way. Sometimes it's been known to work in the opposite</p>
<p>   direction.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Are you disappointed Mr Beazley has in fact been able to form Government....?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I accept that the Queensland people voted in a certain way and</p>
<p>   he's now the Premier. I'm sorry that Mr Borbidge is no</p>
<p>   longer the Premier. I though Mr Borbidge was a very good Premier,</p>
<p>   I had a very good working relationship with him. He displayed considerable</p>
<p>   courage on the gun control issue and I therefore regret that he</p>
<p>   is no longer in charge, but I'll work with the new Premier.</p>
<p>   I congratulate Mr Beattie, and naturally as Prime Minister, I will</p>
<p>   work with the elected premiers of all the States.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>... is it something of a relief for you not to have to defend the</p>
<p>   Borbidge Government propped up by One Nation?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I never denigrate Liberal or National Party Governments. But the</p>
<p>   people of Queensland have spoken and that's it. I'm not</p>
<p>   going to hypothesise about what may have been. It's not. Queensland</p>
<p>   has a Labor Government and it is quite obvious that the high vote</p>
<p>   recorded by One Nation was a major cause why Queensland has a Labor</p>
<p>   Government. Now, I'm sure that a lot of the people who supported</p>
<p>   the One Nation Party will ponder that over the weeks and months</p>
<p>   ahead.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Mr Costello is saying that it is a whole of Government thing, that</p>
<p>   it should be a whole of Government thing to place One Nation after</p>
<p>   the ALP. Does that present a problem for the Nationals?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>There were some aspects of his interview were rather beaten up</p>
<p>   by one of the major media outlets this morning so I think you ought</p>
<p>   to go and talk to him about that.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Do you agree with him on the point that Hanson should...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I think principle... I thought I spent a great deal of time this</p>
<p>   morning talking about principle.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Is the outcome in Queensland the best result in terms of stable</p>
<p>   government in Queensland?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>The best result is to always have a Coalition Government. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>But given what the options were?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Look, that's the hypothesising about the past. Mr Borbidge</p>
<p>   gave stable government. It's obviously desirable that you have</p>
<p>   clean cut results. The situation now in Queensland you can't</p>
<p>   describe as clean or clear cut because neither of the major party</p>
<p>   groupings has an absolute majority and I better than anybody in</p>
<p>   Australia know the liability of not, well in our case, controlling</p>
<p>   both houses. But I accept what the people have decided. You have</p>
<p>   no right in a democracy to say well, - to the people - you got it</p>
<p>   wrong. The people never get it wrong when it comes to election outcomes</p>
<p>   because in a democracy the people have the say.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Mr Howard could you tell us if there's any progress on the</p>
<p>   Wik negotiations? How long [inaudible] before you have to say, well,</p>
<p>   no more?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I'm continuing to have discussions with Senator Harradine.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Is the deadline the end of next week or...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I continue to have discussions with Senator Harradine.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>With the result in Queensland... since you've been here, what</p>
<p>   implications does that have for the federal Government at the next</p>
<p>   federal election?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I remain confident about the outcome of the next federal election</p>
<p>   but as I've said from day one, I don't take the Australian</p>
<p>   people for granted, I'm not complacent. There are a number</p>
<p>   of messages that have come out of the Queensland election. One of</p>
<p>   the messages that I've mentioned before and I would mention</p>
<p>   again this morning, is that people are tired of the overtly confrontational</p>
<p>   style of national politics. I don't think anybody wins any</p>
<p>   votes with the fifteen second biff on evening television in Parliament.</p>
<p>   My view is that the public gets the impression that people are playing</p>
<p>   games while their problems are being ignored. Now, that is not true</p>
<p>   but that is the impression that people often get, and I have a very</p>
<p>   strong view that we should change and both sides of politics have</p>
<p>   an obligation to change that. It may take, in the eyes of some,</p>
<p>   a little colour out of question time, but the public wants a serious</p>
<p>   addressing of their problems and they want to believe that there</p>
<p>   problems are being addressed seriously all the time and if a perception</p>
<p>   is given that they are not, then that weakens their respect for</p>
<p>   the system and it weakens their faith in the Parliamentary process,</p>
<p>   and as somebody who's a passionate believer in the Westminster</p>
<p>   system of parliamentary democracy I think that's an unfortunate</p>
<p>   thing and I think we should all make a contribution to that.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Will you be holding a series of public meetings like this throughout</p>
<p>   the election campaign. Is this the way you think is the right way</p>
<p>   to go?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I haven't given any real thought to the detail of the</p>
<p>   election campaign but I like public meetings as you can see. And</p>
<p>   I think they are a very energising part of the political process,</p>
<p>   but I haven't got into any detailed planning about the campaign</p>
<p>   and it is premature of me to start talking about it.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, workers are concerned that they're going to</p>
<p>   lose valuable Asian contracts because we now have an One Nation</p>
<p>   Member here. How concerned are you that that could happen.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, no Asian investor, or no Asian purchaser should be concerned</p>
<p>   about making contracts with Australian companies. As Prime Minister</p>
<p>   of Australia I just make it plain that Asian investment, Asian contracts</p>
<p>   are extremely important to this country, and indeed, a company like</p>
<p>   Walkers is living proof of the importance of the regional connection</p>
<p>   to Australia's economy, living proof of the wisdom of the Australian</p>
<p>   Government helping to sustain the economies of Asian countries.</p>
<p>   Those who run around saying that we should not give help to the</p>
<p>   ailing Asian economies fail to realise the way in which they help,</p>
<p>   those Asian economies, help communities like Maryborough by buying</p>
<p>   the cars and so forth that are manufactured here. I mean, here's</p>
<p>   a direct living proof of the importance of that link.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>But Walkers have just retrenched 300 workers which the third of</p>
<p>   their work force the economy as a result is collapsing. What is</p>
<p>   the Federal Government going to do?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>When you say the economy is collapsing, that was not the message</p>
<p>   I got from the management or the work force today. I think that</p>
<p>   is an exaggerated thing to say, and I don't accept it. But</p>
<p>   what the point I was making is that the importance of the Asian</p>
<p>   economic link and therefore the need to nurture that link and to</p>
<p>   be receptive to it and to be encouraging to it, is really driven</p>
<p>   home in an area like Maryborough. I mean, here you have what 600</p>
<p>   people, the largest private sector employer probably in the region,</p>
<p>   this has now got the biggest iron foundry in Australia, and they're</p>
<p>   selling their product to countries like Malaysia and Hong Kong.</p>
<p>   Now, if you wanted a practical demonstration of the stupidity of</p>
<p>   discouraging foreign investment or foreign associations or Asian</p>
<p>   economic links, you've got it right here staring you in the</p>
<p>   face. Thank you.</p>
