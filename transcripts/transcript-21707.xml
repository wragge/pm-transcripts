    <content><![CDATA[<p>I am delighted to announce a highly significant development in the bilateral relationship between Australia and Japan, our largest trading partner and the world's second-biggest economy.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Koizumi and I tonight agreed that Australia and Japan would undertake a feasibility study into a Free Trade Agreement. The study would be completed within two years.</p>
<p>More broadly, we agreed to look at ways to further elevate and enhance the strong economic relationship between our two countries.</p>
<p>During our talks in Tokyo, I emphasised to Mr Koizumi the continued primacy of Japan for Australia both as a longstanding economic and trade partner, and in working together to contribute to global and economic security.</p>
<p> Australia's commitment to working alongside Japan to support the reconstruction of Iraq and assist in the political transition was welcomed by Mr Koizumi.</p>
<p>I welcome the launch of negotiations on a bilateral social security agreement. The Australian Government is pleased that good progress has been made by the two countries towards the negotiation of a government-to-government agreement on competition issues.</p>
<p>Australia and Japan will continue to work closely on a range of global and regional issues, including counter-terrorism, non-proliferation and development cooperation.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Koizumi and I restated our mutual interest in the success of the Doha Round and our shared aspirations for APEC in 2005.</p>
<p>Mr Koizumi told me that Japan supported firmly Australian participation in open and inclusive regional institutions, including the East Asian Summit.  I reiterated Australia's support for Japan becoming a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council.</p>
<p>Australia's commitment to the Aichi Expo and the Australia-Japan Year of Exchange in 2006 was warmly welcomed by Prime Minister Koizumi.   </p>
