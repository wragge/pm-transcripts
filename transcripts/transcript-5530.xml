MEDIA WEDNESDAY, MARCH 4 1981<br />
CONDOLENCE SPEECH FOR THE<br />
LATE SENATOR JOHN KNIGHT<br />
M4r. Speaker, I move that the House expresses its deep regret<br />
at the death this day of Senator John William Knight, a<br />
Senator for the Australian Capital Territory from 1975 and.<br />
Government Whip in the Senate from 1980, places on record its<br />
appreciation of his long and meritorious public service, and<br />
tenders its profound sympathy to his widow and the members of<br />
his family in their bereavement.<br />
John Knight was'born in 1943 at Armidale in New South Wales.<br />
He was an Honours graduate from the University of New England.<br />
He was awarded a Fulbright Scholarship in 1968, and took a<br />
Masters Degree at the East West Centre in HF waii. In 1975<br />
he was a visiting Fellow at the A. N. U..<br />
He joined the Department of Foreign A! f airs in 1965, and<br />
served in India, Fiji and Saudi Arabia. He-was Senior Private<br />
Secretary to the then Leader of tie opposition from 1973-74.<br />
He was electe d to this Parliament in 1975 as Liberal Senator<br />
for the and was subsequently re-elected in 1977 and<br />
in 1980.<br />
' John Knight was a Member of this Parliament only for a short<br />
time. But he had already made his mark. He was active on a<br />
wide variety of committees, he represented the Parliament and<br />
the-Government on a number of overseas delegations, he had<br />
been Government Deputy Whip in the Senate from 1978 and was<br />
elected Government Whip in the-Senate less than four months<br />
ago. John Kni ght lived an active and vigorous life. He was a<br />
dedicated representative of the He was concerned with<br />
the design of Canberra, and with all aspects of its welfare. / 2<br />
A/ 404, fAy </p>
<p>-2-<br />
He was patron of the A. C. T. Rugby Union! the A. C. T. Amateur<br />
Swimming Association, and the A. C. T. Life Saving Association.<br />
He had a particular concern and involvement with the<br />
International Year of the Disabled Person. He had just<br />
finished the final manuscript of a book on the role of the<br />
backbench in foreign policy.<br />
This simple factual account of John Knight's career, while<br />
showing his significant work, inadequately depicts his contribution<br />
to life in the Australian Capital Territory, and its rich<br />
promise for t,-he future.<br />
There is no doubt that John Knight would have had a significant<br />
career. He not only represented the people of the A. C. T.<br />
well but he had a broad interest in international affairs.<br />
He was a contributor, a thinker he was concerned.<br />
His colleagues on both sides of Parliament will miss him<br />
for this.<br />
We all admired and valued his personal quality.<br />
Whatever the loss to the Senate,. the Parliament and the AustraLian<br />
Capital Territory might be, at this time we are all thinking<br />
much more of his wife, Karla, and the children.<br />
We are all deeply conscious of their tragedy in losing a<br />
husband arnd a father, so young and wiith so much promise.<br />
The real tragedy and the deepest loss is theirs.<br />
All that we can do is to hope that our recognition of the<br />
quality a~ id promise of John Knight's life will provide some<br />
comfort at this tragic time.<br />
The tragedy of John Knight's death has been compounded by<br />
the death of his father on Sunday.<br />
To Karla, who gave him tremendous love a nd support, and to<br />
his children and family, we extend our deepest sympathy. </p>
