N. C. D. C. in Canberra, and part-time Chairman of the Rleconstruction<br />
Commission in Darwin.<br />
With the advent of a new Minister in Mr Keating,, Mr Powell<br />
felt it was time for the Government to consider whether he should<br />
stand down as Chairman in favour of someone who would have more<br />
time to devote to the job and would be able to identify more closely<br />

coped with the difficult period of establishing the Commission.<br />
