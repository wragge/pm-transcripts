I am pleased to announce that the President of the Hellenic Republic, His Excellency Mr Constantinos Stephanopoulos, will visit Australia from 4 to 9 June, travelling to Melbourne, Canberra and Sydney.<br />
Australia and Greece share many historic ties.  We have been allies during the major conflicts of the twentieth century.  Australians and Greeks fought shoulder to shoulder during the World War II battles to defend mainland Greece and Crete.<br />
The Greek community in Australia makes an important and valued contribution both to the life of our nation and to relations between our two countries.  Over 600,000 Australians can claim Greek ancestry and Melbourne is justifiably proud of its status as one of the world';s largest Greek cities.  As hosts of the Olympic Games in 2000, Australians look forward with particular enthusiasm to joining in the celebration of the next Olympiad in Athens in 2004, when the games return to their ancient home.<br />
Greece and Australia have much to offer each other.  I welcome President Stephanopoulos'; visit and look forward to meeting the President for talks in Canberra on 6 June.</p>
