    <content><![CDATA[<p>Sydney</p>
<p>It was ten years ago today that fire tore into our nation's capital, killing four people, destroying almost 500 homes and changing forever the lives of so many Canberrans.</p>
<p>Ten years ago Australians watched-on as Canberrans pulled together and fought back. We saw tremendous scenes of selflessness, neighbours helping neighbours, first-time volunteers fighting fires alongside veteran emergency service personnel.</p>
<p>Many of the physical scars from ten years ago are now long faded. But, the emotional scars still linger.</p>
<p>Sadly, this story has been told before of other Australian communities, and it will be a story that is told again. But, with each fire we learn important lessons. Our preparedness, response and recovery becomes smarter, more efficient and more effective every year.</p>
<p>Today, I pay tribute to the people of Canberra and all those who supported the people of our nation's capital recover from this devastating day. </p>
<p>As we remember the tragic events in Canberra a decade ago, our thoughts are also with the many communities in Victoria and New South Wales that are today facing high temperatures and major bushfires.</p>
<p>Everyone should ensure they take the appropriate precautions to stay safe and monitor information from local emergency services as they work to protect lives and property.</p>
