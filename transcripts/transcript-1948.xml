FOR PRESS: P. M. No. 87/ 1968<br />
N. S. W. BUSHFIRES: COMMONWEALTH AID<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister, Mr. John Gorton<br />
I was distressed to hear of the shocking bushfires<br />
around Sydney and on the south coast of New South Wales.<br />
I would like the relatives of those who have lost their<br />
lives in the fires to know that they have the deepest sympathy of the<br />
Commonwealth Government and, I am sure, of all Australians. Our<br />
sympathy is also extended to those people who have lost their homes<br />
and other material possessions in the fires.<br />
I understand that the New South Wales Government<br />
has set aside $ 50, 030 for relief.<br />
I have today sent a telegram to the Premier of New<br />
South Wales telling him that the Commonwealth Government stands<br />
ready to assist his Government on a for basis for the relief of<br />
personal hardship and distress suffered by those people affected by<br />
the fires.<br />
