sBwo BY T3 PSZKM KUI! STZa, TKl mO. 1. J. = TXG<br />
flWSOM B nIAZLMI2 OF MiRDUS8P1 PRfSCIPL UD LIDERLZS<br />
Dr Hevson has today sold out Australia's indigenous<br />
people, the fair and democratic traditions of his<br />
country, and what remained of the liberal traditions of<br />
his party.<br />
In his address tonight he will be speaking not for a true<br />
Liberal Party, but a party of the nev right.<br />
And there is a pathetic and inexcusable dimension to this<br />
development Dr Hereon has brought it about not by<br />
strength, but by weakness. By a total failure to lead.<br />
The fey remaining moderates within the Liberal Party have<br />
been jettisoned along vith commonsense, principle and the<br />
national interest.<br />
Anyone vho thought that the Liberal Party had turned over<br />
a ney leaf after losing the election on a right wing<br />
platform was mistaken.<br />
There is nothing of substance in the Liberal Party's<br />
response to the Government's Nabo legislation to su~ gest<br />
that it has been guided by anything more than cynicism<br />
and opportunism.<br />
At the end of 12 months of intense and extensive<br />
negotiation with the major parties and the achievement of<br />
a remarkable degree of consensus and support for the<br />
legislation, Dr Newson now tells the Australian people<br />
that a Senate inquiry is needed.<br />
Nothing was ever needed less.<br />
What is needed nov is the just resolution which the<br />
legislation provides and an end to uncertainty.<br />
Dr Hewson has told the Australian people that he accepts<br />
the High Court's judgement on Native Title. </p>
<p>Yet tonight, he will tell them how be will embrace<br />
Premier Court's legislation which will wipe out Vative<br />
Title across Western Australia.<br />
In his press statement of today Dr Howson talks<br />
unctuously about an " undivided Australian nation" but<br />
tonight vill hand over responsibility for this national<br />
issue to a Premier bent on overturning the High Court's<br />
decision and denying the rights of indigenous<br />
Australians I remain confident that most Australians Vill reject Or<br />
Hewson's " response" for what it is, and that the<br />
Government's legislation vil survive such cynical and<br />
unprinciple4 opposition.<br />
