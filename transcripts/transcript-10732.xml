    <content><![CDATA[<p>E&amp;OE....................................................</p>
<p>CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, how are you?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I am very well.</p>
<p>CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>What's your comment on Senator Harradine's - what seems</p>
<p>   to be a rethink, what seems to be as he put it, he has blinked?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well Senator Harradine did approach me last week and during the</p>
<p>   course of that discussion he said he wanted to put forward some</p>
<p>   kind of compromise. You have got to remember that what we put forward</p>
<p>   is already a compromise. I haven't got anything from him yet,</p>
<p>   I'll obviously have a look at it but there are some basic issues</p>
<p>   involved for us. I will naturally have a look at what he is going</p>
<p>   to put forward when it arrives. It will need to come fairly soon</p>
<p>   because we are running out of time on this issue. I don't think</p>
<p>   it is fair to say, based on what he said to me last Friday, that</p>
<p>   he has "blinked" in relation to the right to negotiate.</p>
<p>   I don't quite know what he means by that but I like Senator</p>
<p>   Harradine, I respect the strength of feeling he has on this issue.</p>
<p>   We, of course, feel very strongly about it too. We want a regime</p>
<p>   which doesn't give special privilege to one section of the</p>
<p>   community. We have already compromised a long way. People should</p>
<p>   remember that our Bill is not an ambit claim - it's already</p>
<p>   a compromise. I will obviously talk to him and see precisely what</p>
<p>   he has in mind.</p>
<p>CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>When was the last time you spoke to him?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Last Friday. He rang me and we had quite a lengthy discussion.</p>
<p>CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>And did he give you any idea then that he was about to do a re-think?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, he wants to talk further about it and he is going to put</p>
<p>   a proposal to me. It's not, in my judgement, it's not</p>
<p>   right to say that it represented an acceptance of our position,</p>
<p>   on the right to negotiate. It was an indication on his part of a</p>
<p>   desire to talk further and see if a further compromise could be</p>
<p>   achieved. I reply, both privately and publicly, by saying that we</p>
<p>   have already compromised a long way. And people have made the mistake</p>
<p>   all along in relation to us on this issue of thinking that the Bill</p>
<p>   we've put forward is some kind of ambit claim.</p>
<p>CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>Well, quite clearly if you look at the Queensland election people</p>
<p>   want their Governments to be fairly strong on some things and I</p>
<p>   would think land rights and Wik would be one of them.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I don't think there is any doubt about that. This mess has</p>
<p>   been around now for a number of years. We had a mandate to fix it.</p>
<p>   The Labor Party, the Democrats, the Greens and thus far Senator</p>
<p>   Harradine have combined to stop us doing what the public asked us</p>
<p>   to do at the last election and that is fix this native title mess.</p>
<p>   Now we've been trying to do that for over two years and we</p>
<p>   have been very badly frustrated by the Labor Party and the Democrats</p>
<p>   and the Greens and Senator Harradine in relation to that. Now Senator</p>
<p>   Harradine has shown, unlike the Labor Party and the Greens and the</p>
<p>   Democrats, a willingness to talk about the matter further. Now we'll</p>
<p>   talk further and at this stage I don't think I can say any</p>
<p>   more about it. There is really nothing more that can be said.</p>
<p>CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>How much of a shock to you was that Queensland State election result?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>The One Nation vote was much bigger than I expected but it doesn't</p>
<p>   entirely surprise me. At a time of economic and social change people</p>
<p>   do feel vulnerable and if somebody comes along and says, look I've</p>
<p>   got all of the solutions, don't ask me to go into any detail</p>
<p>   but I can fix all of your problems overnight, then it's easy</p>
<p>   to sort of follow that and there has been quite a lot of that with</p>
<p>   One Nation. As time goes by the emptiness of their policy prescriptions</p>
<p>   will become more apparent. They will cease to be a novelty on the</p>
<p>   Australian political scene. They will have to in the Queensland</p>
<p>   Parliament take positions, vote on legislation, put forward arguments</p>
<p>   and people will see that there is nothing magical, there is nothing</p>
<p>   mystical about members of the One Nation Party and they will be</p>
<p>   judged like others. In other words, do they have real solutions</p>
<p>   or do they have no solutions at all?</p>
<p>CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>After that election I was amazed to hear people talking about oh</p>
<p>   the reason was the sale of Telstra and tax reform. Unbelievable</p>
<p>   really, I mean it's about land rights, reconciliation, Sorry</p>
<p>   Day, Wik, multiculturalism, dumping of subsidised foreign imports,</p>
<p>   political correctness, the Aboriginal industry, that's what</p>
<p>   all of that's about.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I certainly don't think the predominant issues were tax</p>
<p>   reform and the sale of Telstra. I think there was a feeling built</p>
<p>   up under the 13 years of the Labor Government of oppressive political</p>
<p>   correctness that if you deign to talk about issues like immigration</p>
<p>   you were told that you were a racist, that you were prevented from</p>
<p>   engaging in a lot of the open and full debate that we ought to have</p>
<p>   within our community. I think it is very easy after an event to</p>
<p>   rationalise, but the important thing is to keep asking yourself</p>
<p>   if you are a serious political participant, what is good for the</p>
<p>   future of the country and that is what we are doing. We are arguing</p>
<p>   the cause of tax reform because we think that will make a better</p>
<p>   Australia. It will make us more competitive, it will rid us of a</p>
<p>   system that is unfair. The present system is unfair and I believe</p>
<p>   over the weeks ahead advertising campaigns will highlight the weakness</p>
<p>   and the unfairness of the system. </p>
<p>CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>When you talk about tax reform, reform is a kind of a word that</p>
<p>   could mean absolutely anything. It could mean that somebody turns</p>
<p>   around and could be a loser out of that reform. Surely tax relief</p>
<p>   is a better way to describe it and I am sure that's what it</p>
<p>   involves?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well there'll certainly be personal tax relief but what we</p>
<p>   want to do is to change the whole system to make it fairer. We don't</p>
<p>   intend to put a goods and services tax on top of the existing taxes.</p>
<p>   A goods and services tax would replace existing taxes so that you</p>
<p>   are not adding to the overall tax burden. There would also be personal</p>
<p>   income tax relief. One of the advantages of a goods and services</p>
<p>   tax as distinct from the existing wholesale sales tax system is</p>
<p>   that it takes a burden off exporters and particularly in the context</p>
<p>   of debate about what is good and bad for the rural parts of Australia.</p>
<p>   The present tax system is a very heavy penalty on rural exporters</p>
<p>   because it makes them less competitive when they sell their products</p>
<p>   overseas. One of the strongest arguments in favour of tax relief,</p>
<p>   change reform, whatever you call it where you place existing indirect</p>
<p>   taxes like the wholesale sales tax with a broad based tax like goods</p>
<p>   and services tax is that it will make our exporters more competitive</p>
<p>   because there won't be any input taxes on their exports and</p>
<p>   that makes.....</p>
<p>CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>There aren't going to be any losers I wouldn't think?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well the tax cheats will lose and I don't think anybody will</p>
<p>   mind about that but certainly middle and low income earners will</p>
<p>   find themselves better off as a result of the package. And certainly</p>
<p>   people in rural Australia will be beneficiaries and they will see</p>
<p>   when the package comes out that the Coalition parties once again</p>
<p>   are the best friends that the people in the rural and regional Australia</p>
<p>   have got. </p>
<p>CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>Well here you are out selling it and Stan Wallis is putting dollars</p>
<p>   behind it and John Singleton is putting whatever behind it. I am</p>
<p>   surprised that it is so easy when everyone is going to win it except,</p>
<p>   as you say, the crooks.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I think like all of these things, Jeremy, it needs to be...the</p>
<p>   detail needs to be out there. It's very easy to run a fear</p>
<p>   campaign when you don't have all of the detail and it's</p>
<p>   not possible by reference to the details of the package to rebut</p>
<p>   the criticism. But inevitably in the lead-up to the release of something</p>
<p>   you get this period where the critics run around generating all</p>
<p>   sorts of fear but when the details come out people will see the</p>
<p>   sense. People will realise just how unfair the present system is</p>
<p>   as a result of what is going to be said over the weeks and months</p>
<p>   ahead about the weaknesses of the present system and with the details</p>
<p>   in their hands and I do ask people to suspend judgement until they</p>
<p>   see it. And I also ask people who care about the future of Australia</p>
<p>   to accept that we are living in a difficult world. The turbulence</p>
<p>   in Asia would have hit us a lot harder if we hadn't put our</p>
<p>   economic house in order and the next logical thing to do is to change</p>
<p>   the taxation system.</p>
<p>CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, I just want to get a reaction on two things. One</p>
<p>   is the advertisement in the paper put in by the entertainment industry,</p>
<p>   do you have a comment on what you might be able to do to, what appears</p>
<p>   to be in many peoples' eyes, keep the Australian industry alive?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, we are looking at the implications of that High Court decision</p>
<p>   and we are asking the ABA to, in effect, draft a new standard, a</p>
<p>   new code if you like, and until that new code has been drafted then</p>
<p>   the existing situation, the present situation, which does not count</p>
<p>   New Zealand as part of Australian content that that is going to</p>
<p>   remain in place while that new code is being drafted.</p>
<p>CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>So it is not really going to be major surgery just to put in what</p>
<p>   is a minor adjustment to protect the local product?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, the decision that was taken, we obviously, because it's</p>
<p>   a court decision, we either pay regard to that court decision or</p>
<p>   alternatively if we want to negate it we have to renegotiate the</p>
<p>   arrangement with New Zealand. I think it's a question of seeing</p>
<p>   what comes out of the ABA review and also bear in mind that until</p>
<p>   that has been completed the existing arrangements continue and I</p>
<p>   think it's important and I do understand the concerns of people</p>
<p>   in the entertainment industry, I also understand the interests of</p>
<p>   consumers. They have an interest in this as well and, of course,</p>
<p>   the television stations have some interest as well. So there are</p>
<p>   a lot of rights to be considered and what we have done is to ask</p>
<p>   the ABA to have a look at putting together a new set of principles,</p>
<p>   a new standard, and then when we have the result of that we'll</p>
<p>   be able to say more but until that has been completed the existing</p>
<p>   arrangements will continue.</p>
<p>CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>One more thing Prime Minister.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>The speculation about the tax [inaudible]. I don't know whether</p>
<p>   it has actually come from the tax office or somebody's just</p>
<p>   stirring the pot but Frank Guildford who was, I don't know</p>
<p>   whether you are across the case, the blood money from Saudi Arabia</p>
<p>   and the gift of a million dollars for the Adelaide Women's</p>
<p>   and Children's hospital. It seems that he might be caught up</p>
<p>   in some aspect of the capital gains tax?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I don't know all the details of his tax affairs and bear</p>
<p>   in mind that I can't really find anything out about it and</p>
<p>   I don't want to because that would be a breach of the privacy</p>
<p>   provisions of the Tax Act. I mean as I understand it he got $1.7</p>
<p>   million and $1 million has been donated to a hospital and that could</p>
<p>   be tax deductible but I don't know because I don't know</p>
<p>   all of the details. And if some money is being retained by him then</p>
<p>   perhaps the existing provisions of the tax law would operate in</p>
<p>   a way in relation to that but really I can't answer for the</p>
<p>   tax rights of every individual tax payer and it is just not possible</p>
<p>   for the Prime Minister or the Treasurer to be across the detail</p>
<p>   of every individual's taxation affairs. I don't know all</p>
<p>   the details of it and I really do think I can do none other than</p>
<p>   say, well the law will treat him in exactly the same way as it would</p>
<p>   treat any other Australian. You can't make a law on the run</p>
<p>   for individuals. I don't know what sort of advice he got from</p>
<p>   his lawyers when the matter was being discussed. I am very sympathetic</p>
<p>   to his position in relation to what was obviously a terrible thing</p>
<p>   that happened to his sister and I am very sympathetic towards the</p>
<p>   man on those grounds alone, and I know all Australians are, but</p>
<p>   presumably he got some legal advice when the matter was being discussed.</p>
<p>   I don't know what that legal advice is. Presumably he was told</p>
<p>   that if he did this there'd be a certain tax consequence, if</p>
<p>   he did something else there'd be another. I don't know</p>
<p>   what that is, and I have to say in relation to that that I can't</p>
<p>   answer your question because I am not across the detail. I can't</p>
<p>   be across the detail because I am not entitled to see the affairs</p>
<p>   of individual tax payers and neither I should and I can only say</p>
<p>   that it is a matter between him and his lawyers and the taxation</p>
<p>   office. And whilst expressing continued sympathy with him for the</p>
<p>   terrible family loss he suffered, I can't really take the matter</p>
<p>   any further.</p>
<p>CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>So they ........[inaudible] capital gain or compensation?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I think that is a matter that you'd have to get legal</p>
<p>   advice on and I imagine that he would of got legal advice on that</p>
<p>   when the matter was being negotiated. But once again that is a matter</p>
<p>   over which, you know, I can't answer because I am just not</p>
<p>   in possession of the detail.</p>
<p>CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>It looks like we are moving away from the idea of an early election?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I haven't ever at any stage said when the election was</p>
<p>   going to be. There has been speculation about an early election</p>
<p>   and people have made certain assumptions. I have never said when</p>
<p>   the election is going to be. If there is to be a double dissolution</p>
<p>   then that has to, the Parliament has to be dissolved, by not later</p>
<p>   than the 29th of October so that the election is held within, I</p>
<p>   guess, four to five weeks after then which is a normal time but</p>
<p>   if you don't have a double dissolution then the Parliament</p>
<p>   can run on until well into the first half of next year. Now, I have</p>
<p>   never said that there was going to be an early election. Equally,</p>
<p>   I have never ruled it out and people have made surmises based on</p>
<p>   what's occurring in Asia. They have said, well you'll</p>
<p>   have to do this, you'll have to do that. I have been a very</p>
<p>   interested bystander in all that comment like every other Prime</p>
<p>   Minister before me. I'll keep my options open. I'll choose</p>
<p>   a time that is in the best interests of the country. I'll obviously</p>
<p>   pay regard to Australia's interests and obviously as leader</p>
<p>   of the Government I have a responsibility to pay regard to the Government's</p>
<p>   interests as well. But, of course, Australia's interest takes</p>
<p>   paramount. We still have a number of months to run in our term.</p>
<p>   On the other hand if a double dissolution becomes necessary then</p>
<p>   that double dissolution has got to take place before the 29th of</p>
<p>   October and the election takes place within four or five weeks thereafter.</p>
<p>   Now that's the, I guess, the ballpark. I haven't made</p>
<p>   any decision. Nothing that's really happened over the last</p>
<p>   few weeks, including the Queensland election, has altered the position.</p>
<p>   I think if, in case it's in your mind in relation to opinion</p>
<p>   polls, I think it was inevitable after the Queensland election and</p>
<p>   in the wake of all the publicity that One Nation received, it was</p>
<p>   inevitable that One Nation would get a boost in the polls and that</p>
<p>   will stay around for a while because it's had such a surge</p>
<p>   of publicity and it's a new player on the field. It's</p>
<p>   a bit of a novelty but that will wear off and a better gauge of</p>
<p>   public opinion will be further down the track and I don't think</p>
<p>   people should see what's around at the moment as a totally</p>
<p>   reliable indicator of what might occur when a ballot actually takes</p>
<p>   place. But I don't take, react complacently to what occurred</p>
<p>   in Queensland. I've said that before, I take it very seriously.</p>
<p>CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>But if that Morgan Bulletin poll is right, there wouldn't</p>
<p>   be much point in a double dissolution because it's hard to</p>
<p>   get all the things that you want to get through in a joint sitting</p>
<p>   of the House, you just mightn't have the numbers according</p>
<p>   to that poll.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>It's very important with polls, Jeremy, to remember that in</p>
<p>   a time like this they can be very volatile. One Nation has had saturation</p>
<p>   coverage over the last ten days. It would have been quite extraordinary</p>
<p>   in those circumstances if its ratings had not gone up. Once the</p>
<p>   political agenda changes and publicity is given to other issues</p>
<p>   than I would expect that there'd be some change. But I don't</p>
<p>   discount what has occurred in Queensland but I do remember that</p>
<p>   only four or five weeks ago Newspoll, which has had a very good</p>
<p>   track record, had our level of support back to where it roughly</p>
<p>   was at the time of the last election. So there's a lot of volatility</p>
<p>   and think it's very important when people analyse polls and</p>
<p>   when they react to them to bear that volatility in mind and when</p>
<p>   you have the saturation coverage that One Nation has had over the</p>
<p>   past couple of weeks it would be quite astonishing if its support</p>
<p>   had not gone up. Absolutely astonishing. Remember when Mrs Kernot</p>
<p>   changed parties? The saturation of coverage that she received and</p>
<p>   there were all sorts of polls indicating this or that outcome. Now</p>
<p>   a lot of that has subsided. I don't align the two completely.</p>
<p>   I think there is a sense of bewilderment and a sense of vulnerability</p>
<p>   in the community which is the foundation of some of the One Nation</p>
<p>   support. I recognise that and I intend over the weeks and months</p>
<p>   ahead to respond to that as best I can but I do think we should</p>
<p>   keep a sense of balance and perspective about polls taken in the</p>
<p>   weight of absolutely saturation coverage</p>
<p>CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>[Inaudible} One Nation is way over there on the right, but surely...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well it is on some issues. It's a funny situation. It's</p>
<p>   policies on tax reform are the same as the Democrats and the Labor</p>
<p>   Party. It doesn't want tax reform. It's opposed to it.</p>
<p>   It's being just as negative on tax reform for example as the</p>
<p>   Democrats and the Labor Party.</p>
<p>CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>Yeah, well I'm not sure they even understand exactly what</p>
<p>   the word, what the tax reform issue....(inaudible)... and against</p>
<p>   that?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well they are. I've not heard anything from them to suggest</p>
<p>   that they're not also against tax reform like the Labor Party.</p>
<p>   It's very hard to neatly label them on the political spectrum.</p>
<p>   You might say they're on the right on some issues, in relation</p>
<p>   to other issues that may not be the case but....</p>
<p>CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>Would you work better with them in the Senate, better than the</p>
<p>   Greens and the Democrats?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Oh, look I think that is with respect a completely hypothetical</p>
<p>   question. I mean the Greens and the Democrats on important issues</p>
<p>   have been very difficult although on industrial relations the Democrats</p>
<p>   did give us some assistance. On Wik for example they've been</p>
<p>   obstructive. The Greens and the Democrats were more accommodating</p>
<p>   to Labor when it was in office than they have been to us. Obviously</p>
<p>   it's difficult for a Government, a centre-right Government</p>
<p>   such as the Coalition to be dealing with Democrats and Greens who</p>
<p>   are, on many issues, far to the left of us. Not only on economic</p>
<p>   but also many other issues. On the other hand there are many of</p>
<p>   the policies of One Nation, if it had Senators, that I would find</p>
<p>   difficult to work with. I'm not going to start picking and</p>
<p>   choosing between them. Obviously I want in any election, be it a</p>
<p>   double dissolution or a half-Senate election, I want the maximum</p>
<p>   number of Coalition Senators. I mean the people who are most obstructive</p>
<p>   to us, remember at the end of the day, are the Labor Party because</p>
<p>   they almost always vote against us.</p>
<p>CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, next time we talk I guarantee to have better lines</p>
<p>   of communication some how. I just want you to know I don't</p>
<p>   think it's at our end.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, well I don't, I'm not sure where it is either and...</p>
<p>CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>Thank you for bearing with us.</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p> Yeah, anyway look I appreciate that. Thanks very much and I gather</p>
<p>   you had a very nice holiday at Hamilton Island. </p>
<p>CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>It was wonderful.</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>That's terrific, you make me envious.</p>
<p>CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>Look after yourself.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Okay, thanks, bye bye.</p>
