PRIME MINISTER' S INTERVIEW WITH PETER COSTIGAN, MELBOURNE HERALD,<br />
.12 February 1976<br />
JESTION: philosophic question. Leaving aside all the current<br />
problems about the economy. What sort of Australia is it that<br />
you would like to lead?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Well, there's maximum independence for individuals, maximum<br />
opportunity for them to achieve what they want for themselves<br />
and their families. Where governments create a climate for<br />
this to take place, that encourages it. Where there' s maximum<br />
devolution of authority to state and local government.<br />
None of that is to imply an old fashioned laissez-faire<br />
attitude because there are obviously many things governments<br />
have to do. But if we go to government power in Australia<br />
and other western democracies in recent years. I think people have<br />
often forgotten the real place of the individual in society and that's<br />
what it's all about. Governments are not there to serve governonents.<br />
We're there to serve people. An Australia in which individual<br />
men and women have maximum freedom to choose their own<br />
lifestyle, what sort of work they want to do, the way they want<br />
to work out their own futures. It is my view that is an<br />
Australia which is going to be most productive and that also then<br />
becomes the Australia which enables you to do most for the<br />
people who.. are disadvantaged. In recent times, governments seem<br />
to have taken more and more power into their own hands, more and<br />
more control, into their own hands. They don't always ask if<br />
there is any real public benefit from that. We have restricted<br />
trade practices legislation and we need it. But the Ministers<br />
at the moment are looking at that legislation to make sure<br />
there is a public benefit from all the res-tricti-ons. Arnd the<br />
rs-tricted trade prac-tices leaislation ou'Th-to<br />
at as somnething Lo festrict people from oin thng z as<br />
something that preserves the freedom of the average People or the<br />
small business against the undue pressures that build up from<br />
large organisations or from groups of organisations or from<br />
monopolies and therefore should be something that preserves<br />
the freedom of individuals and the freedom of businesses.<br />
As long as you can do that, it would seem to me unnecessary to<br />
have restrictions unless there is a real public benefit flowing<br />
from them. And this is looking at restrictive trade legislation </p>
<p>2<br />
QUESTION: Do you think the average Australian still has the<br />
incentive to go and do it on his own or to...<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I think a great many do, but a number of people begin<br />
to feel that the incentive has been destroyed, that taxes are<br />
just taking too much. 1 know somebody who was Lunning a<br />
hunting, camping fishing and shooting lodge in the Northern<br />
Territory. They retired at the age of 42, because taxes just tookC<br />
too much... and so he's gone to have a peaceful life where they'll<br />
work a lot less. After a few years of that he might well get<br />
tired of it because he's a relatively young man. But government W<br />
destroyed his initiative his incentive to do things and that's<br />
certainly damaging not only to him it's damaging to Australia.<br />
QUESTION: This might not be a hypothetical question, but if if in fact<br />
people are not working as hard as they used to, if in fact they<br />
haven't got that incentive and if productivity is not increasing<br />
as it should, how do you change these habits?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: There needs to be inducements, people are going to work<br />
harder, people are going to produce more. Obviously they either<br />
feel that doing part of it at least for themselves and their<br />
families and the benefits not all going to the governments for tax<br />
gains and marginal tax scale, have got a significant impact<br />
on things like this. When I was shadowing in the labour job in<br />
Opposition, I met a lot of people on the factory floor, saying<br />
" What is the point of working five days a week. The Government<br />
just takes too much of the fifth day's pay." It wasn't that<br />
they had any particular objection to workingT-was _ jsut that<br />
thie government had established the circumstances in which, in terms of<br />
the marginal return, they would get on their incomes wasn't<br />
worthwhile.<br />
? UESTION: You've already put a lid on the growth of the public service.<br />
In the long term do you see any greater emphasis in switching away<br />
from that very high percentage of Australians wqho are working<br />
for Government? </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER: If we can produce government services to people more<br />
economically and efficiently, that should be our objective.<br />
I can think in a number of areas where we can use voluntary agencies<br />
to a greater extent than we have and perhaps especially in<br />
the welfare area. The voluntary welfare organisations have a<br />
number of advantages. They're independent, they've providad<br />
independent criticisms of policies that are being pursued,<br />
the delivery of policies whether certain objectives that you act<br />
for have been achieved by the policies. They can often<br />
dispense assistance much more economically than a governnlpent<br />
bureaucracy. And they can often assess the need and see an emerging<br />
need more quickly than a government bureaucracy. And I think<br />
irl the past there might have been a tendency for governments<br />
or departments to look upon the voluntary agencies as competitors.<br />
SIn the last budget there was an attempt to cut down the grants<br />
to them. I think they ought not to be looked upon as competitors.<br />
They can play a very valuable role.<br />
We have got a better educated community and that ought to be one<br />
in which individuals and groups of people in their own communities<br />
therefore are in a better position to make judgements about their<br />
own future than may have been the case when education was restricted<br />
* to a few and when it wasn't general and when more kids left<br />
school at the age of 12 and 13 and 14. As people have become<br />
better educated especially in the years since the way so too there<br />
has been a centralisation of power especially in the last two<br />
or three years. It seems to be saying that even though you are<br />
better educated you must have less influence on the decisions<br />
that affect your lives where government sought to be saying<br />
the very opposite you are better educated community, you<br />
ought to takirig -more resor'sibility for t-he deci iions tnhaz<br />
affect yourselves and your own community. I would have thought<br />
that's really what people want. They want to be responsible,<br />
they want to make decisions that affect them and government<br />
have got to establish these circumstances.<br />
IJESTION: Leading onto the world scene. Do you see a -trend in the<br />
rich countries and our sort of countries, to' conservatism?<br />
Are people reacting against big government? </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER: I Think in some areas there is a reaction ag. ainst<br />
extremes of socialism ana the extravagance of government<br />
expenditure but how far that rea. tion has gone I wouid<br />
find it very difficult to judge. Cne of the great problems<br />
in the western democracies our kind of country is that<br />
people are basically independent. They want to do things<br />
for themselves, they don't wart to he regimented. And it's<br />
much harder to marshall such a people to a common cause, a common<br />
objective, than it is in some other countries that there is<br />
no need to name, where regimentation has happened more than<br />
once in fairly recent history. But at the same time,<br />
because of the indepenident nature of individuals and people<br />
in a country like Australia, Britain or the United States,<br />
it probably makes the leadership, the Government of those<br />
countries of even greater importance in maintaining the morale<br />
the resolution and the determination of the nation, especially<br />
when there is some difficult decisions to be made. There<br />
have been too many politicans going around offering the easy<br />
way out suggesting more or suggesting that we have the resources<br />
to pursue every wcrthwhile plan at one and the same time. T. ixd<br />
the Governments aren't really elected to do the nice and<br />
pleasant things all the time. They're elected to take the course<br />
they believe to be right. In the nature of things a lot of<br />
decisions are going to bze unpopular with a nui. iber of people<br />
because resources are limited. That means governments have<br />
to be able to say no.<br />
UESTION: That's supposed to be politically unpopular? Do you think<br />
it is possible with this more educated community that the public<br />
will in fact recognise that?<br />
' RIME MINISTER: In the short term it is politically unpopular. And it<br />
might be politically unpopular in terms of the immediate reaction<br />
you get from particular pressure groups, and therefore with<br />
noises you get through the media. But I also believe it is<br />
something the general community recognises as being responsible.<br />
And therefore politically popular. Responsibility is what<br />
people I believe want to see in government almost more than<br />
anything else, especially when they've had a dose of great<br />
irresponsibility. </p>
<p>UESTION: Switching to foreign policy and Australia's alliances.<br />
I think you did refer to the ANZUS treaty as being the mos t<br />
important aspect of Australia's foreign policy or words<br />
to that effect?<br />
? RIME MINISTER: Well Mr Peacock's used those words. The ANZUS alliance<br />
is obviously of great importance to us, to New Zealand,.<br />
and I believe also of significant importance to the United<br />
States. But our foreign policy has got much more to it than<br />
that. We'do need closer relationships with the countries<br />
to our north and closer relations with Japa-n and we need<br />
a better understanding with China. That is why it was a closest<br />
priority to visit the ASEAN countries, Japan and China before<br />
going, as one might have expected from a traditional Liberal<br />
leader paying a visit to Washington and London. When the time<br />
does come round for that I think those sorts of visits<br />
can be much more useful, if I've got abetter perspective<br />
of the way in which countries in our own region, the western<br />
Pacific, and east Asia think about current events.<br />
With Japan in particular there's need for greater strengthening<br />
of our relations. We need to work for greater stability<br />
of trade between the two countries. Their Prime Minister in<br />
the message sent after the election said that they hoped the<br />
Australia-Japanese Treaty could be concluded speedily. We've<br />
already taken decisions as a government that will enable the<br />
negotiations which were suspended last year, to begin again,<br />
and I hope we can meet the wishes of Japan in relation to this.<br />
We'd like to see a treaty concluded also. one of the things Mr<br />
Anthony will be pursuing in Japan at the moment is not only<br />
a need -for us or them to understand e a oina to be<br />
r -l1ia h 1e -long-term suppliers but. the need to -make Sure there iLs<br />
going to be greater long-term stability of trade both ways.<br />
They want a reliable access to our markets as we want a<br />
reliable access to their markets for the commodities we sell to them.<br />
It's not only a question of coal and iron ore to the extent<br />
that beef and primary products are sold in Japan. It's<br />
much better to have a steady and continuing market to one<br />
that's wide open one minute and can be chopped right off the next.<br />
So there are a number of areas where we're hoping to achieve<br />
stability in that relationship. This is important not only for </p>
<p>the whole region. Japan, the United States and Australia have<br />
all got key rcles to play in the Pacitic region and the relationship<br />
is one that's one part of it very much depends on what the<br />
others do. There's a complementary nature to the economies<br />
of the three countries.<br />
QUESTION: What about Canada? A similar country which Australia doesn't<br />
seem to every think about very much.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Canada's interest in our part of the world is to some extent<br />
limited I think. There was a move some years ago to develop a<br />
broader interest in the Pacific region but that move didn't seem<br />
to carry forward with its original impetus. We'd welcome<br />
a greater involvement by Canada in affairs in our part of the<br />
world but they seem traditionally to be either preoccupied with<br />
their southern relationship or to be tending towards Europe.<br />
These are factors of geography I think. But Canada and Australia<br />
have many characteristics in common.<br />
UESTION: The provincial government, state government federal situation?<br />
RIME MINISTER: Yes.<br />
UESTION: The Indian Ocean. The Opposition. Leader has suggested that<br />
your comments and the comments of your Ministers have been<br />
stimulating the possibility of an expansion of a sort of arms<br />
race in the Indian Ocean. How do you...?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: This is one of the areas in which Mr Whitlam is talking<br />
a great deal of nonsense. Russian sailing days are three times<br />
the s~ iiiing days of the United States. Russia, with facilities<br />
and in sailing days, has kept the pace up. Russia started to use<br />
the Suez Canal for her military vessels. Clearly they want to<br />
link up with the BlackSea-Mediterranean fleet with the<br />
Pacific-Vladivostok fleet. And they can do it now. There needs<br />
to be a balance. We'd like to see the balance at the lowest level<br />
possible. But what I have said is that the-objectives that<br />
some people have for a neutral zone seems somewhat remote.<br />
Nobody really suggests that they can negotiate Russia out<br />
of the Indian Ocean. In fact I would go so far as to way that that </p>
<p>would be a complete and absolute impossibility and China would<br />
agree with me. And I also believe a number of the Littoral<br />
states would agree wiith me, no matter whatpublic statements<br />
might be made, no matter what official policies might be put.<br />
Now it's quite possible for the states to have a particular<br />
view which is a long-term objective but at the sa-me time to<br />
recognise that it's not capable of achievement within the forseeable<br />
future. Now that's a legitimate and proper position to take.<br />
But having said all that, when Russian activity in the Indian<br />
Ocean is so far ahead of the United States' activity it seems<br />
somewhat unreal to adopt the sort of view that Mr WNhitlam<br />
adopts that the United States should not develop pretty modest<br />
facilities at Diego Garcia which are quite essential to<br />
maintaining a balance. And even with that, it won't be<br />
a balance because Russia will be ahead. And Diego Garcia<br />
is not only important in relation to the Indian Ocean<br />
activities. It could at some stage have a significant influence<br />
on a resupply situation in Israel if war ever again emerged.<br />
And if the criticial events in Portugal, the Azores became<br />
unavailable there are alternative way through area supplythat's<br />
a complicated and difficult and dependin4 upon the<br />
circumstances dangerous operation. Diego Garcia<br />
could also be significant in guaranteeing oil supplies out of<br />
the Middle East to countries east of Diego Garcia andof course<br />
Japan, is one of the mail oil users. We'd have a special<br />
interest in that. -So, what we're saying or our policy is not<br />
escalating what's occuring it's encouraging a realistic response<br />
to what has already occurred. I've mentioned my views<br />
about this particular matter, and before I went to Kuala Lumpur<br />
and Singapore not one of the four leaders of the ASEAN countries<br />
sucgestedJ thIat tlhis was an inappro-. priate v-iow, to ha-le. V-' n<br />
fact whien the subject did come up with one their<br />
views were pretty much identical with mine and none of the others<br />
were concerned. I think they recognised that this was a realistic<br />
view.<br />
JESTION: I think I can guess who the one was.<br />
The new American Ambassador after he was confirmed said he was<br />
going to urge Australia to allow the U. S. to build an Omega base </p>
<p>here. This is the controversial, I suppose, communications<br />
facility Have you made a decision about that?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Well it hasn't come before the Government, but this is<br />
a navigational device, it's not of particular importance<br />
in any military activity if of any importance it's a<br />
navigational device and a number of countries around the world<br />
are participating in. And I can't see why Australia shouldn't.<br />
There've been very extensive inquiries concerning it.<br />
UESTIO': Almost a personal question. You've comr. under attack in various<br />
ways and you've been in politics many years. Specifically<br />
when you're accused of things like changing your policy on<br />
indexation, your accused of being ruthless etc. internally,<br />
in the Party and so on. How do you personally feel about that?<br />
Do you lie awake at night?<br />
RIME MINISTER:... about accusations?<br />
UESTION: Yes.<br />
RIME MINISTER: All you can do at any one time as a Politican with all<br />
the facts and knowledge available to you is try and make the<br />
decision you believe to be right. If you've done that, that's<br />
all you can do. If other people disagree with you well<br />
you'd obviously sooner they'd agreed with you but if they<br />
disagree that's their right. So often in this sort of thing,<br />
people's judgement is colored by what they themselves want,<br />
what they themselves expect. When we said we are prepared<br />
to modify our view in relation to the Prices Justification Tribunal<br />
when we had had conversations with the trade uin moveent,<br />
employers, business concerning its future that was welcomed.<br />
A good degree of flexibility, not being too rigid. When, for a<br />
number of the same considerations we felt that our view about<br />
wage indexation should to some extent be modified, because<br />
maybe unexpected, it attracted predictable criticism from people<br />
like Mr Hawke. But pecple took a different judgement of it.<br />
Maybe it took them more by surprise. But I think they also took a<br />
different judgement of it because this was a harddecision and<br />
because it was a hard decision it tended to line other people </p>
<p>u-what side of the fence are you on in relation to it.<br />
I got a very strong view that a majority of people out in the<br />
streets, trade unionists, and others support the decision<br />
that we took. They know very well that the continued escalation<br />
of wages and salaried just can't go on and in the end when we<br />
saw the extent of the CPI rise we felt we had to put some arguments<br />
to the Commission because of the policies that we were invol~ ved<br />
in and restraining our1 own expenditure we believed that here was<br />
a great opportunity for the Arbitration Commission to break<br />
the inflationary spiral. What the commission does is of immense<br />
importance to the total Australian economy. And there are two<br />
sets of arguments in relation to this one we didn't press<br />
all that hard because of the earlier Medibank position but we'll<br />
press it very hard in the future, that's the indirect tax<br />
argument. If that's automatically to flow through to employees<br />
it virtually means that if the Government had a policy of relieving<br />
the income tax burden and relativey a great weight of tax was on<br />
indirect taxes. I must take a hypothetical exaniple, that employees<br />
would almost automatically be exempt from that sort of move<br />
and that a government's budgetary position is much more heavily<br />
circumscribed because of the present policy of the Commission<br />
in relation to the inclusion of indirect taxes. But the real<br />
thrust of our argument on this occasion was that a flow on of the<br />
sic point four percent would lead in some industries to higher<br />
unemployment because with higher prices they wouldn't be able<br />
to sell as much of their product and for other industries that<br />
would be able to sell their product with higher prices.<br />
It would just be another move in the inflationary spiral.<br />
And that the Price Justification Tribunal for industries that<br />
are committed to go before it would be bound to take it<br />
into accol-, nz a a si,-jni~ ican' -, cre ae<br />
was going to do was make it harder to get jobs, make it<br />
harder to control inflation and we believe that in the<br />
interests of all Australians, employees, in particular, controlling<br />
inflation and getting jobs available are the highest priorities.<br />
There' s an argument that Mr Hawke uses which in other<br />
circumstances would be valid, but in the present, one is not.<br />
He says that it needs to be a consumption-led recovery and<br />
therefore you need higher wages. Well there have been higher<br />
wages solidly over the past two years. There've been a couple of tax </p>
<p>cuts which have hardly been tax cuts because of the progressive<br />
tax scale but anyway some cha-nges to the tax scale which did put<br />
some more money in the hands of consumers. But all they did was<br />
save more dnd the Hawke argument is a false one because under<br />
present circumstances too many people are concerned at what<br />
inflation is going to do. Is their job going to be available<br />
in three months or six months. Are prices just going to go<br />
on going up and up and if people feel these things individuals<br />
aren't going to spend more in a real sense and so the things<br />
that stop them spending are the very same things that's<br />
stopping bdsinesses investing. It all gets back to inflation.<br />
And, with all that, this wasn't an easy decision to take.<br />
We knew what would be said of us. It would have been much easier<br />
to go down the other path. But if you like, with later knowledge<br />
with later advice, we had to argue the cause that we did.<br />
QUESTION: Just a couple of quick questions. You'll be standing up for<br />
the first time as the elected Prime Minister. Do you<br />
get any feeling about that excitement and how do you<br />
see this first Parliament of your regime, if I might use the word?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I suppose there is some feeling of excitment. But<br />
imore there is a sense of the enormity of the job that has to<br />
be done and not from the nature of the job itself, but because<br />
of the position that Australia is in at the moment. And we're<br />
not going to be able to overcome the problems of Australia unless<br />
there is a recognition by a majority of people in Australia<br />
that the Government has to take some unpleasant decisions, that<br />
there are some difficult things to be done. And that's basically<br />
why w: iø were elected. That quite apart from the view<br />
have uf Australia and the nura of A; straian -society.<br />
There'll be some significant areas where we'll want our<br />
policies introduced as soon as possible and as soon as there can<br />
be appropriate consultations with the community secret ballot<br />
legislation is part of that. And there's always a lot of dull,<br />
routine andnecessary legislation through the Parliament. But<br />
one of the problems of the last two or three . years is that<br />
there's been a good deal of legislative indigestion and nothing<br />
like enough attention paid to the plain and if you like, dull </p>
<p>11.<br />
administration of the country. Sitting do,.-n behinidn a<br />
desk and seeing that the ship of state is moving/ the right<br />
direction. Passing bills do'esn't achieve that. It's a question of<br />
administration, seeking that yourpublic service is working<br />
properly, seeking that government services are getting<br />
delivered in an efficient manner to the people that need thorn.<br />
This is, I believe, one of the areas where the previous<br />
Government fell down, greatly. And the public service was in part<br />
hampered because there was so much legislation that theyuare<br />
finding it increasingly difficult t o do the nornal jobs that the<br />
service had to do. Some departments doubled in size in a<br />
matter of a year br two. No organisationi can grow that quickly'<br />
and do it efficeitnly and effectively.<br />
JESWN: So, compared with recent experience, you don't expect this to be..<br />
to spend that much time in Parliament, or at least,<br />
that Parliament will be sitting shorter...<br />
? RIME MINISTER: I think the Parliament might be sitting a long timequite<br />
a long ti-me, but we would want a good debate on the address<br />
in reply. We'd want a. good debate on foreign policy, of<br />
Australia's place in the world. We'd want useful debates on what's<br />
happening to Australia internally. We-' d want the Parliament<br />
to become a more effective forum. Nojw all of this can be<br />
encompassed by debates initiated by a Minister or by myself<br />
in addition to the address in reply and its all a useful<br />
part of the work of a member of Parliament. We'll want to<br />
establish an expenditure committee in the fashion of the<br />
House of Commons, which will work alongside the public accounts<br />
comnit~. B.--hins iareij were/-HouSe -; Znatve<br />
has been very much deficient, wher e I think governments have<br />
always thought that an expenditure committee is going to be<br />
a bit of a nuisance to departments it will be a nuisance<br />
to governments let's just not bother about it.<br />
I can remember 12 years ago originally advocating such a<br />
committee in our own Party room under the then government of<br />
the day and I've done it in Opposition. Well, there's<br />
a chance now to achieve that. But there's an important watchdog </p>
<p>12.<br />
rc. e for Parliament and especially in the present circumstances<br />
with econiomy tha name of the game. They had a committee of the<br />
Parliament oversighting the way in whicb departments drew<br />
up their estimates and getting in underneath the figures<br />
themselves to really learn how things are done. We'll make<br />
the Parliament a mort effective instrument of control of the<br />
public purse.<br />
UESTION: I don't want to put words into your mouth, but is this one<br />
way you're going to involve your great army of backbenchers? 0<br />
PRIME MINISTER: That's one way, certainly. And a very important way.<br />
We've had a party committee meeting oVer the last couple of<br />
months. Cabinet considered its report two or three days ago.<br />
That report will be debated in the party toom and it sets<br />
out a framework of committees, structures for the party<br />
room operation. And I think its a very good report. I hope<br />
it gets the general support of the party. It is important<br />
that members feel they have a role. But there's one other point<br />
I'd like to make about this. There are some members ot<br />
Parliament who'll always work no matter what the difficulties<br />
might be, whether they're a private mzmber or whether they're<br />
a Minister. There aie some others who don't work so hard.<br />
You can't force a member of Parliament to work, you can't<br />
hand feed him. You can encourage and for new members you can<br />
guide. You can stimulate, help to create a climate in which<br />
members of Parliament will want to work, and even if encouraging<br />
it does sometimes make it uncomfortable for the Ministers of<br />
the Government. But that's part of the role. But basically<br />
the wish to work has to come from insidle the mind and heart<br />
of the meLber himself. it's my hope and belief that the great<br />
majority of our new members will be in that mould. </p>
