M4r Justice Samuels, ( Chancellor)<br />
Professor Burt, ( Vice-Chancellor)<br />
Professor Fitzgerald, ( Director, Asia-Australian Institute)<br />
Distinguished guests,<br />
Ladies and Gentlemen,<br />
We are meeting tonight on the shores of Sydney Cove. This<br />
is not where I expected to give this, the first Asia lecture<br />
for the Asia-Australia Institute. But it is appropriate to<br />
the occasion, ad to wht I will have to say.<br />
The Asia lectures, and the Asia-Australia Institute itself,<br />
have been established to address one of the truly<br />
foundational issues of Australia's national life: our<br />
relationship with Asia.<br />
That issue has been with us, dogging our thoughts and<br />
actions, literally since our foundation since the First<br />
Fleet put ashore the first European settlers at this place<br />
in 1788. Since that time, while we have built the city and<br />
the nation which surrounds us, we have been struggling to<br />
reconcile the facts of our geography with the preoccupations<br />
of race, of history, and of sentiment.<br />
Much of our history as a nation is the history of this great<br />
intellectual struggle. At one level, that struggle is<br />
itself an essential and enduring element of our national<br />
identity; our evolution as a nation will always reflect the<br />
interaction of the European heritage of many of our<br />
population with the Asian and Pacific environment in which<br />
we live.<br />
But at another level a very important level the issues<br />
are ones to be addressed, resolved, and put behind us. We<br />
have already, or almost, done this in some vital areas: we<br />
are drawing closer and closer to Asia.<br />
We were tragically reminded of that this week, with the<br />
intense personal and national shock we felt at the<br />
assassination of Rajiv Gandhi. 7615<br />

<p>A most important step in drawing closer to Asia is that we<br />
have accepted, and welcomed, the fact that people from Asia<br />
form part, and most likely an increasing part, of our<br />
population, and that Asian culture will, likewise, form an<br />
increasing part of our national heritage.<br />
The transformation of our national attitudes towards the<br />
people of Asia over the past thirty years is one of the most<br />
important developments in the two centuries of European<br />
settlement on this continent.<br />
No less important has been the transformation of our<br />
economic relationship_ with Asia. Indeed, this more than<br />
anything else provides the enduring fibre the substance<br />
for the change in attitude. We live on the edge of the most<br />
vibrant economic region in the world. No element of our<br />
international policy over the coming years will be more<br />
important than maintaining the momentum of Australia's<br />
economic enmeshment in the Asia-Pacific re ~ on. This<br />
audience will be well aware of the steps we have taken to<br />
get Australia and our neighbours working more closely<br />
together in the economic area, and you will understand that<br />
we will continue to make this a major priority.<br />
But there are other aspects of our relationship with Asia<br />
which need more work and fresh thinking if we are to adapt<br />
our attitudes, expectations and policies to the reality of<br />
our geographical relationship with Asia, and to the reality<br />
of Asia itself at the end of the twentieth century.<br />
Tonight I am going to talk about one of these aspects; our<br />
strategic relationship w! ith Asia. In doing so, I am building<br />
on my Government's established strategic and foreign<br />
policies, and particularly on the work of our Foreign<br />
Minister, Senator Evans, which he set out in his statement<br />
on regional security in December 1989. I regard that<br />
statement as a major step in the development of an<br />
intellectual framework for the formulation and<br />
implementation of policies which will enhance Australia's<br />
securitv in its region.<br />
In particular, while I will be speaking this evening mainly<br />
about the strategic and military aspects of security, my<br />
comments should be seen in the context of Senator Evans'<br />
discussion in his 1989 statement of the mZDlti-dimensCinil<br />
nature of security policy. He demonstrated in detail how<br />
maintaining Australia's security requires active policy<br />
beyond the military and strategic areas. These include<br />
diplomacy, economic co-operation, development and disaster<br />
assistance, and exchanges of people and ideas.<br />
Tonight, I will focus on the strategic dimension of our<br />
re gional security policy because in that area we have in<br />
recen-t years, and even in recent months, seen changes in<br />
global and regional affairs which require us to reassess our<br />
strategic relationship with Asia.<br />
76 16e </p>
<p>3.<br />
The last five years have seen the most profound changes in<br />
global strategic circumstances in nearly half a century:<br />
the end of the Cold War, and particularly over the past<br />
year the invigoralifon of the United Nations to the point<br />
where we can hope it: will become the instrument of global<br />
order envisaged by its founders.<br />
The Soviet Union has abandoned its attempt to compete with<br />
the United States far global influence. Its energies are<br />
now, and are likely to remain, absorbed instead in an<br />
attempt to contain aind repair the damage inflicted on its<br />
own political and economic structures by the strain of that<br />
unequal competition, and by the system of government which<br />
drove it. There is room for doubt that they will succeed.<br />
Whether they do or riot, we can be confident that the days<br />
are now passing in which the strategic affairs of our region<br />
were so fundamentally influenced by the global competition<br />
between the Soviet Union and the United States.<br />
The rise of the UN Is an important consequence of this<br />
historic change in world power. It was not an inevitable<br />
consequence. The success of the UN process in confronting<br />
the invasion and occupation of Kuwait last year has<br />
far-reaching consequences for the development of the new<br />
international system..<br />
And Asia itself has emerged as the most economically dynamic<br />
region in the world.<br />
My question tonight, then, is simply this what do these<br />
changes mean for our strategic relations with Asia, and for<br />
our strategic role in Asia? My answer is that they mean, at<br />
the very least, profound changes in our attitudes and<br />
expectations. Australians have traditionally feared Asia. The security<br />
they have sought has been security from Asia. But the time<br />
for that way of thinking has passed. Instead of seeking<br />
security from Asia, we should seek security in and with<br />
Asia. We should seek enhanced security through enmeshment<br />
in an Asian security system, as we have sought enhanced<br />
prosperity through enmeshment in Asia's economic system. We<br />
must think of ourselves as part of an Asian security system<br />
which is beginning, -very slowly, to evolve to meet Asia's<br />
new strategic circums3tances.<br />
I should explain that when I use the term " Asian security<br />
sytm I do not mean an organisation, or even an ordered<br />
group of organising principles. I mean rather a set of<br />
arrangements and relationships which together maintain<br />
regional security. Some of these arrangements will be<br />
formal, others informoal. Some will be bilateral, others<br />
trilateral or multilateral. Some of the relationships will<br />
have no explicit manvfestation; they might be tacit in<br />
nature but nonetheless effective. Some of these<br />
arrangements and understandings will overlap, providing 76G17 </p>
<p>separate layers of security. Collectively, in their<br />
workings and effect they justify the term " system*.<br />
I want now to look at the shape of the emerging Asian<br />
security system, looking first at the problem the system<br />
must address, then at the elements of the system, and<br />
thirdly at the role Australia can play in it.<br />
The geographical limits to the problem can be easily<br />
defined; Australia's area of primary strategic interest<br />
covers Indo-China, South East Asia and the South West<br />
Pacific. Our direct strategic interests can be strongly<br />
affected by developments within that area; clearly our<br />
broader security policy which goes beyond defence policy<br />
as such must encompass the regions and nations which stand<br />
on the periphery of this area of primary strategic interest;<br />
China, India, the Korean Peninsula, Japan, the US and the<br />
Soviet Union.<br />
The key issue in the security of the Asian region over the<br />
coming years will be the emergence of a number of<br />
increasingly powerful regional states.<br />
Many of those states are, in their present form, quite<br />
recent. In 1945, as Malcolm Fraser once pointed out, there<br />
were only four sovereign states within five thousand miles<br />
of Australia including New Zealand. By 1969 there were<br />
seven times that number.<br />
In the first 25 years after the Pacific war, the colonial<br />
structure of Asia disintegrated, creating a complex region<br />
of independent sovereign states. In the last 25 years,<br />
these nations have developed politically, economically and<br />
technically many of them at an astonishing rate. Whereas<br />
years ago Australia looked out on a region of politically<br />
unstable, economically under-developed, and technically<br />
unsophisticated nations, we now see a region characterised<br />
by increasingly stable, prosperous and technologically<br />
advanced neighbours.<br />
It is essential to understand that this progress in our<br />
region has overwhelmingly been to Australia's benefit, not<br />
only economically but strategically as well.<br />
Let me take a specific example close to home. In th~ e early<br />
1960s, a politically turbulent and economically stagnant<br />
Indonesia posed a serious threat to the stability of our<br />
rFegfin,-and to our own security. Australia felt it needed to<br />
respond to that threat by substantially increasing its<br />
defence capabilities. Since the establishment of the New<br />
Order in Indonesia under President Suharto, we have seen and<br />
greatly welcomed the passing of the threat posed by the<br />
Indonesia of the early 1960s, and the development of a<br />
stable, unified and rapidly developing neighbour able indeed<br />
to make a major contribution to the security of our region. </p>
<p>The territorial integrity, political stability and economic<br />
prosperity of Indonesia is a very important contribution to<br />
Australia's, and the regicn's, security.<br />
I might add that I was interested and pleased to see<br />
these thoughts being reflected from the other side of the<br />
Timor Sea, in an interview given recently by Indonesia's<br />
newly designated Ambassador to Australia, Mr Sabam Siagian.<br />
What is true of Indonesia is, on the whole, true also of the<br />
region. Australia's security has been strengthened as many<br />
of our neighbours have grown more stable and more<br />
prosperous. Notwithstanding this fact, there is no doubt that the<br />
strategic potential of the nations in our region has grown,<br />
and will continue to grow, as a result of the developments I<br />
have been describing.<br />
AS they become richer:, they can devote more resources<br />
to defence capabilities.<br />
As they have become more stable, they are able to<br />
reduce the resources they have devoted to domestic<br />
order and security.<br />
As they have become more advanced technologically, they<br />
are increasingly able to develop and operate<br />
sophisticated weapons.<br />
These developments are now well established in Asia.<br />
The role of a regional security system for Asia is to make<br />
sure that the growing strategic potential of the nations of<br />
the region does not disturb the peace between them. Such a<br />
system would have three main elements: the nations of the<br />
region themselves, the United States, and the United<br />
Nations. You will notice that each of those elements<br />
reflects one of the three fundamental changes which I<br />
described earlier.<br />
Let me take the United Nations f irst. It has been much in<br />
our thoughts in recent months. The end of the Cold War has<br />
borne double fruit. Not only has the threat of global<br />
nuclear war been lifted, but the ideal of international<br />
co-operation to keep the peace, which has lain dormant<br />
through the long decades of the Cold War, has now,<br />
unexpectedly, sprung to productive life.<br />
From the day Kuwait was invaded on the second of August last<br />
year, Australia viewed the Gulf crisis as a vital test of<br />
the way in which the international community would work<br />
together in the post-Coldl War era. It challenged us to<br />
determine whether the international community had the<br />
capacity and the will collectively to resist aggression; and<br />
whether the United Nations' potential as the vehicle for<br />
such cooperative effort could be realised. </p>
<p>In the event, thanks to Saddam Hussein, the test proved to<br />
be a harsh one, both for the UN and for its members. The<br />
United Nations was required to sanction the use of armed<br />
force against a member state for the first time in its<br />
history. Member states, including Australia, had to take<br />
the terrible decision to commit their forces and their<br />
people to military operations in which many on both sides<br />
might be killed.<br />
But the test was passed, the price mercifully smaller than<br />
we feared was paid, and as a result the international<br />
community has sent a clear message to would-be aggressors<br />
everywhere that the principles of the UN will be respected,<br />
or they will be enforced. That has made the world a safer<br />
place for everyone.<br />
We in Australia always understood that the issues being<br />
fought out in Kuwait were just as important for our region<br />
as they were for the people of the Middle East. On the 21st<br />
of August I said:<br />
iIraejs invasion of Kuwait is a tragically clear proof<br />
of the new dangers which exist, just as those of the<br />
Cold War thankfully fade into history. And those<br />
dangers are not unique to the Middle East. Wherever we<br />
find big armies, national rivalries and reckless<br />
leaders, we will find a risk of major war. It is not<br />
inconceivable that those conditions could emerge in<br />
Asia in the coming years.'<br />
Of course we cannot simply assume that the UN will manage<br />
any future crisis as well as it handled Iraq's invasion of<br />
Kuwait. In every case the UN's effectiveness will depend on<br />
the support it is given. Nevertheless, the evolution of the<br />
UN as an effective instrument to counter aggression will<br />
make a major contribution to the security of the Asian<br />
region, and an essential backdrop to and in the extreme an<br />
element of any regional security system or framework.<br />
At the more immediate level, the UN already has a major role<br />
in addressing regional problems such as Cambodia. As the<br />
Cambodian example shows, effective engagement of the UN in<br />
regional issues may need to be fostered by innovative<br />
activity by regional countries themselves. The initiative<br />
of Gareth Evans in developing and articulating the UN's role<br />
in a Cambodian settlement has been critical in bringing the<br />
Cambodian problem to the point where, with a little<br />
commitment by all parties, the UN can broker an historic<br />
breakthrough. We will look to the UN to do more in the region in the<br />
future. For example, we believe that consideration should<br />
be given to seeking UN support for efforts to contain<br />
nuclear proliferation in the region.<br />
The second major element in the regional security system is<br />
the United States.<br />
76; 20 </p>
<p>Australia's view, and a view that I believe is widely shared<br />
within the region, is that a key to maintaining a stable<br />
security system in Asia, and providing the foundation of<br />
security as the region evolves, is the continued strategic<br />
engagement of the United States in the western Pacific.<br />
US engagement in the region is, and will remain, important<br />
to Australia's strategic and security interests, and<br />
important to the security interests of the region as a<br />
whole. To understand that, consider for a moment its<br />
opposite the United States walking away, or even worse<br />
being forced away from a profound involvement in the<br />
region. We would feel, and we would be, much less secure,<br />
as I will explain. A corner-stone of Australian strategic<br />
policy will therefore be to maintain and assist the US<br />
strategic presence in oui' region.<br />
The US has been strategically engaged in the Western Pacific<br />
for nearly a century now, and for nearly as long Australia<br />
has sought to maintain and expand that commitment.<br />
But over the past century, the nature and rationale of the<br />
US role in our region has changed often. Clearly the end of<br />
the Cold War is prompting another re-examination of that<br />
role, both in Washington and in the region. It is<br />
appropriate, and indeed important, that this should be so.<br />
Australia's interest in the continued strategic engagement<br />
of the US in our region is best served by a durable<br />
arrangement. That requires a clear understanding, in<br />
Washington and in the region, of what that engagement means,<br />
and of why it is maintained in contemporary strategic<br />
circumstances. I believe that on both sides of the Pacific there is a clear<br />
understanding of the importance of the US role, and a clear<br />
commitment to maintaining it. But the issue is too<br />
important to be taken for granted.<br />
In the US, the challenge is to explain why they should<br />
continue to spend large sums supporting its role in the<br />
Western Pacific now that the Cold War is over. There is no<br />
doubt that for the past 45 years the US has seen its<br />
commitment to the security of our region primarily as a<br />
contribution to its global containment of communism and of<br />
Soviet military power. Although the Soviets remain a<br />
significant Pacific military power, the likelihood that that<br />
power will be used aggres: 3ively is no greater in Asia than<br />
it is in Europe. That may seem to provide an argument for<br />
the US to pull out, and we should expect that some US voters<br />
and their representatives in the Congress will put that<br />
argument pretty vigorously. We must accept that for most<br />
Americans, Asia will probably loom less large than Europe<br />
and the Middle East. The American administration knows<br />
better; American business knows better; but not all<br />
Americans know better. The Pacific is a much wider stretch<br />
of water than the Atlantic. 7621 </p>
<p>And we must recognise that the Pacific seems all the wider<br />
to Americans who feel that their nation's prosperity is<br />
being undermined by the relentless and, to some eyes, unfair<br />
competition of Japan and other Asian economies.<br />
Against those arguments, others can be advanced to support<br />
the maintenance of the US effort in the Western Pacific,<br />
Chief among these is that the US cannot afford to risk the<br />
possibility that the fastest growing and soon probably the<br />
most productive region of the world in which the US has<br />
huge economic interests might slide into armed chaos -the<br />
way Europe did twice this century. There are no signs yet<br />
of an emerging expansionist power in our region, but should<br />
one emerge, the US military presence would be a powerful<br />
countervailing force well disposed towards the interests of<br />
the peaceful nations of the region. Even without<br />
elaborating such dramatic scenarios, the reassurance<br />
currently provided by the United States encourages regional<br />
powers to refrain from acquiring military force capabilities<br />
of a size that would prove destabilising and set off a<br />
regional arms race.<br />
Those who hope to see the US presence sustained can also<br />
place some faith in the persistence in America of the<br />
internationalist spirit which has simply accepted, for<br />
years, the responsibilities which great power brings to<br />
great nations. The US achievement in assembling a mighty<br />
coalition during the Gulf War should give us all renewed<br />
confidence in its capacity to take a leading role in<br />
resisting aggression.<br />
Lastly, I know America understands that we do not ask them<br />
to undertake our defence for us. As far as Australia is<br />
concerned, our policy of self-reliance explicitly commIts us<br />
to take responsibility for the defence of our own territory.<br />
And I believe that many other nations in the region would<br />
take a similar view. I an struck, for example, by the<br />
parallels between Australia's self-reliant defence posture<br />
and Indonesia's doctrine of national resilience.<br />
We are confident, therefore, that it accords both with the<br />
interests and with the disposition of the United States to<br />
continue to play a major strategic role in this region a<br />
role it has played in various forms for a century.<br />
Certainly the administration of President Bush himself a<br />
man with long-standing interests in our region has made it<br />
clear that it intends the US to stay in the Western Pacific<br />
for a long time to come. The administration ha-s been<br />
careful to plan necessary reductions in US military<br />
deployments so that they have the minimum effect on<br />
America's ability to play a broader role. They have been<br />
vigorous in arguing, both in the region and in Washington,<br />
that such a role should be maintained. And they have begun<br />
the important and complex task of defining just what the US<br />
role should be in the years and decades ahead, and how it<br />
should be achieved.<br />
76i; 22 </p>
<p>The most vivid expression of US thinking about the nature of<br />
its future role has come from the Secretary of Defense, Dick<br />
Cheney. He has spoken of the US acting as a ' balancing<br />
wheel' in the region. I think that is entirely apt. In a<br />
region of rapidly growing nations, the surest guarantee that<br />
power will not be misused 1: 3 the confidence that a larger<br />
power is interested in the peace of the region.<br />
Of course this is not an entirely new role in the region for<br />
the United States. Even du: ring the Cold War, our neighbours<br />
recognised and welcomed the constraints that the US presence<br />
provided on the ambitions of regional powers. Certainly<br />
Australia has always seen this role as fundamental to our<br />
interest in maintaining that presence. The difference is<br />
that what was once a secondary purpose for the US, though a<br />
primary purpose for Australia and others, has now moved to<br />
become the primary purpose f~ or the US as well.<br />
As for the way in which its role could be fulfilled, the US<br />
is inclined to continue to work through the network of its<br />
existing defence links in the region. Again, that seems<br />
entirely sensible. Those liLnks, including the long-standing<br />
alliance between the US and Australia, already provide the<br />
US with the political and st~ rategic infrastructure required<br />
to support its security commitment to our region.<br />
But it is clear that for tho US the task of defining and<br />
implementing its new role ini the region is not yet complete.<br />
We will continue to watch that process with great interest,<br />
and to help where we can.<br />
One area in which planning necessarily incomplete is in<br />
the support the US can expect from nations in the region.<br />
In the Philippines, to take the most extreme example, US<br />
access to bases remains uncertain. We strongly believe that<br />
it is in interests both of t~ he Philippines and of the region<br />
for the US to retain such access, and we hope that will be<br />
recognised by the Philippines leadership when making their<br />
decisions about this important issue.<br />
Elsewhere US allies and others recognise the important role<br />
that the US must play in the security of our region, and<br />
enthusiasm for the US presence is growing. Singapore for<br />
instance has offered support: to US ships and aircraft.<br />
But it remains the case thait the US will not be able finally<br />
to determine the role they will play in the region until the<br />
region itself has worked out: its own ideas. Clearly the<br />
evolution of the US role in the region will need to reflect<br />
the development of the region's own ideas about regional<br />
security.<br />
This needs to be a process of interaction, with the US and<br />
others in the region working out their ideas in close<br />
consultation, and in full knowledge of one another's<br />
thinking. This should not be too difficult, because the<br />
region and the US already have deeply interlinked histories<br />
and interests. But clearly this process requires the region 7623 </p>
<p>itself to develop its own ideas. This is something it is<br />
only just beginning to do.<br />
Our region does not have well-developed habits of joint<br />
action or even of dialogue on security issues. Nonetheless<br />
there is a growing recognition that the great changes of<br />
recent years require the nations of the region to develop<br />
the habit of consultation and dialogue. This is beginning<br />
to happen, and we welcome it. The principle medium for such<br />
discussion will of course be the network of consultations on<br />
strategic issues between individual nations in the region.<br />
But there is also scope to develop multilateral security<br />
dialogue. This can best be done by building on existing<br />
multilateral regional forums. ASEAN meetings, including the<br />
post-ministerial conferences, have recently begun to provide<br />
excellent opportunities for such discussions.<br />
We do not think it is appropriate or necessary at this sta3ge<br />
to propose the establishment of new regional forums or<br />
institutions for discussing security issues. It is not yet<br />
possible to say whether such forums or institutions would<br />
have a useful role. In particular we must recognise that we<br />
cannot translate the emerging European security architecture<br />
into our own region. The mosaic of cultures, cleavages and<br />
conflicts in Asia is much too complex for that.<br />
Rather there is reason to hope that a regional consensus<br />
about the shape of a regional security system will gradual. ly<br />
emerge through an increasing pattern of bilateral and<br />
multilateral informal discussions.<br />
We would see this gradual, informal approach as more<br />
promising than more formal proposals such as the one made<br />
recently for a meeting of the region's five ' great powers'.<br />
This informal approach is already yielding results. For<br />
example, I believe that a regional consensus is already<br />
beginning to emerge about one of the key issues in the<br />
development of a regional security order the role of<br />
Both inside Japan and within the region as a whole, it has<br />
become clear that the -changed strategic circumstances<br />
require a re-examination of the role Japan might take in<br />
regional affairs, including regional security affairs. The<br />
Gulf War in particular highlighted the anachronism of Japan,<br />
years after the Pacific War began, being so tightly<br />
constrained in the role it plays in international security<br />
affairs. Australia has said that it would be in the<br />
region's interest for Japan to be encouraged to play a<br />
larger role, though we have also stressed that the form of<br />
the contribution is for Japan itself to decide. The<br />
Goverment, and Australians generally, would be comfortable<br />
with a Japanese choice to become involved in United Nations<br />
peace-keeping operations around the globe. I believe we<br />
could also view with equanimity the prospect that in due<br />
course Japan might make an appropriate contribution to other<br />
collective security arrangements.<br />
76 2 </p>
<p>I believe that this positive view of Japan's potential to<br />
contribute to regional and indeed global security is<br />
becoming more widely sheired in the region, partly thanks to<br />
the careful and effectivre consultation undertaken by Japan's<br />
Prime Minister, Mr Kaifu, during his recent visit to South<br />
East Asia.<br />
One issue which has not yet been resolved is the role which<br />
the Soviet Union will play in our region in the coming<br />
years. Australia recognises that the Soviet Union is a<br />
Pacific power, and we have welcomed the prospect of<br />
constructive Soviet participation in the economic affairs of<br />
the region. We do not rule out that the time will come when<br />
the Soviets might be able to play a constructive role in the<br />
development of an overall security system for Asia of the<br />
sort I have described, in the way they are now doing in the<br />
Middle East and Europe.<br />
Trhey are already playing a constructive role in relation to<br />
specific issues like North Korea and Cambodia, and that is<br />
welcome, as is some participation in the increasing pattern<br />
of bilateral and informal multilateral dialogue in the<br />
region to which I have referred.<br />
But, in a number of areas, there remain unresolved problems,<br />
such as Japan's northern territories, and continued Soviet<br />
attempts to question the legitimacy of the US strategic<br />
posture in our region. it will be difficult for the Soviet<br />
Union's role in regionail security to develop while these<br />
issues remain unresolved, and while the future of the Soviet<br />
Union itself remains so unpredictable.<br />
In another area, Australia has been very interested in<br />
Indonesia's efforts to initiate a process which, in Foreign<br />
Minister Alatas's words, could turn the SpratlyIsland* s in<br />
the South China Sea from an area of confrontation into an<br />
area of co-operation. Without such action, the Spratlys<br />
issue has the potential to become a major regional dispute.<br />
Indonesia has initiated a series of workshops and seminars<br />
in which officials and academics from regional claimant and<br />
non-claimant states have been able to discuss practical<br />
co-operation in resource and environmental matters and in<br />
search-and-rescue operations. Multilateral arrangements in<br />
these areas may follow.<br />
Another concrete step that could emerge from enhanced<br />
regional dialogue could be confidence-building measures such<br />
as procedures agreed among regional states for handling<br />
naval incidents at sea. Increased co-operation in such<br />
areas as maritime surveillance, air-space surveillance and<br />
intelligence exchanges could also grow out of regional<br />
dialogue on mutual security needs. But Australia would not<br />
support proposals for naval arms-control or other measures<br />
which might inhibit the freedom of naval operations in<br />
international waters. ' 76; 25~ </p>
<p>In general, we believe that the process of developing<br />
regional security arrangements should not occur in ways<br />
which might undermine our existing security arrangements.<br />
Those arrangements have served the region well, and will<br />
continue to be important in the post-Cold War era.<br />
This brings us, finally, to Australia's role in the<br />
development of an Asian security system in the post-Cold War<br />
era. Our security links with our Asian neighbours have a long<br />
history, and are reflected in a network of strong bilateral<br />
relations and in some important formal arrangements. But<br />
our most important alliance is with the United States.<br />
Traditionally Australians have seen our alliance with the US<br />
as a shield against an Asian threat what we might call the<br />
' Coral Sea' concept of the alliance. Obviously the<br />
experience of the Pacific War will remain an important part<br />
of the historical legacy of the two nations, and a bond<br />
between us. And I say bluntly that in the crunch we would<br />
want the world's most powerful democracy as an ally.<br />
But we in Australia must now think of our alliance with the<br />
US in the context of our contribution to broader regional<br />
security, rather than in relation to Australia's security<br />
alone. We no longer seek, through our alliances, to build<br />
up walls of defence against the region, but to build bridges<br />
of co-operation with the region. Our neighbours have long<br />
recognised that our alliance with the US contributes to<br />
regional security, and it is clear that the US is<br />
increasingly viewing our alliance, and others it has with<br />
regional nations, in the same way. We hope to reinforce<br />
that perception, not just in the region but among<br />
Australians as well.<br />
Australia has important defence associations with Malaysia<br />
and Singapore through the Five Power Defence Arrangment<br />
We see this as an increasingly important security<br />
arrangement, and we are pleased that our regional partners<br />
in FPDA, as well as the UK and New Zealand, share our belief<br />
that the arrangements provide a valuable basis to maintain<br />
and develop our contribution to regional security.<br />
Australia's substantial contribution to FPDA reflects the<br />
obligations which Australia must accept in the light of our,<br />
relative economic status in the region. Few Australians<br />
recognise that, notwithstanding the phenomenal growth in<br />
ASEAN's economies in recent years, Australia's economy is<br />
larger than the whole of ASEAN's put together, and is indeed<br />
the third-largest in the Asian region, behind only Japan arid<br />
China. The size of our economy, and our technical expertise, means<br />
that Australia will continue to maintain significant<br />
military capabilities, especially maritime capabilities,<br />
which will allow us to make a valuable contribution to the<br />
military dimension of regional security.<br />
( 7326 </p>
<p>Apart from our participation in the FPDA, that contribution<br />
will be reflected in the many bilateral defence<br />
relationships we have developed with nations in our region,<br />
including PNG, New Zealand, Indonesia, Thailand and Brunei.<br />
An important element of those relationships is the<br />
encouragement and assistance we give to our regional<br />
neighbours to develop their own defence capabilities,<br />
including their maritime capabilities, in ways which will<br />
help to enhance regional security.<br />
We are also prepared to contribute significant forces to<br />
help implement a UN-sponsored settlement of the Cambodian<br />
problem. Next week the Defence Ministcer, Senator Ray, will announce<br />
the most important reforms of the defence forces for at<br />
least 20 years. This series of reforms has one goal to<br />
make our defence force as efficient and cost-effective as<br />
possible, so that it can develop more and better<br />
capabilities with the money available.<br />
The result will be a defence force which is better managed,<br />
better structured, and better equipped to defend Australia,<br />
and to play a part in the security of our region.<br />
But as the example of Cambodia shows, our contribution to<br />
regional security must be much wider than purely military<br />
matters. The vigorous diplomatic role we have played, in<br />
close co-operation with our friends in ASEAN, and<br />
particularly Indonesia, in the search for a settlement<br />
reflects not only our concern for the vital humanitarian<br />
issues at stake in Cambodial, but also our recognition that<br />
the resolution of the Cambodian problem is important to the<br />
strategic stability and security of the region as a whole.<br />
Australia will also make a major contribution to disarmament<br />
and arms-control measures to0 enhance regional security. The<br />
most disruptive possible development for regional security<br />
would be the acquisition by a regional state of nonconventional<br />
weapons capability chemical, biological or<br />
nuclear weaponry. The Gulf War highlighted the threat posed<br />
by Iraq's possession of chemical and biological weapons<br />
even if Iraq was ultimately dissuaded from using them.<br />
Australia will continue to work with its regional partners<br />
to outlaw these weapons from the region and from the world<br />
as a whole. My chemical-weapons regional initiative has<br />
been a step in this direction.<br />
The Soviet Union and China, which have their status as<br />
Nuclear Weapon States acknowledged under the Nuclear Non-<br />
Proliferation Treaty, must remain the only such states in<br />
the region. Like other nations, we are seriously concerned<br />
by reports that North Korea may be moving to acquire a<br />
nuclear-weapons capability.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen 71; 2 </p>
<p>The development of a regional security system will be slow<br />
and complex. But I think the outlines of Australia's<br />
approach are already clear. We can lay four corner stones:<br />
support for the United Nations as the supreme<br />
international guarantor of peace and security<br />
support for the continued engagement of the United<br />
States in the security affairs of the Western Pacific<br />
support for the development of regional co-operation<br />
and dialogue on security issues<br />
and last, continuing to develop Australia's defence<br />
force as our final guarantor of Australia's security,<br />
and as a contribution to the security of the region as<br />
a whole.<br />
Building on these foundations, we can come to find our<br />
security in and with Asia, not against Asia. When we have<br />
done that we will have taken another further vital step<br />
towards resolving that great challenge of our national life<br />
with which I started our relationship with Asia.<br />
