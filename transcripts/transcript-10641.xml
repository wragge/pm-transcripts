    <content><![CDATA[<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, good morning.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Hello, Neil. It's good to be here.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Thank you for coming in.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Will this model go to a referendum?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I expect so, but we have to wait and see what happens today. But</p>
<p>   I'm quite optimistic that out of today the Convention's</p>
<p>   job will be done and that we will be able to put something to the</p>
<p>   Australian people at a referendum.</p>
<p>I want a referendum. We made a promise that there'd be a referendum.</p>
<p>   The Australian people are owed the opportunity of expressing a view</p>
<p>   on this issue. There's not much doubt to me that amongst the</p>
<p>   republican models, the one that has most support at the Convention</p>
<p>   is the two-thirds one. It's been changed a bit and it's</p>
<p>   been altered to accommodate a miscellany of views.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Will it be supported by the Australian public? Do you think it</p>
<p>   will become...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I don't know. I think it's too early to say that. Neil,</p>
<p>   there are a lot of views on this in the community. I know that some</p>
<p>   commentators, not yourself, but some others are sort of almost expressing</p>
<p>   a frustration at the fact that there's such a variety of views</p>
<p>   at the Convention. That mirrors the community. There's a feeling</p>
<p>   in the community that the time for change is coming and that it</p>
<p>   ought to be, at the very least, considered. There's still,</p>
<p>   though, quite a segment of the community, for a combination of reasons,</p>
<p>   that doesn't want change. There are some who don't want</p>
<p>   change because they're nostalgic about the past. There are</p>
<p>   others, and I guess I put myself in this category, who think the</p>
<p>   system we've got is so good. I mean, I don't have any</p>
<p>   nostalgia about the past, but I do think the system we have at the</p>
<p>   moment is so damn good that you have to think very hard before you</p>
<p>   change it.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Well, if it does go to a referendum, as you expect, will you campaign</p>
<p>   against it?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, the Government's position at a referendum is that there</p>
<p>   won't be a government yes or no position. Everybody will be</p>
<p>   allowed a free or an open vote. Now, the extent to which individuals</p>
<p>   in the Government, myself included, involve themselves in the campaign</p>
<p>   is something that I will not be deciding until next year. </p>
<p>Can I say, Neil, that once this convention is over it's back</p>
<p>   to things of immediate concern to the Australian people. I mean,</p>
<p>   this is an issue which interests the Australian people. This convention</p>
<p>   has generated a great deal of public interest. But it's not</p>
<p>   as important as taxation reform. It's not as important as job</p>
<p>   generation. It's not as important as further reforms that will</p>
<p>   further protect us against the Asian economic meltdown. So it is</p>
<p>   back to business. Back to the things that immediately count and</p>
<p>   affect the quality of lives of men and women in Australia after</p>
<p>   today.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Some of the monarchists are saying this will not get through the</p>
<p>   people. They see it as a victory, what's happened here. And</p>
<p>   they say: well, John Howard set up this convention for exactly this</p>
<p>   sort of result to maintain the status quo. What's your answer</p>
<p>   to that?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I didn't. If any monarchists or, indeed, anybody else</p>
<p>   is saying that I have deliberately set up this convention to stop</p>
<p>   change occurring, that is absolute nonsense. I made a promise before</p>
<p>   the election that I would have a convention. And I also made a promise,</p>
<p>   which some people have forgotten but I repeat it, that the Australian</p>
<p>   people would have a vote on this issue before the year 2000 and</p>
<p>   I intend to keep that promise.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>A lot's been made of your comment that you wanted a clear</p>
<p>   consensus, a clear view, a clear majority. What do you mean by that?</p>
<p>   What do they have do...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I'm not going to define it in numerical terms. We're</p>
<p>   close to the final vote and I'll obviously be saying something</p>
<p>   this afternoon.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>How will you be voting?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I will vote as I said I would vote at the beginning of the Convention.</p>
<p>   I said that I opposed a republic for the reason that I didn't</p>
<p>   think any alternative system was better. That remains my view. It</p>
<p>   may not be a fashionable view. It may not be a popular view. But</p>
<p>   it has consistently been my view. And I think the Australian people,</p>
<p>   first and foremost, are entitled to demand of me that I be honest</p>
<p>   with them. I said, of the alternatives to the present system that</p>
<p>   the McGarvie one was better than the other two. I thought the two-thirds</p>
<p>   in turn was better than the direct election. But I thought the two-thirds</p>
<p>   was vastly inferior to McGarvie.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>What do you think of this model that has come through? It's</p>
<p>   been described as a camel, do you think it is?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>It's marginally better, in my view, than the original two-thirds</p>
<p>   proposal because it removes the requirement that a president can</p>
<p>   only be removed with a two-thirds vote of the Parliament.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>You've got a sense, obviously, a sense of public opinion and</p>
<p>   you see the polls. Do you think the people of Australia want a republic?</p>
<p>   Do you think you're out of step with them?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I might be in a minority on this, yes. But must a Prime Minister</p>
<p>   and a leader always just put his finger up in the air and say: well,</p>
<p>   I'll do exactly what the polls tell me?</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>No, of course not.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No. I mean, all I can do is say what my honest view is. My honest</p>
<p>   view is that the system we have works extremely well and I don't</p>
<p>   think that an alternative one would be as good. I think the links</p>
<p>   between Australia and the British Crown are emotionally a lot weaker</p>
<p>   now than they used to be. I don't think it is a question of</p>
<p>   choosing between the Queen and some new system. It's a question</p>
<p>   of choosing between a current system, which effectively has the</p>
<p>   Governor-General as the Head of State of Australia and a new system.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Is there still a possibility of a plebiscite or do you think it</p>
<p>   will be a referendum on the...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I would strongly suspect there'll be a referendum. But I obviously</p>
<p>   have to wait and see what the Convention does today. But I don't</p>
<p>   want a plebiscite, to be perfectly frank. I think that would be</p>
<p>   an unwanted, additional injection into the whole process.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Has the Queen been kept informed officially, through the Australian</p>
<p>   Government, about what's happening?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, the Governor-General, presumably, would have communicated</p>
<p>   from time-to-time to her. The channel of communication is the Governor-General.</p>
<p>   But I can assure you, from what I've been told, she is following</p>
<p>   the thing very closely and but taking the view that it's our</p>
<p>   business. It's no secret that she indicated that to me. She</p>
<p>   indicated it to Paul Keating. She is a 20th Century democrat and</p>
<p>   understands that the role of the Crown in Australia rests entirely</p>
<p>   in the hands of the Australian people. It has for almost 100 years.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>I understand there a number of meetings at the Old Parliament House</p>
<p>   today by people discussing the events and you are part of those.</p>
<p>   Are you willing...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Today?</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Yes, this morning.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No. I've come straight from - I had breakfast at the Lodge</p>
<p>   and I've just had a half hour meeting with Gatjil Djekurra,</p>
<p>   the Chairman of ATSIC, and we've talked about indigenous affairs.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>So nobody's been in your ear overnight?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I have not had meetings with anybody. I mean it is amazing what</p>
<p>   you are attributed with at these sort of gatherings. I have got</p>
<p>   to say it has been a great experience.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Well I wanted to ask about that. Has it been constructive, is Australia</p>
<p>   a better place for it?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>It is the spirit, the mood is fantastic. And it is unique in my</p>
<p>   experience in public life. There has never been anything like this</p>
<p>   before in my experience and I don't think the experience of</p>
<p>   anybody at the convention. To sit down at something like that and</p>
<p>   to have every age cohort in Australia represented.</p>
<p>To have representatives of the indigenous people, to have a whole</p>
<p>   variety of names, they are not all just English, Irish and Scottish</p>
<p>   names. To have people who are, what I would say extreme directly</p>
<p>   elect the president republicans right through to very conservative</p>
<p>   republicans. To have Liberals who are republicans and to have Liberals</p>
<p>   who are not republicans and Liberals who are sort of in between.</p>
<p>   To have the contribution of church leaders like Archbishop Pell</p>
<p>   and Archbishop Hollingworth and to have media personalities and</p>
<p>   sporting personalities, the whole bit. I think it has been a terrific</p>
<p>   gathering. And people have approached it in a very constructive</p>
<p>   way. There has been very little real acid. I mean there has been</p>
<p>   some flamboyant outbursts, some chiacking, but I haven't noted</p>
<p>   any real underlying bitterness.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Did it say something about this form of community consultation</p>
<p>   on other issues?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>It might, it might say that. It could easily say that, now, who</p>
<p>   knows. I have been very encouraged by it. I had morning tea on Wednesday</p>
<p>   with all of the delegates who were under 25 and we spent about an</p>
<p>   hour together in the old Cabinet room, and they, of course, have</p>
<p>   found it a tremendous experience. And people who sneered at the</p>
<p>   idea of having appointed delegates, can I point out, unless we had</p>
<p>   had some appointed delegates you would never have had too many people</p>
<p>   under 25 elected.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Ok, so Australia is a better place for what happened in the past</p>
<p>   two weeks.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I am greatly encouraged from this that whenever there is a vote</p>
<p>   on this I think it will be conducted in a non-acrimonious fashion.</p>
<p>   I don't believe the debate on this issue would cause any deep</p>
<p>   fractures in Australian society. I think if out of the referendum</p>
<p>   there is a clear majority of people in favour of change those who</p>
<p>   oppose change will accept that with great goodwill. Equally, if</p>
<p>   there is an opposition to change then I think the people who want</p>
<p>   change will say, well we have failed on this occasion. They will</p>
<p>   come back and it is quite possible that you could have one or two</p>
<p>   referenda on this, I don't know.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>So what is your timetable? You would have a referendum next year?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Before the end of next year. And the idea being, if a majority</p>
<p>   of people vote for it then it can come into operation on the 1st</p>
<p>   January 2001. Equally, if people don't accept it then it is</p>
<p>   off the agenda, not for ever, because I don't think it will</p>
<p>   be, but it will be off the agenda for the celebration of the Centenary</p>
<p>   of Federation. In other words we can celebrate that without an ongoing</p>
<p>   debate about the issue.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Would it be off the agenda for your time as Prime Minister?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I don't know, I don't know how long that is, that is</p>
<p>   up to the Australian people, isn't it?</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Well how long do you want to stay around?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I am feeling very fit and healthy at the moment, very fit</p>
<p>   and healthy.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Mr Howard if I could change the topic. Iraq, Moscow today has directly</p>
<p>   warned the United States that this could escalate into a significant</p>
<p>   international conflict, could it?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No I don't think that is likely. I think that is the sort</p>
<p>   of thing that from time to time you would expect the Russians to</p>
<p>   say. I hope we can still settle it peacefully. I am a little bit</p>
<p>   encouraged, although what they offered was not acceptable, I am</p>
<p>   a little bit encouraged that the Iraqis are offering something.</p>
<p>   That is at least a signal that they are focusing their minds on</p>
<p>   the fact that denying inspections of these presidential and other</p>
<p>   sites is just not a goer any more. I am still very hopeful, without</p>
<p>   being overly optimistic, that we can avoid any resort to military</p>
<p>   action.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Is this about economics or about morality? Is it about oil or is</p>
<p>   it about dangerous weapons?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I am sure it is not about oil. It is not about oil.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>It is about morality?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>It is about security, which is tied up with morality. But it is</p>
<p>   about security. You are dealing here with very, very dangerous weapons</p>
<p>   and if one person can get away with manufacturing and storing them</p>
<p>   and retaining the capacity to indiscriminately deliver them. You</p>
<p>   are talking here about material that can kill millions of people</p>
<p>   with a very small quantity. I mean, it is in some respects it is</p>
<p>   quite elementary material but it is very lethal.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Do you believe that Australia is at risk because of our involvement,</p>
<p>   that there could be action on the Australian people?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>There are no missiles in Iraq aimed directly at Australia, but</p>
<p>   just as there were no guns in Germany in 1939 aimed directly at</p>
<p>   Australia or indeed at the United States. But we have long-term</p>
<p>   and fundamental interest in there being a secure Middle East and</p>
<p>   a secure world and if Saddam is able to get away with this others</p>
<p>   will say, we can do the same and those others may, in the fullness</p>
<p>   of time, turn out to be closer to Australia.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>I think that there has been open speculation that it could make</p>
<p>   us a target for terrorism. I did hear Mr McLachlan talking about</p>
<p>   the possibility of chemical weapons or biological weapons being</p>
<p>   dropped in water supplies and things like that, is that a serious</p>
<p>   option, serious danger to Australia?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>We have certainly had no indication that that is likely to happen.</p>
<p>   I don't think it significantly increases our vulnerability</p>
<p>   to terrorist attacks, but in the nature of that sort of activity</p>
<p>   a terrorist attack is always unexpected. It is often disproportionate,</p>
<p>   or irrelevant to the relationship between those being terrorised</p>
<p>   and the terrorists, they are often very indiscriminate things.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Have you had any discussions with the New Zealand Prime Minister</p>
<p>   about this?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes I have.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Are you hoping they will come on board?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well that is a matter for her to decide. But she is coming to Australia</p>
<p>   next week and I guess we will talk about it again. But I would think</p>
<p>   some contribution from New Zealand is likely, but that is a matter</p>
<p>   for them.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Mr Howard you mentioned the economy earlier, the Asian melt-down.</p>
<p>   I was talking to the National Australia Bank earlier this week,</p>
<p>   they have already increased some of their fixed interest rates and</p>
<p>   they expect an interest rate increase, well they are predicting</p>
<p>   around one and a half per cent in the variable rate this year, is</p>
<p>   that a possibility?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I don't, as you know, speculate either direction about</p>
<p>   interest rates. Can I say in relation to the NAB, their forecast</p>
<p>   has tended to be a bit at the pessimistic end, compared with outfits</p>
<p>   like Access and others that have tended to be more bullish about</p>
<p>   the capacity of the Australian economy to withstand the Asian, change</p>
<p>   in the Asian melt-down. </p>
<p>The Australian economy is still very strong and the thing that</p>
<p>   really influences interest rates is inflation and inflation is still</p>
<p>   very low and if we, as we intend to do, produce a surplus in the</p>
<p>   budget in May, that will be a ball-point for interest rates. I mean</p>
<p>   that will be a real ball-point for interest rates. We will deliver</p>
<p>   the first budget surplus for years and we will have turned a $10.5</p>
<p>   million deficit that we inherited two years ago into a surplus of</p>
<p>   perhaps, $2 to $2.5 billion. </p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>The Asian melt-down must be threatening that?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Obviously we would have all been better without it. The real test</p>
<p>   over the next year, 18 months, will be the extent to which the Australian</p>
<p>   economy can take it in its stride and still continue to grow strongly.</p>
<p>   And the indications are that we can and we will, although there</p>
<p>   will obviously be some impact.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>If I may ask a couple of other things, health insurance, I noticed</p>
<p>   from figures the today that the incentives aren't working,</p>
<p>   people are still dropping out at an alarming rate. What can you</p>
<p>   do about it?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, the rate of decline over the last six or nine months, has</p>
<p>   certainly slowed. Neil, the real problem in this area is that something</p>
<p>   should have been done about health incentives six or seven years</p>
<p>   ago, when we still had the critical mass of 38 to 40 per cent of</p>
<p>   people in private health insurance. It was 47% in private health</p>
<p>   insurance in 1988 and it is now, what, 31.6.</p>
<p>Graham Richardson, the former Health Minister in the Labor Government,</p>
<p>   said in 1990, that if something were not done the process would</p>
<p>   continue to deteriorate. Now we are doing our best to stabilise</p>
<p>   it, and we'll continue to do that, but we certainly inherited</p>
<p>   a very difficult situation here because, I think, the former government,</p>
<p>   or some members of it, not Mr Richardson I have to say, because</p>
<p>   he had a different view, but I think some former members of it really</p>
<p>   just wanted to destroy the private health insurance system and they</p>
<p>   just let it run-down.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>I know you have to get away, the waterfront, they are back in court</p>
<p>   today. If they are ordered back to work and it seems unlikely they</p>
<p>   will go back, are we heading for the major conflict that is threatened</p>
<p>   on the wharves?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well the Government doesn't want a major conflict.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Yeah, but is it going to happen?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>What is going to happen is that we're going to support the</p>
<p>   law and the new law allows people to set-up in competition and if</p>
<p>   they want to, to use non-union labour. We have no desire to destroy</p>
<p>   the MUA. We have no desire to destroy union labour on the waterfront.</p>
<p>   All we want is a competitive waterfront and that is exactly what</p>
<p>   the National Farmers' Federation are trying to do.</p>
<p>We don't seek a huge national barney over this, we never have,</p>
<p>   but we do seek a more competitive waterfront. I think it is very</p>
<p>   interesting that the MUA is talking rhetorically, but when you actually</p>
<p>   look at some of their deeds, they're being very wary. That</p>
<p>   signals to me two things: A recognition by them that the law has</p>
<p>   changed and it is a lot harder for them to play-up than used to</p>
<p>   be the case and the second thing is that I don't know that</p>
<p>   they are getting as much support from some of their union mates</p>
<p>   as they might like.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>This weekend, at Thredbo, you have what has been described to me</p>
<p>   as a love-in.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>A love-in, yes, everybody says that, when you all go away for the</p>
<p>   weekend.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>What is the most titillating part of the love-in?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I think, talking about the year. I mean, if it were just</p>
<p>   a weekend of fun, but there will be quite a lot of work, Neil.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Tax?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>We'll talk about tax reform, yes, we will.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>How close are we to getting detail on tax reform?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, closer than we were a few months ago, obviously. Look Neil,</p>
<p>   we will tell the Australian public, in great detail, what our plans</p>
<p>   are well before the election. And, we obviously will be talking</p>
<p>   about the handling of that, strategically. We'll obviously</p>
<p>   be talking about the year ahead. We'll be saying something</p>
<p>   about, to our marginal seat holders, about marginal seat campaigning</p>
<p>   because there is going to be an election in the next year. We are</p>
<p>   into the third year, on the second of March, of the Government's</p>
<p>   term and it is a damn good opportunity to get together and I also</p>
<p>   hope, on a more, sort of, personal note, it is a demonstration of</p>
<p>   solidarity and support for a community of Australia that had a very</p>
<p>   hard time last year.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>I wonder, if we can just go back to the health insurance thing,</p>
<p>   quickly, because I still have that on the mind. Will you do something</p>
<p>   else though, I mean it is not working, it is not working well enough,</p>
<p>   what you are trying, are you have a look at different ideas?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, it is an area where, consistent with our commitment to Medicare,</p>
<p>   that we are always looking at ways of improving the situation. I</p>
<p>   don't think the task of health reform is ever completed. I haven't</p>
<p>   known an issue on the Australian political agenda, over the last</p>
<p>   10 years, that has ever, sort of been, so dealt with, that people</p>
<p>   could say, well we don't have to do anything more on that front.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>It has cost a lot of money and it is not working.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, it doesn't cost, the expenditure on health in Australia</p>
<p>   is not, by western world standards, as high as most other countries.</p>
<p>   I mean, the United States spends far more of its GDP on health than</p>
<p>   does Australia. And we should be very careful that we don't</p>
<p>   always run the health system in Australia down. We have some very,</p>
<p>   very fine hospitals, both public and private, in this country.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Public ones are stretched though because of exactly this.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I mean, I have, I have seen the quality of both and there are some</p>
<p>   that are stretched, yes, but the services they deliver are still</p>
<p>   very, very high quality and the quality of our doctors and nurses</p>
<p>   is extremely high. And it does worry me, that in the whole debate,</p>
<p>   the impression is being created in the community, that in some-how-or-other,</p>
<p>   we have a third rate health system in this country. That is not</p>
<p>   true. You are still safer and better treated in this country than</p>
<p>   in, say, the United States and in most nations of Europe.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, thank you for your time, given that it is a love-in</p>
<p>   at the weekend, will the first lady be getting a Valentines Day</p>
<p>   gift?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, we met on Valentines Day. </p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Well it is an important day?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Tomorrow is a very important day, in fact tomorrow will be the</p>
<p>   28th anniversary of Janette and I meeting, so it is certainly, 14th</p>
<p>   February 1970.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>And, as a treat, you are taking her to a Liberal Party meeting?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I knew you would say that. No we are looking forward to the weekend.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Thank you for your time.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
