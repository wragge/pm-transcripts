JOINT STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER AND THE PREMIER OF<br />
NEW SOUTH WALES<br />
The Army Reserve NSW Headquarters unit presently located at<br />
Moore Park in Sydney is to move to enable the development of a<br />
proposed new sports stadium. Following consultations with the NSW<br />
Government, the Commonwealth has agreed to vacate the 3.68 ha<br />
site by 24 April 1986, provided suitable alternative<br />
accommodation can be obtained.<br />
The Moore Park site, which is adjacent to the Sydney Cricket<br />
Ground and Royal Agricultural Showground, was transferred to the<br />
Commonwealth at Federation and expanded in 1932. Under the 1979<br />
Commonwealth NSW land exchange agreement, the site was.<br />
transferred to NSW in 1981 and since then has been leased back to<br />
the Commonwealth for Army use. . IjJZ </p>
