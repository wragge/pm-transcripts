Prime Minister Julia Gillard and Acting Attorney-General Brendan O'Connor today announced the Australian Government will provide additional payments for people significantly affected by the Queensland floods crisis.</p>
<p>The Australian Government Disaster Recovery Payment will be available to people significantly affected by flooding in Queensland Local Government Areas that have been declared natural disaster zones.</p>
<p>There are currently 41 LGAs across Queensland that are natural disasters zones.</p>
<p>There are many people across Queensland who will be doing it extremely tough over the new year as a result of these floods.</p>
<p>These payments will see $1000 for each adult and $400 for each child in the hands of families most in need, including people who have lost their homes or whose homes have sustained major damage.</p>
<p>The payments will be delivered by Centrelink, subject to eligibility criteria. The Australian Government will establish an Emergency Assistance Hotline on 180 2266 to receive claims for assistance.</p>
<p>The hotline will be open between 8am - 8pm (QLD time), seven days a week from tomorrow, Saturday 1 January. Centrelink staff will also be available in some recovery/evacuation centres. Arrangements allowing the payments to flow will be finalised in the coming days.</p>
<p>Today's announcement is in addition to assistance from the Australian Government already being provided through the Natural Disaster Relief and Recovery Arrangements (NDRRA).</p>
<p>The NDRRA funding will be provided to Queensland for counter disaster operations and for the restoration of essential public infrastructure - such as bridges, roads and schools - where expenditure exceeds certain thresholds and requirements. Personal hardship grants and distress grants are also available.</p>
<p>Late yesterday and this morning, Toowoomba Regional Council and Woorabinda and Cherbourg Aboriginal Council areas were declared natural disaster zones.</p>
<p>There are also hundreds of volunteers, emergency services workers and ADF personnel who bring in the new year supporting flood-affected communities in Queensland. We thank them for their tireless work in helping their fellow Australians.</p>
<p>The Gillard Government will continue to work closely with the Queensland Government to provide support to these communities.</p>
<p>More information on Australian Government assistance is available at the Disaster Assist website.</p>
