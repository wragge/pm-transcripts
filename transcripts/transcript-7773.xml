    <content><![CDATA[<p>PRIME MINISTER<br />TRANSCRIPT OF NEWS CONFERENCE, MURAL HALL, PARLIAMENT HOUSE<br />13 OCTOBER 1989<br />E OE PROOF ONLY</p>
<p><br />JOURNALIST: Prime minister, the Liberal Party's tax policy seems to be a bit of an electoral winner.</p>
<p><br />PM: would you like to bet? Just let me say this briefly<br />about this misnomer that was issued yesterday. It's called<br />an economic action plan. I'd say three things about it. It<br />is economically irrelevant. It is socially outrageous.<br />And it is factually false. Let me indicate what I mean by<br />that. It is obviously economically irrelevant. It is not<br />an economic action plan. It offers no alternative to the<br />basic economic strategy that is being followed by this<br />Government. Indeed it would inevitably mean higher interest<br />rates under their proposals. Secondly it is socially<br />outrageous because it represents an immediate return by the<br />Liberals and National Party to the socially divisive and<br />inequitable policies that characterised their period in<br />government before we came to office in ' 83. It represents a<br />situation where they will increase payments to the well off<br />in the community at the expense of those legitimately in<br />need the poor, the Aborigines, the migrants and it<br />disadvantages in education terms the lower income groups in<br />the community. Thirdly it is factually false. It says in<br />the document in regard to the investment boom that is going<br />on at the present time, it says in much of the investment we<br />have seen it's been in areas it says with little prospects<br />of producing significantly higher export incomes. In this<br />same week that they have produced this falsehood, Access<br />Economics, the organisation which they used to cost their<br />programs, has published a report on investment in this<br />country. They list 500 projects of $ 5 million or more each<br />which are either under construction, or are committed, or<br />under consideration, which total $ 90 billion. Of that<br />billion of project, 54% are actually in the category of<br />being under constructi-on or committed. And in respect of<br />those, Access Economics in its document says that they will<br />generate increases on an annual basis in export income of<br />billion and in total with those under consideration<br />billion. So, as I say, the document is economically<br />irrelevant. It is socially outrageous. And it is patently,<br />on the bas-is of the Liberal's own organisation that they've<br />used, Access Economics, it is factually false.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, you said this helps the well off. Most Australian families with children wouldn't consider themselves well off.</p>
<p><br />PM: No, but I'm not saying that in the area of families<br />that they are not a legitimate area of consideration.<br />That's why in fact we have in our period of office done the<br />things which are important for families. Most particularly<br />of course in the area of education where we have now created<br />a position where the children of this country, irrespective<br />of the income levels of their parents, now have an<br />infinitely greater access to, commitment to, and retention<br />within the education system. What I am saying is that in<br />the area of their massive handouts that they are proposing<br />they are putting no income testing on it. So that families<br />which are very, very well off and who according to the<br />philosophy which has been outlined for instance by the<br />president of the Liberal Party who says that all outlays in<br />the welfare area should be means-tested, they have abandoned<br />any pretense at means-testing so that the most well off in<br />the community will get increased benefits while those who<br />are most in need, and legitimately in need, will have<br />benefits taken away from them. It will be a case of the<br />poor paying for the wealthy. It will be a case of the rich<br />getting richer and the deserving poor getting poorer.<br />JOURNALIST: Is it a clever political document Prime Minister?</p>
<p>PM: No I don't believe it's a clever political document. I believe that it contains further seeds of the destruction of this discredited conservative coalition.<br />ends<br /> </p>
