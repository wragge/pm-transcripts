<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I think they’re very good.  I think what they do is enable the community to recognise indigenous artists and the quality is superb and gives everybody a sense of identification with their own culture.  So I think it’s great.  And you can see from the enthusiasm of people who won the awards just how important it is to them.  And I think it’s important to the rest of us to have an opportunity to honour the special nature of indigenous artists.  And it’s part of the reconciliation process to respect each others’ abilities and special characteristics.  I think they’re great evenings and I’m delighted to play a small part.  I think it’s great to have companies like Rothschilds making a financial contribution and I want to compliment Peter King and the Heritage Commission for their leadership in sponsoring the awards. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Do you have full confidence in Peter Cosgrove over his handling of these recent allegations?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes, absolutely, totally, 100%.  </p>
