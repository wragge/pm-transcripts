<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I think theyâre very good.  I think what they do is enable the community to recognise indigenous artists and the quality is superb and gives everybody a sense of identification with their own culture.  So I think itâs great.  And you can see from the enthusiasm of people who won the awards just how important it is to them.  And I think itâs important to the rest of us to have an opportunity to honour the special nature of indigenous artists.  And itâs part of the reconciliation process to respect each othersâ abilities and special characteristics.  I think theyâre great evenings and Iâm delighted to play a small part.  I think itâs great to have companies like Rothschilds making a financial contribution and I want to compliment Peter King and the Heritage Commission for their leadership in sponsoring the awards. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Do you have full confidence in Peter Cosgrove over his handling of these recent allegations?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes, absolutely, totally, 100%.  </p>
