FOR MEDIA EMBARGOED AGAINST<br />
TALK BY THE PRIME MINISTER DELIVERY<br />
TO NATIONAL WOMEN's CONSULTATIVE COUNCIL<br />
CANBERRA 8 NOVEMBER 1984<br />
I am very pleased to be here today toc meet you. Senator Ryan<br />
has spoken to me about your enthusiasm and energy in tackling<br />
the work set for the new Council LEt me assure you that<br />
your efforts are appreciated the Government will always pay<br />
very close attention to your views ort matters of importance<br />
to women.<br />
A key feature of the Government's efforts to improve the<br />
status of women has been our policy on increasing the number<br />
of women involved in decision-making.<br />
The reason we attach such importance to this goal should be<br />
clearly understood.<br />
The Government starts from the premise that merit and<br />
fairness should be the basis upon which appointments to<br />
Government decision-making bodies are made. Accordingly,<br />
women with appropriate experience and specialist skills are<br />
considered for appointment alongside their male counterparts.<br />
When women are appointed it is because of their expertise or<br />
because they provide skilled representation of the interests<br />
of a particular group.<br />
Guided by these principles, the Go vernment has sought to<br />
ensure that, wherev~ er possible, women are represented on<br />
important decision-making bodies.<br />
We have had considerable success. More-than 100 women have<br />
been appointed to Government Boards and Authorities since we<br />
took office.<br />
Some women are the first ever to be appointed to the<br />
particular Board Judith Yates on the Board of the<br />
Commonwealth Banking Corporation and Rhonda Mclver on the<br />
Board of the Meat and Livestock Corporation are two women who<br />
share that distinction. </p>
<p>Hylda Rolfe was chosen to head the Prices Surveillance<br />
Authority. Di Yerbury has been appointed Manager of the<br />
Australia Council.<br />
Other women have been appointed to Boards or Councils to<br />
represent the interests of a particular group. For example,<br />
on EPAC, the Economic Planning Advisory Council, Lois Cutts<br />
represents Local Government and Jan Marsh, the Australian<br />
Council of Trade Unions.<br />
What all these women have in common is their recognised<br />
expertise and suitability for their particular appointments.<br />
Women of talent in the Public Service have benefitted, too,<br />
from our policy of involving more women-. in positions of<br />
executive responsibility. Again their appointments and<br />
promotions are based on merit and fairness and again the<br />
policy is achieving results.<br />
When we came into office there were just thirty-two women in<br />
the Second Division. Today that number ' has more than<br />
doubled. There are 68 women in what is now the Senior<br />
Executive Service and more are in very senior, posts. You<br />
probably know of Deputy Secretaries Ann Kern in the Health<br />
Department and Helen Williams in the Department of Education<br />
and Youth Affairs. There is also Deputy Commissioner Jocelyn<br />
McGirr in Veterans' Affairs. The recent appointment of<br />
Jocelyn Chey as Senior Trade Commissioner in Beijing adds yet<br />
another woman to the ranks of those in top Government jobs.<br />
The Government has also judged that, at times, there is a<br />
need to appoint women to Government bodies in order to ensure<br />
women's views are taken into account in decision-making. I<br />
strongly believe that there should be women representing<br />
woment s interests when significant national issues are<br />
debated. The National Women's Consultative Council is a body whose<br />
members have been appointed to do this. Through you, the<br />
Government has the benefit of women's views on significant<br />
issues and take those views into consideration: in our<br />
decision-making. The diverse and representative nature of<br />
your Council means that it is particularly suited to this<br />
task. The appointment of two members of your Council to the Working<br />
Party on Affirmative Action legislation is another example of<br />
the Government's wish to have women's position in employment<br />
improved. I intend to follow this precedent in deciding who will attend<br />
the Taxation Summit which I announced last week: at least<br />
one of your members should be there with a brief to represent,<br />
women's interests. </p>
<p>Involving more women in Government and consulting with women<br />
and women's organisations are integral to my Government's<br />
consensus approach to decision-making. So, too, is<br />
consultation with groups such as business and the trade union<br />
movement on issues of importance to women. The Government's<br />
Affirmative Action pilot program is a classic example of cooperation<br />
between Government and the major economic partners.<br />
I take the view, and it is shared by my Ministers, that we<br />
will be able to have more progressive government and a better<br />
society if long-lasting social reform is implemented on the<br />
basis of genuine consultation and co-operation in the<br />
development of policy.<br />
I have already mentioned the Government's Affirmative Action<br />
program. We recognised that women suffer many disadvantages<br />
in the labour market. We realised that special measures and<br />
programs were needed to ensure that women acquire the skills,<br />
experience and training to compete on an equal basis with men<br />
for jobs and promotions. We consulted with some of the<br />
largest and most important companies in the country about<br />
implementing affirmative action. As a result, 28 companies<br />
have agreed to assist the Government by joining the pilot<br />
program. The program is comprehensive, voluntary and it will<br />
steer us towards the best way of permanently ensuring that<br />
women are given equal job opportunities with men in our<br />
society. It will also make it possible for more women to be<br />
involved in making decisions in the private sector.<br />
Our interest in these matters is more than just rhetorical.<br />
I am happy to announce today a program of grants totalling<br />
$ 472,000 to assist women.<br />
The first part of the program will provide an annual increase<br />
of $ 122,000 in funds for grants to national women's<br />
organisations to be administered by my Department. The<br />
Government has recognised that national women's organisations<br />
receive very little funding and support in comparison with<br />
other equivalent bodies, We believe that financial<br />
assistance through these grants will improve the capacity of<br />
women's organisations to take part in community decisionmaking<br />
generally and in particular will equip them with the<br />
means to research, consult and debate on issues of particular<br />
significance to women. In addition it will provide resources;<br />
to assist women improve services, such as mailing and<br />
newsletter production, within their own organisations.<br />
The second part of the program will be of particular benefit<br />
to you as Council Members. My Government accepts that the<br />
brief we have given you is a very broad one and that it may<br />
be difficult and expensive for member organisations to<br />
carry out the consultation with women we require of you. The<br />
Government has therefore approved a special one-off payment<br />
of $ 10,000 for each non-Government member organisation for<br />
its two year term on Council. This would provide Council </p>
<p>4.<br />
members with the resources required to research the<br />
considered views of women in their organisations on the<br />
various topics on which the Council is consulted by my<br />
colleague, Senator Ryan. I expect that the funds will be<br />
well spent on conferences and meeting costs, postage,<br />
printing and photostating of materials and other expenses<br />
associated with conferring with members.<br />
In the third part of this package, funds totalling $ 200,000<br />
will be allocated annually for grants to approved<br />
organisations for projects to assist women. Such<br />
organisations could include trade unions, churches, ethnic or<br />
aboriginal groups as well as the traditional women's<br />
organisations. Organisations will be able to apply for<br />
financial assistance to implement projects which increase<br />
women's participation in decision-making or to develop<br />
programs for their organisation of particular benefit to<br />
women. The grant could conceivably fund, or partially fund,<br />
the employment of a project officer whose task it was to<br />
produce material for women members and bring about a more<br />
active role for women in the organisation.<br />
The Government will stipulate that there should normally be a<br />
limit of $ 15,000 for any one grant. It has agreed, though,<br />
that where the project was of national significance, an<br />
exception to this rule might be made.<br />
The whole program is designed to increase the input of women<br />
into decisions made for and about them. I would appreciate<br />
your assistance in publicising this new program. I am sure<br />
you will agree that it is important to get t: he best possible<br />
field from which to select projects of most benefit to women.<br />
Now it is my turn in the limited time available to listen to<br />
you and, through you, to hear the views of women in the<br />
community. Afterwards I look forward to receiving a full<br />
report on the outcome of your two-day meeting. I trust that<br />
the Council's deliberations will be useful to you, to your<br />
organisations and to Australian women. I know that they will<br />
be of value to the Government. </p>
