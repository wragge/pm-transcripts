CHECK AGA! ST DELIVERY EMBARCOED UNTIL DELIVERY<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
PRESENTATION OF 1990 WALKLEY AWARDS<br />
NATIONAL PRESS CLUB 12 DECEMBER 1990<br />
At face value, it's not exactly the best time to be a<br />
journalist. " Financial difficulties" is hardly an adequate phrase for an<br />
industry where two out of three TV networks are in<br />
receivership; where the Fairfax chain is in receivership;<br />
where News Corporation has its own share of debt problems;<br />
where commercial radio and some regional media are also<br />
struggling. Unfortunately, many employees, including journalists, have<br />
paid the price, with their jobs, for their employers'<br />
mistakes.<br />
And those still in the industry are having to do more with<br />
less, as financial resources available for news gathering<br />
and presenting dry up.<br />
But despite the gloom, today's presentation of the 1990<br />
Walkley Awards is, legitimately and genuinely, a cause for<br />
celebration. This is an occasion to honour individual award winners<br />
journalists who have risen to the heights of excellence over<br />
the past twelve months.<br />
And it is also an occasion for celebrating the<br />
professionalism and excellence of journalism itself.<br />
I am not trying to put any false gloss on what have been<br />
traumatic events for the news industry over the past couple<br />
of years. Jobs have been lost, outlets have been closed,<br />
programs have been axed, and editorial budgets have been<br />
trimmed. But the faults and failings of management haven't stopped<br />
the news industry from carrying out its essential task. </p>
<p>As ever, that task is to keep the public informed, so that<br />
it can exercise its sovereign role in our democratic<br />
society.<br />
And as ever, whether that task is performed depends for the<br />
most part not on the quality of the managers but on the<br />
quality of the journalists on their professionalism, their<br />
dedication, their integrity and their thirst for news.<br />
So it is essential to our democracy this quality survives<br />
and flourishes. Today we are celebrating the fact that it<br />
does. It's interesting to ask ourselves why this is so. What are<br />
the conditions under which journalism will continue to<br />
flourish as a vital and independent source of information<br />
and opinion in Australia?<br />
I know that many journalists, and others, are deeply<br />
concerned that the nature and the concentration of media<br />
ownership in Australia poses a threat to journalism.<br />
The recent rally at the Sydney Opera House shows the depth<br />
of passion, if not the factual insight, that exists on this<br />
issue.<br />
I am not going to deny that it is preferable for the<br />
Australian media to be owned by a diverse range of<br />
Australian proprietors.<br />
Indeed, the effect of the ownership rules that my Government<br />
has introduced has been of course to enhance the diversity<br />
of media owners in any one market.<br />
As far as the average person is concerned, diversity of<br />
media sources is guaranteed. We have placed an insuperable<br />
structural impediment in the way of anyone who might seek to<br />
impose a monolithic editorial view on a community.<br />
And as I made clear in my press conference yesterday, my<br />
preference is for continued Australian ownership of the<br />
Fairfax group.<br />
But let me state my belief here, as someone who is about as<br />
avid a consumer of the media as anyone, that such issues of<br />
ownership, while significant, do not constitute the sole, or<br />
necessarily even the most important, determinant of the<br />
media's capacity to exercise its crucial democratic role.<br />
Diverse ownership has not necessarily created diverse<br />
output; and uniform ownership has not necessarily created<br />
uniform output.<br />
The truth of the first statement is apparent in the<br />
programming history of the three commercial TV networks. </p>
<p>Australia's networks, each owned by-separate companies, have<br />
nevertheless adhered, for decades, to almost identical<br />
programming strategies. They have provided the broadcasting<br />
equivalent of the Two Airlines Agreement, offering the same<br />
formulas of news, sport and entertainment, at the same hours<br />
of the day, for the same broad markets. I hope the current<br />
shake-out in television will, within the framework of<br />
adequate and comprehensive services, lead to some bolder<br />
departures from those well-tried formulas.<br />
The proof of the second statement I made that uniform<br />
ownership does not necessarily create uniform output is<br />
obvious in the very different coverage of Canberra provided<br />
by the Telegraph Mirror in Sydney and the Herald-Sun in<br />
Melbourne. The fact that these newspapers are News<br />
Corporation stable-mates does not prevent each paper from<br />
taking quite different stances on a number of issues.<br />
Indeed, regardless of media ownership, Australians today are<br />
being exposed to a greater diversity of opinion within the<br />
media than ever before. There are more columnists, and<br />
reporters themselves are exercising greater interpretative<br />
and analytic powers especially as newspapers take up the<br />
role of backgrounding the news that is reported in more<br />
truncated form by TV.<br />
So while I repeat that of course I do not dismiss the<br />
significance of ownership, the quality and diversity of<br />
editorial output is determined by many other factors.<br />
In the final analysis, it is determined by the quality of<br />
the editorial staff.<br />
It is determined by the people at the coal-face of news<br />
gathering and news presenting: reporters, news editors,<br />
producers and editors.<br />
Ultimately, the responsibility for maintaining the media's<br />
performance in a democratic society rests on those people.<br />
And judged by that criterion, the Australian media, that is<br />
to say, the profession of Australian journalism, is doing a<br />
great job though I must say that even after all my years<br />
in public life I've never lost the capacity to be amazed at<br />
the performance of some of the Canberra Press Gallery. But<br />
that is another story.<br />
It is for all these reasons that I particularly welcome the<br />
concept of a Charter of Independence.<br />
I know the Charter idea originated in response to a<br />
particular ownership question at a particular newspaper<br />
the 1988 Robert Maxwell attempt to take over The Age. But<br />
its significance now extends beyond that circumstance to<br />
embrace a fundamentally important facet of the media today. </p>
<p>Because if what I have said so far is true that it is<br />
output rather than ownership that ultimately determines the<br />
quality of the finished product then any movement that<br />
defends the significance and sweep of control by the editor<br />
rather than the proprietor must be welcome.<br />
My friends,<br />
I don't want to spend a lot of time today singling out<br />
individual award winners. But it would be remiss of me not<br />
to express particular congratulations to the journalists who<br />
have won awards for overseas reporting:<br />
Peter Cave for his radio news reports on the fall<br />
of the Berlin Wall;<br />
Greg Wilsemith for his radio current affairs<br />
reports on the Iran earthquake. Since that tragic<br />
earthquake, Wilesmith's superb work has continued<br />
in his coverage of the Gulf crisis;<br />
and Four Corners cameraman Wayne Harley for his<br />
extraordinary camera work on the Ethiopian famine.<br />
We have seen over the past year or so the very world change<br />
before our eyes.<br />
What used to be accepted axioms of international affairs<br />
have been jettisoned with the relaxation of tensions between<br />
the superpowers, the overthrow of the repressive regimes of<br />
eastern Europe, the reunification of Germany, and the<br />
reemergence of an effective United Nations Organisation.<br />
Today we confront a new set of profoundly testing problems:<br />
the Gulf crisis, the possibility of trade war, the daunting<br />
legacy of economic, social and environmental problems<br />
bequeathed to the new democratic rulers of Eastern Europe.<br />
If ever there was a time in the past four decades when<br />
Australians needed expert and informed coverage of global<br />
affairs, surely it is now. And it is very important that<br />
such coverage be provided by Australian reporters.<br />
It's clear today that we are being well served in this<br />
regard and it is probably no coincidence that the three<br />
Award winners I have named are all employed by the<br />
Australian Broadcasting Corporation whose reputation for<br />
informed international reporting is secure.<br />
Let me close as I began.<br />
In what are generally gloomy times for your industry, these<br />
awards demonstrate the continuing commitment of Australian<br />
journalists to the standards of excellence and the<br />
continuing capacity of the best of them to attain those<br />
standards. </p>
<p>It is important that once a year the profession of<br />
journalism gathers in this way to pay tribute to those of<br />
its members of surpassing quality.<br />
It is all to the good that journalists and the sponsor of<br />
the Walkley Awards reward excellence with public acclaim,<br />
and display excellence so that it can be emulated by others.<br />
In this way, you are ensuring in a direct way that your<br />
vital standards of professionalism are safeguarded and<br />
promoted. </p>
