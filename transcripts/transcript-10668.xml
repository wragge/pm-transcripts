    <content><![CDATA[<p>E&amp;OE...............................................</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Today's unemployment figures are very encouraging. They demonstrate</p>
<p>   that the employment gains of the past few months have been consolidated.</p>
<p>   The level of unemployment of 8.1 per cent is the lowest for over</p>
<p>   two years. The outlook over the next few months for jobs in Australia</p>
<p>   according to all of the advice coming to the Government remains</p>
<p>   very strong.</p>
<p>We do have a robust and strongly growing domestic economy. And</p>
<p>   at my first news conference since Christmas and into the New Year,</p>
<p>   let me say again how very important it was, given what has happened</p>
<p>   in Asia, that my Government took the action it did regarding the</p>
<p>   Budget and all the other reforms that we have implemented over the</p>
<p>   last 22 months.</p>
<p>And the Labor Party stands condemned on two counts. Firstly, the</p>
<p>   appalling deficit of $10.5 billion it left us. And secondly, its</p>
<p>   attempts to stop us fixing the mess. Mr Beazley is like somebody</p>
<p>   who sets fire to a building and then says: don't bother to</p>
<p>   call the brigade and when it comes he cuts the fire-hose, and when</p>
<p>   the flames go out he says: well it would have happened anyway.</p>
<p>We took the hard action and by taking that difficult action in</p>
<p>   the face of Labor Party obstruction we have provided a protection</p>
<p>   for the Australian economy, and we see the Australian economy performing</p>
<p>   extremely well in the face of very difficult circumstances. And</p>
<p>   today's employment numbers, as I say, consolidate the employment</p>
<p>   gains of the past few months and they show the lowest level of unemployment</p>
<p>   since 1995.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister are they good enough to go to an election?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>The only person who is talking about an election at the moment</p>
<p>   is the National Secretary of the Labor Party.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, is the Government.. [inaudible]...?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I am not going to get into statistical predictions. All I can repeat</p>
<p>   is the advice that is publicly available and the advice coming to</p>
<p>   the Government, and that is that the domestic economy is growing</p>
<p>   very strongly. And there was some data out yesterday that was very</p>
<p>   optimistic. Employment is always the last of the indicators to come</p>
<p>   right, we have laid the foundations, if we hadn't fixed the</p>
<p>   deficit, if we had followed Labor's advice, unemployment would</p>
<p>   now be higher because the impact of the Asian melt-down would have</p>
<p>   been much more extensive.</p>
<p>The thing to remember is that if the Beazley advice had been followed</p>
<p>   the Asian melt-down would have seeped through to Australia by now.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Any further idea, I guess, on how Asia will affect Australia in</p>
<p>   the coming year?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>It will affect Australia a lot less because of the protective measures</p>
<p>   that have been taken by my Government. And that is the constant</p>
<p>   and that is the most important element of this whole situation,</p>
<p>   that if we had not done what we had done we would now be feeling</p>
<p>   the pain and the impact and some of the experiences that have been</p>
<p>   felt in other parts of the world. But because we took the action</p>
<p>   we did, because we made inflation in Australia lower than most countries,</p>
<p>   because we cut the national debt, because we are heading for a surplus</p>
<p>   budget and not a deficit budget, because we repaired the Beazley</p>
<p>   black hole or filled it in, despite his objections, we are now in</p>
<p>   a much stronger position than would otherwise have been the case.</p>
<p>   And I think that will become more and more apparent as 1998 wears</p>
<p>   on.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>With a good economic outlook as you described, isn't that</p>
<p>   a great time to go to an election?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>We were elected for three years.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Has Mr Zammit spoken to you yet about his resignation?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I am not aware of anybody resigning.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, the situation in Asia does it make the Government nervous</p>
<p>   [inaudible]?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I would be a lot more nervous if I hadn't had behind me the</p>
<p>   action taken by the Government. The fact is that we have strengthened</p>
<p>   the foundations of the Australian economy, we are growing very strongly</p>
<p>   domestically and the outlook domestically is very strong indeed,</p>
<p>   for investment, for jobs and consumer confidence. All of the indicators</p>
<p>   are very strong and I can only contemplate the completely different</p>
<p>   picture we would have faced in this country if we had not taken</p>
<p>   the action that we did.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>..[inaudible]...worst is over for the Australian dollar, it has</p>
<p>   taken a bit of a pounding?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I don't talk ever about the level of the Australian dollar.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Paul Zammit says he is resigning from the Liberal Party over the</p>
<p>   issue of airport noise, do you think that issue will go away? Is</p>
<p>   the Government going to change its stance at all?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I am not aware of anybody having resigned.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Are you ...[inaudible]...?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I meet my colleagues regularly from time to time all of them, you</p>
<p>   know it is open house here.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Have you spoken to him?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Oh I speak to him regularly, very regularly.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>What about the issue he raises where he says that the some see</p>
<p>   a delay to the flight path as an obstruction at the moment, what</p>
<p>   is wrong?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I think the plan that we brought down is a very fair plan because</p>
<p>   it spreads the noise burden around. But as to its impact on specific</p>
<p>   electorates I am not going to talk about it.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Do you support Tim Fischer's view that Aboriginals in western</p>
<p>   Queensland are vetoing Australian democracy and economic development</p>
<p>   with native title claims, competing claims?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I've long since learnt to read what is quoted to me, with</p>
<p>   respect, at news conferences about what my colleagues have been</p>
<p>   alleged to have said before I comment on them myself.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Were you not familiar with Mr Fischer's views?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I repeat the answer I have just given you.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>[Inaudible]...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I hold a very strong view that politics and sport should be separately</p>
<p>   administered, however, I can well understand the views of many,</p>
<p>   and I heard one expressed very cogently and lucidly this morning</p>
<p>   on AM by a very prominent Australian sports figure, that when international</p>
<p>   bodies have rules those rules should be rigidly enforced. It is</p>
<p>   a matter for the controlling body of swimming to determine, as it</p>
<p>   is a matter for the controlling body of any other internationally</p>
<p>   competed sport. But I don't think it is appropriate for Prime</p>
<p>   Ministers or others to give ex-cathedra pronouncements about</p>
<p>   what ought to happen. I will deal with the Government of the country,</p>
<p>   I will leave it to those who govern sport. The only advice I would</p>
<p>   give them is, if you have got a set of rules those rules fall into</p>
<p>   disrepute unless you enforce them.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Will it affect relations between China and Australia?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Would it be a problem for us if China were banned for four years...[inaudible]?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>That really infringes on what I said I wasn't going to do</p>
<p>   a moment ago.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, Indonesia has fallen apart economically and since</p>
<p>   the review of the budget was released, are you therefore expecting</p>
<p>   a harder impact on Australia than what's earlier predicted?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well Indonesia despite her great political importance to Australia</p>
<p>   is nowhere near as important a trading partner as, for example Japan</p>
<p>   or South Korea. So therefore the direct impact on Australia via</p>
<p>   exports and imports from the downturn in Indonesia is nowhere near</p>
<p>   as great as you might otherwise expect.</p>
<p>I am pleased that Indonesia appears to be responding to the package</p>
<p>   of the International Monetary Fund. And I had a discussion with</p>
<p>   President Soeharto about this at the weekend and I urged him to</p>
<p>   act in a way that gave a very clear signal to the rest of the world</p>
<p>   that the Indonesian Government was prepared to take the corrective</p>
<p>   measures necessary to strengthen international perceptions about</p>
<p>   the Indonesian economy. Now there are some very encouraging signs</p>
<p>   that that is now occurring, and I welcome that, and I congratulate</p>
<p>   the Indonesian Government on having taken those steps. It is obviously</p>
<p>   a difficult time for our nearest neighbour, and it is a matter of</p>
<p>   great political significance that the sixth-most populace country</p>
<p>   in the world should be passing through these economic difficulties.</p>
<p>But because our own domestic economy is so strong and because the</p>
<p>   trade between our two countries, although important, ..[inaudible]...as</p>
<p>   large as, for example trade between Australia and Japan. I don't</p>
<p>   think there is any cause at all for any direct immediate concern</p>
<p>   so far as the Australian economy is concerned.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Does Australia risk getting its fingers burnt at all by participating</p>
<p>   in those IMF packages?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, on the contrary what we demonstrate is that we are strong and</p>
<p>   able to help our friends and our neighbours in the region. How much</p>
<p>   more ashamed would we be as Australians if we had to say to the</p>
<p>   rest of the world: look I am sorry we can't help you because</p>
<p>   our economy is so weak and impoverished, we had such a huge budget</p>
<p>   deficit. I am rather proud of the fact that my country can help</p>
<p>   our friends and our neighbours in their time of need. Our contributions</p>
<p>   are appropriate, they are within the framework of an IMF bail-out</p>
<p>   package. I remind all of you that until the recent batch the biggest</p>
<p>   bail-out by the IMF of any country was Mexico and all of the resources</p>
<p>   invested in the Mexico bail-out were, in fact, repaid without deduction</p>
<p>   and nobody lost any money at all.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, would it be a worry for Australia if Soeharto goes?</p>
<p>   Would you be worried about the stability?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I don't want to comment on the future leadership of any other</p>
<p>   country, it is a matter for the people of Indonesia. President Soeharto</p>
<p>   has brought enormous stability to that country. He rescued it from</p>
<p>   the brink of chaos in the 1960s. The question of future arrangements</p>
<p>   in Indonesia is entirely a matter for the Indonesian people.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Will the Government increase funds for marketing tourism to the</p>
<p>   Australian Tourist Commission as the industry has been calling for</p>
<p>   today following the....[inaudible]...on flights from Jakarta and</p>
<p>   obviously South Korea?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I understand why the spokesman for the tourist industry would</p>
<p>   do that, it is a perfectly natural thing. We put a lot of resources</p>
<p>   into the tourist industry and we continue to keep those resources</p>
<p>   under review. We don't have any immediate plans to respond</p>
<p>   to that request but obviously we keep the welfare and the strength</p>
<p>   of the industry very much under review. </p>
<p>And I think it is important to take a longer view. I mean a few</p>
<p>   months ago people were saying that tourism was drying up because</p>
<p>   of certain other things and that proved to be wrong. Let's</p>
<p>   wait and see before we respond in any knee-jerk reactions.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, will you rule out an election in July?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I am not going to get into any election speculation but I am interested</p>
<p>   in what </p>
<p>Mr Gray is saying. What I want for the Australian people is a year</p>
<p>   committed to building on the strength of the Australian economy,</p>
<p>   dealing with issues like Wik and I'd say again to the Australian</p>
<p>   Senate, the public wants Wik behind it. The public is fed up with</p>
<p>   this debate. They are fed up with the Senate and the Labor Party</p>
<p>   delaying it. Our package is a fair and balanced package. Pass it</p>
<p>   so we can get on with the rest of our lives.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, your reaction to criticism of Work for the Dole?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>My reaction is to say that Work for the Dole is based on a very</p>
<p>   important Australian principle and that is the principle of mutual</p>
<p>   obligation. And it is very important to understand that Work for</p>
<p>   the Dole was brought in, partly, to fulfil that principle. And that</p>
<p>   is, if you fulfil your moral obligation as a society to look after</p>
<p>   people who can't get work then it is only reasonable that they</p>
<p>   be asked to do something in return and the compulsory element of</p>
<p>   the scheme was always going to be there. And it will obviously vary</p>
<p>   from project to project - the ratio between voluntary and compulsory.</p>
<p>   But I want to make it very clear that we have absolutely no intention</p>
<p>   at all of weakening our commitment to the Work for the Dole Scheme.</p>
<p>If anything we will be strengthening our commitment to Work for</p>
<p>   the Dole over the weeks and the months ahead because it enshrines</p>
<p>   a very important principle and that is the principle of mutual obligation.</p>
<p>   In a free society governed by decent values you do have to look</p>
<p>   after people who can't get work but they in turn have some</p>
<p>   obligation to </p>
<p>respond to reasonable requests to give something back to the community</p>
<p>   and that is the principle of mutual obligation. We look after people</p>
<p>   who can't get work. They are reasonably asked to give something</p>
<p>   back to the community. It is a very important principle and we certainly</p>
<p>   won't be walking away from it.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>[Inaudible].</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>What I am saying is that the scheme will continue. We are very</p>
<p>   satisfied with its progress. There was always going to be a mix</p>
<p>   of volunteers and others required to do. And the principle is the</p>
<p>   principle of mutual obligation. We look after people who can't</p>
<p>   get work but we ask them to give something back in return. Now that</p>
<p>   is fair, the Australian people support it and it is the underlying</p>
<p>   principle of the whole Scheme.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>[Inaudible]...participation rates...[inaudible].</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>John, you can always say that a figure can be better but they are</p>
<p>   a huge improvement and given that we gained 145,000 jobs in the</p>
<p>   three months prior to the issue of these figures, today's outcome</p>
<p>   represents a remarkable consolidation of those gained. Most of the</p>
<p>   experts thought that the jobless figures released in December of</p>
<p>   last year would show a significant drop in employment. What happened</p>
<p>   was that we had a further gain and we have had a tiny adjustment</p>
<p>   today. So what we have essentially done is to consolidate a gain</p>
<p>   of 140,000 jobs in a period of four months and we have seen a kick</p>
<p>   down in the unemployment rate. Now in relative terms that's</p>
<p>   extraordinarily good news.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>[Inaudible]..the trends..[inaudible]?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I would like to believe it were a trend and I think there is a</p>
<p>   lot indication that it is a trend but one has to be sensibly cautious</p>
<p>   but I have reason to be very optimistic about the strength of the</p>
<p>   domestic economy. It is very strong - the domestic economy - and</p>
<p>   I think you will see that strength continue through into the first</p>
<p>   half of this year.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Are you worried about inflation...[inaudible]?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No I am not worried about it. We appear to have entered a period</p>
<p>   where inflationary expectations have fallen and people no longer</p>
<p>   believe that inflation is going to lift. They are a lot more optimistic</p>
<p>   about the inflation outlook and the inflation rate in Australia</p>
<p>   both underlying and headline is very well within the target of acceptable</p>
<p>   ranges of the Reserve Bank.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>[Inaudible]</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well there certainly is some interesting rumbles coming out of</p>
<p>   Queensland where Peter Beattie has obviously been listening to the</p>
<p>   people of Queensland. And the point about Wik is that what we put</p>
<p>   to the Parliament was already a fair compromise. If we had started</p>
<p>   off arguing for blanket extinguishment of native title I would understand</p>
<p>   the Labor Party's complaint but we didn't. And the only</p>
<p>   thanks that we have got for presenting something that was fair and</p>
<p>   responsible and decent from the outset is total obstruction and</p>
<p>   delay from the Labor Party and I will watch the Labor Party Conference</p>
<p>   with great interest.</p>
<p>Having said what he has said, Peter Beattie, he has now got to</p>
<p>   deliver on those words. I mean, does he support to the full what</p>
<p>   the Labor Party is wanting to do? Does he really believe that it</p>
<p>   is unfair, that 79 per cent of the land mass of Australia is potentially</p>
<p>   claimable as a result of our legislation? Does he believe the percentage</p>
<p>   should be higher? Does he really believe that a pastoralist should</p>
<p>   be denied the right to negotiate even though they are leaseholders</p>
<p>   and yet native title claimants should have the right to negotiate</p>
<p>   over pastoral leaseholders? Does he really believe that pastoralists</p>
<p>   should have inferior rights to native title claimants in his state?</p>
<p>Now these are questions that, I think, are obviously exercising</p>
<p>   his mind and they are exercising the minds of many Queenslanders.</p>
<p>   Now we have presented a fair and decent compromise and we intend</p>
<p>   to pursue it and we ask the Senate to reconsider its position and</p>
<p>   let the Bill go through in March of this year when it is being presented.</p>
<p>[Ends]</p>
