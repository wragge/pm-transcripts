COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA<br />
SPEECH BY<br />
The Rt Hon. J. G. GORTON, M. P.<br />
ON<br />
PRIME MINISTER'S VISIT OVERS<br />
( Ministerial Statement) 2<br />
[ From the ' Parliamentary Debates', 15 April 1969] r<br />
Mr GORTON ( Higgins-Prime Minister)<br />
-by leave-As honourable members are<br />
aware, news of the death of the late<br />
President Eisenhower on 28th March<br />
reached Canberra on Saturday, 29th March,<br />
a few hours before I was to have left on a<br />
visit to Washington for discussions with<br />
the President of the United States of<br />
America. Necessarily, these discussions were<br />
postponed but I continued with my journey<br />
to represent Australia at the funeral ceremonies<br />
for the late President and to make<br />
the official visit to Canada which had been<br />
arranged in response to the invitation of the<br />
Prime Minister of Canada. However, on 1st<br />
April, when I was received by President<br />
Nixon, we were able to re-schedule our<br />
postponed discussions for 6th and 7th May.<br />
This call provided the opportunity for us<br />
to review the topics which we are later to<br />
discuss and the President has arranged for<br />
further preparatory work relating to a<br />
number of topics to be undertaken in<br />
Washington prior to my return.<br />
Subsequently I had separate and preliminary<br />
discussions with the Secretary of<br />
State, the Honourable William P. Rogers,<br />
the Secretary of Defence, the Honourable<br />
Melvin R. Laird, the Secretary of the<br />
Treasury, the Honourable David * M.<br />
Kennedy, and President Nixon's special<br />
adviser, Dr Henry A. Kissinger, on matters<br />
of mutual interest in defence and foreign<br />
14858/ 69 affairs including the conflict in Vietnam<br />
and future stability and progress in the<br />
region of which we are a part. Even in this<br />
introductory stage of our discussions I<br />
found a continuance of the deep interest and<br />
the warmth of friendship that characterises<br />
the Australian-American relationship and 1<br />
look forward to resuming the talks with the<br />
President of the United States and his<br />
Administration on my return to Washington<br />
in three weeks' time.<br />
Since the discussions so far held are of<br />
a preliminary character and since they are<br />
not yet concluded, I think the House will<br />
agree that it would be more appropriate<br />
for a full statement to be made after my<br />
return from the concluding talks. There<br />
was, however, value in the opportunity to<br />
open up discussions on matters which will<br />
be the subject of further study in the United<br />
States before our second series of talks arc<br />
held. On the afternoon of 2nd April I flew to<br />
Ottawa and was welcomed to Canada at<br />
a dinner given by the Prime Minister of<br />
Canada, the Right Honourable Pierre<br />
Trudeau. On the following day I had a<br />
series of discussions with the Prime Minister<br />
and attended a meeting of the Canadian<br />
Cabinet. I also had separate discussions<br />
with the Minister of Industry and the<br />
Minister of Trade and Commerce, the<br />
Honourable Jean-Luc Pepin, the Minister </p>
<p>of Finance and Receiver-General of<br />
Canada, the Honourable Edgar J. Benson,<br />
and the Secretary of State for External<br />
Affairs, the honourable Mitchell Sharpe.<br />
The Canadian Cabinet expressed their<br />
interest in the various forms which their<br />
own participation in the region could take.<br />
We emphasised our joint and mutual<br />
interest in making the International Grains<br />
Agreement work and we had already<br />
arranged discussions about these matters<br />
between experts which were taking place<br />
on that very day in Washington D. C. The Minister of Finance discussed with me<br />
Canadian experience with overseas investment<br />
in Canada.<br />
The principal purpose of my visit was<br />
to foster closer relations between our two<br />
countries. In addition to Mr Pepin's<br />
presence here this month I hope that a visit<br />
to Australia by Mr Trudeau will not be<br />
long delayed and both our Governments<br />
were delighted that a representative party<br />
from the Australian Parliament will be<br />
visiting Canada in June.<br />
