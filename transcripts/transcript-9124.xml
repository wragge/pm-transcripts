STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
THE POLITICAL CYNICISM OF MR COURT<br />
Last year, the. Federal Parliament passed the historic<br />
_ Native Title Act. The legislation is sound, workable, and<br />
balanced., it provides justice f or indigenous Australians following<br />
the High Court Mabo decision. it provides certainty for<br />
Investors and land managers, and protection for existing<br />
title holders.<br />
it provides a national system, dealing in a fair and<br />
reasonable way with a national issue.<br />
The action of Richard Court in challenging this national<br />
legislation has all the hallmarks of political high<br />
cynicism and parochial mischief. He is apparently still<br />
putting what he thinks are his political advantages and<br />
" States' rights" interests ahead of the national<br />
interest, when western Australians enjoy the benefits of<br />
Commonwealth legislation as Australians.<br />
As Premier of Western Australia, Mr Court has a<br />
responsibility to participate in a national syctom to<br />
deal with this national issue in a manner that is<br />
sensible and just. That is what the Commonwealth<br />
legislation does.<br />
The Commonwealth Government is currently holding<br />
constructive discussions with other States in regard to<br />
cost-sharing and implementation of the national system to<br />
identify and grant native title rights. The way remains<br />
open for M4r Court to change his attitude and participate<br />
in these discussions.<br />
