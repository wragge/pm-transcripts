SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
RETURN BANQUET<br />
BEIJING 20 MAY 1986<br />
PREMIER ZHAO, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN<br />
TONIGHT IS MY OCCASION TO SAY THANK YOU, AT THE END OF<br />
OUR STAY IN BEIJING IT IS MY GREAT HONOUR TO RETURN<br />
HOSPITALITY TO MY HOST, PREMIER ZHAO ZIYANG, OUR STAY<br />
HERE, THOUGH SHORT, HAS BEEN VERY BUSY AND PRODUCTIVE,<br />
THAT IT HAS BEEN SO IS THANKS TO THE GENEROSITY OF<br />
PREMIER ZHAO AND HIS COLLEAGUES,<br />
! N THE TWO YEARS SINCE I WAS LAST IN BEIJING, THE<br />
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CHINA AND AUSTRALIA HAS DEEPENED AND<br />
DIVERSIFIED, AS I MENTIONED IN MY SPEECH TO THE THIRD<br />
CHINA-AUSTRALIA SENIOR EXECUTIVE FORUM THIS MORNING THE<br />
DEVELOPMENT OF AN EFFECTIVE BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP IS NOT<br />
SIMPLE OR EASY, I'M GLAD TO FEEL THAT OUR BUSINESS<br />
RELATIONSHIP IS NOW SO FIRMLY UNDERPINNEDBY THE EXCELLENT<br />
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENTS OF AUSTRALIA AND CHINA,<br />
BY THE EXCELLENT RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN OUR LEADERS, AND THE<br />
WARM EXPANDING RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN OUR PEOPLES, </p>
<p>2.<br />
PREMIER ZHAO AND I HAVE MET AND TALKED TOGETHER THREE<br />
TIMES IN THE LAST THREE YEARS, TWICE HERE IN CHINA.<br />
GENERAL SECRETARY Hu YAOBANG PAID A VERY SUCCESSFUL VISIT<br />
To AUSTRALIA ' LAST YEAR. AND THIS MORNING, I HAD THE GREAT<br />
PLEASURE AND PRIVILEGE OF MEETING CHAIRMAN DENG XIAOPING<br />
FOR THE FIRST TIME AND HEARING AT FIRST HAND HIS CONCEPTION<br />
OF CHINA'S DEVELOPMENT INTO THE NEXT CENTURY.<br />
OUR DIALOGUE HAS REVEALED THAT ON THE GREAT MAJORITY OF<br />
ISSUES OF FUNDAMENTAL IMPORTANCE IN INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS<br />
WE SHARE VERY SIMILAR VIEWS. IWANT TO DEPART, MR PREMIER,<br />
FOR A MOMENT FROM THE TEXT WHICH HAS BEEN DISTRIBUTED TO<br />
REFER TO THE ATTACKS BY SOUTH AFRICAN MILITARY FORCES ON<br />
INDEPENDENTj SOVEREIGN COUNTRIES ON SOUTH AFRICA'S BORDERS.<br />
THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT CONDEMNS IN THE STRONGEST POSSIBLE<br />
TERMS THESE INCURSIONS INTO ZIMBABWE, ZAMBIA AND BOTSWANA.<br />
SOUTH AFRICA'S ACTIONS ARE AN OUTRAGEOUS AFFRONT TO THE<br />
NORMS OF CIVILISED BEHAVIOUR WHICH ARE FUNDAMENTAL TO ANY<br />
DECENT SOCIETY AND THEY ARE TOTALLY.-UNACCEPTABLE TO THE<br />
AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT, AS I AM SURE THEY ARE TO CHINA.<br />
MR PREMIER, BEHIND THE FRIENDLY LINKS BETWEEN OUR POLITICAL<br />
LEADERS THERE ARE THE DAY TO DAY BUSINESS RELATIONSHIPS<br />
BETWEEN OUR TWO COUNTRIES, SINCE I HAVE BEEN HERE I HAVE<br />
BEEN ABLE TO EXCHANGE VIEWS WITH A NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO ARE<br />
INTIMATELY INVOLVED IN FURTHERING TRADING AND OTHER<br />
RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN OUR ENTERPRISES. </p>
<p>THERE ARE NOW MANY AUSTRALIANS DOING BUSINESS WITH CHINA<br />
OR IN PARTNERSHIP WITH CHINA. I WAS, FOR EXAMPLE, VERY<br />
GLAD TO WITNESS TODAY THE SIGNING OF THE AGREEMENT WHICH<br />
IS ANOTHER STEP TOWARDS FULFILLING CHINA'S INTENTION TO<br />
MAKE ITS LARGEST INVESTMENT IN AUSTRALIA THROUGH A $ US100<br />
MILLION SHARE OF THE PORTLAND ALUMINIUM SMELTER,<br />
ESTABLISHING FIRM RELATIONSHIPS ON THE BASIS OF MUTUAL<br />
BENEFIT IS AN AIM WE SHARE, I HAVE BEEN STRUCK BY THE<br />
CLARITY WITH WHICH PREMIER ZHAO AND OTHERS IN THE LEADERSHIP<br />
HAVE ARTICULATED THE ARGUMENT THAT RELATIONSHIPS ESTABLISHED<br />
ON THE BASIS OF MUTUAL BENEFIT AND INDEPENDENCE PROMOTE THE<br />
CAUSE OF PEACE.<br />
IAM INTERESTED TO COMPARE AUSTRALIA AND CHINA AS WE BOTH<br />
MOVE TO ESTABLISH FULLER RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE REST OF THE<br />
WORLD. CHINA LONG SAW ITSELF AS NEEDING TO KEEP ITS DOORS<br />
. CLOSED TO THE OUTSIDE WORLD. IHAVE BEEN DEEPLY IMPRESSED<br />
BY HOW FAR THIS TRADITIONAL ATTITUDE HAS BEEN MODIFIED TO<br />
REFLECT CHINA'S NEW POLICY OF OPENNESS TO THE WHOLE WORLD$<br />
AUSTRALIA IS AN ISLAND STATE SURROUNDED BY SEA. FOR THE<br />
EARLIER PART OF OUR HISTORY AUSTRALIANS WERE INCLINED TO<br />
FEAR THE WORLD AROUND US AND TO SEEK TO CLOSE OURSELVES<br />
FROM IT. IN THE LAST 40 YEARS OR SO WE HAVE COME TO<br />
INVOLVE OURSELVES MORE AND MORE IN WORLD AFFAIRS AND HAVE<br />
BECOME A NEW HOME FOR PEOPLE FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD, </p>
<p>TODAY WE CAN CLAIM THAT THROUGH OUR GROWING PARTNERSHIP<br />
IN THE WESTERN PACIFIC REGION, AUSTRALIA AND CHINA BRING<br />
TOGETHER THE STRENGTHS OF CIVILISATIONS DRAWING FROM EAST<br />
AND WEST.<br />
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, I PROPOSE A TOAST TO THE HEALTH OF<br />
HIS EXCELLENCY PREMIER ZHAO ZIYANG AND TO THE HEALTH OF<br />
ALL DISTINGUISHED CHINESE AND AUSTRALIAN GUESTS HERE<br />
TONIGHT. GAN BEI! </p>
