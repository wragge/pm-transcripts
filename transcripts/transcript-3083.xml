SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
MR. E. G. WHITLAM, QC, M. P,<br />
TO OPEN THE INAUGURAL MEETING OF<br />
THE NORTHERN DEVELOPMENT COUNCIL,<br />
CANBERRA, P0; 4DAY 26 N0VEMBER 1973<br />
THIS MEETING HAS ASSEMBLED TO GIVE PRACTICAL<br />
EXPRESSION TO OUR HOPES WHATEVER GOVERNMENT WE REPRESENT,<br />
WHATEVER PARTY WE REPRESENT THAT THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE<br />
NORTHERN REGIONS OF AUSTRALIA WILL GO FORWARD WITH SPEED,<br />
WITH CERTAINTY, AND WITH GREAT BENEFITS FOR THE PEOPLE<br />
OF THE NORTH AND ALL AUSTRALIANS.<br />
THIS IS BY NO MEANS THE FIRST MEETING THIS YEAR<br />
BETWEEN THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT AND CERTAIN STATE<br />
GOVFRNMENTS 10 EXAMINE ISSUES OF GREAT IMPORTANCE TO<br />
PARTICULAR REGIONS. THERE HAVE BEEN TALKS BETWEEN THE<br />
AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT AND THE VICTORIAN AND EW SOUTH<br />
WALES GOVERNMENTS CONCERNING ALBURY-WODONGA, AND WITH<br />
THE VICTORIAN, NEW SOUTH WALES AND SOUTH AUSTRALIAN<br />
GOVERNMENTS CONCERNING THE MURRAY WATERAGREEMENT.<br />
THOSE MEETINGS REACHED HIGHLY SATISFACTORY CONCLUSIONS.<br />
I HAVE HIGH HOPES THAT THIS MEETING WILL DO LIKEWISE. ,/ 2 </p>
<p>-2<br />
IT MAY BE THAT SMALLER CONFERENCES SUCH AS THISMORE<br />
INTIMATE, MORE MANAGEABLE, MORE PURPOSEFUL<br />
PERHAPS CAN PRODUCE QUICKER AND MORE SATISFACTORY<br />
RESULTS THAN FULL-SCALE PREMIERS' CONFERENCES. IN<br />
ANY CASE, I WELCOME MR. BJELKE-P-ETERSEN AND<br />
fIR. 3IKRO. I AM GRATEFUL FOR THEIR ATTENDANCE<br />
AT THIS INAUGURAL MEETING. IVENTURE TO SUGGEST THAT<br />
THEY MAY DERIVE SOME REASSURANCE FROM THE FACT H<br />
C o%-ib~ kL<br />
AT ANY MEETING HELD HERE, IN THIS SENATE CHrtf= FTH<br />
THE RIGHTS AND INTERESTS OF<br />
THE STATES WILL BE AMPLY PROTECTED.<br />
FOR AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL GOVERNMENTS IN THE PAST,<br />
NORTHERN DEVELOPMENT HAS ALWAYS BEEN A SOMEWHAT REMOTE<br />
AND PERIPHERAL CONCERN. FOR A GOVERNMENT IN CANBERRA,<br />
" THE IqORTH i MEANT ONLY A FRACTION OF THE AREA OVER<br />
WHICH ITS RESPONSIBILITY RAN; FOR A GOVERNMENT IN<br />
PERTH IT MEANT PERHAPS HALF ITS AREA OF RESPONSIBILITY;<br />
FOR A GOVERNMENT IN BRISBANE OR AN ADMINISTRATION IN<br />
DARWIN, IT MEANT NEARLY* ALL OF IT. SO I AM CONSCIOUS<br />
OF THE FACT THAT THE GOVERNMENTS OF QUEENSLAND AND<br />
ESTERN AUSTRALIA, AS WELL AS HAVING A GREATER NATURAL<br />
INTEREST IN THESE REGIONS, HAVE AN ADVANTAGE OVER US IN<br />
CANBERRA BY VIRTUE OF THEIR KNOWLEDGE OF LOCAL CONDITIONS<br />
AND THEIR LONGER EXPERIENCE IN ADMINISTERING THE REMOTE<br />
AREAS OF THiEIR STATES. a a 3 </p>
<p>-3-<br />
N" OTHING I SAY TODAY, AND NOTHING WE ENVISAGE<br />
THIS NEW COUNCIL DOING, SHOULD BE TAKEN AS A CRITICISM<br />
OF THE EFFORTS OF THE STATE GOVERNMENTS AND NORTHERN<br />
TERRITORY ADMINISTRATIONS IN DEVELOPING THE NORTH.<br />
THEY HAVE DONE A GREAT DEAL. IT IS MY INTENTION,<br />
HOWEVER, TO SEE THAT THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT, IN<br />
CO-OPERATION WITH THE STATES, PLAYS ITS FULL PART<br />
IN THESE ENDEAVOURS, AND THAT THE PEOPLE OF THE<br />
NORTH HAVE THE SAME OPPORTUNITIES FOR A FULL AND<br />
PROSPEROUS LIFE AS ALL OTHER AUSTRALIANS.. THERE<br />
WILL BE NO MORE SECOND-CLASS CITIZENS; THERE WILL<br />
BE NO MORE SECOND-CLASS REGIONS.<br />
I THINK I CAN CLAIM THAT my GOVERNMENT, MORE<br />
THAN ANY OTHER IN THE HISTORY OF FEDERAL POLITICS,<br />
IS COMMITTED TO THE TASK AND THE CHALLENGE OF<br />
NORTHERN DEVELOPMENT. THAT COMMITMENT WAS EXPRESSED<br />
IN MY POLICY SPEECH A YEAR AGO. IT WAS REFLECTED IN<br />
THE DECISION ONE OF THE FIRST ADMINISTRATIVE ACTS<br />
OF THE NEW GOVERNMENT TO ESTABLISH THE DEPARTMENT<br />
OF NORTHERN DEVELOPMENT, WHICH IS RESPONSIBLE FOR<br />
CO-ORDINATING DEVELOPMENT IN THE AREA OF AUSTRALIA<br />
NORTH OF THE 26TH PARALLEL. WiE BELIEVE THAT THIS<br />
REGION RICH AS IT IS IN NATURAL RESOURCES AND<br />
PASTORAL AND AGRICULTURAL POTENTIAL SHOULD RECEIVE<br />
A RECOGNITION FROM THE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT COMMENSURATE<br />
WITH ITS CONTRIBUTION TO THE NATIONAL ECONOMY. IN ANY<br />
ANALYSIS, THE NORTH CONTRIBUTES AS MUCH AS ANY OTHER<br />
SECTOR OF AUSTRALIA TO OUR EARNINGS AND OUR STANDARD<br />
OF LIVING. s s. </p>
<p>-4-<br />
THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT HAS ALWAYS RECOGNISED<br />
THE PROBLEMS AND DIFFICULTIES OF DEVELOPING THE NORTH<br />
THE HIGHER COSTS OF PROJECTS IN REMOTE AND DIFFICULT<br />
ENVIRONMENTS, THE NEED FOR SPECIAL WAGE AND OTHER<br />
INCENTIVES TO ATTRACT WORKERS, THE HIGHER COST OF<br />
HOUSING AND TRANSPORT, CAPITAL EQUIPMENT, BUILDINGS,<br />
POWER, AND FERTILISERS THESE FACTORS, AND OUR<br />
HISTORICAL PATTERN OF DEVELOPMENT, HAVE PUT SOUTHERN<br />
AUSTRALIA IN A POSITION OF GREAT COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE<br />
OVER THE NORTH, THE ACHIEVEMENTS OF THE PAST DECADE<br />
ALONE, HOWEVER, HAVE CLEARLY SHOWN US THE REAL POSSIBILITIES<br />
OF NORTHERN AUSTRALIA, THE MORE WE TAKE HOLD OF THESE<br />
OPPORTUNITIES AND ENLARGE THE RANGE OF LIFE STYLES<br />
OPEN TO ALL AUSTRALIANS, THE MORE WE ENRICH OUR NATIONAL<br />
CULTURE, AUSTRALIA'S SENSE OF NATIONHOOD WILL NEVER BE<br />
FULLY REALISED WHILE OUR POLICIES AND PRE-OCCUPATIONS<br />
REMAIN LARGELY CONFINED TO A TRIANGLE IN THE SOUTH-EAST<br />
OF THE CONTINENT FROM BRISBANE TO ADELAIDE AND ANOTHER<br />
IN THE SOUTH-WEST FROM PERTH TO ALBANY,<br />
IN MY POLICY SPEECH A YEAR AGO I SAID THIS<br />
" LABOR'S OBJECTIVE IS TO DEVELOP THE VAST AND VALUABLE<br />
RESOURCES OF NORTHERN AUSTRALIA FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE<br />
AUSTRALIAN NATION AND FUTURE AUSTRALIANS IT IS IN<br />
THE NORTH THAT THE GREAT SUGAR AND CATTLE INDUSTRIES HAVE<br />
BEEN ESTABLISHED AND IT IS IN THE NORTH THAT AUSTRALIANS<br />
FACE THE GREATEST CHALLENGE TO RETAIN THE OWNERSHIP OF<br />
THE NATION'S RESOURCES AND TO BASE NEW INDUSTRIES ON<br />
THOSE RESOURCES," </p>
<p>i--<br />
THE PURPOSE OF THIS COUNCIL IS TO DEVELOP MEASURES<br />
DESIGNED TO PROMOTE THE DEVELOPMENT OF NORTHERN AUSTRALIA<br />
AND THE WELFARE OF ITS PEOPLE, IT WILL INITIATE WHATEVER<br />
STUDIES AND INVESTIGATIONS IT CONSIDERS NECESSARY TO<br />
ACHIEVE THESE OBJECTIVES, THIS IS A COMPREHENSIVE MANDATE,<br />
I GIVE AN ASSURANCE THAT IF THE POLICIES YOU AGREE UPON<br />
REQUIRE SPECIAL FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE, THE AUSTRALIAN<br />
GOVERNMENT WILL SYMPATHETICALLY EXAMINE SUCH PROPOSALS<br />
IN CO-OPERATION WITH THE STATES,<br />
' IY GOVERNMENT'S BROAD NATIONAL OBJECTIVES ARE NOW<br />
GENERALLY WELL KNOWN, THEY APPLY EQUALLY TO THE NORTH,<br />
VIE WANT STRONG AND CONTINUING ECONOMIC GROWTH IN THE<br />
NORTH AS WELL AS THE SOUTH, OUR ECONOMIC PLANNING IS<br />
DESIGNED TO ACHIEVE GREATER AUSTRALIAN OWNERSHIP AND<br />
PARTICIPATION IN INDUSTRY, MAXIMUM PROCESSING OF OUR<br />
RESOURCES AND FAIR EXPORT PRICES, AT ALL TIMES DUE<br />
ACCOUNT WILL BE TAKEN OF THE NEEDS OF CONSERVATION,<br />
ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS AND ABORIGINAL RIGHTS, I BELIEVE<br />
THAT THESE OBJECTIVES REFLECT THE FEELINGS AND ASPIRATIONS<br />
OF MOST AUSTRALIANS, I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT THE PURSUIT OF<br />
THESE OBJECTIVES WILL CREATE UNDUE DIFFICULTIES FOR OUR<br />
INDUSTRIES, INCLUDING THE MINING INDUSTRY, IT WILL,<br />
HOWEVER, REQUIRE CO-OPERATION BETWEEN GOVERNMENT AND<br />
INDUSTRY IN THE PLANNING AND EXECUTION OF MAJOR<br />
DEVELOPMENTAL PROJECTS, </p>
<p>6-<br />
THERE IS AN URGENT NEED FOR SUCH CO-OPERATION AND<br />
PLANNING. DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS IN THE PAST NEW TOWNSHIPS,<br />
RAILWAYS AND PORTS, PARTICULARLY IN THE NORTH FREQUENTLY<br />
WENT AHEAD WITHOUT REGARD FOR OVERALL NATIONAL POLICY OR NEEDS.<br />
WIE MUST ENSURE THAT FUTURE DEVELOPMENT IS GUIDED BY NATIONAL<br />
AS WELL AS LOCAL CONSIDERATIONS. SUCH NATIONAL CONSIDERATIONS<br />
ARE BEHIND THE IMAGINATIVE PILBARA DEVELOPMENT CONCEPT<br />
WHICH IS NOW THE SUBJECT OF JOINT DISCUSSIONS BETWEEN<br />
THE AUSTRALIAN AND WESTERN AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENTS, WE<br />
WANT THE DEVELOPMENT OF A NEW REGIONAL CENTRE, WITH CHEAP<br />
POWER, CO-ORDINATED TRANSPORT AND PORT FAC-ILITIES, TO BE<br />
PLANNED IN A WAY THAT WILL PERMIT THE BALANCED DEVELOPMENT<br />
OF THE RESOURCES IN THE REGION TO THE MUTUAL ADVANTAGE OF<br />
WESTERN AUSTRALIA, THE NATION AND THE PARTICIPATING<br />
COMMERICAL INTERESTS, MUCH THE SAME THINKING IFS BFHIND<br />
my GOVERNMENT'S INITIATIVE IN PROVIDING FtJND. S FOR A<br />
COMPREHENJSIVE LEVALUIOr OF THE RESOURCES OF THiL<br />
BURDEKIN AND BOWEN B3ASINS IN QUEENSLAND.<br />
IEMPHASISE THAT THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT IS NOT<br />
PREPARED TO ALLOW THE TEMPO AND DETAIL OF NORTHERN<br />
DEVELOPMENT TO BE DETERMINED B3Y MARKET FORCES ALONE.<br />
IF WE WERE TO DO SO, WE WOULD PFRPETUATE THE CONDITIOS<br />
WHICH HAVE CHARACTER ISED OUR NATPNTAL [ DEVELOPMENT OVER<br />
THE PAST GENERATION. HISTORY MAY WELL JUDGE OUR GENERATION<br />
HARSHLY WHEN IT IS RECALLED THAT OF OUR TOTAL<br />
POPULATION INCREASE OF NEARLY 5 MILLION PEOPLE SINCE 1949<br />
HAS OCCURRED IN THE CAPITAL CITIES, AND OVER 50% HAVE<br />
SETTLED IN SYDNEY AND MELBOURNE ALONE. ' e o/ 1 </p>
<p>-7-<br />
I AM NOT CONCERNED TODAY TO DISCUSS THE GROWING PROBLEMS<br />
OF OUR CITIES. THE GOVERNMENT HAS ALREADY TAKEN CERTAIN<br />
STEPS TO ALLEVIATE THE MORE PRESSING OF THESE PROBLEMS.<br />
IT WOULD, HOWEVER, BE WHOLLY CONSISTENT WITH OUR<br />
POLICIES OF URBAN RENEWAL AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW<br />
GROWTH CENTRES IF THE TEMPO OF NORTHERN DEVELOPMENT<br />
WERE INCREASED, AND GREATER INCENTIVES WERE PROVIDED<br />
FOR MORE AND MORE PEOPLE TO MOVE TO THE SPARSELY<br />
POPULATED NORTHERN REGIONS OF AUSTRALIA.<br />
THE PURPOSE OF THIS INAUGURAL MEETING IS TO CONSIDER<br />
THE PROCEDURES AND ARRANGEMENTS TO BE FOLLOWED BY THE<br />
COUNCIL IN FUTURE. I HOPE THE COUNCIL WILL MEET<br />
REGULARLY AT LEAST TWICE A YEAR IN ORDER TO AVOID<br />
THE AD HOC APPROACH TO NORTHERN DEVELOPMENT IN THE PAST.<br />
MY GOVERNMENT AND I WOULD EXPECT FUTURE AUSTRALIAN<br />
GOVERNMENTS WILL LOOK INCREASINGLY TO THIS COUNCIL<br />
FOR SOUND ADVICE ON THE DEVELOPMENTAL NEEDS OF THE<br />
NORTH. WE KNOW OF THE RESOURCES AND THE DIFFICULTIES<br />
WELL ENOUGH. '.' IHAT ALL OUR GOVERNMENTS NEED IS DETAILED<br />
AND EXPERT ADVICE ON HOW TO DEVELOP THOSE RESOURCES AND<br />
OVERCOME THOSE DIFFICULTIES. THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THIS<br />
COUNCIL MARKS A NEW PHASE IN FEDERAL-STATE RELATIONS IN<br />
A PARTICULARLY DIFFICULT AREA OF UNDOUBTED NATIONAL<br />
IMPORTANCE. I AM CONFIDENT THAT THIS COUNCIL WILL BRING<br />
NEW VIGOUR AND NEW IDEAS TO OUR POLICIES FOR NORTHERN<br />
DEVELOPMENT AND MAKE A MOST SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTION TO THE<br />
PROGRESS OF OUR NATION AND THE LIVING STANDARDS OF ITS<br />
PEOPLE. </p>
