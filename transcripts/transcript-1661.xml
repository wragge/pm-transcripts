FOR PRESS* AUSTRALIAN LOAN-IN LONDON<br />
Statement by the Prime Minlister and Chairman<br />
of the Australian Loan Council? Mr-Harold Holt~<br />
A new Australian cash loan is to be issued in London<br />
next week. This will be the first Australian loan issued on<br />
the London market since October 1963.<br />
The new loan will be for an amount of œ CStg 14 million<br />
35 million) and will have an interest coupon of 7 per cent.<br />
The loan will finally mature in September 1981 and will have an<br />
issue price of 99, offering the investor a yield of 7.11 per cent.<br />
While this will be the highest yield ever offered in a<br />
Commonwealth loan raised overseas, underwriting and other charges<br />
are considerably lower in London than in other oversea capital<br />
markets. From the point of view of the borrower, this offsets<br />
to a large extent the difference between the interest coupon<br />
now being offered by major borrowers in London and the slightly<br />
lower interest coupons which are possible in other markets.<br />
The approval of the British authorities was originally<br />
obtained for a conversion loan of œ-Stg 14+ million to refinance<br />
State Government maturities of œ Stg 14+. 6 million 36.6 million)<br />
which fell due on 1 July 1967, but the market conditions at the<br />
time made this impracticable. The new cash loan is in effect a<br />
deferred refinancing operation for the securities which were<br />
repaid on maturity on 1 July. Funds for this purpose were<br />
provided partly from the National Debt Sinking Fund and partly<br />
from a special internal loan subscribed to by the Commonwealth<br />
on 1 July out of the cash balances of the Loan Consolidation and<br />
Investment Reserve. </p>
<p>In accordance with the undertaking given to the<br />
States last year to arrange for the refinancing of their<br />
oversea maturities at Australian rates of interest until<br />
June 1969, the new loan will be issued in the name of the<br />
Commonwealth. Since October 1963, four Australian loans totalling<br />
œ Stg 59 million have been paid off in London on reaching<br />
their final maturity dates. After allowing for market<br />
purchases by the National Debt Sinking Fund, Australian<br />
debt in London has been reduced by approximately œ Stg<br />
million 200 million) since July 1964. A further œ Stg 100<br />
million 250 million) Australian securities mature in<br />
London before the end of 1972, mostly resulting initially<br />
from State Government loans raised 20 or more years ago.<br />
It is against this background that the Commonwealth<br />
has decided, with the approval of the Loan Council, to re-enter<br />
the London market on this occasion after a break of four years.<br />
oOo<br />
NOTE: During the absence of the Treasurer ( Mr. McMahon)<br />
overseas, Mr. Holt is Chairman of the Australian<br />
Loan Council. This follows normal procedures<br />
adopted when the Treasurer, whom the Prime Minister<br />
customarily nominates as Chairman, is overseas.<br />
