QKi-PRIME MINISTER 16/ 92<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING, MP<br />
The Commonwealth Government's offer to fund half the costs<br />
of a feasibility study for the Bell Bay Steel Mill stands.<br />
There has never been any doubt about the willingness of the<br />
Commonwealth to allocate $ 500,000 to fund the study.<br />
It is uncertain whether Premier elect Groom is committed to<br />
the project. As late as this morning, in the Launceston<br />
Examiner, it was unclear whether Mr Groom was committed to<br />
State Government funding.<br />
Mr Groom should make it clear that his Government is<br />
committed to funding the study and put the interests of<br />
Tasmania ahead of attempts at political point scoring.<br />
All Mr Groom has to do is to indicate his unequivocal<br />
commitment to his Government funding its share of the study.<br />
