TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P. J. KEATING MP<br />
DOORSTOP, PARLIAMENT HOUSE, CANBERRA, 27 FEBRUARY 1994<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF ONLY<br />
PM: Last Thursday evening and Friday while I was at the Council of<br />
Australian Governments meeting trying to open up competitive breezes<br />
for the first time ever in Australia's great government trading<br />
enterprises and in unincorporated business and see further reforms on<br />
water and electricity, the federal Opposition frontbench were briefing<br />
the press about how they have given up the business of policies in<br />
politics and they are going to take up the business of dirt and smear in<br />
our public life. They ranked the Kelly sports matter, which is a dispute<br />
about policy delivery as their only success in recent years and in an<br />
article in The Australian they say that if one notes the success the<br />
Coalition has had in recent years in Victoria, in South Australia, in<br />
Western Australia and the Labor government's success in Queensland<br />
it was basically out of issues connected with smears, corruption and<br />
dirt. In fact they go on to say that " it has not been policy that has won<br />
and lost office in Australia in recent times, but stench" and go on to say<br />
these things that the shift in the Coalition will be most evident next<br />
week when the focus of its attack in the House of Representatives<br />
shifts from pork barrel to pork politics. They particularly want to<br />
through mud at Paul Keating. The accusations as far as we can gather<br />
will not be of corruption by Keating, the aim is simpler to ignite the<br />
politics of envy". They go on to say that " for the first time in almost a<br />
decade the Coalition is planning quite coldly to play the man in a<br />
desperate attempt to shake the Labor Party out of office federally". It<br />
goes on to say " this week the final stage of the Coalition's rejection of<br />
John Hewson's authority over it, he's stated preference for playing the<br />
game and not the man has been brutally overturned by the party's hard<br />
heads and leadership pretenders." It says the parliamentary<br />
geriatrics Andrew Peacock, Ian Sinclair, John Howard this is the<br />
group who believe they can now start to destroy Keating and his<br />
government with a new attack. This is why the prize of a win in the<br />
new dirty politics will be much more important than anything to do with<br />
odour from a piggery. For Hewson this turn of events is a new<br />
disaster". </p>
<p>These people can I say, Ian Sinclair, none of you could remember one<br />
major contribution from him in public life over twenty odd years and<br />
you can pretty well ditto that for both Peacock and Howard though they<br />
led a Coalition in terms of policy change we saw from them, basically,<br />
next to nothing.<br />
The issue is this, that the Coalition, and at the same time as all this<br />
Malcolm Fraser has Malcolm Fraser on the Party in despair So<br />
this is a party without policies, who have had five election losses in a<br />
row, they say that I helped to defeat their leaders Peacock, Howard,<br />
Peacock and now Hewson and they'll seek to tear me down, but I<br />
beat them on politics and policies and not on their personal life. In an<br />
attempt now to break the unwritten rule of Australian politics and that<br />
is, that parties win on policies and policies and party leaders and<br />
ministers are attacked on policies and policies, they want to change<br />
the basis of our national politics away from these things while great<br />
policy changes are afoot to go back to personal attacks.<br />
John Hewson knows what having your personal life exposed means<br />
and he knows that neither I nor any member of the Labor party took up<br />
one element of that two years ago. Not one bit. It was left where it<br />
ought to be left as his personal affairs.<br />
I have had now twenty months of questioning in the Senate, of claims<br />
and accusations against me at the hands of the Liberal party through<br />
Senator Baume, Boswell and others, all of which have been completely<br />
fallacious and as you know have gone absolutely nowhere because my<br />
personal investments and my life have nothing to do with my<br />
administration of the Commonwealth and yet despite this how does this<br />
compare with John Hewson acknowledging the fact that as a shadow<br />
minister he took consultancies from a financial institution, that John<br />
Howard to this day brazenly says that he is taking a consultancy from<br />
Clayton Utz the major legal firm and the question is: Where does<br />
now Dr Hewson stand on this tactic? Is it a fact that he has been as<br />
Ms Tingle says in her piece rolled by the Coalition." The final stage<br />
of the Coalition's rejection of John Hewson's authority of it, his stated<br />
preference, that the week and the tactics was a new disaster for him,<br />
where does he stand on this? Does he believe that low personal<br />
gutter politics ought to be substituted for real policy? Is that where the<br />
Liberal party is after five election defeats? Are the has-beens of the<br />
Liberal party Howard, Peacock and Sinclair going to come back and<br />
wreck it again when it has a chance to rebuild itself? And I want the<br />
Australian public to know who fired, if they want to fire these shots,<br />
who fired the first shot? Who fired the first shot in breaking the<br />
unwritten rule of Australian public life that it is policies that matter not<br />
the personal affairs and lives of MPs or Ministers and it will not be the<br />
ALP that fires this first shot because we believe there is enough<br />
differentiation out there in policy without this sort of nonsense. </p>
<p>For my part, if the Coalition want to move along this tactic that's fine.<br />
This is a very strongly written piece, it has been sourced obviously<br />
from the Opposition frontbench, we have heard rumours of this now<br />
floating around the Press Gallery and the business community for<br />
weeks and let's get it into the open. Let's say that if the Liberal party<br />
after five election defeats wants to now turn its back from policy, turn<br />
away from the game and hop onto the man playing the man and not<br />
the ball of rejecting John Hewson's view that that's the way public life<br />
in Australia should operate, that gives the Liberal party a chance to do<br />
as Malcolm Fraser suggests find a new basis for itself in Australian<br />
public life. Let it make clear that it's the one who has decided on this<br />
path and let it make clear that we, and no matter what they think,<br />
whatever political success they might think they've had in trying to<br />
belittle Mrs Kelly with the sports program administration, that is in<br />
essence a policy matter over sport. This is an entirely different matter<br />
and I'm just giving the Liberal party a chance to make clear what its<br />
policy stance is and to let the country know that in this day and age<br />
with great change afoot as we saw on Friday, vast co-operations now<br />
between the Commonwealth and the states; a recovery on our hands;<br />
the government now attending to long term unemployment; that the<br />
best the Coalition can do is run around making fallacious claims about<br />
nothing which in my case has nothing whatsoever to do with my<br />
ministerial duties.<br />
J: Mr Keating, last time Ian McLachlan raised the question of your<br />
piggery in Parliament, you also raised questions about his residence<br />
and his pecuniary interest what's that if not playing the man?<br />
PM: That was in response, but I have never raised in a frontal, personal<br />
way over twenty five years in public life the personal affairs of any of<br />
these people. I have never made any reference to Mr McLachlan's<br />
assets before he made a reference to mine. Last year I had Dr<br />
Hewson and Mr Reith who put Mr Peacock up to a question about the<br />
lateness of a return of a company I had with the Australian Securities<br />
Commission and I in response said yes, and your two companies are<br />
late by two and three months. I have only referred to their matters in<br />
response to them attacking me. I have never taken this matter on, this<br />
sort of stuff on. What we have here is the old guard. This is the crowd<br />
who not only did nothing in the 1960s and 1970s, but essentially<br />
robbed the Liberal party of its victories in the 1980s. Coming back, I<br />
mean, when you see them on the front bench, for me it is like a trip<br />
down the time tunnel to twenty years ago, to see this group who took<br />
the country and the Liberal party and the Coalition nowhere<br />
surrounded by a group of backbenchers who just don't know what they<br />
are doing. And the few in the Coalition who have some idea of policy,<br />
not being able to get a toe hold whether that's Hewson or Wooldridge<br />
or who ever. </p>
<p>J: If they pursue this strategy, are you going to hit back?<br />
PM: We'll see what they will do, but if there is to be any middle class<br />
moralising going on in the editorials of this country and there is plenty<br />
of it, let them contemplate this kind of change to our public life and let<br />
them understand that what these old guard renegade group are up to<br />
is not the politics and the policies of the new Australia, but basically<br />
the old smear rubbish that they think brought down a series of<br />
Coalition state governments. What brought down a series of Coalition<br />
state governments and Labor governments was basically financial<br />
mismanagement of financial institutions. In the case of the National<br />
Party in Queensland, proved corruption. In Western Australia, the<br />
Western Australian Inc matter, but these went to Ministers'<br />
management of their portfolios. This is entirely a different matter.<br />
J: What's it going to mean for the week in Parliament Prime Minister. Are<br />
we going to see a repeat of last Thursday?<br />
PM: I think you have got to say to Dr Hewson does he support these sorts<br />
of tactics? Is this background briefing so strongly given to The<br />
Australian an indication of the frontbench policies; was he rolled last<br />
week; was the tactics of taking on censure motions and uproar in<br />
Parliament all part of that sort of thing or does he believe as he's<br />
always said he has, that politics is about playing the issues and not the<br />
man. For my party, I have been around here a long time and I can<br />
look after myself, that you don't need an assurance. But it is up to the<br />
Liberal Party to say whether the useless, old guard is going to take<br />
charge again of its parliamentary politics.<br />
J: Do you accept no blame for what happened last Thursday?<br />
PM: Look, I'm not here to debate last Thursday. Last Thursday was a<br />
different matter around different issues.<br />
J: Are you saying you have no option but to respond in kind if those are<br />
the tactics that are embarked on?<br />
PM: I'm not saying anything like that. Let me just tell you this that for<br />
twenty months, not two months, I've had Senator Baume, Boswell,<br />
O'Chee and others up making a set of charges. All it came to'nothing.<br />
One, that I changed the foreign investment policies in the ' One Nation'<br />
Statement to advantage myself completely fallacious and was proven<br />
to be so. Second, that I connived with AQIS to bring in pigs from<br />
Denmark totally debunked by the AQIS people before a Senate<br />
committee. The third was that I introduced accelerated depreciation<br />
policies in the ' One Nation' package to avail myself of them which I<br />
didn't do. Every single claim has fallen to the ground because it is just<br />
basically dirt and rubbish. </p>
<p>J: How do you see the attack on Mrs Kelly fitting in with these new tactics<br />
of the Opposition. What is your view on Mrs Kelly's position now?<br />
PM: Whatever I think about the strength of Mrs Kelly's position in terms of<br />
the administration of the sports program, which is a discretionary<br />
program for grants to minor amateur sporting organisations, whatever<br />
claims are made about this, it is a pursuit of the administration of a<br />
federal program. I am just trying the make the point again. This is an<br />
entirely different matter to the personal life of ministers.<br />
J: So you still stand by Mrs Kelly as you have so far?<br />
PM: I said yesterday, I don't think I can add to what I said yesterday, that<br />
the Opposition are all about process and in this respect so too is the<br />
government and we established a House of Representatives<br />
committee to look at all of the aspects which none of the rest of us on<br />
the front bench are able to do in such a comprehensive way, not being<br />
able to give it that sort of time and attention. That report is coming<br />
down this week and, obviously, I will be waiting to read that report.<br />
J: You said you would see Mrs Kelly tomorrow, why is that?<br />
PM: I didn't say that at all.<br />
J: I thought you said that yesterday.<br />
PM: I mean I see colleague ministers virtually everyday of the week.<br />
J: There's a report today saying that she's going to be asked to resign...<br />
PM: Well, I'm not responding to reports, I mean that's about all I can say.<br />
She deserves at least I mean all these people that believe in process.<br />
There has been a House of Representatives committee, and it is going<br />
to report, so I think decency demands that we wait till the report. We'll<br />
see what they say.<br />
J: You're talking about the Opposition's Parliamentary tactics. Stephen<br />
Martin said today he wanted to push for an independent speaker, and<br />
John Howard said that perhaps it's time to consider the British<br />
system...<br />
PM: Look, all this stuff about unctuous indignation by John Howard about<br />
speakers and the roles of speakers. I remember the times here when<br />
the Opposition would suspend question time to censure people like<br />
Jim Cairns, run the debate through the evening, make people sit all<br />
through the night and walk out in broad daylight, suspend the next<br />
day's question time and keep going. I mean don't you believe even<br />
with Coalition speakers it's been anything other than thus on the part<br />
of a Coalition with a majority to kick the hell out of the then Opposition </p>
<p>6<br />
whenever it had a chance. Today politics is nothing like it was. It's a<br />
relatively, I'm afraid for the rest of you, more genteel matter than what<br />
it was 20 years ago.<br />
J: Any comment on another matter what has happened in the Middle<br />
East?<br />
PM: I am appalled by what has happened there. I can only hope that this<br />
doesn't derail what is now beyond a peace process to a reconciliation<br />
in the Middle East, but I will be getting a report on that as soon as<br />
possible. Thank you.<br />
