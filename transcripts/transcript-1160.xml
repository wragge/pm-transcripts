STATEMENT BY THlE PRIME MINISTER, THE RT. HON.<br />
IN THlE HOUSE OF R~ EPhiESENTAT IVES,<br />
TUESDAY. 28TH SEPTEMBER 1 96'<br />
WOOL RESERVE PRICE PLAN 1965<br />
My attention has been directed to the terms of<br />
a nation-wide broadcast to woolgrowers by Mr. 5.5. Nevile,<br />
Chairman of the Australian Wool Board's Marketing Committee.<br />
In this broadcast, the following statement<br />
occurs " Finally, the Prime Minister has clearly revealed<br />
the views concerning the reserve price arrangement of<br />
his Government, and I quote ' Besides protecting the<br />
individual grower, the Plan will help stabilise the<br />
industry and the national economy. These objects will<br />
be achieved without any of the elements of controlled<br />
marketing by Government control associated with most<br />
primary industry marketing arrangements, to which the<br />
characteristically independent woolgrower objects.<br />
The use of this quotation is grossly misleading4<br />
How misleading ( to use no stronger word) will at once appear<br />
when 1L tell the House that the words, attributed to me as if<br />
they related to the Plan now under consideration by woolgrowers,<br />
were part of a statement made on behalf of the Government no<br />
less than fourteen years ago. At that time there was another<br />
Reserve Price Plan, of an international character, negotiated<br />
among and supported by the Australian, New Zealand, South<br />
African, and British Governments. The British Government had<br />
already agreed to contribute substantial capital to the f'und<br />
necessary to establish it.<br />
That scheme was designed to represent a<br />
continuance of the Joint Organization reserve price arrangement<br />
after the winding up of the J. 0.<br />
In anticipation of that plan going into operation,<br />
the Australian Government, with the concurrence of woolgrower<br />
organizations imposed a levy of 7eoj on the gross proceeds or<br />
wool sold in 1950-51. This yielded about œ C45M., which was<br />
very near to the fœ 1+ 8M. which Australian woolgrowers were<br />
expected to contribute for the capital of the Scheme.<br />
My Government supported the Scheme, which had'<br />
been negotiated internationally. My statement was made on<br />
behalf of the Government. Today, fourteen years later, another scheme has<br />
been propounded for wool-marketing in Australia. What my<br />
Government has done is to agree with the representatives of<br />
the industry that<br />
The woolgrowers will make their own decision at<br />
a referendum.<br />
If the scheme is approved, the Government will<br />
play its part according to the terms of the<br />
prepared plan.<br />
That the Government will not take sides in a<br />
matter which it thinks proper for decision by<br />
the woolgrowers themselves. </p>
<p>2<br />
Under these circumstances, to claim the Prime<br />
Minister as a public partisan is to accuse him of<br />
violating the principle which on behalf of his own<br />
Government he has tried to make clear.<br />
This I greatly resent. The facts I have<br />
recited will justify that resentment to the full. </p>
