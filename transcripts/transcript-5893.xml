ADDRESS TO TRE M{ ELBOURNE CaA~ bER OF COW,! F CE<br />
The Budget responds to the needs of the times. it respondls<br />
to the eCOnorric diffic'ulties which face us as a natio. n;<br />
it responds to the particular needs and difficulties of<br />
individual Australians, particularly those hardest hit by the<br />
econo-mic-downturn; and i t does so wit hi -n the broad stra egy<br />
of a disciplin-d, riespor~ sible and responsive approach to fiscal<br />
and monetary policy tliat has been the continuing hallm~ ark of the<br />
Government's . economic policies.<br />
Over the past year, economi~ c conditions-facing Australia have<br />
deteriorated sharply. A major factor in this has be-en the<br />
severe recession affecting the whbl6e of the world ecortemy.<br />
The impact on Australia has been felt throu'gh the reduced<br />
dema-nd fofo-ur ex/ ports, and the lower prices received byF<br />
Australian producers. As result, there has also been a<br />
scaling back of planned investment in. resource-based<br />
and investmrent projects have been fuirther hit by hiigh real<br />
interest rates, affecting activity and employment in many<br />
industries including housing and construction, and seriously<br />
affecting hone-buyers and the prospects for home ownership.<br />
The impact o~ r. Australia of those externa-l factors hav b-een<br />
greatly worsened by unsustainable increases in wages and<br />
salaries over the last y'ear, Wage in~ creases have been<br />
significantly above the increase in consumier prices, and have<br />
occurred at a time when the rate of increase of costs and<br />
prices has cona down in most other countries. Our<br />
international compatitiveness.*'~ s consequently. slipped<br />
substantially, and the effects orf ' the world recession on us<br />
have been made worse. Our inipdiÃ±-corpetirng industries have<br />
come under-preasure as well as export indvistries, and the<br />
slowdown has become evident throughout the: economy."::-<br />
In these. circumstances we clearly needed a Budget whIch would<br />
both help min-imise the effects of the world recession on.:. th. e<br />
Australian economy, and prepare us to take Lull advantage of<br />
recovery when it eventually comes. We needed a Budget which<br />
achieved-s-balance between a positive response to the<br />
difficulties facing Alastralians, anid a responsible approach to<br />
economic management. / 2 </p>
<p>-2-<br />
The Government decided that a modest domestic Budget surplus<br />
of about $ 200 million would strike the right balance. It will<br />
provide the Government with the capacity to help those in need,<br />
while maintaining a firm anti-inflationary stance of policy<br />
overall. To expand the Budget deficit by too much would<br />
cause severe difficulties for our economy.<br />
The socialist approach pursued by President Mitterand of<br />
France until very recently shows what a total disaster a<br />
major increase in the Budget deficit would be. The<br />
Mitterand formula was to increase dramatically government<br />
expenditure in the hope that by doing so economic activity will<br />
be stimulated in spite of inflationary pressures. As a result,<br />
at a time of falling inflation rates in Europe, France's<br />
inflation rate has risen to about 14%; its GDP has contracted,<br />
not expanded, as was supposed to have happened; unemployment<br />
has risen to about 9% and employment fallen; France now<br />
has a record trade deficit; and by the end of 1982, a small<br />
public sector surplus m. y have turned into a deficit<br />
equal to 4% of GDP.<br />
On 13 Jun..' his. Governr-tent announced a turnaround,<br />
and strict budgetary-controls have beenintroduced, and it is<br />
disturbing that there are: i. people and parties in Australia<br />
still praising the mitterand line long after Mitterand has<br />
abandoned Mitterand.<br />
The Government has always rejected that approach. Our objective<br />
within the constraints of responsible economic management, has<br />
been to help those Australians who are being hit by the<br />
recession, while also helping the economy itself. I want<br />
to comment-on how the Budget addresses the difficulties<br />
of three areas of Australian society: families; businesses; and<br />
various groups with specific and pressing needs.<br />
Australian families will benefit in a major way from an<br />
integrated package of measures. The tax cuts are large,<br />
and of major significance. The tax free threshold has been<br />
raised $ 400; the standard tax rate has been reduced to 30 cents<br />
in the dollar; and the level at which the 46% tax rate applies<br />
has been raised. The new tax rebates for all home mortgage<br />
interest over 10%, the large increase in family allowances and the<br />
$ 200 per annum increase in spouse rebate where there is<br />
a dependent child, all work in combination to make the vast<br />
majority of Australian families much better off.<br />
A t5 ical single-income family on $ 300 a week, with two children<br />
and a mortgage to pay off will be about $ 18 per week better off,<br />
taking into accoudnt increases in indirect taxes. For low income<br />
families, there will also be the far-sight ed new family income_ supplarn<br />
of $ 10 per week per child. This supplernt will give greatly<br />
needed assistance and also provide an incentive to work to sorre<br />
people whose families would otherwise be better off on unemployment<br />
benefits. Obviously the needs of different families vary,<br />
and together the P.' det measures will greatly improve the<br />
position of Australian families. ./ 3<br />
P </p>
<p>-3-<br />
For businesses, the Budget builds on the package of measures<br />
announced on 19 July in the Government's response to three<br />
major IAC Reports. That package was designed to support the<br />
efforts of Australian industry to restore its competitiveness,<br />
and to build itself up for the future through more generous<br />
depreciation provisions, including an extension of depreciation<br />
allowances to all new non-residential income producing<br />
buildings; through a continuation of Industrial Research<br />
and Uleveloprnent Scheme; and through a strengthening of the<br />
; xport iKarket Development 9cheme.<br />
A Variety of measures in the Budget will complement the<br />
incentives provided in that package, particularly while we<br />
await an improvement in general economic conditions. Business<br />
will benefit, from the stimulus to activity and employment<br />
that will flow from the substantial increase in capital works<br />
spending, including a 68% expen'liture increase in 1982/ 83 D. 4get finance<br />
for the civil works progra. m. For e; ar. ple, new arA1 ongoing aviation civil , rk~ s<br />
construction will involve an e xrditure of $ 151 million in ' 1982/ S3; $ 83 million vi<br />
be provided as capital funding for aged or disabled persons'<br />
accommodation; the new bicentennial roads programs will add<br />
a further $ 150 million to roads expenditure in 1982/ 83 in<br />
addition to the $ 734 million provided ui-der the existing roads<br />
program; and direct funding by the Commonwealth of welfare<br />
housing will rise by 27% to some $ 333 million.<br />
The new wider tax rebate for housing should provide welcome<br />
s * timulus to the building industry and related manufacturers,<br />
and the personal tax reductions in the Budget will put about<br />
$ 1,500 million back into consumers' pockets in 1982/ 83,<br />
much of which will generate increased spending and activity.<br />
Some of the tax reforms in the Budget will directly assist<br />
Australian businesses, including small businesses: in particular.<br />
the further increase from 70% to 80% in the retention allowance<br />
for private companies, which meets a 1980 election cormmitment,<br />
will give a full year benefit of $ 30 million to small business.<br />
Moreover, the Government proposes to introduce measures to<br />
allow losses suffered by one company in a group with 100%<br />
comcmon ownership to be offset against taxable income of other<br />
companies in the group, thus removing a disadvantage of company<br />
groups vis-a-vis integrated companies. We all know that<br />
unless private enterprise is in good shape, Australia suffers<br />
as a whole., and the Government is committed to d6ing<br />
everything it can to provide the framework and encouragement<br />
in which buisiness can flourish. The Budget also gives valuable<br />
assistance to a number of other groups in the community.<br />
There are major meas ures for : young people. All student allowances<br />
have been increased, the secondary allowance scheme means test has braeased<br />
greatly and a 20% -increase in the SAS will assist many<br />
low income f amilies to maintain children in-education, and thus<br />
./ 4 </p>
<p>4<br />
get vital skills. There are significant increases in training<br />
opportunities. Young people will also benefit from the 21%<br />
increase in employment and training programs, which will assist<br />
252,000 people all up. There will be 74,000 new approvals<br />
for work experience in 1982/ 1983, 22,000 more than last year,<br />
and 111,000 apprentices will be assisted under the CRAFT<br />
scheme, and this is an increase of 12,000 on last year's record.<br />
There are also new measures for pensioners. The new $ 250<br />
pensioner rebate means that pensioners pay no tax up to a<br />
threshold of $ 5429 pa and the rebate is then progressively<br />
phased out; supplementary rental assistance for pensioners<br />
will be increased by a further $ 2 to $ 10 per week; single pensioners<br />
will be able to earn $ 10 more per week without any reduction<br />
in their pensions and pensioner cou-les$ 14.50 more; and the<br />
income limits for: receiving fringe benefits, including pensioner<br />
health benefits, will be lifted by over<br />

<p>In these and many other ways, the Budget assists in meeting<br />
the difficulties faced by Australians during the economic<br />
downturn. But the initiatives contained in the Budget are<br />
not limited to measures that address current problems, there<br />
are-important, visionary initiatives that build for the future<br />
in a direct way.<br />
The Australian Bicentennial Road Development Program is designed<br />
to bring a national roads system to acceptable standards by<br />
1988, to assist the development of major urban and rural<br />
arterial roads, and where desired by the states, to assist<br />
with approved urban public transport projects, to accelerate<br />
construction of current development road projects, including<br />
roads of national tourism importance, and to enable local<br />
governments to upgrade their road systems by 1988.<br />
This bicentennial program will help improve Australia's<br />
transport and communications system. It will therefore benefit<br />
our agricultural, manufacturing, mining and tourism industries<br />
as well as giving a significant boost to the construction industry<br />
and to local governments.<br />
The program will involve total expenditure about<br />
S$ 2 billon over 6 years financed by special surcharge on petrol and<br />
diesel excise and this surcharge will be paid into a trust<br />
fund fromwhichpayments will be made only for the program.<br />
Another important Budget innovation is the encouragement to<br />
small investors by allowing relief from so-called double<br />
taxation of dividends through a rebate at the standard rate of<br />
tax on up to $ 1,000 of dividend income, at a cost of $ 75 million<br />
in a. full year. The incentive provided for employee share<br />
participation schemes by freeing employees from tax on benefits<br />
arising from the price at which shares are issued under approved<br />
schemes is also welcome. This concession should encourage sbhemes<br />
that will create among employees a greater feeling of sharing<br />
in the fortune of their companies and help improve productivity<br />
and industrial relations.<br />
One of the most significant overall elements of the Budqet is that<br />
it establishes arealbasis for co-operation and working together.<br />
It provides for reasoned discussion about the claims of different<br />
groups in the framework of what is best for Australia as a whole.<br />
It is a Budget for all Australians, and by improving the position<br />
of the whole community throuqh tax cuts, improved benefits and<br />
new incentives the Budget demonstrates the Government's<br />
strong commitment to encouraging all Australians to work<br />
together to minimise the impactof the world economic recession<br />
and to ensure we are all-able to take advantage of the world<br />
economic recovery when it finally comes. </p>
<p>6-<br />
To achieve these objectives, which all Australians share<br />
it is vital that we build on the basis established in the Budget<br />
a moderate and sustainable approach to wages in this country.<br />
Wage restraint has never been more critical to our future.<br />
There have recently been some important and welcome wage decisions.<br />
The Government accepted salary recommendations well below the<br />
current inflation rate for Parliamentarians and senior public<br />
servants, and it was encouraging that the Academic Salaries<br />
Tribunal made similar recommendations.<br />
An important example to the community has been set by these<br />
I actions, and I have written to a number of companies, to State<br />
Premiers and to the ACTU and the CAI explaining the importance<br />
of these decisions. Some major companies have announced a freeze<br />
or very small salary increases, and. leading people in the trade<br />
union movement including the President and the Secretary of the<br />
ACTU have both spoken out strongly in support of wage moderation.<br />
Mr Dolan, the President of the ACTU, was reported last week as<br />
saying that more people would have to accept less pay to keep<br />
their jobs. All of this happened before the Budget and there<br />
is all the more reason for responsible wage decisions'to be made<br />
after the Budget, and in the light of its contribution to<br />
people's disposable income.<br />
The Budget provides a very great stimulus to the groundswell<br />
of support for co-operation, for working together, which has<br />
been growing throughout the community in recent times. It is<br />
through this spirit of working together combined with sound<br />
government policies based on a realistic attitude to Australia's<br />
situation that we can maintain the underlying strength of our<br />
economy. We must keep building on recent successes in co-operation<br />
. which have been significant. The Tripartite Conference showed<br />
an important measure of agreement that excessive wage increases<br />
would throw more people out of work. The co-operation between<br />
unions, management and governments, based on the Crawford Report',<br />
to make shipping flow more smoothly through our ports shows a<br />
willingness to face up to the reality of Australia's. situation.<br />
So does the fact that governments, both State and Federal, have<br />
been getting together with the coal industry to solve the problems<br />
which have plagued that industry. and threatened Australia's<br />
reputation for reliability.<br />
These issues are far too important for anyone to go around<br />
pointing the bone at different people or groups, we need to<br />
face difficulties together, and avoid conflicts. I really think<br />
that some of the things that have been said in the last few days<br />
by the Victorian Government about drought relief are a typical<br />
example of the kind of conflict that ought to be avoided. The<br />
Commonwealth contributes enormously to drought relief. Australiawide<br />
Commonwealth assistance over the last two years has been<br />
$ 100 million. There are well-established arrangements in place<br />
for Commonwealth-State co-operation in drought relief which have<br />
worked fnr many years to the benefit of our farmers,. and I hate<br />
the thought that farmers should be made into pawin I, a disput<br />
which is totally unnecessary because of . the . perfectly satisfactory<br />
arrangements which allow governments to deal co-operatively with<br />
drought. If we are to keep building Australia up, and take advantag<br />
of all our opportunities and strengths we must all-pull togetherk<br />
Everybody knows this and the track ahead of us as a nation i~ to act<br />
upon that knowledge more and more so. that we can give reality<br />
to the kind of Australia we want for our children.<br />
