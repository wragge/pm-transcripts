<p>Thank you very much Mr Speaker. It is a special privilege for me to be here and the honour of addressing the Joint Sitting of Congress is one that is extended not only to me but more importantly to my country. And I want to say that I appreciate very, very much the opportunity, the hospitality being extended by the Speaker, the warmth and generosity and the welcome that I have received in Washington from Congress, from the Administration and from the American people. America has no better friend anywhere in the world than Australia and today is a great opportunity for me to reaffirm that to the elected representatives of the American people.<br />
