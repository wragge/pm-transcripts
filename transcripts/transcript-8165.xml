    <content><![CDATA[<p>PRI E INITE<br />INTERVIEW WITH KERRI-ANNE KENNERLEY, GOOD MORNING<br />AUSTRALIA, 19 OCTOBER 1990<br />E 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />KENNERLEY: I'm joined this morning by the Prime<br />Minister, Bob Hawke. A very good morning to you Mr Prime<br />Minister. Thank you for your time.<br />PM: Pleasure.<br />KENNERLEY: Why did it take six weeks?<br />PM: Well I understand that in fact payment has been made<br />over the last five weeks in regard to the special benefit<br />and accumulated family allowances. That money has been<br />paid over the last five weeks but the particular problem<br />that Mrs Silva had wasn't brought to the attention of the<br />Department until Wednesday. That problem arose from the<br />fact that she has a joint account with Westpac, with her<br />husband and of course because Mr Silva is detained and is<br />uncontactable in Kuwait, she had not been able to operate<br />on that account. As soon as our people became aware of<br />this, Kerni-Anne, on Wednesday, immediately contacted<br />Westpac at a senior management level and explained the<br />possibility of the normal operation of that account and<br />why Mrs Silvia had therefore no access to those funds,<br />which funds operated as a bar to other Social Security<br />payments. And as soon as the bank was made aware of this<br />problem and I pay them full tribute they immediately<br />indicated that they would make special arrangements<br />whereby she would have access to those funds. So the<br />normal payments had been made and all the entitlements<br />had been fixed up. But this particular problem was<br />remedied through a combination of the work of our<br />Department and the appropriate and very welcome<br />cooperation of Westpac and I thank them for it.<br />KENNERLEY: Mr Hawke, may I suggest that perhaps the bank<br />knew about this problem weeks before it was solved and<br />that the paper-work actually went from one department to<br />another department and finally ended up in the Prime<br />Minister's Department and then and only then when, after<br />she appeared on this program just 24 hours ago, did money<br />miraculously appear.<br />PM: Well I can't say what happened within the bank. All<br />I can say is that as soon as we became aware of it we</p>
<p>acted and it was remedied, thanks to the cooperation of<br />the bank. As far as other payments were concerned they<br />had been made over a period of the previous 5 weeks.<br />KENNERLEY: Also, if I may just hold you for one minute<br />more because I do know you are In reaction to a<br />story we've Just ran in the news, the Reserve Bank is<br />criticising -the Government's very slow economic process.<br />What's your response?<br />PM: I've answered that in the Parliament, Kerni. We've<br />had to make -the decisions which are difficult ones on<br />balance. If we'd eased monetary policy too quickly we<br />ran the risk of a much greater catastrophe of surge-back<br />into a level of imports that were not sustainable and<br />then the world would've marked us down in a way which<br />would've been totally catastrophic. These things are not<br />easy and I believe that we've got the balance right.<br />We've had to slow down the level of activity, we've done<br />that and I know there's been some hurt in that process<br />and I think Australians know me well enough to know that<br />that gives me no pleasure. It was something that was<br />necessary to be done.<br />KENNERLEY: Will that hurt get worse?<br />PM: I think not. We're coming, I believe, to the bottom<br />of the lowering of activity and I think as we go into ' 91<br />the economy -will recover. But it was necessary because<br />if we hadn't done that and we tried to keep borrowing<br />from the rest of the world to pay for a level of<br />consumption that we couldn't sustain by our own<br />production the world would've marked us down drastically<br />and I wasn't prepared to run that risk which would've<br />been far greater for Australia.<br />KENNERLEY: But will things get worse?<br />PM: Well I think we're reaching the bottom of that<br />lowering of activity and the signs, there are signs there<br />now but I think we will start to recover. I've said that<br />as we go into ' 91 I think that that will happen.<br />KENNERLEY: Mr Hawke, we know your time is needed there<br />but thank you very much for joining us.<br />PM: It's been my pleasure. Thank you.<br />ends</p>
