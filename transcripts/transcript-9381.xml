TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P. J. KEATING MP<br />
ADDRESS AT PRESENTATION OF THE AUSTRALIAN ARTISTS<br />
CREATIVE FELLOWSHIPS, PARLIAMENT HOUSE, CANBERRA,<br />
MONDAY, 17 OCTOBER 1994<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
Thank you very much Michael ( Lynch), my colleague Michael Lee, Hilary<br />
McPhee, Senator Kernot, distinguished ladies and gentlemen and awardees,<br />
fellowship winners. It is a great pleasure to be here on yet another occasion<br />
associated with the fellowships and thank you Hilary indeed for the invitation.<br />
I am so chuffed these days about the Australia Council and the way it has<br />
changed over the years, adapted to the needs of this country, to the arts, to<br />
the community and one doesn't have too many occasions to say nice things<br />
about people, but let me say, I generally try and make them you see. Let me<br />
say though I am delighted with the leadership which Hilary McPhee and<br />
Michael Lynch are providing and to have people of this calibre follow Rodney<br />
Hall and Max Burke and them following after Donald ( Homne) that continuity,<br />
that tremendous commitment which they bring gives the Government, I think,<br />
great confidence that the arts are in very good hands in this country.<br />
So, thank you indeed for your efforts, both of you, and for the Council in,<br />
again, stewarding the change through this year and for bringing these<br />
fellowships on. I am hoping that the coincidence of the awards and the<br />
fellowships and tomorrow's statement on the arts will mean that this is a great<br />
week for the arts in Australia because rarely does a Government have an<br />
opportunity to make a contribution, a renewed contribution to the arts in this<br />
country. We already have this week the Australian National Festival of<br />
Theatre on, so many people connected with the arts are in this city and we<br />
have our distinguished artists this morning and the Tasmanian Symphony<br />
and it should'be, I think, a great occasion tomorrow. I hope it is and I want it<br />
to be because what the statement is about is not some routine announcement<br />
or some routine change, but rather a statement that the arts and the belief of<br />
the Government that the arts are not peripheral to Australian life, but central<br />
to it. And, that is the cause of the statement being made and to redefine and<br />
redirect the way in which the arts are funded by the Commonwealth and how </p>
<p>we can do co-operative things around the country with the arts community<br />
and with the States to redirect artistic endeavour in this country.<br />
So, I hope when this time tomorrow comes those of you who have been<br />
waiting for it will be pleased with it and that we will truly have an opportunity<br />
to make very clear that the arts are entirely central to Australia and matter to<br />
us economically and socially to our identity et cetera.<br />
When Governments make statements they get a lot of press and, of course,<br />
everyone expects them to be economic statements or mechanical statements,<br />
things about industry policy and the like. Well, there is going to be a lot of<br />
that in there too, but it is about the essence of the defining nature of the arts<br />
in Australia and the definition it brings to this country.<br />
The Fellowships are part of that, of course, as well. And, what they are about<br />
is saying clearly and I hope lucidly that for people who have made a<br />
contribution to the arts and to the culture of this country that they are<br />
important and that the Government wants to continue to support them, to<br />
make a contribution so that their commitment to date can be continued for<br />
them often in mid career. This is essentially a scheme for artists of<br />
accomplishment in mid career and I am delighted that the quality of it, that the<br />
people who have been awarded the fellowships, now 45 of them since its<br />
inception, have been of such a high calibre that the prestige of the scheme<br />
remains as it was on the day it was first announced. As a consequence, we<br />
have seen people develop themselves, to take either the time out from an<br />
active and busy career or to continue as they had been, doing things that<br />
they might not have otherwise been able to do, but needing to worry about<br />
funds and money and how they can keep their life together.<br />
These are for two years, three years, up to five years, they are now at<br />
$ 66,000 a year which is an income which will encourage, we hope, those<br />
artists who have already, as I said, made a substantial contribution and who<br />
already are noteworthy for their work to continue on.<br />
So, it is a great pleasure to me that there has been so much interest in the<br />
Fellowships by the artistic and cultural community in this country and that<br />
they remain, in a sense, the prestige and important awards that they are.<br />
I hope that we will see these grow in the future, we are even saying<br />
something about them tomorrow and as I say, at this time tomorrow I think<br />
these awards and that which they stand for, but the arts in this country in<br />
general will have been seen by the community as being supported by the<br />
Government because of their innately important role in our society. Thank<br />
you very much for having me along.<br />
