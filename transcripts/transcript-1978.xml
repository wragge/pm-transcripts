FOR PRESS: P. M. No. 2/ 1969<br />
VICTORIAN BUSHFIRES<br />
Statement by the Acting Prime Minister, Mr. John McEwen<br />
I was most distressed to hear of the shocking bushfires<br />
which have today occurred in Victoria.<br />
I am sure that all Australians will join with me and<br />
the Commonwealth Government in expressing their deepest sympathy<br />
to the relatives of those people who have lost their lives in the fires.<br />
Our sympathy also goes out to those who have been injured and who<br />
have lost homes and material possessions as a result of the disaster.<br />
As is usual in cases of this nature the defence forces<br />
are prepared to give the authorities who have control of the fire fighting<br />
operations the most assistance that is possible. The Commonwealth<br />
Government also stands ready to assist the Victorian Government on a<br />
for basis for the relief of personal hardship and distress suffered<br />
by those people affected by the fires.<br />
