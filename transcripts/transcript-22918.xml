<p>E&amp;OEâ¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦</p>
<p>WILKINS:</p>
<p>The Paralympics, Prime Minister, are they worth more money in terms of funding?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>They will get a funding increase just as weâve promised the Olympians a funding increase, weâre going to do the same for the Paralympians.  Weâre not going to treat them unfairly.  Weâre going to give them the same generosity that weâre going to display towards the Olympians.</p>
<p>WILKINS:</p>
<p>Has that been disclosed to them yet?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I discussed it with a number of their officials yes.  So, you know, if thereâs an âXâ percent rise in the Olympic funding, weâre going to try and be reasonable and fair and generous to the Paralympians as well.</p>
<p>WILKINS:</p>
<p>An yet undisclosed amount?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, as yet undisclosed but I just wanted to make it plain that we are going to be even handed.<br />
