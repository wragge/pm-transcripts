FOR PRESS: PM No. 78/ 1971<br />
Statement_ bythe Prime Minister, Mr. William McMahon<br />
This afternoon I asked Mr. Gorton, the Minister for<br />
Defence, to see me about his decision to write a series of<br />
articles for the " Sunday Australian", the first of which has<br />
already been published.<br />
I informed him that, in my opinion, his action<br />
breached basic principles of Cabinet solidarity and unity<br />
and reflected on the integrity of some Ministers.<br />
I therefore asked Mr. Gorton to let me have his<br />
resignation. This he agreed to do.<br />
I have advised the Governor-General and will<br />
shortly recommend the name of a new Minister.<br />
CANBERRA 12 AUGUST 1971 </p>
