PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 19 January 1986<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
ETHNIC MEETING LALOR LIBRARY, SCULLIN BY-ELECTION<br />
Friends, It gives me very great pleasure to be here today. And that is<br />
not something that I just say in a formal sense to you.<br />
As I was able to say in the Federal Parliament in 1984 when the<br />
opposition had sought to make something of a political issue out<br />
of immigration and did themselves a very great disservice in the<br />
process. I was able to say that in fact one of the basic reasons<br />
why I joined the Australian Labor Party straight after the end of<br />
the last war, when I was a student at the University of Western<br />
Australia, was the great pride that I took in the way in which<br />
the Labor Party in government at that time, developed the most<br />
imaginative immigration policy which has ever been adopted by any<br />
political party in any western democracy.<br />
The Labor Government in power then firstly under the Prime<br />
Ministership of John Curtin till 1945 and then Ben Chifley after<br />
1945, with the Immigration minister being Arthur Calwell made a<br />
decision even~ during a period of war when massively important<br />
issues had to be confronted in war-time, they thought about what<br />
sort of country Australia was going to be after the war.<br />
And one of the central features-of their thinking as they tried<br />
to plan for a b etter Australia after the war was a commitment to<br />
a massive immigration.<br />
As a young man in Perth, as I went to university in 1947, I<br />
joined the Labor Party then now nearly 40 years ago, 40 years<br />
next year one of the main inspirations that I had was the way<br />
in which I was able to identify with the Labor Party in their<br />
view about what needed to be done to change the composition of<br />
Australia.<br />
At that stage, at the end of the war, Australia had a very small<br />
population of 7 million people. And the leaders of the Labor<br />
Party realised that this was a large country with very great<br />
resources. And they knew that if we were going to be able to<br />
develop those resources we had to have more people. more people i </p>
<p>2<br />
than could just be provided by the process of natural increase.<br />
And so there was born the great immigration policy of that<br />
post-war period.<br />
And under that policy, which saw the greatest migration wave in<br />
recorded history, we had a total transformation of the<br />
composition of the Australian population.<br />
This was a two-way thing. It obviously has been a great thing<br />
for Australia that people could come here and bring their skills,<br />
traditions, experience and background to this country. And also<br />
it has been good for them because we have been able to offer a<br />
new home and new opportunities for people in circumstances better<br />
than -they probably would otherwise have been able to enjoy_ from<br />
the countries from which they came at least in those earlier<br />
day~ s just after the war.<br />
And so this has been a good thing for the people that-have come<br />
and certainly a great thing for Australia.<br />
As I look at this country today in 1986 and I try an compare<br />
it with that country of 40 years ago when I joined the Labor<br />
Party, it is almost impossible to see the country as the same<br />
place. Because now it is not 7 million people. It is getting on for 16<br />
million people.<br />
And an economy which has been radically transformed. A country<br />
which is now not inward-looking but is realises that we are part<br />
of South East Asia the most rapidly growing part of the world.<br />
A country which is now able to make a very significant<br />
contribution to developments in those areas and in turn to<br />
benefit from them.<br />
And right through all those changes has been the change in<br />
composition of our population.<br />
As I say, it is easy for me to come and meet with a group like<br />
this because for the whole of my adult political career I have<br />
identified with, and regarded as fundamentally important, this<br />
change that has taken place in Australia via our immigration<br />
program. Peter referred to the fact that before I went into the Parliament<br />
I was the President of the ACTU for the decade of the 1970s. And<br />
in that decade one of the most important tasks of that job as<br />
President of the ACTU, I regarded as my work on the immigration<br />
advisory and immigration planningcouncils jobs which I<br />
undertook for the whole of that decade of the 1970s.<br />
Because it is true and should be remembered, that when the Labor<br />
Party at the end of the war, decided that it was going to embark<br />
on -this massive immigration program, a great deal of persuasion<br />
had to be done with the trade union movement.<br />
In the period before the war we had never had full employment in<br />
this country and there was some suspicion on the part of workers </p>
<p>3. N<br />
in this country that if we had hundreds of thousands of people<br />
coming here from overseas, then they were suspicious that there<br />
wasn't going to be a continuation of their employment.<br />
Fortunately for this country, the leaders of the industrial<br />
labour movement, as well as the political labour movement in that<br />
period at the end of the war, they had a vision of the futu~ re as<br />
well. I<br />
And my predecessor Albert monk, President of the ACTU, Percy<br />
Cleary another leader in the industrial movement and who was also<br />
briefly in the Federal Parliament, those leaders of the<br />
industrial labour movement also had a vision of the future. And<br />
they supported-and gave the support of -the trade union movement<br />
to the Government as they developed this immigration program.<br />
And i was able to continue that commitment of the trade unions in<br />
my period as President to ensure that not only would we continue<br />
to bring people to this country but that we provide the services<br />
within this country which were necessary to ensure that the<br />
people who came here were given the best possible opportunity of<br />
integrating into their new homeland.<br />
And so it was that when I finished with the ACTU and went into<br />
the Federal Parliament it was perfectly natural given the<br />
history that I have referred to that I should continue to give<br />
importance and significance to matters concerning our immigration<br />
policy and the welfare of people in this country who have come<br />
from overseas.<br />
-indeed I ensured that the immigration portfolio was elevated into<br />
the Cabinet so that the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic<br />
Affairs would be at the centre of discussions in our policy<br />
formulation in Canberra.<br />
So you can see that this great labour movement, which I have the<br />
honour to lead--federally, is the movement in Australia both<br />
politically and industrially which has been right at the centre<br />
of the formulation of policy and then the implementation of it to<br />
Kchange the character of Australia.<br />
Not the Liberals, not the conservative forces of this country,<br />
but the great labour movement, politically and industrially,<br />
which enabled the implementation of this vast immigration policy.<br />
And we have remained steadfastly committed to that policy.,<br />
There have been times when pressures have been imposed by various<br />
elements within this community to try and make us waver from our<br />
commitment to that policy. But it is one of the matters of great<br />
pride for me that never, from the time that we made that<br />
undertaking during the last the last war, has the labour movement<br />
wavered from that commitment to both the policy of bringing<br />
people to this country and also toensure that once people are<br />
here that as much of our resources as possible can be devoted to<br />
ensuring that their transition into our society is facilitated.<br />
And since I have been Prime Minister I have ensured that the two<br />
Ministers that we have had first Mr West and now Mr Hurford </p>
<p>4N<br />
have had whenever they needed it, immediate access to me with any<br />
problems.<br />
And we have, on a national basis, very significantly increased<br />
the amount of resources made available to the programs directed<br />
towards facilitating the entry and assimilation of migrants in<br />
this country.<br />
And within this electorate of Scullin I would like to indicate to<br />
you the difference in the amounts of money allocated. In the<br />
year before we came to office only 33,000 dollars that was in<br />
the year 182-183 was available for the funding of migrant<br />
resource centres in this electorate. And now in this year-<br />
185-186 that has been increa sed by_ 350 per cent to a total of<br />
148,00. And-that in" itself is a reflection-of the-sorts of<br />
priorities that we attach to these things.<br />
Now as Peter said, the policies of government which are of<br />
importance to the ethnic community are not simply the policies<br />
that deal with immigration per se, or deal with the provision of<br />
resources for migrants once they have arrived here, but a whole<br />
range of policies in the area of employment, education and health<br />
that are important to you.<br />
At a function which was held just a short time ago when we<br />
launched the campaign for Harry, he said there that the Liberals<br />
had the temerity to try and say that they are the ones who had<br />
the concern for families.<br />
Now of course as he said that is arrant'nonsense. And indeed it<br />
is. It is all very well for the Liberals to get up and say they are<br />
concerned about families as though in politics you only have to<br />
say I am concerned about families and that means something.<br />
what families--are concerned about are the specific things that<br />
determine whether families are better or worse off. It-is no<br />
good a politician getting up and saying we are concerned about<br />
families and then sitting down and saying aren't I a good boy.<br />
The things that determine the well-being of Australian families<br />
are the policies about things like housing, education, health and<br />
employment. Those are the things which determine what the<br />
conditions of Australian families are going to be.<br />
And just remember the comparison between our opponents in<br />
government and what they did and did not do in those areas. And<br />
what we have done since we have been in.<br />
Just look at the issues briefly.<br />
Housing. Are there going to be bomes for the families of<br />
Australia. When we came to office at the beginning of 1983, the<br />
level of the building of homes wsjust ovr100,000 -105,000.<br />
The housing industry was operating~ at significantly below its<br />
capacity. We have lifted that up to 150,000 a 50 per cent<br />
increase. We have had that sort of increase in the allocation of </p>
<p>funds for public housing. So on the question of homes for<br />
families we have turned the housing industry around and<br />
provided many, many more homes for families in Australia.<br />
in education. For the first time now we have a significant<br />
increase in the amount of funding in real terms available to the<br />
education system, for primary, for secondary and the tertiary<br />
levels. It had been allowed to whither under the Liberals.<br />
money available to the education system had gone down. We have<br />
turned that around.<br />
In regard to health. When we came to office there were millions<br />
of Australians, particularly low income families, for whom<br />
spectre of illness was totally frightening because they had no<br />
proper cover. Under the scheme that we have introduced, no<br />
family in Australia has to be worried about the spectre of<br />
illness as they were before.<br />
In regard to jobs. Whether there are going to be jobs for the<br />
kids of Australian families. A quarter of a million jobs<br />
disappeared in the last 12 months under the Liberals. We have<br />
created half a million new jobs. Creating jobs at a faster rate<br />
than they have ever before been created in the history of this<br />
country.<br />
So those are the things that are important for families. Not for<br />
a politician to get up and say we are interested in families and<br />
at the same time as saying they are interested in families<br />
allowing the bui-lding of homes to run down; to allow jobs to<br />
disappear; to make health a horror area' for the families of<br />
Australia. All those things they did while they talk about<br />
having concern for families.<br />
we Just don't get up and say we are concerned for families<br />
which we are. We, at the Federal and State level, pursue the<br />
policies which ensure that Australian families, and may I say<br />
particularly families that have come from countries overseas, are<br />
going to have the opportunity of living a better life.<br />
Y So I join with Peter in saying how pleased I am to be here. But<br />
I also particularly join with him in asking you that you will try<br />
and make sure that between now and the 8th of February that you<br />
will talk with your friends; with you neighbours; with the people<br />
you meet in your churches; your clubs; your sporting<br />
associations; wherever you have your contacts with your fellow<br />
Australians; please tell them how important it is to get out<br />
there on the 8th of February and vote.<br />
Because we want to receive from you in this by-election the sort<br />
of endorsement which we believe those policies which I have<br />
referred to deserve.<br />
And finally let me say that the electors of this area have been<br />
very well served by Dr Harry Jenkins in this electorate. The<br />
measure of respect in which he is held is that he was elected to<br />
the very high office of the Speaker.<br />
Now the time has come when both he and the Government have </p>
<p>decided that his services can be used in another capacity.<br />
And his son, Harry Jenkins Jnr, who is going to be standard<br />
bearer for Labor. Just as his father has done an oxcellent job<br />
representing the interests of the people of this area, I know<br />
that Harry Jenkins will do that.<br />
Please ensure that he gets the support that he deserves and that<br />
the Labor Government deserves.<br />
It gives me great pleasure to introduce Harry to you now.<br />
