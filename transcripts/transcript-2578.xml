FOR PRESS: No. 43/ 1972.<br />
TRIBUTE TO SIR KENNETH BAILEY<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister, the Rt Hon. William<br />
McMahon, M. P.<br />
Sir Kenneth Bailey came to the service of the Commonwealth<br />
Government after distinguished academic and administrative service<br />
at the University of Melbourne.<br />
He held high office in the Commonwealth Service for more<br />
than twenty-five years. In particular, he was Commonwealth Solicitor-<br />
General and Secretary to the Attorney-General's Department between<br />
the years 1946 to 1964. In these two offices, he was principal law<br />
adviser to successive Attorneys-General and Prime Ministers and to<br />
governments generally. He occupied these posts with great<br />
professional and personal distinction.<br />
After 1964, he was for five years Australian High<br />
Commissioner in Canada and since 1970, special adviser on<br />
international law to the Attorney-General's and Foreign Affairs<br />
Departments. He represented Australia at many major conferences. His<br />
renown extends widely abroad.<br />
Sir Kenneth Bailey was a man of outstanding scholarship<br />
and industry. He had great humanity.<br />
He was a personal friend of mine and on all occasions a<br />
charming and pleasant companion. He was a great Australian and a<br />
great civil servant.<br />
I extend to Lady Bailey and his family my own and the<br />
Government's deepest sympathy.<br />
CANBERRA, 3 May, 1972. </p>
