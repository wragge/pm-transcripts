TEL PRIME MINISTER ' 35/ 93<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, HON P. J. KEATING, MP<br />
TASKFORCE REPORT ON BENALTA FLOODS<br />
I have received the report on the Benalla floods prepared by the Government's Rural and Regional<br />
Taskforce, headed by the Member for Page, Harry Woods.<br />
This report was compiled after the taskforce visited the Benalla region and met representatives of<br />
the Victorian Farmers' Federation, the Chambcr of Commerce and all local municipalitics, to<br />
establish how much damage was done in the floods and how the Commonwealth could help.<br />
Mr Woods has noted that the local representatives he met were generally happy with the<br />
Commonwealth's initial response to the immediate personal hardships. There was recognition of<br />
the value of programs such as JobSkills and the Landcare and Environment Action Program. The<br />
taskforce has recommcnded thatithese programs be extended specially in the flood-affected area.<br />
It recommends that assistance be considered through the National Landcare Program in restoring<br />
and repairing severely damaged land, waterways and vegetation. And it recommends that the<br />
Minister for Social Security consider special disaster provisions, so that benefits could be paid<br />
retrospectively to those who have helped in the clean-up.<br />
Mr Woods has reported to me that many local pcople told the taskforce they believed they were<br />
being denied the level of financial help that ought to be provided by the Victorian State<br />
Government. Sinilar concerns have been voiced by the Victorian Farmers' Federation, in a<br />
statement of November 11 and at the taskforce's hearings.<br />
This is a matter of concern to the Commonwealth Government. Under the terms of the National<br />
Disaster Relief Arrangements, the cost of disaster relief is met by the State Government up to an<br />
agreed threshold, and matched by the Commonwealth beyond that. Victoria's spending has not<br />
reached that threshold, Mr Woods told me.<br />
I am now examining the report of the taskforce, and I will ensure that recommendations for action<br />
are put before the relevant Commonwealth Ministers without delay.<br />
