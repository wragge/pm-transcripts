    <content><![CDATA[<p>This week the Government continued to deliver on our commitment to build the infrastructure of the 21st century.</p>
<p>We are working with state governments around Australia to deliver major roads â from the Bruce Highway in Queensland to the East West Link in Melbourne to the Swan Bypass in Perth.</p>
<p>This week, the Government decided finally to build an airport in Western Sydney.</p>
<p>It is a decision that successive governments have put off for fifty years.</p>
<p>A Western Sydney airport is important infrastructure for our whole country â as 40 per cent of all international arrivals and departures go through Sydney as well as 50 per cent of all Australiaâs air freight.</p>
<p>Its construction will generate thousands of jobs and in time it will provide up to 60,000 new jobs.</p>
<p>And we are backing it up with major investments for Western Sydney roads â with the Commonwealth providing $3.5 billion in new road funding that will create 4,000 new jobs over the next ten years.</p>
<p>Investments in infrastructure are investments in the economy of our future.</p>
<p>We are delivering on our plan to build a strong and prosperous economy by building better infrastructure, scrapping bad taxes, cutting red tape and encouraging more trade.</p>
<p>Now this coming week, we celebrate Easter and we commemorate ANZAC Day.</p>
<p>I hope all Australians are enjoying their Easter break with their family.Â  It is a time to give thanks and rejoice for the good things in life that we share.</p>
<p>On ANZAC Day, we honour those who have served our country in war and peace.Â  We remember the 100,000 men and women who have given their lives in our name.</p>
<p>I hope as many Australians as possible can participate in Anzac Day ceremonies around our country â and ensure that we are a country not only of memorials, but of memory as well.</p>
<p>19 April 2014</p>
