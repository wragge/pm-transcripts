PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR PRESS 20 APRIL 1977<br />
THE PRIME MINISTER SENT THE FOLLOWING TELEX TO PREMIERS TODAY:<br />
MY DEAR PREMIER, YOU WILL RECALL THAT IN OUR AGREEMENT ON PRICES AND<br />
INCOMES RESTRAINT ALL HEADS OF GOVERNMENTS WERE TO APPROACH<br />
EM*.. 3OYER AND PROFESSIONAL ORGANISATIONS AND PUT TO THEM THE<br />
PROPOSAL THAT THEIR MEMBERSHIP SHOULD VOLUNTARILY COMMIT<br />
TH: 3IMSELVES TO A PAUSE FOR A PERIOD OF THREE MONTHS FROM INCREASES<br />
IN THE PRICES OF THEIR GOODS AND SERVICES. AT THE SAME TIME<br />
AL:, HEADS OF GOVERNMENTS WERE TO MAKE AN APPROACH TO T HE<br />
ACTU AND OTHER EMPLOYEE ORGANISATIONS TO SEEK A VOLUNTARY<br />
COM4MITMENT TO A THREE MONTHS PAUSE FROM WAGE INCREASES. AS YOU<br />
KNOW, I SENT A MESSAGE TO OVER 200 MAJOR NATIONAL EMPLOYER,<br />
EMPLOYEE, PROFESSIONAL AND COMMUNITY ORGANISATIONS SEEKING THEIR<br />
COI'll'ITMENT. I HAVE ALREADY SENT YOU A LIST OF THE TWENTY FIVE<br />
I' 4JOR NATIONAL EMPLOYER ORGANISATIONS WHOSE REPRESENTATIVES MET<br />
WITH ME AND RELEVANT MINISTERS AND INDICATED THEIR WILLINGNESS<br />
TO SUPPORT THE INITIATIVE. IN ADDITION, I HAVE RECEIVED MESSAGES<br />
OF SUPPORT FROM APPROXIMATELY SEVENTY EMPLOYER ORGANISATIONS AND<br />
MAJOR NATIONAL COMPANIES. ON THE QUESTION OF PROFESSIONAL FEES<br />
THE AUSTRALIAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION HAS EFFECTIVELY ADOPTED AN<br />
8 MONTH FREEZE ON DOCTORS' FEES.<br />
I UNDERSTAND THAT STATES HAVE ALSO RECEIVED A POSITIVE<br />
RES; PONSE FROM STATE EMPLOYER ORGANISATIONS. THUS, AS THE<br />
PRE3SIDENT OF THE CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION COMMISSI[ ON SAID<br />
IN THE DECISION YESTERDAY, EMPLOYERS GENERALLY HAVE AG; REED ABOUT<br />
PRIE S. </p>
<p>TODAY I MET WITH REPRESENTATIVES OF PEAK COUNCILS<br />
IN AN ENDEAVOUR TO SEEK THEIR AGREEMENT TO A RECIPROCAL WAGES<br />
PAUSE. IN SUNTIARY, I MUST REPORT THAT THESE REPRESENTATIVES<br />
INDICATED THEIR UNWILLINGNESS TO PROCEED WITHOUT A NATIONAL<br />
CONFERENCE AND A SUBSEQUENT CONFERENCE OF TRADE UNIONSTHE<br />
PEAK COUNCILS ASKED ME TO MEET WITH PREMIERS<br />
AND SEEK THEIR AGREEMENT TO A NATIONAL CONFERENCE ON THIS<br />
MATTER. I INDICATED THAT I WAS PREPARED TO DO SO IF PEAK<br />
COUNCIL REPRESENTATIVES WERE PREPARED TO SUPPORT IN PRINCIPLE<br />
THE OBJECTIVES OF THE HEADS OFGGVERNMENT AGREEMENT EVEN<br />
IF ONLY ON A PERSONAL-BASIS. THIS WAS NO MORE THAN WAS<br />
INDICATED BY ONE PEAK COUNCIL IN YESTERDAY'S PROCEEDINGS<br />
IN THE COMMISSION. OTHER PEAK COUNCIL REPRESENTATIVES WERE<br />
NOT PREPARED TO SUPPORT EVEN IN PRINCIPLE AND FOR THIS<br />
REASON I DECIDED THAT SUCH A NATIONAL CONFERENCE WOULD BE<br />
FUTILE. I BELIEVE THAT THERE IS SUBSTANTIAL COMMUNITY SUPPORT<br />
FOR CONCEPT OF PRICES AuND INCONMES PAUSE. IN VIEW OF<br />
UNWILLINGNESS AND INABILITY OF PEAK EMPLOYEE COUNCILS TO<br />
AGREE ON WAGES PAUSE WOULD YOU BE PREPARED TO JOIN IN AN<br />
APPROACH TO THE CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION COMMISSION TO<br />
USE ITS GOOD OFFICES TO ASSIST IN ACHIEVING THE PRICES<br />
AND INCOMES PAUSE AS ENVISAGED BY-OUR AGREEMENT.<br />
I SHOULD BE GRATEFUL FOR YOUR URGENT REACTION.<br />
YOURS SINCERELY,<br />
M ALCOLM FRASER </p>
<p>PRICES AND Ii" COMES RESTRAINT<br />
The Heads of the Commonwealth and all State Governments,<br />
meeting ' in Premiers' Conference in Canberra today,<br />
unanimously called for a three month halt in.. price and<br />
wage increases. They agreed that such restraint was<br />
urgently needed if Astralia is to overcome its<br />
current econonic nroblems.<br />
It was agreed that all Heads of Governments will approach<br />
employer and professional organisations and put to them<br />
the proposal that their membership should voluntarily<br />
commit themselves to a pause for a period of 3 months<br />
from increases in the prices of their goods and services.<br />
At the same time, all Heads of Governments will be making an<br />
approach to the A. C. T. U. and other employee organisations<br />
to seek a voluntary commitment to a 3 months pause from<br />
wage increases.<br />
Governments would not expect either the business organisations<br />
or the union organisations to agree to such voluntary restraint<br />
arrangements without agreement by the others.<br />
Immediately following agreement to the proposal for a<br />
voluntary general pause from increases in prices and incomes<br />
approaches would be made -to the Arbitration Commission and the<br />
Prices Justification Tribunal for the implementation of the<br />
general pause.<br />
Governments would also use their influence and the.. powers<br />
available to them towards achieving a successful outcome.<br />
Governments will commit themselves to not increasing their<br />
own charges during the period of the pause. Local Government<br />
will be expected to9Tikewise. </p>
<p>k1eI All Heads of Governments coirmiit themselves to work for this<br />
voluntary pause. Upon its achievement a further conference<br />
of H ads of Government will be held to consider what further<br />
steps Should be taken.<br />
The Heads of Governments called on all members of the<br />
Australian co-m-unity to give full support to this vital<br />
endeavour to help overcome inflation.<br />
