<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>(inaudible).</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER HOWARD:</p>
<p>I always have fruitful talks with the New Zealand Prime Minister.  We naturally talked a great deal about the tragedy in Bali which has touched both of our countries, many more Australians died but a number of New Zealanders also and it drives home to both of us the common threat of terrorism in our region and the need for countries such as Australia and New Zealand to continue to work very closely together.  We have in the past, and we';ll continue to do so with a redoubled sense of urgency in the future.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, has terrorism taken over this conference?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER HOWARD:</p>
<p>Terrorism will be a major theme, it hasn';t taken it over and neither it should.  But terrorism affects economic activity, terrorism intimidates people, that';s what it';s designed to do and it';s important that a strong democratic country stare it down and not allow it to interfere it with our normal life whilst taking precautions to protect ourselves.</p>
<p> JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister Clark, what sort of concrete measures do you think need to be taken in the region to stop terrorist attacks?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER CLARK:</p>
<p>I think the critical thing is for cooperation on intelligence information sharing and we have that full cooperation with Australia.  If there';s any way in which our country can work to help Indonesia to build its capacity to deal with the problem, of course we';ll make that effort.  But in the end it';s going to come down to international cooperation.  I think since the Bali conference on people smuggling earlier in the year there has been stepped up cooperation with Indonesia on a number of fronts and one would like to see that prove productive now in getting full cooperation and hunting down the killers who planted these bombs.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister Howard there has in the past been differences, if you like, between Australia and New Zealand on defence issues.  Do you think given the recent events in Bali and trouble in the region New Zealand needs to do more in terms of providing security in the South Pacific?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER HOWARD:</p>
<p>I';ve taken the view ever since I';ve become Prime Minister of Australia of what New Zealand puts in the way of resources for defence is a matter for New Zealand I don';t intend to comment on domestic political issues in New Zealand.  The only further observation I would make is that a number of important areas of activity in the last few years where help from New Zealand has been needed, such as East Timor, that help has been forthcoming, has been very effective and has been very welcome.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister have you got any update on the Australians in Moscow?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER HOWARD:</p>
<p>I don';t have any update, it does appear, beyond confirmation, that there are apparently two involved. One of them is a citizen of Australia and the other one is a permanent resident of Australia. The latest information I have is that they are still safe, although naturally under a great deal of strain and stress, anybody would be in that situation.  There were apparently some discussions underway about releasing non-Russian nationals.  Where that';s got to as we speak I don';t know, clearly it';s a very difficult issue and I have expressed personally in a message to him my feelings and understandings for President Putin, who naturally cancelled his visit to APEC to personally handle the situation and this is another act of terrorism, I am not putting it any more strongly at this stage, I';m not because there is no evidence before me drawing any linkages, but self-evidently it is an act of terrorism to kidnap people and threaten them and to threaten their death and to arm yourself with grenades and all sorts of weaponry can be none other than an act of terrorism.  I remain very concerned for the safety of the Australian citizen and the Australian national, indeed for all of the people there and I wish President Putin well in handling a very difficult position.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
