TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
PRESS CONFERENCE, CANBERRA<br />
13 MARCH 1992<br />
E OE PROOF COPY<br />
PM: Ladies and gentlemen, I just thought that I'd give you<br />
a few preliminary comments and then you can address<br />
questions to me. I thought I'd begin by just asking<br />
Australians to reflect upon how the families of Lloyd<br />
Boney and David Gundy must feel this morning at seeing<br />
these depictions. And I ask them to reflect on what<br />
all Aboriginal people must feel at this disgrace, at<br />
this treatment of them. And I ask Australians how can<br />
we hope to have pride in ourselves when we debase our<br />
values in this way? Because these people in doing what<br />
they have done, have in fact been disloyal to the whole<br />
concept of Australia and the way non-Aboriginal<br />
Australians should relate to Aboriginal Australians.<br />
And I ask to let this incident be a turning point, a<br />
turning point in the way we view this country, and that<br />
is a turning point in us vowing to eliminate racism<br />
from every corner of Australian life.<br />
J: Prime Minister, what do you say further to Australians<br />
who like one of the police officers involved in this<br />
incident, describe it as ' a bit of harmless fun'?<br />
PM: Well, I think it is the most disgraceful taunt I have<br />
seen. The notion of someone mocked up as an Aboriginal<br />
with a rope around their neck is just about the most<br />
disgraceful taunt of a race of people as I can imagine.<br />
J: Doesn't it, though, reflect a more pervasive attitude<br />
within the community, it's not simply two police<br />
officers doing this, this is actually an attitude which<br />
is quite widespread in Australia isn't it, this<br />
attitude to Aboriginals?<br />
PM: There may be, that could well be true, but it has never<br />
in my memory manifested itself quite in this way. But<br />
I think, as I said, we should make this a turning<br />
point. We should decide that we should expunge racism </p>
<p>of every corner of this country to decide that the<br />
notion of Australia, the notion of this country, what<br />
Australia is about is not about this kind of behaviour,<br />
it is not about this kind of racism and to do this is<br />
actually being disloyal to Australia.<br />
J: Prime Minister, is there any suggestion that these men,<br />
whom you've described as a disgrace to Australia, a<br />
national disgrace, have done anything other than with<br />
bad taste? Is there any suggestion they have assaulted<br />
an Aboriginal, responsible for the death of an<br />
Aboriginal, assaulted anybody else, committed any<br />
criminal behaviour?<br />
PM: Well, they have held, I believe, at a critical time in<br />
the history of relations between non-Aboriginal<br />
Australians and Aboriginals they've held Aboriginals up<br />
to ridicule and contempt.<br />
J: Prime Minister, you've been talking a lot about<br />
identity recently. Do you think this is one problem we<br />
have with our own identity, that we often don't like<br />
what we see in ourselves?<br />
PM: Well, I think many Australian have not come to terms<br />
with Australia, not come to terms with the place. And<br />
part of coming to terms with it is a genuine<br />
reconciliation between Aboriginal-Australians and non-<br />
Aboriginal Australians. And that's very much what the<br />
process of reconciliation is about to try and remove<br />
these attitudes to let non-Aboriginal Australians know<br />
that we can't live in this way and can't behave in this<br />
way.<br />
J: Prime Minister, Michael Tate this morning said that<br />
this video would make Australia a laughing stock<br />
whenever we tried representing other countries with<br />
human, or other people that are suffering human rights<br />
abuses, and that the regimes responsible for those<br />
abuses would simply toss this video back in our face.<br />
Can you see it damaging our reputation?<br />
PM: Well, it is certainly not going to help us. And even<br />
though I think most Australians are very conscientious<br />
about this problem and Governments have sought to do<br />
much about it, the issue is as much up here as it is in<br />
the government expenditure or the programs. It is an<br />
attitudinal problem, it is an attitudinal problem,<br />
let's hope this incident will shape the attitudes of<br />
Australians about it.<br />
J: In the statement that you released on this issue, you<br />
said that it was incumbent effectively on white<br />
Australians to close the gap in living standards and to<br />
change attitudes. How does that sit with your<br />
Cabinet's decision to slash quite a considerable amount<br />
of the amount of money that Robert Tickner, the </p>
<p>Aboriginal Affairs Minister, was seeking for<br />
Aborigines?<br />
PM: Well, we've only announced part of that package and<br />
that is the law and justice component of the response<br />
to the Aboriginal Deaths in Custody Royal Commission.<br />
But I think it is very important that all levels of<br />
Government concentrate on this and one of the things<br />
which I will be doing is also talking to the States<br />
about their role in this, their response to the<br />
recommendations of the Royal Commission, their response<br />
to the ongoing problems of living standards of<br />
Aboriginals and in part the, if you like second part,<br />
of what will be presented by the Government in relation<br />
to the response to the Aboriginal Deaths in Custody and<br />
ongoing underlying causes of the problem will be that<br />
which is concluded between the Commonwealth and the<br />
States. We don't want simply minimalist efforts on the<br />
part of the States in response to this problem. And<br />
for the Commonwealth to take the view that it's going<br />
to accept simply a minimalist effort on the part of the<br />
States, both attitudinally and in programs, is I think<br />
not doing the problem of justice. So that's why the<br />
Government will be engaging the States as well as<br />
looking itself more comprehensively at whatever package<br />
we finally announce.<br />
J: So we can expect the full $ 500 million plus<br />
PM: You can expect a statement of substance from the<br />
Government at the time the Government wishes to deliver<br />
it.<br />
J: Mr Keating, won't this damage Australia's international<br />
reputation?<br />
PM: Well that's what you just asked me.<br />
J: Mr Keating, will this engagement of the States be after<br />
the 31 March statement?<br />
PM: It will be between now and then and probably beyond<br />
then, because this is a problem of some complexity in<br />
terms of particularly programs and other issues, other,<br />
if you like, causal links to this problem. So we will<br />
be responding the first instance to the law and justice<br />
elements to the recommendations.<br />
J: Mr Keating won't you require on national response,<br />
though, from the Federal Government, because we have<br />
got problems like this in New South Wales and also<br />
similar problems going on in Western Australia? State<br />
Governments don't see capable of dealing with it?<br />
PM: This is a very long running Royal Commission, its<br />
recommendations are very comprehensive, I think they've<br />
been taken up seriously by the States, and I spoke to<br />
Robert Tickner this morning and he's spoken to the New </p>
<p>South Wales Police Minister and Police Commissioner and<br />
they have indicated they will be responding seriously<br />
to the recommendations of the Royal Commission.<br />
J: Mr Keating, what sort of things do you expect the<br />
States to do to show the bonafides that they are<br />
responding in more than a minimalist way?<br />
PM: The whole living standards, sort of attitudinal issues<br />
involved here are complex, and there is no way I can<br />
just reel off in a second or in a minute of in<br />
minutes responses which I think the States should make.<br />
But we will be talking to the States about it. But<br />
again, there is a heavy responsibility here on the<br />
Commonwealth This will probably the Commonwealth's,<br />
certainly I think last opportunity in this decade, to<br />
do something really substantial about this problem and<br />
we are determined to think about it and get it as right<br />
as we can get it.<br />
J: Do you believe that the electorate, the fact that it<br />
may present, the enormous amount of money that<br />
successive Governments have spent on Aboriginal Affairs<br />
and seemingly to no effect?<br />
PM: I don't believe it is to no effect, but certainly we<br />
haven't dealt with the problem adequately. It is as<br />
much about attitude as it is about money, as I think<br />
this incident demonstrates. But again program helps,<br />
good program design helps and obviously comprehension<br />
of Aboriginal problems helps and trying to bring that<br />
coincidence of a delineational problem and program<br />
delivery is obviously going to help. I don't think<br />
Australians share the view that too much has been spent<br />
here. When the referendum came in 1967, I think it<br />
was, then non-Aboriginal Australians made their<br />
position quite clear about the welfare of Aboriginals<br />
and where they saw constitutional responsibility as<br />
being. And I think governments in the past, and<br />
certainly this Government, this Government has very<br />
strongly increased funding to Aboriginal programs over<br />
the period and I don't believe that non-Aboriginal<br />
Australians should or can take the view that the money<br />
that has been spent has been spent unwisely or in any<br />
way in terms of its volume and size, in a way which is<br />
inconsistent with the problem.<br />
J: Mr Keating, Charles Perkins agrees that we have an<br />
attitudinal problem with Aborigines and he says the<br />
only way we can start to solve that is to look at a<br />
treaty. Do you think these sorts of events add any<br />
weight to that argument?<br />
PM: Look, I think the Reconciliation Council process is<br />
going to be terribly important here. To actually get<br />
down to some of these attitudinal issues, to discuss<br />
them, to find ways of dealing with them, to think about<br />
bringing living standards of Aboriginal people up and </p>
<p>their opportunities, it is closing that gap between<br />
living standards and opportunities which will do more<br />
than anything else to relieve this problem. And that's<br />
something which can be a function of the Government<br />
through ATSIC, it can be a function of the States, it<br />
can be a function of the Reconciliation Council. These<br />
are the things I think we've got to work on.<br />
J: So you still don't think a final document would make an<br />
PM: Well, with the attitudes which are bound in evidence<br />
today, I think that is correct. And that's why I think<br />
the role of the Reconciliation Council is going to be<br />
important and I want to see some material change in<br />
living conditions, bringing up the opportunities in<br />
living standards for Aboriginals and because I believe<br />
that will do more than anything else to relieve the<br />
notion of the burden of this problem.<br />
J: Isn't there a danger in spending more money,<br />
particularly in the time of high unemployment that all<br />
you'll achieve in fact is to bring greater resentment<br />
within the white community, as indeed happened to a<br />
certain extent say in the United States with the<br />
greater spending on the black community there, and the<br />
polarisation between black and white?<br />
PM: I think look, I'm simply relying on my memory, but I<br />
think the programs amount to about $ 5000 per head of<br />
the Aboriginal population of Australia, something of<br />
that variety. I mean I just don't accept the analysis<br />
that that's spent thrift, extravagant, and to be<br />
resented by a non-Aboriginal Australians. I just don't<br />
think it is true. But as I say, the problem is as much<br />
up here as it is in the programs and the living<br />
standards and we have to, I think, come to terms with<br />
it and deal with it before we will ever understand what<br />
Australia is and can be.<br />
