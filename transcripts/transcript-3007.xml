AUSTRALIA PROPOSES CITANG", S TO SOUTH PACIFTC COMTIIllON<br />
Australia has proposed changes in the functions of the<br />
0 South Pacific Commission, aimed at revitalizing the organisation.<br />
These were outlined in an address to the South Pacific<br />
Conference in Guam yesterday by Australia's Special Minister of<br />
State, Senator Willesee, who is leader of the Australian<br />
delegation to the conference.<br />
Senator Willesee proposed that from 1975 there should<br />
be a de facto merger of the South Pacific Commission and the<br />
Conference sessions.<br />
At present, membership of the Commission comprises<br />
Australia, New Zealand, France, the United Kingdom, the United<br />
States, Fiji, Nauru and Western Samoa. The Conference sessions<br />
are attended by all the territories and independent island States,<br />
as well as the metropolitan Dowers, but the latter do not vote.<br />
Senator Willesee said that since 1947, when the<br />
Canberra Agreement had led to the formation of the South Pacific / 2 </p>
<p>-2-<br />
Commission, the Pacific " has been washed by the tides of change."<br />
" In 1947 no island entity in this region was a State,"<br />
he said. " None could be a signatory to the Canberra Agreement.<br />
Today three are full members of the Commission Western Smaoa,<br />
Nauru and Fiji and one or two more such as Panua New Guinea<br />
could, if they so desire, be shortly."<br />
Senator Willesee continued: " Today we face the fact<br />
that we are meeting here under the terms of an Agreement which<br />
has been of considerable value but which is increasingly<br />
anachronistic." He said that the 1947 Agreement, seen retrospectively,<br />
was and remained a oaternalistic document. It saw the Pacific<br />
world was divided between controlling metropolitan powers and<br />
their subject colonies, and had not even foreshadowed the<br />
possibility of any of those colonies becoming independent and<br />
hence members of the Commission.<br />
The Australian Government believed that the time had<br />
come to bring the nrovisions of the Canberra Ag-reement or if<br />
that should prove imnossible its practices, up to date.<br />
It was ag-ainst this background that Australia had<br />
proposed changes in the Commission's functions. </p>
