FOR MEDIA THURSDAY, MAY 1. 1980<br />
GREAT BARRIER REEF<br />
The Prime Minister answered a question on the Great Barrier Reef<br />
in Parliament today, as follows:<br />
Mr Moore:<br />
I ask whether the Prime Minister's attention has been drawn to<br />
claims that the seas and submerged lands package undermines<br />
the Commonwealth: Goverriment's capacity, t'o protect-the Great<br />
Barrier Reef. Are these claims correct?.<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
The claims that have been made in that regard are totally wrong.<br />
In clear and unequivocal statements, both. inside and outside<br />
the House,-the -Commonwealth Government' has made it plain that<br />
we will not permit exploration for petroleum in the Great Barrier<br />
Reef region. We will not permit the renewal of petroleum<br />
exploration in the region until the results of both shorL and<br />
longer term research into the reef's ecosystem are known. This<br />
follows our decision in the report of the Royal Commission into<br />
petroleum drilling in the area of the Great Barrier Reef itself.<br />
Those decisions were very clearly announced in this House on<br />
4 June of last year. On 14 June the Premier of Queensland and<br />
I confirmed that it is the policy of both of our governments<br />
to prohibit any drilling on the reef or any drilling or mining<br />
which could in any way damage the reef. Those policy decisions<br />
are binding on both the Commonwealth Government and the<br />
Queensland government.<br />
The rights and title to be vested in the State of Queensland<br />
as a result of our initiatives in the Seas and Submerged Lands<br />
Act exercise are very clearly subject to the Great Barrier Reef<br />
Marine Park Act.<br />
The powers of the Commonwealth under that Act remain supreme.<br />
Thev are untouched by the package which has been introduced.<br />
I think that is the main point to emphasise in this matter<br />
because there hs been-a suggestion that the legislation which<br />
has been introduced touces upon, and di. inis-., oui. c. pacity<br />
to protect the reef through the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park<br />
Act, and it does not do that. / 2 </p>
<p>2<br />
Our responsibilities and powers in respect to the Great Barrier<br />
Reef Marine Park Act are in no waiy diminished as a result of the<br />
Seas and Submerged Lands Act exerc: ise. The policy of the<br />
Commonwealth is very clear. We are progressively declaring<br />
sections of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, and by the<br />
end of this year I would expect that about one quarter of the<br />
length of the reef of 2,000 kilometres will be marine park.<br />
We are taking advice fromthe Marine Park Authority. It is<br />
. a Commonwealth/ State body but the powers are virtually the<br />
Commonwealth's under Commonwealth legislation, As recommendations<br />
are received from that body we are acting to have marine parks<br />
declared. That will be the continuing policy of the Government.<br />
We have given greater support to the Great Barrier Reef Marine<br />
Park Authority. Last year it started off with a staff of 18.<br />
That was increased, at the request of the Authority to 29.<br />
The staff is to be increased to 44. I think there is a limit,<br />
in a new body of this kind, to the rate at which it can assimilate<br />
staff and usefully direct them to their proper functions and<br />
responsibilities. But the growth of the staff of the Authority<br />
shows very clearly the importance and priority which this<br />
Commonwealth Government places on these particular matters.<br />
In no formal way has the statement that was issued by the<br />
Premier of Queensland and me on 14 June ever been formally<br />
brought to the notice of this House, and in a moment I would<br />
like to seek authority to have the statement incorporated in<br />
Hansard so that the record on the matter can be complete.<br />
Again I would like to emphasise that that statement indicated<br />
that what we are doing will be the same for Queensland as for<br />
the other States, but with full regard to the Great Barrier<br />
Marine Park Act and to the Prime Minister's Parliamentary<br />
statement of 4 June on Petroleum Exploration on the Great<br />
Barrier Reef. The statement pointed out that both the Premier<br />
and the Prime Minister confirmed that it was the policy of<br />
their respective qovernments to prohibit any drilling on<br />
the reef or any drilling or mining which coul. damage the reef.<br />
The relevant part of that statement reads:<br />
Both the Premier and the Prime Minister confirmed<br />
that it was the policies of their respective governments<br />
to prohibit any drilling on the Reef<br />
or any drilling or mining which could damage the Reef.<br />
A moment ago there was an interjection which indicated that the<br />
joint statement from the Premier and me does not have the force<br />
of law. But what does have the force of law is the Great Barrier<br />
Reef Marine Park Act and the Authority established under that Act<br />
which will be totally unimpaired as a result of the package of<br />
measures which is now before the House. The measures thaL are<br />
now before the House pay due regard to the Act and to that<br />
Auhority . Einrl make it perfectl% plain that that Act and that<br />
Authority will stand supreme in relation to the protection of<br />
the reef.<br />
The Australian Labor Party is being purely mischievous in seeking<br />
to suggest otherwise. So that tI&amp; record may be complete, and<br />
so that I will not need to read the statemenlt of 14 June to the<br />
House in full, I ask that it be incorpotated in Hansard. </p>
