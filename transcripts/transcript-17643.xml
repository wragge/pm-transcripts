Prime Minister Julia Gillard today announced the Government would provide an emergency flight out of Cairo to Europe for Australians affected by the unrest in Egypt.</p>
<p>The charter flight is being arranged with Qantas and will depart Cairo on Wednesday to take affected Australians to either Frankfurt or London.</p>
<p>Australians wishing to register for the charter should contact the DFAT Consular Emergency Centre on +61 2 6261 3305 (if calling from overseas) or 1300 555 135 (if calling from within Australia). </p>
<p>Further details of Wednesday's charter flight are currently being finalised, with additional charter flights to be arranged if necessary.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister said the charter flight would be provided free of charge as part of the Government's response to this evolving situation.</p>
<p>Australians taking up this option will be responsible for arranging their onward travel from Europe, but consular officials will be on hand to assist travellers in need.</p>
<p>The airport in Cairo remains open and commercial flights are departing, although significant disruption and delays may be experienced. </p>
<p>Departure by commercial flights remains an option for Australians with a confirmed booking who are able to travel safely to the airport.</p>
<p>Australian officials will be at the airport in Cairo today and in coming days to provide advice and assistance to Australians.</p>
