My dear Premicr<br />
ran writing to Intorn you cf tthe acute concern of my<br />
Cover-ncrjt at your Goverraicnt'!; handlig of the<br />
industrial dispute is the electricity industry in your<br />
State.<br />
Altho( 4gh I appreciate the great inpcrtaa. ze of etuijrng c<br />
reliable supply of electricity, I do not believe it is<br />
necessary to adopt the appioach taken by your Govc'r. nent<br />
h in order to achieve that end. I also note that your<br />
Governnents. response has extended beyond the<br />
circumstances of that dispute to i; pse a nunber of ne<br />
legislative rer.! rictiors on uniron activity.<br />
Indeed, I am concerned that, ! ar fron resolving the<br />
plectricity industry dispute, and putting industrai<br />
relations in Stte on a sounder basis, your<br />
Government's actions have raised the distlnct<br />
posib1ty sf nation-wide disputation and stoppages,<br />
r. nd may therefore prove to be quite counterproductive.<br />
4 Such dcvelopents would put at risk the very nubstantial<br />
gains we have made as a natlon in the last twu years in<br />
terms of economic recovery, national unit and enhanced<br />
international recogtnition.<br />
Although I respect the right of a State Government to<br />
conduct its own affairs, the Conrrceatri can. ot ignore<br />
action3 which are likely to have severe cfects, not<br />
only on Queens&amp; and's economy, but also or that of our<br />
nation. Your Governmnts actions, which now threaten<br />

<p>ATTACHMENT A<br />
PREACHES BY QUEENSLAND INDUSTRIAL LEGISLATION OF INTERNATIONAL<br />
TREATIES TO WHICH AUSTRALIA IS A PARTY<br />
Forced Labour Convention, 1930 ( ILO Convention No. 29)<br />
Abolition of Forced Labour Convention, 1957 ( ILO Convention No. 105)<br />
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights<br />
Under section 3 of the Electricity ( Continuity of Supply) Act<br />
1985, the Electricity Commissioner is given &amp; n extremely wide<br />
power to direct any person whom he considers capable of<br />
carrying out the necessary work, to perform work to provide,<br />
maintain or restore a supply of electricity.<br />
Under section 4 of the Act, employees of the Queensland<br />
Electricity Commission or of an Electricity Board are liable<br />
to a penalty for non-compliance with such a direction. While<br />
it appears that no penalty attaches to non-compliance by<br />
other persons, they may underrtandably feel under the menace<br />
of a penalty, at least until there is a judicial<br />
determination on the matter.<br />
These . provisiono are too wide to be permissible under ' LO<br />
Convention No. 29 wnicn requires the ouppre3sion of the use<br />
of forced or compulsory labour. Although some exceptions are<br />
per-itted under the C: nvention, the legislation . is not<br />
confined to the circumstances covered by the per-. isslble<br />
exc
Tht pc-wer to direct rry be exercised, even when real<br />
em-r. qency exists, to require non-employees to perform work,<br />
or to require emplnoy'es to perform work outside the norm-na<br />
scope of their emplyrent.<br />
j </p>
<p>To the extent that the legislation does enable the power to<br />
be exercised in those ways, it authorises ' forced or<br />
compulsory labour' contrary to ILO Convention No. 29 and the<br />
existence of the legislation constitutes a broach of that<br />
Convent ion.<br />
moreover, the power io wide enough to authorise forced or<br />
comrpulsory labour of kinds specified in ILO Convention<br />
105. Among other things, the Convention prohibits the<br />
use of forced or compulsory labour as a means of labour<br />
discipline or as a punishment for having participated in<br />
strikes. To that extent, the existence of the legislation is<br />
in breach of that Convention.<br />
. Article 8.3 of the International Covenant on Civil ancr<br />
Political Rights also proscribes fo.=: od or compulsory labour.<br />
Although provision is made in Article 8.3 for certuin<br />
exceptions, the power of direcLion mentioned above la not<br />
limited to circumstances falling within those exceptions. To<br />
the extent that the legislation exceeds the scope permisnible<br />
under Article 8.3, its existence constitutes a breach of that<br />
provision.<br />
Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Ornanie<br />
Convention, 1949 ( ILO Convention No. 87)<br />
International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rinhts<br />
Under section 7 of the Electricity ( Continjity cof Sjp; y) Act<br />
1985, there is effectively a prohibition on strike a: tivIty<br />
in the electricity industry. In addition, the Ele: tr;: ity<br />
Authorities Industrial Causes Act 1985 makes particip::; n in<br />
a relevant strike an ' illegal' act and inp. ires a djty t<br />
refrain from participating in certain strikes. E. pl: yces<br />
participating in a ' strike' ( as defined) in the ele: tricity<br />
industry are subject to an automatic loss of pay, anrt, at the<br />
employer's option, to dismissal or suspension withtp.: pay.<br />
7 j -77 I c </p>
<p>ILO Convention No. 87 guarantees the right of workers to<br />
further and defend their occupational interests. The Freedom<br />
of Asoociation Committee of the Governing Body of the ILO<br />
(' the Co--ittee") has said on a nu? 9ser of occasions that the<br />
right to strike is a legitimate means of exorcising thic<br />
right.<br />
The Committee has also recognised that the right to strike<br />
may be restricted or prohibited in the civil service or in<br />
essential services because a strike there could cause serious<br />
: hardship to the community. However, the Committee has atated<br />
that where there is such a restriction it should be<br />
accompanied by adequate, impartial and speedy conciliation<br />
and arbitration procedures in which the parties can<br />
participate at evory stage and in which " awards are Dinding in<br />
all cases on both parties. These ards, once made, should<br />
be fully and promptly implemented.<br />
It may be that the Electricity Authorities Industril Causes<br />
Tribunal established by the Electricity Authorities<br />
Industrial Causes Act 1985 is able to employ such<br />
conciliation and arbitration procedures in relation to the<br />
matters coming within its jurisdiction. However, that<br />
tribunal has no jurisdiction to relieve employees of the<br />
sanctilons referred to above. Moreover, there is no court or<br />
other body independent of the employer, the Minister or the<br />
Electricity Commissioner, as the case m: y be, can<br />
determine whether an em. loyee on whz&gt;-. sanctions been<br />
imposed has, in ' act, participated in a relevant strike [ see<br />
es. 28( 4) and 29( 4) of the Electricity Auth-) riti-. Industrial<br />
Causes Act 1985 which oust the juris:!. ction o! , ri courts).<br />
Those e eents of the State legia]' tiorn do not co. mply with<br />
the rights protected under the provi s ons of ILn Convention<br />
No. 8" f. Furthermore, the lack of pro'-ision for resort to a<br />
court or other independent body in relation to the imposition<br />
m </p>
<p>of sanctions conflicts wich Article 7 of the International<br />
Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights which<br />
requireo the provision of ' just nnd favourable conditions of<br />
work'. Another breach of ILO Convention No. 87 occurs by virtue of<br />
the now provisions eno: ted in the Industrial Conciliation and<br />
Arbitration Act Amendment Act 1985 relating to the<br />
canc: ellation and suspension of the registration of a union.<br />
There is insufficient scope for con sid-ration by an<br />
independent tribunal of the substtnce of a case against a<br />
union in relation to the grounds for can: ellation or<br />
suspension.<br />
Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention, 1949<br />
( ILO Conventiori No. 98)<br />
The existence of on. 3 and 4 of the Electricity ( Continuity<br />
of Supply) Act 1985, which respectively confer powers that<br />
extend to the giving of directions to union members as such,<br />
and ismpose penalties for non-compliance, constitutes a breach<br />
of this ILO Convention.<br />
Other Com. ents: The list given above does not purport tr, be<br />
exhaustive. Further Commonwealth examination may disclose other<br />
breaches. Moreover, even where the existence of legislation<br />
itself is not a breach, the exercise of powers or the taking of<br />
other a: tion under the legislation to be examiriod to<br />
consider whether it constituted a bre;. of international<br />
oblig. t ions men'ti.-ned above or of any international<br />
ohli ions. 3 a<br />
