TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P. J. KEATING MP<br />
OPENING REMARKS, PREMIERS CONFERENCE, PARLIAMENT HOUSE,<br />
CANBERRA, FRIDAY, 25 MARCH 1994<br />
1 would like to declare our meeting open and to welcome everybody to it. It is not that<br />
long since we met at the Council of Australian Governments and we are all pleased to<br />
be able to say at the conclusion of that discussion that it was a good co-operative<br />
outcome and that we are able to advance a number of major things in the economy and<br />
the country in a way that some of the sceptics thought we might not be able to do.<br />
It is an innovation separating the financial Premiers Conference and the issues of<br />
finance from other issues between the Commonwealth and the States in areas, say, of<br />
the micro-economy; in the things which we have been doing in technical and further<br />
education; or in water; or in gas; or in electricity because in years past while some of<br />
these items came on the agenda of the Premiers Conference given that it often took us<br />
time to get through the financial discussions there was not the opportunity to be able<br />
to range over the things that we are doing together and need to do together of the<br />
variety I just mentioned.<br />
It seems that the Council of Australian Governments structure -and the division of<br />
discussion between the financial meeting and the policy meeting, if you like, is working<br />
for us and we are getting a much better co-operative understanding between us and we<br />
are able to do things that we might not have been able to do individually or have been<br />
able to do together.<br />
So, we meet with at least a new structure now starting to gather in some maturity<br />
about itself and we meet also at a time which is, I think, pretty obvious that we have a<br />
fairly strongly improving economy, at a time when we can look forward to a pick up in<br />
growth and activity and with concomitant low inflation. This is something we have not<br />
been able to look forward to any of us during most of our political lives and this<br />
happens to be true at the moment. There was quite a bit of comfort to be taken from<br />
last quarter's National Accounts the December quarter National Accounts published<br />
a week or so ago. Apart from the growth figure of 4 per cent and the acceleration in<br />
growth over the course of the year, what I thought was most compelling about the<br />
numbers was that on the broadest measure of inflation, the non-farm GDP deflator,<br />
broader even than the CPI, we had inflation sitting at 1.4 or 1.5 per cent which was </p>
<p>pretty encouraging. Now, a pick up in commodity prices which feeds into the nonfarm<br />
deflator will lift that a bit, but with the CPI running at under 2 per cent and the<br />
non-farm deflator running at 1.5 per cent it is fair to say that we have got a very solid<br />
scene on inflation and that has given us a fairly solid scene on interest rates which is<br />
important to all of us because we know the influence the interest rates have in the<br />
economy.<br />
There has been some talk about interest rates and movements in interests rates and the<br />
Treasurer has made a couple of points that are probably worth remarking here about<br />
the United States. It is true that the United States have lifted their bank rate or<br />
discount rate by a quarter of a per cent and there is some speculation that there is a<br />
further quarter or half per cent in the pipe line. But, it is worth recalling that their rate<br />
is now down to three and one quarter per cent and they have lifted it to three and a half<br />
per cent. So they are barely covering the inflation rate; their interest rates are barely<br />
covering the inflation rate. It is almost like it was in the 1970s where you had negative<br />
rates of interest, there were people able to borrow at less than the inflation rate. Well,<br />
in the United States it is barely above the inflation rate and the other thing is the United<br />
States has got unemployment now down to around 6.5 per cent and in the US full<br />
employment is somewhere between, probably, 5 and 6 per cent. Some would say full<br />
employment, structural employment in the US is 6 per cent, so the United States is in a<br />
position where it is nearing fuill employment and there is not too much spare capacity<br />
in plant and equipment. Because a large part of the weight of American public<br />
economic policy is on monetary policy and not on fiscal policy despite the success of<br />
President Clinton introducing a diminishing budget deficit, there is still a huge<br />
financing task in the funding of the American deficits and the American Federal<br />
Reserve Bank is still carrying a lot of the weight.<br />
This is not true in Australia because of the good financial scene we have had in the<br />
1980s, federally and with the states, and our fiscal scene is much, much better so the<br />
balance between fiscal and monetary policy in this country is so much better than is the<br />
case in the United States.<br />
So, it is not therefore unlikely that the American Federal Reserve Bank and its<br />
Governor would keep a weathered on eye on inflation and look at interest rates. That<br />
does not mean that the parallels with Australia should immediately be drawn because<br />
we are a long way from full employment in this country, with unemployment running<br />
with a 10 in front of it 10 per cent something and with full employment at least<br />
down where the Americans regard it as being, we have got a lot of spare resources in<br />
people and we have got a lot of spare resources in terms of plant and equipment. Our<br />
capacity utilisation levels are still relatively low. There was a lot of invested capacity<br />
put in in the 1 980s, so we have got a lot of spare capacity in plant and equipment and<br />
we have got a lot of spare capacity in the labour market. All that means to us, that if<br />
we can keep the inflation rate down where we have it, we have a very good<br />
opportunity of having attendant interest rates which will keep the recovery going.<br />
So, therefore, fiscal policy will remain important in the 1990s as it was in the 1980s<br />
and it is the reason why we are now talking about bringing the Budget deficit down to<br />
around I per cent of GDP by 1996 because as the recovery picks up, as private<br />
investment picks up, it has got to be funded from the national pool of savings </p>
<p>somewhere and the best way to augment that pooi is to diminish the Government's call<br />
on that savings pooi and hence our objective of trying to get that down.<br />
The other significant thing worth mentioning in the Accounts was that exports grew<br />
per cent over the year and imports grew by 3 per cent. So, what has happened in<br />
the 1980s is as we opened the economy up, as we broke the tariff wall down, as we<br />
made it capable of having a much more open product market there was a big pick up in<br />
imports as the import penetration ratio rose, as it has done in every other country<br />
where such openings occur but, once it gets to an optimum, in a sense then which<br />
happened in the course of the 1980s, now it is a matter for judgement about where in a<br />
recovery those imports will run.<br />
Well, in a recovery today, exports as I say are growing 6.5 per cent over the year,<br />
imports by 3 per cent, the other statistic worth remembering is that the debt service<br />
ratio the thing that has occupied us perhaps most as Premiers and Treasurers in the<br />
last half dozen years, that was the current account deficit and the attendant debt the<br />
debt service component of our exports, that is the proportion of our exports which we<br />
used to service the debt the nation has, has fallen from 21 per cent in 1986 to I11 per<br />
cent today. So, there is a very large change in the debt service component of our<br />
exports. Our exports are growing and they are growing in these areas of elaborately<br />
transformed goods.<br />
As well as that, the accounts also had 200,000 job growth across the year which means<br />
we are well and truely on the way of getting a bit of growth moving.<br />
Now, all of that means that we are in an upswing in the cycle, we do need to keep our<br />
eye on inflation, fiscal policy has got a player role, monetary policy at the moment<br />
certainly should basically encourage more investment in the economy and any outcome<br />
of anything we decide here today and the Budget subsequently will help in that result.<br />
Can I say that therefore the relationship we have and we have engendered together is<br />
important to giving confidence in the community and particularly the business<br />
community about where we are going and what we are doing. We are getting a lot of<br />
things done, I mean, the National Training Authority which we put into place a couple<br />
of years ago is now becoming very significant. It's very clear to all of us, I think, that<br />
in terms of training and education in the community and the economy that TAFE,<br />
formerly the Cinderella of Australian education, is going to play a much stronger role<br />
and it's because we've been able to do these things. Or the National Rail Coporation,<br />
for the first time we're going to have a national rail highway which we've not had<br />
before, which is going to take pressure off the roads and put competition back into<br />
transport. Or electricity or any of the other things we've been talking about gas and<br />
water etc.<br />
So, it is a time, I think, where we've all recognised that none of us can do these things<br />
alone, that we've got to do them together. And that means that we have to have a total<br />
relationship and I don't want to pull anyone's leg by trying to overblow it, by talking<br />
about a new relationship here or new federalism or anything else. But, I think a good<br />
cooperative is what we need. So, therefore, at this meeting the Commonwealth<br />
government has taken some notice, substantial notice I might say, of the things you've </p>
<p>said to us about certainty and assurity in Commonwealth payments to the states. And,<br />
what we have proposed here to you, today, is a funding formula we've never had<br />
before and that is that we offer the states a real terms per capita guarantee. That is,<br />
that we offer the states a funding formula based on real ternms funding with a national<br />
population factor in the pool. And that population factor will expand the pool and<br />
therefore then the distribution of that pool will then devolve to population shifts within<br />
Australia as measured by the Grants Commission under its formulae and the<br />
distribution will depend upon relativities which the Grants Commission will<br />
recommend from time to time. But the pool will be bigger by virtue of the fact that it<br />
has a per capita guarantee.<br />
Now, I know that some have argued, well look what we really need is a share of<br />
Commonwealth income tax. Could I just say from our point of view, we don't think<br />
that's been argued very hard. And the reason we don't think that's been argued very<br />
hard is because we think most of you are pretty smart and you know what that means.<br />
What it means is and what it would have meant in the last couple of years is that<br />
the states would have lost two to three billion in revenue through the recession. And,<br />
whatever any of us think of your budgets there is no way the states could wear a<br />
funding hit of that proportion. Now, if we'd had it there, I think one wouldn't be<br />
exaggerating by saying if we had a share of tax revenue sitting there and we had in any<br />
offer document, as a consequence of that, very large reductions in payments to the<br />
states not unreasonably premiers and treasurers would be saying to us, " Look, we can't<br />
run our budgets with this sort of a loss. So, at least you're going to have to give us the<br />
same nominal or the same real as last year." And we'd say, " Well, hang on you signed<br />
up to a formula and the formula is running very much against the states," that we'd be<br />
facing the practicality of the delivery of your services, as you would be and the<br />
likelihood is that we'd come to some agreement about the within year problem.<br />
All that leads us to believe that the Commonwealth would carry the down side but the<br />
states would then carry away the upside revenue growth in the years of recovery, as<br />
now. Except for this one point and that is that the Commonwealth is carrying the<br />
natural stabilisers in the economy. This budget has shifted from a budget surplus of $ 8<br />
billion to a budget deficit of $ 14 billion. It's a $ 22 billion dollar shift. And that $ 22<br />
billion dollar shift has put a great cushioning into the economy and one of the reasons<br />
we're growing faster now than most countries bar for a decimal point as fast as<br />
any country in the world is because, I think, that the natural stabilisers and the stance<br />
of fiscal policy has worked. Therefore, the Commonwealth has got to be in a position<br />
to be able to meet the deficit accumulations in the good times, when the good times<br />
come. Whereas the fluctuations in Commonwealth revenue are not mirrored in the<br />
same amplitude in state budgets.<br />
So, we think what the states need, not unreasonably, is a set of payments which have a<br />
predictability about them and also have some growth about them. And, real terms and<br />
population seems, to us, to get to that point and then the upsides which might come<br />
and which all governments look forward to, will come in your revenue base which will<br />
reflect the growing improvement in the economy across a whole range of state taxes<br />
and charges. So, there will be a buoyancy in state revenues, as there will be this year<br />
but the Commonwealth payments as part of those revenues should be reasonably<br />
certain, at least maintained in real terms and at least covering the population growth in </p>
<p>the country. This will cost us, over the course of this three years, more than a real<br />
terms guarantee would have cost us if it's in for three the likelihood of it not being<br />
then the permanent funding formula or at least the base into the future is, I think, is a<br />
very diminished likelihood. That is, that the real terms per capita guarantee becomes<br />
the norm.<br />
Now, Ralph ( Willis) had a number he mentioned to me yesterday, over a period of ten<br />
years it amounts to $ 9 billion additional fuinding in the financial assistance grants but<br />
net of the capital it's $ 6 billion. So, therefore, we think it's got some value to it and we<br />
hope you do as well. But, more than that we hope you think we've listened to what<br />
you've had to say and tried to come to something reasonable about it. Can I just say in<br />
terms of year three of the current formula year three adds about $ 220 million to our<br />
forward estimates because of the formula. So, the result is total net payments to the<br />
states excluding TAFE and special debt repayments increase by 2.1 percent<br />
nominal this year. And, this is a year when your revenues are going to pick up fairly<br />
strongly.<br />
Part of the offer, and Ralph will probably come to this, is the capital works program,<br />
rolling the capital works program into the financial assistance grants. Now, this does<br />
affect people advantageously in some respects, disadvantageously in others. But, this<br />
program came from the 1930s, it came from a time when some states were not able to<br />
borrow at home or abroad and the Commonwealth borrowed for them and then sent<br />
proceeds on to them. When I became Treasurer I11 years ago this program was worth<br />
the better part of $ 1.5 to $ 2 billion dollars; it's now down to $ 333 million in a FAGS<br />
pool of about $ 14 billion. So, it has no relevance today the historic shares of the<br />
capital works program or the on budget loan program or the governmental program, it<br />
has had different names over the years the historic shares today mean nought in<br />
terms of the realities in terms of say, a Grants Commission recommendation. So we<br />
think this is the time to basically roll it into FAGS because it has got to go at some<br />
time and try and deal with the attendant effects. So, then at least we're only talking<br />
about Financial Assistance Gra nts and we can apply then the real terms per capita<br />
formula to that pool into the future. So, it's something that probably should have been<br />
done in the past, better late than never and probably better now as we're going to go to<br />
a longer term funding formula with population.<br />
So, could I complete my remarks by, again, saying how much I appreciated the<br />
atmospherics of our last meeting, the cooperative we've done particularly the work<br />
on Elmer and look forward to the work that will come back to us in August for<br />
that. I hope that, as a result of these arrangements we can go from here on to a<br />
fuinding formula which is less about a discussion here annually about money because<br />
you'll pretty well know what it is before you come. And, the discussion will then be<br />
about, really, Grants Commission relativities. Now, there's a big influence on Grants<br />
Commission reports now, I understand that. Part of that is the return of funds to the<br />
larger states of NSW and Victoria. They claim, and they have claimed for years in<br />
here, that they were, to use the colloquialism, dudded by the formula over the years.<br />
There was a review of the formula and the methodology and as a consequence of that<br />
there's been a shift back in that, as indeed, there are different population effects taking<br />
place and different population movements. </p>
<p>6<br />
So, I guess that the Grants Commission matter will be on the table whenever a Grants<br />
Commission report is presented, about the distribution of the pool. But, at least we<br />
ought to get to a point where the pool itself is not under examination and discussion<br />
every year that we know what the pool formula is going to be and that's, I think, the<br />
certainty which the offer today brings to you probably for the first time certainly in the<br />
last 11 years. So, could I conclude on those notes, welcome you again to the meeting,<br />
each and every one of you. I think the Treasurer would like to add to my remarks and<br />
then I would invite you all to respond. Thank you Ralph.<br />
Ends. </p>
