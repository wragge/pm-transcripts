FOR PPRESS: PM. No. 48/ 1972<br />
VISIT BY PRINCESS fMARGARET<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister, the Rt. Hon. William<br />
McMahon, M. P.<br />
The following statement has been released from Kensington<br />
Palace today:-" The Princess Nargaret Countess of Snowdon and the<br />
Earl of Snowdon have accepted with very much pleasure<br />
invitations from the Australian Government and the<br />
State Government of Western Australia to visit Western<br />
Australia in October next.<br />
Her Royal Highness has not before visited Australia<br />
and is expected to spend about a week in Western<br />
Australia following her visit to the Seychelles".<br />
The Princess Margaret and the Earl of Snowdon are expected<br />
to arrive in Perth in the early part of the second week of October.<br />
Consultations will now take place to prepare a programme of<br />
engagements for the visit and these details will be publicly<br />
announced when an approved programme has been decided.<br />
The Princess Margaret has always had a high place in the<br />
affections of the Australian people and her visit with her husband<br />
will be widely and warmly welcomed. I am delighted that they are<br />
able to come.<br />
From among her many interests in Au3tralia, the Princess is<br />
Colonl-in-Chief of the Women's Royal Australian Army Corps,<br />
President of the Girl Guides' Association, the Dr. Barnardo's Homes<br />
and the Victoria League for Commonwealth Friendship, and Grand<br />
President of the St. John Association and Drigade.<br />
There will be disappointment that the visit by Her Royal<br />
Highness and her husband will not extend beyond Western Australia.<br />
But as is well known, the pattern in recent years has been to aim<br />
for shorter and less formal Royal Visits.<br />
CANBERRA, 14 May, 1972. </p>
