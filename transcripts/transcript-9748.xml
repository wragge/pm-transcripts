OFFICE OF THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
CANBERRA<br />
FRENCH NUCLEAR TESTING<br />
Since the Opposition today in statements by Mr Howard, Mr Downer,<br />
Mr Fischer and Mr Taylor has chosen to respond to the French nuclear test<br />
in a blatantly party political and cynical way it may be worth remembering<br />
Mr Howard's initial response to the French decision to resume testing<br />
( attached).<br />
CANBERRA 6 SEPTEMBER 1995 </p>
<p>TRANSCRIPT OF THE LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION DOORSTOP,<br />
CAIRNS COUNCIL CHAMBERS, 14 JUNE 1995 EXTRACT<br />
JH: any reasonable, diplomatic moves and protests which the<br />
Federal Government wants to take will have our full support.<br />
J: Would that go as far as say, withdrawing the Ambassador from Paris?<br />
JH: Well, I think, that's a little premature at this stage.<br />
J: Tim Fischer was suggesting this morning the possibility of a consumer<br />
boycott of French goods. Do you endorse that?<br />
JH: Well, we'll talk about the matter this morning.<br />
LATER THE SAME<br />
JH: I support the recall of our Ambassador for consultations. I am<br />
keeping the situation under review. I have discussed it with Alexander<br />
Downer and I will be discussing the matter with my other colleagues<br />
again next week. But certainly what the Government has done so<br />
far is an appropriate response.<br />
J: What about trade sanctions?<br />
JH: I wouldn't, at this stage, be arguing for trade sanctions. I understand<br />
also that some people have called, and I certainly agree with them as<br />
individuals, to boycott things. It is one of those situations that you<br />
have got to keep under review and just the response today is not<br />
necessarily the final response. Sometimes in these matters what<br />
you should do is give an initial response and if that doesn't<br />
produce any result, then you might consider a further response<br />
and it is never smart in those situations to fire all your shots at<br />
once.<br />
