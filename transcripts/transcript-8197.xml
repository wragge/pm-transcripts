PRIM AMTAINISTE<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF' SPEECH AT DEPARTURE OF HMAS SYDNEY, GARDEN<br />
ISLAND, SYDNEY, 12 NOVEMBER 1990<br />
E OE PROOF ONLY<br />
Commander Cordner, members of the company of HMAS Sydney<br />
and ladies and gentlemen.<br />
I'm here on behalf of the Government and the people<br />
of Australia to give you, members of the ship's company,<br />
a very simplE-message. That is this, to wish you bon<br />
voyage and a safe return.<br />
I want you to know that, overwhelmingly, the people of<br />
Australia, and indeed of the world at large, are united<br />
in their conviction that the invasion and annexation of<br />
Kuwait by Iraq is an unacceptable action in terms of the<br />
maintenance of a reasonable world. It's something that<br />
cannot be all. owed to stand. I, and the Government, and<br />
the people of this country, and indeed the people of the<br />
world, overwhelmingly, have the hope that this action of<br />
Saddam Hussei~ n will be brought to an end by peaceful<br />
means. Indeed, I want you to know, members of this ship's<br />
company, thait this mission on which you're embarking now<br />
is the most important part of trying to give effect to<br />
that hope of a peaceful resolution of this dispute. For<br />
indeed the enforcement of the sanctions that have been<br />
imposed, under the United Nations, remain the strongest<br />
hope for bringing about a peaceful resolution to this<br />
situation. And indeed, you would know and you would,<br />
like I am, be proud of the way in which your predecessors<br />
the Darwin arid Adelaide have been over there doing a<br />
magnificent -job in playing their part with others in<br />
imposing this embargo successfully. They have, as I've<br />
said, done their ships, -done.. this great Navy and they've<br />
done this great nation considerable credit in their<br />
service. And I know, my friends, that when you arrive<br />
there you will do the same thing.<br />
I repeat, that it is a matter of pride for all of us in<br />
this country that we have such fine ships, that we have<br />
such great crews and great leadership. That we're able<br />
to call upon as a nation, at this time, when we as<br />
Australia seek to play our part in ensuring that we're<br />
going to have a world which can be a peaceful world where </p>
<p>4 2.<br />
small nations: are going to be able to live in peace and<br />
sure that they are not going to be taken over by<br />
aggressive neighbours. Those are fundamentally important<br />
principles and they are principles that we have to be<br />
prepared to make commitments to achieve.<br />
So that, my friends, is the message, as I say, that I<br />
bring to you on behalf of the Government, across the<br />
whole political spectrum. Dr Hewson's here, Mr Greiner,<br />
this is the whole of Australia governments, opposition,<br />
all of the people.<br />
I want you to know that you leave Australia and go on<br />
your mission with the wholehearted support of all of us<br />
and you take our wishes for a safe voyage and a safe<br />
return. ends </p>
