PRIME MINISTER<br />
SPEECH BY PRIME MINISTER<br />
AUSTRALIA-JAPAN RELATIONS SYMPOSIUM<br />
23 MARCH, 1984 CANBERRA<br />
Mr Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen,<br />
This symposium on Australia-Japan relations is timely.<br />
In recent weeks both during my visit to Japan and<br />
following my return I have had frequent occasion to<br />
comment on the Australia-Japan relationship: where we have<br />
been, the stage we are at now, and most importantly, where<br />
we are going.<br />
What I have been saying coincides closely with the theme you<br />
have chosen for this symposium " Australia-Japan Relations<br />
at a New Juncture"<br />
The Australia-Japan relationship is of great significance to<br />
both our countries.<br />
It is, however, an evolving relationship and is now poised<br />
to move in new directions.<br />
What is important is that we all appreciate the basis of the<br />
changes that are occurring and, at the same time, retain a<br />
clear perspective on the fundamentals of the relationship.<br />
Among those fundamentals, the most. obvious, but nevertheless<br />
most basic for the relationship, is the fact that Australia<br />
and Japan have substantial shared interests across an<br />
ever-widening spectrum.<br />
There is a notable degree of interdependence between our<br />
countries that reflects directly the complementary, if<br />
changing, character of our two economies.<br />
The stability and quality of the economic relationship has<br />
in turn contributed directly to the close political<br />
relationship that has grown up between our countries. </p>
<p>Political relations between Australia and Japan are<br />
characterised by a degree of' mutual trust and reciprocal<br />
confidence that is only possible between the closest of<br />
friends. We have shared strategic perceptions, parallel<br />
security arrangements with the Unites States, and a common<br />
interest in the stability and development of our region.<br />
My own recent visit to Japan brought home to me that<br />
enumeration of these interests and perceptions is more than<br />
a mere rhetorical flourish it reflects a widely shared<br />
spirit of goodwill and understanding that permeates the<br />
attitudes of Government, business and indeed of the<br />
community at large in both our countries.<br />
The recently released opinion survey by the Nippon Research<br />
Centre reinforces this view. It reveals that Australia was<br />
regarded as one of the most attractive countries for the<br />
Japanese, and that a healthy majority of those surveyed<br />
considered Australia to be of importance and future promise.<br />
These perceptions are engendered and reinforced by the now<br />
extensive cross-cultural links and exchanges between the<br />
people of our countries. These are an essential part of any<br />
healthy, growing relationship between countries.<br />
In the case of Japan and Australia, working holiday schemes<br />
and personal initiatives have seen substantial numbers of<br />
our young people, including my own and Prime Minister<br />
Nakasone's daughters, visiting each other's country with<br />
lasting benefits in terms of a greater understanding of our<br />
different societies.<br />
Indeed, most of the leaders I met while on my recent visit<br />
to Japan had visited Australia during the past decade or so<br />
and there are regular exchanges of visits by parliamentary<br />
delegations, businessmen, academics, journalists, and trade<br />
union leaders which ensure that the depth of positive<br />
feeling between our two nations increases each year.<br />
There is, however, as both Prime Minister Nakasone and I<br />
agreed, scope for development of still closer political<br />
relations between Australia and Japan. Indeed, we have<br />
taken concrete steps to advance the relationship in this<br />
way. I am very much looking forward to Prime Minister Nakasone's<br />
visit to Australia later this year. This visit will serve<br />
to consolidate the real progress made during my own visit to<br />
Japan. Prime Minister Nakasone and I have also agreed on the<br />
development of a closer, more systematic pattern of<br />
consultations between our governments both on crisis issues<br />
as they arise and, more generally, on matters in which both<br />
our countries have shared interests. </p>
<p>A particular matter singled out for such consultation during<br />
my visit to Japan was disarmament.<br />
I was impressed by the coincidence of view between Australia<br />
and Japan on this issue. Both our countries attach great<br />
importance to securing progress in arms control and<br />
disarmament negotiations and will be co-operating in our<br />
efforts to find ways of reducing existing nuclear arsenalp<br />
and limiting the spread of nuclear weapons.<br />
This collaborative effort will be particularly focussed on<br />
the United Nations and other disarmament fora. It will also<br />
find a reflection in the efforts each of us will be making<br />
in the bilateral contacts we enjoy with others to urge<br />
effective action in this crucial area.<br />
But the pattern of consultation between us will not be<br />
confined to disarmament issues alone. A wide spectrum of<br />
issues of mutual interest would benefit from a co-operative<br />
approach between us. We are, after all, both countries<br />
sharing a deep concern and involvement with the interests of<br />
the Asia/ Pacific region. As such there is a natural basis<br />
for co-operative endeavour a basis which should advantage<br />
not only Japan and Australia but all countries within the<br />
region. We aim to explore the possibilities this suggests<br />
more closely and more deliberately.<br />
An area of particular interest to both our countries has<br />
been ways of promoting greater economic co-operation in the<br />
Asia/ Pacific region.<br />
In recent years there has been considerable interest in both<br />
our countries in proposals for the establishment of what is<br />
loosely termed a ' Pacific Community'.<br />
There are, of course, sensitivities attaching to the concept<br />
of a ' Pacific Community'. Some countries within the region,<br />
the Asean states particularly, are wary of developing the<br />
formal mechanisms and relationships that some discussions of<br />
the concept have implied.<br />
For these reasons I think progress in this area must be<br />
gradual, with functional co-operation being expanded<br />
carefully, one step at a time.<br />
For Australia's part, however, we cannot really afford to be<br />
indifferent to the possibilities which exist certainly we<br />
should not be leaving it to others to make the running in<br />
this important area. It is indisputably in Australia's<br />
long-term interest to become significantly more involved in<br />
the Asia/ Pacific region, which is now the fastest-growing<br />
economic region in the world. Accordingly we need to<br />
continue actively exploring all possible avenues for<br />
regional co-operation. </p>
<p>4.<br />
For these reasons I find the proposal, put by Sir John<br />
Crawford and now being considered by the Government, for the<br />
establishment of an Australian/ Pacific Co-operation<br />
Committee both timely and helpful. As suggested by Sir<br />
John, the Committee, drawing on the experience of high<br />
calibre representatives from business, unions, academia and<br />
the public service, would advise the Government on matters<br />
affecting Australia's economic co-operation with neighbours<br />
in Asia and the Pacific.<br />
Practical, well-informed consultative processes of this kind<br />
are needed if Australia is to be well-positioned to<br />
associate itself with emerging trends within the region.<br />
Sound, regionally-based co-operative arrangements also<br />
depend importantly as you would all appreciate on the<br />
cordiality and quality of bilateral relations between<br />
individual countries in the region.<br />
Accordingly it was of quite considerable political<br />
significance that Prime Minister Nakasone and I, in our<br />
Joint Statement in Tokyo, were able to reaffirm the<br />
importance to both our countries of the Australia/ Japan<br />
bilateral relationship.<br />
We reaffirmed our common commitment to the ideals of freedom<br />
and democracy and to further strengthening our co-operation<br />
with other countries in the-r6gion to ensure peace,<br />
stability and prosperity.<br />
This co-operative commitment obviously also extended to<br />
trade relations between our two countries.<br />
Because those relations are of such importance to both our<br />
countries, and because they can so readily colour<br />
perceptions of the relationship as a whole, it was important<br />
that Prime Minister Nakasone formally reiterated to me<br />
assurances Japanese Ministers had previously given to other<br />
Australian Ministers that Japan had no intention of<br />
resolving its trading problems with other countries at<br />
Australia's expense.<br />
We ask for no special privileges from Japan we simply want<br />
a fair go. Japan knows Australia's record as a reliable and<br />
competitive supplier. Australia quite legitimately expects<br />
that record to weigh heavily in the balance of any decisions<br />
taken by Japan on particular trade issues.<br />
I might add that support of an open, multilateral trading<br />
system, in which market access is determined by competitive<br />
performance and in which there is no surrender to political<br />
pressures for bilateral solutions to trading problems, is<br />
the position that Mr Nakasone and I have agreed to take to<br />
the world in our search for a satisfactory basis for a new<br />
round of Multilateral Trade Negotiations. </p>
<p>We have been doing so in the strong conviction that every<br />
effort should now be made to ensure that a multilateral<br />
round should contribute not only to global trade expansion<br />
but also to conditions conducive to even stronger economic<br />
and trading activity by countries of this region.<br />
On the refashioning of bilateral trade relations, the<br />
Australian Government, has formulated a Japan market<br />
strategy aimed at identifying new opportunities and<br />
motivating Australian manufacturing and service companies to<br />
take up the challenge of trying to enter previously untapped<br />
parts of the Japanese market.<br />
An important step in the strategy has been the appointment<br />
of two major Japanese consultant companies--Nomura Research<br />
Institute and Seibu Marketing Information Ser'vices to<br />
review the market for us and report on what Australian<br />
companies have to do to effectively enter the Japanese<br />
market. Their first reports will be available soon and a<br />
seminar program has already been arranged in all capital<br />
cities to inform Australian firms of the results.<br />
Australia, conscious of the possibilities associated with<br />
Japan' s import expansion scheme, also intends sending a high<br />
level trade mission to Japan later this year to examine new<br />
export opportunities. For their part, the Japanese are also<br />
expected to send a major trade mission to Australia to help<br />
identify which Australian products might be of particular<br />
interest to Japan. Visits of this kind should do a great<br />
deal to assist the broadening and diversification of the<br />
existing base of Australia/ Japan trade relations.<br />
The attitude of Australian companies to the task of securing<br />
new niches in the Japanese market will obviously be crucial<br />
to the success of the approach now being developed between<br />
the Australian and Japanese Governments. Those companies<br />
interested will need to develop marketing strategies that<br />
are keenly attuned to the consumer preferences, product<br />
design, packaging, and distribution systems of the Japanese<br />
market. Rather than regard that market as a residual one or as a<br />
useful supplement to other priority marketing interests,<br />
Australian entrepreneurs will need to adopt a deliberate,<br />
long-term approach to the task of selling their product.<br />
What the Government is now seeking to promote is a<br />
deliberate Australian marketing effort in Japan. It is an<br />
effort involving an Australian approach which will be buyer<br />
rather than seller orientated. It is a strategy which, if<br />
successful, will without in any way detracting from the<br />
importance of the Australia/ Japan trade in traditional<br />
commodities provide the basis for a broader-based,<br />
long-term and assured growth in the economic relationship<br />
between our countries. </p>
<p>We believe that the Japanese and Australian vision of a more<br />
open and multilateral regional and international trading<br />
system requires decisions regarding the sourcing of imports<br />
to be taken on genuine economic grounds. Any surrender to<br />
bilateralist pressures, for example in relation to current<br />
beef and coal negotiations, would be an entirely unfortunate<br />
development. Australia cannot look on with equanimity when<br />
our position is threatened by factors quite extraneous to.<br />
normal commercial negotiation.<br />
It would be particularly unfortunate at this time when there<br />
is so much of a positive and constructive character now<br />
being done both to restructure and enhance trading relations<br />
between our two countries. It is also a time when our two<br />
countries are together working closely to strengthen the<br />
regional and world trading systems.<br />
Prime Minister Nakasone and I, for example were in close<br />
agreement on the need for effective action to secure<br />
conditions compatible with a freer flow of international<br />
trade. Prime Minister Nakasone's call for a new round of<br />
multilateral trade negotiations and my own 22 November 1983<br />
call in Bangkok to countries of the region to work together<br />
to secure generally agreed objectives in such negotiations<br />
were both directed to this end.<br />
I am pleased to say my Bangkok initiative is now being<br />
translated into concrete action with a meeting of senior<br />
officials likely to take place in an Asean country in late<br />
April to address the issues involved.<br />
This meeting is a crucial step. It will provide an<br />
opportunity for countries of the region to identify their<br />
interests and to consider how best to attain their<br />
objectives in a multilateral round.<br />
This meeting of senior officials will follow the Conference<br />
being organised in Soeul by the Trade Policy Research Centre<br />
from 13-15 April on " Participation of Developing Countries<br />
in the International Trading system". Australia's Minister.<br />
for Primary Industry, John Kerin will attend that meeting.<br />
As a follow-up to a similar meeting hosted by the Minister<br />
for Trade, Lionel Bowen, in Hobart last year it will provide<br />
a useful opportunity to review trends in the international<br />
trade system.<br />
It will also provide a valuable further impetus to the<br />
efforts of regional countries to secure attention to their<br />
particular interests and concerns.<br />
In reaching this point Australia and Japan, along with the<br />
other countries of the region, have been co-operating<br />
cl1o s ely </p>
<p>7.<br />
This approach could usefully be supplemented by Japanese<br />
interest in helping to establish manufacturing facilities in<br />
Australia in high technology, in new mineral resource<br />
exploration and agriculture-related fields where Japanese<br />
technology can be applied.<br />
Australia's long-term ability to capitalise on emerging<br />
opportunities in the Japanese market will also be heavily.<br />
influenced by Australia's own capacity to manage change in<br />
our industry structures in a way relevant to securing those<br />
opportunities. It is for this reason that the Australian Government is<br />
moving to provide a national framework which will define<br />
more precisely the context within which industrial<br />
development will occur.'<br />
The Minister for Industry and Commerce, Senator Button's<br />
co-ordination of the work of a range of Ministers in areas<br />
relevant to structural change in the economy is a reflection<br />
of the deliberateness with which the Government is<br />
addressing the policy issues involved. EPAC's recent call<br />
for the formulation of an active industry development<br />
strategy complements this and reflects a broader community<br />
interest in addressing these matters systematically.<br />
A particular valuable feature of my recent visit to Japan<br />
was the opportunity I had to discuss with the former<br />
Vice-Minister for International Trade and industry, Mr<br />
Amaya, the Japanese experience with regard to industry<br />
restructuring. Mr Amaya will be coming to Australia next<br />
month, at my request, to put his views on the Japanese<br />
experience in restructuring to Australian Government,<br />
industry, union, and media leaders.<br />
The issues involved are complex and will only allow of<br />
gradual, long-term change. What is nevertheless importantas<br />
I know You would all appreciate is that the various<br />
elements of a positive and constructive policy approach in<br />
this crucial area are now coming into place here in<br />
Australia. This pattern of policy development is also important to<br />
another area of joint Australian/ Japanese interest namely<br />
the liberalisation of international trade.<br />
Both Australia and Japan have a strong shared interest in<br />
the re-establishment of global trade expansion and economic<br />
growth as also in the maintenance of strong trade and<br />
general economic expansion throughout our region. </p>
<p>8.<br />
With such an interest in common and recognisino the<br />
pressures that work against its realisation -I hink it is<br />
very important that a symposium of this kind, involving as<br />
it does such distinguished participants from both Australia<br />
and Japan, should help in the task of defining more<br />
precisely how Australia and Japan individually and together<br />
might contribute to a more prosperous region. If it can do<br />
this at the same time as drawing attention to the<br />
possibilities and pitfalls inherent in the contemporary<br />
Australia/ Japan relationship, it will have made a major<br />
contribution. The task is a difficult one, but its importance should not<br />
be underestimated.<br />
I look forward to hearing the results of your deliberations. f </p>
