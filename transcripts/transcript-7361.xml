Peter Sarah ( ABA),<br />
Distinguished Guests,<br />
Ladies and Gentlemen.<br />
At the opening of this Gallery in 1890 the future Prime<br />
Minister of Australia, Alfred Deakin, said that Ballarat<br />
" had added another jewel to the diadem that encircled its<br />
brow". This was the first regional gallery established in<br />
Australia. For more than a century it has maintained its<br />
reputation as the most important regional collection in the<br />
nation. And with every passing year, it has vindicated in every<br />
respect Deakin's description of it as a jewel.<br />
The Ballarat Fine Art Gallery, in its building and in its<br />
collection, reflects and enhances the vital creative role<br />
this city has played, and continues to play, in the cultural<br />
life of our nation.<br />
When it was first constructed, the Gallery was one of the<br />
architectural gems of Ballarat's Golden era. And when the<br />
Gallery came into possession of the Eureka flag, it acquired<br />
a central relic of the tumult and the tragedy of that Gold<br />
Rush era.<br />
The Gallery's collection of art by the Lindsay family is<br />
unparalleled. its important Colonial and Heidelberg School<br />
paintings, its extensive collection of prints and its broad<br />
representation of 20th century art, all attest to the<br />
insight and the generosity of the Ballarat community over<br />
many years. 503 </p>
<p>Today it is a pleasure to inaugurate a new era in the life<br />
of the Gallery.<br />
After much planning and hard work, the Gallery is now about<br />
to open its doors again double its former size. Its<br />
display areas have been improved, its facilities have been<br />
expanded, air conditioning has been installed all of which<br />
will ensure that without doubt this jewel will continue to<br />
gleam for another hundred years and more.<br />
Because of its historical and cultural significance to the.<br />
people of Ballarat and Victoria as a whole, the renovations<br />
and additions to the Ballarat Fine Art Gallery made it<br />
particularly appropriate for inclusion in the<br />
Commonwealth-State Bicentennial Commemorative Program.<br />
The Commonwealth is proud of the contribution it has been<br />
able to make to these renovations. And I am particularly<br />
pleased at the way in which the Gallery used the<br />
Bicentennial funds as seed money to generate further funds<br />
from within the broader community. I pay tribute to the way<br />
in which the Ballarat community including the City Council<br />
has, again, generously expressed its support for its<br />
Gallery. I also pay tribute to the hard work on behalf of this<br />
Gallery and on behalf of Ballarat generally by your local<br />
Member of Parliament, John ? lildren.<br />
The stature of the Ballarat Gallery as Australia's premier<br />
regional gallery is recognised by the exhibition " The Face<br />
of Australia" which we are also launching this evening.<br />
In " The Face of Australia" we are presented with a unique<br />
vision of our development as a nation through the media of<br />
painting, sculpture, photography, ceramics, prints and the<br />
decorative arts, ranging from artists' impressions of our<br />
land before 1788 to contemporary times.<br />
Any exhibition which can boast the names of Boyd and<br />
Drysdale; Heysen and ? lcCubbin; Nolan, Preston and Rees;<br />
Roberts and Streeton is a significant art event in its own<br />
right. But what people will find remarkable about " The Face<br />
of Australia" people, that is, who believe the only<br />
substantial art is to be found in the national capitals is<br />
that all these works have been drawn from regional<br />
galleries: 54 of then throughout the nation.<br />
So this exhibition bears testimony to the richness and<br />
diversity of the holdings of our regional galleries and<br />
their importance as guardians of some of the finest and most<br />
important collections of Australian art.<br />
" The Face of Australia" will be on show in Ballarat until 21<br />
August. The exhibition will then split into four related<br />
components, each of which will tour through the regional<br />
galleries of Australia until ' next January, from Launceston<br />
to Alice Springs and from Bunbury to Townsville.<br />
504 </p>
<p>3.<br />
It will, then, be in every sense a national exhibition, and<br />
all those who have worked on it can be proud of their<br />
achievement. I commend the Australian Bicentennial Authority the<br />
Rothmans Foundation, the curator, David Hansen, and all<br />
those who assisted in mounting the exhibition.<br />
At the same time, I commend all those involved in the<br />
renovations to the Gallery.<br />
The scope of the exhibition and the Gallery's magnificently<br />
refurbished display space, together show as never before the<br />
wealth of Australia's regional galleries.<br />
And together, they reveal once more the depth and the wealth<br />
of Ballarat's cultural achievement. 505 </p>
