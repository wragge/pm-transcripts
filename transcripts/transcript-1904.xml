FOR PRESS: Z I-3 JUL 196,<br />
L P. M. No. 73/ 1968<br />
ARCHITECT FOR NATIONAL GALLERY<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister, Mr. John Gorton<br />
A Sydney firm Edwardsj Madigan, Torzillo and<br />
Partners has been selected to design the Abstralian National<br />
Gallery in Canberra. The competition to chose the architect was launched<br />
in March this year among twelve architects practising in Australia.<br />
The competition had as its aim not a final design for<br />
the building but rather the selection of a vigorous and imaginative<br />
architect who would then be commissioned to submit the actual design<br />
of the Gallery, I believe that the competition has abhieved that aim.<br />
The assessois, in their rejiitt, commented on the<br />
high quality of all the entries submitted and stressed the ingenuity<br />
and originality of their approawlh<br />
Although a site for the Galeiy is not yet finally<br />
determined, the selection of the architect allows the planning for the<br />
National Gallery to proceed to the next stage. This will Involve<br />
discussions between the successful architect, the eminent Gallery<br />
Director, Mr. James J. Sweeney of New York, who has been engaged<br />
as consultant, the development authority for the Gallery ( the National<br />
Capital Development Commission) and the newly selected Interim<br />
Council for the National Gallery.<br />
CANBERRA 26 July 1968 </p>
<p>PACKGROUND NOTES<br />
1. The decision to establish a National Gallery<br />
in Canberra was announced by Sir Robert Menzies on<br />
September 1965, and the report of the National Gallery<br />
Committee of Enquiry ( Lindsay Committee) was tabled by<br />
the late Prime Minister ( Mr. Harold Holt) in Parliament<br />
on I November 1967.<br />
2. The architectural competition was not for a<br />
final design for a Gallery, but for the selection of an architect<br />
whose entry convinced the assessors that his design approach<br />
would warrant his appointment as the architect for the project.<br />
( The assessors were Sir John Overall, Mr. Robin Boyd and<br />
Mr. 1. L. McConnell).<br />
3. The entries were judged anonymously, the<br />
twelve competing architects ( list attached) having enclosed<br />
their names in sealed envelopes when they submitted their<br />
designs.<br />
4. The envelopes were kept in security storage<br />
at the Reserve Bank. The sealed envelope corresponding to<br />
the winning entry was delivered to the Prime Minister today<br />
by the Minister for the Interior, Mr. Nixon.<br />
At a brief ceremony in his office this morning<br />
( attended by Mr. Nixon, Sir John Overall, Sir Daryl Lindsay,<br />
Mr. J. L. McConnell, Mr. Robin Boyd and Mr. C. L. S.<br />
Hewitt), the Prime Minister opened the envelope and announced<br />
the name of the successful architect. </p>
