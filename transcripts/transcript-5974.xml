CER SIGNING BY SATELLITE<br />
( Statement by the Acting Prime Minister<br />
and Minister for Trade and Resources the Rt. Hon.<br />
J. D. Anthony, C. H.,<br />
The New Zealand Prime Minister, Mr. Muldoon, and I will<br />
sign the H-eads of Agreement of the Closer Economic<br />
Relationship between Australia and New Zealand during a twoway<br />
satellite transmission at noon on Tuesday 14 December.<br />
This will be the first time, to my knowledge, that a<br />
television satellite link has been used for the signing of<br />
such an agreement. I believe it is appropriate that the<br />
latest technology should be used to conclude such an<br />
important forward-looking agreement.<br />
During the signing ceremony, Mr. Muldoon and his<br />
delegation will be located at New Zealand's Parliament House,<br />
in Wellington, while I, other cabinet Ministers and senior<br />
industry representatives will be in the Senate Committee<br />
rooms at Parliament House in Canberra.<br />
Mr. Muldoon and I will each have previously signed a<br />
copy of the Agreement. These copies will be exchanged at the<br />
satellite ceremony, and signed by the other party.. There are<br />
several advantages in signing the Agreement in this way. The<br />
most obvious arc the economies achieved in terms of cost and<br />
time: one delegation does not have to travel fron one country<br />
to the othecr, and all Ministers who have been involved in<br />
working towards the progress of the CI3R can participate in<br />
the formal ceremony. Also, the general public in bothi<br />
countries is able to participate as observers to the actual<br />
signing. Tie signing will be telecast live in New Zealand.<br />
