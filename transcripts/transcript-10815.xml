  As a demonstration of the Government's commitment to the Royal</p>
<p> Flying Doctor Service I today announce a new $82 million agreement,</p>
<p> to provide high level emergency health care to Australians in isolated</p>
<p> areas.</p>
<p>From 1 July 1998 the Commonwealth will enter a five year agreement</p>
<p> with the National Office of the Royal Flying Doctor Service, providing</p>
<p> $16.56 million a year.</p>
<p>The new agreement recognises the Government's determination to</p>
<p> deliver effective health services in rural and remote areas. It also</p>
<p> provides the Flying Doctor with certainty about future funding and</p>
<p> encourages better operational planning.</p>
<p>The Flying Doctor is not only an essential part of the existing rural</p>
<p> and remote health infrastructure, but it also complements other Howard</p>
<p> Government initiatives, including outreach specialist services, the</p>
<p> establishment of university departments of rural health around Australia,</p>
<p> funding arrangements for divisions of general practice and Aboriginal</p>
<p> health services.</p>
<p>This week the royal Flying Doctor Service celebrates 70 years of operation.</p>
<p> Throughout that time the Flying Doctor has played an indispensable</p>
<p> role in providing health and related services to remote and rural</p>
<p> communities throughout Australia.</p>
<p>It quite rightly has become an Australian national icon for the high</p>
<p> principles, resourcefulness and daring of its dedicated health professionals.</p>
<p>Since its inception in 1928, the Flying Doctor has provided continuous</p>
<p> service to rural and remote communities and has retained the ideals</p>
<p> envisaged by its founder, the Reverend Dr John Flynn.</p>
<p>Over the past decade more than 1.2 million people have received medical</p>
<p> services from the flying doctor. I congratulate the Royal Flying Doctor</p>
<p> Service on reaching 70 years of consistently high health service to</p>
<p> people in the bush.</p>
