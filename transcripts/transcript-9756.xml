TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE MON P. J. KEATING MP<br />
DOORSTOP ON DEPARTURE TO LEADERS RETREAT, MADANG RESORT,<br />
14 SEPTEMBER 19" 5<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
J: Nauru's Leader says that the French should be excluded from the post-<br />
Forum dialogue, would Austraia support that position?<br />
PM: I think for some countries here, it is only the post-Forum dialogue whe re there<br />
is any contact with the French. So, I think, some countries will want ' to keep<br />
that dialogue going.<br />
J: Is Australia one of those countries?<br />
PM: Well we don't we have ambassadorial sources and we have direct ones as<br />
you know, but other countries don't so we respect their view.<br />
J: How strong will the condemnation of France be?<br />
PM: I think fairly strong. But again, here, questions about the French in this Pacific<br />
and the French territories are for the French and the people who li~ e there.<br />
What we are objecting to is a single decision to detonate these nuclear blasts<br />
and If that were over then, if you lIke, our point of objection with France would<br />
cease.<br />
J: After talking with other leaders overnight, how hopeful are you now of getting<br />
agreement on a code of conduct to restrict logging?<br />
PM: I am reasonably hopeful. At the las meeting in Brisbane we. tied to<br />
reconstruct the airline deficits which is a big thing to try to do. To try and get<br />
the fisheries, to get a better deal on fseries and more cohesion in managing<br />
fishery clients and getting better prices and the other thing w~ is to do<br />
something about forestry, about unsustainable logging. Now, they are three<br />
very big chunks to bite off we are going pretty well on two and I hopoe we do<br />
well on the third.<br />
J: Do you think using aid as a lever is an appropriate way to get people to fall in<br />
line?<br />
PM: I don't think so because we can al seek to pressure governments but aid is<br />
about helping people and when aid is diminished Nstt arts to diminish some of<br />
the programs that ordinary people get benefit from.<br />
