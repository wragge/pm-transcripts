PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 20 May 1979<br />
ELECTORATE TALK<br />
The private Member of Parliament the Member who sits on the<br />
backbench is a key and central figure in the Parliamentary<br />
democracy we enjoy in Australia.<br />
The private Member is in a special position. He is able to make<br />
a unique contribution to government.<br />
He is a barometer of public attitudes simply because of his intimate<br />
links with his constituents.<br />
He is able to quickly sense a community need and bring that to<br />
the attention of government.<br />
No government can afford not to heed his advice and his concerns.<br />
For many Australians even for most Australians a Canberra government<br />
can be remote. It seems removed from day-to-day problems of<br />
Australian families.<br />
" How can the politicians and public servants in Canberra understand<br />
my special circumstances and my problems', is a cry we often hear<br />
or read about.<br />
The point is a good one. That is why the local Member in particular<br />
can bring to Canberra the centre of government the real concerns,<br />
hopes and aspirations of all sections of the community.<br />
I know of many of the frustrations of the private Member, having<br />
spent some ten years working from the backbench, but that work<br />
has great intrinsic merit. The responsibility of representing all<br />
the people of his electorate can itself be a stimulating and rewarding<br />
exper~ ence. It is one of the continuing important tasks of every<br />
Member of Parliament. I<br />
While the private Member may be giving constructive service to his<br />
electocrate, he still feels he has mora to.-contribute to the<br />
central decision making proc -ess in government.<br />
Quite plainly, the Ministry and Cabinet have no mortgage of wisdom<br />
on the hundreds of issues that pass their plate each year.<br />
The government understands this, and that is why we have given more<br />
encouragement to our private Members to participate in this process.<br />
For many years, committees of Parliamentmade up of both government<br />
and opposition Members, have made valuable contributions in examining<br />
critical issues. </p>
<p>-2<br />
Committees have prepared reports on issues of public concern<br />
ranging from road safety, tourism, defence equipment, social conditions<br />
of Aboriginals to drugs.<br />
Unfortunately, in the past, these reports have been often pigeon-holed<br />
and forgotten, gathering dust in a library somewhere.<br />
For the government, that situation was not good enough.<br />
Last year I announced that within six months of tabling a commite<br />
report, the responsible Minister would make a statement to the<br />
Parliament outlining the action the government proposed to take in<br />
relation to the report.<br />
The new system has. worked well.<br />
Just a few weeks ago for example, Mr Lynch presented the government<br />
response to the report of the Select Committee on Tourism.<br />
That was a bipartisan committee.<br />
The Chairman was David Jull, a Liberal Member from Queensland, and<br />
the Deputy was a long standing Labor Parliamentarian, the late<br />
Frank Stewart.<br />
The recommendations of this committee were broadly accepted by the<br />
government. Without their work, the government could not have made<br />
the best decision in the interests of the entire community.<br />
As Prime Minister and leader of the coalition team, I have also<br />
insisted on an effective government Members' committee system.<br />
This enables private Membe rs to work closely with Ministers, and<br />
provides a direct sounding board that any government must have.<br />
I and my Ministers meet regularly with Chairmen of government<br />
committees on a whole range of policies and issues.<br />
This king of consultation-adds to the quality of government, and the<br />
decision making process.<br />
Today, as communities and governments around the world face up to<br />
so many complex issues it is important that the governmen~ t makes the<br />
best use of all possible talent and experience available both<br />
inside and outside the Parliament.<br />
The local Member of Parliament is in a position to make a special<br />
contribution to the decision making process. And that is an input<br />
that the government welcomes. I 000--</p>
