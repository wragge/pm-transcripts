TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
AND THE MINISTER FOR HOUSING AND REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT,<br />
THE HON BRIAN HOWE MP, DOORSTOP, BEENLEIGH COMMUNITY<br />
CENTRE, QUEENSLAND, 11 DECEMBER 1995<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
J: How confident are you that the States will respond positively?<br />
PM: Well, my colleague Brian Howe has had substantial discussions with<br />
the State Ministers for Housing and Regional Development and by and<br />
large there is, I think, a general willingness to go down this path. That<br />
is, it has been pretty much a part of the COAG process, that is, better<br />
aligning the roles and responsibilities of the Commonwealth and the<br />
States and this seems to us a sensible direction. That is, on the one<br />
hand the Commonwealth will be taking over the responsibilities of<br />
income support, both for the public and private rental market and on<br />
the other hand the States will be taking full responsibility for the<br />
housing stock. There will be efficiencies and, of course, a more<br />
equitable support for people on lower incomes.<br />
J: Prime Minister, how quickly do you expect people who are renting<br />
privately to see the benefits of public housing ( inaudible)..<br />
PM: As we say in the Statement, it is contingent upon a set of agreements<br />
at the Council of Australian Governments as to the reflection of the fact<br />
that the States would no longer be required to provide rentals to public<br />
housing, but rather this would be done by the Commonwealth and this<br />
will require a discussion and agreement about the general figures.<br />
J: So, are you talking about, in terms of after this three year interim<br />
agreement?<br />
PM: We start in 1 July 1996 for the agreements, we should have it in place,<br />
I think, by then shouldn't we Brian? </p>
<p>BH: The interim agreement is up to three years so that really is contingent<br />
on how long it takes for negotiations and how long it takes to actually<br />
set up the new approach. There are some complicated planning<br />
issues involved, so the interim agreement is there for three years as<br />
the current coverage. But, it could be a long way sooner than three<br />
years.<br />
J: So, it is conceivable that there could be some announcement before<br />
the election?<br />
PM: I think, we have really got to sit down with the States and take it from<br />
here in terms of financial assistance grants and I can't see us getting<br />
that done before the election.<br />
J: Prime Minister, if people capitalise how are they going to be able to<br />
afford to pay off their mortgage?<br />
PM: A lot of people will, for a start, if you put a decent down payment down<br />
it means that you're not borrowing such a high proportion of the cost of<br />
the mortgage and therefore the repayments can be structured to suit<br />
you. A lot of people just can't get the deposit together.<br />
J: Who would act as their guarantor I mean, they would have to act as<br />
their own guarantor..<br />
PM: Well, I think the financial institutions, we have got plenty of them in the<br />
housing area, they are fairly sophisticated and the sort of bad debt<br />
situation in housing is so low as to make it a very safe area of<br />
commerce. But, of course, there are mortgage insurers as well and a<br />
lot of financial institutions will insist on mortgage insurance.<br />
J: The housing industry would prefer a more direct incentive any talk<br />
about that?<br />
PM: I notice John Murray from Master Builders Australia said today it was<br />
the most definitive statement on housing since World War 1I. So, that<br />
is a fair indication of what they think about it and, I think, that they are<br />
thinking long. I mean, housing finance today is there by virtue of the<br />
fact that the government opened and deregulated housing in the<br />
middle of the 1980s when our predecessor, of course, left it subject to<br />
regulation. So, you were very lucky if you got a housing loan, most<br />
people couldn't and when you got a loan it was cocktailed up with<br />
second mortgages and personal finance. So, it was enviably higher.<br />
We have got real competition in housing lending now and housing<br />
lending rates are coming down and this has been a stimulus to the<br />
market. But, where there has been overbuilding, you will just have to<br />
wait for that stock of places to be taken up, but there is no doubt this<br />
would help in the longer run because it means that some of the private </p>
<p>stock could go virtually into rentals for people who might not otherwise<br />
qualify for a place in public housing for years and years.<br />
J: Prime Minister, is this aimed at the battlers?<br />
PM: Well, Brian Howe and I have been battling for battlers all of our<br />
political lives. The Labor party has been battling for them for over 100<br />
years and in our case we have been battling for a quarter of that time<br />
and a lot of the changes to rent assistance which I mentioned in the<br />
speech, affordability came, of course, from reforms in the 1980s and<br />
the essence of this is for people on low incomes who are finding that<br />
they just can't get the houses of their choice in the places of their<br />
choice or for people who are now in public housing who are afraid to<br />
move to where they really want to be because they think they will lose<br />
their place. Now, it is only ever Labor governments that think about<br />
these people and, of course, the Liberals condescendingly call them<br />
battlers. It is a bit like saying someone is in trade, it is their social<br />
equivalent of their " in trade" remark.<br />
J: Prime Minister is it possible to put a dollar figure on the Rent<br />
Assistance Program?<br />
PM: I don't think we should try that at this point. We have got some fairly<br />
close estimates of it all, but this is a big program, a systemic program<br />
change has got to be worked through with the States. So, rather than<br />
having numbers running around we have made some very clear<br />
benchmarks though. We are saying that new tenants in public housing<br />
will receive subsidies which will ensure that they pay no more than<br />
per cent of their income in rent for appropriate housing. There is some<br />
of those types of things there to give people a guide.<br />
J: ( inaudible)..<br />
PM: I think the answer to that is yes. It is just a matter of how much we can<br />
negotiate in the mean time.<br />
J: Mr Keating, are there any guarantees that the States won't just rip<br />
money out of the housing sector the same as they have done in<br />
health?<br />
PM: What will be happening here is that the States would be providing<br />
funding to the Commonwealth for the implicit rents they now provide.<br />
We will still have a commitment under the new agreement, but again, if<br />
they allow too many of their housing stock perhaps more ambitiously,<br />
they can sell them, turn them over, renovate them, but there will<br />
always be political pressure on States to provide public housing and it<br />
is like every state, I mean you can try some of these policies if you<br />
wish but in the end you get a community back lash. People do want<br />
these sorts of public services. </p>
<p>J: Prime Minister, the Coalition says the real issue is a cut in the interest<br />
rates..<br />
PM: We have seen quite substantial changes in housing interest rates now<br />
with fixed housing rates and variable rates having come down in the<br />
last few months. They will always make the glib empty remark. The<br />
non-glib full remark is, as I say, where we want housing policy to go in<br />
the long run. And as always, it is only the government out there with<br />
the policies. Today, again, it is always the government out there with<br />
the policy and what you get from them, you know, press release<br />
confetti. You know, the confetti and we are obviously entering the<br />
confetti stage with the Opposition. But it is not very easy to write very<br />
much on a piece of confetti and that is what they will do. They will give<br />
you one page press releases from now until polling day. So what they<br />
won't give you is a coherent policy.<br />
J: Senator Cook talked yesterday about a downfall in interest rates<br />
coming from the Innovation Statement ? 7<br />
PM: Well the more innovation there is in the financial markets the better<br />
and you can see it in housing. I mean John Howard had the Campbell<br />
Report. He could have deregulated housing interest rates so as<br />
people could get the benefit of lower housing. He didn't do it. We did<br />
it and, as a consequence, now you can walk into a financial institution<br />
with one mortgage and get a loan. You couldn't do that. They were<br />
rationed. Housing finance was rationed before deregulation and you<br />
then only got $ 25,000 or $ 30,000 on a mortgage. You then got<br />
another $ 10,000 on an overdraft. You get some more money on a<br />
personal loan and it was all cocktailed up. The more the Government<br />
has been able to bring innovation into the financial markets, the more<br />
efficiently they are operating. And you can really see some probably<br />
in this last 12 or 15 months, for the first time really strong competition<br />
in the housing sector.<br />
J: Prime Minister, do you expect all the costs to be covered by the<br />
Innovation Statement?<br />
PM: Well the costs to this are not affected by the revenue raised from the<br />
Innovation Statement because this is a revenue neutral matter<br />
between the Commonwealth and the States. It is a matter of us<br />
realigning our roles and responsibilities. It is not a matter, here, of<br />
trowelling new money in.<br />
J: What about Better Cities funding?<br />
PM: Oh the Better Cities money is there. But that is over a period of years<br />
over three years. </p>
<p>J: inaudible<br />
PM: Well, I mean Brian said it himself, eloquently, about the rail lines and<br />
the importance of the gateways. I mean we have just spent<br />
$ 250 million here in Brisbane on a new international airport where we<br />
have now got, you know, linkages down to the city of Brisbane and to<br />
the Gold Coast. We have got, now, a rail line to help also make that<br />
linkage and this is going to be as true and as valuable in Melbourne,<br />
as it is in Sydney, and other places. And it is again, as Brian said it<br />
is only in the last 30 years or so that we have been building rail links<br />
and these sort of linkages. I don't think you want to add to that Brian,<br />
do you?<br />
J: Kennett's assertion essentially that you are undermining him?<br />
PM: Well I can't see how it undermines his proposals. I mean I think he is<br />
just having a bad week old Jeffrey.<br />
J: Mr Keating, will the timing of Mundingburra by-election affect your<br />
plans for the federal election?<br />
PM: Well, no, because Mundingburra is exclusively a State by-election,<br />
about exclusively State matters. People in this State know all about<br />
that. They have had these issues in the public debate now for months<br />
and months. But I am very confident Wayne Goss' Government will<br />
win the by-election because the Government is doing very well.<br />
I mean it is back in the saddle, it is governing, it is looking good and,<br />
I think, the Premier said it all the other day when he said " you don't<br />
want the instability that comes from hung Parliaments". Look at<br />
New South Wales. The Fahey Government couldn't move for pressure<br />
from independents. You had Premier Greiner making the same point<br />
and there was very much a time when people regarded New South<br />
Wales, under the Coalition Government, as a place to miss. You know<br />
you went to Queensland, or to Victoria. Now I don't think Queensland<br />
should lose that advantage. The advantage of Government and<br />
getting on with it.<br />
J: How do you think Wayne Goss would go in a State poll?<br />
PM: Well there is no State poll. I mean it is a by-election.<br />
J: No, if the by-election went the other way?<br />
PM: Oh God knows. Well I think he would get up because the Government<br />
looks good, I think, and we are getting things done. Like the things we<br />
are doing jointly with them here.<br />
J: So from a federal point of view Mundingburra doesn't concern the<br />
federal government either way? </p>
<p>PM: No, the federal arena has got a whole different smorgasbord of issues<br />
altogether and given that it is not that long since a State election here,<br />
which was a relatively close one, in which this seat mattered then and<br />
mattered now. I mean I am sure the Queensland community, certainly<br />
the people of Mundingburra, understand that well. Anyway, it is only<br />
ever the Labor Party that has ever done anything for Townsville.<br />
I mean we have just put funding into a new port, the Commonwealth, in<br />
the last year or so. Look at that huge investment in the water supply.<br />
There is one branch of the Australian Taxation Office. I mean<br />
Better Cities funding.<br />
J: So you wouldn't see anything Mundingburra by-election within five<br />
weeks of the federal campaign?<br />
PM: Well, Jim, you're in the central Canberra Press Gallery business of<br />
picking election dates for the Prime Minister. It is like, you know, a<br />
game of scrabble.<br />
J: So you wouldn't see anything Mundingburra by-election within five<br />
weeks of the federal campaign?<br />
PM: No, it wouldn't worry me because I think they are separate issues.<br />
J: Does it worry you that you won't be invited?<br />
PM: When have you ever seen a Prime Minister in a State by-election?<br />
When, ever? Like since 1901, ever? I don't think so.<br />
J: inaudible<br />
PM: Yes, but Ian Spicer is a fully paid up member of the Liberal Party,<br />
mate. Ian Spicer is a card-carrying Lib and he was in the last election<br />
and he will be in this one.<br />
J: And that comes from all the Westpac people that were polled?<br />
PM: No, and it is not coming from the private economists. It is not coming<br />
from the other organisations who make it very clear that they expect<br />
the economy to be growing of the order of 3 1/ 2 per cent.<br />
J: inaudible<br />
PM: Well that could be drawn from it and could be so. But I haven't seen<br />
the results of the survey. I can't confirm those. But, again, we have<br />
taken the economy off from 6 per cent GDP to something slower.<br />
That doesn't mean to say it is going into negative growth.<br />
Only Howard is pushing that miserable view around, just as he did in<br />
the last election. They were going to have a double dip recession and </p>
<p>7<br />
a depression and any chump in the press who was prepared to listen<br />
to them then wrote it, just put the same discount through it, that either<br />
you put through then or you should have.<br />
J: What are your expectations of Howard's national identity in the next<br />
Headland speech scheduled on Wednesday?<br />
PM: Well when Mr Howard starts talking about the national identity<br />
I mean you know for him who always started in Whitehall and finished<br />
in Pennsylvania Avenue and no doubt he will be preaching some of<br />
the themes which I hope I have made familiar about the importance of<br />
culture to Australia, of Australian culture to Australia, keeping violence<br />
off television. Unlike him, I don't mind him pinching my policies.<br />
That is quite a compliment.<br />
