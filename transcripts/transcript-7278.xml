PRIME MINISTER<br />
EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
NATIONAL PRESS CLUB<br />
CANBERRA 22 JANUARY, 1988<br />
My latest appearance at this most important Australian forum<br />
was, of course, just before the Federal Elections last July.<br />
It will not have escaped you that, had we made a different<br />
decision about the timing of the election, many of you might<br />
well be about to go on the campaign trail over the next few<br />
weeks. As it is, we are now able to have the Bicentennial Year<br />
absolutely free of party politics, at the national level.<br />
Well, shall we say for perhaps a week.<br />
However that may be, I do want to say one thing very<br />
seriously. I count it as an inestimable privilege to have been elected<br />
leader of our nation and Prime minister of Australia in this<br />
year of the Bicentenary.<br />
I say that in no spirit of false pride.<br />
But the duty does fall, in part, to me, to articulate on<br />
behalf of the Australian people, the meaning and purpose of<br />
the Bicentenary: and, in particular, to seek its true<br />
meaning for Australia's future.<br />
And that is a rare honour and privilege indeed and may I<br />
say, a great responsibility.<br />
Even so early in the Year, I think it has already emerged<br />
what the Bicentenary does not mean.<br />
It is not to be an occasion for vain glory or empty<br />
boasting. There is to be no meaningless flag-waving or drum-thumping. 0 ' 20 '? 8 </p>
<p>2.<br />
In the gatherings and events I have already attended or<br />
witnessed through television, one could not help but feel<br />
that, underlying the evident enjoyment and enthusiasm, there<br />
4 is a seriousness, a thoughtfulness, a reflectiveness on the<br />
part of the Australian people -and not least, and most<br />
significantly, on the part of the younger people.<br />
And if this perception of mine proves correct as I am<br />
convinced it will in the days ahead then it will be<br />
further evidence of the new maturity of the Australian<br />
people a maturity which has been demonstrated so amply by<br />
their conduct in recent years, and by their response to the<br />
unique challenges we face in these times.<br />
* 2 And that of course, goes to the heart of the true meaning of<br />
the Bicentenary.<br />
Because one of the tests of our maturity is our capacity to<br />
learn. The Bicentenary is as much about learning and reflecting as<br />
it is about celebrating.<br />
The very nature of the specific event being commemorated on<br />
Tuesday Australia Day gives an impetus to this process.<br />
A less mature people, a less self-confident people would<br />
scarcely choose the commemoration of such an event for the<br />
celebration of their nationhood.<br />
That we are prepared to acknowledge the grim and harsh<br />
reality of the origins of modern Australia is itself<br />
testimony to our national maturity and self-confidence.<br />
No-one of my generation could fail to be aware of the vast<br />
changes which have occurred in our attitudes to our history,<br />
our culture, and our relations with the rest of the world,<br />
especially the peoples of our own region.<br />
It is a process of change which may be said to have begun<br />
with the fall of Singapore in 1942.<br />
It has been an accelerating process in recent years -and<br />
for most of those who have lived through it, an exhilarating<br />
process.<br />
And I believe that, in the years to come, the Bicentenary<br />
itself will be seen as a decisive point in the process th~<br />
process of deepening our sense of national identity,<br />
national responsibility and national maturity.<br />
We have altered the focus on our past.<br />
With that new focus on the past, has come a reassessment of<br />
the past. 004 </p>
<p>Aknd for none of our fellow Australians will this<br />
reassessment be of greater value than the Aboriginal people.<br />
I do not wish to suggest that the Bicentenary is the sole<br />
cause of this reassessment.<br />
Rather, it is part of a process which has continued ever<br />
since the people of Australia voted overwhelmingly in the<br />
Referendum of 1967 to change the Constitution and give the<br />
Commonwealth the power to make laws affecting the lives of<br />
Aboriginal and Islander people.<br />
Specifically, I reject out of hand any insinuation that the<br />
policies of the Australian Government represent some sort of<br />
vindow dressing for the Bicentenary, for consumption<br />
overseas. That kind of claim not only demeans the Australian people,<br />
but detracts from the unanswerable justice of the Aboriginal<br />
cause.<br />
Nor is the cause advanced by attempts to draw up an<br />
indictment of criminality against the entire Australian<br />
nation. The Australian people should never be asked to accept that<br />
their entire history as a modern nation must be predicated<br />
on the notion of a collective and irredeemable guilt.<br />
But they will respond and respond with great generosity of<br />
spirit to the claims of truth and justice.<br />
And there can be no doubt that the reassessment of the past<br />
for which the Bicentenary has provided a focus and, to<br />
some extent, a catalyst has sharpened the perception of<br />
the truth and justice of those claims, throughout the<br />
Australian community.<br />
On 10 December, 1987, the minister for Aboriginal Affairs,<br />
Gerry Hand, delivered in the Parliament the policy statement<br />
entitled, " Foundations for the Future".<br />
I believe that was a landmark statement a landmark for the<br />
Australian aboriginal people, a landmark for all the<br />
Australian people.<br />
Because, it does five things of tremendous significance.<br />
it acknowledges the descendants of the aboriginal people of<br />
Australia as the prior occupiers and original owners of this<br />
land. it acknowledges the dispossession of their land by<br />
subsequent European occupation. 004 080 </p>
<p>4.<br />
It acknowledges that the dispossession occurred without<br />
compensation and with no serious attempt to reach agreement<br />
with the Aboriginal people on the use of their land.<br />
It acknowledges the deep disadvantages and deprivations the<br />
Aboriginals have thereby suffered and continue to suffer.<br />
And it pledges the Australian Government and the Australian<br />
people to an earnest and continuing effort of rectification<br />
and reconciliation.<br />
Now, these are not mere forms of words.<br />
They represent a'profound shift in concepts and attitudes<br />
which have been fundamental to the relationship between the<br />
original inhabitants and European settlers on this<br />
continent, for the past two hundred years.<br />
That is the reason why the words we propose in the preamble<br />
to the Act establishing the new Aboriginal and Torres Strait<br />
Islander Commission is of such very real and genuine<br />
significance. I make just one more point in this connection.<br />
The resolution of this issue will not be quick or easy.<br />
But the key to its resolution undoubtedly lies in a clearer<br />
understanding of the true nature of the relationship between<br />
the Aboriginal people and the land.<br />
We are now recognising what was largely ignored previously*-<br />
the realisation that, before our occupancy of a mere 7 or 8<br />
generations and 200 years, came, perhaps, as many as 2000<br />
generations, and 40,000 years of a human culture of<br />
remarkable sophistication and adaptability.<br />
And I do suggest that the clearer and wider understanding of<br />
this basic fact is another of the valuable results of the<br />
Bicentenary, and the new perspectives it has provided.<br />
This is something which illuminates our whole understanding<br />
of human culture and civilization.<br />
It is something which alters the perspective of our own<br />
relationship with each other as Australians.<br />
And this brings me to my next point about the Bicentenary.<br />
I deeply hope that,. from it all, will emerge a new<br />
understanding, a new appreciation of the role of immigration<br />
and immigrants in our nation's life and growth.<br />
There is nothing trite about saying that we are a nation of<br />
immigrants. 004 081 </p>
<p>I<br />
But, if we once grasp the fact that the original inhabitants<br />
represent some 2000 generations, how utterly insignificant,<br />
then, becomes the difference between those of us who claim a<br />
few generations in our Australian genealogy, and those of us<br />
who were born overseas wherever born or however recently<br />
arrived. None of us is entitled to claim real " Australian-ness" on<br />
the basis of ancestry alone.<br />
Each generation of immigrants each source from which we<br />
draw our immigrants brings enrichment and strength to our<br />
national life and culture.<br />
in determining the relationship we have with each other and<br />
our capacity to work together as a community, birth and<br />
background are not the fundamental considerations.<br />
And I hope the realisation of this will emerge as one of the<br />
best results of the Year of the Bicentenary.<br />
A-nd in that way, I deeply hope that the commemoration of the<br />
Bicentenary will be seen, in retrospect, as part of a great<br />
act of bonding between all Australians, whatever their<br />
national or racial origin.<br />
I said before that those of my generation had lived to see a<br />
transformation of attitudes in this country.<br />
Beyond question, the major factor behind that change has<br />
been the immigration program, instituted by the Chifley<br />
Government and followed through by all successive Australian<br />
Gave rnments.<br />
I have no hesitation in saying that the most important<br />
factor enabling the Australia of today to meet the new<br />
challenges of our time is the strength, flexibility and<br />
adaptability we have been able to achieve in the post-War<br />
years. one word describes it all the vigour of this nation.<br />
And so much of that vigour derives from the willingness we<br />
have shown to welcome into our midst people and families<br />
from every quarter of the globe.<br />
I believe this has been a major element in the capacity we<br />
have shown, as a nation, in the past two years, to respond<br />
to the challenges and difficulties imposed on us by events<br />
and trends overseas.<br />
It is my firm conviction and the guiding principle of my<br />
Government that above all else what we Australians want<br />
for our future is a just, fair and tolerant society.<br />
Le-gislation and policies are not the only way by which this<br />
will be reached. 0 04082 </p>
<p>6.<br />
Give and take between groups is needed to produce such a<br />
society. And i use " give and take" as an expression of the Australian<br />
way the fair-go.<br />
And our history has shown clearly that " give and take" the<br />
fair-go is most readily attained if the economy is<br />
expected to grow and if, in turn, the fruits of that growth<br />
are seen to be shared fairly.<br />
That is the key to Australia's future the understanding<br />
that prosperity and equity are at once mutually dependent<br />
and mutually. supporting.<br />
That is why my Government gives equal prominence both to<br />
getting economic policy right and to promoting social<br />
justice.<br />
As a nation and as a Government we have had to make hard<br />
choices. And there are hard choices and hard decisions to come.<br />
Because of world events, we have had to look very critically<br />
at the way ahead what we are doing as a nation, where we<br />
are going as a nation.<br />
We have had to begin a long and difficult process designed<br />
to shift our economy and to shift the future directions of<br />
our economy.<br />
We have had to move to make our economy less reliant on<br />
trade in mining and agricultural commodities which has<br />
stood us in good stead when the going was good.<br />
That was the historic foundation of our prosperity.<br />
in the halcyon days of the fifties and sixties, we failed to<br />
build more strongly on those foundations.<br />
Now, we have had to make our economy more reliant on other<br />
activities, which we can do just as well, but not so easily<br />
-in the fields of processing, manufacturing, high<br />
technology, and services.<br />
In that change of direction we have already come a long way<br />
-much further, much better than the cynics and sceptics and<br />
knockers would have predicted a mere two years ago.<br />
It is unfortunately true, I may say, that there is a<br />
surprising amount of negativism amongst self-appointed<br />
commentators in this country.<br />
I do trust that, in those circles, the cultural cringe is<br />
not going to be replaced by the cultural whinge. 00408 </p>
<p>As I go around the country, I hear stories great storiesabout<br />
the new things that are being done, about the exciting<br />
things that are happening stories of innovation,<br />
initiative, enterprise, a new awareness of new<br />
opportunities. There is example after example of Australian producers of<br />
manufactured goods of the most sophisticated kind, taking on<br />
and beating the best, in the world's most competitive<br />
markets. And so often, those success stories come from Australians<br />
vho have made a new start in-Australia.<br />
The great need now is to keep the process of innovation,<br />
initiative and enterprise going.<br />
Mquch has been said in recent years about the new directions<br />
in which the Australian economy must head and the great<br />
opportunities which are open to us here on the edge of the<br />
fastest growing region in the world the Pacific Rim.<br />
I will not repeat on this occasion the analysis which has<br />
brought us to this point. But as we look ahead it is B<br />
appropriate for me to re-state some points which are crucial<br />
to our ability to sustain growth through trade.<br />
The first and perhaps most obvious is that Australia has<br />
a particular interest in promoting an open world trading<br />
system. I and my Ministers have given the message of free trade, and<br />
the massive advantages to world living standards which can<br />
be derived from it, in every international forum open to us.<br />
But we cannot expect to reap the benefits of free trade<br />
vithout sustained effort on our part efforts to pursue<br />
trade promoting policies ourselves and efforts to place our<br />
industries in the best position to be able to exploit our<br />
emerging opportunities.<br />
it is true that we have already taken massive and successful<br />
steps to improve our competitiveness, lift our exports<br />
( especially in non-traditional goods and services or<br />
markets), contain the growth of our indebtedness and promote<br />
an export culture in Australia.<br />
The role of the union movement the willingness of workers<br />
to create jobs through sustained wage restraint, an<br />
unprecedented attack on outmoded work and management<br />
practices, including under the auspices of the current two<br />
tier wages system, and reduced industrial disputation, has<br />
been indispensable. 004084 </p>
<p>So, too, has been the willingness of entrepreneurs to try<br />
new ventures, to innovate, to exercise initiative, to set<br />
new and higher standards for product quality and reliability<br />
of supply and to take risks in order to reap the rewards of<br />
trade.<br />
But the task is far from complete indeed given our rapidly<br />
changing world, and especially the massive changes in<br />
prospect among the giants of our region such as China and<br />
Japan that task will never be complete.<br />
The reality is that our prosperity will not be handed us on<br />
a platter. We will have to match and better the<br />
productivity, the product quality, the creativity and the<br />
entrepreneurial flair of the world's best across all<br />
sections of the economy, even those not directly engaged in<br />
trade.<br />
That is a task for all of us. It is not one which we can<br />
take lightly. It is one which can be facilitated by the<br />
actions of Government but in the end must be executed by<br />
individuals.<br />
None of the reforms introduced so far by my Government have<br />
been painless. Equally, we can predict with virtual<br />
certainty that none of the reforms which we will find it<br />
necessary to make in the months and years to come will be<br />
painless. But we know that unless the right reforms are put<br />
in place, on time, we could sentence ourselves and our<br />
children to a much diminished future prosperity.<br />
The path we have followed for the past five years through<br />
the deregulation of our financial system, the restructuring<br />
of significant industries, the dismantling of artificial<br />
investment barriers points the way ahead for Australia in<br />
the 1990s and beyond.<br />
The fact is that Australia now faces the uncertainties of<br />
the future with three major advantages.<br />
First is a track record of having weathered a series of<br />
storms and of having found timely and correct solutions.<br />
Second is an economy which is increasing~ ly competitive,<br />
dy'manic and export oriented and thus more able to cope<br />
with changing world conditions.<br />
Thirdly, and far the most important advantage, the skills,<br />
intelligence and resourcefulness of our people.<br />
For the rest of this century the development of this most<br />
important of all our resources must be, and will be,<br />
Australia's highest priority.<br />
So we can enter our third century with confidence. 004085 </p>
<p>it is a confidence based on a sober assessment of the<br />
difficulties and problems, and of our resources to meet<br />
them. But most of all, it is a confidence based on our confidence<br />
in ourselves.<br />
I have said that the essential ingredient in making an<br />
Australian is, simply, a commitment to Australia and its<br />
future. There is one even higher commitment to make, and I make it<br />
again on behalf of the Australian Government and Australian<br />
people. And that is the unremitting commitment to seeking a secure<br />
and peaceful world.<br />
without that, all our other efforts and achievements will,<br />
ultimately, have been in vain.<br />
In this memorable year in our history, we stand, in the<br />
counsels of the world, higher than we have ever stood.<br />
Our voice on the vital issues of peace is heard and<br />
respected in Washington, in Moscow, in Western Europe, in<br />
Beijing, in Tokyo and in the great region to which we<br />
belong. Australia's voice has been at the forefront of those urging<br />
the super-powers towards meaningful negotiations leading to<br />
the agreement on intermediate nuclear arms.<br />
The prospects for real progress in disarmament between East<br />
and West are better now than at any time in the post-war era<br />
that is since the dawn of the nuclear age.<br />
We must not relax now.<br />
Rather we will intensify our efforts.<br />
There are further developments of enormous significance, now<br />
shaping the world in which Australia will live in its third<br />
century the momentous changes taking place in the People's<br />
Republic of China and in the Soviet Union.<br />
Australia is well placed to play a constructive role in<br />
encouraging these developments of immense consequence and<br />
hope for humanity.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen, and through you, all our fellow<br />
Australians: We stand together on the threshold of the third century of<br />
one of the most remarkable experiments in nation-building<br />
ever attempted in the course of human history. 0 0 4 086 </p>
<p>I No beginning could have been more unpromising.<br />
And certainly, we have many Australian achievements huge<br />
achievements to celebrate.<br />
But as I have always acknowledged at home and overseas -we<br />
Australians have mistakes to rectify, amends to make and<br />
wrongs to put right if Australia is to achieve its full<br />
promise of what it can be and should be simply the best<br />
and fairest nation on Earth. 004087 </p>
