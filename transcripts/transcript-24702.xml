    <content><![CDATA[<p>The fight against ice and illegal drugs can only be effective when the community and law enforcement agencies work together.<br />
Â <br />
Information from members of the public is an essential part in helping police and other agencies bust drug manufacture and distribution.<br />
Â <br />
To encourage the community fight against the ice epidemic, the Commonwealth Government will make available $1 million dollars to establish a national âDob in a Dealerâ campaign.<br />
Â <br />
The campaign will ask community members to report people who are dealing illegal drugs and activity that is associated with drug labs and distribution.<br />
Â <br />
It will be modelled on a similar Crime Stoppers Victoria campaign with a national focus.<br />
Â <br />
Ice use is a growing scourge right around our nation.<br />
Â <br />
Ice is ruining individuals, destroying families, and hurting communities.<br />
Â <br />
This week the Commonwealth Government announced it would strengthen the crime-fighting capabilities of the Australian Crime Commission with an additional $18 million â funded from the proceeds of crime.<br />
Â <br />
The House of Representatives passed legislation to crack down on middle-men and drug couriers bringing precursors into the country to make ice.<br />
Â <br />
We have also changed legislation to manage the proliferation of dangerous synthetic drugs at our borders.</p>
<p>As well, we are working with the states to improve the capacity of law enforcement agencies to take action against suspected criminals with unexplained wealth.<br />
While governments and police can make laws and undertake operational activities to bust drug dealers, the community is an essential partner in the fight against ice.<br />
Â <br />
The Commonwealth Government will consult and work with Crime Stoppers Australia, state and territory governments, law enforcement agencies and police and the community to continue the fight against the ice scourge in our community.<br />
Â <br />
Crime Stoppers enables every person to contribute to public safety by anonymously calling the toll-free number 1800 333 000 or using their local Crime Stoppers website to report online any criminal or suspicious behavior they have seen in their community.<br />
