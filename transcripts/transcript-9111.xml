STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING, MP<br />
VISIT BY THE PRIME MINISTER OF PAPUA NEW GUINEA<br />
I am pleased to announce that the Prime Minister of Papua New Guinea, Mr Paias<br />
-Wingti, will visit Australia from 8-14 February as a guest of the Australian<br />
Government.<br />
The Australian Government attaches a high priority to relations with Papua New<br />
Guinea. I look forward to discussing with Prime Minister Wingti the broad policy<br />
directions and objectives we have set for our countries, particularly as they relate to the<br />
region. The common interest Australia and Papua New Guinea have in engagement<br />
with Asia, including through the development of APEC, has added an important new<br />
dimension to our relationship. Prime Minister Wingti and I will also discuss a number<br />
of important bilateral issues.<br />
While in Australia, Prime Minister Wingti will also hold talks with the State<br />
Governments of Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland.<br />
