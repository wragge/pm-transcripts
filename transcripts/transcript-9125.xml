RESHAPING AUSTRALIAN INSTITUTIONS<br />
AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL UNIVERSITY, 22 FEBRUARY 1994<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
Well, thank you, Phil lip ( Adams), Vice Chancellor, Dymphna Clark, members<br />
of the Clark family, Professor, distinguished guests and ladies and<br />
gentlemen. One has always got to be careful when one is sponsored to do a talk or a<br />
lecture, universities generally appreciate the opportunities, media<br />
organisations always hype it up. And Radio National has me tonight<br />
announcing my vision for the future, and Phillip wants it all done in<br />
minutes. Where, in fact, what they asked me to do was talk about reshaping Australia's<br />
Institutions. I will do my best, Phillip, to get this in 20 minutes, but I think this<br />
is going to be a splice job for you and your colleagues, because had I known<br />
you wanted me to speak to a tight time table I would have probably had it<br />
prepared. But the fact Is it is coming, I am afraid, as it comes.<br />
Talk about reshaping Australia's institutions It might not have been possible<br />
a decade ago to propose such a subject and expect a lecture or a talk whiich<br />
went in substance to substantial changes in Australia's institution frame work<br />
because In most of the quarter century before the early 1 980s there wasn't<br />
much institutional change in Australia. It is not to say Australia didn't have<br />
institutions of value, but there wasn't much institutional change.<br />
So, I am tonight with some history and with some forethought, looking<br />
forward, talking about what I think of some of the institutional changes that<br />
have taken place, and which ones are currently moving and will take place in<br />
this decade.<br />
Perhaps the first one to start with is the appetite for change. Because there<br />
was no appetite for change in the ' 60s and the 1 970s. Australia very much<br />
was seeing change at the margins and the public, if you like, the public<br />
clamour for change, the public pressure on the political system for change, on<br />

clamour for change, the public pressure on the political system for change, on<br />
our institutions in general was not as evident as now. I think what has<br />
happened is we have developed a tremendous appetite for change, so that<br />
when this Government in the 1 980s brought forward substantial and far<br />
reaching changes it did so at its considerable political risk.<br />
Now if Governments say, look we think we have had enough change, and we<br />
don't want to burden you the public with more of it', the public said ' well thank<br />
you we will have somebody else". They want change. And there is now a<br />
very great appetite for change.<br />
So, much of what we do these days, as a nation, is we manage change. And<br />
I think we are now, we have seen unprecedented institutional reform.<br />
Australia Is now working differently, within different structures, they think<br />
differently, they have learned the need for change, but I suppose more<br />
important then anything else, they have come to believe in their capacity to<br />
change. And if the last decade means nothing, it means that our capacity for<br />
change is very substantial and very great.<br />
So, managing change, and keeping up with change is now a key matter in<br />
this country, and the appetite for change is one of the background thoughts,<br />
In a sense, across the country In the whole community which one could call<br />
Institutional change of the variety which changes the character of the country.<br />
Now, I have been one of the people Involved In public life through this period<br />
of managing change, and I thought I would run through some of these topics<br />
which come under this heading; ' Reshaping Australia's Institutions'.<br />
One of the first places to start with this, is of course, the Cabinet of the<br />
Government, and in 1991 1 gave a lecture called the ' Challenge of Public<br />
Policy in Australia', the first Chris Higgins memorial lecture. The lecture in<br />
the memory of the former Secretary of the Treasury. And I talked about the<br />
importance of Cabinet, Government and the role of Ministers, because<br />
Ministers until this Government came to office had never run the policy. The<br />
policy was in part operated by Ministers within some vague parameters, and<br />
then moved along further by the public service, but because the public<br />
service was always limited in the political authority you could bring to bear on<br />
public decision making, the changes were, of course only at the margin.<br />
So, much of the institutional change we have seen devolves to the role of<br />
Ministers. And I said this I will just read this to you from that lecture it said:<br />
' while many decry the role that politicians play, only politicians can<br />
make major changes to the way a country conducts its business.<br />
Change can not come from a bureaucracy no matter how well<br />
motivated or gifted because the bureaucracy has no authority to rank<br />
priorities or make decisions, Nor can' change come from the media<br />
and the opinions of columnists, no mAtter how imminent. In the end<br />
politicians have to have the foresight to see the need for change and </p>
<p>TEL: 23. Feb. 94 13: 15 No. 010 P. 03/ 07<br />
3<br />
the courage and strength to carry It through. That's why a strong and<br />
practical Cabinet Is absolutely essential for Australian at present and<br />
will be for years to come".<br />
And then I talked about the role of the public service and the compact which<br />
has existed in this last decade, and still exists now, between the Cabinet, the<br />
Ministry and the bureaucracy. And that's been a compact of cooperation and<br />
change so that we have seen the very best technical capacities and instincts<br />
of the civil service of this country brought to bear with a political authority<br />
which Minsters could marshal around the Cabinet table, and as a<br />
consequence Australia has advanced mightily, and we have seen Cabinet<br />
Government in a new Institutional form, of a variety of which we've, perhaps,<br />
certainly not seen in my lifetime. And because of the important need for<br />
change, rebasing the basis of our wealth, and changing our society, this<br />
came at an important time for us.<br />
That still exists and the years have only strengthened it and we now look<br />
forward in the 1 990s to the Cabinet Ministers, again deciding where the<br />
envelope of change should be pushed out. Where we, with the history of now<br />
much change behind us, where the direction should be and then having a<br />
proper appropriate bureaucratic effort In there to make it work. Now, I think<br />
that is developing the appetite for change and then being able to basically<br />
spirit the change through, or many of the changes through, in the first<br />
instance at the Government level and a wider economy I will come to later,<br />
has been a very important and fundamental institutional change in this<br />
country. Another has been managing growth and inflation. One of the other great<br />
Institutional changes In Australia which we have had now for a decade and<br />
which we are going to have In the future is a basic understanding between<br />
the Government and the organised workforce. That is, the Government and<br />
the workers of this country. It has come by way of the Accord between the<br />
Government and the ACTU. But what started as simply a fairly simple<br />
document of wage restraint In certain limited circumstances has become a<br />
way of thinking, so that as a consequence a whole productivity culture has<br />
grown up a low Inflation productivity culture, which could only be put together<br />
by the cooperation between, and the common objectives between a<br />
Government and the organised workforce of this country.<br />
As a consequence today we are looking at an Inflation rate of under 2 per<br />
cent. We saw Australia grow mightily over the last decade; bar for the<br />
recession we are seeing that growth pick up again. Australia today has 26<br />
per cent more people in work than 10 years ago, as a consequence of that<br />
accord. And In the doing of it being able to focus on a whole range of other<br />
things such as occupational superannuation, addition of national savings,<br />
diminution, of course, of Industrial disputation, but more than anything else a<br />
state of mind about productivity and being able to, at the same time, hold<br />
workers Incomes up while reducing inflation, is something that didn't exist in<br />
any institutional way before this time that exists now. </p>

The other element of that was, of course, developing a central bank, not just<br />
as a branch office of the Treasury, but something which stood in its own right,<br />
and with a great reform to the financial system of the ' 80s running a quantity<br />
based system in the financial markets. So, now monetary policy is not set by<br />
the bond selling program of the Treasury, it is set by a central bank which has<br />
now, in an open quantity system, perogatives of its own which it operates in<br />
tandem with the Government. And as a consequence, we have as a country<br />
developed a new institution. It is still called the Reserve Bank, it still has the<br />
same Reserve Bank Act as it had in 1959, devoted as it is to price stability<br />
and full employment, but what we have is a new institution which we have<br />
effectively used together in another institutional process of change between<br />
the Government and the Board of the Central Bank to deal with growth and<br />
inflation simultaneously. And as a consequence that is the other arm of the<br />
anti Inflation machinery which institutionally we have set up between the<br />
ACTU and the Government under the Accord, and with a cooperative process<br />
of common objectives between the board of the Central Bank and the<br />
Government. Now, I was going to quote here a couple of things from the Reserve Bank Act,<br />
but for time I will shorten them. It says:<br />
" The duty of the Board is to do in its opinion what best will contribute to<br />
the stability of the currency and maintenance of full employment in<br />
Australia, the economic prosperity and welfare of the people of<br />
Australia. The Board shall from time to time inform the Government of<br />
the monetary and banking policy of the bank, and in the event of a<br />
difference the Treasurer and the Board shall endeavour to reach<br />
agreement."<br />
So, those very wise words drafted so long ago have been given new meaning<br />
in an institution which Is effectively new, brought and given authority by this<br />
Government in a new financial system which is helping us develop a low<br />
inflationary culture. It is a very hard thing for any country to develop a central<br />
bank of substance that can effectively deal with inflation and do it in the<br />
context of a wage compact. So, these are significant and important<br />
Institutional changes we have brought along with us.<br />
The other, I think, enduring national institutional change is the change of the<br />
Australian Labor Party. The Labor Party is now a party of economic reform; it<br />
is a party of social democracy; it is a party of social progress; it is a party<br />
which has developed an open competitive model for its society, and grafted<br />
on to It a fair and equitable social wage and social system. As well as that it<br />
is a party which understands the culture of the nation and it is a party which<br />
feels that the identity of the nation, and issues of identity, are important to it.<br />
Whatever people may think of the Labor Party it will never regress to being<br />
what it was in the 1950s and the 1 960s or even the 1970s. So, in terms of<br />
institutional change, if a major party of Government which is what the Labor </p>
<p>I-' 05 7<br />
TEL: 23. Feb. 94 13: 15 No. 010 P. 050<br />
Party is can in its, perhaps, most significant reformation, plot out for itself a<br />
world ranking course in setting up a middle sized OECD economy in its image<br />
as an open competitive economic society which also has tolerance and<br />
fairness underpinning its social fabric, then I think, in institutional terms we<br />
have done mightily to secure that change. It is one of the important ones.<br />
But the changes in reshaping institutions have not been limited to just what<br />
has happened in Australia, but what Is also happening and what we have<br />
done for ourselves in the international market place. We have through our<br />
foreign policy and our trade policies, built institutions outside of Australia and<br />
let me just name a couple for you: The Cairns Group, which was influential in<br />
the GATT Round, was largely managed by Australia, the United States and<br />
France and the European community, APEC, Asia Pacific Economic<br />
Cooperation, which throws an economic, if you like, net across the Asia<br />
Pacific, which actually builds an institution for Australia to participate in;<br />
outside of Australia the Asean Regional Forum for security dialogue, when<br />
ASEAN was an organisation which had very tentative discussions about<br />
many things it is now actually discussing full-bloodedly its security position;<br />
and of course things we have done in chemical weapons, Cambodia and<br />
other things.<br />
This is another institutional change, that is, rather than simply playing a<br />
marginalsed role In the foreign policy fora of the world, Australia Is actually<br />
out there creating Institutions and finding a place for this country. Now, with<br />
that background, that is these very important, I think, institutional changes<br />
developing an appetite for change, being confident about the countries<br />
capacity to change, that is the country itself being confident about its capacity<br />
to change.<br />
The actual vehicle of change, developing the Cabinet process, the role of<br />
Ministers as the spearhead of change and doing it in a compact with a<br />
cooperative altruistic civil service, managing growth and inflation, keeping the<br />
core elements of competitiveness In place, are key to any institutional shift in<br />
any country and the whole culture of productivity which has come into the<br />
bargain and in the doing of it reshaping one of our major parties.<br />
Now, for the future there is much that still has to be done about institutional<br />
change. Perhaps, one of the changes is going to come, let me say two areas.<br />
One is identity, us being, importantly, being confident about ourselves and<br />
about those things which symbollse ourselves and the other is keeping the<br />
economic and social change moving through our society. And a lot of this<br />
goes after the great macro-economic changes of the 1 980s. It goes to the<br />
micro changes in industry, in business, in the States, in this decade. And<br />
what, I think, we will see is an Institutional change where we will see a much<br />
more cooperative relationship developing between the Commonwealth and<br />
the States. But built around, what I think, was one of the central institutional<br />
changes of Australia In this century and that was uniform taxation in 1942.<br />
Uniform taxation is the glue that holds the federation together. It is the<br />
reason we are one nation with one economy. But with that foundation there Is </p>

now much to be done about the perogatives of the States and the<br />
Commonwealth In managing this great country of ours and choosing to work<br />
cooperatively together to deal with the great micro-economic areas of this<br />
country, much that we have to do.<br />
Let me Just say that this change must also manifest itself in business and not<br />
simply with the States. I think we need a new partnership, a new sharing of<br />
responsibility for change. We mightn' t get it, but now Is the time, I think, the<br />
natural time to invite one. And with the election behind us, with all these<br />
benefits of the past we can, I think, enter a new period where we can call<br />
upon a new commitment to advance ourselves.<br />
Over the coming decade I would like to see a new relationship with the States<br />
evolve, based on four principals. The first of these is that we recognise that<br />
the States have a vital role as units of Government in Australia, because<br />
there is this debate, which you often see from time to time, about abolishing<br />
States. As I said some time ago, if we didn't have States we would almost<br />
need to Invent them for the great regional, management and disparities of this<br />
country. The second principal should be that both the Commonwealth and the States<br />
should independently assess the value of reforms and use them for their own<br />
sake, not as part of a deal in which the Commonwealth is supposed to buy<br />
the cooperation of the States. That is, change in the great micro-economic<br />
areas of the States, in electricity, in water, in gas, in ports, in rail, in all these<br />
things, should be seen by States as a change of advantage to them and their<br />
citizens and not something where the Commonwealth has to buy that change<br />
and that cooperation.<br />
The third principal should be that we are willing to enter into a genuine<br />
discussion between heads of Government and portfolio Ministers to look at<br />
the present roles and responsibilities of the States and the Commonwealth, to<br />
see that where we can develop and deliver better policy outcomes, but where<br />
the Commonwealth Government will always have a role in setting priorities<br />
and national objectives to social programs such as health and education, as<br />
well as the environment and economic programs.<br />
And the fourth principal is that while the. Commonwealth believes the States<br />
should be adequately resourced it should be taken as understood that the<br />
Commonwealth will not be party to any substantial transfer of Commonwealth<br />
taxing powers to the States.<br />
Now, within those four principals we have the opportunity to cooperatively<br />
develop, I think, a new commitment, if you like, a new consensus, a new<br />
understanding between the Commonwealth and the States about how to<br />
make these important areas of the micro economy change. The<br />
Commonwealth has largely done Its things in telecommunications, in<br />
banking, in air transport what remains to be, done now is largely with the<br />
States and it is also with business, because a Commonwealth Government .010 P. 06/ 07 </p>
<p>TEL: 23. Feb. 94 13: 15 No. 010 P. 07/ 07<br />

can't change the productive culture of an Individual enterprise. That must be<br />
done by business, and business should take up the challenge of enterprise<br />
bargaining with the workforce to make that productive and institutional<br />
change, certainly enterprise change, within those particular businesses.<br />
So, we have got, I think, If you like, having come so far and now looking at the<br />
areas where we need to see more sophisticated changes, put the polish on<br />
the changes to find, If you like, another institutional shift. It is In a cooperative<br />
venture between the Commonwealth and the States in these areas, and also<br />
further cooperation between Labor and business under the aegis of<br />
enterprise bargaining in search of higher productivity, higher incomes and<br />
better profits. This is the institutional change we need for the 1990s.<br />
Now, you have heard me say often I mentioned it earlier I don't think a<br />
country can sell itself until it knows what it wants to sell of itself, how it wants<br />
to present itself, how It wants to be viewed and be seen. And so, therefore, I<br />
believe issues of identity, being clear about our identity, being clear about the<br />
culture that we have become and that we wish to represent, its symbols are<br />
an Important part of how we as a nation will behave and present ourselves in<br />
the 1 990s. But we have seen much reshaping of Institutions in these last ten<br />
years, my point Is we are going on doing it. And the changes we have see,<br />
are changes I think forever, they are not changes which are going to be<br />
turned back. But what we have to do now Is search out the new ones, so that<br />
if we were giving a lecture on this topic In a decade hence, we would be able<br />
to say that in these areas of productivity, of international engagement, of<br />
change In the culture at the work place, change in the relationship between<br />
the Commonwealth and the States, this was another great Institutional<br />
change. I should hope In 10 or 15 years, we would have been able to reshape our<br />
Institutions in a way that compensated for the quarter century or so that we<br />
failed to do this. As a consequence Australia is stronger and better for it.<br />
Thank you very much. </p>
