VIOLENCE IN BANGKOK<br />
Now that the full extent and character of the recent<br />
violence in Bangkok has become cl ' earer, I take the<br />
opportunity on behalf of all Australians to express our<br />
horror at the actions which have led to this needless<br />
loss of life.<br />
We are appalled at the widespread use of excessive force<br />
by the Thai military..<br />
The Thai Ambassador is being called in today to the<br />
Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to be told of the<br />
strength of Australia's concern over the situation in<br />
Thailand. Our.-Ambassador to Thailand is under<br />
instructions to repeat these concerns at senior level in<br />
Bangkok.<br />
Our Embassy In Thailand is closely monitoring<br />
developments in particular the tense stan~ d-off between<br />
pro-democracy demonstrators and troops at Ramkhamhaeng<br />
University. I urge the Thai Government to ensure that<br />
the troops act with maximum restraint to avoid further<br />
bloodshed. Footage of troops firing on unarmed demonstrators outside<br />
the Royal Hotel, and the harrowing scenes depicted in the<br />
hotel lobby and elsewhere, are in tragic contrast with<br />
the great strides Thailand has made in recent years<br />
towards prosperity and stability.<br />
I hope that the Thai Government will do all in its power<br />
to restore conditions whereby political differences can<br />
be resolved peacefully.<br />
The Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Mr<br />
Kerin, will be closely following developments in<br />
Thailand. We will be looking at our relations with<br />
Thailand in the light of how the situation unfolds.<br />
