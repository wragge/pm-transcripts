    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Governor-General has appointed Mr Michael Thawley AO as Secretary of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet for a period of five years commencing 1 December 2014.</p>
<p>Mr Thawley has already provided significant service to Australia and brings a wealth of experience in both the public and private sectors to his appointment.</p>
<p>He was Australia’s Ambassador to the United States between 2000 and 2005, during which time Australia successfully concluded the Australia-US Free Trade Agreement, ensuring greater access to the US market for Australian products. He has also held a number of senior Australian government positions including in the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Office of National Assessments.</p>
<p>In addition to over three decades of experience in the Australian Public Service, Mr Thawley was the senior adviser on international relations to former Prime Minister, the Hon. John Howard OM AC.</p>
<p>Most recently Mr Thawley has been Senior Vice President of Capital Research and Management Company and of Capital Strategy Research Inc, one of the world’s largest investment management businesses.</p>
<p>Mr Thawley’s appointment follows the resignation of Dr Ian Watt AO.</p>
<p>Dr Watt has had a long and distinguished career at the highest levels of the Australian Public Service including appointments as the Secretary of the Departments of Communications, Finance, Defence and the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet.</p>
<p>He has served successive governments with distinction and his contribution to public administration in Australia has been wide ranging.</p>
<p>On behalf of the Government, I thank him for his years of dedication to the Australian Public Service and I look forward to his future contributions to our community.</p>
