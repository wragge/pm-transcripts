TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING, MP<br />
INTERVIEW WITH STAN GRANT, REAL LIFE<br />
13 MARCH 1992<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
SG: Prime Minister welcome. It makes your job of pursuing<br />
a one Australia vision pretty difficult, when people<br />
have attitudes like those displayed by the two police<br />
officers doesn't it?<br />
PM: I think that is true. There can't be any concept of<br />
' One Nation' until we are, non-Aboriginal Australians<br />
are, at peace and come to terms with Aboriginal<br />
Australians.<br />
SG: I might be a little bit cynical here Prime Minister,<br />
that although what I saw last night disgusted me, and<br />
it certainly did, it didn't surprise me, did it really<br />
surprise you?<br />
PM: It did actually. I thought these characters were<br />
throw-backs. I think Australians have now come to<br />
understand more about Aboriginal culture, are more<br />
sympathetic now than perhaps they've ever been, more<br />
prepared to see change, good change to better<br />
intergrate Aboriginal Australians into the broader<br />
society. So I actually thought this was something one<br />
would expect from another period.<br />
I<br />
SG: So you don't accept the view put about by a lot of<br />
people that what we've seen, not only last night, but<br />
the week before with the Redfern police, they're<br />
attitudes simply mirroring a deeper attitude felt right<br />
through the Australian community. You don't accept<br />
that?<br />
PM: I don't think so. No, obviously what we saw the other<br />
night on television is there now, this is a year or two<br />
ago. The fact is, I think these are still minority<br />
attitudes, but the fact that they existed is disturbing </p>
<p>and the whole point of the reconciliation process is to<br />
come to terms with those things.<br />
SG: On the mat~ ter with the two police individually, do you<br />
think they have a right to remain as members of the<br />
police for-ce?,<br />
PM: Well, I was heartened by the fact that the police<br />
Minister i. n New South Wales told the Aboriginal Affairs<br />
Minister this morning that they were going to take some<br />
action, I can't remember exactly what they had in mind<br />
against the two officers, I think they are standing<br />
them down from active duty. And that they would<br />
respond setriously to the recommendations of the Royal<br />
Commission on Aboriginal Deaths in Custody. So I think<br />
New South Wales Government and the New South Wales<br />
Police force is taking this very seriously.<br />
SG: There is a. greater problem here though, isn't there?<br />
Aboriginal Aus9tralia tends to lurch from one disaster<br />
to another. The Black Deaths in Custody Royal<br />
Commission is just one. What is going to happen<br />
eventually to improve the loss of Aboriginal<br />
Australians, because certainly throwing money at it<br />
really hasn't worked, has it?<br />
PM: No, it is much about attitudes that what's in our minds<br />
as it is about money. And that's why the Government<br />
is taking the Aboriginal Deaths in Custody Royal<br />
Commission recommendations seriously. We think this is<br />
an opportunityperhaps to last in this decade to do<br />
something again in material, to materially improve the<br />
lot of Aboriginal Australians. And this is our<br />
opportunity I think, and we are going to, we are now<br />
seriously looking at this, and also enjoining the<br />
States to -be in it. But it is an attitudinal thing and<br />
the poverty of Aboriginal Australians only makes the<br />
whole country poorer.<br />
SG: I think back to my childhood, and I look at the<br />
situation Aborigines were in then, and you would recall<br />
it as well, it, hasn't really improved and yet as I say<br />
money has been thrown at the problem. And is it fair<br />
to say also do' you think, that the more moeny that's<br />
thrown at Aborigines causes more resentment in the<br />
wider community?<br />
PM: If it does, it's unfair. I mean we spend a little less<br />
than $ 5,000 per head on the Aboriginal population, and<br />
most of it goes into things that matter. I've got: a<br />
chart here now'showing where the money is spent. only<br />
a third of it goes into labour market programs, the<br />
rest goes iLntoeducation, health, housing and community<br />
services, i -ndustry assistance. I think it is a great<br />
shame if Australians believe that this area has been<br />
indulged. It isn't. There has to be more done here. </p>
<p>SG: But you would accept that there is that perception,<br />
and there is also the perception that a lot of money is<br />
wasted by Government agencies and also by Aboriginal<br />
groups?<br />
PM: Well, I'd like to think that's not true. One can not<br />
be certain about the delivery of any program, but this<br />
has been tightened up over the years. But the fact is,<br />
we've now as a Government got another chance to look at<br />
the delivery of Aboriginal programs in response to the<br />
Royal Commission, and we're doing that. We'll be<br />
engaging the States as well. And, through the broader<br />
process, the reconciliation process, that we can<br />
actually come to terms with it attitudinally, as well<br />
as in program delivery.<br />
SG: On the issue of the Royal Commission, now $ 500 million<br />
was recommended by the Royal Commission to be put into<br />
that area. What is being done there, because only half<br />
of that money has actually been approved by the<br />
Government hasn't it?<br />
PM: Well, the Royal Commission didn't recommend an amount<br />
of money. It's a matter for the Government to respond.<br />
What we'll be ' doing, in the first instance, responding<br />
to the law and justice recommendations of the Royal<br />
CommissionL, and adequately funding those changes to<br />
make sure those recommendations are met. But if we go<br />
beyond that and look at the underlying causes and<br />
reasons inl poverty or opportunity, or lack of<br />
opportunit~ y which exists, lack of employment<br />
opportunities ' which exist for Aboriginal people, if we<br />
look at those issues, they'll be the subject of a<br />
second statement to Parliament. And we're now looking<br />
to make sure that that statement is right that what<br />
we do does, when I say right, as best we can, design<br />
those programs to be of most assistance to Aboriginal<br />
people.<br />
SG: Prime Minister, just finally and fairly quickly, has<br />
what you've seen over the last week, has that spurred<br />
you on to any greater heights to really finally do<br />
something about this? Can you now set some sort of<br />
timetable where you can say in 18 months that these<br />
attitudes that now exist are now going to be gone?<br />
PM: Well, I don't think I can say that, but we've got to<br />
continue to work at it. But the fact is that non-<br />
Aboriginal Australians must come to terms with the<br />
poverty of Aboriginal Australians and the inequality of<br />
their opportunities. And until we do, we won't be able<br />
to claim the name, the notion of ' One Nation', and<br />
therefore it is a matter of great urgency for us as a<br />
society. And, I for one will be taking this<br />
opportunity we have with the Royal Commission's<br />
recommendations seriously, and this very untimely<br />
incident only encourages me in that exercise. </p>
