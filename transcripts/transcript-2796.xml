1R. E. G. ' IIIITLAI, ALBURY CIVIC CENTRE,<br />
JAUPJARY 1973<br />
This is an historic meeting. It is the first time on<br />
which the Governments of the two oldest and most important<br />
States have come together with the Commonwealth to plan the<br />
development of a new cityo I trust it will signal the beginning,<br />
not only of similar regional development projects, but of a<br />
new spirit of common enterprise within our Federation. The<br />
Murray River, once the symbol of colonial separation and<br />
interstate rivalries, may yet come to stand for a new era<br />
of interstate co-operation.<br />
All three Governments represented here are committed<br />
to decentralisation. Nevr South Wales and Victoria have worked<br />
towards this goal over many years. But my Government believes<br />
that only with the active participation of the Commonwealth,<br />
in a scheme involving all three Governments as well as the<br />
local authorities, can real decentralisation be achieved.<br />
This enterprise is therefore a challenge to our energy,<br />
our ability to work together, and our determination to ensure<br />
the success of a pilot project which may one day convert our<br />
former dreams and theories into living and concrete reality.<br />
On the outcome of this task, the whole future of decentralisation<br />
in this country may stand or fall.<br />
My Government is committed to the concept of building<br />
new cities. In my policy speech last November, I announced that<br />
at first we would concentrate our initiatives and endeavours in<br />
the Albury-Wodonga area. In making this choice, we were conscious<br />
that as a national Government our involvement would benefit two<br />
States, and ease the pressure on our two largest cities Sydney<br />
and Melbourne. As I have mentioned, we regard th-is project as only<br />
the first of several new cities with the development of which<br />
we will be involved. Te are determined, therefore, to use our<br />
full resources to ensure its success. We believe that the<br />
chances of success are high. Its location on the transport<br />
corridor between Melbourne and Sydney will be attractive to<br />
industry. It has an adequate supply of water. It is<br />
convenient to major recreational areas, and its natural<br />
environment provides a beautiful setting.<br />
Let me outline briefly what the Commonwealth hopes to<br />
see happen at Albury-Wodonga. We look first of all, for a<br />
significant acceleration of population growth. Much of this<br />
increased population would, we hope, be made up of people<br />
who would otherwise have gone to Sydney or Melbourne. We<br />
want to see Albury-Wodonga achieve the status of a major<br />
city. We set no limit; to its growth, but believe that if<br />
the new city is to achieve its major purpose it should have<br />
at least 300,000 people. And this growth will be planned / 2 </p>
<p>-2-<br />
to ensure a auality of life at the highest level; Pollution<br />
will be controlled: The environment protected.<br />
The economic benefits of this development must pass<br />
to the people of Australia. Large sums of public money must<br />
be spent. ' e believe that this can give a good return but<br />
we must ensure that the return is to the community at large<br />
and is not tapped off to provide an unearned ain to land<br />
speculators. ie want land to be cheap and its use to be<br />
controlled in such a way that the new city is both beautiful<br />
and efficient. ' JI also want home ownership in the new city<br />
to be less of a burden to families than it has become in the<br />
major Australian cities. To th: is end the Common. wealth believes<br />
that the leasehold system must. prevail.<br />
From the beginning of this major project, we want local<br />
people to be involved in its planning and operation. ' Je hope<br />
that the machinery w hich is devined to develop and operate this<br />
new city will, in at least some respects, become a model for<br />
future local and regional Governmento<br />
The Australian Government has available in the<br />
.' ational Capital Development Commission and the ilTational Urban<br />
and legional Development authority the fund of technical<br />
expertise which has conceived, planned and built in Canberra,<br />
the only substantial new Australian city of our time. For<br />
historical and constitutional reasons we have had a particular<br />
connection with the Murray Ilivcro The Commonwealth will be<br />
associated with supplying the quantity of water required by<br />
the now city through the Snowy Mountains Authority and the<br />
Å“ ivcr Murray Commission.<br />
Let me outline now the steps my Government has already<br />
taken to ensure the success of this ventureo<br />
The Postmaster-General's Department has been instructed<br />
to prepare a report on the cost of recognising Albury-Wodonga<br />
as an extension of the iMetropolitan area of both Sydney and<br />
Melbourne, for the purpose of heeping telephone and telex charges<br />
at a suitable level for industry.<br />
The Australian Universities Commission and the<br />
Australian Council of Advanced Education have, as I have already<br />
indicated in my letters to Sir Robert Askin and Mr. Ilamer on<br />
the 15th of December, been instructed to confer and report on<br />
the provision of tertiary education facilities in this area.<br />
In accordance with the recommendations of Sir Henry<br />
Bland on the Victorian Land Transport System, the Bureau of<br />
Transport E: conomics has been instructed to investigate the<br />
impact of inter-system rating practices on rail traffic from<br />
the Riverina. All Departments in the Federal Government have been<br />
asked to investigate the possibility of locating divisions of<br />
the Public Service in Albury-Wodonga / 3 </p>
<p>-3-<br />
The new Department of Tourism and Recreation has<br />
been instructed to investigate tourist development in Albury-<br />
Wodonga and to recommend a program for increasing it.<br />
Finally, as you are aware, my Government is committed<br />
to amending the Commonwealth Grants Commission Act to give local<br />
authorities access to the Commission. We propose to encourage<br />
all relevant local authorities in the Albury-Wodonga area to<br />
consult and co-operate in preparing such a submission on -a<br />
regional basis. The new Department of Urban Affairs and<br />
Regional Development will make its expert advisers available<br />
to any co-operative effort among the local authorities.<br />
I do not wish to anticipate the detailed decisions<br />
that will flow from this meeting, but I trust we will reach<br />
common agreement on our objectives, and set in motion a<br />
feasibility study of the project. I hope we will reach<br />
agreement upon the general structure and essential powers<br />
of the tripartite development authority, on the structure<br />
of consultation an%' supervision at Ministerial level, and<br />
the procedure for involvement of local authorities.<br />
I am grateful to the Governments of New South Wales<br />
and Victoria for their generous co-operation in-this scheme<br />
and for the valuable work they have already done to ensure<br />
its success. Let us bend all our efforts to work in harmony<br />
together and achieve our aims. None of us here is indifferent<br />
to the present sprawling growth of our major cities, with all<br />
the waste, the pollution, the inefficiency they bring, and the<br />
baneful effect of their unchecked growth on the living standards<br />
of our people. Here is a chance, in the most literal sense, to<br />
build for tomorrow and improve the lives not only of the people<br />
of this region, but of other cities, today and in times to come. </p>
