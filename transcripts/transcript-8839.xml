PRIME MINISTER<br />
STATEMM HY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE SoN P J KEATING Hip<br />
ADELAIDE TO DARWIN RAIL LINK<br />
The Prime Minister announced today that the next Labor<br />
Government will comit $ 3 million to complete thqaiurreying<br />
work necessary for a rail-lnk between Alice Springs and<br />
Darwin. Such a rail-link has been advocated by various interests for<br />
some time, including especially the Northern Territory<br />
Government. The Commonwealth Government has told the Northern<br />
Territory Government that it woul' welcome any commercially<br />
viable proposal, and indeed would actively facilitate its<br />
approval and construction. It would support the inmeatwt<br />
through-nfraStructure bonds attracting concessional taxation.<br />
To date, however, commercial proposals have not been<br />
forthcoming. Part of the difficulty has been arriving at<br />
accurate figures for the cost of building the rail-link.<br />
Indeed, the recently formed Australian Rail Develoet<br />
Cc has requested Government assistance In completing the<br />
munL9z. ng and pegging of the route. Of the 1400 kilostres<br />
Involved, all but 300 kilometres has been surveyed. The next<br />
Labor Government in happy to fund the remaining surveying so<br />
that the commercial viability of future proposals can be more<br />
accurately ascertained.<br />
Labor is committed to an efficient natj! onal-railnetwqr. We<br />
have provided substantial Investment in a standard gauge<br />
national network through the One Nation funding. We provided<br />
additional funds in the budget for the Islington workshops in<br />
Adelaide. We have also provided-funi4ng for the upgrade of<br />
the workshops of Port Augusta, and more importantly, for the<br />
refurbishment of the Indian Pacific train.<br />
Our record once again stands in stark contrast to that of tho<br />
Opposition who simply do not believe in a central role for<br />
Government. Fightback! would cut $ 87 million from land<br />
transport, including $ 15 million from Australian National<br />
Railways.<br />
