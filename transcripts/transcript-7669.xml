TRANSCRIPT OF NEWS CONFERENCE, PARLIAMENT HOUSE<br />
JULY 1989<br />
E 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
JOURNALIST: When are interest rates going to come down<br />
Prime Minister?<br />
PM: You haven't learnt anything since I've been away. You<br />
know I don't make a prediction about that. All I'm saying<br />
is what I said before I went. That is that all arms of<br />
policy, including monetary policy, will remain as tight as<br />
they need to be for as long as they need to be to achieve<br />
the objective of policy, and that is to bring down the level<br />
of demand in the economy. There are mixed signals at the<br />
moment as to whether that is being achieved at the rate that<br />
we would like but on balance my own feeling is that we are<br />
starting now to see the impact of the tightness of the three<br />
arms of policy, including particularly monetary policy. As<br />
I say, all those arms of policy will be kept tight until<br />
we've achieved the objective which is necessary and that is<br />
to get a greater, a more appropriate correlation between the<br />
level of demand and production in the economy. We can't<br />
continue a situation where essentially we have demand<br />
running at 10-11% and supply at about five per cent. We're<br />
not going to move away from having policy calculated to<br />
eliminate that gap.<br />
JOURNALIST: While you were away Prime minister some<br />
backbenchers, including Bob McMullan, said there should be<br />
an increase in sales tax on luxury goods and possibly<br />
postpone the drop in the top marginal rate in order to<br />
finance a mortgage relief package for the lower income<br />
earners. Will that be seriously considered, that type of<br />
proposal? PM: Let me say again what I have said before I went away.<br />
When you're conducting economic policy you try and keep<br />
abreast of whatever range of suggestions may be made about<br />
relevant areas of policy. Now that doesn't mean, and I want<br />
to make it quite clear, it doesn't mean because some work<br />
may be done in certain areas that there is any intention of<br />
bringing into effect the sort of proposal upon which that<br />
work is based. We regard it as appropriate that all members<br />
of the Government, including backbenchers, should have their<br />
ideas about economic policy and other areas of policy.<br />
where we think that it's appropriate to do any work on a<br />
particular suggestion which may in fact have been done any<br />
rate, then that will be done. But I want to make it clear<br />
that as far as the settings of economic policy are<br />
concerned, we think that they are right. Any suggestions </p>
<p>-2-<br />
PM ( cont): about a luxury tax for instance cannot be seen,<br />
and I wouldn't imagine are seen, by any of its proponents as<br />
going to the fundamentals of policy. By definition it only<br />
affects a particular area of demand. It can't therefore be<br />
a substitute for the basic settings which, as I say, we<br />
believe are correctly set.<br />
JOURNALIST: How seriously is the Government considering a<br />
mortgage support scheme?<br />
PM: It's not a correct statement to say that the Government<br />
is considering it. All I would say is that that's an area<br />
where you would need a lot of work to be done before it<br />
could even be considered. It would require a great deal of<br />
work. The fact that work can be done, I want to emphasise,<br />
does not mean that any such proposal will be implemented.<br />
As I had cause to say before I went away and I merely repeat<br />
now, it seems to me that in regard to some suggestions that<br />
are made it is appropriate for work to be done and that will<br />
be done. But we will look at any such suggestions in the<br />
context of the overall setting of economic policy. What<br />
I've got to emphasise again to all of you is that as far as<br />
the three settings of policy, that is fiscal, wages and<br />
monetary, we believe that those settings are fundamentally<br />
correct. Any of these suggestions cannot be seen, and would<br />
not be seen, as any substitute for those fundamentals.<br />
JOURNALIST: When do we find out the Government's attitude<br />
on these suggestions? In the Budget or before?<br />
PM: We're about something like six weeks away from the<br />
Budget. We'll be getting into the hard work of ERC in the<br />
very near future. I think it would be unlikely that any<br />
significant decisions would be made before the Budget which<br />
is, as I say, in six weeks time. It would be very unusual I<br />
would imagine for anything to be done before that.<br />
SJOURNALIST: Is it going too far to call this kind of<br />
suggestion and the work that's being done now work on<br />
ratbaggery?<br />
PM: I think some proposals that I've seen could, without<br />
an undue stretching of the English language, attract that<br />
sort of label. But I wouldn't apply it to all the<br />
suggestions that have been made.<br />
JOURNALIST: Would revamping the First Home Owners Scheme be<br />
an appropriate way of reducing the pressure on people<br />
suffering under high interest rates?<br />
PM: I understand some suggestions have been made in that<br />
regard but you would have to have considerable doubts about<br />
any proposals which involved increases in the outlays side I<br />
would think in the present circumstances where what you're<br />
concerned about is bringing back the level of demand. </p>
<p>-3-<br />
JOURNALIST: Is there any possibility that the top tax rate<br />
cut due for January will be postponed?<br />
PM: That's not something I've considered.<br />
JOURNALIST: Are you satisfied with the way Mr Willis is<br />
handling the question of waterfront reform?<br />
PM: Yes.<br />
JOURNALIST: A bit slow though isn't it?<br />
PM: I've given you my answer. Let's talk about slow. What<br />
are your standards of slowness? I can't remember, not that<br />
I must confess that I'm an avid reader of your writing, but<br />
I don't recall in my passing reference to your scribblings<br />
that I ever saw in the period of the seven years of the<br />
conservative government that you were talking about rates of<br />
reform in that area then. But if we were to set the<br />
standards of that period as relevant, then what's being done<br />
by this Government in the area of microreform generally and<br />
on the waterfront and the maritime industry in particular is<br />
a hurricane pace.<br />
JOURNALIST: Did you get a feeling overseas during your<br />
recent visit that the international economic outlook is more<br />
positive than has generally been thought and that this might<br />
give greater support to the Government's economic policies<br />
over the next 12 months?<br />
PM: I'm certainly not going to use reverse policy now that<br />
I'm home going to refuse to talk about overseas matters.<br />
Let me say that generally speaking, yes. I thought that the<br />
sorts of things that were being said by the politicians, the<br />
political leaders to whom I spoke and economic commentators,<br />
seem to me to be putting a somewhat more optimistic view<br />
about the level of activity in the year or so ahead than<br />
perhaps had been talked about before I left. That I think<br />
is a reflection of two things. Both the types of policies<br />
that are being followed by the major economies and related<br />
to that the sorts of-assumptions that are being made about<br />
commodity prices over the same period. If you take the two<br />
things into account I think it is valid to say that the<br />
international settings within which we'll be operating in<br />
this period that you refer to are somewhat better than<br />
perhaps had been anticipated earlier this year.<br />
JOURNALIST: What's your response to the Fitzgerald inquiry<br />
findings, in particular the gerrymander recommendations?<br />
PM: Let me say generally that I think Mr Fitzgerald has<br />
performed magnificently. It's very difficult to comprehend<br />
the magnitude of the material that he had to deal with,<br />
comprehend, distill and then report on. I join with others<br />
who congratulate him on a job well done. I think he rightly<br />
makes a quite foundational point that if you have government<br />
corruptly elected and I'll explain that in a moment then </p>
<p>-4-<br />
PM ( cont): you are likely to have the circumstances in<br />
which corruption can flourish. When I say corruptly<br />
elected, the electoral system is obviously a corrupt one in<br />
the sense that there is a perversion of the system in terms<br />
of giving one particular group an overwhelming advantage.<br />
It helped to create the situation in which that group<br />
thought it could never be thrown out of government because<br />
the system was corrupt, the electoral system was corrupt.<br />
If you have a government which thinks i-t can never be put<br />
out of office then that is precisely the sort of environment<br />
within which corruption can flourish. That was the essence<br />
of the analysis by Mr Fitzgerald and it was for that reason<br />
logically that he therefore said that there should be<br />
immediately moves to end that corrupt electoral system. Let<br />
me say on that that it is somewhat surprising to me that the<br />
Premier of Queensland who has said he will deliver lock,<br />
stock and barrel on the recommendations of Fitzgerald should<br />
now be hedging, as he so obviously is, on that foundational<br />
point and talking of conceivably going to the next election<br />
on this corrupt basis, this corrupt electoral basis. In<br />
that regard let me say this. The Australian Electoral<br />
Commission has, I believe, an enviable record for integrity<br />
and competence and I understand that the Australian<br />
Electoral Commission would be happy to provide such<br />
assistance to the Queensland review as is appropriate. Now<br />
let me make it clear what I'm saying there. I'm not trying<br />
to intrude the Federal Government into this matter but I am<br />
saying if there's some suggestion about a difficulty of<br />
getting a review in Queensland in the time scale before the<br />
next state election is scheduled for then I understand that<br />
the services of the Australian Electoral Commission could be<br />
available. I would certainly ensure that whatever resources<br />
were required were made available. But I make it quite<br />
clear that's a matter for the Queensland government. I'm<br />
simply saying to the Queensland government that if they want<br />
the assistance of the resources of the Australian Electoral<br />
Commission I understand that the Australian Electoral<br />
Commission is available and I'm saying that I would ensure<br />
that whatever resources were necessary to facilitate that<br />
would be made available.<br />
JOURNALIST: There's been new recent support from economic<br />
experts and business for a consumption tax. Are your<br />
arguments against such a tax, which would help increase<br />
savings, essentially political or are they economic and<br />
could you outline them?<br />
PM: The essential economic argument of course Michelle is<br />
that this was on the table some years ago. It was rejected<br />
by a pretty broad spectrum of the community. In the context<br />
of that rejection we then moved to a very broad<br />
diversification of the tax base by a range of measures with<br />
which you are familiar. We are now faced with a situation<br />
where one of the issues that we have to be sure that we have<br />
under control is the question of inflation. That is<br />
important intrinsically. It's also very important in terms<br />
of getting the appropriate wages outcome. I can't stress<br />
too much in terms of the appropriate economic policies at </p>
<p>PM ( cant): this time the crucial nature of the wages policy<br />
that we've got and getting the right wages outcome. If<br />
you'll excuse me I'll just spend a moment on this. It's<br />
directly relevant to your question. We expect, as you know,<br />
to get out of the wages system in 1989-90 a wages increase<br />
of the order of six and a half per cent. Anything that was<br />
to disrupt that by the expectation of a significantly<br />
greater inflationary outcome than the one which has been<br />
talked about would be economically disa-strous. May I say,<br />
it's our capacity to get an appropriate wages outcome which<br />
amongst other things very significantly distinguishes the<br />
Government from the Opposition. I am amazed still to see<br />
while I'm away and when I get back that they are talking<br />
about a wages policy which would again guarantee the<br />
economic disaster for Australia that they inflicted upon<br />
Australia when last in office. They inflicted the disaster<br />
of 11% unemployment, the first time the economy had gone<br />
into negative growth, the worst recession for 50 years for<br />
many reasons but essentially the main reason was they had no<br />
wages policy. We have and that's what can guarantee that<br />
the Government rather than the Opposition can effect the<br />
proper handling of economic policy in this country. But you<br />
see Michelle, if you were to talk about a consumption tax<br />
now you would undermine the very foundation of your wages<br />
policy. Because that outcome that we're talking about of<br />
six and a half per cent, which is historically an<br />
unbelievably low rate of inflation given the level of<br />
economic activity, would be brought asunder if in fact the<br />
unions believed that you were going to be having an<br />
inflation outcome significantly different from that which<br />
has been part of the negotiations. So it is essentially an<br />
economic argument that is appropriate in my judgement for<br />
the rejection at this stage of a consumption tax.<br />
JOURNALIST: You said earlier that it was no time to be<br />
contemplating increases in outlays. Is the Government<br />
considering any major cuts in Government spending in the<br />
August Budget?<br />
PM: The processes of preparation of the Budget, as I said,<br />
will be starting in the Expenditure Review Committee<br />
shortly. I can say that there will be some areas in which<br />
there will be savings. There will be some areas but I'm not<br />
going to go beyond that.<br />
JOURNALIST: Why is the Government continuing to have any<br />
work at all done on a luxury tax or mortgage relief when the<br />
Treasurer has said that such measures are mere embroidery on<br />
the fabric of policy?<br />
PM: I've had the opportunity of reading everything that the<br />
Treasurer has said since I've been away, including that<br />
phrase. I've also read where he's said that it's<br />
appropriate that work be done in a number of areas,<br />
including the ones that you're talking about. The fact, as<br />
I say, that you do work in certain areas carries no<br />
guarantee at all that action will be implemented in that<br />
area. But it's simply responsible to see what are the range </p>
<p>-6-<br />
PM ( cont): of implications of undertaking a particular<br />
course of action which is in the economic arena. It doesn't<br />
mean that every suggestion that's made that you do work on<br />
because some of them plainly don't warrant any work at all.<br />
Some are of sufficient prima facie relevance to do that<br />
work. As I say, I've read everything that Paul has said<br />
about this. As I said when I was overseas, I am at one with<br />
him in all that he's said in this area.<br />
JOURNALIST: What assessment has the Government made of the<br />
impact of the tax cuts on the level of demand in the<br />
economy? PM: We believe that the first thing about that is that if<br />
you hadn't had the tax cuts then you would've had an<br />
increase in wages which would've been economically<br />
unsustainable. Obviously there is an increase in demand<br />
associated with tax cuts but the question, with respect, is<br />
simplistic if you think that's the beginning and the end of<br />
the question. What you've got to ask yourself is what<br />
would've happened in the economy generally if you hadn't had<br />
those tax cuts? Would you have had a containable wages<br />
outcome? Now the answer is of course you wouldn't have.<br />
You would've had a very significantly greater increase in<br />
wages which would've had two things associated with it. At<br />
least the same level of increase in demand but importantly<br />
you would've had a greater cost impact associated with that<br />
level of demand. The beauty of what's been done by the work<br />
that we did in the early part of this year in getting the<br />
tax and wage trade-off is that you get for a given level of<br />
tax reduction with whatever level of demand increases<br />
associated with that, you get it at a much lower cost to<br />
employers than you would if you went the other way. So I<br />
just put to you it's a very simplistic question if you say<br />
what level of demand is going to be associated with the tax<br />
cuts. You've got to say what level of demand and what level<br />
of cost would've been associated with leaving a situation<br />
where you would've had a wages free for all. In economics<br />
you can never, or very rarely, be certain of anything. The<br />
one thing that you can be absolutely certain of as a result<br />
of what we have done is that any given level of demand will<br />
be associated with a significantly lower level of costs for<br />
employers in this country. I go back to what I said in<br />
answer to Michelle Grattan's question, that this is what<br />
distinguishes the Government and fundamentally distinguishes<br />
it from the Opposition. The Opposition made an absolute<br />
mess of the economy in an historically unprecedented way in<br />
its previous term in office because it didn't have that<br />
third arm of policy. It didn't have a wages policy. So the<br />
only way you could control demand was by absolutely running<br />
the economy down and giving yourself the historically<br />
unprecedented experience of double digit inflation and<br />
double digit employment. If you're going to have a proper<br />
control of the economy, including control of demand and<br />
costs, you've got to have a wages policy. That's what we've<br />
got and what the Opposition can never have. </p>
<p>-7-<br />
JOURNALIST: Your earlier answer on the outlays question<br />
suggests that if there should be any sort of relief package<br />
would have to be revenue neutral and funded either by<br />
cuts in outlays or increasing revenue. Is that correct?<br />
of general fiscal policy it would have to be revenue<br />
neutral? PM: It's a good attempt to try and get-me to give you a<br />
detailed outline of the decisions that are going to be<br />
taken. I'm not going to do that. But I think I can go as<br />
far as to say this. That quite clearly if you look at the<br />
fundamentals of Government economic policy over the last few<br />
years they have been associated with three successive years<br />
of real reductions in Commonwealth outlays which have<br />
enabled you to achieve this massive turnaround in the demand<br />
that we make upon the community savings. A turnaround of<br />
seven percentage points in the public sector borrowing<br />
requirement. Turned the significant deficit into a very<br />
significant surplus. That's all been associated with, as I<br />
say, in the last three successive years of real reductions<br />
in Government outlays. We're not going to be turning that<br />
policy around at this stage. So without going any further<br />
in answer to your question I can tell you that that context<br />
of whatever increases in outlays there may be having to be<br />
accommodated to our overall aim of reduction in real outlays<br />
will continue.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister there will be an increase in<br />
real outlays in the environment won't there? Is that one of<br />
the areas you will have to accommodate?<br />
PM: Well we have already talked about that, but that's part<br />
of a very very large total. What we have done in six years<br />
of government, Laurie, is where we've brought down this<br />
massive deficit that we inherited and moved to a very<br />
substantial surplus, it hasn't meant that every area of<br />
activity has been cut. The secret of the success of this<br />
Government in creating massive increases in employment, in<br />
having a situation where, I would remind you, as it was<br />
pointed out in the appendix to the last May Statement, a<br />
situation where the proportion of Commonwealth outlays going<br />
on social justice programs has increased from 50 to 55 per<br />
cent. Where you've have an $ 8.8 billion increase in 1988/ 89<br />
in welfare programs. All that has been accommodated in a<br />
situation of real reductions in outlays. So what that has<br />
meant is that you've had to make the decisions about<br />
reorganising your priorities. Now obviously, Laurie, one of<br />
the great priorities facing this Government and any<br />
responsible government around the world today is in the area<br />
of the environment. So yes there will be significant<br />
increases in outlays.<br />
JOURNALIST: What I mean is, I wonder how you rate the<br />
environment as an issue compared to the economy? </p>
<p>-8-<br />
PM: It is not a question of it being an alternative. Your<br />
question seems to pose it as an alternative. You don't say<br />
do we have economic growth or do we do something about the<br />
environment. You do both, we will be able to accommodate<br />
significant outlays in the area of the environment. We will<br />
be able to accommodate those within the general program that<br />
I referred to which will involve a continuation of overall<br />
real reductions in Commonwealth outlays-.<br />
JOURNALIST: Your response so far to the reaction to date by<br />
ASEAN on your proposal for a Pacific trading group?<br />
PM: I am very pleased with the way its going. What you<br />
have to appreciate is that the meetings that are taking<br />
place in Brunei are now in two stages. What they've done,<br />
the meeting of the ASEAN Ministers, they've noted the Hawke<br />
initiative, if I can put it that way. When they've finished<br />
their meeting they then have the post-ASEAN Ministerial<br />
Council Meeting. Gareth Evans will be getting there today,<br />
as will be the foreign ministers or their equivalents, for<br />
two or three days of meeting with them. And now it is in<br />
those meetings that there will be more detailed discussion<br />
about my proposal. on all the indications that we have had<br />
so far, not only from the ASEAN members but also from Japan,<br />
Korea, New Zealand, the United States and Canada, I am very<br />
optimistic that we will see that idea progressed and<br />
processed. JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, Premier Cain has proposed at the last<br />
Premiers' Conference that the Commonwealth repay some of the<br />
State debts and the Government promised a response to that.<br />
What is your response to that?<br />
PM: It won't be given at a press conference.<br />
JOURNALIST: When will you be responding to that?<br />
PM: I will have to talk with Paul and Peter Walsh about<br />
that. We'll be having a talk about that in the near future.<br />
They'll get a response in the relatively near future.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, on the environment again. Given the<br />
seriousness with which you take the environmental issues and<br />
particularly the Greenhouse Effect, could there be a case<br />
for mounting Senator Richardson's referendum proposal at the<br />
next election?<br />
PM: Well I suppose you could say there would be a case.<br />
But I am not saying that because there's a case that that's<br />
what will be done. There may be a greater case for not<br />
doing it. This is an issue that I would just want to talk<br />
through not only with Senator Richardson but others. It<br />
really hasn't got to the stage yet of us considering it as a<br />
matter of Government policy. It's obviously worth<br />
considering. I haven't anything more to add to that. </p>
<p>-9-<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, do you favour Bernie Fraser becoming<br />
the next Governor of the Reserve Bank?<br />
PM: I think you may appreciate that the question of the<br />
appointment of the next Governor of the Reserve Bank will be<br />
on the Cabinet Agenda, the meeting to which I am going very<br />
shortly. I don't intend to pre-empt consideration of that<br />
matter by my Cabinet colleagues through making any comment<br />
at this stage. I would simply say that-I find rather<br />
ludicrous the observations, the gratuitous observations,<br />
that have been made in regard to this matter by people in<br />
the Opposition.<br />
JOURNALIST: Will we get an announcement on that appointment<br />
today, Mr Hawke?<br />
PM: I would think so.<br />
JOURNALIST: Is it a field of one Mr Hawke?<br />
PM: I can't talk about Cabinet secrets like that Laurie.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, before you went away you said you<br />
were following events in Papua New Guinea on a day-to-day<br />
basis. There have been some more developments while you<br />
have been away. what are your feelings about that and will<br />
you be discussing the situation of Papua New Guinea with<br />
Rabbie Namaliu at the Forum in Kiribati?<br />
PM: I can assure you that while I have been away I have<br />
continued a day by day following of it. I have had the<br />
cables and read them and discussed the issues with those<br />
travelling with me. I think one must say that you can't be<br />
but disturbed by developments there, developments not only<br />
on Bougainville but with the murder of the minister in the<br />
highlands. There is a degree of instability there which<br />
must cause very considerable concern. When you remember<br />
that the Bougainville copper mine provides the best part of<br />
per cent of the revenue of the Papua New Guinea<br />
Government, that's been closed for some time now and its<br />
opening is uncertain. You have not merely the concerns of<br />
law and order associated with what is going on in<br />
Bougainville but you have the economic implications of it as<br />
well. So yes I will be discussing these matters with my<br />
friend Rabbie Namaliu. He will be travelling with me to the<br />
Forum and I will have considerable opportunity to discuss<br />
these matters with him. I'll do that because we as a nation<br />
have a very real concern with what happens there. I can<br />
assure you that we will do everything sensibly that we can<br />
to try and ensure that the nation of Papua New Guinea has<br />
the best possible opportunity of developing, free of what<br />
are assuming rather worrying proportions now in terms of<br />
questions about its stability. That's going to require<br />
understanding on our part and on the part of the people of<br />
Australia. As far as I am concerned that understanding will<br />
be forthcoming. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, how do we know how to interpret<br />
the growth in demand that will take place in the next month?<br />
Can you tell us what the projection from Treasury is?<br />
PM: That was a bit too convoluted for me. would you put it<br />
again? Now that we know what?<br />
JOUNALIST: Now that we know how to interpret the growth in<br />
demand that will take place from this month, could you tell<br />
us what the projection is?<br />
PM: I am not going to refer to any details that I have from<br />
Treasury on this matter.<br />
JOURNALIST: Were you pleased or disappointed by overseas<br />
reactions to your idea of a wilderness park Antarctic?<br />
PM: Well generally speaking I was pleased because I knew as<br />
distinct from some of those travelling with me what the<br />
situation was in the United States. I had cause to say<br />
that we got this great story about the rebuff to Mr Hawke<br />
from President Bush. It may come as some surprise to you to<br />
know or not. But we knew what the position of the United<br />
States was, and we knew what the position of the United<br />
Kingdom was. So nothing new there. We weren't certain<br />
about the degree of support that we would get from France.<br />
we got magnificent support following discussions that I had<br />
with the Prime Minister, and I am putting it in the<br />
chronological order that I spoke with them, the Prime<br />
Minister, the Foreign Minister and the President. We got<br />
full support for our position. That was tremendous. And<br />
then in Germany I got the undertaking from Chancellor Kohl<br />
that they would examine, without commitment, that they would<br />
examine our position. I left with him a fully detailed<br />
document on that position. And in Hungary I also got the<br />
same commitment there that they would they were very<br />
favourably impressed by our proposal and undertook to<br />
examine it and let us know what their position would be.<br />
So, if you take the position that we knew the United Kingdom<br />
position and the United States position, there's no change<br />
there, and we got the fully positive reaction from France<br />
and indications in Germany and Hungary that they would<br />
examine our position closely, I think that was a very good<br />
outcome. I think we can say that with the support that we<br />
have from India and France, the indications that we have of<br />
favourable attitude in Stockholm, Brussels and Rome and what<br />
I think will be inevitably the fact, and that is that the<br />
public opinion on this issue will substantially increase in<br />
favour of the proposal. I have a degree of optimism beyond<br />
what people might have had a couple of months ago.<br />
JOURNALIST: How detrimental is it that the US and the UK<br />
in what you know is their position on this? </p>
<p>-11-<br />
PM: It's not a question of detriment. We said when we made<br />
the decision we realised that we'd have a long and pretty<br />
gruelling fight to persuade people to our position. I think<br />
that the advance that we have made in what is now less than<br />
three months since we have made the decision is really far<br />
beyond what people might have expected at that time. All I<br />
can say is that I hope that the pressure of informed public<br />
opinion around the world, including in-the United Kingdom<br />
and the United States, is going to lead a clear majority of<br />
the nations concerned to embrace the Australian position. I<br />
am hopeful that that is what will happen.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime minister, in the unlikely event that the<br />
world doesn't embrace that position, will you still leave<br />
open the possibility of signing the Minerals Convention?<br />
PM: No I am not looking at that because I think that if we<br />
were to say well yes that's something that we could look at<br />
I think people would question whether we were serious. And<br />
we are serious, we are totally serious. I mean it doesn't<br />
seem to us to make sense if you believe in the fragility of<br />
the Antarctic and its importance to be retained as a<br />
pristine continent, if you believe that, it doesn't to us<br />
make any sense that you talk about protecting it via a<br />
Minerals Convention. I am really, as I say, optimistic that<br />
we are going to be able to get the degree of support which<br />
would persuade people to change their position. I think<br />
there is starting to emerge an understanding that the<br />
context within which that work started, you can say the end<br />
of the 70s and the beginning of the 80s when the idea of the<br />
Minerals Convention was starting, people are understanding<br />
that the context at the end of the 1980s is a quite<br />
different one. There is simply a much greater understanding<br />
around the world now of the importance of these issues and<br />
the fragility of that sort of environment. So I think that<br />
we are not going to be faced with the position of people<br />
saying we have invested all that work in the Minerals<br />
Convention, wouldn't it be a shame if we didn't culminate<br />
that work. I think people are starting to understand that<br />
the environment is different.<br />
JOURNALIST: Did the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade<br />
nevertheless advise you that you need that option open and<br />
did you ignore that advice? Is it true to interpret then<br />
that you have ignored that advice?<br />
PM: Well you're using a reasonable amount of imagination<br />
there but I don't think I'd disclose any state secrets to<br />
say this. That there are a lot of people in Foreign<br />
Affairs, not only in our Department of Foreign Affairs but<br />
in their counterparts around the world, who have invested a<br />
hell of a lot of time and effort over the years in trying to<br />
work up to this Convention. It is therefore understandable<br />
that they have a degree of interest and commitment to it and<br />
some of them may want to keep it much more on the table now<br />
than I would think is appropriate. </p>
<p>-12-<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, do you still believe that<br />
living standards can be maintained this year and gradually<br />
raised over the course of the<br />
PM: On this question of living standards let's get some<br />
basic facts established. In the period since 1982-83 up to<br />
and including 1988-89, the financial year just finished,<br />
real household disposable income per capita has increased by<br />
over 10 per cent. Of course that's ref-lected, as you know,<br />
the very significant growth in employment and also the very<br />
significant decisions in terms of increased welfare<br />
payments. And in this last year that has just finished,<br />
what I said would happen, that is that there would be an<br />
increase in standards, has in fact happened. You've had a<br />
fairly significant increase in real household disposable<br />
income in 1988-89 because of a number of factors. You've<br />
had employment growth, significant employment growth, you've<br />
had significant increases in profits, they are up, rural<br />
incomes were up. You've also had the situation where<br />
average weekly earnings were up around, the increase in<br />
average weekly earnings were up around the inflation rate.<br />
So in 88-89 there has been, in general terms, a significant<br />
increase in real household disposable income. Having said<br />
that, let me make it quite clear that I recognise that for<br />
some people who have had significant increases in their<br />
mortgage repayments that that generally valid observation<br />
wouldn't apply for them. So there are some people, of<br />
course, who have been obviously adversely affected. Now<br />
that's the position from 82-83 up until the present and<br />
particularly the delivery on what we said in 88-89 that<br />
there would be an improvement in standards. Now as far as<br />
what extent there can be of future increases in real<br />
standards of income per capita it will depend obviously upon<br />
the success that we have in bringing back the level of<br />
demand from the unsustainable levels that it is now. That<br />
will be a reflection of how long we have to keep tight<br />
monetary, fiscal and wages policies. So I hope, as I said<br />
earlier in this interview, that we will be successful<br />
relatively soon in bringing back that level of demand. But<br />
as to the likelihood of increased real disposable incomes<br />
per capita in this year that we have now entered, 1989-90,<br />
we have to keep in mind that the effect of the tax cuts, we<br />
have to keep in mind the reasonably significant wage<br />
increases that will be associated with the award<br />
restructuring processes and also keep in mind the record<br />
that we have in making sure that we look after those in the<br />
community who most need assistance. So if you take those<br />
things into account, as I say in the last year there has<br />
been an increase in standards. The extent to which that can<br />
be furthered in 1989-90, the year that we're in now, will<br />
depend upon precisely how those factors operate. What I<br />
want to see as compared to the position of the opposition<br />
who seem to have learnt nothing from the disastrous way they<br />
conducted economic policy when they were in, we want to see<br />
that we will keep the arms of policy tight enough long<br />
enough to get the level of demand down to sustainable levels<br />
but in a way which will enable us to do what we've done<br />
through our whole period of office. That is to keep<br />
employment growth going </p>
<p>-13-<br />
PM ( cont): within reasonable levels of inflation. If we<br />
can do those things as we think we can then while we think<br />
there will have to be restraint and not the improvements in<br />
standards that otherwise would've been possible,<br />
nevertheless we hope that as a result of the combination of<br />
all the factors that I've referred to, that we'll be at<br />
least able to maintain this increase in standards which has<br />
signficantly occurred in the last year.<br />
ends </p>
