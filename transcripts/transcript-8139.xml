PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF DOORSTOP, MENTEC, YOKOHAMA -19 SEPTEMBER 1990<br />
E &amp; 0E PROOF ONLY<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke on the Olympics, do you see a time<br />
approaching where smaller countries are going to be unable<br />
to hold them at all?<br />
PM: Well as I've indicated last night, I think there must<br />
be some concern about the increased difficulty of the<br />
smaller countries having the opportunity. I want to<br />
emphasise that my observations are not in any sense made in<br />
sour grapes. I congratulate Atlanta in their success and I<br />
do wish them well in holding the Centenary Games in 1996.<br />
That will mark a centenary of the Games in which they've<br />
only been held once in the Southern Hemisphere. Now with<br />
the current frequency with which they are being returned to<br />
North America it must be a matter of some concern as to<br />
whether countries like, for instance, Australia with a<br />
proven capacity to discharge the obligations of holding the<br />
Games, whether they are really going to be able to have the<br />
opportunity of delivering. I mean I make those statements<br />
in the light of what so many members of the Olympic movement<br />
have said to us in the last 48 hours before and after our<br />
presentation. They went out of their way quite gratuitously<br />
to say our case was good and our presentation was the best.<br />
* Yet in those circumstances you still can't win.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke do you think that the African<br />
countries moved on block towards Atlanta in one of those<br />
middle votes and if so why do you think they did that? Was<br />
it just because Atlanta has a big black population?<br />
PM: I can't answer why that's so. I would have thought,<br />
and I hope everyone will understand the sense in which I say<br />
it, but I would have thought that the record and standing of<br />
Australia on issues of fundamental importance to our friends<br />
in Africa would have been such that we would have attracted<br />
a larger measure of their support than we obviously did.<br />
Again that's not said with sour grapes. They must cast<br />
their vote the way they would. I think there were lots of<br />
inducements and considerations that applied in their<br />
thinking. At any rate the end result is that we didn't get<br />
enough votes. We didn't win. </p>

JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke can you elaborate on what you meant<br />
this morning when you talked about restructuring the United<br />
Nations to accommodate Japan?<br />
PM: My words were that I believe that there needed to be an<br />
understanding in the world today that no effective world<br />
order could be contemplated which did not recognise the<br />
great significance of Japan. That it has and will have into<br />
the future a political significance which will increasingly<br />
come to match its status as an economic giant. Now I was<br />
deliberately not specific about that because there is a<br />
number of ways in which that could be done ranging, for<br />
instance, and I say this without prescription, but it could<br />
go from at one level the amending of the United Nations<br />
charter to make Japan an additional permanent member with<br />
full veto rights. You could have that at one extreme. You<br />
could have other changes which did not involve an amendment<br />
of the charter. I want to emphasise that these are matters<br />
for the world community of nations within the United<br />
Nations. They must address these issues. Nor does it mean<br />
that possible amendment or changes in attitude would apply<br />
only to Japan. If there is one thing that's true and<br />
obvious in this world in which we live it is that it's not<br />
static and the assumptions and the positions and dimensions<br />
of 1945 are not the assumptions and the attitudes and the<br />
dimensions of 1990 and the final decade of this<br />
Century. Good common sense I think will mean that the<br />
nations of the world must analyse these facts, look at these<br />
situations and attempt to come up with answers which reflect<br />
the realities. Now I repeat, I'm not seeking to impose some<br />
prescription. I am simply nominating obvious facts and<br />
reflecting also I think that it is inevitable that the world<br />
through the United Nations will come to consider these<br />
matters.<br />
JOURNALIST: I believe this morning you had some<br />
conversations or some questions on the Multifunction Polis.<br />
Can you tell us how much interest you've had from the<br />
Japanese on the Polis and do you think it's going to be a<br />
success?<br />
PM: Yes I am very pleased to see that the Japanese through<br />
their Minister, Mr Mutoh, with whom I was talking today<br />
seemed to retain a very real interest. And indeed they have<br />
agreed that they will nominate a joint co-chairman for the<br />
International Advisory Board. I won't go to the name of<br />
that gentlemen at the moment but let me say it's a name of<br />
very, very considerable significance. That is evidence of<br />
their preparedness to go through now into the next stages.<br />
I believe that they may be prepared to look at the<br />
possibility of an investment mission early next year, so<br />
that that could be fitted in with the next stage of<br />
feasibility studies that are being undertaken in Australia.<br />
So there seems to be no doubt of a continuation of their<br />
real interest.<br />
ends </p>
<p>J I 3<br />
it's inevitable that there will be some adjustments. I<br />
haven't attempted in any way to prescribe what those<br />
adjustments should be. But I know that just as sure as<br />
we are of any fact in life is that will happen and it's<br />
appropriate that it be done in a way which the members of<br />
the United Nations are happy with and in a way which<br />
involves a considerable amount of discussion. But it<br />
will happen, ok.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, just on the Raiders.<br />
PM: Last one, yes. You look as though you were there<br />
right from when I left.<br />
JOURNALIST: Who's going to win tomorrow in Sydney?<br />
PM: The Raiders.<br />
JOURNALIST: The Raiders?<br />
PM: On Sunday. I mean they haven't changed it, have<br />
they? JOURNALIST: By how many points?<br />
PM: Well I've got to about 6, about 6.<br />
JOURNALIST: Don't you think it would be nice to see the<br />
Panther's win for the first time though?<br />
PM: Well I understand yes, it would be nice for them.<br />
It would bee good for the region and it's a great region<br />
that they're representing. But you know, I'm a fairly<br />
strong supporter of the Raiders and all my friends in<br />
Penrith will understand that. I just hope that it's a<br />
good, tough game and I'm sure it will be. Thanks.<br />
