PRIME MINISTER 54/ 93<br />
STATEMENT BY TIHE P1RIME MIINIST'' ER, TIlE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
REPUBLIC ADVISORY CO-MMITTEE<br />
I was very disappointed today to learn of Dr I fewson's decision not to nominate a<br />
member of the republic advisory committee.<br />
I believe it dcmonstrates a lack of undlerstanding on Dr Hewson's part of the weight of<br />
the issue and the approach of the Government.<br />
However, I note Dr Hewson's obvious dissatisfaction with the Liberal Party's outdated<br />
platform, and I hope he succeeds in bringing it more into line with community attitudes<br />
at the party's federal council meeting in August.<br />
The work of the republic advisory committee must proceed, notwithstanding the<br />
absence of a nominee from Dr Hewson, but the door remains open should Dr Hewson<br />
change his mind.<br />

REPUBUC ADVISORY COMMITTEE<br />
TERMS OF REFERENCE<br />
The current purpose Is to obtain an options paper which describes the minimum constitutonal<br />
changes necessary to achieve a viable Federal Republic of Australia, maintaining the effect of<br />
our current conventions and principles of government. There is no intention that the Committee<br />
should examine any options which would otherwise change our structure of government,<br />
Including the relationship between the Commonwealth and the States. Even with this limited<br />
purpose, however, It will be necessary to examine a variety of practical possibilities and consut<br />
widely with the community.<br />
The Committee should describe and analyse the possibilities and the main arguments for and<br />
against them, but should not make recommendations as such. The Committee's final report<br />
should be available to the Prime Minister by 1 September 1993.<br />
In light of the above, the report should address the following matters:<br />
1. The removal of all references to the monarch in the Constitution.<br />
2. In light of this, the need for and creation of a new office of Head of State and<br />
consideration of what the office might be called.<br />
3. The provisions for the appointment and termination of appointment of the Head of State<br />
including the method of selection and appointment eg<br />
selection and appointment by the government of the day<br />
selection by the government and endorsement by both Houses of Parliament<br />
appointment by an " electoral college' comprising representatives of various<br />
parliaments appointment following election by the Federal Parliament<br />
popular election<br />
4. How the powers of the new Head of State and their exercise can be made subject to the<br />
same conventions and principles which apply to the powers of the Governor-General.<br />
The nature of the amendments to the Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act<br />
required to Implement the options.<br />
6. The implications for the States.<br />
7. Other aspects which arise in the Committee's deliberations and consultations providing<br />
they are relevant to the overall objective in the opening paragraph above.<br />
