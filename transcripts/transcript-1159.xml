OPENING OF THE A. N. Z. BANK BUILDING,<br />
PITT AND HUNTER STREETS, SYDNEY 24TH SEPTEMBER, 1965<br />
Speech by the Prime Minister, Sir Robert Menzies<br />
Sir, Mr. Premier and Ladies and Gentlemen<br />
Something tells me I might have to get into the lift<br />
again on the way out, so I will take time by the forelock I<br />
declare this building open. ( Laughter) hAat happens thereafter<br />
can't alter the fact that this building is now, believe it or not,<br />
open. Some of you may know that I am a species of politician<br />
and a politician becomes accustomed to the ups and downs of life.<br />
Each time one gees down, one comes up a legitimate abition which<br />
so far I have been able to achieve; but this afternoon, I thought<br />
" This is the end of the road. ' e've -one down, we'll never come<br />
up again." ( Lauhhter) A sobering reTlection. I am not at all<br />
sure that Darvail didn't arrange it. ( Laughter)<br />
I am glad to hear on highest authority that this is<br />
the greatest city. I knew it must be because though I have<br />
opened three or Tour buildings in Melbourne, I must have opened<br />
a dozen or two here and you are so successful in Sydney, everything<br />
runs so well that even though it is three o'clock in the<br />
afternoon, I always see the same 400 busy businessmen attending<br />
an. opening, with lively ambitions, I hope. However, I say no<br />
more about that. I have risen superior to these parochial<br />
arguments. ( Laughter) The finest city in Australia is Canberra<br />
( Laughter) ( Applause) because these things must be estimated not<br />
quantitatively but qualitatively, and so I repeat: Canberra.<br />
And I will continue to say that until I leave. ( Laughter) And<br />
when I leave, I will go to Melbourne.<br />
Now, I was very interested to hear my friend, Mr.<br />
Darvall say something about the banking structure because I thought<br />
I would like to say a little about that myself. We have had<br />
recently under consideration a proposal that was made by a very<br />
powerful Committee that there should be an enquiry into credit and<br />
the facilities of credit it's a very wide term and can cover<br />
a very wide field. The Government doesn't agree with this and<br />
for reasons which I stated the other night, and which are worth<br />
repeating in substance, though not, I hope in words.<br />
We had for years and years in Australia a great<br />
argument going on about'the Commonwealth Bank, the trading<br />
activities of the Commonwealth Bank and the fact that they were<br />
controlled by the same people as controlled the very important<br />
central banking functions. We were told, and I think with some<br />
reason that t is rather impaired the element of co-operation that<br />
ought to exist between the trading banks and the Reserve Bank or<br />
Central Bank, and we know, don't we most of us can remember it,<br />
that there were great arguments, and very heated arguments.<br />
Every time you start an argument on one of these<br />
matters, it's astonishing how many people come out from behind<br />
the bushes with new theories and old theories. It doesn't matter<br />
how old they are and how discredited thry are, they will be<br />
produced, and so you can devote a year or two to having arguments<br />
going on about a structure which in reality ladies and gentlemen,<br />
has ver the last six years, at least worked extraordinarily well;<br />
because it was in 1959 that we thought to bring this to a head. / 2 </p>
<p>2<br />
We separated the Commonwealth Trading Bank operations from the<br />
Reserve Bank, and put it under a separate corporation. I<br />
venture to sa and what Mr. Darvall has said confirms me in<br />
that belief, Lhat since then, with a growing experience of<br />
mutual understanding and a feeling that the Reserve Bank and<br />
the trading banks are not acting in rivalry but are subserving<br />
a common purpose, in a different way, each time of course<br />
inevitably, this system has, I believe been a very good thing<br />
for banking, and therefore, for the entire business community<br />
in Australia. And that being so, we would not want to see it<br />
disturbed. ie have had a lot of experience even I have<br />
had a lot of experience in political matters and how these<br />
things go on I have seen more passions aroused over the banking<br />
business than enough. At long last we reached a conclusion<br />
and Parliament approved of it, which has, I believe, produced<br />
a proper structure in which the many functions of the Reserve<br />
Bank are understood they are respected, its authority is<br />
respected, and at the same time, the banks themselves have been<br />
able to carry on their business with some feeling of freedom<br />
not always without some grievance; that's inevitable but on<br />
the whole, with a sense of freedom and a sense that they could<br />
go ahead and manage their own affairs within the general pattern<br />
that any Reserve Bank must find itself responsible for.<br />
Therefore, we decided, and I think auite rightly that we would<br />
not disturb this pattern, at a time'when the machine is working<br />
well, in order to have the whole of these issues reopened by an<br />
investigation publicly conducted and therefore exposed to all<br />
the advocacy from all sorts and conditions of people which any<br />
enquiry inevitably attracts.<br />
Therefore I was delighted to have my view<br />
confirmed that the overall bankin-system in Australia is a good<br />
one. It is, of course, susceptitle of improvement, but<br />
improvement in detail, inprovement in application, not the sort<br />
of improvement that people aim at by saying, " Let us drastically<br />
alter the whole scheme". It is for that reason that we have<br />
said that we don't propose to have a public enauiry of that kind,<br />
and I thought it was an opportunity for telling you in the<br />
simplest terms why. Now this Bank is an Anglo-Australian bank. We<br />
are reminded of this by the distinguished presence of Lord<br />
Bridgeman. An Anglo-Australian bank, a bank in which there are<br />
shareholders, directors, various people in London in Great<br />
Britain, and therefore a bank which can be exposed to criticism<br />
by those of us who are narrow-minded enough to think that no good<br />
can ccme out of any place but Australia. Now I believe that an<br />
Anglo-Australian bank managed with skillard vision and intelligence<br />
understandin, an Anglo-Australian bank has a special<br />
opportunity, a special responsibility. Because as never before<br />
in my political lifetime, and perhaps in your business lifetime,<br />
never before have the problems of liquidity and of banking policy<br />
generally become more and more international in their character<br />
and the oroblem that is international reouires no narrow or<br />
parochial view. It reouires a broad view. Just let me elaborate<br />
that a morsel. We talk abut liquidity. Whenever we are discussing<br />
the position of the banks, somebody will ask, ", hat is their<br />
present liquidity ratio? How are things going? Are they short<br />
of licuidity or have they too much?" This is the kind of<br />
discussion that goes on inevitably between a reserve bank and a<br />
trading bank, and all sorts of people of both sides have to do<br />
something about it. But we are witnessing a state of affairs in / 3 </p>
<p>the world today in which a shortage of liquidity in one country is<br />
no longer just the business of that country but can have a chain<br />
reaction all round the world. Let us just take a simple example<br />
Japan. Japan has problems of liquidity. Japan has been a<br />
great attractor and user of imported capital. If it turned out that<br />
the policies of the United States for example, were such that<br />
Japan began to become illiquid, tAat Japan became short of new<br />
funds, we would know about it because Japan happens to be one of<br />
our biggest customers in the world, and people can't buy things<br />
withouf having the money to pay for them. Thereforethe liouidity<br />
problem of Japan affects Ausrlalia, just as the liquidity pr6blem<br />
in Great Britain affects Australia or of the Unite States affects<br />
us. We have seen it. We have seen all these things in a distant<br />
way, and sometimes if we have the opportunity, at cose quarters.<br />
I really believe that, vastly important as it is<br />
for us to try to sulve our own internal financial problems, our own<br />
economic problems, vastly important as it is to have our credit<br />
structure operatin. 7 inside our own country so that business can<br />
proceed with opt imism it is even more important for the trading<br />
world, the six or eigAt great trading nations, of which-we are just<br />
abcut one. They have a problem in common. Nobody can detach tne<br />
problems of Great Britain as she confronts her balance of payments<br />
tasks, nobody can detach those from the balance of payments problem<br />
of the Unite States of American or of any other of the tradIng<br />
nations and more and more we must think about these matters in<br />
international terms. The trading nations of the world, particularly<br />
in the next two or three years, have a tremendous task in front of<br />
them and it's a task in common so to handle those problems of<br />
finance as to free the channels of trade. I am not talking about<br />
tariff levels but to free the channels of trade and to expand the<br />
world's trade, because I am old-fashioned enough to believe that<br />
the greatest guarantee of peace in the world is that nations should<br />
trade peacefully plentifully and profitably with each other.<br />
This is a tremendous foundation for understanding and therefore<br />
for peace. Now, Sir that is all I want to say about it. I am<br />
talking to my betters, I know, as so many of you have technical<br />
knowledge of these problems to which I can't aspire, buft as the Head<br />
of a Government I am well aware of them. I feel some responsibility<br />
for them, and it occurred to me that they might well be referred to<br />
today because here we have people from London, from Australia. A<br />
grea organisation London/ Australia here is something that has all<br />
he elements of an international understanding of what, as I have<br />
emphasised, is in many ways an international problem.<br />
And so I had great pleasure in saying " Yes" when I<br />
was invited to come, apart altogether from the fact that as Mr.<br />
Darvall is not my banker, I have always felt it difficult to say<br />
c" onmoe" atno d hiemv. e n g( Lraeua-; ehrt epr) l easuIrte thtoe rerfeopreea t gawvhea t meI gsraeiadt atp letahes urbee gitnoning<br />
