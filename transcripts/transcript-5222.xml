YOUTH EMPLOYMENT INITIATIVES IN NEW SOUTH WALES<br />
The Commonwealth Government has approved the employment of a<br />
further 2,000 young people in New South Wales State Government<br />
Departments and Instrumentalities, and local government councils<br />
C under the Special Youth Employment Training Programme ( SYETP).<br />
This decision follows a request from the New South Wales Premier<br />
that the Commonwealth continue the co-operative training arrangement<br />
between the two governments which was begun in 1978. Under this<br />
arrangement the Commonwealth Government provides training<br />
assistance for young people under the SYETP scheme, and the<br />
New South Wales Government, and local government councils provide<br />
additional temporary positions for the young people.<br />
There have been three previous intakes of SYETP trainees, and<br />
whencombined with the 2,000 young people to be assisted in the<br />
current financial year, a total of 4,500 young people will have<br />
been trained under this arrangement. The total cost of this<br />
programme in the current financial year will be $ 2.85 million.<br />
The decision -is indicative of the Commonwealth Government's concern<br />
for the unemployment problem and is designed to assist the training<br />
of young-unemployed people so that they will gain skills necessary<br />
for them to become integrated into the work force. In so doing<br />
it will significantly assist the long term employment prospects<br />
of a large number of young people in New South Wales. </p>
