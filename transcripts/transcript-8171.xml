DEPUTY PRESIDENT OF THE AFRICAN NATIONAL CONGRESS<br />
CANBERRA 23 OCTOBER 1990<br />
M4r Maidela<br />
P'arliamentary Colleagues<br />
Ladies and Gentlemen<br />
We welcome you here today not simply as a distinguished<br />
visitor to our country, but as a modern day hero whose<br />
personal struggle and personal achievements have been<br />
admired by so many Australians.<br />
We salute you for your commitment to the struggle against<br />
apartheid; for your suffering in the service of that Cause;<br />
for your moral authority which has not only survived, but<br />
has grown through your ordeals; and for your example of<br />
courage and strength that is showing the way for your<br />
people, and all the people of South Africa, towards the<br />
exciting and perilous transition from apartheid to nonracial<br />
democracy.<br />
In prison you were a potent symbol of the struggle to free<br />
South Africa of apartheid. For twenty seven years you bore<br />
the heavy burden of imprisonment.<br />
Now you bear a heavier burden of responsibility. You have<br />
become not only the symbol, but also the leader of your<br />
great cause.<br />
Your task is to lay the foundation of a South Africa which,<br />
on the ashas of apartheid, will build a democratic, just,<br />
stable, prosperous and non-racial society.<br />
No one bel ' Leves that will be easy. But no one here can<br />
doubt your fitness for the task. For what is truly<br />
inspirational is not that you bravely faced imprisonment for<br />
twenty-seven long years, but that you have now put behind<br />
you those bitter years, to sit down at the negotiating table<br />
with your former gaolers, and to plan with them the future<br />
of a democr~ atic and non-racial South Africa. </p>
<p>t. z~ -qC~. rfl~~~ t-C<br />
So we welcome you to Australia, Mr Mandela, both with<br />
respect for what you have suffered and achieved in the past,<br />
and with hope for the work you have ahead of you in your<br />
great struggle.<br />
The iniquity of a system which determines political, social<br />
isndeeplynoffensiva cringc uty cleours W a reo' not n<br />
an dehumanrightsiva cing tocohuy leourso f aerr otkn<br />
perfect, but the concept of " a fair go for all" is an<br />
Australian ideal.<br />
The iniquity of institutionalised apartheid, the censorship,<br />
the repression, the denial of economic opportunity that have<br />
character ised South Africa are deeply offensive in a country<br />
like ours where democratic rule, freedom of expression and<br />
freedom of movement are so familiar as to be sometimes taken<br />
for granted.<br />
So ordinary Australians understand your struggle and<br />
sympathise with it. They recognise the fundamental evil of<br />
the system of apartheid, and the moral bankruptcy of<br />
successive South African Governments which have upheld it.<br />
They recognise the absolute justice of your crusade against<br />
that system.<br />
And they also understand that an evil system such as<br />
apartheid cannot prevail against the good will and good<br />
sense of the many determined people demanding its end.<br />
Among those determined people you, Nelson Mandela, occupy a<br />
pre-eminent position.<br />
I am proud, as an Australian and as a leader of a free<br />
country, to count myself and my country among those who have<br />
stood with you in these difficult years.<br />
We have not of course been able to share your sacrifice of<br />
imprisonment. But we have shared your goal of working not<br />
to destroy South Africa but to rebuild it.<br />
For us eks a member of the Commonwealth, as a member of the<br />
Western alliance, and as a nation which prides itself on<br />
setting standards for responsible international conduct, our<br />
duty to be closely involved in the fight against apartheid<br />
was cryatal clear.<br />
AS early as 1983, my Government began a scholarship program<br />
for educating and training disadvantaged black South<br />
Africaniu. Now we have-d-)$ 17 million humanitarian scheme<br />
providing education, training and development assistance for<br />
black South Africans.<br />
It was this Government which, within the framework of<br />
Commonwealth pressure, proposed the Eminent Persons Group<br />
which developed a negotiating concept close to that now<br />
being implemented by the ANC and the South African<br />
Government.<br />
2630~ i </p>
<p>3.<br />
But it was clear to us that tough sanctions ware also<br />
needed. Australia, in concert with the Commonwealth and<br />
with other nat: Lons, took these difficult decisions. We took<br />
them early, we took them resolutely and w&amp; Ipplied them<br />
broadly. Let mfe in this audience enumerate them.<br />
Aviation zervices between Australia and South Africabanned.<br />
Trade: import of agricultural products, oil, uranium,<br />
coal, iron and steel banned. Government procurement<br />
in South Africa banned.<br />
Sporting contacts: all South African teams banned<br />
from Australia. All individuals who represent South<br />
Africa banned from competing in Australia.<br />
In the field of investment: new investment or<br />
reinvestment of profits, and all Government assistance<br />
to investment and trade with South Africa all banned.<br />
Import and export of all military arms and ammunition<br />
banned. Services: Australian consular services in South Africa<br />
withdrawn. Promotion of tourism to South Africa<br />
banned. Government contracts with South African<br />
companies banned.<br />
Finally, financial links: New loans by Australian<br />
financial institutions to South Africa halted.<br />
Australia led the Commonwealth, and through it the<br />
international financial community, to intensify the<br />
pressure on South Africa's financial system a system<br />
that was already struggling to meet its onerous debt<br />
obligations in the face of the enormous economic<br />
inefficiencies of apartheid.<br />
Australia has not simply applied these measures; we have<br />
been among the foremost advocates of them in the<br />
international community, and we have been a leader in their<br />
international acceptance and application. We have taken<br />
this course in the full knowledge that there would be<br />
tangible costs to the Australian economy. We have borne<br />
these costs and the slurs of those who oppose us because<br />
of our overriding belief in the effectiveness of sanctions<br />
as a means of removing the international scourge of<br />
apartheid. It is important in this parliamentary forum that I point out<br />
that Australia's abhorrence of apartheid has not been the<br />
exclusive preserve of this Labor Government. The depth of<br />
Malcolm Fraser's commitment testifies to that. 2t1; 3 I </p>
<p>4.<br />
But equally, it should be understood that since we have been<br />
in Government we have been alone among the major parties in<br />
our commitment to sanctions as a means of translating that<br />
abhorrence into effective action.<br />
And that belief, with some notable exceptions, is of course<br />
almost universally shared by you, Mr Mandela, by the<br />
African National Congress, by the United Nations, and<br />
perhaps most strikingly of all, by the South African<br />
Government itself.<br />
We apply sanctions in the full knowledge that they have<br />
adverse effects within South Africa. But we do so not out<br />
of spite or malice but as part of a carefully designed range<br />
of measures to influence the South African Government<br />
towards recognition that its own self-interest lies in the<br />
reform of apartheid.<br />
In short, our sanctions are imposed, as we have reiterated,<br />
not to bring South Africa to its knees, but to bring it to<br />
its senses.<br />
we recognise too, the unnecessary pain sanctions will<br />
inflict if applied for too long. Sanctions must be lifted<br />
not a moment too soon and not a moment too late. Following<br />
my discussions with you today, I am pleased that I will have<br />
the benefit of your wisdom and foresight as well as that<br />
of Commonwealth and other international leaders in making<br />
our decision about the right time to lift sanctions.<br />
We have seen moves by the South African Government which<br />
provide real hope. Substantive changes are being made. In<br />
the past year, events have moved significantly and at times<br />
with remarkable rapidity. As yet the South African<br />
Government is only part way down that road, and it is a long<br />
and difficult journey they have to make. many in South<br />
Africa would lead them off that track.<br />
But sense is dawning in the corridors of power in Pretoria.<br />
With your counsel and persuasion, President de Klerk has put<br />
Southf Africa on the road to reform. We readily acknowledge<br />
and -admire the changes which President de Klerk has brought<br />
about as I have in fact communicated to him.<br />
A year ago, you were still captive, just as the South<br />
African Government was captive of the immorality and<br />
illogicality of apartheid. A year ago, the ANC was banned,<br />
its membership as scattered as the hopes for a non-racial<br />
South Africa. A year ago, the prospect of full negotiations<br />
on a new constituti'i'-was as remote as were the ANC's exiled<br />
members from their South African homes.<br />
Today, much has changed. And if you and the ANC persist in<br />
your cause with President de Klerk and the international<br />
community, if you maintain the pressure and exercise courage<br />
and wisdom, the next year or two will see a new constitution<br />
in South Africa. This is an exciting prospect, but a<br />
daunting one too. </p>
<p>Great expectations have been raised among your people that<br />
the new South Africa will deliver immediate prosperity and<br />
happiness. There are dreams to be fulfll1led but like all<br />
dreams, they are difficult to realise..<br />
It is salutary to be reminded that the euphoria of winning<br />
power is of ten quickly followed by the realisation that the<br />
realities of' government can be harsh. You will need to show<br />
leadership In counselling your people about what they may<br />
expect in the new South Africa.<br />
Your coming South Africa will, happily, have a democratic<br />
and non-racial constitution. Hut it will carry with it the<br />
bitter legacy of the enmities which are a feature of the<br />
apartheid system.<br />
The recent violence in the townships is frightening and it<br />
is tragic. More than that, it is evidence of the continuing<br />
conflicts which will need to be addressed if South Africa is<br />
to have a peaceful future.<br />
Your coming South Africa will have great wealth. Like our<br />
country, South Africa is blessed with mineral and<br />
agricultural. riches. But its mew leadership will need to<br />
take difficult decisions. Your now long-held commitment to<br />
a fairer disitribution of the country's wealth and<br />
opportunities remains valid.<br />
But concepts that were formulated in the days when the<br />
command economies presented some attractions for those<br />
oppressed by an apparently uncaring capitalism require<br />
revisiting, as those very command economies are being<br />
jettisoned as incapable of meeting the needs of a free<br />
people. Your new leadership will need to balance the need<br />
for more equitable distribution with the imperative of<br />
maintaining a market system that fosters economic growth.<br />
Your new South Africa will be influential. With freedom<br />
will come international respect and influence. South<br />
Africa's economic strength, strategic importance and history<br />
will ensure it takes a prominent place in the councils of<br />
Africa. With this influence, however, will come heavy<br />
responsibil: Lties. Africa's diversity, its many conflicts,<br />
its poverty starvation in a continent which has the<br />
intrinsic capacity to be a net exporter of food all this<br />
brings greatc challenges for those who assume its leadership<br />
over coming decades.<br />
A new South Africa, freed from the shackles of its racist<br />
past, will also begin afresh harmonious and profitable<br />
relations w. Lth other nations, including Australia. There<br />
will be opportunities for South Africa and Australia to work<br />
together for a better and more harmonious international<br />
community. </p>
<p>Mr, Mandela<br />
The precepts which you set down three decades ago for a new<br />
South Africa would be worthy aims for this international<br />
community. Let me close by using some of your words, as<br />
relevant now as they were when you spoke them at your trial<br />
in 1964: " I have fought against black domination and I have<br />
fought against white domination. I have cherished the<br />
ideal of a democratic and free society in which all<br />
persons live together in harmony and with equal<br />
opportunities It is an ideal which I hope to live<br />
for, and to achieve."<br />
Mr Mandela, you went on to say that it was an ideal for<br />
which you were prepared to die.<br />
It is to the lasting relief and joy of all Australiansindeed,<br />
of humanity itself that you did not have to pay<br />
that price. If those of us who help to shape the world in<br />
the coming decade can apply your standards of courage and<br />
wisdom, and your capacity for reconciliation, this will be<br />
an ideal for which no-one else will need to die.<br />
Nelson Mandela, we welcome you and honour you for the<br />
magnitude of your sacrifice over twenty-seven years; for the<br />
far-sighted leadership you have exercised since your<br />
release; and for the vastness of the task that still lies<br />
ahead of you and your fellow South Africans.<br />
So you are thrice welcome and we are thrice honoured in<br />
welcoming you. Be assured of our pride in having stood with<br />
you in your darkest hours; be equally assured of our<br />
commitment to stand with you as you see the dawn breakingto<br />
work with you now as you move surely towards our common<br />
goal: a democratic, non-racial South Africa.<br />
It will come. May it come soon.<br />
