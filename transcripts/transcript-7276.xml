PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 21 JANUARY 198.8<br />
LAUNC6 OF<br />
" PENGUIN BICENTENNIAL HISTORY OF AUSTRALIA"<br />
SYDNEY 21 JANUARY 1988<br />
mr Kirk, Professor Molony, Manning Clark# Distinguished<br />
Guests, Ladies and Gentlemen:<br />
There could hardly be a more agpropriate indeed symbolicsetting<br />
from which to launch the " Penguin Bicentennial<br />
History of Australia".<br />
Two hundred years ago, the eleven ships of the First Fleet<br />
sailed into this Harbour to-found the first European<br />
settlement in Australia.<br />
in a few days time, we will be reminded of that event when<br />
the ships of the First Fleet Reenactment Voyage enter the.<br />
Harbour and later the Tall Ships sail past in a magnificent<br />
parade of sail.<br />
These activities, of course# represent the more spectacular<br />
side of the Bicentenary celebrations.<br />
But I try to emphasise, at all times, that the celebrations<br />
themselves represent only a part of the purpose and<br />
significance of the Dicentenary.<br />
And one of its most important aspects Is the opportunity the<br />
Bicentenary gives us to learn more about the past.<br />
But, even more important than that the opportunity it gives<br />
us to learn from the past.<br />
The Australian Bicentennial Authority has been very much<br />
aware of its responsibilities in this regard.<br />
The " Penguin Bicentennial History of Australia" complements<br />
three other landmark publications commissioned by the<br />
Australian Bicentennial Authority. They are:<br />
" After 200 Years", a photog raphic inventory of the<br />
diversity of Aboriginal life in the 1980s co-ordinated by<br />
the Australian institute of Aboriginal Studies; 004006<br />
ALL </p>
<p>2. DanBelan<br />
" Generations"# by ProfessorDinBelad<br />
" The Australopedia", a children's encyclopedia edited by<br />
Dr Joan Grant.<br />
But, of course, these commissioned publications form only a<br />
part of the massive work by Australian writers, historians<br />
and publishers in connection with the Bicentenary.<br />
For example, the monumental 10-volume " Australians",<br />
published by Fairfax-Syme-Weldon a work of its kind<br />
unsurpassed in the world.<br />
But today I want to draw your attention to a point of<br />
fundamental importance.<br />
Even before it officially begins, the Bicentenary is<br />
fulfilling a purpose of deep significance for the future.<br />
All the writers and historians who have been involved in<br />
these projects have tried to take a fresh look at the pastfrom<br />
new perspectives, based on new insights and new<br />
knowledge.<br />
And in particular, this approach is leading to an altogether<br />
new assessment of the pre-European era; and, specifically, of<br />
the development of the Aboriginal culture over 40,000 years.<br />
And that reassessment cannot fail to lead to a reassessment<br />
on the part of all Australians, of the role of the Aborigines<br />
and our relationship with them not only in the past, but<br />
now; and above all, in the future.<br />
And I deeply believe that this will prove to be one of the<br />
most valuable and enduring fruits of the Bicentenary.<br />
The reassessment would undoubtedly have come.<br />
It had to come.<br />
But I think it is clear that the Bicentenary has provided the<br />
focus for it indeed the catalyst for it.<br />
Professor Molony'. s work will be part of that process.<br />
As its subtitle suggests " The story of 200 Years" it is<br />
largely a story of European settlement.<br />
Even s o, I note that by far the largest single entry in the<br />
index refers to Aborigines.<br />
I suggest that no p revious general history of modern<br />
Australia contains that emphasis.<br />
Manning Clark himself has acknowledged that his own work is<br />
deficient in this respect and that he would do it<br />
differently, if he were doing it now. 004007 </p>
<p>3.<br />
Ladies and Gentlemen;<br />
i congratulate the Bicentennial Authority for including works<br />
of history and sociology in its program.<br />
1 hasten to point out that the commission was awarded to<br />
Penguin iong before I gave the Publishing Editor-designate<br />
special ministerial responsibility for the Bicentennial.<br />
You will be familiar with the line that " the views of the<br />
speaker are not necessarily those of this station". I must<br />
for the sake of my own integrity say that the views of the<br />
author, not as historian but as current affairs commentator<br />
in the latter pages, are not necessarily those of the<br />
launcher. However, let me leave the author with the last word, with<br />
which i do entirely concur.<br />
He concludes: " Some will say that the history of Australia since 26<br />
January 1788 is no cause for thanksg ivin2. They are<br />
heard and respected, but they are wrong. 004008 </p>
