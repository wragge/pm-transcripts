PRESS OFFICE TRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW WITH VINCE SMITH 2UE<br />
FRIDAY 15 FEBRUARY 1980<br />
Question Prime Minister<br />
Yes. I think it was a constructive and a useful discussion.<br />
We have put out a joint press statement as a result. The people<br />
I was talking with of course, are not empowered to make any<br />
decisions-. I did not expect that they could. But I did want<br />
to be able to speak with Mr. Grange and as many of his people as<br />
he wanted to bring along, as soon as possible, so that I could<br />
explain in detail the background to the Government's view and the<br />
seriousness with which we regard the whole international situation.<br />
And I think that is understood. The press statement that we have<br />
put out a few monents -ago says that the Australian Olympic Federation<br />
explained that they were concerned as to whether a withdrawal by<br />
Australia or a number of nations would constitute an effective<br />
boycott, and the President of the Federation did not feel that<br />
Australia should withdraw unless it was established beyond reasonable<br />
doubt that an effective boycott would take place. They point out<br />
that constitutional processes that they would have to go through<br />
in making the decision and concluded by saying that they will give<br />
very serious consideration to the views that the Government put to<br />
them..<br />
Question Prime Minister<br />
Yes it has. Now there was some doubt about that point in earlier<br />
correspondence I wrote a letter which has also been published,<br />
to Mr. Grange and which was given to him this morning. That letter<br />
in part says that the Government is also strongly of the view that<br />
it would not be in the national interest of Australia for Australians<br />
to participate in Games held in Moscow and therefore asks that in<br />
the event of the Soviet not withdrawing from Afgh-anis-tan, no<br />
Australian team be sent. So that should clear up that point, which<br />
was necessary from ' their interpretation of my earlier letter. I<br />
also made the point as I have before that we are not going to<br />
withhold passports. It is a request and we are not in the business<br />
of acting like the authoritarian, totalitarian kinds of regimes<br />
that we oppose. The Government does not direct<br />
Australian sporting bodies<br />
Therefore there has to be responsibility on other people to take<br />
into account the policy and all the totality of the considerations.<br />
Question Prime minister<br />
Well I saw a survey yesterday. Is there another one produced this<br />
morning? </p>
<p>Question Prime Minister<br />
Well I am not all together surprised at that because in the earlier<br />
periods our television screens were giving pictures of Russian<br />
troops and tanks marching through Afghanistan almost nightly. Now<br />
that has not been on the television screens recently. I don't know<br />
when that poll was taken but the Government has really only been<br />
expressing the view strongly about the reasonsover the last three<br />
of four days. Some people have expressed the view to me<br />
that they are surprised that in the absence of the Government's.<br />
. views were being press publicly,* which had not happened up to a few day ' s ago,<br />
surprised at so many people were in support of a boycott.<br />
Question Prime Minister<br />
Well that would be a view that-could be taken but I do not think<br />
that it advances Australia's cause much to say that it will not<br />
trade in things which everyone else is going to go on trading in.<br />
One of the things I wanted to do when I was overseas was to see<br />
what goods the British and the Americans in particular were not<br />
going to trade with in the Soviet Union, because I wanted Australia<br />
to be in a similar position -not necessarily identical but similar.<br />
I found in terms of the commodities that have had some publicity<br />
here, there is no thought of an embargo really in relation to the<br />
Soviet Union. We have cut off scientific and cultural links.<br />
There are the grains embargoes, which will hurt, the fisheries<br />
embargoes, limitations on Soviet fishing, virtually the end of<br />
access to their scientific vessels to any Australian pors.<br />
Question Prime Minister<br />
I think that the weight of public opinion and the weight of<br />
international opinion, 104 nations in the United Nations, the<br />
Islamic Conference these things have been expressed quite<br />
spontaneously as well as from the developed countries of the West.<br />
If you think back after Czechoslovakia it was not possible to get<br />
a condemnation out of the United Nations of the Soviet Union. So<br />
this does represent a very real change. It is not just an East<br />
West thing. It is countries all around the world expressing a view<br />
and of course why a lot of attention has been given to the Olympic<br />
Games is that it is a very public thing. It is the Soviet Union<br />
itself that has said that the holding of the Games or the awarding<br />
of them to Moscow is a great political event. And they have also<br />
said that the awarding of the Games to Moscow represents a mark of<br />
approval of Soviet foreign policy. Now they have said that to their<br />
own people. It has gone out in their formal papers to their party<br />
activists. It is that kind of . politicisation of the location of<br />
the Games which the Government believes makes it doubly important<br />
for Australians not to attend and not to compete. Because if 3 </p>
<p>Australians, Americans, Englishmen and Germans and all the rest go<br />
it is not going to be what the Olympic Committees or the athletes<br />
themselves say, the important thing then will be what the Soviet<br />
Union news media says to the Russian people. And they will be<br />
saying very plainly all these fine young men and women are<br />
accepting the Socialist faith and philosophy and repudiating their<br />
own society. And I do not believe that giving the Soviets that<br />
degree of internal self confidence will be at all helpful in taking<br />
the world to a more secure and safer international environment<br />
where the integrity and independence of nations is respected.<br />
Question<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Well the relationships with the ASEAN countries are very good on<br />
a personal basis and on a governirent to governnent basis. I know the leaders<br />
of all those countries personally and I know they are just as much<br />
offended arnd just as much appalled by the Soviet action as we are.<br />
The only country with whom we have not really got a good<br />
relationship in Southeast Asia is Vietnam, I suppose, and<br />
the Vietnam regime in Kampuchea.<br />
Question Prime Minister<br />
Well you know we tried. After the Vietnam War I can remember telling<br />
Vietnamese emissaries in Canberra look we are prepared to let the<br />
past be past, we are prepared to provide aid for the rebuilding of<br />
your country.,-we hope very much you can work constructively in<br />
Southeast Asia, with other countries there to build a peaceful<br />
world. And we were providing aid, and substantial civil aid and<br />
what happened? They signed. a defence treaty with the Soviet Union<br />
and now they have got 22 divisions in Kampuchea. So we tried taking<br />
that path.. I have got to say it did not work.<br />
Question Prime Minister<br />
What do you mean if the worst comes to the worst?<br />
Question Prime Minister<br />
Yes. Well I hope they won't. But we are not going to use the<br />
methods of dictators to stop them going. That is not the way a<br />
free society ought to act.<br />
Question </p>
<p>4<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Well I believe it would be a very great tradegy. I really do.<br />
It takes a number of nations but assuming the United States and<br />
significant countries in Europe and Australia ( boycott) then you<br />
have a pretty effective protest. Somebody has got to be first<br />
in the ring with making decisions about that. We are in close<br />
touch on a government to government basis with the United States.<br />
and with United Kingdom. Against that total background I think<br />
we need to keep in mind the objective of the United States, of<br />
Europe and of middle ranking countries like Australia. And that<br />
objective is to make sure that the Soviets do not go further.<br />
The objective is to make sure that we can establish a more peaceful<br />
and a more secure world which does respect the independence of<br />
states and if governments are making the judgmen -that a boycott<br />
of the Olympic Gamnes is a significant ingredient in helping to<br />
establish that objective<br />
Question Prime Minister<br />
No we have not lost. It just makes it harder to establish that<br />
secure world. It means that one of the devices that could have<br />
been used to diminish danger has not been used and it means that<br />
greater efforts are going to have to be put onto other things to<br />
convince the Soviet Union of the total determination of the United<br />
States and many other countries, that further aggression will not<br />
be allowed or tolerated. 000---</p>
