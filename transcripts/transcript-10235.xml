February 1996 TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
THE HON JOHN HOWARD MP<br />
AM PROGRAMME WITH FRAN KELLY<br />
E&amp; OE<br />
KELLY: Prime Minister, good morning.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Good morning.<br />
KELLY:<br />
Prime Minister, yesterday you announced the bare outline of a ' work for the dole'<br />
scheme and in so doing successfully managed to knock the headlines, turn the<br />
headlines away from the messy Bob Woods' affair that dominated last week, can you<br />
tell us now any more about this proposal for the young unemployed?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, can I just say on that question of knocking things off the front pages, I thought<br />
the main challenge of governments was job generation, small business and boosting the<br />
economy. So, I mean, let it not be thought for a moment that a Government scheme to<br />
tackle youth unemployment is a diversion from the main issues. I thought it was the<br />
main issue.<br />
KELLY:<br />
No, I'm just making the point, as you said this morning, that it's there on the headlines. </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, I think the context in which this... . this was no sudden announcement. We've<br />
been looking at this for a number of weeks. We still have more work to do on it. It<br />
will be piloted in about 30 or so rural and regional areas of very high unemployment.<br />
We will try a mixture of voluntary and compulsory schemes. We'll be inviting various<br />
community organisations to put forward proposals for approval by the Government.<br />
Award rates will be payable and that means In effect that people will only have to work<br />
in most cases 15 or 20 hours a week. They will still have time left to look for long<br />
term employment. It is not scab labour. It is not slave labour. It is not chain gang<br />
labour because people are being paid at award rates. It will help, along with a number<br />
of other things, to try and break the cycle of despondency which is my biggest worry<br />
about the 100, 000 young people who can't get work, of which 3 0, 000 are out of work<br />
for more than six months. Can I stress Fran that it's not the only thing that we are<br />
doing. It's one of a number of things we're doing. We've successfully launched the<br />
Green Corps. I understand, for example, that we advertised for something like 230<br />
place and within a week or 10 days we had 1100 responses for those 230 places. And<br />
we still haven't launched the first, formally launched, the first Green Corps project. So<br />
it's one of a number of things I'll be announcing later this month, some more initiatives<br />
to reduce red tape for small business. And we've launched the new and modern<br />
training and apprenticeship scheme. I want the ' work for the dole' scheme to be one<br />
of the total, one element of the total armory of policies that the Government has in<br />
order to tackle the problem of youth unemployment.<br />
KELLY:<br />
Well just a little bit more of the details you've said people will work for award<br />
wages. I think the under 20s dole is around $ 90 a week, I think...<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
That's right.<br />
KELLY: a little bit less if you're 17.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
And there are junior rates though. So when I talk about awards I mean the rate that is<br />
prescribed in the case of people under 21 the relevant junior rate in the award which is<br />
lower, of course, than the adult rate.<br />
KELLY:<br />
And some people it will be compulsory for some. </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Yes, it will.<br />
KELLY: So if it's compulsory, if it doesn't work out for a young person, what happens to their<br />
benefits? PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, there are certain. obviously, when you say, doesn't work out, I mean if a person<br />
refuses to work and persists with that refusal over a long period of time, well that<br />
person could run the risk of losing their dole in the same way that if a person doesn't<br />
satisfy the work test under the existing dole over a long period of time that person<br />
could lose their dole. It will be no more severe or less severe in its application than the<br />
application of the existing work test. So let's say, I understand what you may be<br />
getting at, so let me just say at the outset, obviously if people stubbornly refuse to do<br />
anything in return for the dole then over a period of time they could run the risk of<br />
losing it. But it's not something that would happen immediately, but it would happen<br />
in a measured way in exactly the same way as it happens under the existing<br />
arrangement. I mean, I am quite unashamedly in favour of the principle of there being<br />
a community obligation for a person to work out at award rates the value of his or her<br />
dole. I don't think there's anything wrong in that providing it's based on the concept<br />
of an award rate and in that sense you are not in any way exploiting people. But the<br />
idea that a person can forever say, well, I expect a safety net to be provided and even<br />
though I can do so I refuse to do anything in return for it, I don't think that's unfair, I<br />
don't think it's harsh and I would imagine there'd be reasonable community support<br />
for it. I was very interested in the vox pop you played at the beginning of the<br />
programme. It indicated a fair amount of support for the concept and I'm encouraged<br />
about that.<br />
KELLY: Not all the support not all the comment though is positive. ACOSS has criticised<br />
the scheme as third rate. They say it's been tried and discounted under other names in<br />
the 70s and the 80s. Isn't it true that this kind of scheme does go against all the<br />
thinking in this area, all the research? Your own Department of Employment<br />
commissioned an 18 month study just recently that concluded that compulsory<br />
voluntarism doesn't work. Isn't this reinventing the wheel, if you like, a wheel that's<br />
been discarded?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, that's completely wrong. To my knowledge a ' work for the dole' scheme of the<br />
type 1 have just described has never been tried in Australia before. It certainly wasn't<br />
tried by the Fraser Government and it definitely wasn't tried by the just let me finish<br />
by the Hawke and Keating governments. And as for whether you say it goes against </p>
<p>established advice, well, we still have 8.5% unemployment, we still have 100 000<br />
young people out of work. Maybe some of the established advice is inadequate...<br />
KELLY:<br />
But wasn't the whole criticism of Labor....<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Fran please let me finish. You asked quite a long question. And I think it is very<br />
important to occasionally in these areas challenge the conventional wisdom. I am not<br />
surprised that ACOSS would attack it although I notice that some of the individual<br />
member bodies have been identified in the papers this morning as supporting it. I'm<br />
not surprised that the Labor Party and the unions and the Democrats oppose it, but I<br />
think out in the community people see the fairness of it and people want this<br />
government to try a number of things. They know youth unemployment is a difficult<br />
challenge. They know we were left with a huge problem; they know the Labor Party<br />
had thirteen and a half years and left us with 8.5% unemployment and pushed it to<br />
11% during its period in office, so they understand that we can't fix it overnight, but<br />
what they do expect and require of us is that we try different stratagems and this is one<br />
of those stratagems. It's never been tried before in the way I've outlined it in Australia<br />
and therefore we are not reinventing the wheel, we are in fact trying something<br />
different. KELLY: Well, when you came to power you criticised Labor for their make work programmes.<br />
You said Labor wasn't creating real jobs, you were going to change that, you would<br />
create real jobs. These aren't real jobs we're talking about here are they and more than<br />
that they don't have necessarily real training attached to them.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, Fran, there are other things that we are doing. I mean, if this were the only thing<br />
that we were doing then that criticism would be legitimate, but we are trying to give,<br />
we are giving incentives to small business. I mean, small business still remains the<br />
hope of the side to reduce unemployment. We've cut their interest rates, we've<br />
reduced their capital gains tax, we are reducing their paper burden, we've got rid of<br />
the unfair dismissal law, we've given them new pro-small business industrial relations<br />
laws, we are doing everything we humanly can to improve the climate for small<br />
business. We've introduced a new apprenticeship and training scheme that will more<br />
effectively marry the desires of young people for apprenticeships and the available<br />
apprenticeships in the business sector. We've introduced a Green Corps which the<br />
early signs are is going to be very successful, as well, we are going to pilot and if it<br />
works effectively, introduce on a permanent basis a work for the dole scheme. Now, if<br />
were only doing " work for the dole" and nothing else then what you say would be a<br />
legitimate criticism, but we are doing a number of things. We are constantly attacking<br />
this issue on every front. It's a very important issue, it's going to be very hard to solve<br />
in the short term and the Employment Committee has been working very hard and </p>
<p>there are other issues, there are other policies also in the pipeline, other initiatives of<br />
the Government that I'll be announcing over the coming months in this area, but this is<br />
a very important part of the initiative.<br />
KELLY:<br />
On another issue Prime Minister, your first week back in parliament was dominated by<br />
the troubles of a Parliamentary Secretary, Senator Bob Woods. Should you have<br />
asked Senator Woods to step down from the front bench at least while the police<br />
investigation was going on?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
No. KELLY: Why not?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Because the normal thing is that you don't step down just on the basis of an allegation.<br />
You do if a charge is made and in any event it would have been quite wrong of me to<br />
have drawn the police investigation to Senator Woods' attention.<br />
KELLY: When did Senator Woods first become aware of the investigation?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well you'd have to cross examine him, but he told me that he didn't know anything<br />
about it until his office was raided. That's what he told me, but if in fact that is the<br />
case and I have no reason to doubt that it's the case, but of course it is a matter for<br />
him, then it would have been grossly improper of me, and it would have left me open<br />
to an accusation of interfering with a police inquiry to have alerted him to the<br />
complaint. KELLY:<br />
Did you ask the Federal police or ask for advice whether it would have been<br />
appropriate? PRIME MINISTER:<br />
No. Look, the longstanding procedure with this is that you are advised of it but you<br />
stay out of it. I mean, it is a police matter. I treated Senator Woods in the same way<br />
as any other citizen. He didn't get any preferment. On the other hand, he does not<br />
deserve any pre-emptive judgments to be made. He is entitled like any other citizen to </p>
<p>a presumption of innocence. I behaved absolutely correctly. It may have been<br />
politically easier if I had done other things, but I didn't. I behaved absolutely correctly<br />
and I have no apology at all to make for my handling of it.<br />
KELLY: We now know that another Coalition MiP, Michael Cobb, was being investigated by<br />
the Federal Police last year. Have you been told of any other Coalition Mi~ s being<br />
investigated by the Federal Police for allegations of...<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well you shouldn't get too excited about the answer I'm about to give but the usual<br />
thing is that you don't comment on those matters.<br />
KELLY: You were informed by the Attorney General in September last year that Senator<br />
Woods was under investigation by the Federal Police...<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
That a complaint had been made.<br />
KELLY: Yes. PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, that's an important difference.<br />
KELLY:<br />
That PRIME MINISTER:<br />
That a complaint had been made.<br />
KELLY: All right. I was under the impression that in November last year Senator Woods was<br />
given extra Ministerial responsibilities when he was put in charge of the $ 2 billion<br />
pharmaceutical benefits scheme. Was that wise given that he had had a complaint<br />
made against him in terms of handling of moneys? </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, they weren't extra responsibilities in the sense that they were outside the ambit of<br />
the area in which he was already assisting the Health Minister and you know, you are<br />
either in or out and I would have thought it was perfectly normal that if somebody<br />
continues until good grounds exist for them not to continue, then they ought to do<br />
what a person continuing that job would normally be expected to do.<br />
KELLY: So that didn't trouble you when you were made aware?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
No, no.<br />
KELLY: Have you now initiated any action by your department to make sure that all members<br />
of your Executive Council knowingly or unknowingly everything is in order, all their<br />
books are in order...<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well what do you mean by unknowingly?<br />
KELLY: Well, any of your M~ s may have unknowingly made a mistake that makes...<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well I think I would have, look Fran, I am not going to go into the details of private<br />
discussions I might have with my colleagues about this. Suffice it to say that I expect<br />
people to be careful. I expect them to be scrupulously honest, I expect them to be<br />
completely above board. There is no evidence yet, there is no evidence yet that Bob<br />
Woods wasn't above board with his travel allowance. I mean, the easy way in which<br />
we are already slipping into accepting that somebody is guilty of something, I reject. I<br />
mean, the man, whatever has been said over the last week, the man is entitled to a<br />
presumption of innocence and I demand, I expect that he get that presumption like any<br />
other citizen.<br />
KELLY: Just finally and briefly, there is a suggestion that Cabinet will today reconsider the cuts<br />
to legal aid funding. In your view, is there any scope for any of those funds cut in the<br />
last budget to be reinstated? </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well I don't speculate about what is going to be on the Cabinet agenda but the<br />
principle behind those cuts is a very fair and sustainable one and that is, we pay legal<br />
aid for the operation of Commonwealth law. We expect the states to pay at the state<br />
law. Now that is the basis upon which our decision was taken. I think that is an<br />
absolutely defensible and correct basis and the quite disgraceful way in which many of<br />
the states have tried emotionally to use individual cases involving the operation not of<br />
Commonwealth law but of the operation of state law to put pressure on the Attorney<br />
General and to put pressure on the Government is something that ought to be exposed.<br />
Now I am not going to pre-empt or talk about what is discussed at a Cabinet meeting<br />
but let me defend very strongly the principle that it is fair for the Commonwealth to be<br />
expected to pay for legal aid in relation to the operation of Commonwealth law and it<br />
is fair of us to say to the states, you look after legal aid when it comes to state law, and<br />
if you apply that principle, you will see that the decisions that were announced in the<br />
budget were very fair indeed.<br />
KELLY:<br />
Prime Minister, thank you.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
It's a pleasure.<br />
