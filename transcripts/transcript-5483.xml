FOR MEDIA TUESDAY 18 NOVEMBER 1980<br />
COMMONWEALTH HEADS OF GOVERNMENT MEETING 1981<br />
At the Lusaka Meeting of the Cormmonwealth Heads of Government<br />
in August 1979, Australia's offer to host the 1981 meeting<br />
was accepted.<br />
The 1981 meeting will be the largest Commonwealth Heads of'<br />
Government Meeting so far, with 41 countries now being entitled<br />
to attend, including Zimbabwe and Vanuatu for the first time.<br />
In addition to the Heads of Government it is expected that there<br />
will be many other official delegates including Ministers, and<br />
that there will be a large contingent of media representatives<br />
visiting Australia for the meeting.<br />
Because of the size of the conference facilities required for<br />
a meeting of this magnitude and the large amount of hotel<br />
accommodation needed for all the visitors, the Government decided<br />
that-the meeting would take place in Melbourne using the<br />
Exhibition Building as the venue.<br />
Following consultations by the Commonwealth Secretary Genera.<br />
with member Governments of the Commonwealth as to the dates<br />
of the meeting, it has now been confirmed that the meeting will<br />
take place from Wednesday 30 September 1981 to Wednesday<br />
7 October 1981.<br />
As has already been announced, the Heads of Government will<br />
visit Canberra during the intervening weekend for the traditiLonal<br />
retreat at which they will carry on the work of the meeting in<br />
less formal surroundings away from the conference table. </p>
