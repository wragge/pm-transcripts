    <content><![CDATA[<p>Ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of Margie and I, Margie and I are absolutely honoured to welcome all of you to Kirribilli House, one of the Prime Ministerial residences here. Iâm particularly thrilled to be in the presence of Her Excellency the Governor and Sir Nicholas Shehadie, in the presence of the Premier and Mrs Rosemary OâFarrell, our former Governor-General, Major General Michael Jeffery, so many very distinguished people. You honour Margie and me by being here today, so thank you so much for coming.</p>
<p>This is a very special day. It is the hundredth anniversary of the Royal Australian Navy. It is the centenary of our Navy. So itâs a day when we look back over our history. Itâs a day when we remember all of the things that have helped to make us a nation; but itâs also a day that we look forward and itâs great to have here today, in the presence of His Royal Highness Prince Harry, so many young Australians who have done something with their lives. We have Paralympians, we have other sporting heroes, we have young entrepreneurs. Perhaps most poignantly we have people who have served our country in war and paid a very high price indeed and Margie and I salute you and our nation salutes you and I know that Prince Harry wishes to honour you on this particular occasion.</p>
<p>Iâm not going to make a long speech. I want to conclude with just a couple of remarks. Prince Harry, I regret to say that not every Australian is a monarchist, but today everyone feels like a monarchist.</p>
<p>You grace us as your family has graced our nation from its beginning and itâs quite fitting on a day such as this when we think back over a hundred years of the Australian Navy, that you are here as the Crown is a symbol of stability, continuity, decency, in our public life. So thank you so much for being here.</p>
<p>Finally ladies and gentlemen, weâre all Australians. Our very diverse backgrounds, very different heritage, but we are all Australians and on a day such as today, we should all count our blessings. We have all won the lottery of life by virtue of being Australians and to be here on this day in your presence, your Royal Highness, is particularly special.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
