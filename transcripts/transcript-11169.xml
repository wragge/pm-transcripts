<p> Canyoning Tragedy,</p>
<p>E&amp;OE.............</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, is this an example of the type of facility for recovering</p>
<p> drug addicts that the Government is in favour of?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>It certainly is. There's no one perfect model facility but this, from</p>
<p> what I've seen, is a great facility. It gives the clients, the people</p>
<p> who have a problem, a sense of security and support. I talked to them</p>
<p> for a while, as you saw, and the message that I got that I remember</p>
<p> most of all is that they have a sense of security and safety here</p>
<p> and that's tremendously important. As I freely acknowledge, I'm not</p>
<p> a doctor, I'm not a clinical psychologist. I try and bring a common-sense</p>
<p> understanding. And it seems to me if you provide people with stability</p>
<p> and a sense of safety and security they have a much better chance</p>
<p> of breaking a habit than if they're living in a stressful, constantly</p>
<p> challenged, kind of environment. Now, that seems to me to be common</p>
<p> sense. And it seems that this is precisely that kind of facility.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>This facility allows mothers who are rehabilitating themselves to</p>
<p> bring their children here while they dry out or get better, do you</p>
<p> think that's a bit dangerous to let children.?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I hesitate to criticise it, I really do. After all, isn't it</p>
<p> common sense that as much as possible young children should not be</p>
<p> separated from their parents? It seems to me that the more you keep</p>
<p> them together the greater contentment there is on the part of the</p>
<p> mother or father with the problem and therefore the greater likelihood</p>
<p> that that person will be able to break the habit.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>So it's the theory that they've seen the bad habits so they might</p>
<p> as well see the getting better?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I was thinking more of the mental state of the person who's trying</p>
<p> to break the habit. But the whole ambience of a place like this is</p>
<p> anti-drugs, providing people with help and support and incentive and</p>
<p> encouragement to get out of the problem.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>It's a very different programme to the safe injecting rooms which</p>
<p> are being trialled or about to be trialled in New South Wales. Is</p>
<p> the Government changing its position on that particular type of facility?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Which facility?</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>The one in New South Wales, the safe injecting rooms</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, that's a decision of the New South Wales' Government which I</p>
<p> don't support. But I don't have any control over it because those</p>
<p> sorts of things are within the jurisdiction of the State government.</p>
<p> But I certainly find the approach of this centre and the whole atmosphere</p>
<p> and the whole ambience of it very positive, very encouraging. I'm</p>
<p> not saying it's the only way that you can handle it but it seems to</p>
<p> me to have all of the ingredients. It provides people with stability</p>
<p> and security and safety and people are around willing to help. There</p>
<p> are three things you need to do in tackling drugs. You need to educate</p>
<p> people against starting. You need to pursue the criminals with all</p>
<p> the means at your disposal. And you also need to provide people who</p>
<p> are addicted with support and hope of rehabilitation and cure and</p>
<p> that's what the Rick Hammersley Centre, as it is from today, provides,</p>
<p> from what I've seen, in a very impressive fashion.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>You also don't support Richard Court and the RFA changes. What will</p>
<p> you be telling the Liberals this weekend at the Party conference?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I haven't given any thought to my speech yet.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>[Inaudible]</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, things I say behind the scenes stay behind the scenes.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, on that score you said this morning that your first</p>
<p> priority was saving jobs in regional Australia. With regard to the</p>
<p> timber decision, I mean, what assurances can you give to people in</p>
<p> the south-west in that industry that no further jobs will be lost?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I thought the Regional Forest Agreement provided the best and most</p>
<p> balanced outcome between the competing interests for job security</p>
<p> and job generation for the timber workers and care and concern for</p>
<p> the environment and I still would like to see that agreement adhered</p>
<p> to. That's my position. If it's not adhered to and there are further</p>
<p> restraints placed on the timber industry then more jobs could be lost.</p>
<p> And I continue to argue for the maintenance of the forest agreement,</p>
<p> what I thought was a sensible balance. This is a difficult issue and</p>
<p> I don't underestimate the pressures that are upon all of us. But you</p>
<p> can't do other than try and strike a fair balance and that's what</p>
<p> I thought the Regional Forest Agreement represented and that's why</p>
<p> we put a lot of extra money into it. We ended up doubling the money</p>
<p> that we originally offered. We went a long way towards accommodating</p>
<p> the views of the State government in the Regional Forest Agreement</p>
<p> and that's why I am sorry that that Regional Forest Agreement has</p>
<p> not been adhered to by the State government.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Apart from lobbying Premier Court [inaudible] is there anything the</p>
<p> Federal Government can do because the timber workers will be calling</p>
<p> on you to do something? What position are.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, we will, of course, honour our part of the bargain and I think</p>
<p> if everybody else adhered to it the outcome would be better.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>When will the $15 million be injected into the economy there?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, it'll be injected in accordance with the agreement.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Are you disappointed with the State Coalition, the Western Australian</p>
<p> Coalition?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Oh look, I've been asked that question before, you know my position.</p>
<p> We support the agreement very strongly.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>You talk about regional jobs. The gentlemen over there wants to raise</p>
<p> the issue of the wine tax. One of the other strong industries in the</p>
<p> south-west is the wine industry and yet they say the premium wine</p>
<p> industry will be very disadvantaged by the steps that you've taken</p>
<p> in that area.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, the total impact on the industry throughout Australia is not</p>
<p> that.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Can I ask about Switzerland. It's starting to come out - details about</p>
<p> the families and the people affected by that tragedy over there. I</p>
<p> think the Swiss authorities are talking about having a service, a</p>
<p> commemorative service. Can you tell us what the Australian Government</p>
<p> is doing at the moment in response to that tragedy?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, as far as the service is concerned, if there is such a service</p>
<p> organised obviously Australia will be represented at a very senior</p>
<p> level. When we know the exact details and when it's taking place then</p>
<p> we'll say something further about that representation. Obviously it's</p>
<p> an awful tragedy. It's left the entire nation very saddened. It's</p>
<p> always particularly heart wrenching when young lives are lost, hope</p>
<p> cut off and futures denied and great sadness on their families. And</p>
<p> quite plainly the Government will provide any proper assistance that</p>
<p> is needed in relation to the identification. But I think that process</p>
<p> is underway and we obviously will provide and are continuing to provide,</p>
<p> through our embassy and our consulate, people in Switzerland all the</p>
<p> help that we can.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Would you consider attending yourself?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I think it depends a bit on what the arrangements are. I think</p>
<p> it's fair to say, and it will be made known later, that we'll be represented</p>
<p> at a very senior level.</p>
