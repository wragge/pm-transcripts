<p>There are now more Indigenous children than ever before with access to preschool or kindergarten programs as a result of the Gillard Government's unprecedented efforts to Close the Gap on Indigenous disadvantage.</p>
<p>The Closing the Gap target that all Indigenous four-year-olds living in remote communities have access to early childhood education by 2013 will be met this year.</p>
<p>This means young Indigenous Australians are getting a better start to life and are ready to learn when they get to school.</p>
<p>Achieving this target is an important first step towards closing the gap in educational attainment between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians.</p>
<p>The Gillard Government is now working to ensure this improved access to early education also leads to improved school attendance, so children continue to build on the great start that a preschool or kindergarten program provides.</p>
<p>The Closing the Gap Prime Minister's Report 2013 tabled in Parliament today also shows strong progress being made towards the target of halving the gap for Year 12 attainment.</p>
<p>The target of halving the gap in mortality rates for Indigenous children under five by 2018 is also on track to be met.</p>
<p>The Australian Government committed to the Closing the Gap targets because we knew that previous haphazard approaches to ending Indigenous disadvantage had not been good enough.</p>
<p>The Closing the Gap targets commit all governments to an overarching framework and hold them accountable to specific targets. This, together with our unprecedented investment, is beginning to make a difference, but the Government recognises that this work will take time and continued effort.</p>
<p>Government cannot close the gap alone. Closing the Gap requires a genuine partnership with Indigenous Australians at all levels and the Government is committed to a relationship based on trust and mutual respect.</p>
