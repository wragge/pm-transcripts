    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Prime Minister and Queensland Premier have signed an historic memorandum to renew the city centre, create a vibrant and liveable city and accelerate jobs growth in a City Deal for Townsville.</p>
<p>The Memorandum of Understanding sets out how all three levels of government will work together to encourage local business and employment opportunities as well as attract international investment in Townsville.</p>
<p>Early opportunities include revitalising the CBD and waterfront precinct – drawing on the Commonwealth’s commitment of $100 million for an integrated stadium and entertainment centre – and activating the State Development Area – including through delivery of the Commonwealth’s commitment of $150 million for the Townsville Eastern Access Rail Corridor.</p>
<p>The City Deal will build on Townsville’s reputation as a defence hub and leader in tropical and marine research and innovation.</p>
<p>Leaders from local, State and Commonwealth governments will meet in Townsville on Monday 14 November to discuss commitments towards the City Deal, which is on track to be the first delivered for Australia.</p>
<p>The MoU signed this week is a framework to negotiate future city deals for Queensland.</p>
