CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY RMAARanign UNTL DELIVERY<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
OPENING OF AUSTRALIAN SUBMARINE CORPORATION<br />
OSBORNE, SOUTH AUSTRALIA 16 NOVEMBER 1989<br />
Ten years ago, if someone had said that the Prime Minister<br />
and the Premier would be today opening a $ 4.6 billion<br />
submarine project here in Adelaide, that person would<br />
probably have been laughed out of the ring.<br />
It just wasn't conceivable.<br />
Australia was still debating the defence capabilities it<br />
would require for the future. It was far from certain, if<br />
submarines were to be acquired, that Australians could or<br />
would build them and it was definitely not established,<br />
even if Australians were to build them, that South Australia<br />
would be chosen as the site for their construction.<br />
But the truth about this occasion today is that it marks not<br />
only the formal start to a project that would have been<br />
dismissed ten years ago; it marks also another big step in<br />
the emergence of this state as a world-class centre of<br />
expertise in critical defence technologies, especially<br />
electronics. Just recall that a few years ago, the defence industry in<br />
South Australia meant a few companies still associated with<br />
the Defence Laboratories after the closure of Woomera.<br />
Now, South Australia is the home of some 27 defence-related<br />
companies that employ about 5,000 people.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen,<br />
That transformation hasn't happened by accident.<br />
It has happened for two very deliberate and clear-cut<br />
reasons. First, it happened because my Government was determined when<br />
it came to office to remedy the neglect into which defence<br />
planning had been allowed to fall.<br />
3376 12* 1 </p>
<p>2<br />
You may remember the famous statement by Jim Killen, the<br />
Defence Minister under the previous Federal Government, that<br />
Australia " couldn't defend Botany Bay on-a Sunday<br />
afternoon" That extraordinary admission funny if it wasn't so damning<br />
reflected the years of defence planning in which our<br />
defence force was allowed to evolve without any clear<br />
strategy for how and where it might be used.<br />
My Government was convinced from the outset that it was both<br />
practical and achievable for Australians to take full<br />
responsibility for defending our own territory and the<br />
approaches to it.<br />
We were determined that Australia should be self-reliant in<br />
its defence capacities within our alliance framework not<br />
aggressive, not militaristic, but self-reliant: capable of<br />
defending ourselves, by ourselves, if ever we need to, with<br />
a coherent strategy and an appropriate and disciplined<br />
defence structure.<br />
What this meant in practice is reflected in the occasion we<br />
are celebrating today: the modernisation of a naval force<br />
that can guard Australia's sea and air approaches. That<br />
meant building six new submarines, as well as eight new<br />
ANZAC frigates, to replace and update the current vessels<br />
when they are due to retire.<br />
Together with major restructuring of the capacities of our<br />
army and airforce, these new navy vessels will be central to<br />
ensuring our defence self-reliance well into the<br />
twenty-first century.<br />
Obviously, defence self-reliance is an easy principle to<br />
articulate but a complex one to implement.<br />
You can't have defence self-reliance unless you have a<br />
domestic industry that can nourish and support the defence<br />
forces. So the achievement of self-reliance required dramatic<br />
overhaul of all the industries related to our defence<br />
shipbuilding and repair, heavy engineering, munitions,<br />
aerospace, electronics some of the very industries<br />
essential to Australia's emergence as a strong, competitive,<br />
diversified, technologically proficient, export-oriented<br />
economy capable of making an impact in the economies of the<br />
region and the world.<br />
In addition, we have made the Government's own network of<br />
defence factories an efficient and effective part of the<br />
nation's industrial sector, cutting the cost to the taxpayer<br />
of these factories by around $ 250 million while dramatically<br />
increasing their productivity. 137 7 </p>
<p>So in achieving self-reliance in a military sense we have<br />
also been achieving self-reliance in an economic sense,<br />
laying the foundations for national prosperity into the next<br />
century. In all this, Kim Beazley has been a minister of drive and<br />
vision who has achieved a goal of importance not just to the<br />
defence forces but for all Australians.<br />
All that amounts to the first reason behind the turnaround<br />
in South Australia's defence industry.<br />
The second reason is right here: John Bannon.<br />
It was John Bannon who decided that South Australians can<br />
and should make a major contribution to the great national<br />
task of rebuilding our defence industries, and that they can<br />
and should reap the benefits of having a world-class defence<br />
industry established here in this state.'<br />
Kim Beazley has made this observation before and I take this<br />
occasion to endorse it wholeheartedly: no state Premier<br />
understood better than John Bannon the opportunities that<br />
would flow to Australia's industries as a result of my<br />
Government's decision to achieve defence self-reliance.<br />
The results of his determination to seize those<br />
opportunities are visible today.<br />
They are results too of the excellent industrial relations<br />
record of this State, exemplified by the site agreement<br />
negotiated between employers and trade unionists for this<br />
project. In winning the submarine contract, South Australia won a<br />
project that will bring one and a quarter billion dollars<br />
worth of work to. South Australia and that will create some<br />
800 skilled jobs for South Australians.<br />
And South Australia has won a lot else besides.<br />
In demonstrating their capacity to meet the uniquely high<br />
standards required to build what we believe will be the<br />
best, the most advanced, and the most potent conventional<br />
submarines in the world, SouthAustralians demonstrated<br />
their capacity to contribute across the board in defence<br />
industries. So it is not surprising that the State will win a big slice<br />
of the ANZAC frigate project.<br />
Nor is it surprising to note the potential for technology<br />
export that will arise from the submarine project.<br />
3378 </p>
<p>Let me add that, under its contract with the Australian<br />
Submarine Corporation, the Federal Government has the option<br />
of ordering two additional submarines on very favourable<br />
terms. The option expires in June 1990 and Federal Cabinet<br />
will have to consider the issue before then. Of course if<br />
we were to go ahead and order the new subs they would be<br />
built here in South Australia.<br />
I am very pleased to be able to announce today the award of<br />
another major defence contract, worth $ 90 million, to the<br />
South Australian company, AWA Defence Industries.<br />
This contract is for the installation of. electronic support<br />
measures equipment for the RAAF's P3C Orion Maritime Patrol<br />
Aircraft. The new equipment will enhance-our defence by<br />
providing a capability to analyse electronic data acquired<br />
by our Orion Fleet.<br />
Around $ 40 million of the contract will be spent in South<br />
Australia, with much of the work being undertaken by AWA<br />
Defence Industries and Hawker De Havilland.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen,<br />
The South Australian Government, South Australian<br />
industries, and South Australian workers, have brought us to<br />
this threshold of a new era for manufacturing industry of<br />
this state and for the people of this state.<br />
I congratulate you all on your achievement, and in joining<br />
John Bannon in declaring this submarine facility open, I<br />
wish you well as in years ahead you perform, together, this<br />
vital national work. </p>
