<p>Prime Minister,,<br />. wudiv ogo Into any Labor policy speech.. Mr. Wran comes--<br />bak-it'oeproposals saying that our promises would cost<br />$ i2. billioritut ha included things in that which are already' policy,<br />thins wichMr Hayen has just-committed to-hehsicdd<br />in: that things that are nowhere in the Policy speech; the increased<br />defnceexpeniitire which-is allowed for in the present Budget<br />for--example, whc ialeythr, nd included the 10 year<br />cptlcost. of-som e. things--though -it--was--a. one . yeart-annual<br />cost. It was a grossly dishonest document and I believe that the<br />peoleof Australia, wvhen they look at the document see if for.<br />themelve, ifthey did -that has not in f. act I think been<br />* Publ ished . in its' entirety.-will see that and know that.* I can<br />give you another, shorthand way of testing the accurtacy of the<br />castings.' Mr.-Hlayden has said that his proposals are worth<br />$ 20 a weeiR.. for_' every famiily. Well, you work out that with all<br />the-families in Australia, significantly over 2 billion, it hag to<br />come to a total. cost of over $ 2 billion, which is pretty much on<br />our mnark. -Now, I think that is his own admission, for example,<br />that our.-costing * of his proposals is-accurate..<br />Stone neo tequestios o raised in there was the one of defence,<br />hihconcerns most of us, in particular, in Western Australia,.<br />because we axe. fairly vulnerable at the mioment. -Wbat will happen<br />with Ian an d Iraq If America goes in and'intervenes. htwil<br />happen as far * as Australia is concerned?<br />-Prime Ilinisterare<br />going toq stay alo of from this problem and so has the Soviet<br />Union. Australia,* through its diplomatsr and now publicly,<br />have said that-it' is very important that other powers do not get<br />*... involved in this conflict;' that other powers remain alooi from<br />it. I have said very specifically that if one of the super-powers<br />gets-involved the other will almost certainly be drawn into it.<br />There is the proposal, which we have been discussing, for patrolling<br />the Straits+ of Hormuz.. because there you have 30 per cent of the<br />world's oil production passing through those Straits that is<br />: uttrlycritical + to. Japan, to Waestern. rurope. And, if the-Straits<br />did get blocked--you could not physically blocl' the Straits-but<br />if one of -the contestants sank one of the oil tankers for examXle,<br />well then othexs probably just would not sail until they could b--<br />guaranteed security.

The United States did have sormeproposals<br />on that which they -asked our views. We have. been<br />canvassing European countries' view, Third World countries,<br />India's, Japan's, other countries in the region. If that sort of<br />proposal were to develop or to become necessary and r think it ij<br />premature now in ternks of what is required if it were ever to<br />develop it might vell be . hat it would be better if-the<br />United States wer8 niot a part of it, if it were undertaken by<br />other powers. I say that bacause of the particular relationship<br />between 1raA anid the United States at the mnnoment, an~ d the<br />possibility that if the United States uere involved, that the<br />Soviet Union would feal a need to get draown in. That has beca. t-? he<br />background to our approach to that particular proposal, but the<br />United states is riot going to get involved in that war as such..<br />Everyone is trying to wake sure that it stops on the oneS hand, but<br />if it cannot be sto pped, that it is liLmited to tlha present tt~ a<br />countries; rran -and Iraq.

Would Australia naturally bea<br />Primne Minister<br />You cannot riake that " ort of assurnption, because. I hava said<br />that if there to be a need for a patrolling force and if that was<br />seen by Europewi powers, by Third World-powers,, by countries. such<br />as India, that is the first hurdle you have core to: is it seen<br />to be necessary by the-international coirmunity that is dependent<br />upon thone oil supplies. At the momnent I do not-thin-I they dosee<br />it as being necessary. But if it were seen to be necessary,<br />then who should participate? Both questions are obviously very<br />serious. The question "~ who should participaten would depend. on<br />m~ any things: the attitudesof the Luropeans, the attitudes of the<br />GuI6 states themselves, the attitudes of the OPFC countries. You<br />Just caAnot make a judgement on that nowc It is a-bit like asking<br />a hypothetical question: what would the United States do if the<br />Soviet Union started to help -Iran against Iraq. I do rot L-eUeve<br />they are going to do so. I thin3k that the Soviet Union has<br />recognisad thiat thttre are some very vital inte'. ests of WICstern.<br />powe, r s Lnvolved in thls HMiddle East situaltion, an~ d t'lst they bave<br />to tread pretty w. arily and pretty carefully becatvse while I have<br />alwaya believed and ido believe thtat the Soviet Union is totally<br />opportunist, will advance it~ s ownx cause, witinrcrease its tcva<br />doriination over other colantries if it geta thek sliqhUt-st chan-rce,<br />I also believe that they do not want, by miscalctu1ation, to PrV,_<br />a miajor conflict. Because the'y know that the -t-hole world is the_<br />loser after that. ~ Iere is a clearly recocni, evri a etr<br />interest and that makes the Soviet Union, I U iink, caautious.

<p>j~<br />Caller As a life-long Liberal, I ask you if you w~ ill admit publicly<br />that you made a vast miscalculation in your actions -which. calls<br />the Marxist Mugabe to take over Rhodesia which is nowm in a state<br />of civil war. Unless you are prepared to do this, I cannot<br />vote for you.<br />Prime Minister<br />I know how som~ e people feel about that particular issue, but. you<br />certainly mi~ understand what has, happened in Rhodesia: what was<br />-happening before the last elections. Because you had a situation<br />there where there Bishop Nuzorewa had had elections, but where the<br />white minority had reserved to it powers which would give Itcontrol,<br />vetoing powers over the constitution and over the wiahes<br />of the majority. There was no way that ' const ' itution could<br />be sustained. There was not way it was going to be ' su'pported.<br />When the Lusaka. agreements were made, ad the later Lancaster House<br />agreements between the different parties in what was then* Rhodesi'a<br />and he ~ Uinidtoe~ a tht le toelections. in yhic vro~<br />participated., which all the international observers including<br />Australian observers had regarded as free and fair, and ? 4ugaba came<br />into power. I think earlier there were many miscalculations about<br />Mr. Miugabe and, his own position. He has always been against the<br />Soviets. He did not ask East European East-. Germans -to the<br />independence day celebrations because of various activities of<br />Cast. Germany. The assistance he gets he wants to come from<br />English-speaking countries, which is one way of saying he does not<br />want too many Russian comunists around. He has done many things<br />to try and make sure-that the white people stay i~ n Zimbab'Ie. Wzhen<br />I was there for independence day celebrations, the white people were<br />looking to the f uture with a sense of confidence and optim~ ism.<br />It wdas possible, as I did, to walk around Salisbury, and everyone.<br />was in the streets: very little evidence of.. anything I did not,<br />have any particular guard or security, Just the normal. arrangements,<br />and * it was all very relaxed. ow there are soine problems.<br />Obviously, in overcoming the difficulties, and the totality of the.<br />bitterness of recent years. But, the basis of Australia's approach.<br />an approach that ' was accepted by the Commonwealth, -an approach<br />that was accepted by the United Kingdom-was that you had to have<br />a constitution in which different peoples were treated as eguals.<br />You could not have a constitution which gave permanent superiority<br />to the white population. As a result of the settlement izt Zimbabwe<br />which, in spite of difficulties, is proceeding relatively wslt and<br />is the only thing that would give Zimbabwe and all people in<br />Zimbabwe hope of peace there was no prospect of peace under the<br />old a-rrangem4-ent in spite of all of that, what is happening gives.<br />us some continued hope that it is all going to work in reasonable<br />way and that the country will have -a good future as a united,<br />multinational country. TIhe attitude that Australia adopted.. that<br />was accepted by the Cowmonwealth and by the United Kingdom, was<br />right, and I am afraid that you will never get me to apologise<br />for the approach that Australia took in that particular contest<br />because it was very necessary. It was very right. It has pravented a.<br />much greater conflagration in Southern Africa, and between black<br />and white. / 4<br />I</p>
<p>61T., 6/ 10/ 80 4-<br />Stone It's a quarter past nine, and we would like you to be as brief<br />as possible so that everyone can get their questions in.<br />Prime m'inister<br />I'm sorry about thati but<br />I' Stone I wasn't so Vuch talking about<br />Prime Minister<br />I know the hard-core that agked me that question over here, and,<br />I am~ In a sense glad they did because L thinX what we did in<br />relation to Zimbabwe is one the beat thin-gs we have ever done-in<br />terms of foreign policy.<br />Yes. That comment was more for listeners than for you. sut i<br />j the cap fits, fine.<br />caller Good. I'm glad you said that. We have met several ttres oVer<br />the jetty,* but..<br />Prime minister<br />Oh, Busselton.<br />-Caller We have'also more important things, I think we may have lost:, buti<br />hope not to lose the nuclear power issue vhich look,<br />Ralph Nader was cu. there recently and he ( inaudible) but he'a notr<br />the only person that said it. The bauxits ref inery is maz th.<br />It is just enorm. ous quantities of electricity, auid we saw4 sclmething<br />of this on the weekend on talevision. Is there in fact, accord Ing<br />to your knowledge, a proposal to put a nuclear power Plaot With-, n<br />the next six years in Wosley or near Sanbuary?<br />Prime minister<br />Well, this is a State issu. e, and thic St'ate Covernrient sha<br />plans for the es ihetoi nuclear pcxrstation. Bu t 1:<br />not aware that any location has beer. determiined to this poin t<br />Obviously, all the anvirninantal procedures .,, euld gone throuqgh<br />before any decision was nade in relation $ to that. it is rot<br />something that I have disCu* ssed with Sir Charles Courkt for may<br />many months, but it is a matter that is totally % 4ithifl th,. rvic<br />of the State.<br />Oni-rcnt election talecast foQr you Government, thtezh:</p>
<p>6WF, 6/ 10/ 80-S<br />Caller ( continued)<br />what your Governm~ fent was doing, or planned to do for the diiabled.*<br />Now, what it didn't $ how-however, ' were the cripples that: your<br />Government has taken the pension away from: the invalid pension.<br />Now, if, as I anticipate you might say this<br />Prime Minister<br />Do you know any people where this has happened to?<br />Caller. Well, niAy I finish-the question sir?<br />Prine Minister<br />Yes, certainly.<br />Caller I* anticipate that you will say that -I an' going by n evs p a 0a r<br />reports if as you say, thi's is not so, could you explain to m~ e<br />why ACOSS, the Australian Council of Social Security, are taiting<br />legal proceedings against your Government on this very issue. I<br />there is no purge of invalid pensions, what is the ACOSS case al I.<br />about? Prime Kinister<br />I do not know. I would have to get a brief ing on what the ACOSS<br />case ise all about. There was substantial publicity, especially<br />in Sydney, about invalid pensions. As I had been advised by the<br />Minister, every case that was mentioned in the newspaper was in.<br />fact in the Social Security appeals system.--But to make sure thatjustice<br />could-be seen to be done, some weeks ago we announced<br />that anyone who felt that the Department of Social Security had<br />made a wrong decision would be given the right to appeal to the'<br />Administrative Appeals Tribunal; a comipletely impartial arid<br />separate-body. I would like you to do two things. If you know of<br />any case where you think an invalid of any kind has been treated<br />unfairly by the Department, I would like personally to know of it.<br />And secondly, make sure that any such person knows that they do have<br />a full arid total right of appeal to an impartial tri-bunal. 13ecauss<br />when you look at the numbers of people who have got invalid 1<br />pensions, it does not support the kind of contention that is behjind<br />the question, because the numbers getting invalid pensions have<br />grownm very greatly, and the funds in real terms thit we a&amp; re<br />providing to assist the disabled have groun very greatl. y. I<br />followed the publicity in the neaspapers with so~. e very real1<br />conicern., because I wqould agree totally with the questioner; that<br />the Augtralian co-imunity ought to show a veryv real cozapassion and<br />concern for our people who are less well off in this co-a-unity.<br />Caller Ca I tit put in,' Yr hrierf. y-tJ t. ' tr .1 . i~<br />in eiccellent hands. How-aver, my question is: what ise thfa<br />doing to help young people to finance their first home?<br />5</p>
<p>6W?, 6/ 10/ 80 -6<br />Pr ime Minister<br />Well, thank you for what you have said. Mhat we a re trying.<br />to do is to provide funds which ' will enable people to help to.<br />cover the deposit. So we have a home savings grantsschemne -which--<br />has been developed over the last couple of years. There are-hou3e<br />value limits on it, and we extended, in my policy speech, the<br />value limits to a total of $ 70,000 for first: home buyers, and at<br />the same timne we have made a decision that the granrt would be<br />Increased from the presen~ t $ 2,000 to $ 2,500 for couples with one<br />child, and to $ 3,000 for couples with two or more children. So..<br />9'.. the purpose of the home savings gr~ ant is designed to encourage<br />people, or-,-to make it easier for people, to cover that. initial<br />deposit which is sometimes very diffiicul~ t to raise. Quite, apart.<br />f rom that, the policies are general ones; -to try and maintain<br />r a good flow of funds into housing which has happened over recent<br />years the funds have continued to grow from a variety of c~ ursesa,<br />and of course to run a sensi-ble economy so that homfe ccsts do not._..<br />rise too much.<br />Stons-<br />Mr. Fraser, can you state that home interest* will not. go up.<br />Prime Minister<br />No.. You cannot make predictions about home Interest rates..<br />I did once in a dif ferent onvirorument, amd in the 12 months after<br />I did, interest rates did fall very substantially, but: then<br />somiething happened which I had not bargained for: interest ralte a<br />V started to rise very rapidly in the United Kingdom and they rose*<br />very rapidly, and ultimately to about 20 per cent in the United<br />States. Against that background, it is quite plain there Ls . some<br />impact on Australia. So, it is market forces that inf luencea that:,<br />but let wre only say that under policies that would increase<br />inflation, . interest raesoldoup Our political opponents<br />have admitted that under their policies interest rates would in<br />fact go up.<br />Caller Good aor-ning Mr. F'raser. i; ' it true that in the Soviet Union<br />Pravda has repeatedly condemned you and applauded Kr. Hayden, the<br />leader of the Gang of Three? if this is true, why has this<br />receivad so-little attention from our Australian media?<br />Prifme Minister<br />I do riot ) cncow-.. I-ell, i t is certainly true. The Rupaj, 7,,-<br />n!? wsagencies do not seem to 1 ike me very much because I point* oit<br />that r thi~ k klheir policies are dangerous and that. they spend tao'<br />much mnoney on defence. ' They r in fact spending 12 per cant or<br />14 per cent a year on def ence, o f their -national -income, w. hich is<br />an enormousr a-mount. The United States is around 5 per cent or<br />6 per cent. There was an intervention a couple OE weehs ago f rom<br />ona otf the Rusaiafl new:-4agenc1.

<p>-7<br />Prime Minister ( continued)<br />T think the m~ ore that is known, the maore people would be<br />concerned at the attitudes of the Soviet Union and at the<br />interference in our domestic political affairs.<br />Caller-Mr. Fraser, I think we should have A referendum on non.-European.<br />iimigration; whether the Australian people want it or not.<br />Prime Minis~ ter.<br />That is fair enough, but there are some decisions that Govezrnments7-<br />just have to make, then it is our job to try and persuade that<br />the decisions we have made are right. As a result of North<br />Vietnamss victory in the Vietnam war, something upwards of a mill-iont<br />refugees got pushed out of South Vietnam not-i~ niediately, but<br />you will rememnbe~ r all the publicity about the boat people. aad.<br />they were the independent people who did not fit into the communist<br />_-regime an~ d.. theyW pgpfqrced out to sea-in ships,_ and hundred-s of<br />thouzands. on general estiimates,~ twould hve rowne at-sea. Soi-&amp;.<br />landed at Darwin but a lot more in Indonesia or Malaysia. Than<br />again, Vietnam, supported by the Soviet Union, invaded Kampuchea'<br />and some morec hundreds of thousands of refugees from Kampuchea<br />iJnto Thailand and that is a regime that had suffered enormous<br />har= and difficulty first as a result of its own ruler'' PoLiPolt and."<br />secondly as a result of the invasion by Vietnam. -1 really do<br />believe that a relatively wealthy country such as Aus traliaC, ' Which<br />does have a good deal-of space in it, has an obligation to the<br />wider international community. We have very particular and<br />special obligations, of course, to all Australians to ou~ r Uown<br />people. But we live in one world. We are part of that world.<br />So, I believe that where there is a very savage and severe refugee<br />proble-i, especially if it is in our own part of the worl that<br />we have an obligation to do as' much as we can to help. -I am afraid<br />it is up to me and up to my Hiiniaters and Members, to, try ahd<br />persuade you that that is the right policy.<br />Caller i suppose you would call me a swinging voter. I think I am a<br />* disillusioned voter.<br />Prime Minister<br />I am sorrv about that*, but can I try and answaer your que-tati.<br />Caller Yes, any-way. It has-been said that Australia has a P.-esidenkjal.<br />type of rloverrunnt, where dacisions are made. at Cabinet lavel and<br />voted along Party lines in the Parliament. You mentioned. thle nature<br />of the debate in Parliament. I wionder if this may be the caune<br />of the-rather aggressive and very difficu t to listen to on radio<br />typo: debate that goes on. It has also been~ said that wr'. en ; n<br />Parj~~'. ft: ould perhap's af fect the tone. of the debate there, and<br />I wondered whether you saw a-role for ioen i n Go'; erriment,~ u<br />do not know that you have too many -domfai standing, cei~ tain! v rnolt<br />in thi~ s State.<br />614F, 6110180</p>
<p>6' 6/ 10/ 80 -8-<br />.~., Pritiv-Minister<br />I do see a role for women in Governmrent, and I have always been<br />disappointed thaV -there are not more womenf in the Parliament.<br />They have traditionally been given places, in the pre-zelectioa<br />process on the Senate tickets of the Liberal Partyt and Senator<br />Guilfoyle of course, and Yvonne McComb is a Senate candidate in<br />Queensland, and in other places. But for the Hou~ se of Representative<br />I think nothing like as m~ ny wormen as -men have stood for<br />pre-selection in the House of Representatives. I agree with you,<br />not too m~ any of then have actually got pro-selection. This is -the<br />samen for all political parties. I again say, that I of ten wish<br />it were otherwise. You might be interested to know that in<br />Victoria and I mention ary own, State, because I will probably get.<br />muddled on the precise constitutional details of the Liberal Party<br />in each State, it isi a Federation and each State has its awn,<br />constitution but-in~ Victoria right since 1945 ; e have had a<br />provision that in all the offices of the Party, they have to be<br />balanced; ' men, women. On the State Executive of the Party we have<br />ten wmen from the country, ten raen frmtecuty. ehv<br />wi-rm0n frimthe , ity* hVa ve-t en tmen fram the citV*.<br />4Vice-President. ' qe have a male Vice-President. The conStitation<br />itself, long before this was a general political quiestion,<br />enshrined equality of the sex~ es. I thLink this is one of the reasons<br />that has helpedl the Liberal Party in Victoria very maurch. But, I<br />do not know how you either get or. ppersuade more women to stand for-<br />Parliament, more women to be successful candidates. Personally, r<br />Would like to see it.<br />caller<br />Mr. Fraser, I would li-ke to say first of all that it is great-to h V~<br />someone like you as a leader. I am a Liberal, but i do not think<br />you have to be a Liberal to be proud to have youi represerting us<br />on the international scene too..-Your Goverrnent's policy on<br />petrol parity pricing of course has hit our hip pocket and I think<br />broug~ ht us down to earth with the conflict between Iraq and Iran.-<br />But is there any evidence that this policy is actually aidIng<br />Australia in conservation. You know, are Australians becoing<br />energy conscious?<br />Prim~ e Minister<br />Yes, it is.. it -is helping I th ink in a n u r of Ways-.-peepie ars'<br />obviously moving to buying -more economical carst and the motor<br />. s1 tp s e t f ah g re t i p et s b hi n t h . o l c<br />industv bPidtht eople are'<br />Well over-$ 1,000 milljion of additional explor, in zip de-velop-cent.'<br />As : i result of that, Bass Str-alt reserva-S have been extende4<br />significantly, because mare oil been fovwnd. The grea't<br />North West Shelf project; that is only viable under a certain.'<br />1pricing regime.

<p>6W?, 6/ 10/ 80-<br />Prime IHinister ( continued)<br />But without a parity pricing policy for fuel, it would be I thinlk.<br />very hard to sustain it. The other thing of course,, that we hiave<br />to watch out for, is that ' the Bass Strait reserves are f inite.<br />In the 1990s. at some point they will start to dry up pretty<br />rapidly. N~ owt unless we have found alternatives by then Australia<br />is going. to have to make the very dif ficult problens of adjustnent.<br />so our policies; are encouraging people to look for alternatives.<br />The best prospect at the moment is oil from Queensland shale.<br />The objective is that that would come on stream about the time<br />Bass Strait starts to dry up. tThis would maintain Australia's<br />self -suff ien, 6 and sense of independence. I think you are quite<br />right to point out that as a result of the ' war in Iran and Iraq,<br />it is very necessary that we do maintain that independence. 1( e are<br />not going to do it under promises of reducing the price of petrol.<br />En fact, the Labor Party have not promised to reduce the price of.<br />petrol. They have--promised for the future to increase* the price<br />of patrol, either by the am~ ount of the OPEC price increases or<br />by the rate of inflation whichever is the lesser. Since. Lalbor<br />policies mtehan woupld rceg~ reatlyf ptroinclrea. se vould pther obaabma-oulnyt --g--of -o&amp;. infl-atigon, o ing-. uLy-that th.<br />amount of O? 9C price increases which certainly before the wa r w e<br />starting to moderate.<br />c~ aller<br />I too am one of those swinging voters. . I have a couple of points,<br />here and I. wonder if . you would coiment please. We hear much * of the'<br />superphosphate bounty which I believe amounts to something les<br />than $ 6 million a year. I believe that the-TV. schools which the.<br />Government spends something like $ 19 million a year we do' not<br />hear very much about this, and then the other point is, in the.<br />Farmers Weekly, issue 18 September, heading " BPC to be axed<br />after the election".-I will just read one or two points briefly.<br />" Canberra; the British Phosphate Commission -will be phased out in-.<br />June next year and replaced by the organisation set up for the<br />Australian fertilizer manufacturers. The move, supported by the'<br />Federal Government, will give fertiliser manufacturers control of<br />all phosphate rock imported to Australia. It will also provide*<br />them wdith a monopoly power to. set their ovn prices. The proposed<br />plan, kept under wraps by the Federal Government Cabinet will not<br />be. announced until after the coming election for fear of alienating<br />the rural vote". May... have a comrnient please Mr._ Fraser.<br />Prim Minister<br />S. 4 Yes. But. t can agk you -were you earlier saying the superphospilhate.<br />. bounty, $ 6 million only. What was that $ 6 million you mntionedi in<br />relation to the bousty?<br />Caller Yes. Pr ime. Minister<br />W811, * it cbvirovsly costs very ' nuch mor than that. I haen,:<br />got the precise ftgure in my ttind, bit theP superpboohats boILn1v<br />would cost very very substantial'Ly more than that jh~ a EIC" Ura<br />9</p>
<p>6WFO 6/ 10/ 80<br />Prima Minister ( continued)<br />in my mind -no, I had better not give it because r just do not<br />Kcarry it and I would not wan t to mislead you. But it is a VerI<br />much more costly policy than that.<br />There is a film and television school, which I think is very<br />ndeocmeessstaicr y. a nd Auwsotrrlda limaanr kfeitsl. a s arrn e onneo w sesntsaer, t inthge yt o a-droe tvheer y flwaegl-l in.<br />carriers for Australia. In the policy speech we ann~ ounced new<br />* incentives to encourage people to invest in film ma-king.

The'r e is<br />certainly no secret plan which is going to lead to miassive-increa sea.<br />in the cost of superphosphate which is being kept under wraps<br />until after the election. indeed, our policies have done a qreat<br />deal to support the farming cotm-unities and to re-establish<br />confidence in Australia's rural industries,-to -provide the<br />necessary financial eupports and encouragements which help people'<br />variable seasons.<br />-There is. no secret plan, there is no secret wteapon, that is going<br />to be unpleasant in relation to this.<br />Mr. F'raser, you mentioned the f Ilm industr-y and Sen~ ator Susan Rya~ n<br />said that she felt that the filzi industry and the re-emarqtng i'<br />industri in Australia vmz under some thet Wha do you<br />prpse to do to keep ha going?<br />Prim---Minister<br />Well, what had hajp,. ened was that because we teve been pietty<br />assiduous In tax evoidance maasures, the basis of-fu: in iir t<br />f i Ln ndustry because we knocke-d of f somte tax avoidance schae. 4.<br />-the b,-sis -of fundin~ g for the fil-industry-a-nd feature f, Djtz<br />epially, was in a sense destroye d.

If people have tha courage<br />and belief that they are backing a really goodi quality film,. there<br />will also now be goad money and good profits in it. This is in * fact<br />what the f ilm industry were asking for. Wet have done it. I have<br />since had V~ ttera saying " please, will you get back in quickly and.<br />legislate for it so. we can get oniwith film -making under these<br />arrangements". I was very disturbed when t found, as a quite<br />by-product of pursuing tax avoidance, we found that we were.<br />catching up'with the mechanisms used to enco -urage investment in,<br />the filmi industry. But the way to solve that was to provide<br />specific incentives for the film industry, which we have. done.-<br />Caller Mr.* Fraser, I am going to touch upfon severaL points which are<br />of profound importance to Australia, and will have far-reaching<br />repercussions., The first of course, is-the figures that have been<br />released recently from a RIoman Catholic organisation. -in Melbourne-<br />: which -compute the f igure of -2 million * who are. living'i ~ rli---<br />at the present moment on or below the poverty line. This ' is in<br />contrast to a figure of one million brought out in 1976 by<br />Hr. Henderson the Henderson Report. How, that actually, that<br />figure has doubled in four years. This iz als3o borne., ouat.<br />acualymae criain seven, may 1' state! a aquick. Ca~ culatiri.<br />is also-borne out by. Xr. Sadbe1' s(?) comnent. yesterday . wiere be<br />says14 per cent, or oein seven, in Perth, are living on. or be1ow<br />the poverty line. Somewhere along the line, economic management<br />in a very, very wealthy country like Australia has sadly maissed<br />out. They have qone astray. This high figure shouldn't., exist<br />in a country with such large natural wealth -enormous natural<br />wealth that Australia has.<br />Stone If you have two othsr points, 11n, sorry to interrupt, but you<br />will need to be briefer.<br />Caller defence not conventional defence of vhich we are. all eyV er* v.<br />wrappsd up in, and consider it to be mv. 06 Lmportant, but -which L~<br />do not approve of, I would say the majority of Australians, is3<br />nuclear defence, and I ari re-ferring to the B-52 bombers and t~ he<br />nuclear submiarines using our facilities. We have the Americants<br />defence w ord that they they will not carry nuclear weapona but<br />-their word over the years has proved cannot be trusted. And inw% 1) ber<br />three is, how soon can we expect you to da--rec&gt; qnise the raurderous<br />Pol Pot regt, re who incidentally have b-sen pfupdsrinq all the rice<br />donations I believe that should have been goirva to th. e-peopibp.<br />6/ 8/ 80</p>
<p>P r fr,-inister<br />I will deal with those in the reverse order. The Pol Pot regime<br />is a loathsome and horrible regimet and let me make that quite<br />plain. But-what we have been concerned for is ' to try a-nd have<br />policies that will ultinately enable the Kampuchean people to ma3ke<br />a decision about their own future. ' At ths raoment there. axe<br />220,000 Vietnamese in that country supporting another regime that<br />is just as much loathed by the Kaimpucheansy as t understand it,<br />as Pol Pot. The number of guerillas fighting the Vietnamese has<br />doubled over the last 12 months, ' which is some indication that they<br />are not real1 y welcomed in the counmtry. There will be a. vote in thxe-<br />United N~ ations fairly shortly on the credentials issue. everyone<br />has agreed that the Vietnarrese-backed puppet Gove r-amnt should<br />not be given the seat in the United Nations. The only other thinq-<br />T want to say about is that there will be a statem~ ent from<br />Australia after Chat credentials vote. We have placed a great,<br />deal of importance on working with ASFAH countries who are in the<br />fron't line of this partic-ular problem. ' They want peace in their<br />awn, part of the world very much, and I think we have'some obligation<br />I am glad you regard defence as im~ portant, bult we also need tb'<br />understand that the Soviet Union has overdheliaing con-vention" l<br />superiorlty, and the only thing that has kept the world t'o any<br />extent safe, the only thing that has prevented war in Surope, is<br />over a long period the extent oaf laerican nuclear p owe r. TLhe<br />Suropeans, all now I-noyw that the dae~ eace of Western 01; ropAe i~ a. e<br />on the use of nuclear posier, and very shortly aaih -ot necastarfly<br />in major inter-continental weaponsr-' but cert-ainly tc L~ ie~ aweapons<br />the Suropeans know that they. cannot be defended any othr<br />way because of the size of the Russian armies and the nature of<br />the Russian armies in the Warsaw countries. We are an ally of the.<br />United States., It is im~ portant, I thinkr, for us to rem-a-ber. that.'<br />It is important also to rcieeither that the Soviet Union has be-en<br />extend ing its influence, while other wnpires have properly been.-<br />dismantled. The de-colonisation process has gone or% in all the<br />yeara since the war. Th;? Soviet Union has expanded its empire.<br />and done so in a very ruthless way. There are workers iii Poland<br />at the moment trying to establish sxne little part in the freedoms<br />that you and I and all Australiana just take for granted. But<br />they are doing it uinder the shado-d of Soviet involverment and<br />activity as the Soviets did Ln relation to Hungary , Ld Cze-hoslova-ia<br />in earlier years. So, in a world whiris the Soviet Union is.<br />expa~ nding its defence torcesq very greatly, those people in CC-untriez<br />who want independence and want freedon, must work tooether to<br />A advance their own causa an-d to defend their oif-n ltberbiea T at<br />dosJnvolve co-oparation with tha Unitad StAte A111sie ta<br />have been in coclzbkirn ' Soound MNr-llit lam iS -ecord asmitnq stg<br />PatWaea~ wihl t wteict to h -othpee rate e UnTi teed AS tsa tesr. li nL .1<br />in thaze a reas.</p>
<p>6W~, 6/ 10/ 80 -KP<br />rime 1Minister ( continued)<br />The B-52 mtissions, ' which if the agreements can be sorted4 out<br />appropriately and protecting, as of course they would, Austrafian<br />sovereignty in its totality, are for surveillance Mtissionsoverthe<br />Indian Ocean where there is an important part'of a shared<br />objective with the United States.

If tey could transit through Darwin,, it<br />would enable them to undertake the same functions with very rauchi<br />less physica , ef fort on their own account. And again, providing<br />arrangements can be worked out adequately, I think that we -ought<br />to co-operate with the United States in that: sense. And ttie-will.,<br />So, we just cannot-sit back and say we are prepared to be defended<br />by the United States and that is good enough. That wilt protect. u,<br />and we are not going to do anything on our own account.

Jiber'ty-r<br />The 1 irst ques tion you asked was then about the alle-ged level<br />of poverty in Austtaila. * if ind it, very dif ficult -to accept.. those_<br />figures. 1 think, especially, looking around a city such as'<br />Perth, it would be very hard to accept those figures. it is worth'<br />noting that the standard rate of pension is a higher proportion., of.<br />average weekly earnings, and has reached a higher proportion of<br />average wetekly earnings under'twy-Governmen-t. than it ever did<br />under the Labor -Government -qite signific ant~ iyhighej'and I t ' has<br />been maintained on that basis. Because, we com1ritted ourselves<br />to twice yearly indexation of pensions for the full extent of<br />changes in the Consumer Price. rndex. You might have since you.<br />asked this question you might have listened to mr. -Hayden's<br />policy speech where he said that the highest point had been reached<br />in effect ina Budget that he introduced in 1975. -But that Is not<br />correct, because what he did was to take a pension f igure -as it<br />was going to relate to November 1975 and put that over the averageweekly<br />earnings figure for June of 1915 and. it worked out a.<br />certain percentage. Tha right way to work out those figures,-andthe<br />way ths Statistician, or the Department, works them ouit<br />always, is the level of pension at any one timke namely . Tn<br />November 1975 and put that over the averagi Ãµ weekly earnings<br />figure for November 1975. on that basis, you would find** ta~<br />Kr. Hlayden's claim to have eatablished a higher level as a<br />percentl-age of average weekly earnings for pensions wias a false on* e.'<br />I thin~ k you also need to look at other thing's that we are doing to.<br />help the * disadvan taged people in the! Australian cormaunity. have<br />spent very large sumq-indeed on supporting nearly 1,200 projects<br />to build homes for elderly people and for frail aged.

<p>6W71, 6/ 10/ 80 14.<br />Prime Minister ( continued)<br />I really do believe' that if you speak to people who are working<br />in these areas, they will pay-recognition to the very great<br />progress that has been inade over the last four or f iVi-years..<br />Stone That figure that Verai~ ntiohed, the two million under the poverty<br />line, was released by the B~ otherhood of St. Lawrence, and .1<br />assume a great number of that two million come -from the unemployed.<br />Who's responsill~ ty is unem~ ployment?<br />Prime minister<br />it is ever-lone's responsibility.

Ply t r think both those<br />figures ara encouraging for our policies. W o<br />talkback last night some 16,17 year old girls ringing m~ e and teld1ing9<br />me that they have difficulty. They had left school young, before<br />they had a job lined up and I think they would have been much<br />. better. off staying at school, or if they wanted to leave school<br />go into sotte sort of further technical or vocational train ing i<br />they were not able to go straight to a job and we have established<br />Speci~ al training pf~ orrmeus.

<p>Caller Some-of the Labor Party politicians have ( inaudible) admitted.<br />that they will introduce capital gains tax and possibly<br />re-introduce death duties to re-distribute the country's wealth,:<br />as they put it. What effect do you think capital gains tax would<br />have on the general confidence in business, in farm~ ing, anid oni the<br />=, all investor who possibly only wishes to buy -a block and build a<br />house on it with the idea of, having something increaing in value<br />as the years go by. And also, how would this affect employment<br />in the future?<br />Prime minist~ r<br />J think capital taxes of this kind would be m~ ost unfortuaate..<br />But depending on which spokesman you go to, there is no doubt that.<br />the Labor Party have certainly committed themnselves to introducing<br />a capital tax. Some have comtrzited themselves to a. capital1 gains<br />tax, to a wealth ta-n odat uis Mr.. Willis said that it.<br />was wrong that we did not have a combination of these, or maybe all<br />-three of them together. Lionel Bowen has said that a ' wealth tax,<br />Ihch -would'l6e tax-nbt only onl companies afid ehottc6ratiorf-4M. 1<br />small businesses, but % would be a. tax on the wtealth of all Australian<br />families, would raise $ 1, S00 million. Iniagine having to have<br />somebody go through your house once a year to see whether it had<br />changed in value to see ' what tax you had to pay on it. And death<br />uties, I believe under this Labor Government, would4 ciertainly come<br />U.-' back. Now, one of the problems with capital taxes of this kind. is<br />ttthey are not taxes on profits. You could have situationswhr<br />the profitability on a farm, or for that matter in difficult<br />circumstances other small businesses, is very-low, but because Of..<br />inf lation induced by Government the actual capital value Of the farm,.<br />or the capital value of the small business, has g-rown. And<br />therefore, you are going to have to pay tax on the capital induced<br />by Government policies, but you will not have any incom~ e to pay it<br />out of. Therefore, you are forced to sell up the business or Celt<br />up the farm. When Labor's inflation reached 17 per cent, the<br />costs farm costs went up 30 per cent in that year, The<br />prof itability of farms was virtually nil. If you had had a capital<br />gains tax, you would have had to pay tax-. You would not have had<br />an incomie to do it, and the tax could well have been considerable<br />-eauoef Labor's Governmrent-induced inflation. Now, this sort of<br />thing would destroy businesses, It would destroy small busisne-se~ s<br />and it would destroy farmers in the pastoral industry. -Thah is<br />of the reasons we got rid of death duties, because did ian<br />people to have to be worrying all) thier lives as to Vhether they<br />were going to have th. eir son3 and f zi lies carrying on. f3tr thty<br />had died.: better to pay as you qo. But it is only a couple o. ( jays<br />ago that Senator 14alsh reaffirtned tha L r. art. y'a poi'e~ t<br />theae taxes. Mr. Hayden has made his position quite clear,. It<br />would be a massive attack on Australian enterprise.<br />Calle-Tw~ o qiuestiong, and I -dill try and be brief.

<p>6Wt?, 6/ 10/ 80<br />C. 3Ller ( continued)<br />one of these of course was your treatment of Medibank, and youseem<br />to have gone out of your way to avoid mentioning this in<br />your election manifestLo. What is going to happen to what<br />rem~ ains of tMedibank after this election if you are returned to<br />power, and health care in general?<br />PrLtie minister<br />They are fair enough qUeStiOnS. if you look through the policy<br />speech from 19,75 or 1977, you will see that; over-whelming the<br />comnitments that we ( nade have been met and-met-In their<br />entirety, overwhelming, There have been one or two areas3 where<br />w-had objectives which we have not been able to meet in their<br />entirety. International circuumstances had changed very<br />considerably. I have got to say that in 19.75#-l believed the<br />international econonies would improve, that they would grow, and<br />that would help AustralLa to some extent. Well:, they have* not.<br />Kany international econom~ ies are in a much worse state than<br />Ausrala'sat-the-present-tiwe. _ Eut-what-we did do.,. is. omk<br />a decision very firmly that we would put Australia first in<br />everything that we did, and if * we had to alter tha out. of our<br />sails, the setting of our uails to some extent, -to make sure that<br />we had the best'~ and the wisest policies for Australia, well then.<br />we were going to do that. I havs said that many. times over recent*<br />weeks. it would be very wrong to stay with a policy if domestic<br />or-interniational circumstances. made that policy quite<br />inappropriate for Australia. Goverrnments must. have the capacity--<br />to make the decisions that they think are best for Australia at<br />any one point. But in short compass, if you o through those<br />policy-Speecbes, you will find that overihelmirgly the ccrmitmen ts<br />have been met. For the years ahead, I would like you to look at<br />our policies and to look at, the Labor Party's policies, and see<br />which ones will do best for Australia in the coraing years.<br />would like you just to think that in 1915, this economy was doing<br />much worse than most world econom~ ies. Now, in 1980, -we are doing<br />much better and our inflation is lower, our growth is greater, our*<br />growth in employment is. m~ oving ahead quite strongly over the las-. t<br />12 months.<br />You ' also asked me a question about Medibank. Wh at we have had to<br />try and do is to conserve the expenditure of Gver=. ent doLlarS,_-<br />which in fact have-to be taken from people Ocvarnments do-not have<br />any funds of their own and anytl inq Government,-spelnd 1havetob<br />taken f rom taxpayerg.

So what we have done is. to try and<br />concentrate Covernztent resources in the pension and. wlfr araa<br />and on other people who are regarded as disadvantaged.

Would<br />you like to tell the public what areas or initiatives you are<br />going to take in protecting the. environment and conservation..<br />Prime Minister-<br />Well, we have acted quite dramatically " nd very firmly'to<br />protect the environmpent. There are the environnment protection<br />acts of course, and we work. very closely with the states ia<br />relation to that. We have shown that we are prepared to act<br />even if there is some difficulty because of Fraser Island where<br />we banned mining from Fraser Island. In uranium mtning in the<br />.

All these action's<br />have been takerd and obviously will be maintained. I also anounced<br />a short while ago that we.. have emnbarked on the world conseriation<br />strategy applying that to Australia which Is a very1<br />comprehensive approach to all the problems of the environment<br />atos pmaakret osuf reo urt hcart eidt enist iaplrso, t etchtee dB afrorrie rf uRtuereef , yethaer s-.
