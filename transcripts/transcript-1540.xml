ASIAN TOUR 1967 LAOS<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER, HAROLD HOLT,<br />
AT DINNER GIVEN BY THE AUSTRALIAN Ai1ASSADOR<br />
AT VIENTIANE 2ND APRIL, 1967<br />
Altesses, Excellences, Mesdames, Messieurs and that will be<br />
the end of my French for tonight! I am not obliged to continue<br />
in French, as the Australian Ambassador seems to have performed<br />
this function for me already.<br />
First, let me say how happy my wife and I are to be<br />
among such a distinguished gathering tonight. Before I put<br />
the toast to you, may I say that it is with much regret my wife<br />
and I and our party come close to the end of this memorable<br />
first visit to Laos.<br />
We have not only greatly enjoyed our visit, we feel<br />
we have learned something which will be helpful to us and we<br />
hope will be helpful to you. We've been greatly impressed by<br />
the number of people we've met, Laotians and others from other<br />
countries here, who all seem to manifest a spirit of dedication<br />
and enthusiasm for what they are able to accomplish in this<br />
country. It is an inspiring experience which we shall take<br />
away with us. It is in the spirit of the warmest friends hip, of<br />
admiration for your distinguished leadership in His Majesty<br />
The King and the Prime Minister and his colleagues of the Cabinet,<br />
supported as they are so strongly by the people of Laos, that<br />
I ask you to join with me and assist an Australian Embassy and<br />
an Australian Prime Minister to honour the toast of His Majesty<br />
The King and the Prime Minister and the people of Laos. May<br />
our friendship ever deepen and increase. </p>
