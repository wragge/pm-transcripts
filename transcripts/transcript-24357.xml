    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Commonwealth Science Council, chaired by the Prime Minister, met for the second time today in Canberra.</p>
<p>The meeting was also attended by the Minister for Industry and Science, the Minister for Health, the Minister for Education, and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry and Science.</p>
<p>Science is at the centre of Australian industry and science and technology are central elements to improving our productivity and competitiveness.</p>
<p>The Commonwealth Science Council is an important source of advice to the Government in this respect.</p>
<p>Amongst the discussions today, the Council focussed on STEM and future Science Research Priorities.</p>
<p>The Government, with the Chief Scientist, will consult the science sector and industry to bring together a whole of government policy for science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM).</p>
<p>These consultations will help formulate a policy that will enhance Australian competitiveness, support high quality education and training, maximise research potential and strengthen international engagement through STEM.</p>
<p>The STEM agenda will help ensure that Australiaâs world-class science and world-leading industry collectively secure our future economic strength and prosperity.</p>
<p>Building our STEM capability is critical to increasing Australiaâs future scientific performance.</p>
<p>It is vital that we have a strong and effective national approach.</p>
<p>In addition to discussing STEM, items for the Commonwealth Science Council included setting national science and research priorities, implementation of the Boosting the Commercial Returns from Research strategy, carrying out the Industry Growth Centres initiative and the Research Infrastructure Review.</p>
<p>The Commonwealth Science Council, which includes representatives from Government, business and science, provides strategic advice to Government on science and technology issues and is building stronger collaboration between scientists, researchers and industry.</p>
<p>Information about the consultation and how to be involved will be available on <a href="http://www.science.gov.au">www.science.gov.au</a> in coming weeks.</p>
<p>The Commonwealth Science Council will meet again in the second half of 2015.</p>
<p>13 April 2015</p>
