FOR MEDIA MONDAY, 27 SEPTEMBER 1982<br />
GREENING OF AUS'I2RALIA, SYDNEY<br />
For a long while the new settlers came to Austalia when they<br />
found a good bit of land one of the first things they did was<br />
to cut all the trees down or to ringbark them and seek to ieave<br />
some open space. They had the view hich they thought wzac;<br />
right then, but which ve now know is very misguided. They<br />
thought cutting the trees down made the land more productive,<br />
you could carry more sheep or carry more cattle or grow<br />
more wheat and they did not realise that in part at least,<br />
they could be doing very great damage to the land which they<br />
then thought they were improving. You can still see in many<br />
parts of Australia forests of dead trees which result because<br />
of those earlier bad farming or pastoral practices.<br />
There are other things of course which have reduced tree cover in<br />
Australia, repetitive drought and that is one of the things<br />
that we are experiencing now, again there is the question of<br />
disease. Over large parts of Australia native red-gums are suffering<br />
very greatly from a disease which nobody really knows<br />
what to do about. If they do know what to do about it, the<br />
cost would be something that farmers certainly would not be<br />
able to support at the present time. One of the good things<br />
that has come out of the last five, ten, fifteen years is a<br />
much greater awareness of the need to preserve Australia's<br />
natural environment, of the need to preserve the value of our<br />
soil and of our countryside. We know that this is not<br />
just a question of making sure that the beauty of the landscape<br />
is preserved for future generations, that it does other things<br />
such as improving the quality of air in cities and adds generally<br />
to the quality of Australia and of Australian life.<br />
So there is much to be done. The Decade of the Tree, supported<br />
by the United Nations is something which Australia is involved<br />
in and will be increasingly over the next few years. There is<br />
a much greater awareness that those early farming practices<br />
in case my farming friends attack me for criticising them, they<br />
are practices which I think went out many, many years ago, but<br />
the results of bad practices sometimes flow through long after<br />
the practice has ceased. In more recent years of course, there<br />
are many people who live in the countryside and who have<br />
themselves initiated quite significant tree planting programs<br />
on their own properties. They realise the damage that was<br />
done in earlier times and have as individuals, and sometimes<br />
as communities done a great deal to put the matter right. / 2 </p>
<p>-2-<br />
It is not something that can be left to just individuals.<br />
A national tree planting program I hope very much will be<br />
part of the bicentennial activities and as a pilot program,<br />
some funds have been made available through this year, around<br />
$ 500,000 so that we can work out better what we will want<br />
to be doing as part of the bicentennial program. I would<br />
personally'like to see a situation in which in the two or three<br />
years before the Bicentenary you could have one or more trees<br />
planted for every person in the community. That would be<br />
something which would leave a legacy of great value for future<br />
generations. It would need a great deal of work, it wou. 13<br />
need a great deal of planning because the Australian countryside<br />
is also littered with the examples of local government bodies<br />
having planted avenues of one form or another, but then those<br />
avenues don't come to very much because the tree selection<br />
was not right for the particular soil or the climate or the<br />
8 conditions and mayb2c lbecause care ftcr those trees was not<br />
adequate in the early stages.<br />
So there is much to be done. If there is to be a nzational. treeplanting<br />
program, it is not going to be just a question of<br />
having enough plants available to mn. a sense cover Aust ralia,<br />
people are going to have to know which is the right kind of<br />
tree to plant in their particular area, in their particular<br />
piece of soil or along a particular stretch of road. A great<br />
deal of very careful planning-would need to go into all of<br />
that. The program's objectives are obviously going to b e to pr~ omote<br />
conservation, to promote the regeneration and to promote<br />
tree planting and to increase the public awareness of the<br />
need for trees and to increase the public awareness of the role<br />
that trees themselves play in improving the quality of the<br />
atmosphere and the quality of life in Au-stralia. It is not<br />
just a matter of beauty, it is a practical matter J. n addition.<br />
S A lot is being done. It is being co--ordinated with the Un~ ited<br />
Nations Year of the Tree and a valuabl~ e contribution. is being<br />
made by the United Nations Australia Association and there<br />
is government support for that. There is co-ordination with<br />
the United Nations Australia l~ ssoci-lon. Decade of Trees Greenin~ g<br />
Australia and we do want the whole community to be involved.<br />
There is a Greening Australia Marketing Company designed to<br />
generate funds to help again pursue these objectives in the<br />
few years ahead of us.<br />
The Commonwealth, as I think you know, made $ 500,000 available<br />
through this year for a pilot program as indicated, but to mark<br />
the Decade of the Tree in Australia and I have got a cheque<br />
of $ 55,000 to the United Nations Australia Committee to support<br />
that Committee's efforts in this particula* r objective and<br />
we hope also that there will be private contribution~ s as time<br />
passes. I hope very much over the next two or three years<br />
we will be able to see the initiation of programs which will<br />
if not reverse tree decline in Australia, at least make a<br />
very great contribution to reversing the decline of trees in<br />
Australia. I have very great pleasure indeed in launching<br />
the Greening Australia Marketing Company and in handing over<br />
the cheque for $ 55,000. 000-</p>
