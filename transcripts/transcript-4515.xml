PRIME MINISTER&amp;<br />
FOR PRESS 9 OCTOBER 1977<br />
ELECTORATE TALK<br />
Australia today is back on the road to economic health.<br />
The three years that devastated our country and almost brought<br />
us to our knees -are behind us.<br />
We are pulling out of the mess that went a long way to destroying<br />
city and country, and harming millions.<br />
Australia is back in the race largely because of one ' simple factthe<br />
government recognised that above all else, inflation had<br />
to be beaten. Until that happened, we knew there would be no<br />
proper recovery, no prospect of expanding opportunities for<br />
jobs, no sustained security and not much hope.<br />
We are beating inflation. We have not yet finished the job but<br />
our record so far in reducing inflation is unmatched in the<br />
western world.<br />
Let's look at facts. Inflation as measured by what is<br />
technically called the implicit price deflator was reduced to<br />
just over a 9 percent annual rate through the year to last June.<br />
That is 7 percentage points better than it was through the previous<br />
year. Looked at another way, over the same period and on the<br />
same basis, the percentage reduction in Australia's inflation<br />
was better than that of practically,: all the seven major OECD<br />
countries. Those countries are: Japan, Germany, the United States,<br />
Britain, France, Italy and Canada. In fact, Australia's<br />
performance was matched only by that of Canada.<br />
Inflation of course is commonly measured by an index of consumer<br />
price. We are doing much better with this index too. In the<br />
first half of this year, inflation as measured by the consumer<br />
price index, was also running at an annual rate of around 9 percent.<br />
This is lower than the average increase recorded by our major<br />
trading partners and a far cry from the 17, 18 and 19 percent<br />
levels under Labor. So whichever way you look at it, Australia<br />
is getting on top of inflation.<br />
Australia' s current inflation rate figures are not Liberal Party<br />
figures, not political but figures produced by the OECD and by<br />
Australia's independent statistician. What do they mean for<br />
Australia? / 2 </p>
<p>First, they mean. that our economic strategy a strategy consistently<br />
applied from day one has been the right strategy for Australia<br />
at this time. They mean we are doing the job the community asked<br />
us to do. They mean that we will continue with our policies.<br />
that keep bearing down on inflation. There is no way having<br />
worked so hard and having come this far that we will slacken<br />
in our efforts-to beat inflation. But above all, the reduction<br />
in Australia's rate of inflation means we are ridding the<br />
community of a real and tangible social evil.<br />
Make no mistake about the deadliness of inflation.. Inflation<br />
harms every Australian. It-harms every family, every business,<br />
every farm, every school.. It hits hard and direct at the young,<br />
the old and the defenceless. It is for that reason and for<br />
that reason alone that-my government pledged to beat infaltion.<br />
As we continue with this fight, it is becoming increasingly clear<br />
that key ingredients in the national economy are responding positive]<br />
to our policies. The signs are emerging. There has been a solid<br />
and steady recovery in production. In the last financial year,<br />
production increased by 3. 5 percent. Just two years earlierin<br />
the middle of the Labor experiment production actually<br />
decreased by 0.2 percent. There has been a very good recovery<br />
in company profits. That recovery will continue through this<br />
year.. Consuimers~ too are gaining confidence and are willing to<br />
spend more of their incomes.<br />
In simple terms, in the first quarter of 1977 Australian consumers<br />
were saving 12.5 percent of their pay cheque, while in the last<br />
quarter of 1974, they were saving more than.. 19 percent of their mone,,<br />
What all this means is that Australia is back firmly on the road<br />
to recovery..<br />
We-all know, however, that not everything is as it should be or as<br />
the government wants. Unemployment, although slightly improving<br />
over the last couple of months, remains too high. The Government<br />
knows this. That is why-we have developed a number of programmes<br />
that either have helped or are currently helping more than 100,000<br />
young men and women. We have removed all financial restrictions<br />
on the various training programmes and employment assistance<br />
programmes. No-one will be denied training opportunities because<br />
of lack of finance. These however, are essentially short term<br />
measures, short term assistance for the unemployed.<br />
It is only when inflation is further reduced, and when production an<br />
profits further improve that business and industry will seek to<br />
increase its workforce. For a long term and sustained reduction<br />
in unemployment, there is no alternative but to keep the battle<br />
against inflation-at full pitch.<br />
We must never forget what happened to jobs, to business, to farmers,<br />
to migrants, to fixed income earners when Labor refused to face<br />
reality, when Labor refused to accept what inflation was doing to<br />
Australia. We must never forget what happened to Australia.<br />
We could never survive that kind of experiment again. </p>
