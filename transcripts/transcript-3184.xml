SPEECHI BY THE PRI IE MINISTER, [ iR. E. G. WIPITLA:!,<br />
AT THE OPENING OF THE KAISER STUHL ' IIERY CIATEAU, ' URIOPTA<br />
SOUTH AUSTRALIA, FRIflAY 9 11ARCi 1974<br />
JNE OF THE MOST NOTICEABLE CHANGES IN AUSTRALIAN<br />
LIVING IN THE LAST DECADE OR SO HAS 3EEN THE GREAT AND<br />
GROWING POPULARITY OF WINE. IT HAS COME HAND-IN-HAND<br />
WITH A TRANSFORMATION OF OUR EATING HABITS. ARE NO<br />
LONGER A NATION OF PEOPLE WHO EAT STEAK, EGGS AND CHIPS,<br />
WASHED DOWN WITH BEER. MANY AUSTRALIANS ARE NOW AS<br />
LIKELY TO BE FOUND EATING VEAL MARSALA, ACCOMPANIED BY<br />
A RIESLING, OR BOEUF AU POIVRE WITH A BOTTLE OF CABERNET<br />
SHIRAZ. IT IS ONE OF THE SMALL DISADVANTAGES OF MY<br />
DUTIES THAT I AM NOT ABLE TO SHARE THE FULL FRUITS OF<br />
THIS TRANSFORMATION, A SYBARITIC LIFE, IT SEEMS, IS NOT<br />
POSSIBLE FOR THOSE IN HIGH OFFICE.<br />
IT IS FITTING IN THE IAROSSA VALLEY TO PAY TRIBUTE<br />
TO THE TWO QUITE DISTINCT GENERATIONS OF NEW SETTLERS WHO<br />
HAVE PLAYED SUCH AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN THIS DEVELOPMENT.<br />
GERMAN REFUGEES ESCAPING FROM RELIGIOUS PERSECUTION<br />
FOUNDED THE FIRST PROFITABLE WINERIES IN SOUTH AUSTRALIA<br />
AND THEIR DESCENDENTS HAVE CONTINUED AND EXPANDED THEIR<br />
ACTIVITIES SINCE THEN. THE NAME KAISER STUHliL ALONE<br />
SYMBOLISES THE EFFORTS OF THE MIGRANTS FROM PRUSSIA AND<br />
SILESIA WHO WERE THE FIRST SETTLERS IN THIS VALLEY IN 1842. </p>
<p>IT WAS A LATER GENERATION OF MIGRANTS WHO DID SO MUCH<br />
TO MAKE AUSTRALIANS APPRECIATE THEIR OWN WINES.<br />
SOME OF THOSE MIGRANTS, TOO, WERE ESCAPING RELIGIOUS<br />
PERSECUTION INDEED, THE MOST FEARSOME PERSECUTION THE<br />
WORLD HAS EVER SEEN, OTHERS WERE SEEKING A NEW LIFE<br />
AFTER THE RAVAGES OF WORLD WAR I. THEY BROUGHT WITH<br />
THEM A NEW AND DIVERSE STYLE OF LIVING WHICH HAS CHANGED<br />
IRREVOCAIBLY THE HABITS OF ALL AUSTRALIANS.<br />
THIE CURRENT SOOM IN WINE, W,-IHICH IS ONE OF THE<br />
BENEFITS OF THE INFLUENCE OF THESE TWO SEPARATE<br />
GENERATIONS, FOLLOWS A LONG PUT UNCERTAIN HISTORY FOR<br />
THE INDUSTRY. THE FIRST FEEBLE VINEYARD IN AUSTRALIA<br />
WAS PLANTED BY CAPTAIN ARTHUR PHILLIP SOON AFTER THE<br />
ARRIVAL OF THE FIRST FLEET IN 1788, IT WAS NOT UNTIL<br />
YEARS AFTER THIS INITIAL FAILURE THAT GREGORY PLAXLAND<br />
PRODUCED A VINTAGE AND SHIPPED A 30 GALLON CASK OF h4INE<br />
TO LONDON. IN THE ENSUING FEW YEARS WINE MAKING WAS<br />
CARRIED ON BY OTHER SETTLERS. ONE WRITER HAS, HOWEVER,<br />
REMARKED THAT IN THOSE VERY EARLY DAYS VITICULTURE AND<br />
WINE MAKING 1WERE EXCLUSIVELY THE HOBBY OF LANDED,<br />
EDUCATED ENGLISH COLONISTS WHO HAD ACQUIRED A TASTE FOR<br />
WINE OF THE CONTINENTAL STYLES':, :' PRODABLY THE WINE THEY<br />
MADE WAS POOR STUFF,' THE WRITER HAS REMARKED RATHER<br />
GRUFFLY, NEVERTHELESS, THE INDUSTRY GRADUALLY SPREAD<br />
IN NEW SOUTH WALES, VICTORIA, WESTERN AUSTRALIA AND SOUTH<br />
AUSTRALIA, </p>
<p>Tin LSTH CENTURY HAD NOT ENDED, HOW'. EVER, BEFORE<br />
THE INDUJSTRYI STRUCK PRODLEMS. ITS REPUTATION SUJFFERED<br />
GREAT DAMAGE BECAUSE OF THE BOOM IN CHEAP, FORTIFIED WINES<br />
ON THE GOLD DIGGINGS. THEN THE WINE DISEASE, PHYLLOXERA<br />
VASTATRIX, SPREAD THROUGHOUJT VICTORIA AND PARTS OF NEW<br />
SOUTH WALES. LIE SECOND PROBLEM WAS SOLVED. THE FIRST<br />
CONTINUED, IN DIFFERENT FORMS, FOR SOME TIME. TIE LACK<br />
OF PROPER EXPORT QUJALITY CONTROLS AND ' BAD BLENDING WITH<br />
INFERIOR WINE FROM OTHER PARTS OF THE THEN EMPIRE GREATLY<br />
HARMED THE REPUTATION OF AUSTRALIAN WINE. IRONICALLY, IT<br />
WAS THlE SECOND WORLD WAR NHICH GAVE NEW nEART TO OUR<br />
WINEMAKERS. THE SHORTAGE OF OTHER LIQUOR LED TO AN<br />
ALMOST THREE-FOLD INCREASE IN THE DOMESTIC CONSUMPTION<br />
OF WINE. THE REAL BREAKTHROUGH, HOWEVER, CAME IN THE<br />
1950S AND 1960lS. A. T LONG LAST AUSTRALIAN WINES WERE<br />
ACCEPTED BY A GROW1ING NUM' 3ER OF AUSTRALIANS FOR THEIR TRUE<br />
WORTH. AUSTRALIANS ARE NOW DRINKING MORE THAN TWO GALLONS<br />
OF WINE PER HEAD EVERY YEAR, THE INDUSTRY HAS BEEN OF<br />
PARTICULAR IMPORTANCE TO SOUTH AUSTRALIA. MORE THAN<br />
TWO-THIRDS OF ALL AUSTRALIAN WINE IS GROWN IN THIS STATE<br />
AND THIS HAS BEEN A SIGNIFICANT FACTOR IN THE ECONOMY OF<br />
A NUJMBER OF REGIONS, SUCH AS THIS AREA.<br />
-j-</p>
<p>WHILE THE INDUSTRY IS GENERALLY BUOYANT AT PRESENT,<br />
THE GOVERNMENT RECOGNISES THAT SOME PROBLEMS DO EXIST.<br />
A TARIFF B3OARD REPORT ON BRANDY IN AUGUST LAST YEAR DREW<br />
ATTENTION TO THE PROBLEM OF THE OVER-SUPPLY OF BRANDY,<br />
TO WHICH MANY GROWERS LOOK AS A MEANS OF USING SURPLUS<br />
GRAPES. THE MINISTER FOR PRIMARY INDUSTRY, SENATOR WRIEDT,<br />
AND THE MINISTER FOR SECONDARY INDUSTRY, MR. ENDERBY, HAVE<br />
ESTABLISHED A BODY TO REPORT TO THEM ON THE MEANS OF<br />
ABSORBING GRAPE SURPLUSES ARISING E2EFORE ANY LONGER TERM<br />
RESTRUCTURING OR ADJUSTMENT PROGRAMS CAN BE IMPLEMENTED.<br />
WE EXPECT TO BE ABLE TO CONSIDER THIS REPORT VERY SOON.<br />
IN DEALING WITH THOSE AND ANY OTHER PROBLEMS WHICH MIGHT<br />
EXIST IN THE INDUSTRY, THE GOVERNMENT WILL BE GUIDED BY<br />
THE PRINCV'-LE IT WISHES TO APPLY TO ALL PRIMARY INDUSTRIES:<br />
THAT THEY BE SELF-SUJFFICIENT, PROSPEROUS AND EFFICIENT.<br />
AGAINST THE GENERAL BACKGROUND WHICH I HAVE DESCRIBED,<br />
THE BAROSSA CO-OPERATIVE WINERY LIMITED HAS BEEN ONE OF THE<br />
SUCCESS STORIES OF THE AUSTRALIAN WINE INDUSTRY. IT CAME<br />
INTO BEING IN 1931 WNHEN THE GROWERS IN THE VALLEY POOLED<br />
THEIR RESOURCES TO MAKE W INE DURING THE DEPRESSION. SINCE<br />
1953, WHEN THE KAISER STIJllL LABEL NAMED AFTER THE FLAT--<br />
TOPPED HILL OVERLOOKING THE BAROSSA V! ALLEY WAS FIRST<br />
USED, THE CO-OPERATIVE HAS PURSUED A VIGOROUS MARKETING<br />
POLICY. IN ADDITION TO QUALITY BOTTLES OF WINE, IT HAS<br />
SUCCESSFULLY MARKETED FLAGON AND OTHER POPULAR WINES. </p>
<p>ONE OF ITS MOST ENCOURAGING ENDEAVOURS HAS BEEN IN<br />
THE FIELD OF EXPORTS, LIE CO-OPERATIVE HAS A FULLTIME<br />
EXPORT MARKETING DIRECTOR AND IS, I UNDERSTAND, NOW THE<br />
LEADING EXPORTER OF AUSTRALIAN WIPES TO THE UNITED STATES<br />
AND JAPAN, ITS WINES ' 30 TO MORE THAN 20 OVERSEAS MARKETS.<br />
~ JUSTIFIABLY IT WAS ANARDED A NATIONAL EXPORT A\ WARD FOR<br />
OUTSTANDING EXPORT ACHIEVEMENT IN 1973. 1 HOPE THAT ITS<br />
WORK IN THIS FIELD IS TAKEN AS A LEAD BY OTHER AUSTRALIAN<br />
WINEMAKERS. CERTAINLY THE AUJSTRALIAN DEPARTMENT OF PRIMARY<br />
INDUSTRY AND TUlE DEPARTMENT OF OVERSEAS TRADE STAND READY<br />
TO ASSIST IN ANY W~ ORTHWHILE ATTEMPTS TO EXPAND OUR OVERSEAS<br />
MARKETS. ON A PERSONAL NOTE, I AM ALSO DELIGHTED AT ANOTHER<br />
INNOVATION OF THE CO-OPERATIVE. YOU HAVE INVITED ME TO<br />
BE THE FIRST MEMBER OF " CLU3 13" WHICH WILL ENABLE SELECTED<br />
WINES TO BE LAID DOWN IN THE KAISER STUML CELLARS FOR<br />
NOMINATED PERSONS. I HAVE HAPPILY NOMINATED MY GRANDSON,<br />
ALEXANDER, TO BE THE RECIPIENT OF SOME PORT WHEN HE REACHES<br />
HIS 13TH BIRTHDAY. THIS W'ILL SERVE AS A MATURED MEMORY OF<br />
THE OPENING OF THE NEW KAISER STUHL WINERY CHATEAU D3Y ME<br />
TODAY. </p>
