TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON PAUL J KEATING MP<br />
ABC RADIO 27 FEBRUARY 1992<br />
E OE PROOF ONLY<br />
McKEW: Mr-Keating, you've given us $ 2 billion in goodies. Have you suddenly<br />
become Mr Yes. You used to be Mr No?<br />
KEATING: I was Mr No when the private economy was so strong, the only sensible<br />
thing to do was withdraw public spending and any public stimulus. But now the private<br />
economy is so weak-and investment is so weak, the sensible thing is to lift public spending and<br />
public capital works.<br />
McKEW: We had two statements last year: a March industry statement and a job<br />
statement in Novembe-r. On both occasions we were told that recovery was on the way, these<br />
statements would boost confidence. Now, that didn't happen. Why is this statement different?<br />
KEATING: It's got larger fiscal effects, and it's also got, I think, confidence-bearing<br />
effects. Given that a lot of the funding is going to go in long-term infrastructure, in building<br />
a national rail highway, in connecting the ports of the rail system, building roads, highways and<br />
ring roads around capital cities. This is all basic infrastructure for Australia which Australia<br />
now, as a trading country, desperately needs.<br />
McKEW: But is business finally going to get the message: to start investing itself?<br />
KEATING: There is a landmark change to depreciation in the package. It allows<br />
business to write-off plant and equipment more rapidly. For instance, an item of plant and<br />
equipment with 20-year life can now be written off over seven and a half years. Or a<br />
life over 15 years. It gives business a cost of capital regime, a depr-eciation rate competitive<br />
with any country you'd like to compare us with.<br />
McKEW: Yoa made the point in the Parliament the other day that a lot of the<br />
investment in the ' 80s. was frittered away. Where is the guarantee this time around that the </p>
<p>investment goes into the right places?<br />
KEATING: Because we don't have a global financial market spreading credit around at<br />
per cent a year. The fact of the matter is that banks will be more abstemious with credit.<br />
McKEW: Are you sure about that?<br />
KEATING: Well, they are. They've taken the loss. They've taken the hit. The fact is<br />
though, that businesses now are changing their spending equity in these areas, and if they do<br />
we'll reward them with a very, I think, efficient depreciation schedule and a better cost of<br />
capital regime. What we've got here is a partnership of Government and business together.<br />
Government spending at a time when private spending is low, using a fiscal situation which<br />
it took this Government 8 years of painstaking work to put together. We didn't do as the US<br />
did, and that is not take the big budget deficits back in the good times, we took them to a<br />
strong surpluses. That now gives us the capacity to be able to spend Government money. It<br />
is, after all, only about half a per cent of GDP. I mean, it's not extravagant, but it's sensible<br />
and it's well directed and it's in time.<br />
McKEW: What is ambitious is your forecast for growth: 4.75 per cent by the middle<br />
of next year. How is that going to happen with the recovery so sluggish?<br />
KEATING: I don't think that's ambitious at this stage. After the 1982/ 83 recession,<br />
after John Howard and John Hewson's recession, the first year of recovery we had growth<br />
running at about 6 per-cent or better. 4.75 per cent coming off this economy, the fundamentals<br />
of which are much better: low inflation, a much better budgetary situation where we are seeing<br />
a turnaround in the drought, an improvement in international prices, a change in the stock<br />
cycle, 4.75 per cent is; I think a reasonably conservative estimate.<br />
McKEW: Whiat we're not seeing though is any improvement in the global economy.<br />
If we were to race ahead with that level of growth, wouldn't that cause us problems with a<br />
sluggish global economy?<br />
KEATING: We're not racing ahead. Also, as we pick up, so will they. They'll pick<br />
up over time. But it's worth recording that the recession in Australia is met with the recession<br />
in the US, Canada, Britain and France and the recession in those countries is deeper and the<br />
malaise is greater than Australia.<br />
McKEW: Indeed, you would have heard Alan Greenspan's point in the last 24 hours<br />
or so. He's talked about a very faltering recovery in the US?<br />
KEATING: You can't have the sort of roaring ' 80s, the financial blow-out at 20 per cent<br />
credit growth a year, displacing equity with debt all over the place, with banks lending as they<br />
were; and when it collapses, when asset price inflation collapses to come out the other side sort<br />
of dancing along without any cut in GDP, without any recession. It was not likely to happen.<br />
The thing to do was to get out of it, to get back to recovery. What we have come up with is<br />
a 4-year plan to get us out of recession and into recovery, but built on improving our long-term<br />
infrastructure for our trading future, and at the same time offering tax cuts which take the tax<br />
rate to 30 per cent without Dr Hewson's 15 per cent string attached without the </p>
<p>consumption tax, while at the same time bringing the budget back to surplus.<br />
McKEW: MT Keating you've talked about one nation. Could I put it lo you that it's<br />
really a divided nation? Ten per cent who are unemployed and the rest who have jobs?<br />
KEATING: Nothing like as divided as it would be with the consumption tax, where the<br />
people on low incomes spend it all, so whether you tax their income or the expenditure is<br />
immaterial, it's all one and the same. And where at the top end of the income system, where<br />
they spend only some of their income, they not only don't wear the burden of the consumption<br />
tax, but they get a tax. cut as well. That's the sort of division that will break Australia up, or<br />
where the Liberal Party tries to wipe out trade unions. This is not what we're about. We're<br />
about a partnership with business. There is no depreciation schedule like this in the Fightback<br />
program. They are in fact going to put the company tax rate up to 42 per cent. There is no<br />
partnership with business there. In fact Dr Hewson said I shouldn't have been talking to<br />
business. He said they were only asking for handouts. There was no discussion with unions<br />
about keeping the inflation rate low. Dr Hewson wants to blast it back towards 10 per cent.<br />
So that's the sort of division. We call this One Nation, because we're pulling Australia back<br />
together again, in a cohesive fight against the recession, back into recovery, using all of these<br />
various areas of the community to come together.<br />
McKEW: But over the next year or more, there's a whole group of people who will<br />
be left out? Your forecasts say that we'll still have 10-10.5 per cent unemployment in the<br />
middle of next year. If that's the case, electorally you're done in, aren't you?<br />
KEATING: No. We're saying 10 per cent providing the direction is right, providing the<br />
direction changes. We've got to stabilise unemployment and bring it down. It's the direction<br />
which matters.<br />
McKEW: 800,000 jobs. When will we see them?<br />
KEATING: You will see them over the forecast period. As you saw over the first four<br />
years of our Government, something like about 800,000 from memory. With these sorts of<br />
growth rates, which Australia can afford, we can basically bring unemployment down.<br />
Employment is entirely sensitive to product, the growth in the economy, the GDP. GDP is up,<br />
employment is up.<br />
McKEW: Aren't you asking people to have a lot of faith, though? You are basicaL~ y<br />
saying re-elect us, say about May next year and the recovery will come later. They have been<br />
hearing this for a long time, haven't they?<br />
KEATING: That's why we've got spending going to families in April this year. That's<br />
why we've got the rail, road and other infrastructure programs beginning as quickly as possible<br />
to get that spending going, so we get out of this recession as quickly as we can.<br />
McKEW: Why not more assistance to specific industries to help promote value-added<br />
production? KEATING: KWEAeT'IvNeG : got a number of quite innovative tax measures here. We've got a </p>
<p>tax measure for pooled development funds that provide funds for small and medium business,<br />
that can't get equity on the stockmarkets. They just can't get equity privately. As well as that,<br />
we've got a proposal for pre-start industrial arrangements, for large investments which put<br />
together large mineral projects or large resource projects, there is a development or investment<br />
allowance available b4-yond the depreciation rates to encourage them to do that. There is a tax<br />
provision for private provision of public infrastructure. So we will see in the future, private<br />
provision of roads, rail, ports, electricity generation. They are the sort of things that will make<br />
Australia stronger, and one of which actually rewards winners. If you get your major project<br />
together, you get an investment allowance. So rather than picking winners, we are rewarding<br />
winners. McKEW: You have attempted to diminish the Hewson Fightback package as nothing<br />
more than an exercise in accountancy, as you've called it. But when that package was<br />
released, it was seen aLs being very impressive in its boldness and in its scope.<br />
KEATING: By whom, though?<br />
McKEW: I think it was general acclaim.<br />
KEATING: It's. basically a very nasty tax camouflaged, wrapped with a. whole lot of<br />
changes. As you take the changes away, what's left underneath is a rapacious 15 per cent<br />
consumption tax which will raise $ 28 billion. Dr Hewson proposes to give back only a small<br />
proportion of that $ 9 billion in tax cuts.<br />
McKiEW: Mr Keating, I haven't heard anyone as yet describe your package as bold<br />
and sweeping?<br />
KEATING: Well, if you don't think rebuilding the rail highway of Australia isn't bold.<br />
If you don't think opening up the airlines for the first time ever, from the Liberal's two-airline<br />
policy, to let the domestics fly internationally and Qantas fly domestically is not bold, I don't<br />
know what is. If you don't call taking over technical and further education like we took over<br />
universities, to change for our children, to give them an opportunity, bold, I don't know what<br />
is. But if you think it's bold to tax the food you put in your mouth and the shirt you put on<br />
your back, well good ( in you Maxine, if you think that's bold, then you've got a very different<br />
definition of bold than I have.<br />
McKEW: You'd argue then, there's now a much clearer ideological divide between<br />
yourself and the Opposition?<br />
KEATING: Look, Dr Hewson had an opportunity as Opposition leader to stand back and<br />
say, what should I do for Australia? What he stood back and said is what can I do to be<br />
different to Labor? Oh they won't have a consumption tax, I'll have one. That's where he<br />
started. Where we started is we sat back again and said what can we do now? We've made<br />
the big changes to macr~ o economy, let's keep pushing the micro economy in rail, road, ports,<br />
airlines, electricity generation, TAFE, training, it's Labor doing the usual reforms. It's alway's<br />
us doing the big changes. What's he about? Instead of sitting back saying well I can use my<br />
opportunity to make Australia better, oh no, I'll be different, I'll have a consumption tax. I'll<br />
tax the low-paid and give a tax cut to the high-paid. Well, big deal! As I said some time ago, </p>
<p>it was a tenth-order issue. The first-order issue is jobs, recovery, growth, efficiency, the micro<br />
changes, getting a container between Sydney and Melbourne, crossing the ports, being able to<br />
run a decent tourism industry by flying in and out of Australia, training our kids. They are the<br />
first-order issues, not whether you tax income or expenditure.<br />
McKEW: Things are getting pretty personal between you and John Hewson, aren't<br />
they? KEATING: Not with me. But you can't dare criticise him without him calling me. a<br />
cheat, a liar, a distorter. He's very nasty. He's had such a dream ride for a couple of months,<br />
if you dare criticise any of his things, he reverts to this sort of language, this sort of nastiness.<br />
Now, he camne into the House yesterday with a censure motion of all things, because I dared,<br />
he said, misquote the econometrician who put the modelling together for his GST package.<br />
McKEW: He says you've got your facts wrong?<br />
KEATING: I didn't. I produced the computer print-out of Dr Murphy's model which<br />
showed that Dr Hewson's package actually reduces GDP, actually increases unemployment and<br />
inflation in the 3 scertarios in the model. I gave him the computer print-out. The fact of the<br />
matter is, here it is after labouring so long, his own econometrician says that Fightback actually<br />
reduces GDP, increases unemployment and increases inflation. There is nothing more damning,<br />
and I can understand why he was so hurt. But I can't understand him. He's so sensitive. He's<br />
such a delicate little petal. He had to get in there with a censure motion of all things because<br />
I misrepresented his econometrician. Tut, tut, naughty me. I won't do it again.<br />
McKEW: John Hewson also, the other day, tried to suggest that you had no class,<br />
because as he saw it, you were disrespectful towards the Queen. If he keeps that sont of thing<br />
up, will that rattle you?<br />
KEATING: That was just devastating. It really devastated me, that little comment.<br />
McKEW: But you see what he's trying to do? He said well, we both come from the<br />
same sort of backgrounds, but I have respect. Paul Keating doesn't?<br />
KEATING: He has respect for old traditions but no regard for Australia. No respect for<br />
Australia. McKEW: How can you say that?<br />
KEATING: If lie believes that I cannot say that this is a more independent country, that<br />
we're not tied to Britain's coat-tails, and I say it to the Queen of Australia not the Queen of<br />
Great Britain, as The Age pointed out. If he thinks that we ought to be basically into British<br />
boot-strapping, forelock tugging, and he calls that respect, it's not respect for this country.<br />
McKEW: I think he was talking about being respectful towards the Queen?<br />
KEATING: I was. I said that Australia had changed from a country the Age said<br />
it, in fact I've got the editorial here, it said this: " when the Prime Minister addresses the </p>
<p>Queen, he addresses her as the Queen of Australia, and it is entirely appropriate for him to<br />
articulate independent Australian attitudes." She's part of our change. She took the royal style<br />
and title of Queen of Australia in 1973. She's part of that independence. She is not here as<br />
Queen of Great Britain. But John Howard is talking about going back to 1950s. The fact is,<br />
if we develop a constitutional museum in Parliament House, John Howard and John Hewson<br />
ought to be the first two exhibits. Back down the time tunnel to the ' 50s to forelock tugging<br />
and British boot-strapping and all that nonsense. Apparently we had some House of Lords<br />
character on " AM" saying if they cut their ties with Britain, Australia will give up all of their<br />
cultural inheritance. Well, Hewson and Howard believe that stuff.<br />
McKEW: What about the British press? They sound as if they want to lynch you?<br />
KEATING: As I said, when you look at a British tabloid editor, it's a particularly lowform<br />
of human life, a British tabloid editor. So let's take no notice of them.<br />
