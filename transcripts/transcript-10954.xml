<p>To you Robert and to Ron Spithill, to all the other very distinguished</p>
<p>   business guests, ladies and gentlemen. It is a great delight to</p>
<p>   share this occasion with you tonight. </p>
<p>And Robert spoke of some of the things that we do well in this</p>
<p>   country. And I thought tonight that we were, at long last, starting</p>
<p>   to get things into proper balance because last night I had the great</p>
<p>   pleasure of attending the annual dinner of the Sports Hall of Fame</p>
<p>   at the Crown Casino in Melbourne. And this is a great event and</p>
<p>   every year they make an award or, in fact, inaugurated a new award</p>
<p>   last night, the Sir Donald Bradman award for the outstanding sports</p>
<p>   performance and it was jointly won last night by Heather Turland</p>
<p>   and Mark Taylor. And they also inducted into the Hall of Fame, as</p>
<p>   a new sporting legend, that great tennis player, Margaret Court.</p>
<p>   And I thought what a tremendous characteristic it was of Australians</p>
<p>   to properly honour the men and women who brought such sporting pride</p>
<p>   and pleasure to us and to our nation.</p>
<p>I think tonight we are quite appropriately in a different city</p>
<p>   but in an equally impressive way we are honouring business achievement.</p>
<p>   And for a long time we haven't really done that as well as</p>
<p>   we should have done. And I do think BRW and Alcatel deserve our</p>
<p>   praise and our compliment for the fact that they are leading the</p>
<p>   way in honouring the great achievers in Australian business because</p>
<p>   we do need to treat them like sporting heroes. And I say that as</p>
<p>   a passionate follower of Australian sporting achievement and a passionate</p>
<p>   supporter of particular sports in Australia but then Prime Ministers</p>
<p>   are meant to support all sports, and I do.</p>
<p>But, ladies and gentlemen, it is very important that we honour</p>
<p>   excellence in Australian business. And we have a gathering here</p>
<p>   tonight at an extraordinarily interesting time for the Australian</p>
<p>   economy. I've just come back from a meeting of leaders of the</p>
<p>   APEC nations in Kuala Lumpur and the strongest impression that I</p>
<p>   took away from that meeting was the new respect and the new esteem</p>
<p>   in which Australia is held at the present time by dint of her economic</p>
<p>   strength and some of the achievements and some of the qualities</p>
<p>   of Australia and Australians that have shone through in the recent</p>
<p>   Asian Pacific economic difficulties.</p>
<p>One of the things that I think the economic downturn in Asia has</p>
<p>   done is to demonstrate, in a quite emphatic way, the strengths of</p>
<p>   this country. What could be a more attractive conjunction of circumstances</p>
<p>   to have a low inflation, low interest rate, might I, I hope, not</p>
<p>   too immodestly say, a well-run economy, to have a stable banking</p>
<p>   system, a transparent banking system, to have a very stable political</p>
<p>   system and to have a congenial lifestyle and to have, amongst our</p>
<p>   population, hundreds of thousands of Australian citizens who have</p>
<p>   very close cultural family and personal links with the nations of</p>
<p>   the Asian Pacific region.</p>
<p>Now, when you add all of those things up, that is a remarkably</p>
<p>   potent mix and it's a remarkably attractive mix to people who</p>
<p>   are looking for some kind of oasis of stability and predictability.</p>
<p>   And some of those things that perhaps a few years ago some may have</p>
<p>   regarded as irksome, unnecessary, perhaps not adventurous enough,</p>
<p>   are suddenly the credentials that make this an appealing country</p>
<p>   - the transparency of our banking system, for example. And we have</p>
<p>   a world-class financial system now. And when the benefits of the</p>
<p>   changes in the taxation reform flow through, particularly in relation</p>
<p>   to the removal of financial institutions duties and bank account</p>
<p>   debits tax and the removal of stamp duty on share transactions,</p>
<p>   it will become an even more attractive place as a financial centre</p>
<p>   in this part of the world.</p>
<p>So what I think one of the...that the Asian crisis has done</p>
<p>   is to highlight again the tremendous strengths. And I was saying</p>
<p>   to Ron earlier over dinner that one of the many endearing things</p>
<p>   about Australians Â and he, as somebody in the forefront of</p>
<p>   information technology, finds it particularly endearing Â and</p>
<p>   that is that we've always been great devourers and rapid devourers</p>
<p>   of new technology. And it is one of the characteristics of Australians.</p>
<p>   And that is also something that is standing us in tremendously good</p>
<p>   stead in present circumstances.</p>
<p>I think the Australian economy has done better than just about</p>
<p>   anybody in this room expected. I have to confess there were occasions</p>
<p>   earlier this year when I thought it would slow down a little more</p>
<p>   than it has but, overall, it has performed very well. And all of</p>
<p>   the indicators coming to us are very positive and are very strong.</p>
<p>   And it is a fact that we are probably enjoying about as great a</p>
<p>   period of economic stability and strength and attractiveness that</p>
<p>   I can remember in the 24 years that I've been in Parliament.</p>
<p>I entered Parliament in 1974 when there was a period when the world</p>
<p>   was beginning to change very rapidly. And the manufacturers will</p>
<p>   nod their heads in particular. And it was at a time when all the</p>
<p>   constance and all the verities of that long period of economic stability</p>
<p>   after the end of World War II was seeming to come to an end. Now,</p>
<p>   we haven't gone back. We've gone to a new period of opportunity.</p>
<p>   And the world is very different and it's forever different</p>
<p>   from what it was 25 years ago but we do have now some strengths</p>
<p>   and we have a tremendous opportunity. And I am really tremendously</p>
<p>   excited that I've got the privilege of being Prime Minister</p>
<p>   of this country on the cusp of all these great events that we're</p>
<p>   going to celebrate - our centenary as a federation, the coming of</p>
<p>   the Olympic Games to Australia and the opportunities that this very</p>
<p>   strong country, economically and politically in our part of the</p>
<p>   world, now has. </p>
<p>The fact that we are seen in the region as having the endowments</p>
<p>   of a western country without some of the encumbrances, perhaps of</p>
<p>   our North American friends and some of our European friends, in</p>
<p>   dealing with the countries of the region. We've sort of got</p>
<p>   all the advantages without any of the disadvantages of our history</p>
<p>   and of our culture and here we are in this part of the world and</p>
<p>   we can be a very special intersection of culture and of economic</p>
<p>   opportunity and of political history.</p>
<p>One of the messages that comes out of the last year is that the</p>
<p>   process of reform is never-ended. Those who argue that having done</p>
<p>   something about the industrial relations system, having essentially</p>
<p>   removed many of the tariff barriers that Australia used to have,</p>
<p>   having brought about further financial sector reforms and ultimately</p>
<p>   when the taxation is reformed that that will be the end of it. That,</p>
<p>   of course, is wrong. There's never an end to economic reform</p>
<p>   because new challenges come along which invite you to make further</p>
<p>   changes.</p>
<p>So, ladies and gentlemen, all of this adds up to a time and a community</p>
<p>   that needs business achievers. It does need risk-takers. It does</p>
<p>   need people who excel. It does need a nation that sees its men and</p>
<p>   women of business excellence as being equally important to our country</p>
<p>   as our great sports men and women. And tonight is a tribute to those</p>
<p>   people and tonight is a reminder to all of us, to those in government,</p>
<p>   not only of the inadequacy of the capital gains tax system but also</p>
<p>   it's a reminder to us of just how important it is to have business</p>
<p>   heroes and business achievers and just how important it is to the</p>
<p>   future of our country that we have people who are world-class performers</p>
<p>   in business. </p>
<p>So I am delighted to be here tonight. I do compliment the sponsors</p>
<p>   of tonight's gathering. I congratulate, in advance, those who</p>
<p>   will be announced as winners and I thank all of you for the support</p>
<p>   that you're giving to an occasion that is very important to</p>
<p>   the future of our country as we go into the 21st Century.</p>
<p>   Thank you.</p>
