PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF DOORSTOP, SHANGRI-LA HOTEL, KUALA LUMPUR,<br />
18 OCTOBER 1989<br />
E 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, what went wrong? I thought we<br />
had the numbers.<br />
PM: I thought we did too. I think it's one of these cases<br />
that happens in ballots sometimes. But I think people, you<br />
know, weren't absolutely exact in what they indicated their<br />
voting intentions might be but I don't know with certainty<br />
the numbers because they weren't announced but I think that<br />
it only required a switch of just a very few votes. So it<br />
was quite a close result. But let me say this, we tried our<br />
best to get Mr Fraser up because I sincerely believe that we<br />
had a case of two good candidates but that Mr Fraser would be<br />
better placed to use influence in the non-Commonwealth<br />
countries on the issue of South Africa and that was the<br />
reason why I strongly supported him. But I've said from the<br />
beginning there were two good candidates. When the decision<br />
was announced I went straight around and saw Chief Anyaoku<br />
and congratulated him, said he would have the complete<br />
support of Australia.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Palmer, the New Zealand Prime Minister, seems<br />
to have taken a particular delight in complaining about<br />
Australia's as he puts it heavy-handed lobbying and<br />
working against us. How much do you blame him for what<br />
happened tonight?<br />
PM: I'm not attributing any blame at all to Mr Palm * er. It's<br />
a free society and he's entitled to his judgement, he's<br />
exercised it and do the analysis he wants to. I think as<br />
Chief Anyaoku said to me when I went around and congratulated<br />
him he said I want to say to you, Mr Prime Minister, you<br />
conducted a very, very, clean and fair campaign, and we did.<br />
JOURNALIST: Have you spoken to Mr Fraser? </p>
<p>-2-<br />
PM: Yes I have and he'll be available to come down and talk<br />
to you shortly, I would think. He's naturally disappointed.<br />
I believe that he felt and in my judgement rightly felt<br />
that he could do a good job, he wanted to do that but that's<br />
over now, we tried our best to get him up, we couldn't do<br />
that and we now have a good new Secretary General-elect and<br />
as I've said he'll have Australia's complete support.<br />
JOURNALIST: What sort of a role do you see Mr Fraser<br />
undertaking from now on?<br />
PM: Well I don't know. He'll be here in a minute. You can<br />
ask him that. I think if you wait he'll come down.<br />
ends </p>
