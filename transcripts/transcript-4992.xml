PRI] ME, MINISTER<br />
FOR PRESS 18 MARCH 1979<br />
ELECTORATE TALK<br />
Governments around the world are wrestling with energy problems.<br />
These problems relate to both the cost and the supply of energy<br />
resources. Events in Iran with resultant disruption in the world's oil<br />
supplies have focussed international attention on these major<br />
issues. Australia is fortunate to have a strong and growing energy<br />
resources base.<br />
We are now about 70% self-sufficient in crude oil; we have<br />
extensive resources of coal suitable for power generation for<br />
industry use and for export; we have substantial reserves of<br />
natural gas; hydro-electric power makes a notable contribution<br />
to cur energy resources and our reserves of uranium rank with<br />
the largest suppliers in the world.<br />
These resources create opportunities for economic development<br />
and for continuing improvement in our standards of living.<br />
However, in an energy short world, we also have an obligation<br />
to make sure we make wise and creative use of our energy resources.<br />
Domestically, we have a firmly established energy policy. We have<br />
encouraged the search for oil and the efficient development and<br />
use of our existing reserves.<br />
There is no choice but for Australia to adopt sensible pricing<br />
pclicies. That difficult decision had to be taken. Our crude<br />
oil pricing policies and taxation and investment incentives have<br />
resuIted in Australia's oil reserves being upgraded by some<br />
600-700 million barrels, approximately a further three years'<br />
supply at current consumption levels.<br />
The growth of oil exploration activity will continue in 1979.<br />
Industry est'. mates that between 83 and something over 140 exploration<br />
wells could be drilled this year. Even the lower end of the<br />
estimate 83 wells would be the best result for seven years.<br />
Esso and BHP alone are committed to investing over $ 1 billion<br />
in exploration and development over th1e next five years as a<br />
result of our energy policies. J2 </p>
<p>2<br />
Overall, by 1985, it is estimated that about 30 percent of Australia's<br />
crude oil production will be derived from oil fields which have<br />
become viable as a consequence of our oil and gas policies. This<br />
revival of exploration activity is of vital importance if we are<br />
to maintain a satisfactory level of self-sufficiency in oil into<br />
the 1980' s and beyond.<br />
I recentlv announced that Australia will become a member of the<br />
Inter_-a: ional Energy Agency. This organisation which operates<br />
within the frame-work of the OECD, is a major forum for continuing<br />
consultation and co-operation on energy matters between most of<br />
the industrialised nations.<br />
Australia will obtain a number of benefits from membership of the<br />
lEA. These include participation in long-term co-operation<br />
activities covering energy conservation programmes, joint energy<br />
research, as well as participation in the IEA's emergency oil sharing<br />
scheme. At this stage, oil supplies for the immeditate future are assured,<br />
and our degree of self-sufficiency in crude oil is a valuable<br />
cushion in the current climate.<br />
This self-sufficiency did not just happen. It was the result of<br />
hard work and risk taking by industry and by strong support from<br />
your government.<br />
At the end of three Labor years there was concern that the existing<br />
rates of production from the Bass Strait fields would decline<br />
steadily, leaving us excessively exposed to the world oil market.<br />
Now, as a direct result of our pricing policies, the outlook in coming<br />
years is more favourable.<br />
Extensive drilling and exploration programmes are taking place<br />
off Western Australia. For example, the huge North-West Shelf<br />
prograrmme which could involve expenditure of more than $ 3 000 million<br />
will have been directiy encouraged by our taxation concessions,<br />
incentives, and by our parity pricing policies.<br />
Your government is particularly aware of the special problems<br />
rising energy costs have for primary producers. To cushion the<br />
effects of price rises on fuel users in country areas, the government<br />
has given special help through the petroleum products subsidy<br />
scheme which reducas the price of petrol and other fuels to rural<br />
users.<br />
We are strongly supporting the concept of a national energy<br />
conservation programme concentrating on liquid fuels. We have received<br />
favourabe indications from the States that they would support such<br />
a pr c , rar,= e.<br />
Petroieu, m conservation is important to every Australian. The government<br />
is mindful of its role and our pricing policies are so designed<br />
to help conserve this scarce and finite energy source.<br />
All Australians can play a part too. We can stop and thing about<br />
the day to day habits we can change, and so help our country keep our<br />
obligations in an energy hungry world. </p>
