FOR PRESS 30 March 1979<br />
OPENING OF FERGUSON LODGE<br />
I am honoured to have been asked to share with you today your<br />
justifiable pride in the completion of this fine complex.<br />
The buildings stand as a tribute to the inspiration of the late<br />
Jack Ferguson, and I'm sure that all of us wish that he could be<br />
with us today ~ for it has been the leadership and dedicated service<br />
of people like Mr Ferguson who have revolutionised the care of<br />
the handicapped in Australia.<br />
Both the Commonwealth and State governments have contributed to<br />
this project, but financial help, although important, is not<br />
enough. For without the continuing dedicated work of associations<br />
such as the " Paraplegic and Quadriplegic Association of New South<br />
Wales", these facilities would be little more than expensive<br />
buildings full of expensive equipment.<br />
It is the person-to person contact, the work of volunteers who<br />
have a genuine feeling for, and a commitment to, others that finally<br />
is the measure of a caring community.<br />
The Paraplegic and Quadriplegic Association sets an excellent<br />
example of community service. Spinal injuries have been around<br />
for many years, I'm told that the first reported case was in<br />
ancient Egyptian times.<br />
Regrettably, however, the incidence of spinal injury has increased<br />
markedly in the last few decades, due to war, and more recently<br />
to what might be described as the war of the roads.<br />
That is why it is so good to see that New South Wales now has<br />
its own specialised care centre for paraplegic and quadriplegic<br />
casualties which follows the outstanding success of similar<br />
centres in Perth and Melbourne.<br />
The need for such centres, is incontrovertible. Prior to their<br />
introduction, the only accommodation available for quadriplegic<br />
persons unable to live at home were such places as nursing homes<br />
and geriatric institutions. They were hardly suitable places for<br />
a young physically handicapped adult with normal mental faculties.<br />
The new centres give these young people a new outlook on life.<br />
They provide a higher standard of nursing care and, at the same<br />
time, improve their quality of life. / 2 </p>
<p>2-<br />
As I said when I presented the " Handicapped Person of the Year<br />
Award" in October last year to Mrs Elizabeth Kosmala herself<br />
a paraplegic many Australians mistakenly believe that the<br />
handicapped cannot achieve a great deal for themselves or contribute<br />
to our society. As a consequence our society in the past has all<br />
too often exerted a subtle form of discrimination against the<br />
handicapped, based on ignorance and sometimes fear of illness and<br />
disability. The handicapped have been regarded as helpless a view which has<br />
given rise to thoughtlessness, disinterest and sometimes active<br />
opposition to the disabled.<br />
That's why I'm pleased to see emerging an assertiveness among<br />
young people who are handicapped. They want to help themselves.<br />
They want other people to understand that with specific<br />
assistance such as modifications to buildings, they can be very<br />
useful members of society.<br />
They want useful and productive employment, want to participate<br />
in community activities and sport, want to enjoy the freedom of<br />
mobility. The disabled are taking an increasingly prominent role in<br />
managing their own affairs. For example, I am particularly<br />
impressed by the fact that the " Civilian Maimed and Limbless<br />
Association"~ in this state, has six members on its board of<br />
management, including the Chairman and Secretary/ Treasurer who<br />
are disabled.<br />
Mr President, your own association's achievements are evidence<br />
of the change. From a modest beginning 17 years ago the Parapleglic and<br />
Quadriplegic Association has grown to an organisation with a<br />
total membership in New South Wales of 1,000.<br />
The Association has developed a wide range of vital specialised<br />
services. You provide experience and support for the handicapped<br />
and their families, but most importantly you promote and enable<br />
a greater degree of independence than many have believed was<br />
possible. But the rehabilitation of the disabled cannot be achieved solely<br />
by your organisations. You prepare people for the workforce but<br />
all too often employers are reluctant to give the person a chance.<br />
They do not have sufficiently flexible working arrangements to<br />
enable gradual integration of paraplegics and quadriplegics back<br />
into the workforce, and even where an employer is willing, the<br />
buildings or facilities may prevent access of reasonable mobility.<br />
The new " Design Rules for Access by the-Disabled" was published in<br />
1977, however, there is still a long way to go in ensuring equality<br />
of access for the handicapped.<br />
Simple matters such as ramps, doorways and passages of sufficient<br />
width, and special toilet facilities, are still all too rare in<br />
places of employment.<br />
This building serves as a model of what should become the general<br />
rule, not the exception, as present. Employers can help by i<br />
reserving jobs for handicapped people. who in many jobs can contribute </p>
<p>3<br />
as much or more than an able-bodied person. We all have a<br />
responsibility to ensure that the creative drive of our handicapped<br />
people is fostered and developed so that the disabled can<br />
integrate into our community life.<br />
All levels of government can and should help in town planning,<br />
in building regulations, in welfare programmes.<br />
All Australians can help the handicapped to improve their<br />
opportunities to use their talents, and play their part in<br />
society.<br />
Let's all keep this happening.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen, I have great pleasure in unveiling this<br />
plaque to officially open the Ferguson Lodge.<br />
