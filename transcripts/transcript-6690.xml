CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 12 AUGUST 1985<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER PARLIAMENTARY LUNCHEON<br />
HIS EXCELLENCY RATU SIR PENAIA KANABUTU GANILAU<br />
GOVERNOR-GENERAL OF FIJI CANBERRA 12 AUGUST 1985<br />
Your Excellency, Adi Mai, Mr high<br />
Commissioner, Distinguished Guests, Ladies and<br />
Gent lemen.<br />
Your State visit to Australia, following Sir Ninian<br />
Stephen's visit to Fiji, marks a further stage in the<br />
maturing relationship between our countries.<br />
Since achieving independence, Fiji has won great respect<br />
in the South Pacific region and in the international<br />
community in general.<br />
Fiji's contribution to international peace-keeping is<br />
very impressive. Your personal interest in this is<br />
widely respected.<br />
Fiji's active participation in international affairs,<br />
such as at the UN Women's Conference in Nairobi last<br />
month, which you attended, Adi Mei, is valued by<br />
Australia. The shared interests of Fiji and Australia were brought<br />
to the forefront again last week at the South Pacific<br />
Forum in Rarotonga<br />
Where my friend Prime Minister: Ratu Mara and I were<br />
able, together with other Paci-fic leaders, to<br />
discuss the many matters of mutual concern which<br />
join the countries of our region so amicably<br />
together.<br />
The shared interests of Forum countries range from<br />
concerns over trade and telecommunications, the special<br />
problems of smaller states and regional political<br />
questions such as New Caledonia. </p>
<p>-2<br />
As a region, we share jointly the responsibility for<br />
peace and security, for our environment, and for our<br />
future prosperity<br />
TIhe endorsement given by the Raratonga Forum to the<br />
Treaty for the Establishment of a Nuclear Free Zone in<br />
the South Pacific is of historic importance<br />
Australia is pleased that Fiji as well as Australia<br />
and six other Forum countries, was able to sign at<br />
Ra rotonga<br />
We believe that the Treaty, endorsed on the<br />
Anniversary of the nuclear devastation of the city<br />
of Horoshima, gives practical effect to Regional<br />
concerns about nuclear testing in the Pacific, the<br />
stationing of nuclear weapons and the dumping of<br />
radioactive waste<br />
And is a real step forward in arms control in a<br />
global as well as a regional sense.<br />
The SPARTECA agreement is an area of particular concern<br />
to Fiji. At the Forum I was able to inform Heads of<br />
Government of the Australian Government's decisions to<br />
liberalise Forum island countries' access to the<br />
Australian market.<br />
Australia's and New Zealand's offer to enter into<br />
discussions about whether there would be an<br />
advantage in Forum countries joining a broadened<br />
Australia-New Zealand Close Economic Relations<br />
Agreement was also taken up.<br />
I very much enjoyed my official visit to Suva last year<br />
as well as the pleasant and useful stopover which we had<br />
with Ratu tlara and Adi Lady Lala last weekend.<br />
We supported with enthusiasm the decison to hold next<br />
year's Forum meeting in Suva and look forward to seeing<br />
you again there.<br />
There are many diverse links joining our countries:<br />
QANTAS and Air Pacific are co-operating to assist<br />
your tourist industry.<br />
Our Defence Co-operation Program widens the<br />
experience of personnel in both our defence forces<br />
and is of benefit to both our countries.<br />
And I do not need to mention our countries' ' shared<br />
enthusiasm for rugby union.<br />
Your Exqpllency<br />
I spoke before of the maturing relationship between<br />
Australia and Fiji. Let us look forward to our<br />
friendship and co-operation continuing far into the<br />
future. </p>
