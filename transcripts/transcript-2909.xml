O7 AUSTIAI. IAPRESS STATEMENT NO. 84<br />
4 May, 1973<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
The Hon. E. G. Whitlam M. P.<br />
PUBLIC SERVICE AGE LIMITS<br />
The Prime Minister announced today that the upper age<br />
limits applying to appointments to the Commonwealth Service as<br />
Clerk, Clerical Assistant and Typist have been removed. This<br />
move will greatly increase the opportunities for employment of<br />
middle-aged and married women in the service.<br />
The age limits have been 28 for clerks, 30 for clerical<br />
assistants and between 30 and 45 ( depending on circumstancks)<br />
for typists. The removal of the limits results from a spe. cial<br />
review being carried out by the Public Service Board of all age<br />
limits currently applying to recruitment to the Commonwealzh<br />
Service. This review is being made in the light of the current<br />
recruitment situation and in relation to present day social<br />
and economic conditions. The review has shown that the need<br />
of the Service for a proportion of career entrants can, in the<br />
present circumstances, be served adequately without mandatory<br />
age limits. The removal of age limits is a contribution to the<br />
flexibility of the work force. People such as those displaced<br />
by technological change and married women seeking to re-enco:<br />
the work force will no longer be debarred by age from cowmpeting<br />
for permanent appointment to the Commonwealth Service.<br />
If present trends continue, it is probable that in the<br />
future many women will return to work when their children &amp; re<br />
old enough and will usually have about twenty to thirty years<br />
of working life ahead of them. To enable women to resume<br />
their careers when they wish to do so, and to ensure tnat t. i:<br />
abilities, training and experience are not wasted, the Govecn..; cnt<br />
hopes that other employers will be prepared to plan career ditterr<br />
for women which includes a break in service. 2/ </p>
<p>In other words, if there is to be real equality of<br />
opportunity, we must accept the fact that the work pattern<br />
of women is different. A woman should not be unduly penalised<br />
in employment by requirements such as unbroken service,<br />
full-time working hours and other conditions governing her<br />
eligibility for security of employment and opportunity for<br />
advancement beyond junior status.<br />
This decision of the Public Service Board is the beginning<br />
of a realistic policy enabling women to reconcile domestic<br />
responsibilities with a career. It is hoped that further steps<br />
will include the introduction of permanent part-time work and<br />
other forms of employment as well as flexible working hours.<br />
The community as a whole will benefit in the long run. </p>
