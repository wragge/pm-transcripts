ABORIGINAL AFFAIRS POLICY<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
The Rt Hon. William McMahon<br />
TO THE CONFERENCE OF COMMONWEALTH AND STATE<br />
MINISTERS RESPONSIBLE FOR ABORIGINAL AFFAIRS<br />
AT CAIRNS<br />
23 April1971<br />
I am sorry not to be able today to meet the Ministers responsible for<br />
Aboriginal affairs throughout Australia. It is, however, appropriate that I<br />
should take this opportunity early in the life of my Government to declare<br />
the profound concern I and my Government have for the advancement of<br />
Aboriginal Australians and our determination to move steadily and firmly<br />
towards the solution of the many problems which confront us in achieving<br />
it. At the same time I would like to give a brief outline of some of the principles<br />
underlying our policies and our administration of them.<br />
I believe that the problems of racial differences and the evils of poverty,<br />
ignorance, prejudice and discrimination which so often go with them are<br />
among the most urgent and most difficult in the world today. At a time.<br />
when the moral indignation of the world is directed at these evils it is important<br />
for our own sense of humanity and for our relations with the rest of the<br />
world that our determination to deal effectively with them in our own<br />
society should not be in doubt. While we intend to proceed with discretion<br />
and care, we will not allow prejudice or temporary financial difficulties to<br />
stand in the way of more effective action to deal with these intensely human<br />
problems. Let me say a little about fundamental objectives. I do not like attempts to<br />
embody complex policies in single words like assimilation or integration,<br />
capable as they are of varied interpretations and acquiring often irrational<br />
associations. We believe that Aboriginal Australians should be assisted as<br />
individuals and, if they wish, as groups to hold effective and respected places<br />
within one Australian society with equal access to the rights and opportunities<br />
it provides and accepting responsibilities towards it. At the same time </p>
<p>they should be encouraged and assisted to preserve and develop their culture<br />
their languages, traditions and arts so that these can become living elements<br />
in the diverse culture of the Australian society. My Government's policy will<br />
be directed to these ends.<br />
I welcome this meeting especially as a symbol of our genuinely federal<br />
approach to this problem. Aboriginal affairs is not a single functional responsibility<br />
like most other portfolios. It is a general care for the whole welfare of<br />
a minority people with a variety of special problems. Housing, education,<br />
health, employment, economic opportunity, civil liberties the foundations<br />
of community advancement are in their general aspects the responsibility<br />
of a number of Ministers and their Departments, sometimes in a State and<br />
sometimes in the Commonwealth. Aboriginal advancement must be built<br />
upon the same foundations. Hence I believe that, to the extent practicable,<br />
we should move towards devolving upon individual Ministers and their Departments<br />
the administration of those aspects of policies for Aboriginal advancement<br />
for which they are responsible for the rest of the community.<br />
It will, as I see it, be the function of Ministers responsible for Aboriginal<br />
affairs, with the active interest of the Prime Minister, and in the States, I<br />
hope, the Premier, to develop policy, to co-ordinate different components of<br />
it, and to check up on its balance and effectiveness. Since responsibility for<br />
many of these components of policy lies in the State sphere we look to you<br />
to participate fully and to give to policies and administration a genuinely<br />
local quality and flavour. You may rely upon the genuine co-operation of<br />
my Government in your efforts.<br />
In my own Government I intend that the Minister responsible for Aboriginal<br />
affairs will have my strong personal interest and support. It will be his<br />
task to work out, in collaboration with his colleagues in functional departments<br />
and with the Minister for the Interior, policies to meet the special<br />
needs and problems of Aborigines.<br />
For this purpose I shall establish a special Ministerial Committee presided<br />
over by the Minister. He will, with the aid of this Committee, be concerned<br />
to present these various policies as a coherent whole and to ensure their<br />
effective balance and co-ordination.<br />
In this work the Minister and the Ministerial Committee will be advised by<br />
the Council and Office of Aboriginal Affairs whose functions and powers I<br />
am taking steps to clarify and re-state. The close liaison which has developed<br />
between the Council and Office and their opposite numbers in the States<br />
will, I hope, be strengthened even further. </p>
<p>I have asked the Council, in consultation with appropriate Commonwealth<br />
and State Departments and authorities, to review urgently existing Commonwealth<br />
programmes for the advancement of Aboriginal citizens and to advise<br />
me through the Minister on a programme of action which can be put into<br />
effect progressively. This programme will build on the special welfare activities<br />
designed to improve the health, housing, education and vocational<br />
training of Aborigines now being carried out with Commonwealth financial<br />
support primarily through the States.<br />
The programme will be concerned to increase the economic strength and<br />
independence of Aborigines by widening their employment opportunities and<br />
by assisting them into potentially successful enterprises both as individuals<br />
and as communities. Attention will be devoted to the search for opportunities<br />
for Aborigines in areas with which they have traditional links. For instance<br />
we hope, with the collaboration between the Commonwealth and the States,<br />
to find opportunities for them in conservation-type enterprises and activities<br />
which may include forestry, flood mitigation, rehabilitation of the natural<br />
environment and the development of national parks with special Aboriginal<br />
interests. But in parallel with these efforts we will try, by training, accommodation<br />
and placement, to assist those willing to move to areas and centres of<br />
greater opportunity.<br />
Consideration will be given to an appropriate policy for Aborigines and<br />
the land, ensuring to continuing Aboriginal groups effective access to land for<br />
recreational and ceremonial purposes as well as for the development of enterprises.<br />
I am happy to inform Ministers that discussions with the States, following<br />
the agreement reached at this conference a year ago to examine remaining<br />
legislation which appears to discriminate against Aborigines, have proceeded<br />
amicably and promise well for a successful outcome. Thereafter it will be our<br />
task, with, I believe, the support of the great mass of the Australian people,<br />
to move towards the complete enjoyment of normal civil liberties by Aborigines<br />
generally.<br />
We believe that this will not wholly be achieved until Aboriginal citizens<br />
are given the-fullest opportunity to demonstrate the richness of their own<br />
cultural life and its potential as a component in our general diverse culture.<br />
Consequently we intend to assist Aborigines to protect and develop their<br />
own languages, arts, traditions and general culture and to help educate the<br />
community generally to understand, respect and enjoy the contribution<br />
Aborigines can make to the richness and diversity of our national life. </p>
<p>Finally we believe that Aborigines must be helped to take an increasing<br />
part in the management of their own affairs. We welcome the moves that have<br />
been taken to develop State, regional and local councils and other representative<br />
and consultative bodies in Aboriginal communities and hope that this<br />
programme can be stimulated. There is scope for programmes of consultation<br />
with Aboriginal groups to be further developed and in particular for types of<br />
organizations to be studied which may build up decision making and action<br />
by Aborigines themselves. Interesting experiments are in process with organizations<br />
in community development and group economic enterprises. We will<br />
encourage and help their further progress.<br />
My Government recognises that much has already been achieved in health,<br />
education, housing, vocational training, placement in employment and in<br />
economic development. However it sees continued and substantial progress<br />
in Aboriginal affairs as the test of our community's determination to end<br />
racial discrimination in our midst and to deal with Aboriginal Australians<br />
with respect, justice, humanity and compassion. If existing programmes can<br />
be built upon effectively on the lines I have described I believe we can achieve<br />
a break-through to a new level of performance. I welcome your collaboration<br />
in proving that we can measure up to this test in the eyes of the world and to<br />
the satisfaction of our own conscience.<br />
I wish you well in your deliberations. </p>
