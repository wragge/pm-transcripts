    <content><![CDATA[<p>E&amp;OE..........................................................................................</p>
<p>Thank you very much Richard. To Mrs Joy Howley, the president of the</p>
<p> Victorian Division, to my parliamentary colleagues both State and</p>
<p> Federal, and to the many supporters and members of the Liberal Party</p>
<p> here in Victoria. We gather together tonight at a very important moment</p>
<p> in the political life of Australia. It is now a little over two-and-a-quarter</p>
<p> years since the Coalition Government was returned to office in March</p>
<p> of 1996. Quite obviously the Coalition over the past month or two</p>
<p> has had some difficult times, but I've never been one to mince</p>
<p> words or to pretend or to play games and I speak, as Richard said,</p>
<p> from the background of some understanding of the Australian political</p>
<p> scene. And there are some challenges around at the moment that haven't</p>
<p> been around before and there are some substances in the political</p>
<p> firmament that haven't been around before. And there are some</p>
<p> responses that are needed on this occasion that haven't been</p>
<p> needed before. And the first and most and most important thing that</p>
<p> I want to say to all of you tonight is that it is time for not only</p>
<p> the parliamentary party, but also time for all members of the party</p>
<p> organisation, to come out fighting and fighting very hard to explain</p>
<p> to the Australian people two things - two very simple things.</p>
<p>The first of those is the monumental achievements of the Government</p>
<p> since it was elected to office in March of 1996 and also throwing</p>
<p> forward to the future the very very simple fact that the Coalition</p>
<p> alone of the political entities on the Australian political horizon</p>
<p> actually has a plan, actually has a design, actually has a set of</p>
<p> values and a set of goals for the future of Australia.</p>
<p>Now, I know the opinion polls are bad at the moment. They've</p>
<p> been bad before and they've come good, and we all know that great</p>
<p> adage to which we will forever be indebted to my predecessor, Malcolm</p>
<p> Fraser, when he said that there was only one poll that counted. Obviously</p>
<p> One Nation has had impact on the political scene, but as I told the</p>
<p> Liberal Party in Western Australia at the weekend there is no simple</p>
<p> one line put down of One Nation. The way the Liberal Party beats One</p>
<p> Nation is the way it beats the Labor Party and that is to offer the</p>
<p> people of Australia something better. And what we need to do, all</p>
<p> of us, is to remind the Australian people of what we have achieved,</p>
<p> to remind them that when we came to office the Federal Government</p>
<p> debt was $95 billion and it was accumulating at the rate of $10.5</p>
<p> billion a year, and in just two-and-a-quarter years we've wound</p>
<p> that back such that this year we will have a surplus of $2.7 billion.</p>
<p>We should remind the Australian people that interest rates now are</p>
<p> lower than they have been for 30 years, that the average homeowner</p>
<p> is $300 a month better off. That's the equivalent of a pay rise</p>
<p> of a $100 a week for the average wage and salary earner. We should</p>
<p> remind people as I did at the awards presentation ceremony of the</p>
<p> Master Plumbers this afternoon here in Melbourne, that in March of</p>
<p> 1996 there were 143,000 young Australians in apprenticeships and traineeships,</p>
<p> and by the end of the year that figure will have climbed to 200,000</p>
<p> and great credit is due to David Kemp for the tremendous work that</p>
<p> he's done on that front. We should remind the Australian people</p>
<p> that we've created 293,000 jobs in two-and-a-quarter years. We</p>
<p> should remind the Australian people that we have the lowest inflation</p>
<p> rate in the OECD area, and that our growth rate this year, despite</p>
<p> the challenge of the Asian-Pacific region is going to outstrip that</p>
<p> of most of the countries of the industrialised world. We should remind</p>
<p> the Australian people of our achievements in reforming industrial</p>
<p> relations. We should tell the people again and again of what we have</p>
<p> done in the are of work-for-the-dole, and we should also remind them</p>
<p> that if Mr Beazley were to become Prime Minister, he would abolish</p>
<p> the work-for-the-dole scheme, just as he would reverse the crackdown</p>
<p> on welfare, which is saving average Australians, hard working honest</p>
<p> taxpayers $46 million a week. We should remind the Australian people</p>
<p> that it was the Coalition Government that ended the exploitation of</p>
<p> the immigration programme which occurred under the former Government</p>
<p> and introduced a two year waiting period for new migrants, that altered</p>
<p> the balance of the migration programme with a greater emphasis on</p>
<p> skilled migration whilst maintaining the long-standing commitment</p>
<p> of the Liberal Party towards a completely colour blind and completely</p>
<p> non-discriminatory immigration policy.</p>
<p>There is much that we should remind our fellow country men and women</p>
<p> about over the weeks and months ahead but we should also, and we will</p>
<p> have plenty of opportunity, when the Coalition's taxation plans</p>
<p> are unveiled, we'll have plenty of opportunity to tell the Australian</p>
<p> people not only what we have achieved over the last two-and-a-quarter</p>
<p> years but what we will achieve over the next three years if the Australian</p>
<p> public re-elects us.</p>
<p>And I think we also ought to remind the Australian public that it</p>
<p> is very easy to identify what Mr Beazley stands for in one sense and</p>
<p> in one sense alone. He stands for winning, but it is very difficult</p>
<p> to find what else he stands for. He's a person who's against</p>
<p> everything. He's a person who has repudiated whatever transient</p>
<p> embrace of economic common sense that might in the past have been</p>
<p> the want of former Labor Governments. He wants to take us back to</p>
<p> the 1950s with his industrial relations policy. He says the present</p>
<p> taxation system is perfect and is really in need only of tinkering</p>
<p> at the edges. He will abolish the reforms that we have implemented</p>
<p> in so many areas. He was the man who assured the employees of the</p>
<p> Commonwealth Bank that a Labor Government would never privatise that</p>
<p> bank, yet once re-elected he went ahead and did so, as indeed his</p>
<p> colleagues had assured the Australian public regarding QANTAS and</p>
<p> Australian Airlines.</p>
<p>We will have a great opportunity in the weeks immediately ahead of</p>
<p> us, when our plans to reform the Australian taxation system are unveiled.</p>
<p> We will have a great opportunity to demonstrate that the Coalition</p>
<p> and the Coalition alone are in favour of a taxation system that will</p>
<p> take this country into the 21st Century. Now I know there</p>
<p> are some people and I'm sure there are some people in this audience</p>
<p> who say for Heaven's sake what on earth is he talking about</p>
<p> taxation reform for. Why doesn't he just keep quiet, mutter a</p>
<p> few words about having a meeting, put down a few principles, get back</p>
<p> into office and then introduce taxation reform?' Can I say to</p>
<p> you my friends that is impossible. I can't look the Australian</p>
<p> people in the eye before the next election when asked the question</p>
<p> "Will you make major changes to Australia's taxation system?"</p>
<p> I can't look them in the eye and say no when I know in my heart</p>
<p> that is what Australia needs, and if I am to talk in generalities</p>
<p> about taxation reform and say "Yes we are going to reform the</p>
<p> system, and we are going to get everybody to meet together and will</p>
<p> try and achieve a consensus" That would invite the mother of</p>
<p> all political fear campaigns from Mr Beazley and the Labor Party.</p>
<p> They would go from one end of Australia to the other saying that Howard</p>
<p> is going to introduce a GST of 25% and he's not going to compensate</p>
<p> the low income earners and he's not going to give any personal</p>
<p> income tax cuts. He's going to look after the rich and ignore</p>
<p> the poor and the low and middle income earners. And I would be powerless</p>
<p> to refute that because we wouldn't have a detailed plan, and</p>
<p> if anybody imagines for a moment that that is an intelligent political</p>
<p> recipe for handling this, then they don't understand the dynamics</p>
<p> of modern politics in Australia. We don't control the Senate.</p>
<p> We'll try very hard at the next election to win more Senate seats</p>
<p> but we could at least face as difficult a time after the next election</p>
<p> as we now face in getting legislation through the Parliament. Therefore</p>
<p> if we want to change the Australian taxation system, if we believe,</p>
<p> as I do and my colleagues do that it is in Australia's interests</p>
<p> and it is for the good of Australia that we have a new and different</p>
<p> taxation system, then we have no political or moral alternative then</p>
<p> to lay out our plans before the election and go from one end of the</p>
<p> country explaining the benefits for Australia of changing our taxation</p>
<p> system.</p>
<p>There are some who argue that you should do nothing about it because</p>
<p> of what is happening in Asia. Can I say to you my friends that it</p>
<p> is because of what is happening in Asia that it is all the more necessary</p>
<p> to do something about it. We face, because of the Asian economic downturn,</p>
<p> a far more difficult economic environment than we thought would be</p>
<p> the case when were elected in 1996, and if we hadn't done what</p>
<p> we have done since 1996, the Australian economy would now be more</p>
<p> fragile, more vulnerable and weaker and the outlook gloomier than</p>
<p> what in reality it is. We strengthened our budget position, we got</p>
<p> our interest rates down, we improved the investment climate, we increasingly</p>
<p> looked attractive to the rest of the world in this part of the region</p>
<p> while other economies were falling over and the next logical step</p>
<p> is to change our taxation system. Because if we do that, we will make</p>
<p> Australia even more competitive. We will take a load off our exporters.</p>
<p> We will give people more incentive to work and to save. We will make</p>
<p> Australia more attractive as an international investment centre. So</p>
<p> the argument that you put it off because of Asia is completely wrong.</p>
<p> You bring it on because of Asia. I mean, the fact that Asia is a challenge</p>
<p> to us is an additional argument why we should embrace taxation change</p>
<p> and reform.</p>
<p>I can assure you that the tax plan, when it's brought out, will</p>
<p> not involve dumping a goods and services tax on top of the existing</p>
<p> taxation system. We're talking about a total taxation reform.</p>
<p> I laid down five principles in August of last year when I announced</p>
<p> that we would commence the reform and rehabilitation of the Australian</p>
<p> taxation system. And those five principles will be honoured when the</p>
<p> policy is brought down. And they included a commitment to protect</p>
<p> low-income earners in the Australian community and I want to give</p>
<p> those people, tonight, an assurance that they will not be left worse</p>
<p> off as a result of our reforms. They will be protected. It has always</p>
<p> been the mission of a Liberal government to look after the low-income</p>
<p> earners in the Australian community. And the reductions that we have</p>
<p> achieved in inflation and interest rates, in proportionate terms,</p>
<p> have delivered more benefits to low-income earners in Australia than</p>
<p> they have to any other section of the Australian community.</p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen, I see the weeks ahead of us as very important</p>
<p> weeks for the Coalition. We have an opportunity to do two things.</p>
<p> All of us have an opportunity, in a renewed and aggressive fashion,</p>
<p> to remind the Australian community of what has been achieved over</p>
<p> the last two-and-a-quarter years. And when you remember that, despite</p>
<p> our 44-seat majority in the House of Representatives, that we still</p>
<p> don't control the Senate, that we still have, because of that</p>
<p> one hand tied behind our back, what has been achieved is, indeed,</p>
<p> I think, quite monumental.</p>
<p>We've had, in relation to all of our major pieces of legislation,</p>
<p> we've had to try several times before we've got it through.</p>
<p> Nobody thought we would get the Native Title Amendment Bill</p>
<p> through. In the end, we did, and although it wasn't to the last</p>
<p> letter everything that we wanted, it was overwhelmingly what we wanted.</p>
<p> And at long last, after five years of chaos and doubt and obfuscation</p>
<p> and delay, we are now going to have a native title regime in this</p>
<p> country that gives stability to farmers and miners, gives a hope that</p>
<p> some native title claims can be established in relation to the indigenous</p>
<p> people of this country and, I think, takes off the Australian political</p>
<p> agenda an issue that could, indeed, have been divisive in the eyes</p>
<p> of many in the Australian community.</p>
<p>Richard mentioned the Telstra sale. We remain committed to the full</p>
<p> privatisation of Telstra. We're going to do it in stages. And</p>
<p> you might ask, 'why would you privatise it?' There's one or two</p>
<p> very powerful arguments. But the most powerful of all is that at the</p>
<p> 30th of June this year the Federal Government owed the</p>
<p> rest of the world about $82 billion courtesy of eight or nine budget</p>
<p> deficits run up by Mr Beazley and Mr Keating. The sale of the remainder</p>
<p> of Telstra alone will realise at least $40 billion. That's half</p>
<p> of the total. And what do you do with the interest savings when you</p>
<p> pay-off half of $82 billion? You spend those interest savings on roads,</p>
<p> on schools, on health and on housing. And you also have a bit left</p>
<p> over to spend some things in improving the telecommunications system</p>
<p> of rural and regional Australia. People ask me, why would you</p>
<p> want to privatise the rest of Telstra?' That's the most</p>
<p> powerful reason why you would want to do it. And we're going</p>
<p> to do it in stages.</p>
<p>We know that there is concern in country Australia, in the bush </p>
<p> and I don't mind using the politically incorrect term. I think</p>
<p> most Australians still describe it very much as the bush. In the bush</p>
<p> there is worry that the telecommunications aren't good and you</p>
<p> do need to invest more in it. You won't get the dollars to invest</p>
<p> in improving those telecommunications unless you are willing to privatise</p>
<p> the rest of Telstra. But we're going to do it in stages. We're</p>
<p> going to sell up to 49 per cent and then we're going to pause</p>
<p> and we're going to have an inquiry, an independent inquiry, against</p>
<p> the benchmarks that we will put in legislation as to whether the community</p>
<p> service obligations are being met by Telstra. And when we get the</p>
<p> go-ahead from that, that they are, then we're going to proceed</p>
<p> to the next stage. And in the long run, that policy will relieve a</p>
<p> debt burden on the Australian community and it will enable future</p>
<p> governments to do good things with the money that would otherwise</p>
<p> have been spent servicing a debt run up by Mr Keating and Mr Beazley.</p>
<p> Now, if that's not a good proposition, if that's not a good</p>
<p> deal for the Australian people then I really don't know what</p>
<p> is.</p>
<p>So, ladies and gentlemen, we have great political opportunities in</p>
<p> the weeks and months ahead of us. We have achieved a lot over the</p>
<p> last two-and-a-quarter years. We have much more to achieve and we</p>
<p> have much more to realise in terms of our political goals and our</p>
<p> political hopes.</p>
<p>I want to take the opportunity tonight of thanking the members of</p>
<p> the Liberal Party here in Victoria for the tremendous professionalism</p>
<p> that you have all displayed, both in the years that I was in opposition</p>
<p> and in the last two and a bit years in Government. The Victorian organisation</p>
<p> has been very supportive of the Government and I thank the President</p>
<p> and I thank the State Director and I thank all members of the organisation</p>
<p> for the loyalty and support that you have displayed towards me and</p>
<p> towards the Government. I want to acknowledge the professionalism</p>
<p> of the Liberal Party here in Victoria. It is no mean feat to have</p>
<p> achieved what this Division has achieved over the last eight or nine</p>
<p> years, both at a State and a federal level.</p>
<p>I also pay tribute to the quality of the federal representation that</p>
<p> you have sent to Canberra from here in Victoria. It numbers, of course,</p>
<p> my Deputy, Peter Costello, who's done an outstanding job as Treasurer</p>
<p> since the election in March of 1996 and I pay unstinted tribute to</p>
<p> the work and the commitment and the tenacity of Peter in that role.</p>
<p> I also acknowledge the contribution of Richard Alston who is not only</p>
<p> the Deputy Leader in the Senate but also a member of the leadership</p>
<p> team. I can't think of a person who could have handled the difficult</p>
<p> issues thrown up by the communications portfolio and, of course, his</p>
<p> grasp and understanding of the arts in Australia in terms of bringing</p>
<p> it to the mainstream of the Australian community and his capacity,</p>
<p> above both of those things, to handle Jabiluka protesters, has me</p>
<p> in absolute awe.</p>
<p>To Peter Reith and to Michael Wooldridge; to all of the other </p>
<p> to Rod Kemp, to David Kemp, who I've already mentioned because</p>
<p> of the work that he's done; to Judith Troeth, the Parliamentary</p>
<p> Secretary, I might say the first Liberal Parliamentary Secretary -</p>
<p> no offence to my National Party colleagues, of course  first</p>
<p> Liberal Parliamentary Secretary for rural affairs; to all of them</p>
<p> I want to say a very warm thanks. And to all of my other colleagues</p>
<p> in Victoria, to Karen, to Kay and to everybody else, can I express</p>
<p> my gratitude and I particularly acknowledge the presence of Julian</p>
<p> here tonight as the National Party member of the Senate team for the</p>
<p> next election.</p>
<p>We have a great challenge ahead of us. I am filled both with energy</p>
<p> and optimism and, above all, commitment for that challenge. I know</p>
<p> that we have been through some difficult times. I know that the appearance</p>
<p> of the One Nation Party on the horizon was a surprising event to many.</p>
<p> But like all other challenges that we have faced in our political</p>
<p> history, we will be able to beat it off. We will beat it off by offering</p>
<p> the Australian people something better. We will beat it off by being</p>
<p> honest to the Australian people about our economic future. We will</p>
<p> give the lie to the proposition that Australia's economic salvation</p>
<p> lies in putting up the tariff walls and sealing this country off from</p>
<p> the rest of the world. I can't think of anything more calculated</p>
<p> to weaken and enfeeble the Australian economy than to go back to the</p>
<p> days of old protection. We will also beat off any attempt by any section</p>
<p> of the Australian community to embrace racial bigotry or discrimination</p>
<p> as part and parcel of our society.</p>
<p>The Liberal Party, let me remind you, was the party, under the prime</p>
<p> ministership of Harold Holt, that abolished the White Australia'</p>
<p> policy. The Liberal Party has a proud record of tolerance. The Liberal</p>
<p> Party's policies will always be colour blind. The Liberal Party</p>
<p> always opposes discrimination and bigotry. Any type-casting of people</p>
<p> on the basis of their racial or ethnic background is alien to everything</p>
<p> we believe in and is something that will never be countenanced by</p>
<p> any Liberal government at any time in the party's history. And</p>
<p> I want to say, on behalf of all sections of the Liberal Party, how</p>
<p> utterly committed we remain to the maintenance of those great principles</p>
<p> of tolerance, of non-discrimination and of the treatment of people</p>
<p> based on their merit and the contribution they make to the Australian</p>
<p> community.</p>
<p>We were elected in March of 1996 for a lot of reasons. You were reminded</p>
<p> of one of those reasons when you turned on your television set last</p>
<p> night and you saw the ALP arts launch. But I think the most important</p>
<p> reason that we were elected in March of 1996 is that the people of</p>
<p> Australia wanted a government that would govern for all Australians,</p>
<p> that would be first and foremost responsive to the mainstream of the</p>
<p> Australian community, would not be a government that would swing on</p>
<p> the hinge of every narrow interest group in the Australian community</p>
<p> but rather would be a government that would attach itself to the interests</p>
<p> of the mainstream of the Australian community. And that is why, of</p>
<p> all the things that we have done, those of which I am most proud are</p>
<p> those that have been directed towards the interests and the concerns</p>
<p> of the mainstream of the Australian community. And as it has been</p>
<p> with those reforms, so it will be when the taxation policy is released.</p>
<p>It'll be a taxation policy that will be good for Australia because</p>
<p> it will lift our living standards, our investment, reduce our business</p>
<p> costs, give taxpayers greater incentives to work and to save and to</p>
<p> give to the economic infrastructure of this country a very, very significant</p>
<p> boost and a very significant improvement. And we will be able to say</p>
<p> to the Australian people, whenever we go to the next election, whenever</p>
<p> that may be, we will be able to say to the Australian people that</p>
<p> the Coalition and the Coalition alone has a plan, has a vision, has</p>
<p> a set of values and a set of ideas for the 21st Century.</p>
<p> And I can't think of anything more valuable to give to the young</p>
<p> who will inherit the 21st Century than an Australian society's</p>
<p> strengthened and invigorated by change and reform.</p>
<p>So, my friends, thank you very much for the support that you've</p>
<p> given over the years. I look around this room, I see people who've</p>
<p> given long years of service and loyalty and commitment to our common</p>
<p> cause. I've spent most, indeed, all of my adult life virtually</p>
<p> working in different ways in the Liberal Party and I always retain</p>
<p> a deep sense of connection and empathy with those who work and support</p>
<p> the party year in and year out. I thank you for that. I thank my colleagues</p>
<p> from Victoria. I'm proud of the Senate team that you've</p>
<p> chosen. I wish it well and I look forward to a resounding success</p>
<p> whenever the election is held. Thank you.</p>
