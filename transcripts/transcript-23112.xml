    <content><![CDATA[<p>Thanks very much Peter, thanks Brett, thanks Chaplain Monu,Â it is a real honour for me to be here this morning to be associated with the naming of <em>Spirit of Mateship</em> and to be associated with <em>Mates 4 Mates</em>.</p>
<p>This is an important cause and it is a significant occasion.</p>
<p>Our country needs armed forces and our armed forces go abroad to defend our interests, to protect our citizens, and perhaps above all else, to uphold our values.</p>
<p>Our armed forces have gone abroad on numerous occasions over the last century, usually with our fine allies and we have done good work.</p>
<p>But members of the armed forces pay a high price.</p>
<p>The most recent engagement of our armed forces has been in Afghanistan and as we all know 40 have died, 161 have been seriously wounded, countless have suffered the unseen wounds of combat, and itâs vital that a grateful and appreciative nation stands by our veterans when they return. Particularly stands by our veterans as they come to grips with the consequences of serving our country in the armed forces.</p>
<p>This is where <em>Mates 4 Mates,</em> along with so many other organisations, does such great work.</p>
<p>The insight of <em>Mates 4 Mates</em>, if I may say so, is that whenever we're in trouble it is so often the best medicine of all to be active, to be mentally active, to be physically active, and it's great to see under the auspices of <em>Mates 4 Mates</em>, our war veterans, the veterans of service in our armed forces are doing something like sailing to Hobart in one of our great sporting challenges.</p>
<p>So, I am very, very proud and honoured to be associated with this event. I am thrilled to be in the company of members of our armed forces and former members of our armed forces.</p>
<p>I want to thank Peter Davies for everything he has done. I want to thank the Queensland RSL for what they have done and I want to congratulate all of the crew of the <em>Spirit of Mateship,</em> the members and former members of our armed forces and the more regular sailors.</p>
<p>I look at you all, you are a tough crew, you are a good crew and I'm sure that when you get to Hobart the town will know you've arrived.</p>
<p>Thank you so much.</p>
