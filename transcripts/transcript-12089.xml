    <content><![CDATA[<p>At the invitation of the New Zealand Prime Minister, Helen Clark, I will travel to New Zealand from 24 to 26 February for annual trans-Tasman prime ministerial talks. This will reciprocate Miss Clark's visit to Australia for our annual talks in March 2000, and in September during the Olympics.</p>
<p>Few countries in the world share such broad and successful relations as Australia and New Zealand. The strength and creative partnership of the current relationship is based on shared values, convergent national interests, and strong historical ties. With bilateral trade (merchandise and services) running at $14.4 billion annually, economic relations have never been stronger. Our regional partnership has Australians and New Zealanders serving side by side in the cause of peace in East Timor, Bougainville and the Solomon Islands.</p>
<p>The visit will allow both of us to focus on strengthening trans-Tasman ties and exploring ways in which we can work together to meet current regional and global challenges.</p>
<p>I anticipate meeting business leaders in Auckland on Saturday 24 February, prior to bilateral talks with Miss Clark the next day. My formal visit programme in Wellington on Monday 26 February will include calls on Miss Clark, prominent New Zealand ministers and the leader of the New Zealand Opposition. </p>
