TRANSCRIPT OF UNEDITED INTERVIEW WITH PAUL MURPHY, PM<br />
PROGRAM, 8 NOVEMBER 1990<br />
E 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
MURPHY: Prime Minister, just before coming to your<br />
statement to Parliament this afternoon, yesterday you had<br />
a win with inflation down to 6% which surprised<br />
everybody. Today the other side of that figure, if you<br />
like, unemployment is up to So isn't the hard<br />
reality, the fact that the economy is in serious trouble<br />
still, in fact quite serious trouble?<br />
PM: The fact is that what is happening to the economy is<br />
what was necessary, unfortunately, to deal with the preexisting<br />
situation where the simple fact was that our<br />
expenditure as a nation was increasing by 8% and our<br />
production by That was untenable and any responsible<br />
government had to slow the level of activity down<br />
otherwise the rest of the world would've imposed a<br />
solution on us which would have been devastating. So we<br />
have had to have tight monetary policy last year.<br />
Through this; year we've now on five successive occasions,<br />
Paul, reduced interest rates and we are now seeing that<br />
slowing down in the economy which was necessary but it's<br />
a slowing down which is going to not lead to the<br />
devastation of the economy but during next year we will<br />
see economic recovery taking place, and sustainable<br />
economic recovery. If we hadn't done what we have done<br />
in slowing the economy down the world would've done it<br />
for us but in a much more ruthless fashion in a way which<br />
wouldn't have allowed us to be continuing with the<br />
processes of reform that were typified by the statement I<br />
made in the Parliament today.<br />
MURPHY: You seem very confident that there will be an<br />
upturn in the first half of next year. Why are you so<br />
confident that that will happen? A lot of other<br />
commentators say that we're in decline for the rest of<br />
this decade.<br />
PM: That is nonsense, in decline for the rest of the<br />
decade. I mean that's so absurd on its face as to hardly<br />
warrant any comment. The fact is that certain things<br />
will be happening now in this period ahead that I've<br />
talking about which will lead to improvement. In that I<br />
mean let me refer to them. The fact is of course that<br />
I've said there have been five successive reductions in<br />
interest rates during this year and they will start to </p>
<p>impact. There's always this lagged impact in monetary<br />
policy and what we're seeing now is the effect of the<br />
high interest rates of 12 months and more ago 12 to 18<br />
months ago. Secondly, we will have the impact to<br />
activity coming from the tax cuts which will flow into<br />
consumers pockets in January and we will have the wage<br />
increases as well. We'll have the rebuilding of stocks<br />
that will take place during the stock cycle. All those<br />
things are going to be positive factors in leading to<br />
what we believe the recovery in ' 91.<br />
MURPHY: Do you expect the unions to stick to the deal<br />
worked out between them and the Government or do you<br />
think the latest CPI figure and its size will cause them<br />
to want to renegotiate?<br />
PM: Well I just don't know. We're meeting with them a<br />
meeting which was scheduled at any rate tonight, the<br />
Australian Labor Advisory Council meeting. We'll be<br />
meeting the unions tonight. But what is important is, I<br />
believe, that they retain their commitment to the accord<br />
which in terms of aggregate wage outcomes, talks about a<br />
7% national aggregate, national aggregate wage outcome.<br />
And I believe they will retain their commitment to that.<br />
That in terms of levels of activity and the future<br />
prospects for this economy is what matters.<br />
MURPHY: You gave your Ministry and your Cabinet a pep<br />
talk at the beginning of the week, you've asked them to<br />
get out there and sell the message, to explain how<br />
policies are working. Some people see Mr Dawkins' speech<br />
yesterday and some media appearances he made as being a<br />
response to that. Others say that it could be that<br />
there's a contemplation in Cabinet coming up of a change<br />
of economic policies.<br />
PM: No, there's no contemplation of any fundamental<br />
change in economic policy. Part of the debate that's<br />
been going on about what John Dawkins has said is as<br />
though there is a total dichotomy between a form of<br />
freeing up the economy by deregulation and lowering<br />
tariffs on the one hand and on the other, some forms of<br />
interventionist economic policy. The fact is that over a<br />
period now of nearly 8 years in Government we have<br />
massively reduced protection more than has ever been done<br />
before, a 30% reduction from 13% to 10% on average<br />
manufacturing tariffs. In that way what we've done is to<br />
expose Australian industry more to the wins of<br />
competition which is what is necessary if it is itself<br />
going to be able to be competitive on world markets. But<br />
at the same time as we've done that we have also been<br />
interventionist for instance, when we came to office<br />
after 7 years of conservative government the steel<br />
industry of Australia was going to be closed down. We<br />
said not on your Nelly. We bought in the steel industry<br />
plan. That was interventionist and we've not only saved<br />
the steel industry but we now have the steel industry as<br />
being a massive contributor to our export income. We </p>
<p>also intervened in regard to shipbuilding and heavy<br />
engineering because we believed that there was a place<br />
for that within the framework of our overall commitment<br />
to gradual reductions in protection. So our record is<br />
one not of ideological blinkeredness in which any<br />
particular action which we regarded as necessary couldn't<br />
be put on the table because of some, you know, almost<br />
sort of religious position. As Paul Keating said<br />
yesterday we have been pragmatic about the way we go.<br />
Now we will continue, I've already flagged it, that when<br />
the existing plans for tariff reform, when they come to<br />
their end in ' 92, then we will be committed to further<br />
reform in that direction then.<br />
MURPHY: OK. Today you've announced a timetable for<br />
reform of te: lecommunications and aviation. Now how will<br />
these changes benefit Australians during these admittedly<br />
and you've admitted it very tough times?<br />
PM: Well let's look at telecommunications. For<br />
consumers the benefits will be that they will get it's<br />
estimated up to a 40% reduction in STD prices on major<br />
trunks routes. They'll get more rapid access to new<br />
technologies, they get a choice of telephone company,<br />
they'll get better service quality, they'll get quicker<br />
response time for telephone repair. All in all, quicker<br />
access to the most modern technologies and a reduction in<br />
prices that they pay. But from the point of view of the<br />
economy generally, as you get a more efficient<br />
telecommunications industry that permeates in its<br />
benefits righit through to every part of the total<br />
industrial structure.<br />
MURPHY: And no timed calls for telephones in the home?<br />
PM: We've made it quite clear that there will still be a<br />
requirement to provide untimed local calls.<br />
MURPHY: Yes, but they could be that's in the home but<br />
they could be timed elsewhere?<br />
PM: Well as far as consumers are concerned in regard to<br />
the home situation, it will continue as it is.<br />
MURPHY: Prime Minister, you must be worried about the<br />
progress, or lack of it, in the Uruguay Round of GATT<br />
talks and th~ e attitude of Germany of France in particular<br />
in the EC to' agriculture reform. Are you prepared to<br />
intervene personally, perhaps with others, to end the log<br />
jam? PM: Well bEfore Neal Blewett, my Minister for Trade<br />
Negotiations, left last weekend to go to Geneva for these<br />
discussions I asked him to get some feeling as to whether<br />
there could be any suggestion of involvement by heads of<br />
government and I made it quite clear to Neal that if<br />
that were to be the case then obviously I'd be involved<br />
that would riot be and my I emphasise any lack of </p>
<p>confidence in Dr Blewett, I think he's done a magnificent<br />
job as did his predecessors, Michael Duffy and John<br />
Dawkins. Bul: there may be a feeling that given the<br />
urgency of this matter, because under the schedule now<br />
the final negotiations were to take place in the week<br />
commencing the 3rd of December, and if there's some<br />
feeling that the presence of heads of government may be<br />
necessary or desirable then of course I would be involved<br />
in that.<br />
MURPHY: Have any other heads of government been in touch<br />
with you?<br />
PM: Margaret Thatcher has written to me urging me to<br />
communicate to other heads of government by writing.<br />
That's the most specific recent communication I've had.<br />
MURPHY: So Mrs Thatcher would<br />
PM: Let me make it quite clear when I say that. She was<br />
urging me to write to certain of the heads of European<br />
governments -to urge that they adopt a more constructive<br />
approach in -the area of agricultural trade. She wasn't<br />
saying write to them urging them to come personally to a<br />
meeting but urging me to write to them to take, as I say,<br />
a more constructive attitude.<br />
MURPHY: So she's as concerned about the lack of<br />
progress, the obduracy if you like, as the Cairns Group<br />
led by us?<br />
PM: Yes, and as I said in the Parliament yesterday I've<br />
had my differences with Margaret Thatcher but it would<br />
indeed be churlish of me if I didn't acknowledge the very<br />
considerable commitment she has shown and, may I say, the<br />
courage also in putting it right up to the Germans and<br />
the French and others of the recalcitrant Europeans that<br />
it is necessary to have meaningful and substantial reform<br />
of agriculture in the GATT Round. She has been first<br />
rate in the job she has done in that regard.<br />
MURPHY: Prime Minister, you know all these leaders.<br />
From your wide experience did you think there's any hope<br />
at all of getting the EC to move?<br />
PM: The thing that bloody well exasperates me, Paul, is<br />
this; when I sit down and talk with them they say ' Bob,<br />
we know in economic terms you're right', but then they<br />
then the but., they go on ' but the farmers vote's<br />
important to us'. I mean they're quite straight forward<br />
about it. They accept the economic lunacy of a common<br />
agricultural. policy which adds literally billions of<br />
dollars per annum to their cost and price structure and<br />
which is not: an efficient way of looking after the<br />
poorest of agricultural producers. They acknowledge all<br />
that but thEy say the votes are important. That upsets<br />
me terribly. </p>
<p>MURPHY: So they're not going to move, are they?<br />
PM: Well I'm not the signs are not propitious, let me<br />
say that. But I think there's going to an enormous<br />
amount of pressure accumulating upon the Europeans in<br />
these days imediately ahead because you see it's not<br />
just a question of agriculture but a number of the<br />
members of the Cairns Group have said if the Europeans<br />
are going to sabotage agreement in regard to agriculture<br />
then they are saying they'll pull out of the whole lot<br />
and there'll be agreements on nothing in areas which are<br />
of importance to the Europeans. So it's not just a<br />
question of agriculture being isolated, the whole Uruguay<br />
Round is really at issue now and it really would be<br />
devastating for the world if this failed and we relapsed<br />
into a much greater increase of protectionism around the<br />
world. No-one wins from that.<br />
MURPHY: No, a trade war between the EC, America and<br />
Japan with the Cairns Group and us principally caught in<br />
the middle?<br />
PM: That's right, it would be devastating for Australia<br />
in particular.<br />
MURPHY: Do you think that will happen, Prime Minister?<br />
PM: Well I hope not and all I can say is that there's no<br />
country, and this is recognised, not just the Prime<br />
Minister of Australia saying it's recognised that no<br />
country has over the period of the last few years and at<br />
this moment, has done or is doing more to avert that<br />
outcome than is Australia.<br />
MURPHY: Prime Minister, thanks very much indeed for<br />
speaking to PM.<br />
PM: Thank you very much, Paul.<br />
