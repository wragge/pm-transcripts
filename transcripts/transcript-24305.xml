    <content><![CDATA[<p>Today, around the nation, we mark the completion of Australia’s longest war and honour the men and women who served in Afghanistan on Operation Slipper.</p>
<p>Operation Slipper saw the deployment of more than 34,500 Australian men and women from the Australian Defence Force personnel, the Australian Federal Police, and other agencies.</p>
<p>In the course of the Afghanistan campaign, 41 Australians were killed and 263 wounded. Hundreds more have unseen wounds.</p>
<p>Their mission is over, but our mission to stand with the veterans continues.</p>
<p>Australia’s contributions in Kabul, Uruzgan, Kandahar and Helmand, at other bases throughout the Middle East and aboard the ships of the Royal Australian Navy, have been significant.</p>
<p>Australians fight for peoples’ right to live their own lives and to make their own choices free from fear and free from terror.</p>
<p>Australia’s contribution has played a significant role in making Afghanistan and the world a safer and more peaceful place.</p>
<p>Today, we also honour the families of those who deployed, acknowledging it is they who carried you in their hearts and prayers.</p>
<p>As we gather, members of the Australian Defence Force continue to work in the Middle East fighting the death cult in Iraq and training the Afghan army.</p>
<p>We remember them today as they continue to serve in our name.</p>
