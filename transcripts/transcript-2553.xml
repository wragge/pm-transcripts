FOR PRE~ SS PM. No. 31/ 1972<br />
TERRITORIAL SEA AND CONTINENTAL SHELF BILL 1970<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister, the Rt. Hon.<br />
William M~ cMahon, CH, MP<br />
The Territorial Sea and Continental Shelf Bill<br />
1970 was discussed at the normal weekly meeting of the joint<br />
Government Parties. Three aspects of the Bill were discus-sed:<br />
The progress made between the Commonwealth and the<br />
States relating to the matters to be discussed<br />
at the United Nations Law of the Sea Conference,<br />
possibly in 1973.<br />
The report of the Senate Select Committee on<br />
Offshore Petroleum Resources. Some of the<br />
conclusions of the Select Committee dealing<br />
solely with the petroleum legislation were<br />
discussed. These have been referred to the<br />
Standing Committee of the Australian Minerals<br />
Council and will be on the agenda for the<br />
Council's next meeting.<br />
The Constitutional aspects which were raised in the<br />
Senate Committee report. These will be referred<br />
to the next meeting of the Standing Committee of<br />
Attorneys-General by the Commonwealth Attorney-<br />
General. The Prime minister has written to State Premiers<br />
on the Senate Select Committee report and the U~ N Conference on<br />
the Law of the C'ea. He indicated arrangements which were in<br />
hand or available for full discussion and consultation on these<br />
matters. After lengthy discussion in which varying views were<br />
expressed, the parties agreed it was important to proceed on<br />
these lines of consultation with the States in an endeavour to<br />
resolve the Constitutional problems as early as practicable.<br />
In the meantime, no action will be taken on the Bill.<br />
There was a general desire to ensure that the problem<br />
of Constitutional jurisdiction be resolved, particularly in view<br />
of its wide-ranging implications and the many matters which arise<br />
in this field, but it was also the general desire that this should<br />
be resolved by conzu2I. tation and co-operation.<br />
