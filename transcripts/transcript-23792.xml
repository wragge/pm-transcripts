    <content><![CDATA[<p>Thank you so much, Andrew. Itâs lovely to be here at the Taj Hotel, one of the truly magnificent hotels of the world. And yes, I have been here before. Back in 1981 I spent three months as a backpacker roaming around India â this mysterious, fascinating, enthralling sub-continent, this world in one country â and I spent a lot of time in third-class compartments of railway carriages, Iâd spent a lot of time in two rupee a night hotels and I thought, âIâm going to have to treat myselfâ. So, I came here to the Taj Hotel and I had the best lunch this hotel could provide and Iâm sure that the breakfast weâre about to enjoy will be no less splendid than the lunch I had here 33 years ago.</p>
<p>India has changed enormously over the last 33 years. I can remember on my first day in Mumbai watching a bullock cart take material into a nuclear power station. Well, 33 years on, there arenât that many bullock carts left in urban India, and the power stations â the nuclear power stations â are more sophisticated than ever.</p>
<p>Australia still doesnât have nuclear power stations, but the fact of the matter is this is a country which has amazed the world over the last few decades with its growth and its development â the worldâs second most populous country; on purchasing power terms, the worldâs third largest economy, clearly, the emerging democratic superpower of the world and a country with which Australia has long and warm ties.</p>
<p>The purpose of this trip, as far as Iâm concerned, is to acknowledge the importance of India in the wider world, acknowledge the importance of India to Australiaâs future, to let the Government and the people of India know what Australia has to offer India and the wider world for our part, and to build on those stronger foundations.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Modi has said that India is open. He hasnât used the phrase âOpen for Businessâ, but he said, âCome, make in Indiaâ, and I think that that phrase, âCome, make in Indiaâ, is very close in spirit and in intent to the phrase I have used of our country, Australia, that we are âOpen for Businessâ.</p>
<p>So there is a lot to do â a very great deal to do. I think there have been times when we have focused on opportunities elsewhere in our region. Iâm not saying that there arenât lots of opportunities elsewhere in our region, but there is an abundance of opportunities here in India. I am determined to make the most of them, I know all of you are determined to make the most of them and I look forward to working very closely with you and with our Indian interlocutors over the next two days. Letâs enjoy our breakfast and enjoy our company.</p>
