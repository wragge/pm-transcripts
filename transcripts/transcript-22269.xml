    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Australian Government has now settled the composition of its contribution to the Netherlands-led Provincial Reconstruction Team (PRT) in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>  Following extensive consultation with the Governments of the Netherlands and Afghanistan, Australia will contribute approximately 240 ADF personnel.</p>
<p> Australia's contribution, to be known as the Reconstruction Task Force (RTF), will work on reconstruction and community-based projects as part of Australia's commitment to assisting Afghanistan achieve a stable and secure future.</p>
<p>  The Australian contribution will also include skills training for the local population to ensure the benefits of the deployment continue long after our personnel have returned home.</p>
<p>  The Australian commitment with the Netherlands in Oruzgan province in southern Afghanistan will form part of the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force's (ISAF's) Stage III expansion into southern Afghanistan which begins in the latter half of this year.</p>
<p>I am also pleased to announce that the deployment of two Chinook (CH-47D) helicopters will be extended until April 2007 to support the RTF and the Netherlands-led PRT.  The Chinooks will conduct airlift support and aeromedical evacuations in support of the ISAF mission.</p>
<p>These announcements further demonstrate the Australian Government's continuing commitment to Afghanistan's reconstruction and stabilisation and are in addition to development-aid funding.</p>
<p>Australia has contributed  $110 million since 2001 to assist reconstruction and development in Afghanistan.  Earlier this year, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, The Hon. Alexander Downer MP announced an additional $55 million in aid through to June 2007, which is part of an indicative $150 million that Australia has committed over the next five years.  </p>
