STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
ABORIGINAL AND TORRES STRAIT ISLANDER LAND FUND<br />
Today I introduced into the House of Representatives a Bill to establish a<br />
national Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land Furfd and the Indigenous<br />
Land Coiporation.<br />
Late last year we enacted the native title legislation in response to the High<br />
Court's historic Mabo decision. That legislation gave effect to the Court's<br />
recognition that Australia's indigenous people owned the country before<br />
European settlement, and were dispossessed, often violently, of their land. It<br />
also provided for the validation of existing interests which may be invalid<br />
because of the existence of native title. In a real sense, the Government<br />
legislated for all Australians.<br />
The native title legislation is fundamental to the process of addressing<br />
dispossession, and will benefit greatly those people who have been able to<br />
maintain a connection with their land sufficient to prove native title.<br />
Unfortunately, this will be a very small proportion of Aboriginal people,<br />
because the majority have been forced from their traditional lands.<br />
The purpose of this Bill is to enable indigenous people to acquire land, and to<br />
manage and maintain it in a sustainable way to provide economic,<br />
environmental, social and cultural benefits.<br />
The Bill is built on a foundation of input from a wide range of interests,<br />
including State and Territory Governments, farming, industrial, environmental<br />
and church organisations. In particular, I ensured peak indigenous interests<br />
were fully consulted, and were directly involved in the formulation of the<br />
Government's proposals. The Bill I introduced today contains a number of<br />
provisions which are directly attributable to my discussions with indigenous<br />
interests.<br />
The Bill establishes a Land Fund to receive monies from which it will make<br />
allocations to the Indigenous Land Corporation for land acquisition and<br />
management. We have already allocated $ 200 million to the Fund in this<br />
year's Budget. The Bill provides continuing allocations of $ 121 million<br />
indexed in terms of 1994 dollars for a further nine. years. Thereafter the fund<br />
will be self-sustaining. </p>
<p>The new Corporation will be an independent and commercially oriented<br />
statutory authority, with a dedicated focus on land matters, and specialised<br />
expertise in land and environmental management.<br />
The Corporation will advance the cause of self-determination by providing<br />
indigenous people with greater access to the land and its resources and will<br />
be controlled by indigenous people. At least five of the proposed seven<br />
members must be Aboriginal people or Torres Strait Islanders.<br />
The Corporation will prepare a national Indigenous Land Strategy based on<br />
regional strategies covering three to five-year periods, and regional<br />
organisations will be involved in planning at the local level. Given the<br />
extensive indigenous land holdings in remote areas of the country, the<br />
Corporation will provide a vehicle for ensuring that land management and<br />
sustainability issues are given much greater focus on indigenous owned<br />
lands. This will benefit indigenous landholders directly, but will also have<br />
significant spin-offs for the nation as a whole.<br />
The Corporation will receive payments from the Land Fund to enable it to<br />
undertake its functions. However, to ensure a smooth transition, ATSIC will<br />
retain its land acquisition and management functions and budget for the next<br />
three years. ATSIC will also be undertaking the day to day administration of<br />
the Fund.<br />
This legislation prohibits the claiming of land acquired by the Indigenous<br />
Land Corporation under the Northern Territory Land Rights Act,. but does not<br />
prevent the conversion of p~ storal leases to native title under the Native Title<br />
Act. The Government is committed to redressing Aboriginal and Torres Strait<br />
Islander disadvantage, and in particular to formulating a comprehensive<br />
response to the Mabo decision. The Bill introduced today is an integral part<br />
of this response, and its most financially significant element. It acknowledges<br />
that the economic, social and cultural marginalisation still endured by<br />
indigenous people can be traced to their dispossession. In a further stage of<br />
our response to the Mabo decision, the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation<br />
and ATSIC are undertaking consultations with a view to advising the<br />
Government on institutional and structural changes which will assist in<br />
remedying indigenous dispossession.<br />
Through the social justice measures, the Government is working towards<br />
establishing a new relationship between Australia's indigenous peoples and<br />
the wider community, a relationship in which Aboriginal and Torres Strait<br />
Islander culture is to be protected and valued, and indigenous people<br />
participate fully in Australian economic life.<br />
CANBERRA JUNE, .1994 </p>
<p>MAIN FEATURES OF THE ABORIGINAL AND TORRES STRAIT<br />
ISLANDER LAND FUND BILL<br />
Background In 1992 the High Court in its Mabo decision recognised that<br />
Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people owned much of the<br />
Australian continent before European settlement<br />
The Commonwealth Government enacted the Native Titl Act 1993 to<br />
give legislative recognition to the High Court's decision<br />
To prove native title, indigenous people must be able to demonstrate<br />
a continuing connection with the land<br />
Because most Indigenous people were dispossessed of their land,<br />
only a small proportion will be able to prove native title<br />
The Government is therefore establishing the Land Fund as part of a<br />
broader response to the Mabo decision in recognition of the<br />
dispossession of indigenous people.<br />
Purpose of the Land Fund<br />
The Land Fund will provide monies to enable Aboriginal and Torres<br />
Strait Islander people to acquire and maintain land in a sustainable<br />
way to provide economic, environmental, social and cultural benefits<br />
The majority of monies allocated to the Fund will be Invested, so that<br />
after ten years the Fund will be self sustaining<br />
The Fund will provide money to a new Indigenous Land Corporation,<br />
and for a transitional period, to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait<br />
Islander Commission, to enable the Corporation and the Commission<br />
to purchase land for indigenous people and to assist them to manage<br />
and maintain land.<br />
Structure and Funding of the Land Fund<br />
The Government Is providing $ 200 million to the Fund for 1994-95 and<br />
$ 121 million, Indexed In term of 1994-95 dollars for the following 9<br />
years the total allocations over 10 years will be $ 1 .463 billion<br />
after allowing for outlays, the Fund Is expected to reach $ 1.1<br />
billion in $ 1 994-95 dollars ( or $ 1.26 billion In nominal terms) after<br />
years, assuming a real return on investments of 4% per annum<br />
The Indigenous Land Corporation will receive from the Fund<br />
million In 1994-95, $ 24 million, indexed In terms of 1994-95 dollars for<br />
1995-96 and 1996-97, and $ 45 million Indexed In terms of 1994-95<br />
dollars for a further seven years thereafter </p>
<p>After ten years, the Indigenous Land Corporation will receive the<br />
returns, after inflation, on the investments of the Fund<br />
it Is expected that this will be about $ 45 million in 1994-95 dollars<br />
ATSIC will retain the $ 21 million it currently spends on land<br />
acquisition and management In 1994-95 and will be paid an<br />
equivalent amount from the Land Fund In 1995-96 and 1996-97.<br />
The Indigenous Land Corporation<br />
* The Indigenous Land Corporation is being established to provide a<br />
specialised focus and expertise on indigenous land Issues<br />
The Corporation will be responsible for purchasing land for the<br />
purpose of granting it to the indigenous corporations and providing<br />
grants to such corporations for the purpose of purchasing land<br />
-land may be purchased to provide for economic, environmental,<br />
social and cultural benefits<br />
The Corporation will place particular emphasis on the sustainable<br />
management of Indigenous held land ( including land bought before<br />
the establishment of the Land Fund)<br />
-generally It will do this by entering Into agreements with the land<br />
holders<br />
-It may also make grants or loans for land management purposes<br />
The Corporation will be required to adopt sound land and<br />
environmental management practices; to directly Involve indigenous<br />
land holders in land management activities; and to act In accordance<br />
with sound business principles when operating on a commercial<br />
basis -it will also be required to attempt to maximise the employment of<br />
indigenous people and to use goods and services provided by<br />
indigenous people<br />
The Corporation may establish subsidiaries to undertake some of Its<br />
functions -for example the Corporation could establish subsidiaries to<br />
undertake Its functions In a particular area or region<br />
The Corporation will be required to develop national and regional<br />
strategies for its operations In consultation with relevant Indigenous<br />
Interests The Corporation will be headed by a seven person Board of whom at<br />
least 5 must be indigenous people.<br />
Purchase of land In the Northern Territory<br />
* Land purchased by the Corporation in the Northern Territory will not<br />
be available for claim under the AboriginaiLand Rights ( Northern<br />
Territory) Act 1976 </p>
<p>this will ensure that there is not a significant increase in pastoral<br />
properties claimed under that Act before claims cease in 1997<br />
this will not preclude conversion of such properties to native title<br />
ATSIC moneys will continue to be available for the purchase of<br />
properties in the Northern Territory without restriction on claims<br />
under the Land Rights Act.<br />
