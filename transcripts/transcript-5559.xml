PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA TUESDAY, 31 MARCH 1981<br />
SIR ALEXANDER DOWNER<br />
I was greatly saddened to learn of the death of a great<br />
Australian, Sir Alexander Downer.<br />
0 When I came into Parliament Sir Alexander had been a Member<br />
for the South Australian electorate of Angas since 1949.<br />
He became the Minister for Immigration in 1958 serving in<br />
that office with distinction during a period of expansion<br />
until 1963.<br />
From 1964 until 1972 he was Australia's High Commissioner<br />
in London, winning great credit for his role in ma intaining<br />
and developing the relationship between Australia and<br />
Britain during' a" period in which Britain was entering the<br />
European-Community.<br />
I always valued my friendship with Alexander Downer.<br />
Tamie and I join with Australians everywhere in extending<br />
our deepest sympathy to Lady Downer and her family.<br />
