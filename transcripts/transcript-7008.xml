    <content><![CDATA[<p> 29 September 1986 </p>
<p>The Government has decided to accord a State Funeral to Sir Robert Helpmann in recognition of his distinguished contributions to Australia as a dancer, actor, producer, director and choreographer.</p>
<p>In extending my sympathies to Sir Robert's family yesterday, I said that he had been a true achiever in his field and a fine ambassador for Australia who had helped to demonstrate to the world the diversity of our talents and our capabilities as a nation.</p>
<p>I also said that in that sense, he had made a tremendous contribution to ballet and theatre internationally.</p>
<p>The State Funeral would be a suitable mark of respect to a man who contributed so much.</p>
<p>The Service will be held at St Andrew's Cathedral, Sydney on Thursday 2 October 1986 at 2. l5pm followed by a cremation at the Northern Suburbs Crematorium.</p>
