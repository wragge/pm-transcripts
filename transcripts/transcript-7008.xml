    <content><![CDATA[<p>Â 29 September 1986Â </p>
<p>The Government has decided to accord a State Funeral to SirÂ Robert Helpmann in recognition of his distinguished contributionsÂ to Australia as a dancer, actor, producer, director andÂ choreographer.</p>
<p>In extending my sympathies to Sir Robert's family yesterday, IÂ said that he had been a true achiever in his field and a fineÂ ambassador for Australia who had helped to demonstrate to theÂ world the diversity of our talents and our capabilities as aÂ nation.</p>
<p>I also said that in that sense, he had made a tremendousÂ contribution to ballet and theatre internationally.</p>
<p>The State Funeral would be a suitable mark of respect to a manÂ who contributed so much.</p>
<p>The Service will be held at St Andrew's Cathedral, Sydney onÂ Thursday 2 October 1986 at 2. l5pm followed by a cremation at theÂ Northern Suburbs Crematorium.</p>
