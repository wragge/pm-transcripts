    <content><![CDATA[<p>I was saddened to hear earlier today of the death of Mr Kevin Hart MBE, known by all Australians as Pro Hart.</p>
<p> Pro Hart was a great Australian artist whose outback landscapes are instantly recognisable by art lovers all around the world.  Not only will he be remembered as one of our finest painters but also for the mark he made in sculpture and through his book illustrations.  He made a wonderful contribution to art and culture in Australia, enhancing its profile on the world stage.  His appointment as a Member of the Order of the British Empire in 1976 is testimony to this.</p>
<p> Pro loved the bush and the outback, particularly his home town of Broken Hill.  He also loved his fellow Australians and his generosity of spirit towards them is legendary.</p>
<p> He will be sadly missed by all Australians for the richness and vibrancy he brought to the cultural scene in Australia.  He will live on through his art and through all those he touched during his lifetime.</p>
<p> Pro is survived by his wife Raylee and his five children.</p>
