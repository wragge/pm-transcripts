FOR MEDIA SUNDAY, ' 27 SEPTEMBER, 1981<br />
LAUNCHING OF DEAFNESS AWARENESS WEEK<br />
1981 is the International Year of Disabled Persons and this<br />
gives an added significance to Deafness Awareness Week.<br />
Eight hundred thousand people in Australia have impaired hearing,<br />
and I believe there is a growing'awareness of the difficulties<br />
which deaf people face in everyday living.<br />
The community has a responsibility to understand the special needs<br />
of all groups_ of disabled persons and so far as possible, to<br />
make the kinds of arrangements which enable disabled persons<br />
to live normal lives.<br />
The Australian Caption Centre, which will give deaf people<br />
access to tEelevision programmes by means of sub-titles is a<br />
good example of the kind of initiatives we need.<br />
The Caption Centre will become operational during next year and<br />
it will open to people with impaired hearing a dimension on<br />
life that most of us take for granted.<br />
The Commonwealth Government is providing over $ 620,000 this year<br />
for the Caption Centre , and this grant is a good example of the<br />
Government's commitment to do everything it can to assist disabled<br />
persons with the opportunities and services they require.<br />
This year's Commonwealth Budget in fact allocates more than<br />
$ 1.1 billion for various programmes and projects to assist<br />
disabled and handicapped people throughout Australia and I am<br />
sure that all Australians would agree that disabled and<br />
handicapped persons deserve this level of support.<br />
The purposq of National Deafness Awareness Week is not to raise<br />
money, but to raise our level of care and understanding for<br />
people who cannot hear.<br />
I hope that the community will take advantage of this week to<br />
learn more about the nature of deafness, and how certain aspects<br />
of deafness may be cured, prevented or alleviated.<br />
