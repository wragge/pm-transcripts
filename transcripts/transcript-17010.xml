    <content><![CDATA[<p>Prime Minister Kevin Rudd today officially opened the $27.8 million Darwin Radiation Oncology facility.</p>
<p>To be known as the Alan Walker Cancer Care Centre, the facility means cancer patients in the Northern Territory will no longer have to travel to Adelaide to undertake their radiation treatment.</p>
<p>Minister for Health Aging, Nicola Roxon said $19 million was provided by the Rudd Government for construction of the Radiation Oncology facility, with a further $8.8 million being provided for fit out and equipment.</p>
<p>The first of the two state of the art "linear accelerator" machines for the unit has been installed and is currently undergoing preparations for precision use. The facility is expected to start taking appointments in March, with the first patient to use the facility due in April.</p>
<p>The facility has capacity for two linear accelerator bunkers, a treatment area for patients, clinic facilities for patient consultation and examination, office and support facilities, and access to car parking.</p>
<p>NT Minister for Health Kon Vatskalis said the Territory Government was also pleased to provide some funding for a small chemotherapy ward at the same site.</p>
<p>An agreement with Royal Adelaide Hospital will ensure specialist radiation staff, including radiation oncologists and registrars are available to staff the facility.</p>
<p>Member for Solomon, Damian Hale said the previous Federal Government failed for 12 years to live up to the promise of a local Oncology facility.</p>
<p>"The Rudd Government is proud to deliver this vital service to Territorians," he said.</p>
<p>This project is one of a number of major investments the Rudd Government has made to improve health services in the Northern Territory, including:</p>
<p>     * $18.6 million for an accommodation complex of 50 units for people who need to travel and stay in Darwin when receiving treatment at RDH;</p>
<p>     * $27.8 million for Flinders University to run a full medical program in Darwin;</p>
<p>     * $4.3 million for Royal Darwin Hospital to reconfigure the Royal Darwin Hospital Emergency Department and for new paediatric staff;</p>
<p>     * $1.6 million for two new operating theatres and new surgical equipment at Royal Darwin Hospital;</p>
<p>     * $10 million for construction of a Super Clinic at Palmerston; and</p>
<p>     * Funding for a Cancer Breast Care Nurse at Royal Darwin Hospital.</p>
<p>As well as attending the official launch of the radiation oncology unit, the Prime Minister, with the Health Minister, Minister for Rural Health, Member for Solomon, and NT Health Minister, also met with territory doctors and health professionals at Royal Darwin Hospital to discuss ways to improve the nation's health system.</p>
<p>Almost 100 consultations have now been held around the nation to discuss the ideas in the National Health and Hospitals Reform Commission's final report.</p>
<p>Today's meeting gave local health professionals an opportunity to give their perspective on the Commission's 123 recommendations, which would change health care at all levels.</p>
<p>All Australians are also able to contribute to the national debate on our health system via the yourHealth.gov.au website, which also has copies of the reform reports.</p>
