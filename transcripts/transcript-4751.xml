PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR PRESS 9 JULY 1978<br />
1USTRALIAN BICENTENNIAL 1988<br />
The year l988 ; l21 mark the 200th anniversary of the First<br />
European Sett-ament in Australia. The Commonwealth Government<br />
has decided to develop, in close collaboration with the States,<br />
plans for a z-ajor program of celebrations to mark the occasion.<br />
The Governmpez= believes that the celebrations should have<br />
meaning f or all Australians. As a first step towards this<br />
goal, State Gocvernments have agreed to send officials to<br />
discuss the celebrations.<br />
Another important task will be to secure international<br />
participation in the celebrations. With this in mind, Australia<br />
has maintained over recent years an active membership of the<br />
Bureau of International Expositions, the world body which<br />
regulates international participation in major celebrations<br />
of this kind. As part of its plans to encourage international<br />
participation, the Government has appointed Mr Harry M. Miller<br />
as Special Adviser to present Australia's case at the annual<br />
meeting of the Bureau's Administrative Council on 5 July in<br />
Paris. </p>
