FOR MEDIA 3 APRIL 1979<br />
CONDOLENCE MOTION: YANG DI-PERTUAN AGONG OF MALAYSIA<br />
It is my said duty to inform the House that His Majesty,<br />
the Paramount Ruler of Malaysia died suddenly during the<br />
afternoon of 29 March.<br />
Honourable Members will be aware of the unique provisions<br />
in the Malaysian constitution for the rotation of this<br />
office among the nine rulers of States within the Federation<br />
of Malaysia. The Paramount Ruler the Head of State of<br />
Malaysia is elected by his fellow rulers for a<br />
five-year term, after which he resumes his position as a<br />
ruler in his home State.<br />
Australia's ties with Malaysia have been particularly<br />
friendly as befits those with a fellow member of the<br />
Commonwealth in our region. Therefore, it is with special<br />
sadness that we note in this Chamber the passing of this<br />
distinguished Head of State.<br />
His late Majesty was Sultan of the State of Kelantan<br />
before he was sworn in as the sixth paramount ruler<br />
on 21 September 1975. His Majesty was born on 10 December, 1917,<br />
and studied in Kelantan and Penang before undertaking<br />
further studies in England. He returned to Kelantan in<br />
1939 and served in the Kelantan Civil Service as private<br />
secretary to his father the then Sultan of Kelantan.<br />
His Majesty served in a number of posts in Kelantan until he<br />
became Sultan in July 1960, on the death of his father.<br />
As Sultan of Kelantan, His Majesty took an active interest<br />
in the advancement of his State and his wide experience<br />
ably equipped him for election to the office of Paramount Ruler.<br />
I should like to record the deep sympathy of the House for<br />
the sad loss sustained by the Government and people of<br />
Malaysia in the sudden death of His Majesty. I also ask<br />
that you arrange to inform His Excellency, the High Commissioner<br />
for Malaysia of the views expressed in this House today.<br />
