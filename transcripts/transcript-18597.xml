    <content><![CDATA[<p>From tomorrow and over the coming weeks 3.2 million Australian pensioners will receive more money in their bank accounts to help them make ends meet.</p>
<p>Across Australia a total of about $707 million in household assistance will be going out to pensioners before the carbon price starts on 1 July.</p>
<p>Full and part pensioners will receive upfront household assistance payments of $250 for singles or $380 for couples combined. These payments will be paid straight into pensioners' bank accounts over the coming few weeks.</p>
<p>From March next year pensioners will receive ongoing annual household assistance that will increase to keep up with the cost of living.</p>
<p>We know that pensioners have the least room to move in their budgets, which is why they will get the most help, with many pensioners coming out ahead.</p>
<p>About 2.1 million pensioners who are on the maximum rate of the pension will be better off by $134 a year for singles and $201 a year for couples on average - a buffer of more than 65 per cent against the expected impact of the carbon price.</p>
<p>And 93 per cent of pensioner households will be at least 20 per cent better off thanks to these new payments.</p>
<p>The Gillard Government is providing household assistance payments to millions of Australians. More than 1.6 million families have already received or will soon receive household assistance of up to $110 for each child in families receiving Family Tax Benefit Part A and up to $69 for families receiving Family Tax Benefit Part B.</p>
<p>Self-funded retirees, veterans, students and other eligible payment recipients are set to receive increases in their payments before the end of June.</p>
<p>And in July Australian workers will benefit from new tax cuts.</p>
<p>This new pension payment is on top of the historic pension rise and improved indexation arrangements this Labor Government delivered in September 2009. Since then the pension has increased by $154 per fortnight for singles and $156 per fortnight for couples combined.</p>
<p>Only Labor will deliver for pensioners because we understand how tough it can be to make ends meet.</p>
<p>In contrast, Tony Abbott and the Liberals will hit you in the hip pocket by clawing back all of this new financial support.</p>
<p>Pensioners can find out more by visiting australia.gov.au/householdassistance or calling 132 300.</p>
