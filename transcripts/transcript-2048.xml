SECOND VISIT TO U. S. 1969<br />
WASHINGTON<br />
TELEVISION INTERVIEWS GIVEN BY THE PRIME<br />
MINISTER, MR JOHN GORTON AT BLAIR HOUSE 8 MAY 1969_<br />
CHANNEL 7 NETWORK ( Interviewer Norman Bennell)<br />
* JC~ Q. PM: Q. PM: Q. PM: Q. PM: Firstly, Prime Minister, I wonder what assurances you had<br />
this morning from your talks about the future of the Fill?<br />
Well, we gathered a whole lot of technical information<br />
and about the intentions of the United States Air Force. I think<br />
this will be of great advantage to our own Defence Department<br />
when we return to Australia.<br />
Did you ever feel before these talks that the Fill might be<br />
in jeopardy from Australia's point of view?<br />
Well, one felt that there might be a problem and we wanted<br />
to go into it pretty carefully to see whether that problem was<br />
likely to develop or not. At the moment I would think it would not,<br />
but we want to study all the information, the technical information,<br />
the facts about intentions, the pexbd of use and all that kind of<br />
thing. Turning to your talks in general, I wonder if you could sum<br />
up the success of them2<br />
I think they were successful. I think that the statement made<br />
by the President himself was of great value to Australia and New<br />
Zealand as a reaffirmation by the new President and the new<br />
Administration of the ANZUS Treaty as it applies to Australia,<br />
New Zealand and the United States. You will remember the<br />
phrase taken from the Treaty itself which he used. It says nobody<br />
should think that Australia, New Zealand or the United States stands<br />
alone. I think that was very helpful and very reassuring. I<br />
believe the talks were successful beyond that point. Though I think<br />
I would prefer to wait to make a report to Parliament before I go<br />
into any further details.<br />
Your own impression of the President this time?<br />
Well, it was the same as last time. I liked him very much.<br />
I felt he was a strong man, a man with a sense of history and<br />
the requirements of history, and I feel he would not be a man to<br />
sacrifice what he thought was historically right for some ephemeral<br />
immediate political popularity. /' 2 </p>

Is this why you use the term that yrq' would go<br />
Waltzing Matilda with himn?<br />
No. You see I never did say we would go Waltzing<br />
Matilda with him. If you actually look at what I said, I said that<br />
wherever the United States or the United Kingdom or any other<br />
country is seeking to resist aggression, whatever joint effort is<br />
made to try and improve the living standards and the material<br />
well-being and the spiritua I well-being of the peoples of the world,<br />
then we'd go awaltzing, and indeed, this is what we have done<br />
throughout our history with the United Kingdom in two World<br />
Wars, in Malaya, in Korea, now in Vietnam, in the Confrontation<br />
and in trying to assist the general risie in living standards. This,<br />
I think, is a policy which can be very difficult to say was wrong.<br />
Q. Returning to Vietnam, Sir, did you find from these<br />
talks anything hopeful for a settlement of the situation?<br />
PM: I think that I couldn't say that I did find that. But there<br />
is a feeling there may be a possibility in the future some time of<br />
some hope but I don't think it is much stronger than that.<br />
Q. Thank you very much, Sir.<br />
CHANNEL 9 NETWORK ( Interviewer Michael Ramsden)<br />
Mr. Prime Minister, four weeks ago you said of<br />
Mr. Nixon, " I like the guy". How do you feel about him now?<br />
My liking and respect has, if anything, grown very<br />
much. Previously we met for a comparatively short time. On this<br />
occasion, we met for much longer and the talks were far more<br />
wide-ranging, and as they progressed my liking and respect for<br />
President Nixon increased.<br />
Your " Waltzing Matilda" comment at the White House<br />
Dinner. Is this " an all the way with LBJ" type remark?<br />
Perhaps I can best answer that by quoting from the<br />
transcript of the dinner and of what I said.<br />
" And this is that for our part speaking for Australians,<br />
wherever the United States is resisting aggression,<br />
wherever the United States or the United Kingdom or<br />
any other country is seeking to ensure that there will<br />

be a chance for the free expression of the spirit<br />
i of man, wherever there is a joint attempt to<br />
improve not only the material but the spiritual<br />
standards of life of the peoples of the world we<br />
will go Waltzing Matilda with you."<br />
Now this is in fact what Australia has always done. She has with<br />
the United Kingdom fought in the First World War to resist the<br />
overrunning of Europe. With the United Kingdom and other allies<br />
later in the Second World War she took the same course. In<br />
Indonesia, with confrontation between Indonesia and Malaysia, she<br />
was there. In the Malayan emergency she was there, in Korea she<br />
E was there and in Vietnam she is still there. And I believe that not<br />
only in resisting aggression but also in positive action to try to<br />
improve the general standards of living materially and spiritually<br />
of the peoples of the worlds, Australia should be there. And that is<br />
what I meant when I said, " We will go Waltzing Matilda with you".<br />
Q. Sir, how conscious have you found the Nixon<br />
Administration of the fact that Britain is pulling out of South East<br />
Asia and the gap there has to be filled?<br />
PM. Well, they are very conscious that Britain is pulling<br />
out of South East Asia and I found the Administration generally<br />
extraordinarily appreciative of Australia's decision to assist to the<br />
limit of her capacity and particularly that that decision was made<br />
without asking for anything in return, was made by Australia as its<br />
own decision, without saying that this was conditional on something<br />
else. They were quite strongly appreciative of this.<br />
-4 Q. Mr. Prime Minister, you have now had your talks<br />
with the Defence Department about the F-Ill1. What would you say<br />
the odds are about Australia purchasing this plane now?<br />
PM I'm not a racing man. Does " odds on" mean that it is<br />
very, very likely to happen?<br />
Q. Yes, I think that is what it means.<br />
PM. Subject to a full examination of all the data, I believe<br />
there is in fact not likely to be a prcblem.<br />
Q. If in the event that we were to take action I know<br />
you are approaching the situation very cautiously is Australia<br />
likely to be penalised in any way financially or do we put this<br />
money in a new venture if we have to? e. / 4 </p>
<p>-4-<br />
PM. Well, it hasn't got anywhere near that stage yet.<br />
People seem to think we are considering the possibility of cancellation<br />
or something like that. We are not doing anything of t he kind. We<br />
are looking at the new data, getting new information about the<br />
intentions of the United States Air Force, the number of aircraft it<br />
will have, the length of time it will be in service with that Air Force,<br />
the question of spare parts. We are looking at that to see whether<br />
there has emerged a problem since the initial arrangement and that<br />
is all. It is not that we say that there is a problem. But we're<br />
looking to make sure there isn't.<br />
Q. One final question, Sir. You've invited Mr. Nixon to<br />
Australia. When do you think the visit will take place and what sort<br />
of a welcome would you like Australians to give him?<br />
PM. I would like to see Australians give him the warmest<br />
welcome that was possible. I wouldn't say when the visit would take<br />
place because, after all, he is a new President and he has a very<br />
heavy programme. But at the latest I would say 1971 and possibly<br />
before.<br />
Q. Thank you very much, Sir.<br />
AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING COMMISSION ( interviewer Peter Barnett)<br />
0Q. Mr. Prime Minister, at the White House Dinner the<br />
other night you spoke in terms of going Waltzing Matilda with your<br />
friends. What did you mean by that?<br />
PM. Can I quote from the transcript that was made that<br />
night because I think it will make it pretty clear what I meant. I<br />
said: " And for our part speaking for Australians,<br />
AICLZwherever the United States is resisting<br />
aggression, or the United Kingdom or any<br />
other country is seeking to ensure that there<br />
will be a chance for the free expression of<br />
the spirit of man from within himself and not<br />
from dictatorship; wherever there is a joint<br />
attempt to improve not only the material but<br />
the spiritual standards of life of the peoples<br />
of the world, then Sir, we will go Waltzing<br />
Matilda with you. </p>
<p>L39 z<br />
( contd.) Q.<br />
PPM. Q. PM. Q. PM. PM. And what I meant by that was that Australia would continue to do<br />
what she has done throughout her history and that is to join with the<br />
United Kingdom or the United States or the United Nations in attempts<br />
to prevent aggression from being successful either in the First<br />
World War, the fascist aggression of Hitler, confrontation in<br />
Indonesia, the Korean war, ghe Vietnam war, the Malayan<br />
emergency this is what we have done. i. just as we have joined<br />
in joint programmes seeking to improve material standards for<br />
peoples of the world and as we have in our own bilateral programmes,<br />
we'll be there. And that is what I meant.<br />
As you leave Washington after your talks with the new<br />
Administration do you feel reassured that the Nixon Government will<br />
have a continuing interest in our part of the world?<br />
Yes, I believe it will.<br />
And in terms of the President himself. You said last<br />
time you liked the guy. What is your assessment this time, having<br />
got to know him better?<br />
That the likL. ing had increased and the respect had very<br />
greatly increased. Australia is a close friend of the United States,<br />
and is a focus of special interest here.<br />
Have you felt that in this trip?<br />
Yes. I felt that there was a special relationship<br />
between the United States Administration and Australia. The feeling<br />
towards Australia was something rather special.<br />
Do you feel that they may take us for granted?<br />
I don't believe there is any risk of that at all.<br />
Laird.<br />
F-1ll? You've just come from the Pentagon. You met Mr.<br />
Gould you tell us anything about your talks regarding the<br />
They were designed to get full data on the intentions of<br />
the United States Air Force itself as to how long they would have their<br />
F-ills in operation, the logistic backing for the spare parts, as to<br />
performance, matters of that kind, in order to discover whether there<br />
was a chance of a problem arising. Not to discuss a problem which<br />
had arisen but to get further information in order to, as I say, be able<br />
to make sure that no problem is likely to arise.<br />
So at this stage it looks as though we would go ahead<br />
with our decision to<br />
Well, I want to go fully into all the data we've got. But<br />
I would say that at this stage it does look that way.<br />
Thank you, Sir.<br />
