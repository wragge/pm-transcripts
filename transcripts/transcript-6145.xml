CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY EMBARGOED UNTIL 10 A. M.<br />
3 U T ALlI 30 JUNE 1983<br />
JUNE 1983 PRIMVE MINISTER<br />
PREMIERS AND MINISTERS<br />
I WELCOME YOU ALL TO THIS THE FIRST PREMIERS' CONFERENCE<br />
THAT I HAVE HAD THE PLEASURE AND PRIVILEGE OF ATTENDING THE<br />
PLEASURE IS IN NO WAY DIMINISHED BY FINDING MYSELF IN THE CHAIR.<br />
IN PARTICULAR, I EXTEND A WELCOME ON YOUR BEHALF TO THE<br />
NEW PREMIER OF WESTERN AUSTRALIA, BRIAN BURKE, WHO, I AM SURE,<br />
WILL SEE MANY CONFERENCES IN THE FUTURE. HE FOLLOWS A LONG<br />
LINE OF WORTHY REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE WEST INCLUDING ONE<br />
ESPECIALLY FAMILIAR TO ME-BERTHAWKE AND,. OF COURSE, MORE<br />
RECENTLY SIR CHARLES COURT.<br />
IN THE UNAVOIDABLE ABSENCE OF MRWRAN WE WELCOME<br />
MR : FERGUSON.<br />
ALSO, THIS IS THE FIRST. CONFERENCE THAT THE TREASURER AND<br />
. MY OTHER MINISTERIAL COLLEAGUES HAVE ATTENDED AND WE<br />
WELCOME THEM<br />
FOR THE REST, I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU ARE ALL EXPERIENCED<br />
IN THIS ARENA BUT I AM SURE YOU WILL PLAY FAIR WITH THE<br />
NEW COMERS,<br />
IT IS, OF COURSE, NOT MY FIRST MEETING WITH YOU IN THIS CHAMBER.<br />
S . THAT DATES BACK TO APRIL DURING THE HISTORIC ECONOMIC SUMMIT. </p>
<p>BEFORE CONTINUING ON THAT LINE. HOWEVER, THERE ARE SOME<br />
PROCEDURAL MATTERS WHICH WE SHOULD CLARIFY. I AM<br />
SUGGESTING THAT THE CONFERENCE BE OPEN TO THE PRESS DURING<br />
THE STATEMENT I AM ABOUT TO MAKE AND DURING YOUR RESPONSES,<br />
WE EXPECT THAT THESE MAY BE OF SOME SUBSTANCE SINCE WE HAVE<br />
TAKEN THE UNUSUAL, BUT VERY DESIRABLE, STEP OF GIVING TO<br />
YOU IN ADVANCE LAST NIGHT IN FACT THE COMMONWEALTH'S<br />
VIEW ON THE PRESENT ECONOMIC SITUATION.<br />
FOLLOWING YOUR RESPONSES I WILL INVITE THE ' TREASURER<br />
TO SUM -UP. FOR THE COMMONWEALTH DEALING WITH THE ECONOMY.<br />
AT THAT POINT, I SUGGEST WE SHOULD GO INTO LOAN COUNCIL<br />
WHICH WILL, AS'USUAL,. BEA MEETING IN PRIVATE,<br />
IS THAT AGREED?<br />
BOT'TH E. TREASURER AND MYSELF WOULD PROPOSE TO ADDRESS<br />
THE ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL SITUATION IN GENERAL TERMS,<br />
LEAVING SPECIFIC: ISSUES TO BE RAISED LATER IN THE<br />
PRIVATE MEETING. I ASSUME THAT ALL OF US WILL PROCEED<br />
ON THAT BASIS, </p>
<p>3.<br />
AS THIS PREMIERS' CONFERENCE AND LOAN COUNCIL IS<br />
THE FIRST SINCE WE TOOK OFFICE, WE DO WISH IT TO BE A<br />
SUCCESS, PARTICULARLY IN TERMS OF MAKING AN<br />
IMPORTANT CONTRIBUTION TO RECOVERY IN THE ECONOMY.<br />
SMY GOVERNMENT SEES THE REACHING OF BROAD UNDERSTANDING<br />
BETWEEN THE COMMONWEALTH AND THE STATES AS BEING<br />
IMPORTANT TO NATIONAL. ECONOMIC RECOVERY. AS I SAID<br />
IN MY ADDRESS TO THE NATIONAL PRESS CLUB ON MONDAY:<br />
" FOR OUR PART, WE ARE APPROACHING THAT<br />
CONFERENCE WITH A DETERMINATION TO MAKE IT,<br />
NOT:: AS -, IT HAS BEEN. FOR . SO MANY YEARS, AN<br />
OCCASION FOR CONFRONTATION AND CONFLICT, . BUT<br />
SFQORiGENUINE CO-OPERATION AND CONSTRUCTIVENESS<br />
STO'iTHE MUTUAL . BENEFIT OF THE NATION AND THE<br />
STATES WHICH CONSTITUTE THE NATION".<br />
STHIS WAS THE SPIRIT OF THE NATIONAL ECONOMIC. SUMMIT<br />
CONFERENCE:-A., SPIRIT THAT WILL BE CARRIED ON BEYOND<br />
THIS PREMIERS CONFERENCE IN THE. PARTICIPATION OF<br />
ALL PREMIERS ON A ROTATING BASIS IN THE DELIBERATIONS<br />
OF THE. ECONOMIC/ PLANNING ADVISORY COUNCIL.<br />
I'M SURE ALL OF US HAVE THE SAME BASIC OBJECTIVES<br />
AND ASPIRATIONS FOR THE AUSTRALIAN ECONOMY. WE ALL<br />
WANT TO SEE A STRONG RECOVERY IN ACTIVITY AND EMPLOYMENT, </p>
<p>-WE WOULD ALL WISH TO SEE A RESTORATION OF ECONOMIC<br />
GROWTH TO RATES, AROUND 5 PERCENT, WHICH WILL GO<br />
FURTHER THAN JUST HALTING THE VERY SHARP RISE IN<br />
UNEMPLOYMENT WHICH OCCURRED IN THIS RECESSION, AND<br />
ACTUALLY BEGIN TO PRODUCE APPRECIABLE FALLS IN<br />
UNEMPLOYMENT OVER TIME.<br />
WHAT EVERY ONE OF US WANTS, IN SHORT, IS A SUSTAINED<br />
ECONOMIC RECOVERY STRENGTHENING IN 1983-84 AND BEYOND,<br />
NOT A " FLASH IN THE PAN" RECOVERY.<br />
THAT MEANS THAT WHILE WE AS GOVERNMENTS CAN<br />
. THROUGH PROVIDING! FISCAL STIMULUS TO THE<br />
ECONOMY:-PLAY A MAJOR ROLE IN ARRESTING THE<br />
DECLINE OF THE ECONOMY, AND CAN BE INSTRUMENTAL<br />
IN BRINGING ABOUT A.: TURNAROUND INTO RECOVERY, WE<br />
MUST THEN BEGIN TO EASE BACK AS RECOVERY SPREADS<br />
TO THE PRIVATE SECTOR.<br />
WE CANNOT HAVE SUSTAINED GROWTH AGAIN WITHOUT A<br />
MAJOR CONTRIBUTION FROM A HEALTHY PRIVATE SECTOR.<br />
ANOTHER KEY TO THE SUSTAINABILITY OF THIS RECOVERY WILL<br />
BE THE EXTENT TO WHICH WE AS AUSTRALIANS CAN, THROUGH<br />
MUTUAL RESTRAINT IN INCOME CLAIMS, AVOID A SURGE IN<br />
INFLATION SUCH AS THOSE WHICH HAVE ABORTED RECOVERIES<br />
IN THE PAST, 5 </p>
<p>MY GOVERNMENT'S EMPHASIS ON A CO-OPERATIVE APPROACH<br />
TO PRICES AND INCOMES POLICY HAS OPENED THE WAY TO<br />
SUCCESSFUL APPLICATION OF SUBSTANTIAL FISCAL STIMULUS<br />
THIS YEAR, BUT CLEARLY WE WOULD BE RASH, TO SAY THE<br />
LEAST. IF THROUGH EXCESSIVE AND EXCESSIVELY PROLONGED<br />
APPLICATION OF STIMULUS, WE PUT TOO MUCH STRAIN ON<br />
THAT POLICY IN ITS FIRST REAL TEST.<br />
THAT SAID, FISCAL STIMULUS PROVIDED BY THE<br />
COMMONWEALTH,. IS ALREADY MAKING A MAJOR CONTRIBUTION<br />
TO RECOVERY. . WE INTEND TO PROVIDE FURTHER STIMULUS IN<br />
1983-84.<br />
WE RECOGNISE. THAT MANY OF THE STATES HAVE EXPERIENCED<br />
DIFFICULT BUDGETARY SITUATIONS DURING THE PAST YEARI<br />
WITH THE RECESSION AND, IN THE EASTERN STATES, THE<br />
VERY SEVERE DROUGHT..<br />
THE DROUGHT ALONE PLACED A BURDEN. ON GOVERNMENT<br />
FINANCES AT ALL LEVELS OF POSSIBLY SEVERAL<br />
HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS. / 6<br />
1 </p>
<p>WE RECOGNISE TOO THAT MANY STATES ARE FACING ANOTHER<br />
DIFFICULT YEAR IN 1983/ 84, EVEN THOUGH AND MY<br />
GOVERNMENT IS NOT CLAIMING THE CREDIT FOR THIS<br />
THE DROUGHT HAS NOW BROKEN AND THE PROSPECT IS<br />
NOW FOR QUITE A GOOD SEASON IN THE RURAL SECTOR<br />
THERE SHOULD ALSO BE A MODERATE RECOVERY IN THE<br />
NON-FARM SECTOR.<br />
WE RECOGNISE THAT IT WILL TAKE SOME TIME BEFORE<br />
IMPROVEMENT IN THE ECONOMY FLOWS THROUGH TO MAKING<br />
A REAL IMPROVEMENT Å“ N: BUDGETARY POSITIONS. I<br />
MUST SAY THAT THIS IS PARTICULARLY THE CASE AT THE<br />
COMMONWEALTH LEVEL WHERE'MAJOR.. COMPONENTS OF OUR<br />
TAX BASE RESPOND TO IMPROVED BUSINESS ACTIVITY ONLY<br />
AFTER VERY. LONG DELAYS.<br />
THE COMPANY TAX IS APRIME EXAMPLE, THE TIME DELAY<br />
BETWEEN IMPROVED COMPANY PROFITS AND THE ADDITIONAL<br />
TAX ACTUALLY BEING RECEIVED BY THE COMMONWEALTH<br />
AVERAGING MORE THAN 18 MONTHS.<br />
I DON T WANT TO FORESHADOW WHAT THE TREASURER HAS<br />
TO SAY EXCEPT TO MAKE. THE POINTS THAT<br />
WE MUST ALL OF-US ACCEPT THAT THERE ARE REAL<br />
LIMITS ON THE FINANCIAL RESOURCES AVAILABLE<br />
TO US; AND </p>
<p>-IF WE WANT THIS ECONOMIC RECOVERY TO LEAD TO<br />
SUSTAINED AND HEALTHY GROWTH IN THE PRIVATE<br />
SECTOR, WE MUST NOT GO BEYOND THOSE LIMITS AND<br />
PLACE EXCESSIVE PRESSURE ON FINANCIAL AND<br />
OTHER MARKETS.<br />
WITHIN THAT CONTEXT WE DO RECOGNISE THE IMPORTANT<br />
ROLE THE STATES HAVE TO PLAY IN BRINGING ABOUT<br />
RECOVERY INDEED WE HAVE PLACED A GREAT DEAL OF<br />
IMPORTANCE ALREADY ON THAT ROLE IN OUR MAJOR JOB<br />
CREATING-INITIATIVES ANNOUNCED IN THE TREASURER'S<br />
MAY STATEMENT.<br />
THE COMMUNITY EMPLOYMENT PROGRAM MARSHALLS COMMONWEALTH<br />
. AND STATE RESOURCES CO-OPERATIVELYI WITHTHE STATES<br />
PLAYING A KEY ROLE IN ENSURING THE : EFFECTIVENESS OF<br />
THE PROGRAM IN CREATING JOBS.<br />
THE GOVERNMENT WILL BE. PROVIDING $ 300 MILLION FOR<br />
PROJECTS UNDER THE COMMUNITY EMPLOYMENT PROGRAM<br />
IN 1983/ 84. TOGETHER WITH: THE-FURTHER $ 100 MILLION<br />
BEIING ALLOCATED FOR CONTINUATION OF THE WAGE PAUSE<br />
PROGRAM, THIS REPRESENTS A VERY SIGNIFICANT INCREASE<br />
OVER THE FUNDS MADE AVAILABLE FOR EMPLOYMENT<br />
CREATION IN 1982/ 83 ($ 100M) S.<br />
r<br />
: r : i<br />
r'<br />
i </p>
<p>8.<br />
-APART FROM THE $ 50 MILLION BEING RESERVED FOR<br />
COMMONWEALTH INITIATED PROJECTS, THESE FUNDS ARE<br />
BEING ALLOCATED BETWEEN THE STATES AND THE<br />
TERRITORIES PRINCIPALLY ON A POPULATION BASIS.<br />
AGAIN, IN THE GOVERNMENT'S MAJOR INITIATIVES IN THE<br />
HOUSING AREA, WE HAVE GIVEN STRONG SUPPORT TO THE<br />
STATE ROLE IN THE PUBLIC HOUSING AREA PARTICULARLY<br />
DIRECT COMMONWEALTH FUNDING FOR PUBLIC HOUSING<br />
WILL BE. INCREASED FROM $ 333 MILLION IN 1982/ 83<br />
TO $ 500 MILLION IN 1983/ 84, AN INCREASE OF<br />
150 PERCENT.<br />
S. DESPITE THE LIMITS IMPOSED BY THE COMMONWEALTH'S OWN<br />
: BUDGETARY POSITION, WE HAVE ALSO RECOGNISED THE NEED<br />
TO CONTINUE PROVIDING ADEQUATE FUNDS FOR STATE<br />
S.. ACTIVITIES GENERALLY.<br />
TOTAL RECURRENT PAYMENTS TO THE STATES . INCLUDING<br />
REVENUE SHARING GRANTS UNDER THE PRESENT FORMULAE,<br />
OTHER GENERAL REVENUE AND SPECIFIC PURPOSE RECURRENT<br />
PAYMENTS ( BUT EXCLUDING PAYMENTS FOR NATURAL DISASTER<br />
RELIEF, FODDER SUBSIDIES, AND SPECIAL BUDGETARY<br />
ASSISTANCE FOR BUSHFIRES AND. MEDICINE), ARE<br />
ESTIMATED TO RISE BY OVER 11 PERCENT IN 1983-84.<br />
S. 19/ 1 </p>
<p>9,<br />
THIS REPRESENTS A RISE OF ABOUT 4 PERCENT IN REAL<br />
TERMS AND COVERS THE BULK OF COMMONWEALTH PAYMENTS<br />
TO THE STATES. WHILE THE INCREASE IN MONEY TERMS<br />
IS LESS THAN LAST YEARj IN REAL TERMS THERE WILL<br />
BE A SIGNIFICANTLY LARGER INCREASE,<br />
SPECIFIC PURPOSE CAPITAL PAYMENTS, EXCLUDING PAYMENTS<br />
FOR NATURAL DISASTER RELIEF, ARE ESTIMATED TO<br />
RISE BY OVER 20.5 PERCENT IN 1983-84, A RISE OF ABOUT<br />
13 PERCENT IN REAL TERMS.<br />
THIS FOLLOWS A STRONG RISE IN TOTAL CAPITAL.<br />
S.: PAYMENTS TO THE STATES IN 1982-83 OF 22.3 PERCENT<br />
S. AND A MASSIVE RISE OF 80.6 PERCENT IN 1982-83 IN<br />
THE BORROWING PROGRAMS OF THE LARGE STATE SEMI-<br />
. GOVERNMENT AUTHORITIES.<br />
THE FUNDS THEREFORE BEING MADE AVAILABLE TO THE STATES<br />
THROUGH RECURRENT AND SPECIFIC PURPOSE CAPITAL PAYMENTS<br />
WILL BE RISING STRONGLY IN REAL TERMS IN 1983-84, EVEN<br />
THOUGH COMMONWEALTH RECEIPTS ( ON THE BASIS OF THE FORWARD<br />
ESTIMATES) ARE EXPECTED TO SHOW A SIGNIFICANT DECLINE IN<br />
REAL TERMS.<br />
I </p>
<p>WE ARE CONCERNED TODAY WITH THE ADDITIONAL AMOUNTS TO BE<br />
MADE AVAILABLE TO THE STATES, IN PARTICULAR THROUGH THE<br />
STATE GOVERNMENT PROGRAM AND FOR BORROWING BY SEMIGOVERNMENT<br />
AUTHORITIES, IN CONSIDERING THOSE AMOUNTS<br />
WE . NEED TO BEAR IN MIND THE STRONG RISES IN REAL TERMS<br />
INVOLVED IN RECURRENT AND SPECIFIC PURPOSE CAPITAL<br />
PAYMENTS AS I HAVE JUST OUTLINED.<br />
BUT WITHIN LIMITS ON OVERALL PUBLIC SECTOR FINANCIAL<br />
RESOURCES WHICH ARE CONSISTENT WITH SUSTAINABLE<br />
RECOVERY WE INTEND TO BE REASONABLE. AND SUPPORTIVE<br />
OF STATE EFFORTS TO PROVIDE SERVICES. AND TO GIVE<br />
SUPPORT TO THE ECONOMY IN THEIR AREAS.<br />
THIS GOVERNMENT'S APPROACH TO THIS CONFERENCE WILL<br />
NOT BE ONE OF TAKE IT OR LEAVE IT.<br />
AS I HAVE INDICATED, OUR APPROACH WILL BE THE SAME<br />
AS WE TOOK TO THE NATIONAL ECONOMIC. SUMMIT CONFERENCE.<br />
WE ALL NEED TO APPROACH THESE DISCUSSIONS IN A<br />
FRANK AND CONSTRUCTIVE SPIRIT, RECOGNISING EACH<br />
OTHER'S PROBLEMS AND CONSTRAINTS,<br />
FOR OUR PARTj WE WILL BE DOING OUR BEST TO ENSURE THAT<br />
THESE DISCUSSIONS COME TO A RESULT WHICH WE CAN ALL<br />
ACCEPT IS A REASONABLE AND ACCEPTABLE BALANCE GIVEN<br />
THE CONSIDERATIONS WHICH WE MUST TAKE INTO ACCOUNT. 11/. </p>
<p>11.<br />
SOME OF YOU HAVE ALREADY INDICATED PUBLICLY YOUR<br />
STATE'S POSITION IN RESPECT OF SOME OF THE MATTERS<br />
WE WILL HAVE UNDER DISCUSSION HERE. I AM SURE THAT<br />
A CLOSE READING OF THE TREASURER'S STATEMENT SPELLING<br />
OUT THE DETAIL OF THE COMMONWEALTH'S PROPOSAL WILL<br />
GIVE SOME CAUSE FOR REFLECTION ON WHAT HAS ALREADY<br />
BEEN SAID.<br />
WHAT I DO HOPE WE HAVE SEEN AN END OF IS THE SORT OF<br />
EXTRAVAGANT COMMENT, WHICH WHILE PERHAPS HEADLINE<br />
CATCHING, DOES VERY LITTLE FOR THE. CONFERENCE AS A<br />
WHOLE AND FOR THE CALM, DISPASSIONATE CONSIDERATION<br />
OF A SERIOUS PROBLEM.<br />
EACH OF YOU IN TURN I NOW ' INVITE TO MAKE A PRESENTATION<br />
ON THE SITUATION AS SEEN FROM YOUR STATE.<br />
SAFTER THAT . AS THE LAST ITEM BEFORE THE MORNING TEA<br />
BREAK, THE TREASURER WILL RESPOND TO YOUR PRESENTATIONS<br />
ON THE ECONOMY, SPEAKING TO HIS MORE EXTENSIVE ECONOMIC<br />
STATEMENT, COPIES OF WHICH YOU RECEIVED LAST NIGHT.<br />
AFTER MORNING TEA, I PROPOSE WE RESUME IN LOAN COUNCIL. </p>
