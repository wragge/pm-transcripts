JOINT MEDIA STATEMENT BY THE COMMONWEALTH MINISTER ASSISTING<br />
THE PRIME MINISTER IN FEDERAL AFFAIRS, THE HON. WAL. FIFE, M. P.<br />
AND MR HARRY JENSEN, NEW SOUTH WALES MINISTER FOR LOCAL<br />
GOVERNMENT AND ROADS<br />
The Commonwealth Minister Assisting the Prime Minister<br />
in Federal Affairs, the Hon. Wal. Fife, and the New South<br />
Wales Minister for Local Government and Roads, Mr Harry Jensen,<br />
today announced details of allocations to Councils in New<br />
South Wales for 1979/ 80 from Commonwealth Revenue Sharing Monies.<br />
The Grants to individual Councils are in accordance with<br />
the recommendations made by the New South Wales Local Government<br />
Grants Commission. The amount allocated to New South Wales local<br />
government bodies represents an increase of 23.5% over last year<br />
and is evidence of a real commitment to Local Government by the<br />
Commonwealth. A total of $ 80.929 million was distributed, an increase<br />
of $ 15.443 million over 1978/ 79. The Ministers stated that a<br />
third of the total sum available had again been dist3iibuted on a<br />
population basis, with 87k% of that portion on an overall per<br />
capita basis to all Councils and the balance of 12k% of that<br />
portion as an additional grant to Councils with a population<br />
density of less than 25 persons per square kilometre.<br />
This meant a per capita grant to all Councils of<br />
$ 4.7181 with an additional $ 3.9763 for all Councils, mainly Shires,<br />
which qualified for the weighting for population density. The<br />
remaining two thirds had been allocated on a general equalisation<br />
basis, with an emphasis on the needs for Councils.<br />
The Ministers emphasised that the grants are completely<br />
untied and free of any strings whatsoever and that the way in<br />
which the grants are utilised is a matter for each Council to<br />
determine. " This approach is in line with the policy of the two<br />
Governments to upgrade the status and independence of local<br />
governments", they said.<br />
