    <content><![CDATA[<p>Prime Minister, Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy </p>
<p>The Prime Minister has today helped roll out the National Broadband Network in Darwin, ahead of the network being officially switched on for 2,600 homes and businesses later this week.</p>
<p>This is great news for the people of Darwin, with the NBN scheduled to be fully rolled out in the Northern Territory by the end of 2015.</p>
<p>Labor’s National Broadband Network is a world class communications network that meets Australia’s broadband needs today and into the future.</p>
<p>Fibre construction on the NBN has already commenced to more than 25,000 homes and businesses in Darwin.</p>
<p>This includes in Bayview, Casuarina, Darwin City, East Point, Eaton, Fannie Bay, The Gardens, Larrakeyah, Ludmilla, The Narrows, Parap, Stuart Park, Alawa, Anula, Leanyer, Lyons, Malak, Marrara, Moil, Tiwi, Wagaman, Wanguri and Woolner.</p>
<p>When it comes to broadband, the future is fibre.</p>
<p>That is what Labor is delivering in Darwin and right across the country.</p>
<p>The Coalition wants to keep the copper, using last century’s technology to hold Australia back.</p>
<p>The Government believes everyone deserves access to fast, reliable, affordable broadband – that’s why we’re connecting everyone to the NBN at no connection cost.</p>
<p>Australians deserve the world’s best communications network, which only Labor’s National Broadband Network provides.</p>
