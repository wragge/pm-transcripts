    <content><![CDATA[<p>At the invitation of the New Zealand Prime Minister, Helen Clark, I will visit   New Zealand from 8 to 10 March for annual trans-Tasman prime ministerial talks.</p>
<p> Australia and New Zealand share deep ties of history and commitment to common values. We share a close interest in current international issues such as Iraq and North Korea. We work closely to promote regional prosperity and security, most notably in recent years in East Timor, Bougainville and the South Pacific.</p>
<p> My visit will take place in the 20th anniversary year of the bilateral Closer Economic Relations agreement (CER). Signed on 28 March 1983, CER remains a model for transparent and comprehensive free trade agreements today. It has promoted comprehensive economic integration between our two countries, and significant economic benefits for both of us. New Zealand remains one of Australia's most important trading partners.</p>
<p> As well as bilateral talks with Miss Clark, I will be opening the new office of the Australian Consulate-General in Auckland on 8 March, and I will meet a range of trans-Tasman business leaders that evening. My formal visit programme in Wellington will include talks with the New Zealand Cabinet and laying a wreath at the New Zealand war memorial. </p>
