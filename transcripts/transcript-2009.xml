OPENING OF NEW LIBERAL PARTY HEADQUARTE 9 N<br />
Brisbane, Q'd. 3 MARCH 1969<br />
Speech by the Prime Minister, Mr. John Gorton<br />
Mr. Chairman, Mr. Chalk, Parliamentary Colleagues, Ladies and<br />
Gentlemen: This is, of course, not by any means the first visit I<br />
have made to Queensland as Prime Minister. Indeed, I am not quite<br />
sure, but I think it might be the fourth or fifth or something of that<br />
kind. It is a very happy occasion for a visit, to be able to open this<br />
building, although I understand it has been in use for a month.<br />
Nevertheless, the mere fact that it is being officially opened now<br />
does not render null and void anything that has been done during the<br />
month that it wasn't officially open.<br />
I find it pleasant to be here for two reasons one<br />
because,: as I know you will all agree, this is an extremely attractive<br />
and efficient building in which to do the work of a political party. The<br />
other reason is that I believe it is, in a way, symbolic symbolic of<br />
a political party which makes advances, which progresses, which<br />
moves in this case from premises which are not sufficient to premises<br />
which are sufficient. This is an indication, I believe, of that<br />
progressiveness in the Queensland Division of the Liberal Party, a<br />
progressiveness which I believe extends throughout the whole of<br />
Australia as far as the Liberal Party is concerned.<br />
We have, as you said, Sir, been in existence some<br />
twenty-five years or so and in government for twenty. I think this is<br />
a record which all those who have supported the Liberal Party, or<br />
now support it, can look back on with pride and with a belief that the<br />
work that they have done in the branches and in the electorates has<br />
been reflected in great good and great progress accruing to the nation<br />
of Australia. If you look back to the time when this party came in to<br />
office, I think it is not unfair to say that at that time Australia was<br />
relatively stagnant and the policies of the Government then looking<br />
after Australia were relatively sterile. There were problems then<br />
which called urgently to be overcome. And in the period since this<br />
Government achieved office, I think they have been overcome.<br />
At that stage one of the problems was how to provide<br />
for full employment for all those willing and able to work in Australia,<br />
and at that stage, those who were then the Government, and now seek<br />
hopelessly to be the Government again, were saying that five per cent<br />
of unemployment was a reasonable sort of level for a country to reach;<br />
e. / 2 </p>
<p>-2<br />
you couldn't expect it to go much lower. Yet we know that we hay e<br />
gone much lower and that in Australia today there is no fear of<br />
unemployment for any man able and willing and with skills to contribute.<br />
There was little growth in Australia at that time, yet<br />
since then the growth in this country, as your Chairman has said,<br />
compares with the growth of any country in the world and exceeds the<br />
growth of at least ninety-eight per cent of the countries of the world.<br />
Now this doesn't mean there aren't still problems to be<br />
overcome. Of course there are. Problems will always be with us.<br />
But it does mean that the problems are new in kind because they are<br />
problems stemming from the great growth that Australia has made,<br />
from the great increases in its population, from the accretion in size<br />
of its cities, from the calls from all quarters for capital for still<br />
further development and for manpower to service that capital in still<br />
further development. But at least these problems stemming from<br />
growth, problems which I believe we are overcoming though in the<br />
history of any nation there will always be problems are better than<br />
the problems which stemmed from the sterility and stagnation of the<br />
past. Here in this State is, I think, a magnificent e xample<br />
of the growth of which I have been talking. A good deal of it is due<br />
to the creation of a climate by the Liberal-Country Party Government,<br />
the creation of a climate which encourages an individual, which<br />
rewards an individual for the work and contribution he makes to the<br />
nation in which he lives. Some of it is due to deliberate decisions on<br />
the part of our Government; such decisions as, for example, to take<br />
action to see that a city such as Townsville was given the potential for<br />
growth. That city is now in a position where it is among the fastest<br />
growing cities in Australia. Why? Because of deliberate decisions to<br />
place there a university college ( soon to be a university if not one<br />
already); a teachers' college; and, a large Army establishment. With<br />
this comes all those who flow in to service the people in such<br />
establishments, because another decision by the Government was the<br />
establishment throughout the North of a network of roads, opening up<br />
the country as it has not been opened up before and enabling the delivery<br />
of cattle from the interior in a condition which previously was impossible.<br />
And if you look through this great segment of Australia<br />
now and bear in mind what is happening in Townsville, what is happening<br />
in Weipa, what is happening in Gladstone, the growth of Mt. Isa, the<br />
construction of the Fairbairn Dam and many other such developments,<br />
you will see what is being contributed in this State to this State, but<br />
more importantly than that, what is being contributed by this State to<br />
the nation of Australia. You spoke, Sir, of nationalism, and I will never cease to<br />
speak of it. This is an example of the kind of nationalism that I mean,<br />
that these great developments in this part of Australia should be<br />
recognised throughout the whole nation as contributions not to a pa rt<br />
/ 3 </p>
<p>3-<br />
of Australia but to the whole. The contributions made in Western<br />
Australia by Mt. Tom Price and the other great developments must<br />
be recognised as contributing not just to Western Australia but to the<br />
nation as a whole, including Queensland, just as the oil strikes in Bass<br />
Strait must so be considered by all parts of this nation. Because if<br />
we are to attain the destiny that lies before us, which is within our<br />
grasp, then we must, of course, give loyalty to the towns in which we<br />
live, to the cities in which we live, to the areas of Australia in which<br />
we live, but we must recognise that above and beyond and overriding<br />
all that is a loyalty, a pride and a sense of achievement in whatever<br />
good happens in any part of this great nation of ours.<br />
This is not to be translated as chauvinism because it<br />
isn't. But it is to be regarded as an opportunity given by Providence<br />
to a new nation, to take a hard land, to wring from it a standard of<br />
living better than that any other land has known, and to contribute to<br />
the region in which we live unstinted assistance of all kinds so that<br />
we from our national development assist our neighbours and thereby<br />
assist ourselves. As a result, our children and grandchildren may<br />
in time, as I believe they will, be able to say: " This new nation is<br />
now significant in terms of numbers, in terms of industrial muscles,<br />
in the councils of the world. This new nation has taken initiatives<br />
to help its ill and aged and poor in a better and more effective way<br />
than has been taken anywhere else in the world. This new nation has<br />
not withdrawn inside itself but has been willing to share what has been<br />
given to it by nature and what it has torn from nature by muscles and<br />
by thought, to share that with its neighbours".<br />
If this is so, then when that time comes there will be<br />
no Australian who cannot in the world hold his head high and feel pride<br />
in his heart. If that time comes, as I am sure it will, then the<br />
Liberal Party and those of you who have worked for it so hard will<br />
get a better reward than any other I can think of.<br />
Sir, there is another great development project proposed<br />
in Queensland now a suggestion that a gigantic power-house may be<br />
built on the central Queensland coalfields, calling for some $ 200 million<br />
in loan funds. This is an exciting suggestion. I can say no more about<br />
it than that it was put up by Mr. Chalk and the Queensland Government<br />
to us and that it requires close examination in order to determine the<br />
extent of the coal deposits, the exact price at which electricity from<br />
those deposits can be sold, the willingness of overseas firms to use<br />
that power in order to develop the areas around that particular powerhouse,<br />
and indeed a number of other feasibility studies. These are<br />
the first steps. I have written to the Queensland Government and said<br />
that we recommend and suggest that there should be a meeting of<br />
officials from the Commonwealth and from Queensland so that these<br />
matters may, as a first step, be thoroughly investigated. I can go<br />
no further than that at this stage, and this meeting is entirely without<br />
commitment. But should the scheme turn out to be -feasible, should it </p>
<p>4<br />
turn out to be what its proponents believe it might turn out to be, should<br />
it do that, and should the resources be able to be found and made available,<br />
then that will be one more great forward step I won't say for Queensland,<br />
I'll say for Australia. I think, Sir, that is all I have to say. Indeed, I have<br />
spoken longer than I was told to. So I will just conclude by thanking<br />
you all for what you have done and for what I know you will do to keep<br />
this nation moving, as it has been moving, only moving even faster in<br />
the future. </p>
