TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
LAUNCH OF EMPLOYMENT SERVICES REGULATORY AUTHORITY,<br />
WILLIAM ANGLISS COLLEGE, MELBOURNE, 4 MAY 1995<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
I'm very pleased to be here and I thank the William Angliss College for being<br />
our very kind hosts on this morning to launch the Employment Services<br />
Regulatory Authority. It is, I think, another one of those milestones in the<br />
history of our country, of our society, and I made the point, I think, back in the<br />
election in 1993, that the election was very much an ideological contest<br />
between those that had one view of Australia and those with another. And<br />
the view that we on this side of politics and society had was that Australia<br />
was strong enough and rich enough, and we hoped wise enough, to accept<br />
the notion of inclusion and to say that we move ahead as a society together,<br />
that we should never, ever accept the fact that some people are allowed to<br />
miss right out and fall off the back of the system, become an underclass and<br />
try and meet their way, or battle along, basically in some sort of a rut of<br />
assistance, or community assistance, or welfare, for the rest of their days.<br />
Now, it turned out that that message was pretty well understood and received<br />
in the last election and it is true as Joan Kirner said, that on election night I<br />
said we wouldn't leave the unemployed behind, that the election was very<br />
much about activity and employment, about the whole notion that the way to<br />
fairness and equity in this country is through the right to a job and one's<br />
capacity to share in the national bounty and have a piece of the cake which<br />
comes generally through employment in this country.<br />
So, we had a number of objectives: one to restart the economy and get it<br />
cracking, to get employment going strongly, and at the same time to look after<br />
those who have been particularly disadvantaged in the labour market the<br />
long term unemployed. And we can say now, a couple of years down the<br />
track, we are well along the way of meeting some of those objectives. We've<br />
had 4.2 per cent employment growth over the last year, which in OECD terms<br />
is spectacular. We have had the biggest fall in unemployment in the last<br />
year, or year and a half, that we've had since we've be-en kieping the records<br />
2: 01 No. 007 P. 01<br />
lc1 </p>
<p>2<br />
and we're now starting to see substantial inroads to the category of long term<br />
unemployment, That is, those who are long term unemployed are getting a<br />
bigger share of the employment action in this cycle than they did in any other.<br />
That's because, I think, that we've had a lot of aggregate employment<br />
because you can have Working Nation, but Working-Nakion without growth<br />
and employment one feeds off the other, the fI~ xiThas got to come from the<br />
employment. But not only have we had the raw employment, we've had, I<br />
think, the success of the labour market programs and actually trying to bring<br />
people who are long term unemployed back into the mainstream of the labour<br />
market. Now, this is a matter of great pleasure to me, and to Simon Cxean who<br />
manages these programs under his portfolio and also to the social security<br />
system with our colleague Peter Baldwin it's a matter of great pleasure to<br />
the Government as a whole tii-tNwe'v-e been able to see this transformation.<br />
But the good thing is I think we're getting acceptance for the notion of the<br />
equity of it all. Now, I mean, the thing about our Tory friends is when you say<br />
equity it's like holding up the wooden stake to Dracula they're always<br />
moving away from the word equity. But when we talked about Working<br />
Nation, talking about equity and efficiency, well, the efficiency word, well, they<br />
couldn't, you know, ideology meant they couldn't really leave that one behind<br />
and we said, well, where are we going to get the skills complementation in<br />
this recovery? I mean, as the recovery continues and we start seeing real<br />
strength in employment and potential bottlenecks in the labour market, where<br />
are going to get the skills formation from? And we are essentially going to<br />
get them from the long term unemployed, you know, then a group of 350-<br />
400,000 people. So we are saying not only is it an inequitable thing to do to<br />
leave them behind, it's an inefficient thing to do. That is, that the labour<br />
market will be stronger and better and that the point that Sue and others have<br />
made this morning, people have skills. The fact that they have struck a poor<br />
patch in the labour market, or they haven't been there at the right moment, or<br />
they haven't been managed properly, or they have not been understood<br />
doesn't mean that they can't be particularly useful back in the labour market<br />
doing the things that they have done in the past or are able to do in the<br />
future, or if they are trained to do in the future. And so as a consequence,<br />
we've seen now an acceptance of, I think, the concept behind Working<br />
Nation, which is a very revolutionary change because the whole concept of<br />
cp e ranrigement and the Job Compact, that is, when someone is long term<br />
unemployed, unemployed over twelve months or more, they have this right to<br />
be case managed for an individual to get to know them, to understand their<br />
aptitudes, their educational standards, their employment history, their<br />
personality, and try and match them and help them, and at the same time,<br />
then after eighteen months, qualify for the Compact where the nation makes a<br />
commitment to give them a labour market place, a subsidised place in the<br />
labour market, for a period of time provided they take it.<br />
This is, I think, quite a revolutionary change and it did come from, as Joan<br />
said, the Green Paper consultations and the White Paper, and were able to<br />
put it into place. Now I notice today, you know-, we have people still </p>
<p>TEL' 4. May .95 2 : 01 No .007 P .03<br />
3<br />
cavilling about. I notice, Vince Fitzgerald today talking about savings in<br />
The Australian saying, '~ Well, you know, the Government should have<br />
basically used the Working Nation money last year and put it off the Budget<br />
deficit" you know, it's a view, but it's a pretty dull view, it's a pretty dumb<br />
view. And you say, why? I mean, here we are, we're about to bring down a<br />
Budget which is going to address the major problem the country faces in<br />
the medium term and that is the sav ins icnbajance and the current<br />
account deficit. That's what the Budget is going to be aimed squar'ly-at.<br />
It's principal task is not demand management, so why did we, last year,<br />
have to forget Working Nation and simply put the proceeds off the Budget<br />
deficit? And there's only one reason ideology. Ideology, that is, out of<br />
sight, out of mind. You know, the hard-hearted view, the rest of us can<br />
move on into higher incomes and better standards of living and bad luck,<br />
the sort of buffer at the end of the station, the cushion, the shock-absorber,<br />
is that 300,000 or so people can be the long term unemployed and who<br />
cares about them because politically they don't matter. I mean, that's the<br />
view. You know, it's a view those of us who appreciate the sort of country<br />
Australia is and has become should fight, that we should resist, that we<br />
don't want the Newt Gingrich view of the world here and we are not going<br />
to cop it being sort of basically parroted by people like John Howard, you<br />
know, running around parroting little right-wing ideologies dfedupo<br />
that they are more palatable. But basically down to the same thing, that is,<br />
Mr Downer as Leader of the Opposition, said Working Nation was an<br />
extravagance, they would hack into all the labour market programs upon<br />
which it sits and basically say that it's dispensable. Well, we don't think it is<br />
and I don't think the employers think it is because I think they see the clear<br />
value of it. But more than that, it does make us a better, stronger society to<br />
have these values. I mean, politics and national life is about values, it's not<br />
just about the Budget balance, it's not just about the tax system, it's about<br />
values. And you've got to make a determined effort when you've got<br />
we've now international ised this country, you've got international price<br />
earnings ratios being attached to our stocks, you've had, you know, great<br />
increments in wealth. I mean, twelve years ago, when I first became<br />
Treasurer, the all ordinaries index, I think from memory, was 451 that's<br />
over 2,000 today. That's over a four-fold increase in real wealth for the<br />
people holding stocks in this country, and you will see that. The<br />
international isation of the place means that there is going to be more<br />
wealth here, and its distribution will often be uneven. That's not to say that<br />
we should comply in any induced unevenness. Rather, we should resist it<br />
and try and bring up the people at the bottom of the queue. And whether<br />
they come up via Working Nation or the transfer system, or support for low<br />
income families, or the singular commitment to employment, I mean,<br />
whatever it is of those we choose or choose together, these are all things<br />
that a good society does in the name of equity, decency and justice. And<br />
that's where Working Nation came from it came from those concepts.<br />
But, like a lot of things the Government has done, we are now seeking to<br />
sort of push the boundaries out further and what we are seeing here today<br />
is really a quite revolutionary change to the way the labour market works </p>
<p>TEL: 4. May. 3b 2: u UrINQ -U<br />
4<br />
and you've already seen, you know, the Job Compact come into place, the<br />
Youth Training Initiatives are up and running, the Nation-alTraining Wage<br />
has been implemented, the Australian Student Traineeship Foundation,<br />
NETTFORCE, and now we are looking at the launch of the Employment<br />
Services Regulatory Authority, with its contracted Case Management<br />
launch. And here, we are seeing another important innovation in the way<br />
the Australian rabour market works, because we are now seeking with the<br />
basis of case management that close in, personalised attention and care<br />
which we are able to give people. We are able, in that context, to start to<br />
say " well, maybe we ought to be giving people a choice about who<br />
manages them", and try and encourage some competition into the system<br />
that manages them, so that there isn't just one monolith servicing them,<br />
though the monolith that has done its very best under strained conditions<br />
that's the CES but to open it out. Essentially, ESRA was an idea that<br />
Simon ( Crean) and I dreamed up, and it came from the Austel model in<br />
telecommunications. And that is, that we had Austel running a market<br />
between Optus, Telecom and the resellers of telecommunications services.<br />
And so what we sought to do with Austel was to create a private market,<br />
but with the market tipped in favour of the duopolists in this country which<br />
was Optus and the resellers, away from the former monopolists, Telecom.<br />
In the same way, the same concept is here with ESRA that is, we will have<br />
a body sitting over this labour market seeking to create a proper market in<br />
training management, in case management and opportunity, and in the<br />
labour market, and the delivery of labour market programs in such a way<br />
that we will not simply see some monolith, and at the same time, involving<br />
private sector companies. And we heard Sue's contribution earlier from<br />
Drake amongst others that will be here, like, of course, the Brotherhood of<br />
St Laurence and similar bodies we will see them proliferate right across<br />
the country, and we will see these skills come up. We will see the skills<br />
base of case managers come up, we will be able then to see people<br />
moving between organisations, and we will develop truly an industry in<br />
this particular field. Another good thing about it is that there is one good<br />
thing about the Tories -they can always rip away at a labour market<br />
program, but it is very hard to start tearing away at these things, once they<br />
start being built up. One of the things you have always got to do when you<br />
think about social reform in Australia is to make it Tory-proof you have<br />
always got to Tory-proof them. It's not just do them, but you have got to<br />
hermetically seal them so they can't get their nasty little right-wing<br />
fingernails under them and tear them away. And this is another thing that I<br />
think matters in this that is, that we can actually not simply develop it, but<br />
we can, in the doing of it, get a lot of acceptance for it.<br />
I think one of the things that Simon ( Crean) and I would like to see happen<br />
here is that as we see this system continuing to sophisticate itself that<br />
the case managers themselves can start to create their own labour market<br />
programs. And that we might be able to relate to organisations and case<br />
managers in a way where we fund those, built in a way which is wholly<br />
different to the way we do it today. And that is one of the things that one </p>
<p>TEL' y.<br />
would hope to see come a much more flexible, efficient and effective<br />
labour market program. Now, I was delighted when Joan told me that we<br />
hava nlready got 271 private bvie accredited I think contracted is<br />
probably the right term private and community organisations. Two<br />
hundred and seventy one, who between them will help 100,000 job<br />
seekers. A significant number of these accredited contracted case<br />
managers specialise in services to clients with particular needs such as<br />
youth, people with disabilities, mature-aged unemployed people, Aboriginal<br />
and Torres Strait Islander people, people of non-English speaking<br />
backgrounds, and ex-offenders etc. And I think that we are talking now<br />
already about 600 outlets around the country. So, already we are starting<br />
to see the thing blossom and as you know, the fact that Joan is also on<br />
NETTFORCE means we can make that linkage to the companies and to the<br />
industrial sectors. Because I think one of the great possibilities in case<br />
management in Australia is that we actually get sectors like the metals<br />
industry and the metal industry employers with the metal industry unions<br />
talking about taking up case management themselves, so that when some<br />
firm in that industry requires somebody, there is a much easier matching<br />
process, and that there is, if you like, people tending to gravitate towards it<br />
for jobs in that particular industry. We start to get some segmentation in<br />
the industry. I think the notion is of a training company, and I think we are<br />
seeing this in a sort of NETTFORCE concept arising there. So, I think that<br />
is going to be an important change too, So, the whole case management<br />
notion providing private sector as well as government involvement needs<br />
to be applauded and further promoted.<br />
Can I just say a few words here about the CES much maligned, but it has<br />
done a terrific job over the years, under difficult circumstances, often with a<br />
system a weight of unemployment which it was never really designed to<br />
manage. But, at the same time, managed it well, and now referring people<br />
to private case managers. It's a cultural change there, and I know that we<br />
in the Government are very proud of the changes which have been taking<br />
place in the CES in its capacities, and let me just take this opportunity to<br />
record our appreciation of that organisation.<br />
I would like to also take the chance while I am here of just complimenting<br />
Simon on the job he has done with Working Nation it has been a mighty<br />
job a mighty job. It is really the hard tack of public policy itfs one thing<br />
announcing it, designing it and announcing it and getting it out, it's another<br />
thing making it work. Putting all the bits together, seeing that they fit<br />
logically, trying to get their efficiencies up, get them moving together it's a<br />
tremendous task, and I have got many reasons to feel proud of this<br />
Cabinet, and proud of the Government, but none more so than Working<br />
Nation, and the job that Simon has been able to do with all of you who are<br />
involved with these programs. I mean, it's a great tribute to the sort of<br />
system of government and the society we have that we can take something<br />
like this on, and get it up quickly and get it running effectively you can just<br />
imagine the sort of debate you would have in the United States with a<br />
program like this, well, you wouldn't have a program like this in the United<br />
A tit~ S: 01 No. 00OU~ U </p>
<p>TEL: 4 . IMd~* Z'-<br />
6<br />
States, or in other parts of the world. And I do hope that what we have<br />
done here in Working Nation is going to be a bit of a trail-blazer in the<br />
OECD countries as something better in terms of how the long-term<br />
unemployed can be brought into the labour market, and to have their share<br />
of the nations bounty, their share of the opportunities, their share of the joy,<br />
their share of the happiness, because they are entitled to it as much as any<br />
of the rest of us are.<br />
So, could I perhaps conclude by thanking Joan sincerely for taking the<br />
job. She is a believer in community organisations you have got to say<br />
that for her. And this is right up her alley, this one, because this is<br />
community action at work in the very best sense of that phrase. That is,<br />
going out there, and getting these linkages to community organisations in<br />
the welfare sector, and other community and private organisations, and<br />
getting that mix I think Joan's experience in government, and her own<br />
experience in community activity, almost uniquely places her with ESRA to<br />
see it really come good. And so I thank her most sincerely for that. I would<br />
like to finalise by expressing my appreciation to everybody who has<br />
enthusiastically taken Working Nation up who have seen it as an<br />
opportunity, who have been of good spirit and good heart, and who have<br />
got in to see what they can do, and many of those organisations are<br />
represented here today, and many people who have done that are here<br />
today they are too numerous to thank, but I sincerely thank you all,<br />
because Governments can do some things, but without you, they don't<br />
happen. Particularly in this area, and I think the fact that you have<br />
embraced these programs holds out such great promise to people who are<br />
disadvantaged and unemployed people we have heard from a couple of<br />
them today, and you can just see this whole question about one's place in<br />
society, one's esteem for oneself, how important it is to advance to a job.<br />
and to make one's way in life. That can only come when one loses that<br />
esteem through being rejected by society or seemingly by being<br />
unemployed for a long period of time, or unemployed at all, indeed, and<br />
then to be supported I think these are things which mean that people can<br />
rise and their esteem can rise, and their whole sense of themselves can<br />
change and they can soon become much more effective take a much<br />
more effective place in our country and our society. The main thing is, with<br />
all these things, as I said earlier good societies can do more than one<br />
thing at a time, and good governments can do more than one thing at a<br />
time we can attend to the Budget deficit, and the Current Account Deficit,<br />
while at the same time we look after the unemployed. And not only is it<br />
something we can do, it is something we should do. And we should<br />
always reject the doom-sayers who, in the end, have basically a caraway<br />
seed for a heart there is a very small thing ticking in the chest, which,<br />
really, is all about being essentially when you get down to it all, when<br />
you rub all the phrasing and all the polish of it, it's just a bit of meanspiritedness.<br />
We are all, I hope, much bigger than that. Thank you indeed.<br />
ends. </p>
