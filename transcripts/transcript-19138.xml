<p>[ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS OMITTED]</p>
<p>I acknowledge each of you  -  the women drawn here by the power of this day.</p>
<p>You are women of achievement.</p>
<p>Women who reach out to shape the future.</p>
<p>This is a day of celebration, and rightly so.</p>
<p>Even if the women's movement had changed just one life, it would be worth it.</p>
<p>Yet over the past century, it has changed millions of lives, including my own.</p>
<p>But today our celebration must be tempered by realism.</p>
<p>The first International Women's Day was 102 years ago.</p>
<p>This is an old struggle.</p>
<p>Yet the level of assault and abuse is still too high.</p>
<p>The gender pay gap is still too wide.</p>
<p>The number of women in senior roles is still too few.</p>
<p>We should be impatient.</p>
<p>It's time to get a move on.</p>
<p>And friends, let's never forget that women's rights are indivisible.</p>
<p>If women are marginalised or oppressed anywhere, it's as though it happened to one of us.</p>
<p>This year America has been celebrating 150 years since President Lincoln ended slavery.</p>
<p>We imagine slavery as something from the pages of history.</p>
<p>But it's not.</p>
<p>It's hard to imagine from the safety and comfort we know, yet slavery still exists in our world and in our land.</p>
<p>The setting is different than it once was.</p>
<p>Today the people forced into slavery work in factories, in domestic servitude, in brothels  -  often in big cities like this.</p>
<p>But the violence and coercion they face is exactly the same.</p>
<p>In February this year I had the opportunity to meet with two women who were victims of human trafficking.</p>
<p>They had been brought to Australia by their employers under false pretences.</p>
<p>They had their passports taken from them.</p>
<p>They weren't allowed to leave the house without supervision.</p>
<p>One of them wasn't paid properly; the other wasn't paid at all.</p>
<p>When they challenged their employers, they were abused and threatened.</p>
<p>That occurred here, in Australia.</p>
<p>Not 150 years ago but in the last three years.</p>
<p>I was introduced to those women by Andrew âTwiggyâ Forrest and his wife Nicola, who were talking to me about their role in establishing âWalk Free'  -  a global movement that aims to eradicate modern slavery.</p>
<p>There are many things on which Mr Forrest and I do not agree but ending modern slavery isn't one of them.</p>
<p>Twiggy and Nicola Forrest have shown amazing leadership on this issue.</p>
<p>Not only that.</p>
<p>The Forrests have pledged to donate the vast majority of their wealth to this and other causes.</p>
<p>A gesture that will change lives in the most basic possible way  -  restoring people to freedom.</p>
<p>Friends, remember these women are among 16 million women who have been enslaved and trafficked over the past decade and this is their Day too.</p>
<p>Those women don't have a voice so we must speak for them.</p>
<p>Not just to speak but to act.</p>
<p>That's why since 2004, Australia has invested over $150 million in anti-people trafficking measures, in our region and here at home  -  including $50 million I pledged last year.</p>
<p>Already we've been able to help around 200 women and their dependents in Australia, and today I pay tribute to the special role the Salvation Army has played in this.</p>
<p>But as Australia's first female Prime Minister, I've wanted us to do even more.</p>
<p>That's why we passed the Slavery, Slavery-like Conditions and People Trafficking Act which our Governor-General signed into law yesterday.</p>
<p>This Act creates new offences of forced marriage and harbouring a victim.</p>
<p>It enables accomplices to be charged as well as the main perpetrators.</p>
<p>It raises the penalties for existing debt bondage offences, and also increases payments to victims.</p>
<p>Alongside these new laws, we are updating Australia's National Action Plan to combat trafficking, slavery and forced marriage  -  which will come into force next year.</p>
<p>And today I'm proud to announce a new whole-of-government strategy to reinforce ethical behaviour in procurement so that no firm providing goods or services to the Commonwealth is tainted by slavery or people-trafficking anywhere in the supply chain.</p>
<p>While there's no evidence this is the case at the moment, we know slavery or people-trafficking are becoming a greater issue as the global economy becomes more interlinked.</p>
<p>I'd hate to see a single cent of public money go to any entity involved in this vile trade.</p>
<p>Friends, this is one of the many ways that Australia is saying âno'.</p>
<p>No to people trafficking.</p>
<p>No to slavery.</p>
<p>No to treating women like objects or chattels.</p>
<p>That is not a world we will accept.</p>
<p>That is not a life we want for any woman or any girl.</p>
<p>Not here.</p>
<p>Not overseas.</p>
<p>Not anywhere.</p>
<p>Not ever.</p>
<p>Instead, we seek a different future and a different world.</p>
<p>Where every girl is born with freedom in her heart and has the chance to grow old with that freedom.</p>
<p>And so, on International Women's Day, we affirm this simple but enduring truth: change is always possible, and the hope we share can never be in vain.</p>
