PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF NEWS CONFERENCE, SHERATON HOTEL, BRISBANE,<br />
26 FEBRUARY 1990<br />
E 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
PM: I'm sorry to keep you waiting. I just want to make<br />
a few comments on the national scene and then one about<br />
the Queensland scene, if I may, before I make myself<br />
available to you for questions.<br />
The most significant single thing I think that came out<br />
of last night's debate was the stark revelation of the<br />
Opposition Leader's recipe for economic disaster in this<br />
country. He talked at one and the same time about the fiscal<br />
discipline, then went about spending money like a drunken<br />
sailor. He was asked about the soil degradation program<br />
and he said, well I don't know what the figures are, look<br />
them up in the forward estimates and double them. We've<br />
done that and we find that the Leader of the Opposition<br />
has now committed himself to at least another $ 158<br />
million expenditure. by the fact that under the<br />
program, the forward estimates, the figures for the first<br />
three years, minimum figures in the first three years of<br />
that's 26, 26, 27 which gives you 79. So there's $ 79<br />
million in addition. But we find in this morning's paper<br />
that Senator Puplick has said that they're going to<br />
complete this program not in ten years, but in five<br />
years. So we've doubled the $ 79 and get $ 158 million.<br />
Now here's this man of fiscal rectitude who's already got<br />
a $ 6 billion credibility gap, and last night I just find<br />
another $ 158 million into the red. Now let me put it<br />
quite simply. Once Mr Peacock is bereft of his prepared<br />
cliches as to what they will do, he is hopeless on how<br />
they will achieve their stated objectives.<br />
The central issues in bringing about a reduction in<br />
interest rates in this country, a reduction in inflation,<br />
are what do you do about wages and what is your fiscal<br />
policy. Now last night I tested Mr Peacock again on wages outcome<br />
and we had a replay of the ' who's to know' Canberra reply<br />
because he had no answer on the central question, what is<br />
the wages outcome likely to be. </p>
<p>I said last night, and I repeat it here, that in each of<br />
our years in office, our predictions about wages outcome<br />
have been accurate. On average, the predictions as to<br />
wages outcome have been about .5 of a per cent above the<br />
actual outcome. So we can predict with accuracy and with<br />
confidence the wages outcome.<br />
Mr Peacock is faced now with a situation where again he<br />
cannot deny that there must be a wages explosion under<br />
his policy because again he concedes the position that in<br />
the fixation of wages the Government should bail out of<br />
that position and leave it to the strength of parties.<br />
That means a wages explosion against our wages<br />
predictability. So on the wages front he can do nothing to control<br />
interest rates. It must be a recipe for higher interest<br />
rates. And add it to fiscal discipline where he's<br />
talking about reigning in Government expenditures, in<br />
fact, as I say, he's now added to the $ 6 billion<br />
credibility gap by at least another $ 158 million. So he<br />
cannot answer how he will achieve what he says he will<br />
do. In fact, when questioned and when pushed, it's quite<br />
clear that it would bring inevitably an increase in<br />
interest rates under the policies of Mr Peacock.<br />
So much for the national implications of last night. But<br />
may I say, coming to Queensland it's fascinating to see<br />
the confirmation of the last thing I said last night in<br />
the debate. Here is an Opposition coalition deeply<br />
divided I said, not able to govern themselves, how can<br />
they govern the country. And we find now, here in<br />
Queensland, what we expected the Liberals and the<br />
National Party at one another's throat. Because what we<br />
have, the State Director of the Liberal Party in<br />
Queensland saying yesterday about Senator Stone. Senator<br />
Stone, the National Party candidate for the seat of<br />
0 Fairfax, the Liberal Party saying of Senator Stone, I<br />
quote ' Senator Stone is not the sort of person people<br />
would want to vote for'.<br />
Now here you have the Liberal Party saying about the<br />
Shadow Minister for Finance that he's not the sort of<br />
person that people would want to vote for. I repeat, if<br />
these people are so torn by internal hatreds and<br />
divisions, saying of a leading candidate in the National<br />
Party that he's not the sort of person that people would<br />
vote for, how can the people of Queensland or the people<br />
of Australia have any confidence in them at all? OK.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, how do you rate your performance<br />
last night? Win, lose, win by points or what?<br />
PM: Well, let me say this. I was asked when I came out<br />
of the, of the studio last night by the assembled<br />
journalists how I felt. I said I felt comfortable with </p>
<p>my performance. I understand that in the poll taken of<br />
those same journalists they had me a clear winner.<br />
That's their judgement. I'm more than happy with the<br />
reaction that appeared in the Press around Australia<br />
today, but I don't go about claiming victory. I merely<br />
say, as I said last night, I was comfortable with my<br />
performance. I think I went to the issues and I'll leave<br />
it at that.<br />
JOURNALIST: Are you relieved that it's over?<br />
PM: Well, you may have noticed that I was able to handle<br />
it reasonably comfortably. I didn't have any notes and<br />
piles of cue cards and all that sort of thing. As I said<br />
last night and I think it's worth saying. I mean, if you<br />
are Prime Minister of this country or you purport to be a<br />
Prime Minister, a potential Prime Minister of this<br />
country, it seems to me if you can't handle an hour of<br />
questioning and debate about the economy, social policy,<br />
the environment and be prepared for any sort of questions<br />
S that may come, I mean, it's not much of a commentary upon<br />
you. I felt able from my experience and the work that I<br />
continuously do to keep abreast of things, I felt able to<br />
handle these things. It would be foolish to deny, and I<br />
don't, that there isn't a certain amount of tension in<br />
these things, of course there is. But basically I felt<br />
fairly relaxed about it.<br />
JOURNALIST: Is there any chance of a rematch after the<br />
policy launch?<br />
PM: Look, we've had 90 years of federation in this<br />
country, there's been two debates agreed to by a Prime<br />
Minister in that period I've agreed to both of them<br />
and you would have thought that if Mr Peacock felt that<br />
he'd won last night, he'd put that in his pocket and say,<br />
well let's get on feeling that he didn't and wants<br />
another go. But I think one's enough probably.<br />
0 JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, do you think that these things<br />
should become a fixed feature of future election<br />
campaigns? PM: Well, I'm not going to be Prime Minister for ever<br />
and therefore I don't want to I certainly trust I'll be<br />
for the next term and perhaps some time after that but<br />
this is a matter really for people at the time to<br />
determine. And I was in a position in 1984 where in the<br />
1983 campaign I had challenged Mr Fraser and he wouldn't<br />
debate me in 1983. So I was fair game for a challenge in<br />
1984 and I thought well on this occasion if I don't<br />
agree to it, you're going to have Mr Peacock wandering<br />
around the country saying ' he won't debate'. let's<br />
get that out of the way. So we've got that out of the<br />
way. Now I'm very relaxed about last night. Let's get<br />
on with the campaign.<br />
JOURNALIST: ( inaudible) </p>
<p>PM: Beg your pardon?<br />
JOURNALIST: Has it boosted your confidence?<br />
PM: Well, as I said in answer to the previous questions,<br />
I feel fairly comfortable about last night. I'm<br />
certainly fairly comfortable about what appears to be the<br />
reactions. I'm not arrogant about it, I'm comfortable<br />
and I'm looking forward to the rest of the campaign.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, you were noticeably restrained,<br />
particularly at the beginning of the debate, was this a<br />
deliberate tactic or was it a case of nerves?<br />
PM: No, I wasn't nervous. As I said before, it would be<br />
silly to say that there's not some sort of tension in<br />
these things. Of course there is if you're going to be<br />
in a national debate. I mean, I'm human, there's some<br />
tension. But I tend not to be a nervous type. I wasn't<br />
nervous and, as in all experiences, I suppose as you go<br />
on doing something you get a bit more confident, a bit<br />
more relaxed. I suppose that's true, yes.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, that there's a humbling<br />
debate PM: ( inaudible)<br />
JOURNALIST: ( inaudible)<br />
PM: As I am by nature humble I guess you'll see it right<br />
through the campaign, yes.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, what's your reaction after last<br />
night to the Liberal campaign ads that there are<br />
questions which have to be answered?<br />
PM: Right, a good question. I mean, you have to have a<br />
bit of a laugh to yourself they are questions that<br />
have to be answered. How many times did Mr Peacock<br />
refuse to ask me a question? I mean, there he was,<br />
national television, time after time being pleaded with<br />
by the compere, ask a question, no. So I think for the<br />
rest of the campaign this proposition about there are<br />
questions for Mr Hawke to answer is going to look a bit<br />
hollow. JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, the Labor Party is<br />
presumably not going win in Fairfax. Which way would you<br />
suggest they directed their preferences? To Senator<br />
Stone or the Liberals?<br />
PM: Well I believe we've got a fair chance of winning<br />
and I would hope that that would be the outcome. But I<br />
don't know what arrangements they've made, it really I<br />
don't intervene in, in the State where they work out<br />
their preferences because there might be some reason for </p>
<p>one State for doing it one way or another. Let's, I mean<br />
I hope I won't offend anyone in my own Party here, but I<br />
suggest my personal inclination would not be to give<br />
preferences to Senator Stone. I mean, the Liberals<br />
occasionally get these things right and they've got it<br />
dead right. I mean, what a devastating situation in the<br />
Opposition today. The Liberals did get it right. He's<br />
not the sort of person, Senator Stone, that people would<br />
want to vote for. I wouldn't want to vote for him.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, how many seats would you hope to<br />
win in Queensland<br />
PM: Well, we're optimistic about winning several<br />
additional seats. I don't want to be exhaustive about<br />
it, but I think we've got some very good chances<br />
obviously in seats like Kennedy and Dawson, Moreton. But<br />
I'm not being exhaustive about it. I think we have good<br />
chances in those three certainly.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, one of your backbenchers, Mr<br />
Alan Griffiths, has been associated in a radio interview<br />
with allegedly referring to the NCA investigation into Mr<br />
Elliott. He's now also confirmed an investigation into<br />
insider trading in one of the major banks. Is this the<br />
kind of indiscreet behaviour you would expect of one of<br />
your own<br />
PM: In regard to Mr Griffiths, I understand that he has<br />
made these comments in an attempt, appropriate from his<br />
point of view, to clear his name. Because what was being<br />
suggested, as I understand it, by Mr Elliott and others<br />
was that Mr Griffiths had been responsible for some leaks<br />
concerning him. It seems to me that this issue is well<br />
and truly dead now in the sense that the producer of the<br />
ABC program himself has said publicly that the source was<br />
traced to the National Companies and Securities<br />
Commission. It's in those circumstances where the<br />
producer of the program in question has indicated that<br />
the source was not government but close to the NCSC that<br />
Mr Griffiths apparently thought it was appropriate to say<br />
something to clear himself from the accusation. I<br />
would've thought that the matter is appropriately dead.<br />
Because just let me add to the point I've made, that the<br />
producer of the ABC program himself has said that the<br />
source was not the government but close to the NCSC. And<br />
secondly it's quite clear that any papers that the<br />
Attorney-General has seen and on which he's acted, are<br />
available to Mr Peacock.<br />
JOURNALIST: would Mr Griffith's behaviour<br />
improperly allegations about insider trading to make<br />
PM: He wasn't doing that for the sake of doing that. He<br />
was establishing the context in which he had been<br />
talking. Allegations were made implicating Mr Griffiths<br />
in having been the source of the leak in regard to Mr </p>
<p>Elliott. Now he found it appropriate to establish the<br />
context of what he'd been talking about. And I make it<br />
quite clear that there's no way in which he was the<br />
source. And, as I say, the end of the matter is that the<br />
producer of the program himself has said not a government<br />
source but close to the NCSC. You are really tilling<br />
pretty unfertile soil in trying to go past that point.<br />
JOURNALIST: issue is dead, but obviously the<br />
Liberals don't regard it as such and today there's one<br />
commentator writing an extensive column about dirty<br />
tricks. PM: That means that if a particular commentator<br />
wants to keep going on and on and on about something that<br />
means that the issue is really politically alive. I mean<br />
on the basis of that logic, I mean every issue that any<br />
commentator anywhere wants to write about is still a<br />
relevant I just don't accept that. The reality is<br />
that the issue of the allegations that have been made by<br />
Mr Peacock and Mr Elliott are buried by the observation,<br />
the public observation that the producer of the program<br />
was the source of the leak. Not government, but close to<br />
the National Companies and Securities Commission. Try as<br />
you might, you can't get that. They are ones who<br />
produce the program and they are saying where the source<br />
is.<br />
JOURNALIST: But it still leaves the problem that Mr<br />
Griffiths in defending himself felt it necessary to give<br />
further information which perhaps should remain<br />
confidential? PM: Well, as I say Michelle, you can keep on trying to<br />
till this particular piece of barren soil if you like.<br />
I'm simply saying that the facts are quite clear as to<br />
where the source was and one of my Members, Mr Griffiths,<br />
found it necessary because insinuations have been made<br />
about him to create the context of comments that he had<br />
made before. Now where he has been subject to<br />
insinuations then it's not surprising that Mr Griffiths<br />
is going to try and defend himself.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, would you agree that the major<br />
parties seem to be underestimating the likely results for<br />
the Australian Democrats and if the coalition does<br />
get into power would you agree they'd have major problems<br />
getting their programs, especially economic and<br />
privatisation programs<br />
PM: You see I just don't accept the premise that The<br />
Opposition is not going to win. Let me say as far as<br />
we're concerned, in seven years in government, we've had<br />
our problems with the Democrats. But we've had to live<br />
with that fact of life. And in the fourth term if they<br />
try and stand in the way particular proposals, still<br />
try and get them through, negotiate with them. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, last night Mr Peacock appeared to<br />
distance the coalition from the Garnaut Report's<br />
recommendation on tariffs. How prepared are you to<br />
commit a future Hawke Government to pursuing that<br />
particular PM: There's two parts to that question. Let me take the<br />
first part first. We have another example here of<br />
division within the coalition because Mr Howard of<br />
course, who's the relevant minister, indicated his<br />
commitment to the Garnaut proposals. Last night you had<br />
the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Peacock venting his<br />
difference with Mr Howard. I made it quite clear at the<br />
time of the report that I had a personal disposition and<br />
sympathy for the Garnaut proposals. That's on record<br />
from the time I launched the Garnaut Report. We've done<br />
more than that though. We've received the report and<br />
we ' ye referred the report to a number of working<br />
committees. As you know, there are very many<br />
recommendations in the Garnaut Report. I've had those<br />
referred to working committees. After the election when<br />
we resume government then the work will be done. Now we<br />
have a record of action rather than rhetoric in all the<br />
period in government in recent years. The Liberals have<br />
done nothing in areas of tariff reduction. It's been the<br />
Labor Party, and as I say, our runs are on the board. My<br />
philosophical commitment in this is quite clear. I've<br />
got the work going on the Garnaut Report and that will be<br />
pursued when we resume active government.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, Mr Keating was asked in Perth<br />
yesterday whether it would take five terms of Labor<br />
Government to fix up the economy. He agreed that it was<br />
possible that it could take that long. Why do you think<br />
the voters will have that much patience?<br />
PM: Well, in the end the voters are going to have to<br />
make a choice. That is at the end what elections are<br />
about. Just look at the issues that are involved in the<br />
choice there. For 30 out of the last 33 years before we<br />
came in the Liberals were in office. 30 out of 33 years<br />
before we came to office. And so if you're talking about<br />
the institutions, the practices and the attitudes which<br />
constitute the Australian economy, the Australian<br />
industrial structure, then it's the outcome of all of<br />
that period of conservative government. Second point<br />
you'll recall that I have issued the challenge. Now it's<br />
about 80 or more days ago, I think it was the 7th of<br />
December 1989 at the National Press Club, and I said<br />
there to the conservatives, you produce for the<br />
Australian people any evidence of any period in your term<br />
in government when you came within a bull's roar of the<br />
massive microeconomic reform that we've undertaken in<br />
seven years. So that's the second point. That<br />
challenge, as you know, has gone unanswered. Why?<br />
Because they know that in all their period of office they<br />
did nothing about microeconomic reform. We are the<br />
reformers. Now the electorate understands that. That's </p>
<p>the second point. So in seven years we'ye done<br />
infinitely more than has ever been done before to undo<br />
that ineptitude, almost criminal neglect of 30 years. I<br />
think that when you add to that thirdly the fact that<br />
last week, while Mr Peacock was dodging you, giving the<br />
flip one liner as he hopped in and out of a car, I was<br />
steadfastly going about practical issues for the future.<br />
Last week I set out in detail a ten point program for<br />
further microeconomic reform in our next term. Now when<br />
you take all those things together, and each one of the<br />
points I've made is relevant, I think the Australian<br />
electorate will massively, on that issue, come down in<br />
favour of Labor against the conservatives.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, in view of the mixed<br />
reception, I would suggest it was a poor reception that<br />
your wages-taxes package got last week, do you think now<br />
perhaps building on the back of last night's debate you<br />
need to relaunch it so that it can be more credible and<br />
can be the centrepiece of your re-election strategy?<br />
PM: I don't accept poor, that it was poorly received.<br />
But always with these statements Paul and I understand<br />
that you've got a continuous job of selling to do. We<br />
will continue to I think it is true that we'll need<br />
to keep on doing that. It's going to be relatively<br />
easier now after last night in that the Leader of the<br />
Opposition has now starkly set out the alternative, which<br />
is chaos. Under the package that Paul Keating unveiled<br />
last week you have now a clear commitment which can be<br />
understood by Australian wage and salary earners. But<br />
what will happen to their real disposable income under a<br />
Labor Government in terms of wages and tax cuts, and most<br />
importantly, superannuation? Let me, just if I can,<br />
interpolate on that issue of superannuation. I think<br />
that you will find that superannuation is something of a<br />
sleeper in this campaign.<br />
JOURNALIST: ( inaudible)<br />
PM: Just wait I want to make a further point about<br />
that You look at the difference between Labor and<br />
the conservatives on this fundamental issue. When we<br />
came to office superannuation, predominantly the preserve<br />
of the privileged, under Labor is now being extended<br />
through not just some white collar workers but to blue<br />
collar workers and to women. Look at the features, now,<br />
look at the features, the four features of that<br />
superannuation element of the package. Firstly the fact<br />
that it tackles imaginatively a significant future<br />
problem for Australia. One of the significant facts that<br />
Australian electors have to have in their mind as they<br />
think about the future is the fact that we are an ageing<br />
population. 30 years down the track this country, if<br />
action is not taken now, will have an enormous problem in<br />
regard to ensuring that the aged are looked after. So<br />
the first point about our superannuation package is that<br />
it is an imaginative plan for a future problem. </p>
<p>Secondly, and very importantly, it is a plan which is<br />
relevant to the savings and debt problem of Australia.<br />
You know that under the superannuation plan of Labor<br />
involved in the package that you are going to have a<br />
massive accumulation of savings which will be relevant to<br />
dealing with Australia's debt problem. Third, it is fair<br />
because it means that superannuation is being extended to<br />
everyone in the community. And fourth, it means that<br />
when the three per cent superannuation part of the<br />
package is worked out over these next three years, it<br />
means that each employer will be each week putting $ 30 a<br />
week into the superannuation position of every employee.<br />
Now, against that imaginative, far-sighted, economically<br />
relevant and fair scheme for superannuation, which is<br />
part of the package, the Opposition would destroy the<br />
superannuation situation. So I think Paul as we explain<br />
the package as a whole, and I think superannuation in<br />
particular, that that is going to be a plus in the<br />
campaign. Wally.<br />
PM: With your projection of continuing fiscal discipline<br />
can motorists have any real hope that you will improve<br />
the Pacific Highway significantly?<br />
PM: Well, I'll be having something to say about roads<br />
during the campaign I think. I'll leave what I have to<br />
say till then.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, also on the weekend Mr Keating<br />
suggested that the six per cent inflation figure which<br />
the wage and tax deal, could actually be bettered<br />
this year. What do you think of the chances of that?<br />
PM: Paul bases that on these issues. Firstly, as you<br />
know, as I've said before and he has, that the Treasury<br />
said at the end of last year that the underlying rate of<br />
inflation was Now since that statement by the<br />
Treasury you've had a position where there is further<br />
evidence of a decline in demand and I believe that when<br />
you take that into account and the fact that under our<br />
policy there will obviously be a decline in interest<br />
rates, if you bring all those things together I think<br />
that Paul's prediction is sound.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, do you think in retrospect that<br />
the wage-tax package could have been explained any<br />
better? PM: I think in regard to the exposition of any policy<br />
you can always do things better. But then you can always<br />
write better than you do and I can always explain things<br />
better. Unless you think you can. I don't think you<br />
do think that. All of us can do things better.<br />
JOURNALIST: ( inaudible)<br />
PM: Of course. I mean I don't think that I'm ever<br />
perfect in regard to any matter. Do you? I mean </p>
<p>obviously you can do, with hindsight, you can do some<br />
things better. Of course you can.<br />
JOURNALIST: What would you have done differently?<br />
PM: I don't know that I would've done anything<br />
differently. I mean you do your best at the time. But I<br />
think that Paul Keating did, as he usually does, an<br />
absolutely outstanding job. I'm simply saying that I<br />
suppose well if you look back over things you might have<br />
done that a little bit differently, or that a little bit<br />
differently. But Paul Keating is both an outstanding<br />
thinker and he is also, I think, an outstanding<br />
expositor. I think that what you must understand is a<br />
very simple and obvious point, that here in regard to<br />
this economic statement, you had a quite unique situation<br />
as distinct from any other one. Every other one has been<br />
delivered in the Parliament, nationally televised within<br />
that framework. Here, for the first time, it wasn't done<br />
in the Parliament. It was done in the more heated<br />
S environment of an election campaign. I think within<br />
those circumstances probably those who've been associated<br />
with it, Paul and myself have done as well as you could.<br />
But let me say this. As far as the rest of the campaign<br />
is concerned I'm looking forward very very very much to<br />
expounding our wages policy against their absence of a<br />
wages policy, our superannuation policy against their<br />
commitment to absolutely destroy the existing<br />
superannuation system. And that will be a very<br />
interesting proposition because, as I said at the<br />
beginning of this press conference, the Achilles heel,<br />
the point which will destroy the credibility of the<br />
Opposition, is their absence of a predictable wages<br />
outcome. You cannot conduct economic policy in this<br />
country if you can't conduct wages policy.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, is there any prospect in your<br />
next term of a reduction in the top marginal personal<br />
rate to the corporate rate or will it stay at the present<br />
level?<br />
PM: I give no commitment to outcomes but let me say<br />
this. I'll just ask you to look at our record. When we<br />
came to office the top rate was 60 cents and the bottom<br />
rate 30. We've brought it down to 47 and the bottom rate<br />
to 21. So as distinct from all the rhetoric from the<br />
conservatives about taxation, we are ones who've acted to<br />
bring the rates down. And we will approach this matter<br />
in terms of economic responsibility. If, as the economic<br />
situation unfolds, some further reductions would be<br />
appropriate and responsible, then that will be done.<br />
JOURNALIST: Today a high technology that makes<br />
heart pacemakers has decided to leave Australia and<br />
manufacture in the United States. Ralph Sarich..<br />
likewise last year. Does it concern you that we're<br />
losing these and why do we seem to lack a technical </p>

PM: Of course that is a completely loaded question. I<br />
will simply respond to it by saying that in a country<br />
like this that's open to people if they want to make that<br />
decision. In the case of Sarich to whom you refer, we<br />
gave very significant financial incentives to him, as did<br />
the Government of Western Australia. But we were, if I<br />
can coin a phrase without being subject to criticism,<br />
incentives. The State Michigan in the United States<br />
gave a very significantly greater incentive. Mr Sarich<br />
made the judgement in those circumstances that he'd be<br />
better off going there. But I'll simply reply to your<br />
proposition by saying that if you want to I will take you<br />
to enterprise after enterprise in Australia,<br />
sophisticated manufactured products where within the<br />
Australian environment Australian enterprises are taking<br />
on the best in the world in the most competitive markets<br />
in the world and beating them. As I said last night, 54%<br />
real increase in manufactured exports in the last four<br />
years. And if you really want to get the contrast, and<br />
again you get down to a matter of choice on the 24th of<br />
March, just look at the Australian steel industry and<br />
think about that. When I came to office in March of 1983<br />
BHP, as everyone knows, was contemplating closing down<br />
the steel industry. After seven years of conservative<br />
government the Australian steel industry was virtually<br />
destroyed. I saved the steel industry. And because of<br />
the fact that our policies are giving predictable wage<br />
outcomes, a significant 60% reduction in industrial<br />
disputes, and a new era of co-operation between<br />
management and labor, has produced a situation where the<br />
Australian steel industry is now a massive exporter of<br />
steel, is undertaking further investment now to enlarge<br />
its export capacity. So those are the facts. And simply<br />
because you can pick one who's made a decision to go<br />
overseas, so what?<br />
