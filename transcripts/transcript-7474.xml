TRANSCRIPT OF PRESS CONFERENCE<br />
HOTEL SHILLA, SEOUL<br />
31 JANUARY 1989<br />
E AND OE PROOF ONLY<br />
( Journalist) Prime Minister, I have a domestic question,<br />
if I could, how concerned are you about the CPI<br />
( Mr Hawke) Obviously we are disappointed that it's as<br />
high as it is but you will have seen from what my colleague,<br />
Treasurer Paul Keating has had to say, that there are some<br />
very special reasons for the figure being as high as it<br />
is and that is the way in which there's been effected into<br />
the calculations the movements in housing costs. Now, the<br />
fundamental point is that it assumes that every household<br />
in Australia buys a new house every quarter which is quite<br />
unrealistic and if that's abstracted, the figure for the<br />
December quarter would not be the 2.1 but 1.4% and for the<br />
year not 7.7 but 6.8% and as the Treasurer points out if<br />
you make a comparison between Darwin and Sydney you can<br />
see the unreality of the figures. So when you look at the<br />
Sdownward movements of the elements in the index of beer,<br />
pharmaceuticals, the health sector, fresh vegetables, we<br />
are convinced the fundamental scenario that we believed<br />
at the time of the budget is taking place that we are looking<br />
at the downward movement in the fundamental inflation rate<br />
Sand there is no reason therefore, in our judgement, to<br />
for instance in the area of wages, suggest that there has<br />
got to be some revision of the strategy that we've had in<br />
mind there.<br />
( Journalist) Do you feel confident that inflation has<br />
come down this year.<br />
Mr Hawke Well what I said when I was asked, I didn't proffer<br />
a view, I was asked will interest rates come down this year,<br />
I was asked within the latter part of January, I expressed<br />
the view then that I think they will sometime in 1989. / 2. </p>
<p>-2-<br />
( Journalist) Do you still hold to the view, Mr Hawke,<br />
that they won't go up before they come down.<br />
( Mr Hawke) : Well let me put it this way. As far as we're<br />
concerned, I share the view expressed by the Treasurer today<br />
in his press conference on the release of these figures,<br />
that we believe that the monetary policy as far as the<br />
government is concerned is appropriately tight. Now obviously<br />
with the release of these figures there may be some reaction<br />
in the market, but the important question is what the<br />
government' s attitude is as far as we're concerned we believe<br />
that it is appropriately tight.<br />
( J ournalist) : How much more difficult does this now make<br />
* it to achieve a satisfactory wages outcome.<br />
( Mr Hawke) : Well I only had the opportunity of seeing a<br />
brief reference to ACTLJ reaction since I returned from lunch<br />
with the FTA, but it does seem to me that the public statement<br />
from the ACTU is that * there's no reason to depart from the<br />
existing wages strategy and I certainly hope that will, be<br />
the case.<br />
( Journalist) Even with those adjustments Mr Hawke you're<br />
still a long way off budget projections. isn't there a need<br />
to assess your fundamental ( Mr Hawke starts speaking)<br />
( Mr Hawke) : Well 1.. 4 I mean you'd be, 1.4 for the December<br />
quarter. -I'm taking into account the September quarter,<br />
itself appropriately adjusted for this factor. You are not<br />
that far above the sort of order of figure for the end<br />
1988/ 89. I don't see any reason on those figures to panic<br />
in any way. The question is are the things that the government's<br />
doing having the sort of impact on inflation that we want<br />
Wand that is it. Are we looking at a fundamental downward<br />
trend I think the answer is yes and of course I should<br />
make the observation as Paul Keating said today after consultations<br />
with me by phone this morning, we will specifically address<br />
the issue which has been reflected in this large increase<br />
that is housing costs. I, as you know, wrote some months<br />
ago to the Premiers to address this question, asking them<br />
to address the question of making more land available so<br />
that you could have on the supply side an impact on costs and for<br />
our part we ' ye got our own task force looking at the question<br />
of what Commonwealth land in capital cities may be released<br />
to release pressures and I've agreed with Paul Keating that<br />
I'll summon a meeting of the Premiers to address this aspect<br />
of the impact of rising house and land prices. So, in the<br />
area that we're responsible for we think it's going in the right<br />
direction and insofar as we can do something further to address<br />
this element we're going to tend to do it. </p>
<p>( Journalist) Mr Hawke are you suggesting that the housing<br />
factor might be abstracted out somehow or other in terms<br />
of the wages outlook.<br />
( Mr Hawke) Well I think, let me put it this way. It would<br />
be ridiculous for instance wouldn't it to apply nationally,<br />
the national wage case approach a figure which is dominated<br />
by Sydney where wage and salary earners throughout, the rest<br />
of Australia have not been affected by that impact and where<br />
existing householders are not effected. If anything the<br />
impact of the rising prices to those that have got the<br />
houses to increase their equity to make them better off<br />
not worse off, as the Treasurer said. So I think that the<br />
ACTU will responsibly understand that in those circumstances,<br />
Jeff, it doesn't make sense to jeopardize the whole wages,<br />
Sprices, competitive position outcome because of this factor.<br />
I mean it's not a terribly esoteric thing that we've got<br />
to explain to them and I think they understand it.<br />
( Journalist) Given that all families either pay rent or<br />
repayments is it not cheating to just ignore the impact<br />
of housing costs.<br />
( Mr Hawke) No because what I've said in substituting 1.4<br />
for 2.1 doesn't take rents out of it. I mean that leaves<br />
the rent component in it.<br />
( Journalist) When you say you're confident the ACTU will<br />
understand, Mr Hawke, have you had any indication of the<br />
executive's position or are you just ( trails off)<br />
( Mr Hawke) No, I'm I'm I'm as I've said, Michelle, I'm<br />
going on the report that I've seen the fax report of some<br />
comments that have been made. I've had no personal discussion,<br />
SI've obviously had no chance to do this but I would believe<br />
that in the discussions with the Treasurer will have with<br />
the ACTU that they will understand the good sense of the<br />
approach that I'm suggesting and which the Treasurer is<br />
suggesting. I wonder if a question<br />
( Journalist) Could you say something about you visit for<br />
those of us who aren't from Australia.<br />
( Mr Hawke) Yeah sure. It's a bit esoteric this stuff right.<br />
( Journalist) Can you tell us about your meeting with<br />
President Roh 4.<br />
I I </p>
<p>-4-<br />
( Mr H-awke) : Yeah sure. Well let me, just before I do that,<br />
if there are any further questions afterwards about this,<br />
we'll come back. Before going to that meeting in particular<br />
I'll make some general observations about the visit, I want<br />
to say as I said at the luncheon I've just attended sponsored<br />
by the Korean business community, that in 1988 in our<br />
Bicentennial year, we were really at home and at host. We<br />
had people coming from all over the world. Now, 1989 I'll<br />
be undertaking a number of visits, to a number of countries,<br />
and it is significant, I think that the first country that<br />
we are visiting in 1989 is Korea. It comes soon after the<br />
meeting I had with President Roh in November and at that<br />
meeting I think firstly we established a warm personal<br />
relationship and it's certainly been consolidated by the<br />
meeting I've had with him and others of his Ministers and<br />
leaders of this community, including the opportunity I had<br />
tis morning of meeting with leaders of the Opposition<br />
Parties. Something of course that I wouldn't have been able<br />
to do in my last visit here in 1984 and it's a measure I<br />
think of the change in the situation in Korea that some<br />
two and a half years ago the Australian Ambassador was in<br />
trouble with the authorities for daring to actually have<br />
a dinner meeting with Kim Dae Jung. On this occasion he<br />
was a welcome guest at the dinner hosted by the President<br />
last night and I had a meeting with him today so that gives<br />
you if you if you like some sense of the background, generally.<br />
and by way of comparison with my last visit. Now, in the<br />
meeting with President Roh, essentially our discuss; ions<br />
came into these categories. We talked about the global context<br />
and agreed that we do indeed now lead our countries at a<br />
uniquely important time. In that he agrees with me that<br />
this is an occasion more than at any time in the post-war<br />
period when there is ground for optimism in the assessment<br />
one makes of the relations between the super powers and<br />
that that has created not only a thawing of the relationship<br />
between the United States and the Soviet Union and China<br />
has been involved in this thawing vis a vis particularly<br />
with the Soviet Union but that this has been reflected<br />
in the easing of tensions in a number of spots around the<br />
world most obviously Afghanistan, Nambibia, Angola which<br />
both the United States and the Soviet Union had an important<br />
role to play and there is increasing evidence in Cambodia<br />
that there are grounds for optimism there and of course<br />
within that context really that we had the next Cabinet<br />
discussion that is the regional impact of these changes<br />
and other regional initiatives in the political field. I<br />
again spoke in some length with President Roh on the question<br />
of his Northern policy because when he was with me in Australia </p>
<p>in November he outlined in some detail his intention to<br />
pursue the initiative of trying to have contacts with ' the<br />
North, his Northern policy and in that period there have<br />
been developments. The details of those developments and<br />
indicated to me his intention to continue that thrust of<br />
policy to try and increase the contacts, the level and<br />
depth of the contacts, and of course he had encouraged me<br />
in Australia in November to on Australia's behalf to open<br />
up contacts with the North. Since we've met him we've done<br />
that, we had some of our officials in the North earlier<br />
this month and then just on 26 January we had our Ambassador<br />
in Beijing meet with one of the Deputy Prime Ministers of<br />
the North in Beijing and we, had further discussions. We<br />
have kept the President informed of those developments,<br />
he welcomed them and we have undertaken to keep them informed<br />
of those developments and I've made it clear that insofar<br />
as we are opening up further dialogue with the North there<br />
will be a conditionality about that approach in that<br />
Australia's preparedness to go further in substance will<br />
be a function of how ready the North is prepared to engage<br />
in constructive dialogue with the South. And the third<br />
category, if you like of our discusions was with our bilateral<br />
relations and we were pleased to see that the initiatives<br />
that were launched in Australia. In November are being<br />
effectively progressed in particular agreement to establish<br />
and Australia-Korea Forum is proceeding. I have nominated<br />
the Australian co-Chairman of that. The Koreans are in the<br />
process of doing that and we are expecting them by the end<br />
of this year that important Forum meeting will be * held.<br />
The Cultural Commission which we agreed to establish in<br />
November will have its first meeting here in Seoul in April<br />
or May. So you can see that we've discussed a range of issues<br />
and I think it's fair to say that we found ourselves at<br />
one on virtually every issue that we discussed. I see this<br />
visit coming on top of his visit to Australia as consolidating<br />
very much the already strong relations which exist between<br />
our two countries and providing the basis for growth not<br />
only in the economic relationship but in other areas which<br />
will underpin the economic relationship. I </p>

<p>JQU I'MALJJST the I1% orian G; over~ nment asked the Australian<br />
Covcornment to 1investigate ajnd expose anty assets owned by<br />
Churi-Loo Hlaan arid his family. is the investigatibri going<br />
on right now anid what have the~ y found so f ar?<br />
PH: I t is true that we iere .3ske~ d to do that, and we agreed<br />
to do it. Thp iiventiqatiori has takeni place. I haven't yet<br />
received thce final report.<br />
JOURN4ALIST: When are you expectinq it?<br />
P1M, I do'n't k~ now. . I don't interfere in thesse matters. You<br />
ask the authorities to undertakS 3 i eport. We have<br />
confidenco in our authorities that they will efficiently and<br />
effectively undertakq the request that you make of them.<br />
rliey are dtuinq that and we'll rocotivo i~ t in due course.<br />
URIMST: Are * you satisfied that the intorination that<br />
4U'aVLIrcie from the South Korean C'ovternment is<br />
sufficient to undertake such an investigation? There have<br />
been sonme repo~ rts that Australia was utnhappy because it had<br />
been asked to investigato but not really been given enough to<br />
go on to make such a..<br />
PH: I've been around in public life, in politics, in the<br />
P'rime Minister's posi tioii now for six years and as my<br />
colleagues from the Australian media know 1 don't always<br />
believe every report I hear and read. ' That's one I don't.<br />
JOURNALIST: Are you satistied witti the iniformation?<br />
11-: Yes, yes.<br />
.1JQUF NAL Is T Do you think that thn hevalth of the Australian<br />
economy is now being hold hostage to the Government's tax<br />
cuts in July?<br />
0: No, I see the provision of t-ax
part of both econom~ ic and social poJlicy. I repeat that what<br />
we've said from the beginninq, ri. qjht back1 last year, that<br />
the~ re is a rs1~ tionship between what we'il do ini the tax area<br />
w'ith what wiill happen in the wages area. We are waiting to<br />
spe what wvill happen in the waqes area. my colleagues in my<br />
absence will be enciaged In discussions wiith the trade unions<br />
arid as I said I hope well be beginning to see discussions<br />
with the employers as well. [ t would miake sense front the<br />
point ( if view of tire health of the Australian economny if tho<br />
satisfaction of the leciitininto aspirations of Austialians for<br />
maintoaaatc and graduai improvement of I i'iing stanidards can<br />
to, smec extent be affected by the tax cut mechanism rather<br />
than by an otherwise higher level ot w. aqe increases. That<br />
MiaKeS econonric sense as wel~ l as socia. sense.<br />
j CIU ItNAL. I ST You said to'. day and you'vce sai~ d conisistently that<br />
the Montreal Review fa.' iud. Do 1Nc'-rth Americanm trading<br />
bloc.. ks, the European tr-ading blocks remain in [ low do the<br />
As ian P'aciftic countri es tackle it -it they don' t form their<br />
ow., n pr'jtrctivHi mechanism? </p>
<p>111-1 1 think you'vye got to look at. thIis in stl. ens I liav" i<br />
. is you know, cons intentl,, y madr) it c leal that the ? tUSLt I~ a. ial<br />
position is one of undil ted c61inmit. ment. to the multilat ~ eral<br />
tl' 3dlnJ sys temn. I do that in an his. tor ical in a broad<br />
hiustorica1 sense.. I'm tiot sure that you have the Davi;<br />
spe~ ech&amp; I inade at the foref~ rontI. iA' yc'iri mind, you should, it',<br />
ai very ( lood speech. T'he point I made there is that if you<br />
ñ-tudy history, thern are inany lessons you can qpt fromi<br />
hiistory, but one less; on you can certainly qet from~ history Is<br />
that economic autarchay lias alIways been the precursor to<br />
political conflict. There is no reason to bolieve as come<br />
to the end of the 20th century that history is c ioin'j to<br />
change now because e happen to be hers and that it would be<br />
inconveiiient for history to repeat itsolf. History is verly<br />
likely to repeat itself. So on that basis there is a vested<br />
iiiterest, a political interest as well as the obviouis<br />
ieconoimic interest in tryingi to seo that thle multilatern] l<br />
system prevails. Australia will be second to none both<br />
b individually and in terms of trying to harness the capacities<br />
anid abil ities of others to try and achieve that objectivo.<br />
As I naid in my speech today, ons of the benefits of a move<br />
toward:; the creation of a regional iranoiwork of the OFCD<br />
U/ po, not a trading block typie, wias that I believed that that<br />
cu-i--d help to harness the capacities of the countrien of the<br />
regi n to pressure the rest of the wo) rld to understand the<br />
truth of what I'm talking about in this regard. N~ ow havinq<br />
said that, as you know I amn by naiture an optim. ist. arid we wi. l<br />
do overything we can to achieve that result.. I don't want<br />
this to be * misunderstood, what I say. Listen carofuLly<br />
what, I say. If you took the riost pessimistic scenario for<br />
the future and the best dedicated elforts ot Australia and<br />
like inrded countries. were to fadi and the mnu] tilate-ral<br />
system , fere to break down and the GATIT systitt wern to fall<br />
apart and you saw, in other words-a determination an the<br />
part of others to conduct their internationatl trading<br />
relationships via blocks, then in those circumstances if the<br />
countries of this region had advanced along the path that I vi<br />
talking about and for the purposes that Ci m talk ing abo. ut,<br />
* you would I suppose have the building blocks then for a<br />
ire-ourse that in those, I hopn, entirely hope in hypothetical<br />
circumstances, you would bo able to take tho action that<br />
would be necessary to protect yourself.<br />
JOURNALIST: on the meeting with Premiers. Is that In<br />
addition to the Premiers'I mecting in June?<br />
PM4: Yes, it will be before that.<br />
JOURNAL I sr: Will, industry associations be invited?<br />
P14: Well as you know this Cor. vsrnient has always had vegry<br />
e, lorso and constructive relatiLonships with thet Housing<br />
Industry Association. They have m~ ade some usefuil inputs into<br />
t. hin areca and whether 1n fact they wore formally part icipaniLs<br />
in the conference, that may ntot. be-at ' propriate, I would<br />
certainly see that. they wepre . Involved in understanding the<br />
pronarations and if they any part icular input theoy wanted to<br />

it is that, we can do both withlin Australia in co-oper3tion<br />

Australia an associdt ion Of chlorof louvocarbc'n consumers arid<br />

indicated to the President Ihe importance we attach to this<br />
and indicatod that theire would be a p'rep~ aredness, a<br />
wi Llingness on our parrt to look at the transfe~ r of the<br />

President Roh agreed with me on the importance of this issue<br />
and weYlcomed the suggestion for the possible traniztor of<br />
technology arid v-e have agireed that thorn willitie a moeting<br />
between our off icials to fO* tb'. W this fflattOr. rChe second<br />
specific point is that I welcomed thme recommendations of the<br />

<p>JOURNALIST: Do you know how much support there is for your<br />
regional initative and how do you think it will tit in with<br />
thae proposal that was coming from Japan the other day about a<br />
possible ministerial meeting?<br />
PM: The letter wsent out relatively recently raising the<br />
question of the need for further consultation. What I've<br />
done here is to advance that one step further. So the answer<br />
to your question Michelle is it's too earl y yet to know what<br />
the reaction is. All I can say is that tho only leader that<br />
I've tested the idea on, President Roh, has embraced it<br />
completely and enthusiastically. I hope that In the<br />
relatively near future we'll got further responses. There<br />
may be different perceptions. I think there'll be unanimity<br />
about the need for further co-opexation. The processes and<br />
the end objectives obviously there'll be some differences<br />
about. The important thinq I think is that we have g iven<br />
qf rom Australia's point of vinw a thrunt now in the-region<br />
yowards pursuing the need for further co-operatiocn. We have<br />
ut up a suggestion if you like as a sort oñ type of model<br />
and we don't want t~ o be prescriptive about it. What we do<br />
WAnt to do is to ensure that tho dialogue and the discussion<br />
develops reasonabl. y rapidly.<br />
JOURNALIST: Do you think the major trading nations of the<br />
region up till now havo done enough to) support the GATT<br />
system or have they been sitting baick a bit?<br />
PM4: Yuu can't, when you're talking about a region, think of<br />
it in monolithia termis. Let mie say this, that there has been<br />
a very substantial response to our twn initiatives. Firstly<br />
the November ' 8i3 initiative which I launched in Banqkok which<br />
asked the countries of the region to be involved with us in<br />
pre-Urugjuay round discussions. There's been a very<br />
substantial and continuina response to that. Secondly with<br />
the establishmen * t of the Cairns Group there's also been an<br />
invol~ vement in that. I think t~ hat generally speaking the<br />
* 1 ountries of this region do see, share our perception of<br />
the need to ensure that the mnulti~ lateral open trading system<br />
is rescued and strengthened. I tend to believe that that<br />
perception will increase. After all, time is running out on<br />
thq Uruguay timetable, it's a tour year timetable, they're<br />
more than half-way through now. There's going to be the<br />
meeting in April. They have reached aqreement on 11 areas,<br />
as you know, there were four that weren't. Yut the attitude<br />
will strongly be of mnxy countriles who have given agreement<br />
to the 11 areas that they will make their agqreement on those<br />
conditiunal to achievinq agreement in the other areas which<br />
are, as you know, textiles, intellectuail property safeguards<br />
and agriculture. There's not a great dea. l of time and 1<br />
think that that sense of pressure will heighten the<br />
perceptions of the countries in the region. Ju. st one fina. l<br />
point just before I go off to an important meeting with the<br />
Vres ident is Lhis. it is remarkablie, the paradox of our<br />
times, it is a remarkable paradox in that we see in political<br />
teivms a greater reason, broader grounds for optimism than at<br />
any time in the post war period fur the reasons I've outlined<br />
to you betore and which I don't roiterate now. It is a more<br />
congenial international political environment which gives us I </p>
<p>PM ( cont) moro ground for hope and which is producing in<br />
various areas of . the world concrete results. The paradox is<br />
that while there is ground for political optimism, on the<br />
economic front, which as I've said before ultimately can<br />
dHtermine political outcomes, the world is being far less<br />
than sensible and is in some rospects going somewhat<br />
backwards. I hope that that paradox will be resolved in the<br />
right way.<br />
