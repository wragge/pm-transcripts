QUEENSLAND BROADCAST NO. 3<br />
GROWTH CENTRES<br />
6 APRIL 1975<br />
During the Easter weekend, I visited Albury<br />
where 2,000 delegates from all over Australia were attending<br />
the Annual Apex Convention. As well as attending the Apex<br />
Convention I was able to see the progress being made on one of<br />
the most exciting experiments ever undertaken in Australia.<br />
The governments of New South Wales and Victoria are<br />
cooperating fully with the Australian Government in the<br />
development of Albury-Wodonga as a-growth centre. There<br />
on the banks of the Murray, the three governments and the<br />
people of Albury-Wodonga are working together to create<br />
what will be virttually a new inland city Australia's first<br />
such since the founding of Canberra itself, more than<br />
sixty years ago. Reflecting on what is happening in Albury,<br />
one can't help drawing a contrast with what is happeningor<br />
rather, what is not happening here in Queensland to<br />
be precise, here in Townsville where I am recording this<br />
broadcast. It's a very unfortunate story. For the fact is<br />
that the development taking place in Albury, the finance<br />
being made available, could be and should be paralleled in<br />
Townsville. In the policy speech for the elections of<br />
1972, I said this: " In our first term of office, a Federal<br />
Labor Government will concentrate its own<br />
initiatives and endeavours on two areas-<br />
Albury-Wodonga and Townsville. At<br />
Albury-Wodonga the Commonwealth has all the<br />
ingredients for a successful effort to establish<br />
another inland city the size of Canberra*.<br />
The Commonwealth is already responsible for<br />
decisions which have determined the growth and<br />
the burdens of Townsville more than any other<br />
-Austra-lian city, except Canberra itself."<br />
That was what I said in 1972. The new government<br />
moved very promptly to meet its undertakings. The<br />
Albury-Wodonga project is going ahead. Townsville has<br />
stalled. Why the difference?<br />
I have to be quite blunt. The sole difference<br />
lies in the attitude of the State Governments concerned.<br />
From the beginning, we had good cooperation from<br />
the Premiers of New South Wales and Victoria. Sure, there<br />
were problems to be sorted out. The State Governments both<br />
of them incidentally, non-Labor Governments sought and<br />
obtained assurances about their own role and responsibilities.<br />
That's fair enough. </p>
<p>But the important thing was that the basic approach<br />
by the three governments was a desire to cooperate, a<br />
desire to see that the project succeeds. During my Easter<br />
visit to Albury, I was able to make a joint statement with the<br />
Premiers of New South Wales and Victoria, announcing that we<br />
had signed an agreement providing $ 40 million from the<br />
Australian Government for further development at Albury-Wodonga.<br />
So the work is going ahead. My promise of 1972 is being<br />
fulfilled. I am afraid I can't report the same progress with<br />
Townsville. The fruitful cooperation we have had with the<br />
non-Labor Government in New South Wales and Victoria just<br />
has not been forthcoming from the Queensland Government.<br />
In both the 1973 Budget and last year's Budget, we allocated"<br />
very substantial sums to the States for land acquisition<br />
and growth centre programs $ 30 million in 1973,<br />
$ 125 million in 1974-75. Initially we offered the Queensland<br />
Government over $ 4 million specifically for development in<br />
Towns ville. That offer has never been taken up.<br />
Our interest in Townsville is very close. The<br />
growth of Townsville in recent years has owed very much to<br />
initiatives by the Australian Government, to decisions made<br />
indeed by the previous Australian Government. The James<br />
Cook University, the Marine Research Institute and the choice<br />
of Townsville as the headquarters of our northern defence<br />
system h ave shaped the Townsville of today. The growth<br />
that these institutions and installations have brought, has<br />
also imposed very heavy burdens on Townsville's services<br />
and amenities. It would be intolerable for any Australian<br />
Government to ignore the consequences of its own initiatives<br />
for the people of Townsville the taxpayers, the rat(% payers.<br />
We can't expect the people of Townsville to foot the bill for<br />
new community needs which have been created by decisions In<br />
of the Australian Government, so we want to contribute. We<br />
want to cooperate with the State Government and Townsville's<br />
local authorities, to ensure that Townsville grows in a<br />
well-ordered, well-planned way, that proper community services<br />
are provided, that land prices are held down. But we<br />
jus t are not receiving the necessary cooperation.<br />
Why should this be so? What nonsense it is<br />
to talk of this being an example of centralism, and what<br />
nonsense it is to talk of this in terms of State rights.<br />
what we offer is a splendid opportunity for genuine<br />
decentralisation. This is what is being achieved at Albury-<br />
Wodongai. Why' should it not be achieved in Queensland?<br />
Why should the non-Labor Premier of Queensland refuse the kind<br />
of cooperation we have had from the non-Labor Premiers of<br />
New South Wales and Victoria. What is it that Mr Bjelke-<br />
Petersen sees so sinister in an offer which is perfectly<br />
acceptable to Mr Lewis and Mr Hamer? .3 </p>
<p>-3-<br />
It is not too late although with every month<br />
that passes the problems of Townsville's growth will<br />
mount and the cost of solving them will go up.<br />
But our offer the offer I made in 1972 still stands.<br />
It requires only a word from Mr Bjelke-Petersen a word<br />
that would indicated his willingness to cooperate in<br />
the way that his southern colleagues are cooperating<br />
This is something of concern to Townsville. It is in the<br />
interest of Queensland as a whole that the Australian<br />
Government should be involved in developing growth centres,<br />
not only in Townsville but also in the Fitzroy and Moreton<br />
regions. But if these projects are to go ahead, then we<br />
must have cooperation from the State Government. Queenslanders<br />
should insist that that cooperation is forthcoming. </p>
