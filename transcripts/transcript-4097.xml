MF-' 4 SOUTH WALFS CAMPAIGN OPENING<br />
This election is a choice between the responsible, realistic<br />
and progressive Government offered by the Liberal Country<br />
Parties and the irresponsible extravagance of the Labor Party.<br />
in December last year the people of Australia, the people of<br />
New South Wales, decisively endorsed the Liberal Country Party<br />
approach to solving Australia's problems.<br />
The people overwhelmingly rejected the Labor Party which had<br />
done so much damage to Australia.<br />
At the Federal level, we now have a. Government committed to<br />
strengthening freedom, opportunity and concern for all Australians,<br />
a Government committed to responsibility to restoring prosperity,<br />
to giving Australians the opportunity of achieving their goals in<br />
life.<br />
But alongside a responsible Federal Government, Australia also<br />
requires Stato Governments committed to playing their part in<br />
working for a return to prosperity.<br />
Both in the. State and Federal spheres, the Liberal and Country<br />
Parties are the only parties offering idealistic and responsible<br />
Government. The philosophy of the Liberal Party is the only philosophy which<br />
can provide realistic, responsible Government, and progressive<br />
enlightened reform.<br />
More and more people are realising that Labor's approach does not<br />
work. It is easy to promise to spend more and more of the<br />
taxpayez ' s -money on more and more Government schemes. Some<br />
of these schemes are for worthwhile ends. But all these schemes<br />
have to be paid for paid for, through higher taxes. These taxes<br />
in turn, eat away at the ability of individuals and families<br />
to meet their own needs, make their own decisions about how their<br />
earnings will be spent. This approach in the end just creates<br />
new problems.<br />
It reduces people's capacity to meet their own needs and make them<br />
more and more dependent on what politicians choose ' to give them.<br />
it fuels inflation, creates unemployment, and undermines prosperity. </p>
<p>-2-<br />
The Wran Labor Party is sounding more and more like the Whitlam<br />
Labor Pa rty of 1972 -making promises which will lead to higher<br />
taxes, more inflation, more unemployment.<br />
No wonder he does not want Mr Whitlam to come into New South<br />
Wales for thi s election. He is frightened people will notice<br />
the similarities between his programme and Mr Whitlam's.<br />
The Labor Party still has not realised that their approach does<br />
not work.<br />
In December 1975 the Federal Liberal and Country Party Government<br />
began the task of bringing constructive management to Australia's<br />
affairs. Our first task was to bring Labor's wild and extravagant spending<br />
under control.<br />
We have already made savings at the rate of over $ 1 billion in<br />
a full year.<br />
We have halted the grcowth of the Federal bureaucracy.<br />
We have adopted a range of constructive policies to encourag e<br />
business to expand plant and equipment and provide jobs.<br />
We have introduced a comprehensive set of fle xible monetary<br />
measures. We have begun a review of the mass of Labo r's crippling regulations.<br />
We have undertaken a realistic wages policy which has the<br />
overwhelming support of the Australian people.'<br />
With the measures we have undertaken, we -have already been<br />
able to introduce a feasible home savings grant scheme well<br />
ahead of the tiLme announced during the election.<br />
We are going to introduce one of the most important tax reforms<br />
in Australia's history -tax indexation.<br />
We have made a start.<br />
We ne ed Sir Eric Willis as Premier of Australia's largest state<br />
-we need the support he will give to our programme.<br />
New South Wales cannot afford a Labor Government. Australia<br />
cannot afford a Labor Government in New South Wales.<br />
Unless inflation is brought under control there will never be<br />
jobs for all who want to work because business will not have<br />
the confidence to invest and consumers to spend.<br />
The solutions to both unemployment and inflation are bound up<br />
together. Where was Wran when the Labor Party in Canberra was undermining<br />
Australia's prosperity? </p>
<p>-3-<br />
Judging y comments this week he seems to support Mr Whitlam's<br />
view th t the States should remain financially dependent on<br />
Canberra. The electors of New South Wales are entitled to know whether he<br />
shares Mr Whitlam's view that the role of State Labor Parliamentarians<br />
is to bring about their own dissolution.<br />
What self respecting political leader could hold that view?"<br />
We believe that power must be shared between the Commonwealth<br />
and the States, between State Government and Local Government<br />
and within the broader community. I<br />
The Labor Party believes that all power should be centralised<br />
in a few men, that Government should have much greater control<br />
over the lives of everyone in every part of Australia.<br />
Labor tried to destroy the States and centralise control over<br />
Local Government.<br />
The Labor Party tried-to destroy the Senate which was established<br />
by the Constitution to protect the States.<br />
In the Labor Party's view, all wisdom resided in a few men in<br />
Canberra. Many thousands of Australians are now paying the price for that<br />
approach'-school leavers still trying to find jobs, retired'<br />
people whose savings have been eaten away by inflation, the<br />
poor andthe disadvantaged whom inflation affects worst of all.<br />
TheLiberal Party has pledged itself to one of the most important<br />
and progressive reforms in Australia's history.<br />
Our Federalism policy will be the strongest guarantee that<br />
irresponsible attempts to centralise all power in the hands of<br />
a few men can never succeed in Australia again.<br />
Our Federalism policy will ensure that the States and Local-<br />
Government will have a guaranteed and flexible source of income.<br />
After this reform the people will have a clear view of which<br />
Government is spending their money. It is a reform which should<br />
give people' greater effective control over Government spending.<br />
Sir Eric Willis has been a major force in supporting this reform<br />
because he knows that it will be of great benefit to the people<br />
of New South Wales.<br />
The people of New South Wales are entitled to know whether the<br />
Labor Party in this State will support our Federalism policy or<br />
whether they stand by the Labor Party's traditional view of<br />
centralising all real power in the hands of a few. G </p>
<p>-4-<br />
When the Liberal Party's Federalism Policy is put into effect<br />
participation by people in local-and State Government will be<br />
more effective. Decisions especially affecting Local communities<br />
and the States will again be made where they s * hould be made<br />
by the Government closest to the people affected.<br />
Sir Eric Willis and the Liberal Party in New South Wales will<br />
work enthusiastically to bring about this vital reform.<br />
To say that this reform means double taxation is totally false.<br />
There will be one form, one assessment, one set of tax rules,<br />
one system. It will mean that you will be able to see who is<br />
spending your money. It will also give the States greater<br />
flexibility. It will mean that governments will1 have to stand<br />
and be counted and take responsibility for their own actions.<br />
I am not surprised that Mr Wran does not want the system.<br />
Like Mr Whitlam he is looking for a scape-goat. He wants the<br />
Commonwealth to be that scape-goat. Sir Eric Willis, as any<br />
self-respecting Premier ought to be, is prepared to stand and<br />
be counted. It is a system which would be wanted by anyone who<br />
is not frightened to take responsibility for his own commitments.<br />
The return of a Liberal Country Party Government will en sure<br />
that relations between the Federal Government and New South<br />
Wales will continue to be based on genuine cooperation and<br />
good will.<br />
Australians are, demanding greater responsibility from their<br />
Governments. Our reforms of the Federal system will be a<br />
significant step in securing that objective.<br />
I * t is one thing to offer a grab-bag of promises it is another<br />
to have to take responsibility for paying for** them.<br />
, only on the basis of responsibility can we-get Australia growing<br />
again. on ly if real economic growth can be got under way again can there<br />
be genuine improvement in the position of the disadvantaged and<br />
the weaker sections of the community.<br />
The Liberal Party is a Party for all Australians.<br />
Despite all its pretensions, the Labor Party has damaged<br />
weaker sections of the community through its incompetence.<br />
Fine words are worth nothing if they are not matched by a willingness<br />
to look reality in the face and do the hard work that good<br />
Government requires.<br />
The Federal and State Liberal Parties stand together in their<br />
belief in reform which ensures greater responsibility, greater<br />
freedom, greater independence combined with a deep concern for<br />
those who are truly disadvantaged.<br />
That is the path along which our philosophy directs us.<br />
That is the path the Australian people chose in December.<br />
That is the path I believe the people of New South Wales will<br />
choose on 1st May. </p>
