<p>Ladies and gentlemen, itâs a real honour for me to have so many members of our Australian Defence Force, our Australian Federal Police, our colleagues from overseas, our colleagues from interstate here in Parliament House this morning. And most of all, to have their families â your families â with us today.</p>
<p>I am very conscious of the fact that the last few weeks have been difficult and stressful times for our uniformed personnel, our ADF personnel, our police personnel, right around Australia, and indeed in brother and sister countries right around the world.</p>
<p>Iâm very conscious of the fact that two Australian police officers have suffered because they have worn our uniform and theyâve been keeping our country safe.</p>
<p>Iâm also very conscious of the fact that when our personnel in uniform are more in the line of fire than usual, theyâre families are under more stress than usual. Thatâs why I thought it was important to have as many as I could here in Parliament House today; thatâs why I thought it was important to bring as many families as I could here to Parliament House today to assure all of you that you have the full backing of your country, that you have the full backing of your Government.</p>
<p>You bask in the support and affection of the entire Australian people. So this is my opportunity as a representative of our country and of our people to say that I salute you, I admire you, I really appreciate the work that you do. Not just the work that you do, but the work that your families do, the support and love that your families give you because none of us can do anything important without the support of our families.</p>
<p>So, thank you so much for being here, I acknowledge Air Chief Marshal Binskin â the CDF. I acknowledge Andrew Colvin of the AFP. My friend â the Assistant Minister for Defence Stuart Robert, whoâs also here today. But most of all this is my chance to say a very big thank you on behalf of the Australian people to you and to your families.</p>
<p>We will never forget you and we will do everything we humanly can never to let you down.</p>
