    <content><![CDATA[<p>Innovation and science are critical for Australia to deliver new sources of growth, maintain high-wage jobs and seize the next wave of economic prosperity.</p>
<p>The National Innovation and Science Agenda will drive innovation in government, promote a culture of entrepreneurship and place innovation at the heart of everything we do.</p>
<p>Reforming procurement through a Digital Marketplace</p>
<p>The Government is investing $15 million to create a new digital marketplace to make it easier for startups and small and medium businesses to sell to and work with government.</p>
<p>The Digital Transformation Office (DTO) will develop the Digital Marketplace - an online directory of digital and ICT services from which government agencies will procure - to improve competition and promote innovation across government.</p>
<p>The Digital Marketplace will break down barriers to entry and make it easier for startups and small and medium businesses to compete for the $5 billion government spends on ICT each year.</p>
<p>Promoting collaboration in cyber security</p>
<p>The Government is investing $30 million to establish an industry-led Cyber Security Growth Centre to create business opportunities for Australia’s cyber security industries.</p>
<p>Attacks on Australia’s cyber network costs billions of dollars to the economy each year.</p>
<p>The Growth Centre will bring together industry, researchers and governments to develop a national cyber security strategy and coordinate research to reduce overlap and maximise impact. This will help all Australians and businesses be safer and more secure online.</p>
<p>It is the first initiative to be delivered under the Government’s Cyber Security Strategy, to be released in 2016.</p>
<p>Supporting data-driven innovation through open data</p>
<p>The Government will also release a Public Data Policy Statement as part of the National Innovation and Science Agenda to formalise the Government’s commitment to open data and data-driven innovation.</p>
<p>Government agencies will now be required to make appropriate data openly available by default in machine readable and anonymised form through data.gov.au</p>
<p>Spatial data, in particular, is becoming increasingly important to the economy given the rapid take-up and use of mobile devices in Australia.</p>
<p>The Government will release one of the most requested high-value datasets, PSMA Australia’s (PSMA) Geocoded National Address File (G-NAF), and their Administrative Boundaries datasets.</p>
<p>Making the G-NAF available under open data terms will remove barriers that restrict the data’s use and promote innovation.</p>
<p>These measures combined will help to create a more innovative and entrepreneurial Australia.</p>
