concluding remarks to that Statement that further measures<br />
to preserve and enhance the environment would be taken by my<br />
Government. And I said earlier this year that I would be<br />
issuing a progress report on the Environment Statement.<br />
Today I am meeting those commitments.<br />
While the purpose of this report is to inform you of the<br />
considerable progress that has already been made in<br />
implementing the undertakings given in ' Our Country, Our<br />
Future', I would not wish anyone to think that the task is<br />
nearly complete. I said in my original Statement that the<br />
measures announced in it would not put an end to the<br />
despoiling of the Earth, but that they would help. I can<br />
tell you now that they are helping, but there is a long road<br />
to travel before we as a community can claim to be good<br />
stewards of our natural heritage: before we can be sure<br />
that the world we pass on to our children one whose<br />
environment is protected and enriched.<br />
In our fourth term in office, we will continue to make the<br />
decisions needed to take our country further down the path<br />
of ecological sustainability. </p>
<p>2.<br />
The individual measures that my Government has taken are<br />
important, and I will report on those in some detail<br />
shortly. But it is the growing environmental awareness and.<br />
commitment in the community which is enabling us to<br />
implement these new environmental measures. If the<br />
Environment Statement played any small part in raising that<br />
awareness then it will have been worthwhile. And if people<br />
are increasingly prepared to make their own small individual<br />
contribu tions to restoring and preserving the environment<br />
and I believe they are then we can all look with greater<br />
optimism to bequeathing to our children a better environment<br />
than that which we inherited. I<br />
Some of the most serious environmental problems are global<br />
in nature and require global solutions.<br />
There is, of course, a limit to how much a nation of<br />
Australia's size can do in a global sense. But we are<br />
p articipating to the fullest extent of our capacity and I<br />
can say with pride that Australia is having an impact on<br />
global environmental issues far beyond Australia's size in<br />
the international community.<br />
Australia is leading the world in an international campaign<br />
to ban mining in Antarctica. And we have taken the lead in<br />
imposing a global ban on the barbaric practice of driftnet<br />
fishing. ' Australia is prominent in international efforts to<br />
address the greenhouse effect. We are setting the pace in<br />
phasing out the use of ozone-depleting CFCs.-And we are<br />
taking on a special responsibility in international efforts<br />
. opreserve the Earth's biological diversity. </p>
<p>3.<br />
An obvious impediment to good environmental management in<br />
the past has been that we simply have not had available to<br />
ual enough information to be able to make rational and<br />
informed decisions. This deficiency is now being addressed.<br />
My Government is funding a number of data bases and research<br />
efforts, which will provide the scientific underpinning for<br />
more informed decision making.<br />
I would now like to repo'rt to you, in some detail, on the<br />
progress that has been achieved in the implementation of the<br />
commitments made in the Environment Statement last year.<br />
LIZIIII<br />
The preservation of our soil and water resources remains an<br />
urgent task. -We cannot continue to degrade our productive<br />
lands as we have done in the past. In many ways this is our<br />
most pressing national environmental problem.<br />
The productive potential of Australian land has been reduced<br />
as a result of excessive clearance of native vegetation and<br />
overuse of soils. The result has been extensive erosion,<br />
salination, and water degradation.*<br />
The Government'sa main programs for dealing' with these<br />
problems are the National Soil Conservation Program and<br />
Landcare. The Australian Conservation Foundation and the<br />
National Farmers' Federation have been working closely with<br />
the Government in the development of these programs. The<br />
success of both of these approaches to overcoming soil, land<br />
and water degradation depends heavily-upon the co-operation<br />
of all resource users. Accordingly, the Environment<br />
Statement focussed on greater community awareness,<br />
participation and education concerning the importance of<br />
landcare and policies to improve it. </p>
<p>4.<br />
National S Il Canggryation Progrram ( NSUA~<br />
The NSCP started in 1983 and is aimed at changing land<br />
management practices and attitudes towards the use of our<br />
soil. In the Environment Statement we provided an<br />
additional $ 10 million to the NSCP for 1989-90. Over<br />
7 million of this has already been allocated to fund 492<br />
new projects.<br />
The NSCP has four major componients. The establishment of<br />
Community Landcare Support Groups has been facilitated by<br />
the allocation of $ 2.8 million. The aim of these groups is<br />
to encourage local community participation in projects which<br />
develop codes of practice for landuse, assess salinity<br />
damage, and trial techniques for improving farm planning. A<br />
clear indication of the success of this program is the<br />
interest shown in forming local groups. We have received a<br />
flood of applications, and these are now being processed.<br />
The inadequacy of basic data on the severity and extent of<br />
degradation has been a constraint in overcoming it. In<br />
1989-90, $ 2.3 million has been provided to undertake an<br />
assessment of land degradation in Australia. It is expected<br />
that such an assessment for the whole of Australia will take<br />
until 1996 to complete.<br />
Farmers need advice urgently on how to limdit-soil<br />
degradation. We have provided nearly $ 1 million in 1989-90<br />
for research into developing whole farming systems that are<br />
economic and yet do not degrade the soil. This research-is<br />
bing carried out by universities, CSIRO and State agencies.<br />
It is important that difficulties in the transfer of such<br />
Information and new technology do not constrain an effective<br />
soil conservation effort. A public awareness, education and<br />
training program is being supported by $ 1 million in<br />
funding. </p>
<p>The additional funding provided in the Environment Statement<br />
means that total program expenditure over the next two years<br />
will be $ 49 million for landcare and related tree planting<br />
and conservation programs.<br />
Year and DecadA of Landcare ( 1990 to the Year 2000T<br />
The Year and Decade of Landcare is utilising participation<br />
and education programs to increase awareness among rural and<br />
urban communities.. of the problems caused by land degradation<br />
and the practices necessary to tackle it. J1<br />
CThe Landcare Australia Foundation has received $ 1 million to<br />
manage a national public awareness, participation and<br />
education campaign for the Year and Decade of Landcare and<br />
to administer corporate sponsorships.<br />
A Landcare Liaison Group has been established comprising<br />
representatives from Government, science and the community<br />
to help co-ordinate and publicise land, soil and water<br />
policies. The Group is producing an information leaflet<br />
outlining the funds available under all the land related<br />
projects. MUrray Darling Basin<br />
Unsustainable economic activity is a particular problem in<br />
the Murray Darling Basin. The economic'importance of the<br />
M rray Darling Basin and the gravity of the environmental<br />
problems facing the area made the junction-of these two<br />
great rivers an appropriate place for the launch of the<br />
Environment Statement last year. The problems are being<br />
addressed, but they will take time, and continuing<br />
commitment and co-operation from everyone involved<br />
Commonwealth and State Governments, industry, farmers and<br />
environmentalists. </p>
<p>A Natural Resources Management Strategy has been developed<br />
to) redress the degradation of land resources, impairment of<br />
water quality, rising water tables and the loss of native<br />
flora and fauna in the Murray Darling Basin. * The<br />
Environment Statement provided an additional $ 0 million in<br />
1989-90 to implement this Strategy. In total, $ 7.7 million<br />
was allocated in October 1989 to 96 new projects under the<br />
Strategy. The last two hundred years have seen a substantial reduction<br />
in tree cover in Australia, but this is now being reversed.<br />
More and more people from all walks of life are coming to<br />
realise the importance of trees. Trees are not just a<br />
resource for a variety of industries. They are essential to<br />
maintaining the balance of our environment. They provide,<br />
in addition to timber, protection from erosion for our<br />
soils, protection of our water supplies, habitat for our<br />
native plants and animals, shelter for livestock and<br />
enjoyment for the community. And, because growing trees<br />
absorb carbon dioxide, they can help mitigate the greenhouse<br />
effect. There are two ways of addressing tree loss -planting new<br />
trees and protecting existing ones. While tree planting<br />
plays a very important role, the preservation of native<br />
trees and vegetation is also important because of their<br />
special qualities, their resistance to drought and flood and<br />
the habitat that they provide. for native plants and animals.<br />
The Statement on the Environment announced two new programs<br />
to help protect and improve Australia's native tree and<br />
vegetation cover. </p>
<p>7.<br />
One Billion Trees<br />
Un~ der this program the Government aims to promote in the<br />
community an awareness of the importance of trees and to<br />
have one billion more trees growing around Australia by the<br />
year 2000. This can only be achieved, and will only have<br />
lasting value, if the community is actively involved.<br />
As explained in the Environment Statement, some 400 million<br />
of these trees are to be planted in the community by school<br />
children, community groups and landholders. A further 600<br />
million trees will be planted in open areas under the<br />
Natural Regeneration and Seeding Program. This will involve(<br />
demonstrations in open areas of ways to improve methods of<br />
gr owing trees.<br />
Greening Australia is administering the One Billion Trees<br />
program and has been allocated $ 4.0 million for 1989-90.<br />
The community tree planting program was launched on<br />
8 February 1990 at Redbank Plains in Queensland by Mrs Hawke<br />
as the patron of Greening Australia and by Senator<br />
Richardson. State Greening Australia bodies are finalising<br />
their programs and undertaking preparatory work to enable<br />
planting to commence on a large scale in this planting<br />
season autumn in Eastern Australia.<br />
While the. One Billion Trees Program is a central element of<br />
the Government's approach, tree cover will also be enhanced<br />
as the result of a range of other programs which have as<br />
their objective the protection of our forests, soils, -water<br />
and endangered species.<br />
Sv i the% Bu sih<br />
Significant areas of native vegetation exist outside of the<br />
national parks system and these areas ( and the native<br />
animals which they contain) need protection.<br />
' V </p>
<p>As part of our commitment to maintaining biological<br />
diversity a program to ' save the bush' was announced in the<br />
Environment Statement. By the end of 1990-91, $ 2.5 million<br />
will have been allocated to encourage efforts.-in this area.<br />
The first allocation of funding under the program was a<br />
special grant of $ 500,000 to the South Australian Government<br />
to assist it in a number of projects concentrated on the<br />
mallee area in the River.. Murray Basin.<br />
Under the general-% grants scheme a further $ 350,000 is to be<br />
provided within the next month or so via 29 grants to State<br />
and Territory governments and non-government organisations g<br />
to support native vegetation conservation schemes.<br />
Forestn and Forest Indusitriesg<br />
There are very heavy competing claims on Australia's native<br />
forests, particularly our oldgrowth forests. My Government.<br />
is committed to protecting substantial areas of our native<br />
forests, but we are also determined to develop a thriving,<br />
secure forest industry based on adding maximum value to the<br />
product. At this stage the Government does not have all of the<br />
information required to make soundly based* decisions on the<br />
resolution of these competing claims.<br />
For this reason, the Government has initiated a number of<br />
peocesses designed to generate that information. These<br />
include: Preparation of a National Forests Inventory, a National<br />
Wilderness Inventory and biological resource data<br />
bases; </p>
<p>9.<br />
The sending of a forests reference to the Resource<br />
Assessment Commission, which is due to report by<br />
November 1991; and<br />
Various studies for the South East Forests of New Wales<br />
and East Gippsland in Victoria.<br />
The. information from these processes will help -guide the<br />
Government in implementin~ g a national forest strategy.<br />
A key element in . that strategy will be the augmenta tion of<br />
the available resource through the rapid increase in the<br />
establishment of eucalypt plantations to supply expanding<br />
amounts of pulpwood. We will examine all measures to<br />
facilitate the establishment of this resource. We will<br />
require woodchip exporters to commit themselves to the<br />
establishment of plantations. And, in keeping with the<br />
Government's policy of wanting to add value to all our<br />
produce, we will ask all of the major woodchip export<br />
companies in Australia to present to us their plans for<br />
adding value to this product before the end of the decade.<br />
The Government's environmental guidelines for new bleached<br />
eucalypt kraft pulp mills, foreshadowed in the Environment<br />
Statement, were released in December 1989. These guidelines<br />
are the most stringent in the world. A package of measures<br />
to support the guidelines was announced i't* the same time,<br />
and is centred on a $ 15 million research program which will<br />
be jointly funded by the Commonwealth and the State<br />
Governments and the industry. The program will-be aimed at<br />
maintaining the capacity to research and . monitor the<br />
environmental impact of kraft mills, and on developing<br />
organochlorine-free bleaching methods for eucalypt pulp.-* </p>
<p>IZDATABAESIiZ<br />
There is a growing awareness of the need f or a sound and<br />
scientifically based approach to the use of natural<br />
resources in Australia. The size of Australia, and the<br />
uniqueness of its native f lora and f auna, make . the gathering<br />
of the scientif ic informat ion required a challenging task.<br />
While a great deal of informat~ on has already been<br />
collected, there Are still enormous gaps to be filled over<br />
time. Much of the necessary information is -not readily<br />
available. What is required is an ongoing commitment to<br />
filling the gaps that exist, learning more about the<br />
interactions between different elements within natural<br />
systems, and the organisation of information to make it more<br />
accessible. The Environment Statement contained several initiatives<br />
which will add to the information bases necessary for more<br />
informed decision making in regard to natural resource<br />
management. These systems are based on computerised<br />
geographic information system technologies and enable many<br />
different data types to be assessed and integrated.,<br />
The Environmetntal Reg ureP Tnfor-mation Network ( ERIN) I<br />
The Envir onment Statement provided $ 1.8 milli on for the<br />
establishment of the Environmental Resources Information<br />
Network ( ERIN) in 1989-90 and a further $ 2. l. million in<br />
i1gg0-91.<br />
ERIN will collect and make available information on the<br />
distribution of vegetation types, endangered species,-* and<br />
heritage sites.* The systems specifications enabling the<br />
integration of such data are currently being developed and<br />
implementation will commence in the first half of this year. </p>
<p>The National Forentn Inventory<br />
The Environment Statement provided $ 2.9 million to develop<br />
an inventory of Australia's forest resources over the next<br />
three years. The Inventory will cover a broad<br />
classification of vegetation types, fauna and aspects of<br />
land tenure. Once this information has been drawn together,<br />
it will be able to be integrated with other natural resource<br />
information via the Nationial Resource Information Centre<br />
( NRIC).<br />
Guidelines for co-operation between the States and<br />
Territories and the Commonwealth in developing the inventory<br />
( i have been agreed at the officials level. A system of forest<br />
vegetation classification has been reviewed and a discussion<br />
paper prepared.<br />
The National Wilderneng Inventory<br />
The National Wilderness Inventory aims to provide an<br />
inventory of Australia's wilderness resources. Once this<br />
information has been collected, it will provide a useful<br />
management tool for predicting the effect development<br />
proposals may have on wilderness qualities.<br />
The inventory was initiated by my Government in 1986 and has<br />
( already been completed in Tasmania and Victoria. Funding<br />
provided in the Environment Statement was used to complete<br />
the Cape York and South Australian components. Over<br />
$ 200,000 has been allocated , f or inventories for-Northern New<br />
South Wales, Northern Western Australia and Southern New<br />
South Wales/ Australian Capital Territory to be undertaken<br />
between 1989-90 and 1991-92. Work is to commence on the<br />
Northern New South Wales inventory in this year. </p>
<p>12.<br />
The National ResoczurCe Information Centre ( NflIC)<br />
NRIC has been set up by the Government to improve the<br />
information base on Australia's natural resources. It is<br />
designed to enable better access to information about<br />
natural resources, as well as quicker and more cost<br />
effective information retrieval; and to provide better<br />
service to requests for planning projects.<br />
Additional funding provided inithe Environment Statement has<br />
enabled the development of a new and expanded version of the<br />
national directory of data sources, which is to be released<br />
in June 1990. This computer-based directory will facilitate<br />
K data exchange between national and State directories.<br />
The directory will also draw on information from natural<br />
resource sources such as ERIN, the National Forest Inventory<br />
and the National Wilderness Inventory, as well as<br />
socio-economic information such as population statistics and<br />
development plans. Computer techniques can then be applied<br />
enabling users to produce a display of integrated resource<br />
information. Users will be able to call up maps on a screen<br />
which will help them determine the resource implications of<br />
alternative courses of action.<br />
Z TE RENHUS FECIT<br />
Since early 1989 Australia has placed a high priority on<br />
i~ sues relating to climate change the greenhouse effectboth<br />
internationally and domestically. </p>
<p>National Rasponsps<br />
Lhst year the Government decided to augment existing climate<br />
change research by providing an additional $ 7.8 million over<br />
the years 1989-90 and 1990-91. Of this amount, $ 5.4 million<br />
i~ s going towards a core program of research which includes<br />
work on modelling by the Bureau of Meteorology*, CSIRO and<br />
the Department of Defence. Out of these funds,<br />
$ 0.15 million is also being provided in 1989-90 to the<br />
Australian Academy of Science' sto enable the development of a<br />
research program acnd the planning of Australia's<br />
contribution to the International Geosphere-Biosphere6'<br />
Program. The National Greenhouse Advisory Committee held its third<br />
meeting on 20 February 1990. At the meeting, the Committee<br />
reviewed the progress of the core research program and<br />
finalised the* Dedicated Greenhouse Research Grants Scheme<br />
foreshadowed in the Statement, including determination of<br />
the objectives and priority areas for research under the<br />
scheme. The Committee is also developing an information<br />
program to promote public dissemination of greenhouse<br />
information. The Environment Statement gave a commitment to work towards<br />
the domestic reduction of major greenhouse gases, and forthose<br />
that are energy related, to work towards increased<br />
energy-efficiency to yield a lower ' level of gas emissions<br />
for a given level of production. A commitment was also<br />
given to consult with relevant conservation and industry<br />
9toups with the objective of achieving a global reduction in<br />
total greenhouse gas emissions, involving processes such as<br />
energy efficient manufacturing -and vigorous moves -to energy<br />
conservation in Australia and abroad.<br />
13. </p>
<p>14.<br />
I have established a Special Working Group on reducing<br />
Greenhouse Gas Emissions within Australia. At the end of<br />
1989 its preliminary report was released for public comment,.<br />
and circulated to industry, union and conservation groups,<br />
and the State and Territory Governments.<br />
The Working Group's report pointed to the high probability<br />
aissociated with projected global changes and the large<br />
uncertainties with respeczt to changes at the regional level.<br />
It concluded that policy responses should be justified on<br />
the grounds of improved efficiency and cost effectiveness.<br />
Consistent with views expressed by the Prime Minister's<br />
Science Council, the working group considered that the<br />
C Commonwealth should adopt a phased approach in developing<br />
Its national strategy.<br />
The first phase, of short term options, should include<br />
continued and total phasing out of chlorofluorocarbons by<br />
the year 2000; encouragement of increased energy efficiency<br />
and conservation and improved energy use management; support<br />
for reforestation and efforts to minimise deforestation; and<br />
support for increased natural gas and renewable energy-use<br />
in the residential sector.<br />
More detailed consideration is being given to these matters<br />
In various* Commonwealth/ State ministerial councils.<br />
Further work will be done by the Special Working Group on<br />
both short term and medium to longer term options.<br />
Th Commonwealth Government has now set in train the first<br />
phase of a long term education campaign with grants to<br />
conservation groups, Greenhouse Action and the -National..---<br />
Greenhouse Advisory Committee, and funding for DASETT and<br />
the Australian and New Zealand Environment Council. </p>
<p>The National Health and Medical Research Council has<br />
appointed consultants to identify adverse health effects of<br />
potential climate change, develop strategies to deal with<br />
them, evaluate research and training needs, and propose data<br />
collection methodology.<br />
Tn~ tprnational Responses<br />
Australia has intensified its international activities in<br />
support of research and policy development, taking a leading<br />
role at meetings of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate<br />
Change ( IPCC) and in preparation of papers for the IPCC<br />
report that is to be finalised in mid-1990. This report<br />
will cover all major aspects of greenhouse matters: science<br />
and monitoring, possible impacts, and the range of<br />
adaptation measures, including policy responses.<br />
A ustralia has also played a constructive role in other<br />
international fora concerned with the greenhouse effect,<br />
including the United Nations, the OECD, and the South<br />
Pacific Forum. To facilitate IPCC consideration of the<br />
coastal zone aspects of climate change, Australia hosted an<br />
IPOC working group meeting in Perth in February 1990.<br />
Because the problems associated with the greenhouse effect<br />
will require genuinely global solutions, and need the<br />
co-operation of developing as well as developed countries,<br />
Australia has funded developing country participation at key<br />
international meetings, especially those under IPCC<br />
a" pices. </p>
<p>16.<br />
Australia has also been working with other countries on<br />
developing a framework international convention on climate<br />
change, which it is hoped will be ready for signature at the<br />
IL992 UN Conference on Environment and Development. This<br />
convention will provide an umbrella for more specific<br />
agreements addressing particular aspects of concern, such as<br />
international collaboration in scientific monitoring and<br />
research, technology transfer, and possible institutional<br />
funding arrangements.<br />
At the 1989. South -Pacific Forum, Australia offered to<br />
establish a network of sea level monitoring stations in the<br />
South Pacific at a cost of $ 6.25 million. The Australian a<br />
C International Development Assistance Bureau ( AIDAB) has now<br />
oversighted the completion of a feasibility study for the<br />
proposal. The design phase for the project is expected to<br />
be completed by the end of March and the equipment purchased<br />
by the end of the financial year. In addition, a technical<br />
exkpert is expected to be appointed by June to operate as a<br />
climate change adviser to governments and government<br />
authorities in the region.<br />
In December 1989, the Prime Minister wrote to the developing<br />
Commonwealth countries inviting them to take part in an<br />
Australian-funded technical assistance program. Under this<br />
( program, scientists from participating countries will be<br />
trained in the use of techniques and models which will<br />
enable them to predict from climate data the distribution<br />
and productivity of crops, pastures, forests and animals. </p>
<p>* 17. VV<br />
There is now widespread community awareness of the hole in<br />
the ozone layer, and the threat that it poses-to Australians<br />
in particular, who already have a high incidence of skin<br />
cancers. Australia has taken a leading position in<br />
combatting this global problem, and we are making rapid<br />
progress domestically.<br />
As foreshadowed in the Environment Statement, a National<br />
Strategy for Ozone Protection for Australia was announced in<br />
August 1989 by the Australian and New Zealand Environment<br />
Council. Guidelines and targets have been set which will<br />
result in a 95 per cent reduction in the manufacture and<br />
import of CFCs and halons by 1995 and a total phase out by<br />
1998. These guidelines and targets complement the Federal Ozone<br />
Protection Act which provides for a ban on the manufacture<br />
and importation of &amp; FC based aerosols and polystyrene foam<br />
used in insulation. These bans came into effect on<br />
31 December 1989. Bans on the sale of these items are to<br />
come into effect during 1990 under State legislation.,<br />
These actions fulfil the undertakings in. the Environment<br />
statement. They also give Australia a rate of reduction in<br />
CFC use twice as fast as the rate required by the Montreal<br />
Protocol. As indicated in the Statement,* we have also led<br />
the way in limiting exports of CFCs, and have offered<br />
assistance with alternative technologies to other countries. </p>
<p>18.<br />
L SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT I<br />
As indicated in the Environment Statement, the general<br />
principle of sustainable development has had broad<br />
acceptance in Australia since the adoption of the National<br />
Conservation Strategy for Australia in 1983. It has<br />
underpinned Commonwealth policies since then and it was the<br />
underlying theme of the Enhvironment Statement.<br />
In order to give greater impetus to the application of the<br />
sustainable development concept within Australia, in II<br />
December 1989 I invited the State and Territory Governments,<br />
and industry, union and conservation representatives to<br />
co-operate with the Commonwealth in developing a national<br />
strategy on sustainable deve lopment. This strategy will be<br />
based on a sectoral approach and have as its aim the<br />
development of a framework for moving major industry sectors<br />
towards long term sustainability.<br />
As a first step, the Commonwealth is preparing a discussion<br />
paper on the concept of sustainable development, for<br />
circulation to interested groups and the States and<br />
Territories. When the paper has been finalised following<br />
that process, it will be issued as a starting point for the<br />
sectoral working groups that will be established to address<br />
major problems and issues in each of the main industry<br />
sectors agriculture, forestry, fisheries, mining, energy,<br />
manufacturing and tourism. The working groups will be<br />
expected to report significant progress by the end of 1990. </p>
<p>19.<br />
Much of the waste produced by modern industrial societies<br />
can be usefully recycled. Reusing material reduces the<br />
demand for our natural resources as well as reducing the<br />
overall waste disposal problem.<br />
In an effort to promote ibcycling initiatives in the public<br />
sector,* the Commonwealth has investigated the potential for<br />
the use of recycled paper in government offices and is<br />
presently reviewing paper contracts.<br />
The Commonwealth has exempted a range of recycled paper<br />
products from wholesale sales tax to encourage their use.<br />
This exemption covers designated recycled paper products<br />
sold after 4 October 1989.<br />
As part of the environmental education strategy, $ 150,000<br />
has been allocated for the establishment of a National<br />
Recycling Centre. The Centre will develop and sponsor a<br />
comprehensive education program for children on recycling.<br />
The grant will also assist in equipping a mobile van to<br />
enable the Recycling Centre's education program to be<br />
extended to rural schools.<br />

T~ e Government recognises the importance of environmental<br />
research and is committed to promoting a high standard of<br />
research In the higher education. system. -In 1990 the<br />
Australian Research Council will provide $ 5.2 million for<br />
109 research grants, a special research centre at the<br />
University of Western Australia and three key teaching<br />
centres. RECYCLING </p>
<p>The Minister for Employment, Education and Training launched<br />
an environmental education Strategy in November 1989. The<br />
strategy provides $ 400,000 -to increase the awareness and<br />
understanding of our global environment in Australia's<br />
schools. Of this money $ 150,000 is for the National<br />
Recycling Centre, $ 100,000 for the development of<br />
environmental education programs in Victorian schools,<br />
000 was provided to the Gould League for an information<br />
booklet, -$ 40,000 for National Environment Awards and $ 40,000<br />
to contribute to a conference for teachers involved in<br />
environmental education.<br />
C. Cape York Peninsula is one of the least developed and most<br />
sparsely populated areas in Australia. Rich in biological<br />
species and with a considerable variety of ecosystems, as<br />
well as an important Aboriginal cultural heritage, the<br />
Peninsula's relative isolation has been a major constraint<br />
on development and the construction of infrastructure. It<br />
is, however, of increasing interest as a tourist destination<br />
and has some potential to develop its fisheries, pastoral<br />
and agricultural activities and forestry and mining.<br />
Because of concern that any. further development must take<br />
due account of both environmental and Aboriginal values, the<br />
Premier of Queensland, Mr Goss, and I ' agreed in December<br />
1989 that our Governments would conduct a joint land use<br />
s~ tudy of Cape York Peninsula. This study is expected to be<br />
a precursor to a lond term strategy, including research and<br />
planning, that will integrate the goals of conservation and<br />
development. </p>

THE RESOURCE ASSESSMENT COMMISSION ( RAC)<br />
The Resource Assessment Commission ( RAC) was established on<br />
1 July 1989, with the task of conducting independent<br />
inquiries into major complex resource issues. The inquiry<br />
into options for the use of Australia's forest-and timber<br />
resources has begun. The first public hearing was held in<br />
December 1989. The Commission. is to report by 30 November<br />
1991. The Government announced on 5 October 1989 that a reference<br />
would be sent to the RAC to inquire into the environmental<br />
values of the greatly reduced Kakadu Conservation Zone,<br />
together with the impact on these values and on the values<br />
of Kakadu National Park of possible mining operations there.<br />
Consistent with provisions of the Resource Assessment<br />
Commission Act, the State and Territory Governments and<br />
industry, union and conservation groups are being consulted<br />
on the terms of reference for the Inquiry. The Inquiry is<br />
to run for one year.<br />
A third reference, on coastal zone management, has been<br />
foreshadowed, and terms of reference are expected to be<br />
finalised in mid 1990. </p>

I. ANTARCTICA . I<br />
Because of the uniqueness and fragility of the Antarctic<br />
environment, its protection as the world's last unspoilt<br />
continent has been a high priority for the Government.<br />
Australia has been working closely with France in seeking<br />
international support for the negotiation within the<br />
Antarctic Treaty System of a comprehensive environmental<br />
protection convention for Antarctica which would ban mining.<br />
In support of this initiative Australia has recently hosted<br />
a visit by Captain Jacques Cousteau, the distinguished<br />
( 7 marine explorer, environmentalist and inventor.<br />
A special Antarctic Treaty consultative meeting on the<br />
antarctic environment will be held later in 1990 to consider<br />
the Australian-French proposal for such a convention which<br />
would establish Antarctica as a Nature Reserve Land of<br />
Science. The proposal for a convention has received<br />
considerable support amongst the parties to the Antarctic<br />
Treaty. We expect support for this proposal to increase as<br />
more and more countries come to understand the importance of<br />
protecting the world's only pristine continent and realise<br />
that this will not be achieved through the draft Convention<br />
on the Regulation of Antarctic Mineral Resource Activities.<br />
New Zealand has recently changed its position and decided<br />
against ratifying the draft Antarctic minerals convention.<br />
It is also becoming increasingly unlikely -that the United<br />
S. tates will ratify the convention. </p>

OTHER INTERNIATIONAL ISSUES I<br />
The pressing need for an international collaborative<br />
approach for tackling many of today's environmental problems<br />
is now Virtually unchallenged. Issues such as biological<br />
diversity and rainforest management, as well as the ozone<br />
layer and climate change are under discussion in many<br />
international organisations. -Australia is continuing to<br />
play a leading role in these activities.<br />
Amhasqador for the Environment<br />
The former Governor General, Sir Ninian Stephen, was<br />
appointed Australia's Ambassador for the Environment in.<br />
July 1989. He is making an important contribution to<br />
Australia's efforts to influence international action to<br />
address global environmental problems by presenting<br />
Australia's viewpoint on these matters in international<br />
fora. Last December Sir Ninian represented Australia at the World<br />
Conference on Preparing for Climate Change, in Cairo.<br />
Sir Ninian has also had meetings with ministers for foreign<br />
( affairs and environment in Europe and the'United States toexplain<br />
the Australian-Franco initiative on the Antarctic.<br />
This year he will be active in promoting to the 37 Antarctic<br />
Treaty nations the advantages of supporting this initiative<br />
andt having Antarctica declared an international nature<br />
reserve, </p>
<p>24.<br />
Rainforpntm Rainforests are a rich source of biological diversity. And<br />
they are important for their effects on climate and soil,<br />
water and air quality. Rainforests -in many countries are<br />
also a source of commercial timber. The effective<br />
management of rainforests has become a matter of<br />
international concern.<br />
Australia has taken action to brotect large areas of its own<br />
rainforests. In addition, it is providing assistance to<br />
help other countries improve the management of their<br />
rainforests. Australia is providing $ 100,000 in 1989-90 under the<br />
Tropical Forest Initiative for the provision of technical<br />
assistance for the management and protection of forests-in<br />
tropical countries, with $ 60,000 of this going to the<br />
international Tropical Timber Study in Sarawak. This study<br />
commenced in November 1989 with a visit to Sarawak by a<br />
study panel of the International Tropical Timber<br />
Organisation ( ITTO). The panel will report to the ITTO in<br />
May 1990.<br />
Senator Cook has invited Papua New Guinea to participate in<br />
the initiative and has had direct discussions on the issue<br />
with Indonesian, Malaysian and Thai ministers.<br />
The Amazon rainforests have received particular attention<br />
because of their size and relatively undisturbed nature.<br />
A~ stralia donated $ 250,000 to the Brazilian Rainforest<br />
Foundation on 11 September 1989 to assist with Amazon<br />
rainforest preservation -by creating a -large -rainforestreserve.<br />
President Sarney of Brazil has agreed to form a<br />
commission to authorise the demarcation of land belonging to<br />
the Caiapo Indians, as requested by the Rainforest<br />
Foundation. </p>
<p>A number of organisations concerned with the rate of<br />
deforestation in tropical rainforest areas have pressed for<br />
restrictions on the importation of tropical rainforest<br />
timber. Last year the Government decided to commission a<br />
study on Australia's role in importing tropical timbers and<br />
the implications and efficacy of restricting imports. A<br />
draft report is now being considered by a panel of<br />
independent assessors whose comments will be conveyed to the<br />
consultants for consideration in preparing . the final report.<br />
The report examines possible olicy options and their impact<br />
on the resource base of the originating countries, as well<br />
as their implications for industry within Australia. The<br />
final report is expected to be released in April. 9<br />
Research will play an important role in any attempt to<br />
improve management policies and practices. Australia will<br />
be providing $ 1 million for the establishment and<br />
maintenance of the Institute of Tropical Rainforest Studies<br />
in Cairns. Of this amount, $ 600,000 has been allocated for<br />
research and operation costs for the first year.<br />
Minlogircal iest<br />
The Government is according high priority to the preparation<br />
of a national strategy on biological diversity; and has been<br />
active in international efforts to preserv6 the planet's.<br />
biological diversity.<br />
Australia is taking a leading role in the development -of -an<br />
Mternational convention for the protection of biological<br />
diversity, and will be offering to host a major<br />
International meeting in the process -leading up -to -theadoption<br />
of the convention. In addition we will be hosting<br />
the annual meeting of the International Union for the<br />
Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources, in Perth in<br />
November this year. </p>
<p>26.<br />
Australia has continued to work towards the completion of a<br />
bilateral agreement on migratory birds with the USSR.<br />
Informal discussions have also been held regarding a similar.<br />
agreement with ASEAN.<br />
We hope shortly to conclude consultations with the States<br />
which would enable us to accede to the Bonn Convention on<br />
the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals.<br />
The world is at risk of losing many of its species because<br />
of excess trading'in either individual species or products<br />
derived from them. Australia is a strong supporter of the<br />
Convention on the Importation and Trade in Endangered<br />
C, Species ( CITES) which endeavours to regulate the import and<br />
export of certain listed species.<br />
Of particular concern to the international community hasbeen<br />
the threat from the ivory trade to the existence of the<br />
African elephant. On 22 August 1989, I announced a ban on<br />
the importation of non-antique ivory. In October 1989,<br />
Australia supported a move to place the African elephant on<br />
Appendix 1 to the CITES Convention. This effectively<br />
prohibits the export and trading of all elephant species by<br />
signatories to* the Convention.<br />
A major threat to the future of marine resources, and the.<br />
communities which depend on them, is the expansion in<br />
driftnet activity by distant water fishing fleets.<br />
Australia prohibited driftnetting in all waters within the<br />
Australian Fishing Zone as from 25 July 1989, continues to<br />
deny access by driftnet vessels to Australian ports, except<br />
In cases of emergency, and prevents transshipment of fish<br />
caught by driftnets in the. Zone. </p>
<p>27.<br />
During my visit to New Zealand in February 1990 1 signed,<br />
for Australia, a convention to ban driftnet fishing<br />
activities in the South Pacific. The Convention will be<br />
signed by all South Pacific Forum countries and protocols to<br />
the Convention will, when possible, be negotiated with<br />
fishing nations. I also announced an enhanced program of<br />
joint Australia-New Zealand driftnet surveillance and<br />
enforcement measures.<br />
Australia has also supported i United Nations resolution<br />
committing fishing nations to cease driftnet fishing in the<br />
South Pacific by July 1991 ( to cooperate in the development<br />
of a fisheries management regime) and to implement a<br />
moratorium globally by July 1992.<br />
After previously agreeing only to limit the number of<br />
driftnet vessels, Taiwan has now agreed to comply with the<br />
United Nations resolution to halt driftnetting in the South<br />
Pacific by July 1991.<br />
The GoVernment pressed hard for a reduction in Southern<br />
Bluefin Tuna ( SET) quotas in discussions with Japan and New<br />
Zealand in October 1989. A reduction in the global quota of<br />
over 20 per cent has continued a series of reductions<br />
achieved since 1983-84. Following these quota negotiations,<br />
expenditure of $ 0.7 million for 1989-90 has been allocated<br />
for further SBT research.<br />
To help preserve biological diversity at home, funding for<br />
the first year of projects under the Endangered Species<br />
Mgram ( ESP) has been approved. Approved projects under<br />
the ESP include a National Education Program and a number of<br />
maj or projects aimed at the control of introduced and<br />
noxious species. </p>
<p>28.<br />
The control of exotic and other pests and diseases is vital<br />
i~ n maintaining the diversity of Australia's unique<br />
ecosystems. In addition to assisting with the battle<br />
against introduced species such as rabbits, cane toads and<br />
mimosa pigra, voluntary guidelines controlling, the discharge<br />
of ballast from ships entering Australia have been<br />
introduced and a review of quarantine policy is currently<br />
being undertaken. Also, $ 750,000 in additional funds will<br />
be provided for the period to June 1991 for a research<br />
program into the Crown of Thorns starfish. This program is<br />
now underway.<br />
Aid In further assisting developing countries in the South<br />
Pacific and South-East Asian regions to address<br />
environmental problems, $ 4.4 million has been allocated for<br />
1989-90 for bilateral projects through the Environment<br />
Assistance Program. An action plan has been developed to<br />
maximise the effectiveness of the Program and establish<br />
criteria for providing funds.<br />

The final section of ' Our Country, Our Future' committed the<br />
Government to ongoing reviews of the progress being made in<br />
implementing the undertakings given in that document. This<br />
is the first such formal review. Further reports will be<br />
tgaued periodically, to advise the co mmunity of progress<br />
being made in protecting our irreplaceable natural<br />
environment. </p>
