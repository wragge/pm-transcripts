    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Prime Minister and the Minister for Infrastructure today welcomed the announcement of the $613 million duplication of the Cooroy to Curra (Section B) stretch of the Bruce Highway.</p>
<p>This project will provide motorists with a four-lane divided carriageway that improves safety and reduces congestion for the 17,000 vehicles travelling on the road each day.</p>
<p>The Bruce Highway has crash rates 40 per cent higher than other roads on the National Network.</p>
<p>On the Cooroy to Curra Section B alone, 13 people have lost their lives since July 2002.</p>
<p>Traffic volumes on the highway continue to grow at four to five per cent each year.</p>
<p>Construction will occur between 2009 and 2012 and support up to 650 direct local jobs, boosting economic activity in the local region during the global economic recession.</p>
<p>The Federal Government will invest $488 million and the Queensland Government will invest $125 million in this important project.</p>
<p>This investment is part of the Federal Government's $22 billion infrastructure investment in the 2009-10 Budget, which includes transport, energy, broadband, universities, and health care.</p>
<p>The Australian Government's nation-building initiatives include $8.6 billion in road and rail infrastructure in Queensland. </p>
