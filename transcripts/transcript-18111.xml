The Australian Government today offered $10 million to support the UN Children's Fund's (UNICEF's) humanitarian relief work in response to the Horn of Africa crisis in Somalia.</p>
<p>UNICEF is calling this a children's famine. UNICEF estimates there are over 2 million malnourished children in need of urgent, life-saving actions in the Horn of Africa, including an estimated 1.25 million children across southern Somalia.</p>
<p>Australian assistance will contribute to UNICEF's work to meet the needs of women and children across Somalia. UNICEF will:</p>
<p> * 	- provide treatment to severely malnourished children in more than 500 outpatient therapeutic centres that are aiming to reach 400,000 children over the next 6 months;<br />
 * 	- deliver supplementary food to 150,000 households over the next few months;<br />
 * 	- undertake immunisations targeting 2 million children from 6 months to 15 years of age for measles vaccination;<br />
 * 	- upgrade water supply and sanitation facilities for internally displaced people and host communities, to help prevent the spread of water-borne diseases such as cholera; and<br />
 * 	- protect internally displaced children by establishing primary schools and child friendly spaces in camps and neighbouring communities.</p>
<p>Australia's total funding in response to the drought and famine in the Horn of Africa now stands at $98.2 million.   </p>
