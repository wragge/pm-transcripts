PRIME MINISTER<br />
INTERVIEW WITH MIKE CARLTON, RADIO 2GB, 13 APRIL 1989<br />
E 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
CARLTON: Can we get the election question out of the way<br />
first? will you go to the polls this year?<br />
PM: No, Mike. I've made that quite clear in a program I<br />
recorded last night, you just jumped in front of Am by a<br />
quarter of an hour<br />
CARLTON: Rightly so.<br />
PM: So, it's quite clear that all we're doing is what we<br />
said we'd do last year. I mean this is a situation where I<br />
made a promise last year, middle of last year, that I'd<br />
deliver tax cuts July 1, 1989. I delivered my promise,<br />
something I gave twelve months ago. The only person who's<br />
talked about a July election is a little bloke called Johnny<br />
Howard who's tried to introduce this note of cynicism in on<br />
the delivery of my promise. If I hadn't delivered my<br />
promise he would have said you can't believe the Prime<br />
minister. I deliver my promise and he says it's only an<br />
election ploy. Now all he's doing of course is what<br />
everyone knows is that there's a numbers game on in Canberra<br />
this morning. It's not a numbers game about what you get<br />
out of this package, it is can Andrew Peacock get above the<br />
34 votes that he's got in his pocket now to knock Howard<br />
off? That's the numbers game in Canberra today.<br />
CARLTON: Alright, so no election this year?<br />
PM: No election this year.<br />
CARLTON: Alright, so what happens now? What happens<br />
PM: now is that the people of Australia get the tax<br />
cut and the increase in their family allowance as they<br />
deserve. we've had to ask them to do it reasonably hard for<br />
some time because of the toughness of the situation. we<br />
said we'd remedy that when we could. We can now and the<br />
real question as to what happens now is what does the<br />
opposition say about what they'd do.<br />
CARLTON: Alright. Well what happens if Australians spend<br />
the extra money, we don't save it? Is that going to pour<br />
kerosene on the fire? </p>
<p>PM: I think it's a very legitimate question. The answer is<br />
basically this Mike and I don't want to get into technical<br />
jargon and statistics for your listeners, but I'll try and<br />
put it simply as it is in this past year we've had an<br />
eight percent growth in consumption. This has been<br />
associated with historically high investment, more money<br />
being invested by business as a portion of our output than<br />
ever before, a massive improvement in our terms of trade<br />
which has meant extra billions of dollars flowing into the<br />
economy and historically high investment in housing and<br />
non-dwelling construction. Now those things will not be<br />
repeated, so those elements of demand won't be there. Of<br />
course, on the public side we are again going to have a<br />
reduction in real Commonwealth outlays and a situation<br />
therefore so there is no fuelling of demand from us. In<br />
those circumstances the economy can accommodate the extra<br />
demand that may be associated with this although some people<br />
of course may use it, as we hope, for saving purposes.<br />
CARLTON: Well you've really got to punt on that haven't you<br />
because everyone rushes out and throws money around? Surely<br />
our imports will rise again and interest rates will rise<br />
again. PM: No, but that ignores, with respect Mike, what I said<br />
about the other factors. I mean, that assumes that all the<br />
other elements of demand that have been making a high demand<br />
on imports in this past year will continue. It simply is<br />
not possible that you will have the same high levels of<br />
investment, you will not get an improvement in the terms of<br />
trade of the dimension that we'd had, you know, of the order<br />
of about 11 or 12 percent in this last 12 months, which of<br />
itself, has brought extra billions of dollars of demand into<br />
the country. You are not going to have those elements there<br />
in 1989/ 90 that you had before. So there is room, it's not<br />
as though this is adding on top of existing demand in terms<br />
of the pattern of 88/ 89.<br />
CARLTON: Can I put this another way and see if you agree?<br />
PM: Yes.<br />
CARLTON: You're saying that business has now made its<br />
investments, they've got new factories, new technology, new<br />
computers, they've done that. So you're now saying that<br />
Australians can spend a little and buy the products of that<br />
business investment?<br />
PM: To a very considerable extent. Business will tell you<br />
they won't undertake those same levels of investment. We<br />
wanted them to do what they have done because that will put<br />
us in a stronger position to be competitive with imports and<br />
to improve our export performance. We're glad that that's<br />
happened, but you're right, but could I make this point Mike<br />
and I would appreciate it, because I think you understand </p>
<p>-3-<br />
( PM cont): these things I would appreciate it, if the<br />
message could be sold that the extent that your listeners<br />
spend what they get now, a lot of them will want to save it,<br />
but to the extent that they spend, spend it on Australian<br />
made goods. If people want to continue the great<br />
cooperation that we've had with them in this past six years<br />
and they have been truly magnificent, then I plead with my<br />
fellow Australians, if you are going to spend what we've<br />
given you and not save it, spend it on Australian made<br />
goods. CARLTON: Do you intend to campaign strongly on that, I mean<br />
is there going to be a big buy Australian campaign to follow<br />
this up? It makes sense.<br />
PM: We'll enlarge the emphasis on the campaign that we've<br />
had in the past. It's always been right, it was right when<br />
we had the tough situation where we lost so much in national<br />
income with the decline in the terms of trade before. It's<br />
at least as important now, in a sense more important, that<br />
where we've got to deal with this external problem, not too<br />
many imports, that Australians spend on Australian made<br />
goods. It's the great contribution. We have given to the<br />
people the money in tax cuts and family allowances that they<br />
need and that they deserve. Their great contribution as<br />
part of this can be to intensify their effort to buy<br />
Australian. CARLTON: Alright. You've done long and hard talks with the<br />
unions, the ACTU, much will depend on their attitude. I<br />
assume that you are firm in your belief the ACTU will stick<br />
to the bargain and not go for big wage rises?<br />
PM: Yes and I think Mike, it's a good question and I'm<br />
entitled to say to you as I know you will appreciate, look<br />
at their record and mate if you look at their record why is<br />
it that we've created 1.3 million new jobs? Why is it that<br />
the profit share has gone to a historically high level? It<br />
is because the trade union movement have stuck to their<br />
bargain. They could have been out there getting much more,<br />
they haven't and they've given us an undertaking that in<br />
this coming financial year, ' 89/ 90, they will adhere to that<br />
and that the wages outcome in total will only be six and a<br />
half percent which, given the level of activity is<br />
historically unprecedented. Could I just say to you Mike as<br />
a quick thing, I know most of your readers won't have the<br />
opportunity of reading this, but I do ask you sincerely to<br />
read Attachment A with Paul Keating's speech. It sets out<br />
there in about 15 pages the whole essence of that story and<br />
it really is worth reading.<br />
CARLTON: I'll take it to bed tonight. </p>
<p>-4-<br />
PM: I don't know where you should read it, that's a matter<br />
for your discretion my friend, but I know you're dinkum and<br />
that you will read it.<br />
CARLTON: Alright. All the punters this morning though are<br />
predicting an interest rate rise, at least that they'll stay<br />
high or perhaps they will go higher. Do you see that?<br />
PM: Let me make this point, that as far as our decisions<br />
are concerned, there would be much more basis for that<br />
proposition some significant rise in interest rates if<br />
we had increased our demand on savings, but what we've done<br />
is to continue what we've done in the past three years. In<br />
the past three years we've had real reductions in our<br />
outlays, real reductions in the Commonwealth's outlays and<br />
we've indicated for the next year there will be a further<br />
real reduction in our outlays. The public sector borrowing<br />
requirement will remain at zero. That is we, as a<br />
Government, will be making no demand on savings. So as a<br />
result of what we've done and with our own operations there<br />
will be no increased demand on savings and therefore no<br />
pressure from us on interest rates. So you go back to the<br />
answer I gave you before Mike, that is we've had high levels<br />
of demands but the elements that I identified will not be<br />
there or not there to the same extent as before. Therefore<br />
there is room to accommodate the sort of increases in<br />
personal demand that may be to some extent be associated<br />
with these increases.<br />
CARLTON: OK, but surely interest rates will have to stay at<br />
least where they are for quite some time?<br />
PM: Sorry, I was just going on to say, now we have said we<br />
are going to keep interest rates high as long as is<br />
necessary to protect the public. I mean as you know Mike,<br />
Bob Hawke wouldn't have interest rates higher one fraction<br />
of a point for one day longer than it was necessary. We<br />
can't have a fiscal policy any tighter, that is we're not<br />
going to cut services to the people any more than we have<br />
and we can't have wages policy any tighter. So monetary<br />
policy has got to carry the burden for a bit longer, so<br />
interest rates will stay high for some time until we can see<br />
that level of activity coming down from the high levels that<br />
we can't sustain.<br />
CARLTON: Alright, well there will be people paying off<br />
mortgages and people paying rent wanting to know how long<br />
that will be, how long will rates stay high?<br />
PM: Well, as long as is necessary. I've said in January<br />
this year that I thought interest rates would be coming down<br />
before the end of the year. I think that's right, but I'm<br />
not going to speculate as to the exact timing because<br />
speculation by me about that can, of itself, have an effect<br />
on the market. I'm not going to be in that, but your </p>
<p>( PM cont): listeners can be assured of two things. One,<br />
that interest rates are where they are because if we didn't<br />
have them where they are there'd be a further massive surge<br />
of imports, the whole show would collapse. Now we can't do<br />
that and that reinforces the point I made before, buy<br />
Australian. The second point is this, that the very<br />
significant increases that we've given them now in<br />
disposable income by way of tax cuts and increased<br />
allowances for family and the kids, that that's going to<br />
help them at this point meet the high interest rates and<br />
when the high interest rates come down they are still going<br />
to have that money in their kick.<br />
CARLTON: Alright. You sound very buoyant this morning, I'm<br />
wondering do you think the economy is buoyant as well, that<br />
we will get down our foreign debt, that we will eventually<br />
export more and drag more money back in?<br />
PM: Yes I am buoyant and on the question of export, let me<br />
make this point. Our export perfomance is good, it's the<br />
net export position which is important. That is you can<br />
have an increase in exports which we've had, a very<br />
significant increase in exports but if your imports increase<br />
more than your exports then, what we say in the jargon, the<br />
net export position has not pulled its weight, not because<br />
exports haven't increased but because we're bringing in too<br />
many imports. So I keep coming back to this central point,<br />
your listeners, great people that they are, they see<br />
Governments making decisions and they approve/ disapprove in<br />
varying degrees but they wonder ' well we're a bit remote<br />
from that'. Now can I just repeat the plea that one way in<br />
which every single one of your listeners can play a personal<br />
part in helping Australia and I know they all want to, they<br />
are glad to get the cuts and the increase in family<br />
allowances, what can they do to help? Buy Australian.<br />
CARLTON: Prime Minister, thanks very much for talking to<br />
us. PM: My pleasure Mike.<br />
ends </p>
