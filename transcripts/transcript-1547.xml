ASIAN TOUR 1967 TA IWIAN<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER, IOR. HAROLD HOLT, AT STATE DINNER<br />
GIVEN BY VICE PRESIDENT AND MRS. YEN IN TAIPEI ARIL, 197<br />
Mr. Vice President, Your Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen:<br />
First I must apologise because my speech will be rather<br />
longer, or at least I am afraid it will seem longer, than that<br />
of His Excellency, -the Vice President, not only because the text<br />
is longer, but it is longer because I really have much more to<br />
thank him about than he has to thank mie about, and I have seen<br />
so much and done so much in this short time here, about which<br />
I wish to make some references.<br />
And so, Mr. Vice Pmsident, I must first of all express<br />
the grateful thanks of myself of Mirs. Holt and all members of my<br />
party, for the very warm and cordial welcome we have rcceived<br />
wherever we have moved on our visit here. VWe have felt that we<br />
have been particularly privileged and honoured to have been received<br />
and entertained with such gracious hospitality by His Excellency<br />
your distinguished President Chiang Kni-Shek and Madam Chiang.<br />
I have valued the opportunity which came to me last night for my<br />
first discussion with your President and I look forward 8 eatly to<br />
talking with him again as wie have arranged before I leave tomorrow<br />
morning. I must also thank you, Mr. Vice President and Mrs. Yen,<br />
for many things. Virstly, for the warmth of your welcome the<br />
intimate and frank discussions we were abl.--to hold together both<br />
in your Cabinet Room and as wie have moved about together. The way<br />
in which you have sacrificed your own time and convenience to<br />
accompany mie as I have moved about your industries this morning<br />
and finally, but by no means least, for according us this magnificent<br />
dinner this evening in such a memorable and glorious setting, and in<br />
the company of such a large anE distinguished gathering. It gives<br />
mie particular pleasure, as I am sure it does to all of my company<br />
to be feted in this splendid hall, dedicated to the memory of<br />
Dr. Sun Yat Sen, the father of modern China. I feel I can take a<br />
certain pride in being the first Prime Minie'ter from Australia to<br />
visit the Republic of China and I interpret quite confidontly the<br />
reception that you have given me as a true reflection of the<br />
tradition of friendship between our two countries.<br />
Our Australian Embassy shared with you the hardships and<br />
rigours of war-time days in Chungking and I am pleased that my own<br />
government was recently responsible for re-establishing our mission<br />
here in your present capital. Your own embassy in Canberra is one<br />
of the oldest diplomatic missions in our capital city.<br />
In the yea-rs since we first became associated our<br />
countries have both been through crises and je still live in<br />
turbulent times, but we both pursue courses of action designed<br />
to promote the things we believe in peace, social justice,<br />
individual liberty, the advancement of human wellbeing and the<br />
right of all peoples to determine their own future and to defend<br />
their sovereign independence. Vie in Australia, espousing as we<br />
do all these causes in the United Nations and elsewhere, have given<br />
you our constant support to the Republic of China in the Security<br />
Council, the General Assembly, and all organs of the United Nations.<br />

Mrs. Holt and I and mly party will leave Taipei tomorrow<br />
morning with very happy recollections of our brief stay with you,<br />
but, although this visit has been short, thanks to the care,<br />
Mr. Vice President, that you have taken in arranging our programmie,<br />
we have learned much from what vie have been told by you and your<br />
Ministers and officials, and froL all that vie have been shown,<br />
and what we have been able to see as wie have moved around, vie have<br />
been particularly impressed by wvhat have seen of the rapid<br />
economic grovith, the prosperity, the wellbeing of thij province and<br />
the evident happiness of your people.<br />
Your achievements in agriculture were apparent as wie flew<br />
into your city, since then we have seen your large petroleum<br />
and alumainium. plants, your iriagincative export development complex<br />
at Kaohsiung with its new industries, somie of them highly<br />
sophisticated, and we have noted the emphasis you give to encouragement<br />
of private initiative and to investment from abroad. The enthusiasm<br />
and efficiency which you are making and displaying are an obvious mark<br />
of this project and thcese things provide a striking illustration of<br />
what can be achieved in a free country where effective planning<br />
goes hand in hand with the provision of suitable incentives to<br />
private nitiative. As for the growing trade between us, we hope and confidently<br />
expect that thio will steadily expand. We've watched with interest<br />
and admiration what the Republic of China is doing to assist less<br />
developed countries, particularly in Africa, and particularly in<br />
the field of technical skill. Your api. roach to the provision of<br />
training in agriculture is obviously sound as is shown by your<br />
achievement in raising productivity by as much as ten times per<br />
hectare in some cases in the countries you've assisted. We fully<br />
endorse your conviction tha-, t the only sure-way of instilling efficient<br />
and modern techniques is by sending out experts who are practical men<br />
and women and who are willin, to prove the effectiveness of these<br />
techniques by their own physical efforts, whether knee deep in mud<br />
in a rice field, or covered in grease underneath a bus. We have<br />
ourselves, found that our best successes in the field of technical<br />
aid have been gained by expe rts who were able to teach by their own<br />
example instead of merely by oral or written explanation.<br />
Finally, I have had the pleasure this afternoon, as has<br />
Mrs. Holt and others of our party, of examining some of China's most<br />
ancient and precious treasures, and this has been a fascinating<br />
experience, even though necessarily a short one. There are many of<br />
my fellow countrymen who would give a great deal to be able to share<br />
this experience Mr. Vice President. I know there would be practical<br />
problems, but is there the possibility of mounting at some time an<br />
exhibition of some of these magnificent pieces in some of our<br />
Australian cities? It would be assured of very great interest and<br />
applause from my countrym.-en.<br />
This tour I have been making, Mr. Vice President, has been<br />
in the nature of an educational process for mie. I believe that<br />
education broadens knmowledge that knowledge in turn encouragee<br />
understanding, and that understanding builds friendship, and I am<br />
sure that this particular visit not only has added by wany of<br />
eaucation to my knowledge and hias increased Liy understanding of your<br />
people and your problems, I am sure -i* c has also given new warmth,<br />
or added warmth, and greater depth to the friendship between our two<br />
countries and between those of us who have the responsibility of<br />
leading -these two countries.<br />
And because I value so grelatly this process and the<br />
contribution that you and your colleagues hc: ive made to it, and in<br />
that spirit that I do ask you to rise and join with me first in<br />
honouring the toast of your great President Chiang Xai-Shek and<br />
Madame Chiang, anJ then the toast to the Vice President and<br />
Mrs. Yen, and all your colleagues of the government, and finally,<br />
the people of Taiwan Liay they go on in security, prosperity and<br />
hapliness and may the friendship of the Australian people contribute<br />
to those felicious purposes. I give you the toast. </p>
