HOSPITAL SUBSIDY PAYMENTS<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister, tte Rt HHon, B. G. Menzies<br />
The following is the text of a telegram sent<br />
today to the Premier of New South Wales, Mr. Heffron, in reply to<br />
his telegram to me arising from a statement by the Conmmonwealth<br />
Minister for Health, Senator Wade, on Sunday night, My telegram<br />
reads " I refer to your telegram of 25th February<br />
regarding the statement made by Seantor Wade on the reduction<br />
from 1st February this year in the rate of subsidy payments<br />
to public hospitals in New South Wales. I have had the<br />
advantage of discussions with Senator Wade, before his<br />
statement and since, about the material at his disposal<br />
concernin:, some of the largest public hospitals in your<br />
State0 Tam satisfied that the Government of New South<br />
Wales has reduced the rate of hospital subsidy payments<br />
not only by the amount formerly paid by the Commonwealth<br />
to the State Treasury, but also by the additional 24/-<br />
per day now being paid by the Commonwealth direct to<br />
public hospitals in respect of uninsured pensioners in<br />
public wards, Indeed it would appear that this action was<br />
foreshadowed by your Minister for Health, Mr. Sheahan, in<br />
a statement for public information which he addressed on<br />
8th January this year to hospital boards. May I draw<br />
your attention to the following quotation from this<br />
statement Tne increased benefit payment in<br />
respect of P. M, S. pensioners and the payment<br />
direct to hospitals by the Commonwealth of<br />
benefits previously paid through the State as<br />
part of maintenance subsidy will necessitate<br />
a material don-ward adjustment of the subsidy<br />
paid by the Hospitals Commission to each<br />
hospital.'<br />
I therefore fail to see how there has been any misrepresentation<br />
of the facts by the Commonwealth.<br />
It is of course for your Government to decide<br />
the size of the subsidies it pays to public hospitals in<br />
New South Wales, but I and my Ministerial colleagues wish<br />
it to be abundantly clear that the decision to reduce the<br />
rate of hospital subsidy payments in your State by the<br />
additional 24/-per day now being paid by the Commonwealth<br />
direct to public hospitals in respect of uninsured<br />
pensioners as well as by the amount formerly paid by the<br />
Commonwealth to the State Treasury, is entirely the<br />
responsibility of your Government and that the Commonwealth<br />
is in no way to blame for any financial difficulties<br />
being experienced by New South Wales hospitals."<br />
CANBERRA, 28th February, 1963. </p>
