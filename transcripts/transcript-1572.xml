OPENING OF E. R. SQUIBB SONS' PLAT ' 1<br />
NOBLE PARK, VICTORIA l l<br />
Speech by the Frime Minister, Mr. Harold Holt 8TH MAY, 1967<br />
Mr. Gardiner.... and may I take this opportunity of welcoming<br />
home to Australia the Ambassador for the United States, Mr. Edward Clark.<br />
He has two homes, one in Texas and one here in Australia and we permit him<br />
temporarily to serve as Ambassador from the United States to this country.<br />
I feel we ought to be paying him the money. If every overseas ambassador<br />
gave us as good service both inside Australia and when he goes abroad on his<br />
various occasions, then our foreign influence would be very much greater than<br />
it is. But we welcome him back. He is sporting his daily-renewed Texas rose.<br />
I think he must have had an injection of some Squibb hormone or something to<br />
keep it going or else they have shown him how to preserve these things<br />
indefinitely. However, Ed, good friend, welcome back to Australia.<br />
And welcome, also, Mr. Chairman of the Board, Mr. John McCloy.<br />
There are various reasons, most of which will emerge as I<br />
speak to you, why I find it a personal pleasure to be here this afternoon, but<br />
I would be putting right at the top of the list the renewal of my acquaintance<br />
and my friendship with the very distinguished man not just a distinguished<br />
American but a distinguished world citizen in the person of the Chairman of<br />
your Board. If any of you have found the opportunity and those of you who<br />
haven't I hope will take it of studying the curriculum vitae of this remarkable<br />
man, you will wonder how much could have been crammed with such distinction<br />
Into the period of one lifetime. He tells us he Is getting on but even In the<br />
time he spent getting on, it amazes me that so many notable posts could have<br />
been discharged with such ability and with such general acclaim as have been<br />
occupied by the Chairman of the Board.<br />
And when he talks about getting on, again he is a very good<br />
advertisement for Squibb products if that Is the way he puts It regarding<br />
himself. He looks a very fit and vigorous specimen after having journeyed<br />
across the Pacific and come to join us here today. Mr. McCloy, on this your<br />
first visit to Australia, I am delighted as its Prime Minister to welcome you<br />
here. I hope it will be the first of several occasions, and we applaud all that<br />
you have been doing for the satisfaction not just of one President of the United<br />
States from one side of politics but for all the Presidents who have occupied<br />
that post during your maturity and from all sides of politics. What you have<br />
had to say, while I am warmed by your generous references to myself doesn't<br />
prompt the things which I feel in me to say regarding your own contribution to a<br />
better world. You mentioned that you had been talking to my former leader,<br />
Sir Robert Menzies, and that he couldn't find very much that was quotable to<br />
say about me. I served with him, of course, in the Parliament for, I think,<br />
it was thirty years, or just on thi rtyone years, and for thirty of those years<br />
he kept referring to me at " young Harold". Eventually he got accustomed to<br />
the idea that it was bout time that I took over and that I wasn't quite as young<br />
as he might be presenting me in that particular form. / 2 </p>
<p>-2<br />
I accept what you say about the reference I made to the United<br />
States. I can't claim to have coined the phrase, but in the circumstances of<br />
the Viet Nam involvement, I was very glad to adopt this for Australia. I am<br />
entirely unrepentant about it and so far as the Viet Nam Issue is concerned,<br />
we are there together to see this thing through. Now, when you suggest that<br />
through Bob Menzies, I might say " all the way with Squibb", well I haven't made<br />
a bad beginning but I am very conscious of the fact that not very far from here<br />
are some very close friends of mine, the Nicholas family, and one has to be<br />
diplomatic about these things.<br />
Another very good reason for my being with you is the subject of<br />
health. I suppose there is no topic a tout which human beings converse more<br />
frequently or in which they are more interested individually, and this is to be<br />
noted in the ordinary salutations with which we greet each other or the way<br />
in which we indulge together on convivial occasions. You raise a glass and<br />
you say " Good Health.!" Or perhaps that Is not quite so fashionable as it was<br />
because thanks to companies like your own, most of us enjoy far better health<br />
than earlier generations and people tend to say rather than " Good Health!<br />
these days, " Good Luck! or If you happen to live in a country regarded as,<br />
heidlthy and lucky, you are just as likely to get " Bottoms Up!" Then,<br />
occasionally, we fluctuate in these matters and someone says to you, " Well,<br />
how are you" or " How do you do". There have been mornings when I have<br />
replied, " Well, don't ask me or I will tell you".<br />
But what a remarkable change has come over the business, the<br />
pleasure of living as a result of the work of men such as the founder of this<br />
great organisation whose material evidence of success is to be found as an<br />
example In this fine building here today.<br />
Edward Squibbs' own story Is a romance In itself. He established<br />
his first production laboratory as so many people living in a free enterprise<br />
society find it necessary to do, on borrowed money, shortly after he had<br />
left the Navy. He did this In 1858, and shortly afterwards, the laboratory<br />
was completely destroyed by fire and he was, I understand, permanently<br />
disfigured as a consequence of it. But such was his courage, such was his<br />
enterprise, such was his determination that he was quickly back in operation<br />
and by the end of 1859, he was there In business again.<br />
And it is a very long history for a pharmaceutical organisation to<br />
spread over more than a century of active and successful development. But<br />
It was not just that he was successful in producing things that were of value<br />
to people, to help them and make them feel better. He had a keen sense of<br />
public service, of devotion to the health of the people, and somehow he felt<br />
responsible for the ethics of the industry.<br />
The high standard of ethics which the pharmaceutical industry<br />
feels it desirable to employ dates back really, I think it could be fairly<br />
claimed, to this man. Certainly he was one of the great moulders of a fine<br />
tradition. He was dedicated to the health of mankind. He launched a new era<br />
in pharmacy, and I don't think it is stretching it too much to say, when you<br />
speak in terms of human well-being and happiness, he launched a new era in<br />
human fulfilment and enjoyment. He gave his personal attention to his products.<br />
In the early stages, he used to personally sign the bottles or containers that<br />
carried his products, and his signature was synonymous with the quality of<br />
his products. And without wishing to give an advertising spiel to those now<br />
produced by the Squibb organisation, again it can be fairly said that these<br />
high standards have been maintained. / 3 </p>
<p>-3<br />
In doing a little research about him, I came across the official<br />
opinion expressed of him by the Committee of Revision of the United States<br />
Pharmacopoeia and I think this was some time after his death, but that is<br />
immaterial. I quote this passage ' Dr. Squibb had the unique distinction<br />
of possessing a sound knowledge of medicine, an innate fondness for chemical<br />
research, an extraordinary grasp of pharmacy and of the scientists' ideal<br />
love of truth. He could always be found opposing any course which tended to<br />
weaken the cause of righteousness or ethics. And that is a fine tradition for<br />
this company to have inherited. It Is a fine thing that it should be maintained.<br />
It is difficult for a modern user of drugs to understand the<br />
significance of Dr. Squibbs' crusade because national laws protect the life<br />
and health of the people against adulterated drugs, there are now legal standards<br />
for pharmaceutical production, false and extravagant claims are outlawed,<br />
reputable drug manufacturers police their own production facilities and impoe<br />
their own high standards. And what a contrast this is from the dark ages of<br />
patent medicines, old wives' remedies, adulterated compounds and mysterious<br />
potions. The presence of my colleague, the Minister for Immigration reminds<br />
me, Mr. McCloy, that he was the Minister, then Attorney-General, who<br />
introduced the restrictive practices legislation which also, no doubt, serves<br />
as some sort of protectiort In this field.<br />
Now, when I say it is difficult for us to realise what these things<br />
mean to us because we tend to take them for granted as available for whatever<br />
ailment or malady, temporary or otherwise, afflicts us, my mind goes back to<br />
just a few personal experiences. I lost my own mother when I was a boy from<br />
a bout of pneumonia. A few years later some M B tablets would probably have<br />
saved her life and perhaps prolonged it to this time. Later, Winston Churchill,<br />
you will recall, was stricken more than once with pneumonia, and we remember<br />
how he used to talk about the way the M B tablets saved his life. And I<br />
remember a distinguished Australian statesman, the late Sir Earle Page, who<br />
also from time to time had bouts of pneumonia, and thanks to these modern<br />
specifics, was able to remain in health and survive until a very ripe old age.<br />
Well, these days I am told even M B I hope no disservice to<br />
the firm has been superseded or at least there are others which are turned<br />
to rather more readily, penicillin being regarded as a very effective remedy<br />
for this purpose. And you have only to think about again I turn to<br />
another personal experience. As a boarder at a preparatory school here,<br />
Wesley, when thanks to some tainted milk, we got, several of us, a bout of<br />
typhoid. In those days, the cure for typhoid, as far as I can recall it, was a<br />
course of starvation. You could only take very soft foods or fluids. I was<br />
in bed, I remember, for six weeks and I had a very mild dose well, mild<br />
compared with others. A friend of mine, also a boarder with me at the<br />
preparatory school, now Senator Turnbull I say " a friend of mine"<br />
although he votes against me far more often than he votes for me he had<br />
a bout which lasted three months. Now today you get one of what they call<br />
the broad spectrum antibiotics, and in a matter of a comparatively short time,<br />
you are able to control the symptoms and able to have a very much shorter<br />
period of convalescence. And if you turn to a scourge such as tuberculosis, you see what<br />
a dramatic change has come over the scene in that respect. All of us who<br />
travel at one time or another know the needle treatment which is mildly<br />
uncomfortable at the time but which protects us against what used to be the<br />
scourges of earlier generations of mankind. And these are just a few<br />
illustrations which one might mention of the way in which we have all been<br />
assisted and benefited by these great developments. / 4 </p>
<p>-4<br />
Now, I gather that included in these fields are such items as<br />
tranquillisers and the relief of hypertension. These have a special appeal,<br />
of course, for the politician who frequently needs a course of one or the<br />
other. But these are only a few of the ways in which our life has been made<br />
the pleas anter and the happier as the result of the work of men like Edward<br />
Squibb and those who have followed on him.<br />
This has become a major area of Government activity as well,<br />
and you may be interested to have a f ew facts so far as the Commonwealth<br />
is concerned. We are concerned with the efficacy and quality, of course, of<br />
pharmaceutical products but our principal interest in the industry stems from<br />
our provision of pharmaceutical benefits. Wle are concerned with the safety,<br />
quality and the cost of drugs, and as the number of prescriptions increases,<br />
so do the dangers in herent in the toxic nature of many drugs. I am glad<br />
to report that in this coxy there is, so I am advised by our Department of<br />
Health, excellent co -operation with Squibb and other pharmaceutical<br />
manufacturers and much valuable work is being done through the Australian<br />
Drug Evaluation Committee, with which the Department of Health collaborates.<br />
The Commonwealth's activity in the field of drug safety through<br />
its Therapeutic Substances Branch, through the National Biological Standards<br />
Laboratory, represents practical recognition of its concern for the safety<br />
of drugs being administered to the community. So many new drugs have been<br />
introduced that governments throughout the world have found it appropriate<br />
to establish in the form of legal standards, minimum requirements for drugs<br />
and tiopgical products. We co-operate fully with other governments in<br />
maintaining desirable standards of safety and quality, our main agency for<br />
this being the National Biological Standards Laboratory. All new products<br />
are tested at the laboratory for purity and potency, and unless they conform,<br />
they are not listed in the drugs available under the Pharmaceutical Benefits<br />
Scheme. The Laboratory also carries out continuous sampling of drugs.<br />
Now this is costing us at the present time about $ A92 million<br />
for payments made during 1965/ 66 to chemists for dispensing pharmaceutical<br />
benefits, thus making the pharmaceutical benefits the third largest<br />
expenditure of the Commonwealth Government on social services. Of the<br />
$ 92 million paid by the Commonwealth Government to chemists, approximately<br />
$ 57 million represented the cost of the drugs to the chemist, that is, their<br />
value at wholesale prices.<br />
Now, another consideration which has attracted me here today<br />
is the way in which this enterprise represents, I believe, a shining example<br />
of the benefit of overseas investment and of enlightened approaches on the<br />
part of the management to the problem of overseas investment. The staff,<br />
I am informed, including the management of the firm, is an all-Australian<br />
staff. That does not mean that in this country there is any veto on the<br />
presence or the management or inclusion in substantial numbers in the staff<br />
of the nationals f rom whence the investment comes, but it is a reflection,<br />
I believe, of the faith that the management of Squibbs have in the Australian<br />
people, of their capacity that in this enterprise, expanding as it is, they<br />
h ave included an all-Australian staff.<br />
The plant and again this is a bull point so far as I am concerned<br />
will produce not only for the Australian market but for export. The firm is<br />
engaging in basic research and no doubt is able to draw on the research of<br />
the parent company which in turn is a part of an enormous American<br />
organisation, Olin Mathieson. I notice, looking through the annual report<br />
of Olin Mathieson that they also manufacture WVinchester rifles and perhaps,<br />
Mr. McCloy, it was a wise decision to have a separate chemical company </p>
<p>altogether, otherwise you might have had thrust on you the slogan " Kill<br />
them or cure them<br />
We applaud this research because it is through this that<br />
productivity and efficiency develop and I have spoken earlier of the confidence<br />
which this Investment demonstrates in the future of Australia by a well<br />
known and reputable firm from overseas, conscious not only of the<br />
opportunities in this country but seeing, I think, with a far-sightedness<br />
tshoamt et hpea prtrso douf ctths iso fr eAguiosntr aliina winh itchhe wfuet ufirned moauyrs pelrvoevse trheaand itehro soef fernotmry ointh, er<br />
countries, including the United States Itself.<br />
Some of you have heard me talk abott the fact that we occu py a<br />
very special place and I am prompted to say this because Mr, McCloy's<br />
remarks took a broad range over the world scene we occupy a special<br />
place In relationi to Cambodia, which I have visited quite recently. You are<br />
aware, Mr, McCloy, as, the Ambassador is, that the United States not having<br />
diplomatic relations with this country, Cambodia, Australia represents<br />
Americati interests in Cambodia, as indeed we represent Cambodian<br />
interests in South Viet Nam. I think I can claim that there are very few<br />
Heads of Government and this is not something T claim for myself; it<br />
is reflective of the country who could have visited the four countries I<br />
visited so recently. Some could get to two, some would have been acceptable<br />
in three; very few people would have been acceptable in the four. And I<br />
make that point because I think that it is wise for any vast organisation with<br />
an International distribution to include Australia as one of its distributing<br />
points. Ours is a friendly country, we are on friendly terms with our<br />
northern neighbours and from this point, export can be readily arranged.<br />
Now we have tried to set a climate in this country encouraging<br />
to investment, prod ucing for ourselves prosperity and full employment,<br />
rising standards of living and good prospects of expansion. We believe that<br />
responsible overseas investment in Australia is not only desirable but<br />
essential to supplement our own efforts to invest, and thereby maintain our<br />
rate of growth. Australia invests a high proportion of its gross national<br />
product. We are not waiting for other people to come and do the job for us.<br />
The Chaiman of the Board may be interested to know that of the<br />
total capital investment in this country between 85 per cent and 90 per cent.<br />
comes from Australian sources themselves, but we do value the extra<br />
per cent to 15 per cent, that comes to us from overseas, with the know-how<br />
it brings, with the research that frequently accompanies it, with the skilled<br />
executive management that also frequently comes in the wake of the investment.<br />
And Australia invests a higher proportion of its gross national product than<br />
I think any other country in the world with the exception of Japan, more<br />
than one and a half times the proportion invested in the United States or in<br />
the United Kingdom. So you will gather, Mr. McCloy, and I am saying this because<br />
he has got a very good entree to the President of the United States, and the<br />
sting is in the tall because 90 per cent, of investment in Australia has come<br />
from two sources the United Kingdom and the United States of America.<br />
Both of those countries for economic reasons of their own and financial<br />
reasons of their own, have found it necessary to place some restraint on the<br />
movement of capital here. But I am sure, as you look at Australia and see<br />
its relationship, geographically and otherwise to the United States, to those<br />
countries of this region In which the United States has a profound interest, / 6 </p>
<p>4 -6<br />
it will strike you, as a man with your international experience, experience<br />
in international affairs, and in financial and legal affairs, that it should be<br />
a prime United States' interest to help to make this country strong, and we<br />
don't say that in any spirit of seeking some charity from others. VWe have<br />
never sought nor accepted a dollar of aid from the United States of America,<br />
but w'e do believe it to be a continuing United States' interest to see that<br />
Australia grows and that that growth is assisted by a steady flow of<br />
investment capital from the United States of America.<br />
Now, over the last twelve months, largely as the result of<br />
the reasons I have mentioned, there has been some fall away not falling<br />
away of interest as I am sure the Ambassador will confirm. His life is<br />
made hectic rather than busy, contending and coping with those who come<br />
from overseas seeking out opportunities in Australia or wondering what<br />
can be done here. And I hope that this appreciation of what Australia can<br />
mean to this region in which the United States is showing such a commendable<br />
interest the South-East Asian and Pacific region and indeed of Asia<br />
generally, the whole area East of Suez in which are to be found three-fifths<br />
of mankind, that in this picture there will be seen quite clearly a place for<br />
a growing, strengthening Australia as a contributing factor to stability, to<br />
progress, to leadership in this area of the world.<br />
Now that has got a little outside my charter. I was tempted<br />
to introduce it because you, Mr. McCloy, were kind enough to give us<br />
your own picture of Australia in a world setting. And I am looking forward<br />
greatly to seeing the President again in the first week of June, and I know<br />
that he has a deep affection for this country and he has a recognition of<br />
its importance in the directions that I have mentioned. I know that it is<br />
a product of his resolution, as it was of two American Presidents who<br />
preceded him, that America sees the necessity of building a better world<br />
order in the area of the world in which we find ourselves, and that is why<br />
we so wholeheartedly have aligned ourselves with you and why we are so<br />
determined to see these issues through with you. Our countries together,<br />
I think, can make a great contribution to strength, to stability, to progress<br />
and security in this area of the world, and this establishment, which shortly<br />
I will formally declare open, is itself tangible evidence of the way in which<br />
the best that ewines from America can be married to what is good in<br />
Australia. We encourage immigration of people and we find that we<br />
have been able to assimilate them readily, happily for ourselves and<br />
happily for them. L Unbrenlightened leadership by overseas investors<br />
there can be the same happy marriage between capital from overseas,<br />
techniques, know-how and executive skills from overseas with the<br />
opportunities available here in Australia.<br />
May Squibb play a significant and growing part in that<br />
co-operation and I wish you every success for your future. </p>
