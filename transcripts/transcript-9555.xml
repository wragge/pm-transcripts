STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P. J. KEATING MP<br />
ANZAC DAY 1995<br />
Today, across the continent and in many places around the world, we are<br />
gathered to remember our countrymen and women who, because they<br />
believed in Australia and saw their duty to it, were prepared to lay down their<br />
lives in war.<br />
This is the eightieth anniversary of the event from which Anzac Day derives,<br />
the landing at Gallipoli and the tragic and disastrous military campaign which<br />
followed it. Anzac Day is not a celebration of military victory, or a glorification<br />
of war. But it is the most important and profound day in Australia's national<br />
life. It is the day we pay tribute to Australians who died so that we could live in<br />
peace and continue the task of building a good and prosperous country. It is<br />
the day when we reflect upon the meaning of their sacrifice. It is the day<br />
when we ask our children to reflect and learn what it means to love Australia<br />
and have faith in it.<br />
We took from Gallipoli, and we have taken from every subsequent war in<br />
which Australians have fought and died, the message contained in that<br />
sacrifice: that it is good to be brave and to endure difficulty, and that we are<br />
bravest, most able to endure and most likely to succeed when we know we<br />
can rely on each other, when we stick together.<br />
Anzac gave us this creed to live by as Australians and as a nation. It has<br />
given us strength in war and in peace.<br />
The spirit lives on in the ceremonies taking place today. It is present in the<br />
Australia Remembers celebrations to mark the end of World War II. It is<br />
there among the young Australians who are presently touring the battlefields<br />
on which their great grandfathers fought.<br />
We hope and believe that it lives on in all our lives and that, by remembering<br />
those who died, the faith will be carried on into future generations of<br />
Australians. CANBERRA April 1995 </p>
