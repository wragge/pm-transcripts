FOR PRESS 20 MARCH 1978<br />
ADDRESS AT AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL ANIMAL HEALTH LABORATORY<br />
GEELONG<br />
I am delighted to be with you today. Senator Webster has<br />
given you an excellent outline of the purpose of the Australian<br />
National Animal Health Laboratory. For my part, I feel very<br />
strongly that today marks a significant.-milestone in the history<br />
of Australia's livestock industries indeed of Australia itself.<br />
Since our nation was founded, livestock industries have played<br />
a major role in the development and maintenance of<br />
Australia's well-being. The CSIRO, since its beginning, has<br />
contributed markedly to the welfare of Australia and its vital<br />
export industries.<br />
Last financial year exports of Australian livestock products<br />
were valued at more than $ 2,500 million. This project the<br />
most advanced of its kind in the world is tangible evidence<br />
of the Commonwealth Government's commitment to protect and<br />
enhance the well-being of Australia's primary industries.<br />
The start of construction of the Australian National Animal<br />
Health Laboratory also speaks, in tangible form, of the<br />
Government's continuing commitment to the CSIRO as the nation's<br />
leading scientific organisation. The decision to provide<br />
$ 83 million for this project was not taken lightly. In<br />
providing funds, we were conscious of several major factors-.<br />
Firstly, the dependence Australia hs on primary industries for<br />
almost half of our export income; secondly, the vulnerable<br />
position of livestock industries from the introduction of<br />
exotic diseases to Australia. If a disease such as foot and<br />
mouth were to become established in Australia, apart from the<br />
direct costs of eradication measures, the loss in export trade<br />
to overseas markets would be close to $ 50 a month. Such<br />
a loss would reverberate throughout the entire Australian economy.<br />
The Government, in building this facility, is taking a major step<br />
to minimise such losses. Unfortunately, the risks of such diseases<br />
entering the country are increasing with greater international<br />
movement of people, livestock and livestock products. 2 </p>
<p>In recent years, three exotic diseases affecting horses<br />
have been detected in Australia. Emergency action was required<br />
to prevent devastation of the poultry industry by fowl plague<br />
and a strain of buletongue was discovered in Northern Australia.<br />
The Government's commitment to the construction of the Australian<br />
National Animal Health Laboratory forms part of our overall<br />
policy of protecting and enhancing the welfare of Australia's<br />
primary industries, industries that are vital to our economic future<br />
as a nation. During the last three years the Government has<br />
initiated a range of measures aimed at improving the viability<br />
of rural industries and the communities dependent on them.<br />
These measures include: increased funding for local governments<br />
and rural roads; the introduction of the investment allowance;<br />
assistance for the States for drought relief programmes;<br />
the establishment of income equalisation deposits and soon of<br />
the Australian Rural Bank; extension of rural reconstruction<br />
loans; funding of the Australian Plague Locust Commission;<br />
acceleration of brucellosis and toberculosis eradication<br />
in cattle $ 38 million has been provided for this during the<br />
past two years; our continuing supportof the -reserve price for the<br />
Australian wool clip; the continuing international negotiatioms<br />
which have led to improved access for primary products<br />
to the United States and Japan.<br />
For Australia's hard-pressed beef industry, the Government has<br />
introduced specific measures such as the Commonwealth Beef<br />
Industry incentive Payments Scheme. Already $ 45 million has been<br />
paid direct to producers under this Scheme. In addition, we<br />
have allocated $ 28 million over the past two years for carry-on<br />
loans for beef producers an allocation that is being matched<br />
dollar-for-dollar by State Governments.<br />
The construction of this Laboratory forms part of the<br />
Government's overall policy for the protection and development of<br />
Australia's primary industries. I am pleased to be with you<br />
today at the beginning of construction of the Australian National<br />
Animal Health Farm. </p>
