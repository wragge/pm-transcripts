SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
PARLIAMENTARY DINNER FOR<br />
NEW ZEALAND PRIME MINISTER,<br />
MR GEOFFREY PALMER<br />
CANBERRA 2 JULY 1990<br />
Prime Minister Geoffrey Palmer and Mrs Margaret Palmer,<br />
Excellencies, Parliamentary Colleagues<br />
Ladies and Gentlemen<br />
Historians of the future seeking to understand and describe<br />
the dynamism and the enduring nature of the relationship<br />
between Australia and New Zealand will undoubtedly look back<br />
on the year 1990 with justifiable interest.<br />
Their conclusion, will, I am sure, confirm our contemporary<br />
judgement that this year indeed marks a watershed in the<br />
growth of our two countries.<br />
We have already this year marked the 150th anniversary of<br />
the Treaty of Waitangi and I recall with pleasure my visit<br />
to Auckland earlier this year to convey to New Zealanders<br />
the good wishes of all Australans in those celebrations.<br />
Since then we have shared in the heart-wrenching emotions of<br />
Anzac Day a powerful reminder and reaffirmation of the<br />
sturdy comradeship between Australians and New Zealanders<br />
forged by the ANZACs at Gallipoli 75 years ago.<br />
But as significant as those occasions were, they were<br />
essentially commemorations of past deeds.<br />
Today we are celebrating a thoroughly contemporary<br />
achievement a proof that the long standing friendship<br />
between us is not only still very much alive, but is being<br />
expressed in ways that are new, important and<br />
forward-looking.<br />
It's an achievement that will ensure Australia and New<br />
Zealand remain close and constructive partners well into the<br />
next century. </p>
<p>The achievement is the removal of the last barriers to trade<br />
in goods across the Tasman. From yesterday, 1 July, trade in<br />
goods across the Tasman is absolutely free and unfettered.<br />
That represents for both of us a major victory under the<br />
Closer Economic Relations agreement an agreement that is<br />
progressively delivering benefits to the 21 million people<br />
of our two countries in the form of greater access to a<br />
wider range of goods in a more competitive market.<br />
It has taken years of hard work to reach this point. It is<br />
the culmination of a long process which began when people of<br />
foresight in both our countries recognised that if we were<br />
to remain competitive and ensure our place in the regional<br />
and global economy, it was essential that we work together.<br />
Let me take this opportunity publicly to recognise the<br />
vision, determination and cooperation of the " founding<br />
fathers" of the Closer Economic Relations Agreement, some of<br />
whom are here tonight. It was the previous Australian<br />
Government that was responsible on this side of the Tasman<br />
for the preparatory work on CER, and my comments tonight<br />
reflect a truly bipartisan sense of satisfaction over the<br />
way in which CER has developed over the years.<br />
Since the CER Agreement came into force in 1983, total<br />
bilateral trade has grown from just under $ 1 billion in 1983<br />
to about $ 4.5 billion in 1989. That is an average annual<br />
rate of 15 per cent faster than the growth in trade by<br />
either country with the rest of the world.<br />
Our exports to you were worth about $ 2.5 billion last year<br />
a 100 per cent increase since 1983.<br />
And your exports to us broke through the $ 2 billion mark<br />
last year up from three quarters of a billion in 1983.<br />
So in this larger pie, the balance of trade is very close to<br />
equal. At the same time, the total stock of trans-Tasman investment<br />
has grown from about $ 1.5 billion in 1983 to more than<br />
billion at the end of last year.<br />
Those achievements of course have not happened by accident<br />
or through benign neglect. They have come about because<br />
governments on both sides of the Tasman have acted, with<br />
determination and foresight, to make sure that our economies<br />
are strong, competitive and unhampered by unnecessary<br />
regulation.<br />
And they have come about, too, because business leaders and<br />
unionists on both sides of the Tasman have seen and grasped<br />
the opportunitities for change and have built a dynamic and<br />
very productive Australia-New Zealand relationship.<br />
Let's not assume, either, that this achievement is an end in<br />
itself. </p>
<p>There is still much to be done, both under the CER agreement<br />
and in pursuit of micro-economic reform in each of our<br />
countries. As we said in our communique earlier today, we want<br />
Australians and New Zealanders each to be able to regard the<br />
other's economy as an extension of their own. The Tasman<br />
will not be a legal, administrative or financial barrier to<br />
the free flow of commerce.<br />
For Australia's part, I assure New Zealanders publicly, as I<br />
have told Mr Palmer privately, that in considering our<br />
micro-reform options we are committed to taking due account<br />
of our CER obligations.<br />
A major review of the CER Agreement is scheduled for 1992<br />
and we have announced today a mechanism to establish an<br />
agenda for that review, in consultation with the business<br />
community, unions, professions and other interested people.<br />
This review will be an exciting one. It will take us beyond<br />
the familiar domain of economic issues into uncharted<br />
territory. Both of us have, rightly, rejected the notion of political<br />
union. That is not on the agenda. But we have to acknowledge<br />
that as economic integration proceeds, complex questions<br />
will be raised about how best to co-ordinate and harmonise<br />
the decisions and actions of two sovereign nations.<br />
As a result progress may be a bit harder in the future than<br />
it has been so far. That does not mean we should ease up;<br />
it means we should try harder. And to that end we have<br />
agreed that the Australian and New Zealand Prime Ministers<br />
will aim to meet together once a year to take an annual<br />
stocktake of the total bilateral relationship.<br />
As our increasing joint economic strength is applied to take<br />
full advantage of the regional and wider world market, so<br />
too must we translate the sorts of free trade commitments we<br />
have under CER to the wider trading environment. The<br />
creation of a market of about 21 million people is not an<br />
end in itself.<br />
Australia and New Zealand are committed to free and fair<br />
international trade. We must maintain our continued joint<br />
pressure for a successful outcome to the Uruguay Round of<br />
multilateral trade negotiations. We will work together with<br />
New Zealand in ensuring that more open trading arrangements<br />
and cooperation are developed through the process of Asia<br />
Pacific Economic Cooperation.<br />
The Uruguay Round is the major international economic<br />
enterprise in which we are currently engaged. Australia and<br />
New Zealand are working closely together for a successful<br />
outcome to the Round across the full spectrum of<br />
negotiations. </p>
<p>The GATT system has been placed under enormous strain by<br />
continued recourse to protectionism and discrimination,<br />
often by countries which themselves have benefitted greatly<br />
from the existence of the GATT.<br />
Agriculture is a case in point. Agricultural policies in<br />
the OECD area led to a total transfer from consumers and<br />
taxpayers of US$ 245 billion in 1989.<br />
Australian and New Zealand producers, the world's most<br />
efficient, are kept out of markets in which consumers are<br />
forced to pay inflated prices for basic foodstuffs.<br />
Countries are being denied opportunities to trade their way<br />
out of their problems.<br />
Resources that could be applied through investment to the<br />
restructuring of Eastern Europe are being diverted to<br />
generate inefficient production.<br />
For all these reasons, agriculture is the pivotal issue in<br />
the achievement of a successful outcome in the Round. It is<br />
also why our two countries will continue to work closely in<br />
the Cairns Group of fair-trading agricultural nations to<br />
ensure a fair game and a level playing field.<br />
Mr Prime Minister<br />
Speaking of playing fields it's traditional that whenever<br />
Australians and New Zealanders get together, the talk turns<br />
to sport.<br />
Unfortunately we could not continue our regular Trans-Tasman<br />
Prime Ministerial golf tournament this morning; I think<br />
under the atrocious weather at dawn our scores would have<br />
made us look more like cricketers than golfers.<br />
When we last met, we presented two perpetual trophies for<br />
trans-Tasman competition in women's cricket and rugby<br />
league. our women cricketers have already been able to<br />
bring the Southern Cross Trophy back across the Tasman. We<br />
are also looking forward to the back-to-back competitions<br />
coming up in August in both codes of rugby with the<br />
Australasian Trophy for League and the Bledisloe Cup for<br />
Union. But with all this talk of trophies, Mr Prime Minister, let's<br />
not forget the main prize.<br />
In meeting today to celebrate the achievement of free trade<br />
in goods between our two countries, we're not celebrating a<br />
victory of one side at the expense of the other.<br />
We're rejoicing in a triumph of mutual cooperation and<br />
shared endeavour, where the trophy is enhanced prosperity<br />
for future generations of Australians and New Zealanders. </p>
<p>The increasing integration of our markets, our close and<br />
effective liaison over the full range of policy issues and<br />
our close cooperation in international forums, add up to a<br />
startling and deeply encouraging fact: the Tasman that<br />
separates us is becoming more and more like a bridge that<br />
brings us together.<br />
And let me close my saying to you personally, Mr Prime<br />
Minister, how much we on this side admire and respect your<br />
contribution to this achievement.<br />
It is common ground that neither Australians nor New<br />
Zealanders wish to abandon or undermine the separate<br />
national identities of which we are so proud.<br />
Within that framework, you have displayed vision, energy,<br />
and political will, and you have demonstrated the capacity<br />
to take tough decisions necessary for New Zealand's<br />
long-term future.<br />
That determination has delivered benefits not only for New<br />
Zealanders but for Australians too.<br />
So we are all the winners as a result.<br />
That fundamentally is the cause for celebration today. In<br />
welcoming you to Canberra on this visit, we salute you for<br />
your active contribution to the cause of closer economic<br />
relations between relations between Australia and<br />
New Zealand. </p>
