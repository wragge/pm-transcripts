PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 19 February 1984<br />
The Prime Minister said today that Queensland taxpayers would<br />
be forced to foot the bill for Mr Bjelke-Petersen's bloodyminded<br />
refusal to sign the Medicare agreement. Queenslanders<br />
who have kept some private insurance are already paying an<br />
extra $ 1.10 a week because of Mr Bjelke-Petersen's folly.<br />
The Queeensland Government cannot stand the loss of $ 6 million<br />
a month in Medicare funding, and they will soon be forced to<br />
significantly increase State Taxes if they persist in not<br />
signing. I have left the door open for Mr Bjelke-Petersen to sign now<br />
without financial penalty to the State, but if he doesn't<br />
reconsider shortly then Queensland will lose out just as it<br />
did in 1975. Mr Bjelke-Petersen signed two months late then<br />
and Queensland lost $ 14 million because of the delay.<br />
Mr Bjelke-Petersen claims he is fighting for a better deal<br />
for Queensland, but his track record is very bad when it comes<br />
to health funding. As well as his 1975 fiasco, there was<br />
scarcely a whimper when Mr Fraser reduced Queensland's health<br />
grant by$ 100 million a year in 1981. When my Government offers<br />
a $ 73 million annual increase in hospital funding he refuses<br />
because he claims it isn't enough.<br />
The Queensland Government concedes that it will be better off<br />
under Medicare. The simple truth is that Mr Bjelke-Petersen<br />
is playing politics at the expense of the Queensland taxpayer.<br />
As many Queenslanders have already found, Medicare is of substantial<br />
benefit to the average person, and Mr Bjelke-Petersen also knows<br />
that it will be of great benefit to State Government finances.<br />
He may think that he can squeeze more money out of the Federal<br />
Government through this bluff, butI have examined the situation<br />
thoroughly and I am sure that Queensland is receiving<br />
a fair and reasonable deal. If the State Government thinks<br />
differently it can take the matter to the Grants Commission,<br />
but it is now time for Mr Bjelke-Petersen to reconsider and sign<br />
before all Queenslanders suffer unnecessarily as a result of<br />
his actions. </p>
