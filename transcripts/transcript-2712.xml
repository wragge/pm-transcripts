PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR PRESS: PM. No. 97/ 1972<br />
D. F. R. B. AND SUPERANNUATION ENQUIRIES<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister, the Rt. Hon. William<br />
1McMahon,<br />
On 26 October 1972, I made a statement in the<br />
House of Representatives on the outcome of the Government's<br />
consideration of the Report of the Joint Select Committee<br />
on Defence Fcrces Retiriment Benefits Legislation.<br />
In the course of this statement I announced that<br />
the Government had detcided to arrange for independent expert<br />
investigation in respect of two matters arising from the<br />
Report. The tasks are to enquire into and report on:<br />
whether it is practicable to transfer, in an<br />
equitable way and without detriment to any of<br />
them, Pre-1959 and Post-1959 D. F. R. B.<br />
contributors to a new, simple and readily<br />
comprehensible, D. F. R. B. scheme; and<br />
methods of adjusting after retirement pensions<br />
payable under the D. F. P. B. and Commonwealth<br />
Superannuation Acts.<br />
The two asnects are quite distinct and the<br />
Government has therefore decided that the enquiries should<br />
be conducted senaratel. Terms of Reference for each enquiry<br />
have now been determined and are attached.<br />
The enquiries are complicated and technically<br />
difficult and the Government has decided that each enquiry<br />
should be conducted by one expert assisted as necessary by<br />
assessors. / 2 </p>
<p>The D. F. R. B. transfer enquiry will be conducted<br />
by Mr. J. G. Rutherford, the Queensland State Actuary and<br />
Insurance Commissioner.<br />
The pensions adjustment enquiry will be conducted<br />
by Professor A. H. Pollard, who is the Director of Actuarial<br />
Studies and the Head of the School of Economics and<br />
Financial Studies at Macquarie University, Sydney.<br />
CANBERRA, 6 November 1972 </p>

contributors to a new D. F. R. B. scheme;<br />
the provision to be made in the transfer<br />
arrangements to ensure that existing<br />
contributors would not be disadvantaged<br />
in such a new scheme, bearing in mind<br />
the Government's assurance on 20 September<br />
1972 that they would have a right of<br />
election; the broad framework of the legislation<br />

arrangements for implementing the conclusions<br />
