    <content><![CDATA[<p>Q!<br />PRIME MINISTER<br />CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY<br />SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />CLOSING CEREMONY OF WORLD EXPO 88<br />BRISBANE 30 OCTOBER 1988<br />Sir Edward Williams,<br />Sir Liew Edwards,<br />Distinguished Guests,<br />Ladies and Gentlemen.<br />Tonight the final curtain falls on the biggest single event<br />of the Bicentennial celebrations: World Expo 88. I believe<br />the applause for this event will ring on loudly for many<br />months and many years because Expo 88 has truly been a<br />stunning performance.<br />Throughout Australia many people have participated<br />enthusiastically in many Bicentennial events. But no<br />Bicentennial event can match the magnificent record of<br />participation achieved by Expo 88: 38 national governments,<br />12 other governments, 154 corporations including 32 as<br />exhibitors and most importantly 15.5 million visitors from<br />Australia and around the world.<br />Expo's success is due to the unfailing dedication,<br />determination and vitality of many people. I especially<br />want to extend my thanks to Ned Williams,<br />Commissioner-General of Expo 88, representing the Australian<br />Government, and the Commissioners-General for each pavilion<br />for their vital contribution. And let me say that as<br />Chairman of the Expo Authority, Llew Edwards has from the<br />outset been a superb chief executive of a massive and<br />enormously successful undertaking.<br />It seems incredible that only a fey months before Expo<br />opened it was being written off as an impending<br />embarrassment, even a disaster. Today we all recognise that<br />in every respect it has been a brilliant success.<br />Commercially, world Expo 88 has been a resounding winner.<br />The huge influx of tourists has been one manifestation of<br />this. But, even more enduringly, it is estimated that as a<br />direct result of contacts made under the Busiqess Visitors<br />Program, trade contracts worth some $ 350 million have been<br />signed. This is very good news for the Australian and<br />Queensland economies.<br />31.22 Wo ex Au cc I Cc, erl B t. r A rh</p>
<p>World Expo 88 will long be remembered as one of the best<br />examples of what can be achieved through those great<br />Australian qualities of hard work, long term vision and<br />co-operation among all the sections of our society.<br />I pay tribute to all those many people from the<br />Commonwealth, State and foreign Governments and from private<br />enterprise who hAve worked in close co-operation to make<br />Expo 88 the success it has been.<br />I am proud the Federal Government was a supporter of this<br />major Bicentennial event from start to finish.<br />One of the important and pleasing features of the<br />Bicentenary is that it has given us* the opportunity to show<br />the world what great attributes Australia has to offer, and<br />to reaffirm and strengthen our links with the nations of our<br />region and of the wider global community.<br />As well as being a celebration in its own right and a<br />recognition of human achievement and initiative, Expo 88<br />has, through the participation of our international friends,<br />provided a timely reminder of our common heritage as<br />citizens of the world.<br />So, to those who leave Expo tonight,' letime say that your<br />time here has left us with fond memories of your friendship.<br />We have enjoyed your company and hope you take with you many<br />happy memories of Australia. And to the citizens of<br />Brisbane and Queensland who will tomorrow begin the first<br />day of the rest of their lives without Expo, I offer you my<br />thanks for the unstinting hospitality and warm welcome you<br />have extended to the world.<br />I an pleased to say that Australia will be present when the<br />Expo curtain is raised again in Seville, Spain, in 1992 when<br />we will renew the friendships which have been established so<br />firmly at World Expo 88 in Brisbane. ,3 123</p>
