SOUTH PACIFIC FORUM<br />
PRESS CONFERENCE BY FORUM SPOKESMAN<br />
THE HON P J KEAING, MP, PRIME MINISTER OF AUSTRALIA<br />
PARKROYAL HOTEL, BRISBANEt QUEENSLAND<br />
TUESDAY 2AUGUST, 1994<br />

PM: Well, I might say thank you indeed. I think that the Pacific leaders feel<br />
quite proud of the achievements of this Forum. The outcomes have<br />
justified our confidence in changing the format to bring the retreat to<br />
centre stage. Allowing leaders to discuss privately real issues of<br />
significance to their economies and societies has proven, I think that<br />
the leaders are very much up to grappling with the big issues. And, I<br />
think on the theme of managing our resource, which was the theme of<br />
the Forum, they have shown that concrete actions go beyond words,<br />
and there have been plenty of those, On the big topics I mentioned to<br />
you yesterday, for instance, forestry, during the morning we held a<br />
separate meeting of Forum Uimber producing countries thafts<br />
Australia, Fiji, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, the Solomon Islands<br />
and Vanuatu and agreed to work towards a common code of<br />
conduct on forests, to which companies operating in those countries<br />
would have to adhere, and agreed to increase urgently the monitoring<br />
of logging. And, we've agreed that forestry officials will meet within<br />
two months to work on this, although we will be progressing the<br />
monitoring more quickly than that This is in addition to that to which<br />
we agreed yesterday about common legislation et cetera, which we<br />
gave you notice of last night On fisheries, of course, leaders have<br />
agreed on the merits of multi-lateral approaches in order to get fairer<br />
returns than at present On airlines, leaders have agreed to examine<br />
options for rationalising airlines in order to reduce losses, which are a<br />
point which I advised you of yesterday. On tourism, leaders agreed on<br />
the need to protect fragile coastal zones. Al offhk was confirmed<br />
again today in the plenary session in ihe communique.<br />
During this morning's meeting, we also agreed that South Pacific<br />
finance ministers would meet to discuss ways of dealing with common<br />
problems of public sector and fiscal mismanagement, where it might be<br />
a difficulty, and to put remedial changes into budgets, which all of us<br />
need to do from time to time. Finance ministers generally have the<br />
burden of being at the hard edge of all change in governments,<br />
particularly where the public sectors of governments are the<br />
predominate sectors and, we think. therefore, a meetin of finance<br />
ministers might be an appropriate thing to be doing. and where we </p>
<p>might be able to share each other's experiences and look at trend<br />
behaviour in fiscal policies. Other matters discussed and agreed<br />
during formal sessions are covered in the Forum communique, which<br />
of course, you have. Australia made two announcements, a South<br />
Pacific 2000 program, which will help South Pacific countries<br />
participate in the Sydney Olympic Games and benefit from them<br />
because the South Pacific gave very stong support to Australia in its<br />
Olympic campaign. And, also, additional support to South Pacific<br />
countries under the SPARTECA trade arrangements for export<br />
development and foreign investment promotion.<br />
Overall, I think the meeting clearly shows the understanding that South<br />
Pacific leaders have, of the urgent challenges we face. And, the thing<br />
that impressed me, I must say, particularly, was the political will that<br />
they all showed in seeking to manage those challenges, and their<br />
willingness to actually grasp the nettle on big problems. I think the<br />
Forum has again proven its value as an institution. The drive for better<br />
management of our natural resources is something that each of the<br />
leaders feels strongly about, and I think the results of the Forum reflect<br />
a collective commitment to use our resources in a sustainable way. I<br />
think the Forum concluded with the leaders fairly pleased with<br />
themselves that in a much more concentrated period of time, in two<br />
days, and with a theme for the Forum that they have been able to<br />
maximise their time and the opportunity of their meeting together to<br />
grasp these larger problems, and we now have a year to consider<br />
those problems before the next Forum meeting in Papua New Guinea:<br />
Now, rd be glad to take questions.<br />
J Phillip Williams, ABC, one of the leaders I spoke to expressed concern<br />
about Australia's record on greenhouse gas emissions and called on<br />
Australia to make specific comfittments to adhere to the convention<br />
and not to seek any exemptions from the individual conventions. Can<br />
you give those guarantees that will take place?<br />
PM That argument has been put about by Greenpeace and Greenpeace<br />
wouldn't know a win if they tripped over it. Let me just tell you this<br />
How many meetings of groups of countries like this are there, deciding<br />
to monitor forests, deciding that they will look at sustainable<br />
development in forests, particularly tropical hardwood forests, deciding<br />
to look at replenishment of stocks in fish and management of fish<br />
stocks, worry about sustainability of fishing fields, putting in place<br />
mechanisms to approach major countries who deal in them? At some<br />
point, organisations like Greenpeace, have got to say, well look, you<br />
go around the world, you talk about climate change, you talk about the<br />
big issues, and you don't get the response from industrial countries,<br />
and you don't get them from the resource rich countries. On this<br />
occasion you've got them, but you'd have to put it up in fluorescent<br />
lights with neon tubes to get the message through to Greenpeace.<br />
Now there is no doubt they will go around hawking their views to forum </p>
<p>island countries who are sitting six to nine feet, two or three metres<br />
above the surface of the sea, saying, well, and telling them<br />
erroneously that tomorrow they'll be doomed. And then saying Where<br />
does Australia stand? Well Australia stands very firmly on the<br />
question of greenhouse gas emissions. It has been part of the lead in<br />
the western world and industrial countries in doing this and again the<br />
communique supports this. But again, this has to be a global<br />
approach-All greenhouse gas emitters have to be treated in an<br />
equitable way and thats where we're going to make a difference but I<br />
think Greenpeace thinks that because the Australian Government has<br />
a proudih envirimntal record and is keen about environmental issues<br />
that Greenpeace will ride Australia to alone not in concert with<br />
industrial countries to alone meet international greenhouse<br />
emissions without others being inclined to that Well, they're wasting<br />
their time. Because what we need here is a global approach and, not<br />
a selective approach. But, more than that, isn't it about time that<br />
Greenpeace and these other environmental bodies actually know when<br />
they've kicked a goal? I mean they're all push and no pull. They're all<br />
push on all these communities but when they actually get a win on<br />
forest and they never know they've got one. They on their big<br />
amorphous subjects. So so much for Green peace. Thank you for the<br />
question.<br />
J Stewart Parker, AAP, the Marshall Islands raised the issue again<br />
today of turning a couple of their islands into some sort of dump for<br />
nuclear waste. I think the President also suggested there may be<br />
some sort of compact among the Pacific Island countries on this issue.<br />
What's been the reaction of the Forum to the question.<br />
PM I specifically asked the President whether he was seeking any<br />
endorsement by the Forum. He indicated no he wasn't That he was<br />
simply telling the Forumr advisedly that he'd set up a national<br />
commission to look at these issues. Now that is within the realm of his<br />
national sovereignty and of course it's the Marshall's prerogative to<br />
consider these issues but its another thing to seek support for them at<br />
the Forum. That he didn't do.<br />
J Paul Smith, Ten Network, Whilst some of the leaders have endorsed<br />
your concern over environmental matters, they've also raised the<br />
question of compensation and seem to be indicating that they'd be<br />
looking to Western countries, such as Australia, to help with<br />
compensation of environmental issues.<br />
PM Well it was never raised with me at any stage, not at any stage. Thas<br />
not to say Australia won't help and do what it can, where it can. But<br />
and as you know, I mean in respect of as the case in point the Marovo<br />
Lagoon in the Western Solomons Australia has In fact agreed to write<br />
off the servicing of a certain amount of-debtas a way of actually<br />
encouraging that to happen and in financially assisting albeit in a </p>
<p>modest way the Solomon Islands Government. But there hasn't been<br />
any general approach by Prime Ministers or Heads of Government to<br />
Australia about compensation.<br />
J Chris Hammer, S05 Television. There's been quite some progress, as<br />
you mentioned, on fishing and forestries but not on some of the other<br />
issues outlined by Gordon Bilney earlier this year, namely population<br />
growth and land reform. As Australian Prime Minister, are you<br />
disappointed about that lack of progress?<br />
PM I don't think you should see it as a lack of progress, I think everyone at<br />
the Forums understands that these are problem issues for some<br />
small island states but the conference had a theme to it and the theme<br />
was Managing Resources and in that theme, we've sought in the two<br />
day period of the conference to try and get some positive outcomes,<br />
and the ones weve got Are very positive indeed and theyl require<br />
work over the course of the year. Now, it may be at the next...<br />
( inaudible)... thars: not to say that some of these other issues are not<br />
being attended to by their national governments as time goes by, or it<br />
may be that at the next Forum or the one after it, if we agree to<br />
continue this, if you like, this focus on themes, that human resource<br />
development education, population, et cetera may be a theme. But,<br />
for the moment because there is an urgency about resource<br />
exploitation resources an acute urgency resource exploitation,<br />
and resource management was the theme, and it was of course<br />
naturally to that we devoted our attention.<br />
J Michael AFP, just to take you back to the Marshall Islands.<br />
Although the President didn't seek endorsement of the Forum, did you<br />
on behalf of Australia or did any of the Pacific leaders actively express<br />
opposition to what he was proposing to you?<br />
PM No because he was very politely advising the Forum of the fact that he<br />
thought, given the fact that certain parts of the Marshall Islands had<br />
been rendered by former nuclear testing as being uninhabitable, that<br />
there may be a purpose and given the geological stability of the area,<br />
in this study being undert aken. Well, these arre views, that's all they<br />
are. These are views, but they are more than views from him, they are<br />
advice that he set up a National Commission. This was not a debate<br />
about the merits of this issue. It was a contribution to the preliminary<br />
session, but I did-ask the President to be clear at the end, was he<br />
seeking any endorsement by the Forum and he said no.<br />
J Victor Larear from Mexico. Four countries from America and three<br />
countries from South Pacific are members of APEC. Is there any<br />
prospects of linking APEC with any organisation lik eFoufr<br />
example? </p>
<p>PM Well, Papua New Guinea is a member of APEC as from the next<br />
meeting and of course Australia and Now Zealand are members of<br />
APEC. So there is a fairly strong, if you like, some very clear<br />
relationships there, between countries with South Pacific interests and<br />
APEC so I've got no doubt that in any APEC context anything which<br />
has a particularly South Pacific focus and needs to be put, there are<br />
enough of us there to be able to put any view we think Is relevant to<br />
the South Pacific<br />
SCraig Skehan, AAP, Mr Keating, The Solomon Islands said they object<br />
to a separate dialogue meeting with Taiwan being held down on the<br />
Gold Coast rather than here in Brisbane, Is that a case of pandering to<br />
the sensitivities of the PRC, and should organisations like the Forumn<br />
allow differences between countries like Taiwan and the PRC to<br />
interfere in normal discussions in AID programs and so o . n.<br />
PM Well, we're the host of this meeting, and I think unusually as host we<br />
are the first among a few who actually recognise the Government of<br />
China as the Government of China, all China, and therefore, it<br />
becomes germaine to any invitation we might be associated with, if not<br />
issue, for Taiwan to come here. As you know, the PRO wanted any<br />
dialogue with Tiwevan to take place in countries which recognise<br />
Taiwan and outside of Australia. Now, as it turns out, we're having the<br />
dialogue on the Gold Coast tomorrow, I think it is, and China will be<br />
attending, that's the PRC will be attending the dialogue partners<br />
meetings and will be attending tonight, the dinner which I am hosting<br />
for dialogue partners and Pacific leaders, so I think honour is being<br />
settled all the way around. I mean, China wanted the meeting outside<br />
Australia, it isn't, they're still coming, Taiwan wanted it here, Wts not<br />
getting its way, its down at the Gold Coast and I think thats a<br />
reasonable compromise of interest and a reasonable outcome for<br />
people who wanted benefit to from the dialogue.<br />
J John Uri, Sydney Pacific News. Earlier on, Prime Minister, I raised the<br />
question with Prime Minister Francis Hilly and the question was that<br />
there is an agreement to provide 2 million dollars to the Solomon<br />
Islands and he stipulated that there is a condition to that offer. Can<br />
you stipulate what that condition is and also can you tell me whether<br />
the Government was actually happy about that If there was any<br />
condition attached to that offer.<br />
PM No, I spoke to the Prime Minister some months ago saying that I was<br />
concerned that one of the prospects for long term tourism in the<br />
Solomons, that's the Marovo Lagoon area, may be deposited in some<br />
way by forest practices and logging and that he said that this was a<br />
concern of his and his Government's and the matter was essentially<br />
left In his hands. What I said was that he also, at the same meeting.<br />
approached me. about some outstanding loans to Australia, and I said<br />
if he incurred costs in dealing with logging in the Marovo Lagoon area </p>
<p>we might meet him part of the way by carrying some of these charges<br />
ourselves. Now, I said that to him. There's been a debate in the<br />
Solomons; about this issue and the Prime Minister at his own behest<br />
made an announcement yesterday saying there'd be a termination of<br />
all logging in that area and then went on to make a further<br />
announcement which you now have details of. Let me just say I<br />
congratulate him for it, I think it shows a lot of leadership and this is the<br />
kind of Government I think the Pacific needs and particularly a country<br />
like the Solomons who now find themselves faced with unscrupulous<br />
practices in logging.<br />
J: Maniko Horokawa from Yomiyuri Shimbum, Japanese Newspaper.<br />
Regarding the fisheries Issues, I've heard that not from the Japanese<br />
side, but the countries that have bilateral agreements wittJapn on<br />
fishing at the moment are quite happy with what they have, so, how<br />
soon do you think that they would get into multilateral agreements, and<br />
have you set any timetables?<br />
PMV: No, just that there is a general view that multilateral management of<br />
this fishery area will produce better results for the countries concerned<br />
and for, those who buy the product Because, we won't reach a point<br />
where we have over exploitation of certain fisheries, and a long term<br />
decline of fish stocks, which, for instance we've seen with the southern<br />
blue fin tuna, which is a very popular, large, species of tuna in Japan.<br />
IWs now not as plentiful as it used to be, and countries which consume<br />
a large level of fish in their diet and Japan is one, is, I think will be<br />
well served by an approach which says, let's make sure that we are<br />
thinking about the habits of t hese migratory fish. What are the<br />
influences on them? How might we protect them? How do we<br />
guaratee the stocks exist? And, the other thing, how do we get a<br />
decent price for the product? Now, its all of that, I think which has<br />
encouraged people to take the view. Now, some bilateral agreements<br />
may suit individual countries, others may not. As a rule, they don't<br />
because, their proceeds are very greatly diminished compared to<br />
some other bilateral arrangements. Understandably they want to<br />
improve these.<br />
J: La Monde from New Caledonia. The Kanak people from New<br />
Caledonia have expressed, since a few years, that they want to<br />
become observers at the Forum. Has this been considered at any<br />
stage? -And, the second thing, what do you think of the right wing not<br />
answering the invitation at the Forum since they have been invited a<br />
few years ago?<br />
PM: Well, look can I just say, it was not discussed at the Forum although of<br />
course we, the -FLNKS come as unofficial observers to the Forum, and<br />
have on this occasi'on. I mean that's fine, that relationship, I think is<br />
working well, and this all depends in the long run on domestic<br />
outcomes in New Caledonia. I think the Forum in a sense is, we are </p>
<p>an interlocutor, we're not deciding, we're not playing a vital role, and<br />
can't play a key role, in their political future.<br />
J: Thank you Mr Keating, my name is Benito Falu from so much for<br />
Greenpeace organisation. Just one question, are you going to honour<br />
your commitment? Yes or no?<br />
PM: I gave you an answer before, and that is that Greenpeace ought to<br />
wake up to itself and work out where there's some value in the world<br />
and not realise when Ws actually got a win like it has over the<br />
weekend it just puts that straight in its pocket and goes onto the<br />
next amorphous issue. Now, I think the Australian government has an<br />
environment record, second to none in the western world. And, it<br />
doesn't need to be kept up to the mark by Greenpeace. Nor are we<br />
encouraged by the fact that a lot of the moderates have been largely<br />
expunged from Greenpeace recently, which I don't think bodes well for<br />
Greenpeace's influences on governments like Australia.<br />
J: Mr Keating, are you concerned at Australia's willingness to train<br />
Indonesian troops is in any way undermining..<br />
PM: Well, I think we'll, I crossed the border yesterday, but I don't think I<br />
should today.<br />
ends </p>
