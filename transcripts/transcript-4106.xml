    <content><![CDATA[<p>REPORT TO THE PRIME MINISTER BY THE ADVISORY GROUP ON THE<br />
AUSTRALIAN SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY COUNCIL<br />
On 9 February, 1976, you announced that you had<br />
asked us to advise you on the role of a Science and<br />
Technology Council, its terms of reference, and all other<br />
matters concerning its operation.<br />
The Group met on March 3 and March 15, 1976. We<br />
now report to you as follows:-<br />
1. Fol. lowing on your announcement of the formation of the<br />
Group, the Minister for Science, the Department of<br />
Defence and several other organizations submitted their<br />
views in regard to the Science and Technology Council<br />
( ASTEC). We believe there are others with a legitimate<br />
interest in the outcome of the Government's<br />
reexamination of ASTEC who would wish to express views<br />
if offered the opportunity. We think that such views<br />
should be sought and warrant careful consideration but<br />
we were faced with the problem that this process would<br />
mean the lapse of several months before we could make a<br />
report to you. We understand that you are anxious to<br />
receive an early report from us and we ourselves think<br />
that an early report is needed because, in the<br />
meantime, the Interim Council of ASTEC and its staff<br />
are unable to take any initiatives pending a statement<br />
of the Government's intentions. The reconciliation of<br />
these conflicting thoughts lead us to recommend to you<br />
an interim and short term course of action which would<br />
bring the members-of the Advisory Group into ASTEC.<br />
This course is set out in the paragraphs which follow.<br />
2. ASTEC should continue in being with the changes in<br />
membership and functions particularised below, but<br />
without change of name.<br />
3. As soon as the Council resumes work with a revised<br />
membership, the Council should be asked to seek and<br />
consider written submissions by interested parties<br />
including Government Departments and Agencies,<br />
particularly ( but not solely) in relation to ASTEC's<br />
modus operandi. This should lead to a definitive<br />
report by the Council to you before the end of 1976.<br />
4. We recommend that, for the time being, the Council be<br />
given as i'ts terms of reference those set out in the<br />
press statement from your Office of 8 December 1975,<br />
the relevant part of which reads as follows:<br />
the Australian Science and Technology Council will<br />
be absolutely independent. ASTEC will advise on the<br />
whole range of science and technology matters in<br />
Government and on the relations between the Government,<br />
universities and industry. The Council will be the<br />
major independent advisor to Government on such matters<br />
as: </p>
<p>2.<br />
The development and application of science and<br />
technology to national needs and objectives.<br />
New areas of science and technology which are of<br />
importance to Australia, including fields of<br />
industrially and commercially oriented research<br />
and development.<br />
The balance, adequacy and effectiveness of<br />
national efforts in various fields of science and<br />
technology, including defence science, and means<br />
for improving efficiency in the use of resources.<br />
The relative importance of efforts in those fields<br />
of science and technology which may contribute to<br />
national economic and social development and<br />
welfare and to the advancement of scientific<br />
knowledge. The effective development and utilisation of<br />
scientific and technological manpower.<br />
As the problems of science involve all areas of<br />
Government, and are of the highest importance to<br />
Australia, ASTEC will report directly to the Prime<br />
Minister who will report to Parliament. The Council<br />
will be a body of the highest status and greatest<br />
independence."<br />
We believe that ad hoc committees and working parties<br />
will have to be used for specific tasks if and when the<br />
need arises in order to provide a wider range of<br />
experience than is possible from within the Council<br />
itself. Any reports by these committees should be<br />
discussed and approved for publication by the Council.<br />
Early publication of Council reports will in many cases<br />
be desirable in order to give an opportunity for<br />
comments from the scientific and the industrial<br />
community before firm decisions on policy are taken by<br />
Government. Before establishing a committee or working<br />
party the Council should obtain Prime Ministerial<br />
approval.<br />
6. In order that the Council may be seen to be as fully<br />
independent as is reasonably practicable it should not<br />
have a special relationship with any department or<br />
ministry having a significant concern with scientific<br />
and technological research and development. For this<br />
reason we strongly recommend that the Council's<br />
Secretariat should be located for the time being within<br />
the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet and<br />
that Council should always report directly to the Prime<br />
Minister. </p>
<p>3.<br />
7. We consider that the Council's work should take<br />
cognizance of the programmes and policies of<br />
Commonwealth Government departments and agencies which<br />
are concerned with science and technology. We see a<br />
need for the Council to be constantly aware of the<br />
attitudes and opinions of such Departments. We believe<br />
that special arrangements should be made to foster<br />
mutual understanding of the work of the Council on the<br />
one hand and relevant Government Departments on the<br />
other.. It is therefore recommended that the Permanent<br />
Heads concerned, or their representatives, should be<br />
invited to attend all meetings of the Council but<br />
without voting rights and without any responsibility<br />
for the Council's decisions. They should be able to<br />
participate freely in the discussions but be excluded<br />
from any presentation of the Council's decisions.<br />
These Departments and Agencies, which have a<br />
significant research and development budget, are:<br />
Department of Defence<br />
Department of Health<br />
Department of National Resources<br />
Department of Post and Telecommunications<br />
Department of Science<br />
and C. S. I. R. O.<br />
Other Departments and Agencies should be offered<br />
similar opportunities to participate as observers as<br />
the need arises.<br />
8. The Council should take care not to engage in work<br />
already being handled in other ways, and should inform<br />
itself on the activities of other Government bodies<br />
dealing with science and technology matters,<br />
particularly bodies such as the Minerals Council, the<br />
Agricultural Council and the proposed Energy Council<br />
which have been established to co-ordinate Commonwealth<br />
and State Government policies.<br />
9. We believe that the Council should consult with<br />
universities, academies and other relevant bodies with<br />
a view to establishing liaison on matters of mutual<br />
interest and to avoid duplication of effort. This<br />
contact should range from seeking expert advice to<br />
requests for studies to be undertaken, but any action<br />
involving financial cost should require prior Prime<br />
Ministerial approval.<br />
Membership: We attach in a covering letter a panel of<br />
names for your consideration for membership of the new<br />
Interim Council.<br />
11. Since our plan is that a fuller and more definitive<br />
report be made to you by the reconstructed Council by<br />
the end of 1976 in the expectation that the Government<br />
will then make long term decisions in regard to ASTEC,<br />
we recommend that the term of office of members of the<br />
reconstituted Council should be for one year only. </p>
<p>12. The question of legislation to establish the Council as<br />
a statutory body should be left in abeyance until the<br />
position is reviewed at the end of 1976.<br />
Dr JA. L. Mateson<br />
Professor G. M. Badger<br />
Professor Sir Rutherford Robertson<br />
Professor R. Street<br />
