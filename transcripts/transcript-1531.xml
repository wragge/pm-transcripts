ASIAN TOUR 1967 VISIT TO CAMBODIA<br />
ARRIVAL PRESS STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
OF AUSTRALIA, THE RT. HON. HAROLD HOLT MP.<br />
It is my privilege to be the first Australian Prime Minister<br />
to visit Cambodia. I do this in response to the gracious invitation of your<br />
eminent Head of State, Prince Norodom Sihanouk. That invitation was<br />
extended to me through the intermediary of His Excellency Mr. Son Sann<br />
during his visit to Australia in February. I have taken the first opportunity<br />
open to me to respond to such a welcome invitation.<br />
I have come here to see your country with my own eyes and<br />
to meet in person your Head of State, your leaders and the people of Cambodia.<br />
My desire to visit Cambodia has been encouraged by all that I have heard<br />
about your country including happy accounts from my Minister for External<br />
Affairs who has twice been your guest in the last three years. I am delighted<br />
that with the comprehensive programme that has been arranged for my visit.<br />
I shall have an opportunity to see so much of Cambodia, both the spi endour<br />
of the past and the achievements of the present.<br />
I hope that my visit will be viewed by you as a gesture of<br />
goodwill designed to improve and strengthen the ties between us.<br />
Cambodia is one of Australia's close neighbours. Our people<br />
are becoming increasingly aware of each other. Both our countries are<br />
concerned in the welfare of this area of the world in which we live. We<br />
share, I am convinced, a common desire to contribute to the independence,<br />
stability, progress and prosperity of the peoples of South-East Asia and to<br />
the growth of friendly and co-operative relations within the region.<br />
Relations between Cambodia and Australia are close, cordial<br />
and co-operative. In the words of Cambodia's distinguished Head of State,<br />
Prince Norodom Sihanouk, they offer " an eloquent example of successful<br />
co-existence, not merely peaceful but friendly, between nations which have<br />
made different options in their external policies". The friendship between<br />
our two countries, which has grown steadily over the years, is firmly based<br />
on mutual confidence, understanding and respect.<br />
Australians see Cambodia as a singularly peaceful. united<br />
stable and happy country, intent on developing its own characteristic way.<br />
I would hope that Cambodians will increasingly regard<br />
Australia as a friend, sympathetic and willing to co-operate in furthering<br />
the aspirations for peaceful progress of the peoples of the South-East Asian<br />
region. It is my pleasure and honour to bring to the people of<br />
Cambodia the greetings and best wishes of the people of Australia.<br />
