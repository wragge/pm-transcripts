    <content><![CDATA[<p>E&amp;OE..........................................................................................................................</p>
<p>Well thank you very much Annette, to Mrs Joy Howley the President</p>
<p>   of the Victorian Division of the Liberal Party, Senator Alston,</p>
<p>   Senator Kemp, my other parliamentary colleagues, ladies and gentlemen.</p>
<p>Yesterday morning I took part in one of the most uplifting experiences</p>
<p>   that I have had since being Prime Minister. I visited a Year 10</p>
<p>   Government High School in Launceston - Brook High School - not in</p>
<p>   a particularly wealthy part of Australia and I launched what they</p>
<p>   call their "No Dole Programme" for 1998. And that programme</p>
<p>   is a partnership between the local community and the local school</p>
<p>   whereby the goal is that no student leaving that school should ever</p>
<p>   be on the dole. And so committed are they to that programme that</p>
<p>   at the end of the launch every Year 10 student signed a charter</p>
<p>   committing themselves to not being on the dole. And that charter</p>
<p>   was signed by the their parents and signed by leaders of the local</p>
<p>   business community, and I was very privileged to be invited to sign</p>
<p>   the charter myself. And I thought as I looked out on all of those</p>
<p>   young faces around the age of 15 and 16, many of them from struggling</p>
<p>   backgrounds, I thought to myself that the future of this country</p>
<p>   is really what the tax plan that I released last week is all about.</p>
<p>And when I have been asked by university students and school students</p>
<p>   over the last week what will the tax plan do for them, I have unhesitantly</p>
<p>   replied that because the tax plan will result in the costs of producing</p>
<p>   all goods and services falling quite dramatically once it is introduced</p>
<p>   that over time this tax plan, more than anything, will generate</p>
<p>   more jobs for young Australians. Because if there is one thing that</p>
<p>   I would like the public to see in this plan, above everything else,</p>
<p>   and above their own individual sectional interests - and they are</p>
<p>   understandable and I will deal with some of them - but what I would</p>
<p>   like them to see, above everything else, that this plan is a gutsy,</p>
<p>   fair, comprehensive attempt to fix a taxation system in the long-term</p>
<p>   interests of all Australians. It is not a plan for the business</p>
<p>   community. It's not a plan for Liberal voters. It's not</p>
<p>   a plan for one or other part of Australia. It is, above everything</p>
<p>   else, a plan for the long-term future of all Australians. And it</p>
<p>   is good for the long-term future of all Australians because its</p>
<p>   most dramatic quality is really it's most simple appeal and</p>
<p>   that is through the introduction of a Goods and Services Tax to</p>
<p>   replace 10 other taxes and thereby dramatically simplifying the</p>
<p>   tax system we will bring about a reduction of $10.5 thousand million</p>
<p>   a year in the costs of producing goods and services in Australia.</p>
<p>   And in that, one dramatic stroke we will do more to give an incentive</p>
<p>   to the business community, the wealth generators of Australia, than</p>
<p>   any other single deed that the Government could undertake. </p>
<p>In the years that I was Treasurer, in the years that I have been</p>
<p>   Prime Minister, I have often been asked by men and women in business:</p>
<p>   why don't you give this incentive to this activity; why don't</p>
<p>   you provide a subsidy over here; why don't you give us some</p>
<p>   encouragement through the taxation system to invest more and to</p>
<p>   export more? Well this plan will reduce export costs by $4.5 thousand</p>
<p>   million a year. I call it the greatest ever export market development</p>
<p>   grant that any government has ever devised for the Australian business</p>
<p>   community.</p>
<p>What it will do is to reduce the operating costs of every business</p>
<p>   because what a lot of people in business still don't realise,</p>
<p>   even those in manufacturing who say to me: oh well I am a manufacturer,</p>
<p>   I have exemptions in relation to my manufacturing inputs. That is</p>
<p>   true but there are a lot of things that you use to produce your</p>
<p>   goods and services for which you don't have exemptions, things</p>
<p>   like computers for example. Another feature of the package that</p>
<p>   people don't appreciate is that because we are applying the</p>
<p>   Goods and Services Tax to petrol and reducing the excise on petrol</p>
<p>   by a commensurate amount so that petrol will not increase at the</p>
<p>   pump in relation to any purchaser and because you will be able to</p>
<p>   get the GST back as a tax paid on a business input, then for every</p>
<p>   business man and woman petrol used in business will be seven cents</p>
<p>   a litre cheaper after the goods and services plan comes into operation.</p>
<p>So it is, above everything else, an aggregate plan. It did take</p>
<p>   a long time to put together and we addressed the fundamental weaknesses</p>
<p>   of the Australian taxation system. And deep down our political opponents</p>
<p>   know that what we are doing is right for Australia.</p>
<p>It's amazing what a political defeat does to liberate the</p>
<p>   mind and the political spirit. I heard Gary Johns on radio last</p>
<p>   night. Gary was a Minister in the Keating Government, he was the</p>
<p>   Special Minister of State and he was the Assistant Minister for</p>
<p>   Industrial Relations, and he lost a seat in Brisbane at the last</p>
<p>   Federal election. And he was asked what he thought of the plan and</p>
<p>   he said it was good for Australia. And he said he gave the Howard</p>
<p>   Government 100 per cent support and he knew that it was a plan that</p>
<p>   a future Labor Government would realise was good for Australia and</p>
<p>   that any honest, decent government would realise was good for Australia.</p>
<p>The truth is, my friends, is that everybody knows our present taxation</p>
<p>   system is limping towards near collapse, that our present taxation</p>
<p>   system is outdated. It inhibits our competitiveness. It is driving</p>
<p>   average wage and salary earners to paying the top marginal tax rate.</p>
<p>   It is in need of fundamental root and branch change.</p>
<p>But you can't just do one part of it, you have to do the entire</p>
<p>   job. It's no answer to just offer a tax cut. Anybody can do</p>
<p>   that, particularly a Labor Opposition that thinks it can use some</p>
<p>   of the surplus which it opposed the creation of after having left</p>
<p>   a deficit of $10.5 billion that they can help themselves to some</p>
<p>   of that surplus and in a lazy, slick way say: we'll give you</p>
<p>   a personal tax cut but we won't do anything about reforming</p>
<p>   the indirect tax system.</p>
<p>That happened in 1993. Mr Keating and Mr Beazley gave us a personal</p>
<p>   tax cut offer in 1993. They opposed the Goods and Services Tax.</p>
<p>   They won the election and immediately after the election they took</p>
<p>   away the personal tax cut and they increased every single indirect</p>
<p>   tax within the purview of the Commonwealth. And there was no compensation</p>
<p>   provided to nursing home residents for that increase, there was</p>
<p>   no compensation provided to the battlers or the pensioner to that</p>
<p>   particular increase.</p>
<p>There is, in reality, no tax relief without tax reform. If you</p>
<p>   want enduring tax relief you need to reform the whole system. Inevitably</p>
<p>   in the wake of the release of the tax plan the usual suspects have</p>
<p>   attacked the Government. Some of them out of political motivation,</p>
<p>   some of them out of genuine concern, and many of them misguided.</p>
<p>   And an attempt has been made by some of our critics in the media</p>
<p>   to present the view to represent the attitude that in some way the</p>
<p>   entire welfare sector and the churches of Australia are against</p>
<p>   the Government's plan.</p>
<p>Within a few hours of ACOSS making its statement you had sections</p>
<p>   of the media saying: once again, as in 1993, the churches are attacking</p>
<p>   the Government. And in that context I was very pleased, indeed,</p>
<p>   to see some perspective put into that part of the debate by His</p>
<p>   Grace the Catholic Archbishop of Melbourne, George Pell, quoted</p>
<p>   in The Australian this morning as saying that the tax package was</p>
<p>   complex and a serious attempt to address the problems of an ailing</p>
<p>   tax system. And he urged Catholics, and one could readily substitute</p>
<p>   Christians, to make an informed assessment. There is no one Catholic</p>
<p>   position on an issue as complex as taxation, he said. Tax reform</p>
<p>   is needed, the system is inequitable and my personal point is somehow</p>
<p>   the tax base has got to be broadened if we are going to have enough</p>
<p>   money to provide the welfare services that are needed in a modern,</p>
<p>   civilised society.</p>
<p>Now that doesn't sound to me like a denunciation by the senior</p>
<p>   Catholic prelate of this city against the Government's plan.</p>
<p>   I don't seek the sanction or the aid of any section of the</p>
<p>   Christian church or any other branch of religious belief in this</p>
<p>   country. I respect the fact that men and women of goodwill who have</p>
<p>   religious beliefs will take different views on this policy of the</p>
<p>   Government as they do on others.</p>
<p>But equally, I emphatically reject the attempt being made by some</p>
<p>   of our critics to represent the view that the plan that we have</p>
<p>   released is in some way in conflict with the doctrines of the Christian</p>
<p>   church or is in some way unfair to the poor and the underprivileged</p>
<p>   within our community. And I applaud the statement made by the Catholic</p>
<p>   Archbishop of Melbourne as bringing real balance back into the debate.</p>
<p>   He is not taking sides, he is speaking commonsense and he is saying</p>
<p>   the obvious thing: let the individual Australian make up his or</p>
<p>   her mind as to whether this is good for their country. Let no person</p>
<p>   under the cover of some position in a church or a welfare organisation</p>
<p>   invoke the name of that church or that welfare organisation to promote</p>
<p>   their own personal criticism of the Government's taxation proposals.</p>
<p>This plan, as Annette said in her introduction, also contains a</p>
<p>   quite historic attempt, which I hope will be successful to reform</p>
<p>   the balance of taxation between the Commonwealth and the States.</p>
<p>   For decades State Premiers have gone to Canberra, demanded more</p>
<p>   than they believed they've got and I won't go into any</p>
<p>   of the history of all of that. I have seen a lot of Premiers'</p>
<p>   conferences, both as Treasurer and as Prime Minister. They are always</p>
<p>   fascinating, they are usually predictable and they don't do</p>
<p>   enormous amount to raise the esteem of the political process in</p>
<p>   Australia. </p>
<p>And one of the real bonuses, can I say, as a veteran at Premiers'</p>
<p>   conferences in Australia since the late 1970s, one of the real bonuses</p>
<p>   of this tax plan is that there will be no more Premiers' conferences.</p>
<p>   And that will be very good for my health politically and physically.</p>
<p>   And the reason there won't be any need for Premiers' conferences</p>
<p>   is that we have recognised the need to change the present system.</p>
<p>   We have recognised the desirability of giving the States access</p>
<p>   to a growth tax and what we are going to do is to dedicate all of</p>
<p>   the revenue from the Goods and Services Tax to the States. We are</p>
<p>   going to say to them: you can get the entire proceeds of the revenue</p>
<p>   out of the Goods and Services Tax provided you abolish your financial</p>
<p>   institutions duty, your bank accounts debit tax, your bed taxes</p>
<p>   - those States that have them - your taxes on business conveyancing,</p>
<p>   your taxes on share transactions, bills of exchange, promissory</p>
<p>   notes, cheques and so forth.</p>
<p>And we will require, as part of the deal, that not only you abolish</p>
<p>   them, that they stay abolished and if you try and bring any of them</p>
<p>   back then the deal is off. And we'll go further, we will put</p>
<p>   a provision in the legislation providing that the level of the Goods</p>
<p>   and Services Tax can't be increased unless you have the unanimous</p>
<p>   support of the State Premiers, the Chief Ministers of the Territories,</p>
<p>   the Prime Minister and the two Houses of Parliament.</p>
<p>And can I let you into a secret - in 24 years of politics I can't</p>
<p>   remember a single occasion on which all of those, ladies and gentlemen,</p>
<p>   have agreed on an issue. And I can't think of a more fail-safe</p>
<p>   device and a more politically effective device than that particular</p>
<p>   way. And I really am very proud that part of this plan includes</p>
<p>   this historic turning of the tide that began in 1942 in the necessity</p>
<p>   of war when uniform taxation powers were assumed by the Commonwealth</p>
<p>   Government. And it will restore greater accountability at the State</p>
<p>   level and it will mean that the annual unedifying barneys'</p>
<p>   that go on between Commonwealth and State governments in Australia</p>
<p>   will substantially be a thing of the past.</p>
<p>I am sure I don't need to emphasise to an audience like this</p>
<p>   the importance of us communicating to those with whom we do business,</p>
<p>   to our friends and our family members, that what we are proposing</p>
<p>   here is not a 10 per cent tax on top of all existing levels of taxation.</p>
<p>   We are proposing, amongst other things, the introduction of a Goods</p>
<p>   and Services Tax to replace the Wholesale Sales Tax and nine or</p>
<p>   10 other taxes levied by State governments.</p>
<p>One of the most intriguing things about this debate is the degree</p>
<p>   of ignorance in the Australian community about the levels of hidden,</p>
<p>   indirect taxes on many everyday goods and services. I often take</p>
<p>   the opportunity in radio interviews of going through the list. The</p>
<p>   following items are taxed at 22 per cent: pet food, toothpaste,</p>
<p>   shampoo, soap and other soap powders, wheelbarrows, lawnmowers,</p>
<p>   ladders and garden equipment, children's toys, umbrellas, handbags</p>
<p>   and luggage. And at 32 per cent: clocks, watches, TV sets, video</p>
<p>   recorders. And at 12 per cent: Kettle chips, Cadbury family blocks,</p>
<p>   Peters Natural Ice-cream, Berri Orange Juice and Berri Cordial.</p>
<p>   And when I read that list out on the ABC this morning I was chipped</p>
<p>   about commercial promotions. </p>
<p>Now, it does all of us well to recite that list occasionally, it</p>
<p>   is a reminder of the absurdity and the stupidity of the present</p>
<p>   system. And it is also a reminder of how wrong it is to say that</p>
<p>   the result of this plan will be to increase the price of everything</p>
<p>   by 10 per cent. Because not only is it self-evident because of the</p>
<p>   disappearance of taxes on items like that that the price of many</p>
<p>   things will fall, it is also the case that everything you take or</p>
<p>   buy off a supermarket shelf has, as part of its costs, a contribution</p>
<p>   of about 20 per cent from transport costs. And that brings me to</p>
<p>   one of the most spectacular parts of the tax policy and that is</p>
<p>   the dramatic effect it will have on the cost of transport within</p>
<p>   Australia. </p>
<p>Geoffrey Blainey conjured a marvellous and evocative phrase when</p>
<p>   he spoke of the tyranny of distance and how it had shaped the attitude</p>
<p>   of Australians and the Australian national psyche. He had in mind</p>
<p>   not only the distance of Australia from Europe but he also had in</p>
<p>   mind the vast distances of the Australian continent. And our proposals</p>
<p>   will do more than any other single measure to reduce the costs of</p>
<p>   transporting goods over those vast distances.</p>
<p>We are proposing a reduction in the diesel fuel excise from 43</p>
<p>   cents a litre to 18 cents a litre for heavy trucks and for rail</p>
<p>   use. And we are extending the existing off-road exemption for the</p>
<p>   use of diesel fuel. And it will not only be of great benefit to</p>
<p>   primary producers but also of great benefit to many people in the</p>
<p>   tourist industry.</p>
<p>And that particular act alone is very, very important to the rural</p>
<p>   community of Australia and it is not surprising that the early indications</p>
<p>   are that this package has won very wide support within the Australian</p>
<p>   rural community. The bush likes it because it recognises one of</p>
<p>   the fundamental and legitimate complaints of people who live in</p>
<p>   country Australia and that is the high cost of the transportation</p>
<p>   of goods and services to them. </p>
<p>So, ladies and gentlemen, it is a package, it is a plan, it's</p>
<p>   a vision, it's a focus of hope and inspiration to all sections</p>
<p>   of the Australian community. It does contain a fundamental restructuring</p>
<p>   of a creaking old-fashioned system. It does contain very generous</p>
<p>   reductions in taxation at the personal level to the tune of $13</p>
<p>   billion. It offers the only honest response to Australia's</p>
<p>   taxation malaise. And that is taxation relief accompanied by taxation</p>
<p>   reform.</p>
<p>Our political opponents next week will offer the Australian community</p>
<p>   taxation relief but they won't offer taxation reform. You cannot</p>
<p>   have taxation reform in Australia that lasts and means anything</p>
<p>   unless you are prepared to fundamentally reform the indirect taxation</p>
<p>   system. Any other claim to reform is a complete mirage because it's</p>
<p>   the inadequacy of the indirect taxation system. It's old-fashioned,</p>
<p>   out-of-date character which is the single greatest weakness in the</p>
<p>   Australian taxation system.</p>
<p>And in the course of providing personal taxation relief, we have</p>
<p>   done two very, very important things. We have increased the benefits</p>
<p>   for Australian families at the levels of low and middle incomes.</p>
<p>   And very importantly we have introduced a top marginal rate of taxation</p>
<p>   for 81 per cent of all Australian taxpayers. Eighty one per cent</p>
<p>   of Australian taxpayers under this plan will pay a top marginal</p>
<p>   rate of 30 cents in the dollar or less. Under this plan, you will</p>
<p>   be able to move from $20,000 a year of personal income to $50,000</p>
<p>   a year without going into a higher tax bracket.</p>
<p>You could almost call that part of the plan the bracket creep abolition</p>
<p>   section of the plan. You can't have bracket creep if the rate's</p>
<p>   the same between $20,000 and $50,000. And let us understand that</p>
<p>   that is where the bulk of the Australian community lies. That is</p>
<p>   where the bulk of wage and salary earners are. And your capacity</p>
<p>   as men and women in business to offer those people your employees</p>
<p>   the opportunity of overtime without going into a higher tax bracket</p>
<p>   will represent an enormous change on the present system.</p>
<p>So my friends, it is a very broad plan, it's a very bold plan.</p>
<p>   I know there were a number of people in the community, they've</p>
<p>   certainly expressed their views to me over the months passed and</p>
<p>   they probably would have to you as well when they have said: it's</p>
<p>   too risky, it's too dangerous. Well, in the end you have a</p>
<p>   responsibility to put forward something that is good for the country.</p>
<p>I know in here that this is very good for Australia and that is</p>
<p>   it's most appealing feature. And I ask the Australian people</p>
<p>   to judge it on its aggregate value to the Australian community.</p>
<p>   Of course there will be men and women in this room who will think</p>
<p>   I don't like that part of it, I wish they had gone a big further</p>
<p>   over there, I wish they wouldn't be talking about something</p>
<p>   over here, and I am still angry about something they did in the</p>
<p>   first budget. Of course, that is human nature, but in the end as</p>
<p>   an Australian community we have got to ask ourselves whether this</p>
<p>   is good for the whole country.</p>
<p>We all know we need a new taxation system. We all know that sooner</p>
<p>   or later this country has got to have a broad-based indirect tax.</p>
<p>   I mean that's the fundamental reform that is needed. Mr Keating</p>
<p>   knew it in the mid 1980s and he was strongly supported then by the</p>
<p>   present Opposition Leader and the present Deputy Opposition Leader.</p>
<p>   Mr Hawke knew it when he was Prime Minister. John Hewson tried to</p>
<p>   do it with great courage in 1993 and he was beaten by a most villainous</p>
<p>   fear campaign. </p>
<p>Now, we can't allow that to happen again and we won't</p>
<p>   allow it to happen again. The Australian public will not be fooled</p>
<p>   again as they were in 1993 when they were promised tax cuts with</p>
<p>   no GST, they lost the tax cuts and they got the Labor version of</p>
<p>   a GST without any social security compensation.</p>
<p>Now that's the choice. You either have honest, upfront tax</p>
<p>   reform explained and put on the table before the election or you</p>
<p>   have a re-run of 1993 and that's the choice that I will be</p>
<p>   putting to the Australian people. I believe in this, I believe in</p>
<p>   it very passionately because I know it is good for our country and</p>
<p>   in the end I have enough faith in the Australian people to believe</p>
<p>   that that is the thing more than anything else that will determine</p>
<p>   whether or not they support it.</p>
<p>Thank you very much.</p>
