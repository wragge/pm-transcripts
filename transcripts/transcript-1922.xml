At the invitation of His Excellency the Right<br />
Honourable Lord Casey, G. C. M D. S. O M. C.,<br />
K St J Governor-General of Australia and the Lady Casey,<br />
His Excellency Park Chung Hee, President of the Republic<br />
of Korea and Madame Park arrived with their ( aughter,<br />
Miss Park Keun Hye, in Canberra on September 16, 1968, for<br />
a four day state visit to Australia. His Excellency the<br />

and Forestry, Mr. Hong Jong Chul, Minister of Culture and<br />
Information, Mr Park Joon Kyu, Chairman of the Foreign<br />
Affairs Committee, National Assembly and Mr. Lee Hu Rak,<br />
Secretary-General to the President and other high ranking<br />
officials of the Government of the Republic of Korea.<br />
2. During the visit, His Excellency the President<br />
of the Republic of Korea and Madame Park were received by<br />
His Excellency the Governor-General of Australia and the<br />
Lady Casey. The two heads of State exchanged views on<br />
matters of common interest. His Excellency the Governor-<br />
General presented to His Excellency the President ti e<br />
heads of diplomatic missions in Canberra.<br />
3 His Excellency President Park also met the Prime<br />
Minister of Australia, the Rt. Hon. J. G. Gorton, M. P.,<br />
and they had an exchange of views on matters of mutual<br />
interest and common concern in a most cordial atmosphere.<br />
His Excellency the President also had discussions with </p>
<p>Australian Cabinet Ministers. Korean Ministers who<br />
accompanied the President also had discussions with their<br />
Australian counterparts.<br />
4. Noting with satisfaction that the solid bonds of<br />
friendship traditionally existing between the two countries<br />
have been further strengthened in recent years through<br />
increased co-operation between the two countries in various<br />
fields political, economic, military, social, cultural<br />
the two Governments expressed their determination to<br />
continue to co-operate fully with each other in the pursuit<br />
of their common objectives of a secure and lasting peace<br />
based on freedom, justice and prosperity.<br />
In reviewing the current situation of the world,<br />
particular attention was paid to recent developments in<br />
Asia and the Pacific. Problems arising out of developments<br />
on the Chinese Mainland were discussed and it was<br />
agreed that the situation was uncertain and should be<br />
closely followed.<br />
6. In describing the situation in Korea President<br />
Park informed Prime Minister Gorton of the two-phase<br />
efforts the Government and people of the Republic of<br />
Korea are making to defend their nation and to continue<br />
the rapid development of the national economy.<br />
7. The Australian Government noted with serious<br />
concern the infiltration of north Korean armed agents<br />
into the Republic of Korea, including the raid directed by<br />
31 armed agents upon the official residence of the </p>
<p>President. It was agreed that such acts of aggression<br />
directly threaten the peace and security of the Korean<br />
peninsula and the area surrounding it. Recalling that it<br />
was a party to the declaration of 1953 by which the<br />
sixteen powers which had participated in the Korean War<br />
had affirmed that if there was a renewal of armed attack<br />
challenging again the principles of the United Nations<br />
they would again be united and prompt to resist, the<br />
Australian Government also affirms its support for the<br />
Republic of Korea in its efforts to develop and strengthen<br />
its national economy and ensure the prosperity of the<br />
Korean people.<br />
8. Taking note of the strong aspirations of the<br />
Korean people for their national re-unification, the<br />
Australian Government re-affirmed its support for the<br />
United Nations objective to bring about by peaceful means<br />
the establishment of a unified, independent and democratic<br />
Korea under a representative form of government. The<br />
President expressed his appreciation of Australia's<br />
continued work as a member of the United Nations Commission<br />
for the Unification and Rehabilitation of Korea.<br />
9. It was agreed that both countries should<br />
continue to maintain the close accord already established<br />
in all appropriate international organisations and<br />
conferences. The continued constitutional progress in the<br />
Republic of Viet-Nam and the progress being achieved in </p>
<p>social and economic fields were noted with particular<br />
satisfaction. It was agreed that this progress was all<br />
the more notable for having taken place while the war<br />
continued and the people of the Republic of Viet-Nam<br />
were subjected to systematic terror and violence. The<br />
determination of the two countries to play their part in<br />
close consultation with their allies in assisting the<br />
people and Government of the Republic of Viet-Nam to<br />
defend themselves until a just and honourable peace is<br />
attained was re-affirmed.<br />
11. Discussions were also held on the present talks<br />
in Paris between the representatives of the United States<br />
and North Viet-Nam. It was regretted that the talks have<br />
so far failed to make progress and that the North Vietnamese<br />
continued to maintain an inflexible position. It was<br />
hoped, nevertheless, that the meetings would lead to<br />
substantive talks, in which the Republic of Viet-Nam<br />
would naturally play a leading part. It was also agreed<br />
that all the other allied countries should participate<br />
in any settlement of the conflict.<br />
12. The spirit of the Manila Summit Conference of<br />
October 1966 and the commitment embodied in its joint<br />
communique and in the joint communiques issued at<br />
subsequent meetings of the allies were also re-affirmed.<br />
In this regard it was agreed that continued close<br />
consultation between their Governments through diplomatic<br />
channels should be maintained. </p>
<p>13. Particular satisfaction was expressed at the fact<br />
that the co-operative system among the free nations in the<br />
Asian and Pacific region established within the framework<br />
of ASPAC had served to strengthen the sense of common<br />
destiny and bonds of solidarity among nations in the region.<br />
With reference to the Third Ministerial Meeting of ASPAC<br />
which was held in Canberra in July/ August, particular<br />
satisfaction was expressed that the inaugural meeting was<br />
recently held in Seoul of the Executive Board of the<br />
Cultural and Social Centre established under ASPAC.<br />
14. President Park valued highly the significant role<br />
that Australia has been playing in the common efforts of<br />
nations of the region to promote co-operation in economic,<br />
technical, cultural and social fields and to maintain<br />
peace and security in the region.<br />
The greatest importance was attached to economic<br />
development and trade expansion in order to improve living<br />
standards and human welfare of the nations of the region.<br />
The progress already achieved by ECAFE, the Asian Development<br />
Bank and similar Asian regional organisations in<br />
promoting co-operation between countries in the area was<br />
welcomed and the two Governments agreed to continue their<br />
support for the work of these bodies. In this connexion<br />
they noted that the Korean Government would host the 19th<br />
Meeting of the Colombo Plan Consultative Committee in<br />
Seoul in October.<br />
16. Particular importance was attached to close<br />
economic co-operation between the two countries. It was </p>
<p>agreed that both Governments would see value in the<br />
exploration of the possibility of commercial joint ventures<br />
between Korean and Australian concerns, so as to serve<br />
the interests of both countries, in such fields for example<br />
as the development of the live stock industry in Korea,<br />
of forest resources in Papua and New Guinea, and fisheries<br />
in the waters off Papua and New Guinea. It was also agreed<br />
that the development of air services would be desirable<br />
between the Republic of Korea and Australia by their<br />
respective national airlines when this proved to be<br />
practicable. 17. It was noted that the Trade Agreement between the<br />
two countries was operating smoothly and it was agreed<br />
that trade promotion talks should be held in the near<br />
future in order to discuss ways and means of further<br />
expanding trade between the two countries. In particular<br />
both Govenments agreed to encourage exchanges of visits<br />
by businessmen between the two countries recognizing<br />
that mutual trade can best be fostered by such closer<br />
business contact.<br />
18. Considering that the friendly relations and cooperation<br />
between the two countries have been greatly<br />
enhanced by exchanges in technical and cultural fields,<br />
it was agreed to conclude an agreement for cultural and<br />
technical co-operation between the two countries as soon<br />
as practicable. The Australian Government undertook to<br />
examine the possibility of providing a measure of technical<br />
assistance in connection with the Korean Government's<br />
programme for the development of the live stock industry. </p>
<p>19. President Park was deeply impressed by the<br />
remarkable accomplishments of the Government and people<br />
of Australia, and by their vitality, freedom and resourcefulness.<br />
He expressed his personal admiration for the<br />
courage and wisdom shown by the Australian people throughout<br />
their history in dedication to the common ideals of<br />
peace, justice and democracy. Recalling the sacrifices<br />
the armed forces of Australia made to help defend freedom<br />
in Korea during the Korean War, President Park conveyed the<br />
sincere gratitude of the Korean people to the people of<br />
Australia for their contribution.<br />
The Australian Government expressed its admiration<br />
for the wisdom and courage with which the Government<br />
and people of the Republic of Korea had successfully completed<br />
their first five-year economic development plan, thus<br />
attaining rapid economic development, and noted further<br />
with satisfaction that the current second five-year<br />
economic development plan was also being efficiently<br />
executed. 21. Deep sympathy was expressed at the drought<br />
suffered by the people of Korea in the past two seasons<br />
and the Australian Government informed the President that<br />
in addition to the aid already being provided by Australia<br />
to the Republic of Korea under the Colombo Plan a gift<br />
of 10,000 metric tons of wheat would be made this year.<br />
President Park indicated on behalf of the Korean Government<br />
and people his deep appreciation of this gift and of other<br />
aid being provided by Australia. </p>
<p>22. President Park stated that his Government<br />
extended its cordial invitation to Prime Minister Gorton<br />
to visit the Republic of Korea at a date to be mutually<br />
agreed and Prime Minister Gorton accepted the invitation<br />
with pleasure.<br />
23. President Park expressed his deep appreciation to<br />
the Government and people of Australia for the warm welcome<br />
and cordial reception they extended to President and Madame<br />
Park and his suite during the visit.<br />
