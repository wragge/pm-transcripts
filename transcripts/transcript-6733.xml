PRIME MINISTER<br />
EMBARGOED AGAINST DELIVERY CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY<br />
PRIME MINISTER'S RESPONSE TO THE MAYORAL WELCOME<br />
AT THE CITY OF BATHURST,<br />
21 SEPTEMBER 1985<br />
Mr Mayor, Distinguished Guests, my colleague, David<br />
Simmons, M-ember for Calare, Ladies and Gentlemen.<br />
I thank you for your welcoming comments Mr Mayor. I am<br />
most pleased to be here in Australia's oldest inland<br />
city ( founded in 1815) for the celebrations of the Ben<br />
Chifley Centenary. It is indeed a great day.<br />
Ben Chifley needs no introduction to you. He was a<br />
great Prime Minister. He was a great Prime Minister<br />
who loved this country, and his roots lie here in<br />
Bathurst a town which he loved, admired and worked<br />
for during his career in private and public office.<br />
It is with deep pride I am able to say that the warm<br />
welcome I have received today as a Labor Prime Minister<br />
stems from the memories that many of your townsfolk<br />
have of Ben Chifley, particularly when he was Prime<br />
Minister. Ben Chifley, as you all know, was a great Australian<br />
Prime Minister. He lived for politics. He was a deep,<br />
empirical and reflective man who understood the<br />
significance of leading Australia at a time of crisis<br />
in our country.<br />
Ben Chifley, was first and last a Bathurst man and felt<br />
himself to be a citizen of no mean city. His father<br />
was born here before him and he himself knew no home<br />
outside the Bathurst district. " No Chifley," he used<br />
to say, " ever left Bathurst, except feet first."<br />
Though he died in Canberra he was flown home for burial<br />
amongst him family and townsfolk. </p>
<p>2.<br />
Bathurst was the lifelong background of his career, as<br />
it was the constant focus of his heart. He would often<br />
say, " I was a child of the pavements, a boy from the<br />
bush." He was interested in your history, refreshed by<br />
its beauty amongst the rolling plains and proud and<br />
solicitous of your civic progress. He would also be<br />
proud today to know that a nephew, John Chifley, is a<br />
member of your local council.<br />
In closing" may I say how wonderful it is to be away<br />
from Canberra andtremendous to be hear in Bathurst. I<br />
only wish I could . make these sorts of trips on more and<br />
more occasions. Thank you for your hospitality and I<br />
congratulate you Shn your organisation for this<br />
celebration. I wish you and your great city well today<br />
and into the future. </p>
