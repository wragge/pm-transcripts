FOR MEDIA Gift Horse for Her Majesty Queen-Elizabeth II<br />
The Prime Minister said today that while The Queen was<br />
in Canberra the Australian-bred racehorse, which was the<br />
Australian people's gift to Her Majesty to commemorate the<br />
anniversary of her reign and her Silver Jubilee visit to<br />
Australia, . would be handed over.<br />
In 1977, the year of the Silver Jubilee, it was<br />
announced that a racehorse would be bred here and, when ready<br />
for a racing career, would be sent to The Queen to race in<br />
Britain. The Lindsay Park Stud in South Australia was given the<br />
task of breeding a number of highly credentialled foals to the<br />
sire '; ithout Fear" and with selecting a filly to be the<br />
Australian Silver Jubilee gift. As a result, a bay filly from<br />
the dam " Chulgin Princess" has been selected. It is aged two<br />
years and three months and has been bred to the northern<br />
hemisphere racing calendar so that it can race in Europe this<br />
year as a two year old. The filly will be flown to Britain<br />
later this month.<br />
Her Majesty has expressed an interest in seeing the<br />
filly before it leaves for Britain and arrangements have been<br />
made for it to be. formLally handed over at Government House,<br />
Canberra on Monday 26 May.<br />
The Prime Minister said also that the Government was<br />
greatly indebted to the Managing Director of Lindsay Park Stud<br />
Pty Ltd, M~ r Colin Hayes, for the care and attention that he had<br />
given to this project. Colin Hayes is known in Australia as an<br />
outstanding breeder of racehorses. The filly selected, apart<br />
from its outstanding pedigree, is in first-class condition. </p>
<p>Background Note<br />
The filly is a bay aged two years three months and<br />
. has been bred to the northern he;~ sphere racing calendar, so<br />
that it can race in Europe this year as a two year old. Its.<br />
sire is the leading sire " Without Fear" and its dam is " Chulgin<br />
Princess". The pedigrees of both parents are quite outstanding<br />
and will be well known in European racing circles. The<br />
pedigrees include such notable horses as Baldric II, Round<br />
Table, Princequillo and Nasrullah on the sire's. side, and on<br />
the dam's side, Ribot, Ruantallan, Star Kingdom and Wilkes.<br />
Of the foals specially bred for this project, this<br />
. particular filly proved to be the most outstanding athlete<br />
and the most likely to succeed as a racehorse. After her<br />
racing career is over she could become a highly rated brood<br />
mare. It is expected the filly will be flown to Britain at<br />
the end of May. As yet, the.. filly -is un-named but her pedigree<br />
has been given to The Queen who will choose a name for<br />
registration in the British Stud Book. </p>
