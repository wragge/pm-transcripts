The following is the text of a message<br />
sent from London by the Prime Minister to Mr J. H. Nelson,<br />

Mr HI. Brennan, Mayor of Darwin:<br />
" I am horrified by the appalling loss of life<br />
and the destruction that have befallen Darwin on Christmas<br />
day. The only city on Australian soil to suffer<br />
ex: tensive , daiiage froL,. enemy action in -, ar is now the ocene<br />
of one of our worst natural disasters.<br />
I am in touch with my Ministers and officials<br />
concerning relief measures and have directed that notling<br />
be spared to bring aid to the homeless and afflicted.<br />
The full resources of the new disaster relief<br />
organisation which the government established this year<br />
will be at the disposal of the local authorities and people<br />
of Darwin. Do not hesitate to request whatever assistance<br />
may be needed. On behalf of the government I pledge a detc-rined<br />
and unrem itting effort to rebuild your city and relieve<br />
suffering. Please convey to the people of Darwin my own profound<br />
sense of shock . at this grievous and unseasonal calamity, and<br />
my heartfelt personal sympathy to all the victims.<br />
E. G. Whitlam."<br />
