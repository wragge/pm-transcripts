FOR PRESS: PMI No. 3/ 1971<br />
COMMWONWEALTH PRIME MINISTERS' CONFERENCE<br />
Statemen~ y the Prime Minister of Australia,. Mr. John Gorton<br />
It is significant that the first Commonwealth Heads of Government Conference<br />
of the seventies is taking place in South-East Asia.<br />
As the first Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Meeting ever held in this part<br />
of the world, it should lead to a better understanding of the problems and aspirationis<br />
of those Commonwealth members who live in the Asian and Pacific regions.<br />
It is also appropriate that the Leaders of the Commonwealth a multi-racial<br />
organisation whose members have inherited democratic traditions should meet iz<br />
Singapore, a country which has made a sustained and admirable effort to build a<br />
multi-racial, democratic society.<br />
This meeting is being held in the centre of the area in which A.'. stralia is<br />
situated; the area in which we are seeking to play a constructive role directed<br />
towards the evolution of a peaceful, progressive and stable Asian region in which<br />
we desire to play a co-operative part.<br />
I hope that this Asian setting will give an Asian focus to this meetii--, g and<br />
enable us to have full and useful discussions of the complex and important situation<br />
in this part of the world. The continuing search for a just and durable peace in<br />
Vietnam, which will permit the people of the South to determine in peace their ovin<br />
form of government, and the related quest for security from communist aggressio-n<br />
in Cambodia and Laos are among the Asian issues which the meeting might usefully<br />
consider. I hope also that this meeting will cover a wide range of matters of importance<br />
and not becomre too involved in any particular issue. Naturally, Aocian countries<br />
tend to be preoccupied with Asian problems, African countries with African problems,<br />
and the countries of the Caribbean with Caribbean problems. This is natural. But<br />
I hope too that we can also deal with the broad political issues of the day, which<br />
affect us all, such as the quest for security and stability.<br />
While Heads of Commonwealth Governments will be meeting at a time when the<br />
Commonwealth is under some strain, it has proved a flexible and durable organization<br />
and I hope its cohesion can be preserved. a / 2 </p>

This is the second Conwmowealth Heads of Government Meeting I have attended.<br />
Successive Australian Governments have attached importance to the Commonwealth.<br />
So does my Government.<br />
Naturally, we see the development in the Asian arid Pacific region of a peaceful<br />
community of stable, developing nations as an objective of p1rimary importance for us.<br />
But we take a wider view. The Commonwealth provides a forum for wide-ranging and<br />
valuable contacts with other leaders.<br />
We see the Commonwealth as a free, multi-racial association of 32 countries<br />
representing about one quarter of the world's population; a forum with a common<br />
language, larger than it was but still more intimate and manageable in size than the<br />
United Nations and more broadly based than regional organisations. We see a<br />
continuing value in such an association exchanging ideas and discussing problems<br />
of common interest without intruding into each other's domestic policies, or seeking<br />
to dictate courses of action to any member.<br />
SINGAPORE 12 January 1971<br />
( This statement is released in Singapore to coincide<br />
with the arrival of the Australian Prime Minicter). </p>
