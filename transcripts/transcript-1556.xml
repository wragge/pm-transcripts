HOLT OF THE COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA 9TH APRIL, 1967<br />
At the invitation of His Excellency 11 Kwon Chung. Prime<br />
Minister of the Republic of Korea, the Right Honourable Harold Holt,<br />
Prime Minister of the Commonwealth of Australia paid an official visit<br />
to the Republic of Korea from 6th to 9th April, 1967.<br />
Prime Minister Holt was accompanied by Mrs. Holt, Sir<br />
Laurence Mclnture, Deputy Secretary of the Department of Ext ernal<br />
Affairs, Mr. D. J, Munro, First Assistant Secretary of the Prime Minister's<br />
Department and other officials of the Australian Government.<br />
During the visit, Prime Minister Holt had a highly profitable<br />
exchange of views with His Excellency President Park Chung Hee of the<br />
RepuliIc of Korea, and he and the Prime Minister of the Republic of Korea<br />
had a series of frank discussions on matters of common concern In a most<br />
cordial atmosphere. The two Prime Ministers noted with satisfaction that the<br />
friendly relations existing between their countries have recently been<br />
further strengthoned through Increased co-operation In their common<br />
Interest and through joint endeavours for the security and prosperity of<br />
the Asian and Pacific region.<br />
Prime Minister Chung, recalling with gratitude the part<br />
played by the Australian Armed Forces in the Korean war, stated that the<br />
visit of Prime Minister Holt to Korea at such a time had a special<br />
significance and marked a milestone in the history of Korean-Australian<br />
relations. The two Prime Ministers gave particular attention to recent<br />
developments in the Asian and Pacific region. They noted that the united<br />
strength of the free nations in the region has been effectively containing<br />
the further expansion of the aggressive forces of communism.<br />
In the course of their deliberations, the two Prime Ministers<br />
reviewed in detail the latest developments In Viet Nam in the military<br />
as well as the political, economic and social fields and discussed ways<br />
and means of promoting co-operation between their two countries In<br />
achieving their common goals of restoring peace and safeguarding freedom<br />
In Viet Nam. They were firmly resolved to do all in their power to<br />
prevent the conflict In Viet Nam from spreading to the rest of the region<br />
and from affecting other regions of the world as well.<br />
They expressed their satisfaction over the more favourable<br />
military situation recently achieved in Viet Nam through the determination<br />
and sacrifices of the Vietnamese people and the joint efforts of their<br />
allies as well as the successful implementation of various programmes of<br />
pacification and social development. e* </p>

They reaffirmed the resolve of both countries as proclaimed<br />
at the Manila Summit Conference in October, 1966, to continue their<br />
military and other efforts until the communists realise that their aggressive<br />
schemes and actions would not be rewarded and consequently stop their<br />
aggression. The two Prime Ministers agreed that continuing efforts should be<br />
made in search of peace in Viet Nam. They agreed that such a peace must<br />
guarantee the cessation of acts of aggression by the communists and uphold<br />
and respect the independence of the Republic of Viet Nam and the right of<br />
the Vietnamese people to choose their own way of life.<br />
The two Prime Ministers further agreed that a settlement in Viet<br />
Nam, to be enduring, must respect the wishes and aspirations of the<br />
Vietnamese Government and people, that the Vietnamese Government should<br />
be a full participant in any negotiations designed to bring about a settlement<br />
of the conflict and that the nations which have contributed to the defence<br />
of the Republic of Viet Nam should participate in any future settlenti of the<br />
conflict. The two Prime Ministers, recognising the valuable achievements<br />
of the Manila Summwit Conference and the Asian and Pacific Council, stressed<br />
the historic significance of the growth of regional solidarity among the free<br />
nations in the region, including their two countries, as convincing signs of<br />
a brighter and more prosperous future for the region as a whole. They<br />
shared the view that the foundation of a new community in the Pacific has<br />
thus been laid by the countries in the region, and that such a community<br />
should continue to be developed through mutual co-operation of the regiona.<br />
countries working together as equal partners.<br />
They reiterated that their common purpose is to defend the<br />
region from external aggression, maintain peace and order and develop<br />
the region in accordance with the aims envisaged in the goals of freedom<br />
adopted in Manila on October 25, 1966. To this end they agreed to further<br />
the development of adequate machinery for consultation and co-operation.<br />
Prime Minister 11 Kwon Chung, on behalf of the Government and<br />
people of the Republic of Kcrea, expressed deep appreciation for the<br />
valuable support which Australia, a member of the United Nations Commission<br />
for Unification and Rehabilitation of Korea, has rendered to the<br />
position of the Republic of Korea at the United Nations.<br />
Prime Minister Holt, in response, stated that his Government<br />
would continue to uphold the principles which have been repeatedly<br />
reaffirmed at the United Nations with regard iD the unification of Korea.<br />
The two Prime Ministers reviewed trade relations existing<br />
between the two countries and discussed ways and means to promote<br />
mutual trade. Prime Minister Holt welcomed Korea's admission to the<br />
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and hoped that trade between<br />
the two countries would be further stimulated through the framework of<br />
the agreement. The two Prime Miniiste~ rs agreed that further discussions should<br />
be held between represebativez u the two Governments with the object of<br />
promoting trade between the two countries. / 3 </p>

Prime Minister Chung expressed appreciation for the co-operation<br />
rendered thus far by Australia in the economic field, mainly through the<br />
Colombo Plan.<br />
The Australian Prime Minister undertook to examine ways in<br />
which this co-operation might be extended, including the possibility of<br />
providing additional training facilities in Australia for Korean technicians.<br />
Prime Minister Holt expressed his profound thanks to the<br />
Government and people of the Republic of Korea for the great friendliness<br />
and the warm hospitality extended to him and his party from the moment<br />
of their arrival in Seoul. </p>
