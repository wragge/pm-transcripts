PRIME MINISTER.' S ADDRESS AT A FUND-RAISING LUNCH, 0<br />
ALICE SPRINGS, 1 NOVEMBER 1975<br />
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, thank you<br />
very much indeed for the organisation you've put into the<br />
events of today. It was a great meeting in the park this<br />
morning and this is a magnificent gathering for lunch now.<br />
And I'm most heartened at the reception you gave the newest<br />
minister, the youngest minister, in the Australian Government.<br />
Only 31 years old, he's been in the Parliament less than<br />
six years; I can assure you there is very great com~ petition<br />
to get into the ministry. But you've been able to hear and<br />
see the quality of the man, who less than six years in the<br />
Parliament, barely 31 years of age, is able to win a ballot,<br />
a secret ballot, among very tough competition. And I can<br />
assure you, in giving you, as your new Minister for Northern<br />
Australia, a man of this capacity, this drive, this capacity<br />
to comprehend and convey the big things, the big opportunities,<br />
to approach, and we trust, solve the big problems of this<br />
immense area of our continent, we've made a very good decision<br />
indeed. And I thank you for the reception you gave him;<br />
he deserves it; he'll need a lot of support, and I know the<br />
Labor people of this Territory, and indeed all, the people<br />
who are here in this Territory to develop it, to produce<br />
a good community in this Territory, will give him their support.<br />
Now ladie~ s and gentlemen I spoke earlier in the<br />
park'and so I needn't go over all the things I said then.<br />
There is one particular thing that is rousing people from one<br />
end of Australia to another. And this is the fact that for<br />
the first time in the seventy-five years that we've had a<br />
nation, and a national Parliament, the Senate has taken it on<br />
itself, to block the Budget. It's true that in April last year<br />
they moved a motion to defer the Supply Bills and in those<br />
circumstances, I advised the Governor-General to dissolve both<br />
Houses, to have a double dissolution of the Parliament.<br />
There were a great number of things which needed to be solved,<br />
and one of the thin~ gs which needed to be solved were some of<br />
the-Electoral -Bills, including the bills which were to give you<br />
representation in the Senate this you remember was in the<br />
policy speech in 1972, it was in the policy speech in 1969 as<br />
well. And in Opposition we had brought in bills to give<br />
the representation and vote to people in the Senate from the<br />
Territories. This has been a very long-standing platform of<br />
the Labor Party and I've put it on the Labor Party's behalf<br />
at many elections, and our opponents never objected, never.<br />
Sure, they stalled it when we brought the bills in in Opposition;<br />
but never during a campaign did they ever say, least of all<br />
of course, in the Northern Territory where there was a member<br />
for the House of Representatives, that they objected to you<br />
having members in the Senate. They never said it.<br />
Well, there were six bills in April last year which they had<br />
twice rejected in the Senate, and this was one of them<br />
Medibank was another, other electoral ones were also involved.<br />
So we thought, right, we'll settle it, we'll have, dissolve<br />
both Houses, we'll start off with a clean Parliament. And<br />
at that timie, -they said, we said, that we were seeking to have<br />
the opportunity of governing Australia for three years. They<br />
lost; they made a grievous mistake; we won; we got a comfortable<br />
majority in the House of Representatives; we got as many </p>
<p>Senators as they got in the whole Parliament we obviously<br />
had the majority. That is, the majority of the members of<br />
Parliament; but of course, in the community as a whole, we<br />
had a very large majority of the votes. In the House of<br />
Representatives I think we got half a million more votes than<br />
all our competitors in the Parliament combined, that is~ the<br />
representatives of the Parties in the Parliament. And in the<br />
House of Representatives we got 165,000 more votes for the<br />
Labor candidates, in the Senate, than were cast for the<br />
candidates of all the other Parties that are represented in<br />
the Senate So by every basis, every test every criteria,<br />
we -ought to have been able to govern uninterrupted for<br />
three years.. But our opponents who courted that election, who<br />
lost that election, haven't seen fit to abide by the verdict.<br />
of the people. And they're up to the same game again.<br />
Once again they've passed the motion to put off a vote on<br />
R~ loney Bills, on the Budget itself. And three times now<br />
they have carried a motion to defer debate on three of the<br />
Budget Eills the Loan Bills and the two Appropriation Billsthree<br />
times they've done this for each of the three bills.<br />
And this time I'm not going to buckle under because if I did,<br />
not only would I, not only would this Government, but any<br />
future Prime Minister, any Government that the people elect,<br />
would have the same threat hanging over them. And the<br />
threat would be made twice a year, because every October<br />
you have to pass the Budget. Bills to pay for the business<br />
of Government for the whole of the financial year from<br />
the first of July previous, to the thirtieth of June following.<br />
And every April you pass the Supply Bills to make provisional<br />
appropriation for the next financial year, from the first<br />
of July to the thirtieth of November, until the Budget in<br />
turn is passed for the whole of that financial year. Twice<br />
a year money Bills come up and if the Senate rejects those<br />
bills and is thereby able to produce an election for the<br />
House of Representatives.. no Government can carry out any<br />
programs it would have to govern for a faw months ahead<br />
alone. And the wicked part of it is that the Senate could,<br />
usually, avoid going to the people itself. Because most of<br />
the people in the Senate are safe as long as their IpArties<br />
endorse them they're safe from the wrath of the electoratebecause<br />
the number 1 and 2 on the Liberal and Country Party<br />
tickets, the number 1 and 2 on the Labor Party ticket<br />
in each of the six States is certain to get back it's only<br />
the fifth person that there's any battle over whether it's<br />
to be Labor or whether it's to be Liberal and Country Party.<br />
There's onlyone-fifth of the Senators who are in any jeopardy<br />
when there's an election for the Senate. But on most of these<br />
occasions there wouldn't be an election for the Senate at all.<br />
You can only have an election for the Senate in two circumstances:<br />
one is when half the Senate is about to come to an end at the<br />
end of the following June you can have an election for that<br />
half of the Senate at any time during the previous twelve monthsthat<br />
is, half the Senators well there've been a couple who've<br />
left the Senate and so 28 of the Senators who are there now,<br />
will be replaced or confirmed some time in this financial year,<br />
and they'll take their places or people will take their~ places<br />
on the. 1July next. </p>
<p>3.<br />
But at the present moment there are very<br />
special circumstances. When there is an election for the<br />
Senate or for the House of Representatives then for the<br />
first time there will also be two Senators elected from<br />
each of the mainland Territories and there will also be<br />
a choice by the people to, for enators to replace the two<br />
former Labor Senators whom the New South Wales and<br />
Queensland Premiers had replaced with anti-Labor or<br />
non-Labor people that is the successors for Murphy and<br />
Milliner would take office f rom the day the result of the<br />
election for the Senate was declared. So as soon as there's<br />
half a Senate election, which can take place any time<br />
in this financial year.. and the election is usually held<br />
in November or December,. then on this occasion the new<br />
Senators will take office, not from the 1 July only, but<br />
there will be six who will take office from the time the<br />
election result is declared. So that's one circumstance<br />
in which you can have an election for the Senate.<br />
And the other circumstance in which you can have<br />
an election for the Senate is where there is a Bill, or more<br />
than one Bill which has been twice rejected by the Senate.<br />
Now that is the situation now as it was the situation, of course,<br />
in the first half of last year when we had the double dissolution.<br />
But if there is not half a Senate coming up, or if there has<br />
not been a double rejection of any Bill by the Senate, then<br />
there can't be an election for the Senate. And in those<br />
circumstances-and these were the circumstances for the first<br />
seven monqths that we were in Government, and they again were<br />
the circumstances for the first seven months after we were<br />
re-elected in May last year,.. then they can cut off the Budget,<br />
they can cut off Supply and, they believe, can then bring<br />
about an election for the House of Representatives without<br />
having to face the people themselves. Now this is an end<br />
to stable government in this country.<br />
I've been astonished and gratified by the number of<br />
migrantswno come to our meetings. And one of the r'easons, IVmconvinced,<br />
why they come to our meetings on this issue, is<br />
that they have so often come from countries where democracy<br />
ha3 been destroyed or where.' it is very fragile or where it<br />
is under challenge. And they thought that Australia, an<br />
independent pioneering country,. but nevertheless a country<br />
which was the heir to British parliamentary traditions, at<br />
least was a country where people could change the Government<br />
at the ballot box, where there could be a peaceful transfer<br />
of power if the people saw fit, from a Government to an<br />
Opposition. And then if the opposition became the Government<br />
it had a fair go, it had three years in which to justify<br />
itself. And then if it couldn't, it would then go back<br />
into Opposition and the previous Government would come back.<br />
At least they thought that in our democracy it was possible to<br />
change governments peacefully and by your private decision<br />
at the ballot box and then the government you chose could<br />
govern.-I am determined to see that governments which are<br />
elected by the Australian people are allowed to govern. I will not </p>
<p>have an election for the House of Representatives or the<br />
Senate or both until the Budget is passed. And that's<br />
to be quite clear.<br />
I've never had any doubt as to the result of<br />
an election between the Liberal-Country Parties on one<br />
hand and Labor on the other. When it camne to an election,<br />
when people had a choice, where they saw the alternatives,<br />
where they saw us for better or for worse, and where<br />
they had to size up our opponents for better or for-worse,<br />
they once again would choose us. I believe the remarkable<br />
thing of the last three weeks has been the perception by the<br />
public of the type of man Mr Fraser is. They've seen him<br />
to be impatient and greedy, because he's not the sort of<br />
person that knows what the Australian people want in the<br />
cities or the outback Sure, he represents what's<br />
called a country electorate. But if you go to that country<br />
electorate which he represents ) you will see that it is<br />
a long-settled, very serene sort of place. -That is, it's<br />
not bursting with vitality' it is not a pioneering outback<br />
electorate; it hasn't got the new resources which<br />
Australians want to develop for themselves; it's an<br />
old-fashioned electorate.-good people undoubtedly, but<br />
not the sort of people that have to face the problems which<br />
now have to be faced in the cities and in the outback.<br />
He's not in touch with the Australian people and the people<br />
to whom he turns for advice are newspaper proprietors<br />
including the exp;. triate -proprietor who owns your papers<br />
in the'Territory I don't know how Rupert Murdoch II<br />
remains on the electoral rolls or remainis as the owner of<br />
television or radio stations because you're supposed to be<br />
Australian residents if your to be on the rolls or if your ' re<br />
to own the electronic media and he's not an Australian<br />
resident. Nevertheless. the other-people that back him are the<br />
Country Party, and the Country Party are the most selfish<br />
people in Australia no question about it. And it was the<br />
Country Party, as well as the Liberals, who didn't want you<br />
to have votes in the Northern Territory. They thought you<br />
would upset their apple-cart and if you go for your<br />
advice, if you seek the views'of newspaper proprietors and<br />
Country Party leaders you'll go wrong, and that's what Mr<br />
Snedden did, and he went wrong, and he went bad, and this is<br />
what Mr Fraser has done as well. I've always thought he'd<br />
betray himself this way he's done the wrong thing, and he's<br />
been found out and the people have noticed it. Now I've<br />
always been certain that if we have an election campaign and<br />
they have to give up just relying on our sins and try to<br />
project some virtues of their own, they'd flop, and they willwhenever<br />
I call the election. But the big thing is that I've<br />
got to ensure that whatever the Government is . the people choose,<br />
is able to govern. -It was a great shock to the conservative<br />
system when we were elected in December 1972. Th * ey felt<br />
that we were usurpers we were trespassers, and they are<br />
doing their very best to see that the people' s will, twice<br />
expressed ) is frustrated. They've wanted to keep us off balance,<br />
or to get us off balance they're not going to. Because<br />
we are fighting for a proper principle that if the People </p>
<p>choose a Government,. that Government must be given a<br />
fair go. What's the alternative. Th extraordinary<br />
thing I hear them expressing now is that if a Government<br />
can't get things through the Senate then the Senate ought<br />
to choose a Government. But they haven't got a majority<br />
in the Senate either they have 30 meinbers,* half the<br />
Senate and if you're to get something through the Senate,<br />
you've got to get a majority. If a vote is even in the<br />
Senate, then the motion or the Bill is not passed.<br />
Now they'Ive not had a vote on the Budget and it's plain<br />
from what Liberal senators have said on TV that if there<br />
was a vote on the Budget the vote would go in the affirmativethat<br />
is~ the Senate would pass the Budget. But the device<br />
they've used, three times, on each of three Bills, is to<br />
put up a motion that the debate should be deferred. That is,<br />
as I put it at the meeting this morning, they've gone on<br />
strike they won't do the job. And of course, even then<br />
they wouldn't have carried it if Bjelke-Petersen hadn't<br />
put in an anti-Labor person to succeed t1illiner.<br />
If Milliner had been there, then the vote would have been<br />
even and the vote to adjourn or to defer would have been<br />
defeated. Now that is the technicality, the illegitimate<br />
technicality) upon which they have gone on strike.<br />
Now I put to you this morning a couple of things<br />
which I believe are very great arguments to u ' se<br />
in the' Territory. One is the way they've cut things off<br />
for the Territory. Because here, and in Canberra, you<br />
depend on the Federal Budget alone. There is no part of<br />
Australia, with the possible exception of Canberra, where<br />
so many people depend on national Government payments<br />
they'e on he' payroll or they're doing contracts ' or the<br />
Government. If federal money wasn't spent in the Northern<br />
Territory most people in the Territory wouldn't have a job,<br />
or they wouldn't be able to get contracts, or<br />
make supplies. This Territory depends on the federal<br />
Government more than any other part of Australia. It depends<br />
on the federal Budget more than any State depends on the<br />
federal Budget, and the State Government Budgets and the<br />
Local Government Budgets combined. Private enterprise is<br />
certainly valuable in the Territory as it is everywhere in<br />
a mixed economy like Australia but private enterprise,<br />
for historical and understandable reasons, bulks smaller<br />
in the Northern Territory than anywhere else in Australia.<br />
For better or for worse you depend on the Government in the<br />
Northern Territory more than any other part of Australia<br />
depends on Governments. You don't have State Governments<br />
you depend, you only have a couple of local councils<br />
you depend more on the national Government than any other<br />
Australians depend on all Government activities<br />
employment, orders, contracts,. combined. And this is what<br />
they've done to you in the Budget. In the Budget, which<br />
they've stalled, there's $ 439 million for the Northern<br />
Territory there's $ 58 m for housing and construction;<br />
there's $ 45 m for education; there's $ 113 mn to run the<br />
Department of Northern Australia; there is $ 40 m for<br />
health services and there is $ 32 m for Aboriginal welfare and </p>
<p>advancement. And in total $ 439 m held up. Now I believe<br />
the people in this Territory will be outraged when they<br />
see what is happening at the hands of the Liberal and<br />
Country Party. And then I come to the other argument which I<br />
believe is.. overwhelming, overpowering in this Territory.<br />
The next _ election there is in this Territoryl or anywhere<br />
in Australia, the next time there's an election for the<br />
House of Representatives in Australia, the next time there<br />
is an election for the Senate in any State in Australia, there<br />
will also be an election for two Senators from the Northern<br />
Territory and I believe in these circumstances you ought to<br />
be able to get two-thirds of the votes, you ought to be<br />
able to get in both Ted Robertson and Kevin Frazer<br />
Frazer spelt with a I noticed from most of the signs<br />
around Australia, the other Fraser is spelt with a<br />
swastika! And you know they've got the gall now to<br />
contest the Senate situation in the Northern Territory.<br />
They've tried their level best, by every medns, to prevent<br />
the Northern Territory and Canberra having the right to<br />
elect Senators,. it's astonishing in this day and age<br />
that a Parliament which makes laws for any community shou" Ld<br />
not give, that community the right to choose members in the<br />
law-making body. I mean this wouldn't occur, we would think,<br />
anywhere else in the world, but you have to obey the laws<br />
passed by the federal Parliament and the laws can only be<br />
made if they-go through the House of Representatives and<br />
the Senate as well. And they've said every Liberal<br />
and every Country Party man,.-except one, on one occasion<br />
has said that you shouldn't have senators in from the Northern<br />
Territory, you shouldn't have a voice, still less a vote,<br />
on anything in the Senate, even if it concerns the Northern<br />
Territory alone, as some legislation does. You can not choose<br />
your law-makers that's their proposition. And three<br />
times we had to put this bill up in the Senate: on the<br />
first time it came before the House of Representatives the<br />
Liberals voted against it, -they've been consistent;<br />
the Country Party on the first time voted in favour of it.<br />
When it went to the Senate, they all there voted against it.<br />
And it was defeated. So with an interval of three months,<br />
which is required, we brought it up again; it passed through<br />
the House of Representatives; in the Senate once again,<br />
every Liberal and Country Party member voted against it.<br />
And then that was all we could do in that Parliament, but it<br />
was one of the bills for the double dissolution. After the<br />
double dissolution we again put it up in the Senate it<br />
was passed by the Reps" we put it up in the Senate, and<br />
again, every Country Party and Liberal senator voted against<br />
it, although it had been, once again, onre of thepp ledges--<br />
the Government made. The first time they'd been a double<br />
dissolution and the Senate had not passed the bill had<br />
produced the double dissolution. So for the first time in<br />
history we have to have a Joint Sitting and we had the<br />
numbers in the Joint Sitting and every Country Party and<br />
Liberal member voted against the Territory getting<br />
representation in the Senate except Sam Calder; he cuts no<br />
ice among his own crowd, because they all voted against hiim </p>
<p>Hie did vote for it himself, but he was terribly embarrassed<br />
because for the first time he made a scene in the Househe<br />
wanted to be thrown out so he wouldn't have to votebut<br />
we weren't going to accommodate him that way; he<br />
had to stay. So he voted for it; the best vote he's<br />
ever cast in his years in the Parliament. And a]. l his<br />
mates deserted him.<br />
Th ese Country Party candidates-don't forget that every<br />
Country Party man in the Senate, there' s no women in the.<br />
Country Party, has voted against having representation<br />
in the ( interjector whistles) they wouldn't be worth<br />
whistling for if they were! Everybody, John Gorton,<br />
Billy McMahon, Billy Snedden, Malcolm Fraser you seem<br />
to have forgotten the others they were no betterand<br />
Anthony and Sinclair and Nixon, and all of themthey<br />
all voted against it. So when in the Senate<br />
campaign any Lib EaJ. or Country Party person comes up here<br />
* say Why did you vote against us having a vote for the<br />
Senate?. Why because they all did. But then of course,<br />
when it was finally through, that wasn't enough, a<br />
* Country Party Premier, Bjelke-Petersen, he then asked<br />
the High Court to say that it was unconstitutional, that<br />
is*, something that the people had endorsed, one would<br />
have thought at the ' 72 elections and again at the ' 74 elections,<br />
something that had been passed by the House of Representatives<br />
three times, and at a Joint Sitting, this was then said to be<br />
unconstitutional. And he was supported by the Liberal Premier<br />
of Western Australia. Well the High Court determined,<br />
three weeks ago yesterday, that it was constitutional.<br />
I notice somebody in the audience this morning blamed Murphy<br />
for this-I meanMurphy did the<br />
sensible, decent thing. I mean ~ some people seem to think<br />
that there's something wrong in having a Labor Attorney-General<br />
on the High Court, but it's O. K. to have a Liberal one.<br />
And there's no need for me to tell you how Barwick voted on<br />
this, and how he voted, and how Murphy voted on this.<br />
on the Court. And Senator Greenwood made a great to-do<br />
about this three weeks ago: how montrous that Murphy should<br />
have given judgment on a piece of legislation on whose<br />
constitutionality he had advised. Now the fact is that back<br />
in 1961, when Barwick was Attorney-General, he advised the<br />
Government that there shouldn't be a vote for people in the<br />
House of Representatives from the Territories except on<br />
matters which concerned the Territories alone. So one would<br />
have thought that Barwick's views on representation and<br />
voting for the Territories in the House of Representatives and<br />
the Senate were well known, just as well known as Murphy's,<br />
and they've been consistent, both of them; they've been<br />
consistent. I don~' t blame Barwick for being consistent, but<br />
I think it's a bit of a cheek to blame Murphy for being<br />
consistent. On this matter they were ' paired'. But<br />
not only this Bjelke-Petersen heaped insult on injury by<br />
saying that the member of the House of Representatives from the<br />
Northern Territory shouldn't be able to vote either<br />
now we know he never speaks, but Bjelke-Petersen said he<br />
shouldn' t vote either that you not only shouldn' t have people<br />
in the Senate, with * seats or votes, the chap you had in the<br />
House of Representatives could have a seat, couldn't speak<br />
that makes no difference but couldn't vote either. </p>
<p>So I think it's pretty clear, up in this<br />
Territory, you know what the striking Senators from. the<br />
States, the Liberal and Country Party Senators from<br />
the States, who've gone on strike, what they think of the<br />
Territories. Canberra and the Northern Territory ought<br />
to be outraged on this because they suffer more than any<br />
other part of Australia. It's the Liberal and Country<br />
Parties who are provoking unemployment in this country.<br />
Just when we seem to be turhing the corner, in these<br />
respects, . inflation and unemployment,.-they are now<br />
wanting to exacerbate the position, to bring about a<br />
deterioration. They're the wreckers. This Budget of<br />
Bill Hayden's is the best the country has had for yearseverybody<br />
in the Territory will benefit from it.<br />
And they don't want to give it a chance to work. They<br />
say that in certain circumstances they'd pass the Budget<br />
Mr Fraser made a speech on the Budget himself made<br />
quite a number of criticisms in fact and then they<br />
were shown to be very shallow or in fact falacious.<br />
And he now says that his Budget is ' inoperative' the<br />
old Nixon word you remember Nixon's Press'Secretary,'<br />
Zi * eglerj said that one of the answers, not altogether<br />
accurate answers, that the President gave was ' inoperative'.<br />
Well Mr Fraser's speech on the Budget, in his own words,<br />
is now ' inoperative'. He doesn't want ours to operate either.<br />
lie's got no alternative; purely negative.<br />
Ladies and gentlemn, . I'm certain that when,<br />
sometime before the end of next June, there is for the<br />
first time an opportunity for the -people of this. Territory<br />
to choose representatives in the Senate ~ that they will choose<br />
people who will not brook any further damage to this Territory;<br />
who will insist in the Territory having its, full rights<br />
in the national Parliament, and they will turn to the Party<br />
which has fought ok those things, through all the<br />
obstruction, through all the opposition by States and Courts<br />
and Senate that they will see that the Senate is only<br />
properly represented from this Territory by two Labor<br />
candidates Robertson and Frazer with a </p>
