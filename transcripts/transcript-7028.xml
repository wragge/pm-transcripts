CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY<br />
PRIME MINISTER'S REMARKS AT THE DEDICATION OF<br />
THE BEN GURION GARDEN, NATIONAL JEWISH MEMORIAL CENTRE<br />
CANBERRA, 5 NOVEMBER 1986<br />
MR PRESIDENT<br />
MRS HERZOG<br />
AMBASSADOR BEN-YAACOV<br />
ISRAELI GUESTS<br />
LEADERS OF THE JEWISH COMMUNITY<br />
FRI ENDS<br />
SINCE MY FIRST VISIT TO ISRAEL IN 1971, I HAVE NOT CEASED TO<br />
ADMIRE THOSE QUALITIES IN ISRAELI LIFE WHICH WE ALSO CHERISH<br />
IN AUSTRALIA.<br />
IN WELCOMING YOU AND MRS HERZOG AT PARLIAMENT HOUSE TODAY,<br />
MR PRESIDENT, I REFERRED TO THE BOND WHICH AUSTRALIA AND<br />
ISRAEL SHARE AS VIGOROUS DEMOCRACIES, WHICH RESPECT THE RULE<br />
OF LAW AND A FREE PRESS.<br />
YOUR CONTINUING ATTACHMENT TO THESE DEMOCRATIC PRINCIPLES<br />
AND PRACTICES, DESPITE THE PRESSURES TO WHICH ISRAEL IS<br />
SUBJECT, IS A TRIBUTE TO THE WISDOM AND LEADERSHIP OF THE<br />
FOUNDING FATHER OF THE STATE OF ISRAEL, BEN GURION, THE<br />
HUNDREDTH ANNIVERSARY OF WHOSE BIRTH WE COMMEMORATE HERE<br />
TODAY.<br />
AS BEN GURION SAID, " THE TEST OF DEMOCRACY IS FREEDOM OF<br />
CRITICISM". THESE ARE WORDS WHICH ALL OF US FORTUNATE<br />
ENOUGH TO LIVE IN DEMOCRACIES WOULD DO WELL TO REMEMBER,<br />
PARTICULARLY WHEN THE POLITICAL GOING GETS TOUGH.<br />
OTHER FUNDAMENTAL BONDS BETWEEN AUSTRALIA AND ISRAEL ARE OUR<br />
STRONG LABOUR MOVEMENTS AND LABOR PARTIES.<br />
DAVID BEN GURION WORKED ALL HIS LIFE FOR THE GOAL OF A<br />
JEWISH WORKING CLASS, AT HOME ON THE SOIL OF THE LAND OF<br />
ISRAEL IN A CREATIVE ECONOMY, TAKING PART IN A REVOLUTION<br />
AGAINST AN OPPRESSIVE TRADITION OF MANY CENTURIES.<br />
A GREAT SOCIALIST, A MAN OF GREAT VISION, BEN GURION HAS<br />
BECOME AN INSPIRATION. </p>
<p>HE SERVED FOR 15 YEARS AS ISRAEL'S FIRST PRIME MINISTER.<br />
EARLIER HE HAD BEEN ONE OF THE FOUNDERS OF THE HISTRADUT,<br />
ISRAEL'S TRADE UNION MOVEMENT AND SERVED AS ITS GENERAL<br />
SECRETARY FROM 1921-35.<br />
THE AUSTRALIAN LABOR PARTY, WHOSE PARLIAMENTARY LEADER I AM<br />
PROUD TO BE AND THE AUSTRALIAN TRADE UNION MOVEMENT, WITH<br />
WHICH I AM PROUD TO HAVE BEEN ASSOCIATED FOR NEARLY<br />
YEARS, HAVE CLOSE LINKS WITH THEIR ISRAELI COUNTERPARTS.<br />
IT IS FOR THESE REASONS THAT I WAS HONOURED TO ACCEPT THE<br />
INVITATION OF THE AUSTRALIAN JEWISH COMMUNITY TO BE<br />
PATRON-IN-CHIEF OF THE AUSTRALIAN BEN GURION CENTENNIAL<br />
COMMITTEE.<br />
AND IT IS FOR THESE REASONS THAT I REGARD IT AS A PRIVILEGE<br />
TO BE HERE AT THIS CEREMONY TODAY.<br />
THE BEN GURION GARDEN WILL SERVE AS A PERMANENT SYMBOL OF<br />
THE BEST QUALITIES OF OUR TWO COUNTRIES AND OUR TWO PEOPLES. </p>
