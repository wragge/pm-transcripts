PRIME MINISTER<br />
PRESS STATEMENT NO: J6<br />
ROYAL COMMISSION INTO THE AUSTRALIAN<br />
PUBLIC SERVICE<br />
The Prime Minister, the Hon. E. G. Whitlam, M. P.,<br />
announced today that His Excellency, the Governor-General had<br />
appointed a Royal Commission to inquire into and report on the<br />
Australian Public Service.<br />
Mr. Whitlam said that the appointment of the Royal<br />
Commission confirmed the undertaking first-given by the government<br />
last December, when Mr. Barnard had announced that a Commission<br />
of Inquiry into the Public Service would be appointed upon<br />
receipt of the Post Office Inquiry Report.<br />
Mr. Whitlam. went on to say that as the Vernon Commission<br />
Report had been received and its major recommendations accepted,<br />
the Government had now appointed the promised Royal Commission<br />
into the Public Service.<br />
In announcing the appointment of the Royal Commission<br />
Mr. Whitlam recalled that in his policy speech, given on<br />
29 April he had said:<br />
' To promote further the efficiency of the Australian<br />
Public Service, we shall establish a Royal Commission.<br />
It will be headed by one of Australia's most distinguished<br />
and experienced former public servants a great<br />
servant of the Australian people Dr. H. C. Coombs".<br />
Mr.-Whitlam said he was delighted that Dr. Coombs had agreed to<br />
accept the Commission and that he would be so ably assisted by<br />
the other Commissioners chosen. ./ 2 </p>

The Prime Minister also announced that to assist<br />
Dr Coombs in his Commission, the Governor-General had appointed<br />
Mr P. H. Bailey, Deputy Secretary of the Department of Prime Minister<br />
and Cabinet; Professor Enid Campbell, Sir Isaac Isaacs Professor<br />
of Law at Monash University; the Hon. J. E. Isaac, Deputy President<br />
of the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission; and<br />
Mr P. R. Munro, Secretary of the Council of Commonwealth Public Service<br />
Organisations, as Commissioners. The Commission would be assisted<br />
by Dr P. S. Wilenski, who the Prime Minister announced would be seconded<br />
to the Commission as its Special Advisor.<br />
' Mr Whitlam went on to say that there had not been a<br />
comprehensive inquiry into the Australian Public Service sinc * e 1920.<br />
He said that in recent years many countries had appointed Inquiries<br />
into their Public Services. Amongst these were Canada in 1962 by<br />
the Glassco Commission, and Britain in 1968 by the Fulton Committee.<br />
As well, Ireland and Germany had conducted wide ranging Inquiries<br />
into their Public Services. Mr Whitlam said he had been informed that<br />
a Royal Commission would be welcomed by all the Australian Public<br />
Service staff associations and trade unions. He had also been informed<br />
by the Public Service Board that it would welcome a Royal Commission.<br />
Mr Whitlam reiterated the view expressed in his Garran<br />
Oration in November 1973, that the Australian Public Service commanded<br />
universal respect for its professionalism and impartiality. However,<br />
the government was committed to modernising the national public<br />
administration. This began with the re-allocation of administrative<br />
functions and other initiatives taken by the Australian Government<br />
since December 1972. An important step in this process was the<br />
appointment of the Royal Commission into the Australian Post Office<br />
under the Chairmanship of Sir James Vernon. The government's decision<br />
to establish a Royal Commission into the Public Service was evidence<br />
of its desire to continue this process.<br />
Mr Whitlam said that the Terms of Reference ( attached) were<br />
wide ranging and comprehended all the matters which have been the<br />
subject of debate and representation to Government over a period of<br />
many years. He said that the Commission would examine the role,<br />
organisation and staffing of the Australian Public Service with a view<br />
to improving efficiency, economy, adaptability, industrial relations<br />
and the despatch of public business.<br />
Mr Whitlam said it was expected that the Chairman of the<br />
Commission, Dr H. C. Coombs, would shortly announce arrangements for<br />
the conduct of hearings and for the submission of views by individuals<br />
and organ isations. The Prime Minister said that it was anticipated that the<br />
Commission would report within two years of its appointment, but that<br />
it could, if it wished, make interim reports on those matters about<br />
which it had concluded its deliberations.<br />
Mr Whitlam said that the appointment of such a Commission was<br />
an historic development in Australian public administration and one<br />
which he hoped would lead to an Australian Public Service better<br />
equipped to meet the future needs of the Australian people and<br />
Australian Governments.<br />
