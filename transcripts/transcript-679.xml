J. USTPRALIA DAY<br />
Message from the Prime Ivinister, the Rt. Hon. R. G.<br />
enzies_<br />
" We mark today the 175th Anniversary of the<br />
foundation of our nation. In those years our forbears<br />
and ourselves have done much in which we can take a just<br />
pride. Even so, the tasks ahead of us will demand great<br />
efforts and a spirit of enterprise and co-operation from<br />
all sections of the community. We of the cities must know<br />
and appreciate the labour which draws wealth from the farms.<br />
In the country there can be thought for those who work in<br />
factories producing vast and varied goods for home -nd<br />
overseas. we have much to be thankful for our law, our<br />
justice, our freedom, If we remember these things today<br />
we will find encouragement and stimulus to set out hands to<br />
the job before us, for we are on the threshold of a great<br />
future".<br />
CANTBERRA, January, 1963. </p>
