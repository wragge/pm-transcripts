TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
SPEECH AT THE YOUNG AUSTRALIAN OF THE YEAR AWARDS,<br />
DARLING HARBOUR, SYDNEY, 25 JANUARY 1996<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
I think it is a wonderful thing that once a year we take time out to celebrate<br />
our young Australians and what more appropriate day than for Australia Day<br />
as we celebrate it by naming an Australian of the Year and a Young<br />
Australian of. the Year. And it is always a good occasion too because I am<br />
always a sug Ier for a bit of entertainment.<br />
I thought those Tap Brothers were just terrific. I remember seeing the<br />
Tap Dogs, but hairy legs and working boots are not quite the same as those<br />
knee tights and spats. And I saw in some of the routines, being an old<br />
Fred Astaire fan, some of the work of his great choreographer, Hermes Pann<br />
and there is a name for you. Of course his mother and father were Mr and<br />
Mrs Pann and they just loved Hermes. But he was the best choreographer in<br />
the business and obviously some of it has rubbed off and, of course, the<br />
spats you know, the white tops on the black shoes give you all the<br />
movement.<br />
And, of course, in the twenties, spats were all the go with the well-to-do.<br />
I mean one of my predecessors, Stanley Melbourne Bruce, always had them<br />
on. But what I worry about is if the Tap Brothers get very famous, half the<br />
Coalition will put them back on again. I mean if they look anything like<br />
becoming a fad, they will slip them on so quickly I mean half of that front<br />
bench. But I will tell you this, they might have them on but one thing they<br />
won't do is tap or dance I can tell you that. There is certainly no rhythm in it.<br />
And, of course, John Williamson. Isn't he a star at getting that ethos and<br />
sense of Australia out there. And James Morrison I mean the one authentic<br />
form of American music, of course, is jazz and I don't know that we have ever<br />
had a better exponent of it here than James Morrison.<br />
So apart from the essential importance of our function today. It was good to<br />
come just to be entertained. If you know that old video </p>
<p>' That's Entertainment", I have rearranged all the magnetic particles on that<br />
over the years because it does you good, it warms you up.<br />
Well, I think, that one of the things worth saying about young people is that<br />
I don't think any experience I have had as a Minister, or as a Member of<br />
Parliament, or as Prime Minister with young Australians hasn't been<br />
positive.<br />
Always you get from them the hope, the expectations, the up-lifting spirits<br />
they have, the belief, the hope and the faith they have scepticism but not<br />
cynicism, interested, keen, and it is our duty to, I think, understand what a<br />
great joy it is to have them around us, what a great strength they provide our<br />
country and to invest in them.<br />
In the last couple of days I have been thinking about that and I did this<br />
morning in thinking about this question of, it's called, inter-generational trust,<br />
or the inter-generational inheritance. And this morning I met the Canberra<br />
Commission on the Elimination of Nuclear Weapons. Without a doubt,<br />
I think, the most distinguished group of people in the world saying of how the<br />
world would be a better and safer place if those 50,000 nuclear warheads<br />
laying around, arsenals, were taken away. And, I tell you what, it almost<br />
brings a tear to the eye to hear the Strategic Air Commander of the<br />
United Statds just three years ago say there is no place for nuclear weapons<br />
today, that they have no military use, that essentially they are a dead weight<br />
on the world and they are making the world an unsafer place.<br />
Or to hear similar views expressed by the former Prime Minister of France, or<br />
the Nobel Prize Winner Joseph Rotblat or any of the other distinguished<br />
people there. And if we Australians can be just that much influential in being<br />
the first government to take this issue up and start moving against the view<br />
that in the post-Cold War world we need a stock of nuclear weapons to keep<br />
it safe, then we will have done something for our children that, I think, we can<br />
be proud of.<br />
And we won't be leaving them with the inheritance we have lived with, all of<br />
us, through our young years, the tyranny of knowing that the world could be<br />
annihilated at any moment by accident, or by design. And so that is one thing<br />
that in this last 24 hours I have been thinking about in terms of<br />
inter-generational trust.<br />
The other is the environment and yesterday the government announced a<br />
very large package of measures to deal with some of the real environmental<br />
problems of this country land degradation, dry land salinity, destruction of<br />
bio-diversity, developing a National Reserves System. And you might recall<br />
before Christmas where the government announced a big policy of putting<br />
6 million hectares of Australian forests away for posterity into deferred forest<br />
areas. And looking at the commitment we are getting now from Landcare, where we<br />
hoped in 1989 when we started it we would have 1,000 Landcare groups. </p>
<p>We have now got 2,500 Landcare groups and we are going on. The big<br />
commitment of that is coming from young Australians. They are the ones who<br />
are interested in the environment. They know that we don't have to spoil the<br />
place to have a good life. And yet we know that if we don't manage it well, by<br />
the time our generation is no longer managing this country's fortunes we<br />
will have left them a degraded place, a place that they can't be proud of.<br />
So in just these two things, in the environment where we have got this great<br />
inheritance of this old continent of ours and where we have a chance to hold<br />
some of its pristine quality and repair the damage of 200 years since<br />
European settlement. These are things that, I think, we must think about in<br />
terms of the inter-generational inheritance, or cleaning the world up of<br />
nuclear weapons, making life safer and better.<br />
There are things that we can do, all of us, I think both with and for our young<br />
people and our question of who we are and our identity; the fact that we are<br />
now an open, modem economy trading into the world; the fact that we have<br />
made the linkages with Asia. I mean I know, as you know from just a week<br />
ago, the people who manage Malaysia, and Singapore, or Indonesia.<br />
But I didn't know them when I was young and young Australians will know<br />
them and they will know their counterparts in these countries. They will have<br />
that interest and excitement and opportunity that we didn't have.<br />
And I notice this debate in the press about now, you know, the pundits sitting<br />
back saying well you haven't jumped the TER hurdle. It is sitting up there in<br />
so many universities having not filled up their places, this is shocking. Well<br />
we want to see the places filled up. In fact the government just about<br />
doubted, in fact we have added 70 per cent of places, to universities taking<br />
them through from 300,000 to 560,000 places. So there are more places and<br />
that is why it is taking more time, perhaps, to fill them.<br />
But the fact of the matter is, eight youn g people in ten now complete a<br />
secondary education. Ten years ago, it was three in ten and now they have a<br />
secondary education we want to invest in them the confidence of knowing<br />
that we are interested in them, that we will take their education further, that<br />
we offer them the promise of an interesting and secure life in a country that is<br />
nice to live in, in an international society that is sane.<br />
Now, I think, these are some of the things that we have to think about.<br />
And on this occasion we have these awards to acknowledge the contribution<br />
of some young Australians, so that when we honour them we honour all<br />
young Australians and to say that we love them, that we are interested in<br />
them, that we will put our arm around them and that we celebrate their<br />
victories and their successes and their joys.<br />
That is what today is about and a nation that cares about its young people, is<br />
a nation with a soul, it is a nation that has got its values properly fixed and<br />
that is what we are doing here today. </p>
<p>So it is my very pleasant duty to announce the Young Australian of the Year<br />
in 1996. And I suppose what makes it, for me, a double pleasure is to dwell<br />
on the point I made earlier about entertainment and to celebrate the<br />
successes of our young people who can perform the way those Tap Brothers<br />
performed earlier, or the other artists today.<br />
And the winner, at 20 years of age, is already one of Australia's busiest<br />
concert pianists. She has won numerous awards and is currently studying for<br />
her Masters Degree at the Manhattan School of Music and about to make her<br />
debut with the New York Symphony Orchestra. It is, of course,<br />
Rebecca Chambers and Poppy King will escort her to the stage.<br />
