. A USTALIAQ<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR PRESS 17 JULY 1977<br />
MINISTER FOR SPECIAL TRADE NEGOTIATIONS<br />
Mr. John Howard has been appointed Minister for Special Trade<br />
Negotiations with the European Economic Community. He will take<br />
up his position in the near future and conduct his first round<br />
of negotiations in Europe in October and November.<br />
Mr. Howard remains Minister Assisting the Prime Minister. He<br />
will work in close collaboration with the Ministers for Overseas<br />
Trade and for Foreign Affairs.<br />
The Member for Farrer, Mr. W. C. Fife, will become Minister for<br />
Business and Consumer Affairs.<br />
Mr. Howard's appointment has been made because Australia needs<br />
to be represented at the highest level, on a continuing basis,<br />
if the bilateral trade problems facing Australia and the EEC are<br />
to be resolved adequately.<br />
The need for this high level appointment became clear during my<br />
discussions in Europe with the President of the Commission and<br />
with heads of a number of European Governments. The decision to<br />
appoint a Minister to lead these negotiations demonstrates the<br />
importance which Australia places on its trading relations with<br />
Western Europe.<br />
The Common Market countries have a total population of 260 million.<br />
They comprise the world's largest trading bloc, accounting for<br />
$ 300,000 million dollars, or 40% of world trade annually.<br />
Mr. Howard will lead discussions and negotiations with the<br />
governments of the nine member states and the Commission in<br />
Brussels on all bilateral and multilateral economic and trade<br />
matters in which Australia is involved.<br />
These negotiations, as agreed in Brussels with the Commission,<br />
will cover the totality of Australia's trading relations with<br />
Europe, including agricultural items, industrial products and<br />
the supply of raw materials.<br />
The discussions present both sides with the opportunity continually<br />
to review their positions in the forthcoming multilateral trade<br />
negotiations. / Additional ly<br />

Additionally, there will be closer consultation on other issues<br />
of common interest, such as the stance taken by Australia and<br />
by the EEC in the negotiation of international commodity<br />
stabilisation arrangements, such as those now taking place<br />
for sugar and wheat.<br />
Mr. Howard will keep under consideration the question of whether<br />
Australia should develop and formlise a structural framework<br />
between Australia and the EEC, through which trade could be<br />
fostered.<br />
His role will extend to other areas in the international and<br />
commercial field, where problems of interest to Australia could<br />
profitably be discussed with the EEC.<br />
The Secretary of the Department of Overseas Trade, Mr. D. H.<br />
McKay, OBE, will be Acting Secretary of the new Department of<br />
the Special Trade Negotiator, in addition to his current duties. S<br />
Mr. Fife entered Federal Parliament in December 1975 after<br />
having been a Member of the N. S. W. Parliament since 1957.<br />
He became the N. S. W. Minister for Mines in 1967, Minister<br />
for Conservation in 1971 and Minister for Power and Assistant<br />
Treasurer in 1972. 0 0 </p>
