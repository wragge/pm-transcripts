PRIME MINISTER<br />
CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY<br />
SPEC BY THE PRIME NINISTER, TIE NOWI P J KEATINIG NP<br />
WON= E IN SPORT<br />
SYDNEY 18 FEBRUARY 1993<br />
it is my great pleasure to be here again.<br />
There's no escaping it if you hold events in election<br />
time, you run the risk of a political speech.<br />
I could spare you from this, and tell you everything I<br />
know about Australian sportswomen.<br />
This would take a little longer than the five minutes I<br />
have been allotted; not because I'm expert, but because<br />
the great traditions of Australian sportswomen go back a<br />
long way.<br />
This year, of course, the tradition has been added to,<br />
particularly in Barcelona and partCicuiarly by Kathy watt<br />
who is our quest of honour tonight.-<br />
By contrast with our women's sporting traditions,<br />
Dr Hewoon's Goods and Services Tax has had a very short<br />
life: in fact, it is my sincere hope that it has no life<br />
at all. Anyway, I have long felt that Australians<br />
particularly Australian sportspeople are tired of<br />
politicians pretending to be expert in sport.<br />
So I'm not going to let you escape.<br />
And just as there is no escaping politics, T might say<br />
that there is no escaping the consequences for sport of<br />
my opponent's policies.<br />
This gathering tonight is a great illustration of how far<br />
women's sport has progressed in Australia.<br />
The Government is proud of the assistance we have been<br />
able to provide through the huge increase in funding in<br />
recent years, and through the work of the AIS and the<br />
Australian Sports Commission.<br />
But of course the Government is not the lifeblood of<br />
Australian women's sport women are, and the voluntary<br />
o rwaisations are. 6471 1 1 </p>
<p>I have to remind you that my opponent promiises to cut S7<br />
million out of the Australian Sports Commission budget;<br />
and to introduce a Goods and Services Tax that will make<br />
it more difficult f~~ tpriia. asul voluntkary<br />
organisations to function.<br />
Sport is a perfect illustration of how the GST will<br />
change the Australian lifestyle.-<br />
All sporting organizations will be hit by the GST and, as<br />
very few of them pay payroll tax, there is not even the<br />
partial compensation which some other bodies will get.<br />
There will be a 15 per cent tax on entry and registration<br />
fees for competition, on admission charges, on air<br />
travel, on basic services, on accommodation and on<br />
uniforms. Sports equipment costs will rise, so will the cost of<br />
remedial treatment. So will the cost of all health care,<br />
of course.<br />
The GST will apply to coaching courses. The price of<br />
swimming lessons for instance.<br />
I recently saw a letter from Forbes Carlisle in which he<br />
pointed out that, with a GST, privately run swim centres<br />
would lose both customers and income, and governments<br />
would be forced to spend millions of dollars if the<br />
public's needs were to be met.<br />
He wrote, " Now with the prospect of 15 per cent added to<br />
fees, many parents will be forced to drop out... There<br />
is no doubt that a GST will result in many less pupils<br />
and fewer children learning to swim..."<br />
He goes on to say that * It is certain that sports club<br />
memberships would be reduced so again the community would<br />
suffer by the imposition of this tax.'<br />
Sponsors wi 11 be hit by the GST. Sponsored sports<br />
will7 receive 15 per cent less or the sponsor will have to<br />
be asked for extra to maintain the level of funding.<br />
Some sponsors will get rebates, but banks, building<br />
societies and other financial institutions will not.<br />
Sports clubs will not only have to wear the tax in dollar<br />
terms, but in the extra time it takes to be a tax<br />
collector and an accountant.<br />
As I have said over the past twelve months and as I keep<br />
saying in this election campaign, the goods and services<br />
tax will change the lifestyle of Australia.<br />
I happen to believe that it is a completely unnecessary<br />
and grossly unfair tax. You don't have to agree with me<br />
on that, but I urge you to give careful consideration to<br />
6472 </p>
<p>3<br />
the consequences for your own lives and professions<br />
before you give it your approval.<br />
In the last twelve months, Australian women ' s spowt has<br />
thrived. many of the now or expanded programs at the AIS<br />
and the Sports Commission have been in women's sport, and--<br />
the participation of Australian women in sport in the<br />
community continues to grow.<br />
I thinkc our approach to sport should be guided by the<br />
same principle of fairness and equality which leads us to<br />
consider such things as education, health or social<br />
security as an Australian birthright. The opportunity<br />
should exist for all Australian women to participate at<br />
the most basic or the highest levels.<br />
And I think it w ould be a great pity if the great<br />
progress we have made in the last few years, and the<br />
institutions and mechanisms we have established, should<br />
be undermined.<br />
It remains for me to congratulate the sponsors, the<br />
Sports Commission's Women in Sport Unit, the judge. and<br />
of course, my colleague the minister, Ros Kelly, for<br />
their efforts to develop these awards.<br />
There is no doubt that they play a vital role in<br />
encouraging the goals of excellence and participation,<br />
not just in sport, but by their example, in other areas<br />
of Australian life.<br />
Thank you for having me along. 63473 </p>
