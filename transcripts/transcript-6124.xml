Jl~% RALIL&amp;<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MMIA<br />
MERGER OF A. I. D. A. AND BUSINESS ROUNDTABLE<br />
The Federal Government welcomes the forthcoming<br />
merger of the Australian Industries Development Association<br />
and the Business Roundtable, and today's announcement of its<br />
interim Committee of Management.<br />
It will be a constructive rationalisation of two<br />
bodies representing the Chief Executives of many of<br />
Australia's major companies.<br />
I expect the new body, the Business Council of<br />
Australia, to contribute to a greater involvement by senior<br />
business leaders in national economic and social policy<br />
issues. Such involvement will clearly benefit Australia.<br />
I expect another benefit to be some further<br />
upgrading in the economic research effort which has been a I<br />
feature of A. I. D. A's recent work.<br />
The Interim Chairman, Sir Arvi Parbo, and the<br />
members of the Interim Committee of Management are among the<br />
most distinguished business leaders in Australia. They areY<br />
admirably equipped to oversight arrangements for the merger.<br />
I am confident the Business Council of Australia<br />
will establish a close and harmonious relationship with the<br />
Confederation of Australian Industry and other business<br />
organizations. Canberra I June 1983 </p>
