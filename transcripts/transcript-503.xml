SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE RT. HONo R. G.<br />
MENZiES, AT OPENING OF ADOLPH BASSER LIBRARY.<br />
AD-MY OF CC CANBERRA 26TH I-A PRIL 1 C) 62<br />
Mr, President, Dr, 3asser, ladies and gentlemen;<br />
I want to tell you at once that a great weight has<br />
fallen from my mind since I arrived here this afternoon. I was<br />
here this morning as a sort of soi-disant Fellow of the Academy,<br />
compassed about by the most formidable collection of scientists<br />
that Australia has ever seen. So I felt muted and a little<br />
depressed, But when I came in here this afternoon and saw so<br />
many people just as unscientific as I am, this took a weight off<br />
my shoulders. Sir, I want to say, before I make a few remarks that<br />
may be relevant to the occasion, that I cannot tell you how I<br />
admire the international organisation which has been directed to<br />
this evento This afternoon I open formally whatever that meansthe<br />
Library and I was told in advance very kindly by my old<br />
friend Professor Cherry that this was to be directed to<br />
scientific history, or the history of science. Today, when I<br />
went into my office I opened up a coimmunication from Harvard of<br />
which I am, as you might say, a species of graduate and it<br />
contained a Newslette:. and, believe it or not, the subject of the<br />
Newsletter was " Reflections on the History of Science as an<br />
academic subject An ., Umerican viewro That gave me an enhanced<br />
opinion of the skill with w1-hich these people organised their<br />
business, Could I first of all say somethling about the man wIhose<br />
name we are honouring this afternoon, Adolph Bassero So far as I<br />
can make out I haven't pursued him impertinently he wasn't<br />
born in Australia, but all I can say is that he has lived a long<br />
time in Australia and ho has left his mark on Australia, He is<br />
one of those men who, having decided no doubt that it was time<br />
that he had a hobby, took up as a hobby giving money away. This<br />
is an admirable hobby, nd give it away he does, in a magnificent<br />
and spacious, but always well-directed fashion, I want him to<br />
know that everybody here appreciates what he has done, and is<br />
doing, very greatly indeed,<br />
The other thing that I want to say to you concerns the<br />
KLibrary itself. There are those and perhaps I have been among<br />
them in my time who think threo is some rather deep cleavage<br />
between what w. To call scientific study in the strict sense, and the<br />
study of the humanities It is very fascinating to me to find how<br />
the lines blur, and how, in the case of this Library you can<br />
bring the great business of history into conjunction with the<br />
groat business of science. The study of history has always<br />
scomed to me to be one of the most important studies that a man<br />
can direct his mind to because an ignorance of history can so<br />
easily produce a stupid disaster; and to have it applied in the<br />
case of science seems to me to be a splendid illustration of its<br />
value not only to science, but in other fields,<br />
A knowledge of history seems to me to be of great moment<br />
for the conduct of public affairs; for the great conduct of<br />
business affairs for that matter. I speak subject to correction<br />
but wasn't it Henry Ford himself who, when on oath oddly enough,<br />
in some litigation in America made that immortal remark that<br />
" history is bunk", which satisfied my own mind that he understood<br />
mass production better than he understood history. How can we<br />
handle the reat affairs of notions unless we know something<br />
about the past; unless we know what has happened; unless we<br />
reject that single fallacy that ' happy is the country that has<br />
no history'? I say unhappy is the country that has people<br />
charged with Government the responsibility for it who are not<br />
able to look back with history , nd to realise that there is not<br />
much that is now, that thor:: are many demonstrations of error and<br />
that the business of wis mni is to avoid errors that have been<br />
committed and confine themselv. js to their own instead of<br />
imitating other people's. </p>
<p>In or 2.<br />
In science it soams Ito me, as a layman, to be quite<br />
clear that he -vho talkc-. 7 thc ed es of Gs'me pice of<br />
scientific investigation, accepots it,, Puts it in-to operation, is<br />
not a scinitin the fu'Ll s -% nsC-at The man who Tants to<br />
conduct investiga2tion into sc-ientific principles can never, I<br />
believe, separate himself fj--rom -that ,. rent be fore the last discovery.<br />
He cannot confine himsai f to the discovcery itsclf. It is not<br />
suffi cient to say 1-vhat did he do? l Js vory important to<br />
di scover why ho did it9 and how he, did it,. Oo tuc have the great<br />
stream of scientific kn owledge I a stream, incroasing at such a pac<br />
in raod-ern times-,-th: at to unciorsuand it fully we must occasionally<br />
go back along the streamrs and seck the fountainhead instead of just<br />
dividing up the little stroams. Ther?-.: fore the study of the<br />
nistory of science, facili7t ieS for that study, facilities for<br />
quiet reading and rofJlction, s. cem to , e to be of the me'Ist<br />
tr_-emendous iraportancce0<br />
Thor--is just oncl other thing that I uould like to say<br />
to you, A refolrence rmad,,, by Profe-ssor Cheorry to sound<br />
rocordings0 I thinik vc haven't caught up very : mi-uch yet uith the<br />
idea of using tapea record-ings anO. other nmeanis of recording people's<br />
voices and ideas. ' Niobody) for ealecould properly understand<br />
the history, purposo, fun' tiori of' thiis Academy unloss as I<br />
didn~ t I had h.-Ad thie fortho[,. ugh-t-to -put on my table a tapere-<br />

wonderful thing it ; vjsou1. d be to have on record the voice itself,<br />
things that ha_ d bee~ n said uich Emigh tl in fact, in some sense,<br />
influence the. future course of events. In thae samer,(, wVay I can<br />

I ve--nture oh-pta in this Library there; will be some space<br />
reserved for such things as tape re cordings.<br />
' Ja in A talaarc disposed to be a cy-nical, sceptical<br />

fair chance of being faraous or forgotten if you have boen dead long<br />

Iventure to say taat iriis Academy there re men anL oe hs<br />
voices, lite-rally whose voice. s, woulId be liste ned to with profound<br />
inteorest by pcople hero in 50 years' timea, -or in ]. 00 years' tirae.<br />
That really is why I llav only one doubt a-bout the Bassor Library<br />
and th~ it is uwhether it will be big~ enou_ gh. Because. as time goes on<br />
the material that it will-accumula te vill 3. argci, and larger and<br />
indc, 3d ore and more sig.:. nificant0<br />
But that we srlould be able to fLind established in this<br />
p]. a-ce a Library devoted to scientific historN is, I think, a Late<br />
for congratulations. I am ve ry we-ll aware of what Tom. Cherry says<br />
about duplication of libraric-s and I am atll fo+. r rationalising these<br />
matters. I say that as one who has ha~ d quite a few.. libr.-ries<br />
pluciked out of him thie las-t few ycars,, But at tine s-) me time I<br />
ari bound to say to you that 1 think one -of tho -many proofs of<br />
growing civilisatiean in our-couantry is that wl. oeras to find a<br />
Library in a University was, not so many years ., go9, rather a rarity,<br />
we now have quite a few lar , ge, rgrowing, comraerhensive. In this<br />
is the very heart of th-e ' Univer1sity structure,,<br />
Thi-erefor-; Sir, Dr. 3asser, in thanking you for what you<br />

Hall which cormmoeoratos the r. ma; ni fi * cent : and imaginative generosity<br />
of Sir Ellerton Bockor, that this Librar wilb oehngtt<br />
