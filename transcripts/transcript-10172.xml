PRIME MINISTER<br />
18 November 1996 TRANSCRIPT O THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
THlE HON. JOHN HOWARD MP<br />
PRESS CONFERE NCE PARLIAMENT HOUSE<br />
E O E<br />
Ladies and gentlemen, I've called this news conference to inform the Australian public<br />
that shortly after 8.00am this morning President Clinton telephoned me to inform me<br />
that according to the space tracking facilities of the United States, the Russian Mars<br />
probe, which is now apparently orbiting out of control, could crash on Australian<br />
territory, His advice at that time was that it could crash around nooh,' eastern summer time<br />
Australian eastern summer time, although there was. no clear certainty about that.. We.<br />
can't be certain where the probe will come to earth. The initial indications, according<br />
to the President, were that it would be at some point in the Indian Ocean. When he<br />
spoke to me the best advice was north central Australia. I have subsequently spoken<br />
to the Premiers of New South Wales and Queensland to inform themn of my knowledge<br />
of the matter and Mr Fischer has spoken to the Chief Minister of the Northern<br />
Territory. I have also briefed the Leader of the Opposition. We're continuing to<br />
monitor the likely impact point.<br />
The probe contains four plutonium powered batteries. Each the size of an ordinary<br />
film canister containing approximately 200 grams of plutonium all together. The<br />
Russian spgce agency has advised us and also the United States that the canisters are<br />
designed to withstand the heat of re-entry and impact on the ground in which case<br />
there would be no danger of contamination, I chaired a meeting of the National<br />
Security Council this morning which has asked the Australian Defence Force and<br />
Emergency Management Australia to make preparations to deal with any emergency. I<br />
would of course, as well as informing the Australian public of the information we have<br />
available at the present time, naturally urge all Australians if they do believe they come<br />
into contact with any of the debris of the-probe after the point of impact if it does land<br />
in Australia. Can I emphasis that it is just impossible to know two thingys exactly<br />
when it will hit the earth or come into the water, it's impossible to know exactly when<br />
that's going to happen and, of course, it's impossible to know exactly where.<br />
Although the bulk of the situation reports over the last few hours have all been that it<br />
would be somewhere in the northern eastern central part of Australia. One of the very<br />
T : Bd IZ: ZT 96/ 11/ 81wToi WGJJ XVg </p>
<p>later reports indicates that it could well be in the Timor Sea&amp; It is a very, very moving<br />
feast and we really won't know until it does comne to earth. Obviously anybody who<br />
does come into contact or believe they're coming into contact withi any of the debris<br />
should display extreme caution. We have been told, and we have no reason to believe<br />
that the advice tendered by the Russians about the state of the canisters is other than<br />
correct, but quite clearly it is a matter that the Australian public is entitled to be filly<br />
informed of After I was ruing by the President this morning and after I'd had the<br />
meeting at the Security Council I endeavoured to ascertain as much information before<br />
calling this news conference so that I could firstly give reasonable notice before the<br />
likely point of impact, but also at the same time have as much up to date information as<br />
could possibly be made available.<br />
The President's press secretary has issued a statement which I will make available if<br />
it's not already been made available I'll have it made available through my office<br />
which provides really no more detail. It reiterates the statement of the Russian<br />
authorities that there is no danger of contamination. It does make the point that in the<br />
unlikely event that one or more of the batteries did break open the United States would<br />
be prepared to offer all necessary help to any nation to deal with any resuiting<br />
problems. ' Now our emergency management arrangements, of course, have included<br />
consultation with the atomic energy advisers and the scientific advisers available to the<br />
Government. They were informed very shortly after I had mny discussion with the<br />
President. 1 naturally appreciated his action in personally telephoning me to inform me<br />
of the up to date assessment of his authorities. I don't think that there is anything<br />
more that I can usefully say at this stage except to again emphasis to the Australian<br />
public the need for very great caution.<br />
If people have any information about the impact of the probe there is a Defence<br />
Department telephone number that I'd make available that is 06 265 0000. If people<br />
have information, or they believe they have information, which beas upon the time and<br />
the point of impact then they're invited to ring that telephone number.<br />
JOURNAILIST:<br />
Prime Minister do you expect to get any more detailed updates on the likely impact<br />
point through the morning?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Yes I do.<br />
JOURNALIST: And how wvill you post us about that the people I mean?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well I will just take whatever steps and my office and Mr McLachlan's office will take<br />
whatever steps are necessary as further information, hard information, becomes<br />
available we'll make it known either by means of a written statement or perhaps even a 2<br />
z : BJ TZ: ZT 96/ IT/ BrwJJXTW0JJ XVJ </p>
<p>fuarther news conference by one or other of us or one of our officials. It's one of these<br />
things where we want people to know what the situation is but we don't want to be<br />
melodramatic about it it's important. I mean, the public has a right to know that<br />
something containing four canisters of plutonium may land in our country. They must<br />
also be reassured that according to the advice that we've got that they won't break<br />
open. But the only thing you can do in a situation like this is to tell the public in a<br />
completely factual way what you know and what you've been informed. I can't tell<br />
you where it's going to land, I can't tell you when, I can't guarantee it but I can only<br />
tell you what I've been told.<br />
JOURNALIST:<br />
Prime Minister, what is the action plan that if it lands on Australian soil, what happens<br />
there with emergency services?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
We'll have a team of experts wvho will pretty quickly go there. in fact, I reckon they'll<br />
be there very, very quickly indeed. I wouldn't even, as a non-scientist, I wouldn't even<br />
begin to understand precisely what they would then go about doing, but they have a<br />
very well developed action plan. And the team includes not only defence personnel but<br />
it also includes people who know quite a lot about dangerous substances.<br />
JOURNALIST; Isn't it already on the way from the United States, Mr Howard?<br />
MCLACHLAN: That plan has been activated already. As soon as we heard about it the Chief of the<br />
Defence Force activated the plan. It's a standing plan. It's in place ready to move all<br />
the time. And it has people who are experts on radiological matters, it has<br />
arrangements with the State emergency services and that's been activated about an<br />
hour, hour and a quarter ago.<br />
JOURNALIST: And where is this team and where do they take off from?<br />
MCLACHLAN:<br />
Well they're under the control of Brigadier Alan Hodges. They are all over the<br />
country. I mean, they are in various aspects but they'll be pulled in physically. They're<br />
in different places, but they're controlled out of Canberra.<br />
JOURNALIST: Are they assembling at the moment? 3<br />
E : Bid TZ: ZT 96/ 11/ 81tzJ W0jj XXTVj </p>
<p>MCLACHLAN: They are. They have been assembling on the phone and physically for an hour and ten<br />
minutes or so. But as the Prime Minister said, assembling to go where is a difficulty.<br />
And I just would like to emphasise that our information is that in past all the<br />
predictions of the re-entry points and where these sorts of space debris finish up have<br />
been inaccurate.<br />
JOURNALIST: Are you hopeful of being told before it lands...<br />
MCLACHILAN: Have been inaccurate, yes...<br />
JOURNALIST: Sorry, are you hopefu of having any advanced warning before it lands on where it will<br />
land or is that<br />
MCLACHLAN; Let me just say to you that, as the Prime Minister said, we've had the previous<br />
thought was, the first thought was that it would be in the Indian Ocean, then<br />
somewhere in Northern and then Eastern Australia and now back in the Timor Sea.<br />
All of that information, the last three pieces of information, have come through in the<br />
last hour and twenty minutes. So we'll have updates as soon as they can be<br />
ascertained by the US, and we're working very closely of course with the US.<br />
JOURNALIST: ( Inaudible).., moving in from the US already in a pre-emptive fashion?<br />
MCILACHLAN: No.<br />
JOURNALIST: How big is the debris expected to be from this? Is there any sort of estimate on what<br />
sort of size<br />
PRIE MINISTER:<br />
It depends with what. I mean, it starts to disintegrate, burn-up, as it re-enters the<br />
earths atmosphere so... 4<br />

WDJJ XV, 4 </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Who will Own it Minister or Prime Minister? Will it be the Russians or ours?<br />
MCLACHLAN: You mean if it lands in the East Timor Sea who will own it.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, what's your understanding of the amount of damage that 200 grams of<br />
plutonium could in fact do to a population?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Oh look Paul, my advice is that it won't break up on impact, therefore it's not goin8 to<br />
escape. But I'm not going to, for reasons I'm sure you understand, I'm not even going<br />
to begin to hypothesise about that. I think my responsibility is unemotionally and in a<br />
non-melodramatic way to tell people what the facts are. I'm not into the business of<br />
hypothesising, I don't think that's sensible. And quite frankly, I don't know that it<br />
would be sensible of any of the networks or the news outlets of this country to be<br />
other than completely factual. We are dealing here with a very sensitive, I hope not<br />
threatening, situation and I don't think any of should engage in the exaggeration or the<br />
melodramatic... JOURNALIST: Are we likely to take up the US offer of help in dealing with it if it lands on Australian<br />
SOil? PRIM MINISTER:<br />
Well, it would depend entirely on the circumstances under which it landed in Australia<br />
and what the consequences of that landing where. We note the American offer but we<br />
have considerable resources of our own in these matters. But obviously if any help<br />
were needed we would take it up. I hope it's not. I mean, let me emphasise it. If the<br />
advice that the Russians have given both us and the Americans is correct, and even if it<br />
does land in Australia and hopefuly it will land in an uninhabited part let us.. . if it<br />
does then there will be no cause for any concern or alarm.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, beyond the advice about what's in this space debris has there been any<br />
other information provided by the Russians and are you concerned that in fact we<br />
found out a bit about this from the United States and not from the Russians?<br />
S : Bj TZ: Zr 96/ 11/ 81 WOJ; XV. </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:<br />
No. Well look, I haven't really had time to sit around and think about whether we<br />
would should have heard about it earlier. I mean, I'll worry about that this afternoon<br />
or tomorr ow. I'm grateful that the Americans were able to informn us at the highest<br />
level and in such a detailed way. I had quite a detailed briefing on the background of it<br />
directly from the President and subsequent to that my National Security Adviser spoke<br />
to the person in the White House who was on top of the all the technical detail of it.<br />
So the Americans couldn't have been more helpful and couldn't have been more<br />
anxious to let us know in detail what the situation was. The Deputy Foreign Minister<br />
of Russia rang the Russian Anibassador in Canberra at about 9.30am to give himi a<br />
briefing. Whether something should have been told to somebody else earlier, I'll worry<br />
about that later. I'm just a little more preoccupied with the next few hours.<br />
JOURNALIST:<br />
Have the Russians requested access to the debris?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
No. JOURNALIST: Did the President express any doubt about coming to Australia?<br />
PRIM MINISTER:<br />
I beg your pardon?<br />
JOURNALIST: Did the President express any doubt about-.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
No, he said he's looking forward to seeing us.<br />
JOURNALIST: ( Inaudible)<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
He's pretty comfortable and relaxed. 6<br />
' 9 :-6j 1Z: zT 96/ 11/ 81woJ W0JJ XVPA </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: On the President's visit directly, can you give an assurance to the Australian car<br />
industry that you will raise with President Clinton the question of their threat to our<br />
automotive exports?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Look, I called this news conference to talk about this other matter. I'll have plenty of<br />
other opportunities to talk about the Clinton visit.<br />
JOURNALIST; ( Inaudible)... . with the President this morning and wvas the first you had heard of this<br />
satellite? PRIE MINISTER:<br />
Well I'd heard on the ABC that it was travelling around. In fact, I think the ABC<br />
radio bulletins this morning carried a reference to the satellite and I1th ink the existence<br />
on it of the four batteries. I think it did. We had a conversation of about ten minutes<br />
and during the conversation lie gave me a technical run down and we just went<br />
through all the background of it. It was very helpifi and the sort of gesture that you<br />
would expoct from the leader of a country with whom you have very close relations.<br />
But of course it's obviously one of those situations where there's a proper obligation<br />
to share that kind of information in the interest of people taking adequate preparations.<br />
JOURNALIST: Are our own facilities tracking the satellite, in Pine Gap and other Austrajiar bases?<br />
PRI[ ME MINISTER:<br />
Well I don't normally get into comments about what some of our facilities do now, do<br />
I? JOURNALIST:<br />
No. PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Thank YOU. 7<br />
