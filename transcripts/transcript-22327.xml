    <content><![CDATA[<p>The term of office of a Governor-General is, formally, at royal pleasure.</p>
<p>When His Excellency Major General Michael Jeffery AC CVO MC was appointed in June 2003 I said that the expectation was for him to serve between three and four years.</p>
<p>The Governor-General has carried out his duties with great dignity and distinction.  He is widely respected by Australians and has represented our country abroad on a number of important occasions.</p>
<p>Her Majesty the Queen, has, on my advice, agreed that Major General Jeffery will serve as Governor-General for a further period of at least two years from now.</p>
<p>  On behalf of the Government and the people of Australia, I wish the Governor-General and Mrs Jeffery well for the remainder of his time in office.  </p>
