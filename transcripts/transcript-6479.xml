BUSINESS COUNCI1L OF AUSTRALIA SYDNEY 21 SEPTEMBER 190!,<br />
I would like to begin by recording my thanks to Sir Arvi<br />
Parbo for the way in vhicn he has faci iitated contaci<br />
between the Cvernment and thc Busi ness Council ovcei the<br />
past year. I extend my Lest vwishes i z, thr-new Chairman, Mr<br />
Bob Wihte, ond look forwa-rd to continuing close<br />
co-operation.<br />
It is now just over a year since I addi-essed the first<br />
meeting of the Business Council of Austr~ aia.<br />
The year that stands between your first PrI-d second jnnL, 21<br />
meetings has been one of qrcat achi evo mEnllnt for your Council1<br />
and for Australia.<br />
Already the Business Cou.-iil of Aust'i ali and its vnt:; Aic.: s<br />
are rnakig a constructive contribution to p-: blic<br />
polic)-, iakino and public education i-p the i-tercsts ,3i<br />

<p>Fsster growth and modest teage i ncreases % 7ithin the Accord<br />
h av e d i a rrno; t i c a y reduced real unit Iabour costs. The share<br />
of national income accruing to profits is now higher thin at<br />
anly time for t. ie post 10 The continued succes.-, ful<br />
operation of the ALcord will enable_ still further<br />
improvement in real unit labourzreists because there. will be<br />
no increases -in award wages -over the twel. ve mionths to next<br />
April. Real i.. ooes cost,,; pez-unit of output are now much the<br />
same as in the late 1960' s to earl1y 1970' s.<br />
This rapid turnaround in economic activity has been<br />
accompanied by the lowest incidence of industrial<br />
disputation, as m~ easured by working days lost, for one and a<br />
hal', decades.<br />
Interest rates have fallen appreciably, contributing<br />
directly to lower business costs and improved sales and<br />
investment prospects.<br />
Our success over the past year or so, goes beyond there<br />
qjuantifiable e ffects, to greater co-o~ peration amnong:-st major<br />
groups in our economy, and the enhanczd con-imun ity confidencec<br />
that has eme rged from-, new consul tat ive inechani sis anid<br />

Austra) iiins have accepted and responded to the message that<br />
I have been advancing, that the objectives of each of<br />
Australia's vc:-ious economric groups can be realised MOre<br />
ef fectively ' through co-operation than through the<br />
confrontation which hsd become an entrenched feature of<br />
Australian life.<br />
As a result there is a rmuch imiproved e-. vironrnent for<br />
addressing the di f F5 cult econiomic issues and choices that WC<br />
must conf ront as a nat ion i f we are -to ochi eve susJtC ined,<br />
strong non-inf lat ionary growth<br />
At the centre of our @ chi evements to date hZI3 been the nciw<br />
wil lingness of key economic groups to enter into close arid<br />

<p>In one important area the Council is contribUtingq to the<br />
implementation of policy the Affirmative. Action Program,.<br />
The Business Council is pisaying a significant role in the<br />
course of the Program through TLhe individual efforts of its<br />
member 2-ompar ies who axe inVolved in -the. 12 months Pilot and<br />
throLgh it-, reprEsEntation on the torking Party on<br />
Affirmative Action Legis) otion. with Hr John Uhriig. I am<br />
sure -the contribution of both will help the Government to<br />
adopt a realistic and workable approach to the issue.<br />
I also greatly appreciate the * contribution that the Business<br />
Council and its m embers have already made to discussion on<br />
matters that niust-be on the vgend2 of future policy reform<br />
if we are to realise the great ambitions which we all share<br />
for Australia. T wo major examplesi are your recent<br />
submisssioi on taxation to the Econonic Planning Advisory<br />
* Council, and your thoughtful contributions on industry<br />
policy and business taxation this afternoon.<br />
Ile both understand that there will always be some issue-s on<br />
which our perceptions differ. In the end the Government,<br />
elected by) the Australian people as final arbiter of the<br />
national interest, must take responsibility for policy<br />
d eci s i o n s.<br />
But we will always make better decisions if we have access<br />
to honest and careful advice of the kind that we heve<br />
received on many issues from the Busir-. ess Council.<br />
One important feature of our cons-ultative processes is the<br />
way in whi ch they have been open to comamunity scrutiny : the<br />
positions that the Business Council, other bus iness groups,<br />
the trade union movcment and the Statc's have put to this<br />
3overnment have been recleased for public scrutiny to a far<br />
gre-ater degree than had ever previous~ jy been the case in<br />
Australia. For its own part, the Government has exposed its<br />
preliminary thinking on miajor policy issues well in advance<br />
of final decisions, to facilitate wider public comment.<br />
There are, of course, some types of information which cannot<br />
properly -be placed immediately in the public sphere. B u t I<br />
b r-1i e t Lha L w e h -3v decf in ed t hes e im j. t S mo re geCne rocusl Y to<br />
the community interest in public disclosure than an)'<br />

<p>The re v as ey tens ive pub ! i c comment on t he Go vernment Is<br />
consul tat ion w. i th the ACTU prior to the budget Wh Pt h as<br />
received l ess comm-ient but which iE; I am sure appreciated by<br />
most of you here today iJs the. 1arqe. amoui) t of time that I<br />
personally have alloccted to fortmail P~ nd informal*. discussion<br />
of policy with a wide rnnqeof.. bus. r-esss groups. B u t i t<br />
wiould * be w-, rong to cone) ude that this close consul tat ion with<br />
some of the stronger grusi orcomm-un[. tCy means that we<br />
have disregarded other in'~ erests.<br />
To make this point., I need on] ly Tefer to what has been done<br />
by this Go\' crnmert in only 18 months to assist the genuine]), y<br />
need), in our coimunity who are not represented directly by<br />
business groups or-unions. The substantial increases in<br />
real pensions, bene fits and servicesj to thc most needy<br />
groups in our society, including pensioners with children,<br />
pensioner renters, the single unienpJ eyed, benefici aries of<br />
public housing and the aboriginal community, contrast with<br />
real decline in the previous seven years.<br />
The strong emnplosyment growth Which has accomnpanied the<br />
implementation of our economic stratngy has made a<br />
substantial contribution to the alleviation of the most<br />
. mportant single cause of poverty in our soci ety to the<br />
alloviation of both hidden and open unemnployment. There as<br />
a lonfg way to go, and our emnphasis on li fting long-term<br />
growth performance is directed very mufch to continuing the<br />
recent progress.<br />
The same point can be made by reference to the solutions to<br />
entrenched -industry problems that have oeirged from our<br />
-onsultat ive processes. The), have yielded substantial<br />
benefits for the iiider economy arid society.<br />
The major financial deregulation that: we have be<br />
implementing over the past year ha) s been accom,, panie.' d by<br />
intonse consul tation by the Treasurer, Paul Keaiting, and<br />
myself, with !-elev; rlf. business and union grnups". There is<br />
widespread agreement that the greatestA boneficiaries, are the<br />
-many users of financial servi ces, arid the w'hole communi ty<br />
through-the contribution that the financi a) reforms,, wil..<br />
mnake to overall girowth per forrnnnccs.<br />

dy,. ipnism to a major -Australian industry and region.<br />
In the troubled coal industry last Friday tLhF Minister for<br />
Resources and Energy Senator Peter W( alsh presided over a<br />
meeting of the Austral ian Coal. Consultat ive Council. Th e<br />
meeting arose out of the crisis precipitated by the<br />
announcement of major retrenchments by comnpanies operating<br />
on the South Coast of New South 1. ales.<br />
F ortunately, we have been able to avoid the confrontation<br />
which is currently stalling economic recovery in Britain.<br />
The meeting was characterised by the will ingness of all<br />
papties to e-. 2Dmane rationally the causes of problefms, and<br />
the opportun LiCs-for strengthening the industry.<br />
The Comnmonealth Governiienrt for its part is will ing to<br />

each of the central parties.<br />
This Government's1 docisions on economic policy have been<br />
gUi ded by commi tments to consultCation and 2onsensus, to the<br />
equlitable distribution of the benefits of economic growth,<br />
and to thie achievement Of Sustained, st rong non-inflationary<br />
growth. I hove alw-. ays seen these three commi tments as<br />
intcr-r:. lated parts of the one great program.<br />
No--progres's can be madc on any one of the three without<br />
support froin the others<br />
Without sustained, non-inflationary grovyth, there can be no<br />
lastAing progress towards any other objective.<br />
Wi thout sustained ilro'wth, high and risinrg unemployment must<br />
increase the number of our people without empl oymnt and<br />
1 ivinct in poveity. Vi thout sustained growi-th there will be<br />
insufficient resources to provide adequately for Australians<br />
in need.<br />
But equally, only an) Australian society that is broadly<br />
united on the great national goals, and which is seen by<br />
most of its citizens as a fair society, twill embrace the<br />
changes tthich are necessa-ry for sustai ned growth.<br />

Virtual ly all observers nou agree that w-e found The right<br />
fiscal arid monetary policy mix in the las; t financial year.<br />
~ I-e believe that we have found the right policy settings<br />
again this year.<br />
tle are expecting a larger private sector contribution to<br />
growth this year through increased consumption and<br />
investment, and so judge it appropriate W~ moderate the<br />
extent of fiscal stimulus. But we have avoided winding back<br />
the fiscal stimulus so rapidly that recovery is undermined.<br />
Thle July, retail sales figures announced yesterday, and the<br />
revisions to earlier data, suggest that the grow~ th in<br />
consumption is at least in line with the expectations that<br />
we developed in the course of preparing the Budget. But we<br />
are leaving nothing tc chance, and ltook forwarci to further<br />
strengthening of private consumption fr oo November, as the<br />
tax cuts arnd incroased social security payments begin to<br />
influence spending patterns.<br />
The ccntinucd crow: th in demFand associated with expansi on of<br />
non-farm product by about 5 per cent this fi nancaial year,<br />
t oge'ther with continuedt w. age m-, oderation within the Prices<br />
and Incomes Accord, and lower i nflationary' expectat ions and<br />
interest rates, shouldc support the higher levels of private<br />
investment anticipated in the Budget.<br />
Several key features of the Budget were designed to mai~ ntain<br />
the u,, om-, e.-tum of pri vate inovestmnent growth that his been<br />
indicatt~ d in the statist ics since early this year : the<br />
large reduction in the budget deficit,* from 1" 05 per cent to<br />
.3.3 per cent of CDP supported by the Stantes' agreemenit in<br />
the Premiers' Conference and Loans Council t~ o restraints on<br />
their osin borrow~ ing; and! he tax cuts i~ n support of the<br />

<p>As I have said on several occasions, we will further exaine:<br />
business taxation arrangements in the context of a taxation<br />
reform package.<br />
The continued strergtheninq of:-i-nvestm nt oriented -towards<br />
production for the domestic market-. noy sceems likely to. be<br />
joined late in the financial year by the return of<br />
investment activity in the resources -sector. ' CRA's Channar<br />
iron ore joint venture with China, the Portland and Bunbury<br />
aluminium smelters and the Bunbury power station, and the<br />
export phase of the Northwest Shelf Project, have all<br />
emerged as substantial near-term prospects over the past<br />
month or so.<br />
I believe that there are excellent prospects for continued<br />
good economic performance through the current financial year<br />
a view that I am pleased to know is shared by many of you<br />
here today.<br />
This second year of strong growth with moderating inflation,<br />
amidst increasing community understanding of the<br />
requirements of long-term growth, and continued<br />
strengthening of Australia's consultative mechanisms and<br />
institutions, provides an ideal environment to intensify our<br />
efforts to reform policy and institutions in many areas<br />
important to long-term economic performance.<br />
I wish to refer specifically to the general regulatory<br />
environment, Federal-State financial relations and tax<br />
reform, trade, and the relationship of our education system<br />
and training programs to the demands of the labour market.<br />
This is by no means an exhaustive list, but it includes some<br />
of the main areas that have been the subject of widespread<br />
public discussion, such as taxation reform, and others on<br />
which Government policy development : is at an advanced stage.<br />
I am convinced that after eighty four years of Federation,<br />
we have accumulated an excessive and often irrelevant and<br />
obstructive body of laws and regulations. We seek your<br />
assistance in removing from this accumulation as many as<br />
possible of those laws and regulations which serve no clear<br />
and useful purpose. We see the removal of unnecessary<br />
regulation as contributing significantly to improved<br />
economic growth performance.<br />
I am inviting the ACTU nd the Business Council to nominate<br />
representatives to work wi th Governmrent off; i. ci ls on<br />
priorities in the reform of busir esr s regul. ation.<br />
' We will examinu critica) ly the whole range of business<br />
regjul tion, most impo't. ntIy I it: I a view to assea silg its<br />
contribution to lonu-terr grotll pir f) or; n rce </p>
<p>Ile will riaintain regulation kfhich upon careful analysis,<br />
clearly prumntes economic e ff iciency or which is clearly an<br />
effective means of achieving more equitable income<br />
di stribution.<br />
And we vwill abandon. regulation which fai-. s these tests.<br />
Our reforms in the financial sector illus~ trate our approach<br />
and demonstrate our commitment to the abandonment of<br />
unnecessary regulation.<br />
Where regulatory-~ reformn is required, we will ensure that<br />
change is gradual when this is necessary to avoid placing<br />
excessive adjustment burdens on individuals and groups<br />
affected by change.' Anid concistently with our whole<br />
approach to economic management, we will consult closely<br />
with representatives of-groups that are affected by change.<br />
In many areas, reform to promote economic gr owth will<br />
require not increased or reduced regulation, but changes in<br />
t) ie policy instruments that are used, and in policy<br />
settings. This has been the experience with our major sectoral-reforms<br />
in manufacturing industry. It is ccnsistent with the<br />
approach that is emerging within the Australian"<br />
Manufacturing Council and the Economic Planning Advisory<br />
Council. Obviously Federal-State financial relations and the taxation<br />
system are on any reform agenda. They are closely<br />
inter-rel1ated. I hope that a review of the divi sion between<br />
the Commonwealth anid the States of ta) xation revenues and<br />
taxation powers through the year ahead will lead to reduced<br />
reliance by the States on some of their more economnically<br />
distorting taxes.<br />
I have nade it clear that we do not see tax reform as a<br />
means of raising the* overall level of taxation. But there<br />
is widespread agreement within the Australian community<br />
that we do not collect taxation reventie through the most<br />
equitable and eft'icient means. 1he instruments through<br />
which the conmuni ty cont ri butes a givyin amount of revenue is<br />
a matter of considerable i mportance, ev~ n when thei-e is noD<br />
change in the overall le( vel of taxation. Every hiker ' knoi. s<br />
that the same weight can fel mouch liqhter i( i t is carriccI<br />

success tie are having in developing co-operation with Chinj<br />
on iron and steelI, and more broadly, is one importdnt<br />
ex ampl1e.<br />
My regional trade initiative is als,. o producing' valuable<br />
r es ulIt s. The round of consultations it has generated on<br />
issues likely to be involved in any future new round of<br />
Multilateral trade neogtiations, has been greatly<br />
appreciated by all countries concerned.<br />
* We are establishing an Australian Co-operation Å. rnittee to<br />
provide advice to'Government on economic relations with<br />
. countries in our region.<br />
On these matters, I shoulld record my appreciation of the<br />
advice and assistance of a very great Australian, Sir John<br />
Crawford, both before and after the time I became Prime<br />
Minister. We have been careful to ensure that our domestic industry<br />
policy decisions are consistent with our international trade<br />
policy. This is supported by the widespread understanding~<br />
that has developed within the community, that increased<br />
protection does not provide efficient long--term. solutions to<br />
industry problems.<br />
In the development of closer trade ties with our region, as<br />
in* most areas of economic life, Governr-. ent can do no more<br />
than provide a framework of expended oppo rtunities. it<br />
augurs well for Australia's economic prospects that the<br />
private sector is providing* strong suIpport for our1 efforts<br />
to expand Australia's Western Pacific Ii n k s. Never before<br />
have Australians been so active in seeL.: ing opportunities for<br />
international business co-operation, and this is being<br />
rewarded with expansion of trade and investment.<br />
1 believe that nothing is more iriportant ' to the<br />
strengt hening of our long-term growth performance than the<br />
expansion of our efforts in training, re-training and<br />
education. Thi.'-is an area of special. Government<br />
responoibility, but here, too, wc welcome guida-nce from<br />

<p>The Kirby Committec. is currently reviewing the whole range<br />
of Government tVaininq programs. And w'e have esteblished<br />
the Karme'~ Committee to review the quality of Australian<br />
education, viith a special concern to improve the relevance<br />
of the . education. process to employment -and future economic<br />
opportunities. At the saime time, the Com~ monwealth Tertiary Education<br />
Commission, under its now Chairman, Hugh Hudson, is<br />
examining similar issues in higher edu) cation.<br />
* The receipt of tt-e Hancock Committee Report will provide an<br />
opportunity to review longstanding Australian labour market<br />
institutions. Here, as elsewhere, we will be guided by<br />
observable realities, and not by an a priori presumption<br />
* that regulation in itself is either good or bad.<br />
This is an area in which I have had unique opportunities to<br />
observe the realities. This experience leads me to caution<br />
against simple and glib proposals !-or radical reform.<br />
-Proponents of radical deregulation must be able to explain<br />
the Australia wage explosion of 1982-82, when the<br />
centralised wage-setting arrangements w4ere in suspension.<br />
They must he able to explain why real wages growth<br />
currently so high in Britain, with higher unemployment, less<br />
growth in employment, and less official labour market<br />
regulation than in Australia.<br />
None of this argues against intel ligent assessment of the:<br />
Australian system with a view to im. proving further on the<br />
good recent experience.<br />
Vie can only maintain community support for long-term<br />
structural reform in these 2nd other areas if we arc able<br />
to sustain gur strong imacro-cconomice.-performance.<br />
We recognise that we must further reduce the Commonwealth<br />
budget deficit as privpte investment continues to strengtheni<br />
in 1985-86 and beyond. Consistently with our com-mitmieni-t not<br />
to increase the overall. level of taxation in the course of<br />
taxation reform, we will achieve this* resu~ t by restral nizn<br />

<p>There will come a time iihen continued strong growth vi1<br />
justify some improvement in employment conditions beyond<br />
wage indexation.<br />
In thisregard, judgewents -ibout : the . vppropriate time and<br />
scale of any productivity increasLes must-. depend on the<br />
durability and strength of the r. ecovery,:. and above all on<br />
developments in the labour market.<br />
Obviously, the stronger the growth in employment, and the<br />
larger and more rapid the decline in unemployment, the<br />
better the case for productivity adjustments in one for. cr<br />
another. I would want to see lower unemployment before te<br />
took substantial steps in this direction, but obviously th'is<br />
is a matter for discussicn amongst the parties when we alil<br />
have better information much closer to the event, and<br />
eventually for resolution before the Commission.<br />
Mr Chairman,<br />
It is a measure of our achievements in the past eighteen<br />
months that the economic policy agenda is dominated by<br />
long-terr issues of economic growth and economic reform.<br />
And I use the term " our" in a genuinely plural sense.<br />
It is the achievement of this Government that we have<br />
provided the right direction at the right time. But our<br />
current improved position is as much the achievement of thel<br />
business and farming communities, the trade union movement,<br />
the Australian Federation through the Premiers' Conference<br />
and the whole Australian community.<br />
The-economic and political stability of these past eiohteen<br />
months have allowed the whole AustraYian people to lift its<br />
sights to the great future which is now within our reach.<br />
1 look forward to working with you for many years ahead, in<br />
placing Australia firmly on a new path of sustained, strong<br />
non-inflationary growth.<br />
I am glad of the good company of the Business Council in<br />
this great venture for Australia.<br />
