STATEMENT BY THE CHAIRMAN OF THE SOUTH PACIFIC FORUM,<br />
THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
LATEST TEST OF A NUCLEAR WEAPON BY CHINA<br />
As current Chair of the South Pacific Forum, on behalf of my Forum colleagues I<br />
condemn the latest test of a nuclear weapon by China.<br />
China has once again shown disregard for international opposition to nuclear<br />
testing by carrying out its second test since the indefinite extension of the Treaty<br />
on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons in May 1995.<br />
China and other nuclear weapons states must come to terms with the imminent<br />
ban on nuclear testing for all time. They must consider carefully the impact of<br />
the changed global security situation on the role of nuclear weapons.<br />
Forum leaders welcome the continuation by the United States of America,<br />
Russia and the United Kingdom of their moratoriums on nuclear testing, as well<br />
as the recent announcements by the USA and France of their commitment to a<br />
truly comprehensive test ban treaty ( CTBT). These are a significant boost to<br />
current negotiations for a CTBT. Forum leaders reiterate their strong support for<br />
finalisation and signature of the Treaty in 1996.<br />
We look to China and France to desist from further testing as the CTBT<br />
negotiations enter this final, critical stage. The heads of government have noted<br />
China's commitment to sign such a treaty. France has given a similar<br />
commitment. The current nuclear testing programs of these two countries are<br />
inconsistent with their commitment to exercise ' utmost restraint' on nuclear<br />
testing pending the conclusion of a CTBT, and will sour the atmosphere of the<br />
negotiations. Forum countries, along. with others, are considering a suitable resolution to be<br />
put before the United Nations General Assembly to pressure China and France<br />
to reconsider their testing programs. Additionally, Forum members will be<br />
considering action in other international forums to make our opposition known<br />
and to press the Chinese Government to stop testing.<br />
Nuclear weapons have cast a great shadow over humanity in this past half<br />
century. South Pacific Forum heads of government call on China to contribute to<br />
world peace by eliminating the testing of nuclear weapons, thereby taking<br />
another significant step on the journey to the eventual elimination of nuclear<br />
weapons. CANBERRA 22 AUGUST 1995 </p>
