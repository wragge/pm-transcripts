    <content><![CDATA[<p>LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION - Kim Beazley</p>
<p>I was saddened to learn of the death overnight of Sir Hubert Opperman. Oppy will be remembered as a great sportsman who held over 100 world records in cycling some of them still standing at the time he died. </p>
<p>He will also be remembered for his contribution to Parliament, politics and his diplomatic service, as Australias High Commissioner to Malta. After his retirement from the diplomatic service he maintained a strong involvement in his community. Victorians in particular will remember his work in recent years for the Association of the Blind. </p>
<p>On behalf of the Federal Parliamentary Labor Party I extend my condolences to his widow Mavys and the Opperman family. </p>
<p>19 April 1996 </p>
