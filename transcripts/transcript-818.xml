PRESS CONFERENCE GIVEN BY THE RIGHT HONOURABLE<br />
SIR ROBERT MENZIES PRIME MINISTER OF AUSTP1L1* IA.<br />
AT PARLIAiAMNT HOUS, CANBERR, ON MONDAY,<br />
SEPTEMBER 1963 AT 5 P. M. ON THE OCCASION OF THE<br />
VISIT OF THE PRIME MINISTER OF JAPAiN, MR. H. IKEDA<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
QUESTION P. M. Perhaps before questions are put, I just ought to<br />
surmiarise today by saying that I had a little talk<br />
this morning with the Prime Minister. We then went<br />
into the Cabinet room where I had ten or eleven<br />
Ministers to meet him. We had a very interesting<br />
and valuable private discussion with him which I<br />
think we all njoyed very much and this afternoon,<br />
after one or two visits that the Prime Minister<br />
had to make, I have just had an hour and a half<br />
with him again and we finally settled the terms<br />
of a cormzunique which will, no doubt, be distributed<br />
quite soon. All of these discussions were very<br />
useful. I think I would sum them up by saying<br />
that the position of Japan in the Western Pacific<br />
and down here in the South-West Pacific is<br />
increasingly important. Japan is not only a very<br />
powerful country and growing stronger, with<br />
cons idorable economic development and great<br />
talent, but is a free country with a democratic<br />
system of government and I believe, and we<br />
believe, increasingly important in this section<br />
of the world. Quite important anywhere in the<br />
world but particularly important because if you<br />
take the free countries on the eastern littoral<br />
of China, then quite plainly Japan has the<br />
greatest strongth, the greatest influence and,<br />
we think, is approaching all these international<br />
topics in a genuine spirit of goodwill and this<br />
is warmly reciprocated here. This visit has given<br />
us, on both sides, an opportunity of restating<br />
it and being able to say quite honestly that the<br />
relations have grown in strength and in genuinenosa.<br />
( This was translated by Mr. Matsuoko for the<br />
benefit of the Japanese press party who were<br />
present) I represent the Asahi Shinbun and am very grateful<br />
that you are giving us this conference today, Sir.<br />
I have two questions to ask. The first concerns<br />
Malaysia. Prime Minister Ikeda has expressed the<br />
view that a summit conference with the leaders of<br />
Malaysia, Indonesia anxdthe Philippines, could help<br />
stabilise the position. What do you think of the<br />
practicabiJity of this idea?<br />
Well I'd prefer not to say anything very<br />
conclusive on that matter. The Prime Minister<br />
himself developed that notion with us today<br />
very clearly. There are problems, of course.<br />
For example, if there were to be a summit<br />
conference, presumably it would be between<br />
President Macapagal Soekarno and the Tunku.<br />
Would the Tunku be there as the Prime Minister of<br />
Malaysia? Presumably he would. I can't quite<br />
see him attending in any other capacity. If so,<br />
it would seem to me that one advantage of such<br />
a conference would be that it would involve a<br />
recognition on the part of the Philippines and<br />
Indonesia of the existence, the genuine existence<br />
of Malaysia, which would be a step forward. / 2 </p>
<p>-2<br />
P. M.<br />
( Contd.)<br />
QUESTION P. M. But I don't profess to know what the Tunku Abdual<br />
Rahrian has in his mind. I can quite imagine that<br />
he fools that the existence of continued threats<br />
to Malaysia, cither by way of what is called<br />
confrontation or by active incidents along the<br />
frontier, are perhaps rather inconsistent with a<br />
peaceful negotlation around the table. On the other<br />
hand of course, he may very well say, " There is<br />
nothing I'm not prepared to discuss, because I have<br />
no ambitions to serve except to preserve Malays~ a<br />
and encourage it and enable it to go on and be*<br />
prosperous and successful. But we are on the sidelines<br />
here. We don't decide these matters. If you<br />
were to say to me, " I1s it a good thing to sit ar'ound<br />
a table-and have no hostilities outside?", then of<br />
course that would be a very easy one to answer.<br />
What is really needed over the whole of this matter<br />
is that thireats should come to an end and that it<br />
should be recognised that you have new three groups of<br />
people the Philippines, Indonesia and Malaysia<br />
all of them anxious to go on with their own business, 7<br />
I hope and to be prosperous and to raise their<br />
economic standards, and all of them I 4r--uld hope,<br />
willing to live in peace with the o hers. So stated,<br />
it is sixiple enough. If a conference can contribute<br />
to such a result, then it is a good thing but I [ lave<br />
had a long experiunce of conferences and I must say<br />
that I usually like to have a bit of work done first<br />
before the conference begins so tUhat it is possible to<br />
discover whether there is a reasonable prospect-of<br />
arriving at some useful conclusion. That doesn't<br />
mean I reject the idea; it merely means that I am<br />
not just automatically putting my stamp on it.<br />
You have said that it is generally acknowledged that<br />
there is a growing goodwill between A'ustralia and<br />
Japan and a great growth in trade. It is recognised<br />
that this should be pursued and expanded. Have you<br />
any positive ideas as to how this right be done in<br />
the future course of development of goodwill and<br />
further expansion?<br />
I think that this will comeo by inevitable circu~ mstances.<br />
We had a little talk about that this morning. -There<br />
is no doubt about it, we are very large traders with<br />
each other today, There is a very substantial<br />
balance of trade in favour of Australia because of<br />
the nature of our exports. We are all ag-reed that<br />
this trade will develop. It will go on expanding.<br />
It will roach greater and greater proportions as<br />
time goes on. This is inevitable because of the<br />
pattern of the trade between us. We produce and<br />
sell things that Japan needs and Japan is going through<br />
a rapid phase of economic development, the national<br />
income is rising, its capacity to buy things that we<br />
produce and sell will rise and, of course, inevitably<br />
there will be some increase of trade both ways. I<br />
don't think that anybody expects that the trade<br />
between Japan and Australia can be brought into<br />
ba~ lance in a hurry if at all because of the nature<br />
of what the trade is. We are sending things to<br />
Japan like wool, wheat, and fo-) dstuffs which Japan<br />
needs and which, to that extent, she is not producing<br />
herself. Japan sends to us manufactured goods and<br />
we are, of course a substantial manufacturing country<br />
Ourselvos, so thaoi the problem is not just a simple<br />
mathematical one. But we all agree the visiting<br />
delegation and ourselves that all the prospects are<br />
that there will be steady increase in the already<br />
substantial voluzro of trade between the two countries, </p>

QUESTION P. M.<br />
QUESTION P. M.<br />
QUESTION P. M.<br />
QUESTION P. M.<br />
QUESTION g<br />
P. M. Australia like Japan, is an anti-Communist country.<br />
However Australia has in the past few years exported<br />
a very large quantity of wheat to Communist ChnaDoyouLntend<br />
to contimnr exporting wheat in this volume and do<br />
you consider this has any relation to political attitude<br />
to Communist China and, in particular to the question of<br />
whether Communist China should be admitted to the United<br />
Nations? Well, that is a group of questions. In the first place,<br />
I imagine I think rightly that Japan does not have any<br />
artificial prohibition of trade with Communist China<br />
but, like ourselves, she abstains from exporting<br />
strategic goods. So do we. It is quite true we have<br />
sold, in the last two or three years very large quantities<br />
of wheat to China and we are quite prepared to carry that<br />
on. We grow a lot of wheat and we like to sell it. We<br />
eat some of it inside Australia and we sell the rest.<br />
Yes, we will go on selling wheat to Communist China under<br />
existing circumstances. This doesn't have any effect on<br />
whether we recognise Communist China diplomatically or<br />
not, We don't. It has no bearing on whether we would<br />
support the seating of Communist China in the United<br />
Stations because we have not supported that. We think<br />
that there are very high political reasons for those<br />
policies but they don't in any way cut across ordinary<br />
relations in matters which are not the subject of<br />
strategic importance.<br />
Can you give any indication at this stage of the timetable<br />
for the restricted trade practices legislation?<br />
Well, it is not yet in the form of legislation. As you<br />
know, a genedl description of the ideas was made in<br />
Parliament. It was done deliberately to expose it to<br />
criticism over a considerable period of time. There have<br />
been many criticisms, some destructive and some<br />
constructive. As I said recently, the best ones that<br />
we had, we had recently from the spokesmen of the<br />
Manufacturing Industries Advisory Council and those<br />
matters are now under consideration. But when Cabinet<br />
has given consideration to those ideas, then for the<br />
first time will it be possible to put what proposals<br />
emerge into legislative form. That is not something<br />
t'at may be expected in the matter of a few weeks.<br />
Sir Robert, talking of timetables, could you give us a<br />
timetable of any plans you might have for an early<br />
election?<br />
Well that I am proposing to have an election is beyond<br />
all doubt, but when, I don't know.<br />
Is there any justification for having an early election?<br />
Oh I think I could justify an early one, a medium one,<br />
a ate one. Anyhow, it is all right. There is nothing<br />
hidden that shall not be made known.<br />
Was there any significance behindthedecision to defer<br />
a decision on the choice of the new bomber?<br />
Oh, no. vc have had an evaluation team overseas. It<br />
cane back. It produced a great deal of material<br />
massive material. This matter has then been put into<br />
examination by the Defence Department as a whole and<br />
I expect that the next Cabinet or perhaps the one<br />
afterwards will get the result of that examination.<br />
There is no significance in what you might think </p>
<p>P. M.<br />
( Contd.) QUESTION P M. to be delay. There was bound to be some tine because<br />
this is a vast matter, running irnto very significant<br />
defence ideas and also into a great deal of money<br />
and therefore we want to feel perfectly certain that<br />
when we muake a decision it will be the right one.<br />
That's all.<br />
Did you discuss defence co-operation with Mr. Ikeda,<br />
Sir? No, </p>
