THE PRIME MINISTER'S PRESS CONFERENCE<br />
AT PARLIAMENT HOUSE, CANBERRA<br />
TUESDAY, 8 MAY, 1973<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I only have one Cabinet decision to give<br />
you. The other decisions were given to you last Sunday because<br />
Cabinet sat last Sunday, since the usual meeting time, Tuesday<br />
morning, has been occupied by a meeting of the House of<br />
Representatives. The decision that I now give you was made<br />
last Sunday but there had to be consultations with other<br />
countries. It concerns controls over strategic exports.<br />
The Government has taken a decision on a report by departments<br />
on the question of strategic export controls over commercial<br />
trade. It's been decided that Australia will no longer<br />
maintain on commercial trade with the Soviet Union, Eastern<br />
Europe, China, North Korea, North Vietnam and Cuba restraints<br />
different from the restraints on commercial trade maintained<br />
on any other country. The controls which have been maintained<br />
by Australia have not proved in recent years to have much<br />
relevance to our production and it has therefore been decided<br />
to treat trade with all countries on a similar basis. It's<br />
well known that controls by other western countries have been<br />
progressively reduced and the United States and European<br />
countries are selling highly sophisticated material to the<br />
communist countries. We have notified a number of our closest<br />
friends of this decision and have assured them that Australia<br />
will not be a means towards circumventing any controls which<br />
they may maintain over their own production. This decision<br />
has no bearing on the controls which are maintained by Australia<br />
over the export of arms and war-like stores and atomic energy<br />
material. The embargo on trade with North Vietnam is being<br />
removed and we consider this is appropriate in view of the<br />
establishment of relations with that country.<br />
I might also inform you that Professor Gruen, Professor<br />
of Economics at the Australian National University is taking up<br />
an appointment as consultant to the Department of the Prime<br />
Minister and Cabinet. The appointment will be on a part-time<br />
basis. Professor Gruen will continue in his position at the<br />
University but will be available for advice and consultation<br />
to the Department and to the Prime Minister on economic<br />
assignments. Professor Gruen has occupied his present position<br />
at the Australian National University since December 1972.<br />
He was formerly Professor of Agricultural Economics at Monash.<br />
Are there any questions?<br />
Q: Does Professor Gruen's work supplement that of Dr Coombs,<br />
Sir, or replace it </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER: No, supplements it.<br />
Q: Sir, on the announcement you've made about trade with<br />
various countries, can you tell us if this will affect our<br />
trading relations with Rhodesia, South Africa. Are we saying<br />
that trade with any country will now be O. K.?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: There is an exception in the case of Rhodesia<br />
because the United Nations has passed resolutions the Security<br />
Council has passed resolutions on that subject. I should<br />
of course have added that those controls will be strictly<br />
applied. Q: What are the strategic exports that will be now allowed<br />
to be exported to these countries?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: The trade with those countries will be the<br />
same as with all other countries. The restrictions on trade<br />
with these countries will be the same as the restrictions on<br />
trade with other countries, namely war-like stores and atomic<br />
energy material.<br />
Q: Prime Minister, following the national wage case decision<br />
today, Mr Cameron issued a statement in which he said there was<br />
no justification in this decision for manufacturers to put up<br />
their prices. In the light of the community's great concern<br />
about prices and inflation generally and your meeting with the<br />
Premiers this week on this subject, are you prepared to ask as<br />
Prime Minister that manufacturers not immediately put up their<br />
prices, and that perhaps unions might consider the increase<br />
they got today as perhaps something that they can go along with<br />
and stay their hand for a little while?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I'm not going to say anything more on this<br />
subject. I'm of course preparing quite busily today and tomorrow<br />
what I'll be saying at the Premiers' Conference on Thursday.<br />
And Mr Cameron I saw his statement I've got nothing to add<br />
to it.<br />
Q: Did you approve that statement Sir?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Yes.<br />
Q: Prime Minister, since your Government has expressed the<br />
intention of closely co-ordinating inter-departmental policies<br />
on protection, could you tell us what action has been taken<br />
to co-ordinate the protectionist policies at this stage?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: A new Protection Policy division has been set<br />
up in my Department. IT was approved by the Executive Council<br />
the other day. Vacancies will be advertised in the Gazette this<br />
Thursday and some senior positions in the daily press. There is<br />
an inter-departmental committee on assistance to industries<br />
which will be the focus of departmental and inter-departmental<br />
co-operation in work on tariffs and other selective forms of<br />
assistance to industries. This committee will be chaired by my<br />
Department and also it will have as members the Treasury and the<br />
Industry Department or Departments relevant to the particular<br />
matters it's considering. other Departments such as Labour or<br />
Defence will be co-opted as appropriate. </p>
<p>Q: You said last week that this week's Cabinet would<br />
be discussing details of the Trade Practices legislation<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No, I was too optimistic. It didn't.<br />
Q: Last week, Prime Minister, you said that you weren't<br />
sure about when you would table the report by three Australian<br />
scientists about the French tests. Are you any more sure now?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No.<br />
Q: When will you be?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I'm no more sure.<br />
Q: When will you be any more sure than you are now?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I tabled four reports I think it was last<br />
Wednesday on the consequences of atomic tests. That was last<br />
Wednesday. Q: but now the three Australian scientists?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I made a reference to their report in it.<br />
Q: You didn't table it?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No.<br />
Q: will you?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I'm thinking about it.<br />
Q: Prime Minister, can you give us any progress report on the<br />
talks between the French scientists and the Australian scientists?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: They've proceeded throughout today. They may<br />
go into tomorrow I'm told.<br />
Q: Will we be given any statement on what's been discussed?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I don't think so.<br />
Q: Are they making any progress, Sir?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I don't know.<br />
Q: Prime Minister, supplementary to that other question about<br />
the report by the three Australian scientists, you did in answer<br />
to my question last week say that you couldn't table it because<br />
of the case of ours being prepared in the International Court of<br />
Justice, and yet you did table the others. May I ask then why<br />
you can't table the one by the Australian scientists?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I took all the advice on this matter about the<br />
four that I did table last Wednesday. You must appreciate I've<br />
got to be quite careful as to what is released pending these<br />
proceedings which may take place before the International Court<br />
of Justice. </p>
<p>Q: Sir, why won't we be told what's happening between the<br />
scientists? PRIME MINISTER: There again, I will take advice on this in<br />
the light of any proceedings which may ensue.<br />
Q: Prime Minister, on the question of French nuclear tests,<br />
can you tell us one way or the other, do you support industrial<br />
action by Australian trade unions against the French Government<br />
and their carrying on with the nuclear tests?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I don't encourage it. If it takes place<br />
there's no more we can do about it than our predecessors.<br />
Q: Do you then endorse it though Sir, when you say you don't<br />
encourage it?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I don't encourage it.<br />
0: Prime Minister, in the light of the appointment of Mr Gruen<br />
as mentioned today in the establishment of the new Protection<br />
Policy division, do you anticipate that your Department<br />
PRIME MINISTER: He's not necessarily associated with the new<br />
Protection Policy division<br />
Q: No, I appreciate that, but they are both appointments<br />
in the economic policy area...<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Yes.<br />
Q: Do you anticipate your Department taking on the sort of<br />
major economic policy role that Mr Chifley anticipated in the<br />
Prime Minister's Department some 25-odd years ago when he lost<br />
an election?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: The Prime Minister's Department is the appropriate<br />
Department to co-ordinate matters, and of course, there are quite<br />
a number of matters which have to be co-ordinated in the protection<br />
field. Up till now there has been no adequate investigation of<br />
claims for protection in primary industry. There has been very<br />
little co-ordination, if any, in the protection given at the<br />
instance of the Department of Secondary Industry as it now is,<br />
or the Department of Customs and Excise by-law exemption,<br />
and accordingly, if there is to be proper co-ordination in the<br />
two Departments which have had responsibilities in protection<br />
up till now and also in respect to Primary Industry naturally<br />
the Prime Minister's Department should provide that co-ordination.<br />
Q: Do you anticipate the Prime Ministers Department actually<br />
initiating the policy proposals?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No, I don't anticipate that. The title of the<br />
Department is the Department of the Prime! Minister and Cabinet,<br />
and accordingly it is the natural Department to co-ordinate<br />
matters between other Departments, and, as you know, I am now<br />
technically responsible for the Protection Commission which<br />
Sir John Crawford is investigating.<br />
Q: Mr Whitlam, are you opposed to Ansett having 24 per cent<br />
of the national airline in Papua New Guinea? </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER: I'm only concerned in this what<br />
Ansett Transport Industries does in Papua New Guinea insofar<br />
as that affects other Australian airlines. What the Government<br />
of Papua New Guinea does is its affair except insofar as<br />
Australian companies or instrumentalities are concerned.<br />
So, in isolation I don't object to Ansett Transport Industries<br />
having 24 per cent. I would think it wrong however for Anlsett<br />
Transport Industries to have a predominant role over the roles<br />
of other Australian airlines.<br />
Q: Sir, do you believe that an Australian Government should<br />
be able to dictate to the Government of Papua New Guinea on the<br />
composition of its airline?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I don't believe that, and I don't believe<br />
the reverse either.<br />
Q: As the Prime Minister, you are aware no doubt of today's<br />
report by the Committee on Commonwealth superannuation.<br />
When will the Government act upon this?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Yes, this is being given to Cabinet for<br />
information but we haven't considered it yet. You will<br />
appreciate that we are tabling reports practically as soon as<br />
we get them. Now, that is before we have decided an attitude<br />
about them. We are quite happy to get people's views on those<br />
reports. Other people can see them almost as quickly as we do.<br />
Q: Sir, is there anything to announce about your tour to<br />
India or your tour to Africa? Progress at all?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: We're leaving on Sunday the 3rd. It will<br />
take us all day to get there and we ' re leaving on the return<br />
trip from New Delhi just before midnight on Wednesday the 6th,<br />
so we'll be in India for three complete days.<br />
Q: Prime Minister, the Bishop of Sandhurst has advised his<br />
flock not to vote for the Labor Party at the Victorian<br />
elections on the abortion issue. Do you think it's appropriate<br />
for the Bishop of Sandhurst to give this advice, and secondly,<br />
will you be voting on the Abortion Bill on Thursday or will<br />
you have to avoid that ordeal because of the Premiers'<br />
Conference? PRIME MINISTER: I expect, if it's at all possible, to be<br />
voting on the Bill, and I expect that the other Ministers at<br />
the Premiers' Conference will be voting also and in the same<br />
way. I have no comment to make on this Stewart except that<br />
the Bourbons would have been prnud of him.<br />
Q: As Bishop Stewart has advised his flock to vote against<br />
the Labor Party but not against the Bill in the Victorian<br />
State elections, would you consider providing subsidies for<br />
those people who want to indulge in politics outside the Church<br />
in the same way as subsidies are provided for those inside<br />
the Church. I'm thinking of the religious subsidy of rate-free<br />
land etc.?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: The Commonwealth gives no subsidies to any<br />
Church in respect of rate-free land or any other respects. </p>
<p>Q: It does in the A. C. T. perhaps<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Does it I don't think Bishop Stewart<br />
would get a see in the A. C. T.<br />
Q: Today the Government declared the Conciliation and<br />
Arbitration Bill urgent. Do you regard it as being so urgent<br />
and important as to seek a double dissolution if the Opposition<br />
twice rejects it in the Senate?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Yes. This would be a Bill of substance.<br />
Obviously if the Senate were to reject this Bill, then that<br />
is one of the Bills whose rejection we would seriously consider<br />
in the context of a double dissolution.<br />
Q: Mr Wh~ itlam, do you agree that airport development funds<br />
should be withheld from Papua New Guinea if Ansett has<br />
24 per cent of the national airline?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Mr Jones and Mr Morrison are going up to<br />
Port Moresby on Friday of next week to discuss this matter<br />
with Mr Somare. I've nothing further to say on it.<br />
Q: Supplementary to the question on protection policy,<br />
the Department of Secondary Industry is encouraging the<br />
production of industry panels<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Wait till Sir John Crawford has made his<br />
report. Q: You wouldn't favour this ( inaudible).<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No. That's why I've sought advice from<br />
Sir John Crawford on this and other matters. I don't propose<br />
to pre-empt the advice.<br />
Q: Prime Minister, may I seek clarification of an answer<br />
you gave me earlier? I asked you if you believed that<br />
Australia should dictate terms to Papua New Guinea on the<br />
composition of its airline...<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I've got bothing more to say on that.<br />
As I've said...<br />
Q: You don't want to even explain what you said earlier Sir?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I would have thought it was quite clear.<br />
It was to everyone else.<br />
Q: You've said that controls will remain on arms sales<br />
from Australia. What guidelines has the new Government laid<br />
down on arms sales and what restrictions, and could you give<br />
us examples, say, when you sell arms to Brazil, the Philippines,<br />
Taiwan, India, Pakistan...<br />
PRIME MINISTER: The guidelines and the regulations themselves<br />
are unchanged from since last year when we took over.<br />
Q: Sir, can you tell us what sorts of things we couldn't<br />
export to the countries you mentioned before which we now<br />
will be able to export? Can you name some of the goods? </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER: You will remember all the controversy there<br />
was over the steel and tallow in previous years. Permits were<br />
always given for them to be exported but there had to be the<br />
procedure of seeking the permits, so all that the procedure<br />
involved was more paper work. The net result was the same.<br />
Q: Mr Whitlam, on this occasion, you said earlier that you<br />
would be technically the minister in charge of tariffs.<br />
Does that mean that some other Minister or Ministers will be<br />
in practical terms the Minister, or do you take on the burden<br />
of running the whole of the tariff policy on your shoulders?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I've told you the Inter-departmental Committee<br />
will take the burden off my shoulders. My Department will chair<br />
that Committee. This will be a collective responsibility.<br />
Any instrumentality has to be responsible to some specific<br />
minister. The Tariff Board at present is the Protection<br />
Commission I guess will be responsible to the Prime Minister<br />
because the Prime Minister and his Department co-ordinate the<br />
activities where several ministers or several departments are<br />
concerned. Q: Sir, have you reached the stage now where you have<br />
divested yourself of the burden of Foreign Affairs?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No. I find it most exhilarating.<br />
Q: Prime Minister, have you had any response from the<br />
Yugoslav Government to your protest note? Secondly, have you<br />
had any response from the Chinese Government on your protest<br />
note on the nuclear testing?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: The protest to China was oral, so there'd<br />
be no written response. The protest to Yugoslavia was oral<br />
also but it was in terms which were set out by me in writing<br />
and there have been further discussions between our Ambassador<br />
in Belgrade and the Yugoslav Foreign Office on this general<br />
question of dual nationality. Last week it was Wednesday<br />
I think I gave the House the names of some twelve persons<br />
about whom we had sought information from the Yugoslav<br />
authorities ten names I think there were. Eight, as far<br />
as I know information has not yet been given. The other twoit<br />
came out I mentioned one case and there was another case<br />
which came out in the paper the following day. I think there<br />
are still eight cases about which information is still being<br />
sought. I think you were told weren't you after the Cabinet<br />
meeting on Sunday that when the Joint Select Committee on<br />
Foreign Affairs and Defence is established ( I guess it will be<br />
today) I shall be asking it to inquire into the subject of<br />
dual nationality.<br />
Q: Prime Minister, do you expect to have any trouble in<br />
getting the Territorial Sea Bill through the Senate and will<br />
your determination to push ahead with it be affected by<br />
opposition from Labor Premiers, and do you class that legislation<br />
in the same category as the industrial legislation in the context<br />
of a double dissolution?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I would expect that the Senate would pass<br />
the legislation. After all it is the same legislation as the<br />
previous government promised. It was in the Governor-General's </p>
<p>speech opening the last Parliament. It was in the Governor-<br />
General's speech opening this Parliament. I would imagine<br />
therefore that all except half a dozen senators would, one<br />
way or another, have been committed to that legislation.<br />
Accordingly the question of a double dissolution wouldn't<br />
arise. Q: Sir, a two-part question: first of all, some weeks ago<br />
I asked you about whether the Premiers' Conference would be open<br />
to the Press, and you were going to check up on what the<br />
likely thing was going to be. Can you say now whether it's<br />
going to be open or whether you'll be recommending that it will be<br />
open; and secondly, why is the Press conference going to be cut<br />
off after 25 minutes?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: On the first, it's the Premiers' Conference<br />
itself decides whether it's to be open to the Press. I'm quite<br />
happy for it to be open to the Press. The second one, anybody<br />
who's rising is doing so for the second time, including yourself.<br />
Q: There has been quite a bit of discussion in the last week<br />
or so about the Convention which allegedly governs access to<br />
and use of Cabinet documents and ministerial correspondence<br />
and that sort of thing. Could you explain to us your<br />
interpretation of that Convention, as it operates in Australia<br />
and perhaps explain why the Whitehall Convention doesn't<br />
operate here why it's not good enough for Australia?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: The Whitehall Convention applies to Cabinet<br />
documents and it has been observed in Australia. There isn't<br />
a Whitehall Convention concerning correspondence. The<br />
correspondence which has been published bears upon matters<br />
which are of very great public moment. It's obviously of<br />
concern to the public to realise as this correspondence has<br />
revealed that our predecessors were at loggerheads over these<br />
matters which we are tackling unitedly. There can be no doubt<br />
that the correspondence which has been revealed doesn't tally<br />
with what some other Liberal Ministers have now been saying.<br />
Q: Are you prepared to reveal correspondence between your<br />
Ministers? PRIME MINISTER: The question hasn't arisen.<br />
Q: Could I just have your reaction to the Croatian newspaper<br />
report published in America saying that the executions of<br />
three Australians took place on April 10, the day after<br />
Senator Murphy was informed?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: This is a completely unsubstantiated report.<br />
Nobody in fact will take the responsibility of verifying this<br />
journal which is a notoriously polemical journal on the right<br />
in America. I think it is even, I'm told, being investigated<br />
by the F. B. I. </p>
