THE HON. JOHN HOWARD, WP<br />
ADDRESS TO THE PEOPLE WITH PRESIDENT CLINTON<br />
LADY MACQUARIE'S CHAIR SYDNEY<br />
E&amp; OE<br />
Mr President, Mrs Clinton, Mr Bob Carr, Mrs Helena Carr, the Lord Mayor of<br />
Sydney, Councillor Frank Sartor, and many other distinguished guests, Andrew Hoy<br />
the great Captain of the greatest ever Olympic team Australia has yet seen, ladies and<br />
gentlemen. It's a tremendous delight to welcome you Mr President to the oldest, the<br />
most fantastic, the most colourful and certainly the most diverse city in Australia.<br />
Sydney represents so much of the success of the Australian dream. Sydney is<br />
connected with the early beginnings of the penal settlement in New South Wales.<br />
Sydney has grown to be the largest commercial centre in Australia. Sydney has<br />
witnessed the great transformation of the make-up of the Australian community,<br />
particularly since World War LI. And as you look around you Mr President, you will<br />
see the diversity of the Australian community. You will see the old, you will see the<br />
middle aged, you will see the young. You will be reminded of the historical links<br />
between this part of our nation and the earliest beginnings of politics and everything<br />
else that European settlement brought to Australia. You will be reminded of the links<br />
between modem Australia and the indigenous people of Australia. You Will be<br />
reminded of the great waves of migration that have changed for the better the face of<br />
Australia. After World War 1I thousands of people carue to Sydney and settled from countries<br />
like Italy and Greece and more recently the vibrancy of Sydney has been enriched by<br />
the settlement in our city of tens of thousands of new citizens from Asia and those<br />
people have given a particular vitality and a particular lustre. They provide an<br />
extremely valuable link to the region whose future we together are so bound up with<br />
and that is the Asia Pacific Region. The history of our two countries is a very proud<br />
one. The Philadelphia was the first trading vessel to come to Australia in 1792. The<br />
Premier has already spoken of the visit of the great white fleet in 1908. It was at a<br />
little French village in LeHamel on the western front in 1918 that for the first time in<br />
history Australian and American soldiers fought together under the command of the<br />
great Australian Field General of World War 1, Sir John Monash. karo m21/ 11/ 96 17: 44 Pg 1 </p>

In more recent times the commercial investment of American entrepreneurs in Sydney<br />
and in Australia has played a very major role in our economic development. This city<br />
and this nation of ours now hosts the regional headquarters of many large American<br />
companies. And together all of us are working towards that great event in September<br />
of the Year 2000. Mr President, if you do choose to return I shall be delighted to<br />
welcome you again as Prime Mnister of this country. And it is great to have an<br />
American leader with us. As I said in the Parliament yesterday the President of the<br />
United States is always welcome in Australia and always will be welcome in Australia.<br />
He brings with him a reminder of all that we have in common and the most important<br />
thing that we have in common is not bricks and mortar or dollar investments, but the<br />
most important thing that we have in common is a shared sense of values, a shared<br />
belief system, a shared commnitment to the liberty of the individual and a shared<br />
optimism and hope about the future of mankind. Ladies and gentlemen, I give you the<br />
President of the United States of America.<br />
