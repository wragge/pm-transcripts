    <content><![CDATA[<p>I was shocked and deeply saddened to hear this morning of the assassination of Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic of Serbia. On behalf of the Australian Government and people I offer my most sincere condolences to his family and the Serbian people for the tragic loss of a greatly respected leader.</p>
<p>Dr Djindjic was a courageous politician who did much to advance the causes of democracy and reform in Serbia. He will be remembered particularly for his resolve in handing over Slobodan Milosevic to the Hague to face justice before the International Criminal Tribunal for Yugoslavia.</p>
<p>I encourage the Government of Serbia to maintain the commitment of Dr Djindjic to fight corruption and organised crime. Political violence threatens the peace and security of all, and is intolerable in a democratic society. I hope that the perpetrators of this heinous crime are swiftly brought to justice.</p>
