The Australian Government will join the World Bank's Program for Economic Resilience, Investment and Social Assistance in Indonesia (PERISAI) by providing a contingent loan along with the Asian Development Bank and the World Bank.   </p>
<p>This stand-by loan facility is designed to be a financing option of last resort, and can only be accessed if Indonesia's circumstances deteriorate markedly. </p>
<p>The loan is similar to the loan facilities made available during the Asian financial crisis in 1997-1998, and during the global financial crisis, neither of which were drawn upon.</p>
<p>Australia's contribution of a $1 billion standby loan facility forms part of a package of international contingent loans to Indonesia of up to US$5.5 billion.</p>
<p>In the unlikely event that the facility is drawn upon, it would be repaid with interest and would not impact on the Commonwealth's budget bottom line.</p>
<p>Continued global uncertainty means that even countries with responsible macroeconomic and banking policies such as Indonesia are being impacted.</p>
<p>In light of this, we welcome Indonesia's proactive steps to safeguard their economic stability and their adoption of sound economic policies.</p>
<p>Australia is a close friend and neighbour of Indonesia. In this Asian century, we have a clear interest in ensuring growing economies in our region remain strong.</p>
<p>The Government will continue to support Indonesia to secure the country's continued economic prospects and ensure a stable and prosperous region more broadly. </p>
