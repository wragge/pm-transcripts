FIRST CONVENTION OF THiE YOUNG AUSTRALIAN<br />
FOUNDATION<br />
WILSON HALL, UNIVERSITY OF MELBOURNE,<br />
MELBOURNE. 11TH MARCHi-1966.<br />
Speech by the Prime Minister, Mr. Harold Holt<br />
Good Evening to you all, and that includes our dissident group<br />
outside. This actually makes me feel very much at home because<br />
the first campaign I ever took part in was in the electorate of<br />
Yarra against the then Labor Prime Minister, or former Prime<br />
Minister, Mr. Scullin, and I remember that night, which was in<br />
the middle of the depression, coming to the hall and finding<br />
that nobody there was prepared to hear what I had to say.<br />
And thinking about tonight as I came along here, I marvelled at<br />
the contrast in circumstances which this generation faces<br />
compared with the generation of which I was a part in my own<br />
university days at this institution. Now I don't know whether<br />
our friends outside arc--students of the university. I hope<br />
not because thoy have not yet learnt that noise is no effective<br />
answer to argument not logical argument, in any event. And<br />
I would hope that as time goes on because my stamina for these<br />
matters, assisted by these mechanical devices is very much<br />
greater than theirs they will learn a few things which will<br />
be of interest to them.<br />
Now ladies and gentlemen, I suggest that you ignore<br />
the people outside and just concentrate on what I have to put<br />
to you because you can hear me and, thanks to this instrument,<br />
I can get over to you, and I came here tonight to speak to you,<br />
or those who are willing to hear what I might have to say.<br />
And I thought quite hard about accepting this invitation because<br />
it came in the first week of the Parliament. It was a particularly<br />
heavy week and normally I'd have been disposed to say,<br />
" Sorry, there's rather too much to do this week. Perhaps we<br />
could try another time". Then I remembered back to my own days,<br />
of which you are the corresponding generation, and I recall how<br />
hard it was to get young people interested in the comm~ unity and<br />
political affairs of their country. The only reason, I thir~ k,<br />
why I came into politics when I did was that this country was<br />
in such a state of economic disaster, a condition which nobody<br />
of this generation, I think, could even visualise. There has<br />
been only one month in the last sixteen years when the registrants<br />
for employment exceeded 3 per cent., and that was in the normal<br />
low seasonal demand month of January some years ago 3 per cent.<br />
In the year of which I speak, the registrations were 30 per cent.<br />
Thirty out of every 100 trade unionists registered with the<br />
various unions were unable to get any regular paid employment<br />
at that time. And every generation has to face up to its own<br />
set of problems and challengus and we in my day had to face up<br />
to the problem of economic organisation. We had just come out<br />
of a war, and the dislocation of war was still upon us and the<br />
clouds of the next world war were gathering ominously above us,<br />
but we learn through our expceriences how to master, very<br />
considerably, the economic problems. </p>
<p>It's true we have fluctuations. People get concerned<br />
about recessions as they see them appearing or disappearing in<br />
the economic field, but here we have had a remarkable experience<br />
going on now for the best part of twenty years in which Australia<br />
has known this full employment situation, this condition of what<br />
is termed in modern times, the affluent society. That doesn't<br />
mean that your generation doesn't have the same set of tough<br />
problems which you have to face. And it is a heartening thing<br />
to somebody who has given more than half his own life in the<br />
service of the National Parliament to find that a new generation<br />
of young Australians is prepared to come together as you are in<br />
this organisation and face up to the possibilities of service<br />
which lie open to you, face up to the task of analysing as calmly<br />
and sensibly as you can, the national problems, those affecting<br />
you directly, those in which you can play some part in helping<br />
your country along. And because I believe that is the essence<br />
of the objectives that you have outlined for this organisation,<br />
I felt that here was something to be encouraged and here was an<br />
organisation which could at least feel from its foundation that<br />
it enjoyed the warm approval and commendation of the government<br />
of its own country. And so I am here to demonstrate that.<br />
I am also here to tell you something which I found of<br />
interest to myself and that is that there are so many of you.<br />
I don't know whether you realise it but more than 50 per cent.<br />
of the Australian population is 30 years of age or under, and<br />
so the young Australian represents the majority of Australians,<br />
and it is about time, I thought, you saw another Prime Minister.<br />
Most of you have only seen one in your lifetime. I suppose I<br />
am now the second. I can assure you that you will have an<br />
opportunity to see a third. I have no intention of establishing<br />
any endurance records despite the encouragement of Herb Elliott's<br />
presence with us here tonight. In fact, I had looked rather<br />
enviously at Herb because he combines in himself, speed, stamina<br />
and lightness on his feet. Now what better combination could<br />
a politician hope for than that set of qualities, but while Ican't<br />
guarantee that I shall remain for any length of time<br />
corresponding to that of Sir Robert, nor would you probably be<br />
wishing that, I find it difficult to predict at the moment whom<br />
my successor will be.<br />
Here we are concerned with the great problem of which<br />
we have had an echo from the attendance of our friends outside.<br />
I have no desire to convert this gathering into a political<br />
occasion but I think that you are entitled, having regard to the<br />
obligations that the Government imposes upon you, to hear an<br />
explanation at first hand as to why these things have been<br />
believed to be necessary, and so while there are a few other<br />
matters I would like to mention to you tonight, perhaps it<br />
would be useful if before we get the whole issue clouded with<br />
emotion anC political propaganda, I could just give a few facts<br />
about this issue first of Australia's participation in the<br />
campaign in South Viet Nam, and secondly to tell you the reasons<br />
why we found it necessary to adopt a particular method of service<br />
in relation to the army and the incidence of this, how it works<br />
out. I say I believe this to be necessary because I have little<br />
doubt in my own mind that given the facts, the Australian community<br />
is quite capable of coming to a sound and sensible decision,<br />
but if people refuse to study the facts, then who can foretell<br />
the kind of decision that they in their public judgments will<br />
find themselves coming to. </p>
<p>I don't think that anybody who has made a study of<br />
contemporary history could really be in much doubt or remain<br />
there for a long time about the issue in South Viet Nam. I<br />
know that there are some people who profess that this is a civil<br />
war and that the rest of us should keep out of it and let the<br />
citizens decide this issue for themselves. But anybody who<br />
speaks in those terms has either q~ jpletely ignored or forgotten<br />
contemporary history in relation/ Malaya, Korea, Taiwan and<br />
various other parts of Asia which even at this moment are currently<br />
feeling the pressures and probes of the Communist expansion.<br />
Even India, peace-loving India, is finding itself at this moment<br />
confronted on its boundaries with thrusting Communist pressures.<br />
Even in Thailand, which offers no threat to China or any interest<br />
of China's, I learned from the mouth of the Prime Minister of<br />
that country only a week or so ago that they are at the present<br />
time under pressure in their north, in their east, and in their<br />
west from Chinese communist expansion. And when one knows<br />
these things and has all the evidence of what occurred in Korea,<br />
the fact that but for the strength of American resistance, Taiwan<br />
woulO have been overrun by the Chinese communists also. And<br />
now here in this critical area of South East Asia, a great<br />
struggle, a struggle involving your freedom and my freedom and<br />
the freedom of free peoples everywhere throughout the world is<br />
occurring. Now, I would have thought that this was plain enough;<br />
whatever one might decide as to what ought to be done about it,<br />
the broad fac* t-s surely are plain enough and the evidence surely<br />
has accumulated sufficiently to convince the most doubting that<br />
whether you like it or not or approve of it or not, the thrust<br />
is the thrust of the communist movement inspired and directed<br />
from Peking and carrying through its campaigning the ideological<br />
challenge of Peking, the challenge of its philosophy of world<br />
domination for a world that is given to communism.<br />
Now we can understand people differing from our own<br />
ideas. We happen to believe in the virtues of a free society<br />
and of people having the maximum freedom available to them under<br />
laws of their own making. You and I enjoy that kind of democracy.<br />
Our friends outside here enjoy that kind of democracy. otherwise<br />
they wouldn't be here tonight. And a robust democracy doesn't<br />
discard or repress its minorities. It gives them the opportunity<br />
for expression and so I, ladies and gentlemen, believe that as<br />
the facts unfold, the Australian people will realise as I am sure<br />
they do now, the essential character of the struggle that is<br />
going on in South Viet Nam. Have we all forgotten quite as<br />
quickly as would seem to be the case with some that this country<br />
and the United Kingdom and other Commonwealth countries had to<br />
maintain a campaign for, I think it was, 15 years in Malaya in<br />
order to suppress Communist guerrilla activity in that country.<br />
If you go to Malaya, or Malaysia as it is called at the present<br />
time, you will find a well-ordered community, a people functioning<br />
under a Parliamentary democracy, steadily improving their own<br />
economic and social standards. Now this country was saved, as<br />
South Korea was saved, as Taiwan has been saved from communist<br />
domination because there were people who were prepared to join<br />
with those who were under threat, who were facing aggression,<br />
people who were prepared to join with them in resisting that<br />
aggression. </p>
<p>And you~ know, there are people even in this country<br />
who have plenty of cause to be grateful to the United States<br />
for the defence given to freedom throughout the world but who<br />
either refuse to see that it was the critical United States aid<br />
in Korea when the United States stood alone which saved Korea;<br />
but for the United States' willingness to resist agression, if<br />
it came to Taiwan, there would be no Taiwan, or Formosa as we<br />
used to name it, and there would be, had America not stood firm<br />
in its resolution, no South Viet Nam.<br />
Australia has a proud tradition of service beyond its<br />
own shores in the cause of freedom. In two world wars, this<br />
country sustained nearly half a million casualties, fighting<br />
for the issue of freedom in those great contests. We lost more<br />
men in casualties, killed from war action, in the First World<br />
War, than did the whole of the United States. So we don't<br />
take an isolationist view of life. Where the threat exists,<br />
there the threat must be resisted and we have joined freely and<br />
willingly those of like mind to ourselves in resisting that kind<br />
of threat. And this is why we are in South Viet Nam. We<br />
believe that if South Viet Nam were to fall, it would only be a<br />
matter of time before the whole of South-East Asia fell and<br />
Australia came directly under physical threat itself. These<br />
are not fanciful beliefs but they are the views of the most<br />
experienced men in the public life of your country, acting on<br />
the most expert advice that they can secure from their<br />
diplomatic sources, from their military sources and from the<br />
senior administrative personalities who conduct the government<br />
of this country through the Departments of State of this country.<br />
And I ask you to bear that in mind as you gather in some<br />
newspaper editorial and are asked to accept the judgment of<br />
that particular paper. The judgment we ask you to accept is<br />
the judgment of yoar freely-elected representatives, many of<br />
them with many years of experience of government, acting, I<br />
repeat, on the best advice they can secure and the best<br />
information they can obtain, and they being in a better position<br />
than anybody else in this country to secure that advice and to<br />
obtain that information.<br />
Now we in Australia have remained secure. Secure far<br />
more so than most other countries of the world because of the<br />
alliances to which we are a party. We entered, some years ago,<br />
into an alliance we and New Zealand with the United States<br />
of America. It is a mutual pact against aggression on any one<br />
of us, and so long as that pact endures, Australia enjoys the<br />
guarantee of its security against attack by the forces and<br />
strength of the mightiest power in the history of mankind.<br />
And when we know this, and we know that the issue<br />
which the Americans are facing in South Viet Nam is an issuie<br />
which involves Australia even more immediately and directly than<br />
the United States of America itself which isn't under the same<br />
physical threat that we would be, then I wonder what our critics<br />
have in mind as an alternative policy for this country. I have<br />
yet to hear it. I have yet to hear a clear, coherent alternative<br />
put to the policy being pursued by the government of this<br />
country. And who do our noisy friends outside expect to do<br />
the fighting for Australia? Do they want to fight to the last<br />
Crop of American blood or do they expect Australia to carry its<br />
own share of obligation in resisting these challenges which </p>
<p>involve us as they involve our Allies in this great cause.<br />
And I wouldI have very much mistaken the generation of young<br />
Australians to which you belong if I concludeOd that this<br />
generation had no wish to play its own part in the defence of<br />
its own country andL for the common cause of freedom throughout<br />
the world. But it was so unlike the generations of earlier<br />
Australians who gave their service in meeting these challenges<br />
that it wasn't prepared to face up to the obligations which<br />
came to it in its own day and age. Well, I don't believe<br />
that for a moment. I believe that this generation of young<br />
Australians and I don't say this because I am at such a<br />
gathering tonight; I have said it publicly on more than one<br />
occasion I say that this generation, I believe, is the finest<br />
generation this country has produced. You are a better<br />
educated lot, you are a better trained lot, and in many respects,<br />
despite current evidence to the contrary, I think you are a<br />
better mannered lot than my own generation at the university.<br />
But now, having just said something in outline of the<br />
issue there, let me take up this matter for a few minutes, of<br />
the National Service obligation. This country has fortunately<br />
not found it necessary in the past to call on people conscripted<br />
into service in time of war except, of course, for the limited<br />
operation in the Second World War to a defined area around<br />
Australia, and in both the other Services, in the Air Force and<br />
the Navy, we have secured all the volunteers necessary. This<br />
is rather contradictory to those who say that there can't be<br />
very much interest in the issue facing the Government at this<br />
time. Both these services are up to their complement, working<br />
on a voluntary basis of enlistment.<br />
Now with the Army, although the conditions of service<br />
in the Army and the pay are by no means unattractive indeed<br />
in the lower paid ranks of the Army I believe I am correct in<br />
saying that the rates are the highest of any army in the world,<br />
not excluding the United States of America and it is of interest<br />
to know, and I report this to you, that our Army personnel have<br />
been displaying a very high rate of re-engagement. They enlist<br />
for six years and they have an option of re-engagement at the end<br />
of that time, and 70 per cent. of those who have come to the end<br />
of their period of service have offered to remain on on a reengagement.<br />
So there is not a picture there of a people<br />
dissatisfied with their lot or finding conditions outside so much<br />
more attractive that they hasten to leave the Service. On the<br />
contrary. But the Army I think very properly has insisted<br />
on a very high standard of physical condition and mental capacity<br />
on the part of those offering to join the Army, and you will have<br />
heard of the very high rate of rejection, so that I think only<br />
about one in five of those volunteering has actually been<br />
enlisted and trained in the Army.<br />
Now in order to maintain the strength in what is not an<br />
expeditionary force in time of war in the sense we knew it in<br />
World War I and II when people enlisted for the duration and had<br />
no idea of how long they would be away for, and in the result were<br />
away for four or five years at a time, many of them, the<br />
obligation of National Service is clear and precise and its<br />
termination is clearly known by the National Service trainee when<br />
he is taken into the Army. on the expert advice of our Chief </p>
<p>of Staf f of the Army, we were told at the time that this was<br />
the oniy effective way in which we could get the numbers of men<br />
of the right quality for our own regular army service. And the<br />
Government took its decision very responsibly. We made its<br />
implications quite clear.<br />
When Mr. Calwell says now he wants a referendum on<br />
this issue, he overlooks the fact that at the time the bill was<br />
introduced into the Parliament, the conditions of service were<br />
made amply clear, and so he said at the S-,-nate election which<br />
followed, " We'll make that the issue of the election" 3 and the<br />
election was largely fought around that particular issue. So<br />
the Australian public has been well aware of what is involved<br />
in this. But propaganda can create a quite misleading picture.<br />
I heard over the news tonight for example that some 81,000<br />
registrants were involved this year in the scheme. Nobody went<br />
on to say that the total to be taken in to the Army from this<br />
80,000-odd would be just over 8,000. In other words, one in<br />
ten approximately of those of that particular age group, would<br />
be finally taken into the ranks of the Army. Nobody went on<br />
to say that so far as the obligation to serve in South Viet Nain<br />
is involved, the total force to be sent is under 4,500. The<br />
National Service component would be of the order of 30 per cent.<br />
In other words, out of more than 80,000 young men of twenty at<br />
this time, not more than about 1,350 would be in service in<br />
South Viet Nain at any one time, and the period of service being<br />
in total two years and the period of training occupying from six<br />
to nine months, the tour of duty in South Viet Namn being limited<br />
to one year, the National Servicemen there at any one time would<br />
be of the order that I have mentioned, just about 1/ 60th or<br />
1/ 70th part of the total of young men of that age group and a<br />
period of service limited in the result to one year in that<br />
particular theatre.<br />
Now, nobody likes a policy of this kind, of course,<br />
but having regard to the issues for one's own country, can it<br />
be said that an Australian Government is placing an unduly heavy<br />
burden for the security of the nation upon any particular<br />
section of its citizens. However, that is our view of the<br />
fairness of it and of the limitations of numbers and of period<br />
of service imposed under the scheme and I hope that these facts<br />
will remain clear in the minds at least of people like yourselves<br />
when the propaganda and the emotion which will be such a feature<br />
of the coming months has served to obscure in the minds of most<br />
people just what is involved.<br />
Now I really feel I should apologise to you for spending<br />
so much time on these particular matters but they are of great<br />
concern to your own generation and they are of tremendous public<br />
interest to Australians as a whole, but that wasn't what I<br />
expected I would be talking about to you when I first accepted<br />
your invitation because I felt that here was an opportunity to<br />
explore together for a few minutes the other directions in which<br />
a young generation of Australians can these days make an<br />
effective contribution to the national welfare and to the national<br />
security because while we have been talking about the grimmer<br />
side, the military side of facing the threats we see around us,<br />
there is a positive side to the opportunities which lie ahead<br />
in which an Australian nation can serve the area of which we are<br />
a part, an area in which Australia is finding itself increasingly </p>
<p>of growingT prestige and stature and of growing interest to the<br />
countries around us. And this interest proceeds partly from<br />
the fact that we have had to face up to a tough job of<br />
development and most of the countries to our north are<br />
themselves going through periods of development of their own<br />
resources and struggling with the fundamentals of economic<br />
organisation. Now they see here a country of less than 12<br />
million people who have built up one of the highest standards<br />
of living in the world, a country in which less than 12 million<br />
people are developing a continent the size of the United States,<br />
and they are turning to us for guidance in various ways. We<br />
get a request for technicians and professional people in all<br />
manner of fields. At one time we were asked to supply, for<br />
example, the Governor of the Reserve Bank of Malaysia. We get<br />
medical teams in the field, technicians going up to help with<br />
agricultural ( next portion lost while tapes were being changed)<br />
increasingly services by intelligent young Australian men<br />
and women who are going into the public service of Papua and New<br />
Guinea, helping to build the country up with standards of<br />
education, help that will enable the people to lead civilised<br />
lives in a modern well-organised community.<br />
And so there are these fields of service open for the<br />
young Australian. We are, as I have stressed, and is so evident<br />
to you from your own studies, increasingly involved these days<br />
in the affairs of Asia and we have to learn to live sensibly in<br />
a friendly and helpful way with people who have different habits<br />
of life from ourselves, different attitudes, different religious<br />
faiths, people who in some ways are very unlike us but in other<br />
ways share with us the great objectives in terms of human<br />
principle that we have established here in our own country, and<br />
so here in our own day anO generation, we face our own particular<br />
challenge. In my day, we looked to the United Kingdom and the<br />
strength of the British Navy. People thought in terms of the<br />
British Isles as home. Here, while our affection remains from<br />
the lands of our kith and our kin for most of us that has been<br />
the situation we have now realised that Australia has a<br />
national independent entity of its own and that Australia faces<br />
problems and has obligations which are quite unlike anything<br />
the earlier generations of Australians had to meet. And so<br />
we can't offer you a tremendous amount by way of guidance because<br />
a precedent hasn't been able to serve us for the kind of<br />
situations we now face. But what we and I speak now for the<br />
older generation of Australians do offer to you is a comradeship<br />
together as we face the difficulties and at the same time the<br />
fantastic possibilities that we see ahead of a growing nation.<br />
Over the next ten years, there will be vast mineral<br />
projects opened up on this continent that will focus the<br />
attention of the world on what is going on in Australia. We<br />
have a vast treasure store of basic minerals in quantity excelling<br />
that certainly of most other countries and in some instances<br />
ranking among the highest sources of supply in the world our<br />
bauxite, our iron ore, which up to a few years ago were not even<br />
known to us for their existence. And as these things open up,<br />
as our own great resources expand, we in Australia will be </p>
<p>sharing in the growth of a nation assuming an increasingly<br />
important part in the affairs of the world. Even today we<br />
have an influence out of all relationship to our numbers and<br />
our material strength. We can take pride in that. It is an<br />
inheritance that the service of Australians i'ho have gone<br />
before us have built for our enjoyment and for our strength and<br />
you in turn must accept the obligations as you accept the<br />
opportunities of this wonderful country in which we live.<br />
I would hope from time to time to be able to follow<br />
the development of the work of this organisation but at least<br />
your objectives commend themselves so highly to us that you have<br />
the warmest good wishes of the members of my own Government for<br />
your future success, and we hope from this Foundation there will<br />
be a growing body of responsible Australian men and women able<br />
to play an increasing part in the various fields of national<br />
leadership, in the politics of the nation, in the professions,<br />
in the public service and in the economic and community life<br />
of Australia. It is to the people that you represent here<br />
tonight that we look to carry on the tasks and the opportunities<br />
which open up such a great and promising vista for all of us to<br />
enjoy together the privilege of Australian nationhood. </p>
