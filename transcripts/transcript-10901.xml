    <content><![CDATA[<p>E&amp;OE..........................................................................................................................</p>
<p>Thank you very much my Parliamentary colleague, Paul Marek, to Councillor</p>
<p> McRae the Mayor of Rockhampton, to Senator Ian Macdonald, to Vince</p>
<p> Lester, other councillors, other distinguished guest, ladies and gentlemen.</p>
<p>It is a tremendous delight for me to be here in Rockhampton, to be</p>
<p> visiting the electorate of Capricornia which Paul Marek won for the</p>
<p> Coalition and won for the National Party at the last election. And</p>
<p> I want in the few moments that I intend to speak to you today to share</p>
<p> a few thoughts with you about some issues that are very important,</p>
<p> not only to central Queensland, but also to our entire nation.</p>
<p>But before I do that, let me say that I had planned to come to Rockhampton</p>
<p> some time ago because I set myself a goal when I became Prime Minister</p>
<p> of making certain that I communicated very directly to the people</p>
<p> of rural and regional Australia that mine was not just a Government</p>
<p> that governs to the people of Canberra, Melbourne and Sydney but,</p>
<p> in fact, is a Government which governs people who live in the regional</p>
<p> and rural areas of Australia.</p>
<p>And can I say to you, my fellow Australians, that I am very conscious,</p>
<p> as Prime Minister, of the particular challenges, of the particular</p>
<p> concerns, of the particular needs of rural and regional Australia.</p>
<p> I know that many of you have lived by the produce of your land. I</p>
<p> know that this area of central Queensland boasts to us the great export</p>
<p> industries of Australia, the cattle industry and the coal industry.</p>
<p> I know the particular difficulties that the former industry is going</p>
<p> through. I know that this gathering of more than 500 Australians understand</p>
<p> probably better than any other gathering of 500 Australians anywhere</p>
<p> in our country just how much we are at the mercy of a fiercely competitive</p>
<p> world and no matter how efficient you are, no matter how productive</p>
<p> you are, if you live in a competitive world environment then you can</p>
<p> win or lose a market according to the vagaries of the weather and</p>
<p> according to the vagaries of international trade.</p>
<p>Now I don't come to you today as professing some kind of naive</p>
<p> belief that everything is easy for you. I understand the problems</p>
<p> of many of your industries and I am filled with admiration for the</p>
<p> stoic ways which many of you have survived through very hard times</p>
<p> and have continued to do so. But I am very mindful of the continuing</p>
<p> impact of drought, although in the last few days the faces of smiles</p>
<p> on that particular front. I am nonetheless very conscious of the impact</p>
<p> the drought has had on the livelihood and the lives and hopes and</p>
<p> the aspirations of many people in this hall.</p>
<p>Another reason why I wanted to come here was to pay tribute to your</p>
<p> Federal Parliamentary representative. Paul Marek has been an outstandingly</p>
<p> successful Federal representative for the seat of Capricornia over</p>
<p> the last two years. Paul has brought to his representation to the</p>
<p> electorate, he has brought an earthy understanding of the hopes and</p>
<p> the aspirations of the men and women of this area. He doesn't</p>
<p> come with what some people would call, a typical Coalition background.</p>
<p> He has a trade union background, and I am very proud that my Coalition</p>
<p> Government includes in its ranks people who have served as members</p>
<p> of trade unions and it's pretty relevant to a debate we are having</p>
<p> at a moment and I'll come to that just in jiff but, of course,</p>
<p> nothing will stop me from coming from it.</p>
<p>But ladies and gentlemen, what it demonstrates to you is that we are</p>
<p> a party for all Australians. We are a Coalition for all Australians.</p>
<p> We're not just a Coalition to pose for the lawyers and farmers</p>
<p> and doctors and business men and women and graziers and pastoralists.</p>
<p> We are a party, a coalition, the two parties, the Liberal Party and</p>
<p> the National Party who represent a broad cross-section of the Australian</p>
<p> community. And one of the proudest things that I was able to say on</p>
<p> the night of the 2nd of March 1996 when I knew that the people of</p>
<p> Australia had elected me as Prime Minister, was that I could go into</p>
<p> the Prime Minister's job beholden to no one special interest</p>
<p> or pressure group in Australia. I knew that I could go into the Prime</p>
<p> Ministership with a commitment to defer to the best of my ability</p>
<p> all of the people of Australia.</p>
<p>And unlike the Labor Party, which is still, and we are seeing it played</p>
<p> out very dramatically at the present time, still bound hand and foot</p>
<p> to the trade union movement, unable to articulate the national interest</p>
<p> when certain issues arise. I was able to go into the Lodge and become</p>
<p> the Prime Minister in this wonderful country of ours owing allegiance</p>
<p> to no one special group and having a special obligation to serve to</p>
<p> the best of my ability and that of my colleagues, all of the people</p>
<p> of Australia. And I remain very proud of the fact that we answer to</p>
<p> nobody other than to the collective of the people of Australia and</p>
<p> that will always be the approach that we take and it will always guide</p>
<p> the individual decisions that we make.</p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen, Paul mentioned in the course of his introduction,</p>
<p> the financial measures that we have taken since we were elected in</p>
<p> March of last year. It is true that when we came into Government there</p>
<p> was an accumulated Federal Government debt of between $95 and $100</p>
<p> billion, and it was also true that we inherited an annual budget deficit</p>
<p> of $10.5 billion and I am very pleased to say when Peter Costello</p>
<p> brings down the Budget in May of this year, in just under four weeks</p>
<p> time, we will be able to tell the people of Australia that on an annual</p>
<p> basis we are once again back in the black. That we have turned that</p>
<p> annual deficit of $10.5 billion into a surplus, that we have done</p>
<p> the most important thing that any Government must do if it wants to</p>
<p> lay the basis of individual prosperity and that is to lay the basis</p>
<p> of national prosperity. And getting a budget deficit eliminated is</p>
<p> no sort of abstract economic arid exercise. It has dramatically beneficial</p>
<p> consequences for the whole community. Does any person in this hall</p>
<p> imagine that we wouldn't have been more severely buffeted, that</p>
<p> we wouldn't have been more heavily damaged by the downturn that</p>
<p> has occurred in the Asian Pacific region if we had not taken the action</p>
<p> we did two years ago to get our national accounts in order. Does anybody</p>
<p> imagine that we would have been able to insulate ourselves as well</p>
<p> as we have. I don't pretend that there won't be some impact</p>
<p> of the Asian downturn, of course there will be. But it would have</p>
<p> been immeasurably greater and the damage to Australia vaster if we</p>
<p> had not taken hold of the economic situation that we inherited and</p>
<p> every week that now goes by I think drives home to these people of</p>
<p> Australia that if we had not taken some of the decisions that we did</p>
<p> take when we came to Office two years ago, if we had simply said what's</p>
<p> 10.5 billion dollars a year, what's 95 to 100 billion dollars</p>
<p> accumulated over a period of years? Let's not worry about it,</p>
<p> let's borrow some more, let's spend up big, something will</p>
<p> turn up to save Australia again. If we had taken that sort of careless</p>
<p> indifferent attitude, I can say to you my friends that the economics</p>
<p> staring us in the face now, given what has happened in the Asia Pacific</p>
<p> region, would have been far more daunting and far more damaging than</p>
<p> what has turned out to be the case.</p>
<p>But, of course, it hasn't stopped there, not only have we protected</p>
<p> Australia and strengthened Australia against the ravages of the Asian</p>
<p> economic downturn, but we have, because we have reduced our own borrowing,</p>
<p> and our own debt, we have brought about the most substantial reductions</p>
<p> in interest rates that this country has seen both on the housing scene</p>
<p> and now, thankfully, in the business area, the most substantial reductions</p>
<p> in interest rates that Australia has experienced for the last 30 or</p>
<p> 40 years. Housing interest rates are now at their lowest levels since</p>
<p> the late 1960s. It is, in the words of Peter Costello, possible to</p>
<p> say that we have the lowest housing interest rates since man first</p>
<p> walked on the moon.</p>
<p>And if you accept that the average housing loan around Australia,</p>
<p> and this is the case, is $100,000, the average mortgage on a home</p>
<p> is $100,000, the saving is worth about $300 a month or the equivalent,</p>
<p> if you are an employee, of getting a $100 a week rise from your employer.</p>
<p>Now that is the measure of the reduction in housing interest rates</p>
<p> that has occurred and that is directly attributable to the fact we</p>
<p> have reduced the deficit. If we had not reduced the deficit, those</p>
<p> housing interest rates would not have come down. Now I am very happy</p>
<p> to say that that fall in housing interest rates is now starting to</p>
<p> be matched by a fall in business overdraft rates. And in the last</p>
<p> couple of weeks the two largest banks in Australia, Westpac and the</p>
<p> Commonwealth Bank have announced significant reductions in their business</p>
<p> overdraft rates and all I can say to you is that if you are a customer</p>
<p> of either of those banks, I'd go along and get the details. And</p>
<p> if you are a customer of any other lending institution, I'd go</p>
<p> along and say to them why aren't you doing what Westpac and the</p>
<p> Commonwealth are doing? Because competition in the financial sector</p>
<p> is what it's all about and I look forward to the day when the</p>
<p> same reduction in housing interest rates are flowing through to the</p>
<p> small business and to the farming area and once again on a $100,000</p>
<p> benchmark, $100,000 loan benchmark, the interest savings under the</p>
<p> proposals announced by both Westpac and the Commonwealth amount to</p>
<p> interest savings of about $4,000 a year.</p>
<p>Now I know that getting interest rates down is not the only thing</p>
<p> that people in rural and regional Australia want, and I know that</p>
<p> there are many other things that are needed, but over long years of</p>
<p> discussion with people on the land and people in small businesses,</p>
<p> I have come to know that the cost of borrowing money is one of the</p>
<p> greatest obstacles of prosperity and to expansion and that constantly</p>
<p> people have said to me it's all right for housing interest rates</p>
<p> to come down but unless you can get some reduction in business interest</p>
<p> rates, or interest rates on our farming property, we are not being</p>
<p> able to see around the next corner. Now I am very happy to say, my</p>
<p> friends, that as a result of the development that I've outlined,</p>
<p> we are starting to see the light at the end of the tunnel, not only</p>
<p> in the housing interest rate area but also, very importantly and very</p>
<p> critically for this audience, in small business and farming area.</p>
<p>Now ladies and gentlemen, I want to say a couple of things about two</p>
<p> issues that Paul touched on. One of them, of course, is the quite</p>
<p> important issue of reform of Australian waterfront. And right at the</p>
<p> moment we are witnessing one of the most important and potentially</p>
<p> one of the most beneficial developments in Australia's long industrial</p>
<p> relations history that we could possibly experience. And there is</p>
<p> only one issue at stake in relation to the waterfront and that is</p>
<p> whether or not Australia is to have a world competitive, a world productive</p>
<p> and a world leading waterfront. That is the issue, it's not about</p>
<p> anything else and the single objective of my Government is to give</p>
<p> to this country an efficient, productive and competitive watefront.</p>
<p>And all of you as producers and exporters will know that the unproductive</p>
<p> character of the Australian waterfront, is not something that has</p>
<p> arrived in the last few months, it's not something that's</p>
<p> arrived in the last few years. It's even not something that's</p>
<p> arrived in the last 10 or 20 years. It is something which has been</p>
<p> with this country for as long as just about the oldest person in this</p>
<p> room can remember. It's almost been part and parcel of an understanding</p>
<p> of the economic difficulties that face Australia. It's been part</p>
<p> of the folklore almost, that this country has been bedevilled by an</p>
<p> unproductive waterfront.</p>
<p>Governments in the past have talked about it. Governments in the past</p>
<p> have sat down with the Maritime Union to discuss this. Governments</p>
<p> in the past have presided over the expenditure of hundreds of millions</p>
<p> of dollars to try and solve the problem. My Government in fulfilment</p>
<p> of a very solemn commitment that we made, and there's nothing</p>
<p> strange about the fact that I and my Government are committed for</p>
<p> reforming the Australian waterfront. We've been talking about</p>
<p> doing that for years. We finally got the opportunity when we were</p>
<p> elected in March of 1996 and the first thing we had to do was to change</p>
<p> the law because unless you were willing to change the law it wouldn't</p>
<p> have been possible for what has occurred over recent weeks to occur.</p>
<p>And we did change the law. We changed the law to make it possible</p>
<p> for union monopolies to be broken. I have no quarrel with trade unionism.</p>
<p> I have no quarrel with trade unionists. I believe in freedom of association.</p>
<p> I believe it is the birthright of any man or women in Australia to</p>
<p> join a union or not to join a union, but I don't believe it is</p>
<p> the birthright of any group of Australians to hold the rest of the</p>
<p> country to ransom. I don't believe it is the birthright of any</p>
<p> group of Australians to impose uncompetitive and anti-productive practices</p>
<p> on aspects of our economy. And to hear some of the complaints of the</p>
<p> Maritime Union of Australia in recent days, one would think that they</p>
<p> imagine that all of us have collective amnesia. We are invited to</p>
<p> forget to the fact that year in and year out they held the economy</p>
<p> to ransom. We are invited to forget the fact that they set out a few</p>
<p> months ago to destroy the very livelihood of the business that employed</p>
<p> them, that they have year in and year out maintained the right to</p>
<p> exert a ruthless union monopoly that no other section of the trade</p>
<p> union movement in the modern age has the temerity to exert or the</p>
<p> temerity to claim.</p>
<p>Now that is the background, but what is at stake, it is only one thing</p>
<p> and that is whether in the competitive world of the 21st Century,</p>
<p> that world that you as producers and exporters understand only too</p>
<p> well, whether we are to be equipped with a world competitive productive</p>
<p> waterfront or whether we are to tie one hand and one arm of every</p>
<p> producer in Australia behind his or her back and say well you can</p>
<p> slave your heart out on your farm, you can have the most productive</p>
<p> enterprise, you can have the most marvellously sought after export</p>
<p> but unless it gets across the wharves or it comes through the wharves</p>
<p> and unless it can occur in those circumstances in a productive, in</p>
<p> a competitive way, you are not going to be successful and you are</p>
<p> not going to survive in business.</p>
<p>Now that is what is at stake. It's a simple question of whether</p>
<p> we are as a nation going to claim the right to have a productive and</p>
<p> a competitive waterfront. Because if we can claim that right, if we</p>
<p> do bring that about, then that will generate more Australian jobs,</p>
<p> it will generate more export income for Australia and it will attract</p>
<p> more business investment both domestically and from overseas into</p>
<p> Australia. And that is the issue which is involved, nothing more,</p>
<p> indeed, nothing less. Whether Australia is going to remove one of</p>
<p> the last great impediments for her international economic success</p>
<p> and one of those last great impediments to Australia's international</p>
<p> economic success is the unproductive, the appallingly uncompetitive</p>
<p> character of the Australian waterfront.</p>
<p>And I don't think there's a man or woman in Australia who</p>
<p> examines this issue fairly, who won't conclude that we need to</p>
<p> reform, we need to change, we need to modernise the way in which we</p>
<p> handle our waterfront. Now this my friends is a very important issue.</p>
<p> It is an issue that goes to the survivability and the strength of</p>
<p> Australia's economic future. It is an issue where the national</p>
<p> interest must take precedence over the selfish interests of any one</p>
<p> section of the Australian community. And I have a lot of compassion</p>
<p> to those people who have suffered from the uncompetitive nature of</p>
<p> the Australian watefront in the past. I know the heartache of many</p>
<p> farmers has seen their produce rot on the waterfront. I know the heartache</p>
<p> of small business men and women who have seen their businesses destroyed</p>
<p> or restricted or hindered because of the unproductive character of</p>
<p> the Australian waterfront. And those in the Australian community who</p>
<p> criticise the attempt of the Government and others to bring about</p>
<p> reform in the name of fairness and justice, I ask those people to</p>
<p> contemplate the long years of unfairness and injustice to those Australians</p>
<p> in the past who have suffered at the hands of the bullying, bludgeoning</p>
<p> unfair taxing of the Maritime Union of Australia.</p>
<p>The other matter that I wanted to touch on very briefly is, of course,</p>
<p> the issue of native title. Now this is a difficult issue, it's</p>
<p> an issue that does generate emotion. But it is an issue that ultimately,</p>
<p> like all other political issues, must be resolved by the Australian</p>
<p> people, either through their elected representatives or if it turns</p>
<p> out to be the case at the time of an election in which one of the</p>
<p> crucial judgements to be made is whether or not the Government's</p>
<p> native title legislation will be passed. [Inaudible] this was an issue</p>
<p> that provoked a certain amount of argument on my side of politics</p>
<p> and I can remember going to a meeting in Longreach in May of last</p>
<p> year in which quite a number of the people in the audience didn't</p>
<p> think that my Government was going far enough to protect the interests</p>
<p> of pastoralists and farmers and of the mining industry, and it was</p>
<p> an interesting experience to have people who have spent a lifetime</p>
<p> supporting you politically expressing public doubts about the stance</p>
<p> that you were taking. But I took that stance and I listened to that</p>
<p> criticism. I rejected that criticism, I argued back and said that</p>
<p> the position that my Government, and may I say manfully and loyalty</p>
<p> supported by the Deputy Prime Minister, Tim Fischer, who is the most</p>
<p> marvellous person that any Prime Minister could have as his deputy.</p>
<p> Supported by him we took a decision which we regard as representing</p>
<p> a fair balance between the interests of different sections of the</p>
<p> Australian people and we put that position into legislation. We sent</p>
<p> that legislation into the Parliament at the end of last year and it</p>
<p> was rejected by the Senate. We put it into the Parliament three months</p>
<p> later and it's now been rejected again. And I want to say to</p>
<p> you ladies and gentlemen as I've said to many others when I've</p>
<p> been asked this question, we have no intention of altering or retreating</p>
<p> from the principles that are contained in that legislation. And I</p>
<p> don't say that out of any pigheadedness or any stubbornness and</p>
<p> I don't say it out of any sense of self-righteousness, as I've</p>
<p> learnt in politics, it's always a dangerous delusion to be too</p>
<p> self-righteous, no matter what party you belong to or no matter what</p>
<p> the issue. But I do it because I have honestly come to the conclusion</p>
<p> that our legislation represents a fair balance between different sections</p>
<p> of the Australian community. I have refused to accept the proposition</p>
<p> urged on me by the Labor Party and by the minor parties and the Independents</p>
<p> and by other people in the community, that we should give a right</p>
<p> to negotiate over certain landholdings in Australia to one group of</p>
<p> Australians when denying it to all other groups of Australians.</p>
<p>I believe in that great shining principle. I believe in that great</p>
<p> shining principle that all Australians should be equal before the</p>
<p> law, and that all Australians should be accountable to the same dispensation</p>
<p> of justice under our board that we should all be equally accountable.</p>
<p> And I cannot accept the principle and my party and the National Party</p>
<p> will never accept the principle that one group of Australians should</p>
<p> be given rights and privileges that are not available to others. Nobody</p>
<p> denies the collective disadvantage of different sections of the Australian</p>
<p> community and the true remedies of that is not to create inequality</p>
<p> under the law but the true remedy to that is to address specific programmes</p>
<p> in areas of health, education and employment and housing in order</p>
<p> to minimise or to reduce that social disadvantage. To address social</p>
<p> disadvantage through creation of inequality under the law, opens up</p>
<p> new boundaries of discontent and anger within the rest of the community,</p>
<p> and that is not something that any sensible Government ought to embark</p>
<p> upon and it is certainly not something that my Government will embark</p>
<p> upon.</p>
<p>And can I also say in relation to the native title issue, there seems</p>
<p> to be a form of elitist arrogance around in the eyes of some in the</p>
<p> media and some commentators. That in some fashion, the Australian</p>
<p> people are incapable of making a judgement on this issue without lapsing</p>
<p> into emotional sorts and emotionally explosive language. You won't</p>
<p> find any emotionally explosive language coming from me on this issue</p>
<p> and I don't intend to repeat them at this gathering but the three</p>
<p> most memorably despicable comments that have been made in that particular</p>
<p> category during the course of this debate have all come from people</p>
<p> who have been fiercely critical of the stance taken by my Government</p>
<p> and fiercely critical of the compromise that we have urged the Australian</p>
<p> people to accept.</p>
<p>Now can I say to you my friends that solving the issue of native title</p>
<p> can only be realised through acceptance of the legislation that we</p>
<p> presented and when I addressed that gathering at Longreach in May</p>
<p> of last year, I outlined my proposal, I said that they would be incorporated</p>
<p> into legislation and that legislation would be presented to the Parliament</p>
<p> and if it was rejected that it would be presented to the Parliament</p>
<p> again and that I would take all the steps that were available to ensure</p>
<p> that the legislation would be put through. I have delivered on that</p>
<p> commitment, I've kept faith in the commitment that I made at</p>
<p> that gathering at Longreach because I believe the basis of the explanation</p>
<p> I gave them remains the only basis on which the native title issue,</p>
<p> a very difficult issue of native title, can be resolved.</p>
<p>Finally, can I say to all of you that it is always a great personal</p>
<p> experience to be able to get out of the large population centres of</p>
<p> Australia to visit the rural and regional areas of our country and</p>
<p> to have the experience of meeting with people and exchanging a few</p>
<p> words about their particular business, personal or other challenges.</p>
<p> By far the most rewarding part of being Prime Minister of Australia,</p>
<p> is the opportunities the job gives to meet, to mingle with, to listen</p>
<p> to and respond and I have on occasion to offer some comfort and encouragement</p>
<p> to my fellow Australians. And I find that every day, every week that</p>
<p> goes by the experience of that becomes the better and becomes the</p>
<p> richer. So it is for me, personally, a very rewarding thing to be</p>
<p> amongst all of you. I want to say how much I enjoyed meeting the young</p>
<p> men and women involved in the work for the dole programme and this</p>
<p> magnificent heritage village.</p>
<p>Can I marvell about the air-conditioning genius of early Australia,</p>
<p> this is a wonderfully air-conditioning, I say that not in any jest,</p>
<p> I say that in admiration, I think it is, given the large gathering,</p>
<p> given the humidity of the day, I think it is a beautifully air-conditioned</p>
<p> building. I think the reality is that as we get closer and closer</p>
<p> to celebrating 100 years of Australia as a nation we will become more</p>
<p> and more attached to, more attracted to and more enthralled by our</p>
<p> past. We will honour our heritage and all the great of it as we approach</p>
<p> our 100 years as a nation. As we wander through the village, we wander</p>
<p> into that beautifully reconstructed catholic church, to come to this</p>
<p> hall to talk the young men and women, all of whom to a man and a woman</p>
<p> when I asked about their experiences for working for the dole, they</p>
<p> say it's much better than doing nothing at home. And I think</p>
<p> that is something that expresses a sentiment because no</p>
