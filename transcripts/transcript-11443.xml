<p>E&amp;OE...................</p>
<p>  Thank you very much Mr Chairman and Ladies and Gentlemen.</p>
<p>  It is now almost four years since the Coalition Government was elected in</p>
<p>   March of 1996 and I thought it would therefore be useful if I tried in the</p>
<p>   few moments available to me to give a brief account of the stewardship of</p>
<p>   the Government over that period of time and most particularly over the last</p>
<p>   12 months.</p>
<p>  It is important when giving an overview of that kind to recall the broad</p>
<p>   goals that the Government set itself in March of 1996. Because it is all</p>
<p>   too easy in politics to focus far too heavily on the micro detail of day</p>
<p>   to day policy decisions and administrative actions and to lose sight of</p>
<p>   the fact that collectively they are but means to achieving certain overall</p>
<p>   goals. Every Government elected to office in this country has certain national</p>
<p>   broad aspirations, has a desire in the period of its office, whether it</p>
<p>   be long or short, to bring about beneficial change for the aggregate benefit</p>
<p>   of as many Australians as possible.</p>
<p>  And so it was with the Coalition Government taking office for the first</p>
<p>   time in 13 years in March of 1996. We set ourselves a number of goals, we</p>
<p>   set ourselves the goal, a very general but very desirable one, of strengthening</p>
<p>   our country. Of strengthening it economically, strengthening it socially</p>
<p>   and strengthening it internationally.</p>
<p>  I think I can report to the nation that over the four years, and particularly</p>
<p>   over the last 12 months, we have achieved to goal of strengthening Australia</p>
<p>   economically. The economic performance of this country at the moment is</p>
<p>   as strong as it has been at any time since the end of World War II - in</p>
<p>   some respects, even stronger - because we operate in a more open, competitive</p>
<p>   international environment, we are less protected, we have, and may I acknowledge</p>
<p>   our predecessors did in a number of areas, embrace essential changes and</p>
<p>   reforms, and that has collectively given us a fundamental generic economic</p>
<p>   strength that we have not had for some time.</p>
<p>  We sought to strengthen the country socially by recognising that it was</p>
<p>   important to draw upon the fundamental values and instincts of the Australian</p>
<p>   community. One of the things that I have endeavoured to do as Prime Minister</p>
<p>   is to develop what I chose to call in my Federation Address at the beginning</p>
<p>   of this year, an 'Australian way' or an Australian approach to handling</p>
<p>   particular problems, and out of that we have developed the notion of a social</p>
<p>   coalition.</p>
<p>  I don't suggest that that notion isn't found in some manifestation in other</p>
<p>   parts of the world but I haven't consciously sought to apply some kind of</p>
<p>   foreign paradigm to the notion of how we marshal the resources of all of</p>
<p>   the people and all of the institutions of this country.</p>
<p>  The social coalition seeks to recognise a reality and that is that the government</p>
<p>   alone cannot solve all of the social problems of a nation. The great welfare</p>
<p>   institutions of our society acting alone cannot hope to do so, individuals</p>
<p>   acting alone cannot hope to do so, although they have a role to play and</p>
<p>   responsibilities to assume and obligations in appropriate cases to return</p>
<p>   to the general community, and finally of course the business community's</p>
<p>   primary role is producing economic wealth, but it does have a contributory</p>
<p>   role to play in relation to social policy.</p>
<p>  And what the social coalition seeks to do is to draw upon those four elements</p>
<p>   and working together to tackle problems in a somewhat different and in many</p>
<p>   cases innovative way, and for the first time we have more heavily involved</p>
<p>   many of the welfare organisations at the policy making end as well as at</p>
<p>   the compassion end of delivering social policy.</p>
<p>  We have sought through a series of initiatives to encourage greater participation</p>
<p>   by the business community. My cry has been not that business should give</p>
<p>   more, but rather that more businesses should give because there are many</p>
<p>   outstanding examples in the Australian community of the generosity of individual</p>
<p>   businesses.</p>
<p>  We have not sought through the social coalition in any way to withdraw from</p>
<p>   the traditional role of government in Australian society. The traditional</p>
<p>   role of Government in Australian society has been that the Government should</p>
<p>   have a limited role, that that role should be strategic. Part of the strategic</p>
<p>   role of Government is to support and provide and nurture a social security</p>
<p>   underpinning or social security safety net.</p>
<p>  And it has never been the aim of the Government I lead to drive the Government</p>
<p>   proportion of gross domestic product down ever lower as an end in itself,</p>
<p>   but rather to recognise that there are roles for Government in our community,</p>
<p>   they are limited, but they are important and they are strategic.</p>
<p>  And as we come to the end of this century, I hope to believe that we may</p>
<p>   have found a reasonable balance in relation to the roles of Government and</p>
<p>   the roles of business within our community.</p>
<p>  And the third of the goals we set ourselves was of course the strength of</p>
<p>   Australia internationally. There were many elements of the foreign policy</p>
<p>   of the former government that we found agreement with, and its always desirable</p>
<p>   to have a certain continuity of foreign policy as administrations change.</p>
<p>   It is never in the national interest to change policy merely for the sake</p>
<p>   of reminding the world that a new government has taken over.</p>
<p>  But we have sought in the time that we've been in office to bring about</p>
<p>   some re-balancing. To move away from what I thought on occasions looked</p>
<p>   a little like an 'Asia- only' focus by the former Government to what I have</p>
<p>   called an 'Asia first' focus whereby we recognise that although our political,</p>
<p>   economic and strategic linkages with the Asian Pacific are far and away</p>
<p>   our most important and would continue to be so, we also have very important</p>
<p>   strategic and foreign policy and economic linkages with other parts of the</p>
<p>   world.</p>
<p>  And many of you have heard me before speak of what I regard as that special</p>
<p>   intersection of history, culture, geography and economic circumstance that</p>
<p>   I believe Australia occupies, with our strong links of all sorts of kinds</p>
<p>   with Europe and North America that our strategic and geographic placement</p>
<p>   here in the Asian Pacific world. And indeed that intersection and the unique</p>
<p>   insight that it gives to this country was very much at work in recent months</p>
<p>   in the role that we discharged in relation to East Timor.</p>
<p>  So they were, ladies and gentlemen, some of the broad goals that we set</p>
<p>   ourselves almost four years ago.</p>
<p>  Becoming more up to date, when I delivered my second Federation Address</p>
<p>   in Brisbane of this year, I said that the Government had five broad goals</p>
<p>   for 1999. I said that we were resolved first and foremost to continue to</p>
<p>   pursue policies that will maintain our remarkable rate of economic growth</p>
<p>   and economic strengths. I think I can report to you and to the Australian</p>
<p>   people that we have in fact achieved that goal and in some respects achieved</p>
<p>   it beyond the expectation that we had at the beginning of 1999.</p>
<p>  There is the hope that not only will we be able to report in a years time</p>
<p>   that we were able to stare down the Asian economic downturn, but in fact</p>
<p>   we might have begun to get some of the benefits of the upswing that is now</p>
<p>   beginning to occur in some parts of Asia.</p>
<p>  I said secondly that we remain absolutely committed to the implementation</p>
<p>   in full of our visionary tax plan endorsed by the Australian people at the</p>
<p>   last election. And absent the 10 to 15 per cent as I have described it that</p>
<p>   was taken out in negotiations with the Australian Democrats I can report</p>
<p>   that the Parliament has endorsed and we are in the process of implementing</p>
<p>   that taxation plan which is the biggest change to our taxation system, probably</p>
<p>   ever and certainly the biggest since the end of World War II, and will return</p>
<p>   to this country very major net economic benefits. It is important when the</p>
<p>   focus is inevitably on some of the detail and the argument and the political</p>
<p>   debate is about some of the detail, it is important to remember that the</p>
<p>   big game, the big story out of tax reform, are the major benefits to the</p>
<p>   Australian economy. The lower business costs, the lower export costs, the</p>
<p>   lower fuel costs to the bush, the major cuts in personal income tax, the</p>
<p>   quite dramatic and very beneficial changes to the business taxation system</p>
<p>   that will give us a world competitive rate of company tax that will dramatically</p>
<p>   cut almost in half in many cases the rate of capital gains tax, which will</p>
<p>   stimulate a higher level still of foreign investment in this country.</p>
<p>  And the story of tax reform is the story of giving to this country an even</p>
<p>   better economic chance, as we go into the next century, of making an already</p>
<p>   very competitive Australian economy, even more competitive. And giving to</p>
<p>   of course 80 per cent of Australian tax payers a personal rate of income</p>
<p>   tax at the margin that can never go higher than 30 per cent.</p>
<p>  Thirdly, I said that we would not tire in our efforts to further reduce</p>
<p>   unemployment, which although at an eight year low is still too high, and</p>
<p>   once again I can report to you that we have made progress. Not as much as</p>
<p>   I would have liked, but more than I though at one stage during the year</p>
<p>   it would be possible. Even some of the more conservative of the Government's</p>
<p>   economic advisers are now suggesting to us that with current policy settings,</p>
<p>   and they include of course a continuation of a strong rate of economic growth,</p>
<p>   we might see unemployment go even lower.</p>
<p>  Fourthly we are going to extend out commitment to the principle of mutual</p>
<p>   obligation in Australian society and certainly I can report again that we</p>
<p>   have been very active on that front, the extension of the work for the dole,</p>
<p>   the introduction in relation to the drug offensive, of the diversion programs</p>
<p>   in cooperation with the states. The details of that I launched in Sydney</p>
<p>   only a few weeks ago and yesterday the Health Minister went to Tasmania</p>
<p>   to announce in cooperation with the Premier of Tasmania the diversion programme</p>
<p>   which is built upon, once again, the principle of mutual obligation - that</p>
<p>   society has an obligation to do everything it can to assist people who want</p>
<p>   to break the drug habit. And we have a very special social responsibility</p>
<p>   to do that and I don't pretend that this is an easy challenge and I don't</p>
<p>   pretend that the solutions are simple but part of the process must be to</p>
<p>   confront people who do wish to break the habit with the reality that if</p>
<p>   they are to get assistance, if they are to avoid being caught up in the</p>
<p>   criminal justice system then they should avail themselves of treatment and</p>
<p>   rehabilitation facilities.</p>
<p>  And finally I said in my address earlier this year that we would work to</p>
<p>   create an even stronger social coalition to more effectively remedy areas</p>
<p>   of disadvantage and under-privilege and I have already spoken earlier of</p>
<p>   the importance that I place on the building of a strong social coalition</p>
<p>   in this country. So as we come to the end of this year and as we reflect</p>
<p>   upon what has occurred and it has by any definition been a remarkably active</p>
<p>   and a remarkably productive year but from my point of view and the Government's</p>
<p>   point of view it has not so much been the individual policy decisions but</p>
<p>   the contribution that those policy decisions have made towards achieving</p>
<p>   those broad goals that I recalled at the beginning of my address.</p>
<p>  Of course the year has also been characterised, as political years always</p>
<p>   are and years in the life of the nation always are, by events that could</p>
<p>   not reasonably have been foreseen certainly in the way they worked out at</p>
<p>   the beginning of the year. And clearly Australia's involvement in providing</p>
<p>   hope and a future for the people of East Timor very much comes into that</p>
<p>   category. It was without doubt the most important international event to</p>
<p>   effect Australia during the year. It saw for the first time Australia leading</p>
<p>   an international peace enforcement operation. It saw Australia assert herself</p>
<p>   in an appropriate and sensible way - not a provocative or over-reactive</p>
<p>   way in our part of the region - in a way that has brought lasting credit</p>
<p>   to our nation and lasting credit in particular to the men and women of the</p>
<p>   Australian Defence Force. It represented the act of a country that sought</p>
<p>   not argument or disputation with the Republic of Indonesia but rather a</p>
<p>   country and an Government that sought to discharge its obligations to a</p>
<p>   group of people who in earlier years had more than discharged their obligations</p>
<p>   to Australians of an earlier generation. And I believe that history will</p>
<p>   see the Australian action in East Timor in a positive light. History will</p>
<p>   see Australia as having acted in an appropriate, a restrained, but nonetheless</p>
<p>   very determined, very definitive way.</p>
<p>  Throwing forward to the year ahead it's a clich to say that it will be</p>
<p>   a very active year. I see the role of the Government in the year ahead being</p>
<p>   very much one of continuing to pursue, in the name of achieving the goals</p>
<p>   I outlined, the economic reform programme that has been a characteristic</p>
<p>   of our time in Government. There is a lot of talk in our community about</p>
<p>   whether the reform process has gone too far, whether we have reform fatigue.</p>
<p>   Once again it is a question of achieving an appropriate balance. The reform</p>
<p>   process never stops. In a sense, once governments give up on reform then</p>
<p>   the community is entitled to question the continued value of that government</p>
<p>   to the community. Reforms of course must take account of the impact of change</p>
<p>   on our community. There is an ever present obligation on governments to</p>
<p>   explain and interpret economic reform and the benefits of change and reform</p>
<p>   to their communities and their societies and if we don't do that resistance</p>
<p>   - much of it ill-informed - will build to the process of reform.</p>
<p>  It is fair to say that Australia at the present time in a national generic</p>
<p>   sense is enjoying great prosperity and great economic strengths. That situation</p>
<p>   imposes a special obligation on all of us to make sure that all sections</p>
<p>   of the community as best we can enjoy and share in the benefits of that</p>
<p>   national economic well-being and economic strength. And I think particularly</p>
<p>   of those of my fellow Australians who live in the rural and regional areas</p>
<p>   of our nation. Historically and now in present terms contributing so much</p>
<p>   to our export income, so much to our wealth and also importantly, so much</p>
<p>   to our understanding of what it is to be an Australian. And I have often</p>
<p>   said in the past that I cannot conceive the Australia that I grew up to</p>
<p>   love as being an Australia that doesn't have the bush and the rural and</p>
<p>   regional parts of our country as very much part and parcel of how we see</p>
<p>   ourselves and how we relate to ourselves as an Australian community. And</p>
<p>   it is a special obligation to make sure therefore as best we can, in the</p>
<p>   months ahead and indeed in the years ahead, that the benefits of national</p>
<p>   economic strengths are enjoyed by many of our Australian citizens as is</p>
<p>   humanly possible. Because when the country is doing well those who aren't</p>
<p>   doing well feel the disadvantage ever more keenly and ever more acutely</p>
<p>   and that puts a very special obligation on us.</p>
<p>  I will seek, and the Government will seek in the months ahead, to make certain</p>
<p>   that we continue all we can to reduce our current level of unemployment.</p>
<p>   Unemployment in Australia has now assumed a markedly varied character in</p>
<p>   the sense that there are large parts of Australia particularly in some of</p>
<p>   the large cities, where for practical purpose, unemployment has been reduced</p>
<p>   to an almost irreducible minimum. There are many of the central districts</p>
<p>   of Sydney where the unemployment rate is in the order of slightly below</p>
<p>   or slightly above 2%. And yet if we move into some of the regional areas,</p>
<p>   the change is quite dramatic and quite marked. And that once again underlines</p>
<p>   the point I make about the need for reaching out and ensuring the best available</p>
<p>   assistance consistent with national economic goals is made available to</p>
<p>   people in rural and regional Australia. And we will seek over the year ahead</p>
<p>   of course to complete the successful and smooth implementation of our taxation</p>
<p>   reforms. They are important reforms, their implementation in a smooth effective</p>
<p>   manner is an important priority of the government.</p>
<p>  We will also seek in the year ahead to build a sensible but restrained an</p>
<p>   non provocative way on the new sense of respect, and I believe strength,</p>
<p>   in which Australia is viewed internationally. We have been a very good regional</p>
<p>   neighbour - not only of Indonesia but also of nations such as Thailand and</p>
<p>   Korea. We have a capacity to play a crucial role in the economic and political</p>
<p>   development of the region and our capacity to do so is enhanced by our economic</p>
<p>   strength and our capacity to do so has also been enhanced by our diplomatic</p>
<p>   standing in relation to East Timor.</p>
<p>  And finally, ladies and gentlemen, we will seek in the year ahead, to do</p>
<p>   something that I said was very important to me and to the Government that</p>
<p>   I lead when I accepted the verdict, very pleasingly I might say, of the</p>
<p>   Australian people on the 2nd March 1996. And that was to try</p>
<p>   and focus on those things that united the Australian community rather than</p>
<p>   those things that divided them. Because I have long held the belief in public</p>
<p>   life that the things that unite us as Australians are infinitely more enduring</p>
<p>   and more lasting and more effective and more important than the things that</p>
<p>   divide us. And if there is one goal that any government worth its salt should</p>
<p>   set itself and that is to do everything it can to bind together and to unite</p>
<p>   the Australian people. And if there is one thing - and I say it finally</p>
<p>   - that I can say with every conviction that we have been true to over the</p>
<p>   last almost four years, and that is that we have not been a government that</p>
<p>   has been beholden to any one section of the Australian community. We have</p>
<p>   not been a government that has been owned by one section, we have not been</p>
<p>   a government that has pursued an obsessive agenda out of deference to one</p>
<p>   section of the Australian community. We have rather been a government that</p>
<p>   has sought as best we could to govern for all Australians.</p>
<p>  Thank you.</p>
<p>  JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>  Tony Wright from The Age, Prime Minister. Your review today has been</p>
<p>   pretty much about the last years of this century, and we are just about</p>
<p>   move into another century and millennium. And yesterday of course you knocked</p>
<p>   over a couple of records of the great Liberal Prime Minister Menzies with</p>
<p>   cricket scores and by your own lights a better economy. I wonder whether</p>
<p>   you attempted at any stage to go for that last record - 16 years as a Liberal</p>
<p>   Prime Minister? And perhaps more realistically, as you'll be going to another</p>
<p>   election in a couple of years, would you be prepared to commit to serving</p>
<p>   another full term as Prime Minister should you win that election, and God</p>
<p>   and passing trucks willing?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well thank you Tony. My position on this has really been quite consistent.</p>
<p>   I take one election at a time. And I said that after the last election.</p>
<p>   I'm in good health. But I'm a realist. I take one election at a time. If</p>
<p>   my party wants me to lead them to the next election then I will be happy</p>
<p>   to do so. I remind all of you that I don't hold the office I now have other</p>
<p>   than by the courtesy and the gift of the Liberal Party of Australia. It's</p>
<p>   not mine to pass on, it's not mine to do a deal with anybody about. It is</p>
<p>   an office that I hold out of the courtesy of the Liberal Party and my position</p>
<p>   is that if the party wants me to lead them to another election I'd be very</p>
<p>   happy to do so. What happens after that I will deal with on a term to term</p>
<p>   basis. I'm not getting into the exaggerated business of projecting beyond</p>
<p>   that. I really think that would be both presumptuous and unrealistic.</p>
<p>  JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>  Gay Davidson.[inaudible]. Anyway I wanted to ask you Prime Minister what</p>
<p>   your reaction was when Indonesia scrapped the East Timor [inaudible] on</p>
<p>   protest agreement? And have you had any..that was two days ago. Have you</p>
<p>   had any intelligence more about it? What diplomatic moves have you made?</p>
<p>   Have you given any advice to the American Government who will of course</p>
<p>   be clearly intrigued about this whole thing considering their interest not</p>
<p>   only in oil but also this sort of strength?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  You'll appreciate that I can't go into any detail about intelligence advice.</p>
<p>   The view of the Government is that nothing that has happened so far threatens</p>
<p>   the arrangements that we've made. We think that applying some of the notions</p>
<p>   of successor states in international law that there won't be any difficulty</p>
<p>   in working out an understanding in relation to that.</p>
<p>  JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>  Prime Minister, Vivienne Stanton from Reuters. After your famous school</p>
<p>   report card speech to Parliament earlier this year, we know that you see</p>
<p>   quite a bit of talent in your frontbench. I was just wondering how soon</p>
<p>   you're planning to rearrange the desks, and who will get to be a prefect</p>
<p>   and who will get sent to the back of the class?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well I don't have anything in mind on that front. When, if I were to well</p>
<p>   I'd announce it. Were we to make any changes I'd announce them. But I think</p>
<p>   the team is doing very well. But I also think that I've got a lot of talent</p>
<p>   on the backbench.</p>
<p>  JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>  Malcolm Farr, the Daily Telegraph. In your 25 years in Parliament,</p>
<p>   have you known politicians to be held in the low standing that they are</p>
<p>   today? And going back to the referendum but without please going to the</p>
<p>   issues of the referendum, do you think a consequence of the 'no' case tactic</p>
<p>   or strategy of saying politicians cannot be trusted would exasperate the</p>
<p>   current low standing of politicians. What would you do to raise the level</p>
<p>   of respect of politicians and consequently of the Parliament?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well I don't know that the attitude has perhaps changed as much as people</p>
<p>   including journalists and some Parliamentarians often say. I think there's</p>
<p>   always been a bit of that sort of healthy scepticism in this country towards</p>
<p>   people in authority. I was asked by President Clinton when he came to Australian</p>
<p>   in 1996, we had a talk about some of the comparisons between Americans and</p>
<p>   Australians. And I said that I thought one of the differences between Americans</p>
<p>   and Australians was that Australians were somewhat more sceptical as a people</p>
<p>   than Americans. And that's no bad thing. It may be aggravating for us on</p>
<p>   occasions but it is no bad thing. It's I think part of our Celtic inheritance</p>
<p>   that we have a certain scepticism. So I'm not sure that it's got so dramatically</p>
<p>   worse. I mean we all say that. I don't know that it's changed quite as much.</p>
<p>   What would I do to change it? I don't think there's any one thing you can</p>
<p>   do. You can only do your best. Try and talk to people as candidly as possible.</p>
<p>   Try and understand what motivates the mainstream of the Australian community.</p>
<p>   Don't get captured by interest groups. Don't get too remote in not only</p>
<p>   a geographic sense but in a sense of understanding what the broad community</p>
<p>   feels. You asked me about the 'no' campaign. Well the 'no' campaign had</p>
<p>   a lot of elements and had a lot of contributors. Different people put it</p>
<p>   in a different way. You wouldn't have found anything I said that involved</p>
<p>   any denigration of politicians. I had a view. My view was that we shouldn't</p>
<p>   change. Now I haven't come here today to sort of rehearse the referendum,</p>
<p>   you shake your head and I'm glad to hear that you haven't either. But I</p>
<p>   don't know that out of that there was any great further damage done. But</p>
<p>   I'm prepared to be accountable, and bear in mind it was a free vote, and</p>
<p>   when you have a free vote the Prime Minister has the same privilege that's</p>
<p>   accorded to every other member. And I'm very happy to have anything I said</p>
<p>   during the campaign subject to very close scrutiny.</p>
<p>  JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>  Amanda Buckley, Bloomberg News, Prime Minister. I just wanted to ask you</p>
<p>   about privatisation today. We know it was very much on the Government's</p>
<p>   agenda when you came into office, and you've had some very big sales and</p>
<p>   I think 40% of Australians are now shareholders as a result. But I'm wondering</p>
<p>   whether you've run out of a bit of steam on this issue. We know that your</p>
<p>   Treasurer is very keen to get more sales and we know that he'd like to sell</p>
<p>   the remaining 50.1% of Telstra to eliminate Commonwealth debt. We know there's</p>
<p>   less enthusiasm in the National Party, perhaps reflecting what you said</p>
<p>   about that reform fatigue out there in the community. And I'm just wondering</p>
<p>   if you do have a timetable in your own mind for the rest of Telstra, if</p>
<p>   you can tell is where Sydney Airport is in the queue at the moment - I know</p>
<p>   there's a bit of a back up of big decisions coming along on that score -</p>
<p>   and give us some idea of what the Government's privatisation program will</p>
<p>   be in future?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Amanda, the policy on Telstra hasn't changed. The policy on Telstra is that</p>
<p>   we still have it as a goal to sell the lot but we made a commitment to..once</p>
<p>   we got to where we are now we have an examination process in relation to</p>
<p>   the adequacy of services particularly in regional Australia. And only if</p>
<p>   we were satisfied from that would we then go on. But the goal hasn't changed</p>
<p>   and it's not as far as I'm concerned likely to change. I would like to remind</p>
<p>   people, particularly those in regional Australia who might be listening</p>
<p>   to this program, that a lot of the benefits that are now going to the bush,</p>
<p>   for example the rural transaction centres. And I opened the first of them</p>
<p>   at Eugowra about six or eight weeks ago. And they'</p>
