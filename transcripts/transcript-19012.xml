<p>The thoughts of the nation are today with the people of Queensland who are battling a new round of natural disasters.</p>
<p>For many Queenslanders, the memories of the floods of two summers ago are still fresh.</p>
<p>Areas of Queensland are today facing very serious weather conditions, in particular Gladstone, Bundaberg, Gympie and the Sunshine Coast. And severe weather is likely to impact on other communities in southeast Queensland over the next 24 hours.</p>
<p>The Federal Government is working with the Queensland Government and local authorities to respond to this threat. The Australian Defence Force is assisting. </p>
<p>I pay tribute to our emergency service workers who are among our finest and bravest. Across the nation, they have been tested by bushfires that are still raging across several other states. Now in Queensland, they are being tested by the ferocity of the wind and rain. </p>
<p>I encourage Queenslanders to listen to local warnings, stay abreast of the developments and to take care over the next 24 to 48 hours.</p>
