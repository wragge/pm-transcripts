THIRD INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS ON HUMAN Z 3 U 16<br />
RELATIONS<br />
Southern Gross Hotel, Melbourne<br />
Opening Address by the Prime Minister, Mr Harold Holt-<br />
8TH MAY, 1967<br />
The association of human relations and technology is vitally<br />
important. It is a supreme challenge for us, because all the wonders of<br />
science and technology cannot enable us to live by computers alone. A<br />
mechanical heart may keep some of us going in future years, but the<br />
creative ideas, the emotions and the impulses of man cannot be duplicated.<br />
Man remains the master, and it is with his task to see that the application<br />
of technology to the business of living is so ordered that the change Jt<br />
brings makes for peace, for prosperity, for happiness and for security.<br />
The title of my address is Technology in the SerV4 ce of the<br />
Nation, and I want to say something of what we are doing as a government,<br />
and what Australia is doing as a nation. I will select some samples, rather<br />
than attempt to open up the whole emporium of our national effort. The<br />
range of technology In the service of the nation Is wide Indeed, and we have<br />
achieved much by ourselves alone, through universities, and by partnerships<br />
with industry. We live here in Australia in a free society, and my government<br />
believes firmly, as a philosophy, in free enterprise. It is opposed to the<br />
confining and inhibiting limitations of a socialist bureaucracy. The forces<br />
of change operate in many directions and at various levels. Vie are not so<br />
bound by doctrine that we cannot see virtue in government 4nstitutions, in<br />
government activities, but basically ours is a free enterprise philosophy.<br />
And these forces of change must be able to play freely.<br />
VU ith these principles 4n mind, we have been conscious as a<br />
government that, nevertheless, there are heavy responsibilities on us to<br />
ensure that the impact of technological change is made in the right places<br />
with benefit to all, and as far as that is humanly practicable, with hurt to<br />
none. We cannot discipline the fact of these changes in an absolute way,<br />
but we can give some direction to the course they take, and wie can help to<br />
co-crd mnate some of the national responses which have to follow.<br />
The government has done much; it cannot and should not be<br />
expected to do everything. There is a matching responsibility on industry<br />
to make this technological revolution peaceful and productive. The govern ment<br />
can take limited initiatives in education, in research, in the promotion of<br />
essential partnerships with others, in the exchange of knowledge, and in the<br />
marshalling of capital. Beyond that it is essential for industry to play a<br />
full part, and this is one that must enlarge rapidly in the year ahead.<br />
Australia has a small population as great countries go, and we<br />
do not claim yet to be a great country, although in some directions we not<br />
only aspire to greatness, but we feel that we have achieved greatness. We<br />
have a vast continent with this small population, a continent approximately<br />
the size of the United States, if the Alaskans will excuse me once again for<br />
leaving them out of the picture. And Australia should, if we are to take the<br />
long-sighted view, broad and statesmanlike view, we should welcome / 2 </p>
<p>2-<br />
automation with open a rns, because it is through technological ipoeet<br />
through automation, that we can enable this small population to achieve things<br />
which otherwise would only be possible in a country with many times the numbers<br />
that we possess. And we have not waited for others to do this job for us.<br />
We are not a spendthrift nation, we devote nearly 30 per cent<br />
of our gross national product to capital investment. In a guest of honour<br />
broadcast during his visit to Australia, Admiral McDonald, the United States<br />
Chief of Naval Operations, A ustralia, pointed out that our capital investment,<br />
as a proportion of our gross national product, is more than one and a half<br />
times the rate of investment in the United States of A merica, or of Great<br />
Britain. Vle ra. L, I believe, second only to Japan.<br />
We have something of a dilemma here, because wie are at the<br />
same time proceeding with a programme of large scale immigration, and<br />
if immigration is to be successful, then you must have job opportunities quickly<br />
and plentifully available for those whom you attract to the country, But I<br />
think it says something for the skill with which these matters have been<br />
handled and I am not speaking now merely of governments, but of the<br />
community as a whole that thinughout this quite lengthy period, running now<br />
to just on twenty years of large-scale immigration Australia has been able<br />
to maintain a level of sustained high employment which is not surpassed, I<br />
believe, by any other country In the viorld.<br />
. e have achieved this to a degree as a result of the contact and<br />
co-operation which Australian governments have been able to maintain with<br />
industry. We do conduct regular consultations on a basis of consultation<br />
early in the year, and then just before the Budget session, with representative<br />
spokesmen of industry. But these are quite apart from the multitude of ad hoc<br />
consultations that go on through the year. We have regular discussions, in<br />
particular through the Department of Labour and National Service, with the<br />
organised trade union movement.<br />
And I think that assisting all of this is the Australian temperament<br />
and character. ' Vie, as visitors to Australia will find, a friendly people. Vhle<br />
like to get on well with others, we like to get on well with each other. And in<br />
particular, we like to do what we can for those who are finding the going tough,<br />
or who have their problems, in our community This has contributed<br />
enormously to the success of the immigration programme.<br />
Wle have each year a Citizenship Convention to which we invite<br />
representatives from all sections of the community life; not merely trade and<br />
industry, and the trade union movement, but social orginisations, religious<br />
bodies, the whole gamut virtually, of the Australian community existence.<br />
And through the year, quite apart from these regular gatherings, which occur<br />
annually, there is the work of the Good Neighbour movement in each community,<br />
helping us to assimilate the new settlers who come to live with us.<br />
PAIRTNERSHIPS<br />
So far as government is concerned, we try to maintain a threeway<br />
partnership, with management and with those whom they employ. The<br />
relationships I believe are good, and are steadily improving. For particular<br />
problems which arise, we do have certain ad hoc groups, wihich are able to<br />
take charge of the si tuation in respect of some innovation, some technological<br />
innovation, which could otherwise be disruptive, both of good relations and the<br />
employment situation. / 3 </p>
<p>-3<br />
have been able to go through these processes of change<br />
with remarkably little dislocation. In my own time as Minister for Labour,<br />
the considerable mechanisation that went on in t. he coal-mining industry<br />
pnxluced a displacement of labour, but the problems were minimised by<br />
consultation with owners and miners, and the industry has had a better<br />
industrial record since those days, than it had before.<br />
V~ e have other examples which perhaps I could mention; the<br />
extensive use of computers, in particular in the insurance industry,, The<br />
displacement of clerical labour which this has produced in some areas has<br />
gone by with again remarkably little dislocation. Automatic control<br />
mechanisms in important industries, such as the steel Industries, the<br />
petroleum industry; the growing degree of mechanisation and automation in<br />
the automotive industries; the significant part these modern processes are<br />
playing in the development of our oil resources and will be, with our natural<br />
gas; the problem with which we are grappling at the present time of<br />
container is ation on the waterfront; the introduction of mechanical cane cutting,<br />
and in particular of bulk sugar loading in Queensland, which I recall vividly<br />
from my own days as Minister, and which confronted us with problems of the<br />
re-absorption of labour displaced on the waterfront.<br />
All these are examples of technological change, and the way in<br />
which we, with our small population, are trying to make the most in terms<br />
of production of the resources we have.<br />
VWe have shown our concern for human relations in industry in<br />
a considerable variety of ways. W e played a proni not part, for example, in<br />
the establishment of the Duke of Edinburgh Study Conference on industrial<br />
relations, and the next conference s to be held in Australia in 1.968. VWhen<br />
it came to the establishment of Churchill Scholarships, Australia proved to<br />
be the highest contributor per capita of any country invited to join in that<br />
particular scheme. There has always been much emphasis given to industrial<br />
relations In Australia. It has had a political content, of course, because<br />
both sides of politics have given a great deal of their attention to industrial<br />
relations issues, but quite apart from that there has been this feeling that<br />
the worker in his job is entitled from the egalitarian approach that Australians<br />
bring to their community life, a fair deal, a fair go, and he enjoys one of the<br />
highest standards of living in the world as a result.<br />
Our arbitration system involved us in a good deal of pioneering<br />
in this field. It had its critics those who preferred collective bargaining;<br />
those who felt that management could be best left to work out its problems with<br />
its own employees, and while we do not ignore the important place which<br />
management must still play in direct personal industrial relations with those<br />
whom it engages, the Australian arbitration system has brought confidence to<br />
the wage-earner that his conditions would be reasonable, and that there would<br />
be a fair remuneration for the contribution he makes to the industry in which<br />
he is involved. ' Lie have been gratified to find that, increasi ngly over recent<br />
years, there have been studies made from the United Kingdom and the United<br />
States of the way in which we handle these matters. I could speak also of the<br />
concern we have exhibited to ensure that those who have special problems,<br />
the disabled, the returned servicemen, the children of servicemen who are<br />
given such generous and thoughtful treatment by Legacy and the Returned / 4 </p>
<p>1%<br />
Soliers' League all these are illustrations of the emphasis which we place<br />
in Australia upon good human relations, and then in turn relate those to the<br />
problems of our technology.<br />
It has been said that we are missing the bus in the technological<br />
sense, that we are depending too much on imported knowledge. This simply<br />
is not true. My government has cast a very wide net indeed here and in all1<br />
the significant centres of technological activity abroad, to ensure that we are<br />
up to date in our knowledge. It is right to say, of course, that we have<br />
imported know-how from other countries. But i s this wrong? Does it not make<br />
good sense, while going on as best we can within the limits of our own<br />
resources with research and development activity, that we should turn to the<br />
very much more extensive research of which countries with very much larger<br />
populations, the United States, with 193 millions, the United Kingdom, with<br />
more than 510 millions, Japan getting up to the 90 million mark, or thereabouts,<br />
that they are able to make in their own industries?<br />
Australia has benefited from this activity, which others have<br />
carried out. It makes sense for us to learn all we can from others, and to<br />
use the superior skills that are thus produced, where they can be made available<br />
for us. Wle are acquiring new skills all the time, and building up a formidable<br />
sum of experience. The benefit of this experience can be rated in terms of the<br />
per capita production measured by our gross national product. For example,<br />
India, with ' 2times our population, can point to only twice the size of our<br />
gross national product; Indonesia, with nine times our population, has only<br />
a third of Australia's gross national product, and this, of course, is one of<br />
the principal factors why Australia counts as a trad ing nation, and a factor in<br />
the world, despite the comparative smallness of our population.<br />
We have tariffs to protect Australian industry, but we do not<br />
propose to impose tariffs on ideas. L. nation which is wrapped up in itself<br />
makes a very small parcel indeed. That is why, as I said earlier, we welcome<br />
the results, fruits of research and better techniques which come to us from<br />
other countries. Vie are, in relation to our population and resources, doing<br />
well, and man for man, project for project, we believe we are measuring<br />
up in skills and knowledge to the efforts of other countries of greater size and<br />
greater wealth. This does not mean that we cannot do more, and I do not wish to<br />
introduce any note of complacency. -% We must do more; the pace quickens, and<br />
the demands on us as one of the affluent societies must inc~~ ase as we live<br />
more intimately with our Asian and our Pacific environment.<br />
THE NATIONAL RECORD<br />
Lot us look briefly at what we are doing. Take education.<br />
The roots of our technological activity are, of course, in our educational<br />
system. The States are primarily responsible for education, but the Commonwealth<br />
Government is taking an incteasing interest and giving greater financial<br />
help in areas which are complementary to their systems.<br />
VWe have recognised the significance of education in the<br />
technological age, by appointing a Minister for Education and Science. He is<br />
a member of the Cabinet, and he directs a newly-created department but,<br />
of course, our efforts began long before that. </p>
<p>We have, over a period of years, encouraged and aided the<br />
States to build new universities, some like Monash in this city with a bias<br />
towards technology. If I could give you just a few examples. Eleven colleges<br />
of advanced education received interim capital grants up to December 31st,<br />
1966. In the 196T-6 triennium, 3.0 colleges of advanced education are to.<br />
receive capital and recurrent grants, and in addition, 12 are to receive<br />
recurrent grants only. Altogether 163 technical colleges have received grants<br />
under the Federal Government scheme.<br />
Practically every State secondary school in Australia in which<br />
science is taught has received some science teaching apparatus under the<br />
Federal Government scheme. At 28.5 State schools throughout Australia science<br />
laboratories are either completed or under construction. So far, 400 independent<br />
schools have benefited from the scheme, the degree of benefit varying from the<br />
building of multi laboratory science blocks, to the provision of apparatus for one<br />
laboratory. We have made possible the introduction of a new area of<br />
tertiary education, complementary to our universities, and are helping the<br />
States to develop this system so that there is a general extension of standards<br />
and greater opportunities for young people to have higher education. W~ e have<br />
given Federal aid to science blocks in denominational schools, and inct'eased<br />
the number of scholarships for secondary students, with special provision for<br />
technological students. Vil'e have increased taxation concessions in the education<br />
field. These have a significant bearing on the end product of technological<br />
development, and are vital to the further research which has to be undertaken.<br />
In the field of research, through the Ministry of Supply, the<br />
Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation and other<br />
agencies are active in many fields, and getting sound results. 1 do not think<br />
the average Australian realises how much we have done. In recent months, we<br />
have taken a fresh look at the needs of industry, to see where we could help, and<br />
the government recently announced an incentive scheme for financial help in<br />
research by companies in the manufacturing and mining industries. This, we<br />
felt, is the best way to give top management the encouragement to test new<br />
ideas, and to give full rein to the enquiring minds of our young technologists<br />
in industry. Recently I opened a new tracking station at Honeysuckle<br />
Creek, not far from Canberra. This station is one of the latest examples of<br />
the application of our technological skills, in the assembly of a highly complicated<br />
apparatus needed for tracking satellites Mn outer space. It was specially<br />
established for the United States, and in co-operation with them, as part of<br />
the facilities required to service the planned attempt to land men on the moon<br />
in the 1970' s. It may interest you to know that on the Apollo project, there<br />
are three stations which will be assisting in this tracking; one in the United<br />
States, one in Spain and the third here in Australia. Al1together this is the<br />
sixth tracking station here in Australia, and It is just ten years since we<br />
established the first of them, during the 1957 international geophysical year.<br />
They are all operating now. They are to be found at<br />
Garnarvon, in Western Australia, Cooby Creek in Queensland, Y! oomera in<br />
South Australia, and at Tidbinbilla, Ororral Valley, and Honeysucle Greek<br />
in the Australian Capital Territory. These stations make up the largest<br />
complex outside the United States to be directly involved 4n that country's space<br />
programme. / 6 </p>
<p>6-<br />
And quite apart from the practical function they perform in<br />
space flights, they represent a place for us in modern technology in an<br />
advanced form. Weget a rub-off, as so many of you around this room will<br />
know, in specialist technical fields. They reflect our capacity to hold our<br />
own in skills and knowledge with nations greater in wealth and size.<br />
More and more men and women are being trained Australia<br />
to handle complicated equipment associated with space technology, and their<br />
experience is spreading through the services of the Government, as w'ell<br />
as through industry. W, e have already had, for example, the first telecast between<br />
Britain and Australia by way of satellites in outer space, and by the same<br />
process, will see the events of Australia's special day at Canada's Centenary<br />
Celebrations in Montreal next month. In Australia today, 95 per cent of the<br />
nation's population is within reach of telecasting.<br />
W. ke have our scientists and explorers in the Antarctic and they<br />
have kept us well in the van of research and development in that area. We<br />
have established a place in the front rank of world astronomy, and we are<br />
adding to the facilities we already have at Mount Stromlo and at the Radio<br />
Telescope Centre at Parkes by deciding in partnership with Britain to set up<br />
a new 15C inch optical telescope at Siding Springs in New South '!' ales. This<br />
w Ml be the largest in the southern hemisphere and the second largest in the<br />
world. WThen I run through lists of these achievements and these are<br />
just a few examples one can talk of what we are doing at 1' oomera with the<br />
development of the special weapons there, like Ikara and Malkara and others<br />
of that sort I do not find myself counting any years that the locust has eaten.<br />
But there is more to be done.<br />
If we leave space for a moment, and the other examples I have<br />
given, and go to the other extine, that is to the wealth of our natural<br />
resources in the hard earth of this ancient continent, we find that here too the<br />
technologists have blazed new trails in the past decade. This -is where we<br />
have had some of our most spectacular successas in national development,<br />
and inevitably the demand for skilled manpower has increased heavily.<br />
You all know of the discoveries that have been made in the iron<br />
ore country in the west and north west of the continent, and of the millions<br />
of tons which lie there to be exploited to enrich the nation, and of the bauxite<br />
and manganese that is now being taken from the gulf country. In these<br />
remote areas, all the skills of the scientists and technologists are required,<br />
because the areas are thirsty lands, uninhabited for the most part, and<br />
lacking ports and sources of fuel and power.<br />
Yet the challenge has been taken up, settlements are developing,<br />
and now ports are being established on barren coasts. The petroleum search<br />
in this country vmhich began in earnest twenty years ago, i5s havi~ ng its<br />
first successes. VWe now have commercial oilfields in Queensland and<br />
Western Australia, and while they provide only a fraction of our needs, they<br />
may well be seen as signposts to further discoveries.<br />
In recent years too, there have been some important inland<br />
gas strikes in C%; ueensland, South Australia, Wlestern Australia and Northern<br />
Territory. Last year we had the drambitic discovery of substantial gas / 7 </p>
<p>-7<br />
flows from the three offshore wells on the Gippsland shelf in Victoria.<br />
This has opened up a new phase in petroleum exploration, and has provided<br />
a new challenge to the technologists to handle the complicated task of<br />
extracting gas from below the seas and bringing it to your home and mine,<br />
and to the industries of this country.<br />
The more I look at these events, and over the wi'de sweep of<br />
national development, the more I realise that the needs for the future are<br />
not only in skilled manpower and in sane co-operative huiman industrial<br />
relations, but capital requirements, in new techniques and at all levels<br />
of management, if we are to secure maximum results.<br />
The extent to which overseas capital is being applied to our<br />
affairs is a subject of regular and continuing controversy. It is only fair<br />
to say, though, that the initial impetus to the development of some of our<br />
new -found mineral resources would not have come, had A ustralian industry<br />
not had access to substantial quantities of overseas capital. just on<br />
per cent, certainly 85 to 90 per cent of our investment in Australia, comes<br />
from our own sources, and that extra 1C to 15 per cent has had a great<br />
value for us. Ike have got off to a good start, but it is important to spell out<br />
once again some principles which the government regards Is of first<br />
importance. I could summarise them best this way.<br />
W7-e will continue to need overseas capital, and we will need to<br />
have it in a regular and substant-al way. just on 90 per cent of it has come<br />
to us from the United Kingdom and the United States, and both tbose countries<br />
at the present time have found it necessary to impose some restraints on<br />
their capital inflow. We have seen this reflected in a good trading year in<br />
the drop in our overseas reserves, because the capital inflow has fallen<br />
sharply below that of the year before.<br />
We have an obligation as a government, and you have an<br />
obligation as leaders in industry, to ensure that where practicable an<br />
Australian equity is established. And I am glad to say that this attitude of<br />
ours is becoming increasingly appreciated by those who bring their capital,<br />
their skills, and accept ti-e hazards of investment here in Australia.<br />
In the last few weeks the government has announced a plan,<br />
drawn up in association with the private banks, to help industry finance<br />
major capital works. Most of the capital will be generated within Australia.<br />
Overseas capital will also have its own useful place. Thi s is one of the<br />
measures which the government has been considering for a long time, to<br />
ensure that we have sufficient funds to develop our resources and to have an<br />
Australian participation in their ownership.<br />
The government certainly does not want to discourage overseas<br />
capital, but it is deeply conscious of the anxieties that hate been expressed<br />
in the past, and my Government will do what needs to be done to ensure that<br />
there is no wastage of an Australian entitlement to our vast natural resources.<br />
THREE POINTS TO NOTE<br />
There are some points I would like to make by wvay of<br />
conclusion, which I feel are important, as you discuss the application of<br />
technological changes to our society. </p>
<p>-8<br />
The first is the need to know. By this I mean that a government's<br />
readiness to help in the technological fedand to assist in the translation of<br />
new methods into our society, can be effective only if governments and<br />
industry are clear about what they want to do and where they are going.<br />
It is, for instance, no good giving lip service to our drive for<br />
new markets, unless exporters are ready to try their products in these<br />
markets, instead of waiting . unil the other fellow has opened the door. The<br />
same applies in the technological field.<br />
The second point is readiness to venture It is not in anybody's<br />
interest to hold back until a government umbreba7 is spread over a new<br />
enterprise to protect it from all risk. By the same token, I think that the<br />
Australian entrepreneur can take some stimulus and encouragement from the<br />
way in which others with capital to invest from oversea-s have taken on<br />
difficult projects, even with hazardous or dubious prospects, and shown that<br />
there are opportunities here and Jif we show the enterprise to take advantage<br />
of them. I do not say that the Government never opens an umbrella over<br />
industry. It has very special respons Jbili11ties. For example, in the<br />
preservation of an effective tariff system. It also has responsibilities for<br />
subsidies in specific areas, and for wide-ranging incentives, not only by<br />
direct grants, but by taxation concessions and other methods. But there<br />
remains always a large area of self help, and this is not only an industry<br />
responsibility, but an individual responsibility.<br />
The third point is the level and competence of top management<br />
and this goes for governments, mine included, as well as frindustry. There<br />
are unexploited opportunities here and I am glad that this is implied in your<br />
selection of subjects for discussion. There is a growing sophistication in<br />
our industry; this is amply demonstrated in so many ways and Jit is important<br />
that top management should have the appropriate qualifications to deal with<br />
it. I feel our universities and our industrialists can, together, do a<br />
great deal to secure this objective. It would be fatal to all we seek to do if<br />
there were a " brain drain" from this country at a time when we need the skills<br />
of the technologists and the competence of management most. Fortunately,<br />
at the present time Australia is attracting more scientists than she is losing.<br />
There is one final word. I have recently been int.,. sia for the<br />
third time as Frime Minister. This is our region of special interest and for<br />
more than a quarter of a century we have been giving technical aid both in<br />
manpower and materials to the underdeveloped countries. Under the Golombo<br />
Plan we have given, in technical assistance ( as distinct from economic<br />
assistance), something like $ 0million to African and Asian countries.<br />
Through SEATO we have given over $ 14 million, mainly in the technical<br />
field, and through a number of other agencies, bilateral and multilateral, we<br />
have contributed sevec-al more millions.<br />
This may not be large when matched against the total need but<br />
this direct help is continuing and J ncteasing and stands as a constant reminder<br />
that our technological assets are suff iciently high for us to be able to export<br />
them to needy countries. Is there any better bridge between humanity and<br />
technology, than this? Is there any better service to the nation? </p>
