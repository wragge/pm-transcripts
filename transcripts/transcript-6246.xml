<p>President Reagan</p>
<p>" Please accept sincere condolences from the Australian<br />Government and people on the tragic loss of life and injuries<br />suffered by American marines and soldiers, members of the<br />multinational peacekeeping force in Beirut. Australia pays<br />tribute to the statesmanship and the generosity of spirit of<br />United States efforts to find a peaceful settlement to the<br />conflict'in Lebanon, both through your leading role in the<br />multinational peacekeeping force and your continuing efforts to<br />achieve negotiation between representatives of all sides to the<br />conflict. The difficulties and danger of these tasks have been<br />tragically demonstrated by yesterday's appalling events."</p>
<p><br />President Mitterrand<br />" Please accept sincere condolences from the Australian Government and people on the tragic loss of life and injuries suffered by French members of the multinational peacekeeping<br />force in Beirut. We pay tribute to the French servicemen-who died in the cause of efforts to restore peace in Lebanon. France's willingness to provide forces for this difficult and important task is greatly appreciated by all those concerned. Yesterday's terrible events are tragic evidence of the dangers<br />involved."</p>
