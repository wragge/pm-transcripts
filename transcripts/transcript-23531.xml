    <content><![CDATA[<p>To mark the 70th anniversary of the D-Day landings and Normandy campaign, I will attend an official commemoration in France on June 6.</p>
<p>More than 3,000 Australians fought in support of the D-Day landings, 18 were killed.</p>
<p>I will join French President Francois Hollande and other heads of government at the British services at the Bayeux Cathedral and Cemetery and the international ceremony at Sword Beach, Ouistreham.</p>
<p>Seven Australian D-Day veterans will accompany me for the commemorative services – Robert Cowper OAM, Stuart Davis, Phillip Elger, Francis Evans, Ronald Houghton, Billy Purdy and Frederick Riley.</p>
<p>On June 7 I will visit the Western Front to pay tribute to the 295,000 Australians who served there between 1916 and 1918 and honour the 46,000 who lost their lives. I will visit the Australian National Memorial at Villers-Bretonneux and Pozieres.</p>
<p>As part of the 100th anniversary of ANZAC, I would like to see a greater focus on Australia’s role on the western front. The Government is considering constructing an interpretive centre at Villers-Bretonneux.</p>
<p>Following my visit to France, I will travel to Canada and the United States of America to hold formal talks with the Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper and US President Barack Obama.</p>
<p>The US and Canada are important strategic partners of Australia. I will be accompanied by a business delegation to strengthen trade and business ties between our countries.</p>
<p>I will visit Ottawa, New York, Washington, Houston and Pearl Harbour.</p>
