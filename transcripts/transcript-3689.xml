MINISTERIAL STATEMENT INDO-CHINA. THE HON. E. G. WHITLAM,<br />
PRIME MINISTER. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES<br />
8 APRIL 1975<br />
Thirty years ago France attempted to re-establish<br />
her fallen empire in Indo-China. A war for independence<br />
became a war of massive foreign intervention. It engulfed<br />
a region. It challenged the might and will of the greatest<br />
powor on earth. It made a wilderness of somte of'the fairest<br />
portions of the globe. Thu most tranquil city in Asia<br />
Phnomn Penh has been made, in the wo.-rds of the Member for<br />
Kooyonq, a mire of human misery. CuntL-es of old civilisations<br />
have been madu cities of death. The war unleashe. d on a<br />
peasant people the heaviest bombing in history and the greatest<br />
fire power used in history. Not less than two million have<br />
been killed. Countless more have been maimed. Yet the war<br />
continues. It is ten years this month since Sir Robert Menzies<br />
announced the commitment of the First Australian Battalion<br />
to Vietnam. Since then it has been the duty of successive<br />
Prime Ministers to report to Parliament and people on<br />
-Australian activities, on Australian actions, including<br />
activity by the armed services, in Indo-China. I am now<br />
the fifth Australian Prime Minister to have to fulfil that<br />
duty but with this difference: for the first time an<br />
Australian Prime Minister need report only on our humanitarian<br />
involvement, including the use of the armed services, and<br />
our endeavours to end the war rather than escalate the<br />
war. After all these years, after all the blunders<br />
and bloodshed of thirty years, what tolerable or feasible<br />
objective can any foreign government set for itself except<br />
the ending of the war, except the ending of the killing<br />
as soon as possible. We outsiders never had the right to intervene.<br />
But even if there were such a right or even if it was right<br />
to intervene, would anyone now suggest that any foreign<br />
government should resume that intervention? If we have learnt<br />
nothing else in the last thirty years we have surely learnt<br />
this much, at a heavy cost to ourselves but at a terrible one<br />
to the people we claimed to be helping.<br />
For a generation and more, Australia shared with<br />
her Pacific partners a great delusion about our rights,<br />
our interests, our obligations. Those who acted for Australia<br />
as a government mistook entirely the nature of Australia's<br />
interests and obligations and her rights. They shared, and<br />
encouraged the Australian people to accept, a delusion about<br />
the nature of the conflict in Indo-China. All of us are still<br />
paying the price for those mistakes in economic cost, in<br />
loss of confidence in Western civilisation itself. We can<br />
repair the losses, other than the lives destroyed. But to<br />
do so it is necessary not to repeat the mistakes of the past<br />
not just the mistakes in action but the mistakes of attitude.<br />
It was a mistaken attitude after the revolution in China that<br />
led step by step to the mistaken view of Australian interests<br />
and American interests and mistaken actions in Indo-China.<br />
Surely we have learnt our lesson at last. </p>
<p>-2-<br />
Por twenty years there has been a kind of tragic<br />
inevitability about the events now takingj place. The great<br />
chance, the great opportunity for a political settlement,<br />
L017uac thr-uujhouL Inido-China was Ov en . in 1954 by the<br />
Geneva Agreements. The chance was lost, the opportunity was<br />
thrown away. The Geneva Agreements provided the two basic<br />
ingredients Eor a political settlement re-unification<br />
after free elections. If such elections had been held, they<br />
Would almost certainly have resulted in the power over a<br />
un'i. ld Victnam under 11o Chi Minh. Rather th. in face this<br />
prospect the regime in Saigon, urged on by thie then United<br />
States Administration, refused to hold elections. The result<br />
I been that an outcome whiich might have beutn achieved<br />
by political means twenty years ago, an outcome certainly<br />
foreseen by the parties to the Geneva Agreements, whether<br />
they welcomed it or not, now seems likely to be achieved only<br />
after these twenty more years of bloodshed.<br />
The next great effort to achieve a political solution<br />
resulted in the Paris Agreements of January, 1973. Once again<br />
those Agreements envisaged a government of one Vietnam with<br />
participation of all parties, not just the governments of<br />
Saigon and Hanoi but the Provisional Revolutionary Government<br />
the Vietcong so called. Neither the Geneva Agreements nor<br />
the Paris Agreements ever allowed the idea that North and<br />
South Vietnam were two separate countries. As Article<br />
of the Paris Agreements states: " The military demarcation line<br />
between the two zones at the seventeenth parallel is only<br />
provisional and not a political or territorial boundary,<br />
as provided for in Paragraph 6 of the final declaration of<br />
the 1954 Geneva Conference." In other words, from 1954 to the<br />
present day, from the fall of Dien Bien Phu 21 years ago to<br />
the fall of Hue two weeks ago, the war in Vietnam has retained<br />
its essential character. It is a civil war. The real<br />
character of the war has never changed. What has changed<br />
is the nature of the fighting and the level of violence.<br />
That change, with all the additional suffering and killing it<br />
has caused, is overwhelmingly due to one factor foreign<br />
intervention. The real result of foreign intervention,<br />
principally the United States on the side of Saigon and<br />
Russia on the side of Hanoi, has been to raise the level of<br />
violence, to raise the capacity for mutual destruction on<br />
both sides. That is, if the two sides insisted on a solution<br />
by military means, then foreign intervention made it certain<br />
that the end whatever the outcome would be as bloody<br />
as possible. What outsiders, including Australia, have done<br />
is to create two of the world's largest armies. That is our<br />
real legacy to Vietnam. That is almost the sole military<br />
result of years of intervention. Let those who year after year<br />
encouraged a military solution, those who decried as weakness<br />
or even treason the calls for negotiations and the calls for<br />
political settlement, now, and at last, recognise the real<br />
consequences of their work. These strongmen, these realists,<br />
the men on horse-back, insisted upon a military solution.<br />
So a military solution it is now to be. / 3 </p>
<p>-3-<br />
It should also be emphasised that both the Geneva<br />
Aqre Iflcnts and~ the Paris Agjreements onvisa ' jed that all<br />
conte. nding parties would share political responsibility in<br />
a re-united Vietnam. The Geneva Agreements envisaged free<br />
elections. The Paris Agreements provided for a National<br />
Reconciliation Council, to arranye for general elections<br />
in South Vietnam. Article 12 stated:<br />
" Itmmediately after the cease-fire, the South Vietnamese<br />
parties shall hold consultations in a spirit of national<br />
reconciliation and concord, mutual respect, and mutual<br />
non-elimination to set up a national council of national<br />
reconciliation and concord of three equal segments.<br />
After the National Council of National Reconciliation and<br />
Concord has assumed its functions, the two South Vietnamese<br />
parties will consult about the formation of councils at<br />
lower levels. The two South Vietnamese parties shall sign<br />
an Agreement on the internal matters of South Vietnam as soon<br />
as possible and do their ' utmost to accomplish this within<br />
ninety days after the cease-fire comes into effect."<br />
This was the crucial political article of the Paris<br />
Agreements. The Saigon Government has refused to act to implement<br />
this central provision. It has not been prepared to join<br />
with the Provisional Revolutionary Government. This breach is<br />
the key to the justification for military retaliation claimed<br />
by the opponents of the Saigon Government.<br />
Because the political opportunities have been for<br />
a second time lost, a military solution became inevitable<br />
in the broader sense. This does not mean, however, that the<br />
actual and specific events of the past three weeks were<br />
themselves inevitable. The over-running of so much of<br />
South Vietnam is by no means a classic example of a blitzkreig.<br />
In very large measure the North Vietnamese forces have been<br />
moving into a military vacuum. The United States' Defence<br />
Secretary, Mr Schlesinger, said on 31 March that it was Saigon's<br />
withdrawal rather than a communist general offensive which<br />
was the primary cause of the Government of Vietnam's present<br />
difficulties. President Ford said on 3 April: " A unilateral<br />
decision to withdraw created the chaotic situation that exists<br />
now. It was a unilateral decision by President Thieu."<br />
To state these facts is not to condone breaches of the<br />
Paris Agreements by North Vietnam. There have been gross<br />
breaches repeatedly by both sides. It is just a plain<br />
statement of fact that the immediate chaotic situation north<br />
of Saigon is due to the unilateral decision by President Thieu.<br />
In the words of the Australian Journalist Denis Warner<br />
close as he is to military councils in Saigon " The shattering<br />
loss of central Vietnam, which has swung the balance of forces<br />
entirely in Hanoi's favour, was not caused by enemy action but<br />
by hideous blunders in Saigon." The decision to withdraw and,<br />
perhaps even more importantly, the way it was made, with no<br />
explanation, no consultation, no communication, had two immediate<br />
res ults. It destroyed the morale of the Army of the Republic<br />
of Vietnam and it spread panic to the population. / 4 </p>
<p>-4-<br />
It is in this situation of unparalleled chaoc and<br />
unexpectud rapidity of events unexpected in lhanoi itself<br />
tliat t AutLrian Government has tried Lo apply its<br />
resources to save lives, to relieve sufferinig.<br />
It must be emphasi. sed that the suddonness of the<br />
collipse in South Vietnam ] imited the scuie ind effectiveness<br />
ol tliy aid given by the Au.; t. ra] in GovenmL( J!. ur by any other<br />
. government. Members of the Opposil. ion have clo:;( n to belittle<br />
our efforts. For example, the Leader of the Opposition<br />
particularised our participation in the attempted evacuation<br />
01. Danang as a " futile and pathetic gesture too little,<br />
too late." The truth is that the Australian Government met,<br />
as soon as it was received through the American Embassy,<br />
a reqLuest from the Government of South Vietricm flor assistance.<br />
The decision wa* taken to make available seven lercules transport<br />
aircraft together with other aircraft currently based at<br />
B utterworth in Malaysia. On 2 April I received the following<br />
message: " Please accept my warm appreciation and deep<br />
admiration for your help to evacuate the<br />
many desperate refugees from Danang. Australia<br />
can take great pride in the rapid decision to<br />
meet an absolutely essential humanitarian<br />
requirement. Warmest respect. ( Signed)<br />
Admiral Noel Gayler, United States Commander<br />
in Chief Pacific."<br />
The Australian Government last year contributed<br />
$ 1.15million to international organisations to be spent in<br />
Indo-China on both sides during the current financial<br />
year. On 28 March the Australian Government announced a<br />
further contribution of $ 200,000 to the Indo-China Operations<br />
Group of the International Red Cross, which operates throughout<br />
Indo-China. On 2 April I announced a further contribution<br />
of $ 1 million to the U. N. -High Commissioner for Refugees'<br />
relief work among refugees in all parts of Indo-China, on both<br />
sides of the lines of military control. On 3 April I opened<br />
a public appeal for a $ 5 million refugee aid fund, to be<br />
co-ordinated by the Disaster Emergency Committee of the<br />
Australian Council for Overseas Aid.<br />
Yesterday the Minister for Foreign Affairs announced<br />
a further grant of $ 1 million to the United Nations High<br />
Commissioner for Refugees. This brings the total Australian<br />
Government aid to international humanitarian organisations<br />
operating in Indo-China to $ 3.4 million.<br />
The action which has attracted most attention is of<br />
course the bringing of children to Australia. In this matter,<br />
the sole role of the Australian Government was to bring eligible<br />
children to suitable adoptive families as promptly and as<br />
safely as possible. Nobody has been helped by unfounded claims<br />
that vast numbers of orphans were waiting for evacuation from<br />
Saigon. </p>
<p>At all times, the Australian Govenments has been<br />
bound to require two conditions: that orphans would be approved<br />
for exit from Saigon by the South VietnameseGovernment<br />
for adoption in Australia, and that the States would guarantee<br />
that normal adoption procedures would be observed.<br />
As soon as the Australian Governunent received advice<br />
that t hu uJrst JL: equi. umtinL 1,1d b . i melt, ad II i at on thu sec: old,<br />
the States had approved 246 adopting families, arrangements<br />
were made to bring the orphans by Hercules transport to Bangkok<br />
and by chartered Qantas jet to Sydney. Austriilian Government<br />
authorities found that many of the children evacuated from<br />
Saigon were the subject of uncompleted off shore adoption<br />
procedures in South Vietnam by Australian nationals. Faced<br />
with this fact, my Government determined that it could do<br />
nothing in the matter of allocating children to families as<br />
this was clearly a State responsibility and therefore if<br />
there was to be any disagreement between adoptive families<br />
about the children then it was a matter for the States to<br />
determine. The Government had arranged for an aircraft to<br />
depart Sydney yesterday afternoon for Bangkok to evacuate<br />
a second group of orphans. That aircraft did not take off,<br />
following advice from our Ambassador in Saigon that the South<br />
Vietnamese authorities decided not to release any more<br />
chi ldren as they wished to reconsider their policy on adoption<br />
by foreign nationals. Our Ambassador has been unable to<br />
confirm reports that this decision has since been reversed.<br />
I should point out, however, that the decision<br />
i elf amply demonstrates that there is no large pool<br />
of' orphans awaiting urgent evacuation and, further, that<br />
the Saigon Government has properly insisted on the performance<br />
of its own policies and procedures. / 6 </p>
<p>The actions of the Government in the immediate<br />
emergency are part of the lonqstandinq program and policy<br />
we have adopted since achieving office. our immediate<br />
objective has been to do what we can to stop the fighting,<br />
to bring the war to an end. our long-term objective has<br />
been to help rebuild a devastated Vietnam and help<br />
rehabilitate its peop: le. We hiave cons is itc~) ly pursued<br />
both objectives since December 1972. The most important<br />
step open to Australia to reduce the level of violence was<br />
always to stop contributing militarily to that violence.<br />
Within a week of taking office we ordered the end of<br />
Australia's military involvement in Vietnam and Cambodia.<br />
The second contribution open to Australia was to<br />
use diplomatic influcnce to end the fighting. In particular<br />
tho Australian Government has tried to promtote adherence<br />
to the Paris Agreements. We have lost no opportunity to<br />
encourage the. Vietnamese parties to implement the Agreements<br />
to the full, and to deplore the breaches of the Agreements<br />
by both sides. And, of course, we have been able to do<br />
this only because we are diplomatically represented in<br />
both Saigon and Hanoi.<br />
These attitudes have consistently been expressed<br />
over the past 15 months by me and by the Foreign Minister<br />
at the highest level, and by personal contact between<br />
Vietnamese ministers and officials and some of my colleagues,<br />
including the Deputy Prime Minister and the Minister for<br />
Defence. As recently as 13 March I wrote to both President<br />
Thieu and the North Vietnamese Foreign Minister stressing<br />
Australia's support for the implementation of the Agreements,<br />
our concern at the continued lack of progress, the continued<br />
fighting and the continuing breaches of the Agreements by<br />
both sides. The fact is that the Australian Government has<br />
been foremost among nations in seeking to end the war and<br />
relieve the suffering it has caused. In this immediate<br />
emergency, no government has been more active, more<br />
concerned and, reflecting the wishes of the Australian<br />
people, more generous. And it is worth noting the real<br />
reason why the Australian people expect their Government<br />
so to act. Why does Vietnam invoke a very special kind<br />
of emotion and concern and compassion in Australia? It's<br />
not just the scale and extent of the suffering, which is<br />
not, unhappily, unique, not even unusual in this troubled<br />
world. The refugee, the homeless, the starving, the<br />
innocent victims of war number millions upon millions<br />
across three continents. But Vietnam has a power over the<br />
Australian conscience for one particular reason. The<br />
Australian people have accepted the truth, the bitter<br />
truth, that the intervention into which they were led was<br />
disastrously wrong, that it only increased and lengthened<br />
the agony of Vietnam. The Australian people have acknowledged<br />
the truth in the same way that the American people and the<br />
American Congress have acknowledged it. But is the truth<br />
of the disaster acknowledged by its authors and their<br />
abettors? </p>
<p>Onie of the miost depressing aspects of this whole<br />
tragic episode has been the lamentable performance of<br />
the Opposition in the past two weeks. I've listened<br />
with increasing dismay and contempt to the statements by<br />
spokesmen for the Opposition. I pass over the humbug<br />
mnd hypocrisy par for thc course 7 huit the truly depressing<br />
thlinig ha s been the mounit ing ev i denice thim with the<br />
Oppos it ion nothing has chanjed Ten yeatus of destruct ionl<br />
have changed nothing. The present Leader of the Opposition<br />
has even revived the doimino theory, smai-tly dismnissed by<br />
the Pr ime Mini ster OF Singapore as " old hash". T1he onec<br />
great constant in the attitudeI Of the Ipar1ties OJpoSite to<br />
the war in Vietnam, throughout the period of Australia' s<br />
involvement, was thei~ r determnination to squeeze every drop of<br />
po1 itical advantage out ol it., Anid eveni iii the Final. thr-oes,<br />
they're at it again. One could hear all the echoes from the<br />
past, right from that unforgettable night ten years ago,<br />
28 April 1965, when from this side of the House they bayed<br />
and brayed with a delight they didn't bother to conceal as<br />
Sir Robert Menzies announced the first instalment of Australia's<br />
military cohimitmient. It was their finest hour. They laughed<br />
as they lied their way into this war. But throughout the<br />
subsequent years, in any debate which had to deal with any<br />
American initiatives to disengage or dc-escalate * the war,<br />
they were notable for their sullen silence. The only occasion<br />
their spirits revived was when, five years ago<br />
President Nixon unleashed the South Vietnamese Army upon<br />
Cambodia, escalating the war to its most ferocious level and<br />
transforming a haven of fragile peace into a war-ravaged<br />
wilderness. In the orchestrated outpourings of the past week there<br />
has been just one new note muted as yet, but clearly designed<br />
to become a grand new theme, and that is that the United States<br />
is an untrustworthy ally. The irony of it! We are witnessing<br />
the beginning of a new effort to sow the seeds of fear and<br />
suspicion and division in Australia. What else is the purpose<br />
of this attemnpt to blame the United States Congress and the<br />
American people for the debacle in which the Government of<br />
South Vietnam now finds itself. There could be only one other<br />
motive to shame the United States back into Indo-China.<br />
Is this the wish of the Opposition? Is this their proposal<br />
for either the United States or Australia to get back into<br />
the war? to prolong it for yet another decade? If that<br />
is not their proposal, then what criticisin of substance can<br />
they have against my Government's attitudes or actions with<br />
regard to Indo-China, now or at any time in the past two<br />
years and four months?<br />
In the heady days when Vietnam was a popular war,<br />
when it was a political goldmine, before the people of<br />
Australia came to see its implications and consequences<br />
for Indo-China, for Australia, for the United States,<br />
the constant challenge imade in this House, not least<br />
from the present Leader of the Opposition, was, " stand<br />
up and be counted". Indeed, the first time this challenge<br />
was raised in this House was against me by the then<br />
Minister for External Affairs, now Lord Casey 21 years<br />
ago. It was in 1954 that in this House I first warned<br />
against Australian or American military involvement in<br />
Indo-China. Let the Members of the Opposition now stand<br />
up and be counted and say that they believe it was wrong </p>
<p>that we should have got completely out of the war or<br />
believe that the United States or Australia should go<br />
back inito the war.<br />
As to the United States, she has fulfilled any<br />
obligations she assumed to the Government of Saigon.<br />
Neither-thle honour nior thc initerests of a great people<br />
can bec confided to any particular foreigni regime. But<br />
the United States' honour and interests do lie in helping<br />
rebuild a unified Vietnam, the unification of which<br />
misguided policies, mistaken policies of the past so long<br />
delayed; the United States' honour and interest lie in<br />
helping to rebuild an Indo-China to the devastation of<br />
which those policies so greatly contributed. That is<br />
the way for the United States to regain her real place<br />
of leadership in our region. To helping in such a task,<br />
the Australian Government is already committed, indeed,<br />
already contributing. And in that task Australia, as<br />
far as this Government is concerned, will be a good<br />
partner with the United States.<br />
We will have no truck with those who put out<br />
the line that the United States should resume her<br />
intervention in the war. We will have no truck with<br />
any suggestion that America's honour or reputation<br />
requires resumed intervention. We will have no truck<br />
with those who seek to build a new philosophy of fear<br />
upon the unwarranted assertion of American dishonour<br />
in refusing to intervene with force on behalf of the<br />
Saigon Government. While the security of Australia has never rested<br />
solely upon the American alliance, that alliance remains<br />
a key element in it. And whatever the outcome of the<br />
events now unfolding in Vietnam, the basic elements<br />
of Australia's security remain untouched. </p>
<p>Who rules in Saigon is not, and never has been, an<br />
inqredient in Australia's security. Our strength, our<br />
cutr it. y reit on factoru aind crlationsh i p ultimately<br />
unchlanqud by these events. The really important factors<br />
. tnd rcolations are those, which have been davweloped by the<br />
Australt. ian Covernment. . ince oocumber 19;! our relations<br />
with our closest and largest neighbour Inidonesia, our<br />
rel. ations with our greatest trading partner Japan, our<br />
relations with China, our active support for development<br />
of co-operation between ASEAN members, our efforts to ensure<br />
that the Indian Ocean does not become the next area of<br />
confrontation between the super-powers as Indo-China<br />
became, in a sense, the first. Above all, Australia's<br />
security, as with the peace ot the world, rents ultimately<br />
upon mnaking the detete lhetwufln the Unite: d SI-ates and the<br />
Soviet Union a success and with associatingc China in a<br />

' Phis GovernmentI ha: s beun unr-umi ttinq i iLs efforts to<br />
strenqthen those relationships. Those ettorts have been<br />
rewarded with remarkable success.<br />
It is not possible that the nightmare of Vietnam<br />
will ever pass from the memory or the conscience of any<br />
man or woman of our time. Nor should it. But the work<br />
we are now doing to build good, constructive relations<br />
with peoples and nations throughout the world will outlive<br />
even that bitter memory, will outlast even the bad and<br />
destructive things inflicted on the people of Vietnam<br />
during the past thirty years. </p>
