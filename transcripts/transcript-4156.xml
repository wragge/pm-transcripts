F76/ 126<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR PRESS 14 JUNE 1976<br />
EMPLOYER/ EMPLOYEE ORGANISATIONS<br />
The policy statements issued by the Liberal Party and<br />
the National Country Party before the 1975 elections<br />
stressed the importance of communication between Government,<br />
employees and employers.<br />
We said that employers and employees should be encouraged<br />
to cooperate continually with each other on issues such<br />
as the working environment, industrial safety, and technology<br />
changes, and to de-elop a spirit of employee involvement.<br />
It was our view t: aZ employers and employees should establish<br />
continuing consul-naive machinery of their own choosing,<br />
designed to further communication and discussion and an<br />
understanding of -ie common interests of employees and<br />
employers. We . believed such discussions should be concerned<br />
with issues-jlocal to a particular establishment matters<br />
concerned with wider union issues being: conducted by the<br />
unions and industries involved.<br />
Many employers and employees already engage in discussions<br />
of the ktnd mentionecI. The-Gove-rniment--hopes, however;<br />
that communications between employers and employees will<br />
continue to improve, with arrangements of the kind envisaged<br />
in our policy statements being more widespread and established.<br />
I have recently arranged a survey of the consultative machinery<br />
which exists at the moment in areas of Commonwealth employment.<br />
I am pleased to report that in addition to the service-wide<br />
-consultation which takes place through the Joint Council, ./ 2 </p>
<p>many public service departments and statutory authorities<br />
have well developed formal and informal machinery established,<br />
and operating successfully, e. g.<br />
Joint Consultative Councils and Committees<br />
Management Service Advisory Committees<br />
Staff Development Advisory Committees<br />
Industrial Relations Units.<br />
Welfare Officers<br />
Joint Management/ Union Committee meetings and review groups<br />
Safety Committees<br />
Union Liaison Committees<br />
Staff Councils<br />
Senior Management field visits<br />
Regular ad hoc staff/ management meetings and discussions<br />
take place where no formal machinery exists 0<br />
Staff circulars and bulletins<br />
The Government, as an employer is furthering its policy by<br />
encouraging the establishment ' of appropriate consultative<br />
machinery, where ices not already exist, and by supporting<br />
the appropriate deTelopment and expansion of existing machinery<br />
both service-wide in the various individual areas of<br />
Commonwealth employv__ ent. </p>
