ZEEANFIRE , RELIEF<br />
The Commonwealth Government is to provide financial assistance<br />
for the reconstruction of the Scout Hall which was destroyed<br />
during the recent tragic fire at Zeehan, in Tasmania.<br />
The Scout Hall is an important public facility in Zeehan<br />
and for many years has been the centre point for community<br />
activities, particularly youth groups. Its loss has been<br />
a major blow to the entire community and the Commonwealth<br />
is pleased to join with the State Government in financing<br />
the cost of replacing it.<br />
The Commonwealth will be contributing $ 3 for every $ 1 spent<br />
by the State in:. meeting the cost.<br />
There are still major questions affecting the permanent<br />
re-housinc of the people of Zeehan to be settled between the<br />
Commonwealth and the State of Tasmania.<br />
The Pren-4ar has told me that he has formed a committee of<br />
officials to examine the ciuestiorn of p ermanent re-housing. I<br />
consider that there is a need for citizen representation on<br />
such a group and, accordingly', I have suggested to Premier Lowe<br />
that State and Federal Members of Parliament should be<br />
added to this Committee.<br />
The Commonwealth is of course contributing to the provision<br />
of emergency accommodation in the.-Area through the provision<br />
of caravans and the construction of additional facilities<br />
in the caravan park established to house fire victims.<br />
I can assure the people of Zeehan that their needs are<br />
being carefully examined by the Commonwealth. </p>
