NATIONAL WATER RESOURCES PROGRAMME<br />
The Prime Minister has written to State Premiers inviting<br />
them to nominate projects for consideration under the five<br />
year national water resources programme.<br />
The Commonwealth government is to contribute $ 200 million<br />
during this period and is seeking the Premiers' agreement to<br />
contribute equally with the Commonwealth in the programme in<br />
their States.<br />
The Government's intention to introduce this programme was<br />
announced before the recent election.<br />
The programme will encompass the provision of funds to the<br />
States, in grants and/ or loans, for programmes, projects or<br />
activities for:<br />
1. water supplies for urban and rural areas, including<br />
re-use 7:<br />
2. flood mitigation, land drainage and floodplain management<br />
proposals;<br />
3. proposals to deal with problems which represent a serious<br />
threat to the long-term use of existing water resources,<br />
with emphasis on water quality management, particularly<br />
salinity control;<br />
4. water resources assessment and research; and<br />
planning and management investigations of broad regional<br />
scope.<br />
Projects eligible for consideration under the programme include<br />
water conservation and supply, flood mitigation, water quality<br />
management, resources assessment and research.<br />
The programme will reflect merits of proposals and State priorities<br />
and will apply to both city and country projects.<br />
It is anticipated that the Commonwealth will begin considering<br />
proposals from the States before the presentation of the next<br />
Budget so that the programme can commence in 1978/ 79.<br />
