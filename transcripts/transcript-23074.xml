<h2>Transcript</h2>
<p>With Parliament coming back this week, I want to report to you on the progress that the new Government has made since the election to implement the commitments that we made to the Australian people; to stop the boats, to abolish the big new taxes, to get the budget under control and to build the roads of the 21<sup>st</sup> Century.</p>
<p>Already significant progress has been made. This week we saved the car industry from the former Labor government’s $1.8 billion tax. This week we saved small business people and nurses and teachers from Labor’s hit on self-education expenses and already the Commission of Audit is underway to make government more efficient and more effective. Already boat arrivals are down some 90 per cent from their peak under the former government in July – but there’s more to do and that’s the job of the Parliament this week.</p>
<p>You’ve already voted on the carbon tax but now it’s the Parliament’s turn. This is my bill to reduce your bills. Abolishing the carbon tax will reduce the average household’s cost of living by $550 a year. On average it’ll take $200 off your power bill and $70 off your gas bill. This is the first big job of the new Parliament and I want to assure you that as far as the Government is concerned, it will happen.</p>
<p>The Parliament is coming back and I want to assure you that as far as the Government is concerned the adults are back in charge – that’s what you expect, that’s what you want and that’s what you deserve.</p>
