    <content><![CDATA[<p>Australians will be sorry to learn of the death of a former Prime Minister, the Rt. Hon. Francis Michael Forde. Frank Forde was Federal Member for Capricornia from 1922 to 1946, and he also served in the Queensland State Parliament.</p>
<p>During the Second World War, he was Minister for the Army. He was also the Prime Minister of Australia for a short period in 1945 following the death of John Curtin, and he was the Deputy Leader of the Federal Parliamentary'Labor Party for fourteen years. He was the last serving member of the Scullin Ministery, and is remembered for his kindliness and compassion.</p>
<p>On behalf of the Government and the people of Australia, I extend my sympathies to his family.</p>
