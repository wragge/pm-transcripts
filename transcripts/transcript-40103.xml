    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Indian Ocean tsunami that occurred almost 11 years ago tragically took the lives of approximately 230,000 people â€“ 26 of whom called Australia home.</p>
<p>On Boxing Day 2004, a 9.1 magnitude earthquake struck off the west coast of Sumatra, Indonesia. The resulting tsunami was one of the most horrific natural disasters in recorded history.</p>
<p>All Australians were affected by the tsunami, but none more so than the families of our Australians who lost their lives.</p>
<p>It is important we have a place where relatives of the Australians who died can gather as they share a special bond. Nobody else can understand what they went through.</p>
<p>The tsunami memorial being unveiled in Canberra today will provide a place where Australians, particularly the relatives, can meet to reflect on the natural disaster and remember the Australians who lost their lives.</p>
