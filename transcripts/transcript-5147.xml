PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 20 SEPTEMBER 1979<br />
COMMITTEE-ON OFFIC IAL ESTABLISHMENTS<br />
For the information of Honourable Members, I present the final<br />
report of the Conmmittee on Official Establishments and seek<br />
leave to make a statement on the report.<br />
Honourable Members may recall that the Interim Report of the<br />
Committee was tabled in May 1977.<br />
This independent committee was appointed by the Government in<br />
September 1976 to advise on the operation, conservation and longer<br />
term development of the four official residences of the Commonwealth<br />
Government Government House and the Lodge in Canberra, and<br />
Admiralty House and Kirribilli House in Sydney.<br />
The Chairman of the Committee was Mr Andrew Grimwade, and its<br />
other members were Mr Guilford Bell, Dame Helen Blaxland,<br />
the Honourable James Cope, and Mrs Ruth Gullett.<br />
I wish to thank Mr Grimwade and all the members of the Committee<br />
for their work which has involved a considerable sacrifice of<br />
their own time.<br />
The four establishments are official residences serving the<br />
ongoing needs of Government. The buildings have already been<br />
declared part of the national estate and are well worthwhile<br />
preserving as symbolic items in our country's history and cultural<br />
heritage.<br />
Already these four residences contain significant items of<br />
Australiana which include pieces of early Australian furniture<br />
and works of art. For example, a short while ago a notable<br />
portrait of Mr Watson, the first Labor Prime Minister, came<br />
into possession of the Australiana Fund, and that now hangs<br />
in the Lodge.<br />
The report recommends that there be continuing machinery in the<br />
form of a permanent advisory trust to be responsible for advice<br />
to Government on the conservation, development and efficient<br />
operation of the buildings and grounds of the official<br />
establishments. The Government agrees that such continuing machinery is necessary<br />
and is establishing a permanent body to be known as the Official<br />
Establishments Trust. Most of the other recommendations of the<br />
Committee have been accepted. / 2 </p>
<p>-2-<br />
Included in these is the proposal that the trust evaluate<br />
which of two sites is the more appropriate for a possible<br />
new Prime Ministerial residence, which one day may be necessary.<br />
So that the second site may be-released for other purposes,<br />
the Government is asking the new trust to advise, as soon as<br />
possible, which of the two sites is the more suitable.<br />
I emphasise that no decision has been taken to build a new<br />
Prime Ministerial residence.<br />
The present Lodge is serving its function well and is<br />
expected to continue to do so for a long time to come.<br />
A few of the Committee's recommendations will be referred to the<br />
permanent body for further consideration. These cover suggested<br />
working arrangements in the financial area and require further<br />
consideration before decisions are reached.<br />
The Government has decided not to accept recommendations that<br />
future planning for Government House be based on eventual<br />
demolition of existing structures other than the historic<br />
stables. Nor does it accept at this time the proposal that official<br />
establishment facilities be provided in Melbourne. Both proposals<br />
would involve expenditure outlay which the Government sees<br />
as inconsistent with the general restraint it is currently<br />
maintaining on its spending.<br />
Implementation of the recommendations accepted will1, of course,<br />
be subject to examination and funds approval in the normal<br />
budgetary processes.<br />
I seek leave to table, for the information of Honourable Members,<br />
a listing of those recommendations accepted, those rejected,<br />
and those to be referred to the new permanent body.<br />
Once again, I thank the Committee for their work. As a result of<br />
their efforts the Government now has a firm basis on which to plan<br />
for the conservation and future development of the official<br />
establishments, an important part of Australia's herifage.<br />
I am pleased to be able to inform the House that, Mr Andrew Grimwade<br />
as Chairman, Mr Guilford Bell, Dame Helen Blaxland,<br />
the Honourable James Cope, and Mrs Ruth Gullett have agreed to<br />
become the inaugural members of the Official Establishments Trust.<br />
