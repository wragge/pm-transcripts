BBC " MONEY" PROGRAMME<br />
TV INTERVIEW WITH THE PRIME MINIST<br />
THE KTM90N7JHN. ,, T<br />
Interviewer: Mr. John Tusa r<br />
Recorded on 24 April 1969 for screening on 8 May 196<br />
Q. What do you see Prime. Minister as the dangers from a<br />
completely " open door" policy towards foreign investment?<br />
PM. I suppose a possible danger would be something which<br />
was, in its effects even greater than the effects, say, of American<br />
investment in Canada. Those, I suppose, one could indicate in this<br />
way. First, I think it is true to say that in Canada about fifty per cent<br />
of the earnings, or dividends at any rate, made by companies leave<br />
Canada. And, secondly, there is a possible danger in the control by<br />
some headquarters company outside a country of companies operating<br />
inside a country. An example of that sort of control and I am not<br />
saying it is a bad thing that happened but an example, I think, was<br />
the instruction, as it were, given by a motor car company in the United<br />
States to a motor car con-pany which it owned in Canada that its<br />
products were not to be sold in a particular area. That is the sort of<br />
problem that one might run into and I say might.<br />
Q. What made you raise this sort of storm warning about<br />
the dangers of foreign investment at this particular time?<br />
PM. I don't think I raised a storm warning so much about<br />
the dangers of foreign investment because we must have foreign<br />
investment we must have it and we must have it in large quantities<br />
in order to develop at all. What I did raise was the desire of the<br />
Australian Government that Australians should be allowed to participate,<br />
and be given an opportunity to participate, in the enterprises which<br />
foreign investment made possible. I flagged that desire quite strongly.<br />
Q. But do you think that even doing this has scared off any<br />
foreign investment?<br />
PM. No, I don't think it has scared off any at all. I've seen<br />
no figures to indicate that the foreign investment has dropped or foreign<br />
interest in investment has dropped. And I draw your attention to the<br />
announcement made just the other day of this huge investment in the<br />
Robe River development project, which I am glad to say is to be at<br />
least 25 per cent in regard to equity offered to Australians.<br />
Q. Could you define your Government's attitude to the<br />
question of foreign takeovers of existing Australian companies? What<br />
would you like to see happen there? / 2 </p>
<p>72-<br />
PM. Well, the first thing I would like to see happen is for<br />
companies to know whether in fact they were in the process of being<br />
taken over by foreign companies. In other words, I would like to see<br />
that shares in Australian companies held in the -names of nominees,<br />
once they reached a certain percentage of the total shares, had by law<br />
to be openly described as being in the beneficial ownership of the<br />
particular overseas company, or indeed the internal company that<br />
owned them. This, think, is in line with what is done in the United<br />
Kingdom and in the United States. That is one of the first things, so<br />
one would know what was going on, so that the companies would know<br />
what was going on. Secondly, one would want to see that an approach<br />
to take over an Australian company was properly made and was not<br />
made on a basis of " first come first served" offers, but made on the<br />
basis which . all the shareholders would know about and. all the shaxeholders<br />
could consider and all the sh~ treholders could decide upon. Those are<br />
a couple of points.<br />
Q. But you said you were concerned about efficient<br />
Australian companies being taken over just because they were a good<br />
going concern. Is there anything you can do about this in practice?<br />
PM. Well, I am not sure whether legally at the moment there<br />
is anything one can do about it in practice. Also, of course, one has<br />
some difficulty obviously in saying, " Well, this is efficient. This is<br />
inefficient". In the broad, it is easy enough to see in particular cases.<br />
It is also possible to imagine that even efficient companies could, by<br />
partnership rather than takeover I would sooner see it done by<br />
partnership with some other company bring in more technological<br />
expertise, more managerial expertise. So it is very difficult thoroughly<br />
to define. But there is in the United Kingdom power, at any rate. under<br />
I think the Exchange Control, for a government to say, no matter what<br />
the shareholders may want, " This particular company is so important<br />
to the United Kingdom nationally that we would not allow it to be taken<br />
over. We will use our Exchange Control". We, to some extent, do<br />
this in Australia now. We do not allow foreign banks to come into<br />
Australia. We do not allow civil aviation companies from abroad to<br />
operate in Australia or to take over Australian companies. I think<br />
the same applies to our television companies. So there are areas<br />
already where the Government has said, " Well, we don't believe that<br />
these areas should be allowed to be invaded". I don't see us extending<br />
areas but it would be worth looking at, and is being looked at to see<br />
whether there should be some legal capacity for a government to say,<br />
in a case of a particular company let's, for example, take BHP, an<br />
enormous Australian company to say, " Well, we wouldn't want this<br />
company to be taken over. We would wish to be able to stop it". It<br />
would have to be an ad hoc decision in each case and very rarely made<br />
and publicly known. / 3 </p>
<p>3-<br />
Q. Now, what about the question of equity participation in<br />
new developments. You say you want a greater Australian equity<br />
participation. Now, how are you going to get this?<br />
PM. Well, I think that in the case of any reputable company,<br />
clear statements of the government's requirements do have an effect.<br />
Indeed I believe they have had an effect, since we have been making it<br />
clear that this is what we want. We have some examples even before<br />
saying so strongly what we would like of the sort of things that<br />
Australia would wish to see. I believe that the fifty per cent partnership<br />
between ESSO and BHP in discovering oil is one example of that. I<br />
believe the sixty per cent ownership by Australia of Mt. Newman is an<br />
example of that. The participation in the Robe River, which, I<br />
understand, is going to be 25 per cent. There does seem to have been<br />
a realisation by foreign companies that a government, having expressed<br />
a desire for an offer and I stress the word " offer" of Australian<br />
equity ( because we are not going to make the development of some<br />
great industry dependent on Australians taking up what is offered;<br />
Australians might not have enough money and might not wish to do it),<br />
there does seem to be evidence that this is now being offered in greater<br />
amounts than previously.<br />
Q. But you aren't going to lay down say a firm figure of<br />
say 25 per cent of Australian equity participation as a condition of the<br />
development starting?<br />
PM. I don't think you could. I don't think you could lay that<br />
down for a thing like that because there would be so many enormously<br />
differing propositions. There might be one proposition for a billiondollar<br />
development. Another proposition for a $ 200, 000 development.<br />
Well, clearly, trying to lay down there must be 25 per cent Australian<br />
participation or that that must be offered would be so different in each<br />
of those cases that I don't think you could definitely lay it down. But<br />
there is something one could call a code of good corporate behaviour<br />
which one could say that one expected foreign companies to follow.<br />
That originated, I think, in Canada, and is well known to the significant<br />
and reputable companies who want to work with governments. It<br />
includes participation in management by, in our case, Australians,<br />
it includes the offering of equity initially and the indication that further<br />
equity will be offered, and indeed it approaches a partnership which is<br />
really what one wants.<br />
Q. Now, when it comes to starting developments like the<br />
exploitation of mineral resources from scratch, is there a larger<br />
part that Australian institutions especially insurance companies can<br />
be persuaded to play, and this is what the Labor Opposition wants,<br />
isn't it? / 4 </p>
<p>4-<br />
PM. Well, I don't think from listening to the Leader of the<br />
Opposition I would agree that what he said was that they should be<br />
persuaded to play a greater part. I rather understood him to say that<br />
they should be compelled to play a greater part. And I would not by<br />
any means wish to say to an insurance company, which is after all<br />
holding the premiums of people from all over Australia who are<br />
expecting to be paid if they have to make a claim, I would think it quite<br />
wrong to say to them, " We will compel you to invest in this enterprise<br />
whether you wish to or not or whether you think you will get a good<br />
enough return or not on your income".<br />
Q. But what about persuading the insurance companies to<br />
play a more positive role not to be investing in city centre buildings<br />
but in mineral resources?<br />
PM. I wouldn't think that insurance companies would need<br />
to be persuaded to invest their funds in areas where they were going<br />
to get a good return. They are being run by their hardheaded business<br />
directors, and I believe that the opportunities for investment are ones<br />
which they will judge and into which they will channel the funds they<br />
hold.<br />
Q. You said earlier, Prime Minister, that you were<br />
worried about the question of excessive dividends leaving the country.<br />
Have you considered or are you considering limiting the rights of<br />
foreign companies to repatriate dividends?<br />
PM. No.<br />
Q. Would you say that you are an economic nationalist?<br />
PM. I would like somebody to define " economic nationalist"<br />
before I felt I could properly answer that question. But if wanting an<br />
Australian participation of the greatest possible amount is being an~<br />
economic national ist, then I would say I was an economic nationalist.<br />
On the other hand, if wanting the greatest possible amount of overseas<br />
investment, without which we can't develop as quickly as we need to<br />
develop, is not being an economic nationalist, then I am not an economic<br />
nationalist. I want we must have this overseas development. We<br />
must have this development and we must have overseas capital. But<br />
I want Australian opportunity to participate at the beginning, if possible,<br />
of new enterprises, and to continue to participate as the enterprises<br />
grow.<br />
Q. Haven't you modified your views on this since the<br />
controversy first started over the MLG about six months ago? </p>
<p>PM. No, I don't think so. You see, the MLC matter was<br />
this that large numbers of shares ( from memory something over<br />
per cent) were being held in the names of nominees and nobody<br />
knew who was holding them and nobody could find out who was holding<br />
them. But we suspected they were being held by an overseas company.<br />
It appeared that still more shares were being sought. Now the first<br />
thing one wanted to discover was who was in fact seeking to buy control<br />
of the MLC if they were seeking to buy control of it. The second<br />
thing was that this was an insurance company, an Australian insurance<br />
company with enormous assets, with assets which grow very largely<br />
each year, and that is the sort of company which one might very well<br />
wish to keep in Australian hands, and in fact would wish to keep in<br />
Australian hands.<br />
Q. Many people seem to have got the impression that you<br />
started at that time with a wish to be fairly tough on foreign investment<br />
but that you have been back-pedalling ever since?<br />
PM. Well, I don't quite know what you mean by being fairly<br />
tough. Do you mean that it is tough to say we want Australian<br />
participation? To say to companies who are seeking to come here<br />
from abroad, " The Government wants you to do this; the Government<br />
wants you to follow a code of good corporate behaviour; you will be<br />
operating in this country for a very long period of time and you don't<br />
need to be told that it is to your advantage to co-operate with the<br />
Government?" If that is tough, then I was and am being tough. But I<br />
don't believe I ever indicated that I was going to legislate for a<br />
particular percentage, because one can't do that. One flags the course,<br />
one says what one expects and in some instances, such as companies<br />
who are holding shares in the names of nominees, I think we must act<br />
and must see that beneficial ownership is disclosed when it reaches a<br />
certain percentage.<br />
Q. In the last resort, Prime Minister, you are saying that<br />
for a Government to express its wishes that this is going to be an<br />
effective enough way of getting the policy that you want? It looks as if<br />
you are not going to legislate on any of these matters. Now do you<br />
think it is going to be effective?<br />
PM. I didn't say I wasn't going to legislate on any of these<br />
matters. We have discussed the question of the nominee ownership<br />
of shares. We have discussed the question of methods of takeover.<br />
We have discussed the question of whether there could be some ultimate<br />
reserve power for a government to protect some very significant<br />
Australian company. All those matters we have discussed, and I<br />
haven't said that we wouldn't legislate on those. What you may be<br />
asking about was were vie going to legislate to insist that something<br />
couldn't go ahead unless there was an offer to Australians of a<br />
particular percentage of equity. And I have indicated I wasn't going<br />
to legislate on that.<br />
Q. Prime Minister, thank you very much.<br />
