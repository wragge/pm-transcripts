FOR MEDIA SUNDAY, 20 DECEMBER 1981<br />
ELECTORATE TALK<br />
1981 has been a year of achievement and consolidation. The<br />
Government has maintained aid strengthened its-commitment to<br />
the fundamental belief that individual Australians have<br />
the right and must have the freedom to decide for themselves<br />
their own needs and priorities.<br />
This belief was given particular concrete expression t-his year<br />
in the Review of Commonwealth Functions, for from that<br />
review have come decisions aimed at strengthening the role of<br />
individual initiative and private enterprise, as well as achie-ving<br />
a more appropriate balanace of responsibilities between the<br />
Commonwealth and the the states. B3tt in an iniportantsense, -ahe Review<br />
of CoinmonweX th Functions was simply a continuation of the<br />
philosophy and policies the Government has consistently pursued<br />
for six years, which have laid the foundations for a more<br />
prosperous and confident Australia.<br />
In 1980/ 81, the benefits of those policies not only became<br />
more apparent, but were shared by all Australians, and nothing<br />
illustrates this more clearly than the fact that Australian<br />
households received an increase in their real disposable<br />
incomes, after tax of nearly$ 3 billion in 1980/ 81. Economic<br />
success has been achieved across a wide front. While there<br />
are increasing inflationary pressures in the Australian economy,<br />
which are in part a product.. of the economic growth that has been<br />
a* chieved, inflation in the year to September was contained to just<br />
over this is below the level of twelve months ago, and is<br />
still below world levels, although it is becoming more difficult<br />
to maintain our competitive edge. 1981 was also a year in which<br />
the fight against inflation was seen more clearly than ever<br />
before, not as an end in itself, but as a means of achieving<br />
greater investment, more jobs and higher living standards for<br />
all Australians.<br />
The main foundation for our recent outstanding performance<br />
lies in the renewed confidence of business to invest in all<br />
sectors of the Australian economy. For while real ] private<br />
investment in most other industrial countries is flat or<br />
declining, private business investment in Australia rose by<br />
over 21% in real terms in 1980/ 81 the strongcst growth in<br />
three decades. Production and consumer demand have been strong,<br />
and substantial employment growth has been achieved. / 2 </p>

The development of Australia's abundant resources especially<br />
our oil and non-oil energy resources was accelerated during<br />
1981, and Australia now has a role as one of the few significant<br />
energy suppliers to an energy hungry world, a role which will<br />
be of great value to the world economy, and to ourselves.<br />
Our economic success has not come about by chance. It has<br />
required maintenance of the right policies, policies of sound<br />
and responsible economic management. Moreover the Government<br />
has integrated its promotion of the conditions for economic<br />
growth and prosperity with policies of care and concern for the<br />
needs of people. In the area of social welfare, the Government<br />
will spend over $ 11,300 million this financial year approaching<br />
of total budget outlays.<br />
1981 has seen the Government introduce significant initiatives<br />
in increasing benefits for the handicapped, for veterans and<br />
for families, and the provision of assistance for migrants,<br />
aborigines and young people has continued to receive a high<br />
priority. Under the new health insurance arrangements introduced<br />
this year, there is provision for some three mi] lion needy<br />
Australians to have their health costs met by Government, while those<br />
who can better afford to insure themselves against the cost of<br />
medical and hospital bills have been given an incentive to do<br />
so in the form of a tax rebate.<br />
1981 has also seen other significant legislative achievements.<br />
' rcedan of information legislation has been introduced an the human<br />
Pights Cor. ission has been established. New arrangements have<br />
been established for the major domestic airlines, and there<br />
has been a rationalisation of the method of calculation of air<br />
fares. In accordance with the Government's stated aim of<br />
clamping down on tax avoidance, a number of schemes have been<br />
outlawed by the Parliament, and through carefully constructed<br />
new legislation we have sought to prevent new schemes springing<br />
up to replace them. And in the fulfilment of the Government's<br />
election promise, the Conciliation and Arbitration Act has been<br />
amended to allow unionists to demand secret ballots before taking<br />
industrial action.<br />
Of major importance in 1981 has been the Goverrnment's commitment<br />
to making a meaningful contribution to international affairs,<br />
particularly in our own region. The Commnonwealth Heads of<br />
Government Meeting in Melbourne did much to focus world attention<br />
to those problems facing both the developed-and developing nations.<br />
Our willingness to contribute to the Middle East Peace process<br />
signifies our commitment to the need for a just and lasting<br />
peace in that troubled region.<br />
1981 has presented challenges as well as opportunities to this<br />
nation, and I believe that in grasping the opportunities and<br />
attempting to come to terms with the challenges, the groundwork<br />
has been prepared for further desirable achievments in 1982.<br />
I would like to take this opportunity to wish you all a happy<br />
Christmas and a successful and satisfying 1982. </p>
