FOR RELEASE 6 P. M. FRIDAY 1ST APRIL 1966<br />
FOR PRESS: P. M. No. 30/ 1966<br />
CHANGED DATE FOR THE OBSERVANCE OF CO1MONWUlALTH DAY<br />
Statement by the Prime IMinister, Mr. Harold Holt.<br />
It has been decided, in consultation with the Premiers,<br />
that Commonwealth Day will in future be observed in Australia on<br />
the day on which The Queen's Official Birthday is celebrated,<br />
instead of on the present date, May 24.<br />
We think of The Queen as Head of the Commonwealth as<br />
well as Queen of Australia. It therefore seems fittU. ng that we<br />
should combine the two observances, which are so closely linked<br />
in spirit, and have in recent years/ 1been separated by only a few<br />
days. The British Government recently announced its intention<br />
to combine the observance of Commonwealth Day and The Queen's<br />
Official Birthday. Our decision therefore will maintain the<br />
practice of a jcint observance in the two countries of these two~<br />
events in the life of the Commonwealth.<br />
In future, the flying of flags by the Commonwealth on the<br />
Monday of the weekend which has hitherto marked the Official<br />
Birthday of Her Majesty, will now mark also the observance of<br />
Commonwealth Diay.<br />
The Premiers will be announcing details of the arrangements<br />
to be made for the observances in the States.<br />
CANBERRA 1ST APRIL, 1966.<br />
Backgzround Note:<br />
The present date of Commonwealth Day, May 24, is the date<br />
of Queen Victoria's birthday. Empire Day was celebrated on that<br />
date between 1902 and 1958. Since then, the day has been known<br />
as Ccmmonwealth Day.<br />
. The Queen's Official Birthday has been celebrated<br />
throughout Australia in recent years on the Monday following the<br />
second Saturday in June ( Her Majesty's actual birthday is on<br />
April 21). Prior to that, the date of the official observance<br />
varied, although it was normally about the middle of the year. </p>
