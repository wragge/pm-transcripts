    <content><![CDATA[<p>Premier Rees and distinguished guests.</p>
<p>I acknowledge the First Australians on whose lands we meet, and whose cultures we celebrate as the oldest continuing cultures in human history.</p>
<p>It is always good to speak at Australia Day events, because it gives me a chance to talk about our country.</p>
<p>Where we are heading.</p>
<p>What challenges are before us.</p>
<p>And what steps we are taking, as a nation, to meet them.</p>
<p>It is particularly good because Australia Day comes at such a great time of the year.</p>
<p>Over the summer, most of us have had a chance to rest, to spend time with family and friends, to enjoy the bush, the beach or the backyard, and to recharge our batteries ahead of the New Year.</p>
<p>Australia Day is a day in which  -  through our honours system and the Australian of the Year Awards  -  we recognise and thank Australians who inspire us  -  in the local community, in education, health, business, sport, the arts, and in so many fields.</p>
<p>Through their example, we see the best of what we can be as a nation and as a people.</p>
<p>But this year the nation is overshadowed by uncertainty and anxiety over the global financial crisis at our door.</p>
<p>I understand that worry, and I can tell you that 2009 is going to be a tough year.</p>
<p>The current economic turmoil is unlike any we have seen in our lifetime  -  and unlike any since the Great Depression of 1931.</p>
<p>It is not a crisis of Australia's making, but it will hurt Australia, as it is hurting every other country.</p>
<p>Over the next week, starting today, I plan to deliver a series of addresses on the global economic situation, how it will affect Australia and our framework for responding.</p>
<p>I am doing this because I intend to be absolutely straight with Australians about the impact of the crisis, and what we intend to do about it.</p>
<p>The impact will be big.</p>
<p>But so will our response.</p>
<p>In fact, it's been substantial so far, including $36 billion of new measures.</p>
<p>We are determined to chart a course that will see Australia through this crisis.</p>
<p>We are determined to navigate that course and to craft a more resilient Australia as a result.</p>
<p>We will do so with a combination of steely economic management and compassion for those who need support.</p>
<p>And we intend to prevail through the energy, innate optimism and decency of the Australian people.</p>
<p>The magnitude of the global financial crisis almost beggars belief.</p>
<p>By next year, up to 25 million people around the world may have lost their jobs, according to the OECD.</p>
<p>In the United States, the origin and epicentre of the earthquake, nearly three million jobs were lost last year  -  the largest decline since World War Two.</p>
<p>In December alone more than half a million people lost their jobs.</p>
<p>Global share markets have lost half their value since they peaked in October 2007  -  the greatest fall since the Great Depression.</p>
<p>That is $32 trillion  -  the equivalent of the total annual GDP of the G7, the group of seven of the world's wealthiest nations.</p>
<p>The Australian share market has been hit as well: it fell by 43 per cent last year, the largest annual fall since records began in 1982  -  and twice the previous largest calendar year fall.</p>
<p>It is now clear that even though global capital markets helped drive the strongest period of economic growth in three decades, they had become structurally unsound and unsustainable.</p>
<p>A culture of excessive risk taking - a culture of greed - a culture of excess has brought massive economic disruption to global financial markets and the global economy.</p>
<p>These markets were inadequately supervised and, in the period ahead, one of the tasks of the global community will be to devise warning systems to ensure such a disaster never happens again.</p>
<p>The good news is that Australia has weathered the turbulence far better than many similar countries.</p>
<p>Our banks had a very low level of exposure to bad debt generated in the US.</p>
<p>Of the more than 40 major global financial institutions that have gone bankrupt or been bailed out since the crisis began, none are Australian.</p>
<p>However, Australia is not immune from these events, and difficult days lie ahead.</p>
<p>The US, Japan, Germany and the rest of the euro zone - plus, in our region, New Zealand, Singapore and Hong Kong - have all slipped into recession.</p>
<p>Critically, China has been hit much harder than forecasters had predicted.</p>
<p>Its growth has slowed sharply  -  from 12 per cent in 2007 to 8.5 per cent last year.</p>
<p>Its manufacturing sector  -  which is 40 per cent of its GDP  -  has been contracting for five months.</p>
<p>Because China takes 15 per cent of our exports, its slowdown will affect Australia.</p>
<p>This is an unprecedented crisis that demands an unprecedented response.</p>
<p>In October, for the first time in our history, the Government guaranteed deposits of up to $1 million in all banks, building societies and credit unions.</p>
<p>Our Economic Security Strategy injected $10.4 billion into the economy via payments to pensioners, low and middle income families and first home buyers.</p>
<p>We made a $6.2 billion commitment to strengthen Australia's automotive industry, which directly and indirectly supports 200,000 jobs.</p>
<p>And last month we announced a $4.7 billion nation-building plan to invest in ready-to-go infrastructure projects in road, rail, ports and education.</p>
<p>These are investments that will not simply stimulate the economy now  -  they will build Australia for the long term.</p>
<p>The industries we are investing in  -  including education, information technology and renewable energy  -  are industries of the future that will ensure Australia emerges from this downturn with a stronger, more diverse economy.</p>
<p>We are all in this together</p>
<p>This is a difficult time, and in the short term there is no quick fix.</p>
<p>Things will get worse before they get better.</p>
<p>That is where all of us  -  not just government  -  have a role in lessening the effects of the crisis.</p>
<p>We are all in this together: business, unions, governments, the community sector  -  and every nation in the world.</p>
<p>In these times, employers must do their utmost to protect their workers from dismissal, knowing that these workers will serve them well when times turn good again.</p>
<p>Workers, too, must restrain any wage claims.</p>
<p>I know there are employers who have asked their workers to accept shorter working hours rather than lose their jobs.</p>
<p>That encourages me, because at this time Australians need to look out for each other -- as we have done so many times in the past when the going has got tough.</p>
<p>I repeat  -  we are all in this together.</p>
<p>Right now it's jobs that matter most  -  because the global financial crisis has been the destroyer of jobs.</p>
<p>As I travel around the country, I sense a steadiness among our people  -  an awareness that times are hard, but also a willingness to help each other, to stick together.</p>
<p>I have not the slightest doubt that we as a people will rise to the challenge that lies ahead of us.</p>
<p>And we will emerge from this a stronger, more resilient nation than before  -  and a nation which never loses its heart.</p>
