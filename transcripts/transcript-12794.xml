    <content><![CDATA[<p>
The suggestion in today';s Sun-Herald (17 February 2002, p.5) that there is a link between the decision to supply five police runabouts to Indonesia and any discussions with Mr Peter Reith on behalf of Tenix is completely wrong, and I repudiate the implications in the article.<br />
No decisions have been taken as to any contract regarding the manufacture or supply of these vessels.<br />
Moreover, the article incorrectly asserts that the vessels are â€˜patrol boats';.  They are not.  They are small police runabouts.<br />
Proper processes will be followed in the awarding of any contract.</p>
