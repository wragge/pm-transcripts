P. M. No. 17/ 1961<br />
GOVEHNOR-GENERAL DESIGNATE'S PLANS<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister, the Rt. Hon. R. G. Menzies<br />
His Excellency the Governor-General Designate,<br />
Viscount de LtIsle, accompanied by the members of his<br />
family will leave Angland on the liner Orcades on July<br />
He will fly to Canberra from Perth where the Orcades is<br />
due on July 29.<br />
Lord de L'Isle has found that the transfer of<br />
his business responsibilities as well as the arrangements<br />
for the management of his private affairs cannot be<br />
accomplished as quickly as he had wished. Consequently<br />
he has asked for a little more time and the Government<br />
has, of course, willingly concurred.<br />
I shall look forward personally to welcoming<br />
him and his family to Canberra at the end of July.<br />
CANBERRA, 3rd May, 1961. </p>
