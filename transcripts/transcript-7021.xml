    <content><![CDATA[<p><strong>21 OctoberÂ 1986</strong></p>
<p>It was with deep regret that I learnt today of the death ofÂ Mr Justice Lionel Keith Murphy.</p>
<p>Lionel Murphy was a great Australian and one of our finestÂ ever jurists. He made a significant and lastingÂ contribution to the Parliament and the legal system of thisÂ country.</p>
<p>Lionel 1Iurphy served with distinction as a Senator from 1962Â until 1975. From 1967 he was Leader of the opposition inÂ the Senate, and from 1972, Leader of the Government.</p>
<p>As Attorney-General of the Commonwealth-between 1972 andÂ 1975 he pioneeredÂ major reforms of the law in relation toÂ family law, legal aid, consumer protection, and civilÂ liberties.</p>
<p>As a JudgeÂ of the High Court, Lionel Murphy brought to theÂ Court a vision of social justice and a commitment to theÂ principle that all are equal under the law. HisÂ contribution to the High Court is a lasting memorial to theÂ principles he held so strongly, and which guided himÂ throughout his legal, parliamentary and judicial careers.</p>
<p>The last few months have been a particularly difficult timeÂ for both the Judge and his family. Yet he faced this periodÂ with characteristic strength and courage.</p>
<p>Lionel Murphy's commitment to the law and his sense ofÂ public duty were epitomised by the fact that in recent days,Â when his health and-physical striength were rapidly failing,Â he continuedÂ to work to complete outstanding judgements.</p>
<p>I wish to express my personal sympathy, and that of theÂ Government, to Mrs Ingrid Murphy and the Judge's family forÂ the loss they are feeling at this time.</p>
<p>I have personally lost a colleague and friend.</p>
<p>The people of Australia have lost a humanist and a jurist ofÂ rare talent and significance.</p>
<p>A State Funeral Service will be held in Sydney at 2.30 pm onÂ Monday, 27 October, 1986. Further details will be advised.</p>
