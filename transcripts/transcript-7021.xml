    <content><![CDATA[<p><strong>21 October 1986</strong></p>
<p>It was with deep regret that I learnt today of the death of Mr Justice Lionel Keith Murphy.</p>
<p>Lionel Murphy was a great Australian and one of our finest ever jurists. He made a significant and lasting contribution to the Parliament and the legal system of this country.</p>
<p>Lionel 1Iurphy served with distinction as a Senator from 1962 until 1975. From 1967 he was Leader of the opposition in the Senate, and from 1972, Leader of the Government.</p>
<p>As Attorney-General of the Commonwealth-between 1972 and 1975 he pioneered major reforms of the law in relation to family law, legal aid, consumer protection, and civil liberties.</p>
<p>As a Judge of the High Court, Lionel Murphy brought to the Court a vision of social justice and a commitment to the principle that all are equal under the law. His contribution to the High Court is a lasting memorial to the principles he held so strongly, and which guided him throughout his legal, parliamentary and judicial careers.</p>
<p>The last few months have been a particularly difficult time for both the Judge and his family. Yet he faced this period with characteristic strength and courage.</p>
<p>Lionel Murphy's commitment to the law and his sense of public duty were epitomised by the fact that in recent days, when his health and-physical striength were rapidly failing, he continued to work to complete outstanding judgements.</p>
<p>I wish to express my personal sympathy, and that of the Government, to Mrs Ingrid Murphy and the Judge's family for the loss they are feeling at this time.</p>
<p>I have personally lost a colleague and friend.</p>
<p>The people of Australia have lost a humanist and a jurist of rare talent and significance.</p>
<p>A State Funeral Service will be held in Sydney at 2.30 pm on Monday, 27 October, 1986. Further details will be advised.</p>
