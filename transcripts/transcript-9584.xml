PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINSTER, THE HON P. J. KEATING MP<br />
DOORSTOP, PERTH, MONDAY 15 MAY 1995<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
PMV: John Hewson said we were going to have an early election and<br />
Alexander Downer said we were going to have an early election, but<br />
we never did.<br />
J: the Liberals are currently on..<br />
PMV: Well, what passes for the Liberal party today?<br />
J: Is that premature from the Liberal party to think that way?<br />
PMV: Well, the Liberal party is not really, I don't think, a competent political<br />
party any more. It is basically, it is front benches without anyone of<br />
substance or quality and you can see with Dr Nelson, here is<br />
somebody who has been in the Labor party for 17 years, they are so<br />
moribund the Liberal party, they have given one of their safest seats to<br />
an opportunist, to somebody who doesn't believe, it is like a business<br />
club, the Liberal party, you join at the door. You know, those business<br />
lunches and things you join at the door. Well, you join at the door with<br />
the Liberal party. Walk in, they say ' who am I? 7 and I'll say ' I want to<br />
be a Liberal member'. ' OK, come in'.<br />
J: ( inaudible)..<br />
PMV: He is not doing to well, he has lost Mr Rocher, he has lost Mr Filing<br />
and now he has lost Mr Connolly who was his superannuation<br />
spokesperson at a time when the Government introduced the most<br />
comprehensive, long term superannuation change and savings change<br />
ever. I was saying this morning, have a look at their front bench, I<br />
mean look at the Government's front bench Ralph Willis the<br />
Treasurer, Kim Beazley who have run the whole Budget with our ERC<br />
colleagues and people like Gareth Evans and the Attorney General.<br />
Who have they got? They have got Tim Fischer who is barely </p>
<p>politically literate, Mr Costello who is like a crow on a fence, picking<br />
the eyes out of any good news that comes along and Alexander<br />
Downer who is a professional failure and that's their front bench.<br />
J: Prime Minister election timing..<br />
PM: We will be ready when we are due to be ready. At the moment, the job<br />
for us is to get that Budget in and get it through and get it working. We<br />
are already starting to see influences come from it and from the<br />
interest rate reductions of late last week which, I think, should be a<br />
good sign for the Australian public that the markets and the financial<br />
system has basically approved of the Budget. It has taken enormous<br />
pressure off interest rates. I mean, last year we sold $ 21,000 million<br />
worth of Commonwealth bonds. This year, because of the Budget, we<br />
will sell only $ 6,000 million of Commonwealth bonds. In other words,<br />
we have taken $ 15,000 million of pressure off interest rates so<br />
therefore there is less paper around. If there is less paper around the<br />
price of it goes up and if the price rises, the yield or the interest rate<br />
comes down and that is why long bonds or 10 year bonds fell last<br />
week by one per cent and it is essentially why the housing rates<br />
followed at the end of the week.<br />
J: So, Prime Minister are you tempted to capitalise on the political..<br />
PM: No, I think that the public will see John Howard's cynical, lousy little<br />
line about five minutes of sunshine for the opportunism that it is. We<br />
have had three years of growth to date and the Treasury is forecasting<br />
another three years in the Budget, so if you take the period from 1983<br />
to 1998, we will have had 15 years of growth with 18 months where we<br />
were not growing.<br />
J: So it doesn't really matter when..<br />
PM: No, I think the public will pay on results. I mean, how many<br />
governments around the world could stand up, make an enormous<br />
change to the Budget, take it by 2.9 per cent of GOP or a change of<br />
over $ 12 billion back into surplus, at the same time introduce the most<br />
comprehensive savings plan where every Australian working person<br />
will have 15 per cent put away for themselves, as a contribution to<br />
superannuation in retirement giving them a retirement income roughly<br />
the same as their income at work. At the same time building a huge<br />
pool. That sort of change you get from governments that have got all<br />
the vim and vigour in the world and, I think, the public will think that.<br />
J: So, you are taking full credit for the fall in interest rates?<br />
PM: Well, I would take, let's say last week the interest rate went up on<br />
Friday. You would be reporting ' Budget rejected: Government takes a<br />
hit'. Well, ipso facto, if they fall, the Government has been received<br />
well. </p>
<p>3<br />
J: Do you have any plans for any more major spending statements<br />
between now and the next election?<br />
PM: No, the Budget is our major opportunity to resort the spending<br />
priorities of the Commonwealth and we have done that, but the last<br />
non-budgetary statement, large one, was working nation and its<br />
success has been to get the long term unemployed back to work. You<br />
see, the Government's principal commitment at the last election was<br />
around employment. The thing I said on the night of the election was<br />
that we would not leave the unemployed behind, that we would put an<br />
arm out and bring them up. We promised there, we targeted 500,000<br />
jobs in three years. We are already at 650,000 in two and a quarter<br />
years. We reached our 500,000 target in two thirds of the time and<br />
because we didn't want to see the long term unemployed become an<br />
underclass we put Working Nation in there which has now seen<br />
100,000 long term unemployed people back to work. So, that sort of<br />
commitment to growth and to employment is the sort of thing that will<br />
keep Australia a fairer and more equitable and more just society and a<br />
better place to live.<br />
J: Prime Minister, will the Federal Labor Party be challenging the..<br />
legality of Richard Court's Royal Commission into the Easton affair to<br />
try to keep Carmen Lawrence from appearing?<br />
PM: Look, it is all this stuff about, can I just say, look, there is no question<br />
about illegality here or maladministration, it is not anything like that, it<br />
is just a political inquiry. It is just the same, I said on radio, and I'll say<br />
it again today here, it is just the same as us deciding that we will have<br />
an inquiry with a judge into the Asia diary scandal of the last<br />
government, so we will get Malcolm Fraser along and we'll get Doug<br />
Anthony along and we will get Peter Nixon along and we'll get Mr<br />
Sinclair along and we will say ' now, what happened in that Cabinet<br />
meeting, who said what to whom'. It is a political nonsense.<br />
J: ( inaudible)..<br />
PM: But to happen or doesn't happen it doesn't matter. The inquiry's<br />
findings won't matter.<br />
J: Will your Health Minister..<br />
PM: That is a matter of seeing, there are questions of law here about what<br />
are the rights and prerogatives of members of Parliament and that is a<br />
matter we will be taking legal advice on.<br />
