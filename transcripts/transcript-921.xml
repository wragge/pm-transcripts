OPENING OF SIR LESLIE MORSHEADWAR VETERAN<br />
HOE. CN3~-A, A C To<br />
26TH APRIL. 1964<br />
Speech by te Prim,; stn~ cer, ',_ tfnS. Robert Me-7APe<br />
Mr. President, Lady Morshead and Ladies and Gentlemen<br />
I rather think. that the ' resident made a slight<br />
understatement when he said that without the women this<br />
organisation culd not exist, because the simple truth, o0<br />
course is that without women, none of us would be here.<br />
( laughter) This is a truth of universal application,<br />
Now, I regard this as a siLngular honour to be allowed<br />
to declare open this building and to declare it open in the<br />
name of one of the great Australians olo our time Leslie<br />
Morshead. I knew him for a great number of years, He was,<br />
a few years before myself, born i~ n Ballarat and as all Ballarat<br />
people will admit, that is no bad 4thing, ( Laughter) He went<br />
to school in Ballarat and then became for a time a schoolmaster.<br />
I always used to say to him: " Where did you get this gleam in<br />
the eye? Where did you acquire this habit of command?" and<br />
he admitted to me that he had been a schoolmaster for a few<br />
years. It must have been terrific.<br />
Then, OA. course, as you have heard, he had a remarkable<br />
record in the First World War and between the two wars, a very<br />
remarkable record in business administration. All the time he<br />
kept up his cuntact with the citizen forces whatever they might<br />
be called from time to time, and in the Second World War, he<br />
became one of the immortal figures of that war, I just want<br />
to say something about him, if I may, in one or two of these<br />
capacities. First of all, he was a great citizen soldier, This is<br />
something almost peculiar to Australia no regular army until<br />
quite recently, men accustomed to responsibility and command in<br />
their business affairs devoting some of their time sometimes<br />
a great deal of their time, to the art of war., It is sometimes<br />
forgotten that whereas many of the groat men in military history<br />
in other countries or most of them, sometimes all of them, were<br />
highly trained professional soldiers of immense distinction<br />
in Australia so mnany of the people we think of from Monash Z<br />
Morshead were great citizen soldiers some might have satd<br />
amateur soldiers but enriched by the whole of their civil<br />
experience and greatly gifted in the command of men.<br />
Early in 1941, 1 was in the Middle East and I went out<br />
to Bardier and Tobruk and Benghazi, and at this time, these<br />
places had just fallen by attack upon the Italians, I very well<br />
remember with some trepidation that the day that I was at<br />
Benghazi there was a little counter-attack by the Italians; it<br />
was fairly near to the event. Leslie Morshead had taken his<br />
brigade to England and had brought it back to the Middle East<br />
and it was the nucleus of what became the Ninth Division. Now<br />
that was an extraordinary piece of country. It must have been<br />
a problem for any rmilitary conmander, because although there<br />
was a defined coastline, an indented coastline, particularly at<br />
Tobruk, the country itself looked to the superficial eye to be<br />
a mere desert. You would wonder how anybody could find cover in<br />
it until you discovered that there were little depressions and<br />
waddies, dongas in the territory; but I would have thought<br />
terribly hard places to defend. Well, at the time I was there / 2 </p>
<p>2<br />
which was sometime in January of' 1941, there was no problem of<br />
defence because the wii~ o] e-mov(-mentu was westward to Benghazi and<br />
down towards the bottoma uf the gu-tll anid it was only then that it<br />
was discovered that the Germans under Rcmel had landed, coming<br />
across by the short cut from Pantelaria and that they were massing<br />
themselves for an attack with a Panzer Division hitherto unknown<br />
in the fighting that had gone on. Well, anybody looking at<br />
Tobruk from the ground, looking at Tobruk from the air, would<br />
-have said, well this would be a tremendously difficult place to<br />
defend tremendously difficult, against armourbut there were two<br />
great tings. One was that there was a tremendous spirit in the<br />
men who ultimately withstood the siege of Tobruk when Rommel swept<br />
eastward and the other was that -they Ihad as their commanding<br />
officer one of the very great soldiers of the war, Leslie Morshead,<br />
He could look you in the eye and appear to be fierce<br />
but he was fundamentally a modest man. Ho had the most enormous<br />
qualities, building up the morale of people who were with him,<br />
And so, in the long run, we all know what happened. Rommel came<br />
along, Benghazi fell, Tobruk first of all fell and then didn't and<br />
then was isolated on the flank and so the Fourth rolled eastward<br />
till the day came when the defence of Tobruk had at long last to<br />
be altered, But what from April of 1941 to October of 1941,<br />
Tobruk held out as an isolated post on the side of the wiiole<br />
German advance to the East in country to a lay eye, as I have<br />
said, would appear to present every conceivable problem of defence,<br />
in which defence had to be active and in which defence had to<br />
harry the other man and not get bogged down within a narrow<br />
perimeter, and for those months it held and I will always believe<br />
that one of the dominating reasons I know there were great men<br />
there, marvellous people, we honour them every year in Australia,<br />
but you know someplace in the centre there has to be a great man'<br />
and this was a great man, Leslie Morshead. He can never be done<br />
sufficient honour in his memory for what he did at that time in<br />
that place. It may interest some of you to know that in March,<br />
April and into May of that year I was in London sitting in the<br />
War Cabinet with the great Winston Churchill anca staying with him<br />
each weekend down at Chequers. Hardly three days would ever go<br />
by without him saying something about the defence of Tobruk, This<br />
captured his imagination. You know, with that rich vocabulary<br />
of his, he would look at me and say " This is not a matter merely<br />
of defending something. This is a sally-fort from which to attack<br />
the foe". I had the great honour once of sending Leslie Morshead<br />
a message about this which I know he kept because he referred to<br />
it years and years after the war.<br />
And then, of course, don't let us forget that that<br />
was an. episode of defence against siege, but it wasn't so long<br />
thereafter when at Alamein, Morshead commanded the Ninth Division<br />
and that was the crucial turning battle of the war, Let me<br />
emphasise that fact. There were people, when I was in Egypt early<br />
in 1941, who thought that if the enemy once got near the delta<br />
there was no defence possible. Alamein was designed to jreven<br />
them from getting into the delta and Alamein, this crucial battle,<br />
meant that the Rommel forces rolled back, that the whole position<br />
in North Africa became clear, that an attack on Italy became<br />
feasible, that a strike into the heart of the enemy from the<br />
Mediterranean became possible. I really believe that if you had<br />
to determine what were the crucial battles of the war, Alamein<br />
would be at least one of them and I would think possibly the<br />
crucial battle. e. e / 3 </p>
<p>Somubody '. ro'Ce a book Which read as a bcy<br />
called " Seven Decisive BcaGles of History" or something of<br />
the kindo I've forgottena This, I believe, was a decisive<br />
battle in the war and therefore we must not think of these<br />
matters without thinking back to the man who played so great<br />
a part in them Leslie Morshead, I have told you a lot of<br />
things, all of which you know better than I do. I thought<br />
I would rather like to tell them in the presence of his widow<br />
because it is important that she should know that she wears<br />
a name that is not a great name just because somebody said it<br />
is but a great name because he made it one, and I think it is<br />
a marvellous thing that in this city his name should be<br />
commemorated in this fashion. I hope that all over Australia<br />
it will never be forgotten,<br />
It is a very particular honesty for one who<br />
was his admirer and, I am happy to say, his friend, to be able<br />
to stand here and declare this building open, </p>
