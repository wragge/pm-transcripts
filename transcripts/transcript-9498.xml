TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
INTERVIEW WITH PAUL LYNEHAM, 7.30 REPORT, CANBERRA<br />
2 MARCH 1995<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
PL: Prime Minister, welcome to the program,<br />
PM: Thank you, Paul.<br />
PL: John Howard says that you didn't stare him down on the Land Fund Bill<br />
indeed, he would welcome a double dissolution tomorrow.<br />
PM: I put the weights right on him. He had a chance.... . we have been<br />
saying " when will the real John Howard stand It has taken only<br />
four weeks to show he is the same person he was in the 80s. He had<br />
the opportunity to say " I'm going to get rid of this Downer nonsense<br />
about the Aboriginal Land Fund, I'll clean it out, I'll support the<br />
Government's amendments the Government's Bill and we will have<br />
a principled Land Fund for Aboriginal people". Instead of that, he<br />
adopted all the Downer nonsense all the Downer amendments<br />
brought it to the House, and I said no we will have a principled Bill,<br />
and if we don't, we will have the option of presenting it after a double<br />
dissolution". And he went immediately to water.<br />
PL: You could call his bluff pretty easily Yarralumla is just down the road.<br />
PM.-I called his bluff, and as a result, this is going to be a great day for<br />
Aboriginal people. They will now have the twin parts: that is, the two<br />
bits the Native Title Legislation for those who still have a traditional<br />
association with the land, and for those dispossessed of the land, they<br />
will have the opportunity to buy land through a cogent, coherent<br />
Aboriginal Land Fund. </p>
<p>TEL: 2. Mar. 95 19: 01 No. 019 P .02/ 03<br />
2<br />
PL: And he says if and when he becomes the Prime Minister, he will<br />
change it, and he will have the mandate to do so,<br />
P M' In other words, ( he will say) I1 won't give black people land I will do<br />
everything I can in the Senate to stop them, and even though this<br />
Prime Minister has bailed me up for the moment, if I get back into<br />
office, I will undo all of these things, and deny them this opportunity'.<br />
You see, Howard never learns he never wipes the slate clean, he is<br />
the same person as he has always been. This is the point he is out<br />
of his age.<br />
PL: But if he goes to an election saying clearly to voters that he wants to<br />
make this change, and if he were to win, then he will have such a<br />
mandate, won't he?<br />
PM: To what? Strip the most dispossessed of Australians of the land the<br />
Commonwealth Government Labor Government has given them? I<br />
mean, what an ambition.<br />
PL: Well he says that one of the changes he wants is to make sure that the<br />
most dispossessed get the land.<br />
PM: And he knows, and I know, where that sort of putrid cynicism... as if we<br />
could have courts saying " are you more dispossessed than another<br />
person?", so land is given away an Aboriginal person then<br />
challenges that other Aboriginal person's right in the courts, and we<br />
have a debate in the courts about whether one is more dispossessed<br />
than the other. It's appalling.<br />
PL: He says such judgements are made all the time in public life.<br />
PM. They are not. He had a chance to cut a new cloth John Howard that<br />
was to come clean and say ' I want a better relationship with Aboriginal<br />
Australia, we can't have an inclusive society without the first<br />
Australians being part of it'. But no, he has picked up the old rightwing<br />
Tory reactionary agenda which Mr Downer was powerless to stop<br />
and he is powerless to stop and has supported it. It came to the<br />
House and the Government said ' no, no we won't have it'.<br />
PL: What of the Coalition's desire to enable individuals to have an<br />
entitlement to land and if they so wish be able to sell it. He says by not<br />
doing so, the Government is being patronising and ignoring the needs<br />
of urban Aborigines,<br />
PMV: That is another slick argument from a slick person without principle.<br />
An Aboriginal person has the same right that you and I have to buy a<br />
piece of land this very day. But, what this Bill is about is the<br />
Commonwealth Government, the Parliament, conferring on an<br />
Aboriginal person and communities land which is paid for by the public </p>
<p>ends 9~ ic: 01 No. 019 P.<br />
3<br />
for the express purpose of giving them that right to land. You can't talk<br />
about Aboriginal health or Aboriginal welfare without talking about<br />
land, because when Aboriginal people are living a traditional lifestyle<br />
on their land their morale improves, their health improves, their whole<br />
style of life improves and to be saying that we are denying an<br />
individual a rightness, they want it in this Bill. One of their other<br />
amendments was to say to an Aboriginal individual person you can sell<br />
the land to someone else and keep the money. Well, the Parliament is<br />
conferring on Aboriginal communities these funds. The very point of it<br />
is for community rand.<br />
PL: On another matter Prime Minister, Mr Howard says push polling is un-<br />
Australian and should not be used here, do you accept his statement?<br />
PM: I have been saying that and he was condoning or was seen to<br />
condone it by not pulling Andrew Robb up. 1 mean, this is the most<br />
sinister development I have seen in 20 odd years in public life.<br />
PL: But, he has now publicly rejected it.<br />
PM: Well, I saw today someone asked him ' Does Mr Robb still have your<br />
confidence?' ' Yes'. ' Are you opposed to push polling?' ' Well, I'm<br />
opposed to anything that I think the Australian people regard as<br />
undesirable.' In other words, I won't get out there in front, I'll hang<br />
around behind and see what the reaction is to this. This is the worst<br />
elements of right-wing America. Insidiously saying to 400 people in a<br />
supposed poll, trafficking defamations which are completely untrue to<br />
try to spoil the candidate's reputation and chances. I mean, he should<br />
have just completely wiped his hands of it the moment it arose, but the<br />
cynicism, again, the real John Howard did stand up. He hasn't<br />
changed that Mr 18% at the end of 1989 and we saw him today. He<br />
had his worst day in Parliament today, his worst week in Parliament<br />
since he has become Leader and this honeymoon is ending very<br />
rapidly.<br />
PL:-Prime Minister, thank you for your time.<br />
PM.-Thank you, Paul. </p>
