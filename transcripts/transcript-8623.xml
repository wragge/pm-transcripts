STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, TIlE HON P. J. KEATING MP<br />
VISIT BY PRIME MINISTER OF FiJl<br />
The Prime Ministcr of Fiji, the Hon. Sitiveni Rabuka, will visit Australia on 29 August 4<br />
September as a guest of the Government. Prime Minister Rabuka will be accompanied by<br />
Mrs Rabuka, Foreign Minister Bole and officials.<br />
Fiji and Australia have longstanding ties. Fiji is one of our important partners in the South<br />
Pacific and serves as an economic and transportation centre for the region.<br />
I met and held discussions with Prime Minister Rabuka at the recent South Pacific Forum<br />
in Honiara. During the meeting we agreed to resume defence relations between Australia<br />
and Fiji. That move completes normalisation of bilateral relations following Fiji's return<br />
to representative government after elections in May this year.<br />
Prime Minister Rabuka will visit Brisbane, Toowoomba, Sydney and Canberra. He will<br />
have discussions with me and other ministers on bilateral, regional and international issues<br />
of shared concern.<br />
