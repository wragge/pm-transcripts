*~ AU ; r,'. AIA<br />
U I,<br />
FOR MEDIA THURSDAY, 23 AUGUST 1979<br />
STATE'iE'NT TO PARLIA14ENT ON LUSAKA CHOGM<br />
I seek leave to report to this House on the Commonwealth<br />
Heads of Government Meeting held in Lusaka from 1 August<br />
to 7 August.<br />
There can be no legitimate doubt in anyone's mind that this<br />
was a critical conference in the history of the Commonwealth.<br />
The way things turned out should not cause us to forget that.<br />
Befo" re the event responsible and reasonable people wer~ e<br />
expressing serious concern as to whether the Commonwealth<br />
Would survive the conference. There was talk of a break-up.<br />
This was not altogether idle talk. Had the conference gone<br />
badly, tne institution would have been seriously maimed and<br />
culd have !; een destroyed. As it happened the conference<br />
did not co bad l, it went extremely well, and far from<br />
breaking up, the Comrmonwealth has emerged a stronger, more<br />
vital and -ore cohesive body.<br />
'-. o-one who has followed events in Lusaka and certainly<br />
nio-one who was present there can doubt that the Commonwealth<br />
is an institution which has relevance, and a distinctive<br />
function to perform, in the contemporary world.<br />
It has sometimes been asserted and even oftener been implied<br />
that this is a romantic and exaggerated view, that the<br />
Commonwealth is merely the ghost of a vanished empire, a<br />
talking-shop, a dealer in my,, ths and illusions. I believe<br />
it is now clear that it is those who hold this view who are<br />
the real romantics pessimistic romantics who refuse to<br />
come to terms with a changing world and the changing forms<br />
of influence and power.<br />
The old Commonwealth could never have achieved what was achieved<br />
at Lusaka. For at this conference, the Commonwealth took on<br />
one of the most serious and sensitive issues in international<br />
affairs today, an issue which has resisted prolonged efforts<br />
made by major powers, acting alone, to find a solution.<br />
In a matter of days, real and substantial progress was made.<br />
It seems perverse, therefore, to persist in the defeatist and<br />
negatiive view that this institution does not have the potential<br />
for a continuing valuable and constructive role in world affairs.<br />
/ 2 </p>
<p>-2-<br />
The issue I refer to is, of course, the future of Zimbabwe.<br />
As anticipated, this issue was inevitably the central<br />
preoccupation of the conference. It was approached with a<br />
minimum of polemics, and with a determination to find a<br />
fair settlement acceptable to all parties.<br />
In my response to President Kaunda's opening speech on the<br />
first day I appealed, as I have done on previous occasions,<br />
for a spirt of principled moderation and compromise which<br />
would make it possible to bridge different positions.<br />
In the event that soirit turned out to be the distinguishing mark<br />
of the conference. It was the spirit of Lusaka.<br />
That it was so was due, in particular, to the attitude<br />
of three of the participants: our host President Kaunda;<br />
President Nyerere of Tanzania; and the British Prime Minister,<br />
Mrs. Thatcher.<br />
I would like to take this opportunity to express my personal<br />
admiration for the courage and vision of these three leaders.<br />
In a situation where there were pressures on each to be<br />
intransigent, to ask others to yield while remaining inflexible<br />
themselves, all three rejected that path and chose the one<br />
leading to genuine accommodation. It is greatly to their<br />
credit and represented statesmanship of a high order.<br />
The British Prime Minister, for her part, reaffirmed the<br />
unqualified coimmitment of her Government to the goal of genuine<br />
black majority rule in Rhodesia. Much more importantly,<br />
in her speech of 3 August, she recognised the validity of<br />
the criti-sms made of the present constitution, of the<br />
bloc:-ng poowers enjoyed by the white minority, and of the<br />
power vested in the various Service Commissions, which<br />
together make it impossible for the Government of Bishop Muzorewa<br />
to have adequate control over the country's affairs.<br />
So long as these criticisms could be made of the Constitution<br />
one could not assert that genuine black majority rule exists<br />
in Rhodesia. Such powers, which have not been included in<br />
any constitution resulting from a legal transference of power<br />
by Britain, deny Government powers which are fundamental to<br />
a democracy or indeed to any responsible Government.<br />
A Government which cannot control appointments in key areas,<br />
or the activities of its armed forces, is not master of<br />
its own house.<br />
Mrs. Thatcher also accepted the responsibility of the British<br />
Government to bring the country to legal independence on<br />
a basis which the Commonwealth and the international community<br />
as a whole will find acceptable. She undertook to present<br />
proposals as quickly as possible to all the parties.<br />
The leaders of the front line states showed an equally<br />
admirable willingness to approach the issue constructively.<br />
In his speech on the Zimbabwe debate, President Nyerere<br />
recognised that an advance had been made in recent months. / 3 </p>
<p>3<br />
While rejecting the validity of existing constitutional<br />
arrangements which allow a white minority to control the<br />
levers of power, he accepted that a democratic constitution<br />
was not incompatible with special provisions for the white<br />
minority in the form of reserved seats " even out of<br />
proportion to the numbers involved". He recognised that<br />
a cease-fire was a precondition for free and fair elections.<br />
Beyond this, President Kaunda and President Nyerere showed<br />
a restraint and patience, and a confidence in the<br />
British Government which were an essential element in creating<br />
the trust necessary for agreement and progress. They were not<br />
in the business of confrontation and point-scoring.<br />
Let me say something about the part Australia played in the<br />
negotiaticn of the Zimbabwe issue. In the period leading up<br />
to the conference and during it, we had extensive contacts<br />
both directly and by letter with the principal parties.<br />
Shortly before the conference I had talks with Mrs. Thatcher<br />
here in Canberra, and immediately before going to Lusaka I<br />
visited Nigeria a key African state to talk with<br />
General Obasanjo, the leader of the Federal military government.<br />
The Foreign Minister had separate talks with the British<br />
and with representatives of the Muzorewa Government and<br />
subseauently with leaders of the Tanzanian and Kenyan<br />
Governments. During the conference of course, we had extensive discussions<br />
with all the parties present and the Patriotic Front.<br />
In all these talks we expressed the view that, whatever else,<br />
the April elections had broken a log-jam and created conditions<br />
for movement. We maintained that further constitutional<br />
changes in the direction of greater Africanisation were<br />
essential.<br />
We emphasised that a precondition for a successful<br />
settlement was that it should be acceptable to a significant<br />
number of African states. We stressed the need to bring<br />
the war to an end.<br />
The invitation to give the first response to President Kaunda's<br />
opening address gave me the opportunity to put Australia's<br />
views to the conference very early. I stressed the need to<br />
bear in mind the positive elements of agreement which existed<br />
among those present, the fact that we essentially agreed on<br />
ends and differed only on means.<br />
I stressed also that recent events had created an opportunity<br />
for advance by introducing a new element of flexibility and<br />
movement. And, as I have said, I made as strong a plea as<br />
I could for moderation and compromise.<br />
During the weekend of 4-5 August, and following the opening<br />
of the debate on the Rhodesia issue on Friday, 3 August,<br />
a small consulting group of six Heads of Government was set<br />
up to try to reach an agreement. / 4 </p>
<p>4<br />
Australia was a member of that group. The group reached<br />
agreement and drew up a communique on Southern Africa, which<br />
was subsequently accepted by other Heads of Government.<br />
The communique made nine points: The Heads of Government<br />
confirmed that they were wholly committed to genuine<br />
black majority rule for the people of Zimbabwe;<br />
recognised, in this context, that the internal<br />
settlement constitution is defective in certain important<br />
aspects; fully accepted that it is the Constitutional responsibility<br />
of the British Government to grant legal independence to<br />
Zimbabwe on the basis of majority rule;<br />
recognised that the search for a lasting settlement must<br />
involve all parties to the conflict;<br />
were deeply conscious of the urgent need to achieve such<br />
a settlement and bring peace to the people of Zimbabwe<br />
and their neighbours;<br />
accepted that independence on the basis of majority<br />
rule requires the adoption of a democratic constitution<br />
including appropriate safeguards for minorities;<br />
acknowledged that the government formed under such<br />
an indeoendence constitution must be chosen through<br />
free n fair elections, properly supervised under<br />
British Government authority, and with Commonwealth<br />
observers; welcomed the British Government's indication that an<br />
appropriate procedure for advancing towards these<br />
objectives would be for them to call a Constitutional<br />
conference to which all parties would be invited; and<br />
consequently, accepted that it must be a major objective<br />
to bring about a cessation of hostilities, and an end<br />
to sanctions as part of the process of implementation<br />
of a lasting settlement.<br />
These nine points do not amount to a settlement of the Zimbabwe<br />
situation. Neither the Muzorewa government nor the Patriotic<br />
Front ZANU and ZAPU were parties to the discussion, and a<br />
settlement will require their agreement.<br />
Much hard work and delicate negotiating remains to be done.<br />
But the significance of what has been achieved is enormous.<br />
To appreciate this it is necessary to contemplate what the<br />
position would na. qbe, had there been a failure to reach<br />
agreement. Both Southern Africa and the Commonwealth would be<br />
facing bleak prospects. The momentum for change would have<br />
been lost.<br />
As it is, a very formidable and diverse body of opinion has<br />
been mobilised and unified, in favour of a particular process<br />
of settlement. Given its nature, that body of opinion will<br />
require a serious response both from Salisbury and from the<br />
Patriotic Front. </p>
<p>5<br />
Before the conference, the opinion prevailed in each of these<br />
centres that time was on their side, that they could afford<br />
to wait and to resist change. It will be difficult for them<br />
to maintain that view now. It is very important that, for the<br />
first time in many years the initiative has been seized by the<br />
forces of moderation and peaceful settlement, and that has been<br />
done within the framework of the Commonwealth, that often<br />
derided institution which continues to confound its critics<br />
by proving its relevance.<br />
The settlement nrocess that is envisaged can bring peace and<br />
allow Zimbabwe to take its place in the community of nations.<br />
It allows for genuine majority rule, for a return to legality,<br />
for prctection of the white minority, and for the ending of<br />
war and sanctions. If achieved, it will be acceptable to<br />
leading African states, it will remove a festering sore which<br />
has threatened to infect Southern Africa with both the poison<br />
of racial war and great power conflict.<br />
There is no guarantee that these things will happen, that the<br />
process will succeed. But I believe that there are reasonable<br />
prospects for success. I believe this for two reasons, first<br />
because the terms of settlement it envisages are essentially<br />
right in the-selves in that they are based on the principles<br />
that the people of Zimbabwe all the people have the right<br />
to choose who shall govern them, and that the government so<br />
elected should have real control over the affairs of the country.<br />
Seco-ndl, I believe the chances of success are good because<br />
such a settlement is in the rational self interest of the parties<br />
concerned. It is the only way in which the suffering and<br />
bloodshed endured by the people of Zimbabwe can be ended.<br />
If the settlement does rot succeed, the prospect is for an<br />
intensification of the war, a greater resort to Communist<br />
arms, and greater turmoul for the whole of Southern Africa.<br />
As far as the white community of that country is concerned,<br />
it can hope for a stable and peaceful existence, only as part<br />
of a cenuine multi-racial society. Continuing warfare will<br />
lead to its disintegration anr exodus. The Patriotic Front<br />
can only hope to participate in the governing of the country<br />
on the basis of such a settlement.<br />
The Front-line states have an interest in ending the state of<br />
war which forces them to accept sacrifices and threatens to<br />
involve them directly in other people's conflicts. Britain<br />
has an interest in ending a situation which has perhaps caused<br />
it more international embarrassment than any other over the<br />
last decade.<br />
The international community at large can only benefit fiom<br />
removing a potential source of conflagration and great power<br />
rivalry. Australia, as a member of the international<br />
community shares this concern for peace and stability in<br />
Southern Africa, and, as a member of the Commonwealth, we<br />
have a concern with preserving its integrity, and with the<br />
Commonwealth proving itself as a constructive and relevant<br />
institution. / 6 </p>
<p>-6<br />
Th1. e Lusaka conference has set a process in train. What other<br />
international body could have achieved this? It is our sincere<br />
hope that the process is continued to a successful conclusion.<br />
If the Rhodesia issue occupied the centre of the stage at the<br />
conference, it certainly did not monopolise attention. A good<br />
deal else was done besides, and for the information of<br />
Honourable Members, I table the final communique.<br />
one of tne major initiatives was in the economic field, where<br />
Australia proposed a Commonwealth group of experts to make a<br />
conmcrehensive study of factors restraining growth. We put<br />
the proposal forward in the context of the historic changes<br />
that have moulded the world's economy over the past few decades.<br />
In the quarter century after the Second World War the world<br />
experienced a period of unprecedonted economic growth. The<br />
Great Depression, followed by the war, had created a huge<br />
pent-up demand for consumer goods. That, together with the<br />
Marshall Plan, the widespread adoption of Keynesian policies<br />
and the rapid introduction of new technology, led to a<br />
sustained upsurge in economic growth and real income in the<br />
developing countries as well as in the industrialised world.<br />
In tnose years, the material conditions of the mass of people<br />
in Western societies was transformed. But the very success<br />
of that process meant that by the mid-1960' s conditions were<br />
chnargi. ng and by the early 1970' s the consumer boom was clearly<br />
ru" m'ic: down.<br />
At the same time, there emerged increasing impediments to<br />
enterprise and investment. High inflation was becoming built<br />
into the major economies; further moves to protection were<br />
buil1di ng greater restraints to trade. Governments conditioned<br />
to believing that Keynesian policies were the answer to all<br />
problems stubbornly continued to pursue those policies, despite<br />
the onset of inflation, encouraged by electorates increasingly<br />
accustomed to believing that governments could provide for all<br />
needs. The extraordinary growth of the period came to be taken for<br />
granted. Increasingly, unrealistic demands were made on worl~ d<br />
economies, particularly by trade union movements which came to<br />
exercise unprecedented power, and it became fashionable to<br />
decry growth and to place impediments in its path.<br />
An increasingly formidable system of statutory road blocks<br />
were placed in the way of development and investment. Very<br />
demanding environmental laws, harsh trade practices legislation,<br />
prices justification regulations, and the development and<br />
investment policies pursued by many countries have acted as<br />
impediments to economic growth. Many investment opportunities<br />
which had been highly attractive twenty years ago now became<br />
uneconomic. The result of all this is that in recent years the growth in<br />
world trade has fallen to half of what it was in previous<br />
decades, from eight percent to four percent. A further constraint<br />
to growth is slow rates of development in a number of developing<br />
countries. / 7 </p>
<p>7<br />
Australia's experience with the newly industrialising countries<br />
has shown us that as soon as they take-off economically, trade<br />
both ways grows very rapidly. During the 1970' s, however,<br />
instead of accepting the challenge and opportunity of greater trade<br />
with newly industrialising countries, many major developed nations<br />
became fearful and turned to greater protectionism.<br />
We see examples of this in the $ 25 billion spent by Western<br />
industrial countries on wage and export subsidies, the use of<br />
voluntary restraint agreements and the contemplation of<br />
selective safeguards. This is not only selfish and wrong,<br />
but foolish and short sighted economics, for the growth of<br />
markets in developing countries could well be one of the keys<br />
to reducing the rate of unemployment being experienced by<br />
Western developed nations in the last quarter of the twentieth<br />
century. It is clear that the conditions which generated and fuelled the<br />
great surge of growth in the last quarter century have now largely<br />
disappeared, and recent assessments by international organisations<br />
for the medium term outlook are for a continuation of slow growth<br />
or even a further deterioration in growth prospects.<br />
At Lusaka, Heads of Government recognised that a continuation of<br />
slow growth in the global economy would further damage the<br />
prospects of increasing living standards in both developed and<br />
developing countries, and could have adverse effects in their<br />
political and social structures.<br />
They agreed that there would be considerable advantage in a<br />
study by independent Commonwealth experts that focusses on the<br />
constraints to economic growth and structural change in developed<br />
and developing nations, and identifies specific measures<br />
necessary to reduce these constraints.<br />
The group is to report in time to assist Commonwealth governments<br />
in their preparation for the special session of the U. N. General<br />
Assembly in 1980, and the Government has indicated to the<br />
Coirc.-a 1. ealth S; cretary-Gciera! that a prominent Australian acKade. ic:<br />
economist is expected to be available to serve on the group.<br />
I believe that Australia has already set an example in some areas<br />
of the way that constraints on growth can be broken down. We have<br />
reduced inflation, and we will maintain our strong anti-inflationary<br />
policy. We have increased company profitability, improved<br />
Australia's competitive position, and strengthened the dollar.<br />
Under our foreign investment policy administered by the Foreign<br />
Investment Review Board, last year's private foreign investment<br />
was the highest since 1971-72, and in the June quarter, $ 1.4 billion<br />
prospective expenditure was approved.<br />
All these help to reduce the impediments to our national development,<br />
but there are many other barriers to growth within the global<br />
economy. I hope that the report will address itself to these<br />
constraints and recommend practical policies that can be pursued<br />
in order to promote growth of the world economy. / 8 </p>
<p>8<br />
The discussion of the Australian economic initiative aqain<br />
made it clear Heads of Government realised that in confronting<br />
the problems we face, we need a fusion of realism, imacination<br />
and boldness, and a willingness to listen and understand one<br />
another.<br />
The eyes of the world were on the Commonwealth at Lusaka.<br />
It faced a harsh test. It passed that test and in doing so<br />
proved that it has the capacity to make a major contribution<br />
in international affairs through the rest of this century.<br />
One of the results of what happened in Lusaka is that the<br />
members of the Commonwealth will share a new confidence and<br />
assurance of what we can collectively achieve, and I am sure<br />
that Australians will warmly welcome the fact that the next<br />
Commonw,, ealth Heads of Government conference will be held in<br />
this country. </p>
