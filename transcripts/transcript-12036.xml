<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Where to from here?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well a short while ago I spoke to the Secretary General of the United Nations - Kofi Annan. I briefed him on discussions that have been under way today with a number of countries. I can't at this stage go any further. But of course we haven't been idle today contrary to what the Opposition's been suggesting. We've actually been doing quite a lot and talking to a lot of people. Clearly this is an issue that has to be dealt with in both a border protection way and also a diplomatic way. We don't retreat in any way from what we've done. It was the right thing to do, it was the legal thing to do, it was the thing to do in Australia's national interest. But of course in addition to that we need to talk to people and including the Secretary General of the United Nations with whom Australia has very good relations. We've worked together before. I briefed him. We had a good discussion and I filled him in on the discussions I had with other countries.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>What can the United Nations do to help?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>The United Nations of course has an overarching responsibility for refugee matters. And bear in mind that we've always argued that people should go through the United Nations system. That's the fair way and we've pointed out, Mr Ruddock's pointed out time and time again that what we object to is that people go outside the United Nation's High Commission for Refugees and they bypass an internationally credible which is fair to all potential refugees and jump the queue. Now that's been our constant objection and the more that the United Nations is properly involved then the more appropriate it is.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Does that mean [inaudible] asylum seekers could be dispersed...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISER:</p>
<p>Look I'm not going to speculate. It's a difficult issue and I'm not going to speculate. I'm just informing you that I have had this discussion with the Secretary General and I briefed him on discussions that we've had with a number of countries today.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Have you spoken to the Indonesian President?</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>What about the boat? There was talk yesterday that it might be towed out or..</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I'm not going to start talking or speculating about that. As far as the Indonesian President is concerned I've indicated to her office I wish to speak to her today. She's been tied up in a Cabinet meeting. I guess she'll ring me later tonight bear in mind there's a three hour time difference.</p>
