PRIME MINISTER<br />
CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
37TH LIONS CLUBS INTERNATIONAL CONVENTION<br />
CANBERRA 7 MAY 1989<br />
Your Excellencies,<br />
Distinguished Guests,<br />
Ladies and Gentlemen.<br />
On behalf of the Australian Government and the people of<br />
Canberra, I am delighted to welcome delegates and visitors<br />
attending the 37th Lions Clubs International Convention for<br />
Multiple District 201. I am particularly delighted to<br />
welcome our friends from Papua New Guinea.<br />
This is the fourth occasion your convention has met in<br />
Canberra, so many of you will be aware of what a first-class<br />
venue the National Capital is.<br />
Since your last convention here in 1981, Canberra has seen<br />
the completion of our magnificent new Parliament House. It<br />
is a proud symbol of our democratic system of Government and<br />
would be well worth a visit during your Convention.<br />
When people hear of Lions they immediately think of<br />
community service projects. These are very important, of<br />
course, and I congratulate you for them. But Lions<br />
encompasses much more.<br />
Few people are aware of the broad objectives of Lions and to<br />
this extent their understanding of the richness of Lions<br />
International is impaired.<br />
Let me mention one of particular significance. One of the<br />
Lions' objectives is " to promote the principles of good<br />
government and good citizenship". That is a goal with which<br />
I fully agree. Indeed in September 1988, as we celebrated<br />
our Bicentenary, I declared that 1989. would be the Year of<br />
Citizenship. During this year we are emphasising the importance of<br />
citizenship as a symbol of our commitment to our nation, and<br />
we are urging people who live and work legally in Australia<br />
but have not become citizens to think seriously about taking<br />
on the rights and responsibilities of citizenship. </p>
<p>Australian citizenship opens the door to fundamentally<br />
important rights the right to vote and to be elected to<br />
Parliament, the right to possess an Australian passport and<br />
to receive the protection of the Australian Government<br />
overseas, the right to permanent employment in the<br />
Australian Public Service and the right to serve in the<br />
armed forces.<br />
Citizenship also carries real and vital responsibilities to<br />
ensure that Australia remains a peaceful, tolerant and just<br />
nation. All citizens share the obligation to continue the<br />
hard work of earlier generations in building a nation that<br />
is free and prosperous. we all must strive to preserve the<br />
great traditions of our society: parliamentary democracy,<br />
the rule of law, freedom of the individual, and a fair go<br />
for all.<br />
So in this way the Government and Lions are working hand in<br />
hand to achieve objectives which we regard as fundamental to<br />
our society.<br />
Through the Year of Citizenship, Lions International in<br />
Australia can encourage as many people as possible who are<br />
not citizens to take the opportunity of becoming citizens at<br />
one of the many Citizenship Ceremonies being conducted this<br />
year. The essence of citizenship is commitment to our nation.<br />
Citizenship carries responsibilities as well as privileges.<br />
In this regard, the Lions objective " to take an. active<br />
interest in the civic, cultural, social and moral welfare of<br />
the community" truly represents citizenship in action.<br />
Since your first club in Australia was formed in Lismore in<br />
1947, Lions has given plentiful expression to your<br />
commitment to our nation.<br />
My Government believes that the commitment to a strong<br />
nation, and the determination to build a sense of belonging<br />
and loyalty, demands that a nation must endeavour to open<br />
the door' to prosperity for all its citizens. we have a<br />
special obligation to ensure that those less well off in<br />
Australia are not alienated, by deprivation and lack of<br />
opportunity, from the rest of the community.<br />
Citizenship demands that those who are disadvantaged are<br />
made to feel that they are not forgotten or written off but,<br />
on the contrary, that they are valued and can rely on the<br />
assistance of their fellow citizens to help them make ends<br />
meet and provide for their families.<br />
In this field of social justice, service clubs and<br />
governments work closely together. It is true to say that a<br />
partnership has grown up over the years in this area.<br />
Social justice in Australia today would not be as strong<br />
without your clubs. </p>
<p>While Governments play their part, service organisations<br />
like Lions have an important role in complementing the<br />
efforts of Governments. For your work you have truly earned<br />
the community's gratitude over many years.<br />
Last year my colleague, the Minister for Community Services<br />
and Health, Neal Blewett, launched the " Kangaroo Creek<br />
Gang", a National Children's Drug Education program. This<br />
innovative program is aimed at all Australian primary school<br />
children and is based on the premise that the harm caused by<br />
drug abuse can only be addressed, in the long term, by<br />
convincing our young people of the importance of avoiding<br />
experimentation with drugs and the advantages of choosing a<br />
healthy lifestyle.<br />
Thanks to the Lions Clubs of Australia this exceptional kit<br />
is available throughout the community for general use.<br />
The very long list of projects undertaken by service clubs<br />
is impressive. They have assisted in health promotion, in<br />
home and community care services, in aged care services, in<br />
disability projects and in child care centres.<br />
The first Lions Club in Papua-New Guinea was formed at Port<br />
Moresby in 1962 with the assistance of Australian Lions. It<br />
has developed an excellent working relationship with the<br />
Papua-New Guinea Government since then and provides all the<br />
elements of community work that are synonymous with Lions<br />
world wide.<br />
The relationship Australia shares with Papua-New Guinea has<br />
been forged over many years, and I look forward to<br />
strengthening further the already close bonds between us<br />
with the visit to Canberra this week by the Foreign Minister<br />
Michael Somare, and, later, by Prime Minister Rabbie<br />
Namaliu. Through creating and fostering a spirit of understanding<br />
among the peoples of the world and through uniting your<br />
clubs in bonds of friendship, good fellowship and mutual<br />
understanding, Lions has developed into a genuinely<br />
multicultural organisation and one which contributes to<br />
building friendly relations throughout the world.<br />
Your 1.3 million members are spread throughout the world.<br />
On every continent, hundreds of thousands of Lions, of many<br />
nationalities and creeds, are working towards your common<br />
goals. Today you can look at your organisation and see that its<br />
cultural and national diversity is indeed a source of<br />
strength and unity.<br />
In this respect, Lions has played an important part, and I<br />
hope it will continue to do so, in contributing to mutual<br />
understanding between the people of diverse backgrounds in<br />
Australia. </p>
<p>Australia is one of the most diverse multicultural nations<br />
on earth four out of ten Australians are immigrants or the<br />
children of immigrants. Half of them are from non English<br />
speaking backgrounds. It is a source of great strength for<br />
Australian society that we acknowledge and respect the<br />
cultural diversity of our nation.<br />
Delegates and visitors,<br />
I commend the 37th Multiple District 201 Convention<br />
Organising Committee for providing this opportunity for you<br />
to come together, to discuss, and plan for, the<br />
organisation's future. In the true tradition of Lions'<br />
gatherings, members and delegates don't just attend, they<br />
participate, and I know you will vigorously continue this<br />
tradition over the next four days.<br />
The mission of Lions International is one of great<br />
significance to the building up of an Australian citizenship<br />
expressed in action and in tolerance for others' opinions<br />
and backgrounds.<br />
I wish you every success in your task ahead.<br />
Once again, welcome to everyone and all the best for the<br />
future and a successful convention. </p>
