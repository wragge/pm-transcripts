CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
ALP DINNER SYDNEY<br />
3 DECEMBER 1986<br />
MR PRESIDENT, THE PREMIERS OF NEW SOUTH WALES AND WESTERN AUSTRALIA,<br />
DISTINGUISHED GUESTS, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.<br />
THIS IS THE LAST OF THIS YEAR'S ROUND OF DINNERS UNDER THE AUSPICES OF<br />
THE NEW SOUTH WALES LABOR PARTY. SOMETIMES, IT SEEMS ALMOST AS IF WE<br />
HAVE BEEN EATING OUR WAY THROUGH THE CALENDAR TOGETHER.<br />
BUT BEFORE YOU GET TOO RELAXED ABOUT THIS BEING THE FINALE, I HAVE TO WARN<br />
YOU THAT YOU MAY BE ASKED TO MEET A GREATER CHALLENGE NEXT YEAR.<br />
BECAUSE. AS PREMIER UNSWORTH HAS POINTED OUT. 1987 IS THE LAST FULL<br />
YEAR BEFORE THE CRUCIAL YEAR OF 1988.<br />
BOTH OUR GOVERNMENTS WILL BE FACING CRUCIAL ELECTIONS.<br />
AND THE PARTY. AT ALL LEVELS, WILL BE MOUNTING A MASSJIVE EFFORT.<br />
AND THAT MEANS WAR WAR TO THE LAST KNIFE AND FORK.<br />
BUT I DO THANK YOU ALL FOR THE SUPPORT YOU HAVE GIVEN BY YOUR PRESENCE AT<br />
T" ESS rUNCTIONSi AND THANK YOU IN ANTICIPATION FOR YOUR CONTINUED<br />
SUPPORT AND PARTICIPATION IN THE VITA. YEAR AHEAD.<br />
THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT THAT THE YEAR NOW DRAWING TO ITS CLOSE HAS BEEN,<br />
FOR AUSTRALIA, ONE OF THE MDST DIFF1 1Itfin rvr % TNEF TUr WAR </p>
<p>I SHALL DEAL LATER WITH OUR ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE AND OUR ECONOMIC<br />
PROSPECTS, BUT FIRST I WANT TO DEAL BRIEFLY WITH SOME OF THE POLITICAL<br />
ASPECTS OF OUR PRESENT SITUATION.<br />
I WANT TO EXAMINE THE CENTRAL FACT OF AUSTRALIAN POLITICALLIFE, AS IT<br />
HAS EMERGED AT THE END OF 1986.<br />
AND IT IS THIS:<br />
AT THE END OF A PERIOD OF ALMOST UNPRECEDENTED ECONOMIC<br />
DIFFICULTY, IN THE AFTERMATH OF A BUDGET OF UNAVOIDABLE BUT<br />
UNPALATABLE RIGOUR AND STRINGENCY, THE GOVERNMENT'S SUPPORT<br />
REMAINS FUNDAMENTALLY SOLID AND STRONG.<br />
THIS WOULD BE REMARKABLE FOR ANY GOVERNMENT IN MID-TERM.<br />
IT IS DOUBLY REMARKABLE FOR A GOVERNMENT SUCH AS OURS, IN TIMES SUCH<br />
AS THESE.<br />
WE HAD THE CHOICE BETWEEN TEMPORARY POPULARITY OR THE TOUGH MEASURES<br />
AND TOUGH DECISIONS NEEDED TO PLACE THE AUSTRALIAN ECONOMY ON FIRM<br />
FOUNDATIONS FOR THE FUTURE.<br />
FOR US IN THIS GOVEINMENr THAT MS REIALY NO CHOICE AT ALL. WE HOSE THE<br />
CORRECT CXJOFsE, THE CXAGEOUS COURSE, THE TOUGH COURSE. WE COUID DO NO OTHER IF<br />
WE WERE 70 FULFILL OUR COBLIGATIONS AND IESPONSIBILITIrES To THE AUSTRALIAN<br />
PEOPIE THE WHOE QI44ITt AND CARR OU THE TASK WI WHICH THEY HAVE<br />
ENTRIED US. </p>
<p>NEVERTHELESS, IT REMAINS A REMARKABLE FACT THAT AFTER ALL THIS. DESPITE<br />
ALL THIS. OUR SUPPORT STILL STANDS SO HIGH SOLID IN ITSELF. AND<br />
EXTREMELY REASSURING IN RELATION TO THAT OF OUR POLITICAL OPPONENTS.<br />
AND I SUGGEST, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THAT THE REASONS FOR THIS CAN BE<br />
EASILY IDENTIFIED.<br />
AND THAT IS SCTING BEYCD THE ETAILS OF COUR GOVEMET'S PERFOMNCE<br />
AND THE SPECIFIC POLICIES ME AE EFFECrING.<br />
IT CAN BE SUMMED UP IN ONE WORD STABILITY.<br />
AND THE ALTERNATIVE OFFERED BY OUR OPPONENTS CAN EQUALLY BE SUMMED UP<br />
IN ONE WORD THE EXACT OPPOSITE. INSTABILITY NOT ONLY THE GROSS<br />
INSTABILITY OF ITS LEADERSHIP, BUT THE EVEN GROSSER INSTABILITY, THE<br />
DISRUPTION AND DISHARMONY WHICH IS ALL THAT IS OFFERED B' WWT<br />
THEY ARE PEDDLING AROUND THE COUNTRY.<br />
I WANT TO DRAW YOUR ATTENTION TO A QUITE REMARKABLE TRUTH ABOUT OUR<br />
GOVERNMENT SOMETHING THAT HAS NEVER BEEN EQUALLED IN THE HISTORY OF<br />
THE FEDERATION.<br />
WE ARE NEARING THE END OF OUR FOURTH YEAR IN OFFICE.<br />
YET THE MINISTRY REMAINS INTACT. ITS PERSONNEL REMAINS UNCHANGED. </p>
<p>IT HAS BEEN A REMARKABLE PERFORMANCE AND AS I SAY, ONE WITHOUT<br />
PARALLEL IN FEDERAL HISTORY.<br />
BY CONTRAST, THE FRASER GOVERNMENT IN ITS FIRST FOUR YEARS SUFFERED<br />
NO LESS THAN NINE MINISTERIAL SACKINGS, RESIGNATIONS AND DEFECTIONS.<br />
AND THAT INSTABILITY IN GOVERNMENT HAS CARRIED THROUGH. INTO THEIR YEARS<br />
IN OPPOSITION.<br />
LOOK AT THE PICTURE OF THE LIBERAL PARTY AROUND AUSTRALIA.<br />
IN WESTERN AUSTRALIA, THEY HAVE JUST BRUTALLY DUMPED THEIR LEADER.<br />
IN VICTORIA, SCARCELY A MONTH PASSES WITHOUT: ANOTHER LEADERSHIP CHALLENGE<br />
OR MOVE FOR A CHALLENGE. AND MY INFM1TION IS THAT THERE WILL BE ANOTHER<br />
ICHALLENGjE BEFORE THIS MO~ NTH IS OUT.<br />
IN QUEENSLAND THEY ARE PAYING A BITTER PRICE FOR THEIR YEARS OF WEAKNESS,<br />
INCOMPETENCE AND LACK OF PRINCIPLE.<br />
IN NEW SOUTH WALES, AN OPPOSITION DEEPLY DIVIDED, DEVOID OF TRUE LEADERSHIP,<br />
THE MOST NEGATIVE OPPOSITION IN LIVING MEMORY.<br />
IN SOUTH AUSTRAL[ A, THEY SEEM TO HAVE SUNK WITHOUT TRACE.<br />
BUT ABOVE AL, IN THE FEDERAL SPHERE, THE OPPOSITION PRESENTS A PICTURE<br />
OF DIVISION AND DISUNITY AND DISARRAY, NOT EQUALLED AMONG THE CONSERVATIVE<br />
RANKS SINCE THE COLLAPSE OF THE U. A. P. IN THE EARLY 1940s. </p>
<p>AND THEN, THE TERM " UNITED AUSTRALIA PARTY" WAS JUST AS GREAT A MISNOMER<br />
AS THE TERM " LIBERAL" IS FOR THIS LOT TODAY. o WHEN THE NEW RIGHT AND THE<br />
OLD REACTION IS EVERYWHERE IN THE ASCENDANT. AND THAT IS THE REALLY<br />
IMPORTANT POINT.<br />
BECAUSE THE OPPOSITION'S DISUNITY IS NOT JUST A MATTER OF THEIR LEADERSHIPOR<br />
LACK OF IT.<br />
WHEN THEY CHANGE THEIR LEADERSHIP YET AGAIN -AND I SAY WHEN, NOT IFNOTHING<br />
BASIC WILL BE SOLVED.<br />
THE PROBLEM IS NOT JUST ONE OF PERSONNEL. ' IT GOES FAR DEEPER. THEIR<br />
LACK OF REAL LEADERSHIP AT BOTH THE STATE, AND FEDERAL LEVELS ONLY REFLECTS<br />
A DEEPER MALAISE. THEIR NEGATIVISM REFLECTS THEIR LACK OF DIRECTION.<br />
THEIR TOTAL LACK OF DIRECTION.<br />
THEY HAVE NO IDEA WHERE THEY WANT TO 60 AS A PARTY AND THEY CERTAINLY HAVE<br />
NO IDEA OF WHERE THEY WANT TO GO FOR THE NATION.<br />
THEY HAVE SUCCUMBED TO THE SIREN SONGS OF THE SO-CALLED NEW RIGHT.<br />
AS BARRIE<br />
SAME SORT<br />
AND GREED UNSWORTH HAS SAID, THE NEW RIGHT IS JUST THE OLD REACTION THE<br />
OF IDEAS THAT PRODUCED IN AUSTRALIA THE FREE OR-ALL OF AVARICE<br />
IN THE 1920soAND IN THE END, THE CATASTROPHE OF THE 1930s.<br />
I </p>
<p>AND THIS IS BECOMING CLEARER BY THE DAY TO THE PEOPLE OF AUSTRALIA. I AM<br />
GLAD TO SAY THAT THE TRUTH IS BEING REALISED BY THE TRADITIONAL SUPPORTERS<br />
OF THE OPPOSITION IN THE BUSINESS COMM'UNITY.<br />
ONLY LAST MONTH, THE DIRECTOR OF THE INDUSTRIAL COUNCIL OF THE CONFEDERATION<br />
OF AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRY, MR DAVID NOLAN, PRODUCED A REPORT ON THE OPPOSITION'S<br />
INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS PROPOSALS. HE ENTITLES HIS PAPER " ESCAPIST FANTASIES".<br />
AND MR NOLAN WROTE:<br />
" ITHEY ADVOCATE MASSIVE CHANGE WITH ITS COMMENSURATE RISK OF<br />
MASSIVE DISLOCATION, WITHOUT PROVIDING ANY CLEAR IDEA AS TO HOW<br />
THIS CHANGE WILL BE BROUGHT ABOUT NOR ANY EVIDENCE THAT IT WILL<br />
IN THE END BE BETTER FOR EMPLOYERS"<br />
" THE LIKELIHOOD" t THE CAI SAYS, " IS THAT TO ATTEMPT THE CHANGES<br />
OUR WOULD-BE REFORMERS URGE WUDPLUNGE EMPLOYERS INTO AN INDUSTRIAL<br />
MORASS OF UNKNOWN DEPTH."<br />
AS THE MONTHS GO BY. THE NEGATIVISM AND DESTRUCTIVENESS OF THE OPPOSITION<br />
WILL BECOME MORE AND MORE MANIFEST.<br />
BUTl LET ME MAKE THIS VERY CLEAR.<br />
CONFIDENT AS I AM OF OUR VINDICATION AND OUR VICTORY, WE DO NOT<br />
SEEK-VICTORY BY DEFAULT THROUGH THE FAILINGS AND WEAKNESSES OF OUR<br />
OPPONENTS. THAT WAS NOT HOW WE WON IN 1983.<br />
THAT IS NOT HOW WE WON AGAIN IN 1984.-</p>
<p>AND THE VICTORY WHICH IS TO COME WILL BE BASED ON OUR POSITIVENESS AND<br />
OUR POSITIVE VISION FOR THE FUTURE OF AUSTRALIA.<br />
THE IMPORTANT THING IS NOT TO DWELL UPON OR WHIINGE ABOUIT THE UNPRECEDENTED<br />
DIFFICULTIES OF THE TASK WE FACE THIS YEAR AND WILL CONTINUE TO FACE IN<br />
THE YEAR TO COME.<br />
THE REALLY IMPORTANT THING IS THE WAY IN WHICH WE, AS A COMMUNITY*<br />
AS A NATION, AS A PEOPLE AND AS A GOVEIRNMENT ARE ABLE TO MEASURE UP<br />
TO THOSE DIFFICULTIES.<br />
IT IS PRECISELY BECAUSE 1986 WAS SUCH A TREMENDOUSLY DIFFICULT YEAR THAT<br />
IT ALSO DESERVES Tb GO DOW AS OUR BEST AND FINEST YEAR.<br />
I AM CERTAINLY PROUD OF OUR ECONOMIC ACHIEVEMENTS IN THE FIRST THREE<br />
YEARS, NOT JUST THE CREATION OF 670oO00 NEW JOBS BUT THE IMPLEMENTATION<br />
OF THE VAST NATIONAL TASK OF ECONOMIC RECONSTRUCTION AND REGENERATION.<br />
BUT THE TASK IN THOSE YEARS. GREAT AS IT WAS, WAS NOT AS DIFFICUIT AS<br />
THIS HAS BEEN.<br />
AND THAT IS WHY I DESCRIBE 1986 AS OUR PROUDEST YEAR, OUR BEST YEAR<br />
SO FAR.<br />
1986 WAS THE YEAR IN WHICH THE TRANS-ATLANTIC AGRICULTURAL TRADE WAR<br />
TURNED WHITE-HOT AT THE EXPENSE OF AUSTRALIAN FARMERS. </p>
<p>IT WAS THE YEAR IN WHICH OPEC'S DISCIPLINE FINALLY CRACKED AND<br />
OIL PRICES PLUMMETED TO THEIR LOWEST LEVELS IN 13 YEARS -BRINGING<br />
PRICES OF RELATED COMMODITIES IMPORTANT TO AUSTRALIA DOWN WITH THEM.<br />
IT WAS THE YEAR IN WHICH THE GREAT INTERNATIONAL CURRENCY BATTLE BEING<br />
WAGED BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND JAPAN MOVED SHARPLY FURTHER<br />
AGAINST JAPANESE PRODUCERS TURNING THE SCREWS STILL TIGHTER ON OUR<br />
EXPORTERS OF COAL AND IRON ORE.<br />
THESE, AND OTHER INTERNATIONAL FORCES TOGETHER PRODUCED A SHARP FALL<br />
IN AUSTRALIA'S TERMS OF TRADE, AFTER AN ALREADY BAD YEAR IN 1985. THE LOSS<br />
To ouR iNP w~ Ls $ 6 BiLLON.<br />
NO ECONOMY COULD EMERGE UNSCATHED FROM SUCH A BATTERING.<br />
AND NO RESPONSIBLE GOVERNMENT COULD STEP ASIDE AND AVOID THE NEED FOR<br />
TOUGH DECISIONS IMPOSED UPON A COUNTRY AND AN ECONOMY SUCH AS OURS BY<br />
SO MASSIVE A LOSS OF NATIONAL INCOME.<br />
AS A GOVERNMENT WE ACCEPTED THE UNPALATABLE BUT NECESSARY DISCIPLINES<br />
IN WAGE FIXING, MONETARY POLICY AND IN THE BUDGET.<br />
MOST IMPORTANTLY OF ALL, WITH A DETERMINATION UNMATCHED IN AUSTRALIA'S<br />
PEACE-TIME HISTORY, WE SET ABOUT THE TASK OF REORIENTING THE NATION'S<br />
ECONOMIC INSTITUTIONS AND FOSTERING THE GROWTH OF DYNAMIC, OUTWARD-LOOKING<br />
INDUSTRIES WHICH CAN TAKE ON THE WORLD'$ BEST AND WIN.<br />
BUT LET ME EMPHASISE THAT THIS HAS NOT BEEN A TASK WE SET ABOUT, ONLY IN<br />
1986. </p>
<p>FROM DAY ONE FROM MARCH 1983 WE RECOGNISED THAT THE ONLY PATH WHICH<br />
COULD GUARANTEE THE FUTURE PROSPERITY, STABILITY AND-COMPETITIVENESS OF<br />
THE AUSTRALIAN ECONOMY WAS TO OPEN OURSELVES TO THE OPPORTUNITIES AND THE<br />
PRESSURES OF A DEREGULATED TRADING AND FINANCIAL ENVIRONMENT.<br />
SO OVER THE PAST THREE AND A HALF YEARS WE HAVE SET OURSELVES THE TASK<br />
OF REFORMING AND RESTRUCTURING AUSTRALIA'S ECONOMIC INSTITUTIONS AND<br />
THE FRAMEWORK WITHIN WHICH THEY OPERATE.<br />
AS WE DRAW NEAR TO THE CLOSE OF 1986, WE HAVE REAL CAUSE FOR PRIDE THAT<br />
THESE GREAT TASKS OF REFORM WE SET OUTSELVES HAVE BEGUN TO BEAR FRUIT.<br />
AND THE BEST CAUSE FOR OPTIMISM CERTAINLY AT THIS STAGE A CAUTIOUS,<br />
CAREFUL OPTIMISM LIES WITH THE PEOPLE THEMSELVESTHE<br />
NEW DETERMINATION TO LOOK CRITICALLY AT THE WAY WE HAVE DONE<br />
THINGS IN THE PAST, SO AS TO FIND WAYS OF DOING THEM BETTER;<br />
THE NEW WILLINGNESS TO SEIZE OPPORTUNITIES AND MAKE THE MOST<br />
OF THEM FOR AUSTRALIA; AND<br />
THE NEW RECOGNITION THAT ALL OF US BUSINESS, GOVERNMENTS, WXGE<br />
EARNERS HAVE TO DO WITH LESS, FOR A TIME, IN ORDER TO SPREAD<br />
FAIRLY THE BURDEN OF ADJUSTM4ENT NOW AND TO SET THE BEST BASIS FOR<br />
SECURE ECONOMIC GROWTH. </p>
<p>AND THAT IS WHY I SAY TONIGHT AS I HAVE BEEN SAYING AROUND AUSTRALIA IN<br />
THE LAST MONTHs THAT WE CAN ENTER 1987 WITH CAUTIOUS OPTIMISM.<br />
I rHE FOUNDATIONS HAVE BEEN LAID OVER THE PAST THREE AND A HALF YEARS.<br />
NOW WITH THE SHARP REALIGNMENT OF THE CURRENCY, WE ARE ABLE TO EMERGE<br />
FROM A PERIOD OF TURBULENCE INTO A PERIOD OF RENEWED COMPETITIVENESS.<br />
BARRING UNFORESEEN EXTERNAL FACTORS6 AND, I MUST STRESS. GIVEN CONTINUED<br />
RESTRAINT, AUSTRALIA CAN RESTORE ITS LONG TERM ECONOMIC STABILITY AND<br />
PROSPERITY.<br />
THERE* IS ONE LAST POINT I MOST EMPHASISE.<br />
IT IS CRUCIAL TO OUR PROSPECTS AT THE NEXT' ELECTIONS BOTH NATIONALLY<br />
AND HERE IN NEW SOUTH WALES.<br />
I HEAR IT ASSERTED. FROM TIME TO TIME, THAT, IN OUR PREOCCUPATION WITH<br />
THE GREAT PROBLEMS OF ECONOMIC MANAGEMENT, THE GOVERNMENT HAS NEGLECTED<br />
ITS TRADITIONAL BASE OF LABOR. SUPPORT.<br />
I REJECT THAT ASSERTION IN ITS ENTIR. ETY.<br />
IT IS TRUE-THAT OUR CENTRAL PRIORITY, THIS YEAR AND NEXT YEAR WILL BE TO<br />
GET THE ECONOMIC SOLUTIONS RIGHT. IT IS TRUE THAT IN SETTING ABOUT THIS<br />
TASK) WE GIVE THE HIGHEST PRIORITY TO MAINTAINING THE HEALTH AND BUILDING<br />
ANEW THE STRENGTH OF THE PRIVATE SECTOR. </p>
<p>.11.<br />
AND THIS IS THE WHOLE POINT.<br />
THEY ARE COMPLEMENTARY. OUR PRtURITIESIARE NOT CONTRADICTORY.<br />
BECAUSE, WITHOUT AN EXPANDING PRIVATE SECTOR, THE TWO MOST FUNDAMENTAL OF<br />
ALL LABOR OBJECTIVES WILL BE SIMPLY UNACHIEVABLE.<br />
AND WHAT ARE THOSE TWO FUNDAMENTAL OBJECTIVES<br />
THE CREATION OF JOBS AND THE PROVISION OF THE COMMUNITY SERVICES<br />
EDUCATION. HEALTH. WELFARE AND THE REST WHICH CAN ONLY BE AS GOOD AND<br />
FAIR AS THE COMMUNITY ITSELF IS WILLING AND ABLE TO PAY FOR.<br />
AND TO IMAGINE THAT THESE TWO BASIC LABOR OBJECTIVES CAN BE ACHIEVED WITHOUT<br />
THE NECESSARY FRAMEWORK OF A STRONG AND GROWING ECONOMY AND IN PARTICULAR<br />
A STRONG AND GROWING PRIVATE SECTOR-IS, TO ADAPT DAVID NOLAN'S WORDS<br />
IN ANOTHER CONTEXT, JUST " ESCAPIST FANTASY".<br />
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN<br />
I HAVE SAID THAT WE CAN APPROACH THE COMING YEAR WITH CAUTIOUS OPTIMISM,<br />
AS FAR AS THE ECONOMY IS CONCERNED.<br />
THERE ARE STILL TREMENDOUS DIFFICULTIES AHEAD -INDEED FOR A LONG TIME<br />
AHEAD. THERE WILL STILL BE THE NEED FOR TOUGH DECISIONS.<br />
THERE WILL SI ILL BiE A NEED FOR RESTRAINT.<br />
' S .5. </p>
<p>.12.<br />
THERE WILL STILL BE CALLS UPON THE STEADINESS AND STEADFASTNESS ON THE<br />
PART OF THE PEOPLE OF AUSTRALIA NOT LEAST. THOSE OF US WH. O COMPRISE THE<br />
GREAT LABOR MOVEMENT OF AUSTRALIA.<br />
BUT THERE ARE TWO THINGS IN WHICH MY CONFIDENCE IS NOT BOUNDED BY THE<br />
SORT OF CAUTIOUS OPTIMISM I SOUND, IN RESPECT OF PREDICTIONS ABOUT THE<br />
ECONOMY. I HAVE NO INHIBITIONS. NO RESERVATIONS ABOUT THE CAPACITY OF THE. AUSTRALIAN<br />
PEOPLE TO HAKE A SOUND,. COImON SLNSE JUDCEMENT ADOUT TIIEIR GOVERNMENT,<br />
ABOUT THE ALTERNATIVE AND ABOUT THE FUTURE THEY WANT FOR THEMSELVES AND<br />
THEIR FAMILIES.<br />
AND FROM THAT AUTOMATICALLY FLOWS MY SECOND GROUND FOR CONFIDENCE.<br />
THEY ARE REALLY ONE AND THE SAME THING.<br />
BECAUSE MY CONFIDENCE IN THE JUDGEMENT AND COMMON SENSE OF THE PEOPLE IS<br />
EXACTLY THE SAME AS MY CONFIDENCE IN WHAT THEIR JUDGEMENT AND THEIR VERDICT<br />
WILL BE, WHEN THEY COME TO EXERCISE THEIR CHOICE IN THE ELECTIONS.<br />
1988 IS THE BICENTENARY YEAR.<br />
THAT MAKES IT BY ANY STANDARD, A GREAT YEAR FOR AUSTRALIA.<br />
BUT I AM ABSOLUTELY CONFIDENT THAT IT WILL BE MADE AN EVEN GREATER YEAR<br />
BY VIRTURE OF THE JUDGEMENT THAT THE PEOPLE OF NEW SOUTH WALES AND THE<br />
PEOPLE OF AUSTRALIA WILL MAKE AT THE NEXT ELECTIONS. </p>
<p>I ,. f .13.<br />
THE YEAR WE CELEBRATE THE PAST WILL BE THE YEAR WE WIN FOR THE FUTUREFOR<br />
THIS GREAT STATE* FOR THIS GREAT NATION, FOR THIS GREAT PEOPLE'. </p>
