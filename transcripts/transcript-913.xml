FEDERAL COUNICIL, LIBERAL PARTY OF AUJSTRALIA<br />
HDEA T HOTEL CAN15ERRA, CANEERPA<br />
Srjech by the Prime Ministerj w) Rt. Hon. Sir Robert Men~ ies<br />
Mr, President and Delegates<br />
I have been reading with considerable pleasure<br />
over the last few days the reports made to this meeting from<br />
the Branches and I am most gratified by the references in themn<br />
to myself. I am even more gratified by the references made to<br />
my wife and on her behalf I want to thank you very sincerely for<br />
them. ( Applause) You know, I w~ ant to take you back quite a few<br />
years to the beginnings of our Party. In 194 when the Opposition<br />
in the Federal Parliament had suffered one of the severest<br />
drubbings in memory, we were in a state of some confusion and<br />
I resolved then and there that somethiing had to be done. There<br />
were splinter groups everywhere some 13 or 14 parties and I<br />
got together with some of our stalwarts Bill Anderson ther'e<br />
was one of them, associated with a particular group.. and. all the<br />
letters calling -the groups together went out of my office on thie<br />
Opposition side of the Parliament. We know what the result has<br />
been and it was brought perhaps to its greatest climax in November<br />
when we had our great victory. ( Applause<br />
Now my contribution to that victory was to sot the<br />
date of the election but it was the Party which rallied and in no<br />
election have I led a Party which was more united and more<br />
determined and more cohesive than was our Party last year.<br />
( Applause) This indeed was the seventh successive election<br />
success ( Applause) It is often said after a series of victories<br />
such as we have had that in the normal course, the pendulum<br />
principle, that we might expect to lose two or three elections<br />
and to be out of office for some years. I hnve it in my ageing<br />
bones that having won seven elections there is no reason<br />
whatsoever why the Liberal Party should not win the next two or<br />
three or four or even five more elections for we have been blessed<br />
by an Opposition which has fallen from one confusion of mind to<br />
another. This Federal Council Meeting is for all of us a<br />
spirited occasion. We will hove differences in detail and applicati<br />
on expressed but they will not mean differences in the<br />
principles of our Party. In a Party of less virility than ours,<br />
you might say that the reverses of 1961, coming after an<br />
unprecedented twelve years of office, could have caused disintegration,<br />
internal revolts and surrender to external pressures.<br />
The opposite turned out to be true. We had, at<br />
Canberra, two years of unsurpassed loyalty, steadfastness and,<br />
in its literal sense, integrity. That was the principal reason<br />
for our great victory on November 30-th, 1963.<br />
But there was another reason, which is to be<br />
remembered at all times. We rediscovered the profound appeal<br />
of Liberalism to intelligent and eager youth.<br />
It may be m~ ore than useful to elaborate this<br />
proposition, and to analyse some of the reasons for it. In all<br />
the great meetings I addressed, I found, for the first time for<br />
some years, a great preponderance of listeners in the younger </p>
<p>-2-<br />
age-groups. And they werc listeners, eager to hear and to understand,<br />
plainly concerned about the problems, including the<br />
international problems, of our country. It did both my heart<br />
and my mind good to see them.<br />
Labour speakers had no such experience, as their<br />
leaders have reluctantly conceded.<br />
What do the newer Australian generations want from<br />
those of us who are actively engaged in the formulation and<br />
execution of policy?<br />
Do they just want " security" in the sense of that word<br />
which connotes a powerful paternal government which accepts and<br />
performs all duties% leaving it to the citizen to enjoy his<br />
" rights". If so, the Australian Labour Party might suit them.<br />
It does not understand democracy. A true democracy requires in<br />
the citizen the acceptance of duties and the self-respecting<br />
reception of rights,<br />
A democratic country is an independent country because<br />
it has independent proud and balanced citizens.<br />
It is a trite saying ( though the Socialists don't<br />
understand it) that independent nations are not made up of<br />
dependent people; that the greatest privilege of democratic<br />
citizenship is to serve a community in which he shares power and<br />
responsibility. It was once the claim of our opponents that we were<br />
reactionary, that we wanted to turn the clock back to<br />
restore laissez-faire, to say " each for himself and the Devil<br />
take the hindmost as the elephant said as he danced among the<br />
chickens." ( Laughtor)<br />
We have, over many years, demonstrated the falsity of<br />
this charge. We have greatly aided social justice. We have not<br />
just kept the ring and allowed vitory to go to the strong. We<br />
have encouraged free enterprise, have recognised the making of<br />
a people as one of the dynamic inducements to the taking of capital<br />
risks in the development of the nation. But we have insisted upon<br />
the performance of social and industrial obligations; we have<br />
shown that industrial progress is not to be based upon the poverty<br />
or despair of those who cannot compete.<br />
After over fourteen consecutive years of political<br />
office at the centre of the nation, we can point to a range of<br />
achievements, in industrial justice and peace, in social services<br />
in a growingly successful attack upon poverty, in widely distributed<br />
rising standards of housing and of living generally, which can be<br />
matched by very few countries in the world. ( Applause)<br />
How has this been brought about? The answer is, to my<br />
mind, clear enough,<br />
We have been human, with a sense of human destiny and<br />
human responsibility. As the etymology of our name " Liberal"<br />
indicates, we have stood for freedom. We have realised that men<br />
and women are not just cyphers in a calculation, but are individual<br />
human beings whose individual welfare and development must be the<br />
main concern of government. ( Applause)<br />
We have no doctrinaire political philosophy. Where<br />
government action or control has seemed to us to be the best<br />
answer to a practical problon, we have adopted that answer at the<br />
risk of being called Socialists. But our first impulse is always </p>
<p>-3-<br />
to seek the private onteriuriso answrr to help the individual to<br />
help himself, to create a climate, economic, social, industrial,<br />
favourable -to his activity arnd growtii.,<br />
Our opponents have an exactly opposite point of<br />
approach. Their first instinct is the * Socialist one-. " The<br />
right way to deal with this matter is for the Government to<br />
run it!" Private enterprise and effort are the alternatives<br />
to which they reluctantly turn only when the Socialist plan proves<br />
to be constitutionally incompetent or in practice unworkable.<br />
The validity of this brief analysis is, I think seen<br />
with increasing clarity by a younger and, on the whole better<br />
educated generation, who want the opportunity to make Zheir own<br />
way and place in the world, and reject the feeble notion that the<br />
chief end of man, from the cradle to -the grave, is to be ordered<br />
aroundcbyt and live dependent upon, " the Government". But this<br />
utter con rast of approach between Liberal and Labour is still,<br />
in the minds of too many people, obscured by two things.<br />
One of them is -that the Socialists, especially alk<br />
election times pt their Socialist objectives and principles<br />
under cover. ' hpy appeal to the " profit motive", that diabolical<br />
thing, by offering to the electorts both rewards and fairies, In<br />
appropriate electorates, they are, for all practical purposes,<br />
Liberals, but with more money to spend. 1 It is not long since<br />
their leader promised that, if elected, he would so to speak<br />
suspend the Socialist objective for the life of Lhe ParliamenL<br />
What his outside masters would have done about it we will,<br />
fortunately, never know,<br />
These are, of course, pretty shoddy manoeuvres, and<br />
have lacked success with the general body of electors for a<br />
long time. But they have deceived far too many people who ought<br />
to be our supporters, It is for us, in this organisation, to<br />
make clear the grc1-at basic conflict of principle and method to<br />
which I have referred,<br />
The other factor which tends to obscure the true nature<br />
of the conflict, is the allegation that the Liberals themselves<br />
" are Socialists when it suits them." Witness the Post Office,<br />
the telephone service the railways, the groat Snowy Mountains<br />
Scheme, not one of which, of course, could have been either<br />
created or sustained by private investors. To say these things<br />
is merely to prove what I said earlier. We are not doctrinaire.<br />
We have no instinctive passion for government control or operation<br />
for its own sake.<br />
Our first question is not whether the Government could<br />
do this thing, but whether private citize-, ns could. If the answer<br />
is that they could, our answer is that they should. We deal withach<br />
case on its merits9 without dogma or prejudice.<br />
Sometimes a middle course must be followed, I will<br />
take two examples. The first is, broadcastin and television. Labour,<br />
the Socialist party, wanted and wants Government stations only.<br />
We have stood for a dual system with commercial stations competing.<br />
We have much reason to be thanklul that such a system exists.<br />
The second is Civil Aviation. Our internal flying<br />
services were pioneered by private enterprise. A Labour Government<br />
established T. A. A. the Australian Airlines Commission and<br />
tried to give it a monopoly. The Act was successfully challenged<br />
on constitutional grounds, and private enterprise continued, </p>
<p>a When we came back in-to office, we did not seek to destroy the<br />
Government airline, which was well rwinaged and efficient. But<br />
we wanted competition. We thus evolved our " two major airlines"<br />
policy one government, one private. In the result, the public<br />
interest has been magnificently served. Here we have the contrast<br />
between doctrinaire socialism and the practical approach of a<br />
Liberal and enterprise-encourziging administration.<br />
As I have many times said, Socialism is both<br />
reactionary and out-dated. I can understand how it attracted<br />
the support of radical thinkers after the industrial revolution<br />
in Great Britain and later at the turn of the century, when<br />
industrial power was in a limited number of hands, when the<br />
rights of employed people were imperfectly recognised, when<br />
trades unions were too commonly regareed as subversive bodies,<br />
when the economic doctrines of laisse ' z-faire held sway, when<br />
social services were almost non-existent, there grew up in many<br />
minds a belief an egalitorian belief in the virtues of<br />
uniformity. There was, and is, no uniformity among personalities,<br />
or talents or energy. We have learned that the right answer<br />
is to set Zhe individual free, to aim at equality of opportunity,<br />
to protect the individual against oppression to create a society<br />
in which rigiats and duties are recognised ana made effective.<br />
In this free society, the tyrannical notion of an all-powerful<br />
Stata is rejected and dogmatic Socialism with it. In its<br />
place, we have puZ opportunity without any class privilege,<br />
social and economic justice, and the civilised democratic<br />
conception that governments are not the masters of the people,<br />
but their servants. I have stated, I venture to believe, our Liberal<br />
creed. We must believe in it, preach it and practise it9<br />
fcjr its success and survival are essential to the future of<br />
our nation. </p>
