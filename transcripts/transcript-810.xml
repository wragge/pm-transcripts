FOR PEESS~ P. M. No. r73/ 1961<br />
MALAYS IA<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister the Rt. Hon. Sir Robert Menzies<br />
" Australia welcomes the new Federation of Malaysia<br />
which comes into being tomorrow. We wish it well in every<br />
way and believe that it will contribute to the welfare and<br />
prosperity of its people. The joining together of the -three<br />
former British territories of Singapore, Sarawak and North<br />
Borneo ( or Sabah as it is now to be called) with the independent<br />
Federation of Malaya to form Malaysia represents a population<br />
increase for the new Federation of 3,000,000 people and the<br />
addition of a wide diversity of economic resources and skills.<br />
Malaya has made great progress since it received independence<br />
in August, 1957 and has shown its ability to build a free and<br />
prosperous nation, I am confident that the accretion of the<br />
three new states will give great scope for development to all<br />
of them. I have attempted to sum up my own views and what<br />
I think are the views of all Australians in the following<br />
message which I am sending to the Prime Minister Designate<br />
of Malaysia, Tunku Abdul Rahman, todaytWe<br />
in Australia have expressed a clear and<br />
continuing conviction that the establishment of<br />
Malaysia would be a welcome and progressive development<br />
in the history of South East Asia. Events of this<br />
magnitude do not take place without frictions and<br />
hazards. You and the other representative leaders<br />
of the constituent elements of Malaysia have<br />
maintained your dedication and belief in what you<br />
believe to be best for your peoples. Now Malaysia<br />
has been brought into existence as a throat to none<br />
and a positive factor for stability and progress.<br />
The contacts and associations between our<br />
Governments and peoples have been many and close,,<br />
They have been marked by feelings of mutual goodwill<br />
and, on our part, by respect for and appreciation of<br />
your achievements in the few short years since<br />
indepondence. The main features which distinguish<br />
the performonce wise and tolerant government,<br />
free institutions and policies of economic growth<br />
and social development provide a good augury for the<br />
future of the new and wider Federation,'<br />
Sir Robert said he also wished to comment on the<br />
report issued by the Secretary-General of the United Nations,<br />
U Thant, on thne findings of his representatives concerning the<br />
wishes of the peoples of Sarawak and Sabah ( North Borneo) with<br />
regard to the inclusion of their territories in Malaysia.<br />
The Prime Minister expressed his satisfaction that<br />
the United Nations Secretary-General had confirmed in such<br />
unmistakable terms what the Australian Government had believed<br />
to be true, namely, that the substantial majority of the peoples<br />
of the territories of Sabah and Sarawak were in favour of Malaysia.<br />
Both in public statemonts and in diplomatic exchanges the Australian<br />
Government had expressed their conviction that this wa-s the case. / 2 </p>

The Prime Minister recalled how the role of the<br />
United Nations Secretary-General in the affair had originated.<br />
The Foreign Ministers of Indonesia and the Philippines at their<br />
meeting in Manila in June told the Malayan representatives that<br />
" they would welcome the formation of Malaysia provided the<br />
support of the people of the Borneo territories is ascertained<br />
by an independent and impartial authority, the Secretary-General<br />
of the United Nations or his representative." Later the<br />
Heads of Goverrmient of Indonesia, Malaya and the Philippines,<br />
meeting in Manila laid down the torms under which they would<br />
request U Thant o carry out this task of ascertainment.<br />
This task has now been fully discharged.<br />
The Prime Minister went on to say that the<br />
Malayan Government as well as the Governments of Britain and<br />
the Borneo territories had done everything that might reasonably<br />
be expected to gain acceptance of Malaysia by its neighbours.<br />
The Secretary-GeneralTs findings were regarded by the Australian<br />
Government as deciding this question beyond further argument.<br />
It was obvious that his representatives had<br />
discharged their functions with great care and sense of<br />
responsibility and the Australian Government strongly hoped<br />
that the findings would be accepted by the Governments concerned.<br />
The Australian Minister for External Affairs, Sir<br />
Garfield Barwick, had made abundantly clear to Indonesian leaders,<br />
during the last few days, Australia's position on these matters.<br />
