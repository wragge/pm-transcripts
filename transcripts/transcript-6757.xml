SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER TO THE<br />
BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONAL WOMEN/ ADVANCE AUSTRALIA AWARDSOUTHERN<br />
CROSS HOTEL, MELBOURNE<br />
OCTOBER 1985<br />
Thank you for your introduction, Bev.<br />
Mr and Mrs Spencer, Miss Michel, our special guest, US<br />
Astronaut Dr Shannon Lucid, BPW members and guests.<br />
It is a great pleasure for me to be here tonight to<br />
Announce the winners of the Business and Professional<br />
Women/ Advance Australia'Award for 1985.<br />
In making the award, the sponsors adopted as their<br />
criteria the Affirmative Action principles outlined by<br />
the Government last year when we established the<br />
Affirmative Action Pilot Program and provided guidance<br />
for employers on how best to plan systematically to<br />
improve employment opportunities for women.<br />
It is particularly gratifying to see the Government's<br />
approach complemented by this important award.<br />
I have been delighted at the co-operation the Government<br />
has received from private sector and higher education<br />
employers and from unions in putting to the practical<br />
test the Government's Affirmative Action policies andprinciples.<br />
Our 12-month Pilot Program, which concluded in July,<br />
demonstrated that it is possible, and indeed beneficial<br />
to both employer and employee, for our approach to<br />
improving woimen's job opportun-, ities to be adopted.<br />
Indeed, the private sector pa~ rticipants in the Pilot<br />
Program have described it as ma unique and innovative<br />
step". </p>
<p>Earlier this week,, I ' announced the Government's<br />
intention to legislate for Affirmative Action for women<br />
in higher education employment and in those companies<br />
employing more than 100 persons. Let me detail the main<br />
feature of the legislation.<br />
The Government will introduce legislation into Federal<br />
Parliamecnt in the Autumn Session in 1986. That<br />
legislation will require emnployers to report annua~ lly to<br />
the Governmenc on their progress in developing an 8-step<br />
Affirmative Action Program.<br />
We shall be proclaiming our legislation in stages. it<br />
is my strong view that this will enable the legislation<br />
to be implemented in a planned and non-disruptive<br />
fashion. It will enable a new Agency to be created<br />
within the Employment anli Industrial Relations portfolio<br />
to administer the Act to establish its procedures,<br />
prepare the resources necessary to assist companies and<br />
institutions and have adequate time to develop cooperative<br />
relations with those organisations affected by<br />
the legislation.<br />
All those covered by the new Act will have to submit a<br />
short report which will be available to the public,<br />
providing general employment data by sex and some<br />
general comments on the overall progress of their<br />
program. In addition, a longer and-confidential report setting<br />
out in more detail how the employer is progressing with<br />
the implementation of the 8-step program will be<br />
required.<br />
The last thing that I and the Government wants to see is<br />
our principal objective of improving women's job<br />
opportunities becoming subsumed by excessively<br />
bureaucratic procedures or administrative difficulties<br />
caused by too large a number of organisations being<br />
required to comply simultaneously.<br />
What we propose instead is that that part of the<br />
legislation cov ering higher education come intooperation<br />
immediately the legislation is passed,<br />
expected to be around August 1986. That part of the<br />
legislation covering the private sector will be<br />
operational six months later, around February 1987.<br />
By February 1988, 262 companies employing more than<br />
1,000 people would submit their first reports. By<br />
February 1989 317 companies with between 500 and 999<br />
employees would begin compliance and by February 1990<br />
those 2890 companies with between 100 and 499 employees<br />
woul. d hav~ e b2' 7Gr1 th'_ ir 2r-ICC. </p>
<p>It is my expectation that most large Australian<br />
companies will adopt a very responsible attitude towards<br />
their present and potential women employees and will not<br />
wait until they are bound by the letter of the law to<br />
start developing affirmative action strategies for<br />
improving women's job prospects.<br />
In this connexion, I am very pleased that the Business<br />
Council of Australiia and the Confed. eration of. Australian<br />
industry have decided to establish a Council for Equal<br />
Employment Opportunity to encourage companies to begin<br />
immediately to introduce affirmative action.<br />
I see that self-regulatory proposal as being totally<br />
compatible with the Government's legislative approach.<br />
I note that the proposed Council is expected to have a<br />
life span in otber words it will go out of<br />
existence by the time that all Australian companies<br />
employing more than 100 people are covered by our<br />
legi slat ion.<br />
The Government will co-operate and support business'<br />
self-regulatory approach because we want the important<br />
question of developing new employment opportunities for<br />
women to be adopted with enthusiasm and creativity by<br />
companies. Importantly, I am pleased to announce that the<br />
Government's legislation will be supplemented by a<br />
number of other measures which we believe will support<br />
the development of equal opportunity for women.<br />
We plan to act in three areas: education, child care<br />
and legislative restrictions to wo~ ncn s employment.<br />
Thlie Government accepts its responsibilities for ensuring<br />
that our education and training systems are providing<br />
maximum opportunities for young women to acquire a wide<br />
range of qualifications and skills to enhance their job<br />
prospects. Recently we announced the establishment of<br />
the Australian Traineeships System a program to<br />
enhance the training and work experience of 16 and 17.<br />
year olds.<br />
We are also currently developing a national policy on<br />
the education of girls. This will be finalised by the<br />
end of the year and will set goals and identify<br />
priorities for the achievement of equality in<br />
educational outcomes for girls.<br />
We are also aware that the numbers of women undertaking<br />
engineering courses is still very, very small and that<br />
Pilot Program employers expressed difficulty in<br />
recrui ting engineers. Accordi nqil/ Senator Si. usan Ryan,<br />
has develo;-? d a proposalI fo--a . a: og Or iada<br />

This pilot will be based in Melbourne and will link<br />
educational institutions providing engineering courses<br />
to potential employers of engineers and to schools.<br />
Through the pilot program, the Commonwealth will assist<br />
schools and tertiary institutions to present engineering<br />
as a realistic career option for young women and to make<br />
it more accessible for them. The project will seek to<br />
involve companies which employ engineer-, in orient,&amp;' Irl<br />
and work experience ac~~ iviLies.<br />
The Government recognises that without access to child<br />
caref, many women's job opportunities are restricted.<br />
Since we came to Office the Government has more than<br />
doubled spending on child care under the Children's<br />
Services Program and has added 20,000 places to those<br />
existing when we assumed Office. In the recent Budget<br />
we confirmed the Government's intention to proceed with<br />
the establishment of an additional 20,000 places over<br />
the next three years. In other words, in just 5 years<br />
we will have more than doubled the supply of child care<br />
places throughout Australia. This exemplifies my<br />
Government's continuing commitment to taking measures to<br />
improve the Status of Women.<br />
A number of companies participating in the Pilot Program<br />
expressed interest in providing work-based child care<br />
facilities for their employees. However, they also<br />
conveyed to the Government their extraordinary<br />
frustration at the mire of regulations at all levels of<br />
Government which they had to contend with in order to<br />
even investigate the provision of such facilities.<br />
It is consistent with my Government's interest in<br />
deregulating where appropriate to examine some of the<br />
regulations governing the location of child care centres<br />
to see whether unnecessary and archaic restrictions<br />
could be removed. To this end, I have decided to<br />
approach the States to ask them to remove existing<br />
licensing requirements and regulations restricting child<br />
care facilities to ground floor locations. This will<br />
K not be at the expense of the quality of child care.<br />
After all some, children's hospitals are multi-storey and<br />
children live in high rise apartments. In addition to<br />
attempting to facilitate employers wanting to use their<br />
own premises to provide child care my Government is<br />
prepared to offer a range of tax deductions and<br />
depreciation provisions to employers who make child care<br />
available. We have recently announced that this will<br />
not be treated as fringe benefits for taxation purposes.<br />
Finally, perhaps the most consistent complaint of<br />
employers during the Pilot Program was the existence of<br />
a range of legislative, r1~ tryor<br />
on w'.,' ren's<br />
ilJCabl. 0 Lo womnen Ldncv ai Lce~ ic-U1t. </p>
<p>Perhaps the most contentious of these restrictions are<br />
the State laws prohibiting women from lifting more than<br />
16 kilograms in weight.<br />
It is our intention to convene a special conference of<br />
unions, employers, State Governments and other<br />
interested parties to examine and make recommendations<br />
in respect of legislative, regulatory or award<br />
restrictions. I hope that as a reSuIt Of thiS<br />
Conferernce we can reach agreement on how to ensure that<br />
no law in this country stands in the way of women doing<br />
whatever job for which they are qualified.<br />
In my view, many employers are already acting in a<br />
responsible and enlightened fashion and tonight's award<br />
is timely recognition of this.<br />
I am now very happy to announce the winners of the 1985<br />
BPW Advance Australia Award.<br />
it has been decided to make two awards this year, one to<br />
an organisation and one to an outstanding individual.<br />
Each award recognises a unique contribution made by the<br />
winners to encouraging the employment of women in areas<br />
where in the past they would not have been employed.<br />
The Organisation Winner of the 1985 Award is the Greater<br />
Newcastle Building Society.<br />
The Individual Winner is the Chairman and Chief<br />
Executive of Esso Australia Limited, Mr J. F. Kirk.<br />
The Greater Newcastle Building Society has women at all<br />
three levels of its management. Its Chairman is<br />
Professor Beryl Nashar and it is the only major<br />
corporation in Australia with a woman as Chairman.<br />
At the middle level, one of its two Regional Managers is<br />
a woman. And at the lower level of management women<br />
manage a significant number of the Building Society's<br />
Branches. In Newcastle itself there are 13 women<br />
managers of 24* Branches. I am advised that the present<br />
ratio of men to women throughout the industry is 2 to 1.<br />
The Greater Newcastle Building Society has gone against<br />
the trend and has recognised the talents and skills of<br />
women. I think it is particularly significant that<br />
Australia ' s rapidly expanding finance sector should be a<br />
first winner of this award.<br />
Mr Jim Kirk, the winner of the Individual Award is well<br />
known for his pioneering contribution in introducing<br />
Affirmative Action principles to Esso Australia at a<br />
