PRIM MIINISTER'S VISIT TO U. S. AND U. K.<br />
News Coi-ferencc given by the PrimoL . iister. r.<br />
Harold Holt, at the ' aldorf-Astoria Hotel,<br />
New York. July, 1966.<br />
MR. HOLT2: Ladies and Gentlemen, I am not proposing to make any<br />
special statements of policy. WVhen this gathering was mooted<br />
and we were discussing the arrangements in Canberra it was<br />
thought that it might provide a useful round-up opportunity,<br />
particularly for our own Australian press and for any others<br />
sufficiently interested to come alongi I an largely in your<br />
hands and I think that would be the best way to go about our<br />
business if I could turn it over to you for any queries you<br />
might wish to put to me,<br />
Following are the questions then put to the Prime<br />
Minister and his replies:-<br />
Q. vvhat likelihood is there of any immediate increase in<br />
the number of A ustralian troops to Viet Nam?<br />
MR. HOLT: The Australian situation is that Australia is<br />
represented as you may know at a number of different points<br />
in South East Asia. , ie are in Malaysia. , ie are in Ubon in<br />
Thailand. / iea re in both West Malaysia and Borneo. At the time<br />
when the task force component was worked out that fitted in with<br />
the phasing which had been decided for the buildup of our own<br />
regular forces. 4e need many of the regular arrmy people for use<br />
in training the expansion of our military forces. So far as we<br />
have decided the matter, that is the Australian contribution,<br />
and there is no proposal before me that this should be increased.<br />
Q. , ill Australians be released from Malaysia for service<br />
in Viet Nam<br />
MR. HOLT: Service in Malaysia and South Viet Nam is, of course,<br />
rotational it's not just the one group of fellows they have<br />
to be rotated after their tour of duty.<br />
Q. Might some of those serving be transferred to Viet Nam?<br />
MR. HOLT: You mean those in Australia?<br />
Q. No, sir, those released from Malaysia might they<br />
be transferred to Viet Nam?<br />
MR. HOLT: 4e have yet to see how soon they can be released because<br />
I do not regard the issue there as being settled sufficiently<br />
for us to make any significant transfer of forces, but we are<br />
going ahead with our normal movements there subject to further<br />
discussions which might arise as the position clarifies, itself. </p>
<p>What is the Australian Government's attitude towards<br />
the bombing of Hanoi and Haiphong?<br />
MR. HOLT 77e mad~ e it quite clear-that V~ c &amp;, ccopted the judZ ment<br />
that this wis a military necessity I immediately spoke to that<br />
effect in Wvashington and since then my colleagues in Canberra<br />
have confirmed that view.<br />
Q. Earlier today you appeared to critise the handling of<br />
news of the w--ar in Viet Nam. WIould you amplify this please?<br />
MR. HOLT: All Administrations get their share of criticism. No,<br />
I was pointing to the unfortunate consequences I saw of inadequate<br />
presentations. No one objects to criticism provided it is<br />
balanced in the complete coverage of news presentation but is has<br />
seemed to me that the emphasis in the daily reporting here is<br />
understandably on the more dramatic, episodic events. There has<br />
been very little presentation of the raore constructive side of<br />
activities in South Viet Nam itself. From my own knowledge of<br />
them and as I was informed while in South Viet Nam, all the<br />
military forces there are including in their progranu--es civic<br />
action, rural development and village policies. All these are<br />
aimed at assisting the villagers. MLeore significant is the growth<br />
of co-operation amrong the various countries of South East Asia<br />
which have felt the cormaunist threat either, as in the case of<br />
South Korea, in resisting actual aggression or, as in the Thailand<br />
of today, responding to the or essaur's which might produce<br />
infiltration or disturbance inside that country. W, e have been<br />
strengthened and given time in which to build our economil. s,, and<br />
build our defences as a result of the American participation in<br />
South Viet Nam. This, I think, has been inadequately recognised<br />
so far. 1V understand you have invited President Johnson to<br />
visit Australia. Can you tell us his reply?<br />
DIR. HOLT: I get the impression he would like to do this but he<br />
has not been able to indicate anything specific to me. The<br />
invitation is Open and he would be welcome at any time.<br />
Q. Do you consider the bombing of installations in Hanoi<br />
and Haiphong dangerous?<br />
121. HOLT: I do not look on it as seriously as you seem to imply<br />
because I think it is a natural consequence if you are involved<br />
in operations of w . ar. Of all installations I would have thought<br />
them one of the most obvious targets if you were to inhibit the<br />
activities of your enemy. This plan of action was very carefully<br />
thought out and very carefully rehearsed in order to cause the<br />
, minimum damage to the civilian community. The consideration<br />
which the United States has shown in these military operations<br />
goes beyond anything we knew in the second world war where titare<br />
were programmes of mass bombing of civilian communitics designed<br />
either to discourage cr destroy substantial elements of the<br />
civilian population. I think your own government has conducted<br />
itself with restraint, having regard to the ext~ nt of its<br />
involvement in the issue there. </p>
<p>Q. It is re orted that 112 Qonservatives in the British<br />
Parliament have signed a motion officially deploring Prime<br />
Minister Wilson's criticism of the Hanoi-Haiphong bombing<br />
calling it anl abandonment oi the U. S. and I quLote here<br />
11detriental to the safety of American, Australian and New<br />
Zealand troops." Do you wish to comment?<br />
MR. HOLT: No, I do not. I am looking forward to my talks with the<br />
Prime Minister. I am quite certain that that is the most<br />
satisfactory way of getting a clear indication of his own views.<br />
He has his probler,. s and 1 sh ). ll be interested to hear from hin<br />
what he can tell me about the British position.<br />
Q. There are reports that I believe have been published in<br />
Australia that Australian ground troops are going to be sent to<br />
Thailand. Can you tell us anything of this?<br />
MR. HOLT: I am not able to comiment on~ th-is. There are always in<br />
existence military plans directed at contingencies and I am not<br />
iire'n. red to coiment on 9ny ivirticular situatition. Tf we were to<br />
make a statemenLt on a matter of that sort it would be as a<br />
consequence of a Cabinet discussion and I am not here at this<br />
time to make policy statements for the government.<br />
Q. Are you going to discuss with Prime Minister vIilson the<br />
question of sending British troops to Viet Nam?<br />
MR. HOLT: I am not going to speculate on the area of discussion<br />
with Mr. Vdlson. I oto not think he would appreciate it and I<br />
would not appreciate it if somebody did that to me.<br />
Q. Not long ago the press here was subject to a different<br />
criticism of the Viet Nam coverage ' by the National Students<br />
Association. It sent three of its members to Viet Nam on a three<br />
weeks inspection trip. 14hen they returned they were concerned<br />
about the social and other effects of the American presence there.<br />
12. HOL: Well the first thing that struck me when I went to South<br />
Viet Nam was how different the spectacle and the atmosphere VW: rX from<br />
w., hat I would have believed to be the case from the day-to-day<br />
reporting of the episodes. For example in Saigon itself<br />
a city of ,, ore than 2 million people the citizens go about<br />
their occasions seemingly unperturbed or undisturbed by the fact<br />
that this is a theatre close to military operations and subject<br />
itself to some terrorist incidents. Quite obviousli you could<br />
not have something on the scale of American participation with<br />
a country of Viet Nam's limited size without there being some<br />
impact on cornmunity life. J.. ith an army force of this kind you<br />
get pressures on the price level and goods tend to becomescarce<br />
in some directions. There are frictions that build up<br />
between some members of the local community and those of the<br />
military force even if it is only the friction of the fellow who<br />
does not like to see his girl with a GI when he thinks she<br />
should be with him. had a very welcalie presence of Americans<br />
in Australia during the years of the second world war but it<br />
created a few social problems. Thuse things are inevitable but<br />
I did not myself find any atmosphere of resentment to this<br />
although there are political difficulties which have been well<br />
advertised. </p>
<p>The experience I had was one of appreciation for the American<br />
presence. Although political difficulties existed I did not<br />
encounter any atmosphere of anybody wanting to support the<br />
communists. They were agreed that the commnists had to be<br />
resisted and the major part the Arfericans were playing in<br />
producing this result was welcomed.<br />
Q. You have referred to the inadequate presentation by<br />
the American press of the Viet Nam war news.. uould you say the<br />
same criticism applied to the Australian press?<br />
lir. HOLT: It was not a gsreral refcrence I said that in soLie<br />
directions i found this to be the case. I am not a newspaper<br />
man and I never have been, but I have had enough to do with<br />
them over 30 years of public life to have a fair idea of what<br />
they regard as good copy and what they do not. As I said a<br />
little earlier in the day at lunch good news tends to be no news<br />
in the eyes of people who want to present the news in a way<br />
attractive to the readership. But that should not stand in the<br />
way of thoughtful, intelligent -Members of the comnunity setting<br />
about gettin. g the complete picture. Now I think the Europeans<br />
have not caught on to what is emerging in Asia. I think one of<br />
the great exciting stories of history is what is going to happen<br />
there over the next 30 to 40 years and the basis of friendsnip<br />
which is emerging among the countries which have felt themselves<br />
threatened by conmunist expansion. This is leading to cooperative<br />
efforts, to econolaic arrangements, which, taken<br />
together, are likely to have soae stimulating effect throughout<br />
Asia as a whole. That is why I put the point a little earlier<br />
today that thoughtful and intelligent Chinese seeing these things<br />
happen have got to make up their minds whether they modify their<br />
policy so as to be part of this process of economic growth or<br />
whether they are going to remain isolated from it and indeed even<br />
regard it as hostile, . e may be not far from some critical<br />
judgment from that quarter. They must be thinking hard about it.<br />
Q. Are the restrictions on the outfow of capital<br />
( inaudible)<br />
T. M. HOLT: Jeli, fortunately up till now-the volxe of capital<br />
inflow has been well sustained. On the last figures I saw it<br />
looked as though the fiscal year just concluded would have<br />
embraced a record capital inflow to the country. At the time<br />
I brought in the budget last year as Treasurer we thought there<br />
could be a decline as much as dollars Australian 200 million in<br />
our reserves and some commentators were putting the figure at<br />
dollars Australian 400 million and higher in the end result<br />
we got to about a break-even point. The latest figures might<br />
even show us to be up a little on the year. I think the<br />
figures I saw were for June 6 or 8 but they are the latest<br />
igures I have as of now. It was directly a product of an<br />
improved export return despite a drought affected year and the<br />
strength of capital inflow. I said earlier today that in V.<br />
experience if the bait is sufficiently attractive ( I won't<br />
say the fish coue to the bait, but) investuent capital comes<br />
to the attraction. I would confidentlY expect this capital<br />
inflow to be sustained becaLse wc are finding a growing interest.<br />
As I. mentioned earlier today, even sa-c of your own people are<br />
wanting to coae and settle with us. </p>
<p>Undoubtedly the interest arising out of some of these major<br />
projects is capturing the imagination of people who have<br />
inherited an American pioneer tradition.<br />
Q. ( Inaudible) About European aid for South-East Asia.<br />
MR. HOLT: I do not think that Western Europe generally is giving<br />
the assistance it should. There are some 324 countries that<br />
was the last count I had, giving material aid of one kind or<br />
another to South Vietnam. Some, of course, are providing<br />
military aid, but it is broadly true to say that I think the<br />
major effort has been left to the United States of America and<br />
if the United States of America were not doing the job, I do not<br />
think Western Europe could afford to neglect it. In other<br />
words, if we were using the blunt language to which Australians<br />
are sometimes alleged to be given it could be said that<br />
Western Europe is in effect " coasting" on the United States of<br />
America in South-East Asia.<br />
Q. Coasting?<br />
MR. HOLT: Coasting, yes. A sort of word that comes from Wild<br />
Colonial Boy.<br />
~~~ wthin Britain is going to reduce its forces East of Suez<br />
witinthe next few years what plans are you making to fill<br />
this gap?<br />
MR. HOLT: I think Mr. Wilson made his Government's position clear<br />
on that. The forces were built up to meet the confrontation<br />
situation in Malaysia. In Mr. Healey's defence paper and in<br />
subsequent statem. ents the British Government has made it clear<br />
that there would be some reduction of forces once the<br />
confrontation issue was disposed of. I am not stating these<br />
matters in any way that has not already been indicated by a<br />
spokesman for the United Kingdom Government.<br />
Q. ( Inaudible) About United Kingdom cotribution in<br />
South-East Asia.<br />
MR. HOLT: The United Kingdom, as is well known to the United<br />
States, has played a large part in maintaining stability in<br />
South-East Asia. Great Britain had substantial forces thereeven<br />
at the pre-confrontation level they were substantial.<br />
It maintains the Naval Base in Singapore and it has<br />
permanent establishments at Butterworth and elsewhere. it<br />
has Naval Units, Air Force Units and so on. The British<br />
decision was to expand, I thint it was ZS2m. a year in that<br />
area, or that formed part of its planning. I think that<br />
figure is right, but I am drawing on my own recollection..<br />
I think this was after all what part of the argument was about<br />
in the recent dcebate in the Labor Party rooms.<br />
Q. Also inaudible on United Kingdom aid.<br />
MR. HOLT: Well, Britain is quite obviously making a substantial<br />
contribution not only in military sense but in international<br />
aid in various forms. There is a United Kingdom contribution,<br />
for example, to the Asian Development Bank. </p>
<p>I think... of-cottries of Western Europe I an not going to<br />
specify them-that were given the substanital American<br />
assistance that enabled them to get back on their feet<br />
economically after the second world war, and which I believe are<br />
not now carrying their share of the tremendous tasks ahead in<br />
helping to solve the problems facing what amounts to one half<br />
of the human race at the present time... and which will grow into<br />
a bigger proportion in the years ahead.<br />
Q. Are there any avenues for peace in Vietnam which to your<br />
way of thinking have not yet ' been explored?<br />
TMR. HOLT: First of all I believe that the United States Governmient<br />
has pursued every avenue that has come to its thinking. There<br />
have been attem~ pts by a variety of people in a variety of ways and<br />
none of them have so far produced even the slightest encouragement<br />
that a negotiation is likely to occur. As Minister for Labour,<br />
I had many years negotiating with commiunist-led unions and I<br />
have watched since the time of the Berlin Airlift and before, the<br />
way in which co,-imaunists conduct themselves. You sometimes find,<br />
you know, that even when you are in what seems to be a complete<br />
impasse that when they colae to their decision that it is time to<br />
do something about it without regard to logic or to consistency<br />
or what has been said previously, you can get a sudden and quite<br />
dr'amatic switch in the position which had been formerly taken up.<br />
If the communists come to the conclusion that they are backing a<br />
loser by pursuing their present lines of policy thnen I do not<br />
think they wo. lid be too much troubled by whCet had been said<br />
previously in changing their policy.<br />
Q. Are you optimistic for the iimediate future?<br />
1, R. HOLT: I ama always optimistic No, I am not expressing any<br />
early optimism about this. I say it is unpredictable really<br />
but on the way that trends are developing I would say it was<br />
becoming increasingly costly to the future of the corimunist<br />
world to persist with the belligerent and non-co-operative<br />
attitude, that ' Sall. I say that measuring the pluses and<br />
minuses, I think there is an accumulating evidence that the<br />
debits are outweighing whatever credits they feel that they might<br />
be gaining from it. I mean the situation in Africa, the<br />
situation in Asia, the spectacle of the free world going more rapidly<br />
ahead with economic development all these, I think, are factors<br />
which mst be making the cormmunist leadership think hard about<br />
where they are going.<br />
Q. I would like to get back to press coverage... you left<br />
the impression that outside of the European press that there is<br />
no intelligent, thoughtful reporting. Is that what your<br />
impression is?<br />
' MR. HOLT: Not from the press generally. I thought in " ashington<br />
we had a good coverage from the press aidd the points I was<br />
trying to make about the significant developments in South East<br />
Asia were well taken up there. V'le had, I thought, a reasonable<br />
press coverage in San rancisco but it has not been so easy to<br />
get that story across in New York. As I mentioned earlier<br />
today I have seen several stories in which space has been given<br />
to the banner holders without mauch space being given to those<br />
who are trying to point up the encouraging or positive<br />
developments in South East Asia. </p>
<p>1AR. EGGLETON: Mr. Rayment would you like to put your question<br />
again please. I do not think the Prime Minister quite got<br />
the point you were trying to bring out about the coverage<br />
of the news in Viet Nam.<br />
MR. RAYMENT: ( New York Times) Did I take it that you said you<br />
regarded the European press as having a sounder itpproach to<br />
the Viet Nan war coverage?<br />
MR. HOLT: Oh, No, No, I'm not putting that, I think probably<br />
there is less space given in the European press to what I<br />
call the positive and constructive aspects of what is<br />
happening, not only in Viet Nam one of my criticisms is<br />
that too much concentration is being given to what's<br />
happening in Viet Nam to the exclusion or comparative<br />
exclusion of these quite significant developments. What<br />
happened the other da~ y in Seoul was a very significant<br />
development with nine countries getting together there from<br />
around the area running from South Korea, Taiwan, the<br />
Philippines, Thailand and Australia, New Zealand, Japan,<br />
Malaysia this is all sufficiently novel, I think, to be<br />
newsworthy. The Asian Development Bank itself this is a<br />
product of Asian initiative, not the United States, and the<br />
bulk of the capital is being subscribed from within Asia.<br />
The Japanese providing or undertaking to provide a hundhed<br />
million dollars or credits for South Korea is a significant<br />
development. If these things could be interpreted as being<br />
products whether intentionally or otherwise of United States<br />
help in strengthening South East Asia, then the public,<br />
I think, would begin to realise that out of the complex,<br />
difficult, costly and rather confusing business going on in<br />
South Viet Nam there are dividends accruing in other<br />
directions. If you were not in South Viet Nan we would not<br />
be able to go ahead the way that we are. I feel it should<br />
bring encouragement to the people of this country to know that<br />
they are not just spending their money and the cost of lives<br />
fruitlessly. These things are producing a strengthening of<br />
the wtoLe Asian position. I thinI4 they will have some<br />
considerable impact on the way the world moves ahead. </p>
