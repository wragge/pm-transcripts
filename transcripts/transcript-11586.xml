 I am delighted to announce that the Federal Government</p>
<p> will provide $1million for the Solar Sailor project.<br />
   This money will support the construction and demonstration</p>
<p> of a Catamaran powered by solar and wind energy with compressed natural</p>
<p> gas as back-up.<br />
   It will represent leading edge technology. The solar</p>
<p> wing uses energy from the sun or wind separately or in combination.<br />
   It represents the potential to travel on our waterways</p>
<p> and oceans in a clean, environmentally friendly manner.<br />
   Australia has a proud record of exporting leading edge</p>
<p> marine technology and Solar Sailor represents an exciting new direction.<br />
   The development of this technology is a credit to the</p>
<p> people involved and is the latest evidence of the innovation and potential</p>
<p> that exits in regional Australia. In this instance, the people of Ulladulla</p>
<p> and surrounding regions stand to reap the benefits of this exciting development.<br />
   The Federal Government is determined to promote the growth</p>
<p> of new and innovative industries in the regions. The money for the Solar</p>
<p> Sailor represents another step in this plan by helping to underpin an</p>
<p> exciting new industry in this region.<br />
