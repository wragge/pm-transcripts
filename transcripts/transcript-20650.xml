    <content><![CDATA[<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well ladies and gentlemen I'd like on behalf of the Australian Government to express my shock and dismay and my very deep condolences to the United States for the tragic accident of the space shuttle Colombia. I especially convey our sympathy to the families left saddened and bereaved by the loss of their loved ones. I also convey my particular condolences to the people of India and Israel whose nationals were part of the space shuttle team. Space exploration is a great universal endeavour and the United States in particular has carried it forward on behalf of all mankind. And we therefore feel particularly for those involved in the space effort in that country.</p>
<p>We're also reminded that the shuttle was carrying an experiment designed by some Melbourne schoolchildren which carries on the very long tradition of Australian interest in and involvement in space exploration. The United States in different ways has suffered a number of adversities in recent times, I'm quite sure that the spirit of that country will ensure that despite this setback space exploration goes on undaunted.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, how did you hear of the news this morning?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I saw it on the early morning news, I wake early and I flicked on BBC World and I saw it on that, I saw the pictures.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>And your immediate...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I was like everybody else, because of the graphic on the spot pictures it leaves a greater impression than if you just read it in a newspaper or you hear a report after you've been told that it's actually happened.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister on another issue if you don't mind.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>The anti-terrorism brochure (inaudible) the brochure might cause alarm amongst the general public?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No I don't, I think the brochure will be well received by the public and the reason I think that it will well received by the public is that it goes into some practical examples, it does what people said a few weeks ago we had to do and that is to actually give people useful information. Australians are very balanced, savvy people. They know there's a problem, they also know that they shouldn't get unduly alarmed or upset. They want the Government to set the tone and then provide some information. And that is exactly what we've done. I think it's exactly what the public wants.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Have you been happy with how the national security hotline's been going?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>So far yes. People understand that we have to have a balanced approach, people understand we have to put more money into defence, we've got to put more money into security, we've got to be more alert but we've got to get on with our lives, they want a bit of practical advice and this booklet which has been very carefully put together contains practical advice from the experts, the people who know and it draws on the experience of other countries and most Australians will think that is what their Government should be doing.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>The Greens have accused you of political opportunism alongside it and (inaudible) scaring exercise.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yeah I think I've heard that before.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, Tony Blair and George W Bush had their meeting the other night, they seem to be indicating they would maybe be pushing towards a second resolution for the United Nations, is that something you'd be looking for?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes we would support very strongly efforts to get a second resolution. Clearly if you get a second resolution and you get everybody together in unison, unambiguously saying the same thing to Iraq you are more likely in those circumstances to get a peaceful outcome than if the world, I'll start that again, you are more likely in those circumstances to get a peaceful outcome than if the world is disunited, divided and ambiguous. So if you are concerned about finding the real hope, slim though it may appear on occasions, of a peaceful outcome, that's more likely to result from a unanimous Security Council resolution strongly reinforcing the message of 1441 than from some kind of blurred, fudged at the edge response.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Do you think the military commitment by the United States and Australia and other nations in the Persian Gulf is sending a strong message and that Saddam is listening to that?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well Kofi Annan thinks it is. The Secretary General of the United Nations said that he didn't believe that the weapons inspectors would be in Iraq if it hadn't been for the American military build-up. Now that's not George Bush or John Howard or Tony Blair, that's Kofi Annan, the Secretary General of the United Nations. I rest my case on that point.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Do you expect many of your Liberal colleagues or perhaps supporters (inaudible) John Valder's Liberals Against a War in Iraq?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I'm a Liberal against war, I happen to believe that the best way to prevent greater long term danger and suffering for mankind is to take steps now to prevent the spread of chemical and biological weapons.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>The group is specifically against war on US unilateral action.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well our position is to pursue an outcome through the Security Council. And we're working towards that and I believe that if we can get a resolution from the Security Council then that is more likely than anything else to bring about a peaceful outcome.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>And this group wants parliamentary debate on the topic, could you see yourself going along with that in the future?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I've already indicated not long ago that there'd be plenty of parliamentary debate.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Before you commit troops to Iraq?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>We've already had parliamentary debate and there'll be a lot more too.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>The Democrats yesterday made a comment that they believe that the United States might be looking at using nuclear weapons in Iraq. What were your thoughts...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well that's already been ruled out by the United States. Ruled out.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>So their claims are baseless?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well they've got to say something, you've got to dream up a new allegation each day.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister on the brochure, with the release of it is there any new threat facing the Australian public, what is the actual threat?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well you remember before Christmas there was a generalised warning of possible terrorist attacks in Australia. There has been no new specific information that's come to our notice since then that would justify a change or an upgrading to that. But it's because of that and because of the experience of Bali and prior to that the experience of the 11th of September that we've done what we've done. In a sense a government in our position is damned if it does and damned if it doesn't If we do nothing we are criticised for not educating the public, if we provide information the Greens and the Democrats and the Labor Party say we're scaring everybody. In the end with all of these things you have to do what you think is right and we think it is right because of the changed circumstances of the world to try and in a reassuring way remind people that we are living in a different environment. And the world has changed since the 11th of September and since Bali and we have to understand that, that is relevant to the fight against terrorism, it's relevant to the spread of weapons of mass destruction because sooner or later if we don't do something about both they will come together with rather terrifying consequences for mankind.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Opposition Leader Simon Crean is saying that the $10 million should be being spent on luggage screening.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well you can do both and we are doing both and it's the right thing to do both. We are screening the luggage, and we're also providing a very effective education campaign. And a prudent good government does both. Thank you.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, just quickly, your Cabinet's meeting tomorrow, what will they be discussing?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>All sorts of things.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Can you give us an idea of what is on the agenda?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, I don't normally disclose the agenda.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Perhaps the ASIO bill which was blocked?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I don't normally talk about the agenda. Okay.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
