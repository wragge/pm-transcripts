TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING, MP<br />
INTERVIEW WITH PAUL LYNEHAM, 7.30 REPORT, 25 MAY 1994<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
PL: Prime Minister, welcome again to the program.<br />
PM: Thank you, Paul.<br />
PL: Now, Alexander Downer says you are a fast money man. Has he got a<br />
point?<br />
PM: Well, that's come from his view of the world. If it is not old money, it has<br />
to be fast money. And, if it is fast money it is not proper money.<br />
PL: There's not much difference in the end though, is there?<br />
PM: I mean, God knows what he thinks of John Hewson. If he thinks that fast<br />
money is improper. I mean, this is all part of the b'orn to rule squad. I<br />
noticed in yesterday's Australian, the front page, " I am born to the Liberal<br />
Party, and I am a creature of the Liberal Party." In other words, I am born<br />
to rule the rest of the you. Because, what we have seen here is basically<br />
a take over by the old Fraser Staley gang, this is a return, as Gerard<br />
Henderson said, it looks like a return to the fifties.<br />
PL: But it doesn't matter whether it is new money, old money, or what sort of<br />
money. The fact is, most of the people at the top in Australian politics,<br />
yourself included, are quite wealthy. Wouldn't we be better just getting off<br />
on that basis?<br />
PM: No, it has got nothing to do with that. He came on saying I had made a<br />
personal attack upon him. Where in fact, I had repeated Dr Hewson's </p>
<p>remarks about the mode of his selection by the Melbourne political and<br />
business establishment at the Melbourne Club.<br />
PL: Now, this was Dr Hewson's comment last Friday night. As a matter of fact<br />
we have got that, let's just have a look at that now.<br />
JH: " It is a very important issue, this ballot. Because the issue is the future of<br />
the Liberal Party, and the Party now has a very clear choice between a<br />
Party that would be very broad based and inclusive of all Australians, and<br />
a Party that will be run by the Melbourne Club."<br />
PL: Ok, run by the Melbourne Club. But that is just political rhetoric.<br />
PM: No. The Melbourne Club is an attitude. It is about an attitude, it is about<br />
the political establishment of the Victorian Liberal Party, always hankering<br />
after control of the party again, resenting the fact that it had what they<br />
thought was a Johnny-come-lately from NSW. The point I made was that<br />
Mr Downer has actually gone to the Melbourne Club, Mr Wooldridge tells<br />
us that he had to learn his fate from the head waiter, that all these heavy<br />
weights had decided his fate, Dr Hewson's fate, in Melbourne. I made<br />
that reference, then he said this was an unprovoked personal attack to<br />
which then he refers to my house in Elizabeth Bay, which by the way<br />
doesn't have scintillating harbour views, it is just an inner city terrace, and<br />
investments I have made et cetera. I made one 22 years after I joined the<br />
Parliament.<br />
PL: But look, in the past..<br />
PM: Let me just make this point, Paul. The fact of the matter is I made a<br />
political remark about Mr Downer, and the political remark was a repeat of<br />
the very remark you have just shown your viewers by John Hewson. Dr<br />
John Hewson and Dr Wooldridge's fate were decided by the heavy<br />
people. By Malcolm Fraser, by Mr Staley. First of all Mr Downer had to<br />
do an interview with Mr Kennett, then he was taken to the Melbourne Club<br />
and put through the paces by Mr Staley. Mr Peacock was interviewed<br />
saying, Yes he supports Dr Hewson, the next day, denying Dr Hewson, he<br />
climbs into a Rollsroyce with Ron Walker, the Treasurer of the Liberal<br />
Party, and mover and shaker in the Victorian Liberal apparatus and<br />
business establishment. They are the people who decided to make<br />
Alexander Downer Leader of the Liberal Party. I was simply making that<br />
point.<br />
PL: You say the Melbourne Club is an attitude, they are his wealthy backers.<br />
But, I mean people would say the ACTU is an attitude and they are your<br />
wealthy backers. $ 10 million dollars at the last election. </p>
<p>PM: Well, he could have made that political point, but he didn't. He made a<br />
personal attack upon me.<br />
PL: But you have made personal attacks in the past. You never called him<br />
Shirley Temple?<br />
PM: I don't talk about their personal assets.<br />
PL: Who called him Shirley Temple?<br />
PM: Look, he has had fifty warnings from the Speaker to behave himself in<br />
Parliament. But let me just about the Melbourne Club, Paul. It is a club<br />
of entrenched privilege and prejudice. Half the population of this country,<br />
women, are excluded from being members there. Mr Downer belongs to<br />
the Adelaide Club, half the population of this country, women, are<br />
excluded from being members there. And, I think at least one thing<br />
should happen between now and when he stands up to lead a major party<br />
in the Parliament next week, he should resign his position from the<br />
Adelaide Club on the basis that in 1994, not 1984, or 1894, no leader of a<br />
party that wants to be Prime Minister of this country should be a member<br />
of a club that will not have women as members.<br />
PL: So, you have put the political heat back on him. But look, that suit you're<br />
wearing right now would feed an average, the money you spent on that<br />
would feed a family for a couple of months. I mean this is an absurd<br />
argument when we get down to your richer than me, and you know, you<br />
are new money, no, I am old money.<br />
PM: No, but that is him, that is not me. I am simply making this point, I said<br />
that the interests of the wealthy people of the Melbourne Liberal<br />
establishment who chose him and selected him, and shifted Andrew<br />
Peacock and his handful of votes to make the difference. Their interests<br />
and the interests of a boiler maker in Footscray, or a cabinet maker in<br />
Fairfield in Sydney, or in Brisbane, are completely in contrast to one<br />
another. They wouldn't even give them a thought over a warm gin this<br />
crowd. And that was the point I was making. This notion that we have<br />
gone back to a fresh start, Malcolm Fraser has never been so happy. I've<br />
never seen Malcolm so joyous since 1983.<br />
PL: Many of these Cabinet..<br />
PM: He has finally got his way, he has got the Party Alexander Downer has<br />
said ' Malcolm Fraser is a great man'. This is the man who gave us seven<br />
years of political waste. Seven years of wasted political time in Australia's </p>
<p>post-war economic adjustment. What we're going back to is back to<br />
Malcolm Fraser type policies.<br />
PL: Many of these tradesman you evoke, these so-called ordinary Australian<br />
battling families would like to point the finger at you and say you've given<br />
it to them damn tough.<br />
PM: We gave them between 1983 and 1993 1.675 million extra jobs; we gave<br />
them an increase in household disposable income in every year that the<br />
Government was in office.<br />
PL: And crash landing in 1989.<br />
PM: Well, just hang on. We gave them a health insurance system which<br />
means that they or their families can get sick and not be afraid of it; we've<br />
given them an aged care system and a social security system which is the<br />
envy of any in the world; when we became the Government only 3 kids in<br />
completed secondary school, now it is 8 in 10 we've given their<br />
children an education.<br />
PL: And over 900,000 unemployed right now, Prime Minister?<br />
PM: Yes, and we've got a White Paper there, we've got 4.5 per cent growth, 2<br />
per cent inflation. Could you imagine<br />
PL: And business investment just gone back 5 per cent in the March quarter.<br />
PM: I'll come to quarterly figures in a moment Paul. As you know, they dance<br />
around all the time. Could you imagine this crowd, this new group<br />
producing the White Paper? Could you imagine them worrying about<br />
whether the kids under 18 are personally case managed back into<br />
education and into work? Could you imagine them worrying about a job<br />
compact for the long term unemployed? And yet they'll put themselves<br />
up. This was never a contest about ideas or policies, it was only about<br />
who could sell the Liberal party's philosophy.<br />
PL: But isn't he selling well, he's got under you skin. You've come here, you<br />
are on the rise?<br />
PM: No, no, I will just bat the ball back where ever I see it. When I became<br />
Prime Minister, I said what I would do. I sat down at the press conference<br />
and said where I would take the country. Before I became Prime Minister,<br />
I said that fiscal policy needed to be expanded, we had to make the<br />
linkages into Asia, I mentioned the countries. Not one specific policy the<br />
other night. </p>
<p>PL: He says he's got a document coming out in a month or two. Now, you've<br />
got to give him a bit of time don't you?<br />
PM: For the business community this is just going to be a horror show. This is<br />
just going to be a blancmange. Could you image this group removing<br />
exchange controls, floating the Australian dollar, knocking the tariff wall<br />
over, recasting the tax system, introducing the kind of labour market<br />
programs; the micro economic economy, water, electricity, gas, could you<br />
imagine this coming from this group who want, what did they say their<br />
policies are? A broad church and social stability'.<br />
PL: Commonsense policy not bound by ideology or sectional interest'. In<br />
other words, that's going to appeal to a lot of people.<br />
PM: What that says is, we haven't had commonsense policy from Dr Hewson,<br />
we are having commonsense policy from now.<br />
PL: You said the other day that you never underestimate anybody. How do<br />
you really estimate Downer as an opponent?<br />
PM: I think, it is the Liberal party, I mean, for the business community and for<br />
the broader Australian community who knows Australia must continue to<br />
keep changing, must continue to make the break to Asia, this is a leader<br />
who would deny the full expression of Australian sovereignty, this is a<br />
leader who has a great question mark hanging over multicultural ism and<br />
immigration, this is a leader who would take his party back to the policies<br />
of Malcolm Fraser and that is basically, back to the kind of society and the<br />
kind of attitudes which just about broke us.<br />
PL: Well, he is doing pretty good if you look at the Saulwick poll this morning.<br />
59 per cent of voters believe Downer will improve the Liberals chances<br />
and they have given him a nine point lead over you as preferred Prime<br />
Minister.<br />
PM: And they gave him a 20 point lead over the Government. In other words<br />
the Saulwick poll this morning gave the Coalition a 20 point lead over the<br />
Government. This is the Government with 4 per cent economic growth, 2<br />
per cent inflation, 250,000 jobs, a White Paper.<br />
PL: But, it is not all first night euphoria.<br />
PM: No, just a second, a strong Budget performance, a decade of reform and<br />
on one nights election the Liberal party jumps 20 points in front of the<br />
Government... Well, Paul, if you believe that poll and let me tell you </p>
<p>there are plenty of people in the gallery who believed Saulwick polls in<br />
the election campaign, much to their chagrin if you believe in that you'll<br />
believe in anything.<br />
PL: I believe, for what it's worth, that he's going to do a lot better for the<br />
Liberal Party, in the months ahead, than John Hewson was doing in the<br />
months before and that that puts them ahead of you.<br />
PM: Any change from Dr Hewson's position where he was rejected at the last<br />
election, and his views and that negative approach he took to the job,<br />
would be in the honeymoon though I'm not here to spoil the happy<br />
honeymoon, Paul, I'm just here simply to make the point...<br />
PL: Oh, is that right?<br />
PM: I'm not here really, to spoil it. I want them to have their full enjoyment, as<br />
long as they understand that this country is not going to go backwards to<br />
the fifties as Mr Henderson said, to the seventies under Malcolm<br />
Fraser and Staley, of having it run by people who don't understand the<br />
broader society, as these Melbourne establishment people do not this<br />
country is not going to want the country run in that way from that place<br />
and the Government's policies of reform and change, of the White Paper,<br />
of the Budget, of the shift into Asia, of the Republic, of all of these things,<br />
of Mabo, this is the direction of Australia. It is not to go backwards. This<br />
is not a fresh change, this is basically back to the past.<br />
PL: Is it politically smart though, for you to be overseas early next month, for<br />
about 11 days celebrating D-Day?<br />
PM: Well, I was invited by President Mitterand of France and the British Prime<br />
Minister and one can hardly refuse the invitation in the terms in which it<br />
was put when we were participants in the second World War.<br />
PL: And, finally, those investment figures, backwards five per cent in the<br />
March quarter. That's not good.<br />
PM: In the year to now they are on track with the Budget forecast, Paul.<br />
PL: But, you've got to get one per cent growth this financial year. At the<br />
moment you are running minus at 1.7 per cent so you've got to do about<br />
2.7 per cent in the June quarter to get to that target and then you've got to<br />
get to fourteen and a half next financial year... and, you're on target for<br />
all of this, are you? </p>
<p>PM: Yes, and we've got realisation factors in there, on this data, well below the<br />
actual outcomes in the last ten years. So, as the Treasurer said<br />
eloquently, today, in a press statement, these numbers fall squarely into<br />
the Budget forecast.<br />
PL: Because, I don't need to tell you, upon that investment depends the<br />
growth and the jobs and your whole White Paper strategy.<br />
PK: Well, you look at the eighties changes and these are very conservative<br />
forecasts, I think everyone has accepted that. And, as I say, they are on<br />
track. The key point to remember, Paul, is this the average growth of<br />
the Western world economies is one per cent this year. We're already<br />
doing four per cent and heading to four and a half.<br />
PL: Thanks for your time<br />
PM: Thank you, Paul.<br />
