JOURNALIST: inaudible<br />
PM: You'll excuse me laughing but from day one in this<br />
dispute Mr Peacock and the Opposition is totally supportive<br />
of the pilots. They've put all their questions in the<br />
Parliament, everything they've said has been supportive of<br />
the pilots which is in a sense not surprising because the<br />
pilots are following the Opposition's industrial relations<br />
policy. The Opposition says, ' opt out of the system, if you<br />
want to go out, get outside', so that's what the pilots did<br />
straight according to the Opposition's policy. They've gone<br />
outside the system then Peacock's been bleating saying, ' fix<br />
it up, fix it up, fix it up', after they've got out, as he<br />
told them to and now of course he says he* ll go and talk to<br />
them. Well I think that*' s appropriate because they've been<br />
talking one another's language, following one another's<br />
policy all this time, they really deserve one another.<br />
