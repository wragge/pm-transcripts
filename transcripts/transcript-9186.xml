M PRIME MINISTER<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P. J. KEATING, MP<br />
KANCIIANAUUR! WAR CEMETERY, THAILAND, 9 APRIL 1994<br />
Tis place honours those who died on the Burma-Thailand Railway. It reminds us of<br />
the worst of which humanity is capable, and the best.<br />
Almost one in five of the thirteen thousand Australians who worked on the Railway<br />
died. With them also died thousands of men from Great Britain, Burma, New Zealand,<br />
Malaya, Java, India, The Netherlands and Thailand.<br />
Although they wcrc criminally mistreated and denied their rights under international<br />
convention, those from the allied nations died as prisoners of war. The vast majority<br />
of those from Asia upwards of throc hundred thousand of them died as slaves.<br />
To visit lilifire Pass and see the scale of the work men were driven to do is to be<br />
reminded that the task itself was inhuman.<br />
When we are told of the speed with which it was done, the hours the men worked, the<br />
disease they suffered and the brutality and sadism that they endured, we begin to<br />
understand why the Burma-Thailand railway ranks among the most evil acts of World<br />
Wa' II.<br />
The images of our countrymen returning from those camps gaunt and debilitated<br />
remain in the minds of every Australian who ever saw them. The knowledge of what<br />
was done to them remains as shocking now as it was when it was first revealed almost<br />
fifty years ago.<br />
It is not because those inhuman acts can in any way be excused or forgotten that we<br />
have come now to think less about the cruelty and more about the means men found to<br />
endurc it and to help thcir comrades endure it.<br />
The Burma-Thailand Railway has become one of those episodcs in our history from<br />
which we havc chosen to draw inspiration. It has become a legend of courage,<br />
comradeship, sacrifice and resourcefulness. iFi i~ 0t~ 0 SOooOoooooo, .1BJ </p>
<p>And we have come to recognise tliat these qualitics were embodied in one man, Sir<br />
Edward Ernest " Weary" Dunlop. the soldier and doctor whose remarkable bravcr'and<br />
skill saved so many lives, eased so much suffering and, when it was so desperately<br />
needed, inspired so much faith,<br />
No Australian of his generation is more universally admired than Weary Dunlop, and it<br />
is our duty to make sure that Australians of fuature generations know what he did and<br />
understand the greatnec-s of it.<br />
When we teach his story there is one great theme we should not neglect his great<br />
respect and affection for the Thai people.<br />
We should remember, as he always did, that were it not for their assistance<br />
exemplified in the deeds of his great friend, Boon Pong the lives of countless more<br />
Australian and Allied prisoners of war would have been lost.<br />
From the war's end until his death last year, " Weary" Dunlop returned the friendship by<br />
working to improve thc standard of medicine in Thailand and to deepen understanding<br />
between our two countries.<br />
It is worth remembering that Australia's first major engagement with Asia was in war.<br />
In Korea and Malaya aind Vietnam it was again war.<br />
Today it is a partnership with Thailand and other countrics of the region. A<br />
partnership which will extend the domnain of our common interest and reduce the<br />
ground for conflict.<br />
It seems to me that there could be no better way to honour those Australians who<br />
suffered and died here than to succeed in this enterprise. No better way to see that<br />
what they endured, and what their allies and hundreds of thousands from the countries<br />
of Asia endured, will not happen again.<br />
Tomorrow I go to Victnam. The Australians who fought and died there have been<br />
justly honoured in Australia as those who were here have been honoured, and for thle<br />
same reasons for the sacrifice they made, the faith they showed.<br />
In Vietnam the lesson is the same. The wounds have to be healed. The terrible legacy<br />
of the past must not cripple future generations.<br />
We must never forgct, but for the sake of future generations and in the name of those<br />
who died, the memory should not hold us back) but inspire us to find the way to peace<br />
and friendship, justice and prosperity.<br />
The best lesson we can draw from this place is that here we saw the best in ourselves. </p>
