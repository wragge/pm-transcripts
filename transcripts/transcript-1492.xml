FOR PRESS P. M. No. 18/ 1967<br />
VIET NAM INCIDENT<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister, Mr. Harold Holt<br />
The Government and the people of New Zealand are,<br />
I know, sharing the sadness of Australia in our loss of brave young men<br />
from this tragic mishap occurring in the stir of a close military<br />
operation. But as we mourn these losses, we remember with<br />
gratitude that the men of our two countries have combined many times<br />
with a success achieved by their skill, courage and comradeship.<br />
The bereaved and the injured have the sympathy of the<br />
Governments and peoples of both our countries.<br />
MOUNT COOK,<br />
NEW ZEALAND.<br />
7th February, 1967. </p>
