    <content><![CDATA[<p>I am pleased to announce that His Royal Highness Prince William will visit Australia from 19 - 21 January 2010, travelling to Sydney and Melbourne.</p>
<p>Prince William is visiting Australia after travelling to New Zealand to officially open the new Supreme Court in Wellington. The visit originated from a request to the Government of Australia by Prince William to visit the country so as to begin to get to know Australia and its people.</p>
<p>During his visit, Prince William will focus on his core interests of supporting Servicemen and women, helping young people fulfil their potential, and sustainable development in the light of climate change. The Prince will also use the visit to learn more about local Indigenous issues and visit the bushfire-ravaged countryside in Victoria.</p>
<p>Prince William will have the opportunity to meet a cross-section of Australians involved in a variety of projects of interest in both Sydney and Melbourne.</p>
<p>His Royal Highness will travel to Australia from New Zealand and then return to the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>Further details of the visit will be released closer to the time.</p>
<p>This will be the Prince's first visit to Australia as an adult, having previously been to this country with The Prince and Princess of Wales a year after his birth in 1983.</p>
