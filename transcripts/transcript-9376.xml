TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING<br />
RECEPTION FOR COMMONWEALTH GAMES ATHLETES<br />
AUSTRALIAN INSTITUTE OF SPORT, CANBERRA<br />
MONDAY 10 OCTOBER, 1994<br />
Thank you very much. It is a very great pleasure to be here in the AIS for this<br />
welcome home. One amongst many, I know, but one nevertheless very<br />
heartfelt. Because, for most of you this has been the place where that extra<br />
bit of tone and interest and commitment has made all the difference. But, it is<br />
a chance for us all to say directly, rather than through newspapers or motions<br />
in parliament, a simple thank you for the dedication and the commitment that<br />
you have shown, each of you, in representing this country with such<br />
distinction. I think all of us understand the enormous personal commitment<br />
an athlete makes to excellence that doggedness, that<br />
sustenance... sustaining power when your body is telling you to stop, when<br />
you're wondering about your life's choice when all those pressures are on<br />
you and you keep on going. And that is, I think, a mark of a champion and<br />
champions, It is, as Jim said, sport is about excellence, and it's about a celebration of<br />
beauty it's about a celebration of spirit and the human form. And it, I think,<br />
in that celebration, transmits so much to this country about what we are and<br />
what we have become. And no doubt, when you stand on the winning<br />
rostrum and you are saluted as Australians, it must run through your mind<br />
that you stand there representing the country and what it is, and I think that is<br />
we are proud of Australia, we're nationalists all of us, but fortunately<br />
nationalism has never got the better of us. And we have it in its proper place,<br />
but pride is always something that Australians deserve to hold dear, and one<br />
I know that if you are an Australian athlete comes by natural instinct by pure<br />
instinct.<br />
I want to say that I think it's a tremendously important thing for the<br />
Government to commit itself to Australian sport, because sport is so much of<br />
the ethos and culture of this country but beyond that it is a celebration of<br />
young Australians, of what most people in their youth are capable of. And<br />
even those not so youthful. But the fact is, I am delighted that we have been<br />
able to build all of us an Institute of this standing because, Jim said earlier, </p>
<p>TEL: iO. Oct. 94 17: 55 No. O1S-P. O2,<br />
2<br />
that I think the institute is an important body in world terms the fact is, there'<br />
is probably nothing better than this in the world. There may be things its<br />
equal, but there Is certainly nothing better. And it's a great tribute to the<br />
coaches, to the sport scientists, the support staff, arnd to the Director Deek<br />
for the tremendous job which the AIS has done on this occasion. I think<br />
something I've got some statistics here in the sports with an AIS program,<br />
87% of our medal winners were receiving or had received direct<br />
Commonwealth support from the AIS, and an overall two-thirds of the medal<br />
winners received direct AIS support. So, there are statistics, " statistics and<br />
damn statistics" as they say, but I think they are fairly compelling ones, so<br />
much that I think all of us in this room believe that they reflect the value of<br />
this effort. So, they are great results and let me congratulate you all again<br />
the AIS and the individual members of the team. And I know that with the<br />
Olympics coming up and the Olympic athlete program, which I announced on<br />
behalf of the Government, we are going to make just that extra special effort<br />
to bring our athletes... to give them that world competitive edge coming up to<br />
the 2000 Olympics.<br />
Now, I know a lot of you have had since the Games other welcomes home,<br />
other terrific performances around the world with the World Championships in<br />
other events, and while there is no particular welcome homes for that, let's<br />
congratulate you those of you who have been involved, particularly AIS<br />
sports men and women in those world championships, and those other<br />
events for which you have created world records in some cases.<br />
The main thing in all this is that what a great role model you are for young<br />
Australians. Now, I'm sure that everybody says that to you every time that<br />
one of these events are on, but that's true. And I think it's not just because<br />
you can excel at sport, or win a gold medal, but rather for your character and<br />
your personality. Because I think that if one goes back through the great<br />
sports men and women of this country, the thing that stuck by most of them<br />
and to us as a result is what fine people they have been, and what a great<br />
sense of joy their character has been to the country. And I know that when<br />
Lew Hoad died this year, I wrote to his wife saying how proud she must have<br />
been of Lew, and what a fine ambassador for Australia he had been. And I<br />
mentioned how Pete Sampras had said often that he was inspired by, and<br />
modelled himself, on great Australian players such as Lew Hoad and Rod<br />
Layer. He loved their style, their attitude and their manner the aura they<br />
gave, not simply the medal or the win. And I think that is the point. In fact,<br />
Jenny Hoad wrote me a very nice reply, and I'm sure she wouldn't mind me<br />
relating a little story in the letter she sent back. She said, Lew always felt<br />
totally Australian," and she told me a great story, ' When Low and Jenny had<br />
just married and were living in a housing commission flat in Sydney, the man<br />
living opposite approached Lew one night and told him his wife had just had a<br />
daughter, and would like Lew to be the Godfather, but they couldn't decide on<br />
what to call it. And Lew said, ' Well, I have just seen a great movie, and<br />
there's a good name in the film for a baby call it Shane." And she later<br />
became one of Australia's great sporting heroes Shane Gould. So, it just<br />
shows you that these sporting connections weave the most unlikely stories. </p>

But the fact of the matter Is that great sports people do become icons for the*<br />
country not simply sporting icons and the Low Hoads of this world and<br />
other great sports men and women obviously are going to do that as many<br />
of you are now doing. So, could I just say thank you most sincerely for your<br />
efforts in Victoria. It's a great pleasure, I'm sure, for Jim Ferguson and Deek,<br />
and all of the people in AIS who are committed to you, to see these efforts<br />
actually be rewarded, but most particularly, that of course would all go to<br />
nought if it weren't for your grit and determination that instinct to press on<br />
when a lot of things are telling you that time is up. And I think it is that<br />
leadership and that strength and courage, and that strength of conviction<br />
which we all salute. As Australians we all owe you a great debt this is our<br />
most successful Commonwealth Games ever and I am sure on behalf not<br />
simply of those in the ACT but on behalf of the nation in general thank you<br />
sincerely one and all for a great effort for Australia.<br />
ends. </p>
