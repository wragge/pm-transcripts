11, AUSTRA, L[ IA&amp;<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR PRESS 29 MAY 1979<br />
AUSTRAIJIA/ E . E BILATERAL<br />
TRADE NEGOTIATIONS<br />
I am pleased to announce to the House that today, a settlement<br />
has been reached on bilateral trade negotiations between<br />
Australia and the European Economic Community, held under the<br />
umbrella of the GATT round of MTN.<br />
Honourable Members will recall that Mr Anthony recently<br />
concluded trade agreements with United States of America and<br />
Japan and that these were signed last month.<br />
The negotiations with the E. E. C. now complete the MTN operations<br />
in relation to our three major trading partners. This agreement<br />
follows several months of intensive negotiations in Europe<br />
and meetings inCanberra over the-past two.<br />
days between the Minister for Special Trade Representations,<br />
Mr Garland, and the Vice President of the E. E. C. Commission,<br />
Mr F. 0. Gundelach.<br />
These discussions have resolved all of the outstanding issues<br />
related to a bilateral settlement between Australia and the E. E. C.<br />
in the context of the Multilateral Trade Negotiations. The<br />
final agreement however, will be subject to confirmation by the<br />
Australian Government and the E. E. C. Council of Ministers.<br />
This agreement will provide Australian exporters of agricultural<br />
commodities, especially beef and cheese, and industrial products,<br />
with improved marketing opportunities in the opportunities<br />
of a more favourable nature than we have enjoyed to date.<br />
In return, Australia has offered a number of concessions on<br />
agricultural and industrial items of interest to the Community.<br />
Mr Garland will shortly be making a statement on the broad outlines<br />
of this agreement and full details will be announced once the<br />
package has been endorsed by the Government and the E. E. C. Council<br />
of Ministers. 2/ </p>

I recall with some satisfaction that it was during my visit<br />
to Europe in mid 1977 that agreement was reached with the<br />
President of the EEC Commission, Mr. Roy Jenkins, to open<br />
high level trade discussions between Australia and the<br />
Community. This had followed personal representations I made to<br />
Mr. Jenkins and the heads of key EEC member governments<br />
regarding the serious and growing imbalance in the EEC's<br />
favour of trading opportunities with Australia, and the<br />
effects which EEC export subsidies on agricultural products<br />
were having on Australia's trade in markets outside the<br />
Community. Australia's trading opportunities in the EEC and particularly<br />
for agricultural products had diminished dramatically since<br />
the formation of the Community.<br />
It was the objective of this Government firstly to arrest that<br />
decline and secondly to gain assured, increased access for our<br />
primary products.<br />
Australian Ministers and particularly Mr. Howard and<br />
Mr. Garland in addition to Mr. Anthony and myself, pointed<br />
repeatedly to the justice of the Australian case.<br />
I believe as a result of the informed debate which this<br />
occasioned there has been increasing acceptance in Europe of<br />
the basic correctness of the Australian position.<br />
We did not seek to overthrow the Common Agricultural Policy.<br />
It is a corner-stone of the European Economic Community. But<br />
we did argue quite successfully that the Common Agricultural<br />
Policy could and should be amended to take account of the<br />
legitimate trading interests of countries such as Australia.<br />
I note as a matter of record that it was this Government that<br />
first presented the Australian case in these terms. This is in<br />
stark contrast to the ineffective attitude of the Opposition<br />
when it was in government. That attitude unfortunately has<br />
persisted in equally ineffective denigration of the now<br />
successful efforts of this Government on behalf of Australian<br />
producers. / 3 </p>
<p>I said earlier that we did not seek to overthrow the basis<br />
of the Common Agricultural Policy. As a result our requests were<br />
moderate and in quantative terms the gains may fairly be<br />
described as modest in relation to the total world trade in<br />
the commodities concerned. But this is the first step forward<br />
that we have taken in this area for many, many years. I look<br />
forward to further such steps. I regard this as a beginning and<br />
certainly not an end of a process of continuing change to the<br />
advantage of Australian primary producers and indeed all<br />
Australians. The first stage of our efforts with the EEC has been brought to<br />
a successful conclusion and I have agreed with Mr. Gundelach<br />
this afternoon that the dialogue between Australia and the<br />
Community will remain open at the highest level and that<br />
problems will continue to be dealt with as and when they arise.<br />
It is significant that Vice-President Gundelach, who is also<br />
the Commissioner responsible for Agriculture, and had been so<br />
closely involved in the negotiations with Australia has come<br />
to Canberra to see to their finalisation.<br />
Mr. Gundelach is the most senior Commission representative to<br />
have visited Australia.<br />
The achievement of a satisfactory outcome to the long and<br />
difficult negotiations has been aided by the close working<br />
relationship which has developed between Mr. Garland and<br />
Mr. Gundelach.<br />
I would also like to pay tribute to the active role played by<br />
Mr. Garland in working to secure the final result.<br />
These are all signs that Australia and the EEC are on the<br />
threshold of a new and better trading relationship.<br />
Both sides can I hope look forward to a relationship which is<br />
marked less by difficulty and confrontation and which builds<br />
further upon the undeniable scope for significant increased<br />
trade and economic co-operation. oo000oo </p>
