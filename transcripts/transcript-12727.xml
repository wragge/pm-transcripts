    <content><![CDATA[<p>E&amp;OE...........</p>
<p>Prime Minister, your reaction to some of the changes that the Labor Party have made at their conference. They've reduced union influence. What are your thoughts?</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER:</strong></p>
<p>Well they haven't. Mr Crean himself said that the changes were not about reducing union influence. The unions will still run the Labor Party. They will still dictate Labor policy. Going from 60 to 50 per cent is, in the words of Joe De Bruyn, a little bit of window dressing to win media approval.</p>
<p><strong>JOURNALIST:</strong></p>
<p>How about their proposal to create a tribunal of appeal to ensure there is no more trouble within the party.</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER:</strong></p>
<p>Well, I don't have much comment on that. I do have a comment on the affirmative action. I think that affirmative action rules are insulting to women. I think quotas are patronising to women and most women I know who are interested in politics don't want the patronising existence of quotas. They want to get there on their own merit.</p>
<p><strong>JOURNALIST:</strong></p>
<p>So you don't think the electorate is going to take some notice of these changes that they are making?</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER:</strong></p>
<p>I think the electorate wants to know what the Labor Party stands for. The electorate these days is interested in political parties and political leaders who believe in something and are prepared to fight for something that is important to them. The internal rule manipulation is of little consequence to the average Australian. What really matters to the average Australian is what you believe in and what you are prepared to do. And people don't know what the Labor Party believes in any more and I think that's its great problem.</p>
<p><strong>JOURNALIST:</strong></p>
<p>The new leadership of the Democrats - how do you think Andrew Bartlett will go? Do you think he'll make a difference?</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER:</strong></p>
<p>Well I congratulate him and he'll be ready to (inaudible) constructive. I agree with the Treasurer and perhaps he should sit down with the Treasurer and talk about getting elements of the Budget that are now jammed in the Senate through. That will be the first test of whether he is going to be a constructive leader of the Australian Democrats. If he is, well, good luck to him. If he's not, well, that will be disappointing to the Australian electorate. But, I congratulate him and I wish him well.</p>
<p><strong>JOURNALIST:</strong></p>
<p>Do you see PBS and not Telstra as the biggest issue between yourself and the Democrats now?</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER:</strong></p>
<p>Well, the question the Democrats have got to face is are they going to be a constructive third party or are they going to just be a left wing version of the Labor Party and block everything that the Government puts up. The PBS proposal is the minimum we need to maintain the affordability of a wonderful pharmaceutical benefits scheme. And when you think of the cost explosion in that scheme what we have proposed is [an] ever so reasonable, very marginal additional cost and absolutely essential if we are to maintain the affordability of that very valuable scheme.</p>
<p><strong>JOURNALIST:</strong></p>
<p>There appears to be a contradiction between yourself and the Treasurer on the property market future. He says buyers need to be concerned. You say there [are] no worries in the future. How has that arisen?</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER:</strong></p>
<p>No there's no contradiction between us. I made it clear that people shouldn't over extend themselves.</p>
<p><strong>JOURNALIST:</strong></p>
<p>Hans Blix yesterday said he would support a new resolution against Iraq to back up his weapons inspectors. Would you like to see weapons inspectors go in without a new resolution?</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER:</strong></p>
<p>No. I think what has been agreed between Hans Blix and Colin Powell is very positive and that is that the weapons inspectors are not to go in until there is a new resolution. And that is something that we support. We need a new resolution and I';m very pleased that the head of the weapons inspection team and the American Secretary of State have got together and they have got a common position. I think that is to be welcomed because the old resolution was not working. We need a new, stronger, failsafe resolution and it looks as though Hans Blix himself agrees with that. And that is a very positive and a very welcome development. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>JOURNALIST:</strong></p>
<p>Who is going to win the grand final?</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER:</strong></p>
<p>I think Eastern Suburbs will win. I think they have a stonger team and have more stars but I think it's very good for the game that we have a New Zealand based team in the grand final. It adds a bit of spark and colour and difference. And I think that's a good thing for the game.</p>
<p><strong>JOURNALIST:</strong></p>
<p>So you think fans like us, non-Roosters supporters should just bight the bullet and just get behind them today?</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER:</strong></p>
<p>Ah look I';m easy. My club didn't make it to the grand final so I don't have a particular (inaudible) and I don't take the view that people have all got to barrack for this or that team. I think it's a good thing for rugby league that we have a New Zealand team in the grand final, in the same way that it was good for Australian Rules that we had non-Victorian teams get into the grand final a few years ago. I think it all helps to build interest in the game and I think it will be a great evening.</p>
<p><strong>JOURNALIST:</strong></p>
<p>Thank you Prime Minister.</p>
