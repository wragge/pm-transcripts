PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 16 MARCH 1988<br />
The Liberals have crawled into the gutter. I sought on some<br />
occasions during the course of a blackjack game to play one<br />
box. That was permitted. No-one suggested to me that this<br />
was against the rules. The rules vary from State to State.<br />
On a subsequent visit to the casino, the rule on playing one<br />
box was, for the first time, drawn to my attention and I<br />
readily and happily accepted it.<br />
The matter in question occurred some 15 months ago. No<br />
official reports on this matter have been drawn to my<br />
attention since then.<br />
