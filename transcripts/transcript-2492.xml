    <content><![CDATA[<p>
Today before we turn to our questions I want to talk about<br />
some of the problems that we face. First of all yesterday I did<br />
have the great privilege of having a long talk with President<br />
Nixon.. and Dr. Kissingen I can assure you that those talks<br />
could not have been more intimate and I could not have wished<br />
that The President would have taken me into his confidence to<br />
a greater degree than he did. Little was left unsaid and he<br />
I did convince me that he is on the right track in trying to get<br />
a rapprochement in world affairs and to try aiud get a reduction<br />
in tensions so that we can divert our attention to the gcod life<br />
and better opportunities for our citizens than to devoting<br />
so much of our time and so much of our effort to the impediment<br />
of var. No7 I've welcomed my discussions too with Mr Laird and<br />
Mr Packard who will shortly go to Australia. I've welcomed the<br />
discussions I've had with Secretary of State Rogers, who I think<br />
I can claim is a personal friend and a man very Qell known to<br />
me. In Australia we are building one society and I want to<br />
emphasize this. We want one society united in mutual loyalty<br />
but richly diverse in ethnic, religion and cultural back. rounds and<br />
influences. As to our national development and the state of the<br />
economy, I see ahead for Australia a remarkable prospect. 7e<br />
have by good fortune, and I think too by good management, created<br />
all the basic conditions that are the ingredient for success. I<br />
don't know of any country that I have visited in recent years<br />
and I've visited a great number of them but I don't know of ary<br />
countxy that offers quite the same prospects as we do. So if aj of<br />
you feel you would like to become immigrants to nj country just slip<br />
a note up to Mr. President. Let me know your name and address and </p>
<p>I'll hand it on to one of my officials and see if you're w~ orthy<br />
of becoming a member of my own press corps, particularly if<br />
I feel that you're indulgent towards myself. 14ow as to the<br />
basic ingredients for success. Our population is growing, our<br />
economy is sopundly based. It has diversity and strength and our<br />
national resources are not only immense, but they're growing day<br />
by day. If you open the paper and don't find some newl discovery<br />
that is likely to add to our wealth it's a strange day for the<br />
press I can assure you. are too developin6 all those skills<br />
that the technological age demands and through the combination of<br />
all these qualities and virtues me are becoming a middle power. I<br />
think ' we have a significance in the Pacific theatre that is out of<br />
all proportion to the wealth that is being produced in my country.<br />
I believe we are getting into this position of trust, a position<br />
where people eousult us because they know that over the years we<br />
have been S completely trustworthy and reliable ally. They know<br />
that in terms of the aid programmes civil aid programes on an<br />
official basis that we do at least as well as any other countxy.<br />
pAnd v hen the numbers go up I can assure you that you will see that<br />
our name in terms of performance per head of population is<br />
regarded as remarkably good. As I came along one of your avenues<br />
today, Independence Avenue, I couldn't help but ask myself -the simple<br />
question " Wihy is it tha-t we don' -t parade this virtue of independence<br />
and inter-dependence in the same ways you do here. We have the same<br />
lusty vitality, the same desire to feel that we can express our<br />
opinions and our views. Vie know too that in a world that's becoming<br />
increasingly complex, in a world where you never know what is likely<br />
to happen in the forty-eight hours that are to come, we also have<br />
to have friends and allies. Consequently we want friends and allies wh(<br />
are juist </p>
<p>as trustwiorthy and reliable as tie are ourselves. There are certain<br />
factors in the Australian economy that ' we have had to 6ive some<br />
considerable attention to in recent years, particularly over the<br />
last twelve months. Not that these problems are singular<br />
to Australia. I can assure you they are not, but we do. face the<br />
problem in exactly the same way as you do. But re have cost<br />
inflation and we have to a minor degree the appearance of a small<br />
degree of unemployment that we feel that ' we have to overcome<br />
as quickly as we can. We have certain other ~ economic problems<br />
too that are not so much the direct consequence of internal<br />
problems but are problems that arise as the resul. ofi our<br />
relationship iith other countries and the changes that occur<br />
in our trade, particularly lately the changes that have occurred in<br />
our international currency situation. May I now turn to one<br />
of your problems the one relating to the currency crisis.<br />
First of all might I say that of course we understand your<br />
position. For long the United States has, as it were, shcltered<br />
more than a fair proportion of the burden of the world. Not<br />
only in the way in which it has provided security for so many<br />
countries but also because it has been a reserve currency able<br />
to provide the additional international currency that it has<br />
provided the free exchange of goods and services. We understood<br />
therefore it " ias necessary not only that you should reduce the<br />
burden of your defence effort but also that you should have<br />
the opportunity to get a better balance in your payment<br />
system. All that ' we had to decide was the amount of the<br />
turn round that was necessary somewhere </p>
<p>near eight thousand billion dollars per year, but the<br />
ways and means that turn round was to be achieved.<br />
But I go on further to say this: that so far as<br />
we are concerned we are not in a position where we<br />
can be explicit about what our own intentions will<br />
be because we are not a member of the group of ten. We<br />
don't belong to working party three of the OECD.<br />
Consequently un. til decisions are made by the countries<br />
that have the decisive influence in world finance, it<br />
is not sensible or prudent for us to be making up our<br />
minds the way we'll go. On the contrary it seems<br />
sensible that we keep all our options open. Wlhen<br />
the major decisions are made, particularly on the DM<br />
and the yen, we'll be able to make up our minds what<br />
we are to do. What we do hope is that there is an<br />
early re-alignment of currencies, and we hope, even<br />
more importantly, that before that occurs that your<br />
imports surcharge is removed and that trade will be<br />
freer. This way people will have the stars by which<br />
they can guide their economic fortunes, rather than the<br />
mysteries of today that are confusing everyone. If the<br />
difficulties remain for much longer then I think you can<br />
have action by other countries in retaliation and a<br />
hardening of ideas into dogmas that I think can do<br />
damage to all of us. So I do hope therefore that we<br />
will have changes and I hope that those changes take<br />
place fairly quickly. I can assure you that in my<br />
conversations with various members of your Administration<br />
I learnt that they share exactly the same view as we<br />
do in Australia.<br />
The next economic issue is Britains entry into the<br />
European community. For our part we have always C~~<br />
accepted the right of the United Kingdom's Government<br />
to make up its own mind what it thought was in its<br />
best interests. Nevertheless, what we felt was that<br />
Britain, with whom we have had so many years satisfactory<br />
and reasonable trading relationships, would represent<br />
our interests in the European community and try a a </p>
<p>and protect our exports into the Community countries,<br />
particularly the primary imports to the maximum of our<br />
capacity. But now we do find that there are these<br />
growing trade barriers probably as much as $ 350 million<br />
worth of our goods. We regard it as of critical importance<br />
to us all that not only does Britain do its best<br />
to represent our point of view and attempt to protect<br />
our interests, but that we ourselves discuss with all<br />
the European Community countries our problems, to enlist<br />
support to see that there is a greater interchan:: e of<br />
commodoties in the world. And. that far from being<br />
isolationist and internal-looking that they. will be<br />
outward-looking. And that the principles of the Kennedy<br />
round of negotiations will once again be respeClted in<br />
the world and that freedom of trade will become the<br />
catch-phrase rather than the alternative.<br />
May I now turn to our foreign policy and defence.<br />
Because as I said last night at the dinner that was<br />
given to me by the President: we believe in Australia<br />
and I am sure you believe it to be true too that profound<br />
changes are taking place in the policies and relationiships<br />
of the super and middle powers. The KPeoples<br />
Republic of China has now entered the United N~ ations<br />
and ever since February of last year, continuing right<br />
through to March and until representation was achieved<br />
a few days ago, we have persisted with the poli'cy that<br />
first of all the Peoples Republic of China should have<br />
the permanent seat on the Security Council. At the<br />
same time, because we believe in the principles of<br />
the Charter itself and we believe in the Charter of<br />
* universality, we wanted Taiwan also to remain a member<br />
but a member of the General Assmebly. We-too look at<br />
the Soviet Union with its increasing power and the<br />
kowledge that it is a world power as well. It has L&amp;<br />
begun. starting to exercise that power -Ln a part of<br />
* world the Indian Ocean. Up to the present moment it<br />
has to be confessed that they have not had large fleets </p>
<p>there. Up to twenty vessels might be there at any one<br />
time. They have pretty considerable afloat capacity and<br />
they have some access to port facilities and to airfield<br />
facilities. We understand just as well as anyone else<br />
the reasons why they want this present. In some way<br />
to counteract the influence of China, in some ways to<br />
balance the influence of the to protect their own<br />
trade interests, and we also believe to be able to make<br />
some political influence on the littoral states if they<br />
feel that the opportunity arises. For our part, and<br />
on behalf of the U. K. we are watching this position very<br />
carefully. Your Government has decided to put in a<br />
signal station in the Diego Garcie, I think I could<br />
take it for granted, although I have not V~ een given.<br />
any concrete assurances about it that you yourself ril<br />
have a counter balancing force there from time to time.<br />
Not necessarily permanently based, but I believe you<br />
will have a counter balancing force that will show to<br />
the littoral states and show to the world that the U0<br />
is prepared to live up to its obligations in the Indian<br />
Ocean as well as it accepts the international burdens<br />
of being the greatest of the western powers and the<br />
greatest of the super powers as well. We are building<br />
a naval base in south western Western Australia at<br />
Cockburn Sound and a first class airfield at Learmouth.<br />
We do hope the United States will be able to join with<br />
us in the use of these facilities when elements of their<br />
fleets might visit our shores. So too the United Kingdom<br />
that has its small interests in South Africa and has also<br />
agreed to take part with tte United States in the signal<br />
station in Diego. Garcia. So you can therefore see that<br />
we are there -the three of us are there not because<br />
we believe that we have any offensive operations in<br />
mind, but purely for defensive purposes. To show the<br />
rest of the world that we are determined to support<br />
the cause of freedom and make our contribution to freedom<br />
whenever the opportunity should arise~. What I do say<br />
to you is this: that we hope that in time our Asian </p>
<p>and Pacific neighbours will come to form a close-knit<br />
community that will have a political weight and an<br />
importance of its own. By that I mean that I do believe<br />
that we have a degree of importance in the South-East<br />
Asian countries that is out of all proportion to our<br />
own industrial strength and our military capabilities.<br />
But I believe that they think this way because of their<br />
trust in us, but much more importantly believe in it<br />
because they know that we feel that by creating an<br />
Asian identity, by creating the feeling that in cooperation<br />
we can be a deterrent to aggressive action by<br />
insurgency and by other kinds of subversive operations.<br />
By that means we can ward off attack and we can devote<br />
increasing quantities of our assets to developments in<br />
the future, particularly developments for those who<br />
today suffer from hunger and the privations of a primitive<br />
community,,<br />
Might I come to the next and probably the last point<br />
that I want to mention before questions are asked. I<br />
want to again emphasise because it becomes an, article<br />
of faith with my own people that whenever we are faced<br />
with a problem, whether it is in security area cultural<br />
relations, trade or finance, we do make up our own minds<br />
what is in our interest. But I like to use the word<br />
" independence" at the same time as I use the word interdependence.<br />
It indicates the kind of attitude we have<br />
to the world in which we live as well as the world<br />
with which we have to associate. I </p>
<p>W~ hat re were doing provides a framework for cooperation<br />
amongst several of the countries of Southeast Asia. In particular,<br />
only a few days ago we have sig-ned or initialled a five part<br />
agreement with Yalaysia, Singapore, the United Kingdom, New<br />
Zealand and ourselves. And what we hope is that in time<br />
our Asian and Pacific neighbours will come to form the same<br />
kind of close knit community which will be similar to the five<br />
power arrangements we have with the countries I've mentioned<br />
and that will have political weight and importance of their<br />
own. As we see it this will not be a military alliance or bloc<br />
but a grouping of like minded countries engaged in close<br />
cooperation for their mutual welfare and development whose<br />
collective voice will count for something in the world. None<br />
of this involves any reakening of our alliance with the United<br />
States which remains, and I emphasise this as I emphasise it<br />
again and again the sheet anchor of our security. Indeed we<br />
would not be able to play our part in the security of our own<br />
region without the support for our own defence efforts which<br />
the ANZUS treaty provides. Yesterday, the President himself gave<br />
his assurance in the clearest terms that the treaty was there to<br />
stay and has continuing vitality. Our relationship with the<br />
United States has been tested in conflict. Australia and the<br />
United States have fought side by side in world wars, in Korea<br />
and in Viet-Nam. W~ e have worked closely together for the<br />
development and welfare of Southeast Asia and we enjoy the<br />
closest cooperation and consultation in the day to day condaict<br />
of our international relationships as my~ present visit has<br />
underlined. Of course we make our own independent assessments of<br />
particular situations and problems. T. e vigorously defend and<br />
pursue our own national interests in the international 3cene </p>
<p>and in your bi-latera. relations. At times there are of course<br />
differences between Australian and American assessments and between<br />
particular Australian and American. interests but the sum of the<br />
differences that mayr arise between us is small compared with the<br />
interests re have in common, the ideals and objectives which<br />
tie share. We see ourselves as a partner Pith the United States<br />
in efforts to produce a durable world order and a balance in<br />
which the medium sized and smaller powers will be able to consolidate<br />
their independence and. live in peace. The support we offer is<br />
the support of a significant and independent countxy in the<br />
Asian and Pacific regions. A countzy grow~ ing in strength and<br />
influence. In short 11Mr President, we see our relationships<br />
not as an echo, not as a satellite but as a partner in the<br />
Pacific. U </p>
<p>I also emphasise the very close and cordial relationships that exist<br />
between your country and ours. At times, of course, there are differences<br />
of opinion between us, but they axe not very great. It is the coimmon<br />
interest we have and coimon ideals we have that I think are much more<br />
important than the differences of opinion wherever they have occurred.<br />
In the discussions that I have had with your Administration I have found a<br />
very strong disposition to come to terms Pith us whenever I have raised<br />
some difficulty that I think it would be better if we solved. And I<br />
think as a result of the discussions I have had in the last few days we Pill<br />
be able to talk on a more frank and, I believe, more sensiblc basio with<br />
Mr. Packard and Mr. Stans and others when they come to Australia than Re<br />
would have been able to do just a few weeks ago.<br />
Question: Mr. Prime MiUnister. Is Australia worried about deteriorating<br />
relations between the United States and Japan and the resulting effects<br />
on security in the Pacific?<br />
Prime Minister: Yes. We were worried about the ostensible deterioration<br />
in relationships between Japan and the United States because we think that<br />
there are five powers that must take place in a general rearrangement of<br />
equilibrium in the world if we are to ensure the basic conditions of success<br />
both in peace and in future developments and we Iaaow that Japan has to<br />
play a particularly iniortant part in the Pacific theatre. I think that<br />
when the first visit of Mr. Kissinger took place to Peking there was, I think,<br />
a feeling not only of disappointment but almost of despair in the case of<br />
Japan. And since the currency crisis and the ten per cent surcharge has been<br />
imposed I think that the worries of Japan have become increasingly great.<br />
Now it is our view that unless these problems of the currency crisis and<br />
a freer exchange of goods and services take place then you are likely to<br />
have a period of retaliation and you are likely to find, as I said in the<br />
body of my speech, that the views that are held temnoarily can easily tur-n </p>
<p>into dogmas. I have discussed this -with the President; I have discussed it<br />
' with other members of the Administration; they understand the position<br />
equally as much as I do, and I think I can assure you they know the<br />
necessity for a quick solution. But they also point out and I think it's<br />
wise that I should point this out to you too that the answer doesn't fall<br />
exclusively in the minds and the hearts and in the intelligence of the<br />
~ American and the Japanese people. The EEC countries and particularly<br />
France axe involved and consequently it is wise that we try and get a general<br />
realignment, a general rearrangement of parities as wdll as getting the<br />
import surcharge taken off at the earliest moment. Bthx it will not be of<br />
great advantage to any of us if we find that some countries in the Group of<br />
Ten, not Australia, because we are not a member of it, but if some countries<br />
in the Group of Ten refuse to play their part, particularly refuse to play<br />
their part in ensuring that there is a turn round of something of the order<br />
of eight billion dollars in the balance of payments as between the United<br />
States and the rest of the world.<br />
Q~ iestion: What do you see as the future defence alliances in South East Asia<br />
in the light of the United Nations vote and President Nixon's revised China<br />
policy. Prime Minister: I don't think that there will be any general realignment of<br />
security or military alignments in S. E. Asia because-the truth of the matter<br />
is there is not one country there that is on its own or in combination with one<br />
of its allies capable of defending itself against a major attack by one of<br />
the super powers or one of the very great powers. The second point is that<br />
I don't think the Nixon doctrine itself has undergone any change whatsoever<br />
as a result of the new China policies or the meeting of the President with<br />
the heirarchy in Moscow. I believe that this policy still holds good and it<br />
is a policy identical with our own. Primary responsibility for defence<br />
= awt reside basically with the country concerned but if in the case of<br />
insurgency or subversion it becomes beyond their capacity it becomes an area </p>
<p>responsibility. After that I believe that is protection against attack by a<br />
nuclear power, whether by nuclear weapons or otherwise, that the United<br />
States will live up to its treaty obligations and its defence obligations.<br />
Consequently I can't see the necessity for any great realignment in the<br />
defence or security sense. I believe the position remains much the same as<br />
it was before these general security realignments took place.<br />
Question: Mr. Prime t-Unister. If Uncle Sam is moving into a balance of powe-.<br />
with Red China where does this leave Australia?<br />
Prime Minister: First of all I don't think that this ifteans that there could<br />
be an alliance between the Peoples Republic and the United States. In myr<br />
view the motive, in fact the sole motive behind the actions of the President,<br />
is to try to get a balancing of power in order to ensure that countries<br />
can look forward to the future free from the dangers of an imminent var and can<br />
consequently devote more of their efforts to developing projects and to be<br />
able to provide the under-developed countries of the woxld with better<br />
opportunities for better living. In other -words I don't think for one moment<br />
the U. S. ' wants to change its relationship with Japan. So far as we are<br />
concerned I have received unqualified assurances from the President as well as<br />
the Secretary of State that the ANZUS Treaty remains as valid today as it did<br />
on the date on which it was signed. So I just want to, if I can, dismiss the<br />
idea of any alignment of the U. S. or ganging up by the U. S. with the Peoples<br />
Republic of China or Russia. On the contrary what he wants to ensure is that<br />
there is a reduction in tensions and the countries, of course, that must<br />
make the major, if not the sole contributions towards the reduction of tensions<br />
is the U. S. S. R. and in particular too China as it moves into the nuclear age. </p>
<p>Question: Will you please expand on your reference to the dialogue with<br />
China. How soon will relations be established?<br />
Prime Minister: Our own?<br />
Questioner: Yes.<br />
Prime* Minister: This again is one of those questions that is extremely difficult<br />
to answer. As long ago as February/ March last year I did ask myr Department,<br />
I was then the External Minister, and later on I became the Foreign Minister<br />
too, to develope a series of position papers relating to China, that is the<br />
Peoples Republic to the U. S. S. R. and to Japan. We then decided not only<br />
did we rant representation of China in the United Nations but that steadily<br />
we should move toward bilateral improvement in our bilateral relationships<br />
between China and ourselves. You will notice that I don't use the word 6<br />
" recogaition" because I think that would be moving a little too quickly for<br />
some sections of public opinion in Australia itself. I have also been<br />
reminded by many people that when you are dealing with the Chinese they take<br />
their time so you don't want to be in too great a hurry. For example<br />
one country reminded us that it took sixteen years for them from the date they<br />
started till the date recognition or the formalities of recognition were.<br />
completed. So far as we in Australia are concerned we permit our own citizens<br />
to move freely subject to security requirements. We have got a very liberal<br />
trade attitude. Apart from strategic goods of a war-like character we permit<br />
them to sell to us and for us to sell to them. In cultural and scientific<br />
relationships there are no bars whatsoever. So far as we are concerned, leaving<br />
defence and security out of it, there is complete freedom of movement and<br />
restrictions are very very few. We do have some problems on trade. And at<br />
once I think I sho" u I make it clear that if China has the opportunity to play<br />
politics of course it will do so, but equally too if it believes it can get<br />
advantage out of trade or other relationships with Australia or some advantage to<br />
China, there might be greater advantages to ourselves, of course, it will<br />
deal with it in a matter of fact and businesslike fashion. So me are there </p>
<p>ve have been negotiating with them in various countries and particularly in<br />
Hong Kong. Wie haven't got very far in the improvement in our relationships<br />
but the matter is in their hands if they indicate shortly that they would<br />
like a trade mission to go to China or they would like officials of our own<br />
G~ overnment to be associated with a trade mission ' we would take action, but<br />
we are in no hurry. At every step we vill consider our own interests, our<br />
own best interests, and what we should do in our best interests. We certainly<br />
are not going to be creating the impression with the Peoples Republic of China<br />
or the Government of the Peoples Republic of a great anxiety at any time<br />
to have better relationships with them. Vie will do what we can but we ' Will<br />
be just as patient as they are and above all we will be continually<br />
considering Australia's major interests.<br />
Question: Would Australia favour a U. S. military presence in South East<br />
Asia after Vietnam and also what do you consider the prospects for peace<br />
will be in Indo-China after the American withdrawal?<br />
Prime M-inister: The first part of the question is very easy to answer.<br />
But it is a question that should be directed to the United States Administ.-atio<br />
and not to me, because in a country where I am a guest I think it is a little<br />
imprudent to be offering suggestions to the gove rnm ent of that country as to<br />
its conduct of either -diplomatic or military affairs. I believe in the<br />
Bandung principle of non-interference in the affairs of other countries, but<br />
speaking as it were at a press conference where I suppose everything will be<br />
kept relatively secret, of course we want the American presence to remain<br />
there just as long as it can and of course we want them even when ground<br />
combat troops have been withdrawn. We would like them to maintain residual<br />
air and naval forces providing the people of the United States feel that it is<br />
proper and in the best interests of the Indo-Chinese people. As to the<br />
question of the viability of Indo-China, or the four states of Indo-China,<br />
from all that I have heard during the course of the last few days, and I </p>
<p>have been briefed at very senior levels, I think that both aspects of<br />
Vietnamisation are turning out to be successful. First of all on the<br />
military level your own advisers informed me that the poeple of South<br />
Vietnam axe increasingly able to look after themselves, and the United States<br />
Administration is determined on an aid programme that will give them the<br />
opportunity for development programmes that in a civil sense permit them to<br />
remain viable. As to our own efforts ve. have a very large civil aid programme<br />
of the order of twenty five million dollars and vie have now under<br />
consideration proposals for agreement in cooperation with N~ ew Zealand and<br />
the United States proposals to establish or to participate in, training<br />
centres both for advisers and for military training personnel. We will<br />
do this in South Vietnam not only for the South Vietnamese but for the<br />
Cambodians; in other words what I do say is this; that whereas five or six<br />
years ago it looked as though it was impossible for South Vietnam and<br />
Cambodia should remain independent and free. The prospects are much greater<br />
today and with a little good fortune and a little good luck and provided<br />
' we are able to give the civil aid programme what they need in a residual<br />
capacity in terms of military effort,, then I think the prospects of success<br />
are ever so much brighter than they were two three or four years ago.<br />
Qaestion: Senator Muskie a likely Presidential candidate says that it<br />
is only a matter of time before South Vietnam goes communist* Do you agree?<br />
Prime Minister: If you express an opinion iike that frankly ittS one of<br />
the occasions when I'm driven to despair. It would be a tragedy for this world<br />
if after so mach American blood and effort had been spilled, after so mach<br />
life has been lost, and such a tremendous effort has been devoted to the cause<br />
of South Vietnam, of the right of the South Vietnamese people to determine<br />
their own future, we should be so despairing as to think that all we have done<br />
will turn out to be valueless and that the North Vietnamese and Viet Cong </p>
<p>r~ ill overrun South Vietnam and probably too Cambodia. I hope it doesn't occur.<br />
I don't kn1ow on what grounds Senator LMuskic has made his views known other<br />
than of course he is an aspirant for Presidential honouxs. But if I<br />
emn take note of what was said yesterday by men I believe to be ever so much<br />
better informed than he is, then in their views the prospects of survivial<br />
are pretty good. I would be inclined to take their views ever so imch<br />
more than I take the views of Senator Muskie. I </p>
<p>Question: Would Australia, and New Zealand and the free nations of South<br />
East Asia feel more secure if the U. S. kept a permanent naval for-ce in the<br />
Indian Ocean to counter Soviet influence in that area?<br />
* Prime Minister: Not only can I give the most emphatic yes to this but it<br />
would be a constant source of delight to me and as one who is given to<br />
turbulence in the middle of the night I can assure you it would make my<br />
life ever so much happier and my evenings ever so much more enjoyable.<br />
qu~ estion: Do you have any reservations at all about f6reign investment in<br />
Australia. If so, could you tell us what they are. Do you have any preference<br />
between sources of capital inflow?<br />
Prime Minister: Wie haven't any strong preferences for where capital comes from.<br />
But what I can say about capital coming from North America is'that they, I<br />
believe more than most other countries, want to live up to the basic principles<br />
of overseas investment in Australia. First, we want increasing Australian<br />
equity participation in corporative activities. Second, we want AostraliJans<br />
to be able to participate in management and administration. For that reason wte<br />
welcome American participation. We also welcome their technological Ikiowhox<br />
and the contributions they have made particularly in the development of our<br />
vast mineral deposits in the west andour Bass Strait oil deposits. I can't<br />
in a question like this go right into the details, but American investment in<br />
Australia is welcome to us providing only the provisions I _. entioned a few<br />
moments ago are observed. * V'e do want greater Australian participation. WNe<br />
do want greater Australian participation in management, but at the same time<br />
we welcome American contributions to our future.<br />
Q4uestion: One of your predecessors once said here regarding Vietnam<br />
" all the way with LBJ". ould you now subscribe to the 1968 political assertion<br />
that " Nixon's the one?" 1 </p>
<p>Prime Minister: I think it would be indelicate of me and a kind of plagiarism<br />
if I was either to copy or appear to be copying what was said by my predecessors.<br />
And I don't know which one of my predecessors you're referring to in the last.<br />
part of what you said. I think prudence demands that I keep my own counsel.<br />
I coin imy own phrases and if before the next ouestion is asked I can think of<br />
something even better but less provocative I will tell what it is.<br />
Question: In view of Australia's strong protest to the* French over its<br />
pacific nuclear testing programme do you propose to make similar protests<br />
to the U. S. over its controversial underground test this weekend?<br />
Prime Miniter: I think you can take it that our attitude has been ,: ade clear<br />
in the agreements we have made. So far as nuclear testing in the atmosphere<br />
is concerned we have protested no matter what country carries out nuclear<br />
tests in the atmosphere. So far as underground tests are concerned wie have no<br />
agreement and consequently we do not think that we are in a position legitiinatel<br />
or according to international law, to make a protest. But we have also been<br />
assured that these underground tests do not have the dangers or anywhere near<br />
the dangers that can be carried out either in terms of pollution or danger to<br />
life or limb that you have from atm~ ospheric tests. Consequently no protest<br />
will be made by us. certainly anxiously enquire as to what the prospects<br />
of pollution, what the prospects of danger might be, not only to Australia but<br />
to the people of other countries as well.<br />
Question: Has the all-white( IMj@ igtatinpolicy of Australia changed?<br />
Prime Minister: I don't know that there ever wls an " all-white" policy in<br />
Au stralia but I think I could say this to you, and it is worth while repeating.<br />
Ibelieve that in my own country there is less of a feeling about racism than<br />
in any other country I have visited. In short while there can be a lot of<br />
discussion in the media and there can be a lot of provocative talk about it,<br />
Australians do accept people of other races and other colours and they are an </p>
<p>extremely tolerant people. Tolerance probably isn't the right word. They<br />
just happen to accept people and particularly they accept the people of<br />
South East Asia. Nlow our policy is a quite clear one. We want one Australian<br />
people. 11* wiean t those who come there to live permanently to be Australians.<br />
We don't want little enclaves that can be a source of irritation or a source<br />
of difficulty for us. Secondly vie do permit non-Europeans to come in providing<br />
and providing only three qualifications are complied with. The first one is<br />
that they have the skills that we need, the second one is that they will make<br />
a contribution to our development. The third is that'-they are capable of<br />
intergrating and in fact do become integrated with us so that in time,<br />
particularly in the case of their children, it is impossible either to discern<br />
the origins of their parents or that they have any other loyalty than loyalty<br />
to the country in which they reside and in which they find their welfare. So<br />
I just have to say this about any so-called rarticular Australian policy: it is<br />
one that I think is wise and prudent. It is one that is not based upon racisim,<br />
it is one that I believe that anyone who has been to the country will1 recog-nise<br />
that the people are not given to racism but to welcoming people for w: hat they<br />
are and what they are capable of contributing rather than the origins of their<br />
parents. uestion: Prime Minister. The--ydney Opera House has been called Australia's<br />
Fill. Which will get off the ground first? And also how does it compare with<br />
the Kennedy Centre?<br />
Prime Minister: Fortunately the opera house is on the ground and as yet we<br />
haven't been able to get the 1ll off it so I can't in precise terms answer your<br />
question. As to the Kennedy Centre and the opera house I don't think you can<br />
compare them. The opera house, our opera house, is something completely novel<br />
and astonishingly beautiful. You have got to see it; it is not built in<br />
accordance with what I would regard as the Washington model. You see a building<br />
that is rectangular, however beautiful it might be, but nonetheless it conforms </p>
<p>to classical Greek or Roman tradition. The opera house is entirely novel<br />
and I wouldn't therefore like to make a comparison. But to each and everyone<br />
of you who are here and you wouldn't be here if you weren't interested in<br />
Australia the opening will be in 19735. I hope you will be able to have some<br />
little investment in the future of Australia and by 1973 You will be able to<br />
-have sold your investment and out of the profits attend the opening concert<br />
when it appears. because I hore by that time not only wuill we have a good<br />
orchestra but the best singers we are capable of taking from the United States.<br />
Question: As England joins the Common Market won't this bring Australia and<br />
New Zealand closer together?<br />
Prime Minister: Vie are pretty close and the only time vie ever seem to, or we<br />
appear to be disagreeable, is when it is suggested that New Zealand should<br />
become the seventh State. But without saying it so that it can be heard in<br />
New Zealand, we still look at them as the seventh State, but I don't think the<br />
relationship between the two countries is capable of very much improvement today.<br />
p( 4uestion: There are easy questions also. Will there be war between Pakistan<br />
and India?<br />
Prime Minister: I don't think that either the Government of India or the<br />
Government of Pakistan want war. The real danger arises from the fact that the<br />
people of East Pakistan are being trained in guerilla warfare and by accident<br />
it could so happen that armed attack might occur either from the Pakistan army<br />
or the freedom fighters in East iakistan itself. No one, I believe, can tell<br />
you what the prospects are likely to be. What we must all do, and I will<br />
certainly be playing my part ,41 will have the good fortune to talk to Mrs. Ghandi<br />
tomorrow A, is to press with her and to press with the President Khian that<br />
war must not take place. It can't benefit India, it can't benefit akistan and~ </p>
<p>Zil<br />
above all it cannot benefit any of the people of these two countries. Those<br />
of us who feel we can play a part, however humble it might be, have got to<br />
bring home to everyone the lesson that war will benefit no one. The sooner we<br />
can persuade the Pakistanis to permit democracy or democratic regime to be<br />
established under the Awarni League in -last Pakistan as part of a total Pakistan<br />
solution, the better it will be. He has made his promise. I only hopne he will<br />
be able to live up to it.<br />
Question: The final question: what impelled you to buy the dress M'rs. Mc~ iahon<br />
wore at the VWhite House last night?-<br />
Prime M'inister: I know her better than anyone. I like the shape of her legs,<br />
I like the look of her face, I like the fact that she chose me for her husband<br />
at the same time I chose her to be my wife. V.' hen I happened to be walking past<br />
a shop in Double Bay and saw a dress in black I then said to her I thought she<br />
should buy it. That was six weeks ago, before the President had asked me to corm'<br />
here, and before I knew the President was g iving a State Dinner in our honour.<br />
When I beard of the dinner I gave instructions not that they matter very much<br />
in my household but I gave instructions that she was to go down and have<br />
the dress, not in black because i thought that there was nothing to mourn about,<br />
but in white because this was something we could acclaim. And above all as<br />
immediately before I had the good fortune to become the Leader of the Liberal<br />
Party in Australia,-one of the assets I wa.; supposed to have was a photograph of<br />
my wife with one leg projecting unnecessarily from a maxi shirt. I felt, well,<br />
if you can have one split on the maxi side, well why couldn't she have two<br />
sides it might be twice as good for me so there's the answer. I wish,<br />
Sir, that I had known you were going to ask this question because as I chose<br />
the dress, I practically designed the colour and insisted on the two splits up<br />
the side, I think I could have ensure~ she wore it here today even though<br />
it isn't the kind of dress that you would wear on an occasion similar to this. </p>
