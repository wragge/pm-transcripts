COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA<br />
SPEECH BY<br />
The Rt Hon. W. McMAHON, M. P.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
ON<br />
Overseas Investment in Australia<br />
Ministerial Statement<br />
[ From the ' Parliamentary Debates', 26 September 19721<br />
Mr McMAHON ( Lowe-Prime Minister)-<br />
by leave-Last May, the Treasurer<br />
( Mr Snedden) tabled in this House a Treasury<br />
economic paper entitled ' Overseas<br />
Investment in Australia'. In doing so, he<br />
identified 3 problems associated with overseas<br />
investment. They were the high level<br />
of capital inflow and the potential problem<br />
that creates for managing the domestic<br />
economy; the suggestions of exchange rate<br />
speculation to which such inflows give rise,<br />
and the -possible consequences of that; and,<br />
the sheer growth of foreign ownership and<br />
control of important elements of our economy.<br />
Since May this year, the Government<br />
has been conducting a review in depth of<br />
our policy towards overseas investment.<br />
We were aided in this by the public debate<br />
which the Treasury economic paper generated.<br />
Today I want to announce the Government's<br />
decisions to date arising out of that<br />
review. Before doing so, however, I wish<br />
to make clear the Government's view of<br />
the past and future role of overseas capital.<br />
Overseas capital has played a vital role<br />
in Australia's development. It has added<br />
considerably to the resources available for our growth. It has brought with it valuable<br />
technological know-how and access to<br />
overseas markets; it has created new industries.<br />
As a result, Australia is a larger<br />
nation, and a more prosperous one. The<br />
inflow of capital has been associated with<br />
increasing overseas ownership and control<br />
of industry in Australia. This has -been one<br />
cost of the increased growth which has<br />
come from welcoming overseas capital. In<br />
the past, this has been a cost which, in our<br />
judgment, has been outweighed by the<br />
benefits. Nonetheless, our policy has been<br />
to encourage overseas capital to come insofar<br />
as practicable on a joint basis-and in<br />
close co-operation with Australian-owned<br />
enterprises. But circumstances change and<br />
so must -policies.<br />
In the past 2 years, capital inflow has<br />
increased dramatically. In 1969-70, net<br />
apparent capital inflow was $ 797m. In<br />
1970.71, it was $ 1,418m. Last year, it was<br />
$ 1,841m. A very high* level of capital<br />
infloyw seems in prospect again this year.<br />
Until 2 years ago, capital inflow, by and<br />
large, was -broadly matching our defcit on<br />
the current account of the balance of payments.<br />
That is, the overseas capital was </p>
<p>being used to add to the resources available<br />
in the economy. Without it we could<br />
not have sustained a large net inflow of<br />
goods and services from the rest of the<br />
world. That situation has now changed. In<br />
1970-71 net apparent capital inflow<br />
exceeded the current account deficit by<br />
S598m. In 1971-72, the excess rose to<br />
S1,443m. Between end-June 1970 and end-<br />
June 1972, official reserve assets rose from<br />
$ 1,538m to $ 3,764m. They now exceed<br />
$ 4,100m. In brief, in the past 2 years, capital<br />
inflow has resulted chiefly in a build-up of<br />
international reserves rather than an addition<br />
to resources actually being used in the<br />
economy. The greater part of this recently<br />
increased inflow has been in respect of<br />
company borrowings. Exchange control<br />
approvals of gross borrowings abroad rose<br />
from $ 568m in 1969-70 to $ 1,222m in<br />
1970-71 and to $ 1,681m. in 1971-72. With<br />
the existing unimpeded access to overseas<br />
lenders, our ability to use monetary policy<br />
effeotively has been called into question.<br />
The House may recall that the Treasury<br />
economic paper said that ' private capital<br />
flows have now acquired a practical potential<br />
to nullify the effects of monetary policy<br />
on internal economic conditions.' To<br />
date, this has not happened. But the buildup<br />
in liquidity which is proceeding will, if<br />
allowed to go unchecked, produce some<br />
headaches for the future.<br />
As a separate but related matter, the<br />
Government has also -been considering the<br />
growth of overseas ownership and control<br />
of Australian industry. We need to be sensible<br />
about this. We all want to see a bigger<br />
Australia. We all want the tangible<br />
benefits that access to overseas capital and<br />
skills ' brings us. Yet there is legitimate<br />
cause for concern. The right balance<br />
between our desire for an Australian Australia<br />
and for greater growth and prosperity<br />
must be struck. After 20 years of<br />
vigorous growth, we are today a relatively<br />
wealthy nation. We have less need to<br />
depend on overseas capital for our growth<br />
today than we did some years a-go. We can<br />
afford now to trade off, at the margin,<br />
some of the benefits of overseas capital for<br />
a greater Australian share in our industry<br />
and resources. We can do it, too, without<br />
frightening off overseas capital. Overseas<br />
investors -are expecting us -to move. In brief, the policies which have serveL US<br />
well in the past now need modifying.<br />
I turn now to the 4 specific decisions we<br />
have taken as a result of our review to<br />
date. Three relate to the problem of net<br />
capital inflow and the fourth to the problem<br />
of overseas control of our industry. I<br />
begin with the first of the 4 dec'isions, that<br />
is: Exchange Control on Short-Term<br />
Borrowings Overseas<br />
The largest part of net capital in-flow is<br />
accounted for by borrowings overseas * by<br />
Australian residents, including foreign<br />
companies resident in Australia. We have<br />
decided to act to reduce the level of short<br />
term borrowings. The ' Reserve Bank will,<br />
from tomorrow, refuse exchange control<br />
approval for all overseas borrowings which<br />
would be repayable, or carry options to<br />
repay, in 2 years or less. Loan agreements<br />
which have already received exchange control<br />
approval will not -be affected.<br />
With a view to rendering the proposed<br />
measure effective, the present sterling area<br />
exemption, under which, inter alia, borrowings<br />
in Australian dollars from sterling area<br />
residents are not subject to exchange control<br />
approval, will be terminated forthwith. For<br />
the sake of administrative simplicity, at any<br />
rate in the early stages of the scheme, borrowings<br />
totalling less than $ 100,000 in any<br />
one year will be exempt. The appropriateness<br />
of this exemption limit will be reviewed<br />
from time to time. I come now to the second<br />
decision which concerns:<br />
The Borrowing Guidelines<br />
Since May 1965, the Government has<br />
laid down certain guidelines which have<br />
limited the freedom of overseas-owned companies<br />
to borrow in Australia. One effect of<br />
the guidelines has been to require overseasowned<br />
companies to bring in funds from<br />
overseas in place of the funds which they<br />
have not been permitted to borrow locally.<br />
This effect was appropriate to the circumstances<br />
formerly prevailing, but the circumstances<br />
have changed. The need now is to<br />
limit overseas borrowings, not to encourage<br />
them. Accordingly, the Government proposes<br />
to abolish the guidelines forthwith. </p>
<p>Portfolio Investmuent Overseas by<br />
Australian Residents<br />
At present, portfolio investment abroad<br />
by Australian residents is not permitted.<br />
Our decision is to relax this policy while<br />
retaining the need for exchange control<br />
approval of such transactions. Details will<br />
be announced shortly by the Governor of<br />
the Reserve Bank. The effect of these decisions<br />
Will be to moderate the level of net<br />
capital inflow from overseas. They may, as<br />
a result, have some effect on the Australian<br />
capital market and will, incidentally,<br />
restore to Australian financial<br />
institutions some of the business which, in<br />
recent times, has been going abroad. I<br />
want to emphasise that developments in<br />
our own market will be watched very<br />
carefully to ensure that there are no untoward<br />
consequences. With liquidity presently<br />
at a high level, no transitional<br />
difficulties are foreseen.<br />
Mr Speaker, at this point 1 turn to the<br />
question of overseas ownership and control.<br />
In this area of policy, the Government<br />
has long made it plain that the most<br />
welcome overseas capital is that employed<br />
in partnership with Australian-owned capital.<br />
However, the trend towards increasing<br />
overseas ownership has gone on. The time<br />
has come to consider more direct action to<br />
influence that trend. Our balance of payments<br />
on current account has improved<br />
greatly and, with that, our need for overseas<br />
capital has lessened. Our own Australian<br />
industry is more advanced and<br />
technologically capable than 10 or 20<br />
years ago and can, if given the chance,<br />
effectively partner overseas companies.<br />
Action in the field of foreign ownership<br />
and control generally raises complcx problems.<br />
We have undertaken an initial study<br />
of these problems, but their resolution will<br />
require more detailed study and further<br />
time for careful consideration. That work<br />
is now in hand. Its results will be<br />
announced as soon as practicable. However,<br />
in respect of one particular form of<br />
overseas ownership and control, we have<br />
decided that action can be taken without<br />
awaiting the final outcome of that full<br />
review. I refer to the subject of our fournh decision: Foreign Takeovers<br />
No aspect of overseas investment has<br />
excited more attention than this question.<br />
Foreign takeovers result in control as well<br />
as ownership passing from Australian to<br />
foreign hands. This aspect causes particular<br />
disquiet. Sometimes foreign takeovers also<br />
have the objective, or at any rate the<br />
effect, of limiting competition. In such<br />
cases, disquiet is justifiably intensified. On<br />
the other hand, foreign takeovers can<br />
revive an ailing company or may be made<br />
at a price permitting the Australian recipients<br />
to reinvest the proceeds at a considerably<br />
increased return. Australian as well<br />
as overseas investors have rights at stake<br />
and our policy must be such that their<br />
interest is not prejudiced-except when the<br />
interest of the nation requires it. The Government's<br />
longstanding policy has been<br />
that it reserves the right to do all in its<br />
power to prevent a particular takeover<br />
when, in the circumstances of the case, it<br />
is considered by the Government to be<br />
against the national interest. Moreover,<br />
under the policy announced on 24th May<br />
last by the Attorney-General on restrictive<br />
trade practices and monopolisation, takeovers<br />
which are likely to limit competition<br />
will be subject to examination and report<br />
by the monopolies commission which is to<br />
be established. This applies whether the<br />
bidding company be foreign or Australian.<br />
We think, however, that the time has<br />
now come to introduce a new approach<br />
for the control of foreign takeovers. The<br />
Government intends to legislate for the<br />
prevention of foreign takeovers it considers<br />
would be against the national interest ion<br />
the basis of criteria which I shall indicate.<br />
The legislation will apply to acquisitions of<br />
shares or other assets by overseas interests<br />
which might reasonably be expected to<br />
result in control of an Australian business<br />
passing to overseas interests. In the case of<br />
company takeovers, there will be a presumption<br />
that acquisition by any one overseas<br />
interest or associated group of 15 per<br />
cent or more, or by overseas interests in<br />
the aggregate of 40 per cent or -more, of<br />
the voting power of an Australian company<br />
could constitute a takeover. For this<br />
purpose, overseas interest will include an<br />
Australian-incorporated company ink wvhich<br />
any one overseas interest or group holds </p>
<p>per cent or more of the voting power<br />
or in which overseas interests have in the<br />
aggregate 40 per cent or more of the voting<br />
power. Cases where control of a business<br />
would pass into overseas hands<br />
through acquisition of all, or a substantial<br />
part, of the assets of the business will also<br />
be subject to the measures.<br />
The measures may also apply to the<br />
transfer of a significant part of the ownership<br />
or rights over a valuable or potentially<br />
valuable mineral area, such as can<br />
occur through transactions known in the<br />
mining industry as ' far-m-ins'. If overseas<br />
interests demonstrate that an acquisition<br />
would not give a significant degree of<br />
foreign control, the measures -will not<br />
apply. They will also not apply if the takeover<br />
would simply transfer control from<br />
one overseas interest or group to another.<br />
The measures will, in general, apply to<br />
cases where the company concerned,<br />
whether listed or unlisted, has assets of<br />
more than $ Im. Australian governments<br />
have already taken action to restrict<br />
foreign investment in certain industries of<br />
national sign ificance-notably banking, airlines<br />
and radio and television broadcasting.<br />
Cases may arise where an Australian company<br />
involved in a takeover proposal is<br />
considered by the Government to be an<br />
economically strategic industry leader or to<br />
be so large that the takeovers would<br />
significantly affect the relative balance of<br />
Australian-overseas ownership and control<br />
of the industry concerned. The proposed<br />
legislation will include -a power, in those<br />
circumstances, for the Government to take<br />
direct action to prevent the takeover if it<br />
judges such action appropriate.<br />
~ Foreign takeover proposals judged by<br />
the Government to warrant detailed investigation<br />
as to whether they would be<br />
against the national interest will * be<br />
referred t o an independent authority-including<br />
official Government representation-<br />
which will analyse each such proposal<br />
and report on it to the Government.<br />
Decisions on individual cases will be<br />
taken-I stress this--by the Government,<br />
after consideration of the independent<br />
authority's report. There will be a time<br />
limit of one month, measured from the<br />
date of notification of a takeover to the<br />
Government, or the date of the making of a public announcement concerning the<br />
takeover, for reference of takeover proposals<br />
-by the Government to the independent<br />
authority. Proposals not referred in that<br />
time will be free to proceed. There will be<br />
a further time limit of 3 months maximum<br />
from the date of reference for report by<br />
the authority, unless extended by the Government<br />
in special circumstances.<br />
For the purpose of references to and<br />
reports by the independent authority, the<br />
first criterion to be applied in judging<br />
whether a proposed foreign takeover would<br />
be against the national inerest will be:<br />
Whether, against the background of existing<br />
circumstances in the industry concerned,<br />
the takeover would lead, either<br />
directly or indirectly, to inet economic<br />
benefits in relation to such matters as production,<br />
prices, quality and range of products<br />
and services, and efficiency and technological<br />
change which would be suicient<br />
to justify the increased degree of foreign<br />
control of the particular industry that<br />
would result from the takeover.<br />
If the proposed takeover is judged to be<br />
not against the national interest on this<br />
basis, the following additional criteria will<br />
also be taken into account: Whether, after<br />
the takeover, the firm concerned could be<br />
expected to follow practices consistent with<br />
Australia's interest in matters such as<br />
exports, imports, local processing of materials<br />
produced, research and development<br />
and industrial relations, including employee<br />
protection; and whether the takeover<br />
would have adverse consequences in terms<br />
of the Government's objectives for<br />
defence, environmental protection or<br />
regional development.<br />
In making judgments as to whether particular<br />
foreign takeovers would be against<br />
the national interest on any of the foregoing<br />
grounds, due weight will be given to:<br />
The extent of Australian participation in<br />
ownership and management that would<br />
remain after the takeover; and the interests<br />
of shareholders of the company subject to<br />
the takeover and the attitudes of its board<br />
of directors. Pending the enactment of legislation<br />
and establishment of the independent<br />
authority to be provided for in it, the<br />
measures I have outlined for the control of<br />
foreign takeovers will be brought into<br />
immediate effect on an interim basis. </p>
<p>Uti. er the interim arrangements departmental<br />
machinery will be used in place of<br />
the independent authority and on the basis<br />
of application of the criteria I have<br />
indicated. These measures will apply from<br />
tomorrow and will embrace foreign takeover<br />
proposals already current.<br />
The decisions I have announced are firm<br />
and positive: They have not been taken<br />
lightly. Australia has benefited greatly<br />
from overseas capital in the past and we<br />
continue to welcome it on fair and reasonable<br />
terms. The steps we are taking are designed to deal with some of our main<br />
concerns. We believe they do so fairly and<br />
judiciously. As I have said, we aim to see<br />
greater Australian participation in overseas-<br />
owned companies. In addition to the<br />
steps I have announced this evening, the<br />
Government is examining further means of<br />
giving effect to that aim. In the meantime,<br />
however, we make it clear that our concern<br />
is to see that overseas capital is<br />
employed in Australia in real partnership<br />
with Australian owned capital. I comiend<br />
the proposals to the House.<br />
