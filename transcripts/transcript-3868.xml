27 August 1975<br />
Medibank MEDIBANK HOSPITALS AGREEMENT, QUEENSLAND<br />
The Prime Minister today signed the Queensland<br />
Hospitals Agreement.<br />
It is expected that the Queensland Premier,<br />
Mr Bjelke Petersen, will sign the agreement on behalf of his<br />
Government by the end of this week.<br />
The signing of the agreement will mean that the<br />
Medibank Hospital Arrangements will be operative in Queensland<br />
as from 1 September. Queensland's public hospitals already<br />
provide free standard ward treatment, including medical services<br />
provided by salaried and sessionally paid doctors.<br />
The funds that Queensland will receive under the<br />
agreement will materially assist the Queensland Government in<br />
upgrading its hospitals and health services generally.<br />
Under the Medibank Agreement the cost of operating<br />
Queensland's public hospitals system will be shared on a 50/ 50<br />
basis between the Australian and Queensland Governments.<br />
Australian Government expenditure under the<br />
agreement with Queensland is estimated at $ 90 million for the<br />
period 1 September 1975 to 30 June 1976.<br />
