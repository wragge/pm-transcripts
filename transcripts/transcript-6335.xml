TRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW ON JOHN LAWS PROGRAM, 2UE, 5 MARCH 1984<br />
LAUS: And we welcome the Prime Minister of Australia, Bob Hawke. Good Morning.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Good lonuing John.<br />
LAWS: Good to see you looking fit.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Thank you.<br />
LAWS: Seen out in the sun?<br />
PRIME MINISTER;<br />
A bit.<br />
LAVWS: Playing tennis?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Not recently unfortunately.<br />
LAWS:<br />
Good game.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
It's the best.<br />
LAWS: How's your backhand?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I think it's effective, yes, it's effective.<br />
LAWS: I have terrible trouble with the backhand because I wiggle my hip<br />
round. You'll tell me I have got to lock that hip.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
And get that shoulder moving as well. You'll have to come up and have<br />
a game John.<br />
LAWS: Like to.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Good. Done. </p>
<p>2<br />
LAWS:<br />
' You've had your shoulder into it for 12 months today.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Yes that's right.<br />
LAWS: 12 months that you've enjoyed.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Yes. LAWS: 12 months that's been good for the country?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I think so John, yes. Well when I say I think so you can point to<br />
the objective evidence. In the 12 months before we came in about<br />
150,000 jobs disappeared. Since April there has been about 140,000<br />
jobs created. The unemployment percentage has come down, inflation<br />
has come down, interest rates have come down. So those are pretty<br />
important tests, I think, for the average person John.<br />
LAIS: Do you think that some of that might have come to fruition even had<br />
the Fraser Government stayed there? Do you think that the breaking<br />
of the drought, for example, had an effect?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Obgiously the breaking of the drought has helped and I have made it<br />
quite clear all the way along the line that the breaking of the drought,<br />
the United States recovery have been pluses. Ve have obviously got to<br />
acknowledge that. But basically the substance of the Australian<br />
recovery has been founded in the new attitude, the new cooperation,<br />
the absence of confrontation. Industrial disputes are the lowest they<br />
have been for 15 years. People are now working together rather than<br />
dissipating our resources fighting against one another and specific<br />
policies I mean the housing industry, that didn't depend upon the<br />
drought or the United States recovery. It was down on its knees now<br />
we have turned it. round by specific policies the First Home Owners<br />
Scheme, increase in funds to the public housing sector. So it has been<br />
Government policies and attitudes we have engendered which have been<br />
basically important.<br />
LAWS: What do you regard as the greatest achieveiment of the first 12 months?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I don't think there is any doubt John that the greatest achievement is<br />
what I mentioned to you a moment ago. It is the end to ccnfrontation.<br />
We had become as you know, you've tal-R_ about it, a very divided<br />
society where everybody was fighting one another. We were wasting time,<br />
wasting resources. I promised national reconciliation. I think we<br />
have gone a very long way to achieving that. That's the thing of which<br />
I'm proud of.<br />
LAWS: Yes, now do you see that as a Bob Hawke achievement or as a Labor<br />
Government achievement? I I </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:<br />
We have all been involved in it. I have had to give the: leadership.<br />
I guess the concept of thn L ational Economic Summit was very much a<br />
Hawke concept but it worked because all my Ministry and the people<br />
around me worked to make it work, So I claim some personal involvement<br />
and credit. I certainly have some personal pride in it, but it couldn't<br />
have happened without everyone around me making this sort of approach<br />
central to their own approach.<br />
LA'WS: Coild it have happened without Bob Hawke?<br />
PRIUE MINISTER:<br />
I doubt if the concept of national reconciliation was there in anyone<br />
else's eyes, I certainly had been the one who had been giving expression<br />
to that and particularly in terms of the Summit and what flowed from it<br />
it is a matter of record that those were my ideas. But I don't want to<br />
waste time on that aspect of it. The important thing is that all the<br />
people around me in the Government have worked themselves according to<br />
these Ideas. They have applied their very considerable talents to<br />
making it work. It has been a team effort.<br />
LAWS: Yes. I get to talk to a lot of staunch Labor supporters, both privately<br />
and publicly. Some argue, and some argue quite vehemrntly, that the<br />
aims and the achievements of Bob Hawke are very often quite different<br />
to the Labor Party. Are they?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well I thiki the correct answer is this; that if you look back over the<br />
12 months John, we have seen more done in that 12 months to implement<br />
Labor policies probably than in any 12 months of any previous Labor<br />
Government. At the same time I have been quite astringent in saying<br />
that we have a basic obligation not just to the Labor Party but we have<br />
a basic obligation to the community as a whole, and essential to that,<br />
as you know I have talked over the years to you about this, is a healthy<br />
private sector. If you haven't got a healthy private sector where 3/ 4<br />
of our people are employed then the country is not going to be working<br />
well. Now the emphasis that I have given on this relationship between<br />
the public and the private sector to get a healthy prviate sector going<br />
may be an emphasis that some people in the Labor movement haven't in<br />
the past given.<br />
LAWS: Does that worry you?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
No because I know that we're right on this.<br />
LAWS: z,<br />
What's more important, the people of Australia or the Labor Party?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Thee is no question of what is more important, the people of Australia<br />
are the number one responsibility. They must come first and the Labor<br />
Party must understand that. Any political party must understand that.<br />
LAWS: Do you think the Labor Party does understand it? </p>
<p>4<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Yes. Just let ms make a point sorry to interrupt you if you<br />
look at the polls I am not talking about just mine and the<br />
Government's, but the important p int is look at the proportion of<br />
Labor supporters where they are saying that ove' 90% of Labor supporters<br />
are saying they support the approach that I am adopting in this<br />
respect, so the evidence is there.<br />
LAWS: I think it's refreshing, and I think that is probably an understatement,<br />
to hear a Prime Minister say that he believes that the people of the<br />
country are more important than his political party and its beliefs,<br />
you're saying aren't you?.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well I think that they are not inconsistent. I mean my first, and<br />
I say unequivocally, is that the people are more important that the<br />
party. There is no question about that. And I am in the fortunate<br />
position, John, where I believe that a sensible application, a sensible<br />
moderate. application of the philosophy and policies of the Labor Party<br />
are consistent with the interests of the people. But if there ever<br />
S came a point where I believed that the interests of the people of<br />
Australia required that a particular point of policy not be implemented<br />
then, then my view would be that the interests of the people came first<br />
and I believe that the great majority of Labor people would support that<br />
approach. LAWS: Yes, you have no guarantee that they would so what you have just said<br />
is a very brave thing to say because what you are saying is if it came<br />
toa point where you believe something to be right and the Labor Party<br />
disagreed, you would prefer to stay with the people of Australia than<br />
stay with the Labor Party?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
' I didn't, I mean you are now, and I understand you are having fun<br />
and ( INAUDIBLE) you can finish up with a headline if you want to.<br />
LAWS: ( Laughs) Well I don't want to disappoint them.<br />
S PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Oh no, well they are indebted to you, but you see I have been around for<br />
a while John as you know. What I am saying is that the Labor Party<br />
itself, I think the great majority of the Labor Party understands this.<br />
I mean you have say a particular piece of a platform. Now you can have<br />
circumstances where it was quite clear that tp introduce, act on that<br />
piece of the platform at that time would be against the interests of<br />
the community. So you don't do it then. Now what I'm saying is that<br />
I believe that that sort of attitude which I have is one which the<br />
Labor Party understands, the great maority of them understand, so I<br />
don't think that this sort of position that you are trying to drarnatise<br />
would arise.<br />
LAWS: No don't say dramatise, I am trying to hypothesize.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Hypothesize, yes, that's a lovely word.<br />
LAWS:<br />
Not quite as strong as dramatise. </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:<br />
And you know I don't go down hypothetical paths too far, John.<br />
LAWS:<br />
No, not too far. So we're never really going to get an answer to the<br />
question. If it was a toss up between the people of Austrlaia and the<br />
Labor Government, who would Bob Hawke choose?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well I have said that I think that a Labor Prime Minister, particularly<br />
one as determined as I am about the welfare of this country is not going<br />
to be really faced with a situation where the Party won't understand<br />
what is required to be done.<br />
LAWS: Well they'd be mad if they didn't.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
That is for others to judge, John.<br />
LAWS: Mm. Can you ever ervisage a situation where you will totally wir over<br />
the Left-wing or will they always be a bit of a thcrn?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well if you look at the history of the Labor Party it has always had its<br />
factions no more than the conservative parties, One time I would like<br />
to come on and have a yard to you about the factionalism of the<br />
conservative parties, but I think it is true to say that if. you look at<br />
the Left in the Labor Party now, it is not monolithic John, and there<br />
are certainly parts of the socialist left who look with great askance<br />
with some of the observations of their more extreme elements. So I will<br />
never be in a position where some of those more extreme elements will<br />
love me or support what I am doing, but I think as you go steadily about<br />
the business of trying to create a better Australia in which clearly<br />
those who are in employment and those who are in business can improve<br />
their wages and salaries, can improve their profitability and at the<br />
same time are trying to do something for the underprivileged, when<br />
people see that being done as I think we have already achieved in this<br />
12 months. I think more and morepeople in the Labor Party will understand<br />
that that is the way to go. You can't just focus on one particular<br />
issue be a one issue Government or a one issue Party. You have got to<br />
say that the basis of everything else is economic growth a more<br />
profitable industry, a workforce which ' is going to be able to maintain<br />
its real standards and improve its conditions. Those things are basic<br />
to everything else. It is only when you do those things that you can<br />
sensibly talk about creating a more equitable society doing things<br />
for those who really can't help themselves. Now that is what Australians<br />
want and that is what we're about.<br />
LAWS: I think it is what Australians want and I think if they feel that their<br />
tax dollar is being, and you and I have been through this a number of<br />
times, is being spent wisely I don't think that they ever become<br />
selfish or self-centred about the monies that they pay in tax providing<br />
they believe that it is being spent wisely.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I think that is a fair commentary. I think there was a period that we<br />
went through in the end of the ' 70s and right there at the beginning<br />
of the ' 80s where selfishness was almost made mandatory by Governrrmnt.<br />
You remember we talked about this where we had the Fraser Government<br />
saying to the unions well look we'll abandon wage fixation. Go out and </p>
<p>6<br />
PRIME MINISTER CONT'D:<br />
grab or do what you can. Saying to industry well go and do what you<br />
can. It encouraged the syndromo almost of the tax avoider seemei to<br />
symbolise the society of " well damn you all, I am there to just g: rab<br />
what I can" and there was a period where that happened but I think<br />
you are right in saying that that's not the real Australia. I don't<br />
think it is.<br />
LAWS:<br />
No I don't think it is but I do think it was an understandable period.<br />
I do think that there was a period where the public felt that their<br />
tax dollar was being spent inadvisedly. And I think people are going<br />
to object to that.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well people are entitled to object if they can see that their tax<br />
dollar is being wasted or could be spent better, but I think for a<br />
lot that that would be a way of rationalising what they were encouraged<br />
to do in pursuit of their unbridled self-interest. I think it was very<br />
unwise of Government to give this almost unqualified emphasis, John, to<br />
go out and get what you can for yourself. Rather what consensus is<br />
about, what I am trying to explain, is getting through to business and<br />
getting through to the trade unions that their objectives are legitimiate.<br />
It is legitimate for business to want to increase its profitability so<br />
it can invest and create more employment opportunities. It is<br />
legitimate for the trade unions to want to maintain and improve their<br />
conditions. Now what we're about is trying to make them understand<br />
that the achievement of those legitimate and mutually reinforcing<br />
objectives is more likely if you work together rather than belting<br />
your brains out and dissipating your resources fighting one another.<br />
So it is an enlightened self-interest I think which makes Australians<br />
understand that working together is going to be better for each of them<br />
than just in a mindless way just going out and grabbing for your own<br />
irrespective of everyone else.<br />
LAWS: Yes I agree with that. And you maintain that consensus and conciliation<br />
have brought around a change in that. I agree with that. It seems to<br />
have worked in most areas. A couple of areas seem to be giving a bit<br />
of a problem, one being the BLF.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Yes, they behaved, in my judgement, abominably recently having given<br />
their undertakings to the courts and to the Government, and most<br />
particularly to their fellow trade unionists, then they didn't sLick<br />
to that. Now it looks as though, as a result of discussions that the<br />
ACTU have had with them, that they are going to act in accordance with<br />
the rest of the trade union movement. Can I just make it clear that I<br />
hope that is what happens. If it doesn't then I make it quite clear<br />
that in conjunction with the ACTU an,_ qd will be brought to that<br />
situation. As I say I hope it will be worked out by consultation.<br />
LAWS: Do you get yourself into a situation where you talk across a table<br />
like you are talking to me to people like Norm Gallagher?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well when I was in the ACTU I used to deal with him.<br />
LAWS: What about now? </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well he was at the Summit Conference and it appeared from the Summit<br />
i. nd on for most of ' U3 he and his union behaved like the rest of the<br />
trade union movement. We had peace in the building indt. stry, very<br />
substantially, and I can talk with people when they will discuss,<br />
make a cormmitment and keep it. What I can't abide and will not abide<br />
is people entering into undertakings and not keeping them. In that<br />
context there is no room the-i to talk. Now as I say it looks as though<br />
they have given an undertaking again. It had better work because if<br />
it doesn't there won't be any more consultation.<br />
LAWS: The reason I asked the question about Norm Gallagher sitting over the<br />
desk from you, Norm Gallagher is not prone to talk, he won't talk to<br />
me at all. Not even " Good day" to me. But I wondered if you two<br />
ever had the opportunity to sit across a desk, surely a man with half<br />
a brain, and I suppose we should credit him with that, must realise<br />
simply by the look in your eyes, that you are fair dinkum, Because<br />
I watched a total change come over your face when you talk about these<br />
people digging their heels in and it is terribly obvious to me that<br />
you are not about to abide it. Now why isn't it obvious to them?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well I think it has been made obvious. The Secretary of the ACTU,<br />
Bill Kelty, who I think is one of<br />
LAWS: I think he is one of the brightest light around,<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
One of the truly great Australians., Bill Kelty, Now we have talked.<br />
He knows my determination. He shares it because he realises that<br />
it is not merely the authority and policies of the Government which<br />
are at stake here, it is the authority and the integrity of the ACTU.<br />
LAWS: They made an agreement didn't they?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
That's right. Now Bill Kelty has conveyed these feelings to the<br />
Builders Labourers Federation and they understand that we've reached<br />
the bottom line. Either the BLF is part of the trade union movernnt,<br />
keeps it commitment and goes along with the trade union movement or it<br />
doesn't. And if it doesn't then there'won't be any way in which into<br />
the future the BLF will be part of the tr~ ade union movement.<br />
LAWS: Will the BLF exist?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well I think it is not helpful at this stage, John, to as I say get<br />
down the hypothetical path. I think I made it clear.<br />
LAWVS: No, okay. I accept that, I hope he is smart enough to, But the point<br />
is if a union, let me really be hypothetical for the benefit of the<br />
listeners, if a union causes trouble and is dismissed from the ACTU<br />
can that union continue to exist independently of the ACTU? </p>
<p>8<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
In the past it has been able to bocause the ACTU has said " Alright<br />
well then if there is a deregistration it has been brought about by<br />
forces outside the trade union movement". What no single trade union<br />
cat. tolerate is if the t; rade union movement and the Government say<br />
you have divorced yourself from the w; hole stream of the trade union<br />
movement. In those circumstances obviously other things happen,<br />
LAS Other things that cause them not to continue to exist?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Now you have had your one little essay down the hypothetical path.<br />
LAWS: It was good though, wasn't it?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Yes. LAWS: So, back to the consensus and conciliation; we suggested it didn't<br />
work as well as it might with the BLF, It didn't seem to work at<br />
all with the doctors.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well John, with respect, that's not quite right. Let me say that in<br />
the negotiations about Medicare Dr. Blewett, who I think has done a<br />
very good job, has had discussions with the doctors and generally a<br />
lot has been worked out between them. A position was reached by 1: he<br />
end of last week where they were having still some problems and it<br />
seemed as though it might be a good idea if I had a talk with the AMA<br />
with Dr. Blewett. We did that quietly, with no publicity last Friday<br />
and the AMA have had a meeting over the weekend. I don't know the<br />
outcome yet but I'm hopeful that as a result of the talks T was able<br />
to be involved in that that may be sorted out too. There's no point<br />
in doctor-bashing or AMA-bashing. I recognise that they have had<br />
concerns. It is not the sort of system that if they had their<br />
( INAUDIBLE) that is why they would have. Generally speaking I think<br />
they have recognised that the people have spoken on this concept.<br />
They have tried to protect particular interests that they have got.<br />
I think it is going to work out with their cooperation.<br />
LAWS: Yes. PRIME MINISTER:<br />
And may I say also that my old sparring partner, Joh, will probably<br />
be signing the agreement this week I think.<br />
LAWS: The cry from the doctors is, and I have had some talks with them, is<br />
that they are convinced that you plan to nationalise health care.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well that's absolute nonsense and not only is it wrong but there is<br />
no evidence for it and I guess my standing in the community is wkell<br />
enough for it to be sufficient to be said that that is not our intention<br />
and we will not do it.<br />
LAWS: Plan to nationalise anything? </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:<br />
WVell the Constitution as interpreted by the High Court prevents it.<br />
LAWS: Yes but Consitlitions have been changed.<br />
PRItIE MINISTER:<br />
Well then if the Constitution were changed it would be only because<br />
the people changed it, If the people indicate a desire for that<br />
course of action then it would be appropriate.. But look, let's get<br />
it. quite clear, natinalisatition in. not n rnpv., er to the problems.<br />
Who would want to nationalise the steel industry, for instance, What<br />
would you want to nationalise? The secret of successful Gover-ment<br />
in these increasingly complicated days is to make sure that those<br />
things that need to be done by the public sector are done well. There<br />
is much in this country that needs to be done by the public sector.<br />
It needs to be done in a way which provides an infrastructure within<br />
which the private sector can operate efficiently. There is nothing<br />
intrinsically good about the public sector and nothing intrinsically<br />
evil about the private sector. There is a necessity for each. There<br />
is competence and there is incompetence in both. Now what the<br />
Government has got to do, what a concerned Government has got to do,<br />
is to make sure that you make the public sector as efficient and as<br />
relevant as possible and to help the private sector to get rid of its<br />
own inefficiencies which undoubtedly exist so that together in<br />
cooperation we can maximise the vast resources of this country.<br />
LAWS: So you believe that they have got to work together and that they can<br />
and they will work together?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Yes they have got to and they can work together better than they<br />
have in the past and I think what we've seen in the last 12 months<br />
is a preparedness on the part of the private sector, and I welcoli; e<br />
the positive response of the private sector,. They have been prepared<br />
to sit down with us in Government, with the Public Service, and with<br />
the trade unions and say well look what are the things together we can<br />
do to. make for a better Australia. The steel industry plan; think of<br />
that before we came in. We were on the edge of not having a steel<br />
industry at all. Now that would have been intolerable. Now the<br />
industry, the unions, the Government sat down together and now we've<br />
turned that round completely. Ve have a viable, strong and increasingly<br />
efficient steel industry where the private industry, BHP, has<br />
committed itself to significant investment. The unions have cosmnitted<br />
themselves to improve work practices and our Government has committed<br />
itself to assistance. Now that's if you like a dramatic illustration<br />
of what I am talking about. Getting the public sector, the private<br />
sector, the unions sitting down and saying " look we are not here<br />
wasting cur time talking about ideological issues of public and private<br />
sector nationalisation. We are facing up to the realities of<br />
Australian life and trying to make jtose realities work better. Now<br />
that is what the Government is about.<br />
LAWS: Yes. It all sounds too good to be true.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
But it works, that's not theory what I am talking about in the steel<br />
industry, that's what happened.<br />
LA\? S:<br />
I know but people still won't cop it. People say ah yes but wait and<br />
see what happens after the next election. They are being nice to us </p>
<p>10<br />
LAWS CONT'D:<br />
now but wait and see what happens afterwards. What have you got to<br />
do to convince them? Stay there T suppose.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Yes well we will do that John.<br />
LAWS: That's your intention.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Yes. LAWS: It is a little more than a decada since the early days of the Whitlam<br />
era and they were pretty heady sort of days. You were very close<br />
to that from the outside. Is this Labor Government very different<br />
from that Labor Government?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Yes it is very different and we have learnt from that period.<br />
LAWS: Do you think he has?<br />
PRIrlE nINISTER:<br />
He reckons Paris is pretty good. He is able to make a great<br />
contribution there and I think that Gough would understand what I<br />
am just going to say now and that is that one of the problems for<br />
Gough and the Labor Government was the time at which they came to<br />
power, I think you have heard me say this before, that we had had<br />
a generation then under Labor and then long-term Liberal Government<br />
where we had full employment. The economy was just going along<br />
easily, not dramatic growth but it was growing. Now Gough and Labor<br />
. came to power at the end of ' 72. Within a few months of them being<br />
in office they got hit with the oil crisis in the latter part of ' 73<br />
and the whole world economy broke up into something infinitely more<br />
difficult to handle. You had inflation burgeoning throughout the<br />
world, oil prices going up, and the relations between the developed<br />
and the undeveloped countries getting into an extraordinarily difficult<br />
and complex relationship. Now the problem, the basic problem for<br />
Goubh and the Labor Government then was that they didn't understand<br />
that the economy wasn't just going to 1eep going on, growing automatically.<br />
That it had really moved then into a situation that<br />
required total concentration on economic management. They thought<br />
well that is just going to go on and we can go about the business of<br />
doing the other things that they were properly interest in. Now he<br />
was very unlucky that he had come at that time, if he had come into<br />
Government say 10 years earlier when those external forces weren't<br />
destructing the total economic cituation he may have had a better ride.<br />
LAWS: Did he make many mistakes.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Oh they, he and they. made some mistakes, yes of course they did.<br />
But basically the point I am making is that I think most of the mistakes<br />
are attributable to the factor that I have just talked about, that it<br />
was difficult to perceive that they were in Government then at a time<br />
of dramatically changing economic environments here and externally<br />
and that was a major problem. Having said all that, never let's<br />
forget the great things they did, and not least of those great things<br />
is something I have just witnessed. I have just come back from China,<br />
a country of over a billion people, John. Almost a quarter of the<br />
world's population, a country undertaking dramatic changes in their </p>
<p>11<br />
PRIME MINISTER CONT'D:<br />
economic and political philosophy. A country of vast importance to<br />
the rest of the world. YTow there is no country to which China is<br />
better disposed th-. n Aactralia and that is something of great benefit<br />
to this country now and into the future and Australia owes a great<br />
deal to Gough 1Vhitlam's vision then.<br />
LAW7S: I wonder why people chocse to forget? They do.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Some people do yes. I think the sensible thing to do is to try and<br />
be as objective as you can about these things, to recognise mistakes<br />
where they took place, but don't let's just think about mistakes,<br />
let's recognise great achievements.<br />
LAVS: I know you have got to be at Randwick at about 10.00 o'clock so we<br />
haven't got a lot of time. I remember you once said that you wanted<br />
to create the climate where people viewed Labor as simply the natural<br />
ruling party, and I'm quite sure I am right wvith those words, the<br />
natural ruling party. How close are you to achieving that?<br />
PRIME MINISTER;<br />
I think we're a lot closer than we were 12 months ag;. I think you<br />
get back to some of the conversations we were having before John.<br />
I think that there has been a view within the Labor Party and naturally<br />
enough recipronated within the community that the Labor Party has a<br />
rigid socialistic platform which talks about you must nationalise this,<br />
you have got to go rigidly down a particular path, and that that's<br />
the only way that you can provide good Government. Now I think that<br />
we've, this Government, has brought people to understand that what<br />
the Labor Party in Government in this extraordinarily complex world<br />
is about. I emphasise that because you can't say it too often and<br />
emphasise toomuch John that as we are coming to the end of this<br />
century we are living in an unbelievably and increasingly coimplex<br />
world where the impact of new technology is changing all our basic<br />
assumptions, so many of them. Now what I think we are conveying to the<br />
people is that we are aware of the complexities of this world. That<br />
the application of no " ism" or philosophy or ideology to provide an<br />
answer. What you have got to be about is trying to be aware of the<br />
forces at work here and internationally and to try and get your people<br />
and the organisations within our society cooperating in way which says<br />
alright, we are aware of change, we are aware of the great challenges<br />
that it imposes upon us, the opportunity it provides, and that what<br />
the Government is about is to bring people together to try and make<br />
sure that you maximise growth opportunities in those circumstances and<br />
at the same time, as the Summit communique said John, to remember that<br />
you must have an obligation to those who in these circumstances can't<br />
really help themselves properly. Noy-~ hat's what I think we are getting<br />
across. And it is right, I believe it is the right philosophy and the<br />
extent that we are getting that across and that people are reciprocating<br />
and cooperating with us, then I think we are closer to people saying<br />
well that's the sort of Government, that's the sort of philosophy, we<br />
want. LAWS: Yes. It would appear at the moment in NSWV they are not having such<br />
a dream run. </p>

* PRIH~ E MINISTER:<br />
No there is a bit of a problem but I Chir'k Neville Wran has made the<br />
wise decision. Ile has said vell look, let's get tbe peop-e to<br />
dccide. Let's have a short election oampaign.<br />
LAWS:<br />
W7e both know another fellow who tried that. ( Laughs)<br />
PRIME 14INISTER:<br />
A very different situatiocn ' there.<br />
LAWS: A short run up to the election though just the sains.<br />
PRIHE MINISTER:<br />
Yes a short run. Well let me say I think the result will be quite<br />
different. LAWS., Do you think that Neville is going to win?<br />
PRIME ISINISTEfl:<br />
Yes. LAP7S: Are you going to be throwing yotir hat in t; o take care of things u~ p<br />
here a bit too?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:-<br />
I'll help certainly. NSVW is the largest, most important State. It has<br />
been significant in Labor's development of Government since 1976. All<br />
that is true but also I just want to say quite unequivocally that I<br />
have known Neville Wran for a long time. lie is a man of integrity, of<br />
honour, and of competence and I believe lie deserves our support and<br />
he'll get it.<br />
LAWS: Yes. I have exactly the same feelings about him. I worry a great; deal<br />
about the talk of corruption within the Government and I believe Jt is<br />
possible that there can be corruption within a Government but I would<br />
find it very hard to come to terms with the fact that Neville Wran<br />
the man himself is corrupt. In fact I can't take it.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well he's not and It Is relevant to say that there have been threE<br />
inquiries now into allegations in relation to NS17 and in one respect<br />
with regard to Neville Wran a rVoyai Comnmissl" on into Neville ( ran,<br />
complete exonneration. The Bottom allegations about a magistrate<br />
complete repudiation, and withdrawal by Bottom. And Sinclair's<br />
absolutely contemptible allegations al. A~ then denunciation of a judge<br />
afterwards an independent inquiry '-complete exonneration. Now that.<br />
doesn't mean, it obviously doesn't mean, John, that there mjay not be<br />
problems in some,: areas, anDd I concede that there may be. But what I<br />
am saying is that what has become the issue now I would suggest is Lot<br />
just whether there are problems,-as there are I guess in most States,<br />
the issue has much more become are we going to have a situa -tion xhere<br />
unfounded allegations are going to be able to nso dominate the processes<br />
of our society that the Government is going to be frustrated in being<br />
able to go about its business. </p>
<p>130<br />
LAIIS: Oka~ y, after the election ard assvrming that Neville will Nt. in th~ t<br />
Clection, do you think that that'c going to shut the Opposition up?<br />
PRU 11NISTER:<br />
Viell I don't thinkc an Opposition should be shut up.<br />
LAW'S: You've seemed to have shut one up.<br />
PIIE MINISTER:<br />
Yes well they haven't done a bad job themselves. Yes they are<br />
pretty ineffective areu't they. X don't wan't to see an Opposition<br />
shut up but I hope it will make therm take stool; of themnselves, it.<br />
doesn't mean that if they have evidence, of wbat they think giVer<br />
evidence of corruption or of s; ome short-coi-ing that they shouldn't<br />
pursue it, but I thin)-, that one good feature ije that now out of these<br />
that there will be a process in place after the elections<br />
which will channel this into much more constructive ways of dealing,<br />
with allegations. And people whlo rw,, ke allegations, John, are goin~ g to<br />
have to be much surer than they have be:, en in the past otherwise the<br />
rebound will be upon thein.<br />
LAXUS: I'm Pleased to hear that.<br />
PRIME MINISTER;<br />
I think that's what will happen. But I certainly don't want to see<br />
an Opposition "' ut up.<br />
LAWS: I think you have shut one up.. you don't hear a giggle out of them.<br />
But the problem is that Andrew can't say Pnything because he would<br />
have done what you did anyway had he thought of it.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
IfL he had thought of it. But the real problem for our Opposition<br />
now well one of them, I mean they have got a number of proble ms<br />
but 1 think Andrew I me-an you referred to hiim I think he has5 tcon<br />
extraordinarily unwise in embracing Mr. Sinclair. Mr, Sinclair is<br />
literally incredible in our society today. His behaviour has been<br />
monstrous and untenable and is recognised as such, Mr. Peacock wcu) A<br />
have been mnuch wiser to do what the Nat~ ional Party did to the Liberal.<br />
Party at the time of lMcEwan and 101cahon, they said thatt man is znt<br />
acceptable, Now if Mr. Peacock had had the courage and tho good sense<br />
t~ o do to them what they have previously done to the Liberal. Party he<br />
would have been much better served. But he h Zs embraced the albatross,<br />
LAV7S:<br />
You don't think he has either?<br />
PRIME MIlNISTER:<br />
He has embraced Mr. Sinclair, he supports him, and he now has that.<br />
albatross firmly implanted around his neck.<br />
LAWIS: And as if he hasn't got enough worries without that, eh?<br />
PRI14E MINISTER:<br />
Well that was a gratuitous addition to his burdens. 1 am not sheddin~ g<br />
tears but I think I can say I'd prefer to see a more effective<br />
Opposition. </p>
<p>yesp well I know ycu'd -J. IPe the sport.<br />
PRWtqE MINISTER.<br />
Yes.<br />
LAVIS: Okay, well I \ il practice tiy backhand, give you a call and we'll<br />
have a game.<br />
pntz mxiqisdu;. R:<br />
Okay, righto John.<br />
Thank yDu very mch for your timB.<br />
PRIE INWISTER:<br />
That's okay.<br />
