Embargo: 4 p. m. Satuv-day, 10 February 1979.<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR PRESS 10 FEBRUARY 1979<br />
Fund Raising Campaign of Australian Olympic Federation<br />
All of us, I am sure, are aware of the importance of sport<br />
to our way of life. We are a sporting nation. We take<br />
pride in the achievements and sportsmanship of the men and<br />
women who have represented Australia in international<br />
competition.<br />
As a country of only 14 million people, Australia has a<br />
record of remarkable success in international sport. This<br />
record extends to the Olympic Games, where we can be proud<br />
of our achievements not only in terms of medals won and<br />
events entered, but also because we are one of only four<br />
nations which has competed at every Olympic Games of the<br />
modern era.<br />
I am sure I s-oeak on behalf of all Australians when I say<br />
that wa would want that proud record of Olympic participation<br />
maintained. The next Olympic Games in 1980 in Moscow and the<br />
winter events to ' De held at Lake Placid, earlier that<br />
year will once again see competition among the great athletes<br />
of the-world, including our own.<br />
In a world where many countries' sporting administration<br />
and training programs are government-controlled, Australians<br />
may be justly proud that their own athletic and sporting<br />
organisations are free of such restraints and controls.<br />
It does mean, however, that a special effort is needed from<br />
all Australians to support our athletes so that the best<br />
possible team from Australia may be sent to the 1980 Olympics.<br />
It is pleasing to note that the Australian Olympic Federation<br />
has already commenced planning for the 1980 Games, and set in<br />
motion significant aspects of its fund-raising measures,<br />
particularly its marketing and franchising program.<br />
For its part, the Commonwealth Government is prepared to vary<br />
past practice, and annHoun~ ce support for the Federation's<br />
fund-raising efforts well in advance. / 2 </p>
<p>2<br />
This new Government initiative will mean that the Federation<br />
will have two years lead time for the planning, selection<br />
and training of our Olympians. The policy of early announcement<br />
of Government assistance to sport will be extended in future to<br />
other major international events, such as the Commonwealth Games.<br />
Total Commonwealth assistance for the 1980 Olympics will be<br />
$ 800,000. Of this $ 300,000 will be made available to the<br />
Federation for pre-event training and competition for those<br />
athletes seeking selection.<br />
A further grant of up to $ 500,000 will be made available on a<br />
$ 1 for $ 1 basis to match funds raised by the Federation over<br />
and above its marketing and franchising program.<br />
With this help, the Federation should be better placed to reach<br />
its target. I am confident that all Australians will join the<br />
Government in the Olympic ideal, and give generously to the<br />
appeal fu hd.<br />
On the occasion of this launching, I wish all the organisers<br />
and all athletes who aspire to gain selection for Australia<br />
every success. o0o---</p>
