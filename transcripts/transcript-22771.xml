<p>Launceston</p>
<p>The Rudd Labor Government is delivering $100 million under the Tasmanian Jobs and Growth Plan to set the state up for a secure economic future.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Kevin Rudd and the Minister for Regional Australia, Catherine King, today announced projects to be funded under the multi-million dollar package over the next four years to support new, emerging and growing industries.</p>
<p>Tasmania continues to face a range of economic challenges including the high Australian dollar, fluctuating global markets and period of rapid change in the forestry industry, which have affected some of the State’s traditional industries.</p>
<p>The Plan represents a long-term vision for Tasmania with priority given to projects that unlock business potential, build on the State’s advantages and encourage sustainable communities.</p>
<p>The projects reach across a range of industries and capitalise on Tasmania’s unique strengths, including the food and beverage industry, timber processing, tourism, natural gas, advanced manufacturing and the arts.</p>
<p>In addition to funding for 31 individual projects, the State Government will receive $10 million to establish an Industry and Innovation Fund, and $4.5 million for a Tourism Fund to support further projects identified over the next four years.</p>
<p>The Plan balances economic wellbeing and environmental outcomes and builds on the Federal Government’s previous $24 million investment to help diversify Tasmania’s economic base.</p>
<p>Since the additional funding was announced in May 2013, the Government has conducted extensive consultation including with the Economic Diversification Taskforce Tasmania, Regional Reference Groups and the Tasmanian State Government.</p>
<p>The State Government, local councils and community groups are to be commended for their input in identifying projects that will contribute to the long-term economic security of the state.</p>
<p>Funding from the Jobs and Growth Plan is dependent on value for money assessments for each element following announcements and formal legislative protection of the new reserves, as specified in the TFIGA.</p>
<p>A list of projects is attached and further information on the Tasmanian Jobs and Growth Plan can be found at <a href="http://www.regional.gov.au">www.regional.gov.au</a></p>
