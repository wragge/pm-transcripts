   I reject, totally, the claim made by Mr Paul Keating yesterday that the<br />
   Government's decision to send Australian troops to East Timor was motivated<br />
   by domestic political considerations.</p>
<p>It is a claim, moreover, which should also be rejected by the Leader of<br />
   the Opposition, Mr Beazley. He has fully supported the deployment of Australian<br />
   troops. To my knowledge, Mr Beazley has never alleged that domestic political<br />
   considerations were behind the Government's decision.</p>
<p>Australian troops are in East Timor in response to a United Nations' request,<br />
   and as part of a multinational force, whose presence in East Timor has been<br />
   sanctioned by Indonesia.</p>
<p>Australia has played a principled and honourable role. We have acted in<br />
   a constructive and balanced way.</p>
<p>The operational readiness of Australian forces meant that we were able to<br />
   respond promptly to the United Nations' request to both participate in,<br />
   and lead the multinational force.</p>
<p>The former Prime Minister's outburst owes more to his lingering inability<br />
   to accept the magnitude of his electoral defeat in March 1996 than it does<br />
   to any rational foreign policy analysis.</p>
<p>4 October 1999</p>
