Press Statement No. 533<br />
21 July 1975<br />
AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT STAFFING CEILINGS<br />
The Prime Minister, Mr Whitlam, announced<br />
today that the Government had directed that staff ceilings<br />
for the financial year 1975/ 76 were to be applied to<br />
Australian Government employment.<br />
The decision to impose the ceilings reflects<br />
the Government's determination to restrain government spending<br />
and bring down a responsible Budget in keeping with current<br />
needs. A staff ceiling of 1.5% has been applied to the<br />
operative staff growth of the Public Service. In line with<br />
this approach, the Australian Government has also advised<br />
Statutory Authorities of their staffing limit for this<br />
financial year, Mr Whitlam said.<br />
The Government has sought the co-operation<br />
of Departments ard Statutory Authorities in maintaining a<br />
tight discipline on the use of overtime, consultants and<br />
part-time staff. The Prime Minister said that some further<br />
reduction in the staff growth of Australian Government<br />
employment may be determined by the Government in the light<br />
of Budget Cabinet considerations.<br />
