PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR PRESS 4 MAY 1978<br />
WORLD HERITAGE LIST<br />
The Prime Minister has written to the Premiers inviting them<br />
to nominate places within their States for listing on the<br />
World Heritage List.<br />
Under the terms of the Convention covering the protection of<br />
the World Cultural and Natural Heritage, adopted by the General<br />
Conference in UNESCO in 1972, there is to be established,<br />
under the title of " World Heritage List", a list of properties<br />
having outstanding universal value which form part of the<br />
cultural and natural heritage of signatory countries.<br />
Australia is one of the early signatories and a member of the<br />
World Heritage Committee.<br />
A steering committee chaired by the Australian Heritage Commission<br />
has evaluated possible areas from Australia in consultation<br />
with a number of authoritative institutions in selecting<br />
Australia's nomination for the first World Heritage List.<br />
Mr. Fraser said: " The Great Barrier Reef received the support<br />
of all concerned and I have written to the Premier of<br />
Queensland seeking his agreement that this nomination proceed".<br />
All State Premiers have been invited to put forward proposals<br />
which clearly fall within the guidelines of world significance<br />
for future listings. 000---</p>
