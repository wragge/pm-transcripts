    <content><![CDATA[<p>Good  morning, and to all the visitors welcome to Sydney. It was a beautiful ride in  this morning on the ferry, best $5.70 you could spend. </p>
<p>So, thank  you Jennifer. The Honourable Francois-Philippe Champagne, Minister of  International Trade, the Right Honourable Stephen Harper, welcome Stephen,  former Prime Minister of Canada. His Excellency Tony Negus, the Australian High  Commissioner to Canada. His Excellency Paul Maddison, Canadian High  Commissioner to Australia </p>
<p>In 2012, Lucy and I had the privilege of  attending this Forum in Toronto, and it’s wonderful that our hometown  Sydney—where the first forum was held—is hosting it once again.</p>
<p>
  This gathering has the very pragmatic purpose  of exploring the economic landscape Australia and Canada share in this global  age of change. We are living in a time when the pace and scale of change is  without precedent. This gathering also has, apart from that practical purpose,  a very symbolic one representing the warm and abiding friendship between our  two countries - a friendship steeped in history, affinity and common values.</p>
<p>
  We share, of course, the heritage of the  Commonwealth. We are political, institutional and cultural cousins. And we  congratulate Canada on this year’s 150th anniversary of Confederation. As an  occasional – although perhaps distant in time nowadays – student of Australian  constitutional history, I can say Prime Minister, that our founding fathers,  when they were writing the Australian Constitution, paid great attention to the  British-North America Act and all the experience of Canada and Canadians as  they brought together their provinces into one nation. </p>
<p>
  We both have relatively small populations  living at the edge of vast, magnificent wilderness, rich in natural resources.  We have both emerged recently from once-in-a-generation terms-of-trade booms, a  topic I’ve no doubt will be examined closely. And we have been longstanding  allies on the world stage, side-by-side in the momentous currents of the 20th  century, and now the 21st.</p>
<p>
  The first Canadian trade commissioner stepped  ashore in Sydney in 1895, but the comings and goings across the Pacific began  much earlier. Not far from here, on the Parramatta River, two bays bear the  intriguing names ‘Canada’ and ‘Exile’. They refer to the 58 French Canadian  rebels—les patriotes—who were transported here as convicts in 1840. So  at least the Canadians who came to this conference came here voluntarily. </p>
<p>
  [Laughter]</p>
<p>
  Their story links Canada’s political evolution  with our own, both seeking the ‘True North’ of freedom and equality.</p>
<p>
  A hundred years ago, after the ANZACs and the  Newfoundland Regiment fought together in the Dardanelles, our respective Prime  Ministers, Sir Robert Borden and Billy Hughes, secured membership in the  Imperial War Cabinet, allowing them to influence the direction of the First  World War.</p>
<p>
  After the Second World War, where we fought  again, side-by-side, we were both founding members of the United Nations, where  we’ve worked together ever since to advance peace, prosperity and human rights  across the world.</p>
<p>
  Today, our engagement covers development,  trade, investment, education, intelligence-sharing – we’re part of the  Five Eyes - defence and security, as well as innovation and technology.</p>
<p>
  Canada’s expertise in digital innovation has  led to its technology companies investing here in recent years, including CAE,  focused on defence and security, CGI on IT services for utilities, and D2L,  eLearning solutions. And many others; we have more than 4,000 Canadian students  attending our schools and universities, and more than 15,000 Australians and  Canadians travel to each other’s shores every year under a working holiday  agreement. I understand in some of the ski resorts in British Columbia, it is  often hard to find a Canadian.</p>
<p>
  [Laughter]</p>
<p>
  We have two-way trade in goods and services  worth more than $6 billion a year.</p>
<p>
  Our friendship is tried and true, and as the  Trade Minister and I were discussing a moment ago, it will only strengthen in  the days ahead.</p>
<p>
  Of course, as I have noted, we are really  honoured to have in our company here today Stephen Harper. A great conservative  Prime Minister of Canada for almost ten years, Stephen led a decade of  remarkable economic and political stability and was perhaps left scratching his  head at the number of Australian Prime Ministers he met during his tenure.</p>
<p>
  [Laughter]</p>
<p>
  His successor Prime Minister Trudeau and I were  both new Prime Ministers at the G20 in 2015 and I have enjoyed, as has Lucy,  getting to know him and his wife Sophie. While our parties are on different  sides of the political spectrum, nonetheless we have a great deal in common.  The values that we share as Canadian and Australian Prime Ministers, we have  had plenty to discuss.</p>
<p>
  Recently I spoke to the Prime Minister, Prime  Minister Trudeau, to offer my condolences in the wake of the shocking attack in  a Quebec Mosque. Australians stood in solidarity with Canadians against this attack  on our most cherished ideals, freedom and diversity. Of all the things we have  in common, freedom and diversity stand out as enduring and defining values. We  have each been shaped and enriched by these values, and we will always stand  together when they are threatened.</p>
<p>
  Both Canada and Australia are successful  multicultural societies. As the Australian Prime Minister I always say that we  are the most successful multicultural society in the world. But I won’t have an  argument with the Canadians about that if they have a different view. </p>
<p>
  [Laughter]</p>
<p>
  Nonetheless it is a very, very significant  achievement and worth reflecting on, in age where intolerance seems to be worse  in many parts of the world. When people with difference backgrounds who have  lived together for centuries seems no longer able to do so, it is remarkable  that here in this city, Sydney, where a third of people in this city were not  born in Australia. </p>
<p>
  In this nation we have a much higher percentage  of people born outside of Australia, or a parent born outside of Australia  than, for example, the United States, which is seen as one of the great melting  pots of the world in terms of its diversity of population. So we have been very  successful. </p>
<p>
  The reason we have been so here in Australia,  the success of our multicultural society is built on the foundation of mutual  respect. But also, I must say, on the public’s confidence that their Government  – that’s to say the Australian Government – and it alone, determines who comes  to Australia and the circumstances in which they reside or stay here. That is  critically important that those foundations have been the basis of this  extraordinary multicultural success.</p>
<p>
  Now in the same way, our two nations stand  together to defend our open economies - in the G20, OECD, APEC and the World  Trade Organisation. We will continue to work together towards regional economic  integration. </p>
<p>
  While Australia is disappointed at the decision  United States to withdraw from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, we are continuing  to talk to other signatories, including Canada, on how we can use the work that  has been done to capture the TPP’s enormous economic and strategic benefits.  Just as we have upheld our shared values of liberty and democracy, Australia  and Canada, I know, will speak with one voice on the imperative of defending  free trade and open markets around the world, because we know this is the road  to prosperity.</p>
<p>
  Those who believe that protectionism is a  ladder to get out of the low-growth trap, are making a big mistake. </p>
<p>
  It is, in fact a great big shovel to dig that  hole deeper. Protectionism, we know, we’ve seen that film before, leads to  poverty. That’s why we are committed here in Australia, to open markets and  free trade. We know trade means jobs. We believe Australians are so smart, so  competitive, so good that we want to have the biggest and most open playing  fields to run on to. </p>
<p>
  We don’t just want to sell what we make and  what we create to 24 million Australians. We want to sell to the whole world.  So the more markets we can open up, we will. </p>
<p>
  One of the reasons - as you’re here as the  Australian participants in this conference – one of the reasons we have been  able to transition much more successfully from the wind-down of the mining and  construction boom that many distinguished economists forecast, was because of  the free trade agreements that we opened up. Korea, Japan, China and of course  in Singapore and generally being able to develop bigger markets for what we  produce. It’s made an enormous different in regional Australia, parts of  Australia which have been hard hit by the downturn in mining construction. It  was always going to happen, as we all know. Canadians and Australians know  plenty about the resources sector. Investment is lumpy. We get an increase in  demand, some big investment, and then that’s done and then the production phase  goes through and it provides revenue, it doesn’t provide the same level of  employment. </p>
<p>
  So there is always that risk of a very hard  landing. That has been mitigated, offset, to a very large extent, by exports.  By trade. Trade means jobs. </p>
<p>
  So it’s not something we picked up in an  economics textbook. It’s not a theoretical thing. This is about businesses,  large and small. It’s about big companies, selling those massive commodities.  Its about universities, it’s about mum and dad businesses in Tasmania, selling  honey, selling wine, selling the produce of Australia. Right across the nation,  trade means jobs.  </p>
<p>
  So I want to welcome you once more, and wish  you all a very enjoyable forum here in Sydney. Have a great time. I loved being  in Toronto all those years ago and I hope you can compare your beautiful lakes  in Toronto with our beautiful harbour here in Sydney. </p>
<p>
  Thank you very much. </p>
