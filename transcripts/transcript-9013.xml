TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIM1E MINISTER, THE HION P. J. KEATING, MP<br />
DOORSTOP, CORAL BEACH HOTEL, PAPHOS, SATURDAY,<br />
23 OCTOBER 1993<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
J: Prime Minister, how seriously do you think the French are going to take this<br />
delegation the Commonwealth is going to send?<br />
PM: There are a couple of francophone countries in it and I think it is representing<br />
all of the Commonwealth Heads of Government and Commonwealth countries,<br />
so they are going to have to consider it. It a measure of the weight of<br />
international opinion for a successful conclusion of the Round. I think that all<br />
the parties here are going to need to give that little extra bit of ground that it is<br />
going to take to get the agreement to bed it has, after all been seven years in<br />
the doing.<br />
J: If this pressure does not work, if this final fling a 5 it were doesn't work, is there<br />
anywhere else to go?<br />
PM: I think that we are pursuing our own efforts through the Cairns Group with the<br />
United States and also speaking directly to Europe. So, I'd say it is coming at<br />
three directions that is the US themselves, pre~ sure from the United States in<br />
collaboration with the UK and Germany; another stream coming through the<br />
Cairns Group and perhaps another now with the Commonwealth.<br />
J: Why should cities like London and Washington be included on the mission<br />
agenda and cities like Dublin not?<br />
PM: Because I think that the key ones here are probably Paris and Bonn and<br />
Washington is there because its part of the negotiation. as is Geneva.<br />
J: But they're already on side, I mean London and Washington. </p>
<p>PM: I know, but it is quite a complex negotiation this. There are little bits and<br />
pieces in the services packages and the intellectual property rights packages<br />
that other people are arguing over.<br />
J: In our terms, what does success and failure meani for Australia?<br />
PM: In round terms it means about $ 70 billion ta the agricultural commodity<br />
producers world wide and we have a substanfial piece of that. It is worth<br />
about $ 200 billion in international terms the saiccess of the Uruguay Round.<br />
It is the most important backdrop that we can have now to all these economies<br />
rejoining the world economy the old Soviet Union, the Commonwealth of<br />
Independent States coming back into the world cconomy for the first time since<br />
1914; India; China; South America to have this great change in the world<br />
economy, something which we have not seen in the post-war years it should<br />
be there with a backdrop that covers goods and services and intellectual<br />
property and agriculture. Without that, the risk is there will be a slide back into<br />
protectionism and back into blocks and it s',-ems that so much has been<br />
accomplished there is just that little bit extra to 1go to get an agreement.<br />
J: Prime Minister Major has talked of world wi slump, world wide growth in<br />
unemployment, what is at stake for Australia in 1 hose sorts of terms?<br />
PM: I think the world is in a recovery mode after now three years in recession or<br />
two and a half years in recession, but there is no doubt that the velocity of<br />
trade and the impetus to trade and investment coming from a successful<br />
conclusion of the Uruguay Round would be very profound. I think the world is<br />
growing again; the US is growing again, Japan is about to turn, Europe is still<br />
quite flat, but the Uruguay Round would certainly add some impetus to that.<br />
J: Prime Minister, you wrote a letter to the Frencf. Prime Minister, Mr Balladur a<br />
few weeks ago, I remember you telling us on the last trip. Did you get a reply<br />
from that and what did he say?<br />
PM: Yes, we had a reply, but it was a reply saying that there had to be a balance of<br />
interests, it had to be comprehensive and balanced and, of course,<br />
comprehension and balance is all in the eye of the beholder.<br />
J: In your discussions last night with the Prime Minister of Malaysia, had you<br />
succeeded in bringing him any closer to the way that you are thinking on<br />
APEC?<br />
PM: It is not a matter of me succeeding. I had the oipportunity to talk to him about<br />
what we see as APEC's opportunities and how that in his terms multilateral ising<br />
US interests in the Pacific and Japanese intere~. ts in the Pacific is not only for<br />
the interests of the Asia-pacific countries, but Malaysia as well. I think the<br />
Prime Minister took the conversation in good spirits and I really enjoyed it.<br />
J: Mr Keating, do you think most Australians rea ly appreciate the importance of<br />
the end of the GATT round or understand it? </p>
<p>PM: It has been in the news for so long now, I don't know whether people just give<br />
a gigantic yawn about it, but there is no doubi: that this deadline December<br />
is the final deadline in the seven years. Thi!; is the end of the US fast track<br />
legislation given to President Clinton by the Congress; this is the last legislation<br />
they can tie a deal up under. So this is it De,-ember 15 is 54 days away and<br />
we have got 54 days to get a major internationi1 trade service and agricultural<br />
agreement to conclusion.<br />
J: Can you spell out what it would mean, what failure would mean, to the average<br />
Australian?<br />
PM: What it wkill mean I think, is that the improvement in our international income<br />
from agriculture and potentially from service,, and goods would over time,<br />
substantially constrain Australian incomes from what they would otherwise be<br />
if there were a set of background rules. In Australia's terms, we are doing<br />
some other things. We are also covering off ithat contingency by developing<br />
APEC, but APEC can be a GATT plus outcome, that is the GATT overlay plus<br />
APEC or in some way it can substitute by becoming a freer trade area, but the<br />
best result is to get the general international backdrop in, to get GATT<br />
concluded.<br />
J: Would this renewed Commonwealth emphasis on trade, do you see that<br />
affecting the fu~ ture direction of the Commonwealth, how do you see that<br />
going?<br />
PM: No, I thought it was a fairly healthy argument and discussion. That is, that for<br />
many years now the Commonwealth has focussed on South Africa and played a<br />
quite decisive role in a resolution of the impasse in South Africa and as I<br />
suggested today, I hope in a couple of years time we will see a South African<br />
democratically elected Head of State here at a Commonwealth conference. But<br />
as that issue is abated in Commonwealth terms, the Commonwealth is picking<br />
up other issues of interest to member countriesand of course, GATT and trade<br />
and incomes is an obvious one.<br />
J: So is the Commonwealth increasing its value to Australia?<br />
PM: I think the Commonwealth provides the opportunity of being a very large and<br />
representative group of countries and were the Commonwealth not to exist<br />
how would such a group of countries meet? Why would they meet? And the<br />
strength which has been drawn from them just wouldn't be available. We<br />
would be left to other fora like the United Nations et cetera. And it has been<br />
particularly useful on a number of issues or South Africa and in a lot of<br />
technical issues in education for young peopl.!; an environmental policy and<br />
maybe now with a GATT.<br />
J: But how useful have you found this discussions i: oday in the retreat? </p>
<p>PM: Useful enough. Today there was a discussion about the mechanics of this<br />
who would represent the Commonwealth and what capitals would be visited<br />
and then we had a discussion about Cameroon's entry into membership of the<br />
Commonwealth and that took up all of today's discussions, to this time.<br />
J: What are the human rights concerns about Camneroon at the moment, that the<br />
Aficans were putting up today?<br />
PM: There wasn't much put up by way of a constraint upon Cameroon joining, just<br />
saying that lets prima facie decide that they should join in two years time<br />
provided that in the interim, they continue on the path of improvement in the<br />
general conduct of their society starting with, of course, the elections which<br />
they have had and where we have seen some multi-party elections et cetera.<br />
So, I think it is left on the basis that if there is any broad objection to<br />
Cameroon joining in two years time then that may disqualify, them.<br />
J: Prime Minister, on the matter of you meeting with Dr Mahathir, do you think<br />
you have now established the basis of a reasonmble relationship with him, it has<br />
been a bit rocky over the years?<br />
PM: My discussions with Prime Minister Mahathir were very pleasant indeed. He<br />
has arrived at a number of positions on various things of interest to his country,<br />
he is thoughtful and I hope he thought that Australia has thoughtful, well<br />
worked through positions as well and we had a chance to talk about some of<br />
those and I think that was a good opportunity another reason why the<br />
Commonwealth is quite a useful body.<br />
J: You have got a grand vision for APEC, is it still a concern though that Dr<br />
Mahathir is still unconvinced and cautious about APEC?<br />
PM: I think we would like everybody to be embracing it as enthusiastically as<br />
possible, but nevertheless his thoughts are running in the same direction as ours<br />
that is, he is supporting the GATT, he is supporting multi-lateral solutions<br />
and he is supporting freer trade.<br />
J: Has the Government done projections for the effect on growth, the effect on<br />
unemployment, the effect on other economic ar.-as for Australia if GATT fails?<br />
PM: No, no, it is not a matter of GATT failing. If GATT fails then the world will<br />
just rattle through without, and I mean rattle through, without a proper and<br />
sensible backdrop in trading rules and that would be a great shame and a time<br />
when the world economy has the potential to &amp; row so much. Now, the World<br />
Bank and the OECD did a study which concluded that international world GDP<br />
would be improved by about $ 210 billion if the GATT succeeds. Now, of that,<br />
commodities represented about $ 70 billion and Australia would have a share of<br />
that.<br />
J: But have you done projections on what effect il would have for Australians? </p>
<p>PM: No.<br />
J: If the Uruguay Round actually failed, you ' iave spoken about the world<br />
breaking into blocks where does Australia fit i: 1to that scenario?<br />
PM: I don't think we should assume at this stage that it is going to fail or that people<br />
would break into blocks. I think there will be a great resistance on the part of<br />
many countries not to see the areas they live become exclusive areas, to<br />
become blocks, but basically open and free trade areas. Therefore if GATT<br />
were to fail not compound the problem by seeing their trading areas become<br />
blocks, become exclusive areas of trade. I think there is a lot of understanding<br />
about the dangers of this and the best way, of course, is to make the GATT<br />
succeed.<br />
J: With Dr Mahathir's continual reticence, does that put extra pressure on this<br />
meeting with President Soeharto to try and get s; upport?<br />
PM: No. Everyone doesn't have to agree with everything for things to be valuable<br />
and worthwhile.<br />
J: But you do need a significant supporter in ASEAN?<br />
PM: Yes, and that has been so. We have had that to date and that has been<br />
appreciated, but we still are at the stage in our we are always nevertheless<br />
tolerant of other peoples views, even if they don't agree with us on some of<br />
these things.<br />
J: Prime Mnister, did you try to persuade Dr Mahathir to come to Seattle?<br />
PM: No, I didn't. We were just talking about trade, the Pacific, trading entities,<br />
multilateralism. and a few things of interest to Australia.<br />
J: You've suggested that APEC turns into an Asi a-Pacific economic community,<br />
Dr Mahathir didn't sound particularly enthusiast . c about that this morning, what<br />
is your timetable for that? Do you actually have one?<br />
PM: No, I don't, but I think that it is very likely that at the Heads of Government<br />
meeting that the acronym may change from economic co-operation to<br />
economic community. APEC first envisaged was like a mini OECD an<br />
information sharing, policy focussed organisation. What I think it may become<br />
is a device for pro-active liberalisation of trade which is taking it a step further.<br />
J At this Leaders Summit?<br />
PM: I think so. I think we will get an endorsement of those sorts of directions at<br />
this Leaders Summit.<br />
J: Could you say why you didn't raise the Seattle question to Dr Mahathir? </p>
<p>6<br />
PM: No, no, because I know his view. It is not a matter of me trying to corral him<br />
or to pressure him, he is entitled to his view. You can't expect everybody to<br />
agree with you on these matters.<br />
J: Are reciprocal visits between you and Dr Mahathir next year now a done deal<br />
do you think?<br />
PM: I think so. We haven't arranged any times, but I think that will happen.<br />
ends </p>
