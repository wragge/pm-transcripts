( ADDRESS TO BE GIVEN BY THE PRIME MINISTER) 4<br />
NOTES FOR LABOR DAY DINNER SPEECH' 9<br />
VICTORIAN I1RADLS HALL COUNCIL<br />
LOWER MLLBUURNJE TOWN HALL<br />
SATURDAY 8 MA~ RCH, 1975<br />
EIGHT YEARS AGO THIS WEEKEND I FIRST RESPONDED<br />
TO THIS TOAST As LEADER OF THE AUSTRALIAN<br />
LABOR PARTY.<br />
WE AT A CRITICAL STAGE IN THE HISTORY OF<br />
THE MOVEMENT AN. D THE PARTY.<br />
I SAID THEN: " POLITICAL OPPOSITI'ON IS NO<br />
SUBSTITUTE FOR POLITICAL POWER. THE REAL<br />
TEST OF WHAT WE CALL OUR PRINCIPLES IS NOT<br />
THEIR PRESUMED PURITY BUT THEIR PRACTICAL<br />
APPLICATION." EIGHT YEARS LATER THE CONTEXT IS VERY DIFFERENT..*<br />
BUT THE RELEVANCE OF THOSE REMARKS REMAINS.<br />
EIGHT YEARS AGO AFTER THE DEBACLE OF 1966 THERE WAS<br />
A VERY REAL QUESTION OF WHETHER THE AUSTRALIAN<br />
LABOR PARTY WOULD EVER FORM A NATIONAL GOVERNMENT<br />
AGAINt THERE WERE POWERFUL FORCES AT WORK FOR THE<br />
DISINTEGRATION OF THE PARTY. THEY WERE<br />
STRONGEST IN THIS STATE 4!. </p>
<p>-2-<br />
Now WE HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN TWO NATIONAL<br />
ELECTIONS WITHI[ J 1.8 MONTHS OF EACH OTHER.<br />
THE TWO-YEARS-AND-THREE-MONTHS WE HAVE<br />
HAD IN OFFICE HARDLY CONSTITUTE THE DEFINITIVE<br />
TEST OF OUR ABILITY TO CARRY OUT OUR PROGRAM,<br />
TWICE PRESENTED TO THE . PEOPLE ON THE BASIS OF<br />
A THREE-YEAR PROGRAM$<br />
OUR DIFFICULTIES HAVE BEEN COMPOUNDED BY THE<br />
UNREMITTING OBSTRUCTION IN THE SENATE AND THE<br />
UNRELENTING HOSTILITY OF AN OPPOSITION WHICH<br />
JUST WON'T ACCEPT THE PEOPLE'S VERDICT,<br />
AND FURTHER NOT FOR THE FIRST TIME AN<br />
AUSTRALIAN LABOR GOVERNMENT FINDS ITSELF IN<br />
POWER AT A TIME OF PROFOUND INTERNATIONAL<br />
DIFFICULTY$ DESPITE THESE FACTORS* DESPITE THESE PRESSURES<br />
FROM HOME AND ABROAD I BELIEVE WE HAVE<br />
DEMONSTRATED THE TRUTH OF WHAT I SAID EIGHT<br />
YEARS AGO THE OVERRIDING IMPORTANCE OF OUR<br />
ABILITY THROUGH PARLIAMENT TO PUT OUR<br />
PROGRAM INTO PRACTICE$ 3/, </p>
<p>-3-<br />
WE CAN LOOK AT IT TWO WAYS,<br />
THERE IS THE NEGATIVE WAY TO THINK OF THE<br />
APPALLING ALTERNATIVE,<br />
THERE IS THE POSITIVE WAY WHAT OUR PROGRAM<br />
AND OUR POLICIES MEAN FOR THE VAST MAJORITY<br />
OF OUR SUPPORTERS AND FELLOW CITIZENS OF<br />
AUSTRALIA,,"<br />
ONE MUST GIVE SOME SORT OF CREDIT WHERE CREDIT<br />
IS DUE; AND THIS MUCH AT LEAST MUST BE SAID<br />
FOR OUR OPPONENTS$ WE'VE HAD THE SIDE-EFFECT<br />
OF MAKING THEM COME CLEAN ABOUT THEIR INTENTIONS.<br />
To PROVE HIS TOUGHNESS, TO PROVE HIS ORTHODOXY,<br />
MR SNEDDEN HAS DECLARED THAT HE WOULD UNDO MOST<br />
OF WHAT LABOR HAS DONE.<br />
To PROVE HIS OWN PARTICULAR BRAND OF TOUGHNESSi<br />
MR MALCOLM FRASER, MR SNEDDEN'S RIVAL, HAS<br />
REVEALED HIS INDUSTRIAL PLANS A RETURN TO THE<br />
PENAL'CLAUSES, JAIL SENTENCES FOR MEMBERS AS<br />
WELL AS OFFICIALS, A COMPLETE WAGE FREEZE$<br />
A NETWORK OF INFORMERS AND INTIMIDATION WITHIN<br />
THE UNIONS.<br />
You CAN'T SAY WE HAVEN'T BEEN WARNED, 11, q/ </p>
<p>IT IS TRUE T1lAT LIBERAL POLICIES CHANGE<br />
WITH THE OPINION POLLS$<br />
AFTER THEIR D7F7AT IN 1972 TIITY MADE SOME<br />
TOKEN ATTEMPT TO RECOVER THE M4IDDLE-GROUND.<br />
THE TRENDIES HAD THEIR LITTLE DAY.<br />
HAMER WAS GOING TO MAKE THINGS HAPPEN BUT<br />
WHEN IN THE FACE OF OUR ECONOMIC DIFFICULTIES<br />
THE POLLS BEGAN TO CHANGE, IT WAS A DIFFERENT<br />
STORY,<br />
OUR OPPONENTS BEGAN TO THINK THAT THEY COULD<br />
GET AWAY WITH ANYTHING,<br />
THEY STOPPED WORRYING ABOUT THE PUBLIC AND<br />
BEGAN DEVOTING THEIR ENERGIES TO THE BATTLE FOR<br />
THE LEADERSHIP.<br />
THIS BATTLE IS NOW REACHING DECISION POINT.<br />
THIS WEEK IN CANBERRA THE DOGS WERE WERE WOOF<br />
WOOFING IT SNEDDEN MUST GO.<br />
BUT HOWEVER IT TURNS OUT WE NOW KNOW FROM THEIR<br />
OWN DECLARATIONS THAT THE LIBERAL ALTERNATIVE<br />
IS BENT UPON DISMANTLING AND DESTRUCTION<br />
BENT UPON A COURSE OF SOCIAL REACTION AND ECONOMIC<br />
AND INDUSTRIAL REPRESSION.<br />
So THAT IS THE NEGATIVE SIDE OF WHY IT IS SO<br />
CRUCIAL$ 6 O o5/ 1 a </p>
<p>THE DAMAGE THREATENED BY OUR OPPONENTS' RETURN<br />
GOES BEYOND THE THREAT OF OBSTRUCTION OF OUR<br />
MOST IMPORTANT PROGRAMS EDUCATION, CITIES,<br />
WELFARE, HEALTH. THEY WOULD THREATEN THE<br />
LIVING STANDARDS OF THE OVERWHELMING MAJORITY<br />
OF EMPLOYEES, THE OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF<br />
AUSTRALIAN MEN AND WOMEN WHO ARE IN EMPLOYMENT$<br />
A REPORT BY THE INTERNATIONAL LABOUR ORGANISATION<br />
PUBLISHED LAST WEEK SINGLES OUT AUSTRALIAN<br />
WOMEN WORKERS AS THE RECIPIENTS OF THE BIGEST<br />
INCREASE IN REAL WAGES IN MANUFACTURING INDUSTRIES<br />
IN THE WORLD IN 1974.<br />
AUSTRALIA IS ONE OF ONLY SIX COUNTRIES WHERE THE<br />
BUYING POWER OF THE PAY PACKET IMPROVED SIGNIFICANTLY<br />
LAST YEAR. THE OTHERS ARE BELGIUMI KOREA, NORWAY, a<br />
POLAND AND YUGOSLAVIA$<br />
FROM THE DECEMBER QUARTER 1972 TO THE SEPTEMBER<br />
QUARTER LAST YEAR PRICES ROSE 27-PER CENT BUT<br />
AVERAGE WEEKLY EARNINGS ROSE 40 PER CENT. IN THAT<br />
PERIOD MINIMUM WEEKLY WAGES FOR MEN ROSE BY<br />
47 PER CENT AND FOR WOMEN 68 PER CENTO REAL<br />
WEEKLY EARNINGS BEFORE TAX ROSE BY 10.4 PER CENT<br />
AND AFTER TAX By 7.5 PER CENTS v o s6/ a </p>
<p>-6-<br />
EVERY COMPARABLE COUNTRY IN THE WORLD HAS<br />
SUFFERED RISING UNEMPLOYMENT AND RISING PRICES,<br />
CERTAINLY THE PRESENT UNEMPLOYMENT RATE IS<br />
TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE AND WE ARE FIGHTING IT ON<br />
ALL FRONTS, BUT AUSTRALIA AMONG THE COUNTRIES<br />
SUFFERING THE SAME PROBLEMS HAS BEEN OUTSTANDINGLY<br />
SUCCESSFUL IN MAINTAINING AND INCREASING THE<br />
REAL VALUE OF WAGES FOR THOSE IN EMPLOYMENT.<br />
THAT IS WHAT IS BEHIND THE CONCERN EXPRESSED BY<br />
JIM CAIRNS AND ME-ABOUT THE CONSEQUENCES OF<br />
EXCESSIVE WAGE CLAIMS THIS YEAR. IT'S NOT A<br />
MATTER OF BLAMING UNIONS OR UNION OFFICIALS$<br />
WE DO WANT, HOWEVER, TO SEE THAT THE VALUE OF WAGE<br />
INCREASES IS A REAL ONE NOT JUST A PAPER INCREASE.<br />
AND WE DO WANT TO SEE THAT WORKERS DO NOT PRICE<br />
THEMSELVES OR THEIR FELLOW-WORKERS OUT OF JOBS.*<br />
DON'T LET' S HAVE ANY OF THIS NONSE NSE THAT<br />
EITHER THE AUSTRALIAN POLITICAL SYSTEM OR THE<br />
ECONOMIC SYSTEM MAKES IT IMPOSSIBLE* FOR A LABOR<br />
GdVERNMENT TO APPLY LABOR PRINCIPLES.<br />
I KNOW HOW FRUSTRATING THE SYSTEM CAN BE.<br />
IT IS DOUBLY SO WHEN WE HAVE AN OPPOSITION-SUCH<br />
AS THE PRESENT ONE, DETERMINED TO OBSTRUCT AND<br />
DESTORY BY WHATEVER MEANS AT ITS DISPOSAL.<br />
o* 971@ </p>
<p>-7-<br />
YET DESPITE ALL THE DIFFICULTIES THE LABOR<br />
GOVERNMENT IS WORKING.<br />
WE HAVE USED THE SYSTEM TO SECURE THE MOST SIGNIFICANT<br />
RE-DISTRIBUTION OFWEALTHEVER TO HAVE TAKEN PLACE IN<br />
AUSTRALIAN HISTORY.<br />
WE HAVE USED IT TO SECURE THE MOST SIGNIFICANT<br />
INCREASE IN REAL INCOMES FOR THE OVERWHELMING<br />
MAJORITY ACHIEVED SINCE THE WAR -THIS DESPITE THE<br />
WORLD-WIDE INFLATION, DESPITE THE WORLD-WIDE UPWARD<br />
TREND IN UNEMPLOYMENT.<br />
ABOVE ALL, WE HAVE USED IT TO IMPLEMENT OUR PROGRAM*<br />
WE HAVE IMPLEMENTED AN EXTRAORDI1NARY PROPORTION OF<br />
THE PROGRAM ON WHICH WE WERE TWICE ELECTED -AND<br />
THIS DESPITE THE UNPARALLELLED OBSTRUCTION IN THE<br />
SENATE AND THE LACK OF CO-OPERATION FROM THE STATES.<br />
TRUE THE FEDERAL SYSTEM CREATES EXTRAORDINARY<br />
DIFFICULTIES FOR A SOCIAL DEMOCRAT GOVERNMENT.<br />
YET-WE ARE MAKING REMARKABLE HEADWAY. THERE IS<br />
CERTAINLY-NO CAUSE FUR LOS ING FAITH IN OUR CAPACITY<br />
TO ACHIEVE OUR OBJECTIVES, TO IMPLEMENT OUR<br />
PROGRAM, TO APPLY OUR PRINCIPLES, ANY MORE THAN<br />
THERE IS CAUSE TO LOSE FAITH IN OURSELVES AS A<br />
PARTY, AS THE MEN AND WOMEN WHO HAVE BEEN ENTRUSTED<br />
BY THE PEOPLE WITH THE LEADERSHIP OF THIS NATION. </p>
