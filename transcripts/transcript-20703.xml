    <content><![CDATA[<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p> The system does not involve nuclear weapons. The system involves stopping weapons coming onto Australian soil and Mr Crean doesn't even understand that fundamental fact.</p>
<p>YAXLEY:</p>
<p> But what about non nuclear missiles, would there be a battery of non nuclear missiles based here at some point?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p> The whole system is built upon the interception of offensive material heading towards a particular country through the use of missiles or lasers or a combination. But what we're talking about is finding out whether it could be of assistance to Australia but it's obvious that not only that does Mr Crean not want us even to look at it, but through his ignorance he demonstrates to the public he doesn't understand what's involved.</p>
<p>YAXLEY:</p>
<p> So could those lasers or those missiles be based on Australian soil so that they could protect Australia by shooting down anything that was being aimed at us?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p> Well the whole idea of talking is to examine what the options are.</p>
<p>YAXLEY:</p>
<p> And that's an option?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p> Well no the defensive system does not involve nuclear weapons and the question of having discussions is to find out what the options are.</p>
<p>YAXLEY:</p>
<p> But there might at some point be lasers or...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p> Well look Louise the whole idea of having a discussion is to find out what might involved. And until we have those discussions we don't know but I do know this, that a defensive system does not involve building nuclear weapons on Australian soil as Mr Crean alleged and self-evidently we would not be interested in being involved in something that was only available for America and America has made it clear that the system could be available to friends and allies.</p>
<p>YAXLEY:</p>
<p> Does it make Australia a greater target if we are so closely associated with this US national missile programme?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p> Well Louise, I would have thought the Australian public in the face of what's being said out of North Korea would want us to look at all options to provide the maximum protection for Australia and I would never have thought providing protection for this country makes us a target. I would have thought providing protection for Australia prevents us from being a target.</p>
<p>YAXLEY:</p>
<p> Why are we discussing this now when the Government wasn't raising the North Korean programme as a threat when it was asked about it five weeks ago? What has changed?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p> Well we have been concerned about North Korea for much longer back than five weeks ago. I might remind you that Australia was the first country in the world to send a diplomat mission to North Korea after North Korea owned up to having breached her obligations under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. We have in fact been more engaged in responding to the Korean problem than any country in the world.</p>
<p>YAXLEY:</p>
<p> That's right, the diplomat solutions to this, or attempts for a diplomat solution rather than the military solution of a missile programme though.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p> Louise, what you do in a situation like this is you look at all options and while I'm Prime Minister of this country I will do everything I can to protect and defend it and I'll do everything I can to examine options that aid the defence and the protection of Australia.</p>
<p>YAXLEY:</p>
<p> But what has changed since Senator Hill said that he didn't see the North Korean nuclear programme as a threat?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p> We have seen the North Korean nuclear programme as a concern to an increasing degree as North Korea has become more belligerent. And when you get a country today upping its nuclear capacity you obviously have to look at a whole range of options. And that is what we're doing, I find it amazing that anybody should question the wisdom of the Government of this country looking at all of the options that might be available to protect Australia. And I find it amazing that the alternative Prime Minister of this country doesn't even want us to look at it and even more amazing is that he doesn't understand what is involved in a missile defence system. It does not involve nuclear weapons as a part of the defensive system and clearly it is available if we thought the conditions were right.</p>
