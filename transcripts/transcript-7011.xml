PRIME MINISTER<br />
EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY<br />
F'ORUM ON BUSINESS AND UNIVERSITY CO-OPERATION<br />
SYDNEY 2 OCTOBER 1936<br />
I am pleased to have the opportunity to share with you some<br />
thoughts on ways of achieving greater co-operation between<br />
business and our tertiary institutions. After all, progress<br />
in this area is crucial to the revitalisation of the<br />
Australiani economy and ultimately, to the achievement of our<br />
common gjoal of a prosperous, fairer soci'ety.<br />
Two years ago I encouraged the Business Council of Australia<br />
and the Australian Vice-Chancellors' Committee to meet and<br />
discuscs ! pays of achieving closer co-operation in areas of<br />
mutual irterest. Even at that time it was clear that<br />
co-operation between industry and universities would have to<br />
be an inoortant element of Australia's industrial<br />
revi tali* cation.<br />
Now, faced as we are by severe economic difficulties created<br />
by the slump in our terms of trade, that co-operation has<br />
become essential. The progress your two organisations have<br />
made therefore is a source of great encouragement. My<br />
message tonight, however, is that your achievements to date<br />
are but the first of many steps that need to be taken.<br />
The report produced by your joint working party points to<br />
the many existing links between business and the<br />
universities. It also proposes ways in which those links<br />
can be strengthened and extended.<br />
Examples of what is already being done include<br />
university-based consulting companies, liaison and advisory<br />
units, and research and development centres that concentrate<br />
on industrial applications, such as the Julius Kruttschnitt<br />
Mineral Research Centre and the Warren Centre.<br />
Business leaders serve on the governing bodies and<br />
committees of the universities and contribute their<br />
knowledge and experience to developing centres of learning<br />
that are relevant to Australia's current and future needs.<br />
I hope that this forum will identify more links, like these,<br />
and also see a determination of both of your groups to<br />
establish those links. </p>
<p>The challenge now facing Australia is widely understood. As<br />
a nation we cannot go on indefinitely spending more than we<br />
are earning and financing the difference by adding to our<br />
external debt. Not-only is there now a wide appreciation of<br />
these problcms, there is an emerging consensus that the<br />
Government's response is the appropriate one.<br />
The recent slump in our terms of trade, which have been<br />
declining on average for decades, has served to highlight a<br />
structural weakness in our economy: our heavy reliance on<br />
primary industries and, until recently, uncompetitiveness in<br />
the manufacturing and services sectors.<br />
Growth in wcrld trade has been the engine for post-war<br />
global economic development. The most successful economies<br />
are those that have placed the greatest emphasis on<br />
export-oriented industrial strategies.<br />
Manufacturing and services have been the fastest growing<br />
sectors of world trade, yet Australia's share of world trade<br />
in manufacturos and services has been falling. However, the<br />
conditions are now to hand to enable us to strengthen our<br />
manufacturing and service industries so that they become<br />
more successful on international markets and in competing<br />
against imports.<br />
The large and fundamental depreciation of the Australian<br />
dollar has boosted our price competitiveness to levels<br />
unseen since the 1960s. As I travel around the country it<br />
is becoming clear to me that more and more businesses are<br />
coming to appreciate the opportunties that are opening up as<br />
a consequence of this change.<br />
The Government is determined to ensure that this vastly<br />
improved price competitiveness is maintained. This year's<br />
Budget and our policy of further wage restraint are vital<br />
elements in our strategy.<br />
As a further element in our strategy for economic<br />
adjustment, the Government recently convened a meeting<br />
between business and unions on work and management<br />
practices. The results of that meeting offer the prospect<br />
of a widespread improvement in co-operation between<br />
management and unions that will be invaluable in boosting<br />
productivity and thus in maintaining our competitiveness in<br />
the longer termi.<br />
At the BCA annual general meeting two weeks ago I announced<br />
a series of major initiatives designed to improve the<br />
internal workings of our economy, including the easing of<br />
export controls on a number of major mineral exports. I<br />
also announceJ a~ wide ranging review of impediments to trade<br />
competitiveness. These measures complement a range of<br />
similar steps taken over the past three years to improve<br />
Australia's flexibility and capacity to compete. </p>
<p>EP, 0fundamental element in maintaining our<br />
. ti~ nss and converting it into export sales and<br />
sutCLSSasainst imports is innovation, based on<br />
a1jy1.. periormed research and development.<br />
7-his does not mean that we will no longer need foreign<br />
technology. on the contrary, the challenge is to obtain the<br />
best foreignl technology and to combine it with the best<br />
Australian technology to develop products that embody<br />
excellence in design and quality products that can compete<br />
successfully on tough international markets.<br />
First, and most fundamentally, the Government has restored<br />
the conditions for profitability. In addition, we have<br />
taken a nualber of initiatives designed specifically to<br />
improve the convironment for innovation. We have introduced<br />
the 150 pe:: cent tax concession for research and<br />
development, together with a complementary Grants for<br />
Industry Rasearch and Development Scheme.<br />
The Government has recently accepted the thrust oE the ASTEC<br />
review of the CSIRO. The CSIRO will continue its role in<br />
applications-oriented research but will give greater<br />
emphasis to the effective transfer of the results to users.<br />
Through financial market deregulation and the tax concession<br />
for Management Investment Companies, the availability of<br />
venture capital has been increased substantially.<br />
Changes have been made to Government purchasing and offsets<br />
arrangements, which give higher priority to technology and<br />
to industrial development in Australia.<br />
we have established the Australian Trade Comamission, which<br />
is strengthening the support provided to exporting<br />
companies, particularly new exporters and those with<br />
high-technology products to offer.<br />
Further initiatives will follow shortly, when the Government<br />
receives AS-J. C's reports on the Defence Science and<br />
Technology Organisation, and on research funding in higher<br />
education. we are also awaiting the report of the Inglis<br />
Committee on government purchasing.<br />
Clearly, the Government already has done a great deal.<br />
Substantial resources have been provided. Given the<br />
constant need to restrain public sector expenditure, the<br />
ball is now in the court of organisations such as yours to<br />
make effective use of these resources.<br />
In the recent review of Australian science and technology<br />
policy by the OECD, the highest importance was placed on<br />
education and training. The OECD Examiners observed that a<br />
system of training programs which stimulated technical<br />
training and retraining within individual enterprises would<br />
be among the most important contributions of the education<br />
and training system to national economic recovery. </p>
<p>They saw the condition of Australian primary and secondary<br />
schools as critical for technological well-being. They<br />
regarded the tertiary education system as the heart of<br />
Australia's scientific and technological effort. They<br />
encouraged closer relationships between industry and<br />
education and urged greater mobility between the two. And<br />
they emphasised that on-the-job training within individual<br />
enterprises is of central importance to national<br />
technological development.<br />
I would like to take up some of these observations in<br />
addressing, in turn, the public and private sector roles in<br />
skills developnent for new technology and innovation.<br />
Public investment in education is considerable and the<br />
Government is determined to make the education system more<br />
responsive to the needs of the economy and the society<br />
generally. m~ uch has been done already. For example, there<br />
are now 145,000 more young people under the age of 25 in all<br />
forms of post-compulsory education than there were in 1983,<br />
an increase of seventeen per cent.<br />
But this is not enough in itself. For example, . our<br />
retention rates in the final years of secondary education<br />
are low by compar~ ison with other developed countries, as are<br />
our retention rates in tertiary education.<br />
Australia is now in the early stages of a fundamental<br />
economic restructuring one that will span this and the<br />
next decade and extend beyond the turn of the century. We<br />
are a nation in ransition. We must reshape our attitudes<br />
to work, to risk taking, to enterprise and to innovation.<br />
in all their pursuits Australians must strive for excellence<br />
so that they can meet and overcome the best competition in<br />
the world.<br />
But we will not be in the race unless our tertiary<br />
institutions becone more sensitive and more responsive to<br />
the needs of Australian industry. Graduates will need<br />
training and analytic skills relevant to Australian industry<br />
in transition if the nation is to succeed in revitalising<br />
its manufacturing and service industries and if we are to<br />
triumph in world markets.<br />
I see the Vice Chancellors' Committee as having an enormous<br />
responsibility in ensuring that graduates are given the<br />
training and the skills needed by emerging export-oriented<br />
manufacturing and service industries.<br />
In particular, our output of science and engineering<br />
graduates compares unfavourably, not only with other<br />
developed countries, but increasingly with the newly<br />
industrialising nations. We continue to meet our needs in<br />
computer science, for example, largely by immigration. </p>
<p>It is not just a matter of quantity of allocating a<br />
greater share of tertiary places to these disciplines -but<br />
also one of quality. Curricula should be reviewed<br />
periodically and systematically along the lines of the<br />
current CTEC review of law and engineering to ensure<br />
continuing relevance to market place needs.<br />
At the same time, consideration might be given to how<br />
universities arnd the other tertiary institutions can provide<br />
students with entrepreneurial experience and skills. In<br />
these endeavours our tertiary institutions clearly will<br />
benefit from close interaction with/ the business community.<br />
Employers have generally not been effective as a group in<br />
expressing their needs and expectations of the education<br />
system. In that regard I an, encouraged both by the<br />
convening of. this forum and the recent series of extensive<br />
discussions between representatives of the education sector<br />
and employeiL groups.<br />
Industry has indicated on a number of occasions that its<br />
access to Government and its input to decision making in<br />
education should be further expanded. I ap~ pleased to<br />
announce that the Minister for Education, Susan Ryan, will<br />
be contacting business organizations soon to propose the<br />
establishvacent of an Industry Reference Group, with direct<br />
access to the Minister. The Government looks forward to the<br />
fullest p3,; Gible private sector co-operation in this and<br />
other steps to enhance dialogue.<br />
The Minister will be improving consultative arrangements<br />
between thco education portfolio and industry, specifically<br />
by setting uip an Industry Liaison Unit within the Department<br />
of Educationi for day to day consultation.<br />
In looking at industry's responsibility in the development<br />
of technclogical skills, I want to emphasise that industry<br />
cannot absolve itself of its own direct responsibilities for<br />
education, training and retraining. Industry cannot expect<br />
the education system to produce a finished product, totally<br />
tailored to its needs. Indeed, it is essential that<br />
educational institutions provide a strong basic training,<br />
upon which particular skills can be superimposed.<br />
I think vie all acknowledge that in some industries there<br />
needs to be a substantial change in the attitude of<br />
management towards the workforce and its skills. The<br />
production workforce has a central role to play in improving<br />
innovation and productivity. In Japan, for example, it is<br />
estimated that more than sixty per cent of all innovations<br />
come fro. the shop floor.<br />
The skill and motivation of the workforce is an obvious and<br />
key factor in business competitiveness. The workforce<br />
should not be seen simply as an unavoidable cost to be<br />
reduced wherever possible. The challenges ahead of us call<br />
for the workforce to be regarded as a vital resource for<br />
future success. </p>
<p>6<br />
I am aware of several companies which have developed a<br />
constructive relationship with the workforce, one which has<br />
enabled real improvements to be made especially in work<br />
practices and product design. But, unfortunately, there is<br />
evidence that Australian management on the whole does not<br />
interact well with the workforce and does not seek to<br />
involve the workforce in product development, quality<br />
control and related aspects of innovation and productivity<br />
improvement. For example, the OECD Examiners observed that<br />
technical co-cperation between workers and management, which<br />
is common in countries such as the Federal Republic of<br />
Germany, Scandinavia and Japan, is rare in Australia.<br />
The recent BuIsiness Council paper on work practices<br />
recognises resistance to the introduction of new technology<br />
as a major source of restrictive practices and workplace<br />
rigidities. out it also recognises the importance in this<br />
respect of greater emphasis on training and on the<br />
development and utilisation of skills and concedes that<br />
management has not paid sufficient attention to these<br />
matters. Deficiencies in knowledge and education can sometimes do<br />
more to obstruct innovation and productivity improvements<br />
than shortcomings in technology and lack of investment.<br />
Turning specifically to the question of research and<br />
development, Auntralia devotes about one per cent of its<br />
gross domestic product to expenditure on R&amp; D. This is a<br />
very low figurc when compared with the leading OECD<br />
countries. Not only large countries such as the US and<br />
Japan but also countries with more comparable sized<br />
economies, such as Sweden and Switzerland, currently devote<br />
around three pc,-cent. Even so, these countries are<br />
seriously questioning whether they are investing enough<br />
public and private resources in research and development.<br />
Japan, in particular, is moving to significantly increase<br />
its basic research effort to support increased industrial<br />
growth. In Australia'G case the level of public sector investment in<br />
research and development is broadly comparable with that in<br />
most OECD countries, but the private sector compares most<br />
unfavourably. It is therefore hardly surprising that our<br />
industrial products have lacked the competitive edge, to<br />
mention one aspect that improved product quality and design<br />
can provide.<br />
Fortunately, there are encouraging signs that this situation<br />
is changing. Hlowever, it remains the case that industry<br />
investment in research and development is only a fraction of<br />
that in the countries to which I just referred.<br />
Public investment in research and development is substantial<br />
and now exceeds one billion dollars a year. Some seven<br />
hundred million dollars of this is spent in the higher<br />
education sector, primarily in universities and increasingly<br />
in the institutes of technology and some other colleges of<br />
advanced education. </p>
<p>The Government also provides substantial support for basic<br />
funding of the CSIRO, through funding of medical research<br />
where real increases in Government effort have been<br />
maintained over recent years in spite of difficult budgetary<br />
circumstanceso and-through funding of other programs in the<br />
industry arid science portfolios. In the medical research<br />
field, Aus*.. ralia has a well-deserved international<br />
reputation and a record of new product design which<br />
unfortunately has not always been followed in any<br />
significant way by local development of such products.<br />
signficant opportunities remain for those who wish to take<br />
advantage of them.<br />
The excellence and world standing of much of the scientific<br />
research conducted in Australian universities is not<br />
questioned. This is particularly true when the best<br />
researchers have the resources to build strong<br />
multidiscipl-inary teams and have the infrastructure and<br />
equipment necessary to sustain the effort.<br />
A good example is the success of the Special Research<br />
Centres Scheme, for which the Government has recently<br />
extended suwport. Centres such as the Joint<br />
Microelectronics Research Centre and the Adelaide Centre for<br />
Gene Techno.-hgy have attracted industry funding and<br />
stimulated greater university-industry research interaction.<br />
To link these research functions to the commercial world,<br />
all universities now have a commercial arm, usually a<br />
separate comnpany, which acts as a broker between the<br />
university's researchers and companies which can develop,<br />
manufacture and market their ideas.<br />
Let me take a few of the success stories. The " bionic ear"<br />
was developed at Melbourne University and commercialised,<br />
with the aid of Government public interest grants, by<br />
Nucleus Ltd. The device provides hearing for people who are<br />
profoundly fierve deaf. The current world market is<br />
estimated at 220,000 units. But further technical<br />
refinements could make it applicable to lesser degrees of<br />
deafness, with substantially increased market prospects.<br />
Sales are expected to be around $ 5.5 million in 1986, rising<br />
to $ 50 milion by 1990.<br />
At the University of Melbourne a blood test has been<br />
developed for the detection of breast cancer, a major killer<br />
of Australian women. The test developed by the Research<br />
Centre for Cancer and Transplantation helps the early<br />
diagnosis of breast cancer, and in tracking the course of<br />
the diseas; e. It was recently licensed to Australian<br />
Med-Research Industries and provided the basis for the<br />
launch of a public company, Integrated medical Technologies.<br />
Scientist6 at the ANU have invented a way of genetically<br />
modifying yeast which is being developed with funds provided<br />
by the Food Division of Burns Philp. The outcome of this<br />
work is expected to be a range of significantly improved<br />
biotechnology products that will let the company penetrate<br />
increasingly competitive international markets. </p>
<p>The ANU is also finalising agreements with Forensic Science<br />
Technology International and Melko Electronics manufacturing<br />
in Victoria to develop new instrumentation and chemical<br />
technology for forensic science use throughout the world.<br />
The ANU's Fcrensic Science Research unit has been working<br />
with police forensic-. science departments in Australia to<br />
develop the device.<br />
A number of other exciting developments could be mentioned,<br />
like Murdoch University's bromide battery ( which has<br />
attracted about $ 5 million in development funds) and<br />
Queensland University's fermentation process for converting<br />
sugar to alcohol. obviously, the research of our<br />
universities does provide the basis for commercial<br />
development by the private sector.<br />
No doubt the potential exists for much more variation and<br />
specialisation in and between our universities. Resources<br />
need to be uscd flexibly so that each university develops a<br />
more distinctive character and selectively concentrates its<br />
research in key areas.<br />
The Vice Chancellors are the key people in initiating such<br />
major changes so that each university perceives its role and<br />
manages its research activities.<br />
Bringing together now the various strands of the thoughts I<br />
have put to you, I believe that there is an emerging<br />
awareness of the value of the substantial public investment<br />
in higher education research and the role it can play in our<br />
industrial competitiveness. To foster this awareness it is<br />
essential that the universities more vigorously make their<br />
research skills and activities known to industry and further<br />
develop mechanisms which facilitate the flow of information<br />
and skills to and from industry.<br />
Interaction between universities and industry also can be<br />
assisted by increasing the mobility of research and<br />
development personnel in both directions. Institutional<br />
barriers can limit this interchange and I hope that you all<br />
will work to remove them.<br />
Industry, has, of course, a major role of its own in<br />
research and development. However, except in the largest<br />
companies, there will continue to be considerable reliance<br />
on the public research infrastructure for specific aspects<br />
of research expertise. In that way research and development<br />
capacity within the individual firms can be supplemented and<br />
made much more effective.<br />
This is recognised in some of the proposals and initiatives<br />
set out in you., own report. The tax concession for research<br />
and development is encouraging such interaction. Early<br />
evidence suggests that companies are more frequently using<br />
university staff as consultants and contracting research to<br />
universities. </p>
<p>9<br />
Increasingly, all companies will have to innovate in order<br />
to survive. Greater innovation and competitiveness in<br />
Australian industry will demand changed attitudes in<br />
corporate managementd<br />
These challencL's Will involve a longer term approach aimed<br />
at gaining and improving market share, particularly<br />
overseas. They will demand a reputation for promptness,<br />
quality and reliability. Significant investment will be<br />
necessary in research and development, production systems<br />
and marketing.<br />
The recent PA Consultants' technology surveys of management<br />
attitudes in Australia underline the change that is<br />
required. Ir. comparison with those in leading countries,<br />
Australian boards and top management appear to lack strength<br />
in both technological and marketing skills. The surveys<br />
show limited awareness on the part of boards of the<br />
importance oi technology, innovation and research and<br />
development to their future competitive survival and<br />
perceive resealrch and development as a reluctant tactical<br />
necessity rathc , r than a key element of their business<br />
strategy. The drive for 3tructural change in our economy involving<br />
export orientation will succeed only if large companies make<br />
these changes i~ n strategy and attitude and adopt the<br />
necessary approaches to innovation and research. Those of<br />
you here from the Business Council are in key positions to<br />
effect this change.<br />
Similarly, the. Vice Chancellors' Committee has the very<br />
great respons4ibility I referred to earlier to ensure that<br />
the allocation of tertiary places, the design of courses and<br />
the specialisation in coursework and research between our<br />
tertiary institutions, reflects the needs of Australia's<br />
emerging manufacturing and service industries.<br />
Let me closc by saying that I am convinced Australia has the<br />
capacity to compete successfully in the increasingly complex<br />
and difficult international trading environment.<br />
But to do so requires a concerted effort from us all. We<br />
must discard maany of the attitudes and practices of the past<br />
and adopt new ones for the future.<br />
The resulting teamwork will involve the closest possible<br />
interaction between individual firms and universities. it<br />
will require the personal commitment of each of you.<br />
I wish you well in your forthcoming discussions and hope<br />
that the current forum will be followed by others in due<br />
course. My Government stands ready to join with you<br />
constructively in the important task ahead. </p>
