3 JUNE 1991<br />
E OE PROOF ONLY<br />
PM: I have a Caucus meeting at 11.30. That will set the<br />
duration of this meeting. I'll make a brief statement, it<br />
is to this effect. Firstly, I am grateful to my Caucus<br />
colleagues for the significant vote of confidence that they<br />
have given me. The second thing is to thank Paul Keating<br />
for the tremendous service he's given to this country as<br />
Treasurer and providing me with what I've said has been, I<br />
think, one of the outstanding combinations in post-war<br />
politics. It goes without saying that. I am sad to see the<br />
end of that combination but the course of events has made<br />
that necessary. Paul accepted the decision graciously,<br />
congratulated me and indicated there would be no further<br />
challenge from him. The task now, as I told the Caucus, is<br />
to set about the task of healing the wounds which<br />
undoubtedly have occurred in my Party during this process.<br />
I believe that that is the wish of the overwhelming<br />
majority, not: merely of my Parliamentary colleagues, it is<br />
certainly the view of the Party at large and I expect it<br />
would be the wish of the community in general. They would<br />
want us to put this behind us so that we can get on<br />
concentrating on the task of running this country. The<br />
Labor Party will now be able to focus on its true opponents<br />
those are the Liberal and the National Party Coalition<br />
who I believe provide a disastrous prescription for the<br />
future of this country and I am determined to do everything<br />
within my capacity to lead my Party to victory in 1993. So<br />
that's where we are. I simply say finally that I had made<br />
up my mind before this ballot that I thought I should cancel<br />
my proposed overseas visit and I have so made that decision.<br />
It is a pity that I can't go ahead with it because there<br />
were important meetings with European leaders in regard to<br />
the question of the Uruguay Round. I will have to see how<br />
those things can be covered whether by correspondence or in<br />
some other ways. But I believe and I think the Australian<br />
people would accept that the appropriate course of action<br />
for me is to stay here now and, as I say, get on with this<br />
task of reuniting the Party and providing Australia with the<br />
Government that they require.<br />
JOURNALIST: inaudible<br />
PM: Should he? </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: inaudible<br />
PM: No that's a question for Paul. He has made the<br />
decision which obviously he had to make in terms of the<br />
position of Deputy Prime Minister and the Ministry. That<br />
was the only decision he could make. What he does about<br />
staying in or leaving the Parliament's for him and I'm<br />
certainly not seeking his departure.<br />
JOURNALIST: inaudible<br />
PM: Well all I can say is that if I look back on the Press<br />
for the last few days you people set the parameters, you<br />
said I need 20, well I got 22. So I am confident that the<br />
Party knows what the right approach is and I accept what<br />
Paul says that he will not be making a challenge, nor do I<br />
think he'd be encouraging any acts along those lines.<br />
JOURNALIST: Who will be the new Treasurer?<br />
PM: I am the Treasurer. I've just done that. It's<br />
something I hadn't anticipated was necessary. That<br />
interests you doesn't it. I thought I could appoint an<br />
acting one but I can't because when there is no Treasurer<br />
there can't be someone acting for someone who doesn't exist.<br />
It came as a great surprise to me so I am Treasurer for the<br />
day. I trust I get some decent Balance of Payments figures.<br />
JOURNALIST: Do you want Mr Howe to be your Deputy?<br />
PM: I beg your pardon.<br />
JOURNALIST: Do you want Mr Howe as your Deputy?<br />
PM: I think that will be the outcome and I think he'll make<br />
a great Deputy.<br />
JOURNALIST: Will there be a Cabinet reshuffle?<br />
PM: Well by definition there has to be some. I don't think<br />
there needs to be much. I make it clear about the Treasury.<br />
I have no ambitions or intentions to hold a duality of<br />
portfolios. Prime Minister's enough.<br />
JOURNALIST: When do you think..<br />
PM: It'll be fairly quickly, Michelle, fairly quickly.<br />
JOURNALIST: going stay now until the next election.<br />
What are your plans after that?<br />
PM: I beg your pardon.<br />
JOURNALIST: stay now until the next election. What are<br />
your plans after that? </p>
<p>PM: I have to win it and fight on. Now we'll come to that.<br />
Now I'm going to be fighting this election in 1993. Now<br />
what I'll be saying about that that's down the<br />
JOURNALIST: why you reneged on your promise to leave at<br />
a time which would give Paul Keating reasonable time to take<br />
over? PM: This is not something that gives me great pleasure but<br />
it's going have to be dealt with here and I guess in the<br />
Parliament. Let me say this very briefly and as<br />
unabrasively ass I can. The situation arose in 1988, the<br />
meeting, because Paul believed we couldn't win the iggo<br />
election and he thought he should have a turn as Prime<br />
Minister. It's understandable. But I believed that we<br />
could win the 1990 election and I said so and I intended to<br />
fight it and .1 thought I was the best to win it. Paul had<br />
some view that perhaps he might leave if he was not Prime<br />
Minister. I didn't want him to leave and so reluctantly,<br />
but nevertheless I did it reluctantly in those circumstances<br />
of keeping him on because I thought it was best that he stay<br />
on. I said that if we won, as I believed we would, then I<br />
would retire during the fourth term. Those were the<br />
circumstances. I must say in all this one of the<br />
unfortunate things has been the misrepresentations that have<br />
taken place about that meeting. There are some who know the<br />
truth and I'm talking about the media as well who up until<br />
last night refused to accept it and perpetrated an untruth.<br />
The fact is that that meeting was the initiative of Bill<br />
Kelty and the people at it were the initiative of Bill<br />
Kelty. That's by the way, it's an incidental. So I gave<br />
that undertaking for those reasons. It was because Paul<br />
thought he should have his turn back there in the last<br />
period of government in a situation where he thought we<br />
couldn't win -the next one. Now I don't want to go over the<br />
unpleasant episodes of the end of 1990, the beginning of<br />
this year because despite all this, as I've said privately<br />
to Paul, I do have respect and I hope I'll still be able to<br />
have friendship with him. So I only go to these things to<br />
the extent that it's necessary to answer obvious questions<br />
that are in your minds and in the minds of the people. What<br />
did happen at the end of 1990 and the first part of ' 91 I<br />
couldn't accept and on that basis I said that that<br />
undertaking was off and I did this within the context that I<br />
believed then as I do now profoundly that I am the person<br />
best placed to lead the Labor Party to victory in 1993.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke when you told the Australian<br />
people that you would stay a full term in your mind at<br />
that stage hadl you decided you wouldn't honour the agreement<br />
with Mr Keating<br />
PM: No I hadn't. No, I intended to honour it and<br />
JOURNALIST: So you were misleading the Australian people at<br />
that stage? </p>
<p>PM: Well we've covered that. Let me say I harboured some<br />
hope that Paul may come to see that that would be the best<br />
outcome, that I should go on. I did harbour that hope and I<br />
regretted, I regretted having to say what I did. The facts<br />
are you know the truth and the reality of this that as did<br />
the people at the meeting that if I'd gone to the electorate<br />
in 1990 saying that I was only going to serve part of the<br />
term and they were voting for Paul Keating we would not have<br />
won the election. That was accepted. As I say I am<br />
reluctant to have to handle it the way I did, it was not of<br />
my making, it occurred for the reasons that I've put, I<br />
didn't like having to do what I did. As I say, I harboured<br />
the hope that Paul may come to see if things didn't change<br />
that it would be best that I go on. Let me say this, if I<br />
had believed at any stage during the term of this Government<br />
that Paul, or anyone else for that matter, had a better<br />
chance of leading the Labor Party to victory I wouldn't have<br />
needed anyone coming to knock on my door. I've been Prime<br />
Minister for a long period of time. It would be very much<br />
personally easier for me to retire. I certainly could<br />
honourably make more money outside of Parliament than I do<br />
in it. I have a wife and three children and six<br />
grandchildren whom I adore, and I would comfortably spend<br />
very much more time with them. The only reason that I stay<br />
is because I believe that I have the best chance of leading<br />
this Party to victory. And interestingly, as you would<br />
observe, although some of your editors didn't seem to want<br />
to give it the prominence that it deserved, the facts<br />
weren't there, overwhelmingly all the evidence of recent<br />
days is that that's a view which is shared both by my Party<br />
and by the people of Australia.<br />
JOURNALIST: said isn't that that you told a lie in<br />
order to win the<br />
PM: Paul, the number of times I mean and you'll<br />
keep on writing that. I've explained<br />
JOURNALIST: But do you concede that point?<br />
PM: Paul, you've heard my explanation. I told you<br />
JOURNALIST: Would you concede that point?<br />
PM: I have given you my explanation. Look you will do the<br />
interpretation Paul. You will do the interpretation. Let<br />
me repeat, I have said that I made a commitment to Paul at<br />
that meeting for the reasons that I said. I regret that I<br />
have to, in those circumstances in the election, to have<br />
said what was not the case. That is that I would serve a<br />
full term. I had the hope that if the situation didn't<br />
change in terms of the perceptions of Paul's capacity to<br />
win, that he may come to understand that it wasn't in the<br />
best interests of the Party but I had given him that<br />
commitment. You will have noticed that at no point since<br />
that discussion has been revealed have I avoided that<br />
point. So it is the case that what I was saying to the<br />
electorate did not represent the understanding I had with </p>
<p>him. But as I say, I harboured the hope that if things went<br />
on and it remained abundantly clear that I was the best<br />
chance for the Party's success in the next election then he<br />
would come to understand that. He didn't come to that view.<br />
But as I say, in the event the circumstances at the end of<br />
1990, beginning of ' 91 made me believe that I no longer was<br />
in a position where I should adhere to that undertaking.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, do you think you owe the Australian<br />
people some apology for<br />
PM: All I can say, Michelle, about your perception of what<br />
you think I owe the Australian people or do not owe, I'd<br />
simply suggest: that this issue has been overwhelmingly<br />
before the Australian people in the last few days. It could<br />
hardly be said that it's been kept a secret from them.<br />
JOURNALIST: I~ t was for a few years.<br />
PM: Just a minute. I wonder whether I could finish<br />
JOURNALIST: inaudible.<br />
PM: I wonder whether I could finish the answer I'm giving.<br />
Do you mind? Thank you very much. So kind of you. I<br />
suggest that there was no way that in the last few days the<br />
Australian people could be having the view that they didn't<br />
know the issuets. You've elaborately put them all before<br />
them and in their knowledge and, may I say, not only in<br />
their knowledge but in my Party members' knowledge of all<br />
the events, they are making their view clear as to what<br />
their preferences are. So as I have been throughout my<br />
public career, which is now over 30 years on, I will be<br />
content to go before the Australian people, you won't find<br />
me dodging the Australian people. I will, as I've done in<br />
the past, more than any other Prime Minister in the history<br />
of this country go in to meet the Australian people in their<br />
workplaces, in their shopping places, where they assemble, I<br />
will meet them directly and with the confidence that I have<br />
in the past and I believe that they will continue to show in<br />
the future the respect for me and the confidence that they<br />
have in the past.<br />
JOURNALIST: in the Left faction.<br />
PM: I beg your pardon.<br />
JOURNALIST: This must certainly mean that they'll have more<br />
influence in economic policy along the lines of the<br />
submissions put to you<br />
PM: it doesn't mean anything of the sort. What's very<br />
interesting that you should note if you really understood<br />
what's been happening in this Parliament and in this<br />
Government over a period of time is that the Left have<br />
become a more significant contributor not just to economic<br />
policy but to policy generally than they were in the early<br />
days. There wras almost a sense in the early days of some </p>
<p>confrontationism but I think very largely due to the way I<br />
conduct affairs the Left has come to understand that this is<br />
a reformist Government with which they are proud to identify<br />
and they have made a very significant contribution. I<br />
brought Brian Howe into the ERC some time back, many years<br />
back, they say Paul didn't agree with it at the time he<br />
came to and the Left have come to make a positive and<br />
constructive contribution. It's not as though they're<br />
coming out of the cold. They have been constructive. The<br />
way this Government has operated for some period of time now<br />
is that the factions, they have their differences on things,<br />
but basically we come to consensus positions. I think that<br />
will continue. one more question, one more, one more<br />
question. Yes.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, doesn't it concern you at all that<br />
you're at least going to be perceived as having deceived the<br />
Australian public up to a few days ago?<br />
PM: Well thanks for the original question. I've really<br />
answered it.<br />
JOURNALIST: But isn't the heart of the issue?<br />
PM: I don't know whether you know the rules. We don't have<br />
a debate here. You ask a question, I give an answer.<br />
Right, you've asked your question, now I'll give you the<br />
answer. Good. You understand the rules.<br />
JOURNALIST: inaudible.<br />
PM: Wait a minute. You would know the rules. I'm giving<br />
him his answer. Let me give it to him. Now the fact is, as<br />
I've said, the Australian people have been inundated, if I<br />
may say, not all too objectively by some, but the public<br />
have been given a full exposition, in many cases a totally<br />
misleading exposition about the 1988 meeting, untruths have<br />
been told about that but by now they are well and truly<br />
exposed. Now the people have been fed all the information<br />
including my commitment in 1988 and they are making their<br />
Judgements clear and their reactions now and most<br />
importantly my Party is. And as I said I have no fear<br />
whatsoever about going out and meeting the Australian<br />
people. I love meeting them. I will continue to do it. I<br />
have no apprehension whatsoever. Ok. I've got a meeting.<br />
ends </p>
