<p>The Australian Government welcomes UN Security Council Resolution 2094 which responds to North Korea's nuclear test on 12 February 2013. </p>
<p>As a Security Council member, Australia worked closely with fellow Council members and international partners to pursue a strong response to North Korea's provocative and dangerous actions.</p>
<p>This resolution sends a clear message to North Korea that the international community will respond robustly to such actions. </p>
<p>North Korea's nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs pose a threat to international peace and security, and to the stability of the Asia-Pacific region.</p>
<p>Pyongyang's actions clearly demonstrate an intention to strengthen this capability.</p>
<p>This resolution breaks new ground for the Security Council on North Korea.</p>
<p>It builds on and expands Security Council Resolutions 1718 (2006), 1874 (2009) and 2087 (2013), with new sanctions to further constrain North Korea's nuclear and ballistic missile programs, and significant new financial and travel sanctions.</p>
<p>We call on North Korea to abide by this resolution and its international obligations, and engage with the international community through negotiation, not provocation.</p>
<p>We also urge North Korea to respond constructively to South Korean President Park Geun-hye's call for it to cease its nuclear program and provocations, so that trust can be developed on the Korean Peninsula.</p>
