PRDIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 20 MAY, 1979<br />
ISSUE OF NATIONAL FLAGS<br />
The Prime Minister has written to Premiers and to the Chief<br />
Minister of the Northern Territory, outlining the<br />
Government's decision to extend the free issue of the<br />
Australian Flag.<br />
For many years the Government has issued the National Flag<br />
free to schools, orphanages, recognised youth organisations<br />
and National and State sporting bodies. This has helped<br />
to foster, particularly in young people, respect for and<br />
familiarity with the National Flag and a knowledge of<br />
its correct use.<br />
In response to wide national interest in the flying of the<br />
Australian Flag the Government has decided to extend the<br />
official free-issue of the Flag. From 1 July the<br />
following additional groups will be eligible:<br />
Community service groups, including ex-service<br />
organisations, Apex, Lions, Rotary, senior<br />
citizens' clubs, and the Country Women's<br />
Association; Benevolent and welfare organisations including<br />
Red Cross and Legacy;<br />
Homes for handicapped persons;<br />
Church and religious bodies;<br />
Ethnic organisations, and<br />
Sporting clubs.<br />
All requests for the National Flag'should be made through<br />
a member of the Commonwealth Parliament.<br />
It is estimated that nearly 2,000 free-issue flags will be<br />
distributed to eligible groups during the current financial<br />
year. This number will increase-considerably when the new<br />
groups become eligible.<br />
Arrangements are being made for tenders to be called with<br />
Australian Flag manufacturers for the supply of flags to meet<br />
the expected future demand. Funds will be allocated in the<br />
Budget for this need. / 2 </p>

Since last November the Government has also been<br />
distributing free cassettes of special recordings of the<br />
National Anthem " God Save the Queen" and the National Tune<br />
" Advance Australia Fair" to the groups now eligible to<br />
receive the free-issue flag. As from 1 July this free<br />
issue of cassettes will be extended to those new groups eligible<br />
to receive the National Flag. Requests for these cassettes<br />
should also be made to a member of the Commonwealth Parliament.<br />
The Government has also arranged for the production of new<br />
colour photographs of Her Majesty. the Queen for distribution<br />
within the community. These are new photographs showing the<br />
Queen wearing the insignia of the Sovereign Head of the Order<br />
of Australia. Copies of these photographs are available free<br />
to any group, association or person in the community who will<br />
display them in a proper and dignified manner. Requests<br />
can be made through a member of the Commonwealth Parliament<br />
or to the Department of my colleague, the Minister for<br />
Administrative Services who has separately announced that his<br />
Department will have responsibility for the distribution of<br />
all these items.<br />
These are all matters which contribute to the identity of<br />
Australia as a nation. The Government's initiative in making<br />
them available serves to meet the wishes of the community.<br />
