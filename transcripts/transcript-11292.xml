    <content><![CDATA[<p>  Today I chaired the inaugural meeting of the Prime Minister's Community<br />
   Business Partnership which has been established to foster partnerships<br />
   between business, government and the community to develop practical ideas<br />
   for helping people in need.</p>
<p>  The Business and Community Partnerships initiative has been steadily gaining<br />
   momentum since I convened a round table meeting of distinguished business<br />
   and community leaders in March last year.</p>
<p>  We are building on the Australian ethos of helping each other in times of<br />
   need to develop a strong and lasting tradition of corporate philanthropy<br />
   and community participation.</p>
<p>  The willingness of these 11 high profile Australians to participate in the<br />
   Community Business Partnership is testament to their enthusiasm to<br />
   find new ways to support the community and to maximise the benefits to Australia<br />
   of a new social coalition.</p>
<p>  I commend them for their support and commitment.</p>
<p>  The social coalition is about drawing on the expertise and resources of<br />
   the various sectors of Australian society, including government, business,<br />
   individuals and the community sector, to address problems that cannot be<br />
   solved by one sector working alone.</p>
<p>  It is only through a partnership approach that we can come up with real<br />
   solutions.</p>
<p>  The recent Regional Summit has highlighted the need for us to pay particular<br />
   attention to the needs of rural and regional Australia, and this will be<br />
   one of the areas of focus for the Community Business Partnership.</p>
<p>  The Community Business Partnership agreed to adopt a mission statement<br />
   which focuses on fostering a tradition of the Australian business and non-profit<br />
   sectors working together in partnership for mutual benefit and the benefit<br />
   of the Australian community.</p>
<p>  The list of members of Community Business Partnership is attached.</p>
