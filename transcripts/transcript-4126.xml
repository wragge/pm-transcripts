PRIME MINISTER<br />

PRIME MINISTER'S INTERVIEW WITH LAURIE WILSON, FOR " THIS WEEK"<br />
QUPTION: Mr Fraser, from your point of view, just what have you managed<br />
to do, with this mini-buget?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: We've taken very substantial steps in bringing<br />
forward Government expenditures back into line with reality,<br />
with What tax payers can afford. This is quite essential<br />
if inflation is to be overcome. In addition to that,<br />
we've introduced tax indexation that does two things:<br />
we believe it will help to relieve pressure on wages because<br />
when people got more wages they went into higher tax<br />
brackets, that generated more pressure for more wage rises.<br />
It was a constant merry-go-round. Tax indexation will also keep<br />
governments honest if we want more of people's incomes for a<br />
particular projecc or for government plans, we'll have to<br />
legislate for it, and explain why. That's good. And the<br />
third the Medibank levy, of course. Medibank is an<br />
expensive Droazrafe which we believe needs to be seen to be<br />
paid for. The last part in the total package was the new<br />
system of family allowances which I regard as a major social reform.<br />
QUESTION: There would seem to be overall, more of an emphasis on the'<br />
social conten in the budget, rather than the economic side.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:. : I don't think so because $ 2,600 million reduction and<br />
relief on the budget itself for the next financial year is<br />
a very significant economic measure. And in addition to that,<br />
you've got taxindexation, Medibank and the family allowances.<br />
Now the family allowances are already being paid for out of<br />
Othe abolicion of tax rebates; and the old sums that went to<br />
child endowment. So, it's a reorganisation of the social<br />
welfare area of a very important time. But it's not within<br />
greatly additional resources into that area.<br />
QUESTION: In terms, you're talking about reorganisation, it strikes<br />
me in terms of the amount of extra cash that people have got,<br />
it really does seem that all you've done there is realise<br />
too, reshuffle, in the sense that people really don't seem<br />
to be any better off.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Well it depends on who you're looking at. If you are<br />
looking at the 300,000 families and the 800,000 children or<br />
more in a very low income area, probably not able to get </p>
<p>any advantage out of the tax rebate system, they're going<br />
to be much better off. Quite obviously the total resources of<br />
Australia are limited, and wE can't provide additional assistance<br />
to families in these categories unless it comes from somebody else<br />
and -that can't be hidden. But the main transfer is really from<br />
government back to the private sector. Anid that's what<br />
cct: pes out of the reduction in the demands on the budget of<br />
$ 2,600 million. So it's really the government that's giving<br />
up most in this context, rather than any one group of individuals.<br />
QUESTION: ' But you accept the point that the middle and upper income<br />
earners really don't appear to be better off, even if not....<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Well they certainly won't be worse off, with the total<br />
package, Medibanrk tLhrow,, n in. And also you've got to understand<br />
that tax indexation is a continuing process, because of the<br />
way-the law is drawn, next year it will be automatic again.<br />
And in year 2 and year 3, instead of the extra tax take<br />
go1ingC to the gover-nment, people will be keeping a larger part<br />
: or cheir income. So on a continuing process individual tax<br />
payers will become bet-ter off, an~ d the years pass.<br />
QUESTION: Wha t really have you got to bargain with the unions with.<br />
Given that any benefit they seem to have been given, does<br />
a~ oear really to lbe allusory?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:. No I don't think it's allusory. Everyone knows that<br />
MediAbank has to be paid for. You can't introduce a major<br />
government prograrre of that kind and pretend that you don't<br />
have to raise extra taxes, or. payments in some way to cover<br />
the cost of the benefit. It's just nonsense to pretend that<br />
you can. What all Australians, trade unions and everyone else have<br />
gained out of this is tax indexation, to protect their incomes<br />
in the future, and also a just and proper system of family allowa* s<br />
QUESTION: Yes, but why-should wage earners moderate their wage claims<br />
now that they are protected against inflation by tax indexation.<br />
I mean, what have you got to argue with?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I think there's a great deal. Because there's a real<br />
element of economic and social justice in what we're doing.<br />
Basically, most Australians want a job. And trade unionists<br />
are having to understand, and leading spokesmen in the trade<br />
union miovement are coming to understand, that there is a very<br />
real connection between wage demands, that are too high, inflation<br />
and unemployment. There is not much fun in getting higher wages,<br />
ff your mate next door loses his job.<br />
QUESTION: it terms of the average employee though. he's going to look<br />
at what you've done, he's going to say, well, I may be<br />
getting more in my pay packet, but I'm paying out more for<br />
Medibank I'm really not getting any more. I have to keep<br />
coming back to this point, that you're talking about the lot of<br />
a wage earner having-been improved, but he in simple dollars<br />
and cents terms is not going to see it that way. And therefore,<br />
how can you expect him in' return... </p>
<p>don't<br />
? RIME MINISTER: I/ think he Jis going to see it that way, because<br />
I think most peo~ le are going to understand that something<br />
like Medibank has to be paid for by somebody. At the same time)<br />
it needs to be enphasised that those on the lower income<br />
groups, under Medibank, won't be paying all that much it's<br />
atkt-Zhe higher middle and higher income levels where the<br />
levy. obviously takes more of their income. Just because its<br />
f a percentage basis. But I think the basis of your question,<br />
lies in the fact that you're not giving sufficient credibility<br />
i. the common sense of the average Australian. We've got<br />
a situation, quite clearly, I believe where people on the shop<br />
floor, working right around Australia, understand, the basic<br />
facts of life. That Governments have got nothing of their own<br />
to give or to provide. They can only provide what comes from<br />
other people. We have to live within our means as individuals,<br />
as a family and as a nation. The realism in the' Treasurer's<br />
statement last week, indicates plainly that we're taking all<br />
Australia towards realism in what people can expect from<br />
g-overnm=_-ents. And at the same time doing it in a way that is<br />
justand fair for individual taxpayers.<br />
IOUNE: In terms of the economy, are you working towards some sort<br />
U of ec= nomic timetable aiming at a level of unemployment or<br />
a level of inflation within 18 months, 2 years.<br />
' IRIME MINISTER: Wqell we're certainly aiming at getting inflation down,<br />
unemployment down, but I don't think it makes much sense ot<br />
nr) o= mnate specific targets, economies don't work that<br />
way. it's not a nice, precise equation. It depends on the<br />
reactions of many thousands of people right around the country.<br />
The meeting that we're going to have with the trade union<br />
movement in two or three weeks time will be significant.<br />
The attitude that the unions take to the future of wage<br />
increases will be significant. If we could guarantee that their<br />
attitude will be -moderated, and if a decision shortly to come<br />
from te Arbitation Commission is also going to be moderate,<br />
then I think that will given enormous confidence, to industry<br />
to investors, coming on top of what we've just done. Then I<br />
think we'll start to see the economy moving much quicker, jobs<br />
being created much quicker.<br />
? UESTION: You seem in your address to the nation last Monday night,<br />
you seem to have concentrated that it really is essential<br />
to get the cooperation of the union movment, in wage moderation,<br />
for your package to work. Now if you don't, then what's<br />
the outlook then?<br />
' RILME MINISTER: We need the cooperation of everyone in the country in a<br />
sense. I made it quite plain that the responsibilities on the<br />
government will be accepted and we'll act to them. And I think<br />
waht we've done has shown that. But people can't just leave<br />
it to people in Federal Parliament to say, the future of the<br />
country doesn't'concern the rest of us. Everyone has a role<br />
to play and the trade union movement has a role to play, as has<br />
the ACTU. And this again is becoming more widely recognised.<br />
I'm not going to make any undue predictions, about what comes<br />
out of those discussion we'll just have to wait and see.<br />
But we have, by the measures we've taken, given Australia, I </p>
<p>believe, an unparalleled opportunity to break inflation,<br />
and really to get this country moving forward.<br />
QUESTION: Yes, but it still comes back to that point how dependent<br />
for that are you on the union movement?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: If there isn't cooperation, it's just going to make<br />
our job harder. If we all work together towards one<br />
objective, it's obviously much easier to achieve. The<br />
basic objectives of preserving and improving-* living standards,<br />
the basic objectives of seeing that there are jobs for all<br />
those who want to work. What the government has done is to<br />
show that it is concerned, not just for these economaic<br />
realities, but it is also concerned for a very real measure<br />
of social justice. It's introduced maybe, the most far<br />
reaching social reform, certainly iA* n my ti* me in Parliament,<br />
maybe going back much further than that. This tends, I<br />
believe to set a climate where we can talk to the trade union<br />
~ movement, with a greater expectation of a good result<br />
