FOR PRESS: PM. No. 65/ 1971<br />
SPRINGBOK TOUR<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister, Mr William McMahon<br />
The Prime Minister ( Mr McMahon) said today<br />
that the Government had decided it want-ed th( South African Airways<br />
flight bringing the Springboks to Australia serviced at Perth airport<br />
in the normal way. As a precautionary measure, it had also decided that<br />
it will make arrangements, if necessary, for the flight to be refuelled<br />
for its departure from Perth. South African Airways have been<br />
informed of this decision. The flight is due to arrive at Perth early tomorrow<br />
morning ( Saturday). The Prime Minister also said that RAAF transport<br />
assistance will be available if necessary to convey the team to South<br />
Australia. These decisions have been taken by the Government<br />
in conformity with its stated policy that it regarded the visit of sporting<br />
teams as a non-political matter to be arranged between the sporting<br />
bodies concerned. It is the Government's view that this should not be<br />
prevented or prejudiced by some groups within the trade union<br />
movement. Australians are renowned for their fine sporting<br />
instincts and sense of fair play.<br />
I ask all Australians to show these great qualities<br />
during the visit of the Springboks.<br />
