    <content><![CDATA[<p>The President of Indonesia, Joko Widodo, called me this afternoon to express regret that his visit, planned for 6-8 November, will have to be rescheduled, as a result of the security situation in Jakarta which requires his personal attention.</p>
<p>I said we were sorry we would not be able to welcome him to Australia tomorrow but entirely understood the need for him to remain in Indonesia at this time.</p>
<p>President Widodo thanked me for Australia’s understanding and noted his desire to conduct the visit as soon as mutually convenient dates can be identified.</p>
<p>The President told me that he had asked his Foreign Minister to make the necessary arrangements with Foreign Minister Bishop.</p>
<p>We both expressed disappointment that the visit would not go ahead, particularly given the strength of the bilateral relationship and our personal friendship.</p>
<p>While disappointing, we agreed the postponement will not affect the need for continued and enhanced cooperation across a range of shared interests and challenges, including the threat of terrorism to our region.</p>
<p>We will continue to negotiate the Indonesia-Australia Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement, which will unlock business opportunities for Australian companies in Indonesia and drive stronger commercial ties with South-East Asia’s largest economy.</p>
