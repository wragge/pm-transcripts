F77/ 197 Q<br />
. i,, AUSTRALIA~<br />
FOR PRESS 8 SEPTEMBER 1977<br />
MISREPRESENTATION<br />
The Prime Minister made the followi ng statement in the House<br />
this afternoon:<br />
" With your indulgence, Mr. Deputy Speaker, for the sake of<br />
accuracy, I should like to add to an answer I gave to a question<br />
asked this morning.<br />
This morning the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr. Whitlam)<br />
said that I had used a single line quotation from the Flowers<br />
Report. The single line quotation, as he indicated in his<br />
question, was as follows:<br />
" We are confident that an acceptable solution will be found."<br />
The sentence that the Leader of the Opposition read out this<br />
morning was not in my speech announcing the Government's uranium<br />
decision. It is contained in two background papers. It appears<br />
at page 5 of the paper headed " Health and Safety Aspects of<br />
Nuclear Power Generation" and at page 4 of the document " Uranium-<br />
Your Questions Answered". The Leader of the Opposition indicated<br />
that only one line from the Flowers Report had been quoted and<br />
that the quotation omitted several other sentences. The facts<br />
are quite different.<br />
The quotation con tained in the background papers came from<br />
paragraph 181 of the Flowers Report. The sentences which the<br />
Leader of the Opposition claimed I had omitted came from<br />
paragraph 504 of the Flowers Report 111 pages later. As<br />
I was using a quotation from paragraph 181, it is not surprising<br />
that the quotation that the Leader of the Opposition used, which<br />
came from paragraph 504 111 pages later was not included in<br />
the original quotation. Obviously, the quotation from paragraph<br />
504 was not a part of the quotation contained in the background<br />
documents. As I have indicated, the quotation from the Flowers Report which<br />
was contained in the background papers was not a " single<br />
sentence one line" as the Leader of the Opposition so<br />
misleadingly described it. It was an extensive quotation<br />
from the Flowers Report together with a further sentence<br />
summarising the attitude towards waste isolation which had<br />
been expressed in the Flowers Report. / Let me </p>
<p>-2<br />
Let me read the quotation which appeared in the background.<br />
documents. It was as follows:<br />
" There are various proposals for the permanent storage of<br />
the solidified wastes under the ocean beds or in deep<br />
geological formations where they will be virtually<br />
inaccessible. Much research is needed ( though still on<br />
a very modest scale compared with that on reactors) to<br />
establish the safety and the feasibility of such methods.<br />
We are confident that an acceptable solution will be<br />
found<br />
The. Leader of the Opposition suggested that the only sentence that<br />
had been used was as follows:<br />
" We are confident that an acceptable solution will be<br />
found."<br />
The following additional sentence appears in the background documents:<br />
" The Commission goes on to recommend that there should be no<br />
commitment to fission power on a massive scale until at least<br />
one method for safe isolation has been demonstrated beyond<br />
reasonable doubt."<br />
In other parts of the Flowers * Report a view is indicated very<br />
similar--to--that indicated in the Fox-Report.. The Commission had<br />
indicated that -the pres-efft state of knowledge certainly was not<br />
one which should cause people to put aside the further development<br />
of nuclear power for peaceful purposes. I think that what we have<br />
seen on this occasion is yet one more example of the unparalleled<br />
capacity of the Leader of the opposition for deception, and the<br />
blatant way in which he tries to carry out distortions.<br />
May I conclude Mr. De puty Speaker, by summarising the facts.<br />
As has been mentioned, the quotation used in the background<br />
papers came from paragraph 181 of the Flowers Report. The<br />
sentences which the Leader of the Opposition claimed had been<br />
omitted came from paragraph 504 of the Flowers Report 111 pages<br />
later. I do not think it is surprising, therefore, that the<br />
sentences quoted by the Leader of the opposition were omitted<br />
from the quotation, because obviously they were not part of it.<br />
Mr. Deputy Speaker, I thank you for the indulgence of the Chair.<br />
I am quite certain that all Honourable Members will be able to<br />
understand exactly what the Leader of the Opposition did." </p>
