STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING, IMP<br />
CANBERRA COMMISSION ON THE ELIMINATION OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS<br />
It is my pleasure today to announce that two additional outstanding individuals have<br />
agreed to participate in the Canberra Commission on the Elimination of Nuclear<br />
Weapons. They will join the fifteen eminent statesmen, scientists, disarmament<br />
experts and military strategists who, as noted in my statement on 26 November, will<br />
bring experience and imaginative thinking to the task of proposing how to achieve a<br />
world totally free of nuclear weapons.<br />
The new members of the Canberra Commission are Commander Jacques-Yves<br />
Cousteau and Ambassador Qian Jiadong. Both have exceptional qualifications and<br />
will strengthen the Commission In key areas. Commander Cousteau has a unique<br />
International reputation deriving from his work on environmental issues, notably in the<br />
field of marine conservation, and has moreover a strong personal commitment to the<br />
cause of nuclear disarmament. Ambassador Qian's distinguished diplomatic career<br />
includes serving as China's Ambassador for Disarmament.<br />
The Commission will meet for the first time in Canberra from 23-25 January and Is to<br />
conclude Its report by 31 August 1996. It should be large enough to encompass the<br />
range of specialisations needed for its task but not so large as to be unwieldy. With<br />
these two most welcome additions I am confident that the Commission is appropriately<br />
structured to carry out its mandate.<br />
