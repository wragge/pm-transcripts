OPENING OF TIE AUSTRALIAN GUARANTEE<br />
CORPORATION BUILDING, SYDNEY, N. S. W.<br />
ON 24+ TH APRIL, 1963.<br />
Speech by the Prime Minister, 1 the Rt. Hon. Sir Robert-Menzies<br />
I think I ought to make a personal explanationwe<br />
do that occasionally in Parliament to explain why I am<br />
here. When I received an invitation signed in a somewhat<br />
truculent signature by Hector Clayton, my secretary, who<br />
looks after my interests with loving care, said to me, " This<br />
surely is one that you can refuse," ( Laughter) and to her<br />
intense regret, I said, " No, this happens to be one I must<br />
accept," and for two reasons one is that Hector Clayton is<br />
an old friend of mine, and I am a little bit frightened to<br />
say " 1No." 1 ( Laughter). The other is that I am one of the few<br />
living old boys of a Legislative Council in Australia, having<br />
begun my political life in the Victorian Upper House. And<br />
therefore, you know, once a mortgage always a mortgage,,<br />
( Laughter) and once a Legislative Councillor, always a<br />
Legislative Councillor, and so by the strict union rule that<br />
we apply among ourselves, I said, " That's the second reason<br />
I must be there." It is very kind of the Chairman in the course of<br />
his very interesting speech, in which he lefl me literally<br />
nothing to say, to refer to the honour that has been conferred<br />
on me* You haven't failed, I am sure, to notice that the<br />
motto of this Order, " Nemo me impune lacessit" was published<br />
in various newspapers andfor the benefit of those educated<br />
at the university translated into English ( Laughter), and<br />
one or two of my 6abinet colleagues wore heard to say, rather<br />
unkindly, " Oh, we knew that was his motto fifteen years ago".<br />
( Laughter) Well, now you've been told a good deal today<br />
about the history of Lhis Company and it is really a very<br />
remarkable one. It is tremendously interesting to people of<br />
my own vintage to realise that the whole development of this<br />
particular branch of industry has occurred in Australia during<br />
my own adult life, so that this is quite young. I'm younger<br />
than he is. ( Interject-1on " Not by much") He says, " Not by<br />
much" but I still don't need to have a special resolution<br />
( Laughter, applause), although I am bomnd to say I do<br />
occasionally need to survive a " No Confidence" Motion which<br />
is, roughly I suppose, the same thing.<br />
But what I was saying when I was rudely interrupted<br />
was that this is something relatively new, and it is like most<br />
things in the world that we live in which are mostly new. I<br />
imagine that if anybody else in this room had had my experience<br />
of sitting down at the Prime Minister's table twenty-four years<br />
ago and comparing what came then to the table with what comes<br />
now, twenty-four years later, he would understand perfectly<br />
how immensely complicated have the affairs of the world become.<br />
They are so complicated that those who have to handle them<br />
feel constantly puzzled by the aspects of them and the only<br />
people who clearly understand them are the commentators who<br />
don't have to do anything about them at all. ( Laughter) / 2 </p>
<p>-2<br />
Forty years ago when this particular company<br />
began forty-five years ago, whenever it was the use of<br />
credit was something that was understood in certain orthodox<br />
and limited channels, The complexity of the world's affairs,<br />
the enormous pressure of the rise of living standards the<br />
enormous development in what we are now pleased to cal.<br />
" 1consumer durables". as the motor car became the commonplace,<br />
as household equipment became the commonplace and so on all<br />
these events could hardly be carried on by the old normal<br />
routine methods that were available and so I haven't the<br />
slightest doubt that this expansion of the instruments of<br />
credit, which is represented by your Company and by many<br />
others was something that was quite inevitable, full of value<br />
and full of danger, like all credit facilities. A wonderful<br />
thing for people, wisely handled and wisely administered and<br />
for some people perhaps a little tempting as meaning that they<br />
can get out of their depth and that the Lord will provide, the<br />
Lord for this purpose being mixed up with Mr. Clayton.( Laughter)<br />
Like every other instrument that we have to our<br />
hands, it is capable of misuse. But I have no doubt whatever<br />
myself that the present face of the country, the present<br />
availability of private resources to private citizens, would<br />
be nothing like what it is today if it hadn't been for the<br />
facilities provided by the various credit bodies, including<br />
in particular the hire purchase authorities in Australia and<br />
therefore I acknowledge the service that this industry has<br />
done, and is doing and will continue to do, to the ordinary<br />
men and women of Australia.<br />
Now there is another aspect of that and I hope<br />
you will allow me to refer to it. Every now and then there<br />
will appear to be a conflict between what the hire purchase<br />
companies are doing, what thc trading banks are doing, what<br />
the Reserve Bank may wish to have done, what the Government<br />
desires to have done, There will appear to be and there<br />
will be problems of interest policy, for example, and how<br />
these problems are to be handled, and in Australia whenever<br />
we encounter problems of this kind we are terribly tempted,<br />
aren't we, to use the blunt instrument of compulsion. Funny<br />
thing about us, we are cheeful, light-hearted, on the whole<br />
rather happy-go-lucky sunsible people, but we have got a great<br />
passion for compulsion. Wde even have compulsory voting, not<br />
that I am anybody to complain about it because it has worked<br />
out on the whole rather well ( Laughter) from my point of view.<br />
But you know, instrinsically, there is something rather<br />
fantastic about it, isn't there? Wse do think so rapidly of<br />
compulsion. I, myself, am a great believer in the handling<br />
of these problems in the instrument of co-operation, of<br />
consultation consultation between the Reserve Bank and the<br />
Trading Bank effective mutual understanding, consultation<br />
between them and the outside semi-banking I suppose that's<br />
a permissible expression to use instruments such as the hire<br />
purchase companies. We ought not all the time to be looking<br />
around to see whether we can invent a statute that will<br />
produce co-operation. No statute ever did. Every statute<br />
produces a crop of legal advisers whose business it is to<br />
explain how you can get out of the net of the statute. That's<br />
right. And as Mr. Justice Else Mitchell will recall one<br />
wise man once said that in the classical conflict between the<br />
parliamentary draftsman and the conveyancer, the conveyancer<br />
always wins. Now, there is a good deal of truth in that. we<br />
mustntt run to compulsion as our first resort. o9 / 3 </p>
<p>3-<br />
I believe, from my own experience, that consultations<br />
from time to time with people who have groat responsibilities,<br />
particularly in this financial world we are discussing this<br />
afternoon, do nothing but good. After all, we are all Australians.<br />
We pride ourselves on being honest men, having some objectivity<br />
of view, not a lot of greedy, self-seeking people, We are good<br />
citizens we trust. I believe we are. And we will get further<br />
sitting down together, so that if somebody says, " Well, the<br />
interest rates being offered by tho hire purchase companies are<br />
inconsistent with the bank structure of interest rates. Letts<br />
sit down and talk about it, because in the long run, Sir, your<br />
Company and all other companies like it have, just as much as<br />
I have, just as much as any other person has7a vested interest<br />
in sound stability in the economy of Australia. Not stagnation.<br />
There is nothing stagnant about the industry that you carry on.<br />
Not at all. If it became stagnant it would die. I don't<br />
talk about stagnation. I talk about stability in the sense<br />
of avoiding soaring levels of prices and costs so that the<br />
development of the country can proceed on a sound foundation,<br />
so that you have stability and growth. The two things are not<br />
inconsistent, They will be more and more consistent with each<br />
other if we take the opportunity from time to time, all of us,<br />
in Government or out of Government, to sit down together, talk<br />
about our problems and say," Well, now, what do you think about<br />
that? What do you think can be done by your group to achieve<br />
this common rosult?" 1<br />
And therefore Sir, I am without any reservation<br />
at atll delighted to be here this afternoon particularly<br />
delighted, of course, because you are an old friend, but<br />
delighted in any event because I think that you may look back<br />
with pride on the record of this company. I hadn't realised<br />
until you spoke this afternoon that you had been gathering the<br />
organisation together from a variety of places into ono centre.<br />
A great contribution to the company, a great contribution to the<br />
city of Sydney and I am perfectly certain as I declare this<br />
building open that the work it does wisely administered,<br />
properly understood, will be a great contribution to the<br />
commercial and domestic life of Australia. </p>
