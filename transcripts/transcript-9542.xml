TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P. J. KEATING, MP<br />
INTERVIEW WITH ANDY COPERMAN, RADIO 4RK, ROCKHAMPTON,<br />
FRIDAY, 7 APRIL 1995<br />
E OE PROOF COPY<br />
AC: Mr Keating, good afternoon.<br />
PM: How are you Andy?<br />
AC: Very well. I guess because Waltzing Matilda is on everyone's lips, you<br />
have just come from the Waltzing Matilda Centenary celebrations at<br />
Winton yesterday, what was the feeling like there?<br />
PM: There was, no doubt, all the feeling you would want to expect with a<br />
centenary celebration and I said last night, this really is our national<br />
song, it is not our national anthem but it is our national song. And<br />
whenever you hear it sung particularly in a crowd, I was in Ireland<br />
about 18 months ago at a place called Croke Park which is where they<br />
hold the all Ireland football grand final, Gaelic football final, and there<br />
was probably about 120,000 people there and they had six bands, at<br />
any rate I was a sort of guest of the Irish Prime Minister and after I had<br />
spoken and he had spoken the band struck up Waltzing Matilda and<br />
the whole of the stadium sang it through all the verses, the five I think,<br />
verses.<br />
AC: I can't remember how many myself.<br />
PM: Yeah, but they know all the verses and if you are an Australian, you<br />
are sitting there and there are 100,000 people up singing a tune it<br />
makes the hair stand up on the back of your neck I can tell you.<br />
AC: Well I must ask this question, were you given a bit of a surprise when<br />
Ted Egan shoved the microphone in your direction yesterday<br />
afternoon or not. Because the grab that was played on the news this<br />
morning perhaps wasn't all that flattering. Was that a bit....<br />
PM: I didn't know what the grab was, what did it say? </p>
<p>2<br />
AC: There has been suggestions going around that you don't know the<br />
words to Waltzing Matilda.<br />
PM: Oh, he said let's sing the first verse. But it was a matter of, he had<br />
such a big booming voice and he had the microphone and we let him<br />
sing it, that was all.<br />
AC: Yes, I think that is the case with Ted Egan. Well a celebration like this<br />
with a song like Waltzing Matilda raises the issue of whether we got it<br />
wrong at the referendum about the National Anthem, do you think that<br />
perhaps we should put that vote to the people once again or not?<br />
PMV: Oh no, you can't be solemn about someone putting a Jumbuk in a bag<br />
can you, I mean, you know a jolly Jumbuk, jolly swagman he wasn't too<br />
jolly when he jumped in the river so I mean, in a funny kind of way the<br />
song has picked up a lot of national sentiment but it is not a solemn<br />
song, it is not the Anthem and the Anthem is fine as far as I'm<br />
concerned.<br />
AC: Although you could look at it as if it is an unemployed person who<br />
steals some food and then commits suicide to avoid being captured by<br />
the police, I mean that is one way of looking at it isn't it?<br />
PM: Or, it could be a defiant person, a sort of liberating message and sort<br />
of egalitarian message. The thing is, I don't think the song needs to be<br />
dissected and say what does this really mean, what did Paterson mean<br />
when he wrote this line, but rather it is the emotional impact of the<br />
thing. It is a song that I'm sure most Australians have felt emotional<br />
about at some point or another.<br />
AC: I'm sure we agree with you there. Before we go to some calls a topic<br />
which has been raised here today and, perhaps, you might be<br />
interested in giving us some comments and an issue perhaps that is<br />
more dear to the hearts of us is the super league football competition.<br />
What is your feeling on that?<br />
PM: Well it is a matter for the league, that is my feeling about it. What is<br />
driving this is one television medium competing with another. I mean,<br />
it is a medium change issue. That is, free to air television has been<br />
the medium in Australian television and the medium that is coming via<br />
fibre optic cables and satellite is pay television. And the other thing<br />
about pay television, of course, is it is traded internationally, products<br />
traded internationally. So obviously News Limited which runs an<br />
international pay television business is wanting product for its system<br />
and for Australia and the free to air stations, in this case Channel 9, is<br />
seeking to protect the franchise it has over the existing rugby league.<br />
Now entering into that also the dynamic of the fact that you have got<br />
the Broncos and the Raiders and these other out of Sydney clubs has<br />
changed the nature of the competition, seen more stars develop and, I<br />
mean, what's happened now is the catalyst of the television change is<br />
producing change which picks up the shift to the big regional and city<br />
state clubs.<br />
I </p>
<p>AC: Michael Lee has given a commitment that the existing major sports will<br />
always be shown on free to air television. If the Super League does<br />
take over from the ARL as the major rugby league competition in<br />
Australia, and that is only to be shown on pay-television, won't that<br />
throw that commitment to..<br />
PM: I don't think so, because I think Mr Cowley said on behalf of News<br />
Limited they had no intention of flouting the syphoning rules and this is<br />
basically not a matter for the Government this is a matter for the<br />
league. As far as we are concerned, we've said that we have this thing<br />
called anti-syphoning which means, taking the code out of it, really<br />
means that somebody can see the rugby league, in this case the<br />
Winfield Cup, on free-to-air television and it isn't taken and syphoned<br />
onto pay-television. So we have what's called anti-syphoning rules.<br />
Now they will cover all of the major things but they won't cover every<br />
contingency of course. And the other thing about the existing<br />
television of football is that, you know, on a Sunday night you might<br />
see 40 minutes of the game of the day. You don't see all the other<br />
matches. But, of course, with pay-television you will be able to see<br />
nearly all the matches.<br />
AC: I'll just repeat that, if the Super League does take over, enforces the<br />
end of the ARL, will that mean that people will have to pay to watch<br />
any rugby league coverage?<br />
PM: Well News Limited, which is now the one promoting the Super League,<br />
say that they won't be doing anything which is contrary to the<br />
syphoning rules so I don't think it will arise.<br />
AC: All right, well on that note we might go to our first caller which I guess<br />
will be back to Waltzing Matilda, this is Richard.<br />
C: Good afternoon and good afternoon Mr Keating.<br />
PM: How are you Richard?<br />
C: Mr Keating, I've just released this week my fourth history of Waltzing<br />
Matilda Waltzing Matilda Ballad of the Fair Go And in that book I<br />
quote what Banjo Paterson wrote about the song and I'd like to read to<br />
you and ask your opinion on Banjo Paterson's account. He refers to<br />
the origins and history tells us quite definitely that he wrote the song in<br />
January 1895 and that was just 14 weeks after the burning of<br />
Dagworth woolshed and the death of Samuel Hothmeister. Now I will<br />
read what Banjo Paterson says, it comes from a story called Golden<br />
Water from a radio broadcast in the 1 930s.<br />
AC: Could I interrupt you here and ask you to be quite brief please Richard<br />
we do have a lot of people coming afterwards?<br />
C: Okay, well this is what Banjo says. He says that the striking shearers<br />
burnt down MacPherson's woolshed and a man was picked up dead, </p>
<p>this engendered no malice and I've seen MacPhersons handing out<br />
champagne through a pub window to these very shearers and here a<br />
personal reminiscence may be worth recording while resting for lunch<br />
or while changing horses on our for and hand journey Ms MacPherson<br />
used to play a little Scottish tune on the zither, I put words to it and<br />
called it Waltzing Matilda. I'd just like Mr Keating's comment on that,<br />
what Banjo said.<br />
PM: Well I think he has obviously got a catchy tune regardless of its<br />
Scottish antecedence and he's obviously had some impression or<br />
some impact on him on this person who supposedly put the Jumbuk in<br />
the bag and been chased by the police and written this thing. It is not<br />
clear what he meant to say other than the words, that is what the<br />
meaning behind the words was, but as I said a bit earlier in the<br />
program I don't think the song is to be dissected or psychologically<br />
analysed. I mean the thing is in its melody and in its words and it is<br />
very much, I mean you see the British sing land of hope and glory and<br />
the Americans sing God bless America, I mean, this is the Australian<br />
equivalent. And I think it is the emotionalism of the song it is now the<br />
main message, and I said last night, the ghost of the swagman's ghost<br />
I think the ghost is the song, it's still around. That is, the song is still<br />
around so the ghost is still around.<br />
C: Do you think it's the ballad of the fair go, Mr Keating.<br />
PM: I think it has got these egalitarian tones through it. And I think I agree<br />
with you about that. Yes I do.<br />
AC: To move on to the next caller if you don't mind. This is Len.<br />
C: Good afternoon.<br />
PM: Len, how are you.<br />
C: Not too bad, yourself?<br />
PM: I'm good thanks.<br />
C: I've just got a quick question in respect to reconciliation and I'm just<br />
wondering why it is not possible for the Aboriginal community to induct<br />
or initiate all Australians into their tribes and cause a one united new<br />
nation to be formed in Australia. I mean it is our practice in Australia to<br />
do this we call it naturalisation, but the Aboriginal community tell me<br />
that that is impossible to do, I was just wondering if Mr Keating could<br />
tell me why?<br />
PM: I don't know why. I mean, it is like a pole trying to induct you and say<br />
that you are Polish or a Scotsman trying to induct me and say that I'm<br />
a Scot, I mean I'm not. I suppose that is the reason. Beyond that I<br />
don't think the argument follows that therefore we can't be one nation.<br />
I think that the multicultural ism of this country, I mean we have<br />
accepted here people from all over the world living here in great </p>
<p>harmony and to accept them but not accept the first Australians would<br />
be a real damnation of the whole spirit of cooperation, of assimilation<br />
that we are now so proud of and I think the whole notion of racism<br />
towards Aboriginal people has declined recently I think that things like<br />
Mabo have made Australians feel better about the fact that we have<br />
come to terms with these terrible wrongs and that they are being put<br />
right, if late, and that sense has given the reconciliation council and<br />
the whole process of reconciliation some real wind behind it.<br />
C: What I'm saying is that we as Australians like you say, we accept<br />
people from all over the world into here and we have accepted the first<br />
nation people as far as we're concerned. But it seems to be that they<br />
have initiated white Australians into tribes before it is a practice. But to<br />
put it up and say well look we've taken this step, why not a step from<br />
your direction which is a practice of your culture and initiate us all into<br />
the Aboriginal community, all under the one flag?<br />
PM: I don't think you should try and assume or paint the argument that<br />
they, the victims, in some way are now doing the wrong. They are the<br />
people who have been wronged. They, very clearly have been the<br />
victims. And if there is magnanimity it is to flow from us to them and<br />
not the other way around. Not that they haven't participated in this<br />
country in its sports, in its civic life, in its defence, all the things that we<br />
have required of ourselves, we have required of them and they have<br />
done. I don't think one can take the view and say because some<br />
Aboriginal tribe isn't initiating the whole Australian nation there is<br />
something wrong with them. The fact that they may have given entry<br />
and initiation to some non-Aboriginal people is a tribute to those<br />
people I guess.<br />
AC: I'm afraid we have to move on from you Len, thanks very much for your<br />
call this afternoon to the Sunshine coast now and Judy joins us.<br />
Good afternoon Judy.<br />
C: Good afternoon.<br />
PM: Judy how are you doing?<br />
C: I'm well thanks. How are you doing?<br />
PM: Good.<br />
C: First of all just on the subject Waltzing Matilda I think you really hit it<br />
on the head there when you said people are trying to dissect it far too<br />
much. It really is a song, its a great song and I think people should just<br />
accept it for that.<br />
PM: That's right. For its emotional value.<br />
C: What my question was actually about Mr Keating, was with work that<br />
I'm involved in I come across the question a lot from my clients about<br />
the current negative gearing laws and I'm being continually asked if the </p>
<p>6<br />
Government is going to change that and I would just like to know if the<br />
Labor Government has any plans to change it?<br />
PM: We did change it in the 1980s, but we changed it back and the reason<br />
we did was because that is negative gearing is where people write<br />
off against other income the costs of holding some asset like property,<br />
a rental property, and they deduct the costs against their other income.<br />
When we turned our back against it in the mid 1980s it was because<br />
the people who were doing it never intended to pay any tax. That is,<br />
when the rent and say the interest became the same, they would then<br />
sell the property so at no stage did the Tax Commissioner or the<br />
Commonwealth ever get we recognised the cost, but the<br />
Commonwealth never got a benefit. But when the capital gains tax<br />
was introduced it meant then that once they sold the property<br />
C: That's when they pay their tax.<br />
PM: they paid their tax then. So, there was some symmetry in the<br />
negative gearing on the one side and capital gains on the other. And<br />
that is why it has stayed the way it has ever since.<br />
C: And there is certainly no plans to change that?<br />
PM: Well, there has been none on our part.<br />
C: All right, thanks for your time.<br />
AC: To Jeff in Harvey Bay.<br />
C: Hello.<br />
PM: How are you Jeff?<br />
C: Not too bad. I'm visiting Australia from England. I am an Australian,<br />
but I've lived abroad for 20 odd years and I want to say how pleased I<br />
was to see how Australia has developed. But I want to get onto this<br />
question of nationalism and pride in one's country and how I feel that it<br />
can go overboard and become quite dangerous particularly in Europe,<br />
in Bosnia for example and in the Soviet Republic..<br />
PM: And Germany in the Second World War..<br />
C: Of course.<br />
PM: The most obvious example of it, Japan in the Pacific in the 1940s. I<br />
mean I think we agree, I think nationalism, that is misplaced sense of<br />
national sentiment, self importance, superiority breeds contempt for<br />
other countries.<br />
C: It does, it breeds intolerance. </p>
<p>PM: It breeds intolerance whereas I think, you know, one's got to have that<br />
and that is one of the great things about Australia. We have never had<br />
that sense of self importance about ourselves that was in some way<br />
menacing someone else. But one thing we have had, that is a sense<br />
of tolerance and a sense of identity and I think it is important that the<br />
country understands itself, understands what it has become and is<br />
proud of what it has become. I think that is a different thing altogether.<br />
C: Well, it is. I am very pleased to see more and more multi-racialism in<br />
Australia and very pleased to see Afro-Carribeans and all sorts of<br />
different races on the streets, in the cities and in the country too, I think<br />
it is a great thing.<br />
PM: It is, our most successful post-war change perhaps has been this<br />
change to a multi-cultural, multi-racial country and the fact that we<br />
have made the change so smoothly and so well attests, I think, to the<br />
great tolerance in this country which comes from our sense of<br />
democracy. The reasons, I think, Australians give other Australians<br />
intellectual room and space and respect comes from that sense of<br />
democracy which is very deep rooted here.<br />
C: I want to say too how much Australians are admired abroad,<br />
particularly in England and in Europe, generally they have a very good<br />
name and it makes me very proud.<br />
AC: Just on the subject of multi-culturalism, do you think that perhaps the<br />
celebration of Waltzing Matilda, getting back to that, is celebrating an<br />
Australia which is no longer there, in that now we have this incredible<br />
multi-culturalism which we didn't have 100 years ago?<br />
PM: A lot of what was there then isn't here now, but Australia has gone on<br />
to become a different country than that which it was, I guess all<br />
countries do this in 100 years, but we certainly have. But, the song<br />
has gone on to become part of the modern us, the modern Australia.<br />
So, it is just as capable of being celebrated, I mean look, countries<br />
rarely pick up, I mean most countries have national songs, they don't<br />
have too many of them.<br />
AC: You don't think that the people who are going out to Winton are going<br />
1wow isn't it wonderful, we have got Waltzing Matilda', are crying for<br />
the days before multi-culturalism. Is that reading too much into it?<br />
PM: I don't think so. There would be a few conservatives around who decry<br />
the change in the place and wish we could, sort of, wind the clock<br />
back, but winding the clock back has not got much going for it.<br />
C: Hello, Mr Prime Minister.<br />
PM: Theresa, how are you doing?<br />
C: Very well. I just wanted to let you know that I think you are not doing a<br />
bad job. </p>
<p>PM: That is kind of you, thank you.<br />
C: Yes, and I hope you continue to do so.<br />
PM: Well, we had some interesting data out last week. We had what is<br />
called the National Accounts that is the dip stick we put into the<br />
economy every three months and that showed that the Australian<br />
economy is growing at five per cent and with about one per cent<br />
inflation.<br />
C: Yes.<br />
PM: And you have got to go back, well probably I can't remember any year<br />
much in the post-war years where we had the concurrence of five per<br />
cent growth, one per cent inflation, four per cent employment growth.<br />
So something good is happening out there.<br />
C: Of course it is, and I wish you and your family all the best.<br />
PM: That is very kind of you, thank you.<br />
AC: Betty in Longreach.<br />
C: Good afternoon, Mr Keating.<br />
PM: How are you Betty?<br />
C: Very good thank you and yourself?<br />
PM: I'm great.<br />
C: That's good and you are doing a good job and the other one said the<br />
same thing. What interests me the most is tourism. Tourism is a great<br />
industry for the people of the interior, no matter what state we live in,<br />
and they expect an increase from 15 million to 42 million in the year<br />
2003 I heard on the news this morning which is another great thing.<br />
But the thing which we think of a lot is trying to get tourists from every<br />
area in Australia out here and we would like to know if there is<br />
anything being done on the Kennedy development road between<br />
Winton and so we can get some of our tourists from up around<br />
Cairns. We hear a lot about strategy, eco-tourism, infrastructure and<br />
what have you and we all know the cost of these all weather roads are<br />
enormous, but there is other alternatives and some of the Shires have<br />
come up with, especially the Shire, they have got an innovative and<br />
economical efficient alternative where they use geotextiles<br />
reinforcement seal and the cost then would only be $ 12 million<br />
compared with $ 148 million for bitumen. And I was just wondering if<br />
we could have this road, so we would have an all weather road right up<br />
to Cairns and there is a lot of people on the coastal regions who would<br />
love to come out here and we haven't got a road that would bring them </p>
<p>9<br />
through into Longreach to our heritage centre in Barcaldine. I was just<br />
wondering if there is anything you could possibly do about this?<br />
PM: When the One Nation package was introduced in 1992 we were<br />
building and sealing a highway running up from South Australia, up<br />
through western NSW and into Queensland. Now, a lot of that is<br />
sealed, a bit of it is yet to be sealed, my geography lets me down here<br />
a bit, I'm not just certain where this connects up to the arterial roads<br />
and highways out through Longreach and Winton. But, I do<br />
understand the points you are making and can say that, I think, still a<br />
lot of the ethos of Australia is a celebration of the bush and the bush<br />
values.<br />
C: This is right.<br />
PM: And I think the places you mention, Longreach and Barcaldine<br />
C: You see, they are talking about stopping the train because it is not<br />
economic run between Winton and Herindom, and if we had an all<br />
weather road there they could use that for the train and then also we<br />
can get our tourists down, we have got an all weather road then from<br />
right up in Cairns to right down through this region here and another<br />
thing there has been four generations of my family lived here in and<br />
still no all weather road.<br />
PM: No, no, well you have been waiting a while haven't you.<br />
C: Yes.<br />
PM: You really have. Well look, we have made great strides with the<br />
national highway system which the Commonwealth runs.<br />
C: Yes, I know, the Matilda Highway is one of the best.<br />
PM: We run the national highways, the States run the arterial highways and<br />
arterial roads and we made this division some years ago. That is, the<br />
national highway system the Commonwealth funds and runs. The<br />
arterial roads the States do. But we have taken over some of the<br />
bigger state roads and turned them into highways and that was the one<br />
I mentioned in One Nation. Any rate I'll look my geography up as a<br />
result of your call and see whether you are actually in this system. It<br />
may be you are there and are just waiting for the favour to turn up.<br />
C: Just waiting for that. Thank you Mr Keating.<br />
AC: Mr Keating, you had a meeting this afternoon with some Central<br />
Queensland University students, I understand there was a bit of anger.<br />
PM: No, there wasn't.<br />
AC: It was foreshadowed that there might be a little bit of anger regarding<br />
HECS. </p>
<p>PM: No, they were really very sweet, very polite.<br />
AC: Can you reassure them that HECS will not be increased in the Budget?<br />
PM: No, I think you have got to understand what the issues are. They are<br />
that there is a fear on the part of students that the Government will go<br />
for up-front fees for under graduates. This has always been a furphy.<br />
I don't know how it has got around and I made very clear today and I'm<br />
happy to make clear here that this Government does not believe in full,<br />
up-front fees for university students. By contrast, my opponents in the<br />
last election, the Liberal party in the last election, wanted full fees for<br />
university students which meant that only the children of the wealthy<br />
could go to university. Now, I made the point to them, one of the ways<br />
we've taken university places from 320,000 in 1988 to 560,000 today<br />
and that is a 36 per cent increase in funding in places and the reason<br />
that has happened is because we now ask students to pay about<br />
per cent of the cost of a university place in the higher education charge<br />
HECS but they pay it back when they get into work. But, all of that<br />
money is not kept by the Commonwealth government. It all goes back<br />
into places. So, if you take the university where I was today, Central<br />
Queensland here, about a third of those people on campus wouldn't be<br />
there without HECS. So, one of the points I'm making, you know, I've<br />
had people objecting to HECS, well HECS is the way where the young<br />
people, the children of working class people get into university. Before<br />
that it was basically preserved for people on high incomes. That is<br />
why HECS is such a fair arrangement.<br />
The altercation I had a couple of weeks ago was with not an<br />
unemployed person, but with a student who didn't want to pay HECS.<br />
And I made the point, well, if you don't want to pay HECS give your<br />
place in university to somebody who does.<br />
AC: Fair enough. Later on today you are heading to the Capricorn coast,<br />
what will you be doing there?<br />
PM: Today, can I just say a couple of things, one of the things that I was<br />
very pleased to do today with Majorie Henzell who is with me in the<br />
studio is that we were with the Vice-Chancellor of the University<br />
opening the computer communications centre which the<br />
Commonwealth has just funded $ 5.5 million of a $ 7 million centre at<br />
the University which will virtually connect the University through the<br />
information highway and provide Central Queensland this capacity on<br />
that campus for information technology and computer technologies.<br />
That is one of the principal things I was doing today. Later on I am<br />
seeing a group of people down on the coast just to have a talk to them<br />
and to have dinner tonight with some of the business community and to<br />
just talk about issues. For instance, generally that is, business tourism<br />
and in the discussions this afternoon when I leave here I am seeing a<br />
group on the coast to talk about Shoalwater Bay which I was very<br />
pleased to be able to be involved with in preserving that wonderful </p>
<p>area for this community here and for posterity. So, I am looking<br />
forward to a good discussion down there.<br />
AC: We have got one minute left, we'll go to one final call.<br />
C: Good afternoon, Prime Minister. I would just like to say I think you are<br />
doing a pretty good job over all. However, the Government doesn't<br />
seem to be doing very much to promote ' buy Australian made', you<br />
know to promote supporting Australian companies, Australian owned<br />
companies and to buy Australian made because if we did I thought we<br />
would improve our balance of payments problem pretty quick.<br />
PM: Well, we do encourage it, but you see, where we encourage it most is<br />
with exports. We get other people outside of Australia to buy Australia<br />
and that is where it matters most and it may just be worth your while to<br />
know this, that ten years ago we exported 14 per cent of all we<br />
produce. Today it is 22 per cent. That is an eight percentage point<br />
difference, but eight per cent of our economy is worth $ 30 billion a<br />
year. So, we have got somebody buying $ 30 billion of Australia out<br />
there around the world and that is the best buy Australia program I can<br />
think of.<br />
AC: Mr Keating, thanks very much for coming in this afternoon.<br />
PM: Thank you.<br />
ends </p>
