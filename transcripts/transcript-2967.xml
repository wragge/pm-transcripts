PRESS STATEMENT NO. 109<br />
3 JULY 1973<br />
Federal Cabinet has approved amendments to the<br />
Public Service Act to enable the Public Service Board<br />
to grant permission to public servants to become directors<br />
of companies and societies in certain prescribed<br />
circumstances. At the present time, unless the company is a<br />
co-operative society, there is a prohibition against public<br />
servants holding directorships in companies and incorporated<br />
societies, such as building societics formed for the<br />
purpose of providing home finance for public servants.<br />
The Government recognises that there are situations<br />
where it is to the benefit of the community for a public<br />
servant to accept a directorship. But it is essential<br />
that there should be no conflict of interest between the<br />
directorship and his public duties.<br />
Accordingly the Government has approved the drafting<br />
of amendments to the Public Service Act which will enable<br />
the Public Service Board to grant permi ssion to public<br />
servants to accept directorships only in such cases or<br />
circumstances and subject to such conditions as are<br />
prescribed by regulations.<br />
