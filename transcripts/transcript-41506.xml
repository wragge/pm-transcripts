    <content><![CDATA[<p>I am pleased to announce that Australia and Vietnam have today established a strategic partnership.</p>
<p>As new strategic partners, Australia and Vietnam have agreed to work together to realise a vision of a secure, open and prosperous region.</p>
<p>We will establish annual meetings between our foreign ministers and separately between our defence ministers.</p>
<p>We have established a new ministerial level economic dialogue to boost trade and investment with one of ASEANâ€™s fastest-growing economies.</p>
<p>With two-way trade in excess of $11 billion, supporting thousands of jobs, our linkages are only set to grow.</p>
<p>As fellow members of TPP11, we will work to keep markets open and trade and investment flowing.</p>
<p>We will work across our partnership in defence, development, education, science and research to deepen our links and advance our cooperation.</p>
<p>Together, including at the forthcoming ASEAN-Australia Special Summit, we will work for our common prosperity and security.</p>
<p>This announcement is a fitting way to mark 45 years of diplomatic relations and the visit to Australia by Prime Minister Phuc.</p>
