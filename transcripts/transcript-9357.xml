PRIME MINISTER<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P. J. KEATING, MP<br />
LUNCH IN HONOUR OF PRIME MINISTER GON OF SINGAPORE,<br />
PARLIAMENT HOUSE, CANBERRA, 13 SEPTEMBER 1994<br />
Prime Minister Goh and Madam Goh, it's a great pleasure to welcome you<br />
both to Australia.<br />
And let me say at the outset how much I personally value the very close<br />
working relatiorlship that I have enjoyed with you, Prime Minister, since my<br />
visit to Singapore In September 1992.<br />
I also welcome our other distinguished guests from Singapore for what is<br />
indeed a propitious visit.<br />
You are visiting at a time when relations between Australia and Singapore<br />
have never been better.<br />
We have strong historical links, shared economic and trade interests, an<br />
excellent defence relationship and, perhaps most important of all, a similar<br />
vision for the future.<br />
I see Singapore and Australia as two very forward-looking and optimistic<br />
nations with many reasons for moving forward together, in partnership.<br />
One of the reasons for my confidence lies in our shared history which<br />
stretches back to before World War Two when Australia's first overseas<br />
representation in Asia was established in Singapore.<br />
I think It's important to remember that our friendship is an old friendship that<br />
predates the birth of modem Singapore.<br />
The content of the relationship has changed, but its closeness hasn't.<br />
just on fifty years ago, Australia participated in the defence of Singapore. </p>
<p>Today, the defence links still lie at the heart of the relationship, but tey're<br />
much more geared to the future.<br />
This morning, Prime Minister Goh and I discussed the excellent In some<br />
ways remarkable progress our defence relationship has made over the<br />
past few years.<br />
We announced a number of Important new areas of defence cooperation.<br />
And later this year In November, our Ministers will open the Royal Singapore<br />
Air Force flying school at Pearce In Western Australia.<br />
But, as critical as these defence links are, they are only part of the picture<br />
for ours is indeed a broadly based relationship.<br />
More than 6,000 Singaporeans are studying in Australia today while others<br />
who come here to holiday have made Singapore our fifth largest tourist<br />
market.<br />
Singapore is our most Important investment partner in ASEAN.<br />
Singapore is our most important trading partner In ASEAN.<br />
With two-way trade at more than $ 5 billion a year, Singapore is our fifth<br />
largest export market worldwide and our eight largest trading partner overall.<br />
And what is important about this trade, from an Australian perspective at<br />
least, is that a great deal of our exports are high value added manufactures<br />
and services.<br />
In fact, Singapore is our third largest export market for sophisticated<br />
manufactures and a growing market for our services.<br />
But we each want to do better.<br />
And as we look to the future, we look to joint opportunities in third markets.<br />
We share an understanding that strategic alliances can be critical to winning<br />
contracts In the world's fastest growing region.<br />
This is the thinking that lay behind the Strategic Linkages Initiative which we<br />
launched during my visit to Singapore in 1992.<br />
By com bining the respective strengths of Australian and Singaporean<br />
companies, we are better placed to take advantage of major business<br />
opportunities In the region.<br />
Today, I'm pleased to say we have moved this initiative Into an important new<br />
phase with the decision to focus our collaboration on Infrastructure projects. </p>
<p>And here were looking at a potential market in the order of hundreds of<br />
billions of dollars.<br />
In thie five years to 1997, Infrastructure spending in East Asia is estimated to<br />
exceed $ 730 billion.<br />
While we are searching out joint opportunities in third countries, our wider<br />
regional interests are also converging.<br />
In this regard, Prime Minister Goh and I share a similar vision for the Asia<br />
Pacific region.<br />
It is a vision of optimism and abundance.<br />
And APEC is part of that vision.<br />
We are both looking forward to supporting President Soeharto in bringing<br />
about an historic outcome at the APEC Leaders Meeting in Bogor in<br />
November. Clearly, there have been enormous changes in our region over the past<br />
decade, but I suspect they are nothing compared with what Is to come.<br />
In the run up to a new century, I think it is critical that optimists be they<br />
individuals or nations form partnerships.<br />
I say this because it is optimists who can imagine a better future.<br />
And it is optimists who are thereby more likely to create that future.<br />
Obviously, the best optimists are also pragmatists they are the ones who<br />
bring about positive change.<br />
In this regard, I think Singapore and Australia have much in common.<br />
Both our countries have undergone enormous and positive change in recent<br />
times. And, In this regard, it's vital that we guard against the sort of familiarity that<br />
prevents us from clearly seeing how much both our countries have changed.<br />
You represent, Prime Minister, a country that is one of Asia's pre-eminent<br />
success stories.<br />
Singapore has achieved remarkable economic growth accompanied by a real<br />
social concern for its people for good housing, for education and training,<br />
for high standards of health care. </p>
<p>Singapore will continue to make a vital contribution to the region.<br />
Prime Minister, I'm sure that during your visit here to Australia you will see<br />
how much Australia has changed how we have transformed our economy<br />
into one of the most open and competitive in the world, how we have<br />
refocussed our attention to the Asia Pacific region.<br />
I believe our two countries share a real optimism for the region and our<br />
respective roles in it.<br />
For my part, I want to see Australia make its contribution wherever it can in<br />
partnership with Singapore.<br />
I wish you all well for what I hope is a very enjoyable and constructive visit to<br />
Australia. Thank you. </p>
