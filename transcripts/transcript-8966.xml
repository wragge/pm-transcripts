TRANSCRIPT OF PRESS CONFERENCE PRIME MINISTER. THE HON. P J. KEATING, M. P.<br />
AUSTRALLAN EMBASSY, WASHINGTON, U. S-A.<br />
TUESDAY 14 SET" EMBER., 1993<br />
PM: Let me just say at the beginning that I'm very satisfied with the outcome of my<br />
visit to Washington. The visit has been, I think, very important for Australia because<br />
we' ve been dealing herm with fundamental questions which have a big bearing on<br />
Australia and its future prosperity. Arid these of course are APEC, the Uruguay Round,<br />
Austraia-U. S, relations and the U. S. role in our paut of the world.<br />
If's important to put a lot of effort into getting these big questions right bemause so much<br />
will depend on them in the future. As T said to you ealier, the timing of the visit has<br />
been excellent because the very things Australia wants to talk about happen at this time to<br />
be high on Americas own agenda. This is a very favourable circumstance, to have this,<br />
when I'm visiting here as an Australian prime minister, in WashingtorL<br />
Througbout my visit I have been impressed by the priority which currently attaches in<br />
* WasiT~ o~ tofundaynental questions of international trade sb'. ucturts. The<br />
adminstration is taking a very strong interest in APEC and economic opportunity in Cast<br />
Asia and there is a lot of concern here about the ai-c: of the Uruguay Round of reported<br />
French m~ oves to reop en the Blar House Accord. And the United States administration<br />
and Congress are now starting to focus seriously on. NAFTA ( Worth American Free Trade<br />
Agreemnent). It's very important to be here now to put Australia's point of view and<br />
represent our interes~ s on these important questions which will, of course, be important to<br />
us for a long time into the future.<br />
The cenitrepiece of the visit, of course. was the meeting and working lunch today with<br />
President Clinton. I'm very pleased that we got on well and established, what I am sure<br />
should be a stong w~ rking relationship. I found President Clinton to be very charming<br />
indeed and with an impressive Srasp of policy and a public spirited, interested, open<br />
personality. As well -as affirming the importace both sides attach to our bilateral<br />
relationship our meeting produced three important results. The first is we agreed to work<br />
closely togetheT for a successfill outcome of the informal APEC leaders' meeting in<br />
Seattle in November. in such a way that the meeting itself takes the historic step of </p>
<p>-2.<br />
defining an Asia-Paiic Economic Community and-gives political authority and<br />
weight to APEC's work<br />
Secondly, we agreed that it was very importat to?~ vorld &amp; towth and jobs to achieve a<br />
succ~ ssfijl and balanced outcome of the Urugay Round by the maid-December deadline<br />
and. that any move by the European Community to reopen the Blair House Accord on<br />
agriculture would seriously jeopardize the whole Round. Ths sends, I think. a very<br />
Wtong and, I hope, a very clear message to Europe. Thirdly, the President and<br />
Ambassador Kantor each recognize Australi's concern about the damage that the EET<br />
subsidies cause our grain exports and said they would make every effort to minimise the<br />
effect on Australian interests. They cited, for example, their decision to stay out of the<br />
Indonesian market as a bona fide of their sincerity in this regard. They explained that, of<br />
course, the EEP was aimed at countrc~ ting Europe= n subsidies and that the only fully<br />
effective way to reduce the impact on Australia's grain exports was to conclude the<br />
Uruguay Round as soon as possible.<br />
I rigjit also say that all my other meetings were also worthwhile. I was particularly<br />
pleased with the very attentive response I received on Capitol Hill from both Senate<br />
Leaders and the Leaders of the House of Representatives. The main messages I<br />
emphasised were the continued relevance of the Australian-U. S. relationship, the great<br />
economic beneits whbich were now available to the United States in the Western Pacific;<br />
and the importane of establishing institutional structures to secure benefits of the variety<br />
we're talking about, like APEC.<br />
So having finished my program in Washington I must say to you that I think I am please4<br />
with the results. It's clear that Australia's standing is very highi in this city and that we're<br />
regarded as an important friend and ally of the United States. And naturally I should be<br />
happy to take questions.<br />
1: Can you explan how you expressed your concern over the U. S.' s human rights<br />
position and what was your motivation behind raising it?<br />
PM: Just as I think how the President expressed his view today. I think if you read the<br />
transcript of what I said and what hr. said you'll find that it is exactly the same view. Th1at<br />
democracies Like Aastralia have a lot to offer the Asia-Pacifle area and our standards and<br />
values are important * not just to us, but to them: And we put them and should put them<br />
tellingly. forcefully -but see the totality of these relationships for what they are. That is,<br />
representing a whoIle range of issues. A9 the President said, this afternioon in respect of<br />
China with proliferation issues; in their ternis with very major trade issues and<br />
recognising the central point that, of course. one can not influence whatsoever, sidelining<br />
the very large societies if one were to take that view. </p>
<p>-3-<br />
Now, Australia has never taken that view and because of that wet're more influential in<br />
these matter than countries that might take the view that they can't deal with themn over<br />
human rights.<br />
j. But we wvere led to believe, Mr Keating, that you told specifically the<br />
Congressmnen ont Capitol Hill and Mr Kantor that you would like to see some more<br />
balance in the way the U. S. deals with bilateral frictions particularly with regard to<br />
humnan rights and specifically you mentioned Indonesia and China.<br />
PM: Not see more balance but basically what I said was the balanced way that<br />
they're dealing with them is the right way.<br />
1: But don't we have a different view on how we relate trade policy and human<br />
rights. The U. S. has trade sanctions against Chin* and now Indonesia over human rights.<br />
Australia does not do that And presumably because we are a smaller country we don't<br />
have the don't have more to lose thtan the U. S. Don't we have a differencee with the<br />
U. S. over....<br />
PM-I don't think so, Again I refer you to what the President said today. You can get<br />
no gmeter authority that him, himself, and the expression which he made at the Press<br />
Conference which I think was square on with our own view.<br />
Mr Keating, can you. tell us a bit about what you have to do between now and November<br />
on behind the scenies work on making sure that APEC is a success. What is the least that<br />
you hope will come out of that avetin, and what is the most?<br />
PM: Well, the first thing would be a good attendance at the meeting; that it is attended<br />
at a high level, that the very attendance as I said this afternoon, helps to define the Asia-<br />
Pacific Economic Community) and that we have some understandings before we arrive<br />
about what the process of the meeting might be. how it's conducted and what we can<br />
expevt to glean fromn it in terms of APECs future program and progress.<br />
J: Will you be seeking to enshrine that definition into some sort of Communiqui at<br />
the end of the meeting?<br />
PM: I think we'll leave that up to the meeting, probably. It's a, I think the view the<br />
President's takcing -which I thiink is wise that we don't want a pre-cooked meeting.<br />
That is, with papers that are floating around which have all been negotiated arnd which<br />
basically get a rubber stamp at the end. And that is why his preference and my preference<br />
is for the leaders to attend without staff but only with interpreters. So that it is a<br />
genuinely informal discussion about the Asia-Pacific and about opportunities and trade </p>
<p>-4.<br />
opportunities. And that if we do produce any statement of principles or any corrimuniqud<br />
that may follow it, it's something that will be puttogether there by the people involved.<br />
Asia Pacific Economic Community what do you mea= I mean how would<br />
you see the Community working in practice?<br />
PM: Well, if~ s already more integrated if you look at the APEC countries their trade<br />
with one another already has them at a higher level of integration than the European<br />
Community or NAFTA. So, the attendance of the leaders of these countries anid the<br />
membership, the membership of APEC the confirmation of the current membership of<br />
A. C at leadership level and for its agenda which will be a trde liberalising and trade<br />
inducing agenda means that as a group of countries it is defined and it can only be<br />
defined as an economic community of countries. So that the initegration we already have,<br />
which is alrcady high, we hope to be able to improve and to improve the velocity of<br />
growth and trade. So that everybody wins from an APEC-typ arrangement.<br />
1: Arc you and Mr Clinton confident the three Chinas problem can be overcome?<br />
PM: I think that thats likely that China will attend and that is currently being<br />
discussed, of course, and hopefully they will attend at a very high level.<br />
J1: You mentioved in your 9 Februar'y speech a much wider agenda for A. PEC than<br />
had bee previously put forward. Has the U. S. admnistration and particularly<br />
President Clinton embraced those points and any of them specifically in terms of the<br />
November rneeting?<br />
PM: Well, I think they see that general direction as the right direction, whether every<br />
particular point is embruced or not, in a sense. is immaterial provided the general<br />
direction is one where we work at ways of lowering impediments to trade and<br />
investment. And whether it be through dealing with protective devices, non-tariff barriers<br />
or harmonisation of standards, these are all things which I think fit very nicly into most<br />
of the participant member countries' ambitions for APEC,<br />
J: How seriously should we take President Clinton'g assurances on the EEP? As<br />
seriou. sly as we took George Bush's or does he go beyond that?<br />
PM: Well. I think the important thing to recognise is that the Export Enhancement<br />
Program is legislated by the United States Congress. So it has Congressional authority<br />
Iit-lfleislation. The key thing then is how it is administered. What the President<br />
was saying today was giving you an indication of how he would administer it as he had<br />
earlier given me at the lunch, as we discussed this question at some length. And that's<br />
why I think he was very forthcoming at the press conference in what be had to say about </p>
<p>it. And he had indicated earlier that the U. S. staying out of the Indonesian market was<br />
already and indication of how the U. S. feels toww&amp; d Australia in terms of the EEP, but<br />
making the more obvious point that the best w~ ayI6 deal with it is a successful] conclusion<br />
of the GATT Round, which is about pulling these subsidies down. And the Blar House<br />
Accords so, you know, his commitment today is in that context and I think we have to<br />
accept it in that context.<br />
J: Prime Minister you described APEC and NAFTA as a compatible GATTr overlay.<br />
tn the event of t~ he Uruguay Round not going ahead can you see these two discrete area<br />
communities in some way rnergng into a big compatible trade grouping against the EEC?<br />
PM: Wells that's certainly not envisaged at the moment. And I think that it will take, in<br />
practical terms, many years to affect a trade liberalising and harmnising agenda within<br />
APEC and also no doubt, withini NAFTA. I don't see any profit in speaking of APEC as a<br />
protective grouping. B~ ecause I think the greater opportunity exists in openness in trade<br />
and I don't think we should assume, at this stage anyway, that the GATT Round is going<br />
to fail-We are coming towards the end of the fast-track deadline which the Congress has<br />
given the President, of December 15, so the weight is on as far as GATTr is concerned.<br />
Hopefiully we'll get an agreement on the GATT but the GATT doesn't deal with non-tariff<br />
barriers and its going to take more than the GATT to deal with that anyway. So. wc've<br />
got to think of ways of dealing with sorne of these other problems amd fanly when you<br />
look at a lot of the APEC economies many of the devices are frankly hurting themselves.<br />
And when I think that people understand that they will pitch in and commnit themselves to<br />
a broader agenda.<br />
J: Mr Keating, with the easing of Cold War tensions have the Amnericans at all<br />
implied that they might want to reduce the scale of their intelligence and defence<br />
, operations in Australia?<br />
PM: Well. the Americans are doing what is called a bottom up review of their whole<br />
defence structure as a result of the Cold War and obviously there will be a somewhat<br />
smaller core force than they have largely had over the intervening twenty or thirty years.<br />
And that will probably mean a reassessment by them in terms of intelligence collections<br />
and what they think is worthwhile and what, if you like, methods of collection are<br />
imnportnt to then,. I would tend to think the Australian facilitieswill still have relevance<br />
to the United States a long time into the future. Even if, in some primary way, their<br />
intelligence gathering shifts.<br />
1: NU Keating, in any time in your discussions with the Amrericans did you tell them<br />
that their agricultural subsidies whce ompared with their free trade rhetoric, were<br />
hypocritical? </p>
<p>PM: No, because the Ameicans have been the largest, most burly sentry at the gate of<br />
fiee trade for the last seven year through the GATT Round. So there's not much point in<br />
saying to a real ally on this question that they are iing hypocritical, because I don't think<br />
theyore. They've taken up EEP and some of these agricultural subsidies in defence of<br />
their position in markets against the European Community, But they know that it's<br />
distorting their pattern of agricultural production and their budget and that is why they are<br />
very committed to the Blair H-ouse Accord to bring those price and volume levels<br />
down in subsidies. So. that happening, all these other things will in a sense, take care of<br />
themselves. So the key point is to succeed on the GAIT and to do things which help the<br />
GATT to succeed. beating in mind we've had a substantial, again, coramitment on the<br />
Export Enhancement Program.<br />
I3: Presidentt Clinton said today that America would go out of its way to avoid<br />
hurting Australia's trading interests. Do you take that as a stronger commitment than they<br />
have made in the paut on that?<br />
PM: Well it's quite a specific commitment, that's what is important. It is a specific<br />
commitment and it is one which he reiterated to me at some length over lunch and one<br />
which, I think, having thought about it he was prepared to reiterate in public later.<br />
J: Do you have in your own mind some timetable for the development of APEC?<br />
How it might develop over the decade and do you have any idea how it might be<br />
prevented from becorning rather open ended and just going on and on and on for several<br />
years without malting the sort of progress dint we might want.<br />
PM: Well. it's developing at a very fast pace. I mean, to take this thing from its<br />
infancy in 1989 to what it will be, I hope, by the end of this year is the development of a<br />
body of this dimension in, one would have to say, very quick time. And, therefore, I<br />
don't Lament that we're not going fast enough. We are going quickly enough and were we<br />
to go any faster we would not be getting the appropriate coinitment or consensus<br />
amonos the member countries that will materially advance APEC's cause. So I don't<br />
think there should be any concern about any tardiness in developing APEC and it sort of<br />
drifting on. I think there's been a lot of focused attention by major powers the U. S. in<br />
particular Japan, Korea and the ASEAN countries and as well as other large playein<br />
like China.<br />
J: Tn meeting with President Clinton you talked about the importance of establishing<br />
a personal relationship with him. How did you find himn as a man in the meeting today?<br />
PM:-Well, I gave you some indication in my opening remarks. I think that I found<br />
him interesting, charming an engaging fellow who obviously is in the business of<br />
doing good public works. That is, looking for good outcomes, trying to push U. S. policy </p>
<p>.7.<br />
in the right directions foT good reasoAs and that Sort of openness and public spiritcdness.<br />
one would have to find that comforting in any cqntext given that the President of the<br />
United States has such a pivotal role in ii ention*. policy and the leadership of the<br />
world in mnany area. To find someone so interested in policy so mnuch at ease with the<br />
intricacy of policy and looking for good outcomes simultaneously is, J think, quite<br />
comforting for anybody let alone another head of government.<br />
J; Is he your sort of President?<br />
PM: Well. jtes not a mater of saying whether bes my sort of President, I think that the<br />
United States has done very well in finding Bill Clinton as it's President. And this his<br />
thoughtfUlnecss and openness is just what America needs, I think at this time to engage<br />
some of these big questions, to set up the strategic directions. to look at the big picture<br />
and to follow it through to logical conclusions.<br />
J: You did speak today about the need to put flesh on bones of APEC before thene's<br />
an expansion of NAETA into South Amecrica Are your worried that uless APEC gets<br />
some sort of a move on following your agenda that America's interest will tend to be<br />
dra'm southwards rather thin into Asia?<br />
PM: No, if you look at the North Amnerican economies and the peckinig order for<br />
membership of NAFTA in South America, it's not going to dranarally change the<br />
weight of North American GDP. But it is going to extend opportunities into South<br />
America. There is a view in Asia that NAPTA has an introspective, inward looking<br />
quality about it That is a view. What * I was saying today is that if we put some flesh on<br />
the bones of APEC so that it is clear to those countries that APEC is actually developing<br />
sensibly, properly, expeditiously there'll be less concern about NAFTA and its directions.<br />
3: How imnportant is it that APEC is institutionalised at a leaders' level? And also do<br />
you foresee any problems in the future where United States human rights policies couild<br />
cause some trouble for APEC members?<br />
PM: Well, I think it is very important that APEC is institutional ised. Because without<br />
the authority of the leaders of the governmeots of the member countries it won't get the<br />
agenda it deserves. It won't get the political borsepower it needs to break through some<br />
of these problems. Arnd, so apart from the utility of actually getting the job done it also<br />
gives it status and weight which I think is important to it. On the human rights question I<br />
don't see that it would be any larger a problem in an APEC context than it would be in<br />
any other context.<br />
J: Prime Minister the Congress has expressed a view about the Beijing bid for the<br />
Olympics-Was that at all raised in your talks, either Yesterday or today? </p>
<p>t.<br />
PM; No. No it wasn't.<br />
J: ( iadbe rsdn Suhazno attendi4the APEC meeting. Are you hoping to<br />
prOvide some sort of link into the East Asian caucus there and how are t talks<br />
progressing with Malaysia and Indonesia on A. PEC?<br />
PM: Well, 1 think. Certainly with Indonesia. President Suharto has played a<br />
very important role in the acceptance of APEC within the ASEAN group of countries and<br />
his attedance itself is important. And be can play a furter role, I think, in seeking to<br />
define APECs directions and indeed. doing so speaking on behalf of the ASEAN group<br />
of countries. So, I do see his role as being fairly important it has already been, to<br />
APEC and to the development of leaders meetings which I think has been facilitated or<br />
helped in par by his very clear acceptance of the need for them and his attendance.<br />
3: The lack of discussion here about t security angles of Australian-American<br />
relations reflects the state of the world but could you give us some idea of what you and<br />
Mr Aspin talked about in your meeting? Particularly what you see now as the main<br />
security issues in the region for Amrerica and Australia.<br />
PM: Well, I made clear to him that the alliance that we have between Australia and the<br />
United States is a key part of our defence and foreign policy stance. That we have a long<br />
term relationship obviously, and that relationship is doing as well today as it has ever<br />
done. But that said, we'd also had our own Force structmr review in the middle 19808.<br />
Whit. e we could not have anticipated the expeditious completion of the Cold War, if you<br />
like, end of the Cold War and that change. Our Force structure review was actually set up<br />
as though, in some way we knew that was going to happen. And the result that carne<br />
from it gives Australia a more independent defence capability and capacity than it would<br />
otherwise have. But that's part of, still, a broader defence and foreign policy relationship<br />
with the United States in the region.<br />
And I suppose our general message to the United States is, that while these bilateral<br />
defence treatiestmattr to the region and to the United States they will matter more<br />
if the commercial relationship is thickened-up. That is, if the trade and investment links<br />
in the area continue to improve, particularly between the U. S. and the region. So, the old<br />
notion that the British had that where the flag goes the trade will follow iA now -I think<br />
you're seeing the converse of that -where the trade goes the flag will follow. That is,<br />
that the defence and strategic relationship can actually dove tail in, complement a broader<br />
trade and investment relationship.<br />
I. On a defence related issue, did you and the President talk at all today about the<br />
New Zealand nuclear issue and do you detect any softening on the U. S. part any desire<br />
to change the strategic isolation situation?<br />
! pnflA TnON t't7: CT QFrd~ c-CT </p>
<p>.9.<br />
PM: No, the Preident and I didn't. But I did with Scretaiy Aspin and I think our<br />
position on that is as it has been of late. That is, that we look forward to New Zealand<br />
rtrning to Mii ally status under ANZUS and we~ h Australia would encourage that<br />
happening as indeed, so would the United States. But I think we have a commuon view<br />
that it won't happen and shouldn't happen that iS, a retur to Wul ally starus unless<br />
and until New Zealand accepts the obligations of that status.<br />
[( Ifnot on the strategic then what about on the political issue. Do you see the U. S.<br />
softening their position about elevating political tics with New Zealand?<br />
PM: Well, I didn't press Secretary Aspin on that but I think that the United States does<br />
have a vMi comnmon sense view of this. They are leaving an ambience about this that<br />
eneouages or leaves open the option for New Zealand to retur to this kind of situation<br />
or status which they formerly enjoyed, and would encourage them to do that. So I don't<br />
think the United States will be doing anything at the political level which discourages<br />
that J: ( inaudible)., link between defence and trade. Did you propose at any of your<br />
meetings thAt Austr-alia and the U. S. share intelligence gathered at the joint bases, with<br />
some of our Asian neighbours?<br />
PM: No.<br />
J: On the GATT. the agreement with you and President Clinton to call on the French<br />
not to do what they look like they are going to do. Why should that make any difference?<br />
PM-Well, I think the Europeans have got to understand that an acceptance by them of<br />
French argument about the Blair House Accord a view on the part of France that it<br />
seeks to open the Blair Mou. se Accord means that the fast track schedule of December<br />
is likely to leave the United States without the legislative authority to conclude the<br />
Round. And that an unwinding of Blair House places onus and responsibility on the<br />
French in particular and the Europeans in general for the problems the Pound would then<br />
have its likely failure. And to say that we regard an unwinding of the Blair House<br />
Accord as unacceptable. They are a minmum set of standards, a set of minimat agreed<br />
beyond which, we believe, we should not go. And having been agreed that it is now<br />
inappropriate at this very late stage in the piece for the Government of France to try and<br />
undo them.<br />
J When is the soonest that you thidnk Australia cant hope for a totA abolition of<br />
EEP? </p>
<p>PM: WeU, again you asked me a question earlier about this. I see EEP in the context<br />
of the Uruguay Round and the remedy to these kiros of intrusive trade subsidies as being<br />
a general solution to trade which can come from a-ilntcrnational response. So, all the<br />
moie reason why I think that Blair House needs to be maintained. And if it is maintained<br />
then the Round can be concluded within the Decemnber 15 deadline.<br />
J; But there would obviously be a lag between a successful Uruguay Round and any<br />
winding down of EEl'. So what's the timeftame as far as..?<br />
PM: I'ye riot had any discussion about that.<br />
J: ( inaudible),.. subjects you covered with Mr Clinton. And did you discuss Health,<br />
for instance?<br />
PM. We discussed the Australian health care system. We discussed Australian social<br />
policy. We discusse the Australian corporate tax system. We discussed other social<br />
innovations like the Child Support Agency. He was very interested in the way in which<br />
thewc agencies have been developed over time these innovative things we've used the<br />
Australian taxaion system for. Dividend imputation and its influences on the equities<br />
market and on the investment, The utility of our health insurance system and how it<br />
works. [ t was quite an interesting lunch time conversation over all these isses.<br />
J: Mr Keating, a few days from today the Olympic bid will be open. What do you<br />
plan to say in your final pitch in Monaco to sway anybody who might still be sitting on<br />
the fence, about whether Sydney is the best place for the Olympics?<br />
PM: Making the obvious points about Sydney and its being the most superior of the<br />
bids in technical termns. That Sydney is the at this time arguably the best bid, that<br />
Australia is a county which has showni more than its share of the Olympic spirit. That it<br />
has been in it for the sport of it and the Olympic ideals and that as the year 2000 is<br />
obviously going to be the era of the Pacific, Sydney is the right choice.<br />
3: There was some talk around the White House today that China might get the bid<br />
because it is more politically correct. That people need Chinese trade more than<br />
Australian trade-H-ow do you counteract those arguments?<br />
PM: Well, I diink there has to be in the minds of the Olympic Committee the need to<br />
keep the inteerity of the Olympic movement clear in terms of the process of selction and<br />
the motivation of the selection. And that geopolitics is not the business of the<br />
International Olympic Committee. Its business is seleciing host cities for the Olympic<br />
Games and that should go to the interests of the competitors and the interests of the<br />
