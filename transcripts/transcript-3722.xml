PRIME MINISTER'S QUEENSLAND BROADCAST NO. 6<br />
DEFENCE<br />
Sunday 27 April 1975<br />
Since the recent unhappy turn of events in Indo-China<br />
the Opposition parties in Canberra have been rubbing their<br />
hands in glee in the belief that they can capitalise on a<br />
supposed weakness in Australia's defences. They have fostered<br />
the myth the damaging myth that our defences are neglected<br />
and run-down. Of course, where defence matters are concerned,<br />
I don't suppose we should take much notice of the men who<br />
bungled the Flil deal and got us disastrously involved in<br />
the war in Vietnam. But it's important that their latest<br />
accusations be promptly nailed. Here in Queensland there<br />
are more major d ! fence bases and installations than in any<br />
other State. Defence is a natural concern to you. The fact<br />
is that Australia's defences are strong and vigorous. We<br />
have highly trained, well-equipped professional forces<br />
better peacetime forces than-ever before.<br />
And the important thing to remember is that under a<br />
Labor Government our defences have been maintained without<br />
conscription. One of the first things we did was abolish<br />
the detested and inefficient call-up of Australia's youth.<br />
We can take it that the Opposition don't object to that<br />
decision because they have sinice told us after some<br />
prompting that they wouldn't reintroduce conscription<br />
themselves. So let's look at the figures that really matterthe<br />
volunteer forces, the professional servicemen who are<br />
making service life their career. In December 1972, when<br />
the previous Government went out, the volunteer strength of<br />
the three services was 69,195. Today it is actually a little<br />
higher 69,200. And the increase we have authorised in the<br />
army strength will take it from 31,500 to 34,000 by the end<br />
of next year the biggest peacetime army Australia has ever<br />
had. Or look at it in money terms. In the last full year<br />
of Liberal-Country Party government, Australia was spending<br />
$ 1217 million a year-on defence. This financial year we'll<br />
be spending almost $ 1800 million the equivalent of $ 5 million<br />
a day. We're not wasting that money on unhappy young conscripts.<br />
We're spending it on the arms, the equipment, the professional<br />
training that will make our defences as good as those of any<br />
comparable country.<br />
The Opposition make much of the Government's supposed<br />
belief that Australia faces no threat for 10 or 15 years.<br />
No one has ever said that an attack on Australia is impossible. </p>
<p>We have concluded, on the basis of the best advice available,<br />
that such an attack is highly unlikely within 10 years or<br />
more. That is the advice the previous Government received<br />
* and it came from the same authorities who advise my own<br />
Government on the strategic situation. That situation is<br />
constantly under review, Of course there will always be<br />
uncertainties from time to time. No one can guarantee<br />
a period of full uninterrupted peace. But that's no reason<br />
for believing that an external threat is imminent. To<br />
assume that what is possible must be probable would mean<br />
putting the country on a permanent war footing with all<br />
that would mean for the economy and the welfare of our<br />
people. We have to be quite realistic about this and<br />
realism doesn't mean fearing the worst, or, as I sometimes<br />
suspect, hoping for the worst. I have no time for those<br />
who want to whip up panic, weaken the people's faith in<br />
the strength of our forces and the morale of the forces<br />
themselves. Our whole emphasis has been on efficient organisation,<br />
modern equipment and well-paid professional servicemen.<br />
One of our first actions was to amalgamate the separate<br />
service departments into a. strong, combined Department of<br />
Defence. Further reorganisation is still to come. We<br />
have set about a major program of defence procurement.<br />
Last year we announced plans for two new patrol frigates,<br />
53 replacement tanks for the Army, long-range maritime<br />
patrol aircraft and 45 new fire support vehicles. We are<br />
ensuring that Australian industry has a fair participation<br />
in our procurement of equipment from overseas. To date,<br />
the total value of orders placed on Australian industry<br />
under reciprocal purchasing arrangements exceeds $ 72. million.<br />
We are not just buying hardware from abroad.<br />
hb have many other plans for defence equipment and<br />
the modernisation of defence facilities dockyards, naval<br />
bases, training centres and the like. But, first and foremost,<br />
we recognise the need for dedicated, well-paid, secure and<br />
professionally-minded manpower. Only by making service life<br />
attractive and rewarding will we develop the basis of a<br />
sound defence effort. Sometimes I think that retirement<br />
benefits for officers were made so attractive that too many<br />
of them left the services to take advantage of them. -Nevertheless,<br />
we have established a generous new defence force<br />
retirement and death benefit scheme. There is a $ 1000 tax-free<br />
bonus for re-engagements; wider eligibility for defence service<br />
housing loans; a wider application of repatriation benefits;<br />
approval for credit unions in the services; progressive upgrading<br />
of married quarters and other living accommodation;<br />
improved resettlement benefits. We have appointed an<br />
ombudsman for the services whose job is to investigate<br />
complaints of unfair treatment or miscarriage of justice. </p>
<p>Ih short we are laying the basis for a happy,<br />
secure life in the peacetime forces of our country.<br />
As one who spent four years in the services I know how<br />
important that is. And with the other reforms we have<br />
made, and the equipment programs under way, I have no<br />
doubt-that Australia is in a better position than she<br />
has ever been to meet any military threat or military<br />
obligation in the foreseeable future. </p>
