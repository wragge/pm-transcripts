CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
14TH CONGRESS OF THE CONFEDERATION OF MEDICAL<br />
ASSOCIATIONS IN ASIA/ OCEANIA<br />
SYDNEY 12 NOVEMBER 1985<br />
Dr Lindsay Thompson<br />
Distinguished Guests<br />
At the outset I should like to thank the Chairman of the<br />
Organising Committee of the 14th Congress of the<br />
Confederation of Medical Associations of Asia and<br />
Oceania, Dr Lindsay Thompson, for the kind invitation to<br />
address your official dinner this evening. I should<br />
also like to congratulate Lindsay on his appointment as<br />
President of the Confederation an office to which he<br />
will bring great expertise and dignity. I<br />
May I also welcome overseas visitors to Australia. The<br />
Congress is another example of the growing recognition<br />
of the importance of co-operation between countries in<br />
the Asia/ Oceania region in areas where the exchange of<br />
information and expertise can offer significant benefits<br />
to the populations of the participating countries.<br />
Only last Friday I was privileged to be at the opening<br />
of the new building for the Walter and Eliza Hall<br />
Institute of Medical Research in Melbourne. That<br />
Institute, and others like it in Australia, are<br />
developing a growing relationship with researchers in<br />
Asia and Oceania. The Institute's work on developing a<br />
malaria vaccine, for instance, is of tremendous<br />
significance for Asia and Oceania.<br />
During this century there have been impressive advances<br />
in medical science. In 1979 smallpox was officially<br />
declared to be eradicated on a worldwide basis.<br />
Poliomyelitis, tuberculosis, typhoid, all killers or<br />
causes of substantial suffering, irreversible<br />
disability, grief and social stigma have been pushed<br />
into the background. Inevitable childhood diseases such<br />
as measles, mumps and rubella are effectively<br />
preventable nowadays with the elimination of such </p>
<p>-2<br />
dreaded complications as encephalitis, deafness and<br />
congenital deformations. Birth control has been made<br />
highly effective and relatively safe resulting in a<br />
substantial reduction in the physical and psychological<br />
burden of unwanted pregnancy. Pregnancy itself, birth<br />
and parenthood are no longer so clouded with the nagging<br />
prospects of losing either the child or the mother or<br />
both. On the other hand, success in eradicating the diseases<br />
of childhood or childbirth seems to have produced a<br />
transferance of the health problem to those who now<br />
survive through to adulthood.<br />
In most of the advanced countries newborns of both sexes<br />
can now look forward to an average lifespan of more than<br />
years. In many countries concern is now being<br />
expressed at the impact of ageing of the population on<br />
health care costs and the nature of health care<br />
services. The quality of life of these senior citizens<br />
has been enhanced through control of painful or<br />
disabling conditions ranging from dental care and hip<br />
replacement to cardiac pacemakers.<br />
It is one of the ironies of life that this impressive<br />
record of performance and the expectations about things<br />
to come is accompanied by growing apprehension about the<br />
alarming rate at which health care costs keep rising.<br />
This apprehension is compounded by misgivings about an<br />
emphasis on technological capabilities at the cost of<br />
human dignity. Questions and doubts about the real<br />
impact of health care on health status and on life<br />
expectancy are increasingly being voiced and echoed<br />
through the media and in the public arena. Some argue<br />
with the uncritical support of many that health care<br />
resources could be spent more effectively on other<br />
social endeavours.<br />
It is important to point out, however, that a<br />
fundamental principle of my Government's health care<br />
policy is that no Australian is denied access to medical<br />
treatment in the community and public hospital services.<br />
The Medicare health insurance program which we<br />
established is a simple, fair, and affordable health<br />
insurance system that provides basic health cover to all<br />
Australians. I believe that Medicare is one of my Government's most<br />
significant social reforms. Medicare's universal health<br />
insurance coverage has brought to an end the<br />
unacceptable situation where under the previous<br />
Government two million poor and disadvantaged<br />
Australians were without health insurance. </p>
<p>-3<br />
My Government's initiatives in community health have, to<br />
date, been based on the Medicare arrangements. It was<br />
Medicare which laid the foundation of an expansion of<br />
community health programs for which an additional<br />
was provided in 1984/ 85. This funding has been<br />
continued. Priority now needs to be given to closing<br />
gaps between existing programs and extending existing<br />
community health activities, particularly in the area of<br />
allied health professionals to support the already well<br />
established network of general practitioner services.<br />
Through increased Federal Government funding and<br />
involvement there is the opportunity to influence the<br />
direction of the provision of community health.<br />
Medicare is founded in a mixed system of health care<br />
provision. Private medical practice continues in public<br />
hospitals, and private hospitals provide about 20% of<br />
total hospital bed days in Australia. The Government<br />
believes that the private sector has an important and<br />
continuing role to play in the co-ordinated delivery of<br />
health care services and is endeavouring to remove<br />
unnecessary regulation. As a part of the package to<br />
resolve the recent NSW Doctors Dispute, for example,<br />
detailed negotiations are underway to achieve<br />
deregulation of private hospitals at the Commonwealth<br />
level. It must not be assumed that there are no significant<br />
problems remaining. The recent report by the Federal<br />
Parliamentary Public Accounts Committee, and subsequent<br />
hearings, exposed serious concern about the provision of<br />
pathology services under the fee for service system.<br />
These concerns, I should hasten to add, were expressed<br />
by the major Australian medical associations, the Royal<br />
College of Pathologists, patients and others. The<br />
Government does not believe that the criticisms and the<br />
significant costs of such services can be ignored.<br />
The Government is committed to the operation of an<br />
efficient, high standard health care system through<br />
Medicare at a cost that is affordable to the Australian<br />
people. It is important that increases in health costs<br />
be restrained particularly in those areas where serious<br />
problems have been identified. The Minister for Health,<br />
Dr Blewett, has already given notice that the Government<br />
intends to address problems in the pathology industry.<br />
Many of the problems facing Government stem from<br />
technological advances that promise to save and extend<br />
lives, but are very costly. As this technology moves<br />
from the experimental stage to adoption in the<br />
mainstream of medicine, it will pose some difficult<br />
social dilemmas. Should, for example, care be provided<br />
in cases where expected costs may appear </p>
<p>-4<br />
disproportionately high. Should the latest technology<br />
be introduced before it has been fully evaluated for<br />
efficacy and cost effectiveness against existing<br />
technology.<br />
A recent report on " Into the Twenty First Century: The<br />
Development of Social Security" by the International<br />
Labour Office points out that:<br />
" It would be undesirable to-limit medical progress<br />
or to restrict access to the benefits of medical<br />
technology which can demonstrably improve the<br />
quality of life. As our societies become richer,<br />
it is in this area that we are convinced that<br />
people want to see more money spent particularly<br />
on improvements in the quality of care given to the<br />
aged and the dying as well as in the life prospects<br />
of children."<br />
The ILO report further observes that, while there have<br />
been clear breakthroughs in improving the quality of<br />
life for many groups of patients in the past 30 years,<br />
the extent of the improvement should not be exaggerated.<br />
The report argues that the vast increase in health<br />
spending has not accelerated the decline in mortality<br />
rates ( relative to the previous 30 years) and that there<br />
is no clear link between spending on curative services<br />
and better health.<br />
Some other problems which I believe need to be addressed<br />
by Australia and other countries include:<br />
Wi the current bias towards care in institutional<br />
settings relative to care in outpatient<br />
settings;<br />
( ii) the bias towards short-term acute and curative<br />
medicine and the inadequate attention to the<br />
prevention of illness and health promotion;<br />
( iii) the lack of interest in the role of volunteer or<br />
other helpers who could supplement public<br />
programs in addressing need; and<br />
( iv) for some of the countries represented at this<br />
Congress, improvement in the status of public<br />
health is important and it must both anticipate<br />
and respond to the needs of specific<br />
populations.<br />
Progress in resolving some of these important policy<br />
issues will depend on the development of new approaches<br />
to the delivery of cost effective health care services. </p>
<p>-x<br />
5<br />
Globally Governments are restricted in the resources<br />
they can make available for medical efforts to save<br />
lives. I hope that the forthcoming Reagan/ Gorbachev<br />
Summit will result in decisions regarding arms control<br />
which could make available more resources devoted to<br />
saving human life.<br />
I am aware that some of these health policy issues will<br />
be touched on in the scientific program of the Congress.<br />
I hope that limits to the availability of public<br />
resources in the field of health care are recognised and<br />
that attention will be directed to identifying the most<br />
effective ways in which these resources can be used.<br />
Again I would like to thank you for your kind invitation<br />
to speak to you tonight. I wish the Congress every<br />
success and hope that Congress delegates who are<br />
visiting Australia find their stay professionally and<br />
personally rewarding.<br />
Thank you. </p>
