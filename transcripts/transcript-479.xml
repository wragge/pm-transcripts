SPE2CH BY 2HE FRIYE I4ISTER T. HON. RG.<br />
ITTHE 7OUOS0 ? P1-LSNT. TIVES<br />
THJURSD-Y. lbT M . RC, 1962<br />
I think I shiuld like to begin by cnplirenting the<br />
honourable member for Phillip ( Mr. Einfeld) who has just sat<br />
down, n his maiden speech. He will not be surprised to find<br />
that there are some passages in it with -hich I do not agree,<br />
but I did think that he shuld be conplirented on the way in<br />
which he put it.<br />
This is a very important debato. It is a new Parliament<br />
and it is a very narrowly divided Parlianont. Whatover<br />
division occurs in this House will be a close division.<br />
Thorefore, I propose to address myself to the first challenge<br />
which has been very &gt; roperly made by the Loeader of the<br />
Opposition ( Mr. Calwoll) at an oarly stage, to the continued<br />
existence of the Govcrnm. ent. I Ido not 4uarrel with that at all.<br />
That is exactly the course that I uould ha ve taken nyself in his<br />
place because it is of great nonent, not only to Parliament, but<br />
to the people of ustralia that the broad position of the<br />
Governmient in this Parliament should be determ ined at the<br />
earliest possible nmoment.<br />
Having said that, I ar. bound to confess that the<br />
speech made by ny honourable friend, the Lead-r of the<br />
Opposition and it was far-roaching and the amendment that<br />
he has moved do not soon to mc to be entirely closely related.<br />
In the course of his speech he contioned a few of the points in<br />
the namendment but certainly not all of then. I do not conplain<br />
about that because within the limits of any decent time<br />
allowable in Parliament it is not possible to cover too wide a<br />
field. But the difference between the speech and the amnendrmnt.<br />
was, I thought, worthy ) f passing comrment, as we say<br />
occasionally in this H. use One night aluost have thought that<br />
they had been 2Grafted by different people.<br />
In what I have to say to: night I propose to deal with<br />
matters of substance or, at any rato, with a sufficient number<br />
of matters of substanco to fit within the reasonable c-npass of<br />
one speech. I begin by saying that wo are not here, I imagine,<br />
to fight the last election. I have had . n enormous number of<br />
elections in Uy time. and I have swanted up and own the<br />
country in the course of thea. Ihen they are over I do not want<br />
to have to do thom agDain. I hope that I nay be forgiven this<br />
rather ch! arling ihuman woaknoss. lle are net here to fight the<br />
last eloction, That has booeen fought and there has been a<br />
sensational result, 1whether you look at it either from the<br />
Gvornment point of view or the Opposition point of view. But<br />
what we are here to detormine is whether in this now Parliament,<br />
on the Govern o-r-General's Speooch and our recently mnnounced<br />
economic measures, wre deserve the censure of this H-uso. It is<br />
the censure of this House that is being sought, not a rahash of<br />
a general election. On that kind of issue the onus is on the<br />
Opposition, and th. o attack is properly maeo by the Leader of the<br />
Opposition. As I will demo: nstrate ' before I conculc, he has not<br />
made up his nr. ind as to the . r. un1s of his attach: or the<br />
principles u; o-n which he attacks. Everything that he said in<br />
the course of his sreech here I iwant to pay tribute to his<br />
durability because he has said something , very day since polling<br />
day can be undcrst')-d nly if it is roLbored I comle to<br />
this right away that he is deeply influencod by his rich and<br />
powercrful friends in the well-nmown Fairfax-Hend rs on-Calwoll<br />
axis. It is rather an agreablo tli. ought that the prince of<br />
s:) cialists, even though he has voluntarily abdicated that<br />
position for three years, should now find h-' mself in such sweet<br />
communii on with the rich, All-the old battles that he has had<br />
have been forgotten temporarily. </p>
<p>My friend and colleague, the honourable ue. bor for<br />
Moreton ( Mr. Killen) mrde some rofurence to this rather<br />
unkind, I thought, but rmuch enjoyed oy people here. But all<br />
those old battles are now forgotten. I would almost say to my<br />
colleague " Pray do not disturb the p) ace; these are forgotten".<br />
" The Old Curi.. sity Shop" and Charles Dickens are forgotten,<br />
Indeed, " The Old Curiosity Shop" with its iimn.. rtal description<br />
of Mr. Quilp has been iineffect, burned, by the comnJon han:; an.<br />
Dear Arthur and Dear Rupert now see each other in a kindlier<br />
light. All passion is spent. There is a new unity ticket.<br />
They are united by the contemplation of a cormmon enemy. Of<br />
course it is in that capacity, as ell as in the trifling<br />
capacity of being the Prinm Minister, that I ad ross the House<br />
tonight. The process of roadjustmrent has had its painful non: ents<br />
but it has been concluded, I an happy to record, in a<br />
gentlemanly way. On their part, the " Sydney Morning Herald"<br />
masters publicly co2.--itted thensolvos to the view that though<br />
being professed anti-sDcialists, they would sooner support a<br />
true blue socialist , gover: enn t than the Liberal Governrent which<br />
they accused of some socialist practices. This is an exercise<br />
in logic which, I an sure, will engage the study of people in<br />
the philosophy schools of the universities for years to come.<br />
At a certain stage some one I think it was one of my<br />
colleagues very rudely said that there Must hcve been some<br />
contract between the socialist leader and the capitalist<br />
" Sydney Morning Herald". They rejected this. The " Sydney<br />
Morning Herald" iasters even went to the dangerous length of<br />
writing a special article on their political principles and<br />
that had all the charm of novelty. In the course of this<br />
article I copied their very words which is what they seldom<br />
do with me they said<br />
" There could be no contract with Labour unless the " Herald"<br />
that is the " Sydney Morning Herald", the Labour paper<br />
" were prepared to subscribe to the platfor-m of the Labour<br />
Party but this, as overy one must know, is out of the<br />
question".<br />
This was a stateent of profundity and piety, was it not. " For<br />
us to subscribe to the policy of the Labour Party is out of the<br />
question". Of course, it takes two to make a bargain. When I<br />
read that statement I recalled at once that after all the<br />
Leader of the Opposition had done his part because in his policy<br />
speech he had said that if elected he would forget all about the<br />
socialist objective the policy of the Labour Party for three<br />
years. His very words were<br />
" We pronise not to raise the question of nationalisation<br />
during the lifetine of the Twentyfourth Parliaent".<br />
I believe I am right in saying that this is the Twentyfourth<br />
Parliament. So there we are. The " Herald" said, " We could<br />
never support Labour because we object to its policy." Pray<br />
forget itdear boy, because we will forget about the policy for<br />
three years. On this happy note of harmony the business went<br />
on. A kind of entente cordialo was then established and the<br />
Government, having suffered heavy losses at the election, as I<br />
publicly, freely and obviously confessed, ny distinguished<br />
friends, the Leader of the Opposition becane excited, and made<br />
strange statements daily. </p>
<p>On the economic question which hy ban selected for this<br />
censure amondhent there is a most curious sequence of events to<br />
which I want to direct the attention of the Parliament. On 7th<br />
February this year I issued a statement containing the Cabinet's<br />
decisions on a variety of matters to which I shall refer later<br />
in detail payments to the States in the form of grants which<br />
are not repayable; borrowing by somi Government and local<br />
government bodies; unemployment benefits; income tax rebates;<br />
motor vehicle sales tax; war service hones loans; housing<br />
loans by savings banks; Commoiw ealth works; investment<br />
allowances; quantitative restriction of imports and Development<br />
Bank capital. This was a wide range of matters on which I made<br />
the statement arising from very close Cabinet discussion after a<br />
long series ofconferences with properly interested people in<br />
various sections of Australia. The first comment made by my<br />
friend he rushed in at once to make it was that the<br />
Government's announcement disclosed no basic change in policy.<br />
I ask honourable members to remember this. There is no<br />
basic change in policy, and this gets the headlines. It is a<br />
quick commaent; but a day later no doubt enriched by alvice in<br />
the appropriate quarter, he switched his grounds. He said that<br />
we had reversed our policy. That is a pretty good performance,<br />
is it not, for a man to say one day that it is the samo policy<br />
and in reference to the same sto. tcment, to say 24 hours later<br />
that you have reversed the policy? He said we had now adopted<br />
his policy, and indeed my jesting friend the honourable member<br />
for Grayndler ( Mr. Daly) repeatod this and somebody else that I<br />
heard this afternoon repeated it that we have stolen Labour's<br />
policy. 3ut so that he should not go too far in that direction<br />
he said we had done it too late. That was the second edition.<br />
There was the authorised version, and the revised version and<br />
this must be the new one, because on Tuesday last in this<br />
Parliament he turned around again and set out to prove not that<br />
we had stolen Labour's policy but that our proposals were<br />
worthless. It is a little bit hard on his followers, mixed as<br />
they be, to tell them that Labour's policy is worthless.<br />
Really, this comes a little hard, does it not? I sympathized<br />
with my friends opposite when he said it " Our proposals are<br />
worthless" He is in a dilemma, of course, which is no novel<br />
experience. He cannot say that we have adopted his policy<br />
because he has condemned every proposition put forward in my<br />
stateuent of 27th February with wihich he dealt in the course of<br />
his speech. If honourable members will just check for<br />
themselves they will see how completely right that is. I will<br />
illustrate it.<br />
He attacked our tax cut. He will not have it. He says<br />
it is loaded in favour of the rich. So that is wrong. That is<br />
not the Labour policy. He finds the added money for the States<br />
and for local governr-ent and semi-governmental bodies a total<br />
of œ 25m. in four months, grossly inadequate. And unlike the<br />
Premiers who came here to receive it he doubts and I again<br />
quote his words " Whether there will be any increase in the<br />
rate of spending on public works at all." Every Premier who came<br />
here, of whatever party, was able to say " This will enable us to<br />
put a lot of things into operation and give a lot of employment".<br />
But the honourable . entleman, the Loader of the Opposition, whose<br />
profession it is to live on unemployment, gloomily says that it<br />
will not make any difference at all.<br />
Then we turn to the investment allowances, I hope that<br />
the manufacturers of Australia wore paying proper attention to<br />
what he said last Tuesday, because he rejects the investment<br />
allowance. On what grounds? Because it is a hand-out his<br />
very words to the large ranufacturers whose employees<br />
apparently do not matter. This is a hand-out to the large<br />
manufacturers. An investment allowrre, a novelty in Australia </p>
<p>designed to enable manufacturers to re-equip themselves on modern<br />
lines and thereby keep down their unit costs and go into the<br />
competitive world. This is thrown out. It is just a hand-out<br />
to the large manufacturers. Ho found that our added provision<br />
for unemployment benefits, particularly for the family nan, was<br />
miserable, . although I take leave to recall to the memory of all<br />
people concerned that this is one matter about which he said<br />
exactly nothing in his policy speech. Nothing so we did not<br />
steal that from hir, but we did it, and it is miserable.<br />
He attacked the quota restrictions, or quantitative<br />
restrictions for sections of industry particularly affected in<br />
their oeployent by imports, as proofs of sectional pressure by<br />
big conpanies. References have boon made tine after time by all<br />
the people who cane to see us, and by many honourable members,<br />
to the particular problens of the timber industry or sections of<br />
the textile industry, or whatever it night be. Everybody is<br />
familiar with the short list of industries particularly<br />
affected, and when we propose to have a scheme which will enable<br />
a prompt decision to be made a holding decision which will<br />
affect these industries, this is rejected and despised by the<br />
Leader of the Opposition and the Labour Party as a mere<br />
concession to sectional pressure by big companies. I wonder how<br />
many Labour iembers in this House genuinely subscribe to that.<br />
ind then, to take the only other example that I have<br />
time to mention, he says we are leaving the motor vehicle<br />
industry to flounder and lanuish. In the course of his whole<br />
speech I was waiting for the authentic Calwell touch and this<br />
was one of the few allowing this industry to flounder and<br />
languish. Does he corplain about our decision already put into<br />
operation about sales tax on motor vehicles? I would have<br />
thought that at any rate he night have found something good to<br />
be said about a policy which he began a month ago by saying we<br />
had stolen from the Labour Party. But no; on this occasion, no<br />
" floundering and languishing". The facts, over the next few<br />
nonths, will demonstrate the absurdity of that cormiont, as I<br />
have no doubt. This astonishing reversal of form would seem to me to<br />
represent a blind and blundering Opposition guided by no<br />
principle and uninforned by any understanding of the nation's<br />
true economic problems and yet, interesting as I hope that<br />
story is, that is not the whole story. Wo must look at what is<br />
not in the c. endment. Since polling day the most vigorous and<br />
filibustering efforts of his journalistic friends of the<br />
" Sydney Morning Herald" group have been directed to attacking<br />
what they are pleaed to call the " appeasement policies" of this<br />
Government in relation to West Now Guinea and when they did this<br />
fantastic thing the honourable the Leader of the Opposition took<br />
the opportunity, as I will show, of joining in. Yet, Sir,<br />
this natter, an appeasement policy, a policy con. 1orl: ed by the<br />
Leader of the Opposition if by no other member aoit, finds no<br />
mention in the no-confidence motion. These things, which were<br />
the very Ark of the Covenant three weeks ago are now rejected.<br />
They find no place in the ni-confidence amenonent, and that is<br />
a very remarkable thing, because, let me remind the House and<br />
the people, if the election had turned out differently the Labour<br />
Party's foreign policy, as expressed by its loader, would now be<br />
operating. Now our ne. arust neighbours, Dutch New Guinea and<br />
Indonesia are there, and have been, of course, for many years<br />
at variance over territorial claims the territorial clain to<br />
the sovereignty of West Now Guinea. Je are not a party<br />
principal in that matter but we are deeply interested as a<br />
neighbour interested in the peace of this part of the world and<br />
our position has been repeatedly stated over rany years. </p>
<p>J I do not want to weary the H-ouse unduly by repetition on this<br />
matter but this policy this approach of ours has been<br />
re-stated as recently as 12th January of this year by myself<br />
after a full examination by the Government. In effect, we said<br />
let me put it quite shortly that the dispute about West New<br />
Guinea should be settled peacefully and not under threat or<br />
duress; that we have been repeatedly assured by Indonesian<br />
leaders that force would n. t be employed; that we have a right<br />
to expect the honjuring of those assurances; and that, should<br />
the Netherlands and Indonesia come to a free agreement a free<br />
agreement we would respect that agreement; that we are<br />
deeply attached to the attainment by under-developed peoples,<br />
including those of West New Guinea, after adequate and helpful<br />
preparation, of the right to choose their own future this is<br />
the policy we are pursuing in Papua and the Australian Trust<br />
Territory of new Guinea; that the policy that we apply in<br />
Papua and New Guinea is based upon our great sense of mroral<br />
responsibility for the welfare of the people to whom we stand<br />
in a special relationship; that we are not a colonial power in<br />
the old sense. We do not seek to exploit. Our aim is to create<br />
and develop the capacity of independent self-government.<br />
So far, Sir, it would be surprising to be told that the<br />
Australian Labour Party disagrees with this. If we are to be<br />
told that, let therm stand up before this debate ends and say it.<br />
To take it further: Suppose and I take it no further<br />
than to say " suppose" Indonesia made war on West New Guinea<br />
and suppose the United Nations took no action, either because of<br />
the veto in the Security Council or because the Assembly did not<br />
have the requisite majority; and suppose it was not known<br />
whether Great Britain and the United States would act<br />
militarily against armed intervention by Indonesia. What should<br />
Australia do? The answer was clear, I thought, in the statement<br />
that I made on 12th January. I said three things and I just<br />
sunmarize them. First, we will discharge our prime<br />
responsibility for the security of Australia, its Territories<br />
and its people; sec. ndly, in matters affecting West New Guinea<br />
we will act in close consultation with the great free powers,<br />
particularly Great Britain and the United States of America;<br />
thirdly, we will constantly maintain in the United Nations and<br />
with our particular friends, the basic principle that the<br />
peaceful settlement of disputes is the central theme and the<br />
supreme mission of the United Nations,<br />
Does Labour quarrel with those riews? Does anybody on<br />
the other side quarrel with those views?<br />
No-, Sir, before Igo further I want to dispose of the<br />
ludicrous and ignorant suggestion made by the " Sydney Morning<br />
Herald" on 30th January and since theafaithfully repeated by<br />
the Leader of the Opposition. It said<br />
" The truth is<br />
This is their idea of truth<br />
" that no Australian initiative over New Guinea has ever<br />
been pressed in the highest places of United States<br />
Administration".<br />
It is wonderful with what boldness people tal when they do not<br />
know, because the facts are as they could have discovered by<br />
the simplest of inquiries to confine myself to the last<br />
twelve months and as honourable members know, this unhappy<br />
business has gone on for years that scarcely a day has gone by<br />
withoutcabled exchanges on those matters between the Department<br />
of External Affairs in Canberra and the Australian Embassy in<br />
Washington for discussion with the U,, S CG oev mrLet in Washington. </p>
<p>6,<br />
Our Ambassador has had prolonged and close and specific<br />
discussions on those matters at least six times in the last<br />
twelve months with the Secretary of SlCte, Mr. Dean Risk. The<br />
present Minister for External Affairs ( Sir Garfield Barwick) has<br />
had discussions with the American Charge d'Affaires in Canberra<br />
and I, myself, not to put too fine a point upon it had long<br />
discussions on this matter with Proeident Kennedy himself and<br />
with Mr. Rusk, Yet we are told that our vies have not boon put<br />
forward. So, Sir, I come back to the Labour attitude. I had a<br />
press interview on 21st December, It was a-tor the groat day,<br />
as the boys will remember. I had that inter vi ew on 21st<br />
December, 1961, in which I re-stated our Weot New Guinea policy<br />
along the lines that I have just summarized to the 1ous On<br />
the following day this is ging back a li-title in time the<br />
Leader of the Opposition and I were both taken to task by this<br />
war-like Sydney journal. Having made the usual rather<br />
dyslogistic references to myself I hc e they will not misspell<br />
that word this journal went on to say<br />
" Mr. Calwell is just as unhelpful"<br />
Oh dear! " All he can suggest, after much preaching against sin,<br />
is that the question be settled in the U. N. If the U. N.<br />
sends a force to intervene, he says, Australia ' should<br />
provide its complement'".<br />
Then the paper goes on, after that rath.; r agreeably sensible<br />
remark and says<br />
" What if the United Nations does not send a force?<br />
This is the crucial question. He ignores it. So does<br />
Mr. Menzies",<br />
You see. If that means anything and one must not unduly<br />
attribute sense to some of those blurbs it means that if the<br />
United Nations failed to send a force to which Australia<br />
contributes Australia must provide the force by itself. If it<br />
does not mean that it is sillier than usual,<br />
On 1st January, 1962 coming up to modern times now<br />
the " Sydney Morning Herald" came back to the matter. It said<br />
" What is required from the Government at this critical<br />
time is something more. In the interests of peace, and of<br />
future relations between Australia and Indonsia, the<br />
Indonesian Government should be left in no doubt that<br />
Australia is not prepared to stand idly by if President<br />
Sookarno carries out his threats.<br />
Now, Sir, may I interrupt myself to remind the House if I do not<br />
trespass too much on the occasion that this great journal, aided<br />
by my friend opposite, had duvoted a great deal of time last<br />
year to telling me I was too , nxious to be friends with Great<br />
Britain and the United States and that I ought to be<br />
cultivating the Asian nations. Do honourable members recall<br />
that? I think they do. Now, of course, they attack me because<br />
I do not want to go to war with Asia. This is a very odd<br />
reversal of form because they know if they know anything<br />
that every mainland Asian country supports the Indonesian claim.<br />
They know that,<br />
On 4th January, 1962, the Loador of the Opposition, in<br />
order to pour oil on the troubled waters, made a violent<br />
personal attack on Presidont Soekarno, with side references to<br />
Hitler and this and that. This did not improve our relations<br />
with that country. </p>
<p>7.<br />
Later came the great conversion. Saul on the road to<br />
Damascus, if I may speak with all reverence, was not in it.<br />
This was the great conversion. Disciplined by his newrspaper<br />
backers, the Leader of the Opposition came out loud and clear.<br />
On 10th February there was a groat front-page story in the<br />
" Sydney Morning Herald", reproduced at s'ome more moder. atelength<br />
in so. m other papers, headed<br />
" Calwell Defines A. L. P. Policy on IKw Cluinea dispute"<br />
I read the statement with great interest. I woke up. I said,<br />
" Ha. This is it". I read it with surpise, W, ithout boasting,<br />
I want to say that I have had the numbor of inn oriJ.. s t<br />
calculated. There were 2,855 words in this -tat mient. ev-ery<br />
one of which was in the journal. The newspaper report<br />
commenced in this fashion on the front page.-<br />
" In a dramatic statement today the Leader of the Federal<br />
Opposition, Mr. Calwell, definod ' h ' I. abour Party's<br />
attitude to the West New Guinea crisis, He said if<br />
Indonesia seeks to deny the . rinciplos of the United<br />
Nations Charter and to uso. fi ;. ce to create a potential<br />
threat to Australia's secu-i i. y then I say with all due<br />
regard to the gravity of the situation that the threat<br />
must be faced".<br />
What did that mean? It is a fair cuestion. I wanted to know<br />
the answer. Therefore, naturally, I asked it in a public<br />
statement. I said<br />
" What does this mean?<br />
" If it means that Australia should be ready and willing<br />
to protect its own territories, ie, Australian New<br />
Guinea and Papua, the answer is that I said so in plain<br />
terms in my statement of Government policy on January<br />
12th a statement which stands,<br />
" If his statement moans that an Australian government<br />
should convoy in relevant quarters its views against<br />
aggression and in favour of self-determination the<br />
answer is that the Governnmnt has done so on very many<br />
occasionso...<br />
" If Mr. Calwell's statement moans that without any<br />
reg-rd to what might be the attitude or action of these<br />
great powers, Australia should, in the event of armed<br />
Indonesian aggression against Dutch New Guinea, declare<br />
war against Indonesia, it is clearly crazy and<br />
irresponsible".<br />
Those were fair questins,, The answer to them, of course, is a<br />
motion of no confidence in which the New Guinea issue does not<br />
even receive a mention not a word. The " ship of wa' has sunk<br />
with all hands. I should like to take the rest of my time in turning to<br />
another aspect of this matter. I have dealt with what is not in<br />
the motion, I want to say a few more words about what is in<br />
the raotion, I said quite a bit about it earlier but I am now<br />
coming back to it. I want to say something, quite briefly,<br />
about the true nature of the Government's economic policy and<br />
the reasons why changes of tactics are not to be taken as changs<br />
of strategy. Our policies havo, over a long term of years,<br />
produced notable results for Australia. Honourable members may<br />
now feel themselves rather whipped up over this matter but may<br />
I assure then that the people of Australia felt that they<br />
wore notable results because, in 1951, 1951 1955 and 1958, they </p>
<p>8,<br />
said so emphatically. I admit freely and agreeably that when<br />
they said so in 1961 they did it with what Gilbert would have<br />
called " modified rapture". I give you that,<br />
We have stood and we stand for national growth and<br />
economic stability. Our opponents appear to believe that you<br />
can have one or the other, but not both. This is a dangerous<br />
fallacy. I hope it will be understood by the people as a<br />
dangerous fallacy. It may very well be necessary, under<br />
special circumstances, to accept calculated risks for the sake<br />
of growth. We have just been dealing with some of those<br />
circumstances. But, as a continuing permanent policy,<br />
stability can never be abandoned. Stability, Sir does not mean<br />
and can never be allowed to mean, stagnation, Ntional and<br />
industrial growth require imports of people to which eloquent<br />
references were made by the honourable member for Phillip<br />
( Mr. Einfeld) and imports of producers' goods. To achieve such<br />
imports and to grow and these are both of immense importance<br />
we must export. To export either prima y products or<br />
manufactured goods we must prevent our costs from rising. The<br />
Australian Country Party and the Liberal Party are the only<br />
parties in the Federal Parliament which have shown and will<br />
continue to show an awareness of the central problem of high<br />
production costs-,<br />
Our principles apply to both sides of industry. There<br />
is no mystery about this. The maintenance of primary exports is<br />
essential to our international solvency, yet they cannot be<br />
maintained if costs rise faster than prices. The development of<br />
manufactures is essential for population growth. But<br />
manufacturing efficiency must go up and costs be kept down if<br />
manufacturing is not to be a burden upon the farmer and push his<br />
costs up.. This, in the siZplest possible terms, is the analysis<br />
that we make of these matters.<br />
Now, Sir that is why the present stability of the<br />
consumer price in ex is so valuable. It has been referred to<br />
before and I need not repeat it, but it is significant and<br />
remarkable. Our broad economic strategy is, thorefore this:<br />
To keep upward pressures on population by migration hat is,<br />
population growth; to develop the resources of Australia as<br />
speedily as possible that is, resources 6rowth; to encourage<br />
productivity and efficiency in primary and secondary industry;<br />
and to do these things in such a way as to restrain inflation,<br />
maintain our balance of trade and payments and employ our people<br />
and physical resources to the full, ' Jithin this strategy our<br />
tactics, of course, must be flexible. Our recent announcements<br />
illustrate this approach. I can do no more than take a few<br />
examples because, already I have been longer than I intando to be.<br />
Our 1960-61 policies, let us agree, bit too deeply into<br />
manufacturing and, therefore, into employrment. To correct this<br />
without re-creating inflationary boom conditions a point of<br />
the greatest possible importance means had to be devised which<br />
were temporary or non-recurring. For examplo, the non-repayable<br />
loans that we have made to the States over the last four months<br />
of this financial year amounting to have been nonrepayable<br />
and non-recurring. There they are, They achieve<br />
their object and we are all happy. They exhaust themselves and<br />
leave us to discuss the next year in a normal fashion. So the<br />
means d; vised had to be, where feasible, temporary or nonrecurring.<br />
They also had to be capable of quickly providing<br />
employment such as, for example, semi-governm-nt and local<br />
government borrowings. Nobody came before us in the course of<br />
our discussions without saying that that was one of the quickest<br />
ways of getting people to work. As y-, u know, a great deal was<br />
done on this matter at the meoting of the Australian Loan<br />
Council. </p>
<p>9.<br />
Then there we. a housing aid, particularly -where it could<br />
be put to work quickly, as we . rere assured by the States could<br />
and would be done. Then there were other means to be devised.<br />
Take the third category those likely to encourage spending at<br />
the consumer end, thus, of course, aiding both production and<br />
confidence. An example of that is the income tax rebate for<br />
1961-62. Honourable members will see how all these things are<br />
related to a specific problem not an unlimited problem but a<br />
specific and limited problem in order to get rid of some byproducts<br />
without creating new problems.<br />
Another category was calculated to aid the production<br />
and efficiency of manufacturers and, therefore, their capacity<br />
to employ people, without resorting to general import licensing,<br />
which I would think few people would want to see come back with<br />
all its arbitrary and bureaucratic characteristics. For that<br />
reason, we put forward though the Leader of the Opposition<br />
does not like it a specific proposal that a very highly<br />
respected special consultant should, after inquiry and report,<br />
recommend quota restrictions in special cases and not for an<br />
unlimited period of time.<br />
The other aspect of the same point is investment<br />
allowances. I have said something about this aspect. Does<br />
anybody in Australia with a sense of responsibility for the<br />
future suppose that we could go on with a great immigration<br />
programme, building up our population and manufacturing<br />
industries, unless we could find our place with manufactured<br />
goods in the markets of the world? How do you suppose we are<br />
going to find our place in the markets of the world if our cost<br />
level is non-competitive? How do you make the cost level<br />
competitive? You do so by taking every conceivable opportunity<br />
to facilitate the re-equipment of factories with the most<br />
modern plant; and investment allowances are specifically and<br />
powerfully designed for this purpose. On the other side of<br />
industry that is too frequently forgotten by those who are not<br />
interested in costs and I refer to the primary industries<br />
we look for measures calculatod to aid rural development and<br />
production. That is : rhy we have put forward in this categoiy<br />
of provisions the express provision for increased capital for<br />
the Development Bank.<br />
Each of these propositions and examples comes<br />
squarely within our economic strategy. There is no<br />
contradiction and there is no abandonment. J'e all seek of<br />
course, to learn from our experience unless we are fools, and<br />
to make adjustments when and where they are needed, ie should<br />
properly stand condemned if we stood flat-footed, not responsive<br />
to new circumstances or losing sight of the great objective that<br />
we keep constantly before us the full and effective use of all<br />
our resources in a growing nation. </p>
