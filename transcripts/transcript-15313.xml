<p>What has Labor got to hide about its taxation plans if it wins government?</p>
<p>Why won't Mr Rudd and Mr Swan release a personal income tax policy before the election?</p>
<p>Good taxation policy is fundamental to good economic management. </p>
<p>For the fifth Budget in a row the Government has cut income tax.</p>
<p>From the first of July next, four out of five Australian tax payers will pay no more than 30 per cent taxation on any part of their income</p>
<p>Yet Labor's Shadow Treasurer is silent on his Party's future plans.</p>
<p>Does he intend to reverse some of the Government's reforms?</p>
<p>When it comes to economic management, Labor's record has been bad in both government and in opposition.</p>
<p>In 1996 Labor left the nation with a huge budget deficit and a national debt of $96 billion.</p>
<p>Worse than that, in opposition Mr Rudd and his Labor Party colleagues recklessly opposed all of the Government's major reforms to put the Australian economy in the good shape that it is today.</p>
<p>They opposed putting the Budget into surplus.  They opposed steps to pay off our debt.  They opposed taxation reform.  They opposed freeing small business from the job destroying unfair dismissal laws.</p>
<p>They now say they are good economic managers.  Yet their behaviour has been the complete opposite.</p>
<p>Actions always speak louder than words.  It's what Labor has done - both in government and in opposition - that matters.</p>
<p>Labor cannot be trusted on economic management.  If you change the government you change economic policy and it would be a change for the worse.  </p>
