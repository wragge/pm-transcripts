Statement by the Prime Minister, the Rt. Hon. R. G. Menzies<br />
Hugh Gaitskell's death is a great blow to his<br />

skill. It is even more than that a. great loss to<br />

ablest sons. Personally, i knew him well and admired<br />
his capabilities. He added to a fine and well-furnished<br />
mind a sense of dedication to his own ideals, a true<br />
patriotism, high character and a singular personal charm.<br />
death, I am indeed sad to learn of his most untimely<br />
