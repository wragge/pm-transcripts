TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
DOORSTOP, PARLIAMENT HOUSE, CANBERRA, 11 OCTOBER 1995<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
PM: I will give you a comment about Mr Murdoch's remarks. Well the first<br />
thing I would say is at an important time in the political cycle, with an<br />
election up to half a year away, it is a good opportunity for me and the<br />
Government to confirm again simply how strong the Australian<br />
economy is. Now statistics don't tell us everything. But they are about<br />
the best measure we have and what the statistics show from the<br />
Australian Statistician not me, or my office, or the departments is<br />
that the Australian economy has now completed 16 consecutive<br />
quarters of growth. We are into our fifth consecutive year of growth<br />
and this as I have said last week in this quarter when the Statistician<br />
publishes the accounts will be our longest period of growth since the<br />
Second World War. The other thing that I think is worth saying is that<br />
this happily has been accompanied by just about the highest job<br />
growth we have had in the last 20 years: 670,000 jobs since the<br />
election, the largest fall in unemployment in a year last year, and all of<br />
this, of course, with inflation at an underlying sense running at around<br />
2 1/ 2 per cent. And that is why Australia has been at the top of the list<br />
of all of the indexes on Western countries for the last 2 1/ 2 to 3 years.<br />
The other thing that I think is worth mentioning is a word we hear a bit<br />
about productivity. Productivity has increased by 12 per cent since<br />
June 1991. This is June 1995 four years we have had productivity<br />
running you can average it out at around 3 per cent a year, which is<br />
about twice what we used to be doing, more than twice. And real<br />
wages have increased in the same period by 6 per cent. We are<br />
per cent more competitive than we were a decade ago, we have got<br />
solid profits and I notice from News Limited's newspaper account today<br />
in The Australian of the annual meeting, Mr Murdoch said that<br />
News' newspapers in Britain and Australia were thriving and for the<br />
most part dominating their markets. In Australia, where News control<br />
two thirds of the newspaper market, the papers were " doing extremely<br />
well with strong advertising results and with results a little ahead of the<br />
budget although circulation was difficult in one or two places".<br />
The other thing that I think is worth recording, not that I am here to<br />
parrot News Limited's news or good news, is that it declared a profit of </p>
<p>$ 240 million this year for news Limited in the $ 1.4 billion result of<br />
News Corporation internationally. Now all this, of course, underlines<br />
simply how strong the Australian economy has been. Now I notice that<br />
John Howard, that great supporter of our economic progress jumped<br />
right on Mr Murdoch's remarks instead of saying " well let's interpret<br />
them properly". He said " I don't want to get into the personality side of<br />
it. I deal in policy." Well you could have fooled me, John. And " it is<br />
undeniable", he said " that the Australian economy is highly<br />
vulnerable." Well it is the sort of vulnerability that most other societies<br />
would like to have, I think, that sort of growth. Here is Japan growing<br />
at 1/ 2 per cent. Here is the United States with a speed limit of<br />
2 1/ 2 per cent. And here is the Australian economy growing at<br />
between 4 and 6 per cent a year. So one doesn't get too many<br />
opportunities to say these things and have them reported.<br />
J: Are you saying he doesn't know what he's talking about?<br />
PM: No, I am saying that you need to know what the historical record is<br />
here.<br />
J: But he said it's an absolute disgrace.<br />
PM: Well by whatever measure. Four straight years of growth and now in<br />
our fifth year of growth can never be, by any measure, terrible. It has<br />
to be good and, of course, it is unambiguously good.<br />
J: But why did he say it?<br />
PM: Well I think he just drifted into Adelaide and he was basically, I think<br />
you know he is flying around the world with a big organisation and a<br />
few, I think, reactionaries were whispering in his ears some things and<br />
he has gone and blurted this out in a news conference.<br />
J: But he seems to know the youth unemployment rate in Adelaide.<br />
I mean, he might have just drifted in, but he seems to know<br />
( inaudible)<br />
PM: Well someone has told him that and told him wrongly because youth<br />
unemployment in Australia is 9 per cent and it is 9 per cent because<br />
this Government has lifted the completion rate in secondary schools to<br />
just about eight in ten young people.<br />
J: I thought it was 37 per cent?<br />
PM: No, of the cohort of children 15-19, 9 per cent only are looking for work<br />
and 9 per cent is too high. But it is not 37 per cent. The 27 per cent,<br />
not 34 per cent, is for those who are out there in the labour market.<br />
But it is our policy to keep young people, the years 16-19, as a period<br />
of vocational preparation. How many times have you heard me say<br />
that we regard age 16-19 as a period of vocational preparation?<br />
We won't let our young people fall out of the system, cascading into no<br />
training and no work and that is why we have kept them in school and, </p>
<p>of course, under Working Nation we have the Government's Youth<br />
Training Initiative. So for all young people 15-17, the Government<br />
offers a guarantee of training or employment. For the unemployed<br />
aged over 17, the Government's Job Compact means that all people<br />
who have been unemployed for 18 months or more are given a<br />
guarantee of a job. In other words, we won't let kids cascade into<br />
nothing and the only thing I can urge upon News Limited is that they<br />
join the Youth Training Initiative, team up with Bill Kelty and<br />
Lindsay Fox I am sure Bill would get the documentation to them<br />
quickly because I don't think at the moment, one young person in<br />
News Limited is in the Youth Training Initiative, or picking up any of<br />
the wage subsidies.<br />
J: Have you said that to Murdoch today, or during his present visit?<br />
PM: No, no I haven't.<br />
J: But isn't Mr Murdoch right that 8.2 per cent unemployment is nothing to<br />
be proud of?<br />
PM: But economic policy and the success of it is all about the rate of<br />
change. We had unemployment here at over 11 per cent, less than<br />
three years ago. You know that last year the fall in unemployment in<br />
Australia was the largest fall we have ever had and this is not in a<br />
country with static population growth. This is not a European economy<br />
with static population growth. We have got strong workforce growth<br />
coming from migration, coming from the school leavers, coming from a<br />
very high participation by women in the workforce. So we are always<br />
running against the tide and, even running against the tide, we have<br />
got unemployment down 3 percentage points roughly in 2 1/ 2 years<br />
and, of course, our target is to 5 per cent. And we will get to 5 per cent<br />
because of Working Nation. The sort of programs that John Howard<br />
and the Coalition don't want to have.<br />
J: Do you think Mr Murdoch has turned against you, Prime Minister?<br />
PM: No. Look, well I don't think he has turned for me. I mean I try and<br />
keep my dealings with the newspaper proprietors at arm's length and<br />
proper.<br />
J: But it is said that he backs winners.<br />
PM: Well, Laurie you know all about backing winners. You have been on a<br />
few in your day. But I will tell you one thing I would say about him.<br />
I do empathise with his view about casinos. I do empathise with his<br />
view about families because Rupert is a good family person. But there<br />
is one thing he can do I can't do. He is a major producer of feature<br />
films and he can eschew and reject violence in films. Now this is a<br />
wealthy, well-padded corporation. It can afford to be picky and choosy<br />
about scripts and about product and I would like to see him take the<br />
lead in Hollywood like others took the lead years ago, perhaps in an<br />
over reaction but years ago to knock out the violence which has been </p>
<p>deluged onto our kids and our families around the world. Now that is<br />
something he can do. I can't do it.<br />
J: Have you talked to him about that?<br />
PM: I have over time.<br />
J: What was his reaction?<br />
PM: Well I can't remember exactly. No, I mean I think he generally<br />
sympathises with that view and as you know I did speak to him about<br />
getting Australia into the feature film business because we only ever<br />
had one film that made the big time and that was Crocodile Dundee<br />
and a lot of our product has been for art house cinemas. And that was<br />
the point of getting him to commit to do three or four feature films a<br />
year in Australia, to develop the Australian Film Industry or give it<br />
access to a much broader market. Now I would like to see that not<br />
just the freshness of Australia, the uniqueness of our culture, the<br />
vitality and enthusiasm of our actors and actresses but as well, use<br />
this as an opportunity to actually make a statement about the quality of<br />
this sort of product for the world.<br />
J: Did you get a surprise with his views on Kerry Packer and<br />
Rugby League?<br />
PM: Well he had a crack at everybody I think you would have to say.<br />
The ABC got a spray, Kerry did, everybody did and I think after<br />
Mr Howard's appearance at Hayman Island, there were a lot of<br />
misgivings about J W Howard after that.<br />
J: What makes you say that?<br />
PM: Because the whole of News Corporation was buzzing that the thing<br />
was a complete flop and some Australians in that organisation said<br />
they were ashamed to be Australians when he stood up in front of an<br />
international audience and basically bombed out.<br />
J: So why did Mr Murdoch give him a leg-up yesterday?<br />
PM: Oh, I don't think he did.<br />
J: It looks that way.<br />
PM: But look here you are I mean it took us 20 years to get you out of<br />
the cultural cringe about Britain, about Europe and here you are<br />
Austral ian/ American entrepreneurs and you are back at a cultural<br />
cringe again. I mean what am I going to do with you?<br />
J: But are you saying that you don't see anything politically pointed or<br />
dangerous in these comments? </p>
<p>PM: No. No. In fact could I ever get you lot down here to tell you seriously,<br />
with feeling and meaning, and have you receive it and take It that we<br />
are having 16 consecutive quarters of growth, that we have completed<br />
our full four straight years of growth, we are now in our fifth year, we<br />
are in the longest growth cycle since the Second World War, with low<br />
inflation and huge job growth.<br />
J: What do say to Mr Howard's comments that you shouldn't have<br />
dragged the Pope into this political debate?<br />
PM: Well you see how quickly you bit on that. No, I was only talking<br />
he and Tim Fischer they are like a pair of mako sharks because I didn't<br />
bring the Pope into it. What I said was that we don't want a<br />
dog-eat-dog society. We don't want, as Robert Reich the US Labour<br />
Secretary has said, a society which has got an army of working poor,<br />
where the extremes of wealth and poverty are greater and that these<br />
sort of policies we reject and I said look there is the Pope refusing to<br />
meet the authors of these policies.<br />
J: ( inaudible) do you expect Mr Murdoch's views to be reflected in<br />
his newspapers?<br />
PM: Well why would you? I mean were they reflected when he was largely<br />
complimentary about the Government in public? I wouldn't think so.<br />
J: He says that ( inaudible) views on the economy ( inaudible).<br />
PM: I am sorry.<br />
J: He says the newspapers have been chokka with glowing reports on<br />
the economy.<br />
PM: Well the United States, where most of his business is, grows of the<br />
order of 2 to 3 per cent in the main. It is running at around 3 per cent<br />
at the moment I think and this economy is growing just about twice that<br />
fast. And that is why, I think, the profitability of News Limited has been<br />
so great.<br />
J: Mr Keating, you have got various things that you think Mr Murdoch<br />
should do. Are you going to give him a ring, or tell him personally that<br />
he should do these things?<br />
PM: No, no. It is a case of mental telepathy. I know you will do the job for<br />
me, Michelle, with great fervour.<br />
J: Is it hypocritical of him to criticise the Australian economy having not<br />
done anything in the area of traineeships?<br />
PM: No, he has views about the economy. Everyone can put their views.<br />
It is just that his get more attention. But on the traineeships, he should<br />
do more himself and he can. I mean it is a great pity that people like<br />
Lindsay Fox and Kelty have got to stump the country. And the </p>
<p>Government, Simon Crean and DEET have got to do their best to get<br />
kids into traineeships, but there are none in News Limited.<br />
J: Two areas where you have accused him of not putting his money<br />
where his mouth is youth employment, and ( inaudible)<br />
PM: No, they are your words, not mine.<br />
J: Well, what else is it if not hypocrisy if you say that ( inaudible)<br />
PM: No, I am just saying there is an opportunity there and I am just saying<br />
I empathise with him with some of these things. He says he has a<br />
hobby horse about casinos and that is fine because soaking working<br />
people and tipping their change and more than their loose change into<br />
the coffers of large industrial companies isn't, I think, a productive<br />
enterprise. I mean I have an old fashioned view about that and so<br />
does he and, of course, you know my views about film products and<br />
children. I really do believe that families are being deluged with<br />
violence.<br />
J: Well, what would it say about him if he doesn't take up the<br />
opportunities offered by the ( inaudible)<br />
PM: I have never seen him not take up an opportunity yet.<br />
J: Mr Keating do you accept though that it is not a good place for you to<br />
be in, in coming to an election, with Kerry Packer and Rupert Murdoch<br />
not thinking perhaps that you are the best person to run the country?<br />
PM: The balls are still coming in in slow motion there, pal. We are going to<br />
hit one into the Queen Elizabeth stand, one into another stand and we<br />
are just in the right place and, of course, I always like playing on a<br />
sticky wicket, you know that. Now I don't want this to be like<br />
grande bouffe, so I am leaving in a moment. I don't want to have a<br />
blow out.<br />
J: Do you find it frustrating that the polls are still not moving much, if you<br />
look at that Reuter average?<br />
PM: They have got a very good feel about them. To someone who has the<br />
touch, they have a very good feel about them.<br />
J: What feels good about them?<br />
PM: Well that is what I say. They are like hieroglyphics for journalists, but<br />
they always were.<br />
