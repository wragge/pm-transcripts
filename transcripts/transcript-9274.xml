PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P. J. KEATING, MP<br />
INTERVIEW WITH LYNDAL CURTIS, ABC MONDAY, 11 JULY 1994<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
PM: Well, I think, Mr Downer is trying to tell people that the royal family<br />
isn't our head of state or as he said yesterday, the Queen is irrelevant.<br />
I think these comments reveal Mr Downer as weak and vacillating. He<br />
wants two bob each way. He wants to say to the republicans look,<br />
don't worry, the Queen isn't our head of state and it doesn't matter and<br />
we won't need to shift to a republic. And, to the monarchists he says<br />
don't worry, we'll keep the monarchy, we'll hide it and pretend it isn't<br />
relevant.<br />
LC: But, isn't he right in saying that the Queen's role is theoretical when in<br />
reality she doesn't exercise the say in this the affairs of Australia?<br />
PM: No, he is not right. The Queen is centrally involved in our Constitution<br />
and is our head of state. She is the Queen of Australia. I am quite<br />
sure the Queen would be very surprised to find that her Opposition<br />
leader in Australia believes that while she may by the monarch, she's<br />
not the Queen of Australia and she's not relevant. I mean, what these<br />
comments reveal is that notwithstanding the gravity of the issue itself,<br />
that is, the value of the monarchy and the prospects of a change to a<br />
republic it reveals so much about how Alexander Downer would handle<br />
major issues of national management like hard decisions, like the<br />
shift outwards of Australia in the 1980s, the cuts in fiscal policy, the<br />
removal of tariffs, Mabo. I mean, what these reveal him as is, I think,<br />
first of all insincere, telling people the sun wouldn't rise, that is, the<br />
Queen isn't our head of state, weak, not wishing to offend one group or<br />
another and incapable of driving through hard decisions.<br />
LC: Isn't he right in saying that the debate about the republic is not a<br />
debate about the royal family; it is a debate about the constitution and<br />
whether change is needed to that constitution? </p>
<p>PM: It is a debate about whether the head of state of this country is an<br />
Australian person. And, the head of state of this country is not an<br />
Australian person and no wriggling around by Mr Downer is going to<br />
reveal that argument. I mean, it's unbelievable that an Opposition<br />
leader would try to defend the monarchy by saying it's irrelevant and to<br />
all intents and purposes doesn't exist. I mean, Dr Hewson looks like<br />
an absolute tower of strength compared to this fellow.<br />
LC: Why should the Liberal Party or anyone, in fact, have to come to a<br />
definitive view about the republic before they've seen what you have to<br />
offer?<br />
PM: Well, the Government is not asking them to come to a detailed view<br />
about a referendum proposal or anything of the like. It is saying that<br />
we expect people in public life to have definitive views about the key<br />
question of whether an Australian person should be head of state.<br />
Now, Mr Downer, has made it very clear. He said, at the start he made<br />
it clear, I am opposed, he said to the republic. He is in favour of the<br />
monarchy. Now, he is finding that he wants to try and curry favour<br />
within his own party and he's really saying ' oh, look, don't worry, don't<br />
worry, the monarchy is irrelevant.' And to the monarchists we can say<br />
we can just hide it and call it irrelevant. And to the republicans we can<br />
say ' well, look, the Queen really isn't our head of state at Imean, I<br />
have never seen a weaker view put in the face of an issue. If we<br />
wants to stand with some strength and say ' I am opposed to the<br />
republic and I'm in favour of the monarchy'. Fine. We understand<br />
where his values are and what he stands for.<br />
LC: Hasn't one of his central points been that he supports the current<br />
system and hasn't found a need for a change. Isn't he right to wait and<br />
see what you have to offer before he decides on whether there is a<br />
need for a change?<br />
PM: Not right. I stood up at a policy speech in a national election and said<br />
I believe that an Australian person should be the Australian head of<br />
state and we should move to a republic. That is my position. If he<br />
wants to argue he can come to a decision about that matter without<br />
detail this argument that you've got to see what all the nuts and<br />
bolts are before you decide this key question. I mean, how can any<br />
person who has risen through public life to the leadership of a major<br />
party not know whether they actually believe that the Australian head<br />
of state should or should not be an Australian person. That's got<br />
nothing to do with the Government and it's got nothing to do with the<br />
Government's proposals.<br />
LC: Doesn't it though have to do with the detail of the proposals and the<br />
detail of how the system will be changed?<br />
PM: No, because you've got to first decide whether, in fact, you believe it is<br />
inappropriate for the mMonarch of Great Britain to be the head of state </p>
<p>of this country. Now, I believe it is. I don't believe we can have the full<br />
expression of Australian sovereignty, of Australian identity, of<br />
Australian aspirations while ever our head of state is borrowed from<br />
another country. Mr Downer does, but he doesn't have the courage to<br />
come out and say so and stick with it.<br />
LC: When are you going to put forward your plan to the Australian people?<br />
Have you got a time frame?<br />
PM: Well, I said at the election campaign that I, the Labor party believes<br />
there should be as its announced policy says, a republic by the<br />
centenary of our federation 2001. I said upon winning the election, I<br />
vwould establish an expert group to write what in effect is, the first<br />
paper on the issues relating to a change which is to change our head<br />
of state and that we would publish that paper. That committee was<br />
established, the Liberals were invited to participate they declined. Mr<br />
Turnbull headed it. It is a comprehensive document. It's been<br />
published and now the Cabinet sub-committee of the Government has<br />
had two meetings on that document. In other words we are doing<br />
exactly what we said, but we can't even find an Opposition leader who<br />
stands for anything. I mean, when Dr Hewson was in office he<br />
wouldn't commit himself to a republic and I'm happy to see now, he<br />
has second thoughts and Mr Downer was going to trounce the Labor<br />
Party all the way up to the next poll on this question of the monarchy<br />
and the republic and four weeks later where is he? Trying to tell the<br />
rest of us that the Queen isn't our head of state.<br />
LC: Do you want to be around to put in place your republican plan?<br />
PM: I want to be around to see that humbugs don't prosper. The thing<br />
about Alexander Downer is he is a policy free zone and perhaps worse<br />
than that he is a principle free zone. This country simply can't afford<br />
the luxury of somebody who simply wants the big white car and the<br />
Lodge and doesn't particularly care how he gets them.<br />
LC: Prime Minister, thank you for your time.<br />
PM: Thank you.<br />
ends </p>
