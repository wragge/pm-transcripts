<p>  CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>  It is with a great deal of pleasure that I welcome the Prime Minister of</p>
<p>   Australia John Howard. Sir how are you?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Very well Jeremy. Good to be with you again.</p>
<p>  CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>  Nice to hear you. Congratulations by the way. Happy anniversary. I believe</p>
<p>   this is the day isn't it, the 25th anniversary of your election</p>
<p>   to Parliament.</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  No this is the year, I was actually earlier this year..earlier in the year</p>
<p>   in 1974. But the party's been kind enough to have a number of events and</p>
<p>   there was a very important one in Sydney last night.</p>
<p>  CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>  But that was a dinner.</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  A dinner which was also associated with the launch of the Millennium Forum</p>
<p>   of the New South Wales Division which is of course designed to clear the</p>
<p>   party's debt which arose after the last State election. It was a very enjoyable</p>
<p>   and a very successful night, and I thank the party for associating that</p>
<p>   occasion with my 25 years in Parliament, which has been an enormous privilege</p>
<p>   to represent my constituents for a quarter of a century.</p>
<p>  CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>  Indeed, indeed. I mean it's been an occasion I suppose to reflect on on</p>
<p>   maybe the most memorable moment in that 25 years. I guess there were many.</p>
<p>   But is there one that comes to mind?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Undoubtedly being elected Prime Minister in '96 was the highlight of the</p>
<p>   career. Getting chosen for the first time in a seat that I believed I was</p>
<p>   likely to win, that was also an exhilarating experience and I owe a lot</p>
<p>   to the Liberal Party for the privilege it gave me to be one of its candidates</p>
<p>   in a fairly safe seat. And I'll never forget the night that I was chosen.</p>
<p>   There have been many highlights, and however, the 2nd of March</p>
<p>   1996 was the highlight of the time that I've been in Parliament. But the</p>
<p>   last four years almost as Prime Minister have been of course years where</p>
<p>   a lot has been achieved for the benefit of the country, and one does go</p>
<p>   into public life to do good things for the community and I believe the Government</p>
<p>   that I've led over the last almost four years now has certainly strengthened</p>
<p>   Australia's economy, given it a new credibility in foreign affairs through</p>
<p>   in particular what we did in East Timor, and brought about a safer community</p>
<p>   through our national gun laws. They are some of the highlights of what's</p>
<p>   been achieved and it has been something initially made possible for me by</p>
<p>   the courtesy of the Liberal Party, but it's also been a team effort. This</p>
<p>   is a Government of a number of very talented individuals, and all of them</p>
<p>   have played a major role in bringing to Australia a measure of economic</p>
<p>   strength, international respectability and credit that I don't think we've</p>
<p>   had for something like 30 years.</p>
<p>  CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>  There would be a never ending stream of challenges and I guess the one challenge</p>
<p>   that, if I can judge by the number of people who rang this program yesterday</p>
<p>   wanting to talk about the boat people and about the refugees and that whole</p>
<p>   issue, this is a considerable challenge. I mean the calls we got yesterday,</p>
<p>   people were genuinely outraged at the thought that these people were going</p>
<p>   to be transported to Woomera, and then the taxpayer was going to have to</p>
<p>   fund air-conditioning for these renovated units. I can't..</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  That won't happen. That won't happen. Now I have every sympathy for people</p>
<p>   who feel so desperate, so afraid, and so out of alternatives they risk their</p>
<p>   lives, to travel often in almost un-seaworthy vessels, to another country.</p>
<p>   And I do try and understand the trauma. But they must understand that as</p>
<p>   far as the Government is concerned, there won't be any change on this, that</p>
<p>   we will provide basic and necessary and appropriate living circumstances</p>
<p>   while their situation is being assessed and negotiations are underway about</p>
<p>   their return. But any suggestion that they be provided with air-conditioning</p>
<p>   is quite unreasonable, and well I don't want to dwell on it, and as I understand</p>
<p>   it it's not really being seriously contemplated by anybody. It was a suggestion</p>
<p>   made and it produced a public reaction.</p>
<p>  Now as I say, I have a lot of sympathy for people who feel as desperate</p>
<p>   as these poor men and women and children must feel, but equally Australia</p>
<p>   is a very compassionate country. We take more than our fair share of refugees</p>
<p>   and we're happy to do so because we're a lucky country. And we've been very</p>
<p>   generous to a lot of people from different parts of the world this year</p>
<p>   - Kosovo, East Timor. Back in the '70s we took more Indo-Chinese per head</p>
<p>   than any country on Earth. We have a very good record when it comes to receiving</p>
<p>   refugees, and it will continue to be the case.</p>
<p>  CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>  You don't think that generosity Prime Minister might be misconstrued and</p>
<p>   perhaps manipulated?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well it is in some cases and that is why we've tightened the law. I mean</p>
<p>   one of the reasons we're getting a lot of boat people is that we've had</p>
<p>   some obstruction in the Senate over the last couple of years from the Labor</p>
<p>   Party in particular in trying to strengthen the law, and because the law</p>
<p>   hasn't been strengthened the word around the world is that Australia is</p>
<p>   an easy touch. Now we want to be seen as a fair go, fair touch country,</p>
<p>   not an easy touch country as far as refugees are concerned. We have a reputation</p>
<p>   to uphold, but we're not going to be taken for granted and we don't want</p>
<p>   the world to be around the international circles that well all you've got</p>
<p>   to do is get to Australia and then you're right, they'll never get you out.</p>
<p>  Of course the laws are such now. I'm not prepared to have that, the Government</p>
<p>   is not prepared to have that and I applaud the way in which Philip Ruddock</p>
<p>   has handled this. It's a difficult issue. He has a lot of people saying</p>
<p>   to him think only of the compassionate side of it. We've put a lot of weight</p>
<p>   on that. But there's also a national interest.</p>
<p>  There's also a question of fairness. There are tens of thousands of people</p>
<p>   who want to come to Australia who queue up, who wait, who fill out the form,</p>
<p>   abide by the rules, wait their turn. And if you have people queue jumping</p>
<p>   and then being allowed to stay, you're basically thumbing your nose at those</p>
<p>   people who played by the game. Now we're not going to allow that to happen</p>
<p>   and we want balance restored to this. We're not going to be an easy touch.</p>
<p>   We're going to be a fair touch. We're going to be fair where there are genuine</p>
<p>   refugees. But people who aren't genuine refugees that are simply queue jumping</p>
<p>   then they're not going to be allowed to stay.</p>
<p>  CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>  Prime Minister if it gets worse, have you got anything up your sleeve? I</p>
<p>   mean can you for example force sanctions against the country that is the</p>
<p>   staging point for a lot of these boat people? Is there anything like that</p>
<p>   you can do?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  International sanctions Jeremy are very hard things to make stick, particularly</p>
<p>   a country of Australia's size. I mean the only way you could ever hope to</p>
<p>   make sanctions stick would be to get collective international action by</p>
<p>   a large number of countries, and that particularly on this issue is not</p>
<p>   going to happen. Now I don't think that is an alternative. There are different</p>
<p>   ways we can strengthen the law, we can intensify our diplomatic activity.</p>
<p>   And we do have good arrangements with a lot of countries. For example the</p>
<p>   repatriation arrangement we have with China worked very well. The Chinese</p>
<p>   cooperate very effectively.</p>
<p>  One of the difficulties has been that because of strains and so forth I</p>
<p>   guess, the Indonesian authorities have not been over keen to join in stopping</p>
<p>   the flow to Australia. I'm not saying that they're encouraging it. I'm not</p>
<p>   blaming them for a moment but that is an element in it and I hope that our</p>
<p>   continued representations over time to the Indonesian Government will have</p>
<p>   an impact. But it's a difficult issue that needs to be handled in a balanced</p>
<p>   way, and we're going to do that but it's imperative that the law be strengthened.</p>
<p>   And those who've criticised the Government for strengthening the law I think</p>
<p>   are misunderstanding just how attractive to would be boat people, the perception</p>
<p>   is that Australia is an easy touch and we really do have to remove that.</p>
<p>   I want Australia to be seen as I said as a fair touch, not an easy touch.</p>
<p>  CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>  Prime Minister, the current account deficit, in years gone by if there were</p>
<p>   similar figures to yesterday, the share market would have been in a spin</p>
<p>   and the dollar would have been, there'd have been some sort of financial</p>
<p>   panic associated with it. It's been interesting, it seemed to see that yesterday</p>
<p>   there was barely a blip. Stock market and dollar reaction virtually none,</p>
<p>   which is a significant vote of confidence in the economy isn't it?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well it is. It's because all the other fundamentals are so good that people</p>
<p>   say well we'd like the current account deficit to be a bit smaller but we</p>
<p>   can handle this because inflation is low, interest rates are low, the budget</p>
<p>   is in surplus, the economy is growing strongly, and it's a broadly based</p>
<p>   growth. So we take a large current account deficit in our stride and that</p>
<p>   current account deficit yesterday is in part a product of a very strong</p>
<p>   domestic economy because when the economy is strong at home large volumes</p>
<p>   of imports are sucked in from overseas.</p>
<p>  CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>  And we look at the personal shopping that we did in I think October, and</p>
<p>   not even taking into account Christmas shopping, and most of that it appears</p>
<p>   was on the credit card. Does that worry you?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Not overly Jeremy because people have more money in their pockets now through</p>
<p>   a combination of two things. Interest rates, housing interest rates are</p>
<p>   much lower than they were. The average homebuyer in Australia is about $300</p>
<p>   a month better off than he or she was three-and-a-half years ago. Now that</p>
<p>   is a large injection of available cash into the average pocket each week.</p>
<p>   And then on top of that the real value of wages has gone up because we've</p>
<p>   had very low inflation, and nominal wage increases have run ahead of inflation</p>
<p>   rates, therefore the additional cash in the pocket is all the greater on</p>
<p>   that count. So when you add those two things together, most people have</p>
<p>   more money to spend. Not every body, and I recognise that there are people</p>
<p>   who are missing out on this and I know there are some parts of Australia</p>
<p>   that continue to suffer, and I'm very aware of that. And when the rest of</p>
<p>   the country is doing well, those who aren't making it feel it all the more</p>
<p>   acutely and I want them to understand that the Government is very sympathetic</p>
<p>   for that reality. But the generality of people, the majority of people do</p>
<p>   have more money to spend and that is reflected in the shops, and it will</p>
<p>   presumably be reflected this Christmas. I don't know what the sales are</p>
<p>   likely to be but I'd be surprised if we didn't have a very strong Christmas</p>
<p>   and I hope for the sake of particularly many of those businesses that rely</p>
<p>   very heavily, small ones, on Christmas sales I hope it is a bumper Christmas</p>
<p>   because it means a lot to them. If they miss out on Christmas then many</p>
<p>   of them have got to wait six or twelve months for another opportunity to</p>
<p>   come around and it's not easy running a small business even when the economy's</p>
<p>   doing well.</p>
<p>  CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>  There's only so much money in circulation and a story, something that I</p>
<p>   know that you feel fairly strongly about, is this gambling problem we have.</p>
<p>   Yesterday the Advertiser published a report by Relationships South</p>
<p>   Australia and the Women's and Children's Hospital, and it's devastating</p>
<p>   the effect of gambling not just, I imagine, on retailers because that money's</p>
<p>   not being spent the way it was before, but devastating on children. It says</p>
<p>   here that 15,000 children in South Australia have parents who have a problem</p>
<p>   with gambling.</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Yes, I can believe that. I think one of the more depressing social developments</p>
<p>   in this country over the last 30 years has been the easy spread of gambling</p>
<p>   encouraged in the main by governments looking for extra money. And it's</p>
<p>   happened on both sides of politics, I am not blaming Labor governments.</p>
<p>   Both sides of politics have encouraged the spread of gambling in this country</p>
<p>   and it may be seen as an old fashioned view but I think it has gone to excess</p>
<p>   and I wouldn't like to see it expand any further. And one of the things</p>
<p>   I think the Federal Government did do by having that Productivity Commission</p>
<p>   inquiry last year - the results came out this year - we were able to focus</p>
<p>   at a national level on the size of gambling and the impact it was having.</p>
<p>   And since then and, oh before that because of activities of many other people</p>
<p>   and their statements there is a greater community awareness, a greater community</p>
<p>   concern. And for the first time I can see social and political pressure</p>
<p>   being applied to governments of all persuasions at all levels to put what</p>
<p>   curbs they can on the expansion of gambling and in some cases scale it back.</p>
<p>   And that is a good thing because it is recognising that it is a social problem</p>
<p>   of a major dimension and the victims of it are, as you say, the children</p>
<p>   of addicted parents and they have nowhere to go in many cases. And it is</p>
<p>   a social problem and we ought to recognise it.</p>
<p>  CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>  Yeah. The problem is the genie is out of the bottle and there's not much</p>
<p>   you can do.</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well, it is to a very large extent but.well, you can always do something.</p>
<p>   You can always stop it getting worse and you can take opportunities through</p>
<p>   talking about it and educating people of the dangers of it, of applying</p>
<p>   pressure to casino operators and others to ensure that the problem gamblers</p>
<p>   are protected as best they can against themselves. It's never really the</p>
<p>   case that you can't do anything, it's much harder when the genie is out</p>
<p>   of the bottle.</p>
<p>  CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>  I don't know if you saw A Current Affair last night, that story on</p>
<p>   that children's charity in Victoria.</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  No, I didn't, unfortunately, I.</p>
<p>  CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>  You were otherwise engaged.</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  I was indeed.</p>
<p>  CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>  There's a voluntary code among charities but there isn't a mandatory code.</p>
<p>   In other words, somebody can say, you know, if you shop at this store, you</p>
<p>   buy this product, or you give this donation it goes to charity, or a percentage</p>
<p>   of it goes to charity. There's nothing that says you have got to be up-front</p>
<p>   and tell people how much of that dollar they are giving actually goes to</p>
<p>   the cause for which it was collected. Would that not be a good idea, a transparent.</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well, it certainly sounds.I didn't see the programme so I don't know the</p>
<p>   details.</p>
<p>  CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>  Well, $600,000 was collected for children and $600 went to the children.</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well, that sounds, that's quite unsatisfactory.</p>
<p>  CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>  It's appalling. But apparently they are not breaking any law.</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  My quick reaction, Jeremy, would be that that is a State law but I will</p>
<p>   have it investigated and if it is something that needs to be tightened at</p>
<p>   the State level well I'll encourage State governments to do so.</p>
<p>  CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>  Thank you sir. And I say that for being involved with the Variety Club for</p>
<p>   years and years.</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well, exactly and it's tremendously important. We are all the time encouraging</p>
<p>   the community to be generous and when you have examples of where generosity</p>
<p>   is, in effect, taken advantage of it makes one very angry and it does a</p>
<p>   lot of damage to the 99.9 out of 100 charities that do the right thing and</p>
<p>   do a tremendous service to the community.</p>
<p>  CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>  And, if the Variety Club can give 95 cents in every dollar to the children</p>
<p>   other charities can meet such a benchmark.</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  And my understanding, Jeremy, is that the great overwhelming, almost without</p>
<p>   exception, bulk of them do.</p>
<p>  CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>  I see the media moguls, the newspaper people are putting a bit of pressure</p>
<p>   on you and your Government with this high definition television debate.</p>
<p>   Fairly strange for them to be lobbying in this way which, sort of, is such</p>
<p>   a self-interested argument that they have. Which way do you personally feel</p>
<p>   we should go with high definition television?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well, I would like Australians to have the latest technology at an affordable</p>
<p>   price in everything - everything. Whether it's high definition television</p>
<p>   or better quality television, better quality mobile phones. My aim is that</p>
<p>   we should be an information rich society where the information is available</p>
<p>   to the whole community at an affordable price. Now, how that principle translates</p>
<p>   into given situations then becomes a matter of debate. But we'll make a</p>
<p>   decision on the merits on this issue, we won't make a decision according</p>
<p>   to the volume of noise generated by any side. People are entitled to put</p>
<p>   their point of view but we as a Government have a responsibility the public</p>
<p>   to call it in the public interest. And my principle is that I want the average</p>
<p>   Australian to have access to the best most enjoyable technology in this</p>
<p>   area at an affordable price.</p>
<p>  CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>  I take it that the Fairfax's and the Murdoch's want to go one particular</p>
<p>   way which would allow them to have a, sort of, defacto television network?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well, I am quite sure that the different media players according to what</p>
<p>   interest they now have would like to have interest in other forms of media.</p>
<p>   But at the moment we have a cross media prohibition in this country which</p>
<p>   I personally don't agree with, but there is no prospect of it being changed</p>
<p>   because there's opposition to change from the Labor Party and the Australian</p>
<p>   Democrats and from within the Government party. So I am not going to even</p>
<p>   raise the thing again. But people have different commercial interests. We</p>
<p>   took a decision in principle last year to require high definition television</p>
<p>   to be introduced along with a guarantee about no further licences for a</p>
<p>   period of time and the use of the spectrum for that television. But we also</p>
<p>   said that we would allow other participants, and that includes potentially</p>
<p>   companies like News and Fairfax and many others to bid for and acquire a</p>
<p>   spectrum for data casting.</p>
<p>  Now, there's a debate about what data casting means, whether it includes</p>
<p>   some things that look and sound and are really a bit like what's on free-to-air</p>
<p>   television and that really is part of the debate. Nobody denies that there</p>
<p>   are a whole lot of services that can be carried under the name of data casting</p>
<p>   which are not in any way resembling services on free-to-air television and</p>
<p>   there's no reason at all why companies like News and Fairfax if they bid</p>
<p>   for and obtain the spectrum can't use that spectrum for that data casting.</p>
<p>   And that will greatly enhance the services that are available to the Australian</p>
<p>   public and good on them for wanting to do that. That's not really an issue.</p>
<p>   I think the issue is about how far, what data casting really means, what</p>
<p>   it includes and doesn't include and naturally the free-to-air televisions</p>
<p>   would be concerned if it were allowed to include something that they normally</p>
<p>   carry on free-to-air television or something very much like it. And equally,</p>
<p>   the data casters would like to push the definition as far as possible so</p>
<p>   they can offer the maximum range of products.</p>
<p>  Now, we have to make a decision on that and I want to do it obviously consistently</p>
<p>   with the spirit of the decision that was taken last year because that was</p>
<p>   the decision and we've taken that and it's in legislation. I don't want</p>
<p>   to be, play favourites to anybody but we have got to make the decision and</p>
<p>   people naturally push their own interests and I just simply say to all of</p>
<p>   them we'll determine it on the merits and volumes of noise and lobbying</p>
<p>   won't influence our ultimate decision.</p>
<p>  CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>  Thank you for your valuable time, sir. Just one last question. A rumour</p>
<p>   going around this morning that the ANZ bank might be able to take over St</p>
<p>   George, are you comfortable with that?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well, I have read the papers. The law does not per se prohibit that kind</p>
<p>   of thing. The one thing the law at the moment does prevent is the acquisition</p>
<p>   or the it's called the four pillars policy, in other words, the law doesn't</p>
<p>   allow or the Government policy doesn't allow the reduction from four to</p>
<p>   a lesser number in the number of major banks. Now, that kind of combination</p>
<p>   would not of itself be in breach of that policy. It might require other</p>
<p>   hoops to be gone through but that's ultimately a matter for the boards of</p>
<p>   those organisations and for the market place.</p>
<p>  CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>  Thank you sir and let me take the opportunity to wish you and your family</p>
<p>   a very, very happy Christmas and a wonderful New Year and thank you for</p>
<p>   all the time you have given us through the year, we are very grateful.</p>
<p>r, we are very grateful.</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Thank you Jeremy and I hope you and Caroline also have a wonderful Christmas</p>
<p>   and a very happy New Year.</p>
<p>  CORDEAUX:</p>
<p>  Thank you sir.</p>
