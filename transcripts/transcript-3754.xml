PRIME MINISTER'S SPEECH AT SWEDISH TELEPHONE LINK-UP<br />
ON MONDAY, 26TH MAY, 1975<br />
I'm to open Swedish Technical Week, but that's not what is<br />
worr ying me it is this phone call which I have to take<br />
immediately I have opened the Week.<br />
I sometimes have the feeling, I suppose all of you do, that<br />
when you are making phone calls, somebody may be listening in.<br />
Well, on this occasion, I know they are,-hundreds of you.<br />
Of course, this means that the phone call will have to be<br />
exceptionally discreet and formal. I hope you will pardon<br />
me because really on the telephone, I'm quite relaxed ordinarily,<br />
quite forthcoming, quite natural. This is not the real me that<br />
you will hear on the phone.<br />
It gives me very great pleasure to open Swedish Technical Week,<br />
because there is no country in the world, whose model my<br />
Government has sought to emulate in so many respects. I suppose<br />
I must confess to being a little ideologically prejudiced.<br />
The Swedish Government is formed by a fraternal party of my own.<br />
It's been in office for over 40 years, yet Sweden is one of the<br />
most complete democracies in the world a vigorous contest<br />
between political parties and we've won for over 40 years.<br />
Of course, naturally, I want to emulate the Swedish example.<br />
But let me be completely dispassionate in this matter. Let<br />
me just look at the facts and the statistics. When the Swedish<br />
Social Democrats came to office in the early 1930' s, Sweden<br />
statistically was the poorest country in Europe. It would be<br />
invidious to mention the countries which are now regarded as<br />
the poorest in Europe, but which at that time, had a higher<br />
average per capita income than did the Swedes. Now, by any<br />
tests, Sweden has the highest per capita income in Europe.<br />
It is probably the richest country in the world. I believe the<br />
conclusion to be drawn is obvious. The society is fair, the<br />
economy has been transformed. And it has . come about, I believe,<br />
because the Swedes have concentrated on their strengths. They<br />
are naturally an educated, healthy people, a real democracy,<br />
complete freedom of parliamentary and media exchanges. At the<br />
same time, they have concentrated on those natural resources<br />
where they are strongest. They are very rich in minerals, and<br />
one only has to look not only at the income that the Swedes<br />
derive from the export of minerals, but also look at the income<br />
they derive, the employment they secure, from the processing<br />
of minerals and not least, the whole of the metal skills upon<br />
which so much of their reputation in the world is based. In<br />
every respect, the raw materials, the basic industries, the<br />
crafts and designs, the Swedes excell. </p>
<p>d f<br />
2.<br />
Inevitably, in these circumstances, they have built up a<br />
very healthy trade with Australia. So often when people<br />
visit Australia, they say the trade balance is very much<br />
in Australia's favour. I have to point out that the trade<br />
between Australia and Sweden, the trade balance, is immensely<br />
in Sweden's favour much more in Sweden's favour than the<br />
trade balance is in Australia's favour with any country in<br />
the world. But I don't resent that, I don't object to it.<br />
Minister Bengtsson has pointed out the close ties which have<br />
developed between our two countries in the last two years.<br />
I suppose you could say the last two years and five months<br />
to be precise.<br />
Nobody would say that I haven't tried to visit Sweden! It0<br />
was about six years since I made my first visit there and<br />
try as I might, I couldn't extend my mission to Europe over<br />
last Christmas and January,, to include Sweden. But I couldn't<br />
restrain my Ministers from visiting it. I think more of my<br />
Ministers have visited Sweden than have visited any other0<br />
country quite a record I can assure you. In so many<br />
international gatherings, we confer with the Swedes, whether<br />
it is in economic, or social, or diplomatic issues, we study<br />
in every case, what the Sweddes'are doing, or what they have<br />
done and they have been very good colleagues indeed. It's a<br />
delight to have Minister Bengtsson here again. We appreciate<br />
any visits from him. The Swedes have an extraordinarily fine<br />
Public Service, an extraordinarily fine diplomatic service<br />
and we have the Ambassador and a distinguished Minister here<br />
with us today. Moreover, there are a very great number of<br />
Swedish businessmen and Australian businessmen visiting<br />
Australia in this Swedish Technical Week.<br />
I don't know when the phone call is coming through, but I<br />
suppose to make it available and to take this call, to beS<br />
formal and discreet, I had better get this informal part over,<br />
and I now declare Swedish Technical Week 1975 in Melbourne,<br />
Australia, open. </p>
<p>TELEPHONE LINK-UP DISCUSSION<br />
Mr. Whitlam: The trade balance between our two countries<br />
is very much in your favour.<br />
Mr. Palme: Yes, but the important thing is that it will<br />
expand both ways, I hope.<br />
Mr. Whitlam: I'm sure it will.<br />
Mr. Palme: Really, our contacts have developed in a very<br />
capable way in all spheres during the last few years.<br />
Mr. Whitlan: They have indeed.<br />
Mr. Palme: We-are very happy for that.<br />
Mr. Whitlam: I must say that I was sorry that I couldn't<br />
extend my European visit, 5 months ago, to Sweden, but I<br />
want to express my appreciation to you and your Ministers<br />
for your hospitality to so many of my Ministers, who, whenever<br />
they're within a thousand miles of Sweden, make sure that they<br />
visit Sweden.<br />
Mr. Palme: In the first place, we are looking forward to<br />
seeing you in the future. I remember we met at a restaurant<br />
here in Stockholm.<br />
Mr. Whitlam: Yes<br />
Mr. Palme: Six or seven years ago.<br />
Mr. Whitlam: When you were the heir apparent to Erlander.<br />
Mr. Palme: I just returned from Vienna a couple of hours<br />
ago, where I met two friends of yours, Willy Brandt and H. Schmidt,<br />
and they both extend their best wishes to you. I understand<br />
that Willy Brandt has also talked to you over the phone once,<br />
to Australia.<br />
Mr. Whitlam: Yes he did, last year. But it was not so refined<br />
a technique as this where we are speaking on telephones. In<br />
that case we-were on television. We were picked up by television<br />
sets, but here, of course, we are onEricsson telephones.<br />
Mr. Palme:<br />
to year. So the technical development proceeds from year </p>
<p>Mr. Whitlam: I was happy to be able to see Willy Brandt<br />
last January in Bonn and, of course, found him in excellent<br />
spirits and we have some hope that he may be visiting Australia<br />
next year.<br />
Mr. Palme: He mentioned that. He was looking forward to it.<br />
We were discussing particularly, the present situation in the<br />
world and in Europe. Naturally the fact that the unemployment<br />
is so large, the OECD area is causing us very great concern,<br />
but we are hoping that there will come some up-turn later in<br />
the year, which would be very beneficial.<br />
Mr. Whitlam: We hope so, because all the countries at this<br />
stage of development that the OECD countries are, big ones<br />
and medium sized ones like Sweden and Australia, have these<br />
terrible twin problems of unemployment and inflation. But<br />
it looks as if the position is improving steadily, although<br />
slowly, in all our countries.<br />
Mr. Palme: I believe so. The important thing is to tie it to<br />
the development of the United States. As long as they lag<br />
behind, it will be difficult, but there is a hope that there<br />
will be a change this year.<br />
Mr. Whitlam: They seem to have changed their policies in<br />
order to relieve the unemployment.<br />
I would like to assert to you, face to face, how much my<br />
Government has appreciated working with your Government<br />
and its representatives in international bodies in the last<br />
two and a half years. We find ourselves ' on the same wavelength<br />
in so many social and economic and diplomatic issues, and<br />
whenever we are deciding a course of action we shall take<br />
as Australians in any of these bodies, we ascertain what the<br />
attitude of the Swedish Government will be.<br />
Mr. Palme: May I immediately reciprocate, because whatever<br />
the field is, whether it be the environment, or in disarmament<br />
questions or in the General Assembly or in the Security Council<br />
in the United Nations, we always have the same experience that<br />
our representatives can work very much on the same lines. And<br />
I feel that it is important that countries of our size try to<br />
both take an active part to show solidarity in all the international<br />
affairs.<br />
Mr. Whitlam: We are not so large that other countries suspect<br />
our political motives or fear our economic power. They can<br />
believe that what we are trying to do is, in fact, good<br />
international relations, fraternal relations.<br />
Mr. Palme: In my contacts around the world, I see more and<br />
more that this type of cooperation of the medium sized and<br />
smaller countries is wanted, not least in the many countries </p>
<p>of the Third World that now are finding their rightful<br />
places. Mr. Whitlam: Well, of course, Australia is surrounded by<br />
developing countries, countries of the Third World, countries<br />
which in the last generation, or in the case of Indo-China,<br />
within the last couple of months, have achieved independence,<br />
and, accordingly, we are very much aware of the needs of<br />
developing countries for trade as well as aid, and that<br />
they need to have international self-respect. We applaud<br />
the efforts that Sweden has taken under your Government and<br />
Mr. Erlander's Government in this respect in Indo-China,<br />
the attitude you expressed politically and also -the assistance<br />
that you have given with aid and rehabilitation. It's been<br />
a noble precedent and we try to emulate it.<br />
Mr. Palme: Your position is very important. Just because<br />
you are in the region where there are many countries of the<br />
Third World, where you have much more first-hand contact than<br />
many other countries have. In this international cooperation,<br />
I think what we are doing right now is important because there<br />
is in many places, a reaction against technical development<br />
and against the advances of industrial society. This can be<br />
understandable when technology leads to undesirable social<br />
results, but on the other hand, one must never forget that<br />
it is the technical development that has allowed our countries<br />
to come up from poverty and misery and to create welfare for<br />
our peoples. Therefore, we had to control technology, and<br />
also give it the possibility to develop for the benefit of all<br />
countries and for mankind, and I think it is important to stress<br />
this in the modern world..<br />
Mr. Whitlam: In our area it is true that in many of our<br />
neighbour countries, there is some revulsion against advanced<br />
technologies because they have often increased the distance<br />
between the people in office or in power, through whose hands<br />
the new techniques pass, and the rest of the population. It<br />
would be a tragic result if higher techniques increased the.<br />
disparities, the inequalities in the developing societies.<br />
Nevertheless, as I was saying to this gathering at this<br />
function in Melbourne, it is by concentrating on its strengths,<br />
that a country like Sweden in the course of just over 40 years,<br />
has come from the poorest country in Europe to the richest<br />
country in the world the smallest per capita income to the<br />
largest. You have concentrated on your strengths and it is<br />
something that we aim to copy in Australia. You have preserved<br />
democracy, you have a welfare state and you have a thriving<br />
mixed economy.<br />
Mr. Palme: I don't think you need to copy anything because<br />
really, you are following the same path with a very developed<br />
industrial economy on a mixed economy basis and the extended<br />
welfare for the people. We can thus, because we are on the<br />
same level of development, learn a lot from each other, in the<br />
social fields and the labour market field, and many others., </p>
<p>6.<br />
So we are really learning much from you and I see my colleagues<br />
are very eager to come over there and discuss with your<br />
people.<br />
Mr. Whitlam: We have Mr. Bengtsson . of course, with us today.<br />
Mr.. Palme: I hope he behaves.<br />
Mr. Whitlam: We haven't got these two-way Ericsson telephones<br />
on him the whole time, but I believe so. Both as Environment<br />
and as Labor Minister, he is a very good colleague. My<br />
colleagues in these fields have shared experiences with him<br />
to our advantage and he seems to enjoy it too.<br />
Mr. Palme: Last year we had Mr. Cameron. I had a long<br />
discussion with him. I suppose you see him often. Would<br />
you give him my regards.<br />
Mr. Whitlam: I see him constantly. He is constantly on<br />
radio talk-back programmes. If he were on a programme like<br />
this, there would be no holding him! I will tell him that<br />
you remember him and that you speak so kindly of him. Thank<br />
you very much for your reference to him.<br />
Mr. Palme: I hope that this Technical Week will be of<br />
some interest to you . and show you what we are trying to<br />
develop in this very small country. We try to specialise<br />
in certain things.<br />
Mr. Whitlam: I'm most glad that Swedish technology has<br />
brought us face to face again. I hope that it will not be<br />
too long before you, in my country, or I, in your country,<br />
can speak face to face without scores or hundreds of people<br />
watching us. It's very good for my Government to be working<br />
so closely with your Government in so many fields and I have<br />
very much appreciated the opportunity of speaking to you<br />
face to face again through the Swedish technology and the<br />
opening of Swedish Technical Week-in Australia.<br />
Mr. Palme: I really look forward to seeing you again in<br />
person in my country and I'm glad that technology gave us<br />
this chance of ' a preview of our future meeting.<br />
Mr. Whitlam: Thank you very much, Prime Minister.<br />
Mr. Palme: MTr. h aPlnmek: you, goodbye. </p>
