    <content><![CDATA[<p>PRIME MINISTER<br />EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY<br />SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER FOR<br />THE OFFICIAL OPENING OF<br />THE AIS HALLS OF RESIDENCE AND ADMINISTRATION CENTRE,<br />29 OCTOBER 1985, CANBERRA<br />LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,<br />IN A FEW MINUTES IT WILL BE MY DUTY TO DECLARE OFFICIALLY<br />OPEN THIS SPLENDID COMPLEX THE AUSTRALIAN INSTITUTE OF<br />SPORT'S HALLS OF RESIDENCE AND ADMINISTRATION CENTRE.<br />BEFORE I DO SO, HOWEVER, I SHOULD LIKE TO REFLECT WITH YOU ON<br />THE SIGNIFICANCE OF SPORT IN AUSTRALIAN LIFE AND TO SHARE<br />WITH YOU A SENSE OF PERSPECTIVE ON WHAT HAS BEEN ACHIEVED<br />HERE AT THE AIS.<br />SPORT HAS TRADITIONALLY OCCUPIED A PROMINENT PLACE IN<br />AUSTRALIAN SOCIETY AND CULTURE. AUSTRALIANS HAVE<br />TRADITIONALLY CHOSEN TO DEVOTE A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THEIR<br />LEISURE TIME TO PARTICIPATION IN, OR SUPPORT OF, SPORT AND<br />SPORTING EVENTS.<br />THIS IS THE RESULT OF THE NATURAL ADVANTAGES PROVIDED BY OUR<br />CLIMATE. IT IS A FUNCTION OF WHAT IS OFTEN REFERRED TO AS<br />THE AUSTRALIAN WAY OF LIFE. IT REFLECTS THE GENUINE PRIDE<br />THAT AUSTRALIANS HAVE TAKEN IN THE INTERNATIONAL SUCCESS OF<br />MANY OF OUR SPORTSMEN AND SPORTSWOMEN, AS WELL AS THE WAY<br />THEY HAVE CONDUCTED THEMSELVES IN THOSE ACHIEVEMENTS.<br />THE GOVERNMENT'S SUPPORT FOR SPORT OPERATES AT TWO LEVELS.<br />AT ONE LEVEL WE ARE COMMITTED TO PROMOTING AND ENCOURAGING<br />THE PURSUIT OF EXCELLENCE IN SPORT. AT ANOTHER LEVEL WE<br />CONSIDER IT IMPORTANT THAT THERE SHOULD BE WIDESPREAD<br />COMMUNITY PARTICIPATION IN SPORT. BOTH OBJECTIVES ARE<br />IMPORTANT AND ARE MUTUALLY REINFORCING.</p>
<p>2.<br />THESE OBJECTIVES UNDERPIN THE WHOLE RATIONALE FOR THE<br />INSTITUTE AND ITS ACHIEVEMENTS SINCE BEING DEVELOPED IN 1980<br />BY THE THEN MINISTER FOR SPORT, THE HON. BOB ELLICOTT.<br />THE ORIGINAL CONCEPT, HOWEVER, BEGAN WITH THE LATE FRANK<br />STEWART, WHO WAS MINISTER RESPONSIBLE FOR SPORT UNDER THE<br />FORMER LABOR GOVERNMENT.<br />I CAN THINK OF NO MORE APPROPRIATE COMMENT ON TODAY'S<br />IMPORTANT CEREMONY THAN THAT, IF FRANK STEWART WERE WITH US,<br />I KNOW HE WOULD REALISE THAT EVERYONE HAS DONE HIS CONCEPT<br />PROUD. TODAY WE FORMALLY MARK THE COMPLETION OF THE FINAL STAGE OF<br />THE CURRENT CAPITAL WORKS PROGRAM AT THE AIS.<br />WE CAN LOOK BACK WITH PRIDE ON WHAT HAS NOW BEEN BROUGHT TO<br />FRUITION FOR THE AIS.<br />THE NATIONAL ATHLETICS STADIUM, CONSTRUCTED IN 1977 FOR THE<br />PACIFIC CONFERENCE GAMES WAS THE FIRST MAJOR FACILITY<br />COMPLETED. RECENTLY, THE STADIUM WAS THE SITE OF THE HIGHLY<br />SUCCESSFUL WORLD CUP ATHLETICS, AT WHICH TWO WORLD RECORDS<br />WERE SET.<br />THE FACILITIES COMPLETED SINCE THEN INCLUDE THE INDOOR AND<br />OUTDOOR TENNIS AND NETBALL COURTS, THE INDOOR SWIMMING POOL,<br />AND THE WEIGHTLIFTING AND SOCCER HALLS.<br />THE OPENING TODAY OF THE INSTITUTE'S HALLS OF RESIDENCE AND<br />ADMINISTRATION CENTRE COMPLETES WHAT HAS BEEN A REMARKABLE<br />PROGRAM OF PROJECT DEVELOPMENT OVER A RELATIVELY FEW SHORT<br />YEARS, AND WHICH HAS RESULTED IN AN INSTITUTE NOW RECOGNISED<br />AS ONE OF THE BEST MULTI-PURPOSE SPORTS TRAINING CENTRES IN<br />THE WORLD.<br />THE RESIDENTIAL COMPLEX ITSELF CAN NOW ACCOMMODATE 320<br />INCLUDING SOME 260 FULL-TIME ATHLETES WHO WILL BE ON SITE FOR<br />MOST OF THE YEAR, GROUPS OF ATHLETES UNDER THE NATIONAL<br />TRAINING SCHEME WHO WILL BE ACCOMMODATED FOR BRIEF PERIODS<br />FROM TWO DAYS TO TWO WEEKS THROUGHOUT THE YEAR, AND OVERSEAS<br />VISITORS, COACHES AND OTHER SPECIAL GUESTS WHO VISIT THE<br />INSTITUTE FOR SHORT PERIODS THROUGHOUT THE YEAR. THIS<br />FINANCIAL YEAR SOME 55 TEAMS WILL BE ACCOMODATED.<br />AS IMPORTANT AS THIS CONSTRUCTION PROJECT IS IN ITSELF, THERE<br />IS MUCH MORE TO IT THAN BRICKS AND MORTAR.<br />THERE IS, FOR INSTANCE, THE DEDICATION AND SPIRIT OF THE AIS<br />ATHLETES AND COACHING STAFF, AND THE RESEARCH AND APPLICATION<br />OF THE SPORTS SCIENCE/ MEDICINE PERSONNEL. THIS IS ASSISTED<br />GREATLY BY THE OVERALL DEVELOPMENTAL AND CO-ORDINATING ROLE<br />OF THE BOARD OF MANAGEMENT AND THE ADMINISTRATIVE STAFF.</p>
<p>AND, OF COURSE THERE IS THE BACKING OF SPONSORS TO SUPPLEMENT<br />THE ESSENTIAL AND MAJOR ROLE WHICH I AM PROUD TO SAY THE<br />COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT HAS PLAYED IN CONCEIVING AND CREATING<br />THE AIS AND ITS FACILITIES. IN THE YEARS AHEAD WE WILL<br />CONTINUE OUR SUPPORT FOR THE SPORTSMEN AND SPORTSWOMEN OF<br />AUSTRALIA. IT WOULD BE WRONG OF ME TO OVERLOOK THE FACT THAT SINCE ITS<br />INCEPTION, AND INCLUDING FOLLOWING THE RECENT WORLD CUP<br />ATHLETICS, THERE HAS BEEN SOME CRITICISM DIRECTED AT THE AIS.<br />WE SHOULD BE CLEAR ON SOME IMPORTANT ASPECTS OF THIS ISSUE.<br />THE AIS IS INTENDED TO ASSIST IN UPGRADING PROGRESSIVELY<br />AUSTRALIA'S COMPETITIVE PERFORMANCE IN A WIDE RANGE OF<br />SPORTS. WE SHOULD NOT DELUDE OURSELVES THAT ITS<br />ESTABLISHMENT IS IN ITSELF A GUARANTEE OF INSTANT SUCCESS IN<br />WORLD COMPETITION. OTHER COUNTRIES ARE PAYING THE SAME<br />ATTENTION TO UPGRADING THEIR COACHING AND TRAINING<br />FACILITIES, AND STANDARDS IN ALL SPORTS ARE CONSTANTLY BEING<br />IMPROVED. IN THE LONGER-TERM IT IS A QUESTION NOT ONLY OF<br />HAVING AVAILABLE A FACILITY SUCH AS THE AIS, BUT OF BEING<br />ABLE TO IDENTIFY THE TALENT BEST EQUIPPED TO UTILISE ALL THAT<br />THE INSTITUTE HAS TO OFFER, AND OF THOSE YOUNG SPORTSMEN AND<br />SPORTSWOMEN BEING PREPARED TO MAKE THE TOTAL COMMITMENT WHICH<br />IS NOW ESSENTIAL FOR SUCCESS IN WORLD COMPETITION.<br />AT THE SAME TIME THE AIS CAN ALREADY BE PROUD OF THE<br />ACHIEVEMENTS OF A NUMBER OF ITS ATHLETES. THESE INCLUDE<br />ALTHOUGH THE LIST IS NOT INTENDED TO BE EXCLUSIVE MARATHON<br />RUNNER ROBERT DE CASTELLA; FEMALE SWIMMERS SUE LANDELLS,<br />MICHELLE PEARSON AND LISA CURRY; A SUBSTANTIAL NUMBER OF THE<br />MEN'S AND WOMEN'S HOCKEY TEAMS; THE MAJORITY OF THE<br />AUSTRALIAN TEAM SHORTLY TO COMPETE IN THE WORLD GYM4NASTICS<br />CHAMPIONSHIPS; AND A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF THE AUSTRALIAN<br />NETBALL TEAM.<br />THEIR SUCCESS, AND THE MANNER OF ACHIVEMENT OF THAT SUCCESS,<br />WILL BE IMPORTANT IN ENCOURAGING OTHERS TO COMMIT THEMSELVES<br />BOTH TO EXCELLENCE IN SPORT, AND TO PARTICIPATION IN SPORT AT<br />THE COMMUNITY LEVEL, IN THE YEARS AHEAD.<br />I AM SURE THAT ALL AUSTRALIANS JOIN ME IN WISHING THESE AND<br />ALL OTHER ATHLETES PRESENT AND FUTURE EVERY SUCCESS.<br />AND NOW I HAVE MUCH PLEASURE IN OFFICIALLY DECLARING OPEN THE<br />AIS HALLS OF RESIDENCE AND ADMINISTRATION CENTRE.</p>
