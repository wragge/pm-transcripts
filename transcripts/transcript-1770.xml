FOR PRESS: 8, PM. No. 14/ 1968<br />
AUSTRALIA DAY<br />
Message from the Prime Minister, Senator John Gorton<br />
This is a day of special significance for us all.<br />
It Is our day, chosen to commemorate the arrival of the First Fleet<br />
one hundred and eighty years ago when the settlement of the colony of<br />
New South WIales began. It is a reminder that we are a very young country<br />
in terms of history, but it is also a reminder that, in so short a time,<br />
we have come a very long way.<br />
WAe have every reason to be proud of our achievements.<br />
We are an independent, sovereign nation of nearly twelve million people,<br />
loyal to the Crown as a Federation of States which achieved its status by<br />
constitutional means. We have strong allies and many friends. Wie have<br />
made great strides in national development aid we have an almost limitless<br />
prospect ahead of us. Today we are caught up in historic changes of<br />
tremendous importance to us all. The challenge to populate this continent<br />
and develop Its vast resources Is Insistent. It Is everybody's task, and<br />
In pursuing our objectives of peace, security and prosperity, we cannot<br />
stand aside from the wider world.<br />
The historic events which are changing the defence<br />
and security pattern in South-East Asia, and the prolonged conflict in<br />
Viet Nam make this a testing time for us all. The road ahead will not<br />
be easy, but we are equipped to make the journey, provided we make the<br />
effort. National development In the broadest sense is the<br />
first of our priorities. This gives us the capacity we inust have to pull<br />
our weight in the community of nations. This gives us the strength we<br />
need, and the pace of our development is the measure of that strength.<br />
We must not rest on our past. We must look forward,<br />
we must be energetic and we must be adventurous.<br />
