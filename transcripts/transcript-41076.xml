    <content><![CDATA[<p>Dr Gordon de Brouwer PSM has advised me that he wishes to leave his position as Secretary of the Department of the Environment and Energy from 8 September 2017 to pursue other interests.</p>
<p>Dr de Brouwer has had an extensive and distinguished career with three decades of public service in academia and the public sector.</p>
<p>Dr de Brouwer was a G20 sherpa and supported Australia’s Prime Ministers at eight G20 summits. He was awarded a Public Service Medal and made a Knight in the Legion of Honour by the President of the French Republic for both his public and G20 service.</p>
<p>As Secretary of the Department of the Environment and Energy, Dr de Brouwer oversaw the release of the Australian Antarctic Strategy and 20 Year Action Plan as well as the Reef 2050 Long Term Sustainability Plan which was unanimously welcomed by the World Heritage Committee. Also during Dr de Brouwer’s time as Secretary, Australia signed and ratified the Paris Agreement on climate change.</p>
<p>I thank Dr de Brouwer for his advice and leadership in a number of roles and his commitment to the Australian Public Service. I wish him all the very best for the future.</p>
<p>A new Secretary will be announced in due course.</p>
