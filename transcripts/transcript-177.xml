F~ R PRESS RELEASE AT 6, P. M. SUNDAY MAY 1st<br />
" EMPLOY THE IDHANDICAPPED" WEEK MIi Y 1-MY 8.<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister, The Rt. Hon. R. G. Menzies<br />
( The Prime Minister, Mr. bienzies, who is in London to<br />
attend the Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference, sent the<br />
following message to the Nationa. l President of the Australian<br />
Junior Chambers of Commerce, Mr. Leslie M. Perrott, Jnr.).<br />
A job of work is much more than a source of income it<br />
is also a source of personal satisfaction and individual dignity,<br />
For this, among other reasons, I commend the Australian<br />
Junior Chambers of Commerce for their drive to " Employ the Handicapped."<br />
In Australia about 300,000 people are now receiving<br />
Repatriation or Social Service benefits for disabilities, and of<br />
these more than 100,000 suffer permanent disabilities.<br />
However, it does not follow that all of these people are<br />
incapable of undertaking a job of work indeed, the facts quite<br />
clearly show otherwise.<br />
Last year the Commonwealth Employment Service found jobs in<br />
commerce and indsutry for 8,700 physically handicapped people while,<br />
since 1948, the Commonwealth Rehabilitation Service has trained for<br />
employment more than 12,0 0 allegedly " hopeless invalids."<br />
There are two factors to consider when discussing employmentof<br />
the physically handicapped:<br />
First, from a colding commercial point of view, payment of<br />
benefits to this large body of people represents a substantial<br />
charge on the public purse; while the loss of their productive<br />
capacity represents a heavy drain on the nation's resources.<br />
Second, and perhaps more important, is the factor I have<br />
already mentioned: the sense of individual dignity which doing a<br />
job gives to the doer the personal satisfaction of helping one's<br />
self, rather tha-n having to rely on an impersonal repatriation or<br />
social service benefit. The pursuit of happiness lies along a<br />
self-made road, seldom along a road made by others, no matter how<br />
good their intentions.<br />
Employment of the physically handicapped is not a simple matter<br />
of Governmental legislation. It depends on the moral judgment of<br />
the community and the policies of organisations which might<br />
employ these people.<br />
However, the organlsation which employs or which, as a result<br />
of this drive decides to employ, physically handicapped people has<br />
no cause to think it is performing a mere act of charity: the<br />
record shows quite clearly that the physically handicapped worker,<br />
placed in a suitable job, is a productive, efficient, safetyconscious,<br />
and loyal employee.<br />
During " Employ the Handicapped" Week I hope the r<br />
Ch:. mbers f Commerce will reach :. ll sections : f the community<br />
with . n im. ginative pr-gramme of public informa. tion and education.<br />
In doin so, in this first national venture of its kind, the<br />
Junior Chambers will be filling a national need.<br />
My Government commends their efforts, and the existence of<br />
the Commonwealth Employment Service and the Commonwealth<br />
Rehabilitation Service will ensure that their work will be<br />
followed up.<br />
