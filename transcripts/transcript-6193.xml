    <content><![CDATA[<p>
A very clear example of economic rationality at work<br />
was the decision to index excise rates. During the past decade<br />
the proportion provided by excise to the general revenue<br />
declined from 13 per cent to 7 per cent. Through indexation<br />
we have made sure that over time they maintain<br />
their real value and are not eroded by the processes of inflation.<br />
We have put aside the destabilising and often arhitary<br />
pattern of large discretionary increases which was the<br />
way in the past. What we have done should have been done<br />
much earlier.<br />
The alternative to moving to maintain the real value of<br />
the excise, would have been to lay greater demands on<br />
other forms of taxation. The impact could have been quite<br />
distortionary. The position now reached points to the need for detailed<br />
examination of the actual and potential national revenue<br />
base. Widely based community consideration of what is appropriate<br />
in terms of economic efficiency and equity would<br />
be timely. This might enable sensible and fair changes to be<br />
mounted, not in a piecemeal fashion, but as part of a well<br />
considered, properly integrated package.<br />
In the meantime my Government is determined to press<br />
ahead with its efforts to ensure that where benefits are paid<br />
to the needy, it is in fact the needy who receive them. This is<br />
the point of the proposed pension assets test. The alarm<br />
engendered by that is unfounded.<br />
Apart from home, car, boat, caravan, jewellery, furniture<br />
and other personal effects, a single pensioner can have<br />
17 000 and still receive the full pension and up to $ 106 000<br />
and still receive a part-pension. A married couple can have<br />
$ 28 000 and still receive the full pension and up to $ 177 000<br />
and still receive part-pension. Most pensioners will not be<br />
affected at all. Some will actually gain. Only those pensioners<br />
with substantial assets, who are artificially avoiding<br />
the current income test for pensions, will be affected in any<br />
significant way.<br />
Where the Government is paying out to the elderly and<br />
others in need, the payment must be related to need. Otherwise<br />
the whole of our resources are going to be distorted<br />
and the interests of all Australians perverted.<br />
There are still too many Australians forced to live at an<br />
unacceptably low standard. Their situation must be addressed.<br />
We simply cannot afford to direct welfare payments<br />
to people who are not genuinely in need. To do so reduces<br />
the resources available to help the truly<br />
underprivileged. were elected to arrest the decline in the Australian economy,<br />
to reverse the trend towards greater inequality in Australian<br />
society and to bring Australians together again. The<br />
mandate was clear and we have made major strides towards<br />
its realisation.<br />
A greater sense of national purpose around the restoration<br />
of growth is nevertheless still needed. This will only<br />
be possible if the benefits of growth, and the inevitable<br />
costs, are shared equitably.<br />
Destruction of Korean airliner by U. S. S. R.<br />
2 September 1983 The Prime Minister, the Hon.<br />
R. J. L. Hawke, said today:<br />
The Australian Government is absolutely appalled at the<br />
barbaric act that has been perpetrated.<br />
I have been in contact with Bill Hayden and he is calling<br />
in the Soviet Ambassador today to register that attitude of<br />
my Government. I have sent a message of condolence and<br />
sympathy to President Chun of South Korea.<br />
I believe that all Australians will share the attitude of my<br />
Government in this matter. There are absolutely no circumstances<br />
whatsoever in which action of this type can be<br />
begin to be justified. Message to President of Korea<br />
2 September 1983 The Prime Minister, the Hon.<br />
R. J. L. Hawke, today sent the following message to<br />
President Chun Doo Hwan of the Republic of Korea:<br />
I wish to convey to you on behalf of the Australian Government<br />
and people our shock and concern at the loss of Korea<br />
Airlines flight 7.<br />
There are no circumstances in which the shooting down<br />
of an unarmed aircraft serving no military purpose can be<br />
justified. We are seeking an urgent explanation from the Soviet<br />
Foreign Ministry and the Soviet Ambassador to Australia.<br />
May I assure you of Australia's continued strong support<br />
for the right of the Republic of Korea to its place in the international<br />
community and its rights in international law.<br />
Launching of Business Council<br />
2 September 1983 The following is the text of a<br />
speech by the Prime Minister, the Hon. R. J. L.<br />
Hawke, at the launching of the Business Council of<br />
Australia in Sydney:<br />
This is an historic occasion in what has already proved to be<br />
an historic year in the development of the political, economic<br />
and industrial processes of our nation. And certainly<br />
in terms of moving Australia away from the cruder application<br />
of the adversary system in economic policy making,<br />
with its emphasis on confrontation, towards better consultation<br />
and co-operation, 1983 has, I believe, been a watershed<br />
year.<br />
The establishment of the Business Council of Australia is<br />
beyond doubt a landmark along the new path, the new directions<br />
Australia is taking. I am the more gratified to be<br />
able to take part in these proceedings because, as most of<br />
you will know, I have long been a firm advocate for such an<br />
organisation to give the Australian business community a<br />
stronger, clearer, more coherent and more cohesive voice in<br />
the economic and industrial life of this nation. It is, to an<br />
extent, the other side of the coin of my constant advocacy,<br />
now carried on for two decades, of a more effective and<br />
more coherent voice for the Australian trade union<br />
movement. So I like to think that I have played some part in fostering<br />
a recognition of the need for such an organisation; and<br />
thereby some part, at least indirectly, in its formation.<br />
But certainly, in this year of tremendous economic challenge<br />
facing us all, in this year of the National Economic<br />
Summit Conference, in this year of the inauguration of the<br />
Economic Planning Advisory Council, the Business Council<br />
of Australia is very much an idea whose time has come.<br />
For those of us interested in the continuity in the development<br />
of things Australian, it is appropriate that on this<br />
occasion I should recall the association of another Prime<br />
Minister-the first Labor Prime Minister of Australia, John<br />
Christian Watson-with the establishment of the business<br />
organisation later to become the Australian Industry<br />
Development Association. That was some sixty-four years<br />
ago, fifteen years after his Prime Ministership and long<br />
after his retirement from active political life.<br />
The organisation he helped to found has provided-and<br />
never more importantly than in recent years-not only a<br />
meeting point for business leaders, but also through its<br />
economic research centre and its publicafions, enhanced<br />
public appreciation of economic policy issues.<br />
AIDA is now to merge with the Business Round Table<br />
formed in 1979, to form the Business Council of Australia.<br />
It is a measure of the responsiveness and forward looking<br />
approach of both groupings in meeting the changes and challenges of th<br />

<p>challengcs of these difficult and crucial years in the economic<br />
life of our country.<br />
The Council will provide each of those organisations<br />
AIDA and the Business Round Table--with a great opportunity<br />
to build on the existing strengths of each. I note with<br />
particular interest that the Council will establish a number<br />
of small committees to seek to harness the insights and experience<br />
of leading businessmen and specialist support<br />
staff. Indeed these groups are to be aided, as necessary, with<br />
expert assistance obtained from within member companies,<br />
from the Council's own professional research establishment,<br />
and possibly from outside sources. 1 believe that this<br />
kind of exposure can only improve the quality of public debate<br />
and advocacy in Australia.<br />
The work of the Business Council in this area will I believe<br />
complement that of other business and employer organisations.<br />
In this respect I note that the Council has<br />
stated its intention to work in co-operation, rather than<br />
competition, with the Confederation of Australian Industry.<br />
I applaud that statement of intent. These two organisations<br />
together have a key role to play in the kind of partnership<br />
which my Government wishes to forge with the<br />
community. However, it is clear that the Business Council<br />
will have its own unique position and flavour as a result of<br />
the direct involvement of senior executives of Australia's<br />
major companies in its membership and its work.<br />
I look forward to an evolving and constructive relationship<br />
between my Government and business leaders, not<br />
least with the members of this Council. Gatherings such as<br />
this one today can only help in this regard, including by<br />
establishing and deepening personal contact between us.<br />
Looking around me, I have already got to know many of<br />
you personally and I hope in future to build upon that.<br />
But it is not just personal contacts and the understanding<br />
of each others' views which that brings that I see as being<br />
important. My Government has also demonstrated its desire<br />
to raise substantially both the range and quality of more<br />
formal consultation and information exchange. This is<br />
being done with a number of aims:<br />
firstly, to provide for more informed policy making<br />
secondly, to foster a consensus approach to economic<br />
policy and conduct, with particular emphasis on the need<br />
to find non-inflationary means of resolving competing income<br />
claims, and to minimise avoidable and destructive<br />
conflict thirdly, to promote a wider appreciation of our long term<br />
goals as a society, and the path by which we might best<br />
seek to achieve them.<br />
These aims-the aims not just of my Government, but, I<br />
believe, goals which are now shared by the greater part of<br />
the business community and the union movement and<br />
indeed, by the entire Australian community-were clearly<br />
endorsed by the Summit in April. But the work and spirit of<br />
the Summit must continue, if those objectives are to go anywhere<br />
near achievement.<br />
The Business Council, the establishment of which undoubtedly<br />
received added impetus from the experience of<br />
the business representatives at the Summit, will play an important<br />
part in that continuing process.<br />
The Economic Planning Advisory Council has been established<br />
to carry on the work of the Summit by providing a<br />
permanent forum for constructive dialogue between<br />
governments and all sections of the community, especially<br />
on medium to longer term economic issues.<br />
As you will be aware, two of your number have been<br />
appointed to EPAC. I refer of course to Alan Coates and<br />
Bryan Kelman. They have been appointed, after consultation<br />
with various business interests, for their general<br />
ability to contribute to the work of that body. However, their appointment also reflected their intimate knowledge<br />
of, and their prominence as members of the business<br />
conmunity. EPAC's first meeting was held on 25 July, and another<br />
will be held in a little over a month While it is early days<br />
yet, as it becomes better established I would expect EPAC<br />
to become a major source of policy advice and a key channel<br />
for community involvement. In this role, the support<br />
that the Business Council will no doubt give to Alan and<br />
Bryan, and the opportunity that it will provide for them to<br />
firm up amd inform their own views, will become of increasing<br />
importance.<br />
It remains, of course, a fundamental truth that however<br />
much the processes of consultation can be widened and<br />
strengthened-as we are determined to do-the ultimate<br />
responsibility for the key decisions of national economic<br />
policy must rest with the national Government.<br />
Last week's Budget represents the fullest but by no<br />
means the complete expression of our commitment to<br />
accept our responsibility for the economic management of<br />
this nation. The Budget is not the only arm of policy, nor<br />
can it be viewed in isolation from other actions the Government<br />
has taken in its first six months.<br />
Those actions include the Summit, with its general discussion<br />
of policy directions; the May statement, which<br />
began the process of gradual restructuring of budgetary<br />
priorities, with particular emphasis on priority areas such as<br />
housing, support for the needy and the institution of Community<br />
Employment Program; and the Premiers' Conference,<br />
with its opportunity to assist the States in fostering<br />
economic recovery. However. the Budget remains the most<br />
important single statement of the Government's aims and<br />
aspirations, and the way it will go about achieving those<br />
aims. These aims-and the Budget policies designed to achieve<br />
them-have three major strands. These are:<br />
first, to set a floor of activity in the economy while the<br />
private sector remains depressed<br />
second, to spread the burden of current sacrifice more<br />
fairly among the community, assisting those most<br />
severely affected by the current recession<br />
and third, to set in train those reforms and policies<br />
necessary to ensure that recovery, once underway, is sustained,<br />
and not choked off by higher inflation and<br />
interest rates.<br />
As the effect of the Budget and our other measures, combined<br />
with the effect of the international recovery, begin to<br />
impact upon the Australian economy as a whole, we will all<br />
need to shift the emphasis of our attention from the immediate<br />
task of achieving a recovery, to the longer term and<br />
more difficult task of ensuring that the recovery is sustainable,<br />
and that its benefits are not lost, or wasted in a<br />
new round of inflation. The success of the prices and incomes<br />
policy will be absolutely critical in that regard.<br />
Following the Summit and in our submission to the current<br />
wage case, my Government indicated support for a<br />
general wage increase in the order of 3 to 4 per cent in the<br />
second half of this year. Until the good news associated<br />
with the breaking of the drought raised food prices sharply,<br />
it seemed that an increase based on the increase in the CPI<br />
in the first half of this year might fall comfortably within<br />
this range. In the new circumstances, we judged that it was<br />
best to accept a wage increase of 4.3 per cent, to secure<br />
workers' firm commitment to pursuing wage claims only<br />
through the centralised system.<br />
If the recovery proceeds strongly in the year ahead and<br />
beyond, this wage adjustment will be seen as a good investment<br />
in future wage moderation. In the first half of next<br />
29 August to 4 September 1983 Commonwealth Record </p>
<p>year, the introduction of Medicare will take a few percentage<br />
points off the increase in the Consumer Price Index. As<br />
a result, even with full wage indexation, money wage increases<br />
in 1984 should be in line with the United States and<br />
other major economies experiencing strong growth with<br />
relatively low inflation.<br />
But I repeat, the prices and incomes policy, based on the<br />
prices and incomes accord, will be crucial in determining<br />
whether or not there will be a genuine reco'ery, and<br />
whether or not that recovery can be sustained. and whether<br />
or not its benefits can be fairly shared by the Australian<br />
workforce and all sections of the Australian community.<br />
The linchpin of the policy is the return to the centralised<br />
wage fixation system.<br />
If, in this period of incipient recovery and in the period<br />
beyond when the objective will be to strengthen and sustain<br />
the recovery, significant wage increases should be extracted<br />
outside the centralised system, then the policy would not<br />
succeed and the recovery would falter and fail.<br />
As a responsible government-not least as a Labor<br />
Government accepting a special but not exclusive responsibility<br />
for the constituency composed of the Australian<br />
workforce. the men and women in the Australian workforce<br />
as well as the legion of unemployed-we are determined<br />
to uphold the prices and incomes policy, to uphold<br />
the principles of the accord, and to ensure that the policy<br />
succeeds in its central aim of achieving a sustained and sustainable<br />
recovery.<br />
It follows from this that significant wage increases outside<br />
the centralised wage fixing system are unacceptable.<br />
That is no more than a statement of fact. of logic-a statement<br />
of the reality of recovery. And of course, it is no more<br />
than a restatement of the principles and the spirit of the<br />
Summit-adopted, I believe, in a spirit of sincerity and<br />
common sense and co-operation by all the participants a<br />
short five months ago. Lest there be any doubt, I should emphasise<br />
that the principles and the spirit of the Summit<br />
place obligations on business just as they do on Australian<br />
workers. The improvement in activity and moderation in inflation<br />
that we see in the year ahead provide a great opportunity<br />
for Australia to turn its back on the mediocrity, the stagnation<br />
that has characterised much of our economic performance<br />
in the past decade. We must grasp this opportunity.<br />
In this next year we must establish a beachhead for<br />
an assault on impediments to a great improvement in our<br />
long term growth performance.<br />
Only strong growth over a long period will enable us to<br />
destroy the scourge of unemployment. Strong growth over<br />
long periods is necessary for the improvement in living standards<br />
for all Australians. We will only achieve strong<br />
growth over long periods if we put our resources to their<br />
most productive uses. As I have said on many occasions,<br />
productive use of our resources requires acceptance of new<br />
ways of doing things, structural change in our economy,<br />
rapidly changing patterns of foreign trade, and high levels<br />
of investment from home and abroad.<br />
We believe that we are establishing a political and social<br />
framework within which strong, sustained growth can be<br />
achieved. We believe that an Australian society that is<br />
broadly united on the great national goals, that is seen by<br />
most of its citizens as a fair society, and which offers its<br />
people security of incomes and employment, will embrace<br />
the changes that are necessary for sustained growth. We are<br />
working to build that Australia. r<br />
But the right political and social framework and a more<br />
congenial short term macro-economic environment underpinned<br />
by a successful prices and incomes accord, by themselves<br />
will not be enough. Australia needs creative, dynamic business lcaderhip, directed at the r. iiing of incomes ; ind<br />
the creation of realw ealth.<br />
Is Australi: ii business leIdership good enough? We , ire<br />
pretty good at the takeover and merger, which redistribute<br />
wealth but which do not alw% a. is increase it. Are , e: igso od<br />
at using opportunities for creating new weallh, new income<br />
and new emplo. meint? These . ire questions that you should<br />
be asking yoursc. vcs.<br />
Some of you might want to respond thathe system of<br />
incentives in Australia is biased towa. rds the quick capital<br />
gain. and against investment directed at the generation of<br />
income over long periods.<br />
We accept that it is the business of business to seek<br />
profits. Within a sensible s. stein of incentives, the most productive<br />
investment is most profitable. If you believe that<br />
there are important distortions in the s\ stem of incentives,<br />
we would welcome the assistance of the business community<br />
in analysing the problem and suggesting solutions.<br />
But I hope--and I am certain from my personal knowledge<br />
of so many of you that I can expect--that we get<br />
advice that is more than special pleading. Special pleading<br />
is an inevitable part of our democracy, but it is not helpful if<br />
it is the only advic ew e t from business. What we welcome<br />
is responsible advice about reform that makes sense for the<br />
Australian economy as a whole.<br />
I can tell you now that there is no prospect ofa radical reduction<br />
in the share of government revenue in gross domestic<br />
product. That would be inconsistent with the demands<br />
of a fair and secure society on public expenditure, and with<br />
non-inflationary financing of that expenditure.<br />
But the new Labor Government will be receptive to<br />
suggestions for reform designed to improve the efficiency<br />
and equity of the Australian fiscal system. EPAC provides<br />
an ideal forum for the discussion and transmission to the<br />
Government of responsible business suggestions for reform.<br />
I welcome the formation of the Business Council of<br />
Australia for its intrinsic merits as a means of providing a<br />
more effective voice for business, and a means of enabling<br />
business to make a more effective contribution to the Australian<br />
economic debate and the quality of economic decision<br />
making in our country. But I also welcome it as an<br />
extension-a continuing expression-of the essential spirit<br />
of the Summit-a spirit based on the belief that cooperation<br />
and consultation, without in any way limiting or<br />
inhibiting the rights and freedoms of a great democracy, can<br />
achieve greater benefits for all Australians than needless<br />
confrontation or contrived conflict.<br />
