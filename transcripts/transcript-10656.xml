    <content><![CDATA[<p>E&amp;OE..........................................................................................</p>
<p>GIBSON:</p>
<p>John Howard, good morning to you.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Good morning Mike, nice to talk to you.</p>
<p>GIBSON:</p>
<p>Nice to talk to you on a foggy morning I understand in Canberra</p>
<p>   as you join us on your way to the airport.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Indeed, I am flying out of the fog into the light.</p>
<p>GIBSON:</p>
<p>Well we played ÂRoll out the Barrel' because I</p>
<p>   guess you did roll out the barrel for us yesterday and now it's</p>
<p>   the morning after the night before. How are you feeling?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I am feeling very encouraged by the response. This is a long-term</p>
<p>   plan to make the Australian economy stronger because it will make</p>
<p>   our exports cheaper. It will allow our businesses to operate more</p>
<p>   efficiently and that's got to be good for all of us. The main</p>
<p>   reason for this tax reform plan is to further strengthen the Australian</p>
<p>   economy. We've got the budget deficit fixed, we have got interest</p>
<p>   rates down, we have generated 300,000 new jobs over the last two</p>
<p>   and a half years. The next big thing to do to make the Australian</p>
<p>   economy stronger and better is to fix the tax system and that's</p>
<p>   what we believe this plan will do. </p>
<p>GIBSON:</p>
<p>Most of us know the details of your package by now but how long</p>
<p>   have you been working on it? When did John Howard first decide that</p>
<p>   he wanted to reform the Australian taxation scheme?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Oh well I have wanted change in the Australian taxation system</p>
<p>   for about 20 years but as Prime Minister I came to the decision</p>
<p>   about the middle of last year that we had to commit ourselves to</p>
<p>   a long range plan and lay it out in front of the public before the</p>
<p>   next election.</p>
<p>GIBSON:</p>
<p>Besides your own team there in Canberra of course, who were some</p>
<p>   of the other people you consulted about what you would do. Did you</p>
<p>   speak to your wife about what she....</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I certainly...</p>
<p>GIBSON:</p>
<p>....what a housewife would expect, did you speak to fellow Australians?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I did. I have done that all my political life and the message I</p>
<p>   got from middle Australia was very simple. They know the present</p>
<p>   system needs fundamental change, they want it done in an across</p>
<p>   the board but fair way and they want some personal tax cuts so that</p>
<p>   people will be reassured that the reform doesn't leave them</p>
<p>   worse off. And that really has been the driving force behind the</p>
<p>   design of this plan. People deep down know there is something wrong</p>
<p>   with the present system and they do accept that it does need to</p>
<p>   be changed but they also worry about change and they want to be</p>
<p>   reassured along the path of change that they are not going to be</p>
<p>   left worse off.</p>
<p>GIBSON:</p>
<p>What do you say to lower income workers who have already been besieging</p>
<p>   this radio station this morning with protest that compared to those</p>
<p>   in middle to high wage brackets they will be worse off?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well they are not. I mean Mike, if you are now on $20,000 a year</p>
<p>   you can see that income rise to $50,000 a year without going into</p>
<p>   a higher tax bracket. The uniform tax level, top level for people</p>
<p>   between $20,000 and $50,000 a year will only be 30 per cent. It</p>
<p>   is now a mixture of 34 per cent and 43 per cent. Those people are</p>
<p>   not worse off proportionately, particularly if they have children,</p>
<p>   they are the best-rewarded section of the community.</p>
<p>GIBSON:</p>
<p>What do you say again to those who claim that by directing assistance</p>
<p>   so heavily in the direction of single income families that you are</p>
<p>   discouraging women from remaining in the workforce, do you want</p>
<p>   Australian women back in that kitchen behind that white picket fence?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well that is ridiculous, I don't. All I am doing in that area</p>
<p>   is removing some of the tax bias against single income families.</p>
<p>   If you have a combined income of $50,000 and that is out of two</p>
<p>   incomes, you in aggregate pay less tax than one person on $50,000</p>
<p>   because you have the benefit of two tax-free thresholds. And when</p>
<p>   a mother or father gives up work when children come along they give</p>
<p>   up the whole of that second income. And all I am seeking to do is</p>
<p>   have a balance in this area because we are increasing the benefits</p>
<p>   for all families with children, not just single income families.</p>
<p>   Every child in Australia now will attract an additional tax benefit</p>
<p>   for one or another of their parents and we are also making a further</p>
<p>   adjustment in favour of single income families to remove that imbalance.</p>
<p>   But it is not at the expense of the others. I am for choice about</p>
<p>   what people do. I want to say to the parents of Australia: when</p>
<p>   you have children, it should be your choice whether mum or dad stays</p>
<p>   at home when the children are young and look after them. It should</p>
<p>   be your choice at what stage the parent at home returns to the part-time</p>
<p>   workforce and then to the full-time workforce, it should be a matter</p>
<p>   of choice. And there are thousands and thousands of parents who</p>
<p>   want greater choice in that area, they don't want the Government</p>
<p>   to tell them whether they should be a single income or a two income</p>
<p>   family. But I am not about sending people back to the kitchen or</p>
<p>   the 1950s, I am about giving the men and women in Australia in the</p>
<p>   1990s greater choice in relation to the caring arrangements for</p>
<p>   their children. And that's just a piece of propaganda designed</p>
<p>   to discredit the package, I am in favour of justice and choice.</p>
<p>   I am not in favour of stereotypes for women.</p>
<p>GIBSON:</p>
<p>I know you are racing to get that plane and I might put one more</p>
<p>   to you if I can Mr Howard. What promise can you make that the game</p>
<p>   plan won't change if we re-elect you now? Are these tax cuts</p>
<p>   and all the other goodies you are offering us today, are they in</p>
<p>   the words of your predecessor L-A-W?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well we will put them all through after the election if we get</p>
<p>   elected and we can't put it through before the election because</p>
<p>   the Opposition has said it's against it and we won't get</p>
<p>   it through the Senate. But, of course, the plan will remain. This</p>
<p>   will be the major issue in the election campaign, it won't</p>
<p>   be the only issue, but it will be the major issue and, of course,</p>
<p>   it is a very attractive plan. It has got a tax rebate for private</p>
<p>   health insurance. Anybody will be able to get back 30 per cent of</p>
<p>   the cost of their private health insurance and that is going to</p>
<p>   boost support for the health system. But it's a plan that we</p>
<p>   are committed to, we are going to deliver. We will be saying to</p>
<p>   the Australian public, whenever the election is, we would like your</p>
<p>   support in both the House of Representatives and the Senate because</p>
<p>   this is more than just a tax cut. It's more than a GST, it's</p>
<p>   more than a health insurance rebate. It's more than a reduction</p>
<p>   in the cost of diesel fuel. It is an overall plan to make Australia</p>
<p>   stronger and better and better able to withstand the impact of what</p>
<p>   is happening in Asia. And that is why it is so important to the</p>
<p>   future of our country.</p>
<p>GIBSON:</p>
<p>Well thank you for joining us this morning and I know as the fog</p>
<p>   lifts over Canberra you trust that the fog is now about to lift</p>
<p>   over the Australian taxation system after many years. Have a safe</p>
<p>   flight.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Thank you very much Mike.</p>
