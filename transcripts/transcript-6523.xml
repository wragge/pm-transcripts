    <content><![CDATA[<p>FOR MEDIA 24 October 1984<br />The Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, and the Minis! ter for Primary<br />Industry, Mr John Kerin, announced today that the Federal<br />Government is making $ 5.5 million available to assist the sugar<br />industry.<br />The assistance is to be given under Part A of the Rural Adjustment<br />Scheme. This is consistent with the Government's approach to all rural<br />industries -policies which are an investment in their long term<br />security. The Rural Adjustment Scheme Part A provides debt reconstruction<br />and capital works assistance for producers who have the capacity<br />to continue farming in the long term.<br />It is not the Government's aim t ' o provide further aid in the form<br />of carry-on finance as it is clear that the current downturn in<br />international prices and the volatility in the marketplace will<br />continue for some time. Cane growers just can't afford to take on<br />more debt.<br />Any assistance should be geared to helping canegrowers with a<br />future in the industry stay in the industry -and not just<br />increase their debt burden.<br />As the Federal Government has said on previous occasions, the<br />Review being carried out by thle industry itself will provide the<br />best basis for a long term strategy for its future.<br />Therefore the Government will meet the &amp; canegrowers immediate<br />difficulties by focussing on measures which will contribute to the<br />industry's long term prosperity.<br />in talks today between the State and Federal Governments it was<br />decided that Federal funds would be used to greatest advantage if<br />targetted to canegr rs who could continue in"' the industry but for<br />their high debt servicing commitments.</p>
<p>SJ I J *-rz-WU3<br />.7<br />' S I/ 2.<br />The package reinforced the rational and long term approach to aid<br />to the sugar industry which has been consistently adopted by the<br />Federal Government.<br />The Federal Government has already spent $ 11 million last year on<br />sugar aid and in June had raised the domestic price of sugar by<br />$ 28 to $ 508 per tonne. 3<br />S.,<br />I' S.</p>
