    <content><![CDATA[<p>I am pleased to announce that the Australian Government will fund a Medicare eligible Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) unit in north-west Tasmania. This unit will serve both the north-west and the west coast regions, effectively from Devonport to Strahan and Queenstown.  </p>
<p>This is the first of three new sites which were funded in the 2007-08 Budget to improve access to MRI services in under-serviced metropolitan and regional areas.  This Budget measure brings the number of Medicare eligible MRI units in Australia to 115 compared to only 18 in 1998.</p>
<p>MRI is a valuable tool in the diagnosis and treatment of many diseases and conditions such as cancer, stroke and heart disease.   </p>
<p>Currently, there are three Medicare funded MRI machines in Tasmania, two in Hobart and one in Launceston.  This announcement of a Medicare eligible MRI in north-west Tasmania will significantly improve access to this important medical service for the 110,000 residents living in north-west and western Tasmania.</p>
<p>The new unit is expected to provide up to 15,000 MRI scans over the next four years at a cost to government of about $1.2 million each year in Medicare benefits.</p>
<p>A service provider will be sought through a competitive tender process and it is the Government's expectation that concession card holders and children will not incur any out-of-pocket costs for MRI services provided at this unit.</p>
<p>The Government remains committed to ensuring access to MRI technology and is currently considering the location of the other two units announced in the Budget.  </p>
<p>I expect this to be announced in the near future. </p>
