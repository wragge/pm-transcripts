    <content><![CDATA[<p>FOR MEDIA9 NOVEMBER 1988<br />I consider the implementation of the, affirmative action<br />legislation as documented in the annual report of the<br />Affirmative Action agency to be an outstanding success.<br />The tremendous response in the first reporting year gives me<br />great hope that the labour market for women is changing<br />towards a fuller appreciation of the contribution women can<br />and do make to our economy.<br />Affirmative action legislation sought the co-operation of<br />employers to help achieve my Government's aim of eliminating<br />discrimination against women in the workforce.<br />The 99 per cent compliance rate shown by companies with over<br />1000 employees and higher education institutions does credit<br />to them. I congratulate them.<br />The result is of very great significance to Australian<br />women. They can increasingly look forward to more equal<br />opportunities in the workforce. it gives Australian women<br />the chance to compete for more jobs and better jobs.<br />Australia's largest employers have set a fine example for<br />their smaller counterparts to follow. They have<br />demonstrated their readiness to change and the spirit which<br />has made Australia a world leader in labour market reforms. 3339~ C) rzD)<br />Ij AU4S TRA<br />PRIME MINISTER</p>
