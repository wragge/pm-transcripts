FOR PRESS PM. No. 66/ 1971<br />
THE SPRINGBOKS' TOUR<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister, MrWilliam McMahon<br />
The Prime Minister said tonight it was desirable once<br />
again to set out clearly and precisely the Government's attitude to the tour<br />
of the Springboks in Australia.<br />
" The Government is deeply concerned", M~ r McMahon said,<br />
" that three principli cf tae greatest importance for the proper functioning<br />
of responsible government in Australia should be preserved. These<br />
principles are<br />
that the Australian people must have freedom of choice within the<br />
law at all times. Nobody has the right to deny them that freedom.<br />
( ii) that no group or organisation should be permitted to intimidate the<br />
lawful government of the country. The Government rejects<br />
absolutely any attempt by elements in the trad e union movement to<br />
achieve their objectives industrial or otherwise by force and<br />
intimidation.<br />
( iii) that politics and sport should not be tied together and that sporting<br />
organisations should not be under duress from any source for<br />
political motives. A few trade un ion leaders have no right to<br />
attempt to interrupt sporting arrangements.<br />
itI believe the great majority of Australian people shares the<br />
Government's view forcibly expressed by me that apartheid is a repugnant<br />
political and social philosophy.<br />
" Elements of the trade union movement are merely using<br />
apartheid to mislead the public about their real motive which is to impose<br />
their views on the Government an~ d the Australian people by force and<br />
intimidation. " I believe Australians value the principles I have<br />
stated and I also believe they wili jealously guard their world -wide reputation<br />
as sportsmen. " I hope the Springboks' tour will continue to be treated<br />
for what it is an international sporting event which interests a tremendous<br />
number of people.<br />
