    <content><![CDATA[<p>68/ 164<br />CANBERRA COLLEGE OF ADVANCED EDUCATION<br />UNVEILING OF FOUNDATION STONE<br />CANBERRA, A. C. T. 28 OCTOBER 1968<br />Speech by the Prime Minister, Mr. John Gorton<br />Mr; Chairman, Mr. Minister,-Leader of the Opposition, Distinguished<br />Guests, Ladies and Gentlemen:<br />I am delighted to be asked to unveil the plaque and I have<br />no doubt that in due time I'll be told precisely what string to pull in order<br />to do it. This is one of the most satisfying tasks that I could<br />imagine myself undertaking, because the unveiling of this plaque is an<br />indication that we are really moving in building the first Canberra<br />College of Advanced Education and that College represents a significant<br />new approach to tertiary education.<br />If I may say so, the occasion is of special significance to<br />me, and satisfaction to me, because I remember not so long ago carrying<br />out a function which was called turning the first sod on the site. This:<br />involved, not as you might imagine using a spade, but using some vast<br />mechanical contraption which took a sod weighing some four cubic yar ds,<br />if I remember rightly, and which at all times I felt was liable to get<br />completely out of control. But I remember that well and if I may say so,<br />Sir, the flies were just as bad on that occasion as they are today.<br />I don't claim any proprietary rights in this college. It<br />falls within the jurisdiction of my colleague the Minister for Education<br />and Science, and all the hard work and planning has been done by the<br />Interim Council of the college under your leadership. But it is a symbol.<br />It's the beginning of new things in the A. C. T. and the beginning of new<br />things throughout the whole of the nation.<br />It is worth restating, I think, on this occasion what it is<br />that we are starting here. We're starting an institution, one of many,;<br />which has flowed from the acceptance of those reports to which you<br />referred, Mr. Chairman. Those reports suggested that we should<br />tailor our tertiary education system to meet the demands of an exciting,<br />changing age and to meet the requirements of the tide of the future which<br />has caught us up and which is going to require of us new schools and new<br />approaches to education. I think most of us here would be familiar with the reports<br />of the various committees the Mextin Committee, the Wark Committee<br />and the Burton Committee and we will know some of the special functions<br />which these colleges have to carry out. But let us be fair about one thing<br />right from the start, * and let us make it clear right from the start, to all<br />those interested in education throughout Australia. These colleges will<br />not be second level universities. / 2</p>
<p>-2<br />Collectively they will provide an alternative system but<br />not an inferior system to university education. I will repeat that an<br />alternative system but not an inferior system to university education.<br />Each college of the many that will grow or have grown throughout the<br />nation will have its own standards, quality and its own levels of efficiency.<br />Each will be a tertiary institution with a strong vocational bias, as you<br />said, offering courses leading to professional excellence in selected<br />disciplines. And the colleges will aim to provide scholarship, not only<br />for the sake of scholarship, which was the genesis of university education,<br />but to meet specific needs of industry and of human endeavour in specific<br />specialised areas. This is where the college courses will differ from the<br />courses at our universities not all the courses of our universities but<br />very many of them. The first building here is, as you said, to be a multi-purpose<br />building and if all goes well, the students will be here at the beginning of<br />1970. 1 was glad, Sir, that you mentioned that the request of the Interim<br />Council of the college that it be allowed to plan for the inclusion of teacher<br />education has been accepted, at least in principle. When firm proposals,<br />which I think have not yet been made, are received, they will be studied<br />by us with great care and interest, and I hope and believe with the same<br />results as have led to the plans for the college itself.<br />At any rate, a school of teacher education within the<br />Canberra College will add to the pool of trained teachers within Australia,<br />for use within Australia or the Territories, and indeed provide teachers<br />for local schools. Liberal Studies is one of the first courses which this<br />college will offer. And I want to stress this, because a deliberate<br />infusion of the liberal arts into a system which is essentially vocational<br />and which many people seem to think will be extremely technical, is of<br />first importance. This infusion is designed to ensure that human values are<br />not lost in a world of machines or the classics abandoned for calculuS<br />and computers. I don't see at all why humanists and technologists have<br />to be different people or take different approaches to the problems of<br />their lives or of the nation. What we aim to produce here, of course,<br />is a new " end product" a liberally-educated technologist, or, if I may<br />put it another way, without upsetting my distinguished colleague, a<br />technologically-educated liberal.<br />I believe, Sir, we must develop these colleges in a way<br />which will give us plenty of flexibility; adapt the system to the changes<br />now bearing down upon us changes in environment, in social attitudes,<br />in the application of science and technology changes which have a<br />greater intensity about them now than we have experienced at any past<br />time in the history of this country.<br />If we are to reach for the stars, then we must reach for<br />them with trained minds and skilled hands. / 3</p>
<p>3-<br />One more thing, Sir, I would say. This college now is<br />being built in open country, yet within measurable time, within a short<br />time, there will be around it the new town of Belconnen. And I hope that<br />this college will stand in that town as one example of an Australian<br />Government's active interest and continuing interest in education. This<br />college is being built to meet a demand in the Capital Territory, but<br />that demand is reflected across the whole of this continent.<br />No doubt, the college will develop its own tzaditions as<br />the years go by. You can't merely vest tradition in new things. You<br />can't confer tradition like a diploma or a degree, or whatever it is you<br />decide to confer. You have to let it grow from the quality of its courses<br />and the capacity of its staff and students.<br />But I am certain that if the beginnings of this college are<br />built upon in the future with the same devotion, with the same skill, as<br />has been used in the past, that the tradition this college will develop will<br />be second to none of any tertiary institution in Australia.<br />Sir, here, and again in colleges like it throughout Australia,<br />we are going to see people being educated not merely for the 20th but for<br />the 21st century, which we are rapidly approaching. And I believe that<br />what may happen in that 21st century will largely be shaped by the products<br />of these colleges, of universities acting jointly to provide that which this<br />nation needs a liberal education, scholarship for its own sake, a searching<br />mind, a capacity to understand new things, a capacity to apply technology<br />and an insistence that technology so applied be applied for the good of all<br />and not for destructioh, So this is an important occasion; this is for ' me a satisfying<br />occasion and for all those who have given their work and their minds and<br />their time, I trust that it too is a highly satisfactory occasion.</p>
