TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER THE HON P J KKATING MP,<br />
ADDRESS TO ST VINCENT DEk PAl L, TOWNSVILLE, 15 NOVEMUR1R 1992<br />
E &amp; OF. PROOF COPY<br />
We support~ yv lqntar agenies in program with funny names. One we caM SAAP,.<br />
Supportive Assistance Acormonudazn Program, and that program is rccurent expenditure<br />
which we provide to voluntary agencies for overnight and other acixommodation and care.<br />
We havo another thing cAlled C AP, the Capital Ashistance Programn, which builds the<br />
accomnmodation which provides for those people. We have the general relief program<br />
where, if people need a 1it of money for the gps bill or the light bill or food or whatever it<br />
might be, we supply some money as wel.<br />
We're not the dominant supplier but were becoming more significant in wupport for the<br />
voluntary agencies. In the One Nation prograrn announced earlier this year, I put some<br />
exctra money in for the voluntary agencies this year because of the problem the recesson<br />
has brought.<br />
But the thing that will always mnatter the most when dealing with the underprivileged or the<br />
weak or the poor or the sick, will bc in' this sort of society public provision. That'Is why we<br />
must keep a stron~ g social secu5itv~ y" e. We should reject those, as the American<br />
electorate have just reJocted those, who have argued the line that if we support the poor it<br />
drags the rest of us down.<br />
1 might say to you that some of my opponents are arguing that if you put a hand out to<br />
pull the poor up behind you it instead pullsthe rest ofus back. I don't beevetgut Ithink<br />
a community we'-v got to go along together. Sure, some win earn mome in this<br />
communityand somewll am lows, bvthe gapshouldn't beso greatas tosee an<br />
underclass actually oewur, where it actually grates away from the main comnmunity.<br />
The public systemn has got a role to play in providing a good, secure safety net for people.<br />
And that's why I was very pleasantly supportive when I found myself able to tick off the<br />
sentencs in the statements of the Catholic Cornmission for Social Justice and Peace in<br />
recent months, saying thcac very fffings. Ilat co mmunity value is the value that we have to<br />
play to, and not the value of the individual. Private initiative and private reward have their<br />
place, but it shouldn't be the dominant culture of Australia. It has to be a community and a<br />
broad culture.<br />
