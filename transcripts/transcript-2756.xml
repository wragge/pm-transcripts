PRE33 STATEMENT NO. 24<br />
18 December 1972<br />
REPRESENTATION AT I. L. O.<br />
Australia would strengthen its labour representation in<br />
Europe and its relations with the International Labour<br />
Organisation and with other organisations concerned with manpower<br />
and social affairs in Europe, by appointing in Europe a Special<br />
Labour Adviser with the personal rank of Ambassador, to handle<br />
all labour questions, the Prime M1inister and Minister for Foreign<br />
Affairs, Mr. 1hitlam, announced today.<br />
This representative would be Dr. P. H. Cook, at present<br />
Secretary of the Department of Labour and National Service.<br />
He has had great experience in the work of the I. L. O. and has<br />
participated on many occasions as Australia's representative at<br />
I. L. O. Conferences. Dr. Cook -would be attached for administrative purposes<br />
to the Australian Mission to the United Nations in Geneva but<br />
would have wide-ranging responsibilities covering the whole of<br />
Europe. As well as carrying out representation and continuing<br />
relations with the major organs of the I. L. O. and its Office,<br />
Dr. Cook would assist the Australian Ambassador to the Organisation<br />
for Economic Co-operation and Development as Australia's principal<br />
representative for manpower and social affatrs questions with<br />
the Organisation. The of which Australia became a<br />
member in June 1971, has an important Manpower and Social Affairs<br />
Directorate within its secretariat and conducts meetings of<br />
Government representatives through its Manpower. and Social Affairs<br />
Committee, as * well as through seminars and other specialist<br />
meetings of experts from Vestern. European and North American<br />
countries and Japan. For a number of years, O. E. C. D. has urged<br />
Mdember governments to adopt ani active manpower policy, particularly<br />
through measures to facilitate and stimulate mutually beneficial<br />
adaptation between the labour force and the needs of a rapidly<br />
changing economy. o.&amp;/ 2 </p>
<p>-2-<br />
Dlr. Cook would generally keep in touch with manpowe r<br />
developments in Western Europe, especially those which may<br />
be of direct interest to the Australian situation. He would,<br />
inter alia, maintain regular contact with such organisations,<br />
as the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions.<br />
PM1r. Vhitlam emphasised the importance he attached to<br />
Australia's active participation in I. L. 0. and to ratification<br />
of I. L. 0. Conventions. He said that Australia had, at one*<br />
time, led . the world with some of the most progressive labour<br />
legislation but, during the last twenty years, had fallen<br />
far behind many of the countries in Western Euirope. It was<br />
now time to catch up. In many instances conditions of work,<br />
social security, retirement benefits and many otherthings<br />
vital both to the individual worker and to the economy as<br />
a whole were now much more favourable to workers in European<br />
countries than in Australia. V e must learn in depth and in<br />
detail just what European countries had managed to achieve<br />
while we had been standing still. The appointment in Europe<br />
of a senior representative with a great background of<br />
experience and expertise in labour matters would go a long<br />
way to help remedy the lack of progress in Australia in recent<br />
years. CCAANNBBEERRRRAA.. AA.. CC.. TT.. </p>
