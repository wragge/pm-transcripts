EM4BARGOED AGAINST DELIVERYf76/ 6<br />
FOR PRESS MARCH 1, 1976<br />
TEXT OF ADDRESS BY THE PRIME MINISTER AT THE VICTORIAN CkMPAIGN<br />
OPENINGThe<br />
election in Victoria will decide how far a new era in<br />
Australian life can be realised.<br />
At the Federal level, we have a Government whose major commitments<br />
are freedom, opportunity and concern. We have a commitment to<br />
giving Australians the opportunity to achieve their goals in life<br />
and a commitment to assisting the disadvantaged and asserting for<br />
Government a new role.<br />
But the Federal Government is only one of Australia's Gov ernments.<br />
State Governments have a vital part to play if Australians are to<br />
have the maximum scope to develop their abilities.<br />
There is only one party in Vic* toria. that can offer a Government<br />
of ideal~ ism and responsibility required to make Australia an example<br />
to the world.<br />
Only the Liberal Party can offer that kind of Government.<br />
The Liberal Party of Australia places supreme value on the<br />
individual -on the right of people to seek their own goals in<br />
life, in their own way.<br />
The purpose of Government is to provide the conditions in which<br />
all people can achieve lives of dignity and self-respect.<br />
The philosophy of the Liberal Party is the only philosophy which<br />
can provide realistic : responsible Government and progressive,<br />
enlightened reform.<br />
The Liberal Party in Victoria has a record of great achievement<br />
in securing a decent life for all people.<br />
The Victorian Liberal Government is one of the most successful<br />
Governments in Australia, with a record all Liberals can be<br />
proud of--a record of twenty years sound and progressive<br />
Government first under Sir Henry Bolte, and then under Dick Hamer. 2<br />

A victory for the Liberal Party in the election is crucial to<br />
all Victorians.<br />
There must be no repetition of the disastrous unemployment<br />
and inflation created by the irresponsible policies of the<br />
Australian Labor Party.<br />
All Australians want to ensure that that does not happen again.<br />
But we cannot be content simply with establishing prosperity<br />
again. * We must move forward in a progressive and enlightened<br />
direction.-a direction which will enable people to control their<br />
own lives.<br />
We believe that power must be shared between the Commonwealth,<br />
and the States. Between State Government and Local Government,<br />
and within the broader community.<br />
Labor will always fail because it believes that all Government<br />
' Power should be centralised in a few men, that Government should<br />
have ever greater control over the lives of everyone in every<br />
part of Australia.<br />
Labor tried to destroy the States and centralise control over<br />
Local Government.<br />
The Labor Party tried to destroy the Senate the very instrument<br />
the Constitution established to protect the States.<br />
In the Labor Party's view, all wisdom resided in a few men in<br />
Canberra. The pe ople who are suffering the results of that view are the<br />
thousands of school leavers still trying to find jobs; the<br />
retired people whose savings have been eaten away by inflation; the<br />
poor and the disadvantaged whom inflation affects worst of all;<br />
and young families who suddenly found that the price of a home<br />
was beyond their reach.<br />
While all this was happening, the Labor Party in Victoria said<br />
not a word. They did not protest at what was happening to<br />
Australia. How far with Federal Labor is M4r Holding prepared to go?<br />
-Did he approve of the Labor Party's attempts to evade the<br />
constitution in the Loan's Affair?<br />
What is his attitude to the latest episode in the sordid story<br />
of the Labor Party and Arab money?<br />
The people of Victoria have a right to know just how far Mr Holding<br />
is prepared to go with Mr Whitlam.<br />
Does he agree with Mr Whitlam's stated belief, that the duty<br />
of state Labor Parties is to make themselves unnecessary? ./ 3 </p>
<p>7-_ -3-<br />
How can any self-respecting Z-tate Party Leader take this attitude<br />
and expect the voters to believe that he will work for their<br />
interest? The left wing of the Labor Party has been too influential for<br />
too long and thousands of Australians are suffering as a result.<br />
The Poverty Inquiry reported that the poor and the disadvantaged<br />
were actually wose off as a result of the inflation caused by<br />
Labor. The Victorian Labor Party under Mr Holding was prepared to surrender<br />
the future of the people in Victoria to the irresponsibility of<br />
the Labor Party in Canberra.<br />
The people who spoke out were Dick Hamer and the Victorian<br />
Liberal Party.<br />
And they were not content just to proteot they did something<br />
' about it.<br />
Togezther with people in the Liberal Party around Australia, the<br />
Liberal Party in Victoria worked to develop a programme for the<br />
most fundamental reform of Australia's Federal system since<br />
Federation. The Liberal Party's Federalism Policy will be the strongest<br />
guarantee that irresponsible attempts to centralise all power in<br />
the hands of a few men will never happen again.<br />
When the Federalism Policy is implemented, the States and<br />
Local Government will have a guaranteed source of income.<br />
Participation by people in local and state government will be<br />
more effective. More important, decisions especially affecting<br />
local communities and the states will again be made where they<br />
should be made by the Government closest to the people affected.<br />
That is one major reason why a victory for the Liberal Party is so<br />
important Victorians will know that the Government they elect will<br />
whole-heartedly work to bring about cooperaticn and responsibility<br />
in the Government of Australia.<br />
Centralisationof power by a genuine concern that people should<br />
be able to parti cipate-e ffectively in the decisions of Government<br />
which affect them.<br />
Just as the State Government needed a Party with a Liberal<br />
philosophy in Canberra, the Federal Government needs ' a<br />
Party with a Liberal philosophy in Victoria.<br />
Then in partnership with the Australian people we can build a<br />
new Australia.<br />
It is now my pleasure to introduce the Premier of Victoria -a<br />
man of humanity, a man of integrity a man of who Victorians and<br />
the Liberal Party are rightly proud the man who has led one of<br />
the most successful State Governments in Australia Dick Hamer. </p>
