CHECK AGAINSTD LFl. TVFR EMBARGOED UNTIL DELITVFRY<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
ADDRESS TO THE COMMITTEE FOR ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT OF<br />
AUSTRALIA<br />
BRISBANE 15 MARCH 1991<br />
Ladies and gentlemen<br />
Three days ago I delivered to Parliament a major Statement<br />
about the economic challenges facing this nation.<br />
I spoke with three principal purposes:<br />
First, in the immediate circumstances of the recession, I<br />
saw it as my responsibility, as Prime Minister, to offer the<br />
Australian people assurance and explanation: assurance that<br />
our policies are bringing the recession to an end; and<br />
explanation of how the transitory pain will yield<br />
identifiable and enduring gain for the future.<br />
Second, I wanted to announce a package of substantial new<br />
measures directed to the fundamental task facing the nation.<br />
The tariff cuts, the reduced wholesale sales taxes for<br />
business, the business savings achieved through simpler<br />
depreciation, the retraining assistance, the new support for<br />
apprentices and the further initiatives in education and<br />
research all these new measures I announced share one<br />
overriding obj ective.<br />
That objective I expressed in the title of my Statement:<br />
Building a Ccompetitive Australia.<br />
As such, these new measures continue and intensify the<br />
reforms my Government has carried out in the past eight<br />
years. They show once more our determination and capacity to take<br />
tough decisions in the interests of the nation with a<br />
steady commitment to our principles and values, and a steady<br />
refusal to return to the old attitudes designed to set<br />
Australian aclainst Australian.<br />
The third purpose of my Statement was to reaffirm for the<br />
Australian pe-ople the longer term economic goals to which we<br />
aspire and to identify for all Australians their role in<br />
achieving those goals. </p>
<p>Because it is vital in this process to understand that all<br />
of us workers, employers and Government have essential,<br />
and complementary, roles to play.<br />
In the final analysis, the challenges ahead demand the<br />
involvement of all Australians.<br />
In content, the Statement presents new challenges for<br />
Australian industry as it enters the final stages of the<br />
winding down of protectionism particularly the TCF and car<br />
industries.<br />
One of the most pleasing aspects of the Statement is the way<br />
in which, despite those tough implications, the message of<br />
competitiveness is getting through.<br />
There have been few tears shed for Australia's protectionist<br />
past. Instead, there has been a general sense of preparedness for<br />
the challenge ahead.<br />
Broadly, Australians accept the message that protectionism<br />
has made Australia a poorer nation than it would otherwise<br />
have been; that tariffs have forced up the prices that<br />
consumers and businesses have to pay for essential goods and<br />
services; and that insulation from the challenges of the<br />
world marketplace is no way to build world-competitive<br />
industry, or to acquire the world's best technology, or to<br />
adopt international best standards in our places of work.<br />
To date, the main focus of reaction to the tariff cuts has<br />
been on their implications for the import-competing sector.<br />
Today, I want to shift the focus to include Australia's<br />
exporters, and to discuss how they are advantaged by these<br />
and other changes in the 12 March Statement.<br />
Let me start by presenting you I hope, not burdening you,<br />
with some figures about Australia export performance.<br />
Australia's mining sector has consistently been a strong<br />
export performer for many years. But an interesting story<br />
is told by the export figures for our agricultural and<br />
manufacturing sectors.<br />
In the second half of the 1970s, the volume of agricultural<br />
exports grew by nearly 9% a year. But since then<br />
agricultural exports have marked time. Despite consistent<br />
large productivity gains, our farmers exported the same<br />
volume of goods in 1989-90 as they did ten years earlier.<br />
over the same periods, our manufacturing exports grew<br />
consistently and, indeed, exponentially by 1.4% a year in<br />
the second half of the 1970s, by 4.5% a year in the first<br />
half of the 1980s and by nearly 13% a year in the second<br />
half of the 1980s. </p>
<p>What explains this extraordinary divergence between<br />
agriculture, our traditional strong suit, and manufacturing?<br />
First, it is not due to complacency or lack of efficiency by<br />
our farmers. They have been and remain among the most<br />
efficient in the world.<br />
The problem lies elsewhere: in the increasing corruption,<br />
over these years, of world agricultural trade largely by<br />
the European Community and to a lesser extent by the United<br />
States and Japan.<br />
The combined farm subsidies of these three economies have<br />
recently averaged more than $ 300 billion a year. And this<br />
for a sector which produces only about 3% of their GDP.<br />
I have had the pleasure of addressing CEDA audiences on this<br />
issue before, and so I know you agree with me in recognising<br />
the importance of the Uruguay Round trade negotiations in<br />
rectifying these distortions.<br />
A successful outcome to the Uruguay Round by which I mean,<br />
an agreement by the Europeans to substantial cuts in their<br />
farm protection is essential for the continued health of<br />
the world trading system and, therefore, the world economy.<br />
It will ensure that efficient farmers, like our own, are<br />
rewarded, not penalised, in the world marketplace.<br />
While GATT has been completely ineffectual so far in<br />
breaking down trade distortions in agriculture, it has been<br />
very successful in substantially reducing manufacturing<br />
protection. Over the last forty years, tariffs on manufactured goods<br />
have declined consistently and the volume of world trade<br />
in manufacturing has dramatically grown.<br />
So these international factors explain part of the divergent<br />
export performance of our farms and our factories.<br />
There are critically important domestic factors at work too.<br />
Just as agricultural production is now corrupted by the<br />
pernicious subsidies that cosset the farms of Europe, so,<br />
within Australia, manufacturing production was distorted by<br />
the tariff walls that grew up around this country in the<br />
1950s and 1960s.<br />
It was to remedy those distortions, and the complacent<br />
attitudes to which they gave rise, that this Government set<br />
about with determination to dismantle the tariff walls and<br />
to expose Australian industry to the challenges of the<br />
world. The results have been dramatic. </p>
<p>Manufacturers no longer have to tolerate the extra costs<br />
imposed on their production process by the burden of<br />
tariffs.<br />
Contrary to the expressed fears of the pro-tariff lobby<br />
groups, the Australian manufacturing sector now employs<br />
more, produces more, and exports more than it did before<br />
and in each case, the rate of growth has been faster here<br />
over the past five years than the average of the OECD<br />
countries. If I may burden you with a few more figures, let me provide<br />
a measure of those increases.<br />
Using 1985 as a base measure of 100, manufacturing<br />
employment in the OECD economies rose, from 1985 to 1989, to<br />
101. In Australia, using the same base, manufacturing employment<br />
rose to 109.<br />
In manufacturing production, Australia increased to 121,<br />
just ahead of the OECD, at 120.<br />
In manufacturing exports, the OECD went from 100 to 131;<br />
Australian manufacturing exports went to 179.<br />
So the lesson is surely this.<br />
Against a background of falling tariffs world-wide and in<br />
Australia, Australian manufacturers are becoming more<br />
competitive. We are becoming more successful in winning<br />
world markets.<br />
This is one important reason why my Government took the<br />
decision to cut tariffs further.<br />
Taking into account these latest cuts, my Government will,<br />
by the end of this decade, have slashed assistance to the<br />
manufacturing sector by more than three-quarters the<br />
nominal rate will fall from 13 per cent to 3 per cent, and<br />
the effective rate from 22 per cent to 5 per cent.<br />
And because we are increasingly practising what we are<br />
preaching, this decision will add further credibility to our<br />
international campaign to win lower agricultural subsidies.<br />
We can argue with greater force that our trading partners<br />
should abandon their own counter-productive distortions of<br />
international trade<br />
No matter how much our trading partners might flout<br />
international trading rules, lower Australian tariffs mean<br />
reduced input costs for our own businesses and thus a better<br />
Australian export performance.<br />
So ultimately, lower tariffs advance our own self-interest. </p>
<p>To give one example, the food processing industry an<br />
industry in which we have an obvious competitive advantage<br />
to add value will become more competitive as a result of<br />
our decision to cut substantially the tariff on sugar.<br />
A further example is the duty reductions on minerals<br />
processing equipment not made in Australia, which will<br />
reduce the cost of that equipment to the minerals processing<br />
industry thereby enhancing its competitiveness.<br />
In the same way, the taxation changes I announced simpler<br />
depreciation and lower wholesale sales taxes will also<br />
lower business input costs.<br />
This is not the place to make extended partisan comment, but<br />
it is absolutely relevant to note that in the more than four<br />
decades since 1949, it has only been conservative<br />
Governments that have built tariff walls and enlarged them<br />
and it has only been Labor Governments that have dismantled<br />
them. Ladies and gentlemen,<br />
Australia's relatively high inflation for much of the past<br />
two decades has been a major factor undermining the<br />
competitiveness of our exporters and potential exporters<br />
High inflation has brought higher interest rates and a<br />
higher cost of capital. It is no coincidence that the most<br />
successful countries in the post-war era Japan and Germany<br />
are noted for their low inflation<br />
Australia now stands on the verge of a breakthrough to low<br />
inflation. Inflation is currently running at lower<br />
than the OECD average of and will fall substantially<br />
over the course of this year.<br />
We have the opportunity to put Australia on a low inflation<br />
path. The combined effects of the tariff cuts and taxation changes<br />
will help us bring inflation, and hence interest rates,<br />
down. In his response yesterday to my Statement, the Opposition<br />
Leader threw down what he called two challenges. We do not<br />
know much in detail about the Opposition's prescriptions for<br />
building a competitive Australia, but we do know, with<br />
complete certainty, that these two challenges would spell<br />
disaster for Australia.<br />
He proposes the twin, and related, follies of a wages freefor-<br />
all and a consumption tax.<br />
The primary effect of a consumption tax would be to boost<br />
inflation. </p>
<p>To the extent that a consumption tax would have any<br />
offsetting advantages in terms of reduced indirect taxes on<br />
business inputs, our decision to widen exemptions for<br />
wholesale sales tax has substantially met that need.<br />
At the same time, our route is not just non-inflationary, it<br />
is positively deflationary that is, it delivers second<br />
round benefits in terms of lower inflation and a lower cost<br />
of capital.<br />
By contrast, the consumption tax would cut taxes on business<br />
inputs but raise the cost of capital through higher interest<br />
rates at the same time, with the possibility that business<br />
would be worse of f.<br />
This possibility is made a probability by the Opposition's<br />
proposal simultaneously to deregulate the labour market.<br />
That could only make inflation very much more difficult to<br />
control and for evidence we need look no further than the<br />
experience of the United Kingdom over recent years, where<br />
poor discipline over wages in a deregulated labour market<br />
boosted wages growth and inflation into double figures.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen,<br />
I am sure you are familiar with the report which I<br />
commissioned from Professor Ross Garnaut, Australla and the<br />
Northeast Asia Ascendancy. That report highlighted the<br />
enormous opportunities that await a more competitive<br />
Australia through closer trading links with the north east<br />
Asian economies the best performers in the dynamic Asia-<br />
Pacific region.<br />
Over the last four decades, the Asia-Pacific region has<br />
experienced one of the most remarkable periods of sustained<br />
economic growth in human history.<br />
And the major factor underpinning that growth has been the<br />
region's openness in trade.<br />
In January 1989, I launched the initiative for the creation<br />
of a new forum for Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation. APEC<br />
has become a valuable means for regional economies to<br />
achieve closer policy harmonisation.<br />
It has also become a significant voice in the global debate<br />
about the Uruguay Round. An APEC ministerial-level meeting<br />
last July issued a strong declaration in favour of a<br />
substantial and timely outcome to the Uruguay Round.<br />
Australia has already taken many steps along the road to<br />
closer enm~ eshment with these economies, and our tariff cuts<br />
will take us further. </p>
<p>My Statement also announced that Austrade's activities would<br />
be refocussed towards Asian markets. In addition, we will<br />
create a new program of fellowships so that Australian<br />
business men and women and recent graduates can get direct<br />
working experience in the Asia Pacific region.<br />
Let me quote the concluding paragraphs of Professor<br />
Garnaut's article in The Aue of Wednesday last.<br />
" We have watched the emergence of internationallyoriented<br />
industrialisation in many countries in east<br />
Asia over the past two decades. Looking at that<br />
experience, the success that has been emerging recently<br />
in Australia, the favourable development in the macroeconomic:<br />
environment, and the commitments in this<br />
Statement, the transformation [ of the Australian<br />
economy towards export-oriented manufacturing] is<br />
likely to proceed at a pace that surprises most<br />
Australians. " It wil,. take most of this decade in the best of<br />
circumstances. We could yet make big mistakes,<br />
including omission of efficiency raising reforms. But<br />
the odds; now favour the emergence of an internationally<br />
oriented, productive Australian economy within a short<br />
enough time for most of us to enjoy it."<br />
I can only adid: my Government is determined to ensure that<br />
this increasingly short-priced favourite romps home.<br />
In saying that, I want specifically to acknowledge the<br />
qualification Professor Garnaut inserted in his prediction:<br />
the mistake of omitting efficiency raising reforms.<br />
None of you wrill have missed the fact that much of the<br />
commentary since my Statement has centred on the pace of<br />
micro-economic reform within Australia.<br />
Let me tackle that issue head on.<br />
This Governmetnt has an unshakeable commitment to a continued<br />
rapid pace of' micro-reform.<br />
We reject the! notion of an explicit " nexus" between cutting<br />
tariffs and reforming the micro-economy. The tariff cuts I<br />
announced were entirely appropriate and should not have been<br />
delayed by any suggestion about the pace of micro-reform.<br />
At the same time, micro-reform is already proceeding at a<br />
rapid pace, according to schedules that have been set and<br />
stringently applied. </p>
<p>As I said on Wednesday at the National Press Club, we put<br />
micro-economic reform on the political agenda of this<br />
country and we have stayed ahead of the game ever since. We<br />
were the first to identify the bottlenecks and start to<br />
clear them. We have won the cooperation of those involved in<br />
making the reforms work, and we have set tight timetables to<br />
achieve them.<br />
As a result, we have seen more reform in the last eight<br />
years than had been seen in the previous eighty.<br />
And in 1991 alone we are pursuing an agenda of reform<br />
covering the waterfront, shipping, telecommunications,<br />
domestic aviation, rail freight, roads, business regulation,<br />
pro-competitive legislation, and workplace reform all<br />
without significant industrial disruption or a wages freefor-<br />
all.<br />
With all this reform underway, it would have been foolish to<br />
have held back from further tariff reductions.<br />
However, this needs to be clearly understood.<br />
We do recognise that the new round of tariff cuts will<br />
continue to expose Australian business to international<br />
pressures, when they come into effect from 1992-93.<br />
I can assure business that as this takes place, we will<br />
continue to do our part to meet that challenge through<br />
continued micro-reform.<br />
The current reform targets will be met, on time, and we will<br />
initiate further reforms, further timetables, to ensure that<br />
we meet the challenges of an Australia emerged from behind<br />
the tariff walls.<br />
Our commitment will continue into and beyond 1992-93,<br />
parallel to our commitment to continue reducing tariffs.<br />
It is true that 1991 sets a high-water mark for<br />
micro-reform.<br />
We can expect that high water mark will be matched and<br />
surpassed in the future.<br />
This is entirely consistent with the sentiment underlying<br />
the 12 March Statement, in which I said, " We need the habit<br />
of adaptation because the lessons of international<br />
competitiveness must be constantly learned and re-learned."<br />
Ladies and gentlemen,<br />
I said at the outset that the challenges facing Australia<br />
were challenges for all Australians.<br />
Of course, government has the responsibility to lead by<br />
setting the right framework. And we will do that. </p>
<p>But the framework alone will not be enough.<br />
The decision to lower tariffs will not, by itself, lead to a<br />
stronger export performance. The opportunities it presents<br />
will not automatically be taken up.<br />
What will be required is a preparedness by individual<br />
Australians managers, investors, employees, consumers to<br />
take up those challenges.<br />
As I have said, we are not only about achieving reform of<br />
long-standin institutions of our economic landscape but<br />
just as importantly and perhaps much harder the deep<br />
seated attitudes that have accompanied them and given them<br />
meaning. May I conclude by saying most sincerely to you that in<br />
talking to the members of CEDA I could not be talking to an<br />
organisation more attuned to the realities of which I speak<br />
or more committed to ensuring that it will play its part in<br />
meeting these great challenges and realising the vast<br />
potential of this nation. </p>
