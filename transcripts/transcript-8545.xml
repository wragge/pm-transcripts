TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING, MP<br />
INTERVIEW WITH GERALDINE DOOGUE, ABC RADIO, 16 JUNE 1992<br />
E OE PROOF COPY<br />
GD: Goad morning and welcome to ' Life Matters'. This<br />
morning my special guest is ith-ePii-ea-RKister, Mr<br />
Keating, a man about whom many people apparently<br />
have fixed opinions. He's hardly cut a bland image<br />
over the years he's been having a relationship with<br />
the Australian public. And if opinion polls are any<br />
guide Mr Keating does still have an image Problem in<br />
that he continues to record high disapproval ratings<br />
and his transition from Treasurer to Prime Minister<br />
doesn't appear to have significantly altered<br />
people's perceptions. Mind you, 30 per cent of<br />
people polled in The Australian newspaper's Newspoll<br />
that was just published this morning said they were<br />
undecided between Mr Keating and Dr John Hewson, and<br />
that was the highest ever recording. Though the<br />
state of the parties put Labor a full ten points<br />
behind, just pretty well stable. Now these polls<br />
are an effort, of course, and effort only to guess<br />
the public mood at any one time so they are not<br />
definitive, but several of them do show he has a<br />
particular problem with female voters. Last month<br />
he brought out veteran feminist and bureaucrat Anne<br />
Sumr from the United States to help him turn that<br />
around. There would be a very definite view of<br />
course, for any man who presides over an<br />
unemployment rate of 10.6 has a real problem with<br />
voters not one of perception. But Mr Keating must<br />
persuade people that whatever they think of him, the<br />
alternative is worse. And the dilemma for him is<br />
how to go on the attack to present that-issue as<br />
well as present a subtly different image to the<br />
sorts of voters, many of them women but not all of<br />
them, or are a little less fascinated by the game of<br />
politics and moved more by impressions of people's<br />
biases and predilections.<br />
So with all that in mind, I spoke to Mr Keating<br />
yesterday afternoon when he was visiting Melbourne<br />
to speak to the Institute of Directors. So Mr<br />
Keating, welcome to ' Life Matters'. </p>
<p>PM: Thank you Gerry, it is lovely to be here.<br />
GD: What do you think of the way President Bush and Dan<br />
Quale used the word family in their campaigning<br />
strategies? They talk about a return to family<br />
values and they talk about the break down, the moral<br />
order, do you think that appeals to the Australian<br />
voter?<br />
PM: No, because I think the notion of famil is<br />
different now to what it was. There are all sorts<br />
of families and public policy has got to comprehend<br />
that. We sought to do that in the 1980s, to support<br />
all kinds of families. A couple of years ago John<br />
Howard had a set of ads where he had the cottage and<br />
the white picket fence and that'Is the sort of 1950s<br />
view of the Australian family. Well, John is a<br />
person, he would want to take us back there, but<br />
life has moved on. I don't like double speak in<br />
politics. I think if any government wants to claim<br />
an interest in families the policies have got to fit<br />
the bill. That is, don't tell us what you think,<br />
tell us what you're going to do.<br />
GD: But you say John Howard is a man of the past, but in<br />
many ways you and he share the fact that your<br />
families are part of the 23 per cent who live in<br />
that traditional style ' Chat used to operate when the<br />
white picket fence was more the norm, in that you've<br />
got the man going out to work, the woman staying at<br />
home and the kids at home. So you are not that<br />
different in that sense at all.<br />
PM: Except that I don't want to squeeze every other<br />
family into the model. That is I except the view<br />
that we're looking at a family structure which is<br />
greatly different to that.<br />
GD: Do you regret that?<br />
PM: Not at all. That's why I think that government<br />
policy should be basically supporting families<br />
regardless of their character.<br />
GD: I mean I notice that you often describe us as a<br />
nation in transition, but usually you refer to the<br />
public face of Australia and its financial<br />
community, its trade and so on, there is very little<br />
reference to its private face. What do you think<br />
about the changes that hove occurred between women<br />
and men in households, and between parents and their<br />
children? Do you like the general thrust or do you<br />
have real reservations?<br />
PM: I like the thrust. Can I say from the 1980s, the<br />
vast employment growth we had in the 1980s most of<br />
it went to women. I regard that as an unambiguously </p>
<p>good thing that women were given a choice could do<br />
things, had more fulfilling lives I don't lament<br />
that at all. I think that's part of the social<br />
change which we are seeing and should see. That is,<br />
that women are not squeezed into a particular mould.<br />
GD: But a lot of people say that, it rolls of the<br />
tongue, it's the thing to say these days, but you<br />
haven't had as a man to go through the transition in<br />
your own household of having two people working.<br />
PM: No, but the difference is though that I went through<br />
the policy consequences of it, I didn't resist it<br />
like John Howard did. For instance, I was the<br />
Treasurer that provided for a five-fold growth in<br />
child care places, I was the Treasurer that had to<br />
fund and help design the Family Allowance<br />
Supplement. Whatever my own experience wias I took<br />
the view that there are other sorts of families and<br />
that the women in those families want to do other<br />
things and I've sought to have public policy<br />
accommodate that change.<br />
GD: Why then are you perceived as having a problem with<br />
women?<br />
PM: I don't think I do. Can I just say, in the<br />
portfolio I had as Treasurer in the 1980s, I had<br />
many things to do with women's policy, but it was<br />
invariably under another portfolio heading and so<br />
these things were always announced by their<br />
Ministers. But some of the things I was involved<br />
with were, for instance, the child support agency.<br />
Now we could never have established one of those<br />
without using the Australian Taxation Office. There<br />
was no agency of the Commonwealth that could<br />
actually go and set that system up and make it<br />
operate. I made that thing operate. Superannuation<br />
before we moved into superannuation policy women<br />
just couldn't get preservation of superannuation.<br />
They'd hop into the workforce at 17, maybe disappear<br />
in their middle twenties to have a family, come back<br />
in, and have no preserved benefits for them. I<br />
introduced all those in legislation the<br />
supplementary payments for low paid workers, mostly<br />
women, shop assistants, process workers, again<br />
women. Bill Kelty and I worked that into Accords Mark V and<br />
VI. These are things which haven't sort of hit the<br />
light of day. I notice Carmel Niland said the other<br />
day in a piece in the Sydney Morning Herald that I'm<br />
just discovering social equity for women. Well the<br />
truth is Carmel hasn't yet discovered me. I've been<br />
through these issues before properly Carmen was<br />
beating a drum about them. That is, the Child<br />
Support Agency, supplementary payments,<br />
superannuation, massive increase in funding for </p>
<p>childcare, the Family Allowance Supplement and all<br />
the other things like how I supported Susan Ryan in<br />
discrimination policies, positive discrimination in<br />
favour of women. Yet these were all sort of Cabinet<br />
room things I did. The things which are exclusively<br />
mine were superannuation, supplementary payments,<br />
the Child Support Agency, although I did that with<br />
Brian Howe, but without the Tax Office it wouldn't<br />
have happened.<br />
GD: Yes, but I suppose you could say you've also<br />
presided over a recession in which now 680,000<br />
children have neither parent working at home. And<br />
you yourself say that the most important policies<br />
you can do for women is to get the economy going<br />
properly, you've said that all through the 1980s so<br />
that they can be the beneficiaries of it. So that<br />
has also occurred and maybe it is a stylistic thing,<br />
maybe your style is more playing the game of<br />
politics with a perception of the predator and the<br />
ruthlessness which women just distrust<br />
fundamentally.<br />
PM: I think they ought to look at what we do as well as<br />
what we say. You mentioned about the jobs in the<br />
1980s we went from a work force of six million to<br />
seven and a half million, a 25 per cent increase.<br />
That slowed down of course in the recession, it<br />
stopped in the recession. But about 65 per cent of<br />
those jobs went to women.<br />
GD: But was that the plan?<br />
PM: The plan was a positive discrimination in favour of<br />
employment. Employment wasn't residual, it dropped<br />
down in numbers and we went after employment. The<br />
whole Accord process of agreed income determination<br />
was to devote the proceeds of that restraint to<br />
growth and we had very low participation rates<br />
amongst women and that rose quite sharply. Can I<br />
say also on education, we've taken participation<br />
rates in schools from 3 in 10 in 1983 to now nearly<br />
8 in 10 and lifted university places by 50 per cent.<br />
The great part of that has gone to women, to girls,<br />
and I don't know of any better way of giving women<br />
in the economy a change to participate than through<br />
education.<br />
GD: But then there's a collolary to that which is child<br />
care, which is the other major thing that does<br />
preoccupy women. If you're going to have more and<br />
more women not taking full responsibility in those<br />
early years someone's going to have to do that.<br />
Will it be the State in your view?<br />
PM: We have taken, I think I said to you earlier, child<br />
care places from 50,000 to 250,000 by 1995 and no<br />
doubt when we get there we will continue on. That </p>
<p>has made a major contribution to participation for<br />
women by women, to have that facility, to have the<br />
support. And now there is work la ce child care,<br />
which again we pioneered, and now naving companies<br />
involved. The tax office, can I say as a<br />
Commonwealth agency under me, the first place where<br />
the Commonwealth agreed to have child support at<br />
work was the Tax Office. Trevor Boucher and I<br />
agreed we'd do it. That is, the first Commonwealth<br />
agency that had child care support at work. This is<br />
also now true of the private economy and private<br />
business.<br />
GD: I suppose it is a question of degree. At the inner<br />
city child care centre in the building in which I<br />
work in Sydney, there is an 18 month waiting list<br />
for children under the age of two and they told me<br />
that that's true basically of all inner city child<br />
care centres. That's a lot of people whose lives<br />
are being affected because they can't get child care<br />
places. Maybe we've just got to think on an<br />
altogether difference scale about childcare. Do you<br />
think that?<br />
PM: I think the cost of running a full day care centre<br />
is such that you can't build it at a speed beyond<br />
which we've gone. But in shared costs, in work<br />
place accommodation and in other child care services<br />
particularly at home, that is beyond the long day<br />
care centre, that gives us a chance of opening the<br />
system up at a more marginal cost. I think it will<br />
be a combination of the two.<br />
GD: And are you talking about a blend of private and<br />
public?<br />
PM: Largely I think yes.<br />
GD: Right.<br />
PM: But that's not to say that the core program which is<br />
being for the long day care centres, we don't regard<br />
as anything other than the core.<br />
GD: This is the fee reliefsyste..<br />
PM: The fee relief system for the low paid. Can I just<br />
say these are all the things John Hewson would put<br />
the cleaners through, he makes that abundantly<br />
clear. And so again, just going back to your point,<br />
don't judge him by the mild-mannered doorstop, judge<br />
him by what he says he'll do and what we've done. I<br />
think that's the point.<br />
GD: I wonder, I'll come back to that in a moment, I<br />
wonder whether just as all Australian parents expect<br />
the government, as a basic provision, to provide<br />
primary school education, can you see a time when </p>
<p>the government also expects to provide pre-school<br />
child care, just an item of consolidated revenue?<br />
PM:. I think universally no, because of its size and<br />
vast cost, but in principle, yes because we've<br />
already crossed that rubicon. We crossed that<br />
rubicon by providing the various categories of child<br />
care and by carrying the cost of private provision<br />
for child care. So it will happen, but again like<br />
all other social change and reform it will take<br />
time.<br />
GD: How long do you imagine? I mean what sort of<br />
process do you think we're presiding over as a<br />
country, this transition to a quite new way in which<br />
we take responsibility for children, the way in<br />
which we order our households, the way in which we<br />
all work?<br />
PM: I think that's going to change. I think we're going<br />
to see people trained and re-trained and shifting<br />
the style of their work, the retiring age in reality<br />
has probably come down as people have in fact, not<br />
retired, but taken on other forms of work. The<br />
workforce is changing and patterns of work are<br />
changing and this is also true with women. I think<br />
that child care has become part of the expectation<br />
of mobility for Australia women and this government<br />
has done its best to make as many places available<br />
in the various forms.<br />
GD: A lot of the market research that's done by good<br />
market researchers say that underneath it all, men<br />
in particular, are very concerned about this. Again<br />
they know that the trends are there, but underneath<br />
it all are anxious and they are resentful about<br />
these changes. They sort of say I don't know<br />
whether I ever joined the debate, it's happening<br />
despite me. Can you honestly say you're not like<br />
that?<br />
PM: Resentful about what?<br />
GD: Resentful of the fact that the households they<br />
thought they'd inherit are not there to inherit.<br />
That their children are looked after by others other<br />
than their immediate family, that their wives are<br />
going out, they maybe have to cook the meal at night<br />
and do the ironing.<br />
PM: I'm certainly not resentful about it.<br />
GD: Do you ever do the ironing?<br />
PM: No, I don't do the ironing very often.<br />
GD: Do you do the cooking? </p>
<p>PM: No,* I don't do that much ' either. I'll be honest<br />
with you I haven't, but I've done my bit when I<br />
think it has mattered. But again, I wouldn't take<br />
the view that one should be resentful. The barriers<br />
to women's participation in the workforce have been<br />
quite profound and where-ever I can give the system<br />
a nudge to help open it up I have. Whether it's in<br />
the Commonwealth area or in the Treasury itself or<br />
where-ever its been I've tried to give them a break<br />
that the system is sort of not prone to give, that<br />
it needs again that positive push. And I don't<br />
think you can take that view and at the same time be<br />
resentful, it's a dichotomy view. I regarded the<br />
right to an interesting life, job, as a primary<br />
right of Australian women.<br />
GD: But there is a cost to that, isn't there, in terms<br />
of who looks after the children? In the next<br />
generation who is actually going to come through and<br />
be responsible, absolutely? And, there is<br />
increasing evidence that because we can't rethink<br />
work we've got rigid work structures contributing to<br />
family dysfunction. What role do you see government<br />
playing in trying to, both by carrot and stick<br />
methods, get companies to change the way they allow<br />
people to work?<br />
PM: I think it is changing, I think households are quite<br />
efficient at working these things out. I wouldn't<br />
be as gloomy as I think you think some are about<br />
working these things out and we all know, I'm sure<br />
you do Geraldine, I do, of families that are in<br />
exactly this situation and they work it out very<br />
well.<br />
GD: Dare I say that I have actually been through this<br />
and you have not. I think a lot of women look on<br />
and say look there he is with his neat home and<br />
everything is very orderly for him and basically<br />
because by either by choice or by need I'm there<br />
living in this sort of turmoil and there is a lot of<br />
evidence about that. Why would you understand what<br />
thousands of people are going through?<br />
PM: Whatever understanding I have of it, I have used to<br />
shift public policy in favour of that variation in<br />
the style of the Australian family. It's not<br />
necessarily a matter for me to say well I have to<br />
function that way too, otherwise good policy can't<br />
be made.<br />
GD: You've sat in the Cabinet room and I suppose you've<br />
had an incredible vantage point there, you have seen<br />
the toll that politics and ambition have taken on<br />
families of your colleagues. Do you often reflect<br />
on that, I wonder? </p>
<p>PM: Public life is very hard, because it is so intrusive<br />
it wears away at any family situation. But all the<br />
same, there's no point particularly in looking at<br />
ourselves, it all gets back to we've got the policy<br />
levers so what are we going to do with them? Do we<br />
do progressive things with them or do we take<br />
reactionary positions? For my part, I hope I've<br />
always taken progressive positions.<br />
GD: Maybe it's no longer enough to assume that people<br />
understand where you're coming from with the way the<br />
world is changing nowadays. it's almost like people<br />
have to make a statement about their attitudes to<br />
the changing roles between men and women, there's<br />
almost an acceptance that things are not as they<br />
once were. And maybe that's an area where you<br />
haven't bought into this very much at all in the<br />
past. I wonder why you're doing it now?<br />
PM: Because now I am Prime Minister, then I was<br />
Treasurer and social policy would have been<br />
announced by Brian Howe who was then Minister for<br />
Social Security, or in the case of women's policy,<br />
by Susan Ryan and her successors. The things which<br />
you have primary carriage, the announcement impacts,<br />
the announcement affects were basically not in the<br />
Treasury portfolio. But in the Treasury portfolio<br />
certainly all of the capacity and grease on the<br />
tracks which put these things into place, obtained.<br />
That is I was able to use that job to do many of<br />
these things which wouldn't have otherwise been<br />
done. But I wasn't the one announcing them and I<br />
think what happens in this country is synonomous<br />
with your own announcements. People sort of type<br />
cast you. It's the same with women in the<br />
government, can I say this, that after the 1987<br />
election the factions of the Caucus decided that<br />
they would have no women. And I said to Bob Hawke<br />
at the time this was an outrage that we've just been<br />
returned to office and the notion was that Susan<br />
Ryan was in risk of being defeated in the Centre<br />
Left and she was the only woman member of the<br />
ministry, and I suggested that Bob should say that<br />
we insist upon at least each grouping providing a<br />
woman. And that's where the three places camne from<br />
in 1987.<br />
GD: So it was you and not him? We heard it was him.<br />
PM: No, it was me. I put the view to him, and can I say<br />
it was a view that Bob was sympathetic with. I<br />
wanted to see at the time that Susan was maintained<br />
there, I was trying to get Ros Kelly up from the<br />
Right of the Party and it was also. I felt it<br />
important that one of the women on the Left got a<br />
place as well. So I argued this and I didn't have<br />
to argue it hard to him because Bob always had, I<br />
think, a similar view to me about this, but at least </p>
<p>he then put to the factions that this is as it<br />
should be.<br />
GD: And why the opposition to them? How do you<br />
determine..<br />
PM: Jobs, simply jobs about who was able to win them and<br />
who was vulnerable. Nothing more than that, you<br />
know what sort of scramble takes place after a<br />
general election. Amid the scramble a lot of these<br />
things get trampled upon. So I went out there<br />
barracking for that and I was quite happy and of<br />
course, I've always had a lot of loyalty from the<br />
people who I've helped, Susan and Ros et cetera.<br />
GD: I think we need a little music break before we<br />
actually come back and discussed the vexed issue of<br />
unemployMent. We happen to have a Mahler here,<br />
knowing that you're a fan. Just last Friday the ABC<br />
brought out a CD of Stewart Challender's conducting<br />
the Sydney Symphony Orchestra in Mahler's<br />
Resurrection Symphony. Which is the part which you<br />
like most of that?<br />
PM: If you're listeners can stand it the last five or<br />
six minutes.<br />
GD: As good as you hoped?<br />
PM: The orchestra was a bit thin. That's a very hard<br />
thing to do well, but it was good enough.<br />
GD: Maybe you need Mahler to listen to when you consider<br />
unemployment.<br />
PM: With the conversation we're having it would have<br />
been better with the slow movement from the third<br />
because to belt your listeners with that is..<br />
GD: The triumphant Mahler, not quite the tone with which<br />
to..<br />
PM: No.<br />
GD: There does appear to be finally, I suggest to you,<br />
rising indignation about youth unemployment in<br />
particular and the way it's setting us up to reap a<br />
sort of whirl wind of misery in the next ten years,<br />
just leaving aside this recession altogether. Even<br />
the AMA is urging you now I notice to spend money<br />
and set up a national task-force. Can people look<br />
forward to anything practical on this issue in the<br />
next twelve months?<br />
PM: It's a problem, a real problem, but I don't think we<br />
should be unduly gloomy about it. Great strides<br />
have been made to take our 15 to 19 year olds and<br />
educate them and provide interesting job </p>
<p>opportunities for them in the new order economy we<br />
developed from the 1980s. Now certainly we've been<br />
through the period of the recession which is both<br />
unfortunate and disappointing for many people, but<br />
we've also changed from the sorts of jobs we had in<br />
the 1950s, ' 60s and 170s the so called dead-end<br />
jobs. There are fewer of them out there for 15 to<br />
19 year olds because, as a cohort they've moved on<br />
to the more interesting trained jobs, and I think<br />
the statistics are not that well understood. Only<br />
about 2 or 3 kids in 10 in that group, 15 to 19 year<br />
olds, are in the work force and only about 1 in<br />
of them are unemployed.<br />
GD: Yes I understand.<br />
PM: Now that's a problem.<br />
GD: Indeed.<br />
PM: But it's not 46 per cent of them. This notion that<br />
half of them are unemployed, that's not right.<br />
GD: True, but even so there's a tragedy in those 2 in<br />
anyway and there's a great deal of debate about how<br />
many more we should be adding. But even if we look<br />
a few years down the track as people have pointed<br />
out, we've got so many kids staying on now, what<br />
about the log jam when they actually come out into<br />
the workforce with high hopes and expectation that<br />
education is going to deliver them jobs, and the<br />
jobs aren't there and in the next few years there's<br />
not a lot of evidence that there's going to be jobs<br />
there.<br />
PM: The 1980s proved the jobs were there, that was the<br />
point.<br />
GD: Then they vanished and the restructuring is underway<br />
and it suggests they've gone.<br />
PM: No, they haven't vanished. We started off with a<br />
workforce of 6 million in 1983 and we've today,<br />
notwithstanding the unemployment got a workforce of<br />
seven and a half million, so it's 25 per cent larger<br />
than it was. Those jobs have been held. In the<br />
sort of economy we are now developing, a much more<br />
sophisticated one where we are adding value to both<br />
manufacturing and to services, young people trained<br />
for that kind of economy will find jobs. The key<br />
for us is to lift product, to lift GDP because<br />
whenever one looks at a graphic illustration of<br />
unemployment and GDP you find whenever growth rises<br />
so too does employment. The key for us is to get<br />
growth up.<br />
GD: Yes, but haven't we also known that out of every<br />
recession since the 1961 credit squeeze more people </p>
<p>have emerged unemployed at the end of that recession<br />
and that is a very unpleasant cyclical trend we<br />
haven't escaped?<br />
PM: Because of structural change. The kind of economy<br />
that we were in coming into each recession was<br />
different from the one we have coming out and it<br />
leaves people untrained for the change and we have<br />
what's called structural unemployment. Now the aim<br />
for us is to get that structural unemployment down<br />
and to deal with the long-term unemployed, the<br />
people who end up being unemployed for 12 months or<br />
more and to get them into labour market programs and<br />
get them trained, get them out, get them moving, get<br />
them job experience and get them going. But what<br />
we're seeking to do now is to look at those 1 in<br />
to 19 year olds who are unemployed and try and<br />
find through a change in entry level training wages,<br />
that is a training wage, a wage we pay to those kids<br />
in skilled or semi-skilled jobs, let them in and<br />
then train them. That's currently what we're<br />
looking at, that is trying to take them and say look<br />
alright the deadend job has disappeared, the ones<br />
which were there in the thousands when I was a kid<br />
are now not there. There are jobs but they're<br />
trained jobs, you're not trained, what can we do to<br />
help you. First of all we'll give you a job, we'll<br />
give you job experience..<br />
GD: Who is going to pay for that?<br />
PM: I think that is going to be done by a combination of<br />
the government and employers and this meeting I'm<br />
having in a few weeks is about that very thing, that<br />
is, what will employers contribute, what will the<br />
Commonwealth contribute to taking kids up, giving<br />
them work experience, and training them while they<br />
are getting it.<br />
GD: Are you talking about a grant scale thing? How much<br />
money are we talking about?<br />
PM: We're not down to dollars and cents, but something<br />
which is going to make a significant difference to<br />
the problem.<br />
GD: In the next six to twelve months?<br />
PM: Geraldine, people should understand that there is<br />
something good happening here. what's happened in<br />
the 1980s is that we've lost a lot of those jobs<br />
which had no future, which were deadend jobs, were<br />
not interesting and were low paid<br />
GD: No, but they got people into the community, they got<br />
them out of their homes. </p>
<p>PM: Yes, and they never got them anywhere else. That<br />
was as far as they'd ever got them. The jobs you<br />
are sort of seeing, we've seen in the last half a<br />
dozen years, people can start of f quite young in the<br />
job and find themselves in London for six months or<br />
find themselves in Tokyo back into Australia. It's<br />
now a more interesting economy than it was in the<br />
1960s or 1970s, and even though its stopped growing<br />
for the moment, it's now growing again. The fact is<br />
that they are more interesting jobs and they're<br />
taken by trained people and that's why we have<br />
lifted the number of university places sharply in<br />
the 1980s, we've added 50 per cent of places to<br />
universities and I'm now trying to get technical and<br />
further education going so that the 60 per cent of<br />
kids who cascade out of school come into a<br />
vocational education system if they can't get into<br />
university. And again they get trained to be taken<br />
up in those jobs. So it's not as if the jobs are<br />
not there for them, it's just they are different<br />
sorts of jobs. They are trained jobs not untrained<br />
jobs.<br />
GD: Yes.<br />
PM: Skilled jobs.<br />
GD: Yes, but you say yourself you have got to create<br />
jobs, you've got to make jobs. Those jobs on the<br />
sort of scale we are talking about are not there yet<br />
in Australia are they?<br />
PM: In the 1980s they were there. They came through<br />
very, very fast. That's why what the Government's<br />
got to do is get all the structural impediments<br />
down, get inflation down, get the competitive<br />
influences running through the place.<br />
GD: Are the unions an impediment in this case? Are they<br />
going to accept a wage that maybe undermines their<br />
entire award structure?<br />
PM: We will get agreement with the trade unions about<br />
this particular problem because I think they feel<br />
that there is not enough accommodation for kids of<br />
this age group in the labour market.<br />
GD: Julian Disney addressed the press club earlier this<br />
year and he said that our current level of spending<br />
on work creation programs which is quick-fix<br />
PM: Labour market programs.<br />
GD: Is one third lower per unemployed person than during<br />
the 1982-83 recession, and much lower than in most<br />
other developed countries. </p>
<p>PM: I don ' t know whether that'Is true, but the f act is<br />
there are 40,000 fewer 15 to 19 year olds unemployed<br />
now than there were in 1982-83 40,000 fewer.<br />
GD: And there is a real assertion particularly down in<br />
Victoria that the sense of demoralisation is more<br />
acute now despite those numbers, than it was in<br />
1982-83. If you're a kid in Broadineadows you<br />
perceive that there is no hope in the future.<br />
PM: I think that the mood in Victoria is different to<br />
the rest of the nation. Unemployment is falling now<br />
in NSW, it's falling in WA and it's falling in QLD,<br />
but its rising still in VIC and it's rising in SA<br />
and there's no doubt that people will be gloomy<br />
about it and perhaps it is an entirely reasonable<br />
reaction. My job in that respect is to try and get<br />
the economy in general growing and that's the best<br />
way of taking employment up. But at the same time,<br />
make the training places available for these people<br />
so that the job they had searched for at age 19 or<br />
is not the job they might have searched for at<br />
age 16.<br />
GD: Say if this gets of f the ground, say if this summit<br />
produces the best possible result you can imagine,<br />
what firms might collaborate with you? And are we<br />
going to see people actually to be able to be<br />
employed in say September?<br />
PM: I think so yes, I think those firms which tend to<br />
employ quite large numbers of people and don't<br />
necessarily require them all to be skilled could<br />
take people up. And that would be the aim of this,<br />
to take them up.<br />
GD: You know BHP say, the railways like state government<br />
instrumentalities, things like that?<br />
PM: The big retailers. The ones you mentioned and the<br />
large retailing firms, any of the f irms which employ<br />
large numbers of people have the capacity of taking<br />
up, providing that the price and conditions are<br />
right.<br />
GD: And they will bill the government?<br />
PM: In part yes, for the training component of it. So<br />
in other words it's a way of getting that part of<br />
the cohort of 15 to 19 year olds, those who are in<br />
the workforce, as I say that 2 or 3 in 10 who are in<br />
the workforce because the other 7 or 8 are in<br />
training in education, that 2 or 3 in 10 and that 1<br />
in 10 who can't find a job. It's that 1 in the 2 or<br />
3 who can't find a job, they're the people we've got<br />
to pick up and this is what I hope we can do. </p>
<p>GD: Dr Hewson is saying today that he will provide $ 2<br />
billion if he comes into government to create a<br />
youth wage and he claims this will create 500,000<br />
jobs.<br />
PM: The fact is he claimed his Fightback proposal will<br />
create two million jobs. When we pressed him about<br />
it he said his proposals were never econometrically<br />
modelled, that two million was a guess and he since<br />
said on radio two million is not a real world<br />
estimate, don't pin me to that. The truth is that<br />
what he will do is tear most of these social<br />
programs down, he's going to cut about S7 billion<br />
out of outlays and the things that will cop it will<br />
be the labour market programs and the training.<br />
We're going to put $ 700 million in three years into<br />
TAFE, he proposed I think to put S50 million into<br />
it. Well it wouldn't touch the sides. The fact is<br />
he believes in the survival of the fittest policies,<br />
if you're not a millionaire you're a bludger, if you<br />
haven't got a decent house and trail of expensive<br />
cars to show for it then what have you been doing<br />
out there? Telling people after nine months of<br />
unemployment benefit you're down to the St Vincent<br />
de Paul Society or the Brotherhood of St Lawrence is<br />
not the kind of policies, I think, Australians<br />
should have or will accept. So when Dr Hewson<br />
starts talking about opportunities, training you can<br />
take it with a grain of salt because just turn up<br />
the Fightback policy and you'll see where he's put<br />
his money and his money is not in those areas.<br />
GD: I'd like to close by bringing it back to the<br />
personal and I'm wondering in terms of thinking<br />
about the way family life unfolds and looking at the<br />
future, most of us who are parents reflect on the<br />
way we have parented and probably believe we'd dosome<br />
things differently if we had our time over<br />
again. This is something that you never really talk<br />
about a great deal, your concept of yourself I<br />
suppose as a parent, as a father, would you do<br />
things differently if you had your time again? Have<br />
you learned over these years and have you changed?<br />
PM: You must learn. Life experience, I think, teaches<br />
you things and I do wonder what my children will do,<br />
How they'll grow up, what jobs they'll have, how<br />
their lives will be. I have three girls and a son<br />
and I do think more about the girls than I do my<br />
son.<br />
GD: Why?<br />
PM: Because I think the job opportunities for women have<br />
been constrained for a very long time in Australia,<br />
it's only more recently they have opened up and<br />
getting the training one needs and finding the </p>
<p>opportunities is I think, quite a challenge for<br />
them.<br />
GD: I wonder whether with him, he is the man, ironically<br />
he is the young man who will be inheriting this<br />
totally different world from what we hear where<br />
there's actually going to be much more of a demand<br />
upon him, ironically the onus will be on him to be a<br />
different sort of man to you in the way he sets up a<br />
family life. So it's possible that he is the one<br />
who's more deserving of your sympathy.<br />
PM: That will happen I think rather naturally, because<br />
the person he's likely to share his life with will<br />
have different attitudes than our generation and<br />
therefore he's likely to grow up comprehending that<br />
attitudinal change rather than being confronted by<br />
it, that is providing for it rather than being<br />
confronted by it. I think there's a sort of<br />
naturalness about all that, but women still have a<br />
tough go of it in employment. It's not easy, I can<br />
see this in the bureaucracy, you can see it in the<br />
companies, it's not easy to crack through. Many do<br />
of course and do well, but there still needs to be I<br />
think, on the part of all of us to open those<br />
opportunities up.<br />
GD: And if you had to describe one of the main issues<br />
that makes it difficult for them, how would you<br />
characterise it?<br />
PM: Just the sort of I think the sort chauvinist view of<br />
the world that men are just, employers are not<br />
making the adequate adjustment and yet the education<br />
system is now churning out thousands of trained<br />
women so it is going to change, it's changing and<br />
fortunately it's changing fast and it's going to<br />
keep on changing. But it's got to change a great<br />
deal.<br />
GD: I wonder in terms of the people you employ do you<br />
see yourself developing a different relationship<br />
with professional women because it is hitting a lot<br />
of people at work now in ways it hasn't done in<br />
their home.<br />
PM: I have a large complement of professional women on<br />
my staff, but this is less true of commerce in<br />
general. But again, like everything else it's<br />
changing, keep knocking on the door, leaning on the<br />
door it will change. But you've got to do it,<br />
governments have got to do it, governments have got<br />
to be aware of it and try and facilitate it and in<br />
the things I spoke to you about before whether it be<br />
preservation of superannuation benefits, whether it<br />
be a child care provision or whatever these are all<br />
things which are going to make it easier. That is<br />
higher retention rates in schools, places in </p>
<p>universities, they're all going to make that<br />
transition easier and quicker, faster.<br />
GD: . Is there any country you'd like us to be modelled<br />
on, that offer us some possibilities?<br />
PM: I think we are way ahead of most OECD countries. In<br />
terms of, if you like, positive support for women's<br />
participation in the workforce and policies which<br />
support that notion, I think there are very few OECD<br />
countries we can learn that much from. But again,<br />
whereever you see a good idea, take it up and do<br />
something with it. But like a lot of things<br />
Australians are not that aware that so much has been<br />
done like the things I mentioned earlier and are<br />
still being don.<br />
GD: So if we have a feeling, if women have a feeling or<br />
an inkling that you're not a feminist because you're<br />
rightly regarded as you said recently as that most<br />
conservative of creatures a family man, is that a<br />
wrong assessment is it?<br />
PM: I'm a family man and very much in the traditional<br />
sense, but in terms of the policies which I have<br />
either pushed through myself or I've done in the<br />
company of others they are entirely progressive in<br />
that sense and whenever I've seen an opportunity to<br />
advance the cause of women I have effectively, if<br />
often quietly, pushed the policy through and if you<br />
don't believe me ask some of the ones I've been<br />
associated with. Ask Ros, ask Susan Ryan because<br />
they were all around when that all happened.<br />
GD: Alright, thank you very much indeed. It's been good<br />
to speak to you. We've been asking you for quite<br />
some time so thanks for joining us.<br />
PM: Thank you Geraldine, good.<br />
