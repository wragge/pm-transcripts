    <content><![CDATA[<p>On behalf of the Government and the Liberal Party I thank Tony Nutt for his extraordinary service to the Party and to the nation in more than 35 years of public service.</p>
<p>As principal private secretary and then as chief of staff Tony was at the centre of the Howard Government, the most successful of our generation.<br />
He is the consummate political professional and the Liberal Party has no more loyal or dedicated servant.</p>
<p>Tony has been a dear friend and very wise counsel to me and Lucy for many years. His advice has been invaluable, always carefully considered and invariably delivered with a full historical context both modern and ancient. Tony is in every respect a scholar and a gentleman.</p>
<p>Tony took over the directorship of the Federal Liberal Party in late 2015 in very difficult circumstances, he then proceeded to direct the campaign which saw the government returned in the face of a ferocious fear campaign.</p>
<p>It is customary nowadays to deprecate politics, politicians and above all political professionals. But the truth is they, and the parties they run, make our democracy work.</p>
<p>Tony’s service over so many years is grounded in a deep love of Australia and an abiding commitment to our democratic values. I look forward to the next chapter of his remarkable career of public service.<br />
