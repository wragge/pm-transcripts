    <content><![CDATA[<p>I am personally saddened, as are my colleagues, by the death overnight of Senator Jeannie Ferris.</p>
<p>She was a wonderful friend and colleague who fought valiantly against the cancer that ultimately claimed her life.</p>
<p>I had frequent discussions with her over the past two years about her fight and she was always realistic about the threat the disease posed to her life.</p>
<p>Despite the grim outlook, she displayed a remarkable optimism and courage that warmed and inspired her colleagues and friends.</p>
<p>Senator Ferris made a significant contribution to public life in roles with the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, the National Farmers' Federation and as a Ministerial Chief of Staff in Dean Brown's South Australian Liberal government. </p>
<p>She served in the Senate for almost 11 years and had been the Government Whip in the Upper House since August 2002. Last year, Senator Ferris bravely discussed her battle with cancer as a member of a Senate committee examining gynaecological cancers.</p>
<p>Janette and I extend our deepest sympathies to Senator Ferris' family and friends. </p>
