PRIME INISTE<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P. J. KEATING, MP<br />
PRESENTATION OF NATIONAL MULTICULTURAL ADVISORY COUNCIL'S<br />
REPORT, PARLIAMENT HOUSE, CANBERRA, 27 JUNE 1995<br />
I am pleased to be here today to accept this report from the National<br />
Multicultural Advisory Council and its Chairman, Mick Young.<br />
It's particularly good to see Mick around these parts I've always thought he left<br />
them much too early. But the talents he brought to politics his intelligence,<br />
humour, his great love of his fellow Australians and his great rapport with them<br />
suited him for this task, and I'm sure he has performed it superbly.<br />
The 1989 National Agenda for a Multicultural Australia set the scene for the<br />
Government's response to the changing composition of the Australian<br />
population. If we are now able to say that our cultural diversity is one of our great national<br />
successes and one of our great national assets we can also say that the 1989<br />
Agenda is a document of considerable stature in our recent history.<br />
Today's report marks another step along the way.<br />
And it is important that we make progress that we pay more than lip service to<br />
our cultural diversity.<br />
I think sometimes we talk about multiculturalism as a mirror of our achievements<br />
when really it should be seen as a mirror of the realities we have to face.<br />
That is why, if multicultural ism is to continue to work for us, it has to continue to<br />
evolve and adapt and, in communities, government and the bureaucracy, those<br />
in positions of leadership have to keep their minds open and responsive. </p>
<p>The success of this multicultural society does Australians great credit; and, as<br />
Volume 2 of this Reports makes clear, the achievements since the 1989 Agenda<br />
was handed down have been very substantial ones.<br />
But the future certainly cannot be taken for granted.<br />
Multicultural programs must continue to evolve to meet disparate and changing<br />
needs. We must keep pace with contemporary issues, seek out the benefits and<br />
opportunities as they arise and maintain a watchful eye on prejudice and<br />
intolerance. The architects and administrators of modern multicultural ism must resist the<br />
tendency of ideas to ossify and habits of mind to take on the shape and<br />
characteristics of ideology.<br />
. Every step towards ideology will distort the liberal aims of multicultural ism.<br />
Platitudes and jargon will stunt its growth.<br />
It is not just in the number of programs that multiculturalism must grow it must<br />
grow philosophically.<br />
It must look for new directions and be alive to the way Australia is going.<br />
That is the function of this Report to keep the process moving.<br />
I note, for instance, that the Report is concerned to acknowledge more fully than<br />
before the place of indigenous Australians in the arena of multicultural affairs,<br />
and that it attempts * to deal with areas of common concern and policy overlap.<br />
And I think it goes without saying that this Government entirely approves of this<br />
development. An altogether different recent example of the capacity for new thinking has been<br />
the development of strategies for " productive diversity". This requires us to see<br />
beyond the needs of ethnic communities to the advantages contained in their<br />
linguistic and cultural understanding.<br />
These days the designers of our investment, trade and industry policies, and an<br />
increasing number of business people, are conscious that this unique human<br />
resource offers a competitive edge in dealing with the world. </p>
<p>At another level, as we approach the centenary of our nationhood and come to<br />
grips with questions of our identity and our place in the world in the 21 st century,<br />
multicultural policies must define themselves against our national interests and<br />
ambitions. At the Global Diversity Conference in Sydney recently I proposed something<br />
resembling a model of multicultural rights and responsibilities. None of these<br />
mark in any way a departure from the fundamental multicultural principles laid<br />
down in the 1989 Agenda.<br />
The Australian Government continues to assert the right of all Australians to<br />
express their individual cultural heritage and their right to equality of treatment<br />
and opportunity.<br />
But it also asserts that the first loyalty of all who make Australia their home must<br />
be to Australia and that the tolerance on which multiculturalism is built must be<br />
recognised as a universal principle of Australian democracy, and practised<br />
universally.<br />
As a practical expression of this ambition, we are keen for migrants to take up<br />
citizenship we think it will build more national cohesion without diminishing at<br />
all the liberal, tolerant multicultural qualities of Australia.<br />
But in asking migrants to take up their democratic responsibilities we reaffirm our<br />
own. We are very much aware that the best thing we can do for ethnic groups in<br />
Australia is create an economy and society in which there is opportunity for<br />
people of energy and ambition to succeed, to create, to build good lives for<br />
themselves and their families.<br />
At the same time, we have to maintain the kind of social safety net which will<br />
give migrants and others the support they need when they are establishing<br />
themselves and when things go wrong.<br />
We are doing this through a social security system which is infinitely more<br />
sophisticated and efficient than it was a decade ago even five years ago.<br />
We are doing it through Medicare, employment education and training, housing<br />
and community services.<br />
These basic policies are not marked " multicultural" but on them, more than<br />
anything else we do, a successful multicultural society depends. </p>
<p>We can, of course, develop them in accordance with the needs created by our<br />
cultural diversity. And that is what we do. It is what access and equity is all<br />
about. It is why we take those steps to eliminate the barriers which arise from different<br />
languages, cultures and religions.<br />
It is why we insist on such practical steps as translating materials, targeting non-<br />
English speaking communities in information strategies, and the cross cultural<br />
training of government staff.<br />
These things really do help, because they really do address practical realities.<br />
They are part of a government's responsibility in a culturally diverse society.<br />
But cultural diversity is a matter for all Australians.<br />
It falls on communities, schools and businesses on every one of us to practise<br />
tolerance and garner the talents and ambitions of all who live here.<br />
It will help, I think, if we recognise that we have reached a point where it can be<br />
said that in these things we have a proud tradition to uphold.<br />
Among other things this Report makes that clear. It is an update, a report on<br />
progress and a signpost along the way which began with the immigration<br />
program fifty years ago.<br />
Some would say the tradition began long before that.<br />
Whenever it began, the tradition describes the evolution of a uniquely tolerant<br />
and culturally diverse democracy in Australia and the lesson is, we must keep<br />
working at it.<br />
That is why I am very glad to receive this report.<br />
The Government will give serious consideration to all the recommendations.<br />
I thank the Chairman, Mick Young, and the members of the National Multicultural<br />
Advisory Council for their conscientiousness and the work they have done for<br />
Australia. </p>
