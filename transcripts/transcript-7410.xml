PRIME MINISTER<br />
CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
BUSINESS COUNCIL OF AUSTRALIA<br />
SYDNEY 11 OCTOBER 1988<br />
Australia's growing enmeshment with the world economy<br />
requires that change becomes increasingly accepted as part<br />
of virtually every aspect of our life.<br />
Particularly in the management of economic affairs at the<br />
national, industry and workplace levels, relentless change<br />
and constant challenge are not merely speculations to be<br />
conjured with, or minor obstacles to be overcome, but facts<br />
that demand our active and unwavering engagement.<br />
It is my proud claim that in responding to the challenges of<br />
our changing economic world, the Government I have the honor<br />
of leading has displayed both breadth of vision and<br />
consistency of purpose.<br />
In March 1983, we inherited an economy undergoing the worst<br />
recession in 50 years; but we reversed that recession. In<br />
1985/ 86 we faced a collapse in our terms of trade; but our<br />
policies allowed us to endure that collapse while<br />
maintaining employment growth, and to begin the sweeping<br />
task of economic reconstruction.<br />
We inherited a community where the dice were loaded against<br />
the underprivileged; but through unprecedented tax and<br />
welfare reform we have pursued a social justice strategy<br />
which is making Australia a fairer society.<br />
At the same time as we faced the challenge of reforming the<br />
macro-economy, and at the same time as we pursued these<br />
social justice goals, we have also engaged in a systematic<br />
and comprehensive program of micro-economic reform and it<br />
is this which I wish to address today.<br />
I ask you to recall the inefficiencies of the economy we<br />
inherited in 1983: an over-valued and unresponsive exchange<br />
rate, an ossified financial system, an over-protected and<br />
inward-looking manufacturing sector, an excess of burdensome<br />
industry regulation, government business enterprises<br />
hamstrung by their guidelines and unresponsive to their<br />
2596 </p>
<p>customers, a wages system which perpetuated inflationary<br />
pressures, a government sector consuming far too much of the<br />
nation's savings, an inefficient transport system, an<br />
industrial relations system locked into expensive and futile<br />
confrontation, an education system failing to meet the needs<br />
of our most potentially productive workers.<br />
My Government has progressively addressed all of these<br />
problems. without being exhaustive, we floated the dollar,<br />
deregulated the financial system, cut tariffs, introduced a<br />
new era of industrial harmony, and introduced sensible<br />
co-operation through a series of industry plans.<br />
We did so because micro-economic reform is not some arcane<br />
technical exercise. while macroeconomic policy protects the<br />
economic ' base', micro reform will determine the future<br />
quality of life and standard of living of every Australian.<br />
The purpose is to shape an economy which promises durable<br />
improvements in the day-to-day lives of Australians more<br />
Jobs, greater growth, fewer people dependent on welfare and<br />
an economy able to afford adequate assistance for the truly<br />
needy. in other words, micro reform serves, very<br />
profoundly, human needs.<br />
But as we entered the 1987 Federal election campaign we<br />
recognised much still remained to be done.<br />
So when we sought a new mandate from the Australian people<br />
we identified micro reform as one of our chief priorities.<br />
In a speech I delivered in the last week of the 1987<br />
election campaign in Ballarat I identified a detailed agenda<br />
for micro-economic reform in our Third Term.<br />
Today I want to mention, only briefly, what we have achieved<br />
because an audience such as this is well aware of those<br />
achievements. More importantly, now that we are essentially<br />
midway through our Third Term I want to explain how we are<br />
going to maintain the momentum for reform.<br />
In Ballarat I promised to initiate significant workplace<br />
reforms through amalgamation of trade unions and through<br />
tackling outmoded work and management practices. Progress<br />
is underway in each of these areas.<br />
But the most fundamental reform is yet to come.<br />
The Chairman of the Business Council's Industrial Relations<br />
Committee, Mr Ian Webber, said recently that business should<br />
approach award restructuring as perhaps the biggest<br />
responsibility and opportunity that it had faced in the<br />
industrial relations arena.<br />
I welcome and endorse that judgement. As I said on Sunday<br />
in the Boyer Lecture, when the history of this period is<br />
written perhaps nothing will be seen as more significant<br />
than the fundamental restructuring of the industrial award<br />
system that is now underway. 25g17 </p>

classifications that represent the accumulated ossification defl<br />
of some 60 years will by mid next year be replaced by eight, cons<br />
And what happens in Metal Trades will establish a pattern<br />
for other areas. In sm<br />

Award structures in Australia have often reinforced narrow infr<br />
categorisation of skills and occupational classifications.<br />
They have contained provisions limiting the age and number I ma<br />
of apprentices. They have given rise to demarcation tack<br />
problems and have often failed to provide real incentives<br />
for skills formation or career development. I al<br />

The potent'ial benefits of reform are immense both for rela<br />
employers and employees. impo<br />

The Government is determined to give this reform process our ma mu<br />
strongest support, particularly through the Industrial inte<br />

and a major survey of workplace industrial relations. Effi<br />

Our reforms of higher education have attracted their share that,<br />

would hope for from this area. The Government is Wh i 1' 1<br />

Australia's schools. Federal and State Education Ministers hove'<br />
are looking, for example, at the potential for a national acknt<br />
approach to assessment, and more co-operative work on a<br />

mathematics and technology education. comp,<br />
Another vital element is to raise significantly industry's The:<br />
commitment to the national training effort. While we esta)<br />
recognise that there are many enlightened employers, too<br />
often training has been regarded as a cost to be avoided. I wol<br />
the<br />
now, </p>
<p>The Minister for Employment, Education and Training, John<br />
Dawkins, will shortly be consulting representatives of<br />
business on a wide range of options to remedy this<br />
deficiency. I encourage your active involvement in those<br />
consultations. In my Ballarat speech I highlighted our determination to<br />
initiate sweeping reform of the nation's transport<br />
infrastructure. I said we would terminate the two airlines agreement and<br />
tackle grain handling: we have done so.<br />
I also promised improved performance on the waterfront. Let<br />
me devote special attention today to this vital area and the<br />
related issue of coastal shipping. Together they represent<br />
important items on our current reform agenda.<br />
As we consider the reports we have recently received on<br />
these issues, we are determined not to shirk the challenges.<br />
Equally, we won't be rushed into ill-considered decisions.<br />
Our basic approach in this time of adjustment has been that<br />
of an equitable sharing of the burden. I can think of no<br />
reasonable argument why employers and unions in our<br />
manufacturing and export sectors must adjust to<br />
international trading conditions while stevedoring and<br />
shipping remain shielded.<br />
Efficient coastal shipping is vital, particularly if we are<br />
to increase the Australian flag share of our international<br />
cargo above its current 4 per cent and maximise the scope<br />
for further domestic raw material processing.<br />
The Business Council recently published its valuable report<br />
on coastal shipping. it is refreshing to see a critique of<br />
Australian coastal shipping that acknowledges the right of<br />
that industry to exist, provided of course that it can stand<br />
on its own two feet.<br />
while I do not agree with everything in the Business<br />
Council's plan, I do reaffirm the Government's commitment to<br />
promoting competitive coastal shipping.<br />
My Government will face the need to find effective solutions<br />
for the benefit of all Australians. This will involve,<br />
however, listening very closely to those involved and<br />
acknowledging progress already made.<br />
waterfront reform is necessary to make Australia truly<br />
competitive and export oriented.<br />
The Inter-state Commission's recent preliminary report<br />
establishes the basic agenda.<br />
I would encourage all of you to look at what you can offer<br />
the ISC's final hearings process. if you do not respond<br />
now, you will not be able to query the final result. 99 </p>
<p>From the Commonwealth's perspective, there are two basic Inl re<br />
areas which must be addressed. we need an appropriatewet<br />
incentive structure and competition amongst stevedoring thate<br />
companies to encourage a greater level of productivity. And ta<br />
we need a positive attitude from port authorities, both inMyG<br />
reducing the costs they impose on exporters and importers, Mevio<br />
and in encouraging a competitive use of port infrastructure. reuie<br />
On stevedoring, the ISC sees benefit in moving towardsWeh<br />
company employment, that is, individual companies having Wesda<br />
basic responsibility for their employees and costs, id<br />
providing both the incentive to keep . costs down and adequate We do<br />
means to'do so. revie<br />
The Government certainly accepts that initiatives to<br />
facilitate a more productive employer/ employee relationship Irev<br />
are highly desirable, and should be a major focus of the natur<br />
report. naur<br />
In this context, it is important that the views of the consu<br />
relevant unions and the employers of waterfront labour are If re<br />
given due consideration. This is a sensitive area for thesereu<br />
parties. I acknowledge that. Nevertheless, we expect the rdi',<br />
Interstate Commission to take the interests of all cnsi<br />
Australians into account. agrec<br />
Port authorities are the principal Government bodies on the Subse<br />
waterfront. While there have, very recently, been incli<br />
significant statements by port authorities on the need for<br />
them to encourage greater competition on the waterfront,<br />
there have been few specific initiatives. Requc ReguJ<br />
State Governments need to ensure that the ports do not be me<br />
burden users with outdated work practices, nor charge for submi<br />
costs which are unjustifiable. As ti<br />
I call therefore upon State Governments not only to respond ea<br />
to the ISC report, but to offer a firm statement of requf<br />
objectives for port authorities which puts users, and the consi<br />
costs imposed upon them, first. What greater role has a app r<br />
port authority than to facilitate Australia's trade? The<br />
The Commonwealth's recent reforms to its own business spec<br />
enterprises provide a lead. The<br />
It was my Government that put the waterfront on the reform al<br />
agenda: we are committed to seeing it through. regu.<br />
Another element of the micro agenda I highlighted in Alth(<br />
Ballarat was the steady elimination of unnecessary business sign.<br />
regulation. Corp(<br />
in " New Strategies for Regulatory Reform", which the-bus i<br />
Business Council prepared earlier in the year, you put more<br />
forward specific proposals to reduce the overall regulatory<br />
burden. many aspects of these proposals have already been<br />
incorporated in our conduct of Commonwealth Government<br />
business.<br />
2600 </p>
<p>In relation to the review of existing regulation, however,<br />
we think your suggestion for a request and response<br />
procedure is timely and tonight I am pleased to announce<br />
that Cabinet has decided to adopt such a mechanism.<br />
My Government has put a good deal of effort into selecting<br />
review targets where we think reform has been most urgently<br />
required.<br />
We have never believed that Government has a monopoly of<br />
wisdom. We do, however, want to avoid the cost of poorly focussed<br />
reviews. I have in mind, therefore, that requests for regulation<br />
review must describe the body of regulation at issue and the<br />
nature of the problem; they must cost the regulatory burden;<br />
suggest possible solutions; and indicate the extent of<br />
consultation on and support for the proposed review.<br />
If requests were supported by such information from a<br />
requesting company, union, business association or<br />
individual, the Government would be prepared to guarantee a<br />
considered response within two months, and if a review were<br />
agreed, to specify its nature and timetable.<br />
Subsequent reviews could be conducted by a range of bodies,<br />
including the Industries Assistance Commission.<br />
Requests in the first instance will go to the Business<br />
Regulation Review Unit, but decisions to proceed or not will<br />
be made by Cabinet's Structural Adjustment Committee on<br />
submission from the relevant Minister.<br />
As the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce,<br />
Senator John Button, explains in a press release today, this<br />
request/ response procedure will be implemented following<br />
consultation with business and consumer organisations on<br />
appropriate guidelines.<br />
The Government is also pushing ahead with a series of<br />
specific reforms in central areas of regulation.<br />
The Attorney-General, Lionel Bowen, has introduced to the<br />
Parliament bills which aim to introduce national law to<br />
regulate companies and securities markets in place of the<br />
many State and Territory laws presently operating.<br />
Although the national law is based on the existing law, some<br />
significant reform is envisaged, particularly the Close<br />
Corporations Bill which responds to direct requests from the<br />
business community by providing a significantly simpler and<br />
more flexible corporate framework for small business. 2G01 </p>
<p>I invite you all to take a close interest in these reform<br />
bills. Only a national approach can facilitate the<br />
efficient companies and securities regulation that Australia<br />
needs, and I am pleased with the support given to this<br />
proposal by the Business Council.<br />
In broadcasting, we are reviewing the regulation of pay<br />
television.<br />
We are also reviewing the adequacy of the much-amended<br />
Broadcasting Act, and its significant impact on business and<br />
consumers. Again to-refer back to our election pledges, I promised in<br />
Ballarat that we would deregulate crude oil marketing.<br />
You all know we delivered on that promise.<br />
Today I want to announce a further related reform.<br />
Following our decision on crude oil, the Government has now<br />
reviewed our liquefied petroleum gas ( LPG) policies.<br />
We have decided to terminate the existing administered<br />
pricing formula and instead from 1 February 1989 give the<br />
Prices Surveillance Authority ( PSA) responsibility for<br />
determining maximum wholesale prices for LPG.<br />
This will bring LPG pricing into line with other major<br />
petroleum products. The PSA will be able to adopt a more<br />
flexible approach to price setting and be more responsive to<br />
changing market conditions.<br />
Export controls on LPG will be reviewed after 18 months. In<br />
the meantime export controls will be available strictly as a<br />
reserve power, safeguarding domestic supply until the new<br />
pricing arrangements are well established.<br />
These changes are described in more detail in a press<br />
release issued by the Minister for Resources, Senator Peter<br />
Cook. Ladies and Gentlemen<br />
All of the activity I have outlined tonight builds on the<br />
pledges I made to the Australian people during the election<br />
campaign last year.<br />
They all show that much hard work remains ahead of us over<br />
the rest of our third term. We will not shirk it.<br />
And my list is not yet complete.<br />
For example, in Ballarat, I promised steps to increase<br />
significantly the size of Australia's hi-tech computer and<br />
communications industry. The partnership scheme introduced<br />
by John Button puts us well on the way to building a strong<br />
export base in this vital area.<br />
2602 </p>
<p>We are now reviewing the assistance arrangements for the<br />
telecommunications industry, which has long been sheltered<br />
by complex and costly forms of protection.<br />
In Ballarat I promised new efforts to refine our research<br />
and development skills another essential contribution to<br />
economic growth and competitiveness which Australia must<br />
improve if it is to survive.<br />
The Government has worked hard to provide incentives through<br />
tax credits and through the GIRD program to lift private<br />
investment in R&amp; D.<br />
Today we are taking another step: my colleague the Minister<br />
for Science, Barry Jones, will announce the details of a<br />
senior officials group which is being established to make<br />
recommendations on the most effective ways to strengthen<br />
research and development in science and technology. The<br />
group is to provide a preliminary report to the Structural<br />
Adjustment Committee by the end of November.<br />
We will be seeking the support of the business community and<br />
others in raising Australia's R&amp; D effort.<br />
Ladies and Gentlemen<br />
As I foreshadowed in Ballarat, the Government has also taken<br />
steps to boost tourism, to ensure spin-offs for domestic<br />
Industry from the current defence modernisation program, to<br />
assist Australian firms tap new export markets, in<br />
particular through further enmeshment of our economy with<br />
the dynamic Asia/ Pacific region, and to further the growth<br />
of value-added processing industries within Australia.<br />
But today I do not want merely to advance a list of<br />
achievements or tasks for the future as sweeping as they<br />
are, and as proud of them as I am.<br />
Because what is perhaps as important as the substance of<br />
reform is the method of achieving it.<br />
AS I said over the weekend in the Boyer Lecture, the ready,<br />
almost welcoming, acceptance of the 30 per-cent reduction in<br />
protection in the May Statement provided a dramatic contrast<br />
to the critical and negative reception accorded the 25 per<br />
cent tariff cut in 1973.<br />
The main reason for this change of attitude has been our<br />
approach to the task of reform.<br />
This approach has involved two important principles : a<br />
concentration on ends rather than simply means, and a<br />
commitment to genuine consultation with those affected by<br />
proposed change.<br />
What is the aim of micro reform? It is to increase<br />
productivity. 2603 </p>
<p>The goal in not deregulation as such though it may be a<br />
helpful meani-towards the goal. Our political opponents<br />
fail to appreciate that fact. In opposition they espouse<br />
deregulation as a desirable goal in itself, although as you<br />
well know, in Government they did nothing of relevance in<br />
this area.<br />
Nowhere is this better seen than in their calls for ' labour<br />
market reform',. Our workplace and education and training<br />
reforms will achieve more change than they could ever<br />
deliver. In micro reform, results can never be immediate. r<br />
Institutions and attitudes change slowly. Public debate<br />
will be dominated by the vocal complaints of the minority<br />
who are adve-rsely affected, rather than by the vast majority<br />
of consumers and taxpayers who are incrementally advantaged.<br />
All this suggests, and underlines, the need for proper<br />
consultation and a willingness to ease the burdens on those<br />
facing change.<br />
Through consultation we have been able to explain to those<br />
affected that advantaging one industry by imposing costs on<br />
others must eventually impoverish the economy as a whole.<br />
From the point of view of the Government, micro reform has<br />
from time to time meant incurring the wrath of some<br />
constituents. But, in spite of this, our record shows plainly that we are<br />
capable of pursuing essential reform in a way that no<br />
government has done in 40 years.<br />
And ultimately, I believe that a Government widely seen to<br />
be acting strongly in the interests of all Australians will<br />
thereby ensure its longevity.<br />
Ladies and Gentlemen,<br />
I have this afternoon highlighted nine areas of reform: the<br />
workplace, education and training, coastal shipping, the<br />
waterfront, a request/ response regulation reform mechanism,<br />
broadcasting, companies law, telecommunications industries<br />
and science policy.<br />
The Government has commissioned major studies from the IAC<br />
which will form the basis of future work even beyond that.<br />
Reports are expected in the third quarter of 1989 on<br />
Government charges, and trade in services and tourism; and<br />
we have recently announced an inquiry into food processing<br />
which will include all aspects of regulatory arrangements<br />
and impediments to food processing, packaging and<br />
distribution.<br />
2G04 </p>
<p>If all this reinforces in your mind and through you, in<br />
the minds of the Australian people that we have a long way<br />
to go with the reform task we set ourselves, then that is<br />
precisely my intention.<br />
And if all this reinforces in your mind, as well, our<br />
resolve to complete our task of reform, than that too is my<br />
intention. In our task I call on the assistance of State governments in<br />
making the necessary hard decisions. All levels of<br />
government, not just the Commonwealth, have a role to play.<br />
In that task also, in closing, I seek your assistance as<br />
leaders of key industries you are well placed to understand<br />
the significance of the reforms we have in train, and well<br />
placed too to foster public comprehension of, and support<br />
for, them. 2605 </p>
