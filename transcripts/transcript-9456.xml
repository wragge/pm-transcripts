TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
PRESS CONFERENCE, PARLIAMENT HOUSE, CANBERRA<br />
22 DECEMBER 1994<br />
PM: As a result of the disquiet has been occasioned by the decision by the<br />
Government on export woodchips in the last few days, I have taken the<br />
opportunity in consultation with the senior members of the Cabinet<br />
to advance the Government's thinking and policy on the question of<br />
export woodchipping from native forests. Now, as you may know,<br />
there is a persistent circularity in these arguments about<br />
woodchipping. The Government has had a policy since early 1991 of<br />
phasing out export woodchips by the year 2000, or soon thereafter.<br />
And at this point, there hasn't been a phase-down in volumes. What is<br />
said to the industry is this phase-down will be diminished if you<br />
downstream process. The industry says " we won't invest in downstream<br />
processing without resource security, we can't get that without<br />
Regional Forest Agreements under the National Forest Policy<br />
Statement", but the Commonwealth can't produce the Regional Forest<br />
Agreements because under the statement we can only do so if the<br />
Commonwealth is invited by a State into the arrangements. The<br />
Commonwealth is not invited in the 2 years since the Statement, has<br />
not been invited into any arrangement by any state not NSW, not<br />
Victoria and not Tasmania. And one of the reasons we are not invited<br />
is because the industry doesn't encourage the invitation. So, it is a<br />
phase-down in exports unless they're in secondary processing, but<br />
there isn't secondary processing without the security coming from<br />
Regional Forest Policy statements, but the Commonwealth can't get<br />
into them without an invitation from the States, and we don't get an<br />
invitation because the industry doesn't want it. So that's the circle.<br />
Now, what I have decided to do is to throw a grenade into that circle,<br />
and to get that particular log-jam moving. What I am doing now is<br />
announcing on behalf of the Government that we are implementing a<br />
firm program under which Australia's native forest will be properly<br />
protected and preserved. As a consequence, from 1996 we will be<br />
reducing the maximum permissible level of exports by about 20% a </p>
<p>year, so that for 1996 the maximum permissible level of export of<br />
woodchips will be 5 million tonnes about 1 million tonnes less than<br />
this year. And the next year it will be around 4 million tonnes, and the<br />
next year around 3, until it is phased out by the year 2000. Now, save<br />
for and except where conditions outlined in this statement are met<br />
that is in respect to Regional Forest Agreements and domestic<br />
downstream processing. Now, where-that happens, the arrangements<br />
will then reserve for domestic consumption woodchipping in areas<br />
which are now currently going to export. So, in other words, instead of<br />
this process where we have had just evaluation of coupes each year<br />
which has old growth environmental values as to old growth, rare<br />
species etc but where the tonnages are still moving, what we will be<br />
doing is actually ratchetting the tonnages down. So by the year 2000,<br />
the Government will ban the export of woodchips from those areas of<br />
Australia's native forests which are not covered by Regional Forest<br />
Agreements incorporating a reserve system that comprehensively<br />
represents all forest types.<br />
Now, export woodchip licences in the future will only be granted in<br />
relation to areas where there has been significant progress towards, or<br />
the completion of, Regional Forest Agreements. Let me just decipher<br />
that for you, because these take about 18 months to 2 years to put in<br />
place. There has to be significant progress towards the completion of<br />
Regional Forest Agreements, as required under the National Forest<br />
Policy Statement, and the establishment of a comprehensive,<br />
adequate and representative reserve system. In those areas,<br />
companies which increase their domestic downstream processing<br />
capacity and have a demonstrable commitment to doing so in other<br />
words, where it is very clear that they are actually going to do it will<br />
have this taken into account when the Government is determining the<br />
export licence quotas between 1996 and 2000. So, we are now<br />
developing a strict timetable for each Regional Forest Agreement, and<br />
these will be developed on the basis of scientific and technical<br />
assessments of the values of all forests, particularly old growth and<br />
wilderness. We are also saying here that the Government will also<br />
consider helping the industry make the transition to a greater use and<br />
development of plantation and regrowth timbers. At the moment they<br />
are saying " let's hop into the native forests and get as much of it out of<br />
the road as we possibly can while the window's open, and we will think<br />
about the future of plantations and regrowth". We're saying that<br />
perhaps you ought to think about that earlier, and I think that approach<br />
will represent a significant step towards a sustainable forest products<br />
industry by the end of the century. Because this is a quite significant<br />
employer, and we in the Government wish to see this industry<br />
continue, but on a basis which is sustainable.<br />
As to the process for the actual coupes that is, there are 2 questions<br />
here the volume of the timber, and the quality of it and where it<br />
comes from. As to that, as I make clear in the statement, the </p>
<p>Government is to alter the process for considering the terms,<br />
conditions and size of woodchip exports in future the process for<br />
advising the Minister for Resources will be co-ordinated by the<br />
Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, and the Minister for<br />
Resources will formally consult me before making this decision. That<br />
would mean that all of these.. . that there will be a broader process<br />
where we are actually looking at the conservation values and the<br />
environmental values at particular coupes, albeit in the context of a<br />
declining level of volumes. The two things would amount to the<br />
implementation of certainly an advance of the Government's policy<br />
in respect of native forests, where in fact this conversation has been<br />
running now to the States for years. But where we haven't seen any<br />
movement on the National Forest Policy Statement towards Regional<br />
Forest Agreements, and in implementing a firm program under which<br />
Australia's native forests will be properly protected and preserved,<br />
while at the same time, keeping an eye to the regional employment<br />
consequences, and trying to refocus the timber industry into regrowth<br />
areas or into plantations. Now I'll be glad to take your questions.<br />
J: Prime Minister, given that all these problems were apparent before<br />
Tuesday's decision, wouldn't it have been wiser for full Cabinet<br />
consideration of this phasedown and also the problems surrounding<br />
the annual decisions on woodchip licences to have been done in an<br />
orderly fashion by Cabinet, rather than waiting for a botched decision<br />
from a junior Minister to force your hand?<br />
PM: Well, the thing is you can always you know, if I have got enough<br />
time I can strip the tariff barriers out of Australia, open up the financial<br />
markets, deal with native title issues, fix the old growth forest policy<br />
problems, and then move onto some of the bigger, broader identity<br />
issues into the bargain. I mean, it is all a matter of what one can<br />
reasonably do. This is an area which is essentially run by the States.<br />
I mean lets be clear about this the principal authorities in forest policy<br />
are the States<br />
J: Not in exports<br />
PM:.. not in exports, but this is not about simply exports -a lot of this<br />
argument is about what is being logged and what isn't. And we<br />
entered into the National Forest Policy Statement with the States,<br />
which is as a document of principle a good document. But it has got<br />
to be made to work. Now, in the event that these processes show that<br />
it is not working, at some point probably in the next 12 months, as we<br />
head towards that 2000 target we would have to do something about<br />
reducing the volume of exports of woodchips. I think all that has<br />
happened with this is that we have decided to do it now. I think better<br />
earlier than later. </p>
<p>J: Do you agree with the decision announced by Minister Beddall and if<br />
not, did you make your views known to him before he made it?<br />
PM: Well, I made my views clear to him but, in the end, and under the<br />
arrangements we had for this decision the final judgements were his.<br />
We set this up in the Cabinet process last year where Michael Lee<br />
actually went through this process on advice from the then<br />
environment Minister, Ros Kelly. I might say, by the way, when Mrs<br />
Kelly went out and said she scored a victory in Cabinet, being able to<br />
offer advice to the Minister for Resources, her antagonists in the<br />
Environment movement dismissed it. This year, of course, it is of<br />
major importance.<br />
J: Are you saying Mr Beddall ignored your advice?<br />
PM: I made my views clear to him but he was the one that had to go<br />
through the coupes and make assessments from information which<br />
was, in some respects, arriving. I think what was happening here was<br />
a problem, perhaps, of process rather than anything else. And, as I<br />
have just announced that change to you, we'll change the process over<br />
next year. So, we'll change the process and we'll change the process<br />
in the context of a much clearer policy about where we are actually<br />
going.<br />
J: Mr Keating, are you pleased with Minister Beddall's decision?<br />
PM: Well, look, I have made my position clear about that. Within the<br />
context of the responsibilities to make these judgements, as he<br />
understood it, he made the best decision he could make. And,<br />
therefore, what I am about is rather than giving any of you<br />
characters any cheap lines is moving on with how we actually do<br />
something good about the forests and how we draw some strength<br />
from this discussion, this debate.<br />
J: interpretation that can be put on it is that he misunderstood your<br />
guidance?<br />
PM: Well, you're a good interpreter of things, normally, Jim. That's why<br />
they pay you all that money.<br />
J: Prime Minister you say that the Government will consider rescheduling<br />
existing logging operations in some areas. Does that mean that some<br />
companies might not be able to fulfil their licences?<br />
PM: Well, there are licences and licences, here. There are licences which<br />
are just a tick on the previous year's licence, where there is no<br />
discretion by ministers, at all, as to coupes, etcetera. Where there is a<br />
discretion, what we are saying, the government will consider </p>
<p>rescheduling some of the operations. In other words, where we are<br />
looking at volume and quality I use the word quality in the broadest<br />
context of environmental values.... Where we are talking about, say,<br />
volume and environmental values, where the licences are a pro forma<br />
reissuance, well, that's done. Where they are not that, where there is<br />
a discretion, where environmental values are an issue, yes we will<br />
consider rescheduling some of the operations while, at the same<br />
time trying to maintain the volumes.<br />
J: Mr Keating, is the fact that your department will now have a role in<br />
advising the Minister for Resources, a sign that there was a problem<br />
with the way John Faulkner handled the process?<br />
PM: It is, rather, the process, I think. Look, what happens here is, there is<br />
the pressure from those interested in native forests in this country to<br />
transfer the state forestry problem to the Commonwealth. And, the<br />
device is export controls, which means Commonwealth ministers who<br />
don't run forestry departments then have to offer advice and take<br />
advice on which coupes are important in environmental terms and<br />
which are not. OK, it's not perfect, we live in a federation, there is a<br />
division of responsibilities, there is a lot of intransigence on forests,<br />
everybody does their best. But, better in the context of knowing where<br />
we are going. The policy has been about phasing out wood chipping<br />
in favour of downstream processing. If there isn't to be downstream<br />
processing, if there is to be simply a jamming up of those issues, then<br />
something has to change it. This is what is going to change it. We're<br />
simply going to reduce the volumes.<br />
J: But, you said that was always your policy, to take it down to zero by<br />
2000?<br />
PM: Well, I think it was first announced by Bob Hawke in the thing called,<br />
Building a Competitive Australia ( 12 March, 1991). And what he says<br />
is that it is the government's objective, in cooperation with the states,<br />
to phase out the export of woodchip by the year 2000 and soon<br />
thereafter be replaced by the manufacture of pulp and paper and other<br />
value added products for domestic use and export. And, then, later on<br />
we said at a Premiers' conference, " And after that, on a case by case<br />
basis."<br />
J: Mr Keating, were you surprised by the outcry that this decision<br />
triggered?<br />
PM: It's on every year, now. It's like a ritual, the incantations are starting<br />
while the paper is still shuffling. And, everybody's ready to do their<br />
best or their worst when it is published. Now, because these decisions<br />
were perceived to have cut across the interests of environmentalists,<br />
well, they've gone into as is their right, to make their case... </p>
<p>J: Do you think the government miscalculated the backlash?<br />
PM: I don't think the government has miscalculated anything at all, here.<br />
The problem here is the protagonists for, or the antagonists to logging,<br />
lack all influence with the states who run forest policy. Now, Bob<br />
Brown's up there talking about, ' What's the difference between this<br />
Prime Minister and a National Party figure?' He has no influence<br />
whatsoever, with Premiers Fahey, Kennett and Groom, who make the<br />
decisions, primarily, about forests. And that is the fact of it. All this<br />
huffing and puffing and incantations, when it comes to the cutting<br />
edge, he is useless except for running around the corridors here in<br />
Parliament House, Canberra. OK, the Commonwealth has a split<br />
responsibility, we will give further, definition to our part of that<br />
responsibility. But, in the end, the Commonwealth has some control<br />
over wood chipping but it has none whatsoever over saw log. If<br />
someone wants to fell a tree for saw log, it's entirely a matter for the<br />
states. So, what's he going to do down at Parliament House,<br />
Macquarie Street? Poke his tongue out outside St Stephens Church?<br />
I mean, do a little war dance in Spring Street? What is going to bring<br />
the State Premiers around to some influence other than banging out a<br />
press statement in the Canberra gallery? That's pretty easy.<br />
J: Don't you have to keep these people on side for the next election, Mr<br />
Keating?<br />
PM: Bob Brown is an opponent of ours. He's running for a seat in the<br />
senate.<br />
J: But, in terms of green preferences?<br />
PM: I don't want to keep him on side, I want to sideline him. Sideline him.<br />
J: Is this the best way to do it?<br />
PM: Well, it has generally been effective as a policy.<br />
J: What about your own caucus, Mr Keating, do you thinK this will stave<br />
off the proposed motion for the new year?<br />
PM: Oh well, there are caucus processes we all understand about, there is<br />
a bit of incantation going on there, too. That's true on most issues.<br />
J: Prime Minister, John Devereaux, accused you, yesterday, of conning<br />
the 43 backbenchers and two ministers who wrote to you urging the<br />
protection of high conservation areas. What is your response to that<br />
accusation?<br />
PM: I think John basically likes me, to be honest, and I like him. But, I'd<br />
prefer that he didn't take his obvious and conscientious interest in the </p>
<p>forests to the end of leaving the Labor caucus because this is where<br />
he can be most effective.<br />
J: But, did you give them the impression that...?<br />
PM: No, No. Because I was not involved in that process under the<br />
Cabinet's arrangements.<br />
J: Did your office give backbenchers that impression?<br />
PM: No.<br />
J: Well, that's a difference because they thought it was, " under control".<br />
PM: Well, that's what most people say when something comes out that they<br />
think isn't right, in their terms.<br />
J: Why shouldn't Mr Beddall take it, as a vote of no confidence in him,<br />
that you've had to change the process after his decision?<br />
PM: Well, I think he thinks that the process was fairly limited, too as to<br />
judgements about coupes and no, if you like, overall guideline as to<br />
volumes. That's now come in here.<br />
J: If you had any faith in him you wouldn't have to change the process?<br />
PM: Well, that's not right. Faith in him and the process are two different<br />
things.<br />
J: So, you have complete faith in him?<br />
PM: Well, there is no doubt that he exercised his responsibility in terms of<br />
that which he perceived to be his judgements, to be made about the<br />
imperatives of volumes versus the issues of environmental values.<br />
And, you can only do that on certain advice.<br />
J: But he didn't listen to advice, did he?<br />
PM: Well, you're only going over old ground, so...<br />
J: What stage of the process, Prime Minister, did you communicate your<br />
views to Mr Beddall and how did you put that to him?<br />
PM; Look, I have told you I communicated my views, and that is enough.<br />
J: With the benefit of hindsight would you have communicated your views<br />
to him, more strongly...? </p>
<p>.18<br />
PM: No, but in the end, what's come from this, but a very large change.<br />
Where is the news in this. The news I mean, let me go through my<br />
own little incantation the news is where the weight is, right, for those<br />
of you who didn't go through the appropriate formalities of training as<br />
journalists. The news is where the weight is, the weight is a policy<br />
change, here, that cuts the volumes down.<br />
J: You've talked about incentives, when and what sort?<br />
PM: I think when the industry comes back seriously and knows they're in a<br />
serious game, we can talk about in which way they might move<br />
towards plantations or regrowth. But, at the moment they think, if<br />
they've got a closing window, they'll go for the things of greatest value<br />
in the greatest quantity. And, I think they've got to know that a) the<br />
government does want the industry to keep going and b) that it is best<br />
on a sustainable basis, and if they get into regrowth and plantation<br />
we'll be of a mind to help them. But, nothing we can do, though, will<br />
transpose ourselves over the primary responsibility of the States for<br />
running forestry. And, this is in the division of responsibilities, under<br />
the Constitution, they are there. Now, we're into it because of our<br />
environmental interests and our export powers, our external affairs<br />
powers. But, they are in it, primarily on a function basis and that is<br />
going to be, always, the key determinant. Thank you.<br />
Ends. </p>
