FOR MEDIA 11 December 1985<br />
JOINT PRESS RELEASE BY THE PRIME MINISTER, MR HAWKE, AND THE<br />
MINISTER FOR TRANSPORT, MR MORRIS<br />
A comprehensive national road safety program to tackle the tragic<br />
death rate among young road users will start early next year.<br />
The Federal Government has adopted the program which is a<br />
four-pronged attack aimed at reducing death and injury among the<br />
nation's youth.-<br />
In its 1985/ 86 budget, my Government deemed young Australia to be<br />
" Priority One".<br />
In line with that principle and the philosophy behind<br />
International Youth Year, we'll be directing Australia's greatest<br />
road safety effort towards conserving our most important natural<br />
resource, our young people.<br />
My Government's existing road safety strategy, which is directed<br />
to all Australians, has made a substantial contribution to road<br />
safety improvements in recent years.<br />
We're developing better, safer roads through record funding<br />
levels, ensuring that cars are safe, and increasing research and<br />
public education activities by the Government's Federal office of<br />
Road Safety.<br />
It should be well known that road crashes are the biggest killer<br />
of young Australians.<br />
The 17 to 25 year old group represents only 15 per cent of the<br />
population, but makes up 37 per cent of all road crash<br />
fatalities. My Government will confront this national tragedy by<br />
concentrating on four key groups.<br />
A program aimed at young drivers will be sponsored by mobil Oil<br />
Australia with the Federal office of Road Safety.<br />
Mobil has taken up the challenge to industry I offered at last<br />
year's national road safety symposium, where I stressed the need<br />
for national co-operation and industry effort to fight the road<br />
toll.<br />
k -r VLT~ </p>
<p>4 2<br />
In accepting this challenge, Mobil will be working hand-in-hand<br />
with-' the Government to promote safer driving among young drivers.<br />
This innovative and exciting program of public sector and private<br />
enterprise co-operation will continue through to our Bicentenary<br />
year. Three other young road user groups motorcyclists, bicycle<br />
riders and young children would also be targets for substantial<br />
efforts. Young school children are particularly vulnerable.<br />
To improve their awareness of road safety in a way to which they<br />
can easily relate, activity books for children, along with guides<br />
for teachers and parents will be available for the start of the<br />
school year.<br />
Bicycle safety is particularly important for children and the<br />
whole question of bike safety and their place on the roads will<br />
be carefully covered.<br />
A three-day national bicycle safety conference Bikesafe 86<br />
will be held in Newcastle in April to get together interested<br />
people from government, industry, community and user groups.<br />
Supporting the conference aims will be a series of bike safety<br />
television advertisements, one of which will feature Ian ' Molly'<br />
Meldrum, to build on the tremendous popularity of the poster<br />
series promoting helmet wearing released this year by the Federal<br />
office of Road Safety.<br />
A series of films identifying key motorcyclists survival skills<br />
will be produced by the Federal office of Road Safety and<br />
distributed to motorcycle clubs, as a positive approach to an<br />
area of great concern for the Government.<br />
Inexperience is a major factor in road deaths among the young,<br />
whether it's as a car driver, a bike rider, or a youngster on<br />
their way to school.<br />
These programs have been developed to counter the inexperience of<br />
the young and reflect the importance placed by the Government in<br />
the future welfare of young Australians. </p>
