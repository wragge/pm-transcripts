BUDGET INITIATIVES IN<br />
MARINE SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY<br />
The Prime Minister, Mr Malcolm Fraser, commented tonight on<br />
initiatives which the Government had taken in the field of marine<br />
science and technology in the context of the 1979-80 Budget.<br />
Mr Fraser recalled that in his Parliamentary Statement of 4 June<br />
1979 concerning the Government's decisions on petroleum exploration<br />
in the Great Barrier Reef he had announced that the Australian<br />
Marine Sciences and Technologies Advisory Committee ( AMSTAC)<br />
had been asked to submit advice on a program of research on<br />
the Reef environment for consideration in the Budget context.<br />
AMSTAC, which is a Standing ComTmittee of the Australian Science<br />
and Technology Council has reported to the Government on such<br />
a program. The report will be tabled in the Parliament shortly.<br />
The Government had decided that $ 400,000 will be provided in<br />
1979-80 and the two succeeding financial years for grants in<br />
marine science and technology, of which $ 300,000 will be devoted<br />
to the Great Barrier Reef.<br />
The task of allocating these funds will be undertaken-by the<br />
Minister for Science and the Environment, Senator Webster, on<br />
the advice of the Marine Research Allocations Panel ( MARAP).<br />
The Prime Minister said that the membership of MARAP will be<br />
announced shortly.<br />
Mr Fraser went on to say that additional scientific staff<br />
positions with suitable support funding for 1979-80 and the<br />
two succeeding years would be provided at the Australian<br />
Institute of Marine Science ( AIMS) at Cape Ferguson, near<br />
Townsville with the specific objective of accelerating research<br />
on thle Barrier Reef.<br />
The Government had decided that this research should be directed<br />
to the study of environmental processes including physical,<br />
chemical and biological oceanography and reef population ecology.<br />
Mr Fraser recalled that the Australian Institute of Marine science<br />
had been set up in 1972 when he was Minister for Education and<br />
Science. / 2 N&gt; </p>

The Prime Minister went on to say that these important<br />
initiatives were a further step in the Government's commitment<br />
to undertake short and longer term research into the<br />
Great Barrier Reef which had been suggested by the Chairman of<br />
the Royal Commissions into Exploratory and Production Drilling<br />
for Petroleum.<br />
The Prime Minister said that in his agreement with the Premier<br />
of Queensland on 14 June 1979 it was noted that the research<br />
program on the Great Barrier Reef will be monitored by the<br />
Great Barrier Reef Ministerial Council and it will be closely<br />
supervised by the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority.<br />
Mr Fraser concluded by stating that the combination of<br />
co-operative arrangements with Queensland and funding of these<br />
new initiitives will ensure that the Government's strong<br />
commitment to the preservation of this most important part<br />
of Austr--alia will be effectively pursued.<br />
