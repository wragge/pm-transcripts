SPEECH BY THE PR;' Inr MINI6Trh OF AU6T_' nLIA, THE HON. E. G.<br />
WHITLAM, AT THE DINNEr GIVEN AT 8.00 PM<br />
WEDNESDAY 6 FEBRUARY 1974 BY U NE VIN, . WIPAN OF THE<br />
REVOLUTIONARY COUNCIL AND PRIME MINISTER OF THE<br />
SOCIALIST REPUBL1C OF THE UNION OF ] BURMA<br />
Although this is not my first visit to the<br />
Socialist Republic of the Union of Burma, I come here<br />
on this occasion as the first Australian Prime<br />
Minister to visit your country. In so doing, I<br />
acknowledge with gratitude the warm and generous<br />
welcome accorded to my wife and me, and to our<br />
party. We look forward, Mr Chairman, to welcoming<br />
you and your gracious wife to Australia. I hope<br />
these visits will serve as the basis for further<br />
fruitful development in the range and nature of the<br />
relationship between our two countries. I believe there<br />
are grounds for confidence that, because we now share<br />
more common interests than we did before, there will<br />
emerge a more intimate aid substantial relationship<br />
between Australia and Burma.<br />
For our part, we are seeking to chart a new<br />
course for Australia in its relations with the countries<br />
of Asia. By adopting a more independent Australian stance<br />
in international affairs, by striving to turn Australia<br />
away from a military orientation in its relations with<br />
South-East Asia and by trying to remove the stain of<br />
racialism from our policies, we hope to achieve for<br />
Australia a new standing as a distinctive, tolerant and<br />
co-operative nation, not only in Asia but in the world. </p>
<p>In support of these objectives we have shifted<br />
the emphasis of our continuing involvement in Asia,<br />
and especially in South-East Asia, from one dominated<br />
by ideological distincti(_ ns and military alliances to<br />
one based more on encouraging security through regional<br />
co-operation, on facilitating trade with our near<br />
neighbours on a mutually beneficial basis, and on<br />
promoting economic developnwnt through constructive<br />
aid pro,_-rams where these are wanted and where our own<br />
resources and skills can be usefully applied. We see<br />
a greater range of contacts through tourism,<br />
education and culture.<br />
Such contacts, we believe, will.. oontribute<br />
significantly to furthering our understanding of<br />
one another. I also believe that Ministerial and<br />
Parliamentary visits, like those exchanged recently<br />
between Australia and Burma, are of great value to<br />
both of us, and I would hope to see ouch visits<br />
extended. I stress that we do not seek to impose any<br />
unwanted culture or alien forms upon our friends. Nor<br />
do we seek to provide economic assistance where this<br />
is not welcome or useful1. While we deqire to live<br />
more intimately with Asia than we have in the past, we<br />
accept that in many ways the extent and nature of this<br />
new relationship is not ours alone to determine.<br />
Because we seek to retain our own freedom of choice and<br />
to develop our own independence and distinetiveriea,. vre<br />
appreciate the aspirations of othere to do the same, </p>
<p>In coming to Burma at this time I appreciate<br />
that you are in the middle of an election an historic<br />
election consequent upon the introduction of a new<br />
Constitution. I am aware that the introduction of the<br />
Constitution and the consultations with the people<br />
in the course of the drafting process represent the<br />
culmination of your long-held aspirations for the<br />
evolution of a form of government in Burma suited to the<br />
needs of the country and its people, arid'. that for more<br />
than two years it has impoised a heavy burden on you and<br />
your Ministers. I congratulate you on the successful<br />
outcome of the national referendum, on the Constitution<br />
held last December. In the sare month there was a<br />
Referendum in Australia on Constitutional changes, I may<br />
say, Sir, that I envy you in the success you achieved<br />
in your Referendum. I<br />
Australians have-long admired the way Burma<br />
has maintained its independence by its own efforts<br />
and by the skill, determination and spirit of sturdy<br />
self-reliance which have enabled you to negotiate your<br />
way through so many difficulties createdi by the<br />
interference of outside countries in the affairs of<br />
the region. We have noticed that in the United Naticns, and<br />
in other councils, Burma has spoken eloquently of its<br />
opposition to imperialism, colonialism, nuclear weapons<br />
testing, racial discrimination and apartheid.* You have<br />
stressed the fundamental importance and hcre I quote<br />
your distinguished Foreign Minister " of promoting the<br />
progressive establishmnent of and a universal respect for<br />
the role of law". These are all matters on which my<br />
Government, too, has deep convictions. They are matters<br />
in which my Government has taken important policy<br />
initiatives in the past year. </p>
<p>I believe Australia and Burma share a number<br />
of common objectives in ou immediate region. We seek<br />
to avoid destructive confrontations aLrl to b. ing about<br />
constructive co-operation. We hope to see evolve, in<br />
time, a truly regional community without ideological<br />
overtones and free of Great Power rivalries. We seek<br />
a durable peace in South-.. East Asia in partnership<br />
with other nations of the region. I understand the<br />
name " Rangoon" is derived from Burmese words meaning<br />
" end of strife". Our goal, indeed, is a South-<br />
East Asia free from strife. It will no doubt take<br />
time to achieve that goal and the rest of our common<br />
objectives in the region and elsewhere. In the meantime,<br />
however, I look to the consolidation of our bilateral<br />
relations, believing that such consolidation will<br />
bring us closer to the realisation of our wider goals<br />
and aspirations. I am happy to have your assurances of the<br />
useiulness of the Australian Aid Program in Burma.<br />
There will be an annual inarease in the size of that<br />
program. The Australian Government has pledged itself<br />
to increase the level of its financial development<br />
assistance to .7 per centof Gross Domestic Product by<br />
the end of the decade. We also intend to increase<br />
the percentage of our aid given through multilateral<br />
programs. Burma's developing relationship with the<br />
World Ba. ilc and the Asian Development Bank means that<br />
in this area also we will be able increasingly to<br />
contribut6 to Burma's programs for economic development. </p>
<p>I give these assurances in t Uhe full awareness<br />
that there will be ne-w claims on Aastralia2 especially<br />
from the emerging countries of the S3outh Pacific area,<br />
and that shortages of energy and r -Iourcos will raise<br />
uncertainties about the economic and financial future.<br />
Australia and Burma are both rich in natural resources.<br />
Burma is in the ha-, ppy position o-L hO. ving full<br />
national control over its resources. liy Government<br />
faces the urgent task of progressively resuming control<br />
over the development of Australia's mineral resources,<br />
a large part of which are now owned by foreign companies.<br />
At the same time we are developing policies for the<br />
balanced development of our resources and to control<br />
their sale in accordance with our national interests<br />
in a world where energy is scarce.<br />
Mr Chairman, I have deeply appreciated the<br />
frank and fruitful discussions we have had during my<br />
visit. I believe we have established that there are<br />
no problems between . our two countries, but rather<br />
that there are opportunities for growth and development<br />
in many aspects of our r.,; ationship. Especially I would<br />
hope to see positive development in the areas of trade,<br />
aid and cultural contacts.<br />
Australians have much to learn from the rich<br />
cultural and philosophical heritage that belongs to our<br />
near neighbours. By learning more about this heritage<br />
we will be better placed to gain from it, so that our<br />
perception of the needs and interests of these countries<br />
will be deepened and enlarged. My Government will do all<br />
it can to promote the flow of ideas and experience from<br />
the ancient civilisations of our neighbourhood. My visit<br />
to Burma so brief, yet so memorable will equip us<br />
better for that task. Thave had the opportunity to </p>
<p>6.<br />
hear your views and to explain our own. I shall leave<br />
with a better understanding of your policies, your<br />
culture and your people, confident that on the basis<br />
of this new understanding we will forge a rich,<br />
valuable and enduring friendship between our two<br />
countries. w A* * K </p>
