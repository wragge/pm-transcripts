FOR MEDIA 30 JUNE 1986<br />
As I indicated on 11 June 1986 in my Address to the Nation<br />
on the Economic Situation and the Supporting Statement, the<br />
Government is committed to reversing the growth trend in the<br />
Federal Public Service.<br />
While the Government believes that a good public service is<br />
essential to the well-being of our society, it is committed<br />
to ensuring that the public service becomes increasingly<br />
more efficient.<br />
As foreshadowed, we will be taking steps to streamline and<br />
rationalise existing functions and agencies to produce a<br />
leaner and more efficient public administration.<br />
Accordingly, over the next few weeks, the Government will be<br />
undertaking a detailed examination of functions and staffing<br />
levels across Federal administration.<br />
In the meantime there will be a freeze on staff numbers at<br />
their present levels.<br />
Consistent with the Government's philosophy there will be<br />
consultations with relevant representative staff<br />
organisations as necessary. </p>
