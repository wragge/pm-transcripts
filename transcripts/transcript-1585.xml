RANSORIPT OF * 1R 4SS CONFE3RENCE BY THE DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER AN'D<br />
MINISTER-FOR TAEADIUTR( * A'SD p<br />
133 JUN 1967<br />
Question: Mr. Mci~ wen has emerged as something of a hero after the<br />
recent Kennedy Round talks, yet Australia was forced to<br />
accept a rather reduced price in wheat than she was<br />
negotiating for, how does this work out?<br />
Answer: Well, the answer is quite simple. What I was talking<br />
about before I went was the price that we would<br />
receive for our wheat. What we were arguing about in<br />
Geneva was the minimum price below which we would not<br />
sell our wheat nor below which anyone would ask to buy<br />
our wheat. What we did in the finish was to reach an<br />
agreement, which is technical in certain aspects. The<br />
end result is that the minimum price now is 19 American<br />
cents higher than the minimum price of the previous<br />
prevailing agreement. This itself, is a very big<br />
improvement. Raising the minimum price doesn't mean<br />
that you sell at that price. It means that you don't<br />
ever sell below that price and no one seeks to buy below<br />
that price. All the experts in Geneva believe that<br />
raising this minimum will raise the actual average<br />
market price. It will fluctuate, but the estimate<br />
there between all the experts is that it will raise the<br />
average market price, above that prevailing now, by<br />
from 8 cents some say, 16 cents others say, up to<br />
cents. If wie are going to get our minimum, that<br />
is 19 cents above the price which previously prevailed,<br />
and a market price that, if you take the<br />
average of these estimates, would be 12 cents above<br />
that which is currently ranging, then this is an<br />
enormous increase. Last year we harvested a crop of<br />
about 460 million bushels of wheat and will export<br />
nearly 370 million bushels. But on a 300 million<br />
bushel export, every cent that you increase your<br />
return is worth $ US 3 million to Australia. So if the<br />
average price increase turns out, as the experts<br />
estimate it to be, 12 cents above the present prevailing<br />
price, that would be, on that calculation,<br />
$ US3 36 million a year for Australia. If anyone<br />
can satisfy themselves that that is a defeat then </p>
<p>he is a difficult fellow to argue with.<br />
Questi on:<br />
An sw er:<br />
Quest-ion,;<br />
Answer:<br />
Question:<br />
Answer: Mr. McEwen, pushing this a bit further, with millions<br />
of people starving, is it right and good for the world<br />
that the price of wheat should be increased?<br />
Well the real point is that you can't produce wheat<br />
in the wheat-producing countries and sell it to the<br />
affluent countries at a figure that is related only<br />
to the price which starving people can pay because<br />
taking it literally, starving people can't pay<br />
anything and they don't pay anything for much of their<br />
wheat which is given to them. So what we have done<br />
now is to arrange that the commercial transactions of<br />
wheat will be at a price satisfactory to Australia.<br />
An argument that I first introduced more than<br />
years ago is now accepted. That is, for those<br />
people to whom wheat must be given, the responsibility<br />
should not only be with those countries which grow<br />
wheat in surplies to their own requirements, but that<br />
all the affluent countries of the world should<br />
contribute either in wheat or in money to buy wheat<br />
and this is now part of the wheat scheme.<br />
On the European Common Market, Mr. McEwen, which of<br />
the primary producers are going to come off worst in<br />
Australia when Britain joins.<br />
Well, you say when Britain joins. I think it would be<br />
better if you said if Britain joins. I can't answer<br />
that until I know the terms on which Britain joins<br />
if she does join. Britain has said bravely that she<br />
will not join unless she can defend the vital interests<br />
of the Commonwealth countries and that is a very<br />
heartening statement; but it is a very broad<br />
indefinite statement. I can't answer your question.<br />
Mr. McEwen, it has been said in some quarters that the<br />
real result of this agreement will be merely that the<br />
rich get rich and the poor get poorer. How confident<br />
are you that the Kennedy Round will fulfil its aim<br />
to boost all world trade and not just benefit the big.<br />
trading nations.<br />
I would like to feel that you didn't invent that<br />
because I have never heard anyone say this. </p>
<p>Question: Answer: Question:<br />
Answer: Question:<br />
Answer: Questi on: This was reported in Italy, Sir<br />
It's a long way away, Ilve never heard of it. I don't<br />
believe it's true. I dont think anyone responsible<br />
has said it, but the truth of the matter is that none<br />
of the poor countries has been required to accept any<br />
obligations for the benefits it will receive under the<br />
Kennedy Round discussions. If all the rich countries<br />
were to do what Australia has done give special lowtariff<br />
entry for certain products of the underdeveloped<br />
countries they would get a tremendous<br />
boost.<br />
Well Sir, all reportage to date on the Kennedy Round has<br />
been particularly vague on what Australia has agreed to.<br />
There has been some mention admittedly of Australia<br />
excluding herself from some of the tariff cutting<br />
agreements. i-n-what fields are we committed to tariff<br />
cuts, and briefly, in what fields are we excluded.<br />
Well you haven't been reading what I have been saying.<br />
What I have said is that three years ago from now I got<br />
Australia excluded from the linear cuts on tariffs. I<br />
said whatever benefits we turned out to get in the end<br />
we would pay for. That has been accepted, not three<br />
years ago but four years ago, and we liva up to it.<br />
No, but in what fields sir?<br />
In the fields where we can give tariff cuts without<br />
impairing the protection to Australian manufacturing<br />
Industry. What I was getting at Sir, was, what particular fields<br />
in manufacturing have been submitted to these tariff<br />
cuts and in which ones are we remaining protective?<br />
The answer I just gave you was that no fields of Australian<br />
manufacturing industry which are protected<br />
have had any essential tariff protection reduction at<br />
all. There are a number of imports that carry tariff<br />
duties which are not protecting Australian industry;<br />
it is in this case that duties will be reduced.<br />
Well as the major markets in Europe and North America<br />
are reducing their tariffs by one third on industrial<br />
goods, will this help our manufacturers in any way?<br />
For example, can we sell them Holdens without buying<br />
Toyotas or in fact do these manufacturers miss out<br />
because of our own exclusion? </p>
<p>Answer: I don't follow the question at all.<br />
Question: Well what I was driv-ing at Sir, is will this<br />
agreement by North America and Europe to cut their<br />
tariffs by one third help our industries in any way?<br />
Wlnswer,: Well, we have a modest export of manufactured goods.<br />
I think about œ 150 or œ 200 million worth of goods<br />
have been exported and to the extent that these items<br />
will now have lower tariff barriers to get over in<br />
some countries and we actually export some<br />
manufactured goods to Europe we would be helped.<br />
Question: Is there any outcome yet, Sir, on the discussions that<br />
were being held on meat? Is Australia likely to<br />
increase her share of the meat market?<br />
Answer,: Yes, it is but these discussions are not yet complete.<br />
The position is that America has had to have her<br />
discussions completed by now, that has been done. The<br />
other countries are not under exactly the same<br />
pressure of time and we are still in the late stages of<br />
some discussions about meat, particularly with the<br />
European Common Market and Japan. I have complete<br />
confidence that in each case there will be a<br />
satisfactory outcome for Australia.<br />
uestin: What about agreement relates to hard<br />
winter wheat whereas Australian wheat, of course, is<br />
soft. Do you expect our market price to rise as a<br />
follow through to this agreement?<br />
Answer: Yes. The position is that the price is not to be read<br />
as the price at which we will sell our wheat. This is<br />
the price below which we will not sell our wheat nor<br />
anyone seek to buy our wheat. It is a floor. This<br />
floor compared with the hard winter wheat that you<br />
refer to is 19 American cents higher than the<br />
previous prevailing floor price for that quality of<br />
wheat. That is a very, verj substantial increase.<br />
The estimates of the experts, both of the importing<br />
countries and the wheat selling countries at Geneva<br />
was that this higher floor price would raise the<br />
current average actual market selling price by,<br />
according to different experts, from 8 cents a<br />
bushel to 15 or 20 cents a bushel. I take a figure<br />
of an average of 12 cents a bu3hel increase, which on </p>
<p>Question: Answer: Question,: Answ er: a 300 million bushel export would give us an<br />
additional income in wheat of $ US 36 million a year.<br />
On this question of wheat or grain. On the food aid<br />
programme giving 4-21 million tons of grain free a year<br />
to hungry countries, how is this going to be financed<br />
and what is Australia's share in it?<br />
Australia's share is 225,000 tons a year. In the last<br />
three years we have, without any agreement at all, given<br />
150,000 tons a year. So our record is pretty straight.<br />
It is going to be financed by a country like Australia<br />
contributing in wheat which the Government will lbuy<br />
from the Wheat Board 5C/ o of the 41-million tons.<br />
Other countries that have wheat will give their share<br />
in wheat and other countries such as Japan which haven't<br />
any wheat to give away will provide the money and they<br />
will buy the wheat to give it away.<br />
Well,, going, across to the Common Mvarket problem now<br />
Mr. McEwen. H-ow do you rate Britain's chances of<br />
entering the Common Market? If she does, how * i&amp; ng do<br />
you think it will take?<br />
I don't really feel confident to form an assessment of<br />
her chances of getting in. Tn-ere is not the slightest<br />
doubt that Mr. Adilson has made it very clear that<br />
Britain is going to make a determined effort to get in<br />
and there is not going to be niggily about the<br />
conditions. I hear people in Europe who are knowledgable<br />
on this say that well, it would take at least six<br />
months before it was clear whether this was a real<br />
goer and perhaps a couple of years before a decision<br />
is reached. That's not my opinion, it is the<br />
opinion of others, / 64 a. </p>
<p>question: Answer: Quest ion:<br />
Answer: Answer: Britain's Foreign Secretary, Mr. Brown, has been<br />
quoted as saying that Britain's application<br />
contains no conditions or stipulations. In the<br />
light of' this how serious are our key exports to<br />
Britain likely to be affected?<br />
I don't know what Mr. Brown says. If You quote<br />
him correctly and I don't doubt that at all<br />
it would not be consistent with what Mr. Wilson has<br />
said. He has said that in entering the Comnmon<br />
Ma,-rket, Britain would require that essential<br />
Commonwealth interests should be safeguarded.<br />
Along this line, the Cha. irman of the Aastralian<br />
Dairy Produce Board said this week that it would be<br />
impossible for Australia to find an immediate<br />
replacement market for her dairy products if<br />
Britain's entry into the E. E. C. was swift.<br />
This is completely right. There is only one big<br />
importer of butter in the world and that is Britain.<br />
If Britain's entry into the E. E. C. it impossible<br />
for her to buy our butter in the quantity she has<br />
been buying it, then frankly I don't know where<br />
else we could turn to find a market for butter. The<br />
problem with cheese and dried milk and other dairy<br />
products is not so bad. The truth of the matter is<br />
that you can't make dried skim milk powder without<br />
producing butter.<br />
Well, what practical steps have been, or are going to<br />
be taken in any way to protect these export industries<br />
by the Government.<br />
Well, just by trying to diversify our markets which<br />
I have been engaged in for years now, by stressing to<br />
Britain and to the European Common Market, the practical<br />
problems of the Australian dairy industry; and New<br />
Zealanders are doing it, of course, because they would<br />
be more desparately affected than even we would'be. / 7 </p>
<p>GENERAL PRESS CONFERENCE<br />
Question: How long before the tariff cu~ ts come into effect?<br />
Answer: When the various Governments ratify the agreements<br />
and sulfLicient Governments have ratified it for it to<br />
be quite clear that the agreement is going to live.<br />
Question: Would you put a point of time on it? Would it be a<br />
year or so?<br />
Answer: I couldn't guess. I would hope it would be a shorter<br />
time than that. Can I point ou~ t something so that<br />
this is understandable. There are two instances in<br />
history of this kind of thing where an agreement has<br />
been reached. First the League of Nations after the<br />
First World War. America agreed and then the American<br />
Congress threw it ou~ t and they were never in it. More<br />
recently in 1947, the A~ mericans convened a great trade<br />
conference from which was established an international<br />
world organisation which, for example, oa~ r Government<br />
said we would join as soon as itmerica and Britain<br />
joined. America never joined it and America not joining<br />
the organisation which they had proposed, no one else<br />
joined it and it never came into existence. That<br />
illustrates that when you reach an agreement, it isn't<br />
automatically in existence but I would mislead you<br />
completely if I led any of you to construe from this<br />
that I think that could happen on this occasion. I<br />
state it in relation to a timetable only. Is that<br />
clear?<br />
-Question; Mr. McEwen, what influence would the Kennedy Round<br />
Agreement have on the British Commonwealth trade talks<br />
that you are going to come u~ p with.<br />
Answer: It will have a quite substantial influence on it. The<br />
United Kingdom/ Auastralia Trade Agreem/' nt, which is<br />
the technical description of the system of preferences,<br />
is an agreement designed to give a balance of advantage<br />
to both countries. Now when the Keniedy Round was </p>
<p>first mooted there was a conference of Commonwealth<br />
trade ministers in which I, speaking for my Government,<br />
said that wve wculd prefer to stay with the known<br />
the preferential reciprocal arrangement with Britain<br />
rather than go into a Kennedy Round. The British<br />
Government of the day said well, we have decided that<br />
we will go into the Kennedy Round and we will go in<br />
and offer tariff cuts. We said right'o, we'll take<br />
it from there. What this meant, and this is the<br />
answer to your question, is that on going into the<br />
Kennedy Round the British offered to cut nearly all<br />
of their tariffs by 50%. Giving us a preference means<br />
that they have a tariff on somebody else where they<br />
don't have one at all on us, and offering to cut<br />
their tariffs by 50%, they were in fact offering to<br />
cut our preferences by 50 o. Now, in the course of<br />
the negotiations they went through with a cut of<br />
on many items and withdrew and didn't go through with<br />
the cut on other items. SoI said at that time, which is<br />
now about five years ago, well, when the KEonnedy<br />
Round is finished we'll get together then and have a<br />
look at what would represent an agreement which<br />
would have a balance of advantage for both parties.<br />
I have now reached agreement with the British in<br />
London that as soon as the Kennedy Round is over,<br />
and it is now over, our officials will start to<br />
examine the change in trade relationship. They<br />
will be doing this within a month or two months.<br />
As soon as that study has gone on sufficiently, then<br />
no doubt the Governments and Ministers will, get<br />
to-gether and have a look at it. It would be the<br />
objective of Australia and the objective. of Britain<br />
to write another trade treaty which, having regard to<br />
what had been altered, established a trading<br />
relationship which had a balancing advantage to<br />
both parties.<br />
Question: Mr. McEwen, I would have thought that you could'nt<br />
have a floor price for wheat unless you had some<br />
know quantities of wheat involved.<br />
Answer: No, that's not so.<br />
Question: You can have a price without worrying about quantities?<br />
Answer: Well, you can worry about quantity but nature, more<br />
than anything else, determines the quantity. You<br />
really can't commit yourself to a quantity. The<br />
concept here is that, in relation to transactions </p>
<p>Question:<br />
Answer:<br />
Answer: Question:<br />
Answer: Question:<br />
Answer. Question., in wheat between countries which are parties to the<br />
agreement, no one will be willing to sell at less<br />
than the floor price and no one will seek to buy at<br />
less than the floor price.<br />
If you have a glut then how are you going to maintain<br />
it? Isn't someone going to go out the back door?<br />
Isn't someone going to break the agreement, because<br />
that's really what your suggesting; I don't mean<br />
you are proposing it, but it would only not stand up<br />
if someone did break the agreement. Wheat is not<br />
like chocolate, if I could make a comparison.<br />
Excepting the very hungry people, most people don't<br />
eat more wheat because it is a little cheaper. They<br />
do eat more mieat and they may eat more butter,<br />
they certainly eat more chocolate if it is cheaper;<br />
but the whole trading history shows that the price<br />
of' wheat has very little relationship to the<br />
consumption amongst those who have the capacity<br />
to buy wheat.<br />
Will this price be reviewed from time to time?<br />
Yes, it can be reviewed from time to time.<br />
Under some sort of Kennedy umbrella or under G. A. T. T.?<br />
Well the whole Kennedy Round is part of G. A. T. T.,<br />
it is conducted under the G. A. T. T. and at some period<br />
of time it will be reviewed. If a great surplus<br />
developed without this agreement then obviously price<br />
cutting would commence and the whole benefit of the<br />
agreement is to have a lot of countries committed by<br />
contractual obligations not to engage in price cutting<br />
or not to attempt to induce others to engage in price<br />
cutting. The tariff cuts.,. will they affect cars?<br />
No. No. I want to emphasize that there will be no<br />
tariff reductions here on items which are necessary<br />
to protect Australian industry. Wie have our g; roat<br />
motor car manufacturing industry; our tariff is<br />
designed to protect it. This w. 1as the fight I<br />
won in 1963 where I got Australia excluded. The<br />
only three countries excluded from the obligations<br />
to make linear tariff cuts were Australia, New<br />
Zealand and South Africa.<br />
Mr. McEwen, the wheat aid, is to be held somehow or<br />
other by this international -pool, just to be given </p>
<p>11.<br />
Answer. Question:<br />
Answer. Question:<br />
Answer for emergencies, or cavn vie use it as capital aid?<br />
Wie have used wheat as capital aid in the past,<br />
havn't we?<br />
We never have<br />
say India they raise capital with it locally.<br />
. ell, let me see if I can answer the question.<br />
Thffen we have given wheat we have never a'utached any<br />
condition to it at all. If asked for wheat vie have<br />
given it to them finish and they no doubt ive<br />
it out to those who need it. On the other hand some<br />
countries and America is a great example when<br />
America gives wheat aid what she does is to sell the<br />
wheat at a price but for payment in the currency of'<br />
the country, the currency of India in that particular<br />
case, Its a cLu-rrency that's understood that can't<br />
be converted to dollars or sterling. So the United<br />
States, under Its ublic Law 480 sells the wheat to<br />
India. It's not going to receive payment in America,<br />
but it will receive or be due for payment in India.<br />
Then the kAmericans may attach a condition. They may<br />
say the understanding is that you iill use some of<br />
this money to build an irrigation dam or they may<br />
say we will draw some of this money to pay for the<br />
expenses of our Embassy. If they say well, you<br />
must use some of the money that you are due to pay<br />
us to build an irrigation dam, well, that's capital<br />
aid, In all the aid that we give, whether we give<br />
money or tractors or technical assistance, or food, we<br />
give it and rule off the book. . ie attach no<br />
conditions, no repayment.<br />
Mr. Mc~ ven what reasons do the Americans give for<br />
imposing their duty on wool?<br />
On wool? Well, the reason they advance is that they<br />
have a woollen industry of their own and they must<br />
protect it, and that is the simple reason. There are<br />
related reasons which may be at least as important<br />
and maybe more important and this is, that under<br />
their law they have a certain relationship between<br />
the protective duty on raw wool and the protective<br />
duty on imported woollen textile piecegoods or<br />
garments and under the existing law to alter one<br />
automatically alters the other and this might<br />
be the milk in the coconut. </p>
<p>Quesion: Speaking about the Common Market, a while ago you<br />
seem to stress the word Is there an even<br />
money chance that Britain will get in?<br />
Answer; W~ ell, talking to the people that I met in Geneva.<br />
and they were a pretty well-informed group of<br />
people on this I don't think you wiould have got<br />
a bet at much better than even money and that's not<br />
my opinion. You askfl me my opinion and I just say<br />
I'm sorry I don't know. President De Gaulle's<br />
press interview wasn't very encouraging but our<br />
Australian Government's attitude is quite olear.<br />
If the British Government feels that it is in<br />
the important interests of Britain to join the<br />
Common Market, then wie would regard it as quite<br />
improper for us to try, directly or indirectly,<br />
to prevent her from joining. This is in balance<br />
with our resentment if anyone tried to interfere<br />
with what we thought was a necessary policy in the<br />
interests of Australia. Having made that principle<br />
clear, then it's legitimate to point out where your<br />
owm interests are and say to someone who said<br />
I will look after your interests, to say well,<br />
here, this is what our interests are.<br />
Question Do you see any benefits to us if Britain enters the<br />
Common Market?<br />
Answer, I think there is only one benefit which has been<br />
canvassed and I can't evaluate it, and that is that<br />
it will be good for the strength of the British<br />
economy I'm not offering my view now, I'm<br />
quoting that it will be good for the strength<br />
of the British economy and for the prosperity of<br />
Britain if she joins and that therefore as a<br />
country which is a trading partner, it must be good<br />
for us if she becomes stronger. I can't evaluate<br />
that at all.<br />
Question: , Phat is our position in respect of butter?<br />
Answer: Our position in respect of butter with Britain has been<br />
that we had a preference of 15/-a cwt. over' nonpreferential<br />
supplies. Notwiithstandinig that, two<br />
or three years ago the price was extremely low.<br />
This was not only hurting us it was hurting the<br />
British Government who had to bridge the ap from the<br />
Treasury between the market price and the guaranteed </p>
<p>S 13.<br />
Question: Answer: Question:<br />
An-swer: price to their own producers and this was<br />
becoming very costly. From this they suggested<br />
and we agreed, that instead of the duty to protect<br />
us, to give us preference, that they should<br />
introduce a system of quotas to prevent an excess<br />
of butter and therefore lift the price. We agreed<br />
to this, New Zealand agreed to this. It was put<br />
into operation. It did lift the price. N~ ow that<br />
has not been an issue under discussion in the<br />
Kennedy Round, therefore butter in our principal<br />
market has not been affected one way or another<br />
by the Kennedy Round, and it has'nt in respect of<br />
the E. E. C.<br />
Mr. McEwen<br />
Just let rme add a sentence to this. We have a wheat<br />
agreement. ? 7e -had hoped not only Australia,<br />
but all those interested we had hoped to have<br />
a dairy agreement. The Kennedy Round set up a group<br />
to study dairy products in the direction of a world<br />
agreement. It was discovered that there was. no* V'<br />
hope of an agreement and that just dissolved.<br />
11r. MoEw-en, in London you viere quoted as saying that<br />
Britain's decision to seek entry into the Common<br />
Market meant that she was obliged in the Kennedy<br />
Round to press for world commodity agreements that<br />
safeguarded Australia's agricultural exports. Did<br />
Britain press for that?<br />
Well, can I just state the position. W1hen Britain first<br />
contemplated joining the Common THarket I think<br />
this was 1961/ 62 there were discussions between<br />
Britain and the Common Market countries before Britain<br />
had applied, where Britain pointed out how her<br />
joining would have repercussions on Commonwealth<br />
countries and other trading partners unless spegial<br />
provisions were made to cover them. Out of those<br />
studies the conclusion reached was that if Britain<br />
joined the Common Market, the best way to protect<br />
the interests of these people, which include Australia,<br />
would be not to deprive them of their preferences<br />
overnight, but to phase them out over a period of<br />
years and this was one proposal. The other<br />
proposal was that in respect of items such as </p>
<p>14.<br />
wheat, where no preference exists, world agreements<br />
were the best solution of the problems of these<br />
countries. Britain subscribed to that and Britain<br />
has said that she will protect the interests of<br />
Commonwealth countries. So it was against that<br />
background that I said from Geneva that Britain<br />
was more obligated than any other country to support<br />
world commodity agreements because she had agreed<br />
that this was the most direct way of protecting<br />
the interests of countries which might be impaired<br />
by her joining the Common Market. I also said that<br />
a meeting of Commonwealth Trade Ministers in June<br />
last year had again confirmed as the general<br />
poliQy the whole Commonwealth including Britain,<br />
support for world commodity agreements which would<br />
give satisfactory prices. So you can see there the<br />
grounds on which I said Britain was obligated<br />
and more obligated than any other country to support<br />
them. Well, she supported this agreement she's a<br />
member of it did start out by suggesting<br />
a price of about 160 cents for wheat.<br />
Question: Mr. IMIcEwen, was it agreed at all at the Kennedy<br />
Round whether the wheat price would come up for<br />
any periodic review or discussions?<br />
Answer: The period for reviewing the price that we discussed was<br />
three years. iIy memory won't permit me to say whether<br />
this is written into the final understanding<br />
it's just a slip of my memory. They contemplated<br />
three years and I think it will probably turn out<br />
that this is the point of review.<br />
Question. Mr. Mc-hven, would it be possible to say whether<br />
the talks with Britain over the trade agreement will<br />
come up this year or in a matter of weeks?<br />
Answer6 Well, what I have said is that talks between officials<br />
will comrence in the quite near future. I would think<br />
within a couple of months talks bet-ween their officials<br />
and our officials will commence. They will be<br />
studying what has happened within the Kennedy Round<br />
and outside the Kennedy Round to change our trading<br />
relationship. Their reports will go to higher<br />
officials and their reports will go to Governments<br />
and so on and I expect before we reach the end of </p>
<p>1<br />
Question:<br />
Answer: Question:<br />
Answer,-Question:<br />
Answer: this year the picture will be clear enough to warrant<br />
the Governments getting together. That's my<br />
estimate of time.<br />
Was sugar raised at all?<br />
No, sugar was not raised at all, on the ground that<br />
there has been an International Sugar Agreement which<br />
is in suspension; that the International Sugar<br />
Council is still functioning and that the overwhelming<br />
percentage of the countries which export sugar are<br />
less developed countries and the venue to which the<br />
less developed countries are looking for trade<br />
discussions is not the G. A. T. T. but UNCTAD United<br />
Nations Conference on Trade and Development and<br />
there has been one or two ministerial meetings on<br />
sugar in UICTAD and there will be another ministerial<br />
meeting on sugar. It is expected well inside a year<br />
from now. The exporters of sugar who are not to be<br />
classified as developing countries would be such<br />
countries as Australia and South Africa. All of the<br />
others, the est Indies, India, Mauritius, Fiji<br />
a colony, of course are all developing countries and<br />
I think they would resist the discussion being removed<br />
from UNCTAD.<br />
Mr. McEwen, on the Conon Market, has the Australian<br />
Government been kept fully informed on the British<br />
application? Is there any arrangement whereby we<br />
will be told what is going on in the negotiations.<br />
Yes, the British Government has told us privately<br />
and stated the same thing publicly that as they get<br />
into negotiation, they will keep us informed and<br />
consult closely with us.<br />
Mr. -cEwient, o use an Australianism, do you think<br />
they are " fair dinkum"?<br />
Of course I've got to take the British Government's<br />
statement as bona fide. On the meat side, I have<br />
said in this written press statement that apart from<br />
wheat, this is the big area of gain to us. We've<br />
secured, in the very final stages, a reaction from te<br />
Common Market countries to a request that we have been<br />
pressing, that vie have access to their markets for<br />
our frozen meat on better terms than have existed<br />
and better terms than they were proposing. The<br />
relationship between the Argentine and Australia and<br />
the Common Market countries is not bound to the </p>
<p>16.<br />
same timetable as the American. I mention the<br />
Argentine with Australia because wie, with the<br />
New Zealanders, are the principal suppliers of<br />
meat. So when I left Geneva to go to Romania<br />
these discus-' ions hadn't been completed in detail.<br />
I have been travelling, I think they are completed<br />
now but I'm not qaite sure, but my written statement<br />
says I am confident of the outcome. Now that's in<br />
that area. The other next important meat market<br />
for us is Japan. Again we are not under the same<br />
pressure of timetable as with America and again I've<br />
got to say words that sound unsatisfactory<br />
I'm confident of a good outcome. That isn't just<br />
double talk, I am just confident that there will be a<br />
satisfLactory final position with both Japan and the<br />
Common Market countries. The importance of this is<br />
that we have only had two really assured markets for<br />
meat 13ritain and the United States and if you<br />
get a difficult marketing situation in one or both<br />
of those countries if you get it in one, you're<br />
trying to force all your meat into the other<br />
remaining market and this is always embarrassing<br />
to the country that's under pressure to receive it.<br />
If we can look forward to say four important<br />
markets, then the meat trade is a lot safer than if you<br />
have only two.<br />
Que-stion: Do you envisage any new markets for meat?<br />
Answer: Oh yes, wie are keeping on pressing, We have developed<br />
a quite good market for sheep meat in Greece, </p>
