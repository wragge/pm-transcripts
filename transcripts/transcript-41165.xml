    <content><![CDATA[<p>This week the Prime Minister will travel to Apia, Samoa to meet with regional leaders at the annual Pacific Islands Forum.</p>
<p>The PIF is the only forum which gathers all Pacific leaders in one place. Strong regional cooperation with our neighbours is vital to our shared stability, security and prosperity.</p>
<p>Our increased engagement in the Pacific is a long-term commitment reliant on stronger partnerships to deliver economic growth and resilience, enhanced security cooperation and closer relationships between our people.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister is delivering on his commitment to ‘step-up’ Australia’s engagement in the Pacific.</p>
<p>This important forum provides an opportunity to strengthen our partnerships with Pacific neighbours. The Prime Minister will announce a series of economic, security and people-to-people initiatives to deliver on Australia’s commitment to the Pacific.</p>
<p>Hosted by Prime Minister Tuilaepa Lupesoliai Sailele Malielegaoi, the forum will also be an opportunity for leaders to discuss ocean management, climate change, maritime security and fisheries, guided by the forum theme of Blue Pacific.</p>
<p>This will be the Prime Minister’s first official visit to Samoa and will help to fortify our greater engagement across the Pacific region. He will be accompanied by Senator Fierravanti-Wells, the Minister for International Development and the Pacific.</p>
