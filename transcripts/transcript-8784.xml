PRIME MINISTER 2/ 93<br />
STATEMENT BY TIE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON PJ. KEATING, MP<br />
APEC EMINENT PERSONS GROUP<br />
I am pleased to announce the Australian Government's nomination of the Hon<br />
. Ncyillc Wran AC QC as Australia's participant in the Eminent Persons -Group<br />
( EPO) to be cstablished this year as part of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation<br />
( APEC) process.<br />
The EPG, an Australian initiative, was endorsed at the September 1992 APEC<br />
Ministerial Meeting in Bangkok. It will have as its main task consideration of a<br />
longer-term vision for APEC to the year 2000. In doing so, it will focus on ways<br />
to advance the APEC region's development through strengthened trade, investment<br />
and other linkages. The EPG will also identify constraints and issues which APEC<br />
Governments should address in order to build on tile remarkable economic<br />
dynamism of the region.<br />
Mr Wran is a most distinguished Australian who is well placed to contribute to the<br />
work of the EPG through his wide experience at the highest levels of government<br />
and business. As former Chairman of the CSIRO, Mr Wran also has a keen<br />
understanding of what Australia has to offer the region in the scientific and<br />
technological area.<br />
Mr Wran's involvement in the EPG is a further step in Australia's support for the<br />
APEC process, which is now accepted in the Asia-Pacific region as an essential<br />
mechanism for promoting open regionalism and regional trade liberalisation.<br />
APEC began from an Australian initiative in 1989. Its membership comprises<br />
fifteen key economies of the Asia-Pacifietegion and embraces the main economic </p>
<p>linkages the countries of North America and the Western Pacific. The APEC<br />
region now accounts for nearly 74 per cent of Australia's total exports and the bulk<br />
of our future trade growth is cxpected to he with these economies.<br />
In parallel with our fundamental interest in the maintenance of an open and nondiscriminatory<br />
multi-lateral trading system, APEC is thc central component of<br />
Australia's trade strategy at the regional level. The Govcrnment is committed to<br />
cooperate with other APEC members in identifying practical steps to promote<br />
regional trade and investment.<br />
The EPO will have an important role to play in this process. It will begin its work<br />
early this year and report to the next APEC Ministerial meeting in late 1993 in the<br />
United States. Other APEC members are currently formalising their nominations<br />
to thc EPG. The group is expected to comprise about twelve distinguished<br />
individuals with backgrounds in government, business and academia.<br />
