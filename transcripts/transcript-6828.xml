FOR MEDIA 31 January 1986<br />
The Prime Minister of the Republic of Korea, Mr Lho Shin-yong,<br />
is to Visit Australia from 6 to 10 March at the invitation of<br />
the Australian Government.<br />
Mr Lho will be accompanied by his wife and also by the Vice<br />
Minister of Foreign Affairs and a party of officials.<br />
The Australian Government places importance on maintaining and<br />
further developing the relationship between Australia and the<br />
Republic of Korea. Mr Lho's visit will provide an opportunity<br />
to continue the useful and broad-ranging discussion which I<br />
had during my visit to the Republic of Korea in February 1984<br />
and will also provide an opportunity for Australia to return<br />
the kind hospitality extended to me and my wife at that time<br />
by President Chun Doo-whan and the people of the Republic of<br />
Korea.<br />
Australia and the Republic of Korea share an important trading<br />
relationship which is both mutually beneficial and increasing<br />
in size. Both bilateral and international economic issues will<br />
be areas for discussion between Mr Lho and myself as well as<br />
international political issues.<br />
Mr Lho is expected to visit Sydney and Canberra during his<br />
stay in Australia. The details of his program are now being<br />
developed in consultation with the Government of the Republic<br />
of Korea. </p>
