Prime Minister Julia Gillard and Queensland Premier Anna Bligh today announced a $39 million package to support the recovery and wellbeing of people in Queensland following the State's worst-ever summer of natural disasters in recent memory.</p>
<p>The package was launched under the Natural Disaster Relief and Recovery Arrangements in Queensland today to assist communities to confront the challenges associated with long-term recovery.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister said the support will help Queenslanders confront the long-term challenges of the recovery process that go beyond bricks and mortar.</p>
<p>The package includes:</p>
<p> * 	$20 million for community development and recovery funds on the ground to provide intensive support to the State's most highly impacted local communities, including supporting not-for-profit community groups, events and memorials;<br />
 * 	Up to $10 million for a Mental Health Disaster Recovery Package to support mental health services in disaster-affected communities in Queensland on top of $1.2 million in funding announced earlier this year. Local organisations on the ground within the mental health sector will receive much needed funding to bolster their excellent work within severely affected communities.<br />
 * 	Up to $5.8 million Financial Counselling to provide support to families and individuals affected by the disasters who are experiencing financial problems.<br />
 * 	A $2 million Disabilities Care Plan to help a number of non-government organisations across Queensland to deliver crisis accommodation and respite care for people with a disability.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister said today's Community Recovery Package announcement was the next step in supporting Queensland following the recovery and the start of reconstruction efforts.</p>
<p>The Gillard Government will not forget the Queensland people who have been affected by the recent floods.</p>
<p>We are here to help you rebuild your homes, your workplaces, your infrastructure and your spirit.</p>
<p>Premier Bligh said that the mental health measures were important in the lead up to the Easter period.</p>
<p>“Grants will be made available to local non government organisations to deliver assistance, counselling services, community access, respite and expert referral to other support services,” she said.</p>
<p>“These local groups will also provide additional individual and family counselling, personalised support and group support to those that need it.</p>
<p>“This means that people who are experiencing distress or mental health problems and need support will have access to additional individual and family services.</p>
<p>“Under this funding the carers themselves will get extra access to information, counselling and other support services.”</p>
<p>Further details of the services that will be funded under the Community Recovery and Wellbeing Package will be settled with the Queensland Government over the coming days and will be consistent with NDRRA requirements. </p>
