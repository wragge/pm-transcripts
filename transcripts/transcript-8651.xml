SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P. 3. KEATING, MP<br />
EMPLOYER OF THE YEAR AWARDS, 7 SEPTEMBER 1992<br />
Ladies and gentlemen,<br />
I em very pleased to be here for the presentation of the<br />
Prime Minister's Employer of the Year Awards. Thank~ you<br />
all for coming.<br />
You will often hear from our side of politics the term<br />
" 1social net" by which we mean the protection of those<br />
who for any reason need protection or assistance, who<br />
live and work at a disadvantage.<br />
We think the " social net" is a measure of how civilised<br />
we are.<br />
I think the term is sometimes misunderstood.<br />
It is not merely a social backstop. It is not socially<br />
inactive or passive.<br />
Increasingly in the last decade, Australians have<br />
developed creative programs, which are valuable both to<br />
the individual and society at large.<br />
And I think we have come to recognise in Australia that<br />
such programs are m~ ore than a measure of our progress<br />
towards a good society they actively propel us along<br />
that path.<br />
They give us all a bit more strength.<br />
We are here today to congratulate employers who have<br />
given new lob opportunities to people with disabilities.<br />
People who have been given these opportunities speak of<br />
the enormous boost to their confidence and self-esteem,<br />
the sense of independence and self-reliance they gain<br />
things which are basic to all of us.<br />
We're here to congratulate employers who have made this<br />
possible but we also owe them our thanks. z&gt; tp -j' 6 10 -Uj Imu F V I, V_, </p>

Because in doing these things, it seems to me, we j.<br />
grow in self-esteem, and confidence, and self-reliance.<br />
We make Australia a better place to live when we do them.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen<br />
1992 marks the end of the United Nations International<br />
Decade of disabled pe~ rsons,' so it is appropriate, I<br />
think, to briefly" outlfiie how the Commonwealth Government<br />
has been living up to its responsibilities.<br />
In 1987 we took an historic first step towards overcoming<br />
the barriers faced by Australians with disabilities, with<br />
the introduction of theDisabilityServices Act.<br />
The Act has provided both a significant catalyst for<br />
change and a set of principles and objectives to strive<br />
for. it took the needs of people with disablities out of the<br />
realms of protective charity and into those of social<br />
policy. It made segregation in accomodation and employment a<br />
thing of the past.<br />
The Disability Services Act established two new<br />
employment models:<br />
competitive employment and training agencies which<br />
enable people with disabilities to earn a full wage<br />
and<br />
supported employment services for those people who<br />
require additional training and support.<br />
I'm pleased to say that many of the employers who have<br />
been nominated for these awards'have received assistance<br />
from services funded under the Act.<br />
The introduction late last year of theDisabilityReform.<br />
Package extends our initiative to provide adequate<br />
assistance for those who are unable to compete in the<br />
labour market, while also providing opportunities and<br />
encouragement for those who have potential for<br />
employment. Ladies and gentlemen<br />
Today I am proud to advise you that the Disability<br />
Di~ scrimnration Bill has passed through the House of<br />
Representatives.. Under the legislat. on, people with disabilities who<br />
experience discrimination in employment will be able to<br />
make a complaint to the Human Rights and Equal<br />
Opportunity Commission. </p>
<p>I LL 3<br />
The Disability Discrimination Bill will complement<br />
existing State laws in the area of physical, intellectual<br />
and psychiatric disability, and extend to people with<br />
disabilities similar rights and opportunities as are<br />
enjoyed by Australians generally.<br />
I am also pleased to say that, despite the tight fiscal<br />
environment? in this year's Budget we announced a package<br />
of assistance to address the additional costs of<br />
disability. We have come a long way in this Decade of Disabled<br />
Persons. But new challenges emerge.<br />
We need to provide support for people commensurate<br />
with their needs.<br />
We need to address more comprehensively people with<br />
psychiatric disabilities people who in the past<br />
have suffered from very considerable neglect.<br />
We need to generate employment and activity<br />
opportunities for people currently in sheltered<br />
workshops. We need to facilitate the successful transition of<br />
young people with disabilities from school into the<br />
workforce or further training.<br />
The Government is committed to ensuring that young people<br />
with disabilities obtain their share of access to the<br />
employment and training places announced in the<br />
Government's Youth Statement, Young Australians.<br />
There are of course no easy or quick solutions but, in<br />
view of what has been achieved so far, I am confident<br />
that imagination and sustained cooperative effort can<br />
take us a long way.<br />
Our success has proved the value of cooperation between<br />
the Commonwealth Government and its departments, State<br />
governments, organisations representing people with<br />
disabilities, service providers, employers and unions.<br />
I am pleased that many of these bodies are represented<br />
here and I welcome them all.<br />
In particular, I want to thank Ian Spicer and Martin<br />
Ferguson. Their presence acknowledges the work which employers and<br />
unions have been doing jointly ani1 individually to raise<br />
the awareness of their members about the capacities and<br />
the largely untapped potential of people with<br />
disabilities. &gt; ep ' JZ III U I %. IV I </p>

Ladies and Gentlemen<br />
Today we can celebrate the achievements of many hundreds<br />
of Australians who are turning our ideal into a reality.<br />
Australia's achievements in the area of disability<br />
legislation, programs and financial assistance have<br />
placed us in the forefront of international development<br />
in this area.<br />
Australia received recognition and praise at the<br />
Independence ' 92 Congress in Vancouver last year.<br />
As I have said on more than one occasion in recent<br />
months, these difficult economic times we have been<br />
through, and the economic challenges we face, do not<br />
constitute a reason for discounting our social<br />
achievements or our social goals.<br />
Ladies and Gentlemen<br />
Let me thank on your behalf the selection panel who face<br />
the difficult task of choosing the finalists from shortlists<br />
from each State and Territory and the Comxnownwealth<br />
and who also insisted on examining all the entrants, not<br />
only those who were short-listed.<br />
Finally, let me say something about the employers who<br />
have been nominated for these awards.<br />
Among the significant features of the nominations were<br />
the full award wages and conditions under which<br />
people are employed.<br />
the willingness of employers to modify the workplace<br />
the level of integration into the workplace of<br />
employees with a disability, and<br />
the expanding of job profiles of workers to allow<br />
them the training and supervision necessary to<br />
perform more complex tasks in the organisations.<br />
A wide variety of occupations and industries are<br />
The success stories include a customer service<br />
operator, an apprentice upholsterer, a fast food kitchenhand,<br />
a horticultural employee, and office work in<br />
architectural and engineering firms to name just a few.<br />
Ladles and Gentlemen<br />
On behalf of everyone here I want to congratulate all the<br />
employers nominated for these awards. TEL Sep 92 15: Ut) NO . UU3 r. u4/ uz) </p>

It might well be said, beyond the recognition we afford<br />
them today, the most satisfying return on their efforts<br />
lies in the words of some of those people they have<br />
helped. For instance, one man with a severe physical disability<br />
has said: " I feel proud of myself. Since becoming financially<br />
independent, I have been able to help other people,"<br />
Another said: " before, when I wasn't working I was more<br />
frightened to go out but now I am more secure and<br />
self-confident."<br />
And a young man with an intellectual disability has<br />
remarked on how much better the experience of working is<br />
compared to social security:<br />
" People still have the right to have a Job, he said,<br />
to do things like other people. With 8 job you can<br />
plan things you want to do with your life instead of<br />
relying on other people."<br />
Ladies and Gentlemen-<br />
I now ask my colleague the Minister for Health, Housing<br />
and Community Services, Mr Brian Howe, to Call upon the<br />
State and Commonwealth winners to come forward and<br />
receive their awards. </p>
