PRIME MINISTER<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING, MP<br />
ALP CAMPAIGN LAUNCH<br />
MELBOURNE, 14 FEBRUARY 1996<br />
Three years ago I asked the people of Australia to entrust to Labor the most<br />
important responsibility a government can have I asked Australians for a<br />
mandate to create jobs, and help the unemployed.<br />
To create jobs, I asked Australians to give Labor the task of creating<br />
sustainable economic growth on which jobs depend.<br />
To create jobs, I sought a mandate to make Australia stronger; to find our place<br />
in Asia and the Pacific; to encourage the industries of the future; to massively<br />
expand education and training: to increase our national savings.<br />
I sought a mandate to protect our environment.<br />
I asked Australians to entrust to Labor the guardianship of the social safety net.<br />
I asked for a mandate to make the arrangements governing our workplaces<br />
both more flexible and fair: a mandate to encourage more enterprise bargaining<br />
while maintaining awards and the right of Australian workers to bargain<br />
collectively. I asked that arrangements with the trade union movement be such as to ensure<br />
low inflation and thus sustainable economic and employment growth; I asked<br />
for more of the Accord.<br />
I asked that Labor be entrusted to act upon the decision of the High Court of<br />
Australia which recognised that the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people<br />
had occupied this continent for thousands of years before Europeans came.<br />
I asked that Australian women put their faith in us to make it easier to combine<br />
work and families.<br />
I asked Australians to trust us to maintain the principles of tolerance and<br />
diversity on which the cohesion of modem Australia depends and on which it<br />
is flourishing.<br />
4824 </p>
<p>I asked to be entrusted with the task of resisting that radical conservative<br />
assault on our social values and our national aspirations which then went<br />
under the name of Fightback, and presently goes under the various disguises<br />
of John Howard.<br />
Today I ask for a renewal of that mandate in every detail, including the last.<br />
I ask for it on two grounds: for what we have done in the past three years, and<br />
for what we must do in the next three.<br />
The Australian people gave us that mandate in 1993 at a time when they might<br />
easily have chosen to reject us. Australia was just emerging from recession.<br />
There were a million people unemployed. Australians might easily have<br />
chosen to punish the Labor Government and abandon Labor~ s social<br />
democratic model for the conservative alternative.<br />
lost Our responsibility was therefore all the greater when they chose not to. For the<br />
) r a past three years we have governed in that knowledge.<br />
ting And we have worked, I think, at least as hard as any government in our history<br />
to repay that trust.<br />
ace We aimed at 500,000 new jobs and we have delivered 714,000 500,000 of<br />
M~ Y them in small business. We aimed at sustained and sustainable economic<br />
growth and we are now benefiting from the longest period of sustained growth<br />
in Australia's history. And with low inflation and rapidly growing exports into the<br />
fastest growing region in the world, we can at last say with confidence Ohat the<br />
growth is sustainable.<br />
iet. We said we would find a place for Australia in Asia and the Pacific, and we<br />
ces have surprised even ourselves by the progress we have made. The APEC<br />
ing agenda now agreed will add another half million new jobs for Australians.<br />
lain We said we would expand education and training to prepare young Australians<br />
for the modern workforce and a world in which knowledge is a nation's most<br />
ure important commodity and through Working Nation we are injecting $ 1.5 billion<br />
ked into it.<br />
With 2 million new jobs since 1983, employment growth under Labor has been<br />
t Of virtually unrivalled in the world. The Department of Education and Training<br />
) ple estimates that if we lift our skills and grow our information and service<br />
industries if we keep to our present policies we can create another 2 million<br />
jobs in the next 10 years.<br />
ine Working Natiun deveaops skills which enaole people to compete for the new<br />
jobs. Only Working Nation has the strategy and resources to do this. And only<br />
3nd Labor is committed to Working Nation.<br />
: h it ,1825 </p>
<p>3<br />
Working Nation does something else, of course it looks after unemployed<br />
Australians. \ Ve :" ave introduced a Jot Com-act wihich, when fLuiy implemented. will mean<br />
that any Australian who has been unemployed for 18 months or more will be<br />
offered a job. We are personally case managing 377,000 Australians to help<br />
them find their way into jobs, or training for jobs.<br />
We have reduced the number of young unemployed by nearly 20 per cent. We<br />
have reduced the total number of unemployed by 230,000.<br />
94,000 young Australians are still looking for work, and the unemployed still<br />
number more than 750,000, so there is no cause for self-congratulation.<br />
But there is cause to be confident that we can reach our target of 5 per cent<br />
unemployment by the turn of the century and the other target we have set<br />
ourselves, of another 600,000 new jobs over the life of the current Accord.<br />
And there is every reason to defend the policies and programs which are taking<br />
us towards these objectives.<br />
We have substantially increased our national savings, as we said we would.<br />
The figure presently stands at $ 230 billion; under the new superannuation<br />
measures it is anticipated to grow to one trillion by the year 2000 and<br />
two trillion by 2020. f<br />
It is worth considering Australias foreign debt in this context. Total fbreign<br />
debt, of which 5 per cent is Commonwealth Government debt, stands at<br />
$ 180 billion. The vast majority is private debt, and much of that is invested in<br />
major national projects which will be of considerable long term value to<br />
Australia.<br />
At the same time as foreign debt has accumulated, so has our capacity to pay.<br />
And now secured against the debt, and providing an alternative pool of capital<br />
from which to barrow, are national savings already much bigger and growing<br />
infinitely faster.<br />
Our superannuation changes will increase national savings and the savings oft<br />
all Australians; such that an Australian couple now in their mid 30s with<br />
average earnings will receive, on their retirement, an income 75 per cent higher<br />
than the age pension. c<br />
We asked that we be entrusted with the care of the Australian environment, v<br />
and we have taken that responsibility very seriously.<br />
In 1996 our natural environment has a better future than it has had at any timeE<br />
in the past 200 years. Perhaps most importantly, we are all beginning to see<br />
that environmental values are not only consistent with economic success, but a<br />
precondition of it.<br />
4826 </p>
<p>oyed Shoalwater Bay and Jervis Bay have joined the Franklin River and Kakadu and<br />
the rainforests; of the wet tropics, and are now protected forever.<br />
-nean ill be The Cape York Agreement has the potential to deliver the second largest<br />
help World Heritage area in the world with the support of the communities in the<br />
region.<br />
We Landcare, which Labor started in 1989, has been given support to match the<br />
great enthusiasm with which Australian farming communities have adopted it.<br />
i still Major community participation programs like Save the Bush and Coastcare are<br />
flourishing.<br />
cent We have put aside six million hectares of forest for potential inclusion in a<br />
3 set world class system of forest reserves.<br />
Last month we delivered an environment statement which contained the<br />
iking biggest commitment in our history for the protection of our land, its productive<br />
capacity and its biodiversity. That environment statement takes the programs<br />
we have conceived and nurtured over the past five to ten years to a new level.<br />
ould. ation And the statement is fully funded. It is not contingent upon the sale of Telstra.<br />
and We have delivered on the environment in the past and we will deliver in the<br />
future and we wAil deliver policy, not political blackmail.<br />

ie to And with our new family health rebate, which will extend and strengthen<br />
Medicare, Australian families will have more choice and greater security and<br />
pay. assistance than ever before.<br />
, pital<br />
. wing We have made life for working women easier by establishing thousands more<br />
child care places and paying a child care rebate through Medicare offices. We<br />
introduced an $ 840 maternity allowance, and for parents who want to stay<br />
gs of home with their children, a parenting allowance.<br />
with<br />
gher We asked for a mandate to preserve the principle that decent wages and<br />
conditions based on the right of working men and women to bargain collectively<br />
and openly in the workplace are the basic requirements of a fair society, and<br />
nent, we have preserved that principle.<br />
We have preserved the jurisdiction ol che Industrial Reiarior-s Cor" mission to<br />
time act as the umpire to ensure fair agreements between firms and their workers.<br />
see<br />
but a 4827 </p>
<p>We are transforming our workplaces. We are making them more flexible.<br />
creative and productive in the last four years. labour productivity has been<br />
more than twice that of New Zealand. which, has been touted by our ooponents<br />
as a shining exzrnpie of the benefits o~ the syste cf; d' contrac* ts.<br />
Labor will not shift the essential balance in the relationship between employers<br />
and employees: we will make the relationship more flexible, we will make it<br />
more productive, we will offer more choice, but we will not sacrifice a hundred<br />
years of progress and leave Australian working men and women at the mercy<br />
of a market free-for-all. F<br />
We will not adopt the fantastic hypocrisy of modem conservatism whichr<br />
preaches the values of families and communities, while conducting a direct<br />
assault on them through reduced wages and conditions and job security.<br />
We respect every legitimate right of employers, including the right to dismiss<br />
employees, but not a right to unfairly dismiss them. We don't think we help r<br />
young Australians by making it easier to sack them or their parents.<br />
Three years ago Australians relied upon the Labor Government to maintain c<br />
unswerving commitment to cultural and racial tolerance and to continue to<br />
invest in the multicultural fabric of the nation. And we have done this. 1<br />
We have invested in the cultural diversity of this country and we have<br />
legislated to protect the victims of prejudice. We have not turned a blind eye to<br />
racism and we will not compromise the principle of non-discriminatibn in C<br />
immigration by erecting new barriers which discriminate against family reunion r<br />
for our Non-English Speaking Background communities.<br />
We introduced and passed legislation that ensured the right to sexual privacy<br />
for all Australians. C<br />
The mandate we sought to give legal expression to the Mabo judgement we<br />
have fulfilled, and it gives me great pride to be able to say so. The long battle<br />
to win the day has dramatically raised the level of understanding between black 1<br />
and white Australians. We were brought together and we learned a lot. We<br />
proved we could find solutions. r<br />
There is still a long way to go before we can say that we have done what must<br />
be done. But the will to do it is there. The next term of a Labor government wAil h<br />
see an unprecedented effort to solve the distressing problems of Aboriginal fE<br />
health and morale which are the continuing legacies of dispossession and<br />
neglect. I. v I; f<br />
Three years ago we promised to invest the arts with a new stature and k<br />
direction, and with Creative Nation we made good our promise. g<br />

been an Australian republic, and that is what we have done. We appointed an expert<br />
ients group and we set in motion a broad community debate.<br />
In June last year we presented the Government's preferred model to the<br />
) yers Australian parliament and people.<br />
ike it<br />
idred The Government never suggested that its model was the only one. We want to<br />
iercy see the widest possible discussion and consultation. We have issued nonpartisan<br />
educational materials to schools, libraries and community groups<br />
across the country. We welcome and support the Australia Consults program<br />
vhich recently launched by the National Australia Day Council.<br />
firect We believe that Australia's head of state should be one of us. We believe that<br />
an Australian head of state should welcome in the new century, should open<br />
miss the Olympic Games in the year 2000, should represent us abroad in this<br />
help nation's second century.<br />
If re-elected we will ask the Australian people what they think about the<br />
, itain question: do you want an Australian to be Australia's head of state?<br />
e to The Government will conduct a plebiscite a non-binding popular vote within<br />
twelve months of the first sitting of the new parliament.<br />
have ye to If the plebiscite is carried, the Government will then propose that a Joint Select<br />
) n in Committee, representative of both Houses of the Parliament, be appointed to<br />
inion make recommendations for a constitutional amendment to be put to the people<br />
at a referendum.<br />
vacy The joint committee would be established in such a way that neither the<br />
Government nor the Opposition would possess a majority. It would conduct<br />
extensive consultations with the states and the community and would consider<br />
twe submissions.<br />
attle<br />
) lack~ To succeed, the constitutional amendment necessary to create the republic<br />
We would need to be carried at the referendum by a majority of electors and in a<br />
majority of states.<br />
must The question of the republic has been one of several controversial issues we<br />
t Will have confronted in recent times. But we believe that not to confront them is a a<br />
ginal failure of our duty to lead the nation conscientiously.<br />
and We are very much aware that the great progress we have made in the last<br />
three years the unprecedented econimic groWn',. th; lovv inflatic-tfh? Ic,' st<br />
and level of strikes since 1940, the huge growth in joos, ie growth ir 3x; p'. rts and<br />
productivity has not translated automatically into material benefits, or a<br />
greater sense of security among many Australians. 4829 </p>
<p>But that is not an argument for throwing out the policies which have given us<br />
strikingly good results. It is an argument for listening harder and doing better.<br />
It is : nErefore not arcurnent ' C . n cc e<br />
They have opposed us at every step.<br />
Never has there been a more negative Opposition; or, since John Hewson's<br />
departure, an Opposition less willing to honestly state what it believes in.<br />
Never, I believe, has there been an Opposition so weak on policy and direction.<br />
And as we have led, our opponents have been busy changing leaders.<br />
John Hewson has gone he went abusing us for Working Nation and the<br />
Native Title Act and even more loudly cursing his colleagues for their<br />
dishonesty and faint-heartedness. Alexander Downer came and just as quickly<br />
went in a thick fog of confusion and embarrassment.<br />
They now offer, as an alternative Prime Minister, their own third choice as<br />
leader of the Liberal Party.<br />
They have changed their leaders but not themselves.<br />
They present him as a new man; they ask us to believe that all his previous<br />
political life had been one gigantic mistake.<br />
They ask us to believe that he will now support all those things he has devoted<br />
his life to opposing.<br />
They ask us to believe that he supports Medicare,-that his passionate life-long<br />
opposition to universal health insurance was just a passing phase; that when,<br />
over two decades, he was opposing every wage rise bar two and declaring that<br />
award protections were the greatest blight on the country, he was just<br />
rehearsing for the moment when he could say they were essential.<br />
They ask us to believe that while for two decades he never raised a finger in<br />
the interests of our environment, he was at heart an environmentalist.<br />
Apparently we are to interpret his deeply reactionary record as just youthful<br />
exuberance. It is too much to ask anyone to believe.<br />
They ask us to believe that he has a vision for Australia. But, after 20 years in<br />
politics, can any Australian say what it is?<br />
4830 </p>
<p>Ius The fact is. while Labor has a vision for Australia in the 21st century, John<br />
Howard's vision extends no further than 2 March 1996. While Labor has been<br />
repositioning Australia for the future, John Howard has been repositioning<br />
himself to escape his past.<br />
For 13 years we have resisted radical free market ideology in all its guises<br />
including the guises of John Howard.<br />
on's in. Now he is back, and with him a shadow ministry which presents a truly<br />
: ion. disconcerting prospect.<br />
Mr Fischer as Trade Minister a man who has publicly canvassed the idea that<br />
Australia could institute a trade war with Japan, our largest trading partner, by<br />
the not selling our primary products into their markets; a man who has said that the<br />
heir Israeli secret service stole Malcolm Frasers trousers in Memphis.<br />
-: ky Alexander Downer as Minister for Foreign Affairs the man who says we are<br />
", obsessed" with Asia the region where we do 75 per cent of our trade; the<br />
as man who says he would re-focus Australia on Europe and on what he calls our<br />
" Western allies" in North America;-and who said two days before the historic<br />
security agreement with Indonesia was signed that the " relationship was in<br />
tatters".<br />
ots We have a Shadow Treasurer who has yet to make a single constructive<br />
contribution to the economic debate in this country. Can anyone remember<br />
Mr Costello saying something positive or interesting about the futu re of<br />
) led Australia?<br />
And the Minister for selling Telstra in a Coalition government will be Bronwyn<br />
ong Bishop.<br />
len, , hat And they talk about arrogance.<br />
just Australia's greatest enterprise and the one with the greatest potential, the one<br />
on which every Australian in some sense depends Telstra is to be given to<br />
r in Mrs Bishop to sell.<br />
-hfulLet me repeat that Telstra is to be given to Mrs Bishop to sell.<br />
And if she fails in this task, as she is bound to, Australians will not get their<br />
environment policy from the Coalition.<br />
Let's be very clear about this. One party will sell Telstra if they win this<br />
s in election, the other Darty wi'l no! The Cof' tion wi!! sell it. The L~ t'r Party wil<br />
not. Yet, for all the alarming inadequacies of his most senior colleagues, none of<br />
them presents greater cause for alarm than the man who would be Prime<br />
Minister. ' 18.31.<br />
I </p>
<p>Mr Howard has always opposed those things which Australians are committed<br />
to thinas like Medicare. the environment and the social safety net. He now<br />
piasacs : that he has seen now A-, st,:-rac-like them. and has the! elOre char;: ed<br />
his mind.<br />
Even if we accepted this explanation, we would still have to query his<br />
On foreign policy he has almost without exception chosen the wrong side on<br />
every issue. He supported Ronald Reagan's Star Wars program but opposed<br />
the South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone. He thought Gorbachev's perestroika<br />
program was a plot to disarm the West. He agreed with the opponents of<br />
Nelson Mandela and vociferously opposed economic sanctions against South<br />
Africa. When he mistakenly anticipated some political advantage, he<br />
questioned the non-discriminatory principles of our immigration program. Last<br />
year he gave every indication that he is still fighting the Vietnam War by<br />
refusing to see Vietnam's most important political leader during his visit to<br />
Australia. He is truly the most conservative leader the Liberal Party has ever had.<br />
The truth is Mr Howard has never been able to drag his feet from the sands of<br />
the past. He once said about Medicare that he knew we could never go back<br />
entirely to the privatised health system of the 50s and 60s but, he said, " I<br />
would love to go back".<br />
As with Medicare. so with so much else.<br />
That is why we say leadership is a major issue in this election because we<br />
cannot go back. We cannot drift. We cannot take the risk.<br />
If we are bold and have confidence in ourselves, we can grasp the opportunity<br />
that now presents itself. No country in the world just now has such an<br />
opportunity. What is happening now in East Asia is without precedent in world history.<br />
Consider the wealth generated by the Industrial Revolution, and then consider<br />
the relative size of the populations which produced it<br />
East Asia has 2.5 billion people. The consistently high rates of economic<br />
growth coupled with higher education is producing new and rising levels of<br />
wealth and opportunity that knows no parallel in history.<br />
And Australia is right in the middle of it.<br />
Through most of our history, we have been remote from the big markets of the<br />
world. But not any more.<br />
41832 </p>
<p>nitted If we recognise the opportunity and truly seek to integrate ourseives with it our<br />
noweconomic future is assured. And with that integration will come the trade and<br />
. nged wealth to further develop Australia and put us firmly in charge of our future.<br />
The last ten years have seen us prepare for this opportunity, the last three<br />
y his years have seen us beginning to come to grips with it.<br />
But we will only succeed in the region around us if we truly want to be there. If<br />
Je on we regard it as our natural place to be, with the people around us as real and<br />
) osed genuine neighbours.<br />
troika its of Our children will receive the inheritance we ourselves have been given, but<br />
; outh they will employ it not as an enclave marooned on an abundant island but as a<br />
he nation with a destiny flowing from the most generous benefaction of history; a<br />
Last continent of our own, a border with no one, a deep democracy, an egalitarian<br />
3r by ethic.<br />
; it to The challenge is to harness our confidence;, to make ourselves stronger at<br />
home and more enterprising abroad.<br />
We have been preparing well, with higher levels of education and training, a<br />
ds of premium on creativity and innovation, the development of a productivity culture,<br />
back a commitment to competitiveness.<br />
iid " I In a decade our exports are well on the way to doubling, our service industries<br />
are growing dramatically and there is now a constellation of Australian<br />
companies all over the world.<br />
* e we Australians and their children will increasingly live lives caught up in the<br />
phenomenon of our intemationalisation and find jobs in the industry of our<br />
region. And their income growth will be guaranteed.<br />
unity ian We can enter the new century a unique country with a unique future. We can<br />
enter it prosperous and dynamic: a diverse and tolerant society, trading actively<br />
in Asia and the rest of the world; secure in our identity, the more so because<br />
we know that we have met the challenge of our times.<br />
sider It is the greatest challenge we have ever faced as a nation. By the year 2000<br />
we should be able to say that this predominantly British and European country<br />
has learned to live securely, in peace and mutual prosperity among our Asian<br />
omic and Pacific neighbours.<br />
Is of We will not be cut off from our British and Eiuropean c~. es 2-:-do c<br />
from those economies. On the contrary, the More engaged re<br />
economically and politically with the region around us, the more value and<br />
relevance we bring to those old relationships.<br />
, f the 48.33 </p>
<p>Far from putting our identity at risk, our relationships with the region will it<br />
energise it. c E<br />
We wili have Thnis unio-ue , ced.. We&amp; w e made sense<br />
of our future.<br />
But it will only happen if we make it.<br />
If we hesitate; if we look back and say: well, there is the past on the one hand,<br />
and on the other hand there is the future, and the choice is not exclusive; let us .1L<br />
ponder, let us form a committee, let us have a convention, let us listen to whata<br />
our rump has to say, let us drift if we do that, we will lose the chance, a0<br />
Because our neighbours are not drifting; our competitors are not drifting, the<br />
modem world is not drifting the tide of change in the modern world is greater E<br />
and more rapid now than at any time in our history. To drift would be 1<br />
disastrous. The truth is we either grasp the opportunity now, or fail. The pace and V<br />
momentum must not be lost; for if the fire goes out, not only is it unlikely to be<br />
re-lit, but the opportunity will be lost and we will repent in leisure. T if,<br />
The Asian economies are a huge field but the gateways are narrow and wAilb<br />
rapidly close. tc<br />
ar<br />
The same might be said of another great opportunity which we simply'ms<br />
grasp. T<br />
Our ability to meet the challenge of the information revolution will significantly C.<br />
determine how many jobs we can create in the near future, and what sort of<br />
jobs they will be. A<br />
How we meet it will also have a large say in the kind of country we become i<br />
over the next half decade: whether, for instance, we continue to grow as a ft<br />
clever and creative country; whether we innovate for ourselves or borrow from C<br />
others; whether we generate our own films, television, information services of<br />
and scientific and educational materials; whether our kids watch Playschool or<br />
a Hollywood equivalent. P<br />
It all depends on decisions we have made being followed through. And on the ar<br />
right decisions being made in the near future. I V<br />
If we move quickly we can create a major new Australian industry worth many At<br />
billions of dollars which will create many thousands of jobs. fo<br />
4834 H </p>
<p>will It can be Australian hospitals, not Californian ones, which deliver on-line<br />
diagnostic services to Vietnam; Monash University, not the London School of<br />
Economics, which delivers on-line education services to Malaysia; Australian<br />
ise banks, Australian insurance companies, Australian businesses and agencies<br />
vastly expanding their operations through on-line services abroad. There really<br />
is no limit.<br />
So long as we move quickly.<br />
uds Let me ask one more question flowing from the information revolution. Does<br />
' hat anyone believe that the current Coalition is equipped to deal with it? If the<br />
answer is ' I'm not sure' that is as good a reason as any other not to vote for<br />
them.<br />
the<br />
iter Because if Mr Howard and his colleagues dither if they drop the baton we<br />
be have carried for the past four years the race will be over. And Australia will<br />
be the loser.<br />
ind We will lose a potentially massive industry and much else with it.<br />
be The ability of our schools to take advantage of this revolution is particularly<br />
important. A Labor Government will not support a school system divided<br />
will between the information rich and the information poor. Our first priority must be<br />
to provide computers on the basis of need, especially the needs of those who<br />
are economically disadvantaged or in remote and rural areas.<br />
ust The digitisation program, along with commitments made by Telstra and Optus,<br />
will deliver network access to over 97 per cent of schools by the turn of the<br />
ritly century.<br />
t Of And today I am happy to announce that Labor will provide a new $ 300 million<br />
information technology strategy for schools: $ 240 million over four years for<br />
me hardware for computer learning centres for Australia's schools, and. $ 60 million<br />
a for professional development for teachers. The $ 240 million will buy 150,000<br />
omn computers and might I say, because of last year's Innovation Statement, many<br />
; es of them will be made in Australia.<br />
I or This is essential spending if we are to succeed in the information revolution<br />
the and our children are to have a first rate chance in a first rate country.<br />
J What we do over the next few years will have profound implications for schools,<br />
businesses, homes and hospitals. It will have profound implications for<br />
3ny Australia in the 21st century. It cannot be left to chance. I truly believe it<br />
cannot be left to the Liberal and National parties.<br />
I have chosen not to announce a swag of new policies in this speech today.<br />
Unlike the Coalition, we have had our policies before the Australian people<br />
for their examination for some time now. i the Innovation Statement, the<br />
Housing Statement, the Environment Statement, the National Forest Policy 4835 </p>
<p>Statement, the health policy, the Accord, APEC. the Security Agreement with<br />
Indonesia the republic.<br />
In this soeech. what I have been concerned with are the challenges we face as<br />
a naticri ana the way Labor is going about meeting them. I think that is what<br />
Austraiians need to be sure about just now the direction we are going, how we<br />
are coping with the change all around us, how their families, communities and<br />
their country are going to fare in all this.<br />
I believe they are going to fare very well.<br />
Much of what I have said has concerned our future, our kids, the Australians of<br />
next century.<br />
But change also affects older Australians. It was in part to protect them against<br />
change that the Government has fulfilled Labor's historic promise to ensure that<br />
the aged pension is pegged at 25 per cent of average weekly earnings.<br />
Last year, and right through the commemorations marking the 50th anniversary<br />
of the Second World War, Australians have paid tribute to the heroic<br />
generation who defended our liberty and freedom everywhere.<br />
A generation which contributed so much to this country deserve all the benefits<br />
that we can provide.<br />
At the same time, we must meet the needs of those members of today's'older<br />
generation who too often find themselves out of the workforce but still-willing<br />
and able to make vital contributions to this country.<br />
Today we are releasing some initiatives a Labor Government will take to help<br />
them to make these contributions. These may be taken as the beginning of<br />
what will be a major government undertaking to come to terms with the new<br />
realities of modern society as they apply to older people and to develop<br />
programs which will tap their skills and knowledge and, where they wish,<br />
engage them in the social and economic mainstream.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen<br />
At the end of three years we face the people of Australia confident that we have<br />
earned their trust once more. I think we can say these things.<br />
That we strenuously pursued the goals we set and that sometimes we<br />
exceeded our own expectations. That we have been willing to lead, at home<br />
and abroad, and that we have led with success. That we have looked after the<br />
national interest and that we have looked after our fellow Australians when they<br />
needed looking after. We have been conscientious. We have been active. We<br />
have honoured the trust that was placed in us.<br />
11836 </p>
<p>wvith It is for the Australian people to judge us. If they judge us on our record I<br />
believe they will decide that we have earned their trust again. And not just for<br />
what we have done. but for what we are determined to do for what we believe<br />
3ce as in, for the future of Australia.<br />
3 what<br />
ow we Our opponents, who have refused to present the people with their policies until<br />
3s and well into the campaign itself, are talking about honesty, and trust.<br />
But there can be no honesty without the honest presentation of policies. And it<br />
is not honest to offer one policy as a bribe to win support for another. And it is<br />
difficult to trust a man who denies his past, who says he supports a health care<br />
ans of system he has always opposed, promises an industrial relations system of the<br />
kind he has always abhorred, or declares himself something he has never<br />
been.<br />
gainst<br />
* e that Our opponents say that it is time for Labor to go, as if there was a natural order<br />
to elections, and not the need to prove credentials, prove ideas, demonstrate<br />
capacity, show the people of Australia where you intend to take the country.<br />
3rsary ieroic These years are too important to risk.<br />
Let me tell you this: Labor's vision never burned so brightly, we were never<br />
mefits more determined, never was the sense of mission stronger.<br />
We Australians have a remarkable future within our grasp, a future which other<br />
oldercountries can only dream of. We have this great goal and Labor has a great<br />
wvilling passion to reach it.<br />
