PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P. J. KEATING MP<br />
DOORSTOP, PALAIS THEATRE, MELBOURNE, 13 AUGUST 1995<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
J: Are you happy with the way the pLselection process was resolved?<br />
PM: I think that Theo Theophanous and Jenny Mikakos made a very<br />
important gesture to the-abor.. Pary and to Martin Ferguson. I think<br />
they, in the best traditions of the Paity, made a decision which they<br />
think will be good for Labor and good for the government and I<br />
certainly salute their decision and to endorse Martin Ferguson.<br />
J: Mr Keating, how much pressure did the Federal Executive put on Mr<br />
Thoephanous?<br />
PM: The Executive hasn't met as you know and he had to make a decision<br />
about whether he ran the gauntlet of that process or not. But, for my<br />
part, I made clear my support for Martin Ferguson. He is the leader of<br />
the industrial movement in Australia and it has been somewhat of a<br />
traditional thing that the leader of the labour movement came to the<br />
Federal Parliamentary Labor Party, in his case, when he thought it<br />
would be worthwhile. Bob Hawke did this. Simon Crean did it. Now,<br />
he has that opportunity. We will be stronger for having him.<br />
J: Do you see him as a leader of the Left or as a potential leader of the<br />
Party?<br />
PM: That is for people in the Parliamentary party to decide, but I certainly<br />
see him as a clear addition to the Caucus and, of course, representing<br />
working Australia, the millions of working men and women in this<br />
country. It could only make the Labor Party stronger and more<br />
relevant.<br />
J: And for the people of Batman, what can they expect? </p>
<p>PM: I think a first class, experienced representative who already<br />
understands the process of government and will be taken into the<br />
government and into its processes.<br />
J: Were you surprised by today's decision?<br />
PM: Pleasantly surprised.<br />
