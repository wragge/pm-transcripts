ABORIGINAL POLICY<br />
In-May, 1967, as a result of the Referendum, the Commonwealth<br />
received a new responsibility for Aborigines. During the lifetime of the<br />
last Parliament we have fashioned a policy to meet that responsibility. In<br />
the next Parliament we intend to develop it still further.<br />
My predecessor, the late Harold Holt, first set up the Council<br />
for Aboriginal Affairs, and I took the next step by appointing a Minister-in-<br />
Charge within my own Department.<br />
Our basic aim is to give our Aboriginals the opportunity to be<br />
self-supporting, and to end the " mentality of the hand-out". We want them<br />
to choose for themselves their own future, and to regain their initiative and<br />
independence. Not all will make the same choice, since their various<br />
circumstances are so very different.<br />
The constitutional powers of the Commonwealth in this field are<br />
not exclusive, but we share with the States. It is not our intention to usurp<br />
State functions, particularly because we believe that decentralisation and<br />
regional administration will be in the interests of the Aborigines themselves.<br />
Our grants to the States last year for A boriginal advancement were<br />
5 million: this year they will be 4 million. These grants are used for<br />
the purposes of housing, education, health and employment.<br />
We have sponsored training schemes, education schemes and<br />
schemes of regional development. Through our Aboriginal Enterprises<br />
Capital Fund, we are making it possible for Aboriginals to own their own<br />
businesses, whether on an individual or a group basis.<br />
We believe that Aboriginals should be able to retain features of<br />
their own culture where they so choose. The work of the A ustralian Institute<br />
of Aboriginal Studies, which was set up by us, will help here. We are<br />
encouraging Aboriginal handicrafts and arts. We aim to create a higher<br />
degre., of mutual respect between Aboriginal Australians and other<br />
Australians. We gratefully acknowledge that, towards these ends, there is a<br />
great deal of work being done by non-Governmental organisations, including<br />
both Church bodies and lay bodies. We aim to utilise the great reservoir<br />
of goodwill towards the A botiginals which exists throughout the community. </p>
<p>ABORIGINAL POLICY Page 2<br />
Our plans for the next phase are as follows:<br />
1 Regional schemes such as we have worked out in<br />
collaboration with the A boriginals themselves for<br />
Prnhem Land will be followed both in the Northern<br />
Territory and in conjunction with State administrations.<br />
2. Increased allocations will be made for Aboriginal<br />
housing in both the States and the Northern Territory:<br />
in addition we shall be encouraging Aborigines to make<br />
use of our Aged Persons Homes programme and of finance<br />
through co-operative building societies.<br />
3. Where a State has land for Aboriginals, we will provide<br />
through our Capital Fund the resources to develop it for<br />
Aboriginal advancement and under Aboriginal ownership.<br />
4. We intend to involve Aboriginal communities in their own<br />
local government and in the maintenance of law and order<br />
among themselves to the greatest possible extent.<br />
We shall continue and expand our programmes for<br />
Aboriginal health and education, with the aim of ensuring<br />
to them, in practice as well as in theory, all the<br />
advantages enjoyed by other Australians.<br />
6. In recent years, most discriminatory legislation against<br />
Aboriginals has been abolished. We intend to see that this<br />
process is completed in the life of the next Parliament upon<br />
both State and Federal levels.<br />
7. Our policies of research into all aspects of Aboriginal<br />
welfare will be continued. We shall continue to fost. r<br />
Aboriginal culture and to give them a chance to participate<br />
in sport. We shall press on with our programme of<br />
helping other Australians to appreciate both the value<br />
of their culture and the problems which face them.<br />
We do not intend to take the easy way of deciding everything for<br />
the aboriginals, and telling them what they are to do and what they are to be.<br />
Instead, we will take the slower and better way of consulting them, and<br />
working out plans in accordance with their real wishes. </p>
<p>PRIMARY INDUSTRY<br />
Following its established and proven policy of consultation and<br />
negotiation with the primary industries, the Government has continued and<br />
will continue to introduce measures designed to stabilise and strengthen<br />
these important industries and thereby to strengthen the economies of the<br />
countries, towns and cities which depend on them.<br />
The Government is well aware of the cost pressures which national<br />
policies of rapid growth and development have brought to bear on the primary<br />
industries and has constantly sought to devis e new measures to offset these<br />
pressures. Coupled with low and in some cases, declining prices on overseas<br />
markets, these pressures have caused considerable difficulty for many<br />
primary industries. In addition to the many established methods of offsetting these<br />
special difficulties such as production subsidies, stabilisation schemes,<br />
bounties on fertilizers, equalisation of petrol prices, tax concessions,<br />
building of beef roads and establishment of water conservation projects, the<br />
Government has recently introduced significant new measur-s designed to<br />
further lighten the cost burden falling on primary producers.<br />
One of the most important of these is in the area of estate duty<br />
where for the first time the Commonw calth has moved to give special<br />
concessions on the estates of primary producers by raising the existing<br />
statutory exemption by 20% and in addition reducing the amount of estate<br />
duty payable in proportion to that part of the duty attributable to the value of<br />
real assets such as land, livestock, plant and machinery.<br />
Further measures introduced in the recent Budget included<br />
increases in both the superphosphate and nitrogenous fertilizer bounties<br />
bringing the cost of these bounties up to $ 65 million a year. Tax concessions<br />
for primary producers have been extended to allow the cost of all structural<br />
improvements for conserving water or fodder to be deductible in full for tax<br />
purposes in the year in which the expenditure is incurred. This measure is<br />
seen as a very strong incentive to farmers to conserve more water and fodder<br />
on their own properties so they can better cope with the droughts which are<br />
a feature of Australia's weather pattern. For direct relief of drought effects<br />
the Commonwealth over the last four years has provided by way of grants<br />
and loans a total of $ 119 million.<br />
Australia's biggest foreign exchange earner, the wool industry,<br />
is on the threshold of big and important development. The Government,<br />
again to help wool growers to meet their cost problems, has offered to almost<br />
double its contribution towards research and promotion while halving the cost<br />
to growers. This would mean that the Government, if this offer is accepted<br />
by the industry, would provide up to $ 27 million a year for research and<br />
promotion. </p>
<p>PRIMARY INDUSTRY Page 2<br />
The wool industry also is now examining the Government's<br />
offer of finance for the industry's new marketing proposals. These<br />
proposals came forward from the Australian Wool Industry Conference and<br />
the Government, after careful examination made certain changes in the<br />
proposals and offered up to $ 7.3 million a year to assist in their<br />
implementation $ 1.2 million more than the assessed cost of the original<br />
proposals. The Government's offer has been formally conveyed to<br />
representatives of the A. W. I. C. for consideration and the conference will<br />
have the assistance of the cost/ benefit analysis now being revised by the<br />
Australian Wool Board in coming to a decision. The Government believes<br />
its offer, if accepted by the industry, will be a means of helping the<br />
industry to take a vital first step in the modernisation of the wool industry,<br />
without interfering with its traditional and well proved method of selling<br />
through the auction system.<br />
With the wheat industry facing serious difficulties because of<br />
very hard production and diminishing world markets, the Government has<br />
responded to the industry's request for help in introducing a delivery quotas<br />
scheme to bring production and markets more into balance. The Government<br />
agreed to the industry's request to guarantee finance totalling $ 440 million<br />
to allow a first advance of 10 to be paid on all quota wheat this season.<br />
Recently, the Government arranged with the A ustralian Wheat<br />
Board for an additional 60 million bushel of storage space to be provided<br />
so that all wheat produced this season can be taken into storage by the<br />
middle of next year. Last year the industry's stabilisation plan was<br />
renewed for a further five years. Under the plan, the protective cover over<br />
the industry has been increased by extending the guaranteed export price to<br />
200 million bushel'-of wheat, compared with the 150 million bushel,<br />
previously. The plan also fixes prices for wheat consumed in Australia and<br />
these are subject to annual variation as a result of movements in certain costs.<br />
The Government has entered into strenuous negotiation to ensure<br />
that Australia's access to the United States Meat Market is maintained and<br />
if possible increased. These negotiations led to a worthwhile increase in<br />
the quantity of meat entering that market from Australia although Australia's<br />
share of the total market declined. The Government has provided at a cost<br />
of more than $ 5 million a year an export inspection service to ensure that all<br />
meat leaving A ustralia meets the highest standard of quality demanded by<br />
overseas consumers. This service has helped Australia keep markets it<br />
could otherwise have lost. Support to the Dairy Industry has continued, this<br />
year including substantial compensation for losses resulting from Britain's<br />
devaluation of her currency two years ago. Total devaluation compensation<br />
paid or committed to all Australian primary export industries has now<br />
reached approximately $ 86 million. </p>
<p>PRIMARY INDUSTRY Page 3<br />
The Government has actively assisted the sugar industry<br />
by taking a leading part in the negotiation which produced the new<br />
International Sugar greement and by entering into a new domestic<br />
agreement with the Queensland Government on the domestic pricing<br />
arrangements for sugar. In addition the Government has made loans<br />
totalling about $ 24 million to the industry to assist it in recent periods of<br />
difficulty. These are examples of the many ways in which the Government<br />
is continually working to ensure the stability of Australia's primary<br />
industries. One which has attracted a great deal of attention is the rapidly<br />
developing fishing industry in which the Government has taken a number of<br />
steps such as the claiming of an exclusive 12 miles fishing zone for<br />
Australian fishermen; the establishment of Navy and Air Force patrols to<br />
police the zone; the enactment of laws . o give Australia control of the<br />
living marine resources of the Great Barrier Reef; the conclusion of an<br />
agreement with Japan, providing for the phasing out of all Japanese<br />
fishing operations within the 12-mile zone and the closing of Australian<br />
ports to foreign fishing vessels. The Government has acted to assist a<br />
number of other primary industries in a variety of ways and is currently<br />
examining the problems of others in an effort to find ways cf helping the<br />
industries concerned to overcome these problems. </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER'S POLICY SPEECH 1969<br />
Supplementary Statement on Health<br />
Commonwealth medical benefits and fund benefits will be<br />
increased so that the difference between the benefit entitlements and fees<br />
most commonly charged by doctors will not exceed $ 5 even for the most<br />
complicated and costly surgical procedures. For simpler procedures,<br />
which are less expensive, the difference between the benefits and doctors'<br />
common fees will be very much less.<br />
At the same time, we firmly believe that the patient should<br />
carry a personal responsibility for a portion of the cost of medical services<br />
he receives. Significant reductions in the proportion of the medical<br />
charge that will be met by the patient will be achieved by making substantial<br />
increases in both Commonwealth medical benefits and fund benefits. For<br />
our part we are proposing an overall increase of 30 per cent in<br />
Commonwealth medical benefits at a cost of $ 16 million a year.<br />
The health insurance funds will also increase their fund<br />
benefits and to do so small increases in the rates of contributions will be<br />
necessary. In most States these increases will not exceed 5 cents a week<br />
for a single person and 10 cents a week for a family contributor to the<br />
highest table available. In N. S. W. where doctors' charges are higher<br />
than in other States, an increase of 7 cents per single contributor and<br />
cents a week respectively for family contributors will be necessary. In<br />
order to simplify the scheme and to ensure an adequate coverage for<br />
contributors only one medical table will be available in each State when<br />
the new arrangement commences.<br />
The increased benefits will be applied selectively so that<br />
the biggest increases will be made for the high cost services where the<br />
need is greatest. We are confident that contributors will willingly accept<br />
the small increase in contribution rates in the knowledge that it will bring<br />
them a far better medical benefits coverage than they have ever had before.<br />
We are aiming at the following margin between total benefit<br />
entitlements and doctors' common fees:-<br />
General Practitioner Services<br />
Surgery consultations 80 cents<br />
Home visits<br />
Other services graduated up to<br />
For the more costly services the margin of $ 5 to be met by<br />
the patient will be as low as 2 per cent or 3 per cent of the cost of the service. </p>
