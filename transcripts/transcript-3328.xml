WHAT FUTURE FOR AUSTRALIA?<br />
BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON. E. G.-WHITLAM, M. P.<br />
In accepting The Australian's invitation to forecast the<br />
political and social trends of the next ten years, I must begin<br />
with a note of caution.' Special pleading and wishful thinking<br />
make politicians notoriously unreliable prophets.-Who would<br />
have predicted, when The Australian w~ as launched ten years ago.'<br />
the chronic political instability that was to follow the<br />
retirement of Sir Robert Menzies? Who would have foreseen the<br />
continuing rise of the D. L. P. and, more recently, its even more<br />
sudden and extraordinary demise? Who would have predicted,<br />
only 18 months ago, that a democratically elected Government,<br />
comfortably. installed with a working majority after 23 years<br />
in opposition, would be driven to the pqlls again half-way<br />
through its term, with important sections of its program<br />
under challenge?<br />
I do not wish to begin on too partisan a note. My point<br />
is simply that of all human activities, politics is the least<br />
predictable. Compared with the changes we have s'ten in Australia,<br />
the changes on the world scale in the past ten years have been<br />
incomparably more vast and far-reaching. Traditional forms of<br />
democratic government'are under challenge. The growth of world<br />
population, the depletion of the earth's natura. resources, man's<br />
new awareness of environmental hazards, rising crime rates,<br />
growing pollution,' greater civil and industrial unrest, worldwide<br />
inflation, a rising tendency to alienation and job dissatisfaction </p>
<p>-2-<br />
in industrial societies, and a growing recourse to violence as a<br />
political weapon all have compelled politicians to look afresh<br />
at their methods and priorities.<br />
Australia, however, is still happily insulated from many<br />
of the evils and neuroses afflicting other nations. That may<br />
seem an oddly complacent view to anyone who values internationalism;<br />
nevertheless, I take some comfort from it. There is a steadiness,<br />
an equanimity, a fundamental decency and good sense in our makeup<br />
that enables Us to look ahead with some confidence in our judgement<br />
and some faith in our power to do good. We are better placed than<br />
most nations to withstand the effects of any general economic or<br />
social hardship on a global scale. We are one of the few countries<br />
whose material and agricultural resources would make us self-sufficient<br />
in a global emergency. I do not for a moment suggest that<br />
self-sufficiency should be an aim of Australian policy; and<br />
it is true that our isolation has often deprived us of much that<br />
is good. I am inclined to believe, however, that in a world<br />
racked by uncertainty y3Lv iolence and mindless fanticism, the<br />
S advantages of our limited isolation still tend to outweigh the<br />
ills. For these reasons, therefore, I am an optimist -though a<br />
rather anxious one. I retain the humanist's belief in progress,<br />
in man's innate tendency to self-improvement. I retain the<br />
democrat's belief that this tendency is best directed through<br />
the forms of a free and open society. I retain the parliamentarian's<br />
belief that free societies are best governed through a two-party<br />
system, where the rights and procedures of open debate are reposed<br />
in elected legislatures. </p>
<p>-3<br />
In short,,, I believe that, in the absence of nuclear war,<br />
worldwide depression or a major environmental catastrophe,<br />
Australia will rc amn one of the world's more fortunate nations.<br />
I expect a steady rise in her standards of living and a more<br />
equitable sharing of the material benefits and opportunities of<br />
advanced civilisation. I see these conditions, not so much as<br />
ends in themselves, but as the essential pre-requisites for a<br />
fuller life. Real poverty is a poverty of the spirit; real<br />
riches consist in the enjoyment of non-material rewards, in<br />
the intellecttal, artistic and cultural opportunities available<br />
to free minds cultivated by a rational system of education.<br />
I believe) therefore, that party politics in the next ten<br />
years will be increasingly concerned with improvements in<br />
social and living standards. The debate will be not so much<br />
about whether change is desirable, but abgut the rate of change.<br />
This, indeed, is already happening. The traditional conservative<br />
parties will'be driven increasingly to accept the legitimate<br />
aspirations of free people for greater opportunities, greater<br />
equality, greater material security and higher standards of<br />
living. In other words, I see a steady shift to the left; and I<br />
believe that such a shift has been the dominant feature of<br />
democratic politics in the west since the end of World War II.<br />
Such a shift, of course, is accelerated by the election of<br />
radical) reformist. or left-of-centre governments. I have no doubt,<br />
for example, that our opponents have adopted more enlightened<br />
policies as a result of Labor's victories in 1972 and 1974.<br />
I believe the greatest danger in left-wing governments is their<br />
tendency to authoritarianism, and the greater danger in democratic<br />
conservative governments is their tendency to complacency. </p>
<p>4<br />
I have no doubt that the main problem for the Australian<br />
economy in the next 10 years will be the worldwide growth of<br />
inflation. It seems to me that growing populations, diminishing<br />
resources and ever-rising material expectations make a<br />
measure of inflation inevitable. Provided we devise machinery<br />
to protect the weaker members of society, and provided the burdens<br />
of sacrifice are fairly shared, it may be that the world will learn<br />
to live with inflation on a higher scale than it has known in the<br />
past. This does not mean that strong measures will not be needed<br />
to check inflation from time to time.<br />
I expect the Australian economy to become increasingly<br />
mixed; that is to say, the management of our resources will be<br />
more equally divided between government and private enterprise.<br />
Governments including local government, will be expected to provide<br />
more and more services sometimes because, private enterprise finds<br />
them unprofitable but more often because they have not in the past<br />
been provided at all. I believe private corporations will be<br />
submitted increasingly to public supervision in the interests<br />
Sof the nation as a whole, and that many of the abuses of<br />
unrestrained free enterprise will be checked. I have no doubt<br />
that the benefits of an advanced welfare state are fully<br />
compatible with those of an efficient and flourishing private<br />
sector. To my mind, capitalism is the best means yet devised for<br />
producing the material goods required by advanced societies;<br />
I therefore believe in free enterprise. At the same time, there<br />
can be no question that the injustices and inequalities of such<br />
societies must be redressed by government intervention; and<br />
for that reason I am a democratic socialist. </p>
<p>5<br />
I believe Australia will continue to live at peace with<br />
her neighbours aijl the world for the foreseeable future. I accept<br />
the advice of oui experts that no military threat is likely to<br />
Australia in the next 15 years. The same advice was given to our<br />
predecessors and accepted by them. I believe the next decade will<br />
see Australian politics further liberated from their old,<br />
stultifying preoccupation with ideological conflicts and cold war<br />
attitudes. Such a prospect is wholly encouraging. Australia will<br />
be better placed to play her natural role in Asia as a concerned,<br />
generous and enlightened neighbour.<br />
0 I do not envisage any dramatic increase in our, present<br />
population, and indeed I would not wish to see one. On the<br />
other hand, I expect to see a number of new cities well established<br />
in provincial regions during the next ten years or at least<br />
the confident beginnings of such cities. I expect vast improvements<br />
in our roads and railways, new child care centres and health<br />
centres, better hospitals and schools and improved standards of<br />
public and private housing. I believe that in 10 years we will<br />
O have fully accepted our responsibilities to the deprived and<br />
weaker sections of the community, and that the Aboriginal people<br />
of Australia will enjoy a new dignity and security.<br />
These assessments rest on the assumption that the major<br />
reforms undertaken by the present Government will be irreversible,<br />
and that even if the conservative parties are returned to power,<br />
there will be a continuing popular consencus in-favour of<br />
progressive policies. </p>
<p>-6<br />
In a world of totalitarian regimes and minority governments,<br />
such confidence may prove to be misplaced. I base it, however,<br />
on my expressed faith in the maturity and intelligence of the<br />
Australian electorate. I do not claim for the left a monopoly of<br />
wisdom and virtue, but I see in the Australian people a degree<br />
of sophistication and discernment that will lead them instinctively<br />
to political solutions founded in fair play, in justice, in<br />
moderation, and, I trust, in idealism.<br />
I look ahead to a society whose democratic foundations,<br />
nurtured in a political climate uniquely free of hysteria and<br />
' dogmatism, will be strengthened and refined. I believe the next.<br />
ten years will bring a fuller sense of national pride and purpose,<br />
a determination to preserve the national estate and maintain<br />
Australian control of our industries and resources. I believe<br />
we will cultivate a more mature and distinctive Australian identity,<br />
a m6re vigorous climate in the arts, and a generation of young<br />
Australians determined to reject all that is shoddy and spurious,<br />
second-rate and second-hand, whether at home or abroad. It may well<br />
be that these hopes for a sound democracy, for a proud peop le<br />
equipped to lead their lives to the full in security and peace,<br />
will1 not be realised in my lifetime. I cannot believe, however,<br />
that such a goal is beyond our means or beyond our abilities, or<br />
that the creation of a model society, an example to the world,<br />
is too lofty a vision for a strong and united people.<br />
