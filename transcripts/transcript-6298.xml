CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY<br />
AUSTRALIAA AY LUNCHEON<br />
26 JANUARY 1984<br />
I AM MOST GRATEFUL TO THE AUSTRALIA DAY COUNCIL<br />
FOR NEW SOUTH WALES FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE PART IN<br />
THE AUSTRALIA DAY CELEBRATIONS FOR THE FIRST TIME AS<br />
PRIME INISTER OF AUSTRALIA AND TO SPEAK AT THIS INAUGURAL<br />
AUSTRALIA DAY LUNCHEON. IN THIS GREAT CITY OF SYDNEY<br />
WHERE THE STORY OF NODERN AUSTRALIA BEGAN.<br />
I EMPHASISE THE WORD " MODERN" BECAUSE THERE<br />
COULD BE NO GREATER DELUSION. THAN THAT THE HUMAN STORY OF<br />
THIS CONTiNENT, AND INDEED, THE STORY OF HUMAN CULTURE AND<br />
CIVILISATION ON THIS CONTINENT, BEGAN ONLY ON THE<br />
26TH OF JANUARY 1788.<br />
THE RECOGNITION OF THIS FACT, AND ITS PRACTICAL<br />
EXPRESSION, WILL BE CRUCIAL TO THE SUCCESS AND SIGNIFICANCE<br />
OF THE BICENTENARY YEAR NOW ONLY FOUR YEARS AWAY.<br />
AND THE RECOGNITION OF THAT FACT IS QUITE<br />
FUNDAMENTAL IN GIVING TRUE MEANING TO THE THEME WHICH THE<br />
AUSTRALIA DAY COUNCIL FOR NEw SOUTH WALES HAS SET FOR THIS<br />
OCCASION THE THEMIE " ONE NATION ONE FUTURE". / 2 </p>
<p>-2-<br />
HERE, I AM SPEAKING NOT SIMPLY OF THE QUESTIONS<br />
OF THE ROLE AND RIGHTS OF THE AUSTRALIAN ABORIGINES,<br />
FUNDAM4ENTAL AS THOSE QUESTIONS ARE.<br />
I AM SPEAKING OF OUR OWN SENSE OF IDENTITY AS<br />
MODERN AUSTRALIANS# FOR IF WE PLACE OUR PRESENCE HERE IN THE LONGER<br />
PERSPECTIVE OF THOUSANDS OF YEARS OF THE HUMAN STORY AND<br />
THE HUMAN STRUGGLE IN THIS CONTINENT, WE CAN SEE HOW<br />
TRIVIAL AND IRRELEVANT BECOME CONSIDERATIONS OF ET-INIC<br />
ORIGIN OR FAMILY DESCENT IN DEFINING THE TRUE AUSTRALIAN.<br />
THAT IS A DEFINITION THAT DOES NOT DEPEND UPON<br />
A PLACE OR A DATE ON A B1RTH CERTIFICATE, OR EVEN ON A<br />
CERTIFICATE OF NATURALISATION.<br />
ONE THING AND ONE THING ONLY DEFINES AN<br />
AUSTRALIAN TODAY.<br />
AND THAT IS A COMMITMENT TO AUSTRAIA AND<br />
ITS FUTURE2 AND GIVEN THAT COMMITMENT, THE FAMILY OFF THE<br />
LAST PLANE IS AS AUSTRALIAN AS THE SEVENTH GENERATION<br />
DESCENDANT OF THE FIRST FLEET. ,/ 3 </p>
<p>-3-<br />
IT IS A CLICHE, BUT NO LESS TRUE, THAT MODERN<br />
AUSTRALIA IS A NATION OF IMMIGRANTS.<br />
IN SUCH A NATION, THERE CAN BE NO HIERARCHY OF<br />
AUSTRALIAN-NESS. THE COMMITMENT IS ALL.<br />
AND IT IS SUCH A COMMITMENT, MADE BY INDIVIDUALS.:<br />
AND BY THE GROUPS AND INTERESTS WHICH GO TO MAKE UP THE<br />
FABRIC OF OUR SOCIETY AND OUR NATION, WHICH LIES AT THE HEART<br />
OF THE ENDEAVOURS MADE OVER THE PAST YEAR NOT JUST BY<br />
MY GOVERNMENT, BUT THROUGHOUT THE COtMUNITY, TO BRING<br />
AUSTRALIA TOGETHER, TO WOflRK TOGCTICR TO ACHIEVE RESOLUTION<br />
lir' lHI T FhMiinnflls BenI BE T IN i ADIV nI CPICTO TliHE UIPnIliFFl', pl<br />
DIFFICULTIES, WE HAVE FACED TOGETHER AND STILL DO FACE<br />
TOGETHER. THE NEED FOR AN EFFORT TOWARDS NATIONAL<br />
RECONCILIATION, THE NEED FOR AUSTRALIANS TO BE BROUGHT<br />
TOGETHER AND TO WORK TOGETHER, IS SOMETHING I HAVE HELD AS<br />
FUNDAMENTAL THROUGHOUT MY PUBLIC CAREER.<br />
THE EXPERIENCE OF THE PAST YEAR NOT MINE MERELY,<br />
BUT AUSTRALIA'S EXPERIENCE CONFIRMS ME ABSOLUTELY IN THAT<br />
BELIEF. BUT MUCH MORE THAN THAT, IT UTTERLY CONFIRMS MY<br />
BELIEF THAT THE PEOPLE OF AUSTRALIA ARE CAPABLE OF A GENUINE<br />
RESPONSE TO THE CALL FOR CO-OPERATION AND RESTRAINT 10 MLET<br />
A CRISIS, AS MUCH IN PEACE AS IN WAR. 1 / 4 </p>
<p>WE HAVE BY NO MEANS OVERCOME ALL THE DIFFICULTIES.<br />
THE RECOVERY WHCH IS NOW CLEARLY UNDERWAYs WILL BE ALL BUT<br />
WORTHLESS UNLESS THERE IS A CONTINUATION OF THAT CO-OPERATION<br />
AND RESTRAINT, AND UNLESS THE SPIRIT EPITOMISED BY THE<br />
NATIONAL ECONOMIC SUMMIT CONFERENCE OF LAST APRIL CAN BE<br />
MADE A REAL PART OF THE AUSTRALIAN WAY OF DOING THINGS.<br />
BUT I DO BELIEVE WE CAN NOW SEE THE EVENTS AND<br />
" VELOPMENTS OF .983 IN THE WJDER PERSPECTIVE OF THEIR TRUE<br />
MEANING IN AUSTRALIA'S HISTORY,<br />
WE AS A GOVERNMENTo AND AS A COMMUNITY, HAVE<br />
NOT BEEN WORKING TOGETHER MERELY FOR A TEMPORARY Cr AD HOC<br />
SOLUTION OR DIMINUTION OF SOME OF THE PROBLEMS FACING<br />
MODERN AUSTRALIA IN THE LAST FEW YEARS OF ITS SECOND<br />
CENTURY. I RELIEVE OUR HISTORIC TASK HAS BEEN, AND OUR<br />
HISTORIC MISSION TOGETHER IN THE YEARS IMMEDIATELY AHEAD,<br />
IS TO PREPARE AUSTRALIA FOR THE FUTURE IN ITS THIRD CENTURY<br />
AND INDEED, ITS FUTURE IN THE 21ST CENTURY.<br />
UNLESS WE CAN TAKE THAT LONGER PERSPECTIVE, THE<br />
EFFORTS AND HARD WORK OF THE PAST YEAR WILL HAVE LITTLE<br />
ENDURING MEANING OR SIGNIFICANCE. </p>
<p>LET ME VERY BRIEFLY IDENTIFY WHAT I SEE AS THE<br />
FOUR GREAT CONTEMPORARY CHALLENGES FOR AUSTRALIA, FOR ITS<br />
GOVERNMENTS, ITS REPRESENTATIVE INSTITUTIONS AND ORGANISATIOINS<br />
AND THME PEOPLE AS A WHOLEo<br />
FIRST, THE QUESTION OF EMPLOYMENT AND UNEMPLOYMENT,<br />
LEVELS OF UNEMPLOYMENT ANYTHING LIKE THOSE OF THE PAST COUPLE<br />
OF YEARS, PARTICULARLY AMONG OUR YOUNG PEOPLE, CANNOT AND<br />
SHOULD NOT BE TOLERATEDø ALL OF US MUST GIVE THE HIGHEST<br />
PRIORITY TO TACKLING THIS PROBLEM. ALREADY IN THE EIGHT<br />
MONTHS FROM APRIL TO DECEMBER 1983 PROGRESS HAS BEEN MADE<br />
WITH EMPLOYMENT RISING DY OVER 158,000 JOBS A SHARP<br />
REVERSAL FROM THE IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING EIGHT MONTHS, WHEN<br />
OVER 146,000 JOBS WERE LOST. BUT EVEN WITH<br />
EXTRAORDINARILY RAPID AND SUSTAINED EMPLOYMENT GROWTH, ANY<br />
RETURN TO THE FULL EMPLOYMENT CONDITIONS OF THE POST-WAR<br />
GENERATION WILL BE A LONG, SLOW AND DIFFICULT PROCESS.<br />
THE GOVERNMENT'S POLICIES PROVIDE AN APPROPRIATE FRA, IEWORK<br />
AND SENSE OF DIRECTION, THE COMMUNITY AS A WHOLE MUST BE<br />
INVOLVED IN MAKING THEM WORK. THE WHOLE COMMUNITY, NOT<br />
JUST GOVERNMENTS, MUST FACE UP TO AND TACKLE THE UNEMPLOYMEN', T<br />
PROBLEM. ALL OF US MUST RECOGNISE AND ACCEPT OUR<br />
RESPONSIBILITIES IN THIS CRUCIAL AREA. p ,/ 6 </p>
<p>ø 6-<br />
SECONDLY, JUST AS WE HAVE TO TAKE ACCOUNT OF<br />
THE ECONOMIC REALITIES IMPOSED ON THE YOUNGER PEOPLE,<br />
SO WE HAVE TO PAY CLOSE ATTENTION TO THE ECONOMIC<br />
REALITIES FACING THE OLDER GENERATION. WE HAVE TO FACE<br />
THE FACT THAT WE ARE GOING TO LIVE IN A SOCIETY WITH AN<br />
AGEING POPULATION, PUT BLUNTLY, AN INCREASINGLY<br />
SMALLER PROPORTION OF THE POPULATION WILL BE IN<br />
EMPLOYMENT AND ABLE TO SUSTAIN THOSE IN RETIREMENT AFTER<br />
THEIR PRODUCTIVE EMPLOYMENT OR THOSE WITHOUT ANY<br />
EMPLOYMENT AT ALL. IT IS IMPERATIVE, THEREFORE, THAT<br />
WE CREATE CONCEPTS AND MECHANISMS GOVERNING OUR SOCIAL<br />
SECURITY SYSTEM WHICH WILL ENSURE THAT EXPENDITURES<br />
ARE MORE CLOSELY RELATED TO THE REAL NEEDS OF THE PEOPLE.<br />
,/ 7 </p>
<p>THIRDLY, WE WILL HAVE TO MEET THE CHALLENGE<br />
AND RISE TO THE OPPORTUNITIES -OFFERED BY THE INEVITABLE<br />
INTRODUCTION OF THE NEW TECHNOLOGY0 CLEARLY, OUR<br />
EDUCATION AND TRAINING PROGRAMS ARE CRUCIAL To AUSTRALIA'S<br />
A1DILITY TO BENEFIT FROM THE P3ROFOUND IREVOLUTION OF<br />
TECHNOLOGY, AND IT IS ESSENTIAL IF WE ARE TO M~' AXMISE<br />
OUR GROWTH PERFORMANCE, AND OUR LONGER TERM EMPLOYMENT<br />
PtKOSPECTS, THAT WE DO NOT TURN OUR FACE ON THE OPPORTUNITIES<br />
ASSOCIATED WITH T1ECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCEMENT. A COMMON<br />
THREAD RUNNING THROUGH THE EXPERIENCE OF THOSE COUNTRIES<br />
MOST SUCCESSFUL IN HANDLING TH-E INTRODUCTION OF MODERN<br />
TiECHNOLOGIESi HAS BEEN THE WILLINGNESS OF THE SOCIAL PARTNERSOF<br />
GOVERNMENT, UNIONS AND EMPLOYERS TO CONSULT WITH<br />
EACH OTHER AT THE'NATIONAL, INDUSTRY AND ENTERPRISE LEVELS.<br />
AS IN SO MANY OTHER VITAL AREAS, CO-OPERATION AND<br />
CONSULTATION ARE ESSENTIAL TO ENSURE THAT THE INTRODUCTION<br />
OF THE NEW TECHNOLOGY CAN BE ACCOMPLISHED IN A MANNER<br />
WHICH ENSURES THAT ALL AUSTRALIANS PARTICIPATE IN THE<br />
LONG TERM BENEFITS# I 1s8 </p>
<p>AND FOURTHLY AND THIS IS A CHALLENGE CLOSELY<br />
RELATED TO THE NEW TECHNOLOGICAL REVOLUTION MUST FP. r-<br />
THE CRIfICALLY IMPORTANT TASK OF GIVING GREATER SUBSTANCE<br />
TO OUR LINKS WITH THE ASIA-PACIFIC REGION, PARTICULARLY IN<br />
THE FIELD OF TRADE, AS THIS IS THE FASTEST-GROWING REGION<br />
OF THE WORLD ECONOMY, AND THE REGION IN WHICH AUSTRAL! A'S<br />
DESTINY HAS PLACED US FOREVER,<br />
I REFERRED EARLIER TO OUR QUEST FOR A NATIONAL<br />
IDENTITY. AT LEAST PART OF THAT QUEST LIES IN THE<br />
REALISATION OF WHERE WE ACTUALLY LIVE IN THE WIORLD, A<br />
REALISATION OF WHO ARE OUR NEIGHBOURS, A REALISATION OF OUR<br />
COMMON AND MUTUAL INTERESTS AND A REALISATION OF THE<br />
CONTRIBUTION WE HAVE TO MAKE TO THE PEACE AND PROSPERITY<br />
OF THIS REGION# You CAN BE ASSURED THAT THIS GREAT QUESTION WILL BE<br />
AT THE FOREFRONT OF MY CONCERNS IN THE MISSION I AM ABOUT<br />
TO UNDERTAKE TO HONG KONG, JAPAN, KOREA, CHINA., SINGAPORE<br />
AND MALAYSIAN AND INDEED, THE THEME OF " LIVING TOGETHER" i WHICH<br />
SOME YEARS AGO, WAS ORIGINALLY DECIDED UPON AS THE THEME FOR<br />
THE BICENTENARY YEAR, IS AS APPROPRIATE A STATEMENT OF OUR<br />
GOALS ABROAD AS OF OUR PURPOSE AT HOME. / 9<br />
t q. </p>
<p>o: " 9-<br />
iHE " LIVING TOGETHER" THEME WAS LATER REPLACED,<br />
OFFICIALLY, BY THE THEME: " THE AUSTRALIAN ACHIEVEMENT".<br />
I PERSONALLY RATHER REGRET THE OFFICIAL CHANGE.<br />
I BOW TO NONE IN MY PRIDE IN ALL THAT IS TRUE AND GOOD<br />
IN THE AUSTRALIAN ACHIEVEMENT.<br />
BUT IN THE FINAL ANALYSIS, IT WILL BE OUR ABILITY<br />
TO LIVE TOGETHER, TO WORK TOGETHER IN A GENUINELY<br />
MULTICULTURAL SOCIETY, AND A GENUINELY FREE AND OPEN<br />
SOCIETY, THE DEGREE TO WHICH WE CAN ACHIEVE DIVERSITY<br />
VW1THIN UNITY, THAT WILL SHAPE OUR FUTURE AND WHICH WILL<br />
INDEED BE THE FINEST AND TRUEST AUSTRALIAN ACHIEVEMENT<br />
OF ALL, </p>
