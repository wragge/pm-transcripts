FOR PRESS 18 AUGUST 1978<br />
SPEECH AT LACTOS FACTORY, BURNIE<br />
I appreciate this opportunity to be with you in Burnie this<br />
afternoon. It is a specially significant occasion.<br />
I understand the plant was almost wiped out in a disastrous<br />
$ 4 million fire on August 19 last year. That was just three<br />
days after last year's Budget.<br />
Well, you know what happened just three days ago in Canberra.<br />
Today, this wonderful new factory still stands indestructible.<br />
I would like to think of that as a good omen not only for<br />
Lactos, but for the Budget.<br />
The Budget faces up squarely and honestly to the facts of life<br />
in Australia today. At no time have we ever pretended that<br />
there were quick solutions to Australia's economic problems.<br />
We had to front up to, and take, hard decisions.<br />
It is easy to fudge, it is easy to pretend that a difficult<br />
situation does not exist. It is easy to spend money, to throw<br />
it around saying that will solve all problems.<br />
The Bud&amp;, et rejected that course. It's a responsible document<br />
that has faced up fairly and honestly to Australia's problems.<br />
This Budget has one overriding objective to build on the<br />
foundations already set for the longterm economic stability<br />
of Australia. We will do this by reducing inflation even<br />
further. This will make us more competitive here and overseas,<br />
set the conditions for a sustainable reduction in interest<br />
rates, and offer incentive to investors and create new job<br />
opportunities. Those who still claim that the Budget has done nothing to<br />
stimulate the economy, and to provide new job opportunities,<br />
miss the point. They see stimulus as equivalent to more<br />
Government spending and running the printing presses ever<br />
faster.<br />
Australia learnt, to our cost as some overseas countries<br />
have learnt to their cost what this kind of approach does to<br />
confidence and to inflation, and inevitably to employment<br />
prospects. ./ 2 </p>
<p>The real point is that by reducing inflation, by reducing interest<br />
rates, this itself will provide the greatest possible stimulus<br />
to the economy.<br />
No industry, no business, no manufacturer, no farmer is going<br />
to employ more people if they knowe prices and costs are going<br />
to keep rising rapidly and unpredictably.<br />
On the contrary, they are going to shed labour, pull in their<br />
horns. Reducing inflation and reducing interest rates will do more to<br />
help home buyers, pensioners, * businesses, farmers, exporters<br />
will do more for jobs than any other single act of government.<br />
Of coarse, there is another key area central to the problem of<br />
containing costs and providing jobs and that is wages.<br />
As the Treasurer made abundantly clear on Tuesday, the sharp<br />
increase in labour costs relative both to the price of output<br />
and the costs of other factors of production has encouraged<br />
firms to shed as much labour as they can.<br />
Clearly, companies have been replacing workers with machines;<br />
replacing full-time people with part-time people; replacing wage<br />
and salary earners with self-employed contract labour. They<br />
have been making do with less labour all around.<br />
Wage and salary earners know the score. They know the choices<br />
are perfectly plain.<br />
Union leaders can show greater sense and moderation in their<br />
wage and salary demands, or can continue to press for higher and<br />
higher wages for those in work at the expense of their mates<br />
looking for a job.<br />
If they opt for the latter something they have been doing<br />
then I can guarantee that unemployment will stay high.<br />
Moderation in wage demands is essential for a reduction in<br />
unemployment. This is an inescapable fact in modern economic<br />
life. It is one of the great tragedies of the modern. trade union<br />
movement that its leadership has not been prepared to seriously<br />
look at this question of moderation in wage demands.<br />
Surely the lessons of 1974, 1975, when wages went up by<br />
and consequently thousands of workers were priced out of jobs<br />
surely these lessons are still fresh in their minds.<br />
The Budget sets Australia clearly on the path to an inflation<br />
rate of five percent by June next year that is just 10 months<br />
away.<br />
That is not a claim I make2 . as Leader of the Government or as<br />
Prime Minister, but the official Treasury forecasts documented<br />
in Budget papers. </p>
<p>There is no doubt at all, that by the middle of next year,<br />
Australia's inflation rate will be the envy of our trading<br />
partners. Apart perhaps from Japan and West Germany, our inflation will<br />
be lower than most people we trade with. This is a remarkable<br />
achievement when you consider that when we first took office,<br />
inflation was running in the order of 15 percent or 16 percent.<br />
What will this mean for Australia?<br />
It will benefit every individual, every family, every farmer.<br />
It will provide new optimism, new spirit for our industries,<br />
our exporters.<br />
Our great industries our great rural industries will be<br />
more competitive both within Australia and on world markets.<br />
You all know what this will do for jobs, for confidence, for<br />
growth. Significantly of course it means that as a resource rich<br />
nation we will become a favoured nation for investment.<br />
Countries will be looking to Australia with low inflation,<br />
with-a-sound and stable economy as a resource supplier for<br />
years ahead.<br />
This is an appropriate time to make reference to Australia's<br />
great rural industries and to the Dairy industry.<br />
I have got little doubt that the strength and health of our<br />
rural industries affects the lives of every Australian. City<br />
and country are interdependent. If farmers are not producing,<br />
not selling, then they are not adding to their farms, not<br />
making improvements and not investing.<br />
This of course has direct impact on companies in the city<br />
producing farm machinery and equipment. But the horizon is<br />
changing for the farmer. For the first time in maybe a<br />
decade the men and women on the farms right throughout Australia<br />
are looking ahead with confidence. They are optimistic about<br />
the future.<br />
Clearly, the ' Key reason is the fall in inflation. No group<br />
feels the effects of raging inflation harder than farmers<br />
and the rural industries.<br />
Of course, there is confidence in rural communities for other<br />
reasons, sheep prices are reasonable, wheat and wool prices<br />
are good and the beef industry is now coming out of its trough.<br />
A bonus is that the damaging drought has broken for most of<br />
Australia. I think this gathering would be aware of the Government's support<br />
for the Australian Dairy Industry. We have strongly supported<br />
the industry by underwriting prices up to a level of 75 a<br />
pound butter fat this financial year. / 4 </p>
<p>We have allocated $ 17.4 million this financial year to cove~ r<br />
previous underwriting commitments.<br />
I know you are interested in Government policies and<br />
actions as they affect the fortunes of dairy farmers,<br />
and dairy factories. I think you all know of our vigour<br />
in seeking increased access for our agricultural products<br />
to the great markets of Japan, the European Economic<br />
Community, the United States, the Middle East and<br />
other markets. our attempt to gain increased access for<br />
agricultural goods has been recognised as fair and<br />
reasonable by other world leaders, and by the world press.<br />
President Carter recently wrote to me and said that he<br />
wouldn't consider the Multilateral Trade Negotiations<br />
in Geneva a success unless they lead us towards a<br />
significant liberalisation of world trade in<br />
agricultural products.<br />
We do not intend to desist from trying to get a fair go<br />
for Australia in the world's largest and richest market.<br />
I am sure that no-one in the rural community or people<br />
in the cities want us to stop trying. I think this<br />
industry exemplifies in stark terms the problems we face<br />
with the European Economic Community in particular.<br />
Domestic support policies overseas have led to increases in<br />
butter stocks, and continued high stocks of skim milk powder.<br />
This has led to a consequent lowering of international<br />
prices. Those policies have also stimulated increased<br />
production of cheese and whole milk powder with a similar<br />
depressing effect on prices. That's not an encouraging<br />
international market outlook.<br />
The cost of such policies is high. It costs taxpayers and<br />
consumers of the protectionist countries, who must bear the<br />
added tax burden and pay higher prices for food. It<br />
costs Australian industry, which is denied some export markets<br />
and must compete in others against subsidised productivity.<br />
On top of that, it costs the world in general, whose<br />
agricultural resources are misallocated from low-cost<br />
efficient producers to high-cost inefficient producers.<br />
The figures give a fair example of what I am talking about.<br />
The cost of the EEC's export subsidies on products competing<br />
with Australia's exports is about $ 4 billion per annum.<br />
The EEC's Common Agricultural Policy has the net effect of<br />
prohibiting imports, while subsidising exports. It throws<br />
the entire burden of adjustment of the high-cost suppliers<br />
in the EEC onto low-cost efficient suppliers such as<br />
Australia and such as this industry in Tasmania.<br />
A look at the cheese industry graphically illustrates my<br />
point. The EEC's support price of $ 2,250 per tonne for<br />
exports is more than twice the world price of $ 950 per tonne<br />
for cheddar cheese. As a result, Australia cannot export<br />
any cheese at all to the EEC. </p>
<p>On the other hand the EEC exported 4,000 tonnes of<br />
heavily subsidised cheese to Australia last year.<br />
Lactos and other aggressive marketing orientated Australian<br />
companies have been endeavouring to expand their<br />
production of speciality cheeses. I know the increasing<br />
presence of these low-priced imports has made this<br />
difficult. As a consequence we have asked the Industries Assistance<br />
Commission to inquire and report on the protection needs<br />
of the cheese industry.<br />
We want to be certain that the industry can produce with<br />
confidence an increased variety of fancy cheeses and obtain<br />
a reasonable share of this valuable growth market.<br />
We have been actively seeking reform of international<br />
trade in dairy products. We played a leading role in the<br />
dairy negotiations in Geneva. In the MTN negotiations,<br />
Australia is fighting for an international dairy agreement<br />
which would involve not just mimimum prices for milk powders,<br />
butter and butterfat but which would contain worthwhile<br />
provisions covering world trade in cheese. So far, we<br />
have been almost a lone voice in pressing to have<br />
cheese included.<br />
It is inexplicable, however, that cheese trade should not be<br />
included in a new dairy agreement. While our efforts<br />
relating to the EEC are most important, we are not<br />
pursuing them to the neglect of other markets, which we must<br />
protect and foster.<br />
I understand that the Lactos Factory is expecting to export<br />
around 2,500 tonnes of Gouda and 2,000 tonnes of Cheddar<br />
in the coming season to Japan. This is additional to its<br />
other specialty cheese exports to markets such as the U. S. A.<br />
We have a strong position as a supplier of dairy products<br />
to Japan. We must make every effort to make sure this<br />
position is protected and hopefully improved on.<br />
Overall, the international trade in dairy products is<br />
fraught with difficulties to which a great deal of<br />
negotiating is still being currently directed. As a<br />
significant exporter, these problems necessarily have a major<br />
impact on the Australian industry.<br />
It is to this Company's credit it has through energetic<br />
marketing and technological innovation been able to<br />
maximise its trading opportunities. There is little doubt<br />
that these facilities here reflect not only the personal<br />
success of Milan Vylnalek, but more broadly the success of<br />
a business enterprise that benefits the community, the State<br />
and the reputation of Australia as an enterprising exporter<br />
of rural products. </p>
<p>6<br />
This is a great day for the Lactos Company. It is most<br />
pleasing to welcome friends from Japan especially from<br />
Snow Brand, the Company's largest export customer and<br />
friends from the United States.<br />
Lactos and Snow Brand formed their present close association<br />
in the early 1970' s when the two companies signed a contract<br />
for Lactos to manufacture Gouda cheese to Snow's<br />
specifications. In record time, Lactos designed and built probably the<br />
world's first completely automated Gouda plant with an<br />
annual capacity of 3,000 tonnes of show-type Gouda.<br />
The plant was officially opened in 1972 and Lactos became<br />
the largest Australian supplier of Gouda cheese for Japan.<br />
Although other companies have since entered the Japanese<br />
market, Lactos continues as a major and expanding supplier<br />
to Snow Brand and I understand Snow Brand executives have<br />
stated publicly that they regard Lactos Gouda as the best<br />
obtainable from any world source. That's a compliment to<br />
the Company, and to the dairy industry in this great State.<br />
Let us not underestimate this achievement. Here is an<br />
Australian company in a highly specialised market making<br />
a quality product competitive with the best in the world.<br />
Surely there is a special and relevant message for the<br />
retailers gathered here today.<br />
The Government has a policy of buying Australian goods.<br />
Should not Australian companies, Australian retailers<br />
wherever they can support local producers like Lactos,<br />
who are producing world class products. Let us not<br />
belittle what we can do in Australia.<br />
Not only will this kind of decision add to our economy, but<br />
will greatly increase community awareness of, and national<br />
pride in, Australian skills, achievements and potential.<br />
The Government, in the Budget, launched what we call " Project<br />
Australia" and we will be looking for support from all<br />
sections of the community in this great national endeavour.<br />
We want to recreate a real feeling of pride, of achievement,<br />
of community spirit, so that what we make will be more<br />
eagerly sought by consumers here and overseas.<br />
Today in Burnie on this site is a good place to start for all<br />
you retailers. Here are world class products produced on our<br />
own doorstep. Let us get behind companies just like Lactos<br />
and make " Project Australia" a living and vital thing. / 7 </p>
<p>V 7<br />
Mr. Chairman, I think we would all agree that it is a<br />
remarkable achievement to restore from the ashes<br />
" Phoenix-like", this wonderful new factory, which I<br />
understand is the second largest of its kind in<br />
Australia. The investment in new plant, equipment, and people, is<br />
real proof of this Company's confidence in the future<br />
of the cheese market. But perhaps more important, it<br />
is a strong demonstration of this Company's confidence<br />
in the future of Australia. 000---</p>
