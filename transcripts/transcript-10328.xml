PRIME MINISTER<br />
US PRESIDENTIAL REPRESENTATIVES<br />
AUSTRALIA-AMERICA FRIENDSHIP WEEK<br />
I warmly welcome President Clinton's announcement that Mr Philip bader<br />
and Ambassador Genta Hawkins Holmes will be his personal representatives<br />
for Australia-America Friendship Week. Mr Lader will be known to many<br />
Australians as a former President of Bond University. Mr Lader is a<br />
successfiul businessman and educator and served as White House Deputy<br />
Chief of Staff in the Clinton Administration during 1992-93.<br />
Mr Lader and Ambassador Hawkins Holmes will participate in various<br />
Friendship Week activities and attend a number of Battle of the Coral Sea<br />
commemorative events from 2-10 May.<br />
The Battle of the Coral Sea was fought in May 1942 and proved to be a<br />
turning point of the war in the South Pacific. It laid the foundation for the<br />
Australian-American alliance. Fifty-five years on our partnership<br />
continues to serve regional and global stability and prosperity and is<br />
testimony to the strong bonds of friendship between the United States and<br />
Australia.<br />
4 May 1997 </p>
