FOR MEDIA WEDNESDAY, 15 APRIL 1981<br />
M. A. N. S. STUDY<br />
( Letter to NSW Premier)<br />
The attached letter has been sent to the Premier<br />
of New South Wales, Mr Wran. </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER CANBERRA<br />
APR 18<br />
My dear Premier, It is now more than four years since we<br />
agreed to the formation of a joint committee of<br />
Commonwealth and State officials to conduct the<br />
Major Airport Needs of Sydney ( MANS) Study. The<br />
committee's task was to review the likely future<br />
regular public air transport needs of the Sydney<br />
region and to recommend to the two Governments a<br />
suitable strategy for airport development, including<br />
associated surface access and land use.<br />
During this period the MANS Committee has<br />
made available to our Governments and to the general<br />
public a number of documents setting out the results<br />
of the various investigations and analyses undertaken.<br />
The last of these documents was the Abstract Report,<br />
incorporating specific recommendations, submitted<br />
by the Commonwealth members of the MANS Committee in<br />
December 1979. Since then the Commonwealth has been<br />
unable to advance the dialogue further.<br />
There are two major and distinctly separate<br />
matters to be urgently resolved. They are:<br />
1. the determination and securing of a suitable<br />
site for the construction of a second airport<br />
of international standard in the vicinity of<br />
Sydney to meet the contingent demands of the<br />
community from the end of the century and beyond.<br />
Such an undertaking would take between 12 and<br />
years to complete. It would involve, in<br />
1981 values, a cost of at least $ 700 million<br />
and the expenditure of very large amounts in<br />
the development of surface access. There<br />
would also be substantial compensation for<br />
dwellings and other buildings demolished<br />
en route.<br />
2. the provision of adequate facilities in the<br />
Sydney area to \ meet the expanding needs of<br />
Kingsford Smith Airport during the substantial<br />
period which must inevitably elapse before a<br />
new international airport is operable. </p>
<p>I stress that the two are not alternatives.<br />
They are mutually complementary. There must be a<br />
long-term development of -a new. airport associated<br />
with a much more immediate expansion of existing<br />
airport facilities. Sydney will continue,**-to suffer a growing<br />
loss of tourist activity as the result of the<br />
necessary diversion of international aircraft to<br />
either Melbourne or Brisbane. There will also be a<br />
detrimental effect on freight operations. This<br />
diversion will increase unless appropriate facilities<br />
are speedily provided.<br />
Perhaps even more important, since it<br />
vitally affects New South Wales country-dwellers,<br />
is the fact that the limitation of existing facilities<br />
at Kingsford Smith Airport will soon cause a severe<br />
cutback in commuter aircraft from that airport.<br />
Moreover, more than 30 per cent of commuter<br />
passengers hold tickets for connecting flights for<br />
other destinations. There is the very urgent question, too,<br />
of the provision of ground facilities for the early<br />
introduction of wide-bodied aircraft on domestic<br />
routes. The provision of these facilities cannot be<br />
appropriately planned for unless the long-term<br />
strategies for Kingsford Smith Airport are resolved.<br />
All these matters have been well known forsome<br />
years. The only practical solution which has<br />
been advanced has been the MANS Committee proposal<br />
for a close-spaced parallel runway at Mascot.<br />
Your own Government has focussed solely<br />
upon the identification of possible sites for the<br />
longer-term second airport. It has offered no solution<br />
to the needs of Sydney during the intervening period.<br />
The Commonwealth Government is deeply<br />
concerned at the likely detrimental consequences to<br />
the people of New South Wales if the current impasse<br />
is allowed to continue.<br />
Both the long-term and short-term issues<br />
require the close co-operation of both Commonwealth<br />
and State Governments for their resolution.<br />
My Government is convinced that the<br />
recommendation of the'-Commonwealth members of the<br />
MANS Committee for the immediate planning for the<br />
construction of a close-spaced parallel runway is<br />
the only possible solution to the most urgent of<br />
the two problems. 3. </p>
<p>I invite you and your Government, therefore,<br />
Sto. co-operate with the Commonwealth in the determination<br />
of a site for a future second airport and in the<br />
rapid development of the close-spaced parallel runway.<br />
Yours sincerely, N<br />
Fraser)<br />
The Hon. N. Wran, M. L. A.,<br />
Premier of New South Wales,<br />
SYDNEY N. S. W. 2000 </p>
