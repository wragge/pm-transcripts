    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Commonwealth Government will invest $57 million to list breakthrough melanoma drug KeytrudaÂ® on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme.</p>
<p>This will improve quality of life for 1,100 Australian patients and make the $150,000 per year treatment affordable.</p>
<p>The listing follows passage of the Governmentâs PBS reform package through the Senate last week and delivers on our promise to list new medicines as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>It complements $1.3 billion from the 2015/16 Budget for other melanoma medicines as well as drugs to treat breast cancer, blindness and shingles.</p>
<p>Treatment using pembrolizumab (KeytrudaÂ®) currently costs patients with metastatic melanoma up to $156,130 per year without taxpayer subsidy through the PBS.</p>
<p>Patients will now pay $6.10 if they are concessional patients or $37.70 for general patients.</p>
<p>Since coming to office, the Commonwealth has now approved 667 new and amended listings to the PBS, with a benefit of almost $3 billion to Australian patients.</p>
<p>This compares with only 331 new listings in Laborâs final term.</p>
<p>Todayâs announcement demonstrates the importance of ensuring that spending on existing drugs is as efficient as possible, so breakthrough medicines like KeytrudaÂ® can continue to be listed.</p>
<p>Treatment will be made available on the PBS from 1 September, 2015.</p>
<p>All PBS listings are subject to final arrangements being agreed with suppliers of the medicine, including risk share arrangements.</p>
<p>Since coming to office in September 2013, the Commonwealth has listed the following medicines, among others, on the PBS:<br />
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â <br />
â¢Â Soliris (2014) â Atypical Haemolytic-Uraemic Syndrome (rare immune disease) â $63 million â $500,000 per patient if not subsidised through the PBS<br />
â¢Â Kayldeco (2014) â Cystic Fibrosis â $174 million â $300,000 per patient if not subsidised through the PBS<br />
â¢Â Mekinist (2015) â BRAF-positive Metastatic Melanoma â $437 million â $131,000 per patient if not subsidised through the PBS<br />
â¢Â Adcetris (2014) â Lymphoma â $15.2 million â over $110,000 per patient if not subsidised through the PBS<br />
â¢Â Perjeta, Herceptin and Kadcyla (2015) â Breast Cancer â $191 million combined â $82,000 per patient if not subsidised through the PBS<br />
â¢Â Crizotinib (2015) â Lung Cancer â $60 million â $80,000 per patient if not subsidised through the PBS<br />
â¢Â Lemtrada (2015) â Relapsing, Remitting Multiple Sclerosis â $50 million â $70,000 per patient if not subsidised through the PBS<br />
â¢Â Abraxane (2014) â Pancreatic Cancer â $92 million â $16,000 per patient if not subsidised through the PBS<br />
â¢Â Lucentis (2015) â Retinal Vein Occlusion (RVO) and Diabetic Macular Oedema (DME) (blindness) â $541 million â $10,000 per patient if not subsidised through the PBS</p>
<p>Listing these medicines on the PBS means patients pay just the PBS co-payment, with taxpayers covering the difference in the cost of treatment. For example, a patient using Soliris â which costs $500,000 per patient â now pays just $6.10 if they are a concession card holder or $37.70 if they are a general patient as a result of the drug being listed on the taxpayer-funded PBS.</p>
