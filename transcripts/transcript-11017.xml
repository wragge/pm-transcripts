<p>PILKINGTON:</p>
<p>Joining us on the programme on this morning after the Federal Budget,</p>
<p> Prime Minister John Howard. Prime Minister, good morning.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Good morning. Nice to talk to you both again.</p>
<p>McCLUSKY:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, can I ask you first off - this looks like a magnificent</p>
<p> budget, there's something in it for almost everybody, an extremely</p>
<p> healthy surplus - how much of it, though, is a wish list that is determined</p>
<p> on the passage of the GST and how much of it can we take as absolutely</p>
<p> guaranteed?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, the GST doesn't start until the 1st of July</p>
<p> in the year 2000 and this is a budget for the next 12 months so the</p>
<p> idea that it's dependent on the GST is wrong. That is not to</p>
<p> say that we don't want the GST passed and that's not to</p>
<p> say that we don't have a mandate to have it passed and that it's</p>
<p> very important to Australia's long-term future. But this budget</p>
<p> is separate from the GST.</p>
<p>PILKINGTON:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, the earlier reaction of Senator Harradine, I mean,</p>
<p> from the bit we saw on television and heard on the radio last night</p>
<p> it didn't seem to be all that encouraging from your point of</p>
<p> view.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Tony, I'm not going to conduct a dialogue with Senator Harradine</p>
<p> or, indeed, anybody else through a radio programme, even one as esteemed</p>
<p> as yours. If I have something to say to Senator Harradine then I'll</p>
<p> talk to him directly. I don't make a habit of responding to interpretations</p>
<p> of what he said or what he's said any more than he does to me.</p>
<p> So I'll just let that question pass.</p>
<p>PILKINGTON:</p>
<p>So, Prime Minister, when will you actually meet him face to face?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, once again, I don't provide details of who I see. Everybody</p>
<p> knows that from time to time I talk to Senator Harradine, I talk to</p>
<p> other Senators and we'll just leave it at that.</p>
<p>McCLUSKY:</p>
<p>Now, Prime Minister, let's go through some of the initiatives.</p>
<p> And certainly I think in terms of extending the work-for-the-dole,</p>
<p> a lot of people would applaud that. On the other hand, exactly what</p>
<p> is there in this budget that creates jobs?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, strong economic growth.</p>
<p>McCLUSKY:</p>
<p>So what areas are you suggesting we'll see that growth...?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, we've seen strong economic growth in just about every sector</p>
<p> of the economy. And we have created 400,000 jobs in the last three</p>
<p> years. We do have an unemployment rate, which although it is still</p>
<p> much too high, is the lowest in 10 years. And if we can maintain strong</p>
<p> economic growth we can at least maintain the gains on the unemployment</p>
<p> front, perhaps have some more, but we could go a lot further on the</p>
<p> unemployment front if we could get the Senate to agree to our unfair</p>
<p> dismissal legislation, our proposals to entrench youth wages and further</p>
<p> liberalisation of the labour market. The Senate, the Labor Party and</p>
<p> the Democrats in the Senate have got to face the reality that you</p>
<p> can only go so far in reducing unemployment with economic growth.</p>
<p> There comes a point where the structural impediments in the labour</p>
<p> market stop you going further. And we are fast approaching that point.</p>
<p> We would like to go further but we are hamstrung and we've tried</p>
<p> and we'll keep trying. But the spotlight now is really on the</p>
<p> Senate if it wants further reductions in unemployment to pass that</p>
<p> unfair dismissal legislation which would be a boom to small business.</p>
<p>McCLUSKY:</p>
<p>So you're suggesting given [inaudible] and the strong economic</p>
<p> performance that we could see job creation across the board.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes, I am, but we could see a lot more if we could get these other</p>
<p> reforms as well. I mean, the economy now is as strong as its been</p>
<p> for 30 years and we have a heaven sent opportunity if we can grasp</p>
<p> the reform nettle in areas like taxation and industrial relations</p>
<p> to make further reforms. The best time to reform something is when</p>
<p> you're doing well. And we're doing well now because we reformed</p>
<p> things a few years ago. There's a tendency for people to say,</p>
<p> Âgee, everything's going well, what do you need tax reform</p>
<p> for?'</p>
<p>McCLUSKY:</p>
<p>Well, certainly that's the Opposition's argument...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>But you need tax reform now so that everything will keep doing well.</p>
<p> Because if you just relax and say, Ârighto, she'll be right</p>
<p> mate, we've fixed it all, we've got a decent surplus, we</p>
<p> won't worry about any more reform,' in a few years time</p>
<p> something will come along and our economy will be more vulnerable</p>
<p> than might otherwise have been the case and people will then say,</p>
<p> Âwhy didn't you protect us against this?' Now, we're</p>
<p> trying to protect Australia against some adverse development by undertaking</p>
<p> further reform. And we live in a global economy and you just have</p>
<p> to keep working away at making the country more competitive.</p>
<p>PILKINGTON:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, on the education issue, there's no new money</p>
<p> for government schools...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes there is.</p>
<p>PILKINGTON:</p>
<p>There is.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes there is. Yeah, well, there's new money for government schools</p>
<p> from two sources. The literacy and numeracy programmes provide you</p>
<p> money for both government and independent schools but on top of that</p>
<p> most of the money that goes to government schools comes from the States.</p>
<p> And people who just compare the amount of money the Federal Government</p>
<p> gives to government schools and the amount of money the Federal Government</p>
<p> gives to independent schools, that is really a dishonest comparison.</p>
<p> Because the arrangement in Australia is that the great bulk of the</p>
<p> funding in government schools comes from the States. The Federal Government</p>
<p> provides assistance on a basis, generally speaking, of need for independent</p>
<p> schools. And on then on top of that the Federal Government also provides</p>
<p> funds for both government and independent schools for general programmes</p>
<p> like literacy and numeracy, Asian language instruction and so forth.</p>
<p> Now, there have been increases in those latter areas for both government</p>
<p> and independent schools but the States are getting five per cent more</p>
<p> in general revenue grants from the Commonwealth this year and they</p>
<p> have more resources as a result of that to pour into government schools.</p>
<p> So, in no way are the government schools being short-changed by us.</p>
<p>McCLUSKY:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, talking about that literacy plan. I mean, how much</p>
<p> are you tipping in and effectively what will it mean, what would it</p>
<p> mean for primary school kids here in South Australia?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>It basically remedies a deficiency. There are too many children leaving</p>
<p> primary school education without basic literacy and numeracy.</p>
<p>McCLUSKY:</p>
<p>You're quite right.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>And it's designed to remedy that. And there are certain national</p>
<p> benchmarks that have been established and we hope that over a period</p>
<p> of time we'll be able to improve that. And the literacy and numeracy</p>
<p> that we promised in the election campaign an additional $131 million</p>
<p> over four years, we're going to put $84 million for the early</p>
<p> years Â that's the first four years of schooling Â</p>
<p> and $47 million for the middle years Â that's years five</p>
<p> to ten. And what this means is that over the four-year period, then</p>
<p> next quadrennial, you'll have a record $869 million coming from</p>
<p> the Federal Government for literacy and numeracy. Now, bear in mind</p>
<p> - and I do have, as Prime Minister and Leader of the Federal Government,</p>
<p> have to make this point Â that if the State government system</p>
<p> and the independent system have been fully doing its jobs you wouldn't</p>
<p> need this. And this is really additional money that the Federal Government</p>
<p> is providing over and above the money provided by the States to really</p>
<p> top up because we believe that literacy and numeracy is fundamental.</p>
<p> We're also providing money for teacher education to improve the</p>
<p> skills of teachers. That's not meant critically because, like</p>
<p> all of us, we have to update. Teachers are no different. And we're</p>
<p> putting about $78 million to update teachers' skills. And this,</p>
<p> of course, will be available to teachers in both the government and</p>
<p> independent sector.</p>
<p>PILKINGTON:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, from South Australia's point of view it would</p>
<p> seem that some of the big winners here would have to be the rural</p>
<p> communities. I notice there's been a package to help create jobs</p>
<p> and also assist some of the local communities.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, all of the rural communities of Australia benefit. There's</p>
<p> the job creation schemes you spoke of. There are the 30 regional health</p>
<p> centres. Now, these are multipurpose establishments. They provide</p>
<p> normal GP facilities, some acute care beds. They provide some nursing</p>
<p> home capacity. In other words, they're a sort of a ÂJoseph</p>
<p> coat' of medical services. And they are multipurpose care units</p>
<p> appropriate for small populations because small country towns often</p>
<p> can't support an entire nursing home or an entire general practice</p>
<p> but they can support a combined facility which brings all of these</p>
<p> services together. And we're going to fund the establishment</p>
<p> of 30 of them around Australia.</p>
<p>McCLUSKY:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, can I ask you - talking about health and those sorts</p>
<p> of issues, private health insurance - a bit of a hoary old chestnut.</p>
<p> A lot of people seem very concerned and on their first reading of</p>
<p> it they're saying, hang on, I was in - for example, somebody</p>
<p> in their early 50s - I was in private health insurance for 20 odd</p>
<p> years, unfortunately I couldn't afford it, I had to bail out.</p>
<p> For me to go back in now, are you saying effectively I'm going</p>
<p> to be penalised?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, you've got 12 months, if you're aged 50, you've</p>
<p> got 12 months period of grace to go back in at no penalty. And then</p>
<p> after that 12-month period the penalty begins to apply if you are</p>
<p> between 30 and 65. If you are 65 and over you can join at the normal</p>
<p> rate even if you have not been in before. But the purpose of this</p>
<p> is really to encourage people to join much earlier. And the reason</p>
<p> that they will be encouraged is that if they leave it then they will</p>
<p> have to pay a penalty. But that penalty doesn't begin to apply until</p>
<p> the elapsing of a 12-month grace period.</p>
<p>McCLUSKY:</p>
<p>Okay. So let's be clear on that if we can, Prime Minister, so 12 months</p>
<p> from when? 12 months from today do I have, for example?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>McCLUSKY:</p>
<p>All right. So 12 months from today if I am in that bracket, anywhere</p>
<p> between 30 and 65, I can still go back into a health fund and not</p>
<p> be penalised. 12 months from today I will pay a premium if I make</p>
<p> that decision.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes, if you are not over 65.</p>
<p>McCLUSKY:</p>
<p>And if you are over 65....</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, if you are over 65 you are in the clear.</p>
<p>McCLUSKY:</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>PILKINGTON:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, we have had a lot of calls while we have been talking</p>
<p> to you about the Alice to Darwin rail link. How much money is in that</p>
<p> could be....</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, no less, it's the same amount, the $100 million that I promised.</p>
<p>PILKINGTON:</p>
<p>It's still there - still on the table.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Oh, that is absolutely, that is absolutely still on the table. And</p>
<p> we have made, you know, absolutely no change to that and we remain</p>
<p> committed. And the...it's just one of those commitments that is</p>
<p> completely unaffected.</p>
<p>McCLUSKY:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, just on that, what's the timeframe on that, it seems</p>
<p> to have gone all very quiet?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, we are waiting really for the bids. All the bids and the people</p>
<p> who are, you know, interested in supporting it.</p>
<p>McCLUSKY:</p>
<p>Right. In tendering for it.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Tendering for it. But the Commonwealth Government's commitment remains</p>
<p> absolutely rock solid. We have absolutely no intention whatever of</p>
<p> walking away from that $100 million commitment. And, I mean, I...it's</p>
<p> not the sort of thing that would have been, in the natural order of</p>
<p> things, would have been mentioned in the...in a budget speech because</p>
<p> we are not altering a previous commitment that was made.</p>
<p>McCLUSKY:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, I think a lot of people would be pleased to see that</p>
<p> we are actually spending a significant amount of money updating our</p>
<p> computer systems in the fight against crime.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes, that's a promise that was made in the election campaign, to establish</p>
<p> a national database, a DNA base. It's CrimTrac. It was, in fact, a</p>
<p> proposal that was originally raised directly with me by the Commissioner</p>
<p> of Police in New South Wales. I can remember him talking to me actually</p>
<p> at a football match about this. And we talked at some length about....</p>
<p>McCLUSKY:</p>
<p>It sort of makes sense doesn't it?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, of course it makes sense. I mean, this country, I mean, we are</p>
<p> one jurisdiction, although we are six States and two Territories,</p>
<p> people flow freely across our State borders and you need a national</p>
<p> database, you need a capacity to trace people. And Peter Ryan said</p>
<p> to me that the experience of many of the English police forces had</p>
<p> been that the establishment of this database led to a very significant</p>
<p> reduction in crime because you could immediately trace people and</p>
<p> they needed an injection of money. Now, we could have argued about</p>
<p> whether it was a State responsibility or not but I decided in the</p>
<p> last election campaign to promise a Federal Government contribution</p>
<p> to get the thing going and we have honoured that. May I say that one</p>
<p> of the things that makes me particularly proud about this Budget is</p>
<p> that we have honoured all of the promises that were made at the time</p>
<p> of the last election. I mean, we have been able...I mean, I have</p>
<p> been able to say to the Australian public, we made all of these commitments</p>
<p> at the time of the last election and we are now able to say to the</p>
<p> Australian public that all of those commitments are going to be honoured</p>
<p> and they are going to be honoured in full.</p>
<p>Can I just, before we duck onto something else, can I just go back.</p>
<p> The answer I gave you earlier about when that grace period ran from</p>
<p> I was slightly in error. It runs from the 1st of July this</p>
<p> year, not from today. So that's really a bit longer but I wouldn't</p>
<p> want any of your listeners to be in any doubt. But what the situation</p>
<p> is, if you are in that age bracket, say 32 - 65, you have got a 12</p>
<p> month period during which you can join at the going rate without penalty.</p>
<p> And after that 12 months has elapsed you begin, if you then join after</p>
<p> that 12 month period from the 1st of July this year, you</p>
<p> then begin paying the two per cent penalty. Now, that is fair because</p>
<p> we are giving people more than 12 months notice. And if they then</p>
<p> don't take up the opportunity but later decide well they've been warned</p>
<p> I think it will help underpin public support for private health insurance.</p>
<p> Add it to the 30 per cent rebate, it will....</p>
<p>McCLUSKY:</p>
<p>That stays in place does it?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Oh yes. Absolutely. Oh yes, we won't alter that.</p>
<p>PILKINGTON:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, in the battle against drugs and against major crime</p>
<p> and computer crime, is there anything in the Budget whereby we'll</p>
<p> be able to increase the number of Australian Federal Police?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes. There are more resources going to the Federal Police. The question</p>
<p> of exactly how those additional resources are deployed are really</p>
<p> some degree operational matters for the police. But we have increased</p>
<p> the number of strike teams. We are providing more money for further</p>
<p> placement of AFP officers in South East Asian countries, close to</p>
<p> the source of drugs coming into Australia. We are spending $500 million</p>
<p> in our campaign against drugs. We are giving money to law enforcement.</p>
<p> We are giving money to education and we are also giving a lot more</p>
<p> money to treatment of addicts. When I was in Adelaide recently I went</p>
<p> to the Adelaide Central Mission and talked directly for some time</p>
<p> to a number of people who were being treated there. And the strongest</p>
<p> message I got from those people who were fighting the drug habit,</p>
<p> and a number of them successfully, was that there was a critical shortage</p>
<p> of health and immediate facilities for people who made the decision</p>
<p> to give up drugs. One person said to me, if you decide to kick the</p>
<p> habit you have got to be able to go somewhere and get immediate help</p>
<p> because you mightn't have the resolve in two weeks time when the help</p>
<p> is available.</p>
<p>Now, that made a lot of sense to me. It must be an extremely difficult</p>
<p> thing to break a habit. I mean, some people find it hard to give up</p>
<p> smoking. I mean, when I gave up smoking 20 years ago I had sort of</p>
<p> tried it a half a dozen times earlier and then finally did it. And</p>
<p> I mean, that's a relatively minor thing compared with, well it's a</p>
<p> totally minor thing, compared with breaking a heroin habit. It must</p>
<p> be horrific. And if somebody has the conviction and the urge to do</p>
<p> it they ought to be able to get immediate help.</p>
<p>Now, there has been a gap in this in the past. It has in the past</p>
<p> been predominantly a State responsibility but we are putting a lot</p>
<p> more money into that. And what we are saying to that States is, we'll</p>
<p> provide money for treatment and we want to set up a national diversion</p>
<p> approach whereby people who are, sort of, just on the edges of a criminal</p>
<p> justice system are effectively given the option. You have treatment</p>
<p> or you run the risk of getting into the criminal justice system. And</p>
<p> the States have reacted very well to this. By and large there is an</p>
<p> enormous common ground between the Commonwealth and all the States.</p>
<p> There is a lot of publicity in areas where there is some disagreement</p>
<p> like heroin trials and shooting galleries and so forth but that really</p>
<p> is not the major area of focus although it gets a lot of media attention.</p>
<p>McCLUSKY:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, can I ask you, I know the clock is against us this</p>
<p> morning and clearly you are very busy. I just want to be clear on</p>
<p> this because everything that we have been reading this morning and</p>
<p> I think that the public has been hearing has talked about the passage</p>
<p> of the GST. You are telling us that everything we are reading, all</p>
<p> of the promises which have been made will be delivered regardless</p>
<p> of whether or not that GST legislation...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
