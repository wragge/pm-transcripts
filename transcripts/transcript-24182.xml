    <content><![CDATA[<p><strong>CHRIS UHLMANN:</strong></p>
<p>Tony Abbott, why should you continue to lead the Liberal Party and the nation?</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER:</strong></p>
<p>Chris, the last thing we want is to see another meltdown in government. We had meltdowns under the former government. It was, frankly, a bit embarrassing. It wasnât right. It wasnât good for our country, and I think it is very important that we avoid that with this Government. That said, obviously itâs a pretty chastening experience to have a spill motion moved on you after just 16 months in government â a very chastening experience â and I am determined that my Government, if it continues after tomorrow, will learn from this experience, will be different and better this year than we were in every respect last year.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS UHLMANN:</strong></p>
<p>Prime Minister, this is already embarrassing. You already look like the Labor Party to everyone, perhaps, but you.</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER:</strong></p>
<p>No, when you roll a prime minister, you look like the Labor Party.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS UHLMANN:</strong></p>
<p>That could happen?</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER:</strong></p>
<p>It could. Obviously, I respect the Party Room. I absolutely respect the Party Room and the Party Room will be getting a secret ballot tomorrow so that the result tomorrow will be something that accurately reflects views inside the Party Room.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS UHLMANN:</strong></p>
<p>But if you are binding Ministers, which it appears you are, then it doesnât accurately reflect everyoneâs view because 35 votes are already in the can, arenât they?</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER:</strong></p>
<p>Well, itâs entirely up to Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries how they voteâ¦</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS UHLMANN:</strong></p>
<p>So, you think that they should have a free vote?</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER:</strong></p>
<p>Well, it is a secret ballot. Now, I would expect that if a Minister was incapable of supporting the Government, the Minister in question would have spoken to me and none of them have. But, nevertheless, this is an opportunity for people to do what they genuinely believe is right for the Government and for the country.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS UHLMANN:</strong></p>
<p>You have said that you are chastened, that you have learnt from this experience. Are you bargaining for votes? Have you offered Senator Sean Edwards from South Australia an open tender for the subs contract which would be a change of policy?</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER:</strong></p>
<p>No. What we have always intended to have is a competitive evaluation process. Thatâs what weâve always intended to have...</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS UHLMANN:</strong></p>
<p>But we didnât know that until today.</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER:</strong></p>
<p>Well, we are still a long way from doing this. I mean, the decision on this needs to be made by the end of the year, I would say, at the latest, but nevertheless it is something which is still evolving, as youâd expect.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS UHLMANN:</strong></p>
<p>Itâs a $40 billion bargain youâve just struck, isnât it?</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER:</strong></p>
<p>Well, no. You would expect the Australian Government to want to get the best value; you would expect the Australian Government to want to get the best product; and you would expect the Australian Government to give Australian suppliers a fair go.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS UHLMANN:</strong></p>
<p>Arenât we seeing the rather terrifying and dispiriting sight of a Prime Minister bargaining for his life, and not even just for his life, but for some more time?</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER:</strong></p>
<p>No. What you are seeing is the democratic process in action. This is and has always been a consultative and collegial Government, but it will be a more consultative and collegial Government in the future than itâs been in the past.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS UHLMANN:</strong></p>
<p>Why donât your colleagues believe that?</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER:</strong></p>
<p>We will see tomorrow what my colleagues believe, but what Iâm saying to them is that the last thing our country needs right now is to see another government go into meltdown. We had that twice under Labor â we had that in Laborâs first term, we had that in Laborâs second term. Our country deserves better and thatâs what Iâm determined to give them.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS UHLMANN:</strong></p>
<p>How can you move on from here? Arenât you mortally wounded after this, and in time, the dogs will bring you down?</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER:</strong></p>
<p>Chris, Iâve already indicated at the Press Club this week how things will be different and betterâ¦</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS UHLMANN:</strong></p>
<p>And youâre giving up on financial reform.</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER:</strong></p>
<p>Thatâs not true. The paid parental leave scheme is gone, prime ministerial knighthoods are gone, there will be a move on Hizb ut-Tahrir, in coming weeks, we will be bringing down a stronger scrutiny and enforcement of the rules against foreign investment in residential property as well as agricultural land.</p>
<p>So, things are changing. The focus this year will be jobs, families, a strong economy and a secure nation.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS UHLMANN:</strong></p>
<p>Finally, wonât the focus this year be on your leadership and shouldnât you consider tendering your resignation?</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER:</strong></p>
<p>I accept that all prime ministers are, in a sense, on probation. Thatâs the way itâs always been, but, obviously, the wood will be on me to perform. It will be even more on me to perform in the future than itâs been in the past, but I will not let this country down and I will not let my Party down.</p>
<p><strong>CHRIS UHLMANN:</strong></p>
<p>Prime Minister, thank you.</p>
<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER:</strong></p>
<p>Thank you, Chris.</p>
