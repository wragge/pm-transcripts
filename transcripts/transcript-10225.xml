PRIME MINISTER<br />
31 January 1997 TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
THE HON. JOHN HOWARD MP<br />
ADDRESS TO THE COMMITTEE FOR ECONOMIC<br />
DEVELOPMENT OF AUSTRALIA, SYDNEY<br />
E&amp; Thank you very much Mr Chairman, ladies and gentlemen. It is, as was remarked the<br />
case that I do have a long association with CEDA. Those politicians in Australia who<br />
have memories like elephants have particular relationships with different organisations,<br />
and it tends to vary in direct proportion to the extent to which the orgaunisation still<br />
invites you to address them. When you are out of fashion and I have spent a<br />
considerable part of my political career being sort of successively in and out of fashion<br />
having gone through a significant period of time when I wasn't entirely flavour of<br />
the month either electorally or in party political terms, CEDA was one of those<br />
organisations that built up its credit for future changes by continuing to invite me along<br />
and I also of course have a sentimental attachment to the Intercontinental Hotel. It<br />
was the place that I spent election night cautiously simply booking some<br />
accommodation for family and very close friends against the possibility of despite the<br />
confidence I apparently displayed at the National Press Club although I should<br />
confide with the Chairman that that address at the National Press Club was followed<br />
immediately by what went down in the history of that campaign as being the ' Willis<br />
Letters Affair'. I went back to the National Press Club to be confronted with these<br />
letters that had allegedly been written by the Victorian Premier about some secret tax<br />
plan I had. Nothing seems to change but we got over that and we won the election<br />
and today I want to say a few things to you about where I see the Government's<br />
political position and also some thoughts with you about the future prospects of the<br />
Australian economy.<br />
Politics is always a mix of getting the policy right as well as getting the politics right.<br />
It is true that good policy is normally good politics but I would have to say to you on<br />
the basis of more than 20 years experience that is not always the case. You can never<br />
be a total slave to economic or industrial policy or industrial relations theory and<br />
expect to continually succeed in politics. Equally, if you don't pay proper cognisance<br />
of the importance of maintaining a forward momentum in policy development, you are<br />
rightly over a period of time judged negatively and that over an equal period of time </p>
<p>Fax fromu 31/ 61/ 97 15: 51 Pg: 2<br />
has a very negative effect on the political fortunes of the Party that you may be a<br />
member of or you may lead.<br />
So, over the I1I months that we have been in office we have endeavoured quite<br />
unashamedly to get a right mix of intelligent, reformist policy, not only in the economic<br />
area and also to try and understand and accommodate the right political mix between<br />
the policy imperative and also the political imperatives. Ultimately of course it is for<br />
others to make a judgement about how successfu we have been in that. I like to<br />
believe that in just under 12 months the Coalition Government that I had the privilege<br />
of leading has got that mix about right, not of course completely right. There are<br />
inevitably some people who say we should be going faster on the policy reform front.<br />
There are some in the community who think we have gone too far. There are some<br />
who believe that we haven't been politically sensitive enough. I think the mainstream<br />
view, if I can call it that, is probably that we have got the mix about right.<br />
I think there are subtle mood shifts in the Australian political community and the<br />
political mood of Australians in the 1990s and what existed in the 1980s. There is<br />
undoubtedly a sense of community unease about the way in which life in so many ways<br />
has changed and that is a very, very difficult challenge for any government and for any<br />
political leader. When you know that further change is needed in the national good,<br />
which I do and I assume that most of you do and would share that view. But so much<br />
of our lives have changed in the last 20 years. They've changed economically, they<br />
have changed socially, they have changed between men and women, they have changed<br />
so far as the power balance of nations is concerned. We no longer have a Cold War.<br />
We have only one superpower in the world and that is the ' United States. We have the<br />
fastest growing economic region sitting cheek by jowl in the area where Australia is.<br />
We have vast changes as many of the retailers know in the consuming habits of<br />
Australians, I think one of the great changes to have come out of the recession of the<br />
late 1980s and early 1990s was a permanent change in the attitude of Australian<br />
consumers. They became tougher buyers and I think have assumed the cultural attitude<br />
of the Americans and many others around the world in determining to drive much<br />
harder bargains and the buying habits of the young are very different now from what<br />
the buying habits were when many of the people in this audience could describe<br />
themselves as being in their late teens or early<br />
I mention those things, ladies and gentlemen, because you can never get as a Prime<br />
Minister or as a government an intelligent mix between the economics and the politics<br />
of the decisions you take unless you have some understanding, and an on-going<br />
understanding of the changes that are occurring in the community. It is just not real<br />
life to imagine that you can't ignore fashion swings broadly defined in the attitude of<br />
the young in OUr community, the broad changes in the moods of consumers. If you<br />
continued to react according to the assumptions of even a few years, let alone a couple<br />
of decades earlier then inevitably many of the attitudes that you strike are going to be<br />
wrong. I speak to you today feeling very strong and very positive about the economic outlook<br />
for Australia. I think at the moment Australia has a rare conjunction of very positive<br />
circumstances so far as our economic future is concerned. We have very low inflation. </p>
<p>Fax f rom 31/ 01/ 97 15: 51 PS: 3<br />
We have as the Treasurer said a couple of days ago returned to an era quite decisively<br />
of very low inflation. We really do have to go back to the pre-APEC days of the early<br />
1970s to find the very low inflation that we have at the present time and it's not<br />
confined to Australia, I read an article in The Spectator last night which indicated that<br />
even a country such as Brazil that had experienced hyperinflation for most of its<br />
modern experience had an inflation rate last year of iess than 10% and it is to be found<br />
throughout the industrialised world and increasingly also into other parts which will<br />
not be so described, The mid-year economic review, and I'll come back to that in a<br />
moment, also told us that we have very strong by world standards and manageable<br />
and it's important to link the strong economic growth that we have with the fact that<br />
we have low inflation. So often in the past we've never been about to that double.<br />
We have strong growth and that has spilled over into higher inflation which in turn has<br />
produced tightening measures through monetary policy which would then in turn stifle<br />
the growth. We do have a quite strong world economy. The United States economy<br />
because, but not only, due to its remarkable flexibility enjoys very strong economic<br />
growth and very strong business confidence and a very low level of unemployment, not<br />
only by historic standards but also by world standards.<br />
The European scene is more mixed but overall in reasonable shape with the British<br />
economy probably performing better than others. The Asia Pacific region continues of<br />
course not only to be tremendously important to Australia but also to be the strongest<br />
regional performer in the world, and the significance of that in Australia is very widely<br />
understood throughout the business and the political community. The mid-year<br />
economic review which has set a new standard in political transparency so far as<br />
economic policy is concerned in Australia it ran to something like a hundred pages<br />
the mid year review of the former government ran to something like 6 or 9 pages. This<br />
is the first illustration of the new charter of budget honesty which as a matter of law<br />
when it goes through the Parliament will require the production independently by the<br />
Treasury and the Department of Finance at the time of the next election, of a statement<br />
of the economy's situation in sufficient detail to ensure that both sides of politics<br />
respond in a way that is seen by the community as being responsible. What I think this<br />
charter of budget honesty has done is to impose new disciplines on everyone. It's<br />
imposed a new discipline on the Government, it's certainly imposed I'm happy to say a<br />
new discipline on the Opposition as well. I like to be even-handed when it comes to<br />
disciplines of this kind. And it has also, I might say, imposed a new discipline on the<br />
bureaucracy, because the detail of the mid-year review has inevitably thrown the gaze,<br />
enabled the gaze of so many of the professional economists in the private sector to<br />
examine in detail what has happened against the projections of the Treasury and the<br />
Department of Finance.<br />
So. overall I think the new high in political transparency is an extremely good thing<br />
and it can only make for better policy, more responsible policy, and a far better<br />
understanding throughout the broader community of just bow the economy is<br />
performing. Now it is true that there was a downward revision in company tax<br />
collections and as a consequence we will need to undertake some further fiscal<br />
tightening in the May budget. But as Peter Costello has indicated it is nowhere nearer<br />
the dimension that was carried out at the time the last Budget was put together. And<br />
the important news to emerge from the mid-year review is really the positive news and </p>
<p>Fax from 31/ 61/ 97 15: 51 Pg: 4<br />
that is that inflation projection is on the underlying front something like one percent<br />
against 2% forecast in the Budget.<br />
Business investment has been revised upwards, and the economic growth projection<br />
that was thought by many to be a little optimistic has been confirmed. Now that does<br />
really lay a very solid and a very positive and a very optimistic base. Now, I've been<br />
in politics and having been Treasurer for a number of years and held other positions<br />
long enough to know that it is never credible for a Prime Minister to say that or<br />
indeed a Treasurer to say that everything about the economy functioning perfectly of<br />
course it is not. But we do have and I think we would be selling ourselves short and I<br />
think as a commuunity, particularly the business community, we would be failing to take<br />
advantage of fortuitous circumstances if we didn't recognise that many of the<br />
fundamentals in Australia at the present time are very very sound indeed and they do<br />
provide a very very sound basis of optinmismn for the future. And all of you know that<br />
psychology is an important element in economic decision making. Not everything is<br />
made in a completely arithmetical and rational fashion. Hunches and instincts and<br />
psychology and gut feelings all play a significant role, and I think we do have a very<br />
fortuitous conjunction of circumstances.<br />
And can I say, I hope with no immodesty, that another factor bodes well for the<br />
economic future of Australia and that is that I believe that we have a government that<br />
is willing in an intelligent persistent fashion to tackle the major areas of economic<br />
reform. I know there are some who say the reforms should be more numerous. That<br />
will always be the case. And that's part of the system and that's a good thing. You<br />
should never have a situation where people are universally happy with what you are<br />
doing. It breeds complacency, it breeds smugness and I think it is very very important<br />
to have people breathing down your back from time to time as long as you reserve the<br />
right to remind them from time to time when they may get some of that criticism<br />
wrong. We were elected with commitments to a number of areas that were very important to<br />
Australia's economic future. None of them was more important than Industrial<br />
Relations reform. It took us a bit longer than we'd hoped to get it through the Senate<br />
and we may have lost an amendment or two along the way but the great bulk of what<br />
we took to the people was passed through the Senate, I'm very happy to say, and<br />
those new changes, those laws came into operation, the first batch of them, only on the<br />
first of January, a bare month that they have been in operation. Already we see I<br />
understand a reduction of something like 8O*/ o in the number of unfair dismissal claims<br />
made as a consequence of the new legislation. 1 have to say as I travel around<br />
Australia in the year leading up to the election, no issue more frequently was the<br />
subject of complaint to me from big companies, and small and medium ones, than the<br />
operation of the old unfair dismissal laws, regularly paraded to me as a reason why<br />
people weren't taking on more staff, Now, it is early days, but if the early signs are<br />
borne out then that will prove to have been a very very important reform.<br />
I think the industrial relations reforms over time will make a hugely significant<br />
contribution to creating a better balance between labour and business, a better balance<br />
which will better accommodate the right of employees to make free choices between<br />
either being represented by unions or some other arrangement or indeed representing </p>
<p>Fax from31/ e1/ 97 15: 51 Pg:<br />
their own interest$, as many of them wish to and many of them are eminently capable<br />
of so doing. I have great hopes for the industrial relations reforms. I believe the<br />
awards simplification process which I am delighted to see companies are already taking<br />
advantage of, and the new compliance measures that many companies are taking<br />
advantage of; I think all of them will create a far more contemporary and a far more<br />
competitive industrial relations climate.<br />
We have of course embarked upon a very very committed programme of fiscal<br />
consolidation. The $ 7 billion or more that was announced in the Budget of last year<br />
has been subject to only minor marauding although significant in itself by the Senate<br />
and I should say in that context that when Parliament resumes next week, we will be<br />
re-presenting to the Senate and pressing ahead with some of the changes that have<br />
been injected including the measure to impose a two year waiting period on the<br />
payment of certain benefits to newly arrived people in Australia. We do believe very<br />
strongly that a further tightening of fiscal policy will be needed, but as I mentioned at<br />
the beginning of my speech, not of the dimension that was undertaken at the time of<br />
the last budget. The end of last year saw us pass through the legislation to sell into the<br />
private sector one-third of you sponsor and I'm very happy to see that the progress is<br />
well underway with arrangements for what will prove to be the largest float in<br />
Australia's history. And, of course, out of the proceeds of that will come $ 1.1 billion<br />
which will go into the Natural Heritage Trust of Australia and that will represent the<br />
larg~ st capital investment by any government in post war Australia in our<br />
environmental future. And I am particularly proud of that commitment. It was a<br />
commitment that was put together in the days leading up to the caling of the election<br />
last year. And I think for a government, for a political party that over the years has<br />
taken more than its fair share of flack about an alleged indifference to the environment,<br />
I'm especially proud that we over the next two years will be able to demonstrate long<br />
term credentials in the area of the environment that I believe have very, very strong<br />
support through the Australian community.<br />
I spoke earlier of mood and attitudinal changes within the community, Over the last<br />
years Done has been more emphatic than the embracing by all generations of<br />
Australians across the political divide, across the socio-economic divide, of a concern<br />
for and a commitment to sensible policies which preserve and strengthen Australia's<br />
environment. Nobody, I hope, of intelligence embraces radical environmentalism but<br />
most Australians now want to see a sensible balance between economic development<br />
and care for the environment. Sustainable development most Australians very, very<br />
strongly support and our commitments in that area will be very, very strong evidence<br />
of how we feel on that particular subject.<br />
We also took to the last election campaign some very strong commitments to assist the<br />
small business sector. I spoke a lot during that election campaign of the link between<br />
job creation and small business. I still remain quite passionately of the belief, as I did a<br />
year ago, that greater small business activity and a better climate for small business will<br />
more than anything else provide the hope of greater job generation particularly for the<br />
young within our community.<br />
Unemployment, as everybody knows, remains too high. I don't pretend that the<br />
8. 5 per cent rate will dissolve quickly, I do believe, however, that as the impact of </p>
<p>Fax f rom 31/ 01/ 97 15: 51L Pg: 6<br />
some of the policies that we've implemented already, and others to be implemented<br />
this year, work their way through there will be a reduction in that level. You will<br />
understand me being a little dismissive of and impatient with my political opponents<br />
who after 13 years left us 8.5 per cent having taken it to 11I and then bang the table and<br />
say how shocking, how terrible, you've had I11 months and you haven't got rid of it.<br />
And I think a willingness to reject that sort of criticism is very, very understandable.<br />
But the policies that we've implemented to help small business include, in the words of<br />
the Business Review Weekly who I'm happy on this occasion to give quite a free plug<br />
too include changes to the capital gains tax regime which the editor in chief of that<br />
magazine described as the most important for the business comminunity in 30 years. The<br />
impact of those changes will be that any small business can be sold in the proceeds up<br />
to the tune of $ 5 million can be invested in any other business, not just into a like<br />
business, we have abolished the like business test, but indeed into any other business<br />
resulting in a deferral of capital gains tax liability. That change will come into<br />
operation on the I1st of July next year and it will have a major impact in my view and in<br />
the view of many on small business activity and the attractiveness of small business to<br />
investors. There are other changes that we have made in that area including of course the<br />
changes in the provision tax uplift factor. And the ben efits of the industrial relations<br />
changes and the unfair dismissal changes are most marked indeed when it comes to the<br />
small business sector,<br />
There are many items on the agenda for the months ahead of us. The response in<br />
February to the Charlie Bell committee on small business deregulation will be another<br />
opportunity for the Government to demonstrate its credentials in the small business<br />
arma We'll have the report of the Wallis Inquiry. I think I read somewhere that<br />
there's a productivity commission report on the motor vehicle industry which will<br />
attract, as reports dealing with tariff protection in Australia always do, a great deal of<br />
interest. We will need and we will address the issue of waterfront reform in 1997. It<br />
goes very much to the heart of the competitiveness of the Australian economy and it's<br />
very important to the export sector.<br />
So we have a very significant list of items ahead of us. And in drawing my remarks to<br />
a close Mr Chairman, can I say that one of the many things that we have endeavoured<br />
to do in the time that we have been in government is to develop and retain an<br />
intelligent dialogue with the business community of Australia.<br />
We were elected I think very proudly on the platform and on the vote that we were a<br />
political party that was owned by nobody and that what we sought to do was to<br />
represent the mainstream of the Australian commnunity. And if I may have a party<br />
political com~ mercial, one of the characteristics of the Liberal Party, particularly its<br />
modern manifestation, is that it is not really owned or dominated by any one section of<br />
Australian society. I was especially proud that we were able to attract support from<br />
many people at the time of the last election who would describe themselves as<br />
traditional Labor Party voters, who described themselves as typical Aussie battlers,<br />
people who were attracted by many of the more socially conservative policies that </p>
<p>Fax from 31/ 01/ 97 15: 51 Pg: 7<br />
were espoused by the Coalition and who'd grown weary of the special interest group<br />
pleading that had been so successfu~ l under the former government.<br />
Now, naturally, as an instinctive politician and as somebody whose prime responsibility<br />
to his party is to preserve its electoral fortune, my responsibility is to achieve a mix of<br />
outcomes that accommodate all of those responsibilities, I can't only govern for the<br />
business community, I can't only govern for the consumer, I can't only govern for the<br />
battler, I can't only govern for this or that section of the community, but what I can do<br />
is endeavour in achieving the right mix of outcomes and the right mix of policies is to<br />
achieve a fair distillation of those responsibilities.<br />
A strong and growing economy, and I believe we have a rare conjunction of<br />
circumstances that is going to produce that, is a fundamentally important element in a<br />
contented community. When I made the mistake, I suppose, in politics of uttering a<br />
spontaneous phrase and that was when I said I wanted Australians to feel relaxed and<br />
comfortable I meant a few things a little more subtly than some of my critics have<br />
suggested in response to that. But what I really did, more tban anything, have in mind<br />
is that I wanted Australians to feel very, very confident about their past, very confident<br />
about their current identity and also particularly buoyant and optimistic about the<br />
future. I don't believe that every dragon has been tackled and slain over the last year but I do<br />
believe that we have made a very and promising start, a sensible realistic start to<br />
achieving those goals and at creating the kind of Australian community that I think.<br />
most of us aspire to, whatever our political beliefs may be and wherever we may sit in<br />
the Australian community. I think we have made a good start. There is much to be<br />
done. I have greatly valued the cooperation and the candour of the business<br />
coinunity in Australia. We are at heart a pro-business party. We won't always do<br />
what you want. You will criticise us. You will be unhappy, as many of you were with<br />
some of the measures contained in the last budget, but as the overall impact of our<br />
Government is to create a low inflation, strongly pro-business investment environment<br />
and improving international competitiveness and a more level playing field in industrial<br />
relations then I think we are delivering very real benefits to the Australian business<br />
community. Thank you very much. </p>
