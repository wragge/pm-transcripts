The Australian Government has today pledged up to $5 million to The Queen Elizabeth Diamond Jubilee Trust, as part of Australia's commemoration of the Diamond Jubilee.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister has written to the Premiers and Chief Ministers encouraging them collectively to match the Commonwealth's contribution.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister will also appoint an eminent Australian to spearhead private sector fundraising for the Trust.</p>
<p>The Trust, which was announced by UK Prime Minister Cameron at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Perth in October 2011, was launched officially in the UK on 6 February.</p>
<p>Through its grant-making activities, the Trust will create an enduring tribute to Her Majesty The Queen by supporting charitable projects and organisations across the Commonwealth.</p>
<p>The Trust is chaired by former UK Prime Minister Sir John Major. Sir John has said the Trust will place great emphasis on enriching the lives of individuals, by focusing on areas such as the tackling of curable disease the promotion of all forms of education and culture. </p>
<p>Australia's contribution to the Trust will go to development-related projects that will create a lasting legacy in honour of Her Majesty The Queen's Diamond Jubilee.</p>
<p>The Trust will undertake fund-raising activities through 2012 and is not expected to begin disbursement of funds until 2013.</p>
<p>The Government will also recognise the Diamond Jubilee in other ways:</p>
<p> * 	The Prime Minister will light a Jubilee Beacon on Parliament House on 4 June.<br />
 * 	Australia Post will issue a Jubilee stamp.<br />
 * 	The Royal Mint will issue a Jubilee coin.<br />
 * 	An east-west road in the Parliamentary Zone will be renamed “Queen Elizabeth Terrace”.<br />
 * 	A scholarship will be established focused on women's leadership.<br />
 * 	A Jubilee essay competition will be staged.</p>
<p>Their Royal Highnesses The Prince of Wales and The Duchess of Cornwall will visit Australia later this year as part of the Diamond Jubilee celebrations.</p>
<p>The Governor-General will also visit London in June to coincide with the major celebrations in the United Kingdom. </p>
