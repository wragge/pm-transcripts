HEADS OF. GOVERNMENT. MEETING<br />
CANBERRA, 11 OCTOBER 1973<br />
OPENING STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
Welcoming remarks.<br />
The purpose of this meeting is to discuss, and I<br />
hope agree on, proposals of the Australian Government which<br />
are directed towards our objective of assisting and<br />
strengthening local government and making it a fuller and<br />
more effective partner in our Federal system.<br />
There can be no doubt of the firmness of my<br />
Government' s commitment to that objective. It is encompassed<br />
in our Platform; it was explicit in my Policy Speech before<br />
the last election;. most recently I re-affirmed it in my<br />
speeches to the Constitutional Convention0 Indeed, our<br />
meeting here today. had its direct impetus from the discussions<br />
we had at the Convention0<br />
Repeatedly, I have emphasised that one of the<br />
essential requirements for full achievement of our objective<br />
is a re-casting of the arrangements embodied in the present<br />
Financial Agreement. These are arrangements which were based<br />
on the situation of the 1920s, when the relative roles and<br />
responsibilities of the Australian Government, the State<br />
Governments and local government were vastly different from<br />
what they now are0 They ar e not good enough0 They have not<br />
been adequate for some time. They are certainly not adequate<br />
for the future. We do not seek change for change's sake nor, as<br />
some would say,, to centralise power in Canberra0 The planning<br />
and provision-of public services and facilities to meet the<br />
expanding needs of the whole community is becoming an </p>
<p>increasingly complex task. It is one which cannot be<br />
accomplished satisfactorily if we cling to old concepts, old<br />
demarcation lines of interest and responsibility drawn up in<br />
the distant past. Of course, when the Financial Agreement was<br />
drawn up local government authority borrowing was relatively<br />
insignificant. Things are very different now. The situation<br />
now is that local government authorities have been borrowing<br />
more each year than the total amount of their outstanding debt<br />
only twenty years or so ago. It can be fairly said that if<br />
the Financial Agreement were being drawn up now it would be<br />
unthinkable that local government would be. entirely excluded<br />
from it. Over at least the last two. decades there have<br />
been serious deficiencies developing in the provision of many<br />
of the public services and facilities which it has fallen to<br />
the State-local government sector to provide. Partly this<br />
has been a product of insufficiency of resources; but it has<br />
also reflected processes of planning and of determination of<br />
priorities which have been inadequate or too narrowly based.<br />
My Government has set itself the task of helping<br />
to remedy, in co-operation with the States and their<br />
authorities, the deficiencies which now exist. We have made<br />
a strong beginning witness the new or enlarged allocations<br />
in our budget for 1973-74 for such purposes as education,<br />
community . health, public . housing, sewerage services, land<br />
management, urban--transport and . growth centres. . Total<br />
allocations . to the.. States in 1973-74, including the State<br />
Governments' Loan Council programs but excluding </p>
<p>unemployment relief grants, are estimated to be no less than<br />
24 per cent greater than the corresponding allocations in<br />
1972-73. Local government is an area of special importance<br />
which has suffered imbalances between responsibilities and<br />
resources. The importance of local government derives from<br />
the very fact that it is local that the services and<br />
facilities which it provides have such a close and direct<br />
impact on the welfare of the population it services. It is<br />
our aim, in part, to make available to local government<br />
resources more adequate for its functions. But our aim is<br />
larger than that. If local government is to play the fuller<br />
and more effective . part that I believe the community wishes<br />
it to play, then we must also increase the effective influence<br />
local government exercises in relation to the fundamental<br />
decision-making affecting its activities, It will represent<br />
a most significant step towards real Federalism, real local<br />
participation in public affairs and, indeed, real<br />
decentralisation of government when this is achieved.<br />
We have already taken several very important<br />
steps in that direction, We secured the representation of<br />
local government at the Constitutional Convention, In its<br />
Autumn Sittings the Australian Parliament passed a new Grants<br />
Commission Act authorising that body to inquire into<br />
applications for assistance by regional organisations of<br />
local government, Any assistance recommended by the<br />
Commission and approved by the Australian Government will be<br />
paid to the States under section 96 of the Constitution on<br />
condition that it be passed on to the local government </p>
<p>organisations concerned. Additional members have been<br />
appointed to the Commission and its staff is being expanded<br />
to enable it to deal with this large new responsibility. It<br />
is hoped that applications by regional organisations will<br />
begin to be received and considered early next year.<br />
Additionally, under the Australian Assistance Plan there will<br />
be available to local government authorities special<br />
assistance to enable them more effectively to provide welfare<br />
and health services to their communities.<br />
The proposals I am now putting to you and for<br />
which I now seek your unanimous support represent a further<br />
long step towards the same objective0 They are proposals of<br />
which I have spoken many times before, including at the<br />
recent Constitutional Convention, so I expect that you have<br />
already thought about them a good deal yourselves. They<br />
are:-that elected local government have both a voice<br />
and a vote in the Loan Council0 It is of the<br />
utmost importance, I believe, that the voice of<br />
local government the voice of those people<br />
with the closest knowledge of community needs<br />
at the local and regional level be heard in<br />
this decision-making forum; and<br />
that the Australian Government be empowered to<br />
borrow on behalf of elected local government.<br />
There are, broadly, three bases on which the<br />
first of these proposals might be sought.<br />
One would be to admit representatives of local<br />
government to the Loan-Council on the same basis as the </p>
<p>present members, with full representation and voting rights<br />
covering all matters dealt with by the Loan Council. While<br />
I see considerable merit in this, I recognise that, in terms<br />
of the present nature and range of Loan Council interests and<br />
functions, it would raise some difficulties.<br />
The other two bases would impose some limitations<br />
on the role allotted to the local government representatives<br />
in the Loan Council. We could, for example, limit local<br />
government participation in both discussion and voting to<br />
those matters directly affecting local government. Again,<br />
I see difficulties in this approach, since the borrowing<br />
programs of both the State governments and their local<br />
and semi-government authorities are, I gather, generally<br />
discussed in the same context at Loan Council meetings.<br />
There would be a. constant problem as to the precise point<br />
at which local government representatives would be admitted<br />
to the discussions in the Loan Council. I have not the least<br />
doubt that, experienced in and aware of the Loan Council<br />
procedures as you are, it is unnecessary for me to enlarge<br />
on this problem. For my own part, I see such arrangements as<br />
providing much too limited a role for local government for<br />
it to meet my Government's objectives.<br />
The intermediate approach is therefore the one<br />
I wish to propose to you. This would admit representatives<br />
of elected local government to all Loan Council discussions,<br />
with a right to vote on those matters directly affecting<br />
local government essentially, the borrowing programs for<br />
the bodies they represent and the allocations of these<br />
programs. </p>
<p>6.<br />
Before I throw this proposal open for discussion<br />
there are some points of principle and procedure that I<br />
should canvass. First, there is the legal . framework within which<br />
such a situation could be achieved. As I see it, the<br />
Financial Agreement could be amended to accommodate and<br />
provide a firm and proper basis for the new arrangements. I<br />
am advised that the necessary amendments to the Financial<br />
Agreement could be made, by agreement between the Australian<br />
and State Governments, without taking it outside the scope<br />
of section 105A of the Constitution as it stands. It would,<br />
of course, be accepted that, in accordance with practice, any<br />
such amendments should be validated by Acts of the Australian<br />
and State Parliaments. Borrowings by local government bodies are at<br />
present governed by the Gentlemen's Agreement, which also<br />
covers borrowings by statutory authorities of the Australian<br />
and State Governments. I should make it clear that my<br />
proposal concerning representation in the Loan Council is<br />
limited to elected local government bodies, I appreciate<br />
that some of the largest borrowers,. individually, under the<br />
Gentlemen's Agreement are statutory authorities mainly<br />
public utilities of one kind or another, These bodies I see<br />
as having adequate representation in the Loan Council through<br />
the Premiers, They are essentially arms of the Governments<br />
concerned. Indeed, there is in many cases only a fine<br />
dividing line between the types of function they perform and<br />
those of some State departments, and the respective functions<br />
of the two vary from State to State, </p>
<p>7.<br />
It is clear that the proposed new arrangements<br />
would require that provisions which are now part of the<br />
Gentlemen's Agreement be re-cast, as would the nature of the<br />
" programs" to be considered by the Loan Council. I envisage<br />
that, in place of the existing division of the programs into<br />
" larger" and " smaller" authorities, what would now be<br />
required would be separate borrowing programs for local<br />
government bodies and for the State Government<br />
instrumentalities . I have no firm view on whether there<br />
would still need to be a borrowing limit corresponding to<br />
the existing amount of $ 400,000 below which there would be<br />
no program ceiling imposed by the Loan Council. I am<br />
inclined to think that there should be such a limit if we<br />
are to avoid loss of the flexibility that now exists for<br />
borrowings by smaller bodies. However, I see that as a<br />
procedural matter to be resolved if agreement is reached on<br />
the principle of local government representation.<br />
The other proposal that I have said I want to<br />
place before you is that arrangements be agreed upon for the<br />
Australian Government to borrow on behalf of local government.<br />
The Financial Agreement as it stands does not provide for<br />
this. Let me provide some background. At June 1947<br />
( satisfactory figures for earlier years are not available)<br />
local government authorities total outstanding debt was about<br />
$ 140 million about 7 per cent of total State Government<br />
debt; at June 1971 the preliminary figure, provided by the<br />
Statistician, was $ 1,730 million almost 15 per cent of<br />
estimated total State Government debt at the time. In </p>
<p>8.<br />
twenty-four years local government authorities debt increased<br />
more than twelvefold compared with an increase of not quite<br />
sixfold in State Governments' total outstanding debt. Yet<br />
after the period of extraordinary growth in the magnitude and<br />
cost of local government activities, their place and role<br />
in the forum determining the nation's broad public<br />
borrowing programs was as it had. been at the beginning<br />
in a word, nil. Does it not. strike you as odd that, while we<br />
have established arrangements for borrowings by State<br />
Governments to be undertaken on their behalf by the<br />
Australian Government, local. government authorities are<br />
largely left to fend for themselves in the capital markets?<br />
Especially with the growing complexity and sophistication<br />
of these markets, they are handicapped as borrowers.<br />
I see this as being not only odd, but also as<br />
quite unsatisfactory. Given the nature and range of public<br />
servicesand facilities that local government authorities are<br />
called upon to provide, why should they not also have the<br />
opportunity to have the Australian. Government, with its<br />
superior capacity as a borrower, undertake borrowings on<br />
their behalf? I repeat here what I said earlier; that if<br />
the Financial Agreement were being drawn up now it would be<br />
unthinkable that these authorities could be ignored.<br />
The costs of servicing their borrowings bear<br />
heavily and increasingly so on the budgets on local<br />
government authorities. While the picture differs from<br />
State to State, and as between individual authorities, </p>
<p>9.<br />
overall interest payments by local government authorities<br />
would now be equivalent to about 12 per cent of their<br />
revenues. Interest payments plus capital repayments amounted<br />
to some $ 177.5 million in 1970-71 and were equivalent to<br />
about 25 per cent of revenues.<br />
If the Australian Government were to be able to<br />
borrow on behalf of local government authorities, the costs<br />
of servicing the resultant debt would of course be<br />
significantly lower than if those authorities borrowed the<br />
funds directly themselves. And this would mean lesser costs<br />
of services and lesser burdens on the local ratepayers.<br />
It would be possible, of course, for the<br />
Australian Government to borrow moneys and pass them on,<br />
under section 96 of the Constitution, to State Governments<br />
on condition that they be made available to local government<br />
authorities. This procedure is not what I have in mind when<br />
I speak of Australian Government borrowings on behalf of<br />
local government. Premiers will appreciate the difference<br />
between borrowings made by the Australian Government on behalf<br />
of their States and borrowings made wholly on the Australian<br />
Government's account which might be used to finance payments<br />
to the States under section 96.<br />
What I am seeking is your agreement to amend<br />
the Financial Agreement to enable the Australian Government<br />
to borrow for and on behalf of elected local government<br />
bodies, just as it borrows for and on behalf of the State<br />
Governments, and to provide the funds direct to those bodies.<br />
The amendment would also make provision for consequential<br />
arrangements for the servicing of such debt. </p>
<p>I am not proposing that local government should<br />
be required to havp borrowings for their purposes undertaken<br />
on their behalf by the Australian Government regardless of<br />
their wishes in the matter. It would be for each authority<br />
to choose whether to take advantage of the new facility or<br />
to rely on its own abilities as a borrower.<br />
I am well aware that there would be a number of<br />
legal and practical arrangements to be settled before the<br />
proposal could be implemented. However, I am again advised<br />
that the necessary amendments could be made to the Financial<br />
Agreement to enable this to be done without taking it outside<br />
section 105A of the Constitution as it stands.<br />
In brief, those are the proposals I put to you<br />
for your consideration and, I trust, agreement. It will be<br />
clear from what I have said that I am seeking the cooperation<br />
of the States in arrangements to provide local<br />
government with a role and the resources adequate to its<br />
responsibilities. With your assistance and co-operation<br />
I believe, as I have already indicated, that this can be done<br />
within the existing constitutional framework.<br />
I urge your agreement to these proposals; that<br />
way we can proceed quickly and with the least fuss and bother<br />
to the urgent task of putting local government on a<br />
satisfactory and viable basis0 I do not think there can be<br />
any argument that such assistance is necessary indeed, it<br />
is being demanded by the community. If, together, we cannot<br />
agree on such arrangements, however, I do not see any adequate<br />
alternative open to my Government but to seek to have the<br />
Constitution amended for the purpose. However, as I say, I </p>
<p>110<br />
do not see that course as necessary if we can agree to adopt<br />
the arrangements I have outlined. Indeed, I have not discussed<br />
the alternative course in any depth here because I think each<br />
of you will be as anxious as I to see your own local government<br />
authorities playing their part in public affairs more<br />
effectively. It must be made quite clear, however, that if I<br />
am mistaken in that belief then my Government will adopt<br />
the alternative course. I also . make it clear that I expect<br />
that at this meeting here today we will decide between the<br />
alternatives of co-operative action or constitutional<br />
amendment. I am not, of course, seeking a solution to all<br />
the practical and procedural problems today. Neither am I<br />
suggesting that those problems should be cleared away before<br />
the decisions in principle are reached. If we can reach<br />
unanimous agreement on the broad proposals I have outlined,<br />
we can then quickly proceed to establish machinery to put<br />
them into effect. But I am seeking such agreement today for<br />
the reason that, in its absence, I would wish to have before<br />
the end of the current sittings of the Australian Parliament<br />
the necessary legislation for a referendum on the amendment<br />
of section 105A. </p>
