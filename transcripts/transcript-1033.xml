THE ABMIDALE SCHOOL SPEECH DAY<br />
11THi DECEME, 1963<br />
Speech by the Prime Ministe: ie, the Rt. Hon. R. G.-Menzies<br />
My Lord Bishop, Headmaster and Ladies and Gentlemen<br />
Before I address myself -to the serious business<br />
of the day, I would like ' to say that at the Girls' Grammar<br />
School this morning, I was honoured by having pinned on to the<br />
back of my chair a picture of a thistle. Today, I am happy to<br />
tell you, the practical nature of boys manifested itself because<br />
lying on the seat of my chair was a shilling ( Laughter) which I<br />
now donate to any worthy school charity, ( Laughter) ( Applause)<br />
Of course, you will not overlook the fact that while the thistle<br />
now has some association with me or I have with the thistle,<br />
the shilling also has an association with me because it's a<br />
bob, ( Laughter) As a matter of fact, there was some reference<br />
made I must refer to what happened this morning at the other<br />
school, if for no other reason than this, that the Bishop this<br />
afternoon really stole quite a bit of the speech I made this<br />
morning. ( Laughter) And, like Mark Antony, I must wait until<br />
it comes back to me, Anyhow, there was a reference made this<br />
morning, apropos of The Thistle to the Prime Minister of Great<br />
Britain, Sir Alexander Douglas ? Iome, whose name, as you know is<br />
spltH-Ime and is pronounced 11Hume just my name, boys,<br />
as you all know, is spelt Menzies but in Scotland pronounced<br />
Mingies, So there we were once, two of us at a dinner in<br />
London, one of those large dinners at which people make powerful<br />
speeches and Lord Home as he then was, made a speech proposing<br />
my health and had a litle fun about the pronunciation of my<br />
name one way in Australia, another way in Scotland, and so on.<br />
I had to get my own back by saying that when I got back to<br />
Australia and was invited to a concert in the local town, with<br />
perhaps the vicar presiding, though I would hope not because I<br />
am a Presbyterian myself ( Laughter); I would look forward to<br />
hearing him say, " Now Miss Jones will favour us by singing,<br />
fHume, Hume Sweet Hume". ( Laughter)<br />
Now Sir, I would like to pursue an idea which<br />
I had in may mind when I came here and which I am stimulated to<br />
say something more about nowl The function of education, This<br />
sounds very, very heavy, doesntt it? The function of education,<br />
All sorts of fine things have been said about it but I would<br />
rather like to divide it myself very, very briefly into two<br />
matters. First of all, we go to school, we go to a<br />
university, if we are lucky enough to do so. We go to some place<br />
of learning in order, I believe to equip ourselves to learn<br />
by our own experience. I hope I convey myself on that matter,<br />
To equip ourselves to learn by our own experience. Now, no man<br />
can learn by his own experience if he permits himself no<br />
experience, if he is merely one of a mass, one of a mob if he<br />
has merely got the ambition of being so like everyone else in<br />
appearance and dress and raind that he will never be distinguished<br />
from any other man in the crowd. This is one of the terrifying<br />
prospects of this century that people should succumb to the<br />
mass idea, that people should be even so bemused as to believe<br />
that the majority is always right. I know fellows like myself<br />
occasionally like to get a majority; ( Laughter) but if I hadnt<br />
got a majority this time it would have been conclusive evidence<br />
to meo that the majority Is wrong. ( Laughter) But the point I<br />
of a 0 0 0 0/ 2 </p>
<p>2<br />
want to make is this: Nothing could be more absurd than to<br />
have your own mind devEloped to a point at which you really<br />
believe that you can't disagree with the majority of people<br />
without being a little odd, a litftle unworthy, a little crazy.<br />
You, Sir, Ireferred to something that Jan<br />
Christian Simuts had said about mankind being on the march0 I<br />
remember that very well, It was in the same speech that he<br />
pointed out that the most dangerous thing in the world was<br />
the mass movement and the mass mentality which threatened to<br />
destroy the freedom of mankind. This is true. I remember once<br />
attending a church service somewhere or other, I've forgotten<br />
in which there was a Scots preacher who told the story of the<br />
first disciples on the shores of the Sea of Galilee, Suddenly<br />
he stopped and hie said, " Picture the scn" and he described<br />
it. He said, " That was the beginning of the greatest minority<br />
movement in human history." Now this is true because Christianity<br />
is the greatest minority movement in human history. We can't<br />
count majorities in this world for Christianity, but it stands<br />
for something more than that because people, generation after<br />
generation and century after century, have been found who<br />
believe that the majority was not necessarily right, that<br />
minorities though they might be, they had standards to uphold<br />
and great ideas to preach and to practice.<br />
Therefore, and this is really what I am trying<br />
to say, the first business is to learn to be yourself, not to<br />
be somebody else. To be yourself. That doesn't mean to be all<br />
filled with self-conceit, saying, " Ah I am the greatest fellow<br />
in the world," but it is to be yourself and not a miserable<br />
copy of your neighbour, not a feeble imitation of some other<br />
fellow in your class or in your year or in your part of the<br />
world, We have to be ourselves if we are to make our contribution<br />
to life, whether that contribution is made in a vast place and<br />
on a high ground or in a small place obscurely and quietly.<br />
But we must be ourselves, not somebody else.<br />
When somebody has learned by broadening studies<br />
which may seem irksome, but which produce balance in the mind;<br />
when he has through those processes learned to be himself, then<br />
he will be well qualified to learn, to learn sensibly and wisely<br />
from his own experience. And it is a pretty good man who does,<br />
In my life, now no shorter than it was, I have seen people fall<br />
time after time into exactly the same error because they have<br />
not learned by their own experience because they have got into<br />
the mental habit of having a stab aZ something as if the problem<br />
had suddenly arisen. So we must learn and I say to the boys,<br />
particularly, " Be yourselves."<br />
Not a bad thing to be yourself, with all your<br />
defects or with all your advantages or v'ith all your gifts or<br />
with all what you may regard as your lack of talent; it is a<br />
splendid thing to be yourself because it is as yourself that<br />
people will deal with you in this life, that people will meet<br />
you in this life, that people will judge you in this life. They<br />
won't say, " O0h, you belong to a good crowd." 1 They will want to<br />
know what you, yourself, are like. Therefore we must be ourselves<br />
and prepared to learn by our own experience.<br />
But of course, Sir, I don't need to say that in<br />
a school, in any place that professes to be a seat of learning,<br />
we must also be taught to learn from the experience of others<br />
and the books are full of the experience of others. Every<br />
library is full of the experiences of others; the whole study<br />
of history is designed to enable us to benefit by the experiences<br />
of others. I am astonished, timo after time, to encounter people </p>
<p>M3<br />
who think they have been successfuLl in life because they have<br />
made a lot of money whj.' Th really, quite frankly, is the lowest<br />
of the arts very useful one lo have no doubt but it doesn't<br />
mean much, on the whole, except to the individual; but who at<br />
the same time will almost boast about their entire innocence of<br />
what has gone on in the world before, as if they had made a new<br />
world of their own, all of a sudden, without benefit of history,<br />
without benefit of looking back or of looking forward, I think<br />
it was Henry Ford who, having turned out to be a benefactor, I<br />
think, of mankind, inventing the mass production of motor cars,<br />
and having become a very rich man and very powerful and having<br />
displayed a species of genius, I agree, in the industrial world,<br />
and a great constructive genius at that, the moment he became<br />
a multi-millionaire and a successful producer of motor cars<br />
became, following our charming habit, an authority on everything,<br />
So newspaper reporters wou]-d go to him and say, "' Excuse me, Mr.<br />
Ford, what are your views on classical music?" " Excuse me, Mr.<br />
Ford, what are your views cn the international situation?"<br />
" Excuse me, Mr. Ford, who is your favourite poet, end why?"<br />
Once a year, they ring somebody up in my family and say. " What<br />
are your twelve favourite flowers?" ( Laughter) and that'leaves<br />
me for dead because I only know the names of about six. ( Laughter)<br />
It was Henry Ford himself who, being asked for<br />
his views on history pronounced final judgment. He said,<br />
" History is bunik". ( Laughter) Now, some of you earnest students<br />
may have said this too, for all I know. ( Laughter) I get a<br />
gleam in the eyes of one or two of you that suggests that you<br />
mlay have said that under your breath. Believe me, just as a<br />
knowledge of your own language is imperative for life, just as<br />
the knowledge of somebody else's language, ancient or modern is<br />
of terrific significance in life, so is the knowledge of history,<br />
which is the gathered-together and recorded experience of other<br />
people, essential for judgment. Any man who has to handle great<br />
problems in my line of life, if you like, though this is by no<br />
means the only one to try to make a decision about great<br />
problems, I believe is grievously handicapped unless his mind<br />
is sufficiently furnished to know that this is not the first time<br />
a problem of this kind ever cropped up that it has cropped up<br />
elsewhere, that other people have had to look at it, that some<br />
people have solved it or tried to solve it in one way and the<br />
solution failed because of certain circumstances. This is a<br />
tremendous thing to have a mental background yesterday's mind,<br />
if you like, in a sense, yesterday's memory in dealing with<br />
today's problems. So you see your own experience the<br />
experience of other people belore you, you must learn from both if<br />
you are to come out from school with some sense of values,<br />
Headmraster is so right,, It is a good thing to acquire a<br />
vocation. I did myself and not to my disadvantage. It's a good<br />
thing to achieve a profession or a trade or a skill or something<br />
or other that will eanble you to earn a living. But earning a<br />
living is the mere mechanics of providing yourself with food and<br />
drink and clothing. Achieving a life, that's a different matter,<br />
because that depends on human values upon human understanding,<br />
upon having achievedg however modestly, a kind of civilisation.<br />
Now, this is a school with a great name, a great<br />
history, a great reputation and it has a Headmaster who has<br />
expressed it in his concluding remarks perfectly: " This is a<br />
church school. Dontt let us ever forget it." Here the torch<br />
of learning burns alongside the altar of' the Christian church,<br />
and this is a great thing because it means that the values we<br />
achieve will be the greatest and best and most enduring values<br />
in the world. </p>
