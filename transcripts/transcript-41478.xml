    <content><![CDATA[<p>I extend to the Indian community, in Australia and around the world, my warmest wishes to all those who are celebrating the festival of Holi.</p>
<p>A colourful celebration of life, love and thanksgiving, Holi is a brilliant occasion to celebrate with family and to renew our bonds of friendship and goodwill with one another.</p>
<p>While the Gulal is thrown, we can acknowledge the celebration of Holi as a demonstration of Australia being the most successful multicultural society in the world.</p>
<p>I also wish to extend my greetings to those celebrating Holi in India. Our two great democracies are strengthened by countless people-to-people links and a shared commitment to democracy, the rule of law and mutual respect.</p>
<p>I wish everyone who isÂ celebrating a Happy Holi.</p>
