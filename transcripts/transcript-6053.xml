jAUSTRALIA<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 14 March, 1983<br />
I have received messages of congratulations and good wishes<br />
from President Reagan, Vice President Bush and Secretary of<br />
State George Schultz on the election of my Government.<br />
Each expresses, in the warmest of terms, their intention to<br />
work closely with me and my Government.<br />
President Reagan referred to the long tradition of friendship<br />
and co-operation between the United States and Australia<br />
and to the many close ties between our countries which are<br />
the product of our shared interests and values.<br />
I have responded to the President, referring to the fundamental<br />
importance of the relationship between our countries and<br />
indicating that my Government's approach in this relationship<br />
will be that of a constructive ally.<br />
The President expressed the hope that, in order that he and<br />
I can put our relationship as friends and allies on a more<br />
personal basis, I would be able to visit Washington in the not<br />
too distant future.<br />
While my immediate priorities rest with pressing domestic issues<br />
and preclude such a visit for the next few months, I hope that<br />
it will be possible to take up the President's invitation before<br />
too long. </p>
<p>Dcar Mr. Prime NMinisi or:<br />
P 3aCcacseop t my warin congra Liu lations on t4te electoral<br />
victory of the Austrailian Labor ] Party as weit as my<br />
best w. ishes for the success of your Government.<br />
The United States and Australia have a long tradition<br />
of friendship and cooperation. This relationship<br />
springs from our common heritage and has been reinforced<br />
over the years by the innumerable close ties between our<br />
peoples. These bonds between us have not been created in<br />
a vacuum, but are the product of our shared interests and<br />
values. This commonality of interest is reflected in our<br />
partnership in the ANZUS Alliance a partnership which<br />
clearly transcends military ' and security needs and has<br />
come to encompass a broad range of political, economic<br />
anrid cultural interests.<br />
As you shoulder the many burdens of government, I want<br />
you to know that, as a friend and ally, I intend to work<br />
closely with you, as I did with your predecessor, in<br />
pursuit of our many shared goals. In order that we may<br />
put this relationship on a more personal basis, I hope<br />
that you will be able in the not distant future to visit<br />
Washington. If you agree in principle, we can work out<br />
mutually convenient dates.<br />
Again, my best wishes to you and your Government on the<br />
tasks that lie ahead of you. Sincerely, / s/<br />
Ronald Reagan </p>
