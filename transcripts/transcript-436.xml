    <content><![CDATA[<p>P. M. No, 7/1962</p>
<p>This morning representatives of the AssociatedÂ Chambers of Commerce of Australia submitted to the PrimeÂ Minister and other senior Commonwealth Ministers their views oilÂ the present state of the economy, and their suggestions forÂ future action by the Government in both the short and long term.</p>
<p>The Associated Chambers were represented by Mr. Cohin<br />C. Verco, their President, Mr. H. C. Thomas, Honorary Treasurer;<br />Mr. J. P. Macneil, President of the Melbourne Chamber of Commerce;<br />Mr. G. MA. Hastie, President of the Sydney Chamber of Commerce;<br />Mr. Colin C. Baird, President, Australian Wholesale Softgoods<br />Federation; Mr. A. F. J. Smith, President, Associated Chambers<br />Export Council; and iMr. R. -Rowe, Director,<br />The representatives of the Associated Chambers of<br />Commerce submitted forcefully that, in their opinion, there was<br />an urgent need for Government action aimed at a reduction in the<br />level of unemployrnent and in restoring the confiaence of<br />consumers. The Associated Chambers of Commerce are of the<br />opinion that an increase in Local Government expend-iture would<br />have an immediate benefiuial effect on the employment position.<br />They also advocated fiscal measures designed, in particular, to<br />encourage and permit increased expenditure by families in the<br />middle and lower income groups.</p>
<p>The Associated Chambers also suggested that some<br />stimulus be gzven to home building because any expansion in this<br />field would have far reaching effects on the demand for a wide<br />variety of materials and equipment.<br />Mr. Menzies said that this had been a truly valuable<br />discussion which would be of great benefit to himself and all<br />his Cabinet colleagues. The views expressed and the proposals<br />submitted by the Associated Chambers of Commerce would be very<br />carefully considered by the Government as soon as the present<br />series of talks with representative sections of the Australian<br />economy was concluded.</p>
<p>Mr. Verco said that he and the other members of hisÂ delegation were pleased with the discussions they had had.</p>
