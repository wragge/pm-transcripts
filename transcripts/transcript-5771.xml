EMBARGO: 5.00 PM<br />
PRIME MINISTERg<br />
FOR MEDIA SUNDAY, 14 MARCH 1982<br />
ELECTORATE. TALK<br />
A few days aglo, in a speech to the Rarliament and to the<br />
nation, I drew attention to the increasingly troubled and<br />
uncertain worcld scene; to the tensions and threats to<br />
international security that exist; and to the prolonged recession<br />
in Europe and North America which has reduced world trade and<br />
world growth to a virtual standstill.<br />
We in Australia cannot ignore those developments. We live in<br />
a world that is increasingly interdependent, and we are<br />
inevitably affected by political and economic circumstances<br />
overseas. But, while there is no denying that we cannot turn<br />
our backs on developments elsewhere in the world, while there<br />
is no denying that they have a significant impact on us, our<br />
interdependea,, ce with the rest of the world does not make us<br />
totally captive to those developments. Interdependence does<br />
not imply: a complete loss of our independence. Rather it means<br />
that there are challenges to be faced; it means that the<br />
policies of Governments, and the attitudes and expectations<br />
of people must be shaped to face realistically the circumstance! s<br />
of the time.<br />
For most of the post4kwar period, our increasing links with the<br />
world economy and world financial markets have been positively<br />
beneficial. Along with the rest of the world, Australia benefited<br />
greatly from the significant growth of world trade and<br />
investment that occurred in the period following the war until<br />
the early 1970' s. Indeed because of our small domestic<br />
market, and our relatively small domestic supply of capital<br />
for investment, our ability to tap overseas markets is especiallyimportant<br />
to the growth of our real incomes. We look to others<br />
to provide markets for our products, and to enable our industries<br />
to achieve the scal of operations that enable them to be<br />
internationally competitive; we look to others to provide the<br />
specialised imports we need for industrial and resource development;<br />
and our real living standards have been raised by the willingness<br />
of others -to invest in Australia's industries and resource<br />
projects in co-operation with Australian capital and Australian<br />
management. The first of the dramatic oil. nce increases in -1973 marked the<br />
end of an era of rapid world growth, although the deterioration<br />
in economic stability and the associated acceleration in </p>
<p>-2<br />
world inflation were clearly apparent before those price rises<br />
occurred, and can be attributed in large part to excessive<br />
growth of Government spending and inappropriate deficit<br />
financing policies pursued by many countries. In Australia,<br />
the big spending big deficit policies of the Labor Government<br />
exacerbated problems that were already evident.<br />
When the present Government took office in 1975 we put into place<br />
policies designed to restore confidence, growth and prosperity<br />
to Australia against the background of an already weak world<br />
economic scene. We made the fight against inflation the<br />
cornerstone of our policies; and through restraint of<br />
Government spending, winding-back the budget deficit, and<br />
control of the money supply; through the provision of<br />
incentives to industry to invest, to undertake research and<br />
development and seek our new and expanded export markets;<br />
we succeeded in restoring confidence tothe private sector, and<br />
we gave it the room it needed to once again become the mainspring<br />
of growth and development. Moreover, through our decisive action<br />
in introducing import parity pricing for oil, and associated<br />
policies for old and new oil, we succeeded in revitalising the<br />
petroleum exploration and development industry, providing<br />
Australia with renewed activity and renewed security of supply.<br />
That our policies were right, that the right policies and<br />
attitudes can enable us to succeed against world trends, is<br />
convincingly demonstrated by Australia' s economic performance<br />
in recent years. For we have had economic growth at twice<br />
the average of other major industrialised countries in recent<br />
years, the highest rate of increase in business investment for<br />
three decades last financial year, and substantial growth in<br />
employment and in after tax real incomes over several years,<br />
while most of the major industrialised countries in Europe and<br />
North America have been struggling to maintain any growth at all.<br />
Indeed, following further substantial oil price increases in<br />
1978-79, their growth rates declined even more as they entered<br />
the 1980' s, their unemployment rates are high and rising, and<br />
because of high budget deficits and the associated need for<br />
stringent monetary policies in some countries, interest rates<br />
have risen to some of the highest levels the world has seen.<br />
At the same time, depressed demand and high unemployment has<br />
led their inflation rates to fall. Through trade and<br />
international capital flows we have now begun to feel the effects<br />
of these most recent developments, at a time when wage demands<br />
in Australia. have been growi ng.<br />
The current situation makes it all the more essential that the<br />
broad thrust. of our economic policies be maintained. With a<br />
weakened balance of payments and strong inflationary pressures,<br />
there can be no thought of allowing the money supply to<br />
expand to accommodate inflationary wage demands, and no thought<br />
of abandoning our careful and non-disruptive management of the<br />
/ 3 </p>
<p>3<br />
the exchange rate. With wage pressures and industrial disruption<br />
already affecting employment prospects, our initiatives to<br />
improve industrial relations and bring about a restructuring<br />
of unions are all the more essential; and with the need to<br />
seek lower taxation and a more balanced tax structure,<br />
while making provision for the essential needs of defence, the<br />
elderly and the disadvantaged, there can be no thought of<br />
abandoning our policies of restraining government spending.<br />
The objectives of the vast majority of Australians for<br />
themselves and for their children are plain. We seek rising<br />
living standards, and an increasingly compassionate and secure<br />
society, but one in which individuals are free to develop<br />
their talents and express their individuality in their own<br />
way. In difficult times such as those we experience at present<br />
we must accept that there are tighter limits on the rate at<br />
which our aspirations can be fulfilled.<br />
Above all we cannot, as a nation, afford to destroy the<br />
conditions which foster economic growth, for it is economic<br />
growth which makes it possible for us to satisfy our broader<br />
goal of developing further a strong, civilised and humane<br />
society. </p>
