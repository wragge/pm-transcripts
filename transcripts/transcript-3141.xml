PRIME MINISTER IN SOUTH-EAST ASIA:<br />
ADDRESS TO THAI-AUSTRALIA ASSOCIATION<br />
The following is the text of the Prime Minister's<br />
address to the Thai-Australia Association in Bangkok today,<br />
1 Februiary 1974.<br />
" I have had many occasions in Australia and overseas to<br />
stress, not just the change of policies of the new Australian<br />
Government, but the continuity within that change. Continuity<br />
' within change ~ is one of the themes of this current journey. Its<br />
re-assertion is one of the purposes of this visit. The relations<br />
between Thailand and Australia perfectly illustrate that theme.<br />
Thailand itself is a spendid example of national<br />
continuity within change, and of change within continuity and<br />
never more truly than in this crucial time in Thailand's long<br />
history, a time when men and women of goodwill around the world<br />
are drawing new hope, new encouragement, from the events in our<br />
region. Change of quite revolutionary dimension has been the very<br />
essence of the recent history of our region. One has only to<br />
consider that less than 30 years ago, of the six nations on my<br />
current itinerary, Thailand alone was independent. Or consider that<br />
in the great area from the old north-west frontier of India to the<br />
shore of the south west Pacific an area containing nearly a<br />
quarter of the world's people Thailand and Australia alone were not<br />
under colonial rule. This is one measure of the scope of change we<br />
have lived with and are still living with. The yearning for true<br />
national independence, for national dignity, which called this vast<br />
change into being is still the most powerful force in our region.<br />
That spirit has preserved the national identity and independence<br />
of Thailand for 700 years. It is the sort of spirit which the </p>
<p>Australian Government brings to its own affairs and to Australia's<br />
relations with its neighbours, its friends and its allies. We have<br />
tried to understand the aspiration of others as we wish others to<br />
try to understand our own aspirations.<br />
The Governments of both our countries have changed<br />
relatively recently. Of course we have both changed many of our<br />
policies. Ve are both striking out on new paths. But in both<br />
nations there is also a basic continuity of policies. Certainly in<br />
the case of Australia most publicity has naturally been given to the<br />
changes, to the new directions. Yet it cannot be stressed to much<br />
or too often that there is a basic continuity in the conduct of<br />
Australian affairs.<br />
Many of our decisions have been responses to developments<br />
in the relations between the great powers. We have tried to adapt<br />
promptly and intelligently to the new realities, particularly in<br />
our region. In some matters, such as normalisation of relations<br />
with China, we have been able to move more rapidly than some of our<br />
neighbours, including Thailand, but there can be no mistaking the<br />
dir ection events are leading us all. V~ hile developing new relationsnot<br />
just with China but in Africa and Latin America and Eastern<br />
Europe we have strengthened old friendships as well. This is very<br />
much the case with Thailand.<br />
We don't believe it is good enough that Australia should<br />
regard countries like Thailand and her A.:: an partners merely as<br />
some sort of military buffer placed by geography for Australia's<br />
convenience. We have defence arrangements with such countries.<br />
We continue to: but we want them to be viewed in the perspective<br />
of our total relation with the region. Far from losing interest in<br />
Thailand, the fact is that there has never been greater mutual<br />
interest and wider exchanges between the two countries than there<br />
is now. This interest is growing on both sides. Australia<br />
attaches great importance to the continuing well-being of an<br />
independent and forward-looking Thailand, a Thailand playing an<br />
active and cooperative role in the region and adjusting its<br />
policies skilfully to the developing international situation.<br />
Australia and Thailand are expanding their cooperation<br />
in all fields. More Australians than ever before are coming to </p>
<p>3.<br />
Thailand in my own case this ism ighth visit in the last<br />
fourteen years. Many Thais have stud-*' ed in Australia and more will<br />
come in the future. This cooperation has developed steadily over<br />
nearly 30 years, since Australia established a mission in Thailand.<br />
That mission was one of the first Australian posts to be opened in<br />
South-East Asia. A high point in the development of our relations<br />
was the visit to Australia in 1962 of their Majes-ties the King and<br />
Queen of Thailand. We have aiso been greatly honoured that his<br />
Royal Highness the Crown Prince is furthering his educatIon in<br />
Australia. Australians and Thais have for twenty years been<br />
cooperating in the development of Thailand. A number of joint<br />
projects are being undertaken in different areas of the country<br />
through the Australian aid program. Consultations have recently<br />
taken place between officials of our two governments on another<br />
important and innovative project. Through the efforts of<br />
HRH the Princess Mother, voluntary medical units have been set up<br />
in many provinces to improve health services for people in outlying<br />
areas. However, due to difficulties of communication, medical<br />
treatment is not readily available to large numbers of people in<br />
remote areas a similar situation to that in Australia which led<br />
to the creation of the Royal Flying Doctor Service. I am happy to<br />
announce that, in response to a request from the Government of<br />
Thailand, the Australian Goverrment will support the Princess<br />
Mother's Pioneering Medical Volunteers project by providing<br />
ambulances and radio transceivers. We hope that a pilot project<br />
to determine the exact requirements of the communications network<br />
will proceed in the near future. As a further example of<br />
cooperation, Prime Minister Sanya and I yesterday decided in<br />
principle on a cultural agreement between our two countries.<br />
Quite recently the Australian Government held discussions<br />
with ASEAN representatives in Bangkok on possible Australian<br />
assistance to ASEAN projects. l~ ight now my colleague, the<br />
Minister for Education, is in Bangkok for the conference of<br />
South-East Asian Ministers of Education Organisation at which we<br />
were represented for the first time as an associate member. We </p>
<p>4.<br />
recently participated for the first time in the Ministerial<br />
Conference for the Economic Development of South-East Asia.<br />
We are cooperating with the M~ ekong Scheme with its headquarters<br />
in Bangkok, which has such great potential as an instrument for<br />
the reconstruction of Indochina. In the wider region, we share<br />
common membership of ECAFE with its headquarters also in Bangkok.<br />
Later on I shall be making reference to SEATO, but I mention these<br />
other matters now to show how far we have moved from a restricted<br />
and restricting concept of our relations as being only, or even<br />
mainly, preoccupied with defence and security. Both our countries<br />
have a well-rounded relationship with each other. Both are anxious<br />
to see that it ripens and matures.<br />
To illustrate this, let me say something of our trade and<br />
economic relationships. There are long established and valued<br />
economic links between Australia and Thailand. Our total trade of<br />
some SA43 million last year is not as large as we would wish, but<br />
it has shown a rapid rise in recent years. For our part, we are<br />
confident that such growth will continue. We recognise, moreover,<br />
that trade must be viewed as a two-way flow. We have taken a<br />
number of initiatives to ensure that countries such as Thailand<br />
will have considerably greater opportunities, and greater<br />
encouragement, to sell to the Australian market. Last year we<br />
reduced all Australian tariffs by 25 per cent. In addition, from<br />
the beginning of this year, we have introduced for the benefit of<br />
developing countries a scheme whereby those countries will receive<br />
additional preferences -in the Australian tariff. We will continue<br />
to increase both the scope of the scheme and the margins of<br />
preference we accord until we are satisfied that the bveloping<br />
countries have achieved a competitive position in the Australian<br />
market. For this purpose my Government is establishing a facilitywithin<br />
the Australian Department of Overseas Trade to provide<br />
market research and to handle trade inquiries for countries such<br />
as Thailand. I invite the Government of Thailand to make use of<br />
it. Let me remind you also that we recognise the importance you<br />
attach to receiving fair and reasonable prices in international<br />
markets for your primary products. Our support in international<br />
forums for the basic justice of such an approach is well known<br />
and will continue. </p>
<p>Next a word about overseas investment. Australia<br />
recognises that in the right circumstances Australian private<br />
investment overseas can make a positive contribution to the<br />
industrial development of the host country. Although Australia<br />
in the past has not been a significant generator of capital for<br />
investment in overseas countries, we expect more activity-in this<br />
area in the future. We believe, however, that every country<br />
should have the right to regulate foreign investment in accordance<br />
with its own national aspirations and social and economic<br />
objectives. It is a right we exercise ourselves in relation to<br />
foreign investment in Australia. For that reason we have recently<br />
announced that we will seek to encourage Australian private<br />
investment overseas only where it is fully welcomed by the host<br />
country, where it will be favourable to the country in which it<br />
is made, and where it will be consistent with advanced labour<br />
relations and local environmental policies.<br />
I have said that Australia and Thailand have a wellrounded<br />
relationship which we want to see ripen and mature, We<br />
are bringing this approach to all our other relationships in the<br />
region. It is by understanding this basic approach that one can<br />
best understand the changes we have made. I can illustrate it<br />
by reference to some of the more notable of our policies.<br />
I mention the United States. We have an important<br />
defence treaty with U. S. and New Zealand but the American alliance<br />
should never have been regarded as thL-e be-all and end-all of<br />
Australia's., defence and foreign policies and it should never have<br />
been viewed solely or principally as a defence association. Yet<br />
there developed in Australia over a generation a tendency to view<br />
all matters beyond our shores through the single narrow focus of<br />
China. What we are now trying to do is widen the range of our<br />
vision not to downgrade the importance of our friendship with<br />
the U. S. but to upgrade the importance of other relationships,<br />
above all in Asia. We believe we are thereby creating a more<br />
mature partnership. And we believe that frankness is the best<br />
basis for friendship. We expect frankness: we intend to be<br />
frank. I should also refer to our relations with Japan. We<br />
are widening them beyond economics alone, important to both<br />
countries as that aspect is. Japan is Australia's biggest </p>
<p>customer: we are Japan's second biggest customer after the<br />
United States. Obviously therefore, Australia's prosperity is.<br />
closely linked with Japan's. We recognise Japan's need for<br />
secure access at fair prices to the raw materials her industries<br />
need, and so much of which Australia can provide. At the same<br />
time, the Australian people want a fair say and a fair share in<br />
the control and use of our own resources, just as the Thai<br />
people recognise that investment and trade relations between.<br />
states not merely the states of our own region must<br />
henceforth take account of the welfare and aspirations of the<br />
peoples of those states and cannot be based solely on business<br />
criteria alone. I come now to China. Australia' s new relations with<br />
China are based on the rejection of the relevance today of the<br />
Dulles concept of military containment of China. The war of<br />
intervention in Viet-Nam was created by that doctrine and<br />
destroyed that doctrine. SEATO itself was originally ihe treaty<br />
expression of the doctrine. Clearly our view of the concept which<br />
gave birth to SEATO influences our view of SEATO's present role.<br />
When we addressed ourselves to this matter on assuming office<br />
14 months ago it was urged upon us that withdrawal by Australia<br />
would damage confidence in the area. With an understanding of<br />
the position of Thailand particularly in mind, and the importance<br />
Thailand attaches to the Manila Treaty, we therefore agreed to<br />
work within the organisation for modification of its operation<br />
and orientation: underpin confidence, yes., underwrite<br />
containment, no. And with the cooperation and agreement of all<br />
members, this is what we have done.<br />
Finally I mention our attitude towards regional<br />
arrangements and associations. Of all those in this region,<br />
ASEAN is unquestionably the most important, the most relevant,<br />
the most natural. Australia does not seek to be a member of<br />
ASEAN, though we have close bi-lateral and regional relationships<br />
with all its members. My present tour takes me to four ASEAN<br />
capitals. With each member country and with Indonesia, our<br />
nearest neighbour, we are developing ever-increasing cooperation<br />
at all levels, including defence cooperation. Australia is<br />
playing a cooperative role in the other regional associations I </p>
<p>7.<br />
mentioned earlier. We are strengthening all our bi-lateral<br />
relations in the region and are seeking new forms of regional<br />
7 cooperation. Increasingly I believe the nations of the Asian<br />
and Pacific region will in the future come to see the need for<br />
a wider forum than presently exists where all who have a common<br />
interest and a common destiny in the region can meet regularly,<br />
quietly and constructively. On this matter I just say two<br />
things here: nobody, least of all me, believes that any new<br />
arrangements will come into being overnight; and secondly,<br />
nobody, certainly not me, believe that any such arrangements<br />
should or could supplant or absorb ASE. AN.<br />
I recognise too that the continuing conflict in<br />
Indochina our hopes of a year ago being still unfulfilled<br />
represents a major obstruction to any plans for new arrangements<br />
in our region. But the need remains, and I believe that<br />
perception of that need will grow and sharpen.<br />
It should be plain therefore that the direction of our<br />
decisions and hopes are outward-looking, regional and truly<br />
international. It is absurd to suggest that Australia is going<br />
isolationist when the whole thrust of our policies is towards<br />
greater international cooperation than ever before, towards<br />
deeper interests in a greater number of nations in every<br />
continent than ever before some of them nations which have<br />
hitherto scarcely made a scratch upon the Australian<br />
consciousness. New interests do not mean a loss or lessening<br />
of old interests. They mean rather a widening of Australian<br />
awareness, a realisation by Australians of their capacities,<br />
their responsibilities and their opportunities. Australia has<br />
not grown weary of international involvement, whatever our<br />
d'isillusionment as a result of Viet-Nam.<br />
That experience, the Viet-Nam experience, when<br />
Australian youth decided no longer to tolerate the intolerable,<br />
just as the youth of Thailand, in a very different context,<br />
did so decisively last October still deeply influenlces our<br />
judgments upon the affairs of this region and<br />
believe we should make to events in this region. n:-<br />
government we would be if our attitudes, declared tr\<. za=""></.>
decade when we were powerless to act, were discarded "' c~ cc~<br />
r </p>
<p>we had the power to translate those attitudes into action.<br />
That would have been true unpredictability, true irresponsibility.<br />
Decidedly Australia has not grown weary of being<br />
involved: we have simply come of age. We draw a distinction<br />
between constructive involvement and counter-productive<br />
intervention. I hope that what my Government has been able to<br />
show is an Australian capacity for self-renewal, just as this<br />
ancient kingdom is demonstrating its capacity for renewal and<br />
resilience, for change in a world of change, without rejecting<br />
its traditions but rather involving the very essence of its<br />
national tradition as the instrument of ordered change itself."<br />
