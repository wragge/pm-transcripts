E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
I was at a function about a year ago it was the presentation of the Australian<br />
Artists Creative Fellowships, and John Olsen the great Australian artist I was<br />
giving him a gift, or a prize, or a fellowship, I can't remember, and he said " well,<br />
there are only two kinds", he said, " of Australians". He said " there are lovers,<br />
and others". I mean, we often think of the others, don't we? And Manning Clark<br />
he put It another way talked about the enlargers and the straiteners the<br />
people who could always see something bigger, and those who said get your<br />
head down, be serious, grind away, conform stay in the groove. And this has<br />
always been the great divider in Australian life and also, may I say, in<br />
Australian politics. And the reason that I am here today is to say something nice<br />
about an enlarger, a lover, a person who has belief and imagination who<br />
believes in things, and imagines better things, and goes out and does them.<br />
And I am very pleased to have the opportunity, and as I read through the book<br />
it is a very blokey book, there Is no doubt about that, but what an interesting<br />
bloke. A quintessential Sydney larrikin crazy-brave, self-contained anyone<br />
who does an around the world solo voyage has enormous inner confidence and<br />
self-esteem. And this is a very complete person he may represent himself as a<br />
fellow who rode around on motorbikes, and lost a $ 20 million property empire,<br />
who sailed around the world and did all these sort of things, but he is a very<br />
complete individual, and I think that's why we are all here.<br />
And the thing we celebrate is the fact not simply his personality and his verve,<br />
and his courage but the fact that a lot of Australians have seen in him some of<br />
themselves. And Clean Up Australia Is the classic piece of community action -I<br />
mean, just last week we were talking about the celebration of a victory a great<br />
community victory in the Second World War. A commemoration of those who<br />
have lost. And you can think through all the events, and the ones that strike </p>
<p>TEL: 2<br />
your heart are the ones that mean something are the community ones the ones<br />
that have got real weight in them, where we have come together to do things.<br />
And I think Ian pricking the consciousness of Australians about the environment,<br />
and alsoL showing some of his own personality in the doing of it, many<br />
Australians have recognised in him some of the good things they see about<br />
themselves. And the aspirations they have to do things together. I think that is<br />
why he has become important to us, and why what he has done with the<br />
environment has been Important. It is the same with Fred Hollows It wasn't that<br />
long ago that nobody knew of Fred Hollows but when people got a view of him,<br />
to see how selflessly he had given of his time, of the larrikin spirit, but the<br />
commitment to people there was again that point of identification. And I think<br />
that's what we are really celebrating today. It's not the writing, or the outrageous<br />
story and it is a sort of outrageous story.<br />
I mean, of course, it is a quintessential Sydney-siders book. This couldn't have<br />
been written by somebody from Victoria. Because it's partly, you know, you ran<br />
read the bits through it I mean for instance, he loves the sea. I mean, if you<br />
stand here and look out, how could you not love the sea? How could you not<br />
love those headlands, which are I mean, they are bit pock-marked by<br />
development but by and large they are really as it would have been before we<br />
all turned up in 1788. And, you know, I remember as a boy myself a mate of<br />
mine used to ring me whenever there was a really big storm on the Harbour, we<br />
would catch the Manly ferry we would be the only two on it. And you would get<br />
in the dip over here, and the waves would slosh right through out to the other<br />
side, you know you would be going for the ride, just to enjoy it. And out there<br />
on the city harbour, sailing on weekends, one of my stunts was that I used to get<br />
the train from Bankstown to Circular Quay, get in my gear, and then I would jump<br />
off the back of the ferry, and the boat would pick me up. And of course they<br />
would yell out " man overboard", and they would say " oh, it's all right he has<br />
been rescued". Sailing up to Pittwater what a beautiful place that is, the<br />
Hawkesbury River. And there is all this sense of Sydney, and the water, and we<br />
are sort of drawn to it. You know, you get this impression I know Ian has all his<br />
life, you can tell by the book everything about him is completely salty, you<br />
know.<br />
Arnd also his interest in the built environment very interesting when the worst of<br />
the packing-case architecture was being built, every good was being smashed,<br />
he was out there trying to preserve the terraces In Woolloomoolco. I used to do<br />
the Max Dupain pilgrimage when I was a boy, around all of Max's sites you<br />
know, Lyndhurst at Glebe, or Tusculum up at Kings Cross, or the great Elizabeth<br />
Bay house, or all of the not so remarkable terraces, all the bits and pieces. You<br />
know, you saw the greater view of people you had a sense that we might not<br />
have the architectural heritage of the United States, but what we have, we ought<br />
to try and lift it. And if not lift it, keep it keep those parts that we did have. And<br />
so, you know, we see him in here being interested in this, and this is a very<br />

interesting minds-eye picture of someone who was interested in Sydney at that<br />
time, when really, nobody cared about these things a lot of the stuff was<br />
smashed up during this period. So he is building those, and in the sense of this<br />
very successful restaurant which is here, I mean it could have failed of course,<br />
and no doubt the restaurateur has made a success of it, but it is hard not to with<br />
the view, and the place, and everything else. But he saw the opportunity.<br />
And I think all of this has been about.. the concern about the environment has<br />
been in him, somewhat perhaps latently before his experience in the Sargasso<br />
Sea, or in Hawaii in the Clean Ups, but he has seen the great marvellous<br />
opportunity that we have been given as Australians to have bequeathed to us<br />
this ancient continent. I mean, how could we have been so lucky? That just 200<br />
years ago I mean, we are now in our 5S, 4 times our lifetime there were no<br />
Europeans here. The Aboriginal community in this country has preserved for<br />
the rest of us a continent. And we have a great duty to it, to understand what<br />
we have been given, and to understand that we have to protect it, and that we<br />
may hold here something unique in the world. Because I think our<br />
consciousness about it Is now such that we will take the steps to hang onto it,<br />
and to make sure that the style of life we have, and our respect for the land, is<br />
that which may have the equal in the world, but none better. Now, Ian has<br />
brought that consciousness up in the Clean Up campaigns of Sydney Harbour,<br />
and then of course, Clean Up Australia the hundreds of cities and provincial<br />
towns, the thousands of people that have been involved, lifting their<br />
environmental consciousness. And that is really lifting the sub-conscious on the<br />
greater environmental issues he is right when he said earlier that the<br />
environment will win out. It is the political issue that won't be put asunder. No<br />
amount of smarmy political talk is going to put it down, because if for no other<br />
reason, our children know better than perhaps we have ever known about it.<br />
They know what a great and valuable thing it is.<br />
So, this I think this coalescence of the community view which [ an has brought<br />
there, through his own essential goodness and view about the country is why<br />
we celebrate his book today. I mean, some of the other things in the book are<br />
terrific reading when he went around Cape Horn and he said that he could<br />
barely see the light, but he got up and had a drink. And he mentioned that he<br />
thought about a few people, but he said something about being a bit shaky it<br />
was all a bit Shaky. Well, I would be a bit shaky going around Cape Horn. I<br />
mean, to even make a commentary on the light. I mean, the book Is really a bit<br />
of a thriller in its own way, but there are some funny lines he said " oh, I thought<br />
I should have cleaned up the boat because people would think that I was such a<br />
grubby bastard". You know, that sort of self-deprecation gives us again another<br />
Indication of his personalty, and his essentially humility. People who do<br />
things are it doesn't necessarily mean that they are not humble, but I have<br />
always thought about Ian that there is a humility about him. But there is a<br />
crucible in there too there is a reactor in there, throwing up ideas you can see </p>

in his own commitment to move into another phase of his life after, lIf you like,<br />
this book, to go on to the next phase. -I mean, I like to think maybe it is just a<br />
case of boating your own drum about the baby-boom generation, but by God, we<br />
had a lot of go in us, I have got to say. We had a lot of I'm not too sure how to<br />
say it "' chutzpah". I'm not too sure how It comes out, but there was a lot of go.<br />
And I think he is a classic baby-boomer I mean, he is out there maybe a bit<br />
earlier than that, maybe you just crept into that category tan, I don't know. But<br />
one thing is for sure as a generation, they have made a huge impact on<br />
Australia. And the other thing is, they have a great belief in Australia, and the<br />
Australian nation as an Independent country, as an independent culture, as a<br />
force of our own that deserves the support.<br />
So I am here with the very pleasant duty of launching the book, to pay a<br />
compliment to Phil ( Jarratt) for joining Ian In writing it he has this pattern of<br />
( Phil, I am saying) of finding people worth bothering with, and writing about them<br />
or helping them to write their story, and these are important parts of the<br />
Australian story, and we will always be in his debt for that. To the publishers<br />
James ( Fraser) for taking a chance on a blokey book, but most particularly, we<br />
are here to celebrate in a sense the recording of an interesting Australian life.<br />
To say how much it has meant to the rest of us, that this life has brought<br />
together a sense of community around this question of the continent, and the<br />
landscape, but somebody who is a quintessential Australian who believes In<br />
this country, and who loves It, and who wants to dream the big dreams, and do<br />
the big things. As I say, it's the belief and the imagination which has brought us<br />
to his restaurant of 20 years ago. Congratulations Ian it is a pleasure to launch<br />
the book, and I am very happy to be associated with it, and with you. Thank you.<br />
ends. </p>
