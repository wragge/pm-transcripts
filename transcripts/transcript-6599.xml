PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 27 February 1985<br />
JOINT STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER AND PREMIER OF NEW SOUTH WALES<br />
The Premier, Mr Mulock, Dr Blewett and I met yesterday with<br />
the Federal President of the AMA, Dr Lindsay Thompson, and<br />
other members of his negotiating team.<br />
We give an unequivocal guarantee that it is not the intention<br />
of our Governments, or the Australian Labor Party, to<br />
nationalise medical practice in Australia.<br />
We recognise that it is vital to the continuation of high<br />
medical standards in Australia to promote and encourage<br />
private practice in public hospitals.<br />
~-Yesterday's meeting identified a number of matters which are<br />
~ central to achieving this objective. Firm proposals on these<br />
matters will be put to Cabinet in two weeks time. Specific<br />
announcements on their implementation will follow.<br />
They are:<br />
1. Arrangements to make private health insurance more affordable.<br />
2. The automatic classification of privately insured persons<br />
as private patients unless they make a positive decision to<br />
be public.<br />
3. Reduction in the cost of being treated as a private patient,<br />
by requiring only a single $ 10 gap for all the medical<br />
services required during a hospital admission.<br />
4. The principle of community rating should be reinforced. The<br />
Commonwealth Government will take positive action to ensure<br />
that the cost of hospital insurance is fair for all<br />
Australians.<br />
The above matters, which contribute to ensuring a suitable mix<br />
of public and private patients in public hospitals will be<br />
discussed with all State Governments and the Voluntary Health<br />
Insurance Association of Australia during the next week.<br />
The Governments have accepted the need for additional funding<br />
for teaching hospitals. We have asked the AMA to put forward<br />
specific proposals on the funding needs of the teaching<br />
hospitals. These proposals will also be considered as a matter<br />
of priority by Cabinet. </p>
<p>2.<br />
Detailed negotiations on methods of remuneration to doctors<br />
for the treatment of public patients are proceeding.<br />
Discussions are also continuing on several other complex issues<br />
brought forward by the AMA.<br />
The current negotiations are vital to a sensible settlement of<br />
this prolonged dispute which has caused severe hardship to the<br />
sick and injured. The negotiations will proceed while the NSW<br />
medical profession follows the AMA's call to make themselves<br />
available for normal duties. </p>
