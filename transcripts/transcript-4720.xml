I PRIME<br />
FOR PRESS 23 MAY 1978<br />
WHALING INQUIRY SUBMISSION<br />
Work is well in hand on the preparation of the Government's<br />
submission to the Independent Whaling Inquiry to be conducted<br />
by Sir Sydney Fxost.<br />
Departments are conferring to consolidate their views in a<br />
single submission. It will bring together in one paper all<br />
views on the various aspects with which the Government is<br />
involved in relation to the Terms of Reference of the Inquiry.<br />
This will ensure that Sir Sydney Frost obtains a complete<br />
submission from the Government. </p>
