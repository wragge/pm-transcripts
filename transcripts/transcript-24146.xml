    <content><![CDATA[<p>Well it's great to be here on this perfect Canberra evening and it's an honour to be in the company of Ben Robert-Smith and so many other great Australians.</p>
<p>Tomorrow we will celebrate the ties that bind us, the values that sustain us and the history that has shaped us. But tonight, we usher in our national day of celebration by honouring the best in our people and the best of our people.</p>
<p>We honour those who have dedicated themselves to building a better Australia.</p>
<p>All of them have had a go so that all of us might have a fair go.</p>
<p>The Australian of the Year nominees encourage us to be people who live for others, rather than for ourselves.</p>
<p>They come from all parts of our country; young and old, indigenous, immigrant, from the city, from the bush.</p>
<p>They're entrepreneurs, musicians, neurosurgeons, parents, carers, activists.</p>
<p>They represent the many who have become one united country here in Australia and they remind us that, good as we are, we are always striving to be better.</p>
<p>Nearly all of this year's nominees have faced adversity but they have persevered and that's what inspires us.</p>
<p>So, I say to each of them â you make all of us proud to be Australian and you inspire all of us to be better Australians.</p>
<p>Tonight, our nation honours you and we thank you for your lives of courage, achievement and determination.</p>
