PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P. J. KEATING MP<br />
DOORSTOP, MANUKA OVAL, WEDNESDAY, 9 NOVEMBER 1994<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
J: Prime Minister, who would you like to see as your opponent at the next<br />
election Mr Howard or Mr Downer?<br />
PM: I see Mr Howard is out there on the air waves today, as I said, once<br />
there is any whiff of mortality around, he starts hearing voices,<br />
becomes a visionary again. But, as you know, Mr Howard's vision is a<br />
vision of the 1950s. So, if you want to really tune into his thoughts you<br />
need a big trip down the time tunnel.<br />
ends<br />
