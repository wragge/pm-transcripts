    <content><![CDATA[<p>  I am pleased to announce that Nelson Mandela has agreed that Australian<br />
   Development Scholarships awarded to South Africans will now be known as<br />
   the Australian Mandela Scholarships.</p>
<p>  The Australian Government will offer 20 scholarships, worth $A1.3 million<br />
   (5.2 million Rand), to South Africa under the Australia Mandela Scholarship<br />
   Scheme.</p>
<p>  The awards will be offered to academic staff and administrators at South<br />
   African higher education institutions and will be for post graduate study<br />
   at Australian Universities at Masters level.</p>
<p>  The scholarships are a key initiative of Australia's Capacity Building programme<br />
   with South Africa and are designed to provide staff at South African Technikons<br />
   with the opportunity to upgrade their skills and qualifications.</p>
<p>  Australia recognises the importance of education to economic and social<br />
   development in South Africa and will continue to be actively involved in<br />
   working with South Africa in this sector.</p>
<p>  I will meet a number of this year's Mandela Scholarship nominees at a reception<br />
   following the investiture of former President Nelson Mandela with Australia's<br />
   highest honour, the Honorary Companion of the Order of Australia.</p>
<p>  The investiture will take place at the Australian High Commissioner's Residence<br />
   in Pretoria on 15 November and will be my last official function before<br />
   departure for Australia.</p>
