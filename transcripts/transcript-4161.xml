JAVVLI<br />
PRIME MINISTER 17th June, 1976.<br />
Speech given by the Prime Minister, at the Return Banquet Japan.<br />
It was quite soon after the Australian Elections that I<br />
decided to make this visit to your country.<br />
I have long believed that the quality of the relationship<br />
between Australia and Japan is of enormous importance to both<br />
our countries.<br />
Its importance, I believe, extends beyond our two countries<br />
to the western Pacific region as a whole.<br />
For this reason my Government has placed considerable weight on<br />
consolidating that relationship, and as far as possible,<br />
dispelling uncertainties that might stand in the way of further<br />
broadening the links between us.<br />
I have felt that my visit would give recognition to the extent<br />
of the relationship which has developed and help chart its<br />
future course.<br />
I have particularly valued, Mr. Prime Minister, the opportunity<br />
to discuss with you the various matters which properly and<br />
inevitably arias in the growing relationship between<br />
Australia and Japan.<br />
I have appreciated the frankness and scope of our discussions,<br />
and the further contribution I believe these discussions have<br />
made to mutual understanding.<br />
Though we trace our cultural inheritance through different lines<br />
it is clear that Australia and Japan now have much in commons<br />
Both Japan and Australia are democratic, industrialised,<br />
Island countries:<br />
Both are nations which take pride in the extent and<br />
quality of their trade, and look to expand that trade:<br />
Both are located in the Western Pacific, and both<br />
recognise interests in the peace and security of that<br />
regionj Both have a special treaty relationship with-the United<br />
States, which we each approach with a strong recognition<br />
of the independent contribution we make to that<br />
relationship. se/ 2 </p>
<p>In a world suffering from disturbing forces of instability it<br />
is to these alliances that we look as the most important means<br />
of actively supplementing the efforts we make to protect our<br />
own security.<br />
These shared concerns arising from the commnon elements in<br />
our situation have been very much in mind during our discussions.<br />
We have, of course, been mainly concerned with matters particularly<br />
related to the Japan-Australia relationship.<br />
The basic treaty has recognised the extent to which our interests<br />
have become complementary and our peoples interdependent.<br />
It gives a new political dimension to Australia-Japan<br />
relations. One indication of the importance we attach to<br />
this treaty is the fact that Japan is the only country<br />
with which we have concluded a treaty of friendship.<br />
The mere existence of the treaty will not mean that no uncertainties<br />
or difficulties can arise between us:<br />
In an economic relationship as extensive as ours,<br />
problems will inevitably develop from time to time:<br />
The treaty will, however, provide a frame-work within<br />
which problems can be more easily solved.<br />
Much of our discussion has dealt with matters arising from our<br />
commercial relationship.<br />
* We hkve discussed the question of assuring access to<br />
to each other's markets, and conditions for investment<br />
in Australia..<br />
On both these issues I have made it clear that Australia will<br />
act fully within the spirit of the treaty we have just concluded.<br />
Japan can be assured of fair and equitable treatment.<br />
I think we have been able to dispel a number of doubts and pave<br />
the way for an even closer economic relationship.<br />
our discussions hAve not been limited to economic matters<br />
neither in their content nor in their significance.<br />
The treaty recognises the need for a broader-relationship.<br />
In our disucssions we have reached agreement on the heed for greater<br />
cultural and social exhanges.<br />
Australia has taken action towards these ends throughl </p>
<p>-3-<br />
The establishment of the Australia Japan foundation;<br />
Regular exhange visits by parliamentary delegations;<br />
Arrangements for the attachment of Japanese civil servants<br />
to the Australian Public Service;<br />
Proposals for expanded cultural contacts, and<br />
greater co-operation in science.<br />
In our discussions on international issues we have similarly found<br />
accord.<br />
This is not at all surprising. We Eare so many basic interests.<br />
We both place a high value on our alliances.<br />
But we are not, for that reason, any less concerned to<br />
develop constructive and co-operative relations with all<br />
countries in the neighbourhood that are prepared to<br />
reciprocate.<br />
We share an interest in the peaceful development of Asia<br />
and the Pacific.<br />
We are both concerned that the pattern of relationships<br />
between countries in the area and the strategic balance<br />
there should be stable.<br />
As nations for whom trade is so important, we both need<br />
reliable and secure access to the large consumer markets<br />
of the world.<br />
Our discussions have taken place against this background of<br />
common interests.<br />
There has also been another very important element the generous<br />
hospitality and the unfailing kindness you have shown me during<br />
my visit.<br />
I take this opportunity to express my sincere appreciation. </p>
