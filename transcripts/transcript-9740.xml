PRIME MINISTER<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P. J. KEATING MP<br />
NATIVE TITLE ACT AMENDMENT<br />
The Government has considered the possible impact on the Native Title Act<br />
1993 of the High Court's decision in the Brandy case.<br />
The process in the Native Title Act for the registration and enforcement of<br />
agreed or unopposed determinations made by the National Native Title<br />
Tribunal is similar to the registration and enforcement scheme under the<br />
Racial Discrimination Act 1975. The RDA scheme was held by the High Court<br />
in Brandy to be invalid, as it vested Commonwealth judicial power in a body<br />
other than a court.<br />
The Government has decided to ensure the validity of the Native Title Act<br />
scheme by amending the Act so that native title claims are commenced and<br />
formally determined in the Federal Court. Details of the proposals are being<br />
sent to indigenous groups, industry groups, State and Territory Governments<br />
and other stakeholders and there will be an opportunity for meetings on the<br />
proposals. We will not be making wholesale changes to the Native Title Act.<br />
The proposed amendments are of a technical nature, dealing with the way in<br />
which claims are made and determined. There will be no shift away from the<br />
principles of recognition and protection of native title enshrined in the Act and<br />
the amendments will reflect the current balance of interests.<br />
The Government intends to introduce a Bill for the proposed amendments<br />
into Parliament later in the current Parliamentary Sittings.<br />
