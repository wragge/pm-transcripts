<p>JONES:</p>
<p>The Prime Minister is on the line in our studio in Canberra. Prime</p>
<p> Minister, good morning.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Good morning Alan, nice to talk to you.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>You have been around a bit.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I have indeed.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, here we go again, 60 families hopelessly devastated</p>
<p> in the Southern Tablelands of New South Wales. You are aware they</p>
<p> have been hit by fires, some have lost everything. They are on the</p>
<p> brink of destruction and on their survival because they are small</p>
<p> country communities.....[problem with sound]...I was</p>
<p> just simply saying that these families in that area in the Southern</p>
<p> Tablelands have lost everything but on them depends a whole raft of</p>
<p> other jobs Â– shearers, mechanics, bakers, auctioneers, wool classers,</p>
<p> fencers and so on. But still no national disaster fund to meet their</p>
<p> need.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Alan, the answer to that is that there are disaster arrangements which</p>
<p> come into operation and over a year involve millions of dollars to</p>
<p> help people affected by all manner of disasters. There are joint arrangements</p>
<p> between the Commonwealth and the States and these arrangements have</p>
<p> worked pretty well. That's not to say they can't be improved</p>
<p> and it's not to say that governments don't give money over</p>
<p> and above what is available under them. But I am not sure that if</p>
<p> you had a national disaster fund you would necessarily over a longer</p>
<p> period of time end up having a better level of assistance than operates</p>
<p> at present.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>Well, I wish someone in your Government though, with respect, would</p>
<p> speak to the people at Katherine, Wollongong, Gunnedah....</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I spoke to the people at Katherine.....</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>Moree. Well, I have got a file a foot high, John.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I know and I went to Katherine and....</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>These people....</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>There were millions of dollars put into....</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>Yes, I know that.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, I have to defend the Government because I actually went to Katherine</p>
<p> and I spent quite a bit of time there and I saw that special arrangements</p>
<p> were made in relation to insurance and John Fahey got the relevant</p>
<p> companies together. I mean, we....and we did relax the rules in</p>
<p> relation to the payment of money for individuals who were in difficult</p>
<p> circumstances. I mean, I would....</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>It comes nowhere near...like in Innisfail, they have just had a</p>
<p> $150 million sugarcane industry wiped out up there in flood. I mean,</p>
<p> to fence, just to fence those areas that have been absolutely damaged,</p>
<p> fences one farm alone $345,000 worth of fences have gone. $593,000</p>
<p> dead sheep, that's a stud sheep farm. It's gone, they've</p>
<p> gone. 1500 shot. $73,000 in yards and [inaudible]. I am telling you</p>
<p> Prime Minister, those people are getting no assistance for that.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, there is assistance going under the arrangements to people in</p>
<p> Queensland and I spoke to the Queensland Premier on two occasions.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>He's asking you to create a national disaster fund.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I am sorry, Premiers always ask for some structural change. I have</p>
<p> asked Mr Beattie to put certain proposals to me in relation to the</p>
<p> particular problems of Queensland and if they are reasonable and if</p>
<p> they are things that ought to be borne by the Commonwealth then we'll</p>
<p> have a look at them.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>But you have just been to New Zealand.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>They have an earthquake and damages fund and that covers areas of</p>
<p> risk which are excluded from standard insurance policies or where</p>
<p> individuals are faced with circumstances they cannot possibly control.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes, I accept that but Alan you can't translate everything that</p>
<p> operates in another country to Australia. There's things New</p>
<p> Zealand doesn't have that we have. I mean, I accept your point....</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>But these people in the Southern Tablelands are allowed to borrow</p>
<p> $80,000 at concessional interest rates for up to 10 years. They are</p>
<p> already borrowed to their maximum and anyway they now have no means</p>
<p> of repaying anything. They don't have a farm, a fence, a yard,</p>
<p> an animal, a stock, a bull or a merino ram.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Alan, I am aware of that and....</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>Well, what do we do?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, John Fahey went to....</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>John Fahey lives there.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, he lives in part of it, he doesn't live in the area that</p>
<p> was most directly affected.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>No, no, no, but he is from the Southern Tablelands.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Of course he is so he....</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>[Inaudible]</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Alan, could I just finish please? He has visited areas that have been</p>
<p> affected and he will be in Cabinet this morning and we will be having</p>
<p> a discussion about it. And he will be reporting on what he saw.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>But see last week he was in the same Cabinet and issued a press release.</p>
<p> The same man, John Fahey, indicated that he would be refurbishing</p>
<p> the Australian Embassy in Berlin for $44 million. Now, PM, we are</p>
<p> not fair dinkum are we, we are not fair dinkum?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I suppose you could, you could criticise....using that kind</p>
<p> of argument, Alan, with respect, you could criticise every single</p>
<p> item of capital works expenditure by a government, Labor, Liberal,</p>
<p> State or Federal. You could always say that buying an embassy building</p>
<p> is not as important as something else. You could literally let every</p>
<p> single building that Australia owns overseas run down. You could never</p>
<p> have any residences in which....</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>I don't hear anyone saying that. The $44 million when farmers</p>
<p> are out there on the absolute [inaudible]. $30 million for a Constitutional</p>
<p> Convention. $15 million for funding a....</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Democracy is always expensive because if you're to give everybody</p>
<p> a say you have to spend money. I know the Constitutional Convention</p>
<p> was, the cost of it was criticised by a lot of people but it was a</p>
<p> commitment and....</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>$30 million.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I know that. Well, we are having a referendum at the end of the year</p>
<p> and people can have their say.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>How would you like to be a farmer with only 740 acres and the lot</p>
<p> burnt out? Every animal destroyed. 500, you only had 500 sheep, they</p>
<p> are all gone. Where does that bloke find any money tomorrow to be</p>
<p> able to afford a loan or anything?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Alan, I don't deny for a moment just how difficult it is. Of</p>
<p> course it's difficult and we'll be getting from John and</p>
<p> also from Mark Vaile who has been to Queensland an assessment of both</p>
<p> of those disasters. But your listeners should understand that there</p>
<p> are standing arrangements that automatically come into operation that</p>
<p> provide people with financial assistance in these circumstances. And</p>
<p> those arrangements every year involve the outlay and it's money</p>
<p> fairly and properly and well spent outlays of millions of dollars</p>
<p> each year. The idea that absolutely nothing goes to people...</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>I am not saying nothing.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, sometimes one can get the feeling from....</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>From people like Alan Jones?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, I would never say that. Sometimes one can get the feeling from</p>
<p> some reports of these issues that the Government are completely insensitive,</p>
<p> indifferent and cold.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>Well, you ask in Cabinet today, you ask in Cabinet today how many</p>
<p> forms a farmer will have to fill out, you ask to put all the cards</p>
<p> on the table. How many forms will a farmer have to fill out before</p>
<p> he can actually be considered for this sort of limited relief? I mean,</p>
<p> this bloke has got, I am sorry to bore you with this, but....</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Alan, this is not boring.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>Right. Well, this bloke has got to replace, he has got to replace</p>
<p> his water crops, he has got to replace his gate, he has got to re-establish</p>
<p> pastures with fertiliser, he has got to find the cost of replacing</p>
<p> stock, he has got to replace the loss of his earnings on the wool</p>
<p> because it's gone. Then there's an economic loss to the</p>
<p> community. There will be no hearing, no wages to wool classers. He</p>
<p> has got to try and find off-farm income to somehow keep him going.</p>
<p> He has got to find alternative sources of heating because all the</p>
<p> firewood has been destroyed and winter is coming up. I am glad it's</p>
<p> him and not me.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, Alan, I think every Australian sympathises with the farmer particularly</p>
<p> in a time of drought or a time of fire or flood. And that issue will</p>
<p> certainly be canvassed this morning.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>Do you know that in every insurance policy, some of these people aren't</p>
<p> insured because they couldn't afford the insurance, they couldn't</p>
<p> even afford to go to the dentist, some of them, and they've done</p>
<p> it very tough. And you know what commodity prices have been like.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Very low.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>Very low. And a policy of one farmer who rang me yesterday Â–</p>
<p> and farmers are pretty tough people and his voice was quivering and</p>
<p> he was in tears - $1580, but $227.44 of that goes on government charges</p>
<p> and there's a stamp duty component on top of that as well. I</p>
<p> mean, government levies are $227.44, stamp duty, $180.67.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I hate to intrude a political element into this but one of the</p>
<p> advantages of our taxation policy is to remove many of those State</p>
<p> government charges. But putting that aside...</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>If those same fire-fighters, just so that you know, down here where</p>
<p> this has just devastated them, these people at Â– these people</p>
<p> at Crookwell supply their own vehicles, their own petrol, their own</p>
<p> motors and pumps. They financially support the bushfire brigade with</p>
<p> a voluntary levy. They say we give billions of dollars in foreign</p>
<p> aid to countries in need and it's all in cash, why can't</p>
<p> these people get a slice of that action?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, Alan, the answer to that is they do. And the answer is also</p>
<p> that we do not give a disproportionate amount in foreign aid. We give</p>
<p> I think 0.27% of our GDP in foreign aid which is not high by historic</p>
<p> standards, many people argue we should give me. We try and get the</p>
<p> balance right. There is a national interest in having stable countries</p>
<p> around us because they are more likely to be able to buy things from</p>
<p> us, including the produce for farms. The idea that it is just giving</p>
<p> money away with no return for Australia to have foreign aid is wrong.</p>
<p> The more prosperous those countries are the more they can buy from</p>
<p> us. So there is, as well as a genuine altruism and a genuine humanitarian</p>
<p> component, there's also a national self-interest involved in</p>
<p> foreign aid. So, once again, I think it is simplistic to say, well,</p>
<p> because there's a difficulty here you cut out all foreign aid.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>The New South Wales Government has stuck $50,000 into the Crookwell</p>
<p> bushfire appeal. Will the Commonwealth be matching that?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I'm told, yes. I'm told Mr Fahey announced it yesterday.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>Okay. So we have more disasters down the track somewhere and we'll</p>
<p> just still keep going, jumping through these same hoops. Carr and</p>
<p> Beattie have asked you to look into the issue of a national disaster</p>
<p> fund, will you at least consider it?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>We have considered it in the past and you never close your mind to</p>
<p> something like this. But the arrangements we have in operation at</p>
<p> the moment whereby once the expenditure of a State on disaster relief</p>
<p> goes beyond a certain level the Commonwealth comes in to top it up,</p>
<p> those arrangements have worked well. And over and above that, in appropriate</p>
<p> circumstances, the Commonwealth provides more money. Now, I am yet</p>
<p> to be convinced that the sort of fund being proposed by Mr Beattie</p>
<p> and Mr Carr, which would have to be additionally funded from somewhere,</p>
<p> I'm not convinced that that is going to be any better than the</p>
<p> arrangement we now have.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>Okay, just on to the announcements yesterday, which of course are</p>
<p> only consultation, it's only a consultative paper Â– there'll</p>
<p> be input from a lot of people before a final report on business tax</p>
<p> reform is issued in June. A capital gains tax Â– do you agree</p>
<p> that we should have a lower rate of tax or at least a tapering rate</p>
<p> of tax for capital gains so that if you've hung on to the asset</p>
<p> for a long time you'd actually pay a lower rate of capital gains</p>
<p> tax than the bloke speculating on 24 hour turnover of something?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Alan, it's an option. I don't want to say yes and no what</p>
<p> I support at the moment because we are in a consultative process.</p>
<p> And in fairness to my colleagues and in fairness to people involved</p>
<p> in that process I'd like to hear all the arguments before we</p>
<p> make a decision. What I can say about the capital gains tax is that</p>
<p> we want to make certain that the existing capital gains tax is not</p>
<p> acting as a disincentive to investment. We want to make certain that</p>
<p> the existing capital gains tax is not making us less competitive than</p>
<p> other countries, and particularly it's not hurting the accumulation</p>
<p> of capital for new ventures, for higher risk areas where frankly we</p>
<p> need people to take risks, to put a bit of money on the line in order</p>
<p> to achieve something. Now, that's the ruler than I'm going</p>
<p> to run over this and if the existing system is found wanting then</p>
<p> the existing system will be changed.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>Right. Well, just on that basis, you would be aware that the United</p>
<p> States have recently reduced their capital gains tax rates and countries</p>
<p> like Germany and Singapore and South Korea and Taiwan, with whom we</p>
<p> compete, have no capital gains tax. So we are at a competitive disadvantage.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, that is right. It is also true that the corporate tax rate in</p>
<p> some of those countries is higher than it is in Australia. And it's</p>
<p> also true that in some of those countries there are other taxes that</p>
<p> don't exist in Australia. So you have to look at the aggregate</p>
<p> taxation mix. But I do not want a capital gains tax regime that discourages</p>
<p> investment and I do not want a capital gains tax regime that discourages</p>
<p> risk taking. But exactly what changes we make is something that ought</p>
<p> to await a full examination, not only of John Ralph's excellent</p>
<p> paper but also the submissions that are made in response to it.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>Right. John Ralph had no sooner finished issuing breath yesterday</p>
<p> than Prime Minister Harradine got on to the front foot Â– you're</p>
<p> only the de facto Prime Minister - Prime Minister Harradine saying</p>
<p> that any changes to business tax reform will have to be approved by</p>
<p> him. I mean, how much longer to Australians have to cope with Brian</p>
<p> Harradine and Meg Lees on the television every night telling us that</p>
<p> this country must be run according to their dictates.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I think you can draw some distinction between Brian Harradine</p>
<p> and the Democrats. And I don't see Brian Harradine on the television</p>
<p> every night. And Brian Harradine has, over the last three years, taken</p>
<p> a more reasonable approach to many of the proposals we've put</p>
<p> up than has either the Australian Democrats or the Australian Labor</p>
<p> Party. Alan, I think the way the Senate collectively reacts to our</p>
<p> taxation package will be a very interesting moment for the Australian</p>
<p> people because if ever a government was upfront and honest and forthright</p>
<p> about a policy change it was us in the last election about taxation.</p>
<p> If ever a government deserves to implement something that it took</p>
<p> to the people, it's the government I now lead in relation to</p>
<p> taxation. And how the Senate behaves will, I believe, have quite a</p>
<p> significant impact on the longer term attitude of the Australian people.</p>
<p> There's a role of the Senate.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
<p>Those people are sick and tired, I can tell you, of Meg Lees and Brian</p>
<p> Harradine. If we can have a gun summit and an economic summit, can't</p>
<p> we have a national drug summit to put all the cards on the table,</p>
<p> cast away bias and prejudice and just see how on earth we can do better</p>
<p> than we're currently doing?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I don't rule anything out in this drug area and I made</p>
<p> plain yesterday that I'm not interested in political division.</p>
<p> I'm quite sure that there are many areas where Bob Carr, for</p>
<p> example, and I can could work together very constructively. I suspect</p>
<p> that on some of the issues our views are similar, perhaps they're</p>
<p> different on other issues, I don't rule that out. I'm always</p>
<p> careful in talking about summits because no matter what the issue</p>
<p> is or no matter how well prepared, some people do grandstand at summits.</p>
<p>JONES:</p>
