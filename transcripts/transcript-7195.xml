Ladies anC gentlemen<br />
Over the next two days you will be discusGing cattere that<br />
have a crucial bearing on the future of the four uillion<br />
Australinns who live outside the nation's big cities.<br />
Many conforences have been held over the years dealing with<br />
issues of inportance to coctions and groups among those four<br />
nillion people especially to those directly engaged in our<br />
great rural industries of agriculture and mining, forestry<br />
and fisiag.<br />
This symposium has a broader reach and a greater challenge:<br />
to consiCer in an integrated way the whole of rural<br />
Australia, all its industries, all its residents, all itf<br />
Government services, all its community groups.<br />
There used to be a notion that public sector policies in<br />
reaard to rural Australia, and private sector investments<br />
for that matter, should depend on a version of the " trickle<br />
dotn" thocry. This was the belief that what was good for<br />
primary Industry was good enough for rural Australia as a<br />
whole, because the benefits of a healthy primary industry<br />
Would trickle down to the provincial towns, and to the rural<br />
manufacturers and service industries.<br />
To question that notion is certainly not to question the<br />
continuing importance to the rural community indeed to the<br />
whole nation of agriculture and mining. They are the<br />
basis of the non-metropolitan economy and are the nation's<br />
biggest export earners.<br />
But to question the trickle down notion is to acknowledge<br />
that times are changing in rural Australia and they are<br />
changing rapidly. -00 0 4 </p>
<p>Th( pojyulatloja trift to the citicz apq-arrC to have beon<br />
roversed ash. 3c at tile Dante Zimo~ the nuaibor of irural poople<br />

Attitt~ deG of::-a Austzralia towa.; da the use o thoso<br />
services Chasiging.<br />
But the unas. tlchange one which i-as affected all<br />
justralians, : hoein tie bush and those in the cities waz<br />
the realisaticn that th'e AuStralitin econotay as a whole was<br />
in need of a-_ ss,-ive overhaul.<br />
That realicatici, was promptedi most directly by tho drama'tic<br />
collapse in orr termsz of trade in 1l) 85/ 86. Tho hardl truth<br />
waa that the warld wzes no longer wiillin~ g to pay the picices<br />
it once had p Id ios: our agricultural and maining cozi;, oditios<br />
pricer, which '~ ad Gustained the ration's living standnardo<br />
dur" 4ng the 1950c and l960s, and which had foctered th3<br />
imbalancad ocorjo: aic growth typified by that trickle down<br />
notion.<br />
This collapze ,' a2 e~ xacorbated by the economically inoano<br />
protectionist, u'cies of the Eu~ ropean Conmunity, the US and<br />
Japan which -have corrupted the trade in farm product6 and<br />
which have mado parts of rural Eustralia the innocent<br />
victin3 of a foreign trade war.<br />
Ya all, the tormG of trade collapse ctripped some $ 9 billion<br />
off our national. economsic capacity the equivalent of<br />
$ 2,000 for every Australian fam-1ly.<br />
No nation', no ccanolmy, could withstand that kind of<br />
buffeting wit. hout a significant short term drop in living<br />
standards or, juit as importantly, without a roalisation of<br />
the need for lvr. q term structural change.<br />
It has to be GtrsDssod that the tern~ s of trade collapse was<br />
not the fault off any Australian farmer or miner or<br />
manufacturer. Et was the result of our vulnerability to<br />
commodity price Iuctuations a vulnerability which had<br />
been built up over decades.<br />
Reducing that vulnerability is the great task in which the<br />
Australian nation is engaged at present.<br />
I ant not here coake a partisan speech but I do want to<br />
express my pride o Prime Ministor that my government has<br />
perceived and actod on this basic national need, and has<br />
taken the hard, and sometimes unpopular, decisions necessary<br />
to overcome th at_' need.<br />
We have floated the dollar, which has been of enormous<br />
benefit to all K'-ustralian industries, including rural<br />
industries. We have deregulated financial markets and<br />
reimoved unnecesGary regulation on other businesses. LjJd UL </p>
<p>We have broken down the barriers of protection which cramped<br />
our manufacturing industries. We are endeavouring to build<br />
a more diverce regime of exports to supplement our<br />
traditional reliance on what we have been able to shear, or<br />
grow, or dig up.<br />
We have steaCily reduced the growth in farm costs from<br />
11 per cent o year when we came to office to an expected<br />
4 per cent in the coming year.<br />
And as the Treasurer, Mr Keating announced over the weekend,<br />
the Budget dcficit has been reduced by $ 3010 million<br />
compared with 1985/ 86 $ 800 million mo-e than was expected.<br />
This will strengthen the downward movenent in interest rates<br />
a movement wlhich is already well underway, and a movreent<br />
which is of Leoefit to the entire rural community.<br />
In the keynote address to the World Economic Forum in Davos<br />
this year, I outlined a plan for a ceasefire in the trade<br />
war and for a gradual reduction in the gap between the<br />
artificially cnintained domestic prices for farm goods and<br />
the prices tho: would earn on the free market.<br />
The recent meeting of OECD Ministers endorsed the major<br />
elements of th proposal. The Cairns Group of fair trading<br />
nations, brought together by Australia, had a successful<br />
meeting in Canada and called on the Big Seven leadero to<br />
take action at their Summit in Venice. As further evidence<br />
that the . Cairin Group has becomae a vital third force in<br />
agricultural diplomacy, the declaration of that Venice<br />
Summit did in fact echo the long-term proposals sought by<br />
Australia. I was gratified to read in today's press the opinion of US<br />
trade representative, Mr Clayton Yeutter, that the Cairnc<br />
Group has a major and influential role to play in resolving<br />
the farm trade groblem.<br />
Australia can and indeed must become a competitive and<br />
vigorous exporter of manufactured goods and services; the<br />
efficiency and innovation which have typified our rural<br />
production must spread throughout the whole economy.<br />
The implications of this task of reconstruction are vitally<br />
linked to the themes you will address in this symposium.<br />
For reconstruction is not just a task for manufacturers in<br />
the big cities. It is a task which will change the nature<br />
of rural Australia too.<br />
Let me give you some examples.<br />
Australian primary industries have traditionally<br />
concentrated on bulk exports of unprocessed goods.<br />
It is imperative that we complement this with value added<br />
processing within Australia. 0odo / 0 </p>
<p>The plan the textiles, clothing and footwear industry<br />
includes aicouragement of downstream processing. The<br />
proportion of our wool exports that has been subject to the<br />
first stagen of processing has increased by over fifteen per<br />
cent since ue came to office. This is clearly an important<br />
direction for Austalian industry in the future.<br />
A second way in which reconstruction will change the nature<br />
of rural Auntralia is through the enormous increase in the<br />
number of foreign tourists visiting Australia. Since 1983,<br />
the number of international visitors arriving in Australia<br />
has risen from less than 1 million per year to the point<br />
where we cau confidently predict more than 2 aillion<br />
visitors Will arrive next year.<br />
The money those visitors spend here helps our balance of<br />
payments. And when they arrive they travel extensively<br />
outside the capital cities, creating further demand for<br />
recreation, accommodation, food and transport.<br />
This is what reconstruction is about bringing new<br />
industries and creating new jobs throughout the Australian<br />
community. A third important impact of reconstruction on rural<br />
Australia is through the creation of a more officient and<br />
technologically sophisticated nationwide infrastructure<br />
our communications and transport networks.<br />
Road funding has been increased by over 80% in the past four<br />
and half yearn, and three quarters of this has been spent in<br />
country'areas. This is a massive investment linking rural<br />
producero with cities and export markets.<br />
Australia's shipping industry is being revitalised and is<br />
becoming conpetitive with the fleets of our trading<br />
partners. On the waterfront, policies are in place to improve the<br />
reliability and efficiency of this vital link in our export<br />
chain.<br />
We remain conritted to the principle of cross subsidisation<br />
in charges foi telecommunications and postal services. The<br />
Telecom crocss-ubsidy was worth $ 460 million to<br />
non-metropolitan people in 1984/ 85.<br />
In broadcasting, services under the Second Regional Radio<br />
Network begin this year, with transmitters installed in<br />
Queensland, Western Australia and the Northern Territory.<br />
The passage of our media legislation means that people in<br />
regional and rural NSW, Queensland and Victoria can now look<br />
forward to receiving up to three commercial television<br />
services plus the ABC. The legislation also provides for<br />
fast-track introduction of at least one extra service in<br />
Tasmania, the Northern Territory and regional areas of South<br />
Australia and Western Australia. ( 00007 </p>
<p>in F'ebruairy the Ninister for Communications announced plans<br />
to introduc. new PH services in soma thirty regional areas<br />
over the inA three years.<br />
Side by , iic with the~ imlpact o. l reconstruction, rural<br />
Australia in also bencfitting from a more coordinated<br />
approach tj tie 6eliJery of governent services.<br />
Country svare entitled to the same quality of service<br />
frofa rjovcern..-nt anid thu. saiac. access to governmont ceirviceu<br />
ac anyoan Dlao. L'hi$ 3 symposiu is a Part of that<br />
coordinitiA approach.<br />
one of our Lujor reforms haG been financing local government<br />
on a more eq~ itable basis. We have given all Australians,<br />
through thoilr local Councilo, much greater say over how<br />
their tantes are spent which ic of special importance to<br />
country poo~ e, in particular, as they face widely varying<br />
and often uaicque local or regional problems.<br />
The particular needs of rural women will be addreosed in th&amp;<br />
follow-up to th, consultations on the National Agonda for<br />
Women. This follow-up will be better targeted as a result<br />
of the GUrVej undertaken by the Country Women's Association<br />
in conjunction with the Office of Status of Women.<br />
Let we take this opportunity to thank Dorothy Ross of the<br />
Country WcocxiIG Association and, indeed, all the women who<br />
particanoi in tha survey, for the insights and suggestions<br />
they gave u3; zbout how government services can be better<br />
delivercd the country.<br />
we have aluG, directed the Public Service to pay much greater<br />
attention tc: the delivery of programs and services in rural<br />
areas and provincial centres. The practices and procedures<br />
which operixte in cities are in nany cases simply not<br />
appropriatc, to the country.<br />
As a resul. t of the establishment of the Rural and Provincial<br />
Affairs Unit in the Department of Primary industry,<br />
administrators and decision-makers throughout the Public<br />
Service havy constantly before them a reminder of the<br />
special n~ cus and requirements of rural Australians.<br />
The Unit *., for example, co-operating with other portfolios<br />
in their ruview of rural housing needs and policy, in<br />
examining tVe adequacy of post-secondary rural education, in<br />
examining tIs delivury of comimunity services in remote<br />
areas, and in the trial of a completely new co-ordinated<br />
basis for dulivery of information on government services in<br />
rural Austr : lia.<br />
When I launched my Party's rural affairs policy in Bundaberg<br />
eleven daYG ago, I announced another aspect of this change.<br />
My Governpcnt is committed to establishing a Commonwealth<br />
Services Iniormation Systen a national network designed<br />
especially to provide country people with information about<br />
Government zGervices of which they could avail themselves. k) 0 0 07. 8 </p>
<p>6.<br />
The Rural and Provincial Affairs Unit has also produced a<br />
comprehensive guide to major Federal programs and services<br />
relevant to rural Australians. It is a tangible sign of our<br />
determination to take the broad view of rural Australia.<br />
Called sizply ' The Rural Book', this publication will help<br />
people find out which level of Government is best able to<br />
meet their needs. It is my very considerable pleasure to<br />
launch thic guide this evening.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen,<br />
Rural Australia is a distinctive and important element of<br />
our naticoa<br />
I trust th Rural Australia Synposium will help Government<br />
develop and widen its sense of the needs and aspirations of<br />
rural Australians. You will not produce a blueprint for<br />
rural policy but I am certain you will amass a great deal<br />
of the information needed 2or such a blueprint.<br />
The answoru may take time to implement but with this<br />
Symposium the action has begun. OU00? D<br />
