PRIME MINISTER1<br />
8TAT~ ITBY TE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P. J. XEATING. MP<br />
NEWSOIPS SHAMEFUL SPEH<br />
Dr Howson's address last night brought no credit to him<br />
personally, or to his party. It was a shameful speech<br />
confirming once again that the leader of the Liberal<br />
Party believes Australians share his Incapacity to make<br />
reasoned and principled judgements on major Issues.<br />
Last night Dr Hewson sought to Incite anxiety where there<br />
need be none, and attempted to play on fear and prejudice<br />
for which the majority of Australians have no use and<br />
which they have rejected throughout the Mabo debate.<br />
He portrayed the Mabo challenge as something beyond the<br />
reach of Australians' intelligence and goodwill.<br />
Most disturbingly, he cynically traded in distortions,<br />
misconceptions, untruths and downright lies.<br />
Dr Howson says Australians should worry about their<br />
homes and farms when he knows the Government<br />
legislation provides security.<br />
He says Australia's challenge is to respond to the<br />
High Court yet he seeks to deny the Court's<br />
.0udgement. He says we can't undo the past yet nobody is<br />
suggesting that we try to. What we seek Is an<br />
acknowledgement of * past injustice, but most<br />
Importantly, a future built on justice.<br />
He says we must recognise the ' possibility* of<br />
Native Title yet he supports Premier Court's<br />
legislation which will wipe out the possessory<br />
rights of Aboriginal people.<br />
He says we should respect our Constitution what he<br />
really means is he will stand by and let a state<br />
abolish Native Title.<br />
He speaks of his visits to Aboriginal communities<br />
but didn't have the courage to tell them he would<br />
sell them out in the Parliamient.<br />

He cries crocodile tears about living conditions in<br />
some Aboriginal communities then questions the<br />
money spent to help improve them.<br />
He says Mabo won't do anything about Aboriginal<br />
education, health and welf are but Mabo is about<br />
JAdA and the High Court decision, which Dr Howson<br />
says our legislation goes beyond, Is about land.<br />
He argues that States should have control of land<br />
management when he knows the Government's<br />
legislation specifically provides for States to<br />
retain powers over the economic use of land.<br />
He criticises the Governimt. s decision to provide<br />
compensation for potential Mabo claim. on titles<br />
Issued between 1975-93 does he want private<br />
landholders to toot the bill?<br />
He says land will be locked up from economic<br />
development when he knows that nothing will be<br />
locked up. The Bill provides for Ministerial<br />
overrides to permit economic development to proceed<br />
In the national and State Interest.<br />
He says valid leases of pastoral land &amp; ade prior to<br />
1975 may be subject to claims for Native Title<br />
when he knows this is a downright lie. The gill<br />
specifically protects valid leases.<br />
He says providing more land for Aborigines Is Omore<br />
important' but criticises the Governmnt's<br />
Intention to establish a land acquisition fund. If<br />
more land 15 to be provided, how will It be done<br />
without money?<br />
He says the Commonwealth and States must work<br />
together seven of the eight States and Territories<br />
are working together with the Commonwealth.<br />
He says the rights of Aboriginal and Torres Strait<br />
Islander people must be respected all rights, It<br />
soe, except their right to land.<br />
He decries the " handing over* of land he means<br />
that land rightfully belonging to Aboriginal people<br />
should be denied them.<br />
