    <content><![CDATA[<p>PRIME MINISTER'S WEEKLY BROADCAST<br />THE THREAT TO LEGAL AID<br />SUNDAY</p>
<p>12 October 1975</p>
<p>You may have missed the news this week -all too often these things get scant atte-ntion in the pressthat<br />the Opposition has decided to delay the passage<br />of the Legal Aid Bill through the Parliament. They<br />are adopting the old obstructive technique of referring<br />the bill to a Senate committee. What they are really<br />trying to do is block the legal aid scheme by a<br />backdoor method. They know the scheme is popular; they<br />know the great public demand for it. But they haven't<br />the courage to vote against it on the floor of the Senate.<br />I'll return to the legal aid scheme in a<br />moment, but first, it's worth looking more closely at<br />this Opposition tactic of referring bills to Senate<br />committees. They do it all the time. it's a familiar<br />and characteristic method of Liberal obstruction.<br />They will neither vote for a bill nor vote against it.<br />For example, our bill for a national compensation<br />scheme was held up for eight months while a Senate<br />committee made a report. An even worse example concerned<br />legislation to clamp do 4n on lurks and fiddles in<br />the share mparket and securities business. The origins<br />of this go back f~ ve years to 1970 when the Senate<br />set up an inquiry into share trading swindles during<br />the mining boom. When their repor t finally appeared<br />we promptly drafted legislation to deal with the problem.<br />The Opposition majority in the Senate referred the bill<br />to yet another Senate committee for a report. That<br />was last April. Since then we've seen the crash of one<br />share broking firm, Patrick Partners. now much more<br />0 evidence is needed of in~ tability in the-' stockbroker..<br />business how.* many more shareholders must burn their<br />fingers -before our legislation goes through?<br />In view of all this I suppose we shouldn't<br />be too surprised by the opposition's attitude to the Legal<br />Aid Bill. After all, Mr Fraser himself promised in his<br />Budget speech that if the Liberals got back into office<br />they would abandon legal aid entirely. They would abolish<br />it. Why the Opposition should want a Senate inquiry<br />into something they want to abolish is difficult to<br />understand. The fact is that despite Mr Fraser, quite a<br />number of Liberal senators have expressed support for the<br />Legal Aid Office and several Liberal members have actually<br />asked for legal aid offices to be established in their own<br />electorates. For my part, I regard legal aid as one ' of<br />the most important achievements of the Labor Government.<br />It was set up to give general advice and assistance to<br />anyone who needs it, to anyone with a legal problem who<br />may lack the means to go to a lawyer. We've been setting<br />UP these offices in cities, suburbs and towns all over</p>
<p>2.<br />Australia. They operate in conjunction with local<br />comnunitv and welfare organisations. The atmosphere<br />is friendly and relaxed and discussions are absolutely<br />confidential. Just how badly the service was needed can<br />be seen from the public's response during the past<br />two years. It has been quite phenomenal. It's true<br />that many of those who use the service are people<br />susoicious or a i4ttle fearful of the law, poor<br />people, inarticulate or poorly educated peoole, and<br />migrants with lancuage difficulties. Many offices<br />have lawyers who speak the language of a local<br />ethnic group. But generally speaking, clients<br />represent a very wide cross-section of the people.<br />All told, the Legal Aid Office has provided assistance<br />to 130,000 Australians. That's a figure to remember<br />when Mr Fraser talks of abolishing the scheme:<br />130,000 Australians have been helped in the past two<br />vears, and the office is still not fully established.<br />Not long ago there was a national opinion poll on<br />= eonle's attitudes to the Legal Aid Office. Ninety-four<br />= ercent of those questioned saw a need for a legal<br />aid service, and 75 percent ( including 71 percnet of<br />Liberal-Country Party voters) could see nothing wrong<br />with the present scheme. If ever th e was a. service<br />demanded and needed by the Australia eople,; is the<br />Australian Legal Aid Office. I<br />I want to make it clear that despite the<br />obstruction of the Opposition the legal aid service<br />will continue. We introduced legislation this year<br />to establish the office as an independent statutory<br />authority. It is this legislation which the Opposition<br />is now blocking, but their obstruction will not prevent<br />the service from operating in its present form as a<br />branch of the Attorney-General's Department. We prefer<br />t the idea of a statutory authority because we believe<br />the office should be independent and seen to be<br />independent of the Government. Don't get the idea<br />that we're taking over all the work of lawyers and<br />limiting their opportunities. With a very few exceptions<br />we've had the warm support of the legal profession in<br />setting up this scheme. In many cases we have found<br />that legal aid services are best provided by utilizing<br />the talents of the private legal profession.<br />During the past two years my Government has shown<br />its determination to reform and modernise the law on a<br />whole range of issues. I've mentioned the Corporations<br />and Securities Bill. Last year we brought in our<br />historic Trade Practices legislation, which is already<br />protecting consumers and making business more competitive.<br />And again, as you know, Parliament has passed the Family<br />Law Bill, which establishes a single new ground for<br />divorce and sets up a Family Court of Australia to handle<br />all matrimonial matters. Those are just three of the things<br />we have done in the field of law reform.</p>
<p>3.<br />it's not much use reforming -he law if<br />d... ry people have no opportunity to resort to the<br />law and take action through the courts where necessary.<br />Perfect law and well-organised courts are of little<br />use if the -Decple who most need the protection of the<br />law cannot afford access to the courts. We've always<br />t aken the view that citizens in a free society have an<br />absolute right to equality before the law. For too<br />long many Australians have been denied access to our<br />system of justice because they could not afford the<br />se. rVices of lawyers or were not aware of their rights<br />u-der the law. The Legal Aid Office puts and end to this<br />injustice. Just as Medibank ensures that the services<br />of the medical profession are available to all who<br />need them. he Legal Aid Office ensures that legal services<br />are available to all who need them. Just as the<br />Liberals have threatened to demolish Medibank, they now<br />promise to demolish legal aid. Their behaviour in the<br />Senate makes it quite plain that they object to legal<br />aid in principle. None of us knows when we may some<br />z-Le need legal aid. The Liberals have shown their<br />contempt for the thousands upon thousands of Australians<br />who have sought the help of the Legal Aid Office and<br />for all of us who may some time stand in need of legal<br />assistance or advice. ti</p>
