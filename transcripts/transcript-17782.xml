Prime Minister Julia Gillard today launched the documentary Kapyong: the forgotten battle of the forgotten war to mark the 60th anniversary of the Battle of Kapyong.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister said the documentary was a fitting tribute to the Australian soldiers, sailors and airmen who fought alongside our allies in this defining battle of the Korean War.</p>
<p>On 23-24 April 1951, the Battle of Kapyong was fought by Australians of the 3rd Battalion, The Royal Australian Regiment (3 RAR), who helped to stop the Chinese spring offensive. This was crucial in preventing a Chinese breakthrough towards Seoul.</p>
<p>Kapyong: the forgotten battle of the forgotten wartells the stories of the Allied and Chinese soldiers during the Battle  -  it talks of their endurance and extreme bravery but also of the respect that they had for their opposing forces.</p>
<p>The Gillard Government will also develop a new interactive website on Australia's involvement in the Korean War to commemorate the 60th anniversary.</p>
<p>The website will include researched historical text, images, maps, topographical information, interviews with veterans, innovative animated battle maps, and education resources for teachers and students. There are also plans to translate the website into Korean.</p>
<p>Minister for Veterans' Affairs Warren Snowdon said the documentary and the website would provide Australians with a valuable source of historical information on Australia's involvement in the Korean War.</p>
<p>Mr Snowdon congratulated the producer of the documentary, John Lewis and writer/director Dennis Smith. Their work has been a fitting tribute to the Australians who served in the Battle of Kapyong during the Korean War.</p>
<p>In total more than 17,000 Australians served in the Korean War from 1950 to 1953, with 340 Australians killed in action, including 43 who are still missing in action. A further 1,216 were wounded and 30 were held captive in Prisoner of War camps. </p>
<p>Thirty-two Australians died in the Battle of Kapyong, 59 were wounded and three were missing (taken prisoner). For its part in the battle, 3 RAR was awarded the United States Presidential Unit Citation.</p>
<p>Kapyong: the forgotten battle of the forgotten war was funded by the Department of Veterans' Affairs, Foxtel, Film Victoria and Screen Australia and will be broadcasted by Foxtel on The History Channel on at 8:00 pm on Sunday, 24 April 2011.</p>
