Senator the Honourable Stephen Conroy, Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy</p>
<p>Professor Glyn Davis, Vice-Chancellor and Principal, The University of Melbourne</p>
<p>Professor Rod Tucker, Director, Institute for a Broadband-Enabled Society and your Institute colleagues.</p>
<p>We are living in a time of sustained global transformation where the nations that survive and prosper are those that modernise their economies.</p>
<p>We face an ageing population, increasing globalisation and the currency impacts of our mineral exports.</p>
<p>We can only meet those challenges if we increase our productivity.</p>
<p>And that means envisaging a whole new economy.</p>
<p>A high tech, high skill, clean energy economy anchored in innovation and creativity.</p>
<p>Boosting Australia's productivity doesn't mean cutting wages and conditions, as if shaving a dollar or two off the hourly rates of shop assistants will make a bit of difference.</p>
<p>It isn't about snatching a few lazy moves out of the Thatcher-Friedman play book.</p>
<p>The big movers of productivity are the capacity investments like quality infrastructure, a skilled and flexible workforce and the ability to innovate and capture new opportunities.</p>
<p>Few investments will bring us a greater return than broadband.</p>
<p>The United Nations has stated that “broadband is the next tipping point, the next truly transformational technology.”</p>
<p>That's why this Government has put the National Broadband Network and our Digital Economy strategy at the heart of our policy program.</p>
<p>The NBN will make Australia the most connected continent on the planet.</p>
<p>Broadband is an economic game-changer.</p>
<p>Allowing us to do old things better, and to do new things not even yet imagined.</p>
<p>A Deloitte-Access Economics Report released in August estimates that the Internet contributes around $50 billion a year or 3.6 per cent of Australia's GDP.</p>
<p>That's the same size as our agriculture industry.</p>
<p>And it's set to grow by around 7 per cent a year by 2016.</p>
<p>Further, research being released yesterday in Europe by Ericsson and Arthur D. Little finds that every doubling of broadband speed increases GDP by 0.3%</p>
<p>To put this into perspective; the basic service offered under the NBN has a speed of 12 mega bits per second - significantly faster than the 1 to 5 mbps speeds most Australians experience today.  </p>
<p>And think about this:</p>
<p>The single biggest driver of business productivity isn't cutting wages or working longer hours.</p>
<p>It's information technology.</p>
<p>Working smarter.</p>
<p>Information Technology drives 78% of productivity gains in service businesses and 85% in manufacturing businesses.</p>
<p>As exposure to the global market grows, only businesses that innovate and build new capacity can prosper and survive.</p>
<p>We know that embracing new technologies is one of the best ways to achieve that.</p>
<p>Clearly more businesses are making the attempt; clearly many need more help to login.</p>
<p>The most recent ABS survey of business IT use reveals that just 40 per cent of Australian businesses had some sort of web presence in 2009-10.</p>
<p>And among our smallest businesses, the figure was just 29 per cent.</p>
<p>These businesses should not be left behind.</p>
<p>If a search engine can't find you  -  then it is most likely that your customers can't either.</p>
<p>And yet, here we are in the second decade of the 21stcentury, and more than half of all Australians businesses aren't on the Web.</p>
<p>A recent global study by McKinsey found that SMEs with a strong web presence grew more than twice as quickly as those that didn't.</p>
<p>They also had twice the export revenue and twice the jobs growth.</p>
<p>For businesses, the online environment renders distance irrelevant and opens up once unimaginable national and international markets.</p>
<p>Like digital supply-chain systems that allow bottlenecks to be identified in real time and shortfalls in stock to be met.</p>
<p>These are the very real benefits available to business today.</p>
<p>But think of the next wave of innovation that will develop as the NBN brings high speed broadband to all Australian homes and businesses.</p>
<p>The NBN will provide the basis for new methods, processes and products to drive efficiency and productivity growth.</p>
<p>To create and commercialise a whole range of new products and processes that enhance the way companies go about their business.</p>
<p>We know that not all businesses have the skills and confidence to participate.</p>
<p>That is why the Government has committed funding to the Digital Enterprise program, and its predecessor - the Small Business Online program  -  which Senator Conroy will speak more about shortly.</p>
<p>But there are many businesses who are ready to take the next step and see their ideas become reality.</p>
<p>This is why I am delighted to be here today for the launch of the Australian Broadband Application Laboratory.</p>
<p>This laboratory - ABAL - will enable the application and development of new broadband ideas and service offerings.</p>
<p>It will provide the right environment to help companies  turn their ideas into new products and services.</p>
<p>And I congratulate the Victorian Government for its funding and support not only of this laboratory but also their ongoing support for the Institute for a Broadband Society. </p>
<p>Friends, we know Australians have great skills.</p>
<p>We are smart, innovative, adaptive people.</p>
<p>But our people and our firms need the framework and the opportunity to prosper.</p>
<p>We celebrate stories like Bill Gates the university drop-out who'd started mucking around with computers as a 13-year-old kid.</p>
<p>Or Steve Jobs, building the first Apple computers in his parents' garage.</p>
<p>I sincerely believe that there are people like Steve Jobs and Bill Gates in this country.</p>
<p>In our schools and universities and businesses.</p>
<p>But they need the hardware and the innovative climate to succeed.</p>
<p>People like Lars and Jens Rasmussen who invented Google Maps in their Sydney garage.</p>
<p>They are the sort of people who are writing Australia's economic future.</p>
<p>Just like ABAL will.</p>
<p>Productivity begins here.</p>
<p>In our labs.</p>
<p>In our classrooms.</p>
<p>In our small businesses</p>
<p>In our minds and our creative instincts.</p>
<p>We need a new economy.</p>
<p>It is Australia's non-negotiable passport to the future.</p>
<p>To be up there with the best.</p>
<p>Not stuck behind with the rust bucket, smoke stack economies of the past.</p>
<p>It will be an amazing journey.</p>
<p>The Australian Broadband Application Laboratory will help take us there.</p>
<p>And I very proudly declare it launched. </p>
