PRIME MINISTER 68/ 93<br />
SATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
RELEASE OF COMMONWEALTH PRINCIPLES AND DISCUSSION PAPER<br />
ON THE MABO DECISION<br />
The Commonwealth has today issued a discussion paper on the Mabo decision. It has<br />
been prepared by Commonwealth officials at the request of Ministers following<br />
extensive consultations with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander representatives,<br />
State and Territory governments and industry groups.<br />
The paper sets out the legal and other issues which need to be addressed in the wake of<br />
the High~ Court decision and identifies possible responses to the challenges posed by it.<br />
The discussion paper provides an analysis of the issues intended to inform and focus<br />
discussion. It is not a statement of Government policy, nor is it legal advice.<br />
Included as an Annex to the discussion paper is a framework of suggested key<br />
principles, which has been endorsed by Ministers, to guide the development of a<br />
response to the implications and uncertainties arising from the decision. It is not our<br />
intention that the principles should be seen as an ultimatum or that they should be<br />
regarded as set in concrete. We hope they will be a means of lifting public debate to a<br />
new and more focussed level.<br />
The High Court has made a landmark decision, and all governments need to come to<br />
terms with its consequences. We should view the Mabo decision as a national issue<br />
requiring a national response and as an opportunity rather than a problem. There are<br />
differing positions, often strongly held, on the questions raised by the High Court<br />
decision. This imposes a particular obligation on all Governments to keep open the<br />
channels of consultation, to examine proposals on their merits, and to develop a<br />
sensible and sensitive package.<br />
The release today of the discussion paper and the principles will, I hope, encourage an<br />
informed debate and assist Governments in the development of a response to the High<br />
Court decision which is workable and just.<br />
