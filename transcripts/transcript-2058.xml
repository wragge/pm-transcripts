VICTORIAN JEWISH BOARD OF DEPUTIES DINNER<br />
MELBOURNE, VIC. 26 MAY 1969<br />
Speech by the Prime Minister, Mr. John Gorton<br />
Mr. President, Mr. Ashkanasy and all those here assembled:<br />
You do my wife and I a very great honour tonight and we<br />
are touched by what has been said and by the welcome you have given<br />
us. We find it quite heartwarming and we thank you for it.<br />
You, Sir, mentioned the espousal or somebody<br />
mentioned the espousal of Jewish causes. I do not think that what<br />
motivates me or what motivates most Australians is a desire to espouse<br />
Jewish causes as such. I think that it is a belief that at this present<br />
time in history Jewish causes and the causes of Israel are right causes<br />
and are just causes and are honest causes, and are espoused by us for<br />
that reason rather than that they are the causes of some particular<br />
group. And you, Mr. Ashkanasy mentioned what are almost<br />
' half-forgotten things and battles long ago' the years of 1937, 1938 and<br />
1939 when, to our great advantage, we opened the gates of this country<br />
to those who were threatened in Europe. Sir, I can only assure you of<br />
this: that there are countries today who oppress citizens of the Jewish<br />
race living within them. There are countries today which conduct public<br />
executions, and we have taken such measures as we can to ensure that<br />
if those countries will open their gates to allow those who wish to<br />
emigrate from them, then we will again open our own gates to allow<br />
those immigrants to come in. And to this end we have already appointed<br />
Immigration Officers. We have already called upon Great Britain to<br />
act for us so that should these gates be opened for egress then we will<br />
be able quickly to make provision for ingress to ourselves to our<br />
great ultimate advantage, as I think has been demonstrated since 1938<br />
by those who came from abroad to be Australians and have so contributed<br />
to the Australian culture and the Australian way of life.<br />
I am privileged to be with you here tonight and the guest<br />
of such a representative body as the Victorian Jewish Board of Deputies,<br />
and particularly perhaps privileged because all of us here in this room<br />
have a special interest in two very vigorous, very sovereign, very<br />
independent countries Israel and Australia. There is a bond between<br />
us which does stretch back over the decades, which does stretch back<br />
to battles shared. But It has been strengthened, I think, by increasingly<br />
close relationship in recent days. / 2<br />

It is my hope tonight that this year Israel's 21st<br />
Ianniversary as a nation may, God willing, see a permanent settlement,<br />
a real peace in the Middle East and in the Holy Land. It is magnificent<br />
to win a Six-Day War, but it is not the solution to the problems which<br />
face Israel, because that Six-Day War was won and yet those problems<br />
still press in upon her borders.<br />
What surely must be required, what surely must be<br />
sought by the great powers of the world is that Israel and the other<br />
countries of the Middle East should sit down together, should discuss<br />
how they can live together, should and I think in the words of your<br />
own President draw lines on a map so that the Arabs say " This is the<br />
border" and the Israelis say " This is the border", and then there is an<br />
argument and a discussion about it. As long as it can finally lead to an<br />
0 agreed border and to a real enduring peace so that the people of Israel<br />
do not have continually to live with a plough in one hand and a rifle within<br />
their grasp, so that the country of Israel can contribute the savings it<br />
W can make to the development of the desert and to the increasing of its<br />
industrial capacity instead of having to divert so much to the very very<br />
necessary present requirements of armaments and defence.<br />
It is almost beyond my understanding that in a region where<br />
so much can be contributed by the example of Israel and the technology<br />
of Israel and the development of the desert which Israel has shown is<br />
possible that this should not be availed of by its neighbours; and where<br />
its neighbours equally with Israel contribute so much of their effort to<br />
tanks and guns and aeroplanes and shells instead of to education and<br />
advancement of their own people.<br />
I can only express the deepest hope that for the benefit<br />
of all those in the Middle East, there will be this year or soon an end<br />
to this strife, a beginning of a living in brotherhood, a beginning of a<br />
joint attempt to develop that area for the good of all. And this must<br />
come about by peace talks, by peace conferences, and small though we<br />
are in the councils of the world, our voice will always be raised to seek<br />
that end. I speak to you tonight, too, as fellow Australians because<br />
I believe that all those here in this room are concerned in this country<br />
with providing a better life for those who are born here and for those<br />
who, for one reason or another, have come here or may in the future<br />
come. In our beginnings, our pioneers had to tame a harsh country, a<br />
dry country, an unfriendly country. And is it not true that this has been<br />
and is still true of Israel that the desert had to be watered, that the new<br />
towns and cities and kibbutzes had to be built where previously there<br />
was nothing but desolation? We can claim, I think, as Australians, some<br />
success in battling with a harsh environment. So, too, can Israel, and<br />
here again is a bond between our countries. o / 3 </p>
<p>3-<br />
But there are differences. Here we sleep easily at night,<br />
as you, Sir, have said, and here we go about our work without threat,<br />
without danger, without the risk of grenades being thrown into our<br />
market-places, without the chances of buses carrying schoolchildren<br />
being blown up by landmines, without the possibility of plastic<br />
explosives being placed where. they will damage innocent civilians. In<br />
Israel that is not the case. And all along the frontiers, until that peace<br />
of which I have spoken and for which I will work and for which we must<br />
all hope will come, that will be the great division between Australia<br />
and Israel that here there is an opportunity to live without fear while<br />
in Israel there Is not.<br />
I hope that we can help to abolish this fear. Insofar as<br />
we can, we will. But in the meantime we can, and I believe we sho4ld,<br />
express our admiration and respect for the fortitude that the people of<br />
Israel are showing at the moment.<br />
I like the symbols of the friendships between our countries.<br />
We both, as I have said before, have stars on our flags. We both have<br />
some affinity towards the eucalypt and the gum trees. I have some<br />
affinity for it because you gave me a grove, although I am not quite<br />
sure that it really belongs to me, but nevertheless you gave it to me.<br />
Somebody I think my wife told me that you are now exporting back<br />
to Australia gum tree seed, which I think is going just a little too far:<br />
And you have there, in Israel, these finite examples of the ties between<br />
us in Nachiat Victoria which has been established in the desert with<br />
funds subscribed no doubt by many in this room and by many whom<br />
you represent outside this room. All these things remind us of the links<br />
we have with Israel. You, Sir, in your opening remarks, were kind enough<br />
to say something about what my Government is trying to do. What we<br />
are trying to do here can come under three broad heads. We are trying<br />
to ensure our security against attack from abroad in the future, and who<br />
could understand that better than people close to Israel. We are trying<br />
to push forward our development and strength, and who would know about<br />
that better than the people of Israel. And we are trying to see that with<br />
the material advancement this will bring, we also have the spiritual<br />
belief in a requirement for the welfare of the ill, the unfortunate, the<br />
maimed, the handicapped amongst us. And isn't it true that Israel<br />
opened her borders to all, however unfortunate, from whatever part of<br />
the world they came, in order to provide what is the ultimate objective<br />
of welfare, a better life and a happier life.<br />
These three things again are things which motivate this<br />
country and Israel, and these three things are of the essence of safety<br />
and of progress. / 4 </p>

I would like to take this chance to acknowledge what the<br />
community of the Jewish race and the Jewish faith have done in Australia<br />
over the years. It is, of course, to the lasting credit of the Jewish'<br />
people that they have maintained their spiritual values, that they have<br />
maintained their religion, that they have maintained their standards of<br />
conduct against the world ever since they were by the Romans thrown<br />
out of what was the first State of Israel. This has been true no matter<br />
where they have been born or no matter where they have lived. And<br />
they have done this in Australia too, although most were born here and<br />
although their integration into the Australian community has been, as<br />
I believe, total. What have they given us? They have given us great riches,<br />
I think, as have other races who have come here. They have given us<br />
great advantages in developing our own culture and in bringing in and<br />
infusing and diffusing amongst us their rich culture which many Australians<br />
now think is their own and which in fact has become their own. I know,<br />
Sir, that this will go on.<br />
You have all won an honoured and respected place in<br />
Australian life, and I am proud that even though sometimes it gets a<br />
little lonely, I am Prime Minister of a country where bigotry is at a<br />
discount, and where Australians accept each other for what they are.<br />
And I believe that you will all agree with me that we in this room as<br />
Australians are not troubled by what each man's faith might be or what<br />
form the worship of his God might take. We are interested only in<br />
" Is this man a good man or a bad man? Does he contribute to the<br />
community? Or does he uot?" This is the way it should be. This is the<br />
way it is and this, please God, will be the way it always will be in<br />
Australia in the future.<br />
I thank you, Mr. Chairman, and all those in this room<br />
for the evening that you have tendered to my wife and 1. It is a night<br />
that we will always remember, and the things of which we speak and<br />
the things for which we stand are eternal things and they will overcome. </p>
