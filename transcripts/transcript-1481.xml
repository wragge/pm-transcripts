. NEW ZEALAND -TOUR 1967<br />
DEPARTURE OF THE PRIME MINISTER, MR. HAROLD HOLT<br />
FROM RAAF BASE, FAIRBAIRN, CANBERRA, A. C. T.<br />
2ND FEBRUARY, 1967<br />
Before departing on his tour of New Zealand, the Prime Minister made the<br />
following comments to the press in response to questions<br />
What is the purpose of your visit, Sir?<br />
PM: Principally to get to know the New Zealand people better, to<br />
let them see the Australian Prime Minister, have talks with my friend,<br />
Mr. Holyoake, the New Zealand Prime Minister, meet Members of his<br />
Cabinet, discuss matters we have in common interest, and inform myself<br />
on some of their problems and get a better visual view of what New Zealand<br />
is looking like after an absence of olaeen years.<br />
Q. Would your trip, Sir, have any possible relation to the fact that Britain<br />
might enter the ' European Common Market?<br />
PM: My purpose is not to negotiate on any particular matter. I<br />
will be free to discuss with Mr. Holyoake and his Cabinet any particular<br />
matter they care to raise with me. But it is primarily a goodwill visit,<br />
an attempt to make more frequent contact with our good friends and<br />
allies of New Zealand. After all, we have been very close together in<br />
many matters in the past. We have fought together in wars. We are<br />
linked together now in Viet Nam<br />
Q. Will Viet Nam figure largely in your talks?<br />
PM: Well I am not raising any particular matter, as I said. I will<br />
hold myself available for discussion on whatever topics the New Zealand<br />
Government cares to raise with me. I am not discussing trade matters in<br />
any depth or detail. As you know, Mr. McEwen will be going to New<br />
Zealand quite shortly under the arrangement we have for annual<br />
discussions on the New Zealand / Aus trali a Trade Agreement.<br />
Q. Mr. Holt, New Zealand is quite famous for its big fish. WIill<br />
you be doing any skin-diving over there?<br />
PM: I don't expect so. The water is probably a good deal colder<br />
than that around Portsea and that is cold enough at times.<br />
Q. You are not nervous about Dinah, are you Mr. Prime Minister?<br />
PM: Well I have never been nervous about any member of the.<br />
feminine sex. 1 hope that Dinah will treat me kindly.<br />
Q. Your swimming experience may be useful today, Sir.'.<br />
PM: I would not like to contemplate that prospect, Harold. That is<br />
not a very cheerful thought to put into my mind as we take off<br />
1, of course, have had in the last twelve months several opportunities<br />
for discussion with Mr. Holyoake. We have got to know each other very / 2 </p>
<p>2-<br />
PM ( Contd.) well and we are on very good and friendly terms with each other.<br />
But as I said at the outset, this is primarily to enable Mrs. Holt and<br />
myself to get to-know the New Zealand people better and to get to<br />
know through us, Australia better.<br />
Q. It is quite an historic trip, Sir. According to reports, you are<br />
the first Prime Minister to visit New Zealand, is this true?<br />
PM: No. Andrew Fisher visited New Zealand in 1914 and conducted<br />
some negotiations on mutual social security affairs, I understand.<br />
And Sir Robert was there in 1954 on a short visit. B ut still it is a<br />
long gap. We ought to be seeing each other more often. However, it<br />
must be borne in mind that the Prime Ministers of the two countries<br />
usually meet at the Prime Ministers' Conferences and other matters<br />
of that sort, so they have not been out of touch.<br />
Q. Will you be meeting any of the people, Sir?<br />
PM: Certainly, there will be various occasions on which this will be<br />
possible. But New Zealand people, after all, are very like Australians.<br />
Thank you. </p>
