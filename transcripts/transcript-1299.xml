FOR PRESS: P. M. No. 39/ 1966<br />
PRI1' E MINISTER'S TOUR OF SOUTH-EAST ASIA 661/ 063<br />
Statement Released by the Prime T. Minister,<br />
M1r. Harold Holt on his arrival in Bangkok, Thailand.<br />
26th APRIL, 1966<br />
This morning I was with Australian servicemen<br />
commemorating Anzac Day at their operational base in Vietnam.<br />
Less than two hours later, this afternoon, I was<br />
with the Australian Air Force Squadron at Ubon.<br />
The fact that I w-s able to visit Australian Forces<br />
in Vietnam and Thailand in this short space of time is a<br />
forcible reminder of the proximity of events in South-East Asia<br />
and consequently of the vital importance of the efforts which<br />
have been made, both bilaterally and jointly, within the SEATO<br />
framework for building-up defence preparedness.<br />
Australia is duterminca to bc a good ally and its<br />
Government is fully alive to its responsibilities.<br />
These include Australia having a military capacity<br />
enabling timely and effective contributions to collective regiona4<br />
security. Australia is at present meeting connitments in<br />
Vietnam and Malaysia. Relations between Australia and Thailand have<br />
quickened and expanded remarkably in recent years.<br />
It w. s a great honour for Australia to receive a<br />
State visit from Their Majesties the King and Queen in 1962.<br />
I look forwaru to the audience which His Majesty<br />
is graciously giving mc on the present trip.<br />
I also look forward to meeting again your Prime<br />
Minister and the M7iinisters of his Government who earlier this<br />
year paid an official visit to Australia.<br />
In the discussions between the two Governments in<br />
Canberra we found an identity of views on Vietnam, both<br />
Governments recognising the essential nature of the conflict<br />
as Communist agression through infiltration, terror, subversion<br />
and direct military attack.<br />
My visit to Bangkok will enable us to carry this<br />
discussion forward, in the intimate manner of close allies.<br />
I shall have the benefit of the views of the Thai<br />
inisters and in turn will give an account of my visit to<br />
Vietnam. I have come away from Saigon reinforced in my views<br />
of the crucial nature of the struggle in Vietnam and fortified by<br />
the steadfastness and determination I found there. </p>
<p>Australia and Thailand work together as friends and<br />
partners in regional and internationial agencies for social and<br />
economic development, includ~ ing thc Colombo Plan, the Asia<br />
Development Bank and ECAFE, the latter having its headquarters<br />
here in Bangkok. Rc have the same approach to rcgional co-operation<br />
for economic development, technical aid and the sharing of skills,<br />
In our bilateral associations and through international<br />
instrumentalities Australia has become fully acquainted with<br />
Thailand's notable record of domestic achievements in economic and<br />
social progress. It is a matter for satisfaction that in a modest way,<br />
Australia has participated, through programmes of economic aid in<br />
this record of growth of developments.<br />
It is Austrolia's intention to continue with these<br />
joint enterprises which are planned and carried out with the<br />
efficient and purposeful co-operation of the Thai Government.<br />
I look forward with much pleasure to my short stay in<br />
the beautiful anu historic city of Bangkok with its happy blcnd<br />
of the charmn of tradition and the revolution of modernisation.<br />
