Current Affair.<br />
Amp<br />
1 2 November<br />
Prime Minister, Malcolm Fraser.<br />
Q. Had you known beforehand, about how all of this was going to<br />
turn out, would you perhaps have waited out the next 18 months.<br />
Fraser. No. I would have acted as we did act. If we had waited out<br />
an extra 18 months I think we might well have seen the circumstances<br />
in which Australians would not again have had an opportunity for a<br />
completely free election. We have seen a former government that has<br />
been prepared to take unconstitutional and illegal means on a number<br />
of instances over the loans affair, in their efforts to stay in<br />
government, which was much more serious than the loans affair. Once<br />
a government embarks on that path, it is a course that grows, it is a<br />
course that spreads. That particular sin of the former government<br />
would not have diminished as time passed.<br />
Q. Do you think the major election issue now will be the constitutional<br />
crisis, rather than the other issues of a couple of months ago.<br />
* ra I don't think so. This afternoon the Ministry met. It was<br />
briefed by senior officers of the Department of Labor and the Treasury.<br />
There is not the slightest doubt that the situation in the Australian<br />
economy is a good deal more serious than the former government had<br />
led Australians to believe. On a completely factual basis we were<br />
able to get answers to questions that had been denied the Australian<br />
public, and ourselves, through the Parliament. At a later time I will<br />
be making a considered statementi-about these particular matters. I<br />
don't to overrate the matter in the sense of causing undue alarm. But<br />
what I ani saying is that certain factors in relation to the economy<br />
were kept from the people of Australia. They were kept from the<br />
Parliament and the Opposition. They are more serious than we were led<br />
to believe. It will be on these issues I believe that the fate of the<br />
next government will be determined.<br />
Q. You said more seriously than we were led to believe. What do you<br />
mean by that.<br />
Fraser. Harder to overcome. The difficulties in the private sector.<br />
The problems of lack of investment. The problems of creating jobs for<br />
the tens of thousands of school leavers. The difficulty of overcoming<br />
inflation. These are the problems that are facing Australians which<br />
effect the life and livelihood of every person in every family.<br />
Q. How do you know that y~ u can fix them.<br />
Fraser. Because we have a different approach to policy, We believe<br />
that the government sector has absorbed too much of national production<br />
in the last year or two. There must be greater encouragement of the<br />
private sector. That can be an individual just as much as a company<br />
or a corporation, so that they can do their own investing, create<br />
productive jobs and create opportunities for Australians. </p>
