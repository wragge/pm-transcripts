CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING OF<br />
BUSINESS COUNCIL OF AUSTRALIA<br />
CANBERRA 18 OCTOBER 1990<br />
I have to congratulate you on your sense of timing. I was<br />
invited to this AGM by Dean Wills in the first half of July.<br />
Anyone who could correctly anticipate then that this week<br />
would see a major announcement on interest rates, as well as<br />
further progress towards one of the most significant<br />
Premiers Conferences held in Australia, obviously has a very<br />
effective crystal ball.<br />
I've enjoyed very much the discussions I have just held with<br />
your Council members on the subject of the Premiers<br />
Conference and I shall make some further comments about<br />
this important topic shortly.<br />
Let me first spend some time reviewing the Government's<br />
economic policies, which I know are of interest to you all<br />
particularly in the light of the further one per cent cut in<br />
interest rates announced on Monday.<br />
The basic point that needs to be made of course is that this<br />
announcement was just the latest instalment albeit a<br />
significant instalment in the continuing economic strategy<br />
we have pursued since we came to office.<br />
Because for all the variety of economic circumstances that<br />
have been presented to us by domestic or external sources,<br />
both when we came to office and in the following seven<br />
years, this Government has essentially been tackling the<br />
same fundamental problem: the need to rectify the nation's<br />
long standing structural weakness our incapacity to pay<br />
our way in the world with a sufficiently diverse range of<br />
exports. The policies the Government has brought to bear to address<br />
that weakness have been comprehensive, consistent and<br />
continued unprecedentedly tight fiscal, wages and, of<br />
late, monetary policies coupled with micro-economic reform<br />
of a magnitude unparalleled in Australian experience. </p>
<p>The excessive growth in domestic demand that we saw in 1987<br />
and 1988 only exposed this underlying structural failure<br />
more starkly to view.<br />
Australia wasn't producing enough to pay for what we were<br />
consuming. So the difference was being made up by borrowing<br />
overseas which showed up as unsustainable increases in the<br />
current account deficit.<br />
The inability of the supply side of the economy to respond<br />
to this growth in demand also placed upward pressure on<br />
prices giving us stubbornly high inflation.<br />
As I said last Sunday in a speech to my electorate, we have<br />
had to slow things down. That has meant making things<br />
tougher than they had been for some time and this Labor<br />
Prime Minister certainly took no pleasure in that.<br />
But our action has delivered two undeniable and massive<br />
benefits. First, in a negative sense, the hardship caused, for<br />
example, by real wage restraint and temporarily high<br />
interest rates, is as nothing compared to what would have<br />
ultimately occurred in the absence of such policies. By<br />
acting promptly we have contained the economic adjustment<br />
required to something that though uncomfortable, is<br />
manageable, compared to the catastrophic and traumatic<br />
correction that would, eventually, have been imposed on us<br />
by the rest of the world.<br />
And second, in a far more positive sense, the adjustment<br />
that we have sought in the economy is in fact taking place<br />
successfully. The signs are all there that domestic demand has now slowed<br />
significantly, providing increased opportunities for exports<br />
and import substitution.<br />
Net exports contributed some 3.2. percentage points to GDP<br />
growth through the year to the June quarter 1990.<br />
Imports fell 10 percent in the June quarter.<br />
Inflation as measured by the Consumer Price Index has slowed<br />
for the last four quarters to 1.6 percent in the June<br />
quarter. The current account deficits in July and August are<br />
consistent with the Budget forecast of a reduction from 5.6<br />
percent of GDP in 1989-90 to 4.5 percent this year.<br />
These welcome responses to the tightening we initiated in<br />
1988 explain why, since the start of the year, we have been<br />
able to ease monetary policy five times, bringing down cash<br />
rates by about five percentage points. </p>
<p>I contend I~ t would now be difficult to categorise the<br />
current stance of monetary policy as unusually tight. The<br />
relationship between long term and short term the socalled<br />
" yield curve" has assumed a more usual<br />
configuration, following a period, associated with monetary<br />
tightness, when short rates were well above long rates.<br />
The genera. level of rates is certainly above what we would<br />
like to sees in the medium term, but here we must have regard<br />
to international developments and particularly to the reemergence<br />
of concerns about inflation in the US, Europe and<br />
Japan concerns that have been heightened by the Gulf<br />
crisis. The key to achieving sustainable reductions in<br />
interest rates in the medium term is to achieve significant<br />
reductions in our inflation rate.<br />
Having made these points, let me acknowledge at once that<br />
much of the benefit of the monetary easing we have been able<br />
to achieve is still flowing through to borrowers.<br />
There has been some concern about bank interest margins.<br />
As my colleague the Treasurer has said, following his<br />
receipt of the report from the Treasury and the Reserve<br />
Bank, these are moving back into line with normal practice.<br />
This means, I believe, that banks should now be able quite<br />
rapidly to translate the lower rates into relief for their<br />
home loan and business customers.<br />
But I make this vital point. The other elements of our<br />
policy approach remain in place: a tight fiscal policy with<br />
a budget surplus that for the third successive year is<br />
ensuring the public sector makes no net call on national<br />
savings; a tight wages policy that has cut non-farm real<br />
unit labour costs by 10 per cent and that has lifted the<br />
profit share to near record levels; and a continuing program<br />
of micro-economic reform that is seeing historic changes in<br />
telecommunications, the waterfront, land transport, and in<br />
the very structures of the Federal system of Government<br />
itself. It is this combination of policies that will ensure that,<br />
through 1991 and 1992, we will see significant economic<br />
recovery and the creation of a climate for strong and<br />
sustainable growth.<br />
This prediLction is a sound one, whatever may be the<br />
technical parameters of any recessionary conditions later<br />
this year or in the early part of 1991.<br />
In fact, -the economy is in much better shape than is<br />
indicated by the gloomy findings of the various surveys of<br />
business and consumer confidence. </p>
<p>We are certainly not in any situation comparable to 1982-83<br />
which was, with its double digit inflation and double digit<br />
unemployment, the worst recession Australia had seen in<br />
years.<br />
And it is critical to understand that whatever may be<br />
immediately around the corner, we can already see past it to)<br />
the sound recovery that will occur in 1991-92.<br />
As we move through 1991, the easing in monetary policy will<br />
be fuelling a recovery, with personal tax cuts and the flow<br />
through of Accord Mark VI wage increases boosting household<br />
incomes. The inventory and housing cycles can be expected<br />
to run their course and contribute to growth. The recent<br />
fall in the Australian dollar if sustained would improve<br />
the outlook for exporters and manufacturers competing with<br />
imports. And under the Accord we can expect a resumption of the<br />
employment growth that has been the hallmark of my<br />
Government. It remains true that the Accord processes have been central<br />
to the economic achievements of my Government. So in the<br />
light of this week's remarks by the Governor of the Reserve<br />
Bank, let me underline the fact that the capacity to trade<br />
off wages for taxes has added a new dimension of flexibility<br />
to fiscal and wages policy making.<br />
But, as my colleague Paul Keating told Parliament this week,<br />
it is simply too early, with Accord Mark VI still in the<br />
pipeline, to entertain any real consideration of what may<br />
succeed it. Such trade-of fs require extensive and careful<br />
deliberation about the state of prevailing economic<br />
conditions and I would not want to lock the Federal<br />
Government into any premature understandings.<br />
My friends,<br />
Of more immediate importance is the effort the Commonwealth<br />
Government is making, with the States, to improve the<br />
efficiency of our Federal policy-making, administrative and<br />
financial machinery.<br />
I have discussed this at length already with your Council<br />
members. But let me briefly express here my gratitude to<br />
the Council for its strong support for the Conference and<br />
my confidence that concrete and significant outcomes will be<br />
achieved in five areas:<br />
Commonwealth-State financial relations;<br />
improving the arrangements for the delivery of services<br />
in pursuit of social justice;<br />
micro-economic reform;<br />
industrial relations; </p>
<p>the environment.<br />
I take this opportunity to draw attention in particular to<br />
the initiatives that will be discussed in relation to road<br />
and rail transport. Inevitably I suppose the attention that<br />
has been focussed recently on telecommunications and civil<br />
aviation has overshadowed the significance of land transport<br />
reform; but I can assure you that road and rail occupy a<br />
very significant place in our agenda for micro-economic<br />
reform. Hand in hand with these processes, but necessarily with a<br />
longer gestation period, are the renewed efforts we want to<br />
make to achieve constitutional reform.<br />
A Steering Committee, under the Chairmanship of the former<br />
Governor-General Sir Ninian Stephen, is to develop<br />
arrangements and an agenda for a Constitutional Conference<br />
in 1991.<br />
This is a task which should not be left solely to the<br />
politicians. I have said, for example, that I would be<br />
prepared to see a constitutional amendment to achieve fouryear<br />
terms for the Federal Parliament if there is<br />
bipartisan support for the proposal.<br />
If the corporate sector genuinely believes, as I think you<br />
do, that three-year terms are a handicap to efficient<br />
business, then it is up to you to make your views known, to<br />
exert pressure on politicians to see that the referendum<br />
does take place, and to give it your vocal support when it<br />
does. My friends,<br />
I want you to know and understand that the kind of analysis<br />
I have made of the Australian economy this evening has a<br />
powerfully important international aspect.<br />
Increasingly, our overseas trading partners and, of<br />
critical importance, our trading partners in the Asia<br />
Pacific region are recognising the significance of the<br />
changes that are being wrought in the Australian economy.<br />
It is certainly a central element of the diplomacy I conduct<br />
on my overseas visits. On my recent visit to Japan<br />
Australia's largest trading partner I told my audiences<br />
that Australia was prepared and equipped to engage Japan,<br />
the region, and the world, on new and more competitive<br />
terms. And I pointed out that the pace of change in Australia has<br />
rendered completely out of date the stereotypes that, once<br />
accurately, portrayed Australia as a frequently unreliable,<br />
usually complacent and essentially inward looking kind of<br />
economy. </p>
<p>I consider this kind of commercial diplomacy to be<br />
absolutely integral to the overall face that Australia<br />
presents to the world. Part of my job overseas should be to<br />
help open doors for Australian business. We are all the<br />
winners when Australian companies can attract new work<br />
overseas. But my friends all this requires one critical factor. Are<br />
Australian companies prepared to exploit the opportunities<br />
being created, and are they equipped to compete fully on<br />
regional and global markets?<br />
Of course there have been some very significant successes,<br />
and many of the companies represented here are actively<br />
marketing Australian products overseas.<br />
But the fact remains that much more needs to be done by<br />
Australian companies if we are fully to exploit the<br />
opportunities that await this country in the region's<br />
markets. We need to see a greater research and development effort; we<br />
need to see greater managerial competence with longer<br />
corporate planning horizons and more determined marketing;<br />
we need to see greater effort to master the unfamiliar<br />
markets of Asia as well as the more familiar ones in Europe<br />
and North America.<br />
And let me not omit from this list the need for a greater<br />
commitment by Australian business to training.<br />
That is why the book you have asked me to launch, " Training<br />
Australians A Better Way of Working" is such an important<br />
signpost to the future.<br />
It comes as no surprise to me that many Australian<br />
businesses as the case-studies in this survey show<br />
attribute their success to their commitment to training and<br />
developing human resources.<br />
The Training Guarantee, along with our increased support for<br />
apprentices, our expansion of places in higher education,<br />
and the dramatic increase in retention rates at secondary<br />
school level, show the Federal Government's active<br />
commitment to improve Australia's skills base.<br />
As you know, further recommendations have been made by Ivan<br />
Deveson in his report that we received this week.<br />
I don't want to preempt the Government's precise response to<br />
his report. But this much can be said with certainty: we<br />
accept that much more needs to be done to ensure the<br />
Australian work force is equipped with the skills it needs<br />
to enable our companies to compete internationally.<br />
This is a responsibility we have shouldered in the past.<br />
Most importantly it is also a responsibility that must be<br />
shouldered to a greater extent by business. </p>
<p>C r. L 7.<br />
Your report is a very welcome one and you are to be<br />
congratulated for it. I have pleasure in launching it.<br />
I don't think however that anyone believes this represents<br />
other than an early staging post on a long road towards a<br />
more substantial Australian business role in training.<br />
It is consistent with everything I have said today that<br />
business must adopt a more dynamic. response, in training and<br />
more generally, to the great process of national economic<br />
revitalisation that is taking place in Australia.<br />
It's a tough process, and a slow one. But it is taking<br />
place. And it must: continue to take place if we are to emerge a<br />
stronger and more competitive nation.<br />
That is why we can't afford any failure by business to play<br />
its part. As a nation we depend on businesses as the<br />
immediate agents of economic prosperity.<br />
Government can and must create conditions broadly conducive<br />
to a more outward looking, competitive economy.<br />
We can, we must and we are doing that.<br />
But ultima: ely it comes down to the skills and willingness<br />
of individual managers in individual enterprises to take up<br />
the challenge.<br />
The current account deficit will only be reduced by the<br />
accumulated results of hundreds and thousands of managerial<br />
decisions : o export and to replace imports.<br />
You are the front line troops.<br />
Ultimately, winning this battle is up to you and I cannot<br />
urge on you too strongly your responsibilities in this truly<br />
vital task. </p>
