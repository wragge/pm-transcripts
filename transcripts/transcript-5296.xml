FOR MEDIA SUNDAY, 16 MARCH, 1980<br />
ELECTORATE TALK<br />
Over the past weeks, many Australians have suffered unnecessarily<br />
as a result of the blatant and selfish exercise of union power.<br />
Such behaviour is repugnant to the majority of Australians.<br />
We have come, as a nation, through difficult times. Now, our<br />
inflation is down; our new international competitiveness<br />
means that overseas buyers want more and more of our goods.<br />
Billions of dollars of investment projects are about to go ahead<br />
in Australia.<br />
The most important result of all this activity is obvious.<br />
Employment is up by overl30, O00 in the last year. And there are<br />
prospects for future job opportunities. But there are selfish<br />
sections in the community who, if their recent behaviour is<br />
any indication, are prepared to sacrifice these gains by the<br />
abuse of union power and by adopting attitudes of self-interest.<br />
As has been too often the case in the past, this unthinking,<br />
militant behaviour has been supported or condoned in areas<br />
it should have been, from the outset, resisted, rejected<br />
' adcondemned.<br />
Let me be specific. New South Wales in particular almost ground to<br />
a halt last week as a result of a strike by petrol tanker drivers,<br />
members of the Transport Workers'Union. This dispute was not<br />
about wages or conditions; not about a fight between unions;<br />
or between Federal and State Branches of a union; it was a<br />
fight within a union.<br />
It centred around an Australian citizen, Mr. Leon Laidely, not<br />
trying to deny anyone business, not trying to say a non-unionist<br />
should do his work, not saying another union should do the work;<br />
but merely saying that one of his own employees, a member of<br />
the Transport Workers' Union should perform the job.<br />
The Union wanted the right to say who would perform the job.<br />
It was to prevent-this kind of occurence that the Government<br />
introduced Section 45D into the Trade Practices Act. Simply,<br />
is designed to stop organisations unions or companies<br />
from hindering or preventing commercial dealings between a<br />
third party and the boycotted company.<br />
That Section enabled Mr. Laidely to obtain an injunction against<br />
the Union because it was refusing to allow some of its members<br />
to deliver supplies to Mr. Laidely. / 2 </p>
<p>-2<br />
As Mr. Street said on Friday, while welcoming the cessation<br />
of the dispute, the Government views with real concern the<br />
arrangements under which the settlement was reached.<br />
In the settlement, it now appears that Mr. Laidely's supplier,<br />
AMNOCO, is to deny him supplies thus making a union ban<br />
unnecessary, and rendering Section 45D irrelevant.<br />
It also appears that the Company's action follows an arrangement<br />
made under the auspices of the Arbitration Commission.<br />
The Government is obviously concerned that this kind of<br />
arrangement can escape the provisions of the Trade Practices Act,<br />
and will look at ways to overcome the problem.<br />
Not only was last week's strike unnecessary, but also it was<br />
avoidable. The reason it was avoidable is simple. The<br />
New South Wales Government has the powers to face up to<br />
militant unions. For reasons known only to themselves, it<br />
fails to do so.<br />
My Government has argued for some time that the difficulties<br />
and confusion created by the division of industrial powers<br />
between the State and theCommonwealth need speedy resolution.<br />
That resolution, important though it is, is in the future.<br />
For the present, the New South Wales Government has powers which<br />
it gave to itself. Last week, as in the past, it failed to<br />
use those powers adequately. In the national interest, such<br />
an attitude must be reversed.<br />
The 1976 New South Wales Energy Authority Act provides that<br />
whenever it appears from any cause that available supplies<br />
of a form of energy were likely to become less than sufficient<br />
for the reasonable requirements of the community; or if it was felt<br />
that an emergency situation existed or was likely to exist in<br />
relation to supplies of energy, then the New South Wales Government<br />
has the power to control and direct the sale, the supply and<br />
the consumption of that form of energy.<br />
It has the power to direct a person or persons to transport<br />
that energy and to distribute it. It has the power to enforce<br />
this provision throughout any part of New South Wales, or<br />
throughout the whole State.<br />
Because these powers exist, it is unacceptable that the well-being<br />
of people in New South Wales has to be regularly sacrificed<br />
while the New South Wales Government, for reasons unknown, yields<br />
to powerful union interests.<br />
As happened last week, the control over fuel supplies in<br />
New South Wales was determined by union leaders, not the<br />
Government. After the strike was in place and it became clear that<br />
New South Wales was going to run short of fuel, the New South Wales<br />
Government did use its emergency powers to freeze supplies of fuel,<br />
and to forbid its sale to all but selected emergency customers.<br />
One might say that the New South Wales Government was exercising<br />
its proper powers in an emergency. / 3 </p>
<p>-3-<br />
But now it is reported that the priorities who was to<br />
get and who was to be denied petrol had been determined<br />
by the Transport Workers' Union, not the New South Wales Government.<br />
This was a total abdication of Government responsibility and<br />
demonstrated that the New South Wales Government was not<br />
prepared to stand up and-exercise its authority if it meant an<br />
argument with a powerful union.<br />
The New South Wales Premier attempted to hide the abject<br />
behaviour of his Government behind a public-relations exercise<br />
by proposing a referendum to hand over all State irndustrial<br />
powers to the Commonwealth. Mr. Wran knew very well that a<br />
proposal of that kind even if agreed to by the other Stateswould<br />
only operate in the longer term. It was not relevant<br />
to the current situation.<br />
The New South Wales Government has special powers under its<br />
own Energy Authority Act to control fuel supplies to the<br />
community. Last week we saw these either not used, or used only<br />
under the dictates of a union.<br />
In the oil industry indeed in any industry the ceding of such<br />
powers by the State Government to a union threatens the national<br />
economy. I have said before, the New South Wales Attorney-General is<br />
quick to invoke the law against company directors who do not<br />
operate with the law and so he should be. But why should<br />
union leaders who fail to respond to negotiation and conciliation<br />
be exempt from the provisionsof the law.<br />
There can be no prospect of long-term industrial harmony if<br />
Governments,' abdicate from their responsibility in the face of<br />
difficult decisions. The community must know that justice and<br />
the law can, and will be upheld.<br />
As I said at the outset, there are difficult problems in the<br />
union movement. The notion of where Commonwealth and State powers<br />
begin and end is not always clear to the community. There is<br />
usually a belief that because a dispute has a national effect,<br />
then its solution is within the capacity of the national Government.<br />
The Commonwealth Government does have powers, and will exercise them, as<br />
it must, in an effective and responsible way. But very specific<br />
powers are also held by State Governments and in particular<br />
by the New South Wales Government in relation to last week's<br />
petrol dispute.<br />
Had the New South Wales Government at the outset made it plain<br />
that it would not yield to the absurd demands of sections of<br />
the Transport Workers' Union, then the public could have been<br />
spared the massive dislocation that overtook the State.<br />
In the wool dispute which has halted regular wool sales<br />
throughout Australia since Christmas it was also necessary to<br />
resist unreasonable union demands in this case the<br />
Storemen and Packers' Union. / 4<br />
I </p>
<p>4<br />
Naturally, the Government is hopeful that the Conference<br />
now proceeding before Mr. Justice Williams in Melbourne will<br />
bring an early return to work, so that once again our wool<br />
industry can meet its export obligations.<br />
However, the arrangements agreed to by the brokers, growers<br />
and the Government last Friday will be applied progressively<br />
from tomorrow morning. Their application can only be prevented<br />
by a return to work by the Storemen and Packers' Union.<br />
The Government realises that by responding to the request by<br />
the growers and brokers to bring down regulations to control<br />
the export of raw wool, the entire industry could well be brought<br />
to a halt. The purpose of these regulations will be to ensure<br />
that the industry as a whole has a unified approach to the<br />
dispute, having regard to the gross disruption to normal trade<br />
that has occurred.<br />
Needless industrial disputes, if allowed to continue, can have<br />
a profound effect on the economic recovery that is under way.<br />
What we have gained in the last few years can so easily be<br />
destroyed by industrial disruption: by harmful and damaging<br />
strikes. It is in all our interests to put conflict aside.<br />
Surely, with the opportunities in front of us, it is time to<br />
put Australia first; to think of the national interests before<br />
self-interest; to see that what we do enhances national<br />
well-being rather than damages it.<br />
