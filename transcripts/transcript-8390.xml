TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP,<br />
ADDRESS TO ] LAUNCESTON CHAMBER OF COMMERCE, JANUARY 23 1992<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
Thank you very much for that kind welcome Michael ( Field),<br />
Robin Holyman, Mrs Holyman, the Chamber of Commerce, my<br />
distinguished colleagues, including the Mayor, Alderman<br />
Graham BeanEts, and my Parliamentary colleagues, Senators<br />
Tate, Aulich and Sherry, ladies and gentlemen.<br />
Thank you very much for arranging such a substantial<br />
gathering at: such short notice. It's a compliment for me,<br />
Robin, that the Chamber of Commerce was able to invite so<br />
many distinguished people tonight to come for dinner and<br />
that they've agreed to come. And I'm particularly pleased<br />
to be here in the company of Michael and Jan, particularly<br />
in election campaigns. We have partisanship in all of usmost<br />
of us barrack for our own side and I have great<br />
pleasure to be barracking for Michael.<br />
Over the years a lot of Premiers and Treasurers came my way.<br />
I must say I always have a soft touch for Michael, always a<br />
soft touch for Michael, because he had that disarming<br />
frankness about him, no nonsense about him. And there was a<br />
great change occurring in the fiscal basis, particularly<br />
with the States, there was a great funding gap between fixed<br />
revenues and discretionary spending, and no Treasurer in the<br />
Commonwealth of Australia had a greater, more difficult task<br />
than making -the books of the Government of Tasmania adjust.<br />
And as Premier and Treasurer Michael has done a sterling job<br />
for us, the public here. I don't know whether they quite<br />
understand what he has done. But he had to have a heart as<br />
big as Western Australia, big in size, to actually take the<br />
job on and to do it, and he's done that while at the same<br />
time balancing all of those industrial interest which have<br />
been important to the State's continuing progress and<br />
development. So I not only regard him as a pal and as a friend but as<br />
somebody who has really faced up to really rutted-in<br />
problems of the State he inherited, and didn't gloss over it:<br />
or take the cosmetic job, but to do it the right way. </p>
<p>At the last: Premiers' Conference I attended as Treasurer, he<br />
made a speech I would have been very proud to have made<br />
myself. It: was about fiscal policy, and his achievements<br />
were quite profound. So I was delighted to be in Tasmania<br />
with him today in the course of his election campaign and to<br />
be on his side.<br />
Now you've asked me tonight to talk about the agenda of the<br />
Federal Government and how we see Australia and where we're<br />
going now, and where we're going from here. And this will<br />
be important, not just for Tasmania, but for Australia as a<br />
whole. And I think that the main objective that we have to keep<br />
before our eyes is a commitment to growth and to adaptation.<br />
To growth and to change. That may sound like an<br />
unexceptional objective, but there are not too many<br />
governments around the world who have committed themselves<br />
as positively as this Government has over the years to<br />
growth. Andl that means taking a macro economic risk, taking<br />
the forward economic risk on inflation and the current<br />
account by : letting the place grow more quickly rather than<br />
taking the safe course which would put less pressure on<br />
prices, less pressure on inflation, less pressure on the<br />
current account to grow slowly.<br />
And during the ' 80s we ran Australia quite quickly, quite<br />
fast. In the first seven years of this Government the rate<br />
of economic growth was twice as fast as the previous seven<br />
years under the Fraser Government. And that was a<br />
deliberate policy. And that employment that came from it,<br />
which took the workforce from 6 million to 7.5 million, a<br />
per cent increase in the workforce, came expressly from that<br />
policy. But we've lost that growth with the recession, we've lost<br />
some product, and while we've kept largely those 1 1/ 2<br />
million jobs, we've lost some and we're adding to the<br />
unemployment pool because the labour market is not growing<br />
quickly enough to take up the new entrants into the<br />
work force.<br />
And so our commitment to return to growth, the commitment to<br />
return to equity and to prosperity, where all Australians<br />
have a share of the national cake through their capacity to<br />
get a job. And this is no more true than with our young<br />
people. So the Government will be committing itself to a recovery at<br />
the earliest opportunity, a sustainable low inflation<br />
recovery, andi to commit itself further to building on the<br />
successes of change in the 1980s in what was broadly the<br />
internationalisation of the Australian economy. </p>
<p>And so we are not embarking on an economic statement, the<br />
point of which will be to get a recovery going as quickly as<br />
possible, to restore employment back to the labour market,<br />
to check unemployment and then bring it down, and then to<br />
continue the structural change which we had, the momentum<br />
which we had up in the 1980s.<br />
And that Statement will be looking to further<br />
internatiortalise the economy, to pin in our success with low<br />
inflation, to bolt it in, to continue the changes and<br />
efficiency of each place of commerce and each workplace<br />
around the country, to change work practices, to change<br />
management practices, and to generally improve efficiency,<br />
to expand further our manufacturing exports, which have<br />
already expanded substantially in the 1980s, to improve the<br />
infrastructure of Australia, particularly some of the public<br />
infrastructure to make that process happen more quickly.<br />
And we can ( do some of that by building on the great fiscal<br />
position that the Government secured for Australia and for<br />
itself by having structural Budget surpluses, which in the<br />
cycle of the recession are now in deficit, but as the<br />
economy starts to grow and revenue starts to pick up will<br />
move back into surplus, to use some of those carefully<br />
husbanded changes in fiscal and budgetary policy to now<br />
stimulate the economy to lift it back to growth and<br />
activity.<br />
Now, much ha~ ve changed in Australia, but the ' 90s have to be<br />
a decade of productive investment because we're now paying<br />
part of the price of actually knocking inflation and<br />
speculative investment out of the system.<br />
That may not sound, again, a profound statement, but much of<br />
the 1980s was not simply about producing a taxable income,<br />
it was about having an inflation bet on the side. And often<br />
that was in property. Often a lot of companies or<br />
individuals w~ ho had reasonable productive businesses decided<br />
that because they were doing so well they'd have a little<br />
inflation bet on the side with an office block or a set of<br />
shops or an office car or something else or a factory, and<br />
it is that asset price problem, that is the fall in asset<br />
prices coming from washing the inflation out of the system,<br />
which has not threatened many of those businesses because<br />
they relied upon the inflation pump. And it's that change,<br />
the washing of two decades of inflationary expectations and<br />
inflationary culture out of that system, which has produced<br />
a recession of greater dimension than official policy ever<br />
wanted or probably would have caused.<br />
And when you had 20 per cent credit growth per year in the<br />
late 1980s, financing a production of about half that, we've<br />
now seen credit go back to about 4 or 5 per cent and the<br />
banking system has taken losses and is keeping to itself and<br />
is now abstemiously funding only productive cash flow<br />
investments. </p>
<p>In other words, the inflation psychology has gone. It is<br />
the going of that inflation psychology which gives us a<br />
chance of being a low inflation country where the premium<br />
again is on lower cost of money, low interest rates,<br />
permanently low interest rates through the ' 90s, a lower<br />
cost of capiLtal and a more productive place. That is<br />
putting the premium on building productive investment rather<br />
than simply investment in the non traded goods side of the<br />
economy. And that wil. l help us continue to grow the place in the<br />
and to become more self sufficient, less reliant on imports,<br />
and therefore less reliant on overseas savings and overseas<br />
debt. It's just worth recalling some things. Because I notice in<br />
the public debate we've had a few people say the policies of<br />
the ' 80s have destroyed manufacturing and our manufacturing<br />
businesses are closing down, and our agriculture is down,<br />
beef is down, wool is down, non-ferrous metals are down<br />
zinc, lead, etc, and therefore the economy is in<br />
difficulties. But the fact of the matter is that we had a<br />
very great success in manufacturing industry in the 1980s,<br />
and between 1982-3 and 1990-91 non metal manufactures rose<br />
by 200 per cent ' in that period, when total manufacturing,<br />
that is all manufactures including metal manufactures, rose<br />
by 125 per cent in the period. They more than doubled. And<br />
most of that occurred in the last five years of the 1980s.<br />
So the growth in manufactured exports is now 17 per cent per<br />
annum, whereas rural export growth was 2 per cent down. So<br />
if we were the same country today as we were in 1982/ 3<br />
relying on wheat and wool and other grains and minerals,<br />
then this country would be a country which wouldn't be able<br />
to afford to import, which would have a very low basis of<br />
exports, and the international market place would have<br />
sought to recess it probably in perpetuity.<br />
Now we've beaten than dismal legacy, that dismal prospect,<br />
by making the changes to internationalise the place in the<br />
1980s. But " the challenge now is to keep the process up.<br />
And they are the first order issues to get people back to<br />
work, to get a recovery going, to make sure the inflation<br />
rate stays low in a structural sense, to lift investment in<br />
productive plant and equipment, to get the investment up to<br />
get the produce, to get the produce to import compete and to<br />
export, to get the current account down and hence our<br />
reliance on overseas debt.<br />
And to do that to make the place set a premium and focus<br />
back on those parts of the economy long forgotten like the<br />
public infrastructure, the transport system, the airports,<br />
the airline system, all the things that are going to matter<br />
in whether Australia is a truly international place or a<br />
place which h7. as settled for second-best and which just<br />
doesn't have a national will to carry itself off as a first<br />
rate economic nation. </p>
<p>Now these are the challenges the Statement the Government is<br />
putting together will address. In other words, they are<br />
what I call the first order issues. And they are about<br />
guaranteeing a place in the world for Australian commerce,<br />
in the Asian Pacific area, the fastest growing part of the<br />
world, which we have been now very closely integrating<br />
ourselves through the 1980s and now the early 1990s.<br />
And it's very interesting to know that 15 per cent of our<br />
trade went to Asia in 1983-4, 15 only, and between 1983-4<br />
and late last year, that has shifted to 28 per cent. So<br />
it's a very dramatic shift in the orientation of Australia's<br />
markets and trade with the Asia Pacific area, which is the<br />
fastest growing part of the world, which has got the fastest<br />
growing demand and which will need the things for which<br />
Australia has a natural comparative advantage such as food,<br />
agricultural products in general, metals, other finished<br />
products, which we can supply to this part of the world for<br />
either further fabrication or specialised high technology<br />
things which Australia can do like telephones,<br />
telecommunications, medical services and of course all the<br />
services which we never had in the ' 70s such as tourism,<br />
financial services, again medical services, education<br />
services, and all the sort of sophistication of the service<br />
sector a country like us should have.<br />
So we are part way through the largest structural post war<br />
transition and what we want to do is to finish the job, to<br />
set Australia up in the ' 90s, to get back onto those things<br />
recovery, jobs, inflation, investment, the capital stock,<br />
exports, the current account and our debt.<br />
Now they are the first order issues. And what I have to do<br />
as Prime Minister and as Leader of the Labor Party is to<br />
make sure Australians understand they are the first order<br />
issues. And that basically we are not going to be dealing<br />
with those issues like inducing a recovery, creating<br />
employment, locking in low inflation, a lower cost of<br />
capital, adding to the capital stock and producing exports,<br />
we're not going to do all of that by simply taxing our food<br />
and clothing. And this is where I have to deal with my<br />
friend and colleague, Dr Hewson, and his proposal for the<br />
GST. Now I often get the question, and I've had it in the last<br />
few weeks, when are you going to get stuck into Hewson and<br />
the GST? Well, I'll tell you this. The politician in me<br />
wants to get stuck right into it but I'm not going to<br />
indulge myself. I'm going to do it when the time is right<br />
after I've put together Labor's plan for the 1990s. </p>
<p>And I don't doubt, I don't deny Dr Hewson the fact that he<br />
has a plan for Australia. But it is the wrong plan, it is<br />
the wrong pl. an. Flghtback is not a package, it is an excuse<br />
for a new ta~ x and there's more camouflage on that new tax<br />
than any tax: in the history of this country. Never has a<br />
new tax been so disguised by the ons and of fs and shifts in<br />
revenue and the changes to policy, but when you pull all the<br />
bits away, Underneath there what there is simply a tax which<br />
will tax thE, basics of most Australians.<br />
And the question will be whether Australians really want a<br />
tax that will go right to the heart of the Australian<br />
lifestyle, or whether they will want policy changes which<br />
will deal with the true problems of Australia that is<br />
taking us from an agrarian society which produced a bit of<br />
wheat and wcool and minerals to a sophisticated industrial<br />
place which provides employment to the cities where people<br />
live, where the bulk of the population is, and where we can<br />
have interesting jobs and be part and parcel of the rest of<br />
the world.<br />
Those are the issues for the ' 80S. AS usual the hard ones,<br />
the difficult ones, the ones which are not easily sold and<br />
won't be done in five minutes. But we are so far through<br />
now, we are so far through the transition that we've<br />
actually licked a lot of the big problems. We've got the<br />
problems of the recession, but we'll come out of this<br />
recession not with a 10 per cent inflation rate, like 1982-<br />
3, but with a 3 per cent inflation rate. Not with a<br />
structural budget deficit but with a structural budget<br />
surplus, a cyclical deficit but a structural surplus. With<br />
a high profit share because as soon as any growth occurs in<br />
the economy it will go straight into profits as the extra<br />
production moves straight into the profit share, which will<br />
mean we will be set up reasonably well to carry on our<br />
ongoing investment.<br />
So now we're running a current account deficit of about 4<br />
per cent of GDP. Our debt has stabled at about 2. The<br />
difference is about 2 per cent of our national production.<br />
That's about $ 8 billion. We've got to produce import<br />
compete or export to the tune of about $ 8 billion to turn<br />
our current account deficit into a surplus and to guarantee<br />
Australians -their sovereignty over their affairs from now on<br />
into the future. And to do it living in the most exciting<br />
part of the world.<br />
So in structural terms, if you look at the future, the solid<br />
bits, coming into the ' 90s is nothing like coming into the<br />
We came into the ' 80s with the wage share up and the<br />
profit share down, with inflation in double digits and mass<br />
unemployment, with investment smashed, with virtually<br />
manufacturing closing down, with no tertiary sector to speak<br />
of. And yet now we have such great opportunities,<br />
notwithstanding the fact that we repair from the recession<br />
to pick them up. </p>
<p>Now the recession is part and parcel of events world-wide<br />
there's a recession in the United States, there's one in<br />
Canada, there's one in Britain and there's one in Australia<br />
and in other. countries. And they're for roughly similar<br />
reasons. But be there or not, our policy must be to get out<br />
of it because it is not acceptable of us, simply for the<br />
Labor Party to say we will adjust Australia into a more<br />
productive place by letting the burden fall on the<br />
unemployed, they can carry the adjustments. That's not been<br />
the Australian way, it's not the Labor way. And that's why<br />
we must go back to positive rates of growth and do things<br />
that have quick mechanical effects inside the economy, to<br />
get the place back into growth and recovery, and to get that<br />
unemployment: down, so that all Australians can share in the<br />
fruits of our economic wealth and our economic prosperity.<br />
So they are the real challenges. To recognise that we've<br />
come a very long way, that we have come from a place which<br />
was slipping down the international income league table and<br />
which is now, coming back up that table in terms of its basic<br />
foundation of its wealth, and to realise that it is that<br />
which will give Australia it's future into the 1990s. By<br />
only being competitive, by only being productive, only being<br />
efficient can you make it, and we will not solve our<br />
problems by slashing our essentials of life with a very<br />
heavy flat tax, believing that that will cure all of those<br />
very specific and practical difficulties which the country<br />
is now facing.<br />
Now, the other problem about the GST is simply the fairness<br />
of it. Can I just make this point. I think it is fairyland<br />
for the Coalition to believe that they can basically market<br />
a tax which affects the poor the same as the wealthy, which<br />
is a flat tax, the same nominal tax on all goods regardless<br />
of income. And ' if you're on $ 20 000 a year and you spend<br />
all of your : money, all of your income and all of your<br />
outgoings are taxed. But if you're on $ 100 000 a year and<br />
you spend $ 40 000, only the $ 40 000 is taxed, and not only<br />
that, not only is the $ 60 000 not taxed, but there's a tax<br />
cut in stall for you as well. And that sort of disparity in<br />
distribution and that sort of unfairness is not what is<br />
required to keep the Australian community socially cohesive<br />
and looking at the same issues in recovery and production.<br />
Now, in the last few weeks we have had the pleasure of<br />
meeting many members of the business community in this<br />
consultation process which the Government has run. And<br />
three of my colleagues and myself have seen a very<br />
representative group of people from Australian business,<br />
unions and other walks of life. And I can say the most<br />
clear and obvious thing that came from that is a lot of the<br />
ideology has fallen away from the public debate. But the<br />
business commnunity was not in there saying, as they would<br />
have said a couple of years ago, look first thing is we<br />
want is the labour market deregulated; second thing is, we<br />
want a change in the tax system with a certain agenda. </p>
<p>Basically people are saying now let's put all that to one<br />
side, let's get the place moving again, let's pull together<br />
and let's get the place moving again.<br />
There's a great spirit of cooperation out there and which I<br />
hope the Government can use fruitfully to get Australia<br />
moving again. But I don't think that spirit will obtain if'<br />
we try to tear the consensus up and we rip away at the<br />
fabric by a profound change to the tax system, which leaves<br />
the low income people worse up and the higher income people<br />
better of f and we have a transfer of wealth from the poorest<br />
people to the wealthiest people in society, while at the<br />
same time wet try to lock in a low inflation rate and start<br />
rebuilding cur productive sector for the long run through<br />
the 1990s.<br />
It won't wash. And it's my job to tell people why the GST<br />
is not a policy, and I'll be doing it fulsomely, but when it<br />
suits my Government to do so. And it will suit it after, we<br />
will address it comprehensively after we've addressed our<br />
own fightback, the real fightback that is to get the<br />
economy moving again, back into recovery, and back into<br />
growth. So I look forward to working with the business community, to<br />
bringing down an economic statement which is relevant to the<br />
things that really matter, that really matter, about<br />
engendering that recovery, about sparking that employment,<br />
about pinning that inflation rate down, about keeping that<br />
lower cost of capital, about getting investment going,<br />
building the capital stock, watching that production grow<br />
and seeing those current account projections come down.<br />
That's where Australia's bread and butter is. That's where<br />
its future is. And isn't an ideological obsession about tax<br />
rates, which might have their place in Western Europe but<br />
don't have their place in Australia.<br />
So, I conclude on this point that the Government has<br />
listened and is listening to what Australians say. I'll be<br />
very interested to hear from some of you tonight your views<br />
about how you see affairs in your own State of Tasmania and<br />
we will be enideavouring, we will put together a policy mix<br />
which keeps on the main gain of Australia's competitiveness<br />
and its future, and keeps the fairness of Labor stamped upon<br />
it, but the product of which we hope can be accepted by<br />
broad sections of the Australian community as fair and just<br />
and in time. And I hope from the presentation of the<br />
Statement we can get confidence moving again so that we can<br />
actually get that confidence log jam broken and let people<br />
know that the Government wants the economy to grow, and the<br />
Government isn't sitting back there trying to keep the<br />
economy recessed or slow for inflation or current account<br />
reasons. </p>
<p>9<br />
It actually wants the economy to grow and will do the things<br />
to get that growth and activity. And we can go out, leave<br />
this trough, leave this period behind us and go back to the<br />
great changes through the ' 80s, build on them in the<br />
and find ourselves in a very, very significant position in<br />
the world and most particularly in the Asian-Pacific region.<br />
That has to be our great objective and that's what we will<br />
be committing ourselves to. Thank you very much for coming.. </p>
