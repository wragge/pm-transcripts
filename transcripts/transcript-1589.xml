VISIT TO US, CANADA AND UK L 18R Alt<br />
LOS ANGELES, USA<br />
PRESS CONFERENCE GIVEN BY THE PRIME MINISTER,<br />
MR. HAROLD HOLT AT LOS ANGELES AIRPORT. 29TH MAY, 1967<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I am on a journey this time to have talks with President Johnson<br />
and with Prime Minister Lester Pearson and Prime Minister Harold Wilson,<br />
and senior members of the administrations of those three countries.<br />
It is always a valuable thing for an Australian Prime Minister to have<br />
discussions with the President of the United States and the Prime Minister of<br />
the United Kingdom. As for the Prime Minister of Canada, we usually catch<br />
up with each other at Prime Ministers' Conferences.<br />
But the timing of this particular conference is linked up with EXPO 67.<br />
June 6 has been marked as Australian Day at that Exposition and the President,<br />
learning that I am coming for the Exposition, very kindly invited me for talIs<br />
with him. They will be very timely talks as there are several matters of major<br />
consequence we will have to discuss together. We have a very substantial<br />
concern with matters concerning Vietnam, British intentions East of Suez,<br />
the British entry it it is achieved into the European Economic Community,<br />
and there are always, with two countries that trade so freely together, trade<br />
and economic issues which call for some discussion between Heads of<br />
Government and Cabinet Ministers of our two countries. These are a few of<br />
the principal items which I refer to as looming large in our talks together. I<br />
I hope not only to have the opportunity of the talks in Washington but th9<br />
President has very kindly invited me to stay with him for a time and I expect<br />
to do this on my homeward journey. It would not be practicable for me to<br />
do this on my way over to the United Kingdom as I have a series of commitments,<br />
some here in your own city, but in Canada apart from EXPO and Australia's<br />
events there I am looking forward to meeting Prime Minister Pearson. I<br />
think that our two countries, both growing in economic strength and, projecting<br />
your minds forward some years to the time when they will have a considerably<br />
larger population, growing in economic strength and numbers together. And<br />
having in mind our special relationship with the United States and United Kingdom<br />
we'll together be able to play a useful role.<br />
In these days with less emphasis placed on Commonwealth meetings, I<br />
think a closer contact between Canada and Australia is certainly desirable.<br />
The projected entry of the United Kingdom into the European Economic<br />
Community poses some curious trade problems to Australia. The United<br />
Kingdom has a preferential entry into Australia and for our part we have a<br />
preferred entry for much of our primary production and inevitably it seems to<br />
us that some arrangements can be made and that there will be some adverse<br />
effect upon Australia's primary industries and I suspect a weakening of the<br />
United Kingdom's preferred position in our own country.<br />
So we have this to talk about, but overshadowing that in a sense is the<br />
future that Britain has to maintain East of Suez. There is, as is well known,<br />
the British intention to reduce its military establishments East of Suez. How<br />
far this will go and at what pace is a matter that concerns your own country<br />
and certainly concerns ours. I have been assured by Prime Minister Wilson<br />
that no final decisions will be taken on these matters until we have the<br />
opportunity of a talk together. So altogether my journey will involve me in<br />
some of the most important discussions I think that any Australian Prime<br />
Minister could expect to hold. </p>
<p>While in this country I have a significant number of speaking<br />
engagements and at these I hope to outline in more details Australia's<br />
attitudes in relation to its participation in South-East Asian and Pacific<br />
affairs, and the trade matters which concern this country and the other<br />
countries I have mentioned.<br />
Q. Mr. Prime Minister, you have been to Vietnam on two occasions and<br />
you have had a first hand look at the battle. What is your assessment of<br />
the situation?<br />
P. M. Well, I made the comment when I first returned that I was entirely<br />
confident that we could not lose the war in Vietnam. I felt at the same time<br />
it could be a long and protracted struggle there, unless the North Vietnamese<br />
could be persuaded to negotiate. We had, as you will know, experience with<br />
other Communist forces in Malaya as it was then known. It was a much less<br />
complex matter, far fewer people were involved, but it dragged on for very<br />
many years. But I have seen what has happened to Malaysia as it now is,<br />
now that Communism has been brought under check and I would certainly<br />
hope that, if we can bring Communism under check and restraint in South<br />
Vietnam, there will be the same economic and political progress there that<br />
we have seen so favourably marked in Malaysia.<br />
Q. There was a growing indication here that people were against the war<br />
and of course there was when President Johnson was down in your country.<br />
What is the general concensus of the Australian people now?<br />
P. M. On the first proposition, I think all sensible people are against war.<br />
It doesn't suit any free democratic or liberty-loving country to be invoilved<br />
in military operations. They are costly in terms o-flife even happiness<br />
they are costly in a material sense and I can assure you that we are just as<br />
fullhearted as any other people in seeing a just and enduring settlement<br />
come out of the Vietnam conflict.<br />
But at the same time, while the stress is there we believe that it must<br />
be resisted. This is not our first contact as I have just instanced of Communist<br />
aggression in South-East Asia. It can manifest itself in other places as well<br />
as in South Vietnam. I have only to mention Thailand as one of the<br />
possibilities and in Laos where I was quite recently I was told of the tens of<br />
thousands of North Vietnamese forces already infiltrated into that country.<br />
So that we feel that the struggle must be continued until there is a satisfactory<br />
outcome a just and enduring settlement. So far as my own people are<br />
concerned I think that I can illustrate it best to you this way. The last general<br />
election was foi, ght on Australia's participation in Vietnam and the involvement<br />
there for the fir'st time in Australia's history of men brou, ht in on a draft<br />
basis. The fact that we secured an all time majority in that election aigainst<br />
the strong opposition of the Australian Labor Party indicates the Australian<br />
attitude of mind. It is interesting to note that since th. en the spokesmen for<br />
the Labor Party have modified their outlook quite considerably. The Deputy<br />
Leader of the Party, Mr. Barnard, who has been touring South-East Asia<br />
and has been on a visit to Vietnam in recent days was quoted before I left<br />
Australia as having said that they would have to have a fresh look at their<br />
policy, that he was not convinced that it was not a civil war or merely a<br />
guerilla war, but there was evidence of the infiltration of Communist forces<br />
from the north. This modification, in fact this drastic alteration of attitude<br />
on the part of the Deputy Leader of the Labor Party following views expressed<br />
by Mr. Whitlam, Leader of the Party, the watering down of the attitude<br />
disclosed at the election time, I think will bring a greater unity amongst the<br />
Australian people on this issue. Certainly the determination of my own<br />
Party and of the Country Party which forms the coalition which I lead is quite<br />
firm. We have had only one dissenter from the policy, one Senator who has </p>
<p>since become an independent, but I think that we have only had one out of<br />
a record number of Members of the House of Representatives and a large<br />
body of Senators from both those Parties indicates the unanimity of the<br />
feeling on the Government's side on this particular issue.<br />
Q. Do you consider President Johnson has done everything postible to<br />
negotiate with the North Vietnamese?<br />
P. M. I am sure he is sincere in his desire to produce an early negotiation.<br />
Indeed, I think he has gone a very long way in regard to the important<br />
objective he mL~ st hope to secure out of any negotiation on behalf of the<br />
proposals which have been put on behalf of the United States administration.<br />
I have seen a good deal of him as you are aware during the past twelve<br />
months, possibly more in point of fact than the head of any other government.<br />
The circumstances which brought me here twice last year, his visit to<br />
Australia, our participation together in the Manila Conference, gave me<br />
many opportunities of seeing him and talking closely to him, and we keep<br />
in close touch by correspondence. I believe he is genuinely concerned to<br />
bring about a peaceful settlement as soon as that can be arranged with<br />
decency and honor and justice.<br />
Q. Your country has a considerable military combat force in Vietnam. As<br />
a military participant in that conflict do you, Sir, see any hopeful sign for<br />
a settlement?<br />
P. M. You can't claim to see a hopeful sign from anything that emerges from<br />
Hanoi, but I am quite certain on the evidence and I had a briefing yesterday<br />
which ran over the best part of two hours with Admiral Sharp of the US Navy<br />
and officers in Honolulu on the situation there that it is evident that the<br />
Hanoi administration and the people are taking terrific punishment. Now what<br />
are they hoping to achieve? They can't win this war and they delude themselves<br />
if they think they can. Surely there is enough realism for them to accept<br />
that they can't win this war and that they face a continuing destruction of<br />
their industrial assets, means of transportation and other things that go to<br />
make a vibrant economy. They can't look at the present troubled state of<br />
China with any confidence of a continuance of the present strength of<br />
support from that source. I have had enough dealings myself internationally<br />
and domestically with the Communist mentality to sustain a hope that even<br />
when you . seem to be up against a brick wall in negotiations with them, once<br />
they have decided that the game isn't worth the candle they can, without<br />
regard to consistency, logic or anything that they have said before, stand<br />
around and decide that the time has come to make a deal.<br />
Q. What is your present commitment in. South Vietnam and is your<br />
Government considering increasing that commitment?<br />
P. M. I am not proposin-; to comment, but the size of the commitment is known.<br />
The commitment in a national sense, of course, is clear. In the military<br />
sense it is affected by our obligations in other directions and at the moment<br />
it is not clear to us just what the British intention is East of Suez. But<br />
Australia does not really need prodding by the United States or for that<br />
matter by any other country to what it should contribute, having regard to<br />
its resources. It is perhaps useful to remind an earlier generation of<br />
Americans that my country lost more men killed in the first world war than<br />
the United States did and we didn't require any prompting about that. ' We have<br />
as I mentioned undertaken a major political issue in bringing in for the first<br />
time a selective draft of Australian young men to fight away from our own<br />
shores. WAe fought an election on it and put our political existence at stake. </p>
<p>4.<br />
Now at the present time not only do we have our political situation there<br />
to consider, we have certain obligations in relation to the Malaysian-Singapore<br />
area. We have recently been involved in meeting Indonesian confrontation,<br />
we have defence obligations as we see them to Papua and New Guinea. Vie have<br />
more than doubled our defence expenditure over the last four years. It may<br />
interest some of you to know that as a percentage of our gross national product<br />
Australia contributes more to defence than any Western country other than the<br />
United States and the United Kingdom. And remember that although we are<br />
geographically the size of the metropolitan United States, we are a small<br />
country of 11-t million people against your 190 odd million people.<br />
Q. Do I take it you are not contemplating any increase in your commidtment?<br />
P. M. We have no present intention of increasing the Vietnam commitment, but<br />
may I just add this. It is not perhaps generally known that Australia is the<br />
only country assisting the United States which has representation from the<br />
three armed services, the Army, Navy and the Air Force. We are also<br />
contributing in civil aid and that we do this entirely at our own expense. The<br />
Koreans have a much larger numerical strength, but as I understand the<br />
position they are largely financed by the United States of America. We don't<br />
receive a dollar of aid for the defence contribution we make.<br />
Q. What will be the effect on Australia's defence if the British pull out of<br />
East of Suez?<br />
P. m. I am not going to deal with that hypothetical question. I am goi1' Ig to see<br />
Prime M'Vinister Wilson and see if I can get a clearer view of his intentions<br />
there. He has assured me that there will be no final decisions until we have<br />
had some talks.<br />
Q. How does the present crisis in the Middle E~ ast affect Australia's security?<br />
There is a speculation that the Russians are using this crisis as a lever to<br />
get the Uni-ted States out of Vietnam.<br />
P. M. Well, on the first point; Australia, as its record in two world wars has<br />
demonstrated, and as our participation in Vietnam dem~ onstrates remember<br />
Australia was the first country to join you in Korea, and one of the few<br />
countries to join you in Vietnam finds itself concerned wherever the peace<br />
of the world is threatened, and we are naturally concerned with anything<br />
which is likely to threaten the peace of the world such as the events occurring<br />
in the Middle E~ ast. But Australia is not a significant factor in that situation<br />
in the sense that we believe ourselves to be not without some significance in<br />
respect of South Vietnam.<br />
As to the Russians using this as a lever to reduce the American effort in<br />
South Vietnam, well I can only express a personal view on that. I think that<br />
is a rather far-fetched view. I don't even think the Russiars want trouble in<br />
the Middle East any more than the United States or Great Britain want trouble<br />
in the Middle East. I see this as a product of Middle East politics and in<br />
particular the aspirations, the ambitions, the objective of Nasser and the<br />
chronic ill-feeling that exists between Egypt and other Arabic countries and<br />
Israel. Thank you gentlemen.<br />
Thank you, Mr. Prime Minister. </p>
