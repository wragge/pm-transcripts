ELECTION OF POPE JOHN PAUL II<br />
The Prime Minister has sent the following cable to His Holiness<br />
Pope John Paul II:<br />
" Your Holiness,<br />
I would like to express my congratulations<br />
on behalf of the Australian Government and people<br />
on the occasion of your election as Pope.<br />
You come to this high office at a time when<br />
mankind seeks the spiritual and moral strength<br />
and leadership which your predecessors have given.<br />
Your own experience and background are unique in<br />
the modern Papacy, and the world looks forward to<br />
the special contribution this may enable you to<br />
offer in the great tasks that await you.<br />
You can be assured that our thoughts and best<br />
wishes are with you.<br />
We look forward-to the continuation of the<br />
close and cordial relations which exist between<br />
the Holy See and Australia. Malcolm Fraser." </p>
