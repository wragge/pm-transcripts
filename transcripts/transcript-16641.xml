    <content><![CDATA[<p>Work is underway on the Primary Schools for the 21st Century (P21) projects in New South Wales, signalling the beginning of a raft of construction work across the state which will help modernise schools and support local jobs.</p>
<p>P21 is the largest component of the Australian Government's historic $14.7 billion Building the Education Revolution (BER) program.</p>
<p>The $12.4 billion P21 program will deliver much needed funding to every primary school for major infrastructure projects, including libraries, multipurpose halls and classrooms.</p>
<p>The first sod was turned today on the first of the public school projects. A new hall and covered outdoor learning area are being built at Minto Public School. This $2 million project is due for completion in December 2010.</p>
<p>Across NSW, a total of 1,764 schools have received $2.9 billion for 2,389 major infrastructure projects under Rounds 1 and 2 of the P21 program.</p>
<p>This is on top of $414 million for 3,069 NSW primary and secondary schools under the National School Pride Program for minor infrastructure and maintenance projects.</p>
<p>Successful projects for the third component of the BER, Science and Language Centres for 21st Century Secondary Schools, are currently being finalised.</p>
<p>The $14.7 billion Building the Education Revolution complements the existing and planned investments by the NSW Government.</p>
<p>Building the Education Revolution is a key element of the Rudd Government's $42 billion Nation Building  -  Economic Stimulus Plan to support jobs, stimulate local economies and invest in important infrastructure for the long-term.</p>
<p>A full list of successful schools and their planned projects are available at buildingtheeducationrevolution.gov.au or at <a href="http://www.economicstimulusplan.gov.au">www.economicstimulusplan.gov.au</a>.</p>
