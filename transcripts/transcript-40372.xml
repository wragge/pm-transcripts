    <content><![CDATA[<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER:Â </strong>Well, colleagues, welcome. Three years of Government, this is the term of delivery.</p>
<p>We are returned to Government, majority Government, with a big program - a program based on our national economic plan that we took to the election, a plan designed to set Australia up for the future.</p>
<p>We have so much to do, so many projects, so many programs to deliver.</p>
<p>We have a big task of Budget repair. We've set out the way we'll do that in the Budget.</p>
<p>We've got big infrastructure projects that we're committed to, completing the NBN in this term. We have got big projects of new infrastructure - Western Sydney airport, inland rail, right across the country - we are determined to deliver Australians the prosperity, the economic growth and the jobs that they deserve.</p>
<p>So there is lots to do. We have plenty of work ahead of us, we've got a big task and a great trust that's been reposed in us by the Australian people. We're equal to it and we're down to work.</p>
<p>Thank you all and congratulations. We are returned, we're back in Government and we're back serving the Australian people, securing their future.</p>
