METROPOLITAN AREA IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM WESTERN SECTORS OF SYDNEY<br />
AND MELBOU1kNE<br />
JOINT STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, MR. E. G. WHITLAM, M. P.,<br />
THE PREMIER OF NEW SOUTH WALES, SIR ROBERT ASKIN AND THE PREMIER OF<br />
VICTORIA, MR. R. HAMER<br />
The Australian Government and the State Governments of<br />
New South Wales and Victoria have agreed upon a program to improve<br />
the standards of living and opportunities available to residents,<br />
in the Western Sectors of Sydney and Melbourne.<br />
This was announced in Canberra today in a joint statement<br />
by the Prime Minister, Mr. Whitlam, and the Premiers of New South<br />
Wales and Victoria, Sir Robert Askin and Mr. R. Hamer.<br />
They said that the scheme which will begin a five-year<br />
" Metropolitan Area ' Improvement Program" will be aimed at bringing<br />
the western sectors of each city up to a standard of services<br />
comparable with that of the metropolitan area generally. Similar<br />
programs may be considered in other sectors of these and other<br />
Australian cities as part of a national program of urban area<br />
improvement. Australian Government finance for the scheme will be<br />
provided by an allocation in the Budget of the Department of<br />
Urban and Regional Development which will be announced tomorrow<br />
( 21 August). The Australian Government will co-operate with<br />
State and local governments, together with local interest groups<br />
in carrying out the program.<br />
Vario us projects will be undertaken to improve physical'<br />
and social resources and to increase the administrative and planning<br />
skills available.., o both sectors. </p>
<p>-2-<br />
Mr. Whitlam said that it was generally recognised<br />
that the Western sectors of Sydney and Melbourne had faced<br />
rapid population growth in environmentally deprived areas:<br />
" It is the policy of the Australian Government to try to<br />
eliminate the inequalities existing in the cities and rural<br />
regions throughout the nation; we also want to be involved<br />
as the National Government in making our cities and towns more<br />
stimulating and pleasant places in which to live", he said.<br />
" We have chosen the Western sectors of Sydney and<br />
Melbourne as the first in a series of urban projects because<br />
it is in these areas that the problems of inequality and<br />
deprivation are more obviously observed. Experience gained<br />
will be useful in solving problems in other areas resulting<br />
from similar processes of rapid urbanisation."<br />
There are a number of reasons why the Western sectors<br />
stand out as needing Government assistance, the Prime Minister<br />
and the Premiers said.<br />
These areas have a rapid growth rate, and a high<br />
proportion of children and lower income families. They also have<br />
a large percentage of migrants. These are the groups which place<br />
a heavy demand on public facilities, such as education, social<br />
welfare and public transport.<br />
Both sectors have suffered because, while housing has<br />
usually been available, there has not been a corresponding<br />
development of community facilities and social opportunities.<br />
Councils in the areas have found they do not have adequate<br />
finance to provide these facilities in step with demand, without<br />
help from State and Federal Governments.<br />
The main deficiencies appear to be in health, education,<br />
transport, employmqnt and community welfare services.<br />
Submissions received by the Department of Urban and<br />
Regio nal Development from councils in both western sectors<br />
showed that the problems emphasised were similar. Councils<br />
stressed the need for more and better physical facilities, improved<br />
levels of community services, additional-skilled personnel and a<br />
wider range of opportunities for residents in-the area. These<br />
included specifically, more hospital beds, special medical and<br />
health facilities, more schools and better teachers, and increased<br />
job opportunities. The submissions have come from Councils in the western<br />
spctors who have voluntarily joined together to identify problem<br />
areas and implement appropriate solutions with the help of the<br />
Australian and the State Governments.<br />
The local government areas involved in these initial<br />
Area Improvement Programs will include:<br />
Melbourne: Werribee, Bacchus Marsh, Melton, Bulla<br />
Keilor,' Essendon, Sunshine, Altona, Williamstown<br />
and Footscray.<br />
Sydney: Colb, Windsor, Penrith, Blue Mountains,<br />
Elacktown, Fairfield, Holyroyd, Parramatta,<br />
Auburn and Baulkham Hills. </p>
<p>-3-<br />
In Melbourne, eight of the Councils have formed a<br />
group called the Western Region Commission, and it is<br />
understood that consideration is currently being given to the<br />
inclusion of the two remaining Councils0 Bacchus Marsh and Bulla.<br />
In Sydney, two groups of five councils have grouped<br />
together and prepared submissions on some of the principal<br />
deficiencies of their area.<br />
The Metropolitan Area Improvement Program has the<br />
broad aim of building up physical facilities and community<br />
resources to an appropriate standard over a five-year period.<br />
The Department of Urban and Regional Development will assist<br />
in co-ordinating Federal financial and technical support through<br />
these programs. As part of the Metropolitan Area Improvement Program,<br />
the Department of Urban and Regional Development also proposes<br />
to set up a small expert Task Force to advise the Australian<br />
Government and both States concerned on how Federal funds might<br />
best be allocated. There are a number of different measures whereby the<br />
Area Improvement Programs could be implemented. To improve<br />
the physical resources of each sector there is a need to improve<br />
transport services, to undertake environmental improvement projects<br />
and to assist in the construction of capital works, such as<br />
distributor roads, bridges, sewerage, drainage and flood<br />
mitigation works, and community facilities associated with housing<br />
and employment. There will be an analysis of the potenti.' use<br />
of strategic areas of Australian Gove-i'-Yaent lando To deveiop the<br />
social resources of the region there will be: studies of manpower<br />
planning and employment promotion, the establishment of a regional<br />
library and information '-irvice, research inco needs of<br />
housebound women and cieatornstration p:: oject si-' h a'dventure playgrounds.<br />
To increase * Li, administ.. . tive an;' plar1ing resources<br />
available to the region, assistanw c-uli provided to<br />
metropolitan and State planning , t noyities iA their sector<br />
planning and satellite city deve'. opulent, as well as to groups<br />
of local councils. The Prime Minister and the Premiers welcomed the<br />
Metropolitan Area Improvement Program as a significant step<br />
towards solving some of our major urban problems and involving<br />
local people in planning for the improvement of their areas.<br />
