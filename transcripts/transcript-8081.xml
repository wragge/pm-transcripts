PRIUSERAIAISTE<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW WITH ALAN JONES, 2UE, 13 AUGUST<br />
1990 E OE PROOF ONLY<br />
JONES: Prime Minister, good morning.<br />
PM: Morning Alan.<br />
JONES: I suppose we should say something about the<br />
reason you are a bit late heading of f, what a colossal<br />
victory by Wayne Grady?<br />
PM: Yes. Well that was another golf conflict wasn't it.<br />
I mean it was one where this time that Australian Wayne<br />
Grady was fighting against the Americans and he displayed<br />
a lot of character and I thought the manner of his<br />
victory was just superb. He was very modest in victory<br />
and acknowledged that he got some good breaks, the others<br />
didn't quite get the same, but a lot of character and I'm<br />
glad you mentioned the nature of the bloke himself too.<br />
He's a lovely man and as you say has had some personal<br />
and family difficulties, but he's a great credit to<br />
Australia. JONES: Yes he is. Prime Minister onto the Middle East.<br />
What is your latest intelligence as the Australian Prime<br />
Minister on the Middle East position, as we speak.<br />
PM: Well it's no reason still for great optimism. The<br />
most encouraging development of course in the recent<br />
twenty four hours or so I believe Alan is the decision by<br />
the great majority of the Arab States to come in along<br />
side the rest of the world in providing forces and their<br />
support for opposition to the Iraqis. That removes any<br />
possibility for Suddam Hussain to misrepresent the<br />
position in the Gulf as one where its the American<br />
imperialists and their few friend attacking an Arab<br />
leader. That's gone now with that decision and I think<br />
that's the most important development.<br />
JONES: Yes, the forces, the combined international<br />
forces seem to have Iraq surrounded, but of course he now<br />
has all these insurance policies by way of citizens of<br />
the West in Iraq. That really loads the dice fairly<br />
heavily against some people doesn't it? </p>
<p>PM: Yes, we can't deny it, it would be stupid, it would<br />
be dishonest to deny that there is considerable risk<br />
involved in that situation. And of course there are a<br />
number of Australians involved. I think the world has<br />
taken the view however that this man must not be allowed<br />
to get away with this aggression and annexation because<br />
once before in this century we have seen the price of<br />
appeasement and it is a terrible and unacceptable price.<br />
JONES: Yes, if I could just inject perhaps a negative<br />
note into you decision and I don't think either of us<br />
would be critical of someone like Tom Uren who's a very<br />
idealistical man in many ways. I just thought that even<br />
he argued against the going, nonetheless, I thought made<br />
some point of merit when he said it's alright for<br />
politicians to beat the band and answer telephone calls<br />
from their mates, but there's very little compassion for<br />
the veterans when they come back. Do you think we look<br />
after our veterans enough. Any government, your<br />
Government, the Fraser government, the governments before<br />
that? PM: I don't think you can ever do too much. But all I<br />
can say is that I take an enormous amount of pride in the<br />
statements of Sir William Keys who as the leader of the<br />
RSL with whom I've worked for the great majority of my<br />
time as Prime Minister and he's been unequivocal in his<br />
comments about what we've done and I'm not in that<br />
respect trying to score points about that. Because with<br />
what we've done there hasn't been any opposition at the<br />
political level to it. So you can always I guess do<br />
more, but<br />
( transmission break)<br />
JONES: I think we might.... Are you there... You there<br />
Prime Minister. I know he's most probably gone into a<br />
ditch. He's actually driving to Garden Island. We'll<br />
just check, I think we might have lost that line.... it<br />
does appear as if we have. We might just come back. I<br />
just wanted to ask the Prime Minister if we can just get<br />
him back, and we just might be able to do that, what<br />
exactly he's going to say to the troops. So it's an<br />
important day, HMAS Adelaide, HMAS Darwin heading off to<br />
that enormously difficult trouble spot in the Middle East<br />
and as he said you can't deny the fact that there are<br />
Australians at risk there and you are dealing with a man<br />
who must be stopped. He said the previous price of<br />
appeasement was a world war and now this man is<br />
encircled. The Iraqi leader, President Hussain. We'll<br />
just take a break and see if we can get the Prime Minster<br />
back. He is in his<br />
JONES: Can I just ask you say, before without<br />
anticipating anything your going to say today, but what<br />
message are you going to deliver to the Australian men? </p>
<p>3<br />
PM: It's very brief. It's not an occasion for a long<br />
speech or high flying rhetoric, it's a sincere statement<br />
on behalf the people of Australia, of the importance<br />
first of all, of the mission they are about and the<br />
confidence we have in them. As I will be saying they are<br />
the heirs to a great tradition and we know that they will<br />
discharge their important responsibilities in a manner<br />
which will give pride to Australia.<br />
JONES: Difficult decision for a Prime Minister isn't it,<br />
sending young Australians into a battle field miles away<br />
from home?<br />
PM: Not easy and it's one that I spent a lot of time<br />
thinking about and consulting about. But in the end I<br />
had not doubt at all as to what the right decision was.<br />
JONES: From your discussions with George Bush and others<br />
what does your instinct and judgement after all that's<br />
about all you've got to rely on in this what does you<br />
instinct and judgement tell you, that it's going to be a<br />
long drawn out process. Or that there might be some<br />
solution to it more go on instinct and judgement in this case<br />
because if you are relying solely on rational<br />
considerations you could in fact come to a conclusion as<br />
to what the most likely outcome was. But clearly in this<br />
case we are not simply dealing with a leader who acts<br />
entirely rationally and therefore it's very very<br />
difficult to come to a conclusion. On all the evidence<br />
of how it's accumulating you should say that it should<br />
not take very long.<br />
JONES: Once Syria and Turkey sort of made the move that<br />
they made, he must surely come to the realisation that<br />
he's lost all support of that kind. On the other hand<br />
he's trying to mobilise the Arab people against that<br />
international decision, that in the past in certain parts<br />
of the Middle East has proved to be<br />
PM: Yes, though what we must remember is that there are<br />
a lot of subordinate people from the Arab countries,<br />
including...... ( lost transmission) and your going<br />
to have permeating through these Arab countries in the<br />
Middle East a lot of people who can speak with first hand<br />
knowledge of the nature of that regime.<br />
JONES; Sure. Good to talk with you and thank you for<br />
your time.<br />
PM: Thank you very much indeed Alan.<br />
