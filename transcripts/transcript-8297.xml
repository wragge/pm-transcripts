SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
SOUTH AUSTRALIAN LABOR CENTENARY<br />
ADELAIDE 11 MAY 1991<br />
I have had the honour this year, as leader of the Australian<br />
Labor Party, of speaking at Party functions throughout<br />
Australia cel. ebrating our centenary year.<br />
Throughout Auistralia, trades unions and working people<br />
generally madte an historic decision in 1891.<br />
In the wake of the massive industrial upheavals of that<br />
time, they decided to pursue their goals through political,<br />
and not just industrial, means.<br />
They decided to establish a political party.<br />
No one place, so single State can make an unchallenged claim<br />
to be the birthplace of our great Party.<br />
Barcaldine in May 1891 saw the historic strike by<br />
the: Shearers' Union, and the equally historic<br />
decision by the Government of Queensland led by<br />
that arch-Tory Sir Samuel Griffith to send in the<br />
troops against the strikers.<br />
Collingwood on 17 April 1891 saw John Hancock's<br />
famous'by-election victory that made him the first<br />
member of the Victorian Parliament elected on a<br />
definite Labor platform<br />
Thirteen days earlier, Balmain on 4 April 1891 saw<br />
the establishment of the first branch of the Labor<br />
Electoral League in New South Wales the<br />
precursor of Labor's tremendous electoral success<br />
in June 1891, when 35 Labor candidates were<br />
elected as members of the NSW Parliament<br />
It was in January 1891 that South Australian Labor reached<br />
its first major landmark.<br />
On 7 January 1891, at the Selborne Hotel in Pinie Street,<br />
the United Trades and Labor Council formally established the<br />
United Labor Party to endorse candidates on a Labor platform<br />
for parliamentary election. </p>
<p>At the first available opportunity, in the election of 1893,<br />
Labor won 10 of the 54 seats in the House of Assembly.<br />
My friends,<br />
It is right that one hundred years later we ask ourselves<br />
what is the significance today of these landmark decisions<br />
by our predecessors.<br />
It was basically a simple decision based on simple facts.<br />
At Barcaldine, Collingwood, Balmain and Adelaide, working<br />
people recognised that the only way to protect their rights,<br />
to advance the cause, to get better working conditions, to<br />
raise living standards for themselves and their families,<br />
was through action in Parliament not through the weapon of<br />
the strike but through the challenge of the ballot box<br />
When I spoke last weekend at Barcaldine, I said there were<br />
three important lessons that can be drawn from this crucial<br />
decision. First, there is the lesson of that fundamental commitment to<br />
Parliament.<br />
Australia today is one of the world's great parliamentary<br />
democracies. The commitment and determination of the<br />
Australian Labor Party has helped to make it so.<br />
The second enduring lesson learned from 1891 concerns the<br />
vital link between industrial labour and political Labor.<br />
The strength of one remains the strength of the other.<br />
It is true that all Labor Governments have an overriding<br />
responsibility to the nation as a whole. We can never<br />
succeed if we merely represent sectional interests.<br />
Yet it is equally true that cooperation between the union<br />
movement and Labor Governments remain crucial to the success<br />
of both and vital to the health of the wider community.<br />
I am deeply proud that, 100 years after the unions created<br />
the Labor Party, our constructive cooperation has never been<br />
better exemplified than it is today through the Accord.<br />
The third lesson of 1891 is a lesson for our adversaries as<br />
much as for ourselves.<br />
This Party and this Labor movement could never have survived<br />
for a century unless we had learned the hard lessons of<br />
adversity.<br />
Time and time again, over the last 100 years, Labor has been<br />
written down and written off and time and time again we<br />
have rebounded from adversity to success. </p>
<p>My friends,<br />
There is a further point of historical interest that can be<br />
recorded tonight.<br />
Last Wednesday May 8 the Federal Labor Party equalled<br />
the record petriod of continuous Labor rule set in the 1940s<br />
by the Curtini and Chifley Governments.<br />
John Curtin keeame Prime Minister on 7 October 1941 a few<br />
months short of fifty years ago.<br />
Ben Chifley wras defeated at the general election of<br />
December 1949.<br />
The intervening 8 years, 2 months, and 3 days were days of<br />
unrivalled Labor achievement guiding Australia through the<br />
perils of war and laying the basis for post-war<br />
reconstruction in a fairer and progressive Australia.<br />
I was elected. Prime Minister on 5 March 1983 and last<br />
Wednesday saw my Government attain that milestone of 8<br />
years, 2 months and 3 days of consecutive and continuous<br />
Labor Governmuent.<br />
There is nothing special about milestones. This is not an<br />
occasion for beating the drum or waving the banner.<br />
All I want to say on this occasion is a message that<br />
reinforces the message of our Party's centenary.<br />
Look back over the last decade or so and you find a decade<br />
of Labor political dominance, throughout Australia.<br />
We should be proud of what we have done proud that we have<br />
been able to win, and win again, the confidence of the<br />
Australian people<br />
and proud that we have been able to deliver, and<br />
deliver again, on our commitment to those in whose<br />
interests we govern.<br />
But look back over the last ten decades since our foundation<br />
and you see many tough times many years when Labor was in<br />
the wilderness years when we fought each other as<br />
vigorously as we fought our opponents years when we could<br />
not for the life of us persuade the Australian people that<br />
we were ready for the challenge and the responsibility of<br />
government. Labor knows what it is to go through hard times.<br />
We have never been handed political or electoral success on<br />
a plate.<br />
We have always had to fight, and to fight hard, in the<br />
interests of -the people whom we represent. </p>
<p>4.<br />
Tonight, it is important that we remember and that we<br />
remind our opponents that we know how to fight and that we<br />
know how to fight back.<br />
As far as the Federal Party is concerned, I will fight and<br />
fight hard to ensure our record of achievement remains<br />
unbroken.<br />
With your help, we will succeed. </p>
