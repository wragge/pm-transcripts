OPENU-NG-OF-TE-BOBHAWKECOMMUNLTYCENTRE~<br />
COBURG -14 FEBRUARY 1987<br />
DISTINGUISHED GUESTS, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,<br />
IT WAS A VERY GREAT HONOUR YOU DID ME WHEN YOU ASKED ME TO<br />
GIVE MY NAME TO THIS COMMUNITY CENTRE AT COBURG. THIS<br />
PROJECT BRINGS TOGETHER TWO SPECIAL AREAS OF CONCERN TO THIS<br />
GOVERNMENT NAMELY, AGED CARE AND MULTICULTURALISM, AND IT<br />
DOES SO-IN A PARTICULARLY BRILLIANT F-ASHION.<br />
THIS COMMUNITY CENTRE IS SET UP TO BE JUST THAT -A CENTRE<br />
FOR THE COMMUNITY OF COBURG. IT WILL PROVIDE ELDERLY PEOPLE<br />
OF MANY ETHNIC ORIGINS WITH A MEETING-PLACE-AND ACTIVITIES<br />
CENTRE FOR ANYTHING FROM A CUP OF COFFEE TO A FULL SCALE<br />
FESTIVAL. PEOPLE OF COBURG'S LEBANESE, TURKISH, MALTESE,<br />
ITALIAN AND GREEK COMMUNITIES HAVE ALREADY BEEN USING THE<br />
CENTRE SINCE BEFORE CHRISTMAS AND, I TRUST, USING IT WITH<br />
PLEASURE. THERE IS ALSO A VERY SPECIAL FEATURE HERE KNOWN AS A<br />
MULTICULTURAL KITCHEN. THIS IS INTENDED TO ALLOW ITALIAN,<br />
GREEK, LEBANESE AND TURKISH GROUPS TO PREPARE<br />
MEALS-ON-WHEELS FOOD FOR PEOPLE OF THEIR COMMUNITIES WHO ARE<br />
LIVING AT HOME UNABLE TO COOK FOR THEMSELVES. AS WELL, THE<br />
KITCHEN IS SET UP TO COOK SPECIAL MEALS FOR DIABETICS AND<br />
PATIENTS WITH CANCER, ULCERS AND CARDIAC PROBLEMS. THE<br />
KITCHEN WILL BE ABLE TO PRODUCE 600 MEALS A DAY.<br />
IT'S A WONDERFUL IDEA AND I COMMEND THE ORGANISERS VERY<br />
STRONGLY FOR THEIR IMAGINATION IN PUTTING THE PLAN INTO'<br />
ACTION. SO I AM PROUD TO BE HERE FOR THREE REASONS BECAUSE IT<br />
CARRIES MY NAME, BECAUSE IT SERVES MY CONSTITUENTS AND<br />
BECAUSE IT IS THE OUTCOME OF ONE OF MY GOVERNMENT'S<br />
IMPORTANT NEW INITIATIVES IN THE AREA OF COMMUNITY WELFARE.<br />
MY GOVERNMENT ALLOCATED JUST OVER $ 1/ 2 MILLION TO SET UP<br />
THIS COMMUNITY CENTRE AND TO FUND THE MEALS-ON-WHEELS<br />
SERVICES WHICH OPERATE FROM HERE.<br />
THIS MONEY WAS ALLOCATED UNDER THE HOME AND COMMUNITY CARE<br />
PROGRAM, WHICH IS DESIGNED TO ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF THE<br />
NINE-OUT-OF-TEN OF ELDERLY PEOPLE WHO LIVE AT HOME. </p>
<p>HACC SEEKS TO GIVE EFFECT TO THE GOVERNMENT'S COMMITMENT TO<br />
CHANGE THE BALANCE AWAY FROM EXPENSIVE INSTITUTIONAL CARE IN<br />
FAVOUR OF COMMUNITY BASED SERVICES TO HELP AGED OR DISABLED<br />
PEOPLE REMAIN IN THEIR HOMES FOR AS LONG AS THEY CAN.<br />
THE COMMUNITY CENTRE STANDS AS A GREAT SYMBOL OF THE<br />
COMMITMENT BY ALL THREE LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT TO HELPING<br />
ELDERLY PEOPLE IN OUR COMMUNITY.<br />
AS WELL AS MY GOVERNMENT'S ROLE, CAROLINE HOGG HAS POINTED<br />
___ OUTTHE_ VICT_ ORIAN_ LABOR GOVERNMENT ALLOCATED SOME LAND FOR<br />
THE CENTRE. AND OF COURSE COBURG CITY COUNCIL HAS PLAYED A<br />
VERY CONSIDERABLE ROLE IN ENSURING THE CENTRE CAME INTO<br />
EXTISTENCEB-Y-CONTRIBUTING MILLION-TO-THE COST OF-THE---<br />
PROJECT. IN CATERING TO THE NEEDS OF ALL AGED RESIDENTS OF COBURG,<br />
INCLUDING THE ETHNIC COMMUNITIES, THE CENTRE IS A GOOD<br />
EXAMPLE OF THE VIBRANT AND HARMONIOUS MULTICULTURALISM THAT<br />
THIS GOVERNMENT HAS ENCOURAGED.<br />
THERE IS LITTLE DOUBT THAT AUSTRALIA CAN BE PROUD OF ITS<br />
ACHIEVEMENT IN BRINGING TOGETHER PEOPLE OF MANY ETHNIC<br />
-BACKGROUNDS INTO ONE NATION IN WHICH THEY CAN ENJOY THEIR<br />
OWN CULTURES AS WELL AS PARTICIPATE TO THE FULL IN OUR<br />
NATIONAL CIVIC LIFE.<br />
AS-MANY-OF YOU WILL KNOW, MULTICULTURALISM IS A SPECIAL AREA<br />
OF MY CONCERN AND I HAVE ESTABLISHED AN OFFICE OF<br />
MULTICULTURAL AFFAIRS AND AN ASSOCIATED ADVISORY COUNCIL<br />
WITHIN MY PORTFOLIO.<br />
I BELIEVE THAT THE NEW BODIES WILL MAKE AN ACTIVE AND<br />
EFFECTIVE CONTRIBUTION TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF MULTICULTURAL<br />
POLICIES AND PROGRAMS. THEY WILL BE WELL PLACED TO PROMOTE<br />
BETTER CO-ORDINATION AND TO BRING ETHNIC AND MULTICULTURAL<br />
INTERESTS TO NOTICE IN THE POLICY AND DECISION-MAKING<br />
PROCESSES OF THE GOVERNMENT.<br />
I AM CONFIDENT THAT THIS COMMUNITY CENTRE WILL PLAY AN<br />
IMPORTANT ROLE IN ENHANCING MULTICULTURAL VALUES AND IN<br />
ENABLING AGED PEOPLE IN THE COBURG AREA TO CONTINUE TO LIVE<br />
IN THEIR OWN HOMES IN A FAMILIAR ENVIRONMENT.<br />
I AM NOW PLEASED OFFICIALLY TO OPEN THE BOB HAWKECOMMUNITY<br />
CENTRE AND IN DOING SO I EXPRESS THE WISH THAT IT WILL BE<br />
ENJOYED BY ALL WHO USE IT. </p>
