TRANSCRIPT OF NEWS CONFERENCE, FAIRBAIRN RAAF BASE<br />
16 JUNE 1989<br />
E OE PROOF ONLY<br />
JOURNALIST: what do you expect the reaction will be to your<br />
decision to extend visas to Chinese nationals?<br />
PM: I hope that it will be understood as a compassionate<br />
and responsible decision. We understand that it would be<br />
intolerable to have a situation in this country where any of<br />
these students here or people from China face the prospect<br />
of repression or punishment on their return. So we've madethis<br />
extension of stay and we will have a considered Cabinet<br />
submission which looks at all the implications of what needs<br />
to be done now to ensure that the interests of these people<br />
are properly catered for.<br />
JOURNALIST:* Is it possible we may have to boost our refugee<br />
quota Mr Hawke?<br />
PM: That could be the case. Just what sort of categories<br />
all these people would come into, how it will be handled, it<br />
is obviously part of the consideration I want in the Cabinet<br />
submission. The important immediate thing is to give these<br />
people the confidence that they need that they are not going<br />
to be under any pressure whatsoever. Because it is<br />
intolerable in light of what's happening in China that they<br />
should be subject to any fear of being returned to that<br />
situation at risk.<br />
JOURNALIST: Do you expect some sort of coordinated response<br />
from the Western leaders that you're meeting?<br />
PM: Obviously this matter is going to be one that will be<br />
high on the agenda of my discussions in France, the United<br />
Kingdom, the United States and Germany. Whether we get a<br />
coordinated response I think there has been, without any<br />
discussion between us, we've had a common sort of response<br />
of condemnation of what's happened. I would think that<br />
there would emerge a common sort of approach simply because<br />
we would be motivated by the same sorts of considerations.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Buschmann eventually gets back to<br />
Sweden? </p>
<p>-2-<br />
PM: We can only make the strong representations that have<br />
been made by the Government to the United States that we<br />
believe that the decision having been made here that he<br />
should return to Sweden, he ought to be able to do that.<br />
JOURNALIST: Are you confident of a better response from the<br />
US Administration on their trade policies this time around?<br />
PM: When you talk about their trade policies, in the broad<br />
area of trade policies, particularly within the<br />
JOURNALIST: The EEP.<br />
PM: I'll come to that. Particularly within the Uruaguay<br />
Round we have a very similar, in fact a common position as<br />
to what needs to be done. Now on the question of the EEP,<br />
this will be something that will be discussed. But I'm not<br />
going to allow the matter of the EEP to dominate the<br />
discussions because the relationship between the United<br />
States and Australia is one where we have very, very, very<br />
much more in common both in our bilateral and our regional<br />
and our global stance.<br />
JOURNALIST: Your reaction to Mr Gorbachev's suggestion the<br />
Berlin Wall could go down and there could be reunification<br />
between East and West Germany.<br />
PM: I would think that in the longer term everyone would<br />
hope that you could get a normalcy in the relationships<br />
between the two Germanys. As far as the Berlin Wall is<br />
concerned that of course has been an obscenity for a very<br />
long time. I think again it would be in everyone's interest<br />
that it should come down.<br />
