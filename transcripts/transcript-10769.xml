    <content><![CDATA[<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, good morning.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Good morning. How are you, Neil?</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, you're being accused of bashing blackfellas. You're</p>
<p>   accusing the Opposition of raising the temperature on race. It seems</p>
<p>   to me that politics of race has come to Australia. Now, are you</p>
<p>   willing to fight an election on race?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I don't want to fight an election on race. I am prepared,</p>
<p>   however, to have the Wik legislation, if it's rejected by the</p>
<p>   Senate, and I hope it's not - and I'll come back to that</p>
<p>   in a moment - I am prepared to have that as an element in the next</p>
<p>   election campaign. </p>
<p>But let's just get one thing clear. I have been very careful</p>
<p>   in all of the remarks that I have made, since this native title</p>
<p>   debate started, not to use inflammatory remarks. But yesterday Gareth</p>
<p>   Evans really hit the bottom of the barrel when he said that I'm</p>
<p>   never so happy as when I'm bashing blackfellas. Now, in anybody's</p>
<p>   language, that is very offensive. It should never have been said.</p>
<p>   Mr Beazley should have demanded that he apologise. It's ironic,</p>
<p>   isn't it, that when Don Randall said something he shouldn't</p>
<p>   have said about Mrs Kernot and about Mr Evans, I got him to apologise.</p>
<p>   When Senator Lightfoot said something he shouldn't have said</p>
<p>   in the Senate about Aborigines, I got him to apologise. </p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>[Inaudible]</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, there won't be from me and there won't be from</p>
<p>   my Party. And there won't be from the Labor Party if Mr Beazley</p>
<p>   has the strength to get Mr Evans to apologise. I mean, this is an</p>
<p>   issue for Mr Beazley. Mr Beazley is the Leader of the Labor Party.</p>
<p>   I, as the Leader of the Liberal Party, acted when people on my side</p>
<p>   said things they shouldn't have said. I got them to apologise</p>
<p>   and I got them to retract what they said. Now, Mr Beazley cannot</p>
<p>   escape the responsibility. He is the Leader of the Labor Party.</p>
<p>   He accepts responsibility for the overall decorum of the Labor Party.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>What on earth are we going into if, and it looks like it's</p>
<p>   inevitable, an element of the next election is the Wik legislation?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>But, Neil, don't say to me: what are we going into. We can</p>
<p>   have a debate about the Native Title Amendment Bill, the Wik legislation,</p>
<p>   in the context of an election campaign. And that debate can be conducted</p>
<p>   sensibly and soberly and with restraint if both sides of the argument</p>
<p>   are prepared to exercise that restraint. Now, I'm prepared</p>
<p>   to do it. I'm prepared to discipline people on my side. I am</p>
<p>   prepared to get them to apologise when they say things they shouldn't</p>
<p>   have said. Why won't Mr Beazley do the same thing? </p>
<p>Now, I don't want an argument about race and there shouldn't</p>
<p>   be an argument about race on the Native Title Bill. It's not</p>
<p>   about race. It's about a fair settlement of the interests of</p>
<p>   indigenous people, farmers and miners and it's about giving</p>
<p>   title security to all Australians. Now, it oughtn't be a racial</p>
<p>   issue. And the debate is inflamed and debased and despoiled when</p>
<p>   you have remarks of the cheap, offensive kind that were made by</p>
<p>   Mr Evans yesterday.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Is there any chance of the legislation getting through and if it</p>
<p>   does, what happens?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I hope it does. And let me say, in relation to the legislation</p>
<p>   - let me, on your programme, put a proposition to the Labor Party,</p>
<p>   to the Democrats, to the Greens and to Brian Harradine. We've</p>
<p>   just had a decision from the High Court on the Hindmarsh Bridge</p>
<p>   case which, I believe, supports the Government's view that</p>
<p>   the Native Title Amendment Bill is, in fact, constitutionally valid.</p>
<p>   I say to the opposition parties in the Senate: pass the Bill in</p>
<p>   its present form, as presented by the Government and if, as everybody</p>
<p>   says, it will face immediate constitutional challenge, my Government</p>
<p>   will do two things in relation to that constitutional challenge.</p>
<p>   We will fully pay for the constitutional challenge against the validity</p>
<p>   of the Bill - we'll fund it. And, secondly, the Commonwealth</p>
<p>   Attorney-General will submit to the High Court of Australia that</p>
<p>   the hearing of that constitutional challenge should be expedited</p>
<p>   and that if that application is accepted by the Court - and let</p>
<p>   me stress, that is a matter for the Court, the Court is completely</p>
<p>   independent in these things - then the constitutionality of the</p>
<p>   Bill can be determined, not immediately but almost immediately,</p>
<p>   quickly, so that we will know where we stand. You see...</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>So what you're saying is, pass the legislation and let the</p>
<p>   Court decide?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Exactly. Now, people are saying that they have reservations about</p>
<p>   the legislation because they think it is unconstitutional. Well,</p>
<p>   let us test that. And you can only test that if you actually pass</p>
<p>   the legislation. And we are prepared to abide by the decision of</p>
<p>   the Court. We've always been confident that the legislation</p>
<p>   is constitutional. We are strengthened in that belief by the decision</p>
<p>   of the High Court in the Hindmarsh Bridge case. Now, we would save</p>
<p>   a lot of difficulty. I think the Australian would breath an immense</p>
<p>   sigh of relief. And even people who are easily careless with their</p>
<p>   remarks, like Gareth Evans, could, perhaps, be taken out of the</p>
<p>   whole debate. If we can get the legislation through we will fund</p>
<p>   - I repeat that - we will fund, we will pay for a constitutional</p>
<p>   challenge and let the Court decide because...</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>So you'll fund a challenge to your own legislation?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, Neil, I want this issue resolved. I believe that the Bill</p>
<p>   we've put forward is a fair Bill. I have no doubt that it's</p>
<p>   constitutional. But let us find that out. Let it be tested by the</p>
<p>   Court. Now, it's a matter - there would have to be a bona fide</p>
<p>   challenge to it. And what I'm saying, if there is a bona fide</p>
<p>   challenge then, in the public interest, the Commonwealth will fund</p>
<p>   that challenge. And if it is representative of the groups that are</p>
<p>   affected by it, of course we'll refund it. And we'll also,</p>
<p>   through the Commonwealth Attorney-General, make a submission to</p>
<p>   the High Court that in the public interest the hearing of the challenge</p>
<p>   should be expedited. Now, it is a matter, I repeat, for the Court</p>
<p>   to decide because it's fully independent whether it exceeds</p>
<p>   to that submission. </p>
<p>But, plainly, it is in everbody's interests to get this thing</p>
<p>   through, to get it resolved in a parliamentary sense and then to</p>
<p>   get it resolved in a constitutional sense so that we can all get</p>
<p>   on with our lives and get on with other issues. And I think, overwhelmingly,</p>
<p>   that is the heart's desire of most of the Australian people.</p>
<p>   They're fed-up with this issue. They worry when they see remarks,</p>
<p>   of the base kind, made by Mr Evans yesterday and they say: well,</p>
<p>   can't you resolve it, you were elected to do the job. Please</p>
<p>   pass it, I'm saying. We'll fund a challenge and we'll</p>
<p>   ask the High Court to expedite a hearing.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>You're obviusly confident that you would win that, though,</p>
<p>   that the High Court...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, we believe we will win but we're in the hands of the</p>
<p>   Court. I mean, we are subject to the laws of Australia like anybody</p>
<p>   else. And I recognise the supreme authority of the High Court of</p>
<p>   Australia in interpreting the Australian Constitution and we will</p>
<p>   take our chances along with anybody else. Now, what could be fairer</p>
<p>   than that? And people are saying they don't like the Bill because</p>
<p>   they believe it's unconstitutional. I mean, that was the main</p>
<p>   argument, Neil, that the Labor Party ran for months. They said:</p>
<p>   look, you've got to delay the Native Title Bill until you've</p>
<p>   got the judgement of the High Court in the Hindmarsh Bridge case</p>
<p>   because we, the Labor Party, believe that your Native Title Bill</p>
<p>   is unconstitutional. Now, we've got the judgement of the High</p>
<p>   Court in the Hindmarsh Bridge case and they've said that that</p>
<p>   particular Bill is quite within powers.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>You will put this formally to the Opposition...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I think they would have heard about it by now.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>[Inaudible]</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>But I will certainly see that it's formally put to them by</p>
<p>   Senator Minchin and I hope they respond. I mean, it's a bona</p>
<p>   fide offer. Well, I've made it, I'm certainly not going</p>
<p>   to go back on it and why would I? I think it's a very genuine</p>
<p>   offer on the part of the Government to try and get this thing resolved.</p>
<p>   And, please, in the name of commonsense, why won't the Senate</p>
<p>   respond to such a proposition?</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>We're getting a few calls on this, Mr Howard, we might take</p>
<p>   one or two if that's all right. Hello, Brian, go ahead.</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>Good morning, Neil, good morning, Mr Prime Minister. I've</p>
<p>   just got a quick question. If we're all Australians and we're</p>
<p>   all born in this country, why are people trying to divide us about</p>
<p>   what's good for black and what's good for white, instead</p>
<p>   of what's good for Australians?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, as a principle I couldn't agree with you more - you're</p>
<p>   100 per cent correct. And we're trying to produce a piece of</p>
<p>   legislation that will do the right thing by everybody. It protects</p>
<p>   the principles laid down in the Mabo case and the Wik case. It does</p>
<p>   not take away the common law rights of Aboriginal people. It respects</p>
<p>   the interests of the pastoralists and the mining industry and it</p>
<p>   will deliver a great deal of certainty for all Australians. And</p>
<p>   we believe very strongly in the principle that all Australians should</p>
<p>   be treated equally and that is why we're not prepared to give</p>
<p>   a right to negotiate to one section of the population that is not</p>
<p>   given to others.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Is it correct, as reported in the Financial Review today,</p>
<p>   the Government is considering a compromise that has been put forward</p>
<p>   by Senator Harradine's legal adviser?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>There are no compromises, that I'm aware of, that we're</p>
<p>   considering at the moment. I mean, let me put it this way, Neil.</p>
<p>   There are discussions going along all the time. And I've said</p>
<p>   and Senator Minchin's said, that if there is an alternative</p>
<p>   way of getting to the end point that the Government wants that delivers</p>
<p>   the same certainty that the Government's legislation has, and</p>
<p>   we're obviously prepared to look at that, but we're not</p>
<p>   considering any compromise in the sense of the Government saying:</p>
<p>   well look, we no longer insist on this or that provision in the</p>
<p>   legislation.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Just a final point on it, Mr Howard, are we in a dangerous situation</p>
<p>   here, though? I see what's happening in the Parliament. It</p>
<p>   looks to me as if Mr Sinclair's out of control in terms of</p>
<p>   not being able to control the Parliament yesterday. There is an</p>
<p>   element of race debate in the community. Are we headed that way?</p>
<p>   Is there a danger that Australia is going to an era of racial division?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I don't believe so. I really don't. I don't</p>
<p>   find, in the community, racial tensions. The Australians that I</p>
<p>   mix with, and they have all sorts of ethnic backgrounds, are sensible,</p>
<p>   mature people who are above racial division. It doesn't help</p>
<p>   when you have inflammatory remarks and the cheap remarks of the</p>
<p>   like of Mr Evans yesterday. I mean, words are bullets in this business</p>
<p>   and people shouldn't make those remarks. And former foreign</p>
<p>   ministers and aspiring deputy prime ministers shouldn't make</p>
<p>   those remarks.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Can I ask you quickly, on another area - the Australian Workers'</p>
<p>   Union yesterday threatening to close down the oil industry if the</p>
<p>   waterfront dispute erupts. What would you do about that if they</p>
<p>   closed down the oil industry. Is it a secondary boycott?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I believe it is a secondary boycott and there would obviously</p>
<p>   be remedies available under the law in relation to that. I hope</p>
<p>   they don't do it. I hope they're sensible and they recognise</p>
<p>   that the Australian people would react in a very hostile fashion</p>
<p>   to that. The Australian people will not have a bar of these secondary</p>
<p>   boycotts. The Australian people enjoy the fact that last year we</p>
<p>   had the lowest number of industrial disputes for 85 years. </p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Will this hit the fan, though, after Easter, the suggestion there</p>
<p>   could be mass sackings?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, that's something that you would have to ask the companies</p>
<p>   involved.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>But they must be keeping the Government informed about it.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Look, the situation, Neil, is that we have ongoing discussions</p>
<p>   with a whole lot of companies and a whole lot of people, a whole</p>
<p>   lot of the time. The question of what individual companies may or</p>
<p>   may not do is something that is for them to decide. Our job is to</p>
<p>   change the law, which we've done.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>But wouldn't, in your view, any such action by the Australian</p>
<p>   Workers' Union or, indeed, other unions [inaudible] would that</p>
<p>   be a secondary boycott and, therefore, you would have the legislation</p>
<p>   implemented against it?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, it would depend on the circumstances. But it sounds to me,</p>
<p>   on what I know, that any threatened action of the type mentioned</p>
<p>   by the AWU could amount to a secondary boycott, yes.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>We'll take a quick call and then a break. Bill, go ahead please.</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>Good morning, Mr Howard. </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Good morning.</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>I've got a couple of quick questions. The first relates to</p>
<p>   native title. There's a fair amount of public goodwill in Australia</p>
<p>   towards the Aboriginals and I think it's being undermined by</p>
<p>   people who are seven-eights or fifteen-sixteenths or more white.</p>
<p>   My question is, can the Government define a real Aboriginal and</p>
<p>   stop these Clayton's Aboriginals from muddying the water?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, it's not something that appeals to me because I don't</p>
<p>   believe an attempt to do that in the present climate would help</p>
<p>   the mood of the community. It would be seen as being divisive by</p>
<p>   some, just as you think the present situation is seen as divisive</p>
<p>   by others. I want to try and get people to think, in terms of themselves,</p>
<p>   primarily as Australians and separately for - as well as that, retain</p>
<p>   a pride and a love of their distinct ethnic background. I mean,</p>
<p>   I went to that marvellous Antipodes Festival in Melbourne a couple</p>
<p>   of weeks ago that is a great celebration of the Greek community</p>
<p>   in Australia. I mean, they think of themselves overwhelmingly and</p>
<p>   primarily as Australians but they have a fierce sentiment and understandable</p>
<p>   pride in their Greek background and culture. Now, that's the</p>
<p>   right balance in my view. Let us all think about ourselves primarily</p>
<p>   as Australians but respect our separate heritage, whether it be</p>
<p>   Aboriginal or Greek or whatever.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>We need to take a quick break. We'll come with more in a moment</p>
<p>   from the Prime Minister.</p>
<p>[TAPE BREAK]</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, yesterday Mr Kennett, talking about the health situation</p>
<p>   again, said that the people were suffering. You accepted that and</p>
<p>   your own Government's looking at the reports from doctors.</p>
<p>   He says unless there's more money from the Commonwealth people</p>
<p>   will suffer more, waiting lists will get longer. Now, you're</p>
<p>   here for the Liberal conference at the weekend, is there any chance</p>
<p>   of sitting down with Jeff Kennett and trying to broker some sort</p>
<p>   of deal so people stop suffering?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I'll come to the question of suffering in a moment.</p>
<p>   I am always willing to talk to State Premiers and I have no doubt</p>
<p>   that over the next few days, in one form or another, Mr Kennett</p>
<p>   and I will discuss this issue and other issues. However, I have</p>
<p>   to say again that the offer the Commonwealth has made is a very</p>
<p>   fair offer. It's three per cent a year, each year, for five</p>
<p>   years on the existing money and on top of that their general tax</p>
<p>   revenue money is going up by just under five per cent in a climate</p>
<p>   of zero inflation.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Do you accept these reports that people are dying and suffering</p>
<p>   because of their health system?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, there is a shared responsibility and it is not only the Commonwealth</p>
<p>   that has responsibilities in health. I mean, we have direct responsibilities</p>
<p>   of our own. I mean, in an area like aged care, where yesterday I</p>
<p>   announced a whole new series of programmes which are designed to</p>
<p>   target some of the most needy areas in the community and that is</p>
<p>   of elderly carers, many of whom have looked after intellectually</p>
<p>   impaired children for periods of 20 and 30 and 40 years.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Yes, but I would suggest, I mean, with due respect that that looks</p>
<p>   a little cynical given that...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Well, because I'd say your Government is very much on the</p>
<p>   nose with elderly voters...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I'm not getting into the question of who's on the</p>
<p>   nose with who but...</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>[Inaudible]</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I think what you have to do is look at the merits of what</p>
<p>   we've done. I think it is cynical of people to look at every</p>
<p>   action that a Government takes in the context of its electoral popularity.</p>
<p>   The real test of a policy is...</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Are you saying it's not a political decision?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I said good policy decision. And I've done it because I believe</p>
<p>   that the measures are good measures and they will provide more support</p>
<p>   for older Australians to remain in their homes and that is what</p>
<p>   older Australians want. Older Australians would prefer to stay in</p>
<p>   their own homes than go into nursing homes. That is not to say that</p>
<p>   if they are forced to go into nursing homes they shouldn't</p>
<p>   get top quality care. But at any given time only nine per cent of</p>
<p>   the Australian population, over the age of 70 years, is in a nursing</p>
<p>   home. The great bulk of people in that age bracket are within their</p>
<p>   own homes and the overwhelming bulk of those people, again, want</p>
<p>   help from the Government and from the community to stay as long</p>
<p>   as possible in their own homes. That is the clear message.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>And the overwhelming majority want a health system they can trust.</p>
<p>   [Inaudible]...they feel they can't trust and they see the Federal</p>
<p>   Government and the State Government blaming each other. I mean,</p>
<p>   it's frustrating.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I can understand that but that doesn't mean that at both levels</p>
<p>   governments don't have responsibilities to consider the merits</p>
<p>   of each others arguments. I mean, we have made a funding increase</p>
<p>   offer of 15 per cent over five years. We have our own direct responsibilities</p>
<p>   in the area of private health insurance. The State Government has</p>
<p>   its responsibilities. Now, I don't want to prolong the public</p>
<p>   debate with the State Government, but the facts are that we have</p>
<p>   offered to increase our funding by three per cent a year, each year,</p>
<p>   for five years. Now, in any language, in a climate of zero inflation,</p>
<p>   that is a very fair offer.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>While we are on State responsibilities, would you be prepared to</p>
<p>   look at a State income tax, as is allegedly being agreed by the</p>
<p>   State Premiers, that they want a State income tax?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, we would be prepared to look at any consolidated proposal</p>
<p>   which is put to us by the States in the process of our considering</p>
<p>   our tax reform proposals, at the end, because it's the federal</p>
<p>   income tax system we are reforming. We have to take the final decision.</p>
<p>   But we have already had a lot of....</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>[Inaudible]</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well look, I will look at anything that is put forward. But I gather,</p>
<p>   from what I have read in the newspapers, and I have not discussed</p>
<p>   this with the Premiers recently, I gather that there is some disagreement</p>
<p>   amongst the States as to what they want. So I don't want what</p>
<p>   I'm saying to be taken as John Howard endorsing a State income</p>
<p>   tax. I am doing nothing of the kind. Well, what I'm saying</p>
<p>   is that anything the States want to put to us, in the context of</p>
<p>   tax reform, we will have a look at. But, at the end, of the day</p>
<p>   we have to make the decision.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Go ahead please. You're speaking to the Prime Minister.</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>Good morning, Prime Minister.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Good morning.</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>I can't understand why your Government does not give an incentive</p>
<p>   - when I was in the workforce years ago, private insurance...</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Private medical insurance.</p>
<p>CALLER: </p>
<p>...yes, medical insurance - a total tax deductible was allowed.</p>
<p>   Now, I don't know why you don't introduce that system</p>
<p>   today and then you'd find that that would be an incentive for</p>
<p>   the majority of people.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, we do have an incentive, not full tax deductibility, but</p>
<p>   we have a tax rebate.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Is it possibly part of the tax review, that it could be deductibility?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, anything - I mean, it's not something that we are immediately</p>
<p>   looking at. In answer to the question, we do have a tax rebate,</p>
<p>   it's not full tax deductibility but in the case of middle income</p>
<p>   earners it's the equivalent of full tax deductibility. It's</p>
<p>   $450 a year for a family, provided their income is less than about</p>
<p>   $70,000 a year. Now, that is $450 that would disappear if the Labor</p>
<p>   Party were elected because they have expressed their opposition</p>
<p>   to it.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Yesterday again this was described as $600 million wasted.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, by the Labor Party.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>No, by Jeff Kennett.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I don't agree with them and I would say to all the Premiers</p>
<p>   and, indeed, any people in positions of authority: it's a bit</p>
<p>   inconsistent on the one hand to lament the fact that there are too</p>
<p>   few people in private health insurance and then publicly run down</p>
<p>   the product and run down the concept of private health insurance.</p>
<p>   I don't think that is helpful at all. I don't denigrate</p>
<p>   private health insurance I've been a member of a private health</p>
<p>   fund since I was aged 16. I think all Australians who can afford</p>
<p>   it ought to take out private health insurance. I believe that very</p>
<p>   strongly. We have provided an additional incentive. It would disappear</p>
<p>   if Labor were elected. Every family under $70,000, if they've</p>
<p>   got private health insurance, would have to pay $450 more a year,</p>
<p>   if Labor wins the next election, for private health insurance.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Okay, we've got another call. Joanne, go ahead please.</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>Good morning. Mr Prime Minister, I would just like to ask a question</p>
<p>   regarding Austudy. I recently received a notice in the mail - my</p>
<p>   daughter is about to turn 16. Now, I've got a brochure here.</p>
<p>   I was wondering why there is such a vast difference in the difference</p>
<p>   between Austudy and Abstudy, which is for Aboriginals?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, the difference is not quite as great as it was. Part of the</p>
<p>   explanation for it is a recognition by governments over the years</p>
<p>   that there are some particular difficulties and disadvantages suffered</p>
<p>   by Aboriginal people as a group. And these measures have been introduced</p>
<p>   by governments, I guess on both sides, many of them over the life</p>
<p>   of the previous government but I accept...</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Are they out of balance?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, this is a difficult area, Neil. To the lady who's asked</p>
<p>   me the question, I can understand why she does think it out of balance,</p>
<p>   I can.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>But the argument is, if you are black you get more...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, if you've got two people side by side who are in similar</p>
<p>   situations and the only difference is that one of them is Aboriginal</p>
<p>   and one of them is not, I can understand the one that is not Aboriginal,</p>
<p>   feeling that is unfair. By the same token, if you recognise, which</p>
<p>   is the truth, that as a group in the community Aborigines still</p>
<p>   have...suffer greater health and education and employment disadvantages</p>
<p>   than the rest of the community, there is an argument to give them</p>
<p>   some extra help along. I think this is a very, very difficult area</p>
<p>   and I understand the....</p>
<p>MITCHELL: </p>
<p>[Inaudible]</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, we have made some changes. In the 1997 Budget we removed</p>
<p>   some of the excessive additions that were involved in Abstudy and</p>
<p>   it's an issue that we will keep under constant review. And</p>
<p>   I do understand the feeling that the lady has.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, has the Parliament lost it a bit. You were described</p>
<p>   as a sneaky weasel, was it? Simon Crean said he was thrown out of</p>
<p>   Parliament for shaking his head, which is a bit extreme if is his</p>
<p>   thrown out for shaking his head. Yesterday was a fairly disgraceful</p>
<p>   performance. I mean, we all enjoy the theatre, but it's gone</p>
<p>   a bit too far.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I think remarks like the ones you have just referred to...</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>[Inaudible]</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I mean, I've had plenty of rude things said about me</p>
<p>   over the years but...</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>I didn't want to misquote...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, no, no, I'm sure you wouldn't. I'm sure you</p>
<p>   would never do that. Well, I think those sort of remarks are demeaning</p>
<p>   of the people who make them. I think it says more about them than</p>
<p>   it does about the rest of us. Parliament is a vigorous place. There</p>
<p>   is little doubt in my mind that the Labor Party has set out to generate</p>
<p>   an enormous amount of noise and try and make life unbearable for</p>
<p>   the new Speaker. I don't think there's any doubt about</p>
<p>   that.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>But is the new Speaker doing a good job?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I think he is doing a very good job. He is tough, he is durable</p>
<p>   and I am quite certain he will do the right thing. But that is up</p>
<p>   to him. I certainly haven't been talking to him about the conduct</p>
<p>   of the House.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Thank you very much for your time.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Great pleasure, thank you.</p>
<p>Great pleasure, thank you.</p>
<p>[Ends]</p>
