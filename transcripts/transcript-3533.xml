showed estimated realisable assets as nil and liabilities of $ 39,992.<br />
On 29 March 1972 Mr. Roy Leslie Pegler the Liquidator of the<br />
company reported to the Commission pursuant to Section 306( 3)<br />
of the Companies Act that the company would be unable to pay its<br />
unsecured creditors 50 cents in the dollar. * That section gives<br />
the Commission certain powers of investigation when it receives<br />
such a report. The investigatibn conducted by the Commission<br />
following the receipt of this report has led the Commission to<br />
seek advice from the New South Wales Crown Solicitor as to whether<br />
any offence has been committed by any person in relation to the<br />
affairs of the company. The matter is presently under consideration<br />
by a Deputy Senior Crown Prosecutor whose advice is expected to be<br />
