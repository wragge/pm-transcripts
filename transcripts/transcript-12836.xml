    <content><![CDATA[<p>
The leadership of the State Parliamentary Liberal Party is entirely a matter for its members.<br />
I have spoken to John Brogden and have congratulated him and Mr Hartcher on their election.<br />
I extend my commiserations to Kerry Chikarovski who has worked hard in the Liberal cause in different positions.  I hope that she remains an active participant in the Liberal team.<br />
John Brogden and his colleagues will have my full support and that of the federal parliamentary party in their efforts to unseat the Carr Government. </p>
