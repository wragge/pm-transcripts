PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 16 JULY 1985<br />
JOINT STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER AND THE MINISTER FOR<br />
EMPLOYMENT AND INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS, MR RALPH WILLIS.<br />
Cabinet today endorsed the need for strong and direct<br />
Commonwealth legislative action against the'BLF in response<br />
to the Union's sustained record of industrial lawlessness,<br />
particularly in Victoria, New South Wales and the ACT.<br />
The detailed content of the proposed legislation, and the<br />
way in which the deregistration of the Union, or its<br />
equivalent, will operate at the national level arid in the<br />
different States, will be considered by Cabinet next week.<br />
The Federal Government no longer has any confidence in<br />
assurances or undertakings given by the BLF that the Union<br />
will conduct itself in a responsible way.<br />
The industrial record of the Union is appalling. It has<br />
continued to cause severe disruption to the building industry<br />
despite a number of written assurances that it would operate<br />
in accordance with the procedures of the conciliation and<br />
arbitration system.<br />
The actions of the BLF pose a continuous threat to the<br />
stability of the industry, the employment of other building<br />
workers, the national wage principles and the Prices and<br />
Incomes Accord.<br />
The Government is determined to create a new industrial<br />
environment in the building industry which will have<br />
significant benefits not only for workers and employers in<br />
the industry, but also for the national economy.<br />
The Government will require the assistance of building<br />
employers, the ACTU and other building unions to ensure<br />
the success of its proposals.<br />
There will also be a heavy onus on employers in the industry<br />
to take a firm stand. Too often in the past employers have<br />
been prepared to do separate deals with the BLF against the<br />
best interests of the industry as a whole.<br />
Further, employers have adopted industrial relations practices<br />
which have facilitated the success of the BLF's tactics.<br />
The Government is; only prepared to a' t as long as it has<br />
guarantees of solid support from employers in the industry and<br />
in the knowledge that they are prepared to take appiopriate<br />
action to put an end to undesirable industrial practices in the<br />
industry. A<br />
