( AS DELIVERED)<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR M4EDIA 30 October 1980<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER TO THE<br />
FINANCIAL TIMES CONFERENCE<br />
Mr Mullens, conference guests, ladies and gentlemen. Thank<br />
you for your welcome. May I in turn, both personally, and on<br />
behalf of the Govei ,, ment, welcome all the participants to this<br />
Financial Times Conference.<br />
The Financial Times is to be congratulated not only on choosing<br />
a most appropriate topic but on being able, so it seems, to time<br />
it well in relation to the election.<br />
The start of a new period of Government in Australia provides perhaps an<br />
opportunity to pause for a moment and to try to put some of the<br />
developments over recent years in the economy and economic<br />
policies in a longer term perspective.<br />
It also provides an occasion to look ahead beyond the immediate<br />
future and to consider the sort of policies that are likely to<br />
be required if the exciting potential for economic development in fact<br />
is to be realised. One of the lessons of the last ten years which<br />
sounds obvious but which has not yet been fully learned is<br />
that economic growth is not an automatic process.<br />
There has to be an environment conducive to economic development<br />
and economic achievement; and that is something that has to be<br />
worked at. Governments, of course, have important responsibilities<br />
in this regard. But Governments cannot do it on their own.<br />
Businesses and trade unions and, even more importantly, perhaps,<br />
individuals have a responsibility not only to have regard to the<br />
longer term interests of the community in their own actions, but<br />
to support Government policies that are working to that end.<br />
Government in Australia has to operate within a time frame of<br />
three years. But policies frequently take much longer than that to<br />
come to fruition and, unless they receive recognition and<br />
support in the meantime, they can become difficult to sustain.<br />
/ 2 </p>
<p>-2-<br />
This is very relevant to the period ahead, when there will be<br />
a particular need for policies that have regard to more than<br />
just a year or so into the future if full advantage is to be<br />
taken of the burgeoning opportunities for development. You<br />
will probably all be aware by now of the very large figures<br />
that have been produced by surveys of businesses' forward investment<br />
plans.<br />
It is not necessary, therefore, to elaborate again on these<br />
here, except perhaps to emphasise that the Government is well<br />
aware that the realisation of these forward plans is dependent<br />
upon having the right environment. We recognise also that, as<br />
part of having the right environment, there will be a need for<br />
this investment to be spread over a period, so as to avoid<br />
inflationary pressures and to maintain economic stability.<br />
It is also important to appreciate that, while a good deal of<br />
this large planned investment is related to resource development,<br />
it is more broadly.,. based than that. With a return to more stable<br />
economic conditio increased investment opportunities are<br />
opening across a wide range of industries in Australia.<br />
It is not always fully appreciated that, over the last 20-30 years,<br />
there has been a significant broadening of the base of the<br />
Australian economy. Thirty years ago, over 20% of national output<br />
came from the rural sector, which was highly dependent on<br />
fluctuating export markets.<br />
But, during the last 30 years, there have been notable structural<br />
changes. Although they still contribute only a small proportion<br />
of national output, mining industries have expanded significantly<br />
in relative terms, as have tertiary industries.<br />
The net result of these changes is that the rural sector's share<br />
of output is now only approximately the same as that of miningsabout<br />
5% of GDP.<br />
However, notwithstanding that large relative decline, the<br />
absolute level of rural output has almost doubled over the<br />
last 20 years. Those who predict a gloomy future for manufacturing<br />
in Australia would do well to take note of that.<br />
The increasing opportunities for expansion in mining and tertiary<br />
industries suggests that there will be a reduction in the relative<br />
size of the manufacturing sector in the years ahead; but this can,<br />
and I believe will, be accompanied by growth in output and<br />
expanding investment opportunities.<br />
There should, indeed, be great opportunities for internationally<br />
efficient manufacturing industries in areas such as minerals<br />
processing and the servicing of growing ex O t markets in Asia.<br />
Now, the question you have really asked me to address is how to make<br />
sure that these and other opportunities are taken. </p>
<p>Perhaps-the first thing to acknowledge is that, no matter ho' q<br />
good the resource base, no matter how promising the export markets,<br />
economic development will be frustrated unless there is a<br />
reasonable degree of social and political stability.<br />
Community attitudes need to be generally conducive to and<br />
sympathetic with such development and the investment needed<br />
to achieve that; it must therefore be an important aim of<br />
Government to maintain a community consensus on broad<br />
objectives. Australia is more fortunate than most in having.<br />
that kind of a broad consensus.<br />
There are many reasons for this such as fewer social divisions.<br />
and a more equal income distribution which cannot be explored<br />
here.<br />
At the same time there are, inevitably, matters on which fundamental<br />
disagreement about objectives will arise from time to time; where,<br />
as a result, Government has to take decisions that some will see<br />
as cnfrotingther interests or their view of national interests.<br />
We cannot expect the running of a country to be like rowing an<br />
eight where everyone has to pull together if the boat is to have any<br />
chance of winning. There will always be some who, seeing their<br />
perceived interests threatened, will pull their oar against<br />
Government decisions or, at least, not in time with them.<br />
That is something that, in a democratic community, we have to<br />
expect and, within limits, to live with.<br />
Equally, it has to be recognised that Government would become<br />
impossible if decisions could never be in conflict with views<br />
of particular-interest groups. While paying appropriate regard<br />
to minority rights and interests, Government must therefore<br />
implement policies on the basis of its assessment as to where<br />
the broad national interest lies.<br />
This is very relevant to creating the appropriate environment<br />
for investment. In framing policies Governments are continually<br />
faced with the need to decide between competing economic and<br />
social goals. We all know that we would have a faster<br />
rate of economic development if there was no need to take account<br />
of possible effects on, for example, the environment or<br />
traditional Aboriginal areas. But these are matters which<br />
Governments must take fully into account if a broad social<br />
consensus is to be maintained. This is, of course, a<br />
widely accepted function of modern Government.<br />
What is less widely accepted and even less widely understood<br />
is that this can involve sacrificing the economic interests of<br />
other groups as well as retarding national economic development<br />
and living standards. It may be more a matter of the speed at<br />
which economic change is-to be permitted rather than any absolute<br />
prohibition. </p>
<p>-4-<br />
Where important differences exist in community attitudes, or<br />
where arrangements have existed virtually undisturbed for many<br />
years, it may be in the longer term interests of development<br />
to allow change to occur more gradually.<br />
The Government's policy on uranium, for instance, has sought<br />
to ensure a pace of development that allowed time for<br />
community attitudes to clarify and for appropriate safeguards<br />
to be instituted.<br />
Notwithstanding continued opposition from a small section of<br />
the community strongly antagonistic to such development, the<br />
Government is satisfied now that there are both appropriate<br />
safeguards and a widespread consensus in favour of uranium<br />
mining and export.<br />
Accordingly we expect such development and investment to push<br />
ahead, helping to meet the growing demand for additional sources<br />
of energy and contri-ibuting to the national economy. Equally,<br />
as the recovery irthe economy proceeds and gathers strength, there is an<br />
increased capacity to allow structural change arnd this, in turn, allows<br />
economic succes's to build on itself as resources move to<br />
areas of the economy where higher returns and profits can be obtained.<br />
The problem of the appropriate speed at which to allow<br />
structural change is a good illustration of the continuing<br />
need to balance possible damage to investor confidence of<br />
allowing rapid change against the costs involved if economic<br />
change is prevented to the detriment of the community at large.<br />
This is part of the wider problem of the continuing need to<br />
weigh the costs of regulation of business and of intervention<br />
by Government. The Government's objective has been and remainsto<br />
avoid sudden, large changes. Over the next three years, we<br />
will however be closely examining existing arrangements that<br />
operate to inhibit investment and economic change.<br />
Wle are conscious of a growing feeling in Australian society<br />
that, after experiencing a period of economic difficulty,<br />
there is now a wish for faster growth in living standards.<br />
But at the same time, we also be conscious that that can only occur<br />
through real growth in the economy itself.<br />
Economic development and change will be encouraged to proceed,<br />
unless there are clear national interests to the contrary. </p>
<p>There-will, at the same time, be a need to ensure that thefruits<br />
of economic growth are appropriately distributed.<br />
This is an important aspect of the Government's responsibility<br />
. to maintain a social and political climate within which<br />
economic development and investment can proceed without<br />
creating community tension. There are many difficult issues here.<br />
One of the more important concerns the need to make sure -there is<br />
equitable sharing of the burden of taxation. That is a<br />
subject on. which opinions differ widely but to which we<br />
will be giving close attention over the coming years.<br />
The Government is particularly concerned at the increase in<br />
recent years in the extent of tax avoidance. We will<br />
continue to legislate against such schemes whenever they<br />
are identified and to take such. other action as can be<br />
devised appropriately..<br />
The Government will also be concerned to make sure that there<br />
are adequate oppox. tunities both for Australian investors to<br />
participate in pJfojects involving foreign investment and<br />
for the Australian community at large to be seen to benefit<br />
from them.<br />
Fortunately this is now widely accepted, both by foreign<br />
investors themselves and by the Australian community.<br />
Australia is going to need increasing amounts of foreign<br />
capital to develop its natural resources and other<br />
industries but unlike many other countries we do not<br />
have to provide special tax incentives to attract it.<br />
One particular government responsibility a key one in<br />
shaping the investment environment concerns economic<br />
management. Government economic policies naturally have an important<br />
influence on a major determinant of investment profitability<br />
as well as on the confidence with which businesses can<br />
plan ahead in the knowledge that sudden, large changes will<br />
not be wrought in economic conditions.<br />
Over the last five years the Government has in fact approached<br />
the task of economic restoration in a medium term time frame.<br />
As the last O. E. C. D. survey of Australia put it,<br />
" The management of the Australian economy has remained<br />
broadly unchanged since late 1975 when the authorities<br />
embarked on a steady policy approach, which, through<br />
relatively restrictive fiscal and monetary policies,<br />
aimed at removing the imbalances impeding a return to<br />
sustained non-inflationary growth over the medium term". </p>
<p>-6-<br />
We realised that, after the economic upheavals through<br />
which the Australian economy passed a few years ago, it<br />
would take time to reduce the imbalances and to re-establish<br />
a framework within which businessmen and consumers<br />
could again begin to take decisions with confidence.<br />
Against this background, it is surprising to hear some<br />
suggestions that the Government's economic policies may<br />
have been too " austere". It is difficult to see how such<br />
suggestions could be rationalised in view of the appraoch<br />
which is summed up in that OECD quotation.<br />
There has been no sudden, dramatic action to reduce demand<br />
or to expose the economy to increased external competition.<br />
we have instead pursued a steady, moderate but persistent<br />
approach towards the restoration of economic health.<br />
Of course, this has necessitated relatively restrictive<br />
economic policies because our main objective has been and<br />
remains to reduce inflation and inflationary expectations.<br />
We achieved a considerable measure of success in that<br />
regard during iur first period in office. More recently,<br />
in common with other countries, we have experienced some<br />
setbacks. But whatever shortcomings there may have been in our handling<br />
of that situation, it cannot be denied that we succeeded much<br />
better than many others in containing inflation, so that our<br />
international competitiveness was maintained and in many<br />
cases substantially improved.<br />
This phase of increasing world inflation has now passed, at<br />
least for the time being. overseas influences should<br />
therefore become a positive factor in helping to reduce<br />
domestic inflation. Even so, there will be a need for close<br />
attention to domestic economic policy settings, a matter<br />
to which I will return shortly.<br />
Before doing so, however, I want to say something about why<br />
the Government regards it as so important to reduce inflation<br />
rather than, as some would have us do, to " live with" it.<br />
There are,' of course, many arguments against that view<br />
and it is not the occasion to elaborate on them here.<br />
In the context of the present conference, however, perhaps<br />
the most fundamental reason is that inflation creates such<br />
uncertainty about future real incomes that both businesses<br />
and consumers are forced to foreshorten their time horizons.<br />
In the case of businesses, uncertainty about future<br />
profitability in real terms increases risk and inhibits<br />
investment, particularly investment of a longer term nature,<br />
as well as inhibiting employment. </p>
<p>-7-<br />
This is exacerbated in circumstances where wages are able to<br />
rise faster than prices, as happened in 1974 in Australia<br />
and as tends to happen in modern industrialised countries<br />
when inflationary expectations are high.<br />
Similarly, uncertainty about the future value of their<br />
savings, and about future levels of real income, causes<br />
consumers in these circumstances to be cautious about<br />
their own spending.<br />
The net result is lower levels of aggregate spending in<br />
real terms, which means lower employment and lower living<br />
standards for evertybody; even more important in the longer term is<br />
the reduction in future growth potential resulting from<br />
lower investment.<br />
In earlier times it was widely accepted that, if an<br />
economy fell into such a depressed situation, a government<br />
could initiatr a recovery by increasing its deficit<br />
through higher spending or by providing additional<br />
income to individuals or businesses in the form of tax<br />
cuts. It is surprising indeed that there are still a few in<br />
Australia who believe that such Keynesian policies will<br />
work -in circumstances where inflation continues at<br />
historically high levels.<br />
Such policies have been tried in recent years in all major<br />
countries overseas, as well as in Australia under the<br />
Labor Administration. Experience suggests that, to the extent<br />
that there is any resultant increase in activity and<br />
employment, -that this is only temporary. It is indeed now<br />
widely accepted that the main result of such<br />
policies is likely to be a worsening in inflation and more<br />
unemployment and a delay in full economic recovery.:<br />
Even the international economic organisations, such as<br />
the International Monetary Fund and the OECD, which were<br />
for so long enamoured of such ideas, have in recent years<br />
increasingly pushed them to the bottom of the list.<br />
If that is so, it may be asked, why do not all governments<br />
adopt economic policies that would eradicate inflation<br />
The frank answer to that, I suppose, has to be the electoral<br />
timetable. Very severe measures of restraint would be<br />
needed to reduce inflation quickly, and to root out<br />
inflationary expectations, and it would be difficult to<br />
accomplish that and effect a substantial recovery in<br />
activity and employment within the normal life of<br />
most governments. / 8 </p>
<p>-8-<br />
It may be that, with a five year electoral cycle,<br />
Mrs. Thatcher's Government's task will be easier<br />
I certainly hope so, and wish he ' r well, though in the difficult<br />
economic circumstances in which her Government camne to<br />
office, it may be remarkable indeed if a significant<br />
turnaround in real growth can be achieved in the U. K.<br />
in much less than the fi-ve years allotted the Government in that country<br />
Whatever approach is adopted, it is important to recognise<br />
that the pursuit of anti-inflationary policies has the<br />
interests of the unemployed very much at heart. It is<br />
only by controlling inflation that there can be a sustained<br />
increase in the pace of economic activity, a sustained lift<br />
in the provision of jobs, and in due course a sustained<br />
reduction in unemployment.<br />
It is true that, in the meantime, those are are unemployed<br />
suffer : but, while that is to. be-. greatly regretted, the<br />
alternative p licies proposed would only make the position<br />
worse. It should be noted also that the " hard core" of unemployed<br />
is smaller than is commonly supposed. It is not widely<br />
appreciated, for instance, that of those unemployed each<br />
month around 20 per cent on average find employment during<br />
the following month.<br />
The Government naturally wishes that more progress had<br />
been made over the last five years, both in relation to<br />
economic recovery generally and the unemployment problem<br />
in particular.<br />
But in which other countries has the unemployment problem<br />
been overcome, or even significantly reduced, notwithstanding<br />
that significant resort has been had in most overseas<br />
countries to job creation schemes of one sort or another<br />
Which other contries experienced the same disruptions<br />
and imbalances that occurred in Australia under the<br />
Labor administration.<br />
The facts are that in Australia unemployment has been stabl. e<br />
now for about two years whereas it has been rising in many<br />
overseas OECD countries; and in Australia there has been<br />
a significant strengthening in economic activity ( which<br />
is continuing) whereas in the OECD area as a whole there<br />
has recently been little growth and there is little<br />
prospect of much improvement in that situation in the<br />
near future.<br />
The Government believes, therefore, that the persistent<br />
application of anti-inflationary policies is now starting<br />
to bear fruit in Australia and that it holds out the only<br />
real hope of producing the investment spending needed to<br />
raise productivity and hence living standards, and to<br />
reduce unemployment. The Government acknowledges that<br />
anti-inflationary policies will not be sufficient on their<br />
own either to cope with unemployment or the ' employmeit<br />
requirements of businesses. </p>
<p>-9-<br />
But we reject the idea that the unemployment problem can be<br />
handled through make work schemes, which have failed overseas<br />
and which fall into the fatal error of treating symptoms rather<br />
than underlying cause.<br />
There should be scope, on the other hand, to ease the unemployment<br />
situation and to help meet the increasing demand for skilled and<br />
semi-skilled labour through improved training, particularly of<br />
young people. The Government is helping in various ways but<br />
State governments, businesses and individuals themselves.,<br />
also have important responsibilities in this area.<br />
We recognise, of course, that an adequate supply of the right<br />
type of labour is not just a inatter of training, We will be<br />
looking also over the next year or so as resource investmhent<br />
gathers pace, to skilled and semi-skilled labour from over Iseas<br />
countries. There will moreover, be a need for greater flexibility in wage<br />
rates than is provided under the present wage determination<br />
system in order to restore into the wage structure the incentive<br />
needed to bring forward an increasing supply of skilled labour.<br />
Regrettably, the st'ructure of wage rates which the wage tribunals<br />
have put in place ip, 7not only contributing importantly to shortages<br />
of skilled labour but is deterring the employment of particular<br />
labour categories, notably the unskilled and the young, and is<br />
thus an important factor in the continuing high level of<br />
unemployment.<br />
While we accept that unemployment remains a problem, it is important<br />
not-to overlook the benefits that-have flowed from the Government's<br />
anti-inflationary policies. The most obvious benefit to be seen<br />
flows front the improvement in Australia's international<br />
competitiveness.<br />
As a result Australian industry is now much better placed to compete<br />
with imports and is in fact producing increasing exports not only<br />
from our resource based industries but from a very wide -range of renufacturing<br />
industries. Over the last-two years, exports of manufacturers<br />
are estimated to have increased in real terms by no less than 23 per<br />
cent, showing quite clearly that Australian manufacturing industry<br />
is well able to compete successfully against international<br />
competition when economic circumstances allow.<br />
But the benefits flowing from anti-inflation policies have not,<br />
of course, been limited to the restoration of international<br />
competitiveness. There has also been an improvement in business<br />
profitability which is, in turn, now being reflected in an<br />
upsurge in domestic and foreign investment as well as in higher<br />
enmployment. Over -the last year, indeed, total employment has risen by more<br />
than 3 per cent, and no less than 200,000 additional jobs have<br />
appeared in the economy. If the participation rate of those over<br />
wanting to be in the workforce had not increased unemployment would,<br />
in fact, have fallen by around 100,000 over . the last 12 months. There<br />
are, moreover, good prospects for a continuing rise in employment. </p>
<p>In short, anti-inflationary policies are creating jobs.<br />
As they do that, they will also begin to the extent that the<br />
structure of wage rates allows to reduce unemployment also.<br />
There are also indications that, with the faster growth in<br />
employment and an improvement in consumer confidence, growth in<br />
consumption expenditure could now be moving on to a somewhat<br />
faster track.<br />
In short, even despite the effects of drought, there is a good<br />
prospect that 1980-1 could be the third year in a row to see a<br />
faster increase in the pace of domestic activityin Australia. pat~ qaa.. ly,<br />
at a time when there is expected to be little or no growth in the<br />
OECD areas as a whole that is, surely, an indication of the<br />
benefits of anti-inflationary policies.<br />
A key element in our policies has been the exercise of restraint<br />
on public sector spending, and on public sector calls on financial<br />
markets exercised through the Commonwealth Budget. Since 1975-6,<br />
Commonwealth Budget outlays have been reduced from about 30 per<br />
cent of GDP to about 28 per cent and the budget deficit from<br />
nearly 5 to just over 1 per cent of GDP. These are significant<br />
achievements. We would have liked t6have made faster: progress but were constrained<br />
from doing so by the sort of considerations that I have already -mentioned. it,<br />
is our firm objedtive to continue along this road and we are<br />
conscious that, as the private sector of the economy picks up,<br />
the need to do so is actually increasing, not diminishing.<br />
For one thing, with the strengthening in private sector activity<br />
more room will need to be made by containing and, where possible,<br />
reducing public sector demands on resources. That is why, at the<br />
last Loan Council meeting, we agreed with the States on the need<br />
for government infrastructure expenditure to proceed in an orderly<br />
and carefully integrated manner, to make sure particularly that<br />
resources of skilled labour and the capital market are not<br />
subjected to demands that would add to the inflationary pressures.<br />
As I have indicated, we will also be working to further contain<br />
public sector demands through containing the size of the Commonwealth<br />
Budget. Apart from the growing need for this in terms of avoiding<br />
strains on the economy, it will be an important objective of the<br />
Government to minimise burden of taxation. This can only be<br />
undertaken responsibly however, if it is accompanied by restraint, a<br />
reduction in Government expenditure.<br />
But we recognise that there is an increasing demand for greater<br />
freedom of choice in the spending by taxpayers of their own<br />
incomes and we believe that the significant improvements in<br />
incentive that would flow from a reduced burden of personal income<br />
taxation in particular would considerably strengthen the economy, so 1on<br />
as this could be achieved without prejudice to other iinportayit economnic objectives4<br />
For the present, however, the primary task ahead is to contain<br />
the inflationary pressures that have emerged over the past year or<br />
so, and to bring our inflation rate once againc firmly back onto<br />
a downward trend and the last quarterly figure offers some<br />
encouragement to that objective. </p>
<p>That will-, call, however, for firm fiscal and monetary policies<br />
with as I indicated in the Budget Debate monetary policy<br />
playing an enhanced role.<br />
We will be aiming, as was indicated in the Budget, to secure a<br />
significant reduction in the growth in the money supply during<br />
this financial year. That, we believe, is essential if the present<br />
favourable environment for investment is to be sustained.<br />
There is no doubt that such a reduction can be achieved without<br />
endangering the strengthening recovery in private sector activity;<br />
sufficient finance will be available to permit growth in line with<br />
Budget forecasts. The containment of inflationary pressures will<br />
also require a slowdown in the rate of wage increases.<br />
This is something to which everyone must contribute governments,<br />
businesses, arbitral authorities and, not least, trade union<br />
leaders and the trade union movement itself. It is surely time<br />
that unions started to recognise that wage increases in excess of<br />
productivity increases are not in the longer term interests of<br />
their own members andO can only make it more difficult to reduce<br />
unemployment. This is true whatever the form of a wage increase but it would<br />
be Particularly true of the irresponsible claim for a 35 hour week,<br />
given the very large addition to costs the granting of that claim<br />
would involve.<br />
We will be looking to the arbitral authorities to assess all wage<br />
claims in the light of the Government's economic policies and the<br />
need to reduce inflation. Australia has entered a decade which<br />
has the potential to see economic development unparallelled in<br />
Australia's history.<br />
That potential will however only be realised if a favourable<br />
environment for investment is maintained. The Government believes<br />
that will require the continued and persistent application of firm<br />
anti-inflationary policies and the pursuit of policies that ensure<br />
that the fruits of economic development are equitably and<br />
properly shared among all Australians. 000---<br />
