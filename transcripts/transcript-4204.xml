STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER ON FOREIGN INVESTMENT IN<br />
AUSTRALIA, AT THE BROOK CLUB, NEW YORK 29 JULY 1976<br />
The Prime Minister said tonight in New York that<br />
his discussions here had indicated a strong endorsement by<br />
leading American financiers and businessmen of Australia's<br />
policy of seeking local equity participation in foreign<br />
investment where possible. He said that there had been no<br />
questioning of the Government's approach in this area.<br />

Mr Fraser said that he had explained that the<br />
Australian Government welcomed overseas investment. The<br />
Government saw an important and increased role for foreign<br />
capital in the development of Australia's resources. Its<br />
attitude was significantly different, in this respect, to<br />
that of the preceding Government.<br />
The Prime Minister said that he had confirmed that<br />
major development projects would not be held up solely on<br />
the ground that Australian equity was unavailable to meet<br />
a particular proportion of total capital. The foreign<br />
investment guidelines providing for Australian equity<br />
participation were being administered flexibly.<br />
These guidelines were being applied in the interests<br />
of theoverall development of the Australian economy. It was<br />
unrealistic to suppose that development of major resource<br />
projects could proceed without the injection of significant<br />
foreign capital. The Prime Minister said that he had outlined recent<br />
measures taken by the Government to restore balance in the<br />
Australian economy and, most importantly, to reduce inflation.<br />
There was still a good way to go: but the Government was<br />
determined to bring inflation under control and to restore<br />
business confidence. The Prime Minister said that he had<br />
indicated his firm conviction that the forthcoming budget<br />
would play an important role here.<br />
The Prime Minister said that his discussions in the<br />
United States suggested an increased flow of American capital<br />
to Australia. Investors were realising the need for early<br />
decisions to be taken to meet looming supply problems. The<br />
strengthening world economic recovery suggested the possibility<br />
of early constraints on capacity to meet resource needs.<br />
As a resource rich country, Australia, the Prime<br />
Minister said, was in a position to take advantage of the<br />
potential increase in investment needs. The Government's<br />
policy was clear. It was now up to foreign investors to take<br />
advantage of the opportunities that offered. </p>
