FOR MEDIA 12 NOVEMBER 1991<br />
I regret that the Premiers have cancelled the Special<br />
Premiers' Conference.<br />
Not only are they declining to discuss ongoing Special<br />
Premiers' Conference issues. They are also discarding the<br />
opportunity to address with the Commonwealth at the Perth<br />
Conference, as we had agreed, fundamentally important issues<br />
such as employment which they put on the agenda and<br />
community violence and gun control.<br />
As such, they have done a disservice to the nation,<br />
themselves and their constituents.<br />
As I said earlier today the Commonwealth was not prepared to<br />
have the whole Commonwealth-State process held to ransom for<br />
a State income tax. </p>
