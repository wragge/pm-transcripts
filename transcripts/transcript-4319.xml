In respect of the Integratod Qomu~ odity. Programme it so * t out<br />
in UNCTAD Rcsolutioni 93 the two Prime Ministers<br />
agreed that decisions on particular'aspccts of the programme<br />
cou. only be made in the light of necelsary studies an~ d<br />
detaiae c xaminationa. Both' ( overnrnrtts were prepared lo<br />
p. irticipat' in such studies and examinations. The two<br />
Primec"' i1n~ sters weclcomed Papua New Guinea's forthcoming<br />
acces~ ion to the Lome Convention as a demonstration of'<br />
practical cooperation between developed and developing, countries.<br />
The two Prime Mini'pSters -ffirmed that their respective<br />
countrieS, as active participants, were fully committed to working<br />
for a successful outcome of the United Nations Law of thc Sea<br />
ConFe-rence. They agreed that the Confcrence, having made loss<br />
progress thar. had been hoped during 1970, deserved a<br />
determined effort to reach a conclusion, from all participants<br />
at its ne.: t session in May.* They noted that both count~ ries<br />
shared Tiany common aims in the development of this important field<br />
of int erntaional law, and expressed confidence that those<br />
delo ments would provide new opportunities for regional and<br />
bil]: It07al coop -rat ion.<br />
Bil~ itcral Matters<br />
The tw. o Prime . insterresv iewed the broad range of bilateral<br />
relations between Papua New Guinea arid Australia. They were<br />
oleased to note tlIe progress made-in nc-otiating arrangements<br />
on a number of iriportar't bilateral matters since thei r<br />
discussion in March, 1976..<br />
T'he t,. wo Prime Minigters noted with considerable satisfaction<br />

Thc t;. o Pri-;' Yinisters expressedl pluasure that the two<br />
Govcrnrnnt, h~ ad reached2 agc-eeet on air services between<br />
AuISt-rilia anid iPama New Guinea, w-, hich accorded Papua w<br />
Gi"_' s r. ati onal fla,-carrier, Air Niugini, traffic rights<br />

caIerc-, Qantas nad been gyranated *-ights to and from Port<br />

' rheo Pr : 7 &gt; Iini sters noted that the new aid arrange-nents<br />
in C. u'r4 ~ iveI -co iz ayrece, at their<br />
~ i~ rch 1~ ad bcen ' introduced with effcct froma<br />

<p>Mr Somare reaffirl-nod that the untied grant aid Provided<br />
b-tle Aistralian Government was much appreciated by his<br />
~ Governm~ ej't. H4 stressed tha , t it was the most -suitablc<br />
form of aid because it permitt a. Papua. New Guinea-' to plan~ and<br />
imnplemenft its own-development piorities,<br />
Thie two Prime Ministers noted that Papua New Guinea-would<br />
change-to a calendiar fiscal year from 1 January 1978.<br />
They a~ greed that officials should meet early in the second<br />
ha of 1977. to discuss the leve'l of supplementation, above<br />
th aicmnrn~ fAl80 million already agreed upon, in the<br />
t hi-rd year of the iÃ± ve-year period.<br />
MrSomare expresse; d hiis appreciation of thc reserves standby<br />
facility providedO ior Paptia New Guine: a by the Australian<br />
Reserve s1ank It~ A: pril 1976. He -requested that this<br />
facility continiue to be mnade available beyond the currently<br />
agreed date of termn." nation, 31 Dccub-er 1977, to correspond<br />
with the term ofz the present aid agreement. Mr Fraser took<br />
note of this req-ucst.<br />
The two Prime Min~ sters recalled their agreement in March, 1976<br />
that it was importa., nt to reach an equitable and permanent<br />
settlement on all issues relating to Torres Strait. They noted<br />
that their tvwo Foreign Ministers, acting with Cabinet<br />
authority, had acccrdlingly entered into negotiations in<br />
May 1976. . The Foreign Ministlers announced in June that they<br />
had reached agree-ment on a number of points basic to a<br />
settlement. In subsequent months, much further progress had<br />
been madec, notably, provisional. agreement had been reached<br />
on the location oiF a seabed bounda-ry running some 1,200 ini: les<br />
from the Arafura Sea, through the Torres Strait and out th-rough<br />
the Coyzl Sea.<br />
The two Prime Mn. sesalso notec! that, despite the considerable<br />
j'oges~ alrady c~; eveI, here were som7-e ises on which<br />
agreemenit had not been-r reached. T1he two Prim,, e Ministers<br />
and their iisrilcollcea. gues said tha-L their two Gover-Iments<br />
werde1o1t : nc1 CCrioacdf dnt that -hese issues could and aou-d<br />
be reso&gt; Tekrd throu a continued procoss of bilateral<br />
necotiations. ' I ie y also a:-rced tain the imeantirme, these<br />
materswoud 1nut be allowe,, d to aff'ect the close and warm<br />
relatiors existingc, between their two countries.<br />
Mr Somare expl ained that, in view of the need for Papua Now<br />
Guinea, as an independent country, to adopt its own limits of<br />
national. sea and seabed Jurisdiction, his Govern-ment had<br />
consideredi zkt necessary to secure the passage through Parliament<br />
of cnablin~ g " n~ o'. seas" lcilto. His Government<br />
felt sr rnvin impler.-inting this Lgilation with a<br />
vie-, to no:!: ions with third countries on jurisdiction and<br />
There is ,.,-. standing between the two Governments that,<br />

d1clicato issues ipvolvce ' and that, accordingly; they, dlid not<br />
uwish tou se t a t ine Ilimi..: for the * co-laplction. of the* negotiations.<br />
The t4wo Prime Ministers noted with satisfaction that,<br />
