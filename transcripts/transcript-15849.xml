    <content><![CDATA[<p>Australia and the United Kingdom today announced an enhanced partnership to tackle the causes and impact of climate change.</p>
<p>The new climate change partnership is aimed at building a global low carbon economy and bolstering effective adaptation measures to the combat increasing greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
<p>Features of the new climate change partnership include:</p>
<p>     * Australia joining the UK as a member of the International Carbon Action Partnership - an association of governments working together on emissions trading.</p>
<p>     * The governments of Australia and the UK working collaboratively on technological solutions to climate change in particular energy efficiency and carbon capture and storage.</p>
<p>     * Heightened cooperation between UK and Australian climate scientists.</p>
<p>Building a global low carbon economy will provide new jobs, new industries and new growth for the future.</p>
<p>This will require an ambitious long term global target, supported by carbon markets that help drive investment in clean technologies.</p>
<p>For Australia, finding a technological solution to carbon emissions from coal-fired power stations is critical.</p>
<p>That's why Australia will work with the UK, the US, China and countries like Norway on translating this technology into an effective commercial reality.</p>
<p>In the lead-up to Copenhagen, the UK and Australia will become active partners in working towards a global consensus on climate change.</p>
