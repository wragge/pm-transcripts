PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING, MP<br />
ERINA FAIR, CENTRAL COAST, NSW<br />
WEDNESDAY 15 AUGUST, 1994<br />
J: today's cash rate rise, is it the last for this year?<br />
PM: I think the main thing is the Government wants to see the recovery<br />
remain sustainable. And, that means that we want to be able to<br />
maintain low inflation and the way to do that is to keep a watchful eye<br />
on inflationary pressures. And, I think, the fact that this is happening<br />
around the world, in the United States, in Australia, is a very good<br />
thing for a prolonged recovery, more jobs and lower inflation.<br />
J: So, do home owners need to batten down the hatches?<br />
PM: I don't think so. I think that some of this may flow through to housing<br />
some, some. But, I think there is a very competitive housing market<br />
now. The chance of all this three quarters of a point going to<br />
housing rates, is pretty slim.<br />
J: What's this going to do to business investment and employment<br />
growth?<br />
PM: Well, I think it will encourage the investing community to believe<br />
inflation is truly in check, in Australia; that we'll maintain our<br />
competitiveness; and, if anything, I think it will just encourage people<br />
to believe the recovery will be longer.<br />
J: With the economy growing faster than government forecasts, can we<br />
expect another government financial statement later in the year?<br />
PM: No, the Government brought a Budget down in May and the economy<br />
is growing in the sort of, general, region of the Budget forecasts. But,<br />
I'm happy to say that we're the fastest growing economy in the<br />
Western World. The main thing is, though, we want low inflationary<br />
growth and that's what today's decision is about. </p>
<p>2<br />
J: Won't the rise in interest rates take some of the steam out of that<br />
growth?<br />
PM: No, because I think the profit share in the economy is so high, the<br />
strength that underlies the business community now, for investment...<br />
Remember this, we've had a recovery now for a couple of years I<br />
think, for about ten or twelve quarters and yet the investment phase<br />
is just coming. So, we've got all of that to enjoy.<br />
J: But, there's pressure now on the Accord, won't that also create...?<br />
PM: I don't think so. There's not a lot of pressure around the wage market<br />
at the moment, we've just not long ago done a deal with the ACTU for<br />
the bottom end of the workforce two lots of eight dollars. So, at the<br />
moment the Australian economy is ticking over, in terms of wages and<br />
inflation, very nicely. And, of course, most particularly with growth and<br />
jobs employment. That employment growth we saw a week or so<br />
ago 90,000 for the month and unemployment falling half a<br />
percentage point is indicative, I think, of our capacity to maintain<br />
reasonably strong employment levels.<br />
J: Prime Minister, is Mr Hawke's book receiving the attention it deserves?<br />
PM: Well, I said something about that yesterday and that is all I want to<br />
say.<br />
ends. </p>
