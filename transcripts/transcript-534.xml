TEXT OF VHITE HOUSE RELEASE 3Y<br />
THE RIGHT HOiOURIJALE-. K: 7mTZI rEi IhISTITER OF AUSTRALIA<br />
A-i3 + PSIDENT KENNEDY<br />
The White House today made public the following joint<br />
communique after meetings between the President and the Right<br />
Honourable Robert Gordon Menzies, Prime Minister of Australia.<br />
The President and the Prime Minister expressed<br />
gratification at the opportunity presented by the Prime<br />
Minister's visit for furthering their personal as well as<br />
official friendship symbolizing the cordiality of relations<br />
between the American and Australian people.<br />
The President and the Prime Minister discussed the<br />
question of peace in South East Asia. The President noted with<br />
satisfaction Australia's active interest in supporting -the<br />
struggle of the Government of Vietnam against subversion and<br />
aggression organized and directed from abroad. Both leaders<br />
looked forward to the effective realization of the Geneva<br />
Accords assuring the independence and neutrality of Laos.<br />
The President and the Prime Minister agreed that a<br />
peaceful solution of the West New Guinea dispute would be in<br />
the best interests of all concerned, and they recognized that<br />
the efforts of the Acting Secretary-General of the United<br />
Nltions,, U Thant, and his representative, Ambassador Ellsworth<br />
Bunker, had provided the atmosphere for the achievement of a<br />
significant contribution to the cause of peaceful settlement<br />
of international disputes.<br />
Both the Pr~ sil* ent and the Prime Ministor agreed on the<br />
desirability of maintaining the excellent record of Australian-<br />
American security consultation and co-ordination through the<br />
A. N. Z. U. S. and S. E. A. T. O. treaties.<br />
President Kennedy expressed his strong belief in the<br />
importance of the Commonwealth as a source of stability and </p>
<p>strength for the free world. At the same time both leaders<br />
recognized that European unity could contribute substantially<br />
to the strength of the free world.<br />
They reviewed therefore the implications for the trade<br />
of their two nations of the cossible accession of the United<br />
Kingdom to the European Economic Community.<br />
It was agreed that, in this event, the United States and<br />
Australia would, as great suppliers to Eritain and Europe, face<br />
problems in endeavouring to maintain and expand access for their<br />
goods. The Prime Minister offered the view that it would be a<br />
grave misfortune if, after the negotiations, it turned out that<br />
the conditions laid down for Britain's entry were unacceptable<br />
to Commonwealth countries on the ground that they damaged<br />
Commonwealth trade and expansion.<br />
The President and Prime Minister took note of the fact<br />
that with respect to certain articles and commodities<br />
Australia's historic terms of access are different from those<br />
of the United States. They recognized, however, that Australia<br />
competed with the United States in the United Kingdom market<br />
with respect to only a relatively small number of these items,<br />
though the items themselves are by no means small in importance.<br />
They agreed that, with respect to these items, technical<br />
discussions would be held between the two Governments in an<br />
effort to reconcile the trading interests of both nations.<br />
With respect to the great bulk of articles and commodities<br />
they noted that, as non-mombers of the European Economic Community,<br />
their countries faced essentially the same problems, and they<br />
jcined in hoping that the community would pursue liberal trading<br />
pclicies. President Kennedy pointed out that under the trade<br />
expansion legislation now pending before the Congress the<br />
/ 0A </p>
<p>United States Government should strive, through reciprocal<br />
agreements, to bring about a general reduction of trade<br />
barriers for the benefit of all. Moreover, both leaders<br />
agreed that, with respect to a number of key primary products,<br />
the problems raised by the expansion of the Common Market<br />
might best be solved through international arrangements.<br />
During the course of their interviews the President<br />
expressed his warm interest in Australia and his understanding<br />
of Australiats needs in terms of development and growth,<br />
recognizing the problems of particular regions as well as<br />
industries Both he and the Prime Minister were agreed that the<br />
problems for the United States and Australia arising out of<br />
Britain's proposed entry should be approached not on any<br />
basis of theory or the use of particular words but upon a<br />
practical basis, examining, commodities one by one, having<br />
in mind the protection of the interests of both countries.<br />
As a result of their discussions the President and<br />
the Prime Minister were encouraged to believe that satisfactory<br />
solutions will be found to those problems faced by their two<br />
countries, Canberra. 3.30 a. m. Juno 21. 1962. </p>
