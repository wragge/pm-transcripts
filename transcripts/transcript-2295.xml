EMBARGO: 7. 30p. mn. Mond ,_ 28_ September 1970<br />
" THIS DAY TONIGHT"<br />
Television interview given by the Prime<br />
Minister, Mr. John Gorton on ABC TV Network 28 SEPTEMBER ! 970<br />
Lnterviewer Gerald Stone<br />
Q. Mr. Gorton, I'm sure you'll agree that there is considerable difference<br />
between legitimate criticism of a political opponent and attempts to smear him<br />
through exaggeration arid innuendo. In that light, I wonder how you would<br />
describe your Government's recent attacks on Mr Whitlam?<br />
PM Well I understand Mr Whitlam claims that he has been smeared, and if<br />
that is ao, it is the first occasion on which I can ever remember when a man<br />
has put out a statement in his own name and then claimed that that statement<br />
srr ars him.<br />
Q. We'll get back to that statement in a second. What was the purpoce of the<br />
allegation that Mr Whitlam in addressing the September 19 Moratorium stood<br />
under a Viet Cong flag7<br />
PM He stood facing a crowd in which a number of flags were flying Viet<br />
Cong flags, other flags associated with the Viet Cong, a defaced Australian flag<br />
and Australian flags as well and that was seen, of course, by scores of people<br />
from Parliament House. There can be no question but that that was in fact so.<br />
Q. But you would agree there is an emotive difference at least between standi: g<br />
somewhere in the proximity of a Viet Cong flag in a large group and standing u:-cer<br />
a Viet Cong flag?<br />
PM I think there is a difference between standing holding a banner or having it<br />
directly over your head as you speak, but on the other hand, I don't think itmyoelf,<br />
very different from addressing a mob, a crowd I don't use the word " mob" in a<br />
derogatory way from addressing a crowd flying Viet Cong flags when one's own<br />
troops are engaged in action against troops fighting under those flags.<br />
Q. Well can I ask you was the purpose of making this statement " under a 21ag"<br />
was it to identify Mr Whitlam with the most irresponsible elements in tie anti-<br />
Vietnam campaign?<br />
PM It was to make a perfectly straightforward statement that he was prepared<br />
to go and talk to these people who were flying the flags of our enemies. But that<br />
is not an issue of significance compared to the call for soldiers to disobey orders<br />
which he has made in his statement that you were going to come back to. e ; 2 </p>
<p>Q. Right. Again we will come bac.,. to it, but just one last point on this. Is it<br />
a fact that you requested the Australian News and Information Bureau to cover that<br />
Moratorium Rally with the express purpose of trying to get a picture of Mr Whitlam<br />
in relation to a Viet Gong flag?<br />
PM No, I asked the Australian News and Information Bureau or sent a messae<br />
to them to cover the Moratorium because after all there are a lot of pictures tak-en<br />
from a lot of different sources at these kinds of gatherings and they tend to be<br />
brought forward later as evidence of police brutality or something of that kind, and<br />
I think it's not a bad thing to have official records of what in fact goes on. at thema.<br />
Q. Well then you consider News and Information Bureau to be a fit source to be<br />
taking this type of picture,'<br />
PM Yes, certainly.<br />
Q. Now, on this question of Mr Whitlam's statement about the Army. You have<br />
said he has made a call to mutiny. Mr McEwen used the word " treachery" in<br />
describing this action. If you really believe that, do you think Mr Whitla-i is a -fit<br />
person to sit in Federal Parliament?<br />
PM This is what makes it so significant, I think, so nationally significant that am<br />
man with a responsibility, the responsible post of Leader of the Opposition, Should<br />
call he doesn't like the word " mutiny" that he should advise young men to ' Cin<br />
the Army and disobey the orders to go to Vietnam. He claims that's not mutiny,<br />
He can argue that out with the dictionary, but I think a dictionary definition will<br />
indicate that it could be covered by that. For myself, over the weekend, I am<br />
quite happy if he doesn't like that word to just Cay that it is just as bad to<br />
give advice to young men to join the Army and then to disobey orders.<br />
Q. Would you agree there is a difference, though? You have been using the<br />
word " call and urge young men to violate orders". Mr Whitlam insists he did not<br />
say he urges anybody to violate orders. He simply says if they feel they must in<br />
some way avoid service in Vietnam, the best way, if they don't qualify as<br />
conscientious objectors is to join the Army and to refuse orders to serve in<br />
Vietnam.<br />
PM He advises them. They are his own words. He advises them to join the<br />
Army and then to disobey orders--. And if you read the transcript of his press<br />
statement, he makes it perfectly, explicitly clear in the sentence and I quote<br />
from memory but I thin".. it's accurate " if they get the order to go, when they<br />
do, they should disobey". Well, I'm sorry, what's your pointt That, surely,<br />
is saying what should halopen. 0 3 </p>
<p>3.<br />
Q. But there is a difference between urging somebody to do something and simply<br />
telling them that. if -he feels he must violate orders that perhaps that's the way<br />
he should do<br />
PM I think yu are drawing a sort of hairline aren't you here? Here is a Leader<br />
of the Opposition, a young man going to him and saying, " I don't mind bearing<br />
arms but I don't want to fight in Vietnam" and he says to that young man, " All<br />
right. You don't mind bearing arms, then join the CMF and you won't have to go<br />
to Vietnam". But he doesn't say that.<br />
Q. Well, I want to raise this question of the CMF, You said if a young man : rally<br />
wanted to avoid service in Vietnam, he could join the CMF. Now isn't this being<br />
rather destructive to the CMF, to load it up with young men who in time of war<br />
might not want to serve overseas?<br />
PM You are talking about time of war. I am talking about a young man who<br />
would be a National Serviceman and who could be called up and who could be<br />
se.. t to Vietnam and who feels he has a genuine conscientious objection to going<br />
to Vietnam. In that case, he has the full opportunity of taking a legal course o;<br />
joining the CMF and not being subject to that liability. Now surely that would<br />
be the advice to give and where the advice should stop.<br />
Q. But if we are to treat the CMF as a serious organisation......<br />
PM Now you are trying to talk about the CMF, I'm afraid, instead of the real<br />
central point the advice g; ven was to join the Army and then to refuse to obey<br />
orders, and the results of that can only these can be the only results that<br />
you would make it impossible for an Army containing an element of National<br />
Servicemen to be able to be used. People could say " I don't want to go to<br />
Vietnam". Other people could say, " I don't want to go to Malaysia". You<br />
wouldn't know where you were. It lays the young man himself open to very<br />
serious penalties and it is an advice, advice to disobey the law when the young<br />
man can obtain the objectives without disobeying the law.<br />
Q. Now you say this would make National Service unworkable, and yet<br />
Mr Snedden and the Government has said only a very minute fraction of young<br />
men eligible for call-up have tried to evade call-up. So how many men do you<br />
think would actually try to refuse.....<br />
PM CK. Net very many because 99 per cent or 99. 8 per cent, I think it is,<br />
of young mt go into the Army when they are called up and accept their obligations.<br />
But if this advice that is offered by the Leader of the Cpposition, which he says<br />
hundreds of young men would want to take, if this advice is to be offered by him<br />
and accepted by an increasing number of young men, then this would be the end<br />
result. </p>
<p>Q. Mr. Gorton-I -thipk you have acknowledged in the past that the anti-war<br />
movement, in this country has many moderate and responsible followerc. Nov'<br />
isn't there a danger that by making extreme or distorted remarks about come<br />
of these moderate followers that you might tend to drive them to an extreme<br />
position and tend to further develop splits in the country......<br />
PM I haven't made any extreme or immoderate remarks about the moderate<br />
elements nor about thos e who are anti-war, nor about those who seek by legal<br />
methods to change the law as it stands. I am concerned only with the man in<br />
the position of the Leader of the Opposition urging that the law as it stands, after<br />
an election in which National Service and continuation in Vietnam were key<br />
points, that a man in the position of the Leader of the Cpposition after that<br />
should advise a breach of the law.<br />
Q. Well, finally, and after all is said and done, Mr Gorton, do you consider<br />
S" r Whitlam to be a loyal patriotic Australian with the good of his country at<br />
heart?<br />
PM I think that the advice that he is giving to young men and according<br />
to his own statement not mine is unpatriotic.<br />
Q. Thank you, Mr Gorton. </p>
