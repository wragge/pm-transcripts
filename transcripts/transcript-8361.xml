PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 3 DECEMBER 1991<br />
JOINT STATEMENT WITH THE HON ROS KELLY, MINISTER FOR ARTS,<br />
SPORT, THE ENVIRONMENT, TOURISM TERRITORIES<br />
The Federal Government will provide $ 25 million towards the<br />
cost of staging the 1998 Conunonwealth Games if Adelaide's<br />
bid to host the Games is successful.<br />
Adelaide is making a very strong bid for the Games and<br />
deserves Federal Government support to help meet the<br />
substantial cost of staging a modern international sporting<br />
event. The Government's decision is consistent with similar<br />
arrangements made for the Melbourne and Sydney Olympic Games<br />
bids. Adelaide has a very strong bid which has been the result of<br />
hard work by a number of dedicated people and I'm pleased to<br />
be in a position to back that hard work with the offer of<br />
major financial help.<br />
The decision to provide $ 25 million reflects the<br />
Goverrnent's commitment to sport generally and to the<br />
Adelaide bid in particular.<br />
We are all hoping for succe~ ss at the Olympics in Barcelona<br />
next year, not only for our athletes but for the<br />
Commonwealth Games bid team which will be working to secure<br />
the Games for Adelaide. 13551 </p>
