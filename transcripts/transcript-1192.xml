    <content><![CDATA[<p>COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA<br />SPEECHI BY<br />The Rt. Hon. SIR ROBERT MENZIES,<br />M. P.,<br />ON<br />CONSTITUTION ALTERATION ( PARLIAMENT)<br />BILL 1965<br />AND<br />CONSTITUTION ALTERATION ( REPEAL OF<br />SECTION 127) BILL 1965<br />[ From the Parliamentary Debates I11th November 1965]<br />CONSTITUTION ALTERATION<br />( PARLIAMENT) BILL 1965.<br />Bill presented by Sir Robert Menzies,<br />and read a first time.<br />Second Reading.<br />Sir ROBERT MENZIES ( Kooyong-<br />Prime Minister) [ 8.01.-I move--<br />That the Bill be now read a second time.<br />This is a Bil of immense importance but<br />of not great complexity in itself. It is<br />designed to break the nexus-a term<br />which we have all come to understandcreated<br />by section 24 of the Commonwealth<br />Constitution. Section 24 statesand<br />I want -to state this matter with all<br />14410/ 65 possible clearness because I think that<br />is vital to an understanding of it-<br />The House of Representatives shall be composed<br />of members directly chosen by the people<br />of the Commonwealth, and the number of such<br />members shalt be, as nearly as practicable, twice<br />the number of the senators.<br />The phrase as nearly as practicable, twice<br />the number of the senators is something<br />that has to be borne in mind in the<br />whole parliamentary and public consideration<br />of this matter. I do not undertake to<br />be dogmatic as to what is meant by the<br />phrase as nearly as practicable because,<br />after all, if there are 60 senators<br />it is quite practicable to have 120 members<br />of this House, yet we have 122 plus<br />2 who do not have a general vote. But</p>
<p>it is quite clear that as nearly as<br />practicable imposes genuine limits, however<br />they may be defined, on the number<br />of people in this House.<br />What are the facts? In 1949, following<br />the increase in 1948 of the House of<br />Representatives from 74 to 121 members<br />with full voting rights and of the<br />Senate from 36 to 60 senators, each<br />member of this House represented,<br />on the average, 66,000 people. Today,<br />such is the growth of -the population that<br />each member, on the average, represents<br />not 66,000 people but 94,000 people.<br />Without a constitutional change, how far<br />can we increase the ' number of members<br />of this House, increasing the numbers to<br />do justice and to give effective representation<br />to the people of Australia, who have<br />now reached I1If million and who could<br />easily become 15 million, 18 million or<br />million in due course? Without a<br />constitutional change how far can we increase<br />the membership of this Houseby<br />two or three or four-because the<br />words of the Constitution are as nearly<br />as practicable<br />I would not care -to commit myself to the<br />proposition that we could increase the<br />number of members of this House by more<br />than two or three or, in a handsome moment,<br />four. I would not like to say that we can<br />do better than that. We cannot discuss this<br />problem, nor can our people discuss it, in<br />a practical way without bearing in mind<br />the current and now well established method<br />of electing the Senate-a method which<br />means that in a vote for five senators, as<br />at present, barring casual vacancies, one<br />side may get three and the other two, but<br />that in a vote for six senators all the chances<br />are that each political side will secure three<br />senators, however the political sides may be<br />made up. If that happened in every State we<br />would have a perpetually deadlocked Senate<br />with 30 senators on each side. An habitually<br />deadlocked Senate would mean that at any<br />stage a government chosen at a general<br />election for the House of Representatives<br />-and this is how governments are chosen<br />in our country-could be rendered impotent.<br />This would not be good for parliamentary<br />democracy and, therefore, would not ' be<br />good for the people of Australia. The practical<br />problem, therefore, is whether we<br />should continue the constitutional system under which the House of Representatives<br />should be limited in numbers to twice the<br />numbers of the Senate.<br />Having said that-because that is the vital<br />question-I start with the Senate, whose<br />functions, properly understood, I profoundly<br />respect. At present there are 60 senators-<br />10 from each State. Originally, before the<br />increase of the House of Representatives in<br />1948, there were 36 senators, three retiring<br />from each State each three years. At present<br />there are 60 senators-lO from each State<br />-and they are elected five at a time in<br />each State. So at each Senate election there<br />is a reasonable probability of one side or tf<br />other having a majority of three to M-W<br />Should the Senate be increased by one<br />senator per State-that is, to 66--each<br />Senate election under normal circumstances<br />would require the choice of one half of 11I<br />senators, that is, of five and a half senatcft<br />which, as our late lamented friend EucW<br />would have said, is absurd. The only practical<br />course under those circumstances<br />would be to choose six at one election and<br />five at another. I invite honorable members<br />who have implicated themselves in the<br />mathematics of elections to realise the confusion<br />that course could produce.<br />Suppose that the Senate were increased<br />in numbers to 72. I mention this because at<br />present you cannot increase the membership<br />of this House, whatever the population of<br />Australia may be, without increasing tl~<br />numbers in the Senate. Suppose we saW<br />that the other propositions to which I have<br />referred are not good and that we will<br />increase the numbers of the Senate to 72.<br />That would mean 12 senators from each<br />State, six to be elected at each electio<br />Under the present system for Senate elaW<br />tions-and nobody has been able to suggest<br />a better system-the election of six senators<br />from each State would almost guarantee in<br />every State the election of three Government<br />senators and three Opposition senators and<br />so we would produce a deadlocked Senate,<br />with every motion and every amendment<br />defeated. I remind honorable members that<br />section 23 of the Constitution states-<br />Questions arising in the Senate shall be determined<br />by a majority of votes, and each senator<br />shall have one vote. The President shall in all<br />cases be entitled to a vote; and when the votes<br />are equal the question shall pass in the negative.<br />I have always rather liked that phrasethe<br />question shall pass in the negative".</p>
<p>What it means is that the question will not<br />be passed at all but will be resolved in the<br />negative. That is the position in the Senate.<br />A deadlocked Senate would not be any good<br />to a government in this House, elected by<br />the people, because nobody could pass a<br />resolution and nobody could pass an amendment.<br />Therefore, if there is to be a Senate<br />in which a clear majority becomes possible,<br />the numbers of the Senate would need to<br />be such under the existing Constitution that<br />an odd number would be elected every three<br />years. Having mentioned the present odd<br />number of 5, 1 must, therefore, go on to<br />next odd number of 7. If 7 were to be<br />cted every three years there would be a<br />Senate of 84 members and under the Constitution<br />as it now stands, the House of<br />Representatives would have 168 members.<br />* Mr. Cope-A member would not have<br />leopportunity to ask a question.<br />Sir ROBERT MENZEiES.-I think the<br />honorable member would, because he always<br />asks such good questions. I wait for<br />them. But the point taken by the honorable<br />member is right. Nobody pretends for a<br />moment that we want 168 members in the<br />House of Representatives. Most people, realising<br />the duties of members of the<br />Parliament and the enormous and growing<br />population that must be represented, would<br />say: We ought to have 130 or 135 or<br />" atever it may be, but we do not want<br />1W8." I want people to understand that,<br />under the Constitution as it is now, if this<br />referendum were defeated, we could not<br />increase the number of members in this<br />,,,, ouse to fewer than 168 if at the same time<br />Wwere to increase the membership of the<br />enate to an extent that made that institution<br />workable.<br />This seems to me, and I think to all of us,<br />to be quite clear. It follows from this that,<br />as long as the present section 24 remains,<br />the membership of this House must stand<br />still or vary by perhaps only one or two,<br />unless a massive increase is made in the<br />numbers in the Senate. Therefore, this Bill<br />has one simple purpose, and I hope that the<br />people of Australia will accept it as an expression<br />of the joint judgment, wisdom and<br />opinion of this House. We propose an<br />amendment to break the nexus. Should<br />someone be a little anxious as to whether we will in an extravagant way want to<br />increase our numbers in some ballooning<br />form, we propose two matters in this<br />amendment to afford protection. First, we<br />will protect State representation in the<br />Senate. It was said to me at one stage that<br />perhaps in some States there might be a<br />fear that, with all this changing of the exist,<br />ing rules, individual States would have<br />fewer senators. We have sought to meet<br />this. We have provided in this amendment<br />that all original States, which under the<br />existing Constitution are entitled to no<br />fewer than 6 senators, will be entitled to no<br />fewer than 10 senators. In other words, we<br />protect the existing State position in the<br />Senate. Secondly, we believe-I know that my<br />friend, the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr.<br />Calwell), will agree, because I have<br />read what he has had to say-that<br />there must be a limit on the increase<br />of the membership of the House<br />of Representatives. The Bill provides that<br />the number of members of this House shall<br />be ascertained by dividing the number of<br />people of the States by such number as is<br />for the time being determined by the<br />Parliament, that number being not less than<br />80,000. In other words, the quota for<br />electorates is to be not less than 80,000. I<br />point out for the information of honorable<br />members that -if the Parliament decided that<br />the quota should be 80,000, with today's<br />population the membership of this House<br />would be 143. If the Parliament decided<br />that the quota should be 85,000-it cannot<br />be less than 80,000 but it can be morethe<br />membership of the House would be 135.<br />I give these simple statistics to illustrate<br />the real nature of the problem with which<br />we must cope. I want to emphasise to the<br />House and to the people of Australia that<br />the defeat of these proposals would inevitably<br />mean that any increase in the membership<br />of the House in future would be<br />extravagant. We would have double the<br />number of an increased Senate, as I have<br />indicated, or no increase at all. I am one<br />of the oldest inhabitants of this place. I<br />know exactly what honorable members<br />opposite are about to say and I am not<br />sure I do not agree with them. I look<br />around the House and I see my old friend,<br />the honorable member for Darling ( Mr.<br />Clark), who is a contemporary of mine in</p>
<p>this place. Going back over this time, anybody<br />who knew anything about the business<br />of the Parliament would never disagree<br />with me for one moment when I say that<br />the problems bein~ g looked at by honorable<br />members today are three or four times more<br />weighty and more complex than they were<br />when I first came into this House. I know<br />this at first hand. I am not an idler; I have<br />worked all this time and I know what it<br />means. I would think it dreadful if the<br />people were to cast a vote that permitted<br />the members of this House to represent not<br />50,000 or 60,000 but even more than the<br />120,000 represented by my colleague, the<br />Attorney-General ( Mr. Snedden), in Bruce<br />and by the honorable member for Lalor<br />( Mr. Pollard), whose presence there has<br />been so encouraging that the population<br />has risen rapidly. But it is true that we have<br />these big electorates. If in ten years' time<br />we had a situation in which every member<br />of this House represented 120,000 electors,<br />I would think that this was an outrage to<br />the effective democratic representation of<br />the people. After all, we are the Parliament<br />of the nation. We disagree amongst ourselves.<br />We may have all sorts of opinions<br />of each other. But we have the supreme<br />duty to represent our people and to represent<br />them effectively. To represent them<br />effectively, there must -be a proper proportion<br />between the number of members of this<br />House and the number of electors in the<br />nation as a whole.<br />In moving the second reading of the Bill,<br />I have not gone into any little side alleys,<br />because my experience has been that these<br />problems have to be seen at the centre.<br />They must be seen with clarity if a change<br />is to be made in the Constitution.<br />As for this one, I profoundly hope and I<br />deeply believe that when this is adequately<br />explained to the people of Australia they<br />will say Yes and they will change this<br />rule and thereby make a tremendous contribution<br />to making this Parliament an effective<br />agent of the popular will.<br />Debate ( on motion by Mr. Caiwell)<br />adjourned. CONSTITUTION ALTERATION<br />( REPEAL OF SECTION 127) BILL 1965.<br />Bill presented by Sir Robert Menzies, and<br />read a first time. Second Reading.<br />Sir ROBERT MENZIES ( Kooyong-<br />Prime Minister) move-<br />That the Bill be now read a second time.<br />The purpose of this Bill is to alter the<br />Constitution by repealing section 127. That<br />section provides that in reckoning the numbers<br />oi the people of the Commonwealth,<br />or of a State or other part of the Commonwealth,<br />Aboriginal natives shall not be<br />counted. The Government believes that the<br />first opportunity should be taken to have it<br />repealed and proposes to submit the Bill to<br />referendum at the same time as -the refer<br />dum on altering the method of determiniW<br />the number of members of the House of<br />Representatives. The Joint Committee on<br />Constitutional Review recommended repeal<br />in its report-that is the 1959 report-at<br />paragraph 398.<br />No doubt the principal reason for the<br />inclusion of section 127 in the Constitution<br />in 1900 was the practical difficulties that<br />would be encountered in satisfactorily<br />enumerating the Aboriginal population.<br />There were no doubt real difficulties then<br />in ensuring that a census of Aborigines<br />could be effectively taken. In modern times,<br />this is not so. Moreover, section 127 is not<br />related to the qualification of Aborigines<br />as voters in Commonwealth elections. Section<br />41 of the Constitution has a Iway_<br />guaranteed an Aboriginal the right to vt<br />at Commonwealth elections if he had*~<br />Tight to vote at elections for the more<br />numerous House of the Parliament of a<br />State. The Commonwealth Parliament itself<br />has removed all disabilities in respect<br />voting at Commonwealth elections so 1<br />as Aborigines are concerned. Consequently,<br />Aborigines are now entitled to enrol and<br />to vote and they should, in the view of the<br />Government, be recognised as forming part<br />of the population of their State for any<br />purpose. I think I should at this point make reference<br />to the Government's decision not to<br />put forward any amendment of section<br />51 ( xxvi.). I mention this because the Deputy<br />Leader of the Opposition ( Mr. Whitlam)<br />had a question on the notice paper about<br />it and I am now, in effect, answering that<br />question. Section 51 ( xxvi.) provides that<br />the Parliament may make laws for the peace,</p>
<p>order and good government of the Commonwealth<br />with respect to the people of any<br />race, other than the Aboriginal race in any<br />State, for whom it is deemed necessary to<br />make special laws<br />Some people wish-and indeed the wish<br />has been made clear in a number of petitions<br />presented to this House-to associate<br />with the repeal of section 127 the removal<br />of what has been called, curiously to my<br />mind, the discriminatory provisions of<br />section 51 ( xxvi.). They want-and I understand<br />their view-to eliminate the words<br />" other than the Aboriginal race in any<br />ate on the ground that these words<br />mount to discrimination against Aborigines.<br />In truth, the contrary is the fact. The words<br />are a protection against discrimination by<br />the Commonwealth Parliament in respect<br />eMoifc hA borigines. The power granted is one<br />enables the Parliament to make special<br />Mws, that is, discriminatory laws in relation<br />to other races-special laws that wo * uld<br />relate to them and not to other people.<br />The people of the Aboriginal race are<br />specifically excluded from this power. There<br />can be in relation to them no valid laws<br />which would treat them as people outside<br />the normal scope of the law, as people who<br />do not enjoy benefits and sustain burdens<br />in common with other citizens of Australia.<br />What should be aimed at, in the view of<br />the Government, is the integration of the<br />s boriginal in the general community, not<br />t state of affairs in which he would be<br />treated as being of a race apart. The mere<br />use of the words Aboriginal race is not<br />discriminatory. On the contrary, the use<br />toof mth e words indentifies the people protected<br />discrimination when it is remembered<br />hat section 51 ( xxvi) was drafted to meet<br />the conditions that existed at the end of<br />the last century-for example, the possibility<br />of having to make a special law dealing<br />with kanaka labourers. The power has, in<br />fact, never been exercised. If the words<br />were removed, as some people suggestand<br />there is quite an attractive argument<br />in favour of that-it would change dramatically<br />the scope of the plenary power conferred<br />on the Commonwealth. That must<br />be borne in mind. If the Parliament had,<br />as one of its heads of power, the power<br />to make special laws with respect to the<br />Aboriginal race, that power would very<br />likely extend to enable the Parliament to set up, for example, -a separate body of industrial,<br />social, criminal and other laws relating<br />exclusively to Aborigines. It is difficult<br />to see any limitations on the power to do<br />any of these things, because the existing<br />power is a plenary power in the Constitution.<br />Conferring such a new power could have<br />most undesirable results.<br />The Joint Committee was quite clear in<br />its recommendation that section 127 should<br />be repealed. In relation to the question that<br />I have just been discussing, namely, conferring<br />a power on the Commonwealth to<br />make laws with respect to Aborigines, the<br />Committee, at the time it ceased its deliberations<br />in 1958-and I mention this as<br />an historic fact-had, paragraph 397 of the<br />report states, given some consideration to<br />the very important question as to whether<br />the Commonwealth Parliament should have<br />an express power to make laws with respect<br />to Aborigines, and representations from<br />various quarters advocated the adoption of<br />a recommendation to this effect. The Committee<br />had, however, not completed its<br />inquiries on all the issues involved and consequently<br />no recommendation has been<br />made. I have quoted this because I do not<br />want to have it said against anyone on the<br />Committee that he has committed himself.<br />This is not true: This was left open. What<br />I have said will show that the removal of<br />the exclusion of the Aboriginal race from<br />the scope of section 51 ( xxvi), that is, to<br />include them within the power, is not the<br />simple matter it is often represented to be.<br />The inclusion would, in the view of the<br />Government, not be in the best interests<br />of the Aboriginal people.<br />Returning to the Bill before the House, the<br />matter can be simply put by saying that<br />section 127 is completely out of harmony<br />with our national attitudes and with the<br />elevation of the Aborigines into the ranks<br />of citizenship which we all wish to see.<br />To sum up, three possibilities have been<br />examined: First, to omit from section 51<br />( xxvi.), the words other than the Aboriginal<br />race in any State This would give the<br />Commonwealth Parliament power, a plenary<br />power, to make laws, unlimited except hy<br />such general provisions as those of section<br />92, with respect to Aborigines-for example,<br />industrial laws, social services laws,<br />health laws and so forth. Is this desirable?<br />I t</p>
<p>I have endeavoured to point out that we<br />do not think it is. Should not our overall<br />objective be to treat the Aboriginal as<br />on the same footing as all the rest, with<br />similar duties and similar rights? Section<br />51, placitum ( xxvi.), does not create discrimination<br />in the case of the Aboriginal.<br />It avoids it. The second proposal was to<br />repeal ( xxvi.) altogether. Quite frankly,<br />this has its attractions. The power<br />has never been exercised. Yet, in the<br />modern and complex world which changes<br />around us almost every week we might<br />conceivably wish to employ it. For example,<br />we have great obligations in the<br />case of Nauru. We might, some day,<br />under some circumstances, wish to pass<br />a special law with regard to Nauruansthe<br />people of the Nauruan race-in order<br />to help them to be re-established somewhere<br />outside their existing island. We<br />might. Therefore, it would be unwise,<br />perhaps, -to deprive ourselves of the<br />machinery for dealing with a problem of<br />that kind should that problem arise. The<br />third proposal that has been made-and I<br />say this with great deference to some of my friends and supporters who have<br />mentioned it-is to add a new provision<br />rendering invalid laws regarding Aborigines<br />by, for example, invalidating any Commonwealth<br />or State discrimination on the<br />grounds of race.<br />Well Sir, all I can say, with lively<br />memories of what happened in the United<br />States of America over their amendments<br />-over what they called the " Bill of<br />Rights", the crop of litigation, and the<br />reduction -to terms of somewhat wide and<br />rhetorical expressions-is that any provision<br />of that kind would produce a cro<br />of litigation. It would involve argumer<br />of definition. It could readily invalidate<br />laws which, while designed to protect the<br />special interests of Aborigines, could be<br />held technically to discriminate either for<br />or against them. Sir, I repeat that t~<br />best protection for Aborigines is to treo<br />them, for all purposes, as Australian<br />citizens.
