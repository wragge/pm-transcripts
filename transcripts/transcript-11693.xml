    <content><![CDATA[<p>E&amp;OE....................................................................................................</p>
<p>  Well thank you very much to Mrs Kate Carnell, the Chief</p>
<p> Minister of the ACT, to Senator Margaret Reid, the President of the Senate,</p>
<p> Ian Macdonald my Ministerial colleague, Mr Gary Nairn, the Member for</p>
<p> Eden Monaro, Gary Humphries, the Deputy Chief Minister of the ACT, other</p>
<p> Members of Parliament, ladies and gentlemen.</p>
<p>  Can I say how tremendously enthused I am both by the</p>
<p> concept of the focus on business exercise and also by the sheer scope</p>
<p> and support that has been demonstrated not only here tonight but also</p>
<p> by what has happened today and what will happen tomorrow.</p>
<p>  I am doubly pleased because I believe Canberra and the</p>
<p> surrounding areas that make up Canberra and its regional location has</p>
<p> done the very thing that I believe that many people wanted it to do for</p>
<p> a long time, and that is to recognise that whilst it would always have</p>
<p> a very important place as the national capital and that that would largely</p>
<p> shape its identity so far as the rest of the Australian community was</p>
<p> concerned, its long-term future lay in breaking away from the notion that</p>
<p> it was essentially a public service city. And what has happened over the</p>
<p> last few years I think has vindicated the judgement of many people who</p>
<p> saw that as being necessary in the medium to longer term because what</p>
<p> the ACT, what Canberra and the surrounding regions has been able to do</p>
<p> in recent years is to create the image of itself, in the business community</p>
<p> in particular, as a good place in which to do business, as an area of</p>
<p> Australia having a very well educated, savvy, technologically sophisticated,</p>
<p> certainly in the area of information technology, something that I'll</p>
<p> return to in a moment, and in overall terms an area of Australia that</p>
<p> was increasingly going to be one in which it was attractive to do business.</p>
<p>  Now tonight is not really an occasion for a long recitation</p>
<p> of statistics but I think it is important so as to underline what has</p>
<p> been achieved largely, but not entirely, by the many men and women in</p>
<p> this room, to underline the scale of the transformation of your economy</p>
<p> in recent times.</p>
<p>  Australia's growth rate over the last few years</p>
<p> has averaged 4% and that itself is quite remarkable, at a national level</p>
<p> we've not had that growth rate since the 1960's. But Canberra's,</p>
<p> the ACT economy grew by 7% in the year to December 1999 and that is the</p>
<p> highest of any Australian state or territory.</p>
<p>  No state or territory has a lower level of unemployment,</p>
<p> than does the ACT. At 5.3% your unemployment rate is well below the national</p>
<p> figure and it is also at its lowest level since June of 1990. Over the</p>
<p> last four years unemployment in the ACT has fallen from 8.1% to 5.3%.</p>
<p> And importantly, although the size of the public service has contracted</p>
<p> since 1996, Canberra's private sector workforce has more than grown</p>
<p> to compensate for this.</p>
<p>  The private sector's share of total wage and salary</p>
<p> earners has grown from under 47% in 1996 to around 55% last year and that</p>
<p> itself represents a remarkable transformation. It is not only a function</p>
<p> of the undoubted contraction of the public sector in the ACT but it is</p>
<p> also a function of the immensely more attractive business climate which</p>
<p> has been created in the ACT.</p>
<p>  Real business investment in the ACT rose by 10.7% in</p>
<p> the December quarter. And another indication of the strength of the ACT</p>
<p> economy is its massive 49% increase in dwelling unit commencements over</p>
<p> the last year. And median house prices in Canberra are now above their</p>
<p> March 1996 level.</p>
<p>  Now that, essentially is all I want to say in relation</p>
<p> to state statistics but I believe that the scale of the improvement that's</p>
<p> occurred in the ACT, in Canberra and the surrounding regions, the scale</p>
<p> of that achievement is such that it is important for me in particular</p>
<p> to emphasise those figures because they do represent two things. They</p>
<p> represent, may I say, I hope, not immodestly, a reflection of the success</p>
<p> of the government's overall economic policy.</p>
<p>  When you have successful national economic policies they</p>
<p> do have a resonance in every part of the country. And it is true that</p>
<p> unemployment in Australia for example is now sharply lower than what it</p>
<p> was four years ago. And even in those areas of our country that have the</p>
<p> highest level of unemployment, even in those regions such as the Hervey</p>
<p> Bay region of Queensland or parts of northern Tasmania or parts of the</p>
<p> outer suburban areas of Sydney, around Campbelltown, which have very high</p>
<p> levels of unemployment, even their absolute levels are now much lower</p>
<p> that what they were four years ago. And it is important to understand</p>
<p> that the economic reform program that the government has implemented,</p>
<p> at times as the Chief Minister was kind enough to acknowledge, not without</p>
<p> political challenge and political peril, that has given the Australian</p>
<p> economy an underlying strength which has enabled us to grow as fast, if</p>
<p> not faster than any industrialised nation in the world over the last three</p>
<p> or four years.</p>
<p>  We do have a budget that is very strongly in balance.</p>
<p> We do have high levels of business investment. We do have lower levels</p>
<p> of unemployment. We have much lower interest rates; we have much lower</p>
<p> inflation. We are seen as a country which is paying off its debt and is</p>
<p> increasingly more competitive.</p>
<p>  And we have ahead of us on the 1st of July</p>
<p> the introduction of the biggest change in Australia's taxation system</p>
<p> certainly since WWII and perhaps since Federation. And there is no absence</p>
<p> of those who would seek in the months before the 1st of July</p>
<p> to sow the seeds of unhappiness and discord and confusion about the new</p>
<p> taxation system. None of this surprises me in the least. I knew that we</p>
<p> would fight to achieve community acceptance first of all of the notion</p>
<p> of reform of the taxation system and I knew that the path to the first</p>
<p> of July would be strewn with stories of confusion and of chaos and of</p>
<p> unfairness and of undue penalty on this or that section of the Australian</p>
<p> community.</p>
<p>  I see on the news tonight that the latest argument is</p>
<p> about the price of fuel. The price of fuel is a very sensitive issue in</p>
<p> a country as big as Australia. And it may be of interest to those who</p>
<p> are railing against government policy in this area to be reminded of one</p>
<p> or two salient features. The first of those salient features is that the</p>
<p> basic driver of fuel prices in Australia is of course the world price</p>
<p> of crude oil. And that world price has been on the rise over the last</p>
<p> few months. There are some signs of stability returning but we won't</p>
<p> know the outcome of that for a few days or weeks yet. That is something</p>
<p> over which no Australian government, Labor or Liberal, has any direct</p>
<p> control of any kind.</p>
<p>  The other thing that I would remind those critics of</p>
<p> is that one of the distinguishing features of the tax package is that</p>
<p> it is going to result in sharply lower fuel prices than would otherwise</p>
<p> be the case in rural and regional Australia. The original scope of that</p>
<p> concession has been scaled back because of the attitude of the Australian</p>
<p> Democrats. It is not as generous as we originally wanted because it's</p>
<p> going to be restricted to rural and regional areas in a manner to be announced</p>
<p> very shortly. But it would nonetheless represent, for those areas, a very</p>
<p> significantly lower cost of fuel than would otherwise be the case. In</p>
<p> fact the price of fuel annually is going to fall by about three and a</p>
<p> half to four billion dollars and that will be of enormous benefit to people</p>
<p> doing business in rural and regional Australia.</p>
<p>  Because, ladies and gentlemen, taxation reform is not</p>
<p> just about the GST, it's not just about the fact that we are replacing</p>
<p> a rather ramshackle wholesale tax system, that taxes some things not at</p>
<p> all but taxes other things at rates as high as 32 and 45% with a single</p>
<p> rate of tax at 10% potentially across the board barring basic food stuffs</p>
<p> and one or two essential services such as visiting a doctor. It's</p>
<p> not just about that, it's about a fundamental remaking of our taxation</p>
<p> system, it's about 80% of wage and salary earners paying a marginal</p>
<p> tax rate of no more than 30 cents in the dollar. For people in business</p>
<p> it means that we're going to have a corporate tax rate of 30 cents</p>
<p> in the dollar rather than 36 cents.</p>
<p>And can I say very directly to an audience which is probably made up</p>
<p> of proportionately more people in the service sector of the economy than</p>
<p> in the manufacturing sector of the economy than perhaps any other gathering</p>
<p> that I might address anywhere in Australia, that that particular change</p>
<p> is of particular benefit to people in the service sector of the economy.</p>
<p> We will have one of the most competitive corporate tax rates not only</p>
<p> in the world, but certainly in our part of the world.</p>
<p>It is also of course about halving capital gains tax. For self funded</p>
<p> retirees, if there are any here tonight, it's about a number of special</p>
<p> benefits including the abolition of provisional tax and the introduction</p>
<p> of dividend imputation credits which will ensure that people get the full</p>
<p> benefit and the full value of their franked dividends.</p>
<p>I mention these things ladies and gentlemen because you know and I know</p>
<p> that there is a game on at the moment and that game is called scare the</p>
<p> voter. And that game is about planting as much fear and engaging in as</p>
<p> many scare tactics as possible to try and discredit the tax system before</p>
<p> it comes into operation. But can I say to you that I have no intention</p>
<p> as Prime Minister and none of my Ministerial colleagues have any intention</p>
<p> of allowing that campaign to succeed. I mean this is not something we</p>
<p> suddenly dropped on the Australian people out of the clear blue sky, after</p>
<p> the last election. We did have an election, we did tell the Australian</p>
<p> people what we were going to do. We spelt it out in stark detail. We told</p>
<p> people what the rates were going to be. We told people the incidence of</p>
<p> the tax. We disclosed the taxation scale, we went in to more detail on</p>
<p> a major policy than any government since federation has gone in to and</p>
<p> we won that election. And we have charted that reform through the Australian</p>
<p> Parliament and we are now in the process of introducing it. And I pursued</p>
<p> the cause of taxation reform for a long time in my political career and</p>
<p> we are pursuing it now for one reason and one reason alone and that is</p>
<p> we believe it is good for Australia. That it will make the Australian</p>
<p> economy more competitive. It will make the economy of Canberra and the</p>
<p> surrounding regions more competitive.</p>
<p>And another great benefit, let me say of taxation reform is that it is</p>
<p> going to give to the States and Territories of Australia, something that</p>
<p> they have craved for decades and that is access to a growth tax. We have</p>
<p> had this annual circus as it has been called  The Premier's</p>
<p> Conference, where the Premiers come in to Canberra, they shake their fist</p>
<p> at the front door of Parliament House and they say they are going to demand</p>
<p> a better deal for their states from the Commonwealth and then they come</p>
<p> out at the end of the conference and they say that once again the Commonwealth</p>
<p> is being mean and miserly and they are going to have to go back home and</p>
<p> increase taxes because the federal government won't give them enough</p>
<p> money. And that has gone on for years and it hasn't really mattered</p>
<p> who the Prime Minister has been. Whether it has been Malcom Fraser or</p>
<p> Bob Hawke or Paul Keating or John Howard, it hasn't really mattered</p>
<p> and it hasn't really mattered where the Premiers have come from or</p>
<p> what political party they belong to. It's gone on year after year</p>
<p> and Liberal Premiers have been more vigorous, Prime Ministers have been</p>
<p> more vigorously insulted by Liberal Premiers and I can remember some of</p>
<p> the choice things that Wayne Goss used to say about my immediate predecessors</p>
<p> when he came down here. He was no slouch at having a go at a Labor Prime</p>
<p> Minister. It was all part of the I suppose the charade of commonwealth</p>
<p> state financial relations and at the root of all of that was the fact</p>
<p> that the states said it was unfair because the commonwealth government</p>
<p> had access to all of the growth in taxation revenue.</p>
<p>Now we are going to change that on the 1st of July. This is</p>
<p> something I don't think a lot of people understand. I mean the other</p>
<p> day I heard Mr Carl Scully who is the Minister for Transport in NSW, trying</p>
<p> to justify fare increases by reference to the GST and he was saying that</p>
<p> NSW transport users, train riders in NSW  commuters - would understand</p>
<p> that after the 1st of July, that every time they bought a ticket,</p>
<p> the GST component of that rail ticket was going to go straight into John</p>
<p> Howard's pocket. And I say wrong Carl Scully, every last cent of</p>
<p> the GST is going straight into Bob Carr's pocket and that is something</p>
<p> about this tax reform that a lot of people are over looking and that is</p>
<p> that all of the Goods and Services tax is going to the states and the</p>
<p> territories. And it will mean as the years go by and once you get through</p>
<p> the transitional phase and for a state like Queensland, and I think the</p>
<p> ACT does relatively well out of this as well, after a fairly short period</p>
<p> of time, you are going to be in a growth situation. And after a number</p>
<p> of years, all of the states are going to be much better off than they</p>
<p> would otherwise had been if the existing formula had been maintained.</p>
<p> And that means that all of them will be able to pour more money into basic</p>
<p> services, public hospitals, government schools, police, transport and</p>
<p> road. All of the things that governments both state and territorial do</p>
<p> in this country which are quite properly regard as local services.</p>
<p>Now my friends I perhaps digress a little in talking to you about taxation</p>
<p> reform, just a little. And you will understand why because I think it's</p>
<p> very important. I mean this is a gathering of men and women who are interested</p>
<p> in the economic future of Canberra and its regions. It's a gathering</p>
<p> of men and women who know that you can't have a good economy unless</p>
<p> you have a government that is willing to undertake fundamental reforms.</p>
<p> You have been willing to take risks. As I looked at the acceptance list</p>
<p> tonight, I see a vast array of large Australian companies that are displaying</p>
<p> a great deal of interest in this city and in the region of which it is</p>
<p> heart. And that reason, that interest is a direct consequence of the leadership</p>
<p> that I believe Kate Carnell's government here in the ACT has shown.</p>
<p>I think she has led a government that has been realistic. I know that</p>
<p> some of the decisions the federal government took after May, in the May</p>
<p> budget in 1996 were unpopular in the ACT, I know that and I was told that</p>
<p> frequently and that is fair enough because politics is about plain speaking.</p>
<p> And we took those decisions because we believed that in the longer term</p>
<p> if we got our budget back in to balance, every body would be better off</p>
<p> and if you look around you, you start to see the benefit of that commitment.</p>
<p> But it would not have been possible for Canberra to have absorbed those</p>
<p> changes unless there had been a willingness by the local business community</p>
<p> to get off its tail to use the vernacular and to attract new business</p>
<p> and to recognise that you have got some natural advantages such as for</p>
<p> example as your region is seen as probably the most attractive region</p>
<p> or one of the most attractive regions in Australia for developing e-commerce</p>
<p> because of your very sophisticated highly educated work force. The way</p>
<p> in which this city and this region has taken to the advantages of outsourcing.</p>
<p> The way in which I think you have built upon the natural advantages that</p>
<p> Canberra and the surrounding area has. The way in which you no longer</p>
<p> see this region as just being the Australian Capital Territory but its</p>
<p> got a broader reach than that and that is why I am delighted to see representatives</p>
<p> of Councils and areas in NSW surrounding the Australian Capital Territory</p>
<p> gathered here this evening.</p>
<p>And I have come along tonight for a couple of reasons. First and foremost</p>
<p> to make it very plain that the federal government totally supports the</p>
<p> goals and the aspirations of your conference. It totally supports the</p>
<p> goals and the aspirations of the government of the ACT in developing the</p>
<p> economic strengths of the area and tomorrow morning at breakfast, many</p>
<p> of you will have the opportunity of talking to four or five of the most</p>
<p> senior Ministers in the Federal Government to convey your thoughts and</p>
<p> to gain their insights.</p>
<p>The future I believe of the ACT is one of great economic strength and</p>
<p> great economic prosperity. Canberra, which is a beautiful city by any</p>
<p> measure will always occupy a very special place in the national life of</p>
<p> our country. There will always within the Australian community be something</p>
<p> of an ambivalence towards Canberra because it is the National Capital.</p>
<p> There is no federation in the world where from time to time for convenience</p>
<p> sake, people who don't live in the National Capital, choose in some</p>
<p> way to make unkind remarks about the National Capital. But equally the</p>
<p> National Capital, increasingly is seen with great pride by the people</p>
<p> of Australia. And I am reminded of some remarks that were made by Sir</p>
<p> Robert Menzies when he was Prime Minister and he spoke of a different</p>
<p> Canberra and he spoke of a Canberra that was viewed perhaps differently</p>
<p> not only by some of its residents but by the rest of the country. And</p>
<p> he said as the new capital would inevitably have small beginnings, it</p>
<p> will be looked down upon by its elder state brethren and later as it grows</p>
<p> as the centre of power, it will be looked at sometimes with envy but ultimately</p>
<p> with pride.</p>
<p>I remarked today when I spoke at the National War Memorial at the reopening</p>
<p> ceremony by the Queen. I spoke of the magnet that that memorial represented</p>
<p> to hundreds of thousands of Australians and that is but one example of</p>
<p> the attraction of this part of the world and of this city in particular</p>
<p> to people from other parts of Australia. And what I think is really valuable</p>
<p> about what is occurred here over the last few years and what your conference,</p>
<p> your focus on business conference represents. I think it is the coming</p>
<p> together of those three things which will really make Canberra and its</p>
<p> regions a very dynamic area of the Australian economy. And they are the</p>
<p> undoubted role of Canberra as the National Capital. Secondly, what flows</p>
<p> from that is that there will always be a very large public service component</p>
<p> of the life and the culture of this city. And thirdly and particularly</p>
<p> as represented here tonight is the commitment of so many men and women</p>
<p> in the business community to build upon the natural advantages of this</p>
<p> city and its regions.</p>
<p>And what is encouraging about what I see here tonight and what I know</p>
<p> to be the case in discussion with Mrs Carnell and with so many of my own</p>
<p> Ministers is the realisation that there is no longer any conflict between</p>
<p> the public service side and the business side. Those days are fast slipping</p>
<p> behind us. That each is seen as complementary to the other and if you</p>
<p> work together then you are going to get some very good results. So I am</p>
<p> delighted to be with you tonight. I want to say again that I respect very</p>
<p> much the leadership that Kate Carnell's government has shown. It's</p>
<p> not easy governing anything these days. Government is challenging. We</p>
<p> live in a less tribal political environment and the ebb and flow of public</p>
<p> opinion is freer and fuller than used to by the case. But that is part</p>
<p> and parcel of what public life is all about. It is very much about as</p>
<p> we have done with things like tax reform, committing yourself to an objective,</p>
<p> accepting that there is political risk, but maintaining a sense of commitment</p>
<p> and purpose because you know it is in the national interest and I believe</p>
<p> you have seen that here in the ACT and I congratulate Kate and her colleagues</p>
<p> for that. I thank all of you for the support that you are showing for</p>
<p> Canberra, for our National Capital and for the cause and I wish this conference</p>
<p> every success.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
