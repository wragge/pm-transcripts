TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON F J KEATING, M?<br />
INTERVIEW WITH KERRY O'BRIEN, LATELINE<br />
19 NOVEMBER 1992<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
KOB: Welcome to the program. Tonight I am joincd by the Prime Minister, Paul<br />
Kcating, who onc month from now celebrates his first anniversary in Office. That<br />
period has seen his pcrsonal stocks and those of his Government make a<br />
remarkable turn around, in the face of the worst recession since the Great<br />
Depression and still rising unemployment. The polls show the Government in a<br />
position to win an election and Paul Keating is preferred by the majority of voters<br />
as Prime Minister. Yet the polls are more a measure of the unpopularity of the<br />
Oppositions policics, which is masking the Govermcnts own failures to turn the<br />
economy around. On assuming power, Keating sct the Government's vision, One<br />
Nation promised jobs, tax cuts and infrastructure spending, all predicatcd on<br />
growth estimates that now seem hopelessly optimistic. By its own forccast the<br />
Government has not measured up, commodity prices arc down, the international<br />
economy is sick, the Australian dollar is under attack, business confidence is<br />
clearly still very shaky. As we move closer and closer to election mode, where is<br />
the recovery going to come from? All in all, plenty to talk about tonighit. Paul<br />
Keating, welcome to 1at1clinc.<br />
PM: Kcrry.<br />
KOB: After you settled in as Prime Minister you Iahourcd mightily to come up with a<br />
document that would at least match the Opposition's Fightbuck package as a<br />
strategic plan for the next four years. When you presented One Nation on<br />
February 26 you said and I quote, " Tonight the Governmecnt presents a statement<br />
to get Australia moving, a four year stratcgy for growth in the ' 90s". You also </p>
<p>TEL: __ 20. Nov. 92 15: 2( No. UU( I-' U77Ã±' 4<br />
2<br />
said, " in 1992 we need recovery and we need jobs." After nine months how many<br />
of the fundamental assumptions of One Nation remain true?<br />
PM: The principal thing. That is, that there is a role for Government, that it is not the<br />
Government's job to withdraw from the problem, that it won't solve isclf by a<br />
policy of withdrawl which was largely, for instance, what President Bush was<br />
putting in the United States, and which Govenor Clinton campaigned against and<br />
secured a mandate. Now, in thc very same way in Australia we are saying, in<br />
respect of One Nation, that there was a job for thc Government to do, there was not<br />
only a job for the Governmient to do, but in the large areas of the -public<br />
infrastucture, some of which long forgotten and underspent in the ' 8S, that this<br />
was a time to renew public infrastructure and that the two very nicely coincided<br />
with the needs of the economy in the short and medium term.<br />
KOB: But what you came through with, loud and clear, with One Nation was a ring of<br />
confidence. And it was a confidence that you were trying to sell to the nation,<br />
which I suppose was part of thc strategy, really, to get the economy going. You<br />
have built just about everything on the corner stone of growth, haven't you? In<br />
February, thc One Nation growth forecast was 4.75 per cent, in June that forecast<br />
was adjusted down to 4 per cent, by the August Budget it was down to 3 per cent,<br />
and now it is about to drop again. That is three wrong estimates in 9 months.<br />
What does that do to the integrity of One Nation, given what else has been built<br />
around it?<br />
PM: I don't think in terms of Onc Nation as a package, that the growth forecast worry<br />
its integrity. Its integrity is about whcthcr wc need in Australia at the moment an<br />
expansionary stance of policy. That is, whether we need an expansionary stance of<br />
fiscal and monetary policy. Now the Government believes we do, the Opposition<br />
believes we do not. 1I'hey say take $ 7 billion out of the Budget deficit, 2 per cent<br />
of GDP, we say that will put Australia back into recession, we also say you should<br />
have an expansionary stance, and the things you should do should be substantial.<br />
That's what One Nation was about. The forecasts were important in signalling to<br />
the country what we thought the growth trajectory would be like, hut not intcgral<br />
to One Nation, to the sense and purpose of One Nation.<br />
KOB: Maybe not to the sense and purpose but to the reality of Onc Nation. The things<br />
that were built around it, jobs for example. You built jobs predicated on growth,<br />
and let's look at jobs. You said in a television interview, the night after One<br />
Nation, that of the 800, 000 new jobs to be created over the next 4 years and I<br />
quote, " we would have about the first 150,000 to 200,000 jobs in the first year".<br />
So, how many jobs has One Nation created so far?<br />
PM: It is very hard to say without actually threading through the spending and seeing<br />
exactly where it has come from. </p>
<p>TEL: 20. Nov. 92 15: 27 No .007 P. 03/ 14<br />

KOB: But you would be keeping a very tight monitor on that wouldn't you, given the<br />
critical nature of the wholc thing?<br />
PM: But it was ncver a case of month by month employment off the One Nation<br />
spending, it is the whole impact on the economy and how employment has<br />
responded to that. But I think the most important thing though, Kerry, is that if<br />
you look at the 1980s experience, the cast of policy which the Labor Government<br />
adopted in ' 83-4 and ' 85 induced a recovery. What we arc arguing is the same will<br />
induce a recovery now, and has. We are now growing in the last six months or so<br />
at about 2 per cent a year, or that order, We are back into a recovery phase.<br />
KOB: It is still well behind what you are projecting.<br />
PM: I know, but a few things have happened since then. Growth In the world has got<br />
much softer, there is no onc tugging Australia along or putting any impetus into<br />
our economy from external growth and we are going through a very enhanced<br />
recovery. A very enhanced recovery a productivity, there is a big blow out in<br />
* productivity. productivity is running at about 2.6 per cent a year and that is<br />
shorthand for saying we arc getting the same or more output from fewer people<br />
employed in the process.<br />
KOB: But you would have understood thc productivity equation when you went into One<br />
Nation.<br />
PM: I think you can only, with those things, see what thc economy's experience is and<br />
what employers themselves think of the economy, its prospects and what they are<br />
prepared to do in terms of productivity changc.<br />
KOB: But fundamental to everything is jobs. You have said that yourself, you have<br />
preached growth for most of this year, you have preached jobs for most of this<br />
year. But according to the latest Bureau of Statistics trend estimates, I think the<br />
most reliable measure available, 30,000 new jobs have been created from February<br />
to October and that includes a big period before One Nation would have even<br />
begun to bite. And at the same time another 65,000 people have become<br />
unemployment statistics. In other words, for every new job Crcatcd Iwo have been<br />
lost. Now that is not exactly a winning battle, is it?<br />
PM: Well Kerry, if you look at the last few months wc think that employment growth Is<br />
on track with the Budget forecast for cmployment growth. So, you can makc a<br />
commcntary over a year.<br />
KOB: How can it be on track when your growth estimates are running at almost half<br />
what you originally predicated your job growth forecasts on?<br />
PM: No, not on the Budy. ct. Are you talking about Onc Nation or the Budget?<br />

4<br />
KOB: Yes, One Nation.<br />
pM: No, I am saying if you look at the Budget forecast.<br />
KOB: Which was a fair re-writing of One Nation.<br />
PM: I think the key point is this, Kerry', this party, this Government produced a record<br />
amount of employment growth in the 1980s. That's what we committed ourselves<br />
to, that's what we are best at, that's our long suit. The recession put us off that<br />
game, we arc simply going back to it.<br />
KGB: But it is much tougher this time, much tougher, much slower.<br />
PM: But you can make a point of discussion about what quarter it is happening in,<br />
where the ping picks up. But pick up it will because the Government's cast of<br />
policy is for growth and employment, The Opposition's isn't, that's thc key point.<br />
So what the levels are or the rutes, thc fact is we had through the ' 80s phenomenal<br />
employment growth, two or three times thc OECD average. It was our long suit, is<br />
our long suit, will remain our long suit.<br />
K013: 8crnie Fraser, last Thursday or Friday in New York, said that unemployment<br />
would stay around 10 to 1.1 per cent for some time to come. That doesn't sit with<br />
your unemployment projections which I think in One Nation said, page 120 of<br />
One Nation, you projected an avcrage rate of unemployment for 1992-93 of<br />
per cent and to around 9.5 per cent by mid 1993, that's by the middle of next year.<br />
What Bernie Fraser says puts the lie to that.<br />
PM: Well that's One Nation, we adjusted all of that in the Budgct. You can't put me<br />
through the same discussion twice. We had all that at Budget time.<br />
KOB: You sold One Nation very hard at the time, are you saying One Nation no longer<br />
applies?<br />
PM: The kcy question is which party is going to induce a recovery in Australia? That's<br />
the key qucstion.<br />
KOB:-Alr-ight. I will keep playing on with One Nation at this stage.<br />
PM: But there is only one, isn't there? It's only the Government because we are saying<br />
that economic policy should be committed to growth and employment growth, we<br />
shouldn't be holding back.<br />
KOB: Let's look at your detailed credibility. One Nation spending on infrastructure,<br />
$ 283 million I think you allocated for railways this financial year. You have now<br />
had to divert $ 150 million of that to other short term job creation because you can't<br />
get the railway programs up on time. </p>
<p>TEL: 20. Nov. 92 15: 27 No. 007 P. 05/ 1<br />
PM: But what's incredible about that? The question is..<br />
KOB:. But what do we believe about what you project?<br />
PM: The question is will the One Nation package of funds be spent by 30 June 1993?<br />
Answer, yes.<br />
KOHI: But it won't be spent on infrastructure to the degree that you had planned, which is<br />
all about micro reform quite apart from job creation.<br />
PM: In the main it will. But you se, In the tail systems wc had courtesy of 30 years of<br />
indolent Conservative Government, these dinosaur..<br />
KOB: But didn't you..<br />
PM: Hang on, don't be too zealous now, Thes dinosaur public authorities for which<br />
we presumed, and they said, they had enginccring egxp pkqis. r. iady to spend<br />
these monies. In fact, thcse outfits were so run down they didn't have engineering<br />
planning together, and because the Commonwealth was never In the railway<br />
business outside of AN, there is no Commowealth bureaucracy that has any<br />
specialisation in the NSW or Victorian rail systcems. So, what will happen is those<br />
changcs will be made, they will be made in the following financial year, but the<br />
expenditure..<br />
KOB:. So it is delaycd for a year, regardless of why, pardon the pun, it has gone off the<br />
tails?<br />
PM: Not the stimulus, the whole point of the thing was the stimulus.<br />
KOB: Well part of the point.<br />
PM:. The point was to stimulate the economy with a set lcvel of spending over 1 per<br />
cent of GDP. That we will have done, we will havc spent it.<br />
KOB: OK. Let's look at One Nation's promise to return to Budgct surplus in 4 years. In<br />
February you projected a starting point for this year's Budget defcit of $ 8 billion,<br />
in May you revised that to $ 10.5 billion, the Budget in August calculated $ 13.4<br />
billion. Now the ABS, the Bureau of Statistics says it is up to $ 14.5 billion. Given<br />
all the evidence can you honestly stand by the Budget forecast with any<br />
confidence at all as far as the deficit is concerncd?<br />
PM: We had in about a month between June and July a decline in collections of about<br />
billion upon what was expected in the last financial year and coming into this<br />
financial year. Now that reflects just realities in the economy, that is the actual </p>
<p>TEL: 20. Nov. 92 15: 27 No. 007 P. 06/ 14<br />
6<br />
result. So what is the point of us saying this is not in line with what we thought.<br />
All you have got to do is adjust the cost accordingly.<br />
KOS: I suppose what I am asking is, how can you in all of the instabilities and<br />
uncertainties about this economy, given the Governmient's the Treasury's, the<br />
Reserve Bank's, everybody's incapacity to properly forecast trends, how can you<br />
possibly project anything for 4 years ahead with any confidence?<br />
PM: Kerry, you are becoming a forecasting nlutter. I anm just making this point to you,<br />
the key point, I make it again, is the cast of policy. That is, interest rates<br />
KOB; But what do we evaluate your cast of policy on? What do we judge it on? Results.<br />
PM: Interest rates, fiscal policy, the recovery which is already under way in the<br />
economy clearly from National Accounts data. I mean actual results. If the<br />
revenuec collections are under forecast for this year and they have been dealt with<br />
in subsequent years, so what. The main point is are we going to recover, I say we<br />
will recovcr under a Labor Government because Labor Governments arc about<br />
growth and expansion and thc Liberal Party is about contraction.<br />
KOB: Alright. But can you still say with any credibility, with any certainty that you will<br />
return to surplus in 4 years? Ycs or no?<br />
PM: What did we say in thc Budget? We said that we had a short fall which we needed<br />
to addrcss.<br />
But you would still be targetting for the surplus?<br />
PM: The Treasurer addressed that, but we probably will be nearer surplus.<br />
KOB: Nearer surplus, probably?<br />
PM: But so what? Look, Kerry, let me tell this to you old boy. I was the first Treasurer<br />
in Commonwealth history to post a surplus.<br />
KOM: Alright, I will grant you that, I will grant you that, but that is history now.<br />
PM: Four massive surpluses.<br />
KOB: That is the past wc are now looking about the present and the future.<br />
PM: -But since when do wc have to go back to surpluses? Since when are they holy<br />
writ? None of you cver heard of a surplus, the mcdia could barely spell surplus<br />
before this Government produced them. </p>
<p>KOB: Because the markets now regard them as holy writ. Because the value of the<br />
dollar, for one thing, Is predicated on issues like that.<br />
PM: Let's say, this is not a forecast projectioa, it has no intelligence to it, but let's say<br />
we were $ 2 billion short of balance.<br />
KOB: But you made your reputation on those policies in the ' 80s. You made your<br />
reputation on the achievements of things like surplus.<br />
PM: Half a per cent of GDP, so what?<br />
KOB: So what is your reputation going to be on the first half of the ' 90s on that score?<br />
Changed circumstances mean..<br />
PM: No Western Government has a tighter fiscal policy than the Labor Government of<br />
the ' 80s. We put away in the savings account of thc nation about $ 20-25 billion of<br />
surplus funds. That is why now we can use them to expand thc economy. That is<br />
why the United States can't expand the economy.<br />
KOB: But you're not using surplus funds to expand the economy, you're in deficit to<br />
somewhere between $ 13-14.5 billion.<br />
PM: But we ran down Commonwealth debt to GDP from about 25 per cent to about 14<br />
per cent by putting surpluses away, we are now running it out to 18 per cent. So,<br />
we have got one of the smallest Government debt to GDP ratios in the world, at 18<br />
per cent of GDP wc arc now using dcfecits for a slow economy by virtue of the<br />
fact that we put away surpluses in a strong economy.<br />
KOB: And foreign debt is getting up close to 40 per cent of GDP.<br />
PM: And here's our Liberal Party friends, the slowest learners in the business, wanting<br />
to say to us, oh no, let's cut $ 7 billion or 2 per cent of GDP out of spending. Let's<br />
push us right back into recesion so we can have a surplus. Surplus at thc wrong<br />
time.<br />
KOB: OK. Let's look at tax cuts. Speaking of the right time and the wrong time, the<br />
promised tax cuts from One Nation. Those tax cuts were calculated on growth,<br />
inflation and bracket creep. Since most of that has gone out the window I am sure<br />
inflation is good news as a component of that, but that effects bracket creep, since<br />
most of that has gone out the window you have had to try to anticipate funding in<br />
advance with other tax increases. The thing is in all the circumstances how can<br />
you possibly justify those massive tax cuts this far out for anything other than<br />
straight political purposes, winning the next election?<br />
PM: Because I don't think the incidence of tax should ris~ e. I don't think that we ought<br />
to be having surplus fetishes years from now and try to cover them with tax </p>
<p>T2EL0:. Nov. 92 15: 27 No. 00? P. 08/ 14<br />
8<br />
collections brought about by a higher incidence of taxation. I just don't think we<br />
need.<br />
KOB: But you have acknowledged for example the need for infrastructure spending.<br />
Thcrc arc some who would say the need for infrastructure spending is even much<br />
greater than you're anticipating. There is a limited purse within which to do that,<br />
but you are promising with a very uncertain economy, very uncertain recovery,<br />
very uncertain international economy, you are promising a massive tax cut, two<br />
years from now, three years from now, four years from now.<br />
PM: To maintain the tax to GD) P ratios we roughly have at the moment. In other words,<br />
what I'm promising is not to put up tax.<br />
KOB: It's got nothing to do with the Opposition's tax cut promises, nothing to do with a<br />
desire to go to the next election campaign with a tax cut.<br />
PM: It makes a very intrecsting political point that we reduce the 38 rate, at the range of<br />
$ 20,500 of Income from 38 to 30 without a consumption tax and that is the point<br />
that thc Liberals are now pondering. That is all the tax cuts that Australians were<br />
likely to gct from Dr Hcwson's Fightback package under a consumption tax, they<br />
will get from the Labor Government and we are legislating them now from 38 to<br />
no consumiption tax.<br />
KOB: OK lct's come back to a final word about ' One Nation' a final measure of what<br />
' One Nation' was supposed to achieve, what it has achieved, what it may achieve<br />
and the extent to which it has been revised. Growth forecasts badly wrong,<br />
unemployment forecasts wrong, job growth wrong, deficit forecast looking sick,<br />
infrastructure spending revised, tax cuts as many would say barely credible.<br />
Surely that all says that ' One Nation!<br />
PM: Legislated.<br />
KOB: Legislatcd, but harcly crcdiblc in tcrmns of thc original basis on which they were<br />
predicated, strong growth amongst other things and in the end surely you've got to<br />
say that ' One Nation' today has become a very shaky, it not discredited document.<br />
PM: No, cut it out Kerry, cut it out. ' One Nation' was a psychological boost for the<br />
country.<br />
K013: It was a blueprint.<br />
PM: No, hang on it said let's go and expand fiscal policy when it needs expansion, let's<br />
do it in all the things that nccd doing rebuilding the rail highway, accelerating<br />
the road highways and the ring roads, the electricity grid, the spending for the<br />
National Training Authority for vocational education all going ahead.<br />

KOB: OK it was designed to boost confidence apart from anything cise.<br />
PM: That's right.<br />
KOB: H-ow many business people, business leaders in this community today do you<br />
believe could stand up, would be prepared to stand up tomorrow and say ' One<br />
Nation' has the answers, ' Onc Nation' has the capacity to deliver the goods?<br />
PM: ' One Nation' was designed not as a panacea for all thc nation's problemns.<br />
KOB: No, build confidence. How many business leaders today would still havc<br />
confidence in ' One Nation'?<br />
PM: But to say there was a role for Government in kick starting the economy and<br />
getting it cracking.<br />
K013: But it hasn't.<br />
PM: We are growing at 2 pcr cent a year, what do you mean?<br />
KOB: You were going to grow much more than that.<br />
PM: But how do you say it hasn't? We are not in recession, we are growing.<br />
KOB; How many business leaders in Australia today would stand up and endorse ' One<br />
Nation' as a document that still inspires confidence?<br />
PM: Well, how many would stand up and say it has not had a significant influence on<br />
activity? And remember at the time, we had the chief executive officers of a<br />
numbhcr of major companies supporting its stance and do today.<br />
KOB: At the time, in ecbruary. How many would do it today?<br />
PM: We can't go on spending Kerry, you can't go on and have another one and anothcr<br />
one. T1he ' One Nation' expenditure will be spent by 30 June 1993, it will do the<br />
macro economic task it's called for and most of its spending will go as it was<br />
planned to go. Sure the railways were underspent, but they will be spent in the<br />
following ycar and we will spend that money by diverting it to other purposes this<br />
year.<br />
KOB: OK let's look now at some of the other elements that arc going on in the<br />
community. Wc are running up to Christmas, the biggest pcriod for the retail<br />
trade; retail trade are running scared aren't they in the lead up to Christmas in the<br />
main? The' HiA, the Housing Industry Association, the Master Builders<br />
Association are saying that the ousin cqpyiry. has peaked or near peaked, the<br />
Bureau of Statistics says the recovery in ncw home approvals has ended, bleak<br />

prospects for the international economny, zero growth projected for Germany for<br />
the next twelve months, we, did a program on the state of the British economy a<br />
couple of weeks ago where senior and respected economists were saying 14 per<br />
cent unemployment quite possible In Britain over the next couplc of years, Japan,<br />
their plan for recovery stalled because of problems in the Japanese administration,<br />
the United States economy, thcy are talking about stimulating but an unknown<br />
quantity. I suppose in the end where are the signs for optimism? Commodity<br />
prices, Max Walsh's column the other clay, commodity prices he says are nearly<br />
down as low as they were across the board in 1986 when they were a disaster for<br />
this economy.<br />
PM: The thing is it is a tough world out there.<br />
KOB: Sure is.<br />
PM: The world is in a very slow phase of growth and it is true commodity prices are<br />
down, it's tough going for Australia. All the more reason why the growth we are<br />
swing and the structural changes is taking Place and the links into Asia and the<br />
productivity shift and the shift down inflation and the competitive exchange rate<br />
are all ball points for Australia. I think all that commentary of yours as just said, is<br />
how hard it is to govern these days and to engineer a recovery.<br />
KOB: And how hard it's going to be for you to go to an election at some point in the first<br />
half of next year with unemnploymecnt somewhere between 10.5 and I1I per cent or<br />
higher.<br />
PM: It's a lot easier than going and saying I will actually push the cconomy back into<br />
recession, I'll contract fiscal policy, I'll put interest rates..<br />
KOB: You'll be saying that though, it's not what John Hcwson says.<br />
PM: No, yes he is, let's be clear about this. HeI says we should cut 7 billion out of<br />
outlays, 2 per cent of GDP.<br />
KOB: Yes, but he's also saying other things, he's talking about $ 20 billion to build<br />
business confidence.<br />
PM: No, that $ 20 billion Is passed onto consumers, if it's not you have a massive<br />
inflation surge. Look Kerry..<br />
KOB: You've got all of these cecemcnts, you've got a shaky dollar, you're on an absolute<br />
knife edge.<br />
PM: Kerry, I heard the question thc first time, I'm just making this point to you that it's<br />
only this Government's policy of expansion and of seeing growth of our<br />
positioning of mionctary policy, the general expansionary phase and thc pick up we </p>
<p>TEL: ~ 2J7No92 t5T2 No7fJIT F. 11/ 1[<br />
arc seeing now we've seen right through the last year in exports. The fact that the<br />
economiy is growing and that thcre are things in our domestic economy which give<br />
us cause to belicvc that that growth will continuc.<br />
KOB: Bill Kclty has said twice in the last twelve months, he is a man you respect.<br />
PM: Very much so.<br />
KOB: A friend of yours, he said twice in thc past twelve months that Labor could not win<br />
the next election with uinenlploymcnt over 10 per cent. You arc going to have to<br />
go to the election with unemployment over 10 per cent, therc is no two ways about<br />
that.<br />
PM. We say the alternative will push unemployment much higher, that the Liber-als will<br />
basically grind the place into the dust and in the middle of it have an industrial war<br />
a la Kennett and Victoria. Which ever way you look at it Kerry, Labor has been<br />
the growth party, it's been the employment growth party, sure we've been off our<br />
game with the recession, but wc arc back on our game at the point.<br />
KOB: Yes, you said in the Parliament that you would honour thc electorates mandate on<br />
the. OST Hewson wins the next election. Will you honour a similar mandate on<br />
their findustrial relations policies? Provided they stick to the policies they've<br />
outlined.<br />
PM: T'hey don't even know what their policy is to stick too. They don't know what their<br />
policy is to stick to, they are shift and shimmer around every day about it. They<br />
are saying Kennett is right 100 per cent one day then he's on he's 70 per cent the<br />
next.<br />
KOB: Forget Kennett, if they stick to the policies they hiave outlined and continue to<br />
outline, do you acknowledge that thcy will have a mandate on industrial relations<br />
as they will on the GST?<br />
PM: Kerry let me just make this clear to you, I may be old fashioned in this, but the<br />
power of the. House of Representatives is a money power, the money bills, the<br />
budget bills, the big tax bills and the GST is over half the income tax, it's half thc<br />
Budget, it's a tax shift of $ 50 billion, it's half the Budget.<br />
KOB: But it's not just money bills Paul?<br />
PM: If a Coalition Government wcrc to sccure a vcry clear miandate for that, what group<br />
of Opposition parties could with any integrity or any strength sit in Senate and say<br />
oh no, wc won't have that.<br />
KOB: But it's not just money bills. You've said again quote, quitc clearly " I don't believe<br />
it Is legitimate for an Opposition in the Senate to deny the principal element of </p>
<p>TEL: 20. Nov. 92 15: 27 No. 007 P. 12/ 14<br />
12<br />
what is a clcarly articulated mandate". Now, if they stick to the policies they have<br />
articulated on industrial relations<br />
PM. Hang on, let me tell you this, John Howard said he would produce the legislation,<br />
then he said last week no he wouldn't because he couldn't get it drafted propcrly. I<br />
offered himi the services of thc Parliament Counsel to draft it.<br />
KOB: I bet you did.<br />
PM: I did, he's now running backwards being very tricky because he says now he<br />
doesn't believe the Opposition should show the electorate the colour of the<br />
legislation. They are going to be all over the shop on industrial relations..<br />
KOB: Just like you've been all over the place on ' One Nation'.<br />
PM: and trying to secure from me any support for that absolute grab bag of that<br />
hodge podge of intellectual quackery and ideology is asking too much.<br />
KOB: But you can't rely again, for the next election there is no way that you are going to<br />
be able to rely totally on a negative canmpaigni against the Opposition to win that<br />
election.<br />
PM: We don't need to.<br />
KOU: Well what would you describe here as the fundamental elcments of Paul Keating's<br />
agenda for your first full term as Prime Minister, for Labor's fifth term in office?<br />
An agenda that will persuade Australians that you arc not a tired government, you<br />
are a rejuvenated government, you've got the energy and thc vision to do it, despite<br />
the fact that thc cconomiy Is going to allow you very little room.<br />
PM: Kerry, this is the Government that has made the big changc in Australia, the big<br />
change from basically an inward looking society and economy to an outward<br />
looking society and economy. This is the Goverment that has made the big<br />
trading switch, we are now exporting 25 per cent of all wc produce. This is the<br />
Government which is making now the tightest fit into the Asia-Pacific of any<br />
government in our history, that's what is going to save Australia.<br />
KOB: So more of the same?<br />
PM: It will never be more of the same, it will always be changing. The great micro<br />
reform agenda which we are still working on, most of it completed<br />
telecommunications, ports and wharves,<br />
KOB: Most of it complctcd? </p>
<p>TEL: 20. Nov. 92 15: 27 No. 00? P. 13/ li<br />
13<br />
PM: Telecommunications, ports and wharves, thc labour market, airlines, what else do<br />
you want me to do?<br />
KOB: The Metal Trades Industry Association which has been an employer organisation<br />
that your governiment has time after time, counted as a friend, you've identified<br />
themi as friends in effect, you've called them up to back your case on more than one<br />
occasion, the MTIA..<br />
PM: They believe in a co-operative structure.<br />
KOB: OK, the MTIA has just released a survey of 140 of their member companies across<br />
19 sectors of industry and they say that they have yet to receive across the board,<br />
they say they arc yet to receive the benefits of your micro reform package, where<br />
are the benefits, when are they going to start to flow? You've been doing this,<br />
you'vc been endeavouring to imiplcment your micro rcforrn package since 1987<br />
and y'ou say you've virtually complcted it.<br />
PM: Kerry, we arc going to have a telecommunications operator, thc price of phone<br />
calls has fallen by what, half for long distance calls. Look it's happened in airfares<br />
and travel around Australia with the -dcregulation , of the airline industry. We are<br />
going to set up a free market for electricity in the eastern states of Australia. The<br />
waterfront, waterfront productivity has risen 50 per cent this year. What do you<br />
want mc to do? Put it on a black board.<br />
KOB: we did a program on the waterfront the other night where the bulk of the users of<br />
the waterfront are saying that they haven't got any benefits of it either.<br />
PM: OK, tile users have got to put some pressure on the stevedoring companies, do they<br />
want us to do out their business for them? We can set the change up, what do they<br />
want us to do? Actually make the orders for them? Look Kerry, this place was an<br />
Industrial museum ten years ago, it is now a country locked into the fastest<br />
growing part of the world, open, it's set the tariff wall largely down, removed<br />
exchange controls, a floating exchange rate, a free financial market, a better tax<br />
system, a relatively small public sector, we arc off and running, all we've got to do<br />
is get that recovery phase moving and Australia's position in the ' 90s from a low<br />
inflationary base is going to be a very, very attractive one.<br />
KOB: I image that there is one reason well beyond any other that you have not called a<br />
pre-Christmas election and that is that up until this time you don't believe that<br />
you'd get across the line in that election. The public polls say you would,<br />
prcsumably your own private polling and your own political instincts tell you that<br />
its not yet, you're not yet there.<br />
PM: I think the more time we have to articulate our policy position, our general<br />
philosophic position, the more time we have to articulate our belief about the<br />
Coalition's, the more time we have to see the economy run on the better. </p>
<p>TEL: 20. Nov. 92 15: 2? NO. UU( 14/ 1<br />
14<br />
KOB: Well then that says a May election.<br />
PM: No, it says that any election after Christmas is basically full time.<br />
KOB: But if you want maximum time to expose their policies.<br />
PM: Look, rve bcn in this Parliament now for 23 years, I think the average length of<br />
Australian Parliaments is about 27-28 months, it's 36 months in March so let's say<br />
this, it's on the starting blocks any time in the new year because as far as rm<br />
concerned any time between then and the technical end of the Parliament is the<br />
end of the Parliament.<br />
KOB: And the average length of Lateline interviews is much shorter than this one, we'll<br />
have to end it there. Paul Keating thanks for joining us tonight.<br />
PM: Good on you Kerry, have a good Christmas.<br />
KOB: You too.<br />
