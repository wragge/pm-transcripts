    <content><![CDATA[<p>Today I am pleased to announce that the Australian Government will commit a further $6 million over three years to the National Community Crime Prevention Programme. This will bring the total funding committed to this programme to $64 million.</p>
<p>The additional funding is for a new element of the programme to support community organisations to invest in security-related infrastructure.</p>
<p> Community-based, security-related infrastructure projects will assist in reducing crime in the community and will enhance Australia's national security.</p>
<p> We have strong national security coordination arrangements and our intelligence, law enforcement, defence and emergency services agencies are well prepared to respond to terrorist incidents.  However, governments cannot combat terrorism without the support of the community.</p>
<p>Funding for security-related infrastructure, including closed circuit television (CCTV) systems, will enable community organisations to participate in crime prevention and our counter-terrorism response at a local level.</p>
<p>  The National Community Crime Prevention Programme is a great example of how the Government can support community organisations that are helping to make their own communities safer and at no time has that been more important than in the current security environment.</p>
<p>I look forward to witnessing the positive changes that will occur through the funded work of community organisations under this programme and to continuing to work in partnership with the community to keep Australia safe.</p>
