PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF NEOCNEECHATU-ULNMM Y<br />
AUGUST 1989<br />
8 &amp; OE -PROOF ONLY<br />
PM: I'll make a brief statement and if there are any questions<br />
you want to ask I'm available of course. I've just had a<br />
very productive meeting with the representatives of Australian,<br />
Ansett and IPEC. That meeting has taken some two hours.<br />
We have reached a clear position as to the course of action<br />
to be adopted in the face of what is a totally unacceptable<br />
position which to this point has been adopted by the air<br />
pilots union and their members. Let me make the point before<br />
I go any further to say there's been no direction by Government<br />
in this matter in regard to Australian, an airline which<br />
we own. But the management of that airline has come<br />
independently to this position, as of course have the two<br />
private airlines, Ansett and IPEC. The simple position with<br />
which we're faced is that we have an organisation, the Federation<br />
of Air Pilots and their members who seek to put themselves<br />
above and beyond the community by an unacceptably greedy<br />
grab for remuneration. They do that in a context where the<br />
Australian workforce generally have accepted very considerable<br />
restraint over the period of the Accord in respect of wage<br />
caims. They have done that because they see that when they<br />
pursuie wage claims they have an obligation, not only in regard<br />
ci their own members, but they have a broader obligation<br />
irrd to the community as a whole. That restraint which<br />
has eenexecise bytheAustralian workforce generally<br />
is a'restraint which has paid off over the las*+ six years<br />
in the . creation of some one and a half million jobs in the<br />
community and a level of economic activity which has enabled<br />
the creation of those Jobs. Both the Government and may<br />
I say the airline operators h ' ave adopted the position that<br />
we have in this position because of the recognition that<br />
that responsible restraint which has been exercised by the<br />
Australian workforce generally has been something that has<br />
redounded to the benefit of Australia as a whole. We are<br />
not going to tolerate a situation in which an already extremely<br />
privileged salary group are going to be let free to pursue<br />
their own self isIv interests in a way which would wreck the<br />
wage fixing * agreements and principles in this country. We<br />
express the hope, the Government and the airline operators.<br />
that when the Federation of Air Pilots meets with the Commission<br />
at four o'clock. tomorrow that the sorts of considerations<br />
to which I have referred will lead them to the conclusion<br />
that it would not only be against their Interests but against<br />
the interests of their fellow Australians if they were to<br />
adhere to their decision to operate against the principles<br />
of the Commission and outside the system. And therefore </p>
<p>I express the strong wish and hope to the air Pilots and<br />
their Federation that they will, on consideration, decide<br />
to stay within the system like the rest of their fellow<br />
Australian workers. Now if against that wish and that hope<br />
they make the decision to go outside the system then they<br />
must do so in the recognition, as I have said in the Parliament<br />
of this country, that they will have left the system which<br />
carries not only obligations to which I have been referring,<br />
but which also carries rights. Once they go outside the<br />
system, if that is their decision, which I hope they do not<br />
take, then we have then discussed the next steps which must<br />
be and will be taken to defeat this entirely unacceptable<br />
campaign. We have discussed the contingency plans that will<br />
be pursued by the airlines. That is the adoption of legal<br />
processes against individual pilots and against their<br />
organisation, which processes will carry significant penalties<br />
for individual pilots and for the Federation. I say, without<br />
equivocation, that when the airlines decide to initiate those<br />
legal processes with significantly very drastic financial<br />
penalties against individual pilots and their organisation<br />
the airlines will be pursuing those legal processes with<br />
the full support of my Government. We have also addressed<br />
the situation of what will be confronting Australia if the<br />
pilots decide on this course of action. There will obviously<br />
be an overwhelmingly drastic curtailment of services available<br />
to the Australian public. We have addressed what in, hose<br />
circumstances we will be able to do to provide khtssentially<br />
be emergency services, but not only emergency services but<br />
some additional form of service for the Australian public.<br />
We will pursue whatever courses are available to us as operators<br />
and as a Government to provide such services. We also<br />
believe that we need to look at the situation where the Pilots<br />
Federation would be seeking to have five bob each way. That<br />
is to go outside the system in respect of the major operators<br />
O but as an organisation seek to remain within the system for<br />
their members who are employed by these smaller airlines.<br />
We will need, together as a Government and as airline operators,<br />
to look at this question as to whether it's appropriate to<br />
allow the pilots organisation to have that sort of benefit.<br />
It may well be something that we think that the Commission<br />
should look at. So in total I think you can see therefore<br />
that our position can be put simply this way. That we still<br />
express the wish and exercise the hope that good sense will<br />
prevail on the part of the pilots and their organisation.<br />
It is not acceptable to the Australian public, that is obvious,<br />
and it is certainly not acceptable to my Government or to<br />
the airline operators that one already extremely privileged<br />
group of people should seek to put themselves above the rest.<br />
And remember this, that we are hardly talking about a group<br />
of people who are excessively over-worked. On average these<br />
people are flying at the stick no more than 10 hours a week.<br />
Perhaps the Australian public is not aware of that. That<br />
is what they're doing. Working some ten hours a week at<br />
the stick. That group of people who are already highly paid </p>
<p>3<br />
-on average some $ 70,000 or $ 80,000 a year seek now to<br />
get a 30% increase outside the wages system. Let me tell<br />
the Federation and their members that is not on. We will<br />
not cop it and we will give the full support of my Government<br />
to the airline operators to fight this.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, what are those legal processes? Can<br />
You outline themn?<br />
PM: I'm not going to go into the full details because they<br />
obviously have to be finalised. But let me in broad terms<br />
say that there are a range of legal opportunities available<br />
to the airlines, common law Processes and so on which will<br />
be available to them to seek penalties and damages against<br />
individual pilots and their organisation..<br />
JOURNALIST: amount to a suing and breach of contract?<br />
PM; O8viously if you're talking about common law actions<br />
those sorts of things are in contemplation. And when I say<br />
in contemplation we're not ' will we do it or won't we do<br />
it' I mean if they make the decision to go outside the<br />
system then it's not a question of will these actions be taken.<br />
They will. They will be taken. The form and details a<br />
now in the process of being finalised.<br />
JOURNALIST: When you say that the Commission should perhaps<br />
have to take a look at the Federation if they try for a bob<br />
each way, are you talking there about having them disbanded<br />
PM: As far as we're concerned now and as far as the operators<br />
are concerned the I mean if they go outside the system,<br />
that is after four o'clock tomorrow, we want them to stay<br />
in it, but if they were to go out then as far as the<br />
@ 1 operators are concerned the Federation of Air Pilots doesn't<br />
exist. The airline operators will not in those circumstances<br />
be dealing with the Federation. They will be dealing with<br />
individual pilots. So in that sense as far as the major<br />
airlines are concerned and in respect of whom the pilots<br />
would've made the decision to~ outside the system, the<br />
Federation ceases to exist. What we're saying is that at<br />
this point they believe that~ however, they can go outside<br />
th e system for the major airlines but still have the benefit<br />
of the system in regard to their members who are employed<br />
by smaller airlines. We're going to have to look at the<br />
I. question of Whether it's appropriate and whether we'<br />
may have to ask the Commission as to whether it's appropriate<br />
that they can have any status atQ1ithin a system which they<br />
have deliberately said to go to fiell.<br />
JOURNALIST: If the worst scenario happens and this action<br />
has to be taken by the airlines with your support, what sort<br />
of things could you do to help out the public airline services. 0 </p>
<p>4<br />
PM: Well, I suppose if we're going into a battle situation<br />
not of our making because we are people of peace. We want<br />
them to stay within the system. But if you're going into<br />
a battle situation of their making I think all good generals<br />
would say it makes sense to keep the powder dry.<br />
JOURNALIST: Would you allow Qantas to fly domestic routes?<br />
PM: YOu heard my previous answer.<br />
JOURNALIST:. That's an option though.<br />
PM: There are all sorts of options available to us.<br />
JOURNALIST: ( inaudible)<br />
PM: THere are all sorts of options available to us.<br />
A&amp; ends </p>
