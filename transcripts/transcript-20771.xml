    <content><![CDATA[<p>I am visiting the Philippines on 13-15 July, Japan on 15-17 July and the Republic of Korea on 17-20 July.  The visit will be an opportunity to discuss major international and regional security issues such as North Korea, terrorism and Iraq with these key regional partners.  I will also use the visit to promote commercial links with each of these three countries.</p>
<p> In the Philippines, I will meet President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo and senior members of her Cabinet.  A major focus of our discussion will be on practical cooperation to combat terrorism.  I will make an address to a major Asia Society function on regional security challenges.  In Manila, I will also meet Australian and Philippines business leaders.</p>
<p>I am looking forward to meeting Prime Minister Koizumi again in Tokyo.  The visit will be an opportunity to advance our already close dialogue and cooperation on major security issues.  Another focus of the visit will be to discuss ways further to deepen economic linkages between Australia and its largest export market.  I will give a major address to a business forum organised by the leading Nikkei newspaper and will also meet Japanese business leaders.</p>
<p>  My visit to Seoul will be a valuable early opportunity to meet the new Korean President Roh Moo Hyun and his administration.  The visit, just before the 50th Anniversary of the Korean War Armistice, will emphasise the importance Australia attaches to security on the Korean Peninsula and Australia';s interest in working closely with the Republic of Korea on these issues.  I will also be promoting the Australian LNG industry, which is seeking to increase its presence in the Korean market, and will visit the giant POSCO industrial complex at Kwangyang Bay.</p>
