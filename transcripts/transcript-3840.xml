PRINE MINISTER'S QUEENSLAND BROADCAST NO Pl<br />
WOMEN<br />
SUNDAY 10 AUGUST 1975<br />
A FEW WEEKS AGO MY WIFE AND ONE,, OF MY<br />
ADVISERS, ELIZABETH REID, RETURNED FROM -qINTERNATIONAL<br />
WOMEN'S YEAR CONFERENCE IN MEXICO CITY. IT'S NOT MY<br />
USUAL STYLE TO PAY PUBLIC TRIBUTES TO MY STAFF, BUT<br />
IT'S FAIR TO POINT OUT JUST HOW MUCH CREDIT ELIZABETH<br />
REID BROUGHT TO AUSTRALIA DURING THAT CONFERENCE AND<br />
HOW MUCH SHE HAS DONE TO HELP THE CAUSE OF WOMEN IN<br />
AUSTRALIA AND, INDEED, IN OTHER COUNTRIES, SHE WOULD<br />
BE THE LAST PERSON TO CLAIM CREDIT FOR THE MANY<br />
REFORMS MY GOVERNMENT HAS INTRODUCED FOR WOMEN, BUT<br />
HER VERY APPOINTMENT TO MY STAFF SAYS SOMETHING,<br />
I THINK ABOUT THE GOVERNMENT'S COMMITMENT TO WOMEN'S<br />
NEEDS AND INTERESTS, INTERNATIONAL WIOMEN'S YEAR HAS<br />
BEEN A REMARKABLE EXPERIMENT IN GETTING PEOPLE EVERYWHERE<br />
TO THINK ABOUT THE PROBLEMS OF WOMEN AND PERSUADING<br />
GOVERNMENTS TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THEM, THE AUSTRALIAN<br />
GOVERNMENT HAS MADE SUBSTANTIAL GRANTS TO ORGANISE<br />
CONFERENCES, SEMINARS, BOOKS AND DISCUSSIONS DURING<br />
THE YEAR. ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT CONFERENCES WILL BE<br />
HELD IN BRISBANE LATER THIS MONTH ON THE THEME OF<br />
WOMEN'S HEALTH, s / 2 </p>
<p>2. 2<br />
SOME OF YOU MAY FEEL THAT ALL THIS TALK<br />
ABOUT WOMEN IS RATHER HIGH-FLOWN AND IMPRACTICAL,<br />
AND THAT THE ONLY WOMEN WE ARE CONCERNED TO HELP<br />
ARE THE MINORITY OF YOUNG, CAREER-MINDED WOMEN<br />
WITH HIGHER EDUCATION, NOTHING COULD BE FURTHER<br />
FROM THE TRUTH, I DON'T THINK EVEN THE MOST<br />
RADICAL WOMEN'S ORGANISATION WOULD WANT TO<br />
FORCE WOMEN INTO ANY ROLE THAT THEY WOULDN'T CHOOSE<br />
FOR THEMSELVES, IT MAY WELL BE TRUE THAT IF THEY<br />
WERE COMPLETELY FREE TO CHOOSE, MOST WOMEN TODAY<br />
WOULD CHOOSE THE TRADITIONAL ROLE TO BE WIVES, TO<br />
BE MOTHERS, TO STAY AT HOME, WOMEN WHO CHOOSE<br />
THOSE ROLES, THOSE HONOURABLE ROLES, HAVE AS MUCH<br />
RIGHT TO HELP AND GUIDANCE AS ANYONE ELSE, THE<br />
POINT IS TH; AT WOMEN SHOULD BE FREE TO MAKE THEIR<br />
CHOICE; THEY SHOULD HAVE EXACTLY THE SAME<br />
OPPORTUNITIES AS MEN TO EDUCATION, TO HIGHLY PAID<br />
AND SATISFYING JOBS, TO POSITIONS OF RESPONSIBILITY<br />
AND PERSONAL FULFILMENT, IT IS THIS FREEDOM THAT<br />
WE WANT TO ENLARGE, ./ 3 </p>
<p>OF COURSE THE MOST OBVIOUS WAY THAT A<br />
GOVERNMENT CAN HELP WOMEN IS IN THE MATERIAL THINGS<br />
PAY AND CONDITIONS FOR WORKING WOMEN, YET EVEN<br />
THESE OBVIOUS THINGS WERE NEGLECTED FOR MANY YEARS,<br />
WITHIN DAYS OF COMING TO POWER IN DECEMBER 1972,<br />
THE GOVERNMENT :' ADE ITS ATTITUDE TO THE QUESTION<br />
OF EQUAL PAY FOR WOMEN VERY CLEAR, WE SUPPORTED<br />
THE A. C. T. U.' S CASE FOR EQUAL PAY AND THE ARBITRATION<br />
COMMISSION UNCONDITIONALLY ACCEPTED THE PRINCIPLE OF<br />
EQUAL PAY FOR WORK OF EQUAL VALUE. EQUAL PAY FOR<br />
WOMEN UNDER FEDERAL AWARDS HAS NOW BEEN FULLY<br />
IMPLEMENTED, AND FROM THIS MONTH THE MINIMUM WAGE<br />
APPLIES EQUALLY TO WOMEN AND MENi IN ADDITION, WE<br />
HAVE VASTLY IMPROED THE STATUS AND OPPORTUNITIES OF<br />
WOMEN IN THE FIELD OF EMPLOYMENT WHERE WE HAVE FULL<br />
RESPONSIBILITY AS A GOVERNMENT IN THE AUSTRALIAN<br />
PUBLIC SERVICE, ,1/ 4 </p>
<p>4,<br />
UIT THIS IS A VERY SMALL PART OF THE<br />
PROBLEM, IN BRISBANE TWO YEARS AGO, IN ONE OF MY<br />
FIRST SPEECHES ON THIS SUBJECT, I SAID THIS:<br />
HAVE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE INEQUALITY OF WOMEN<br />
IN SOCIETY IS DEEPLY EMBEDDED NOT JUST IN THE<br />
INSTITUTIONS BUT IN THE PSYCHOLOGY OF THE SOCIETY,,,<br />
IT'S THAT PSYCHOLOGY, THOSE OLD HABITS OF THINKING,<br />
THAT REALLY MAKE THINGS DIFFICULT FOR WOMEN. THERE'S<br />
THE FEELING, FOR EXAMPLE, THAT GIRLS SHOULD HAVE A<br />
DIFFERENT SORT OF EDUCATION FROM BOYS THAT THEY<br />
SHOULDN'T AIM TOO HIGH, THAT THEY SHOULD STICK TO<br />
CERTAIN SUBJECTS AND LEAVE SCHOOL EARLIER AS INDEED,<br />
3T GIRLS DO, THAT JUST ISN'T GOOD ENOUGH; AND THE<br />
SCHOOLS CMISSION WHICH MY GOVERNMENT ESTABLISHED<br />
IS CURRENTLY SEEKING TO REMOVE DISTINCTIONS IN BOYS'<br />
AND GIRLS' SCHCOLING AND PUT THE EMPHASIS ON RAISING<br />
THE ASPIRATIONS OF GIRLS, WE ARE ALSO ENGAGED IN<br />
A STUDY CALLED fIMOE N AND PLANNING, IT'S INVESTIGATING<br />
ALL THE OBVICUS AND NOT-SO-OBVIOUS RESTRICTIONS ON<br />
WOMEN S OPPORTUNITIES IN THE WORKFORCE, IN<br />
SHOPPING AND RECREATION FACILITIESt IN HEALTH AND<br />
WELFARE SERVICES AND TRANSPORT, </p>
<p>i 2E REALISTIC WE HAVE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT<br />
THE GREATEST HELP iWE CAN GIVE TO WOMEN AND NOT JUST<br />
WORKING WOMEN IS IN THE CARE OF BABIES AND YOUNG<br />
CHILDREN, GOOD SCHOOLS AND HOSPITALS AND MEDICAL<br />
SERVICES AREN'T SUFFICIENT IN THEMSELVES THERE<br />
MUST BE SPECIAL PROVISION FOR CHILDREN OF PRE-SCHOOL<br />
AGE, THIS YEAR WE SET UP THE CHILDREN'S COMMISSION<br />
TO ADMINISTER A COMPREHENSIVE RANGE OF SERVICES FOR<br />
CHILDREN PRE-SCHOOL, DAY CARE, PART-TIME AND<br />
EMERGENCY CARE SERVICES, AFTER SCHOOL AND HOLIDAY<br />
PROJECTS, ~ ELL OVER 100,000 CHILDREN HAVE BEEN<br />
CATERED FOR ALREADY UNDER THIS PROGRAM, IN<br />
QUEENSLAND IN THE LAST FINANCIAL YEAR WE PROVIDED<br />
MORE THAN $ S5 MILLION TO MEET THE COST OF STAFF IN<br />
PRE-SCHOCLS A. D PLAY CENTRES OPERATED BY LOCAL<br />
GOVERNMENT BODIES AND COMMUNITY GROUPS AND TO HELP<br />
ESTABLISH 77 NEW PRE-SCHOOL CENTRES THROUGHOUT THE<br />
STATE, THIS -ON1EY HAS BEEN PAID THROUGH THE STATE<br />
GOVERNMENT, i: TOP OF THAT WE HAVE MADE DIRECT GRANTS<br />
TOWARDS THE COST OF OTHER CHILD CARE CENTRES. WE<br />
BELIEVE THAT EVERY AUSTRALIAN CHILD SHOULD HAVE THE RIGHT<br />
TO A PRE-SCHOOL EDUCATION, EVERY MOTHER WHO NEEDS OR<br />
WANTS CHILD CARE FACILITIES SHOULD HAVE THEM. THESE<br />
THINGS SHOULDN T BE PRIVILEGES FOR THOSE WHO CAN PAY, </p>
