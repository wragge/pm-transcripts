EMBARGO:-NOT TO BE CABLED? BROADCAST<br />
OR PUBLITSHED BEFORE THE CONCLUSION OF<br />
THE PRESS CONFERENCE IN CANBERRA ON<br />
THURSDAY, APRIL 26TH.<br />
BRITAIN AND THE COMMON MARKET<br />
Statement by the Deputy Prime Minister and<br />
Minister for Trade, the Rt. Hon. John McEwen<br />
Mr. McEwen said today that the intensive discussions<br />
on which he had been engaged abroad had fully confirmed his<br />
earlier judgment that many Australian export industries could<br />
be faced with immense problems if Britain joined the European<br />
Common Market without special arrangements to protect our<br />
interests. Mr. McEwen was speaking on his return from a seven weeks<br />
visit to North America and Europe. in the course of his<br />
overseas journey, Mr. McEwen visited Washington, Ottawa, London<br />
and the capitals of the member states of the European Economic<br />
Community. He said that he had talked with President Kennedy,<br />
Mr. Macmillan, President de Gaulle, Mr. Diefenbaker and<br />
senior Ministers in all the countries which he had visited.<br />
In London he had several meetings with the group of senior<br />
British Ministers handling the Common Market negotiations. In<br />
Brussels Mr. McEwen also had discussions with Professor Hallstein,<br />
President of the European Economic Commission and Mr. Mansb-olt,<br />
Vice-President responsible for agricultural matters within the<br />
Common Market.<br />
" As I made clear before I left Australia", Mr. YcEwen<br />
said, " I was not myself engaged in negotiations. Australia<br />
is not a party to the Brussels negotiations. We are, however,<br />
vitally concerned with many aspects of them. My task was to<br />
ensure that at the highest possible political level the critical<br />
issues at stake for Australia were fully understood by those<br />
Government leaders whose views and policies would determine the<br />
outcome of the negotiations". Mr. McEwen said </p>
<p>, Mr. McEwen said that his discussions had been frank and<br />
uninhibited. " I explained very clearly," he said, " that the<br />
Australian Government greatly valued a unified, strong and<br />
prosperous Europe. The Rome Treaty had this as an objective.<br />
We believe that the accession of Britain to the Common Market<br />
could contribute to this objective. As a staunch and unwavering<br />
partner of the Western allies, Australia, no less than the<br />
European countries themselves, welcomed any development which<br />
strengthened the free world as a whole".<br />
" But I made it equally clear", the Minister continued,<br />
" that our Government's view was that the strength and unity of<br />
the West, far from being strengthened, could be seriously impaired.<br />
if the British Commonwealth were divided and its members<br />
weakened by a failure to take into account and accommodate the<br />
vital interests of Commonwealth countries in the maintenance of<br />
their long standing trade and economic ties with Britain"<br />
Mr. Mc~ wen said he had explained that Australia's rights<br />
of unrestricted duty free entry into the British market for most<br />
of our export products had been in existence for more than a<br />
hundred years. The contractual arrangements under which reciprocal<br />
tariff preferences are provided have extended over thirty years.<br />
Many of our great primary industries had been developed as a<br />
deliberate consequence of our contractual rights, and some of them<br />
were crucially dependent upon their preferential access to the<br />
British market for their survival as profitable industries. Some<br />
secondary industries had succeeded in penetrating the British<br />
market with the benefit of preferences.<br />
If Britain should join the Common Market without special<br />
arrangements being made to safeguard Australian interests, there<br />
would be damage to Australian industries at present exporting to<br />
Britain products valued at about Å 160 million a year. Many would<br />
be seriously affected. Commodities affected include wheat and<br />
other grains; butter, cheese and processed milk products; meats;<br />
sugar; fresh, canned and dried fruits; wine; lead and zinc; some<br />
/ manufactured </p>
<p>-3-<br />
manufactured goods and a whole range of agricultural products.-and<br />
processed foodstuffs. Instead of these goods entering the<br />
British market free of duty, as they do now in almost all cases,<br />
they would have tariff duties and import levies charged against<br />
them. They would lose the important tariff preferences nearly all<br />
of them now enjoy against non-Commonwealth suppliers.<br />
The Minister said he had emphasised in his talks that what<br />
was at stake for Aus tralia was not just a matter of the possible<br />
loss of export earnings although this in itself was a matter of<br />
real importance since Australia's economic growth and development<br />
was heavily dependent upon our ability to expand our export<br />
receipts. The real issue at stake was the future livelihood of those<br />
Australians farmers, miners and factory workers whose-products---<br />
are largely exported to Britain. Indeed, even manufacturing<br />
industry supplying the home market could be affected if our<br />
capacity to earn foreign exchange becomes insufficient to provide<br />
us with all the raw materials, components and plant which our<br />
factories need to maintain their production. The future of whole<br />
communities, such as the towns and cities of the sugar producing<br />
areas, and the irrigation districts, and isolated mining centres,<br />
were deeply involved. In the end result, few Australians would<br />
not be affected one way or another.<br />
Mr. McEwen said he had explained that these were the kind of<br />
problems which the Brussels negotiations raised for-Australi-a. He<br />
had pointed out that the opportunities and advantages we had<br />
enjoyed for so long were not a one-sided affair. They were<br />
balanced by the reciprocal tariff preferences which Britainen -oyPd<br />
in the Australian market and which in total over forty years had<br />
resulted in Australia, despite our small population, being the<br />
biggest single market for British goods, consequently providing<br />
more jobs in British factories than any other country. " Over the<br />
decade of the 1950' s", Mr. McEwen said, " each Austra. Lian-. bought an<br />
average of Å 34 worth of British goods a year. The people living<br />
in the Common </p>
<p>-4-<br />
in the Common Market countries bought about Å 3 worth per head<br />
a year from Britain and United States citizens bought less than<br />
Å 2 worth". Mr. McEwen said that these were the facts and circumstances<br />
which made Britain's application for membership of the Common<br />
Market of such historic importance for Australia and Australians.<br />
His task had been to ensure that Government leaders in Europe<br />
and in the United States understood the stark realities of the<br />
situation for us.<br />
" Despite the unremitting efforts which the Government has<br />
made since the possibility of Britain joining the Common Market<br />
emerged for the first time in the middle of last year, I found<br />
that many of the Government leaders to whom I talked did not fully<br />
comprehend our position. I am confident that my discussions<br />
succeeded in registering with them very clearly the strength of the<br />
argument why the interests of Australia and other Commonwealth<br />
countries in the British market should not be impaired. Without<br />
exception, I found that as a result of my explanation of our<br />
circumstances, there was a much better understanding of our case<br />
and, I believe, a more sympathetic comprehension of our problems."<br />
" Nevertheless", Mr. McEwen said, " lam bound to say that I<br />
am far from satisfied that this genuine sympathy and understanding<br />
will necessarily be translated into practical arrangements to<br />
adequately safeguard our interests. From the outset of the<br />
negotiations the British Govenment has said that it would not<br />
feel able to enter the Common Market unless important Commonwealth<br />
trading interests were protected. This, of course, is of tremendous<br />
importance and only time will tell whether the special<br />
arrangements necessary to give effect to this declaration can be<br />
secured from the Common Market Governments"<br />
Mr. McEwen said one of the most disturbing elements in this<br />
very complex situation was the American attitude towards the<br />
retention of the British preferential trading system which was so<br />
vital to </p>
<p>vital to Australia and to the continued unity and strength of the<br />
Commonwealth. Despite the strong representations which he had<br />
made in Washington, he was unable to say with any real confidence<br />
that the pervasive influence of the United States in Europe would<br />
not operate towards the disidantlement of the existing Commonwealth<br />
preferential system in its own self-interest.<br />
' lthough United States spokesmen had said that some<br />
transitional period of adjustment was necessary, the United States<br />
Government appeared to be clearly against what it vwould regard as<br />
the continuation of the preferential system through special<br />
arrangements made to meet Commonwealth trade problems if Britain<br />
wore to join the Common Market.<br />
Mr. McEwven said that A. ustralia would not be tranquilised<br />
with transitional arrangements. These would be no concession<br />
to Australia. The Europeans were arranging this as a matter<br />
of course between themselves. He was concerned with permanent<br />
arrangements that would safeguard Australia's vital trade<br />
interests and allow the necessary economiic development to continue<br />
without serious setback.<br />
Moreover, he had put forward forcibly the view that the<br />
which was the main instrument of the United States'<br />
post-war trade policies and which stood for no new preferences,<br />
recognised and accepted the existing preferential structure.<br />
If it had not done so, Australia would never have joined the<br />
G. A. T. T. Neither would any other Commonwealth country; and<br />
the G. A. T. T. would probably not have come into being.<br />
He had argued that Australia and countries similarly<br />
placed already had a sense of frustration about the disparity<br />
of trading opportunities between the highly industrialised<br />
countries on the one hand and exporters of primary products on<br />
the other. This must inevitably turn to a sense of real<br />
grievance if the United States were to use the incident of<br />
Britain's application to join the Common Market to seek to kill<br />
our preferences and obtain profit in the process by benefitting at the </p>
<p>-6-<br />
at the expense of our trade in the United Kingdom, and British<br />
trade in our market.<br />
Tdr. McEwen said that his arrival in Europe had been timed<br />
to enable him to press the Australian Government's desire to have<br />
its own representative explain to the officials conducting the<br />
negotiations in Brussels the facts of Australia's trade interests<br />
in the British market, and the vital importance to Australia that<br />
these interests should be preserved. This opportunity had been<br />
secured and the case was in fact being put today in Brussels to<br />
the negotiating Committee of the Common Market and Britain by<br />
Dr. Westerman, Permanent Head of the Department of Trade.<br />
Mric. McEwen said that the decision of the E. E. C. Ministers<br />
to invite an Australian representative to present the Australian<br />
position fully justified the stand which the Australian Government<br />
had consistently taken that no-one could put the case for<br />
Australia as well as Australia itself.<br />
Mr. McEvien said that the Australian approach to the<br />
negotia'tions--in--Bruss-elIs has always been positive and constructive.<br />
He said that in his talks in Europe and elsewhere he had discussedthe<br />
kind of arrangements which might not only protect Australia's<br />
trade interests but should be acceptable to the Common Market<br />
countries and to third countries such as the United States.<br />
Possible arrangements had been discussed with representatives of<br />
major Australian industries, which the Government had arranged to<br />
go to London to provide practical assistance to Dr. Westerman in<br />
the preparation of the Australian case. Mr. IdcEwen said he was<br />
grateful for the co-operation of the industry advisers and the<br />
assistance which their knowledge would bring to bear on the many<br />
problems involved.<br />
Mr. McEwen said that he would be making a full report on<br />
his visit to his Cabinet colleagues early next week, after which<br />
he expected to make a statement to Parliament. 53/ 62T.<br />
