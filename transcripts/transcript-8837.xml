II I, 7020 PRIME MINISTER<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE RON P J KEATING MP<br />
HEWSON AND RuITH AND THE TOURISM TRAVESTY<br />
on the 25th of February, the Shadow Treasurer, Mr Reith,<br />
released a statement in which he said that the Coalition<br />
envisaged employment growth in the tourism industry " of<br />
more than 6 per cent per annum, generating around 400,000<br />
extra jobs based on quite reasonable estimates of<br />
million tourists by the end of the decade."<br />
At best, this is fanciful arithmetic.<br />
6 per cent growth in the tourism industry will create<br />
275,000 new jobs, not 400,000.<br />
Dr Hewson repeated the fallacy in the debate last night.<br />
Dr Hewson repeated the Coalition's-forecast of 400,000<br />
extra tourism jobs and 10 million tourists by the year<br />
2000. More fanciful arithmetic.<br />
million tourists would represent a growth rate of 17<br />
to 18 per cent 50 per cent more than the peak in the<br />
19809, and that was without a CST.<br />
No one in the tourism industry is predicting growth as<br />
high as 12 per cent. The forecasts are for up to 6.8<br />
million. A CST would lead to these forecasts being revised down.<br />
mhe introduction of a 7 per cent GST caused Canada to<br />
drop from the fourth favourite international destination<br />
of tourists to the twelfth. In New Zealand, the number<br />
of international tourists also dieclined, and what is<br />
more, . the number of New Zealanders taking their holidays<br />
outside Now Zealand increased by well over 100 per cent,<br />
as they took advantage of * GST-Free" packages.<br />
Tourism is a classic example of the deception the<br />
Coalition is practising in an effort to sell its<br />
" plan".<br />
The GST will tax tourism and restrict itsgrowth. it<br />
will reduce the number of jobs not increase them. </p>
<p>2<br />
Dr Howson and Mr Reith have plucked their figures out of<br />
the air: the 400,000 tourism jobs, the 10 million new<br />
tourists, the 2 million jobs by the year 2000. Their<br />
arithmetic in wrong too wrong to escape the inference<br />
that it is also deliberately deceitful.<br />
