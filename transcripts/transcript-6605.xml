I believe that these women are an outstanding group of<br />
representatives for Australia. They are from wide and<br />
diverse backgrounds including women from remote and<br />
country areas as well as cities, and from all States and<br />
Territories. In calling for applications for assistance earlier this<br />
year, the Government announced three special target<br />
groups women from non-English speaking backgrounds, </p>
<p>Aboriginal women, and young women. It also announced<br />
that special consideration would be given to women<br />
lacking access to other sources of financial support to<br />
attend the Forum.<br />
I am very happy that more than half the women selected<br />
are from these target groups.<br />
I am particularly pleased that four young women have<br />
been selected as 1985 is International Youth Year. It<br />
is also the end of the UN Decade for Women, and will<br />
provide these young women, who were barely in their<br />
teens when the Decade began, with the opportunity. to<br />
participate in and learn from the experiences of the<br />
Decade, and carry its impetus on to their new<br />
generation. The Forum is one of two meetings of women from around<br />
the world to be held in Nairobi in July this year. It<br />
is organised by and for individual women and women from<br />
non-government organisations. Its themes are " Equality,<br />
Development and Peace", and it will f6cus on progress<br />
for women in the fields of employment, health and<br />
education, with special attention to the problems of<br />
rural women, the majority of whom live in developing<br />
countries. The other meeting to be held in Nairobi in July is the<br />
World Conference to Review and Appraise the Achievements<br />
of the United Nations Decade for Women: Equality,<br />
Development, Peace. This is a conference of government<br />
representatives organised by the United Nations, and the<br />
Australian Government will be sending an official<br />
delegation of about 15 members.<br />
The composition of that delegation will be announced<br />
soon. Unlike the delegation sent by the previous<br />
Government to the Mid-Decade Conference in Copenhagen in<br />
1980, the delegation to Nairobi will be led by a woman<br />
and the majority of its members will consist of women in<br />
senior and responsible positions in public life in<br />
Australia. </p>
