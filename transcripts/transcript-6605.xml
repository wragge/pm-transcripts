<p>I believe that these women are an outstanding group of representatives for Australia. They are from wide and diverse backgrounds including women from remote and country areas as well as cities, and from all States and Territories. In calling for applications for assistance earlier this year, the Government announced three special target groups women from non-English speaking backgrounds,</p>
<p>Aboriginal women, and young women. It also announced that special consideration would be given to women lacking access to other sources of financial support to attend the Forum.</p>
<p> I am very happy that more than half the women selected are from these target groups.</p>
<p> I am particularly pleased that four young women have been selected as 1985 is International Youth Year. It is also the end of the UN Decade for Women, and will provide these young women, who were barely in their teens when the Decade began, with the opportunity. to participate in and learn from the experiences of the Decade, and carry its impetus on to their new generation.</p>
<p>The Forum is one of two meetings of women from around the world to be held in Nairobi in July this year. It is organised by and for individual women and women from non-government organisations. Its themes are " Equality, Development and Peace", and it will f6cus on progress for women in the fields of employment, health and education, with special attention to the problems of rural women, the majority of whom live in developing countries.</p>
<p>The other meeting to be held in Nairobi in July is the World Conference to Review and Appraise the Achievements of the United Nations Decade for Women: Equality, Development, Peace. This is a conference of government representatives organised by the United Nations, and the Australian Government will be sending an official delegation of about 15 members.</p>
<p> The composition of that delegation will be announced soon. Unlike the delegation sent by the previous Government to the Mid-Decade Conference in Copenhagen in 1980, the delegation to Nairobi will be led by a woman and the majority of its members will consist of women in senior and responsible positions in public life in Australia.</p>
