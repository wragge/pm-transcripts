<p>E&amp;OE...........  </p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>In the interests of national security I have to ask you, what have you done to your head?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>The results of jousting with the Gallery.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, there';s also an announcement today on the increased immigration intake.  Why is increased immigration and skilled migration important for Australia?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>At a time of very strong economic growth, we believe that this increase will be good for the economy.  But there';s an emphasis on skilled migration.  It';s a measured increase and I think it strikes the balance between harvesting the benefits of increased skilled migration, while at the same time taking care to ensure that the rate is not such as to impose too great a strain on the environment or all the other things you take into account.  As with so many of these things, it';s a question of striking a balance and we have struck the right balance.  It';s a measured increase, it will be beneficial economically and it will certainly add to the skills diversification of the Australian community.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>â¦..an immigration related assassination in the Netherlands.  Are you concerned about immigration levels increasing social tensions in Australia?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I wouldn';t want for a moment to connect a tragic event in the Netherlands with immigration in Australia.  I mean there is no connection at all.  I am naturally disturbed that something like that could happen in a peaceful, democratic, harmonious country such as the Netherlands.  And it';s just a reminder that within every community there is an element of individual fanaticism that can strike unexpectedly despite the apparent calm and the apparent harmony.  But I don';t see any connection at all between that event and debate about immigration and debate about cultural issues in this country, no connection at all.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Aung San Suu Kyi, what';s your reaction to her release?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I welcome the decision of the military regime in Burma to release her.  She';s been a courageous, inspirational figure to many people.  She has suffered a lot.  It';s important that other political prisoners in Burma now be released, there are hundreds of them and we do welcome it very warmly.  We have, along with other countries, been advocating her release for a very long time and we hope that it';s the harbinger of other decisions taken by the authorities that will eventually return Burma to democracy.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p> Prime Minister, yesterday you launched a book by the Business Council of Australia, talking about GST and raising the rate and broadening the base.  Launching the book, does that mean that you endorse those ideas?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Of course I don';t.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Then can you rule it out?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Absolutely.  Come on, I mean is this the latest Latham diversion is it, from Mr Crean?</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>While on that subject, Mark Latham says that he has gone far enough towards an apology towards Mr Staley.  Do you accept that?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No I don';t.  I think it';s very unfortunate that he made those remarks and he should be a man and apologise.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>And what should Simon Crean do?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well he should insist that he apologise.  I mean when Senator Heffernan';s allegations were found to be insubstantially based, I required him to apologise and I also dismissed him.  Mr Crean should do the same thing.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST: </p>
<p>â¦the reports this morning about the Defence department having 300 million dollars in reserves?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I haven';t seen those reports.  But if you look at the budget next Tuesday night, you will see a very substantial additional allocation of money for defence, which is very understandable in the light of our strategic and military position.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>The department';s been crying poor (inaudible)</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER: </p>
<p>Look I haven';t seen the report so I can';t comment on it.  Thankyou.</p>
