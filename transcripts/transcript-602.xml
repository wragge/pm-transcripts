P. M. No. 64/ 1962<br />
MINISTERIAL ARRLANGEME~ NTS<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister, Rt. Hon. R. G, Menzies<br />
Parliament has now gone into recess until October<br />
to enable Ministers and senior members of the Opposition<br />
to take part in lmportr~ nt discussions overseas on the<br />
proposed British entry into the European Economic Community.<br />
I regret that Mr0Caiwell is not suf~ ficiently<br />
recovered from his recent illness to be able to make the<br />
journey overseas at this time.<br />
I have made Ministerial arrangements to meet<br />
the situation during the recess when other senior Ministers<br />
and I will be absent from Australia. Both Mr. McEwen<br />
and Mr. Holt will accompany me to the meeting of Commonwealth<br />
Prime Ministers in London where the proposed British<br />
entry into the Common Market will be the principal matter<br />
for discussion0 Mr. Halt will go on to the meetings of the<br />
International Monetary F'und, the International Bank and<br />
the International Finance Corporation in Washington,,<br />
In addition to these meetings the General Assembly<br />
of the United Nations will open in Now York in mid-September<br />
and Sir Garfield Barwick will lead the Australian delegation.<br />
While these Ministers are away from Australia<br />
and the Parliament is not sitting, the following acting<br />
arrangements will apply<br />
Senator Spooner as Acting Prime Minister<br />
Senator Henty as Acting Minister for<br />
Trade<br />
Senator Paltridge as Acting Treasurer<br />
Senator Gorton as Acting Minister for<br />
External Affairs<br />
Mr, Freeth as Acting Attorney-General.<br />
CANBERRA, 31st August, 1962. </p>
