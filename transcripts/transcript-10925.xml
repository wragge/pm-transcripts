<p>Mr Sinclair, Mr Jones, fellow delegates and guests. I suppose, in</p>
<p> a sense, we are all speeched out and we have another eight or nine</p>
<p> days of debate and discussion ahead of us. But I thought as we reminisced,</p>
<p> many of us who'd sat in the famous old chamber in which we met</p>
<p> today, we reminisced about the events that took place there and my</p>
<p> mind and my experience of that chamber goes back to the election of</p>
<p> May of 1974. And of course, that experience encumbered some of the</p>
<p> dramatic and traumatic, for some, for most, events of recent Australian</p>
<p> political history. I must say, the very impressive parliamentary main</p>
<p> of Gough Whitlam who was Prime Minister when I first came into parliament:</p>
<p> the confrontations that followed between he and Malcolm Fraser; the</p>
<p> removal in rather unexpected, spectacular terms of Jim Cope, the Speaker.</p>
<p> And then, of course, the dramatic events of November of 1975.</p>
<p>As I wandered along the corridors of the old building I thought of</p>
<p> the odd Liberal Party ballot that had taken place in the Opposition</p>
<p> Party Room. And, of course, the real reason why, ladies and gentlemen,</p>
<p> we are having this convention in the Old Parliament House is that</p>
<p> for long years I coveted the Prime Minister's office in the corner</p>
<p> of this building and, of course, unfortunately, we had moved to a</p>
<p> new place before I finally aspired to the office. So I thought some</p>
<p> kind of occupation by surrogacy through this convention was probably</p>
<p> not a bad idea.</p>
<p>And I think of the tremendous parliamentary battles that I had with</p>
<p> Bill Hayden. And, I guess, as I looked around at the gathering of</p>
<p> current and former members of parliament of two on opposite sides,</p>
<p> I guess of those that are here as delegates, Bill and I would have</p>
<p> probably faced each other more, and more intensely and more passionately</p>
<p> on different issues, he as Opposition Leader and I, as Treasurer,</p>
<p> between 1977 and 1982.</p>
<p>But, of course, it is not only the house that has great memories.</p>
<p> It is also this dining room which was the scene of many a parliamentary</p>
<p> gathering. My first experience was a farewell dinner to the former</p>
<p> Governor-General, the late Paul Hasluck. I had reason to reflect later</p>
<p> that perhaps some might have wanted that farewell dinner to be have</p>
<p> been delayed by four or five years.</p>
<p>But, I also think back to another of the very early dinners I attended</p>
<p> here. It wasn't quite his last ride but it was a dinner attended</p>
<p> in honour of the visiting Tsar of Iran in 1974. But I have to say</p>
<p> that probably the last official luncheon or dinner that I attended</p>
<p> here was a most extraordinary one. Believe it or not it was tendered,</p>
<p> I hasten to say, by the Hawke Government of course, in honour of the</p>
<p> late but not lamented President and dictator of Romania, Nicolae Ceausescu.</p>
<p> It does seem strange but it happened. He came. I have got to say that</p>
<p> Bob in his inimitable style said: "oh well, it was arranged by</p>
<p> one of my predecessors and you know, John, I had to sort of pick up</p>
<p> the hospitality".</p>
<p>But I will never forget that lunch. I came around and I was Opposition</p>
<p> Leader and Bob Hawke was Prime Minister and he said: "I don't</p>
<p> know what we are doing with this bloke here". And he said: "How</p>
<p> are we going to get through it". And I said: ÂWell look,</p>
<p> let's see if we can sort of do a bit of a double, let's</p>
<p> see if each of us can avoid mentioning him'. And it was a most</p>
<p> extraordinary performance. It has to be the first time in the history</p>
<p> of Australian parliamentary hospitality that we actually, the Prime</p>
<p> Minister and Opposition Leader, actually went through a lunch without</p>
<p> mentioning the guest of honour, or his wife for that matter.</p>
<p>Jones, I am indebted for your interjection. Or his wife. And how did</p>
<p> we do it? Well, Bob Hawke, to his great credit told a story about</p>
<p> a great Labor figure whose anglicised name was E.G. Theodore. I thought</p>
<p> that was pretty impressive and he talked about, you know, this and</p>
<p> that inquiry and he talked about this and that contribution to fiscal</p>
<p> policy and this or that contribution to the Queensland Labor Party</p>
<p> and it was a marvellous little story. And at the end, he sat down,</p>
<p> everybody clapped and I thought what-on-earth am I going to do because</p>
<p> I had to support his remarks and I didn't know as much about</p>
<p> E.G. Theodore as Bob Hawke. So I spotted Lang Hancock in the audience.</p>
<p> And Lang, of course was well known for entering into a bit of barter</p>
<p> with those in Romania. So I spoke, I think, eloquently about the economic</p>
<p> virtues of barter, about how it was really a tremendous substitute</p>
<p> for economic rationalism.</p>
<p>So the lunch ended and Bob said: "Gee, that wasn't bad".</p>
<p> I thought we had made a very good unity ticket on that particular</p>
<p> occasion. So it was a very memorable last luncheon and certainly the</p>
<p> last one that I remember in this marvellous old dining room, which</p>
<p> I must say is rather spunkier than it was now on many occasions when</p>
<p> we dined in it before. But it carries very great memories for a lot</p>
<p> of us, in a personal sense but it also carries great memories in a</p>
<p> collective, national sense.</p>
<p>There is something rather special about today and tonight. It is an</p>
<p> extraordinary gathering of Australians, an extraordinary gathering</p>
<p> of humanity and whatever may be our views there is immense good will.</p>
<p> And I am now going to invite you, and I assure you this will cause</p>
<p> nobody any embarrassment. I am going to invite you to join me in an</p>
<p> utterly uncontroversial toast. So I invite you all to charge your</p>
<p> glasses and be upstanding and I invite you...No, it is utterly uncontroversial.</p>
<p> Now, do you think for a moment that I would let any of you down? I</p>
<p> invite all of you to join me in a toast to the land we love, Australia.</p>
<p>Thank you very much.</p>
