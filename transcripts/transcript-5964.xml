BUDGET INFORMATION PROGRAM<br />
( Statement by the Acting Prime Minister<br />
the Rt Hon. J. D. Anthony, M. P.)<br />
An information program aimed at ensuring Australians<br />
are aware of benefits they are entitled to under the 1982 Budget<br />
will start this weekend.<br />
Television messages, beginning on Sunday night, will<br />
highlight the main Budget measures which came into effect this<br />
month. They include cuts in personal tax, home loan interest<br />
rebates and changes in Social Security benefit conditions. The<br />
public will also be alerted to increased assistance to youth<br />
through student schemes and work experience programs.<br />
The television messages ar~ e designed to alert as many<br />
people as possible to their entitlements.<br />
Detailed information about these entitlements will be<br />
given in press advertising starting on Monday, and in complementary<br />
radio advertisements expected to start : the same day.<br />
Supporting the press advertising on housing, information<br />
pamphlets on housing will be made available to help people<br />
dealing with the public on housing matters be better able to<br />
advise their clients.<br />
The information program is expected to cost a total<br />
of about $ 2 million. It will be conducted jointly by the<br />
Treasury and the Departments of Education, Employment and<br />
Industrial Relations, Industry and Commerce and Social Security.<br />
The Government believes it has a responsibility to<br />
do all it can to ensure that those who should benefit from<br />
Budget programs know what to do to claim thosebenefits and<br />
that this responsibility is even more pressing where the needy<br />
and deprived are concerned.<br />
The use of television and radio in the program is in<br />
line with recommendations of the Task Force on Departmental<br />
Information dealing with disadvantaged persons.<br />
In addition, the need for an information program has<br />
been recognised by the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate,<br />
Senator Button, and the Opposition Spokesman on Social Welfare,<br />
Senator Grimes.<br />
