    <content><![CDATA[<p>E&amp;OE..................</p>
<p>  Thank you very much Peter Lavis. To Louise Asher, the Minister for Small</p>
<p>   Business, to Carol Schwartz, your national president, Peter Clarke, other</p>
<p>   distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen. I want to thank the Property</p>
<p>   Council for inviting me here today to give to me an opportunity on behalf</p>
<p>   of the Government to share some thoughts, and I hope also aspirations I</p>
<p>   have about the future economic and political landscape of Australia.</p>
<p>  It's not a bad time to be talking to a business audience about the state</p>
<p>   of the Australian economy, nor indeed about the prospects that lie ahead</p>
<p>   of us as we come towards the end of this millennium. Of the many memorable</p>
<p>   things he said, Franklin Roosevelt just after he was inaugurated as President</p>
<p>   of the United States in the early 1930s, I think he used words to the effect</p>
<p>   that we have nothing to fear but fear itself. And that was an injunction</p>
<p>   delivered to a nation and world that was very battered down and weary by</p>
<p>   the ravages of the great depression. How different the circumstances are</p>
<p>   now, particularly here in Australia against the background of a world economy</p>
<p>   which is working better I believe than it has probably at any time since</p>
<p>   the end of World War II. And particularly against the background of the</p>
<p>   American economy which is displaying an incredible level of resilience and</p>
<p>   strength.</p>
<p>  And if I could perhaps borrow for today's circumstances those words of Roosevelt</p>
<p>   and to make the observation that just because we are performing well at</p>
<p>   the present time, and just because by any measure the recovery in Australia</p>
<p>   and the strong growth in Australia has continued longer than most people</p>
<p>   expected, that is no reason to fear for a moment that if we follow the right</p>
<p>   policies we can enjoy a continuation of that strong growth and that great</p>
<p>   stability of the Australian economy. I suppose that the many things that</p>
<p>   have been said about me in my political career, I've probably never been</p>
<p>   accused too often as being reckless, or indifferent about the need to take</p>
<p>   caution. I am appropriately cautious about certain things. I don't believe</p>
<p>   in changing something that works well, but I do believe very strongly in</p>
<p>   embracing change, even radical change, for those institutions, practices,</p>
<p>   and attitudes within the Australian community that ought to be changed.</p>
<p>   And the message that I want to leave with you today above everything else</p>
<p>   is that the strong state of the Australian economy in 1999 is not the product</p>
<p>   of inadvertence, it is not the product just of luck, it is the product of</p>
<p>   a number of fundamental changes and reforms that have been implemented in</p>
<p>   our economy over the last 10 to 15 years. And I've always been willing in</p>
<p>   looking back over the history of the Australian economy, where appropriate</p>
<p>   to give credit to changes that were introduced by our predecessors in government.</p>
<p>   And in one or two areas changes implemented by our predecessors have made</p>
<p>   a very material contribution to the strength and stability of the Australian</p>
<p>   economy today.</p>
<p>  But very particularly the strength we have at the moment, the fact that</p>
<p>   we are without any doubt the strongest performing economy amongst the OECD</p>
<p>   countries, and I never tire of saying that of all the economic statistics</p>
<p>   of which I'm immensely proud at the moment none gives me greater pride in</p>
<p>   the fact that I can say to an audience like this, and indeed to any audience,</p>
<p>   that of the 24 member countries of the OECD the debt to GDP ratio, the government</p>
<p>   debt to GDP ratio of Australia is the lowest of the 24 member nations of</p>
<p>   the OECD. Or put another way, the burden of debt on future generations of</p>
<p>   Australians is lighter than the burden of debt on future generations of</p>
<p>   the populations of any of the other 23 member nations of the OECD. And that</p>
<p>   kind of situation delivers incalculable benefits not only to the present</p>
<p>   but also to the future.</p>
<p>  We have as you know over the last three-and-a-quarter years set our faces</p>
<p>   toward a very strong program of economic reform. We got the country out</p>
<p>   of a deficit of $10.5 billion, we have returned a surplus a year ahead of</p>
<p>   schedule. We have delivered the lowest interest rates, the lowest inflation,</p>
<p>   the steadiest levels of business investment, and an economic growth rate</p>
<p>   that in 1998 was faster than the economic growth rate of any of the G7 nations.</p>
<p>   We've done that because of a commitment to a number of fundamental reforms.</p>
<p>   It wasn't easy in the early months of government to cut back government</p>
<p>   spending. It wasn't easy in the early months of government to tackle industrial</p>
<p>   relations reform. We faced a titanic, [inaudible], and industrial battle</p>
<p>   when we set out to reform the Australian waterfront. And most importantly</p>
<p>   of all and most contemporaneously of all, we have embraced the most fundamental</p>
<p>   and sweeping reform of Australia's taxation system certainly since World</p>
<p>   War II.</p>
<p>  And the value of that reform will endure for years into the future. And</p>
<p>   although we didn't achieve 100% of what the Australian people voted for</p>
<p>   in October of last year, we have achieved through the deal that we made</p>
<p>   with the Australian Democrats something like 85 to 90% of the promises we</p>
<p>   took to the Australian public. And the structural value of that reform is</p>
<p>   immense. It will lower the fundamental cost structure of the Australian</p>
<p>   economy. It will make our exports cheaper. It will reduce our domestic business</p>
<p>   costs. It will lower the price of fuel and that's very important to a nation</p>
<p>   that's physical as large as Australia. It will deliver to 80% of Australian</p>
<p>   taxpayers a top marginal rate of no more than 30 cents in the dollar, and</p>
<p>   it will guarantee over time rising levels of revenue and a stronger revenue</p>
<p>   base for the States of Australia to provide the basic services which are</p>
<p>   their responsibility.</p>
<p>  And as all of you will know, that follow political debate in this country,</p>
<p>   you'll be aware that one of the great political pantomimes of Australia</p>
<p>   have been the annual gatherings between the Prime Minister and the Premiers</p>
<p>   in Canberra. It doesn't matter who the Prime Minister's been, it doesn't</p>
<p>   matter who the State Premiers it has been, it doesn't matter whether it's</p>
<p>   Labor or Liberal, it's been the same for decades. The Premiers go along</p>
<p>   and demand more money. The Commonwealth says they can't afford to give them</p>
<p>   any more money because they're already over indulged and the Premiers go</p>
<p>   away complaining that they've been given a very raw deal. And that pantomime</p>
<p>   has gone on now for decades. And one of the great benefits of the deal that</p>
<p>   we now got through the Parliament, and one of the great consequences of</p>
<p>   the agreement that I signed with all of the Premiers and the Chief Ministers</p>
<p>   of the Territories, is that after the transitional phase there will be a</p>
<p>   steady growth in the revenue from the goods and services tax for all of</p>
<p>   which will go to the States of Australia. Every last dollar of the GST revenue</p>
<p>   will be committed to the States and out of that growing revenue the States</p>
<p>   will have a growing opportunity of providing the increased services in health</p>
<p>   and housing and governments schools and police which are the ongoing responsibility</p>
<p>   of State governments in Australia.</p>
<p>  But I wouldn't like, in talking for a few minutes about what we have achieved</p>
<p>   over the last three-and-a-quarter years, I wouldn't want anybody in this</p>
<p>   audience to imagine that we regard the reform process as having been completed</p>
<p>   because when you live in a global economy, and forever Australia is part</p>
<p>   of the globalised economic environment in which the whole world now exists.</p>
<p>   We don't have an option to go back to the 1950s or 1960s when we may have</p>
<p>   had good levels of prosperity, no better than they are today. But we lived</p>
<p>   then in a very protected cloistered world. We now live forever in a globalised</p>
<p>   economy. We've seen the seamless transfer of capital across borders without</p>
<p>   regard for political boundaries, matched increasingly by the seamless transfer</p>
<p>   of job opportunities. So in this globalised world you have to keep competing</p>
<p>   effectively. It is like a never ending race where you have to remain ahead</p>
<p>   of your competitor. And it's not good enough to say to yourself - well we're</p>
<p>   doing better now than we were doing five or ten years ago because how you</p>
<p>   were doing five or ten years ago amount to absolutely nothing so far as</p>
<p>   beating your rival or beating your competitor.</p>
<p>  And in that world of global competition it's essential that the process</p>
<p>   of reform go on because you never really complete the process of reform.</p>
<p>   It's like climbing one hill only to find another one facing you on the horizon.</p>
<p>   And some it is that although we have done a great deal to reform the Australian</p>
<p>   economy. Although we're in a very strong position we have a responsibility</p>
<p>   of pressing ahead with the reform process, and particularly in two areas.</p>
<p>   We need more industrial relations reform. We need it in the form of still</p>
<p>   less regulation. We need some-how-or-other to persuade the Senate to pass</p>
<p>   those laws which will remove the restrictions on unfair dismissal which</p>
<p>   ought to be removed. We also need to some-how-or-other to persuade the Australian</p>
<p>   Senate to pass the legislation that we want that will guarantee that youth</p>
<p>   wages remain part of the industrial relations landscape of Australia because</p>
<p>   by maintaining youth wages we protect the jobs of several hundred thousand</p>
<p>   young Australians. So there's still much to be done on the industrial front.</p>
<p>  But I know of particular interest to this audience, having completed the</p>
<p>   process of legislating for the GST, and everything that accompanies the</p>
<p>   goods and services tax, and now having embarked upon the process of implementing</p>
<p>   the GST reform, it is imperative that we now turn our attention to the responsibilities</p>
<p>   of business taxation reform. And it's no secret that John Ralph handed his</p>
<p>   report to Peter Costello a few days ago, and I had the opportunity here</p>
<p>   in Melbourne this morning of a lengthy discussion with Mr Ralph in relation</p>
<p>   to the report that he's delivered to the government.</p>
<p>  And I want to take a moment to record my gratitude to John Ralph, to Bob</p>
<p>   Joss, and to Rick Allet and all the other members of that committee, as</p>
<p>   indeed I share my gratitude to people like Carol Schwartz, your national</p>
<p>   president, for the willingness of people in the private sector to give up</p>
<p>   their time and to make a contribution to the making of better policy and</p>
<p>   more competitive policy for the Australian economy. Because it is quite</p>
<p>   impossible for a government acting alone with its public service advisers,</p>
<p>   with all the wisdom collectively we might try and bring to the task, is</p>
<p>   quite impossible for us acting alone to re-write effectively the business</p>
<p>   taxation system of this country.</p>
<p>  And the report that John has delivered to the government is the product</p>
<p>   of an enormous amount of work contributed very generously by the private</p>
<p>   sector of the Australian community. And the changes that will flow from</p>
<p>   that report will have long term ramifications, I believe very beneficial</p>
<p>   ones, on the operations of business in Australia. And we've got one or two</p>
<p>   very simple principles in mind as we come to address that report. And those</p>
<p>   principles really surround one or two fundamental questions. And the first</p>
<p>   of those questions is will the changes we implement make it more attractive</p>
<p>   to invest in business operations in Australia? Will the changes make Australia</p>
<p>   more competitive? Will these changes be seen by investors overseas as more</p>
<p>   likely to attract their dollars to Australia.</p>
<p>  And there couldn't be a better time in the last 20 or 30 years for an Australian</p>
<p>   government to look at removing any barriers to greater investment in this</p>
<p>   country from overseas. Because the achievement of the Australian economy,</p>
<p>   and the strength of the Australian economy is very widely recognised around</p>
<p>   the world. And that was driven home to me very strongly when I was in the</p>
<p>   financial capital of the world, New York, only a few weeks ago. And in the</p>
<p>   25 years that I've been visiting that city in various government and opposition</p>
<p>   capacity, I've not found a greater respect for what Australia has achieved,</p>
<p>   and the strength of the Australian economy than I did on this particular</p>
<p>   occasion. Now we're going to ask ourselves that fundamental question - will</p>
<p>   it make Australia more competitive, will it make it more attractive to invest</p>
<p>   in Australia?</p>
<p>  And another fundamental question we have to ask ourself is whether the changes</p>
<p>   that we propose to make, and I can assure there will be some quite fundamental</p>
<p>   changes to the Australian business taxation system, will those changes lead</p>
<p>   to less complexity, will they lead to changes which are more likely to produce</p>
<p>   a simpler and more coherent taxation system? Now I can't pretend to you</p>
<p>   today that any business taxation system can be the essence of simplicity</p>
<p>   because business transactions of their very nature are often complex and</p>
<p>   indirect. But I think there is an overwhelming view in the Australian business</p>
<p>   community that not only do we need a taxation system that encourages more</p>
<p>   competition and more investment, and more risk taking, but we also need</p>
<p>   a business taxation system which is less complicated and easier to follow.</p>
<p>   And that will be the second of the great principles or the great questions</p>
<p>   that will apply to the deliberations that we are about to bring to the report</p>
<p>   delivered to us by Mr Ralph.</p>
<p>  I think all of you are aware of some of the areas of debate and some of</p>
<p>   the areas of discussion about business tax reform. I make one very important</p>
<p>   request to all of you, and that is when having a look at the impact of any</p>
<p>   of the recommendations and the decisions of the government that follow those</p>
<p>   recommendations, I do ask that you take into account the aggregate impact,</p>
<p>   not only of the business tax changes but also of all of the changes that</p>
<p>   flow from the goods and services tax on your operations. There is a tendency</p>
<p>   with these things for businesses to look at them in watertight compartments</p>
<p>   and say - well the GST has given me this advantage that's terrific, but</p>
<p>   if the business tax change doesn't give me also an additional advantage</p>
<p>   than I'm against it. I ask all of you to look in aggregate at the changes</p>
<p>   that will be brought about by business taxation reform, and also add to</p>
<p>   them the changes that have been brought about through the goods and services</p>
<p>   taxation reform. And I ask you to ask yourselves especially, when you add</p>
<p>   both of them together whether the aggregate of the benefit, the changes</p>
<p>   are beneficial to your businesses and your business operations. And I believe</p>
<p>   that if you do that you will find that in the overwhelming majority of cases</p>
<p>   you can answer that in a very very strong affirmative tone that I believe</p>
<p>   will be the reaction of the business community to the changes that we bring</p>
<p>   about.</p>
<p>  So we have ahead of us therefore ladies and gentlemen, a number of major</p>
<p>   further reform challenges. We have come a long way. We have made the Australian</p>
<p>   economy achieve something that I don't think many people thought it would</p>
<p>   achieve and we have seen it stare down the worst downturn in the Asia Pacific</p>
<p>   region since the end of World War II. And if I'd addressed this gathering</p>
<p>   a year ago, just on the eve of the release of the taxation reform plan,</p>
<p>   and before the October election of 1998, I probably would have said to you</p>
<p>   that we were looking forward to the challenge of selling tax reform to the</p>
<p>   Australian community. And I also would have reported to you that although</p>
<p>   the Australian economy was performing very well and is growing more strongly</p>
<p>   than many predicted, we thought it would be badly damaged and that growth</p>
<p>   would slow significantly as a result of the Asian economic downturn. And</p>
<p>   I would have asked you to accept the proposition that in the face of that</p>
<p>   impact of the downturn, that the government was better equipped than the</p>
<p>   alternative opposition to guide Australia through those very very difficult</p>
<p>   months, perhaps years.</p>
<p>  I'm very happy now in August of 1999 to say that a year ago I would have</p>
<p>   been too pessimistic in saying that, because I don't mind conceding that</p>
<p>   the Australian economy has performed better over the last two years than</p>
<p>   I thought it would. And I think it's fair to say that the Australian economy</p>
<p>   has performed better than most people thought it would. And I think it's</p>
<p>   very important that just as we have outperformed our expectations over the</p>
<p>   last couple of years, and that although we should never be complacent or</p>
<p>   smug about the future, there is no reason to believe or fear, to borrow</p>
<p>   Roosevelt's expression again, there is no reason to fear that we can't continue</p>
<p>   to enjoy the sort of economic stability and progress and that we are enjoying</p>
<p>   at the present time. And we can do that. It is within our grasp to build</p>
<p>   for ourselves the third great era of economic prosperity that Australia</p>
<p>   has seen this century. And we do have it within our grasp to do that if</p>
<p>   we continue the reform process. We won't achieve that goal, we won't build</p>
<p>   that third era of great economic progress if we imagine that what we have</p>
<p>   achieved either over the last couple of years has been a matter of luck</p>
<p>   and the luck is going to turn against, or if we imagine alternatively that</p>
<p>   we have completed the reform process. The reform process, you know it in</p>
<p>   your businesses, we know it with our experience in government, is never</p>
<p>   completed. We have done great things to get the budget back into surplus.</p>
<p>   We have done great things to reform the industrial relations system. We</p>
<p>   have pursued a vigorous competition policy which has brought about reduced</p>
<p>   business costs for just about all businesses in this country. We have achieved</p>
<p>   great things in the taxation reform front. But we still have many reform</p>
<p>   challenges that lie ahead of us.</p>
<p>  And if I could finish on one note ladies and gentlemen it is this - that</p>
<p>   of all of the benefits that I believe that we have derived from the economic</p>
<p>   achievements and the economic reforms of the last few years, and the strength,</p>
<p>   the current day strength of the Australian economy, the most important dividend</p>
<p>   out of that is I believe a dividend that goes to the national psychology.</p>
<p>   When I became Prime Minister of Australia in March of 1996 I had the sense</p>
<p>   in which Australia was something of an anxious outsider in the Asia Pacific</p>
<p>   region knocking on the door seeking admission to the rich club of the Asia</p>
<p>   Pacific region. We had the sense that some-how-or-other we were lagging</p>
<p>   behind as we were aspiring to be accepted as part of this unique grouping</p>
<p>   of nations. And now three-and-a-quarter years on so much of that has changed.</p>
<p>   Australia is seen with a new respect in a new light. Australia is seen as</p>
<p>   having achieved something that even many Australians didn't believe was</p>
<p>   possible. We have bred in this country a belief that we are only really</p>
<p>   entitled to enjoy a few short years of economic prosperity, and then the</p>
<p>   boom underwriting those years would be replaced by a bust, and that in some</p>
<p>   way we would have to put up interest rates to restrict imports and we would</p>
<p>   have to go back to restrictive policies.</p>
<p>  And I think the psychological dividend that the last year or two has delivered</p>
<p>   to Australia has been enormous. It has given to the country a new respect,</p>
<p>   a new strength around the world. We are seen as an achiever. We go to the</p>
<p>   councils of the Asia Pacific region, and a good friend of the region, that</p>
<p>   as a country that goes there on its own terms in its own right, and being</p>
<p>   as it always has been a totally Australian experience with those countries.</p>
<p>   And I think therefore that the psychological dividend, the self confidence</p>
<p>   dividend that has come out of the last couple of years is indeed the greatest</p>
<p>   dividend of all. And that should encourage us to believe that we shouldn't</p>
<p>   fear the possibilities that prosperity can disappear almost automatically</p>
<p>   in a year or twos time. And if we remain resolved to continue as the government</p>
<p>   is to the process of reform in the years ahead there is no reason at all</p>
<p>   why the prosperity the country now enjoys ought not to be consolidated or</p>
<p>   not to continue to the benefit of future generations of our fellow countrymen</p>
<p>   and women.</p>
<p>  [Ends]</p>
<p>   QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS FOLLOWING ADDRESS</p>
<p>  E&amp;OE.................</p>
<p>  QUESTION:</p>
<p>  From the perspective of this room, one of the most important components</p>
<p>   of the GST reform package was the removal of stamp duty from commercial</p>
<p>   property. When do you intend to deliver on this promise?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well under the arrangement that we have entered into with the Australian</p>
<p>   States it will not be removed as early as we had anticipated, not through</p>
<p>   any lack of desire on our part but because the compromise reached with the</p>
<p>   Australian Democrats meant that the growth in revenues would not be as quick</p>
<p>   as we had anticipated, and it will be.I can't give you an exact date, it</p>
<p>   will be several years into the future, precisely when I can't at this stage</p>
<p>   indicate but it will occur as soon as the growth in revenue from the GST</p>
<p>   exceeds the benefit to the states of the existing financial arrangement</p>
<p>   that the Commonwealth has with the States.</p>
<p>  It is one of the consequences of the deal that was made with the Australian</p>
<p>   Democrats. The stamp duty on financial instruments will be removed almost</p>
<p>   immediately the new arrangements come into force. The wholesale sales tax</p>
<p>   will be totally removed on the first of July of next year and the removal</p>
<p>   of other state taxes will be delayed by several years as a consequence of</p>
<p>   the slow down in the growth of revenues. It would have been otherwise if</p>
<p>   we had been able to get the entire package through the Senate. It simply</p>
<p>   hasn't proved possible to do that for reasons that you are all very well</p>
<p>   aware of. I know that that is of a disappointment to this audience but just</p>
<p>   as you live in a real commercial world, we live in a real political world.</p>
<p>   We didn't have the numbers in the Senate, we weren't going to go and have</p>
<p>   another election over whether or not the GST should include fresh food and</p>
<p>   I didn't get many encouragements from anybody to do that and we took the</p>
<p>   view that we should achieve a compromise that delivered 85-90% of what we</p>
<p>   wanted. We have done that and we feel in overall terms the benefits are</p>
<p>   enormous but I acknowledge your point. I can only ask you to understand</p>
<p>   the circumstances in which it arose.</p>
<p>  QUESTION:</p>
<p>  With the greatest respect Prime Minister, that sounds like, you say it is</p>
<p>   going to be delayed for several years, I am hearing it is never going to</p>
<p>   happen. Your speech...</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  No well with the greatest respect, you are wrong. I will come back when</p>
<p>   it happens and remind you so.</p>
<p>  MC:</p>
<p>  Well said.</p>
<p>  QUESTION:</p>
<p>  Prime Minister, one of the consequences of economic prosperity is full employment.</p>
<p>   Now in Australia this might mean that it's not 3% or 5%, it maybe 7% because</p>
<p>   the old unemployed people don't match the new jobs. If that is the case</p>
<p>   and that is what I am finding, how are you likely to review your immigration</p>
<p>   policies to bring in people who have the skills that Australia needs and</p>
<p>   certainly hasn't been able to provide its work force, so that we can position</p>
<p>   ourselves into a global future?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  I would answer that question in a couple of ways. The first way is to say</p>
<p>   that we have already begun, and in fact over the last three years we have</p>
<p>   begun to alter our immigration policy quite dramatically to address the</p>
<p>   very issue you've raised. Over the last three years we have altered in a</p>
<p>   very major way the balance between family reunion and skilled migration.</p>
<p>   The current migrant intake, a far greater bulk proportion of the people</p>
<p>   being brought in, are skilled migrants and far fewer come in under the family</p>
<p>   reunion category. So we have already begun to address that.</p>
<p>  The broader question which I think you raised, and I guess underlying what</p>
<p>   you put to me is the proposition that we're hitting a point where you can't</p>
<p>   further reduce unemployment because the jobs that are available, they are</p>
<p>   not matched by the people who are out of work. Now that is true up to a</p>
<p>   point. It will always be true for any society irrespective of what level</p>
<p>   of immigration it has. There is a view that the Australian economy would</p>
<p>   receive an enormous boost if we had a much higher level of immigration and</p>
<p>   people who put that view are partly, but not totally instructed by the experience</p>
<p>   that this country had in the 1950s and '60s when major immigration made</p>
<p>   an enormous contribution to Australia's post war economic expansion.</p>
<p>  We don't have a fixed, in concrete view about the level of immigration.</p>
<p>   We take the view that the level of immigration should be adjusted according</p>
<p>   to economic circumstances. I don't think anybody can say, given the economic</p>
<p>   growth we've had over the last few years that we have got the fundamentals</p>
<p>   of economic policy wrong. I think that we have got them fundamentally right.</p>
<p>   We are ready to alter the migrant intake if we believe that the economic</p>
<p>   imperative require it. We are totally committed to maintaining, and where</p>
<p>   possible, building on the current mix between skilled and family reunion.</p>
<p>   We think the more skilled migrants that this country can have recruited</p>
<p>   on a completely non-discriminatory basis, the more the nation will be enhanced,</p>
<p>   and when I talk overseas about the possibility of Australia becoming a world</p>
<p>   financial centre one of the attributes that I put forward is the fact that</p>
<p>   we have, as Australian citizens now, hundreds of thousands of people who</p>
<p>   have come from the countries of Asia who speak the language of those countries</p>
<p>   and one of the enormous advantages of Australia in a global economic sense</p>
<p>   is that we, sure, we speak the English language which is of enormous advantage</p>
<p>   in world finance, particularly in world finance, but also we have as Australian</p>
<p>   citizens a very diverse pool of people whose skill and dexterity in speaking</p>
<p>   the languages of other nations, particularly in our region is of enormous</p>
<p>   benefit.</p>
<p>  So our position is that we are not permanently</p>
