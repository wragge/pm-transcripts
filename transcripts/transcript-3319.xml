The Prime Minister, Alr. W,-hitlam, announced today that<br />
the Government has accepted the recommendations of the Tariff Board<br />
in its reports on propylene oxide derivatives and film processing<br />
industry, advertising film ( value for duty).<br />
With regard to propylene oxcide derivatives Mr. Whitlam<br />
said the Government's decision to implement the 3oard's<br />
recommendations will mean th. at a General rate of euty of<br />
will apply to the principal products covered by the report,~ polyols<br />
( used in the manufacture of polyurethane foam) and glycols ( primarily<br />
used'in the production of polyester resins and surface coatings).<br />
Presently these goods are dutiable at minimumn rates. Mr. T-hitlam<br />
said the Government noted the Board's misgivings as-to whether the<br />
local manufacture of these goods warranted assistance but accepted<br />
the Board's judgement on the level of protection for the local<br />
industry pending a review of the chemical industry as a whiole in<br />
1975. There will be no change in the duties currently applying<br />
to the other goods covered by the report except for a minor<br />
variation in respect of some chemically pure surface active agents<br />
and some goods of New Zealand origin.<br />
The decision in respect of the film processing report will<br />
mean that minimum rates of duty will apply to exposed cinematograph<br />
film; a General rate of 35% will apply to graphic arts film ( negative<br />
and positive) and minimum rates of duty will apply to other goods.<br />
Provision will also be made for by-law admission of certain exposed<br />
film. A detailed statement of the Customs tariff changes<br />
involved arising from the Government's decision will be issued<br />
by the Minister for Customs and -, xcise when arrangements have<br />
been finalised to implemnent the new.. duty rates.<br />
