PRMIIMNSTEEL<br />
19 August 1996 TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
THE HON JOHN HOWARD MP<br />
DOORSTOP PARLIAMENT HOUSE<br />
E O E<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Ladies and gentlemen, I want on behalf of the Government, and I'm sure the people of<br />
Australia to condemn utterly the violence that occurred today the attack on Parliament<br />
House. I want to make it very clear to those who were involved in that violence and to<br />
the Australian people, that never under any circumstances will my Government buckle to<br />
threats of physical violence or behaviour of that kind.<br />
If anybody imagines that behaviour of that kind is going to get the Howard Government to<br />
change its mind on anything, then those people are completely mistaken. We will always<br />
listen to reason. We will always listen to sensible argument. We will always talk to<br />
people who have a point of view to express.<br />
But what occurred here today was un-Australian, it was ugly, it endangered the physical<br />
well-being of men and women in the Australian Federal Police, Parliament House staff and<br />
the protective services, who were forced in pursuit of their duties to subject themselves to<br />
insults, physical attack, and all sorts of abuse.<br />
It is a very sad and unhappy day in the life of the Australian parliament and those<br />
responsible for today's demonstration should feel utterly ashamed of themselves, but more<br />
importantly they should take a message from me on behalf of the Government and I know<br />
the people of Australia, that violence will get nowhere in Australia. </p>
<p>Lawful assembly to put a point of view, a lawfully held demonstration, a robust<br />
demonstration is part and parcel of the Australian tradition and no politician can ever<br />
object to that, or ever object to what is said at it. But what occurred this afternoon was<br />
utterly beyond that, and I want also before I take your questions I want also to express<br />
to you the thanks that I have already personally conveyed to all members of the Australian<br />
Federal Police, the Parliament House staff and the Protective Services who acted as they<br />
did in a very fine and professional way to protect Parliament House and I've personally<br />
thanked all of them, and through the vehicle of this news conference I express to the<br />
Australian people, my thanks also to the tremendous work of the police and the Parliament<br />
House staff.<br />
JOURNALIST: Where do you believe the responsibility does lie, Prime Minister?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Those people who were responsible for the violence I can't make a judgment. I didn't<br />
organise it. It was organised by the ACTU. You can go to them. Obviously it got out of<br />
hand and those people who were responsible for it getting out of hand, I hope are properly<br />
brought to account by those who can bring influence to bear upon them. And I would<br />
hope incidentally, that Mr Beazley, the Leader of the Opposition will join me unreservedly<br />
in condemning what occurred today, that he will utterly dissociate himself from what<br />
occurred today, and that he will speak in equally strong terms of the unacceptability of<br />
physical violence as a means of getting across a political point of view.<br />
JOURNALIST: Do you believe the ACTU leadership should also disassociate themselves from it?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Look, I won't the ACTU leadership should certainly dissociate itself, yes,<br />
absolutely. I have no quarrel with the lawful assembly of people who put a hostile point of<br />
view to my political values. I have no argument with that at all. But I have every<br />
argument with the sort of behaviour this afternoon and I have to say again to remind all of<br />
you and to remind the ACTU and everybody who took part in that demonstration this<br />
afternoon, that five months ago the Australian people voted for the Workplace Relations<br />
Bill. It hasn't been enacted by the Parliament. It is before the Parliament in a form,<br />
( inaudible).., with what we put to the Australian people in March. We are yet to bring<br />
down our first Budget, it will be a fair budget although a strong one and in those<br />
circumstances what the ACTU is saying is politically unsustainable, but what happened<br />
this afternoon at the entrance to Parliament House was morally unacceptable.<br />
JOURNALIST: </p>
<p>storm Parliament House could in fact be charged and if so will you be taking action to<br />
ensure that they are charged?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, anybody who breaks the law should be charged.<br />
JOURNALIST: Will you be taking action?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Look, I don't charge people, that is left to the police. The ordinary law will run its<br />
ordinary course. I won't be seeking any special application of that law, nor will I be<br />
encouraging any dispensation of that law.<br />
JOURNALIST: Are you surprised by the level of anger and violence that was here today, or do you see<br />
that as a direct reflection of some elements of the community's feeling about the signs<br />
they've seen of your budget, or is it something else?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I don't believe for a moment that those people who smashed their way into Parliament<br />
House in any way represent the feelings of mainstream Australia. I think what they did<br />
this afternoon will be greeted with revulsion by mainstream Australia.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister you've said the Australian people voted in the Industrial Relations reforms.<br />
They didn't vote for a rise in the Medicare levy though did they? Why are you doing that?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Tomorrow night is Budget night. Good afternoon. </p>
