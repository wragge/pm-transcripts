EMBARGO: 8. OOPM 6 MAY 1974<br />
A. B. C. BROADCAST BY THE PRIME MINISTER, MR E. G. WHITLAM, QC, MP,<br />
MONDAY 6 MAY 1974<br />
Let me remind you of the basic choice you face in this<br />
election. It's a choice between turning back returning to the<br />
past or moving forward forward on a course of progress and<br />
enlightenment. When you elected this government seventeen months ago<br />
you gave us a clear go-ahead to carry out a vast and creative<br />
program of reform.-You said: " We've had enough of run down schools,<br />
of injustice and unequal opportunity, of overcrowded and inefficient<br />
cities, of miserly pensions and sub-standard health services. We're<br />
sick of seeing our-industries and resources falling into foreign<br />
hands. We want change and improvement, a better life for our people<br />
and our children, a greater say in our own destiny." Those were<br />
your instructions. And from the moment you elected us we set about<br />
to fulfil our promises to carry out those instructions. We have<br />
done a great deal in those seventeen months. What we ask of you<br />
now is a fair go a fair go to complete our task, to get on with<br />
the job you elected us to do.<br />
You hear a great deal of scare talk and hysterical propaganda<br />
from our political opponents and the sectional interests they<br />
represent. Let's just look at the facts. The facts are that<br />
Australia has never been more prosperous and its future has never<br />
looked brighter. The first thing we had to do was restore full<br />
employment. We've done it. We have restored full employment. We<br />
have high wages and we ' re well on the way to equal pay for women.<br />
Farm incomes are at record levels. Company profits are at record<br />
levels so are their plans for investment. Our overseas reserves<br />
are immensely strong. The Australian dollar is one of the strongest<br />
currencies in the world. Our economy is vigorous and buoyant.<br />
Along with that prosperity, like every other major country<br />
in the world, we share this difficult problem of inflation. The<br />
causes of inflation are complex, but there were two major causes of<br />
inflation in Australia: the first was a flood of foreign money which<br />
our opponents allowed into Australia when Mr Snedden was Treasurer;<br />
the second was the gross under-valuation of the Australian dollar in<br />
the last year of the Liberal-Country Party government. You'll remember<br />
that just before Christmas 1971 there was a long and bitter wran-gle<br />
between the Liberals and the Country Party about the value of the dollar.<br />
Mr Anthony threatened to resign from the coalition unless the Country<br />
Party got its way. And the Country Party did get its way. The Liberals<br />
caved in, the dollar was devalued, and the seeds of inflation were<br />
sown. When we came to power, inflation was already the worst for<br />
twenty years. We immediately raised the dollar'ls value and closed off<br />
the flood of foreign money which speculators were using to buy up<br />
Australia's resources on the cheap. In the year that followed we<br />
revalued the currency again, we cut tariffs, we exercised flexible<br />
monetary policies, we pruned back unnecessary spending on subsidies<br />
and tax lurks. The result is now that we are winning the battle ./ 2 </p>
<p>-2-<br />
against inflation. Our policies are working. The latest consumer<br />
price figures have shown~ a dramatic and encouraging drop in the<br />
inflation rate. Let's keep up the good work. Let's not undo those<br />
policies now now that they're working. Because the Country Party<br />
and the Liberals would undo them. They have promised to remove our<br />
restrictions on the inflow of foreign money. They have promised all<br />
sorts of electoral bribes. They have promised to cut taxes. Imagine<br />
it! Cut taxes to fight inflation! I ask you: where would the extra<br />
goods come from to satisfy the increase in purchasing power? It is<br />
economic nonsense and every responsible financial commentator has<br />
said it is nonsense. Mr Snedden's proposals would reverse all our<br />
hard-won gains. They would create further inflation on a catastrophic<br />
scale. The other great issue before us is this: do we want<br />
Australians to remain in control of our resources, our industries,<br />
our raw materials or do we want them to fall increasingly into<br />
foreign hands? Here's a figure to keep in mind: when we came in,<br />
68% of our energy resources our coal, our oil, our uranium, our<br />
natural gas were in foreign hands. Sixty-eight per cent! You all<br />
remember how Sir John McEwen, when he was Leader of the Country Party,<br />
expressed his concern at the way Australia was being sold out to<br />
foreign interests. I'm afraid it's a different story in the Country<br />
Party today. They no longer care much about the farmer; they have<br />
become the spokesmen and defenders of the foreign mining companies<br />
and speculators who are rushing to buy up Australia's resources.<br />
They make no secret of their intention to lavish incentives and tax<br />
concessions on these companies, to reward them for the privilege of<br />
taking Australia over. They have promised mark this to double<br />
the Australian price of crude oil solely for the benefit of foreign<br />
oil companies. The Country Party would make every motorist, every<br />
farmer, every business pay more, much more, for petrol. That is the<br />
most irresponsible and inflationary promise of all. So never forget<br />
the power and influence of the Country Party on their Liberal<br />
partners. We all know who would be running things if Mr Snedden<br />
were Prime minister. It wouldn't be Mr Snedden. It would be the<br />
Country Party the most sectional and reactionary of the major parties<br />
in Australia. My government has acted with vigour and determination to<br />
keep Australian industries and Australian resources in Australian hands.<br />
We won't allow Australians to be tenants in their own land. We will<br />
defend the right of Australians to control their economic inheritance<br />
for themselves and for their children. In a world where mineral<br />
and energy resources are precious and scarce, there will be no sell-out<br />
of Australia by my government.<br />
So that is the choice before you a united and determined<br />
government, pledged to progress and reform, winning the battle against<br />
inflation, pledged to defend Australian ownership; or a weak and<br />
divided opposition, an opposition that bribes you with inflationary<br />
tax cuts, an opposition that forced this election even before it had<br />
patched its policies together, an opposition dominated by the Country<br />
Party, with muddled and contradictory policies on inflation, an<br />
opposition that tamely accepts the sell-out of Australian assets. You<br />
know our record. I am proud of it. We have given a new deal to our<br />
schools, to the children of Australia. We have restored full employment.<br />
./ 3 </p>
<p>-3-<br />
We have launched our great program to make Australian cities decent<br />
places for our people. We have given Australia a new pride and<br />
standing in the eyes of the world. I don't believe the Australian<br />
people are ready to say: " All that was wasted. Let's put all that<br />
aside and turn back." I don't believe we want the rest of the world<br />
to say: " Australia has lost heart. Australia has lost faith in<br />
her vision, in her future, in herself." I say to my fellow Australians:<br />
Don't put the clock back. Let us get on with the job together.<br />
Good night </p>
