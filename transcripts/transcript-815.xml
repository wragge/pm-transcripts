FOR PRESS PM Z8/ 1963<br />
NEW AUSTRALIAN CASH LOAN IN LONDON<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister, the Rt. Hon. Sir Robert Menzies<br />
The Prime Minister and Chairman of the Australian<br />
Loan Council ( Sir Pobert Menzies) gave details tonight of a new<br />
Australian cash loan which has been negotiated in London by the<br />
Commonwealth Treasurer ( Mr. Harold Holt) with the approval of the<br />
Loan Council. The loan will be for an amount of Å Stg. 20 million<br />
million) and will carry an interest rate of 5j per cent<br />
with an issue price of 98-i-. The loan will mature in April 1981-82.<br />
Sir Robert said that f3tg. 5.7 million (Å CA7.1 million)<br />
of the proceeds will be earmarked for the redemption of an<br />
equivalent amount of Commonwealth securities which mature in<br />
London on 1st January 1964. The remaining Å Stg. 14.3 million<br />
(Å A17.9 million) will be available for the 1963-6+ Commonwealth<br />
and State borrowing programmes approved by the Loan Council.<br />
Sir Robert said that, in view of the difficulties<br />
which Australia may face in borrowing in the United States for<br />
the next few years as a result of the proposed Interest<br />
Equalization Tax on foreign issues in that country, it was<br />
particularly gratifying that the Treasurer had been able to<br />
arrange such a large cash loan in London.<br />
The new loan will be the fourth Australian cash loan<br />
in London since 1958, the three previous loans being for amounts<br />
of either Å Stg. 12 million or Å Stg. 15 million. Each of these was<br />
issued at 5-L per cent, and the most recent loan ( in January 1963)<br />
was for an amount of Å Stg. 12 million and had an issue price of 98.<br />
The new loan will open for subscription in London on<br />
W-Tednesday 2nd October.<br />
CANBERRA. 27th September, 1963. </p>
