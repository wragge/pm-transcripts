-The contribution of You= w Liberals is Invaluable iii w-aAny<br />

12he role of-the " Yowq Liberal Movement Is no less important<br />
now that ti' 6 election is over. Along with the rest . of the -Party,<br />
the Young Liberal MovenueiRt has -an important: job to do in asserting<br />
a role for Governi ntwhich helps ind-ividuala achieve a better<br />
life for themselves.<br />
The XEibexali Party iLs cnmaittet to ackiievIng a way of life for<br />
Australlan In whuich every person has the apportuni y to achleve<br />
his or her qnals im 1. ie-This is -a coninef to progres-sive<br />
and rezpons~ ible reform. The onus Is row on" u-to work to achieve<br />
oixr abircti-_ A~ n ttays appropriate to. Australia as it Is. The<br />
zize of our majority in the Farliament im! poses great obliqat-ion-3<br />
on us. In this -mrk the belp and advice of the, Young Liberal<br />
Moveent is of q-reat Jimpor taflct-<br />
In the last three years we have ssen the f" aillure of La-bor1 s<br />
-attempt = t -reformi. We shiou-ld be very cle~ ar about why Labor<br />
faiLed w3 that we can avoid the . sams traps -ouroe.. veas. Lah-or<br />
failed because the~ f were unable to astablish an effectivlfe process </p>
<p>making~ dec isions.<br />
Labor f ailed -because tk&amp; v did not maintain proper standardr,<br />
of conduct ini Govermnent. Alhove all, Labor failed laecause thev<br />
tried to establish a role -for Gover ient w~ hich was titteirly<br />
-inappropzia-te(;-to-the needs of the courmÃ± try an~ d the wist-' s of<br />
Australians. it never occurred to them to ask how<br />
pwple concerned might. be hielped. to soive the probslem, ffor<br />

control over people Is lives. This approach xes'ealeri Labor<br />
deep distrust of people's ability to smagae their ownm lives, to<br />
do tlhings tbenieiv.-_ z<br />
NJothing syubo. iUses, Labor's . attemrpt to dominate i-n all fields<br />
better than the coiocssal -expansion of G-ovexrnent spendip~ irn the.<br />
last three years. Alt took 72 years for Goaverxu~ ent spending<br />
to reach $ 10,000 Million4 In three yea-ra Labor = ore th~ in double#<br />
this to $ 22,000 izuillion. This failure to exercise a eesportsibhl4E<br />
control over spendinq led tMranty of the problemns Ailstralia i. q now<br />
experiencing.<br />
All Government-i all parties receive numerous requests, lto spcend<br />
=~ nev ftos -irdivldsials an~ d -oraati s&amp; zions around the i-ozintry.<br />
These requests ofteia overlook_.. orL, critical fact: a~ t ia-ny one<br />
time Australias resources are limi-ted. It is qrowtni over<br />
time vhich provideg -the tcapac ity to undertake new in-ttiativzs..<br />
Growth can be and hat-a been -undermined by unrealistic and<br />
. irresponmible policles.<br />
At any ore tizie w~ e cannot give moneyr to scuea new project without<br />
takincr money froms somie existingr project. If we-are not prepared<br />
to transfier money fronm -one govermnret project to another the money<br />
miust be takcen -frx= mri-vate individuals or from companies by way<br />
of tta CS.<br />
it Is often-difficult -to recognize thia truth that in asking<br />
Gover_ n to pay for sme new project we are actually asking<br />
our niglibours to pay for it, through the additional taxeu or<br />
pric~ es they will have to pay-People are probably prepared to </p>
<p>ask qovexnmen~ tg9 f r money whpre th~ e' wauld iw~ ln t-h-;<br />
rieighbours beca use qovezxlnaets i mpersor-U and becauLse<br />

the easy way out. 1-t--requires neither the cc'qTitmenat nor tt<br />
couage neceszary to put one's plans beiore one'zs ei91-tors<br />
and as5k for their voluntary support.<br />
tMany weil-t&amp;-do -groups have -got Goverrnment assistance at the?<br />
exoense of those ini real need. The Labor Party's lack of restraint<br />
meant that people did not -have to face up to this fact. It<br />
eametites seems easier -to get projects started 1111 they are<br />
mupported by the Cavernment. PeopiLe feel. aggjrieved if t-he<br />
Co'vernmient van't give them money to support som~ e Worthwhila<br />
project-People feel that Government isn ' t helping them because<br />
the politicians are too short sighted to3 apprectate just howi<br />
worthwhile-their project is hoiw much thae chianging times requixe<br />
thia new* exp~ enditure. Dixt how~ many people are prepared to say<br />
-Wheze the funds are to come from, who : 3hall bie taxed rzare heavily<br />
or -which projects should be abandoned?_<br />
A -people, aconnutry need to be careful of the seductions, the<br />
at-taction' 5 thit appear Wo flow frna -a lack of raz~ raint. For<br />
al wuh~ e int t % e eaxly days. of Labor people felt that all. Labor* s<br />
