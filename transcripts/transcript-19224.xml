    <content><![CDATA[<p>Beijing, People's Republic of China</p>
<p>Tonight we celebrate forty years of education and science exchanges between Australia and China.</p>
<p>In turn, tonight we celebrate the work of all of you.</p>
<p>You have given our countries a new vision of each other.</p>
<p>So Expanding our Horizons is a most fitting title for the commemorative volume launched this evening.</p>
<p>It is a fine way to document what our countries have gained from your enterprising spirit.</p>
<p>I've come from my first meeting with Premier Li earlier today, where I took the opportunity to congratulate him personally on his new role.</p>
<p>We also discussed my Government's White Paper on Australia in the Asian Century.</p>
<p>The White Paper is an ambitious document: a blueprint for a deeper, broader engagement and a declaration of intent.</p>
<p>Yet its core principle  -  that Australia's security and prosperity depend upon engagement with Asia  -  is not a new one.</p>
<p>In 1948, the fourth session of what was then the United Nations Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East was held in Australia, in the Blue Mountains of New South Wales.</p>
<p>In his opening address there, Australia's Governor-General William McKell declared that for Australians, the ‘Far East' should be thought of as the ‘Near North'.</p>
<p>He said that the post-war world needed to recognise the “economic and political importance of Asia”.</p>
<p>He went on to describe the global benefits that would come from cooperating in Asia's development.</p>
<p>McKell was a visionary Australian and a great man.</p>
<p>We meet 65 years later and 11 000 kilometres north.</p>
<p>Yet the truth of his message stands unaltered  -  and the responsibility to understand it falls more widely than ever.</p>
<p>Our engagement today must be much more than the words of diplomats or the actions of political leaders.</p>
<p>Education and science, artistic and sporting links, perhaps human friendships above all, these are ultimately as powerful as summits and statecraft. </p>
<p>Through our exchanges in education and science, the people of both our nations combine the transforming human experiences of learning and travel.</p>
<p>These life-changing individual experiences also combine in nation-building partnerships.</p>
<p>Consider the China Advanced Leadership Program, exposing China's future leaders to critical strategic issues and forging links to Australia's public sectors.</p>
<p>This is an innovative collaboration between the Australian and New Zealand School of Government and the Organisation Department of the Chinese Communist Party.</p>
<p>I know ANZSOG is working closely with the Chinese Government on a reciprocal program for senior Australian and New Zealand officials.</p>
<p>Or consider the Australian Government's new AsiaBound program.</p>
<p>This will give three thousand six hundred Australian students the chance to do part of their academic program in Asia.</p>
<p>China  -  the most popular destination in Asia for Australians studying abroad last year  -  is likely to account for one thousand of these places.</p>
<p>Or consider the way our two countries are joining a number of other governments in building the Square Kilometre Array  -  the SKA.  </p>
<p>You can see beside me here a photo of the Murchison site in Australia: Chinese-made dishes are part of the landscape.</p>
<p>I welcome representatives of our Chinese partners who are here with us this evening.</p>
<p>Through this collaboration, scientists and researchers around the world will share access to the world's largest telescope.</p>
<p>They will look back to the very beginning of the universe and map the cosmic forces at work.</p>
<p>The Square Kilometre Array is a marvel of collaborative science  -  combining the endeavour of our best minds.</p>
<p>Another very powerful example of scientific collaboration is the work which the late Jian Zhou of Wenzhou Medical College and Ian Frazier from the University of Queensland did together.</p>
<p>Their pioneering research in the early 1990s led to the development of a vaccine  -  Gardasil  -  which targets the virus that causes cervical cancer.</p>
<p>Their work is now saving the lives of more than a quarter of a million women and girls every year.</p>
<p>It is an inspiring example of what can be achieved  by Australian and Chinese researchers together  -  one very close to my heart.</p>
<p>The Australia-China research relationship has now moved into a new stage of cooperation with the establishment of six joint research centres.</p>
<p>These six centres will tackle the big issues of our shared future: like sustainable economic growth in a low carbon future, like water management and food security.</p>
<p>I am very pleased to see so many of the researchers working on these new projects here this evening.</p>
<p>I will be proud to unveil these tonight.</p>
<p>In addition to these centres, I also want to acknowledge the Sino-Australian Joint Laboratory for Eco-agriculture, which has set up in partnership with the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences.</p>
<p>I attended the opening of the Australian home for this centre at the University of Sydney only a few weeks ago.</p>
<p>It's an inspiring example of the real substance of our relationship in education and science.</p>
<p>We are here to celebrate what forty years of hard work has won us, but even tonight, our focus is on the future.</p>
<p>So I am very pleased that BHP Billiton will provide $2.2 million over five years for new, reciprocal Australia-China scholarships.</p>
<p>The scholarships will be offered by the Foundation for Australian Studies in China established by the Australia-China Council.</p>
<p>They will work alongside the Government's AsiaBound and Australia Awards programs, to increase the flow of students and professionals between Australia and China.</p>
<p>BHP Billiton's support shows their commitment to cooperative learning in the region.</p>
<p>Their funding of the BHP Billiton Chair of Australian Studies at Peking University shows this too.</p>
<p>I acknowledge the inaugural holder of the Chair, Professor David Walker, who is here with us tonight. </p>
<p>I also acknowledge the generosity of Cheung Kong Holdings and Mr HL Kam for the Cheung Kong Endeavour Awards. </p>
<p>I am very pleased a number of the awardees are here this evening to celebrate.</p>
<p>This evening is a particularly fitting occasion to conclude my second visit to China as Prime Minister.</p>
<p>I am so delighted that so many people who built the Australia-China education relationship in the past forty years are here this evening to celebrate all that has been achieved.</p>
<p>Everyone who is here is here for a reason  -  because we know, I know, how much you have done to change our peoples' lives and to build our nations.</p>
<p>I hope tonight, as you swap stories and share a meal with old friends, you will find time to reflect on all you have achieved.</p>
<p>During these forty years our nations have gone from distant strangers to valued friends  -  and many of you have done the same.</p>
<p>Education and science have been at the heart of Asia's renaissance.</p>
<p>Your teaching and learning, innovation and research has been at the heart of our two nations' change and growth.</p>
<p>For your part in all of that, tonight you can raise your glasses with pride.  </p>
<p>Thank you  -  and enjoy.</p>
