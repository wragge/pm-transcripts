With the closing date for the 2002 Prime Minister's Awards for Excellence in Community Business Partnerships only days away, I encourage business and community organisations to submit an application telling the story behind their partnership.<br />
The hallmarks of a good partnership include commitment, trust and the sharing of gifts, energy and creativity.  The focus of the Prime Minister's Awards is to recognise partnerships which clearly demonstrate these characteristics.<br />
Organisations that work together can help to build a more caring, productive and vibrant society.  The Awards will recognise that collaboration in a very positive way.<br />
Now in its fourth year, the Awards honour projects and programmes that are a creative association between the community and business sectors.<br />
Projects may also make a positive impact on the quality of life of the people involved and provide a genuine benefit to each party through staff morale, commitment, improved reputation, community advantage and wider networking.<br />
State and Territory awards will again be presented and winners will be eligible to be judged as a National winner in the small, medium or large business category.<br />
In addition to these categories, three Special Awards will also be presented this year:<br />
ï· The Long Term Partnership Special Award, which will honour longevity in a partnership that has been operating for more than five years;<br />
ï· The Impact on Community by a Business Special Award, which will honour a business with significant community involvement covering a suite of programmes and projects, with one or more partners; and<br />
ï· The Special Media Award, a new category introduced this year, which recognises a media organisation that has provided consistent, positive reporting of community business partnerships and corporate social responsibility.<br />
National winners and Special Award winners will be recognised at a gala Awards event and receive $10,000 towards the extension of their community project.  Closing date for nominations is 27 September 2002.<br />
Nomination forms and further information are available at <a href="http://www.partnership.zip.com.au">www.partnership.zip.com.au</a> or Freecall 1800 003 747. </p>
