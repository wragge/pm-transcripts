    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Australian Government warmly welcomes the overwhelming support</p>
<p> for the Good Friday peace settlement demonstrated in the referenda</p>
<p> held in the Irish Republic and Northern Ireland.</p>
<p>Such emphatic Yes votes will be a source of hope to the people of</p>
<p> Northern Ireland whose lives for so long have been blighted by bigotry</p>
<p> and tribal hatred.</p>
<p>This is an historic moment for the people of Northern Ireland.</p>
<p>They now have the opportunity after decades of bloodshed to put the</p>
<p> deaths and division of the past behind them.</p>
<p>I congratulate the Prime Ministers of Britain and the Irish Republic</p>
<p> for the leadership they have both displayed on this issue.</p>
<p>Few countries in the world have such deep Irish roots as Australia.</p>
<p>I know that many Australians will be heartened by such a decisive</p>
<p> embrace of a more peaceful future by people on both sides of the Irish</p>
<p> border.</p>
<p> 24 May 1998</p>
