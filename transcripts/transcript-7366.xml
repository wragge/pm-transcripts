FOR MEDIA 4 AUGUST 1988<br />
I was shocked and saddened to learn of today's tragic<br />
building site accident in Brisbane.<br />
My thoughts and I am sure those of all Australians are<br />

My best wishes go to those people injured, with the hope<br />
that they are each able to make a speedy and full recovery. 8 </p>
