<p>The Gillard Government and Tasmanian Government have reached a significant agreement today that will allow for the full roll out of DisabilityCare Australia, the National Disability Insurance Scheme, in Tasmania by July 2019.</p>
<p>The agreement will provide around 11,000 Tasmanian residents with significant or profound disability choice and control over the care and support they receive.DisabilityCare Australia will also give all Tasmanians the peace of mind that if they have or acquire a disability or have a child with disability that leaves them needing daily care and support, that they will get the support they need when they need it.Under the agreement reached today:â¢ By 2019-20, the Tasmanian Government will provide an estimated $232 million to cover all people in Tasmania. This contribution was determined using the benchmark set by New South Wales in the agreement reached with the Commonwealth in December 2012. This will contribute to the cost of care and support for people with disability.â¢ By 2019-20, the Commonwealth Government will contribute around $245 million to the scheme for Tasmanians. This will be around 51 per cent of scheme costs. In addition, the Commonwealth will cover the full cost of people who turn 65 and choose to remain in the scheme.Today's agreement builds on the agreement to launch in Tasmania from July 2013 for all young people aged 15-24 years. Other eligible Tasmanian residents will start entering the scheme in July 2016.We will progressively roll out DisabilityCare Australia in Tasmania so that by July 2019, all eligible residents will be covered.DisabilityCare Australia in Tasmania will offer people with disability the care and support they need over their lifetimes. DisabilityCare Australia will also end the cruel lottery that currently exists where the care and support they receive depends on where they live or how they acquired their disability.The Gillard Government will continue to work closely with remaining state and territory governments to reach agreement on the national roll out of DisabilityCare Australia, so that all Australians can rest assured that if they have, or acquire, a disability they will have their needs met in a way that supports them to live with choice and dignity.</p>
