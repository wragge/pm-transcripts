I am pleased to announce that the Commonwealth Government is donating $250,000 to The Salvation Army';s Red Shield Appeal.<br />
The Red Shield Appeal opens today and will run until the end of June.<br />
The Salvation Army is one of this nation';s great welfare organisations.  The men and women who serve the organisation have dedicated their lives to community service and to assisting to those in need.<br />
With more than 120 years of service to the Australian community, The Salvation Army has earned the respect and gratitude of our nation.<br />
All Australians are urged to support this appeal.</p>
