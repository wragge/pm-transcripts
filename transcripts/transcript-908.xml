OPENING OF NEJ1 SCIENCE BUILDING AT SCOTCH COLLEGE,<br />
1vELMMITNE<br />
21ST MARCH. 1964,<br />
Speech by the Prime Minister? the R~ t. Hon. Sir Robert Menzies<br />
Sir and Ladies and Gentlemen<br />
I think there is a considerable amount of Scots<br />
caution in the fact that the benediction .% ras pronounced before<br />
I spoke. ( Laughter) This has never happened to me before. I<br />
think it very prudent because in my long Presbyterian experience<br />
when the benediction is pronounced, the congregation is free to<br />
leave. ( Laughter) So it is very kind of you to remain.<br />
Now I am at a disadvantage today. As a rule, the<br />
speakers, according to an unwritten Australian practice, stand<br />
or sit in the shade while the audience sits in the sun and gets<br />
roasted. ( Laughter) This is a splendid idea. It is essential<br />
that the speaker should have command over the audience and therefore<br />
that the audience should be a little uncomfortable. Today<br />
you are all sitting in the shade and the position is reversed but<br />
it is worse for me because this I think, is the eighth occasion<br />
on which I have opened or helpeA to open one of these science<br />
blocks, th-, subject of aid from this well-known Industrial Fund<br />
and on each occasion in the past and again today, Mr. L. C. Robson,<br />
the chief executive of that concern has been present. On all<br />
other occasions, he has made a speech and he has spoken before me<br />
and I have picked up a few crumbs that have fallen from his<br />
scientific table, Today he is here the wretched man, gre at and<br />
good man as he is sitting in the shade, smirking a little and<br />
saying, " Well, it~ s Menzies who has to speak this time, all by<br />
himself." ( Laughter) Now, Sir, it is a very wonderful occasion and it is<br />
an occasion that should not be allowed to pass, even so far as I<br />
am concerned without me paying my tribute to the imaginative work<br />
of the Indus~ rial Fund. This doesn't account for all these science<br />
blocks that are being built, but it has meant that over the last<br />
year or two or three, hundreds of thousands of pounds have been<br />
raised and disbursed in order to improve scientific teaching in the<br />
independent schoo, s, as we call them, of Australia.<br />
Now, this is imaginative. Just indeed, as I am<br />
prepared to admit, that our own proposal as a government, which<br />
is now going into effect, to find Å 5M. a year for science<br />
laboratories and equipment in secondary schools is itself imaginative<br />
stimulated not a little by the work of the Industrial Fund.<br />
And It means, as you have been told that so far as the independent<br />
schools are concerned, one-quarter of the _ 5M. because that is<br />
about the proportion Å 1lim. every year will be devoted to these<br />
purposes. Now that doesn't mean, of course that every secondary<br />
school that wants, and deserves, a science block will get one in<br />
a year. That is, of course, manifestly impossible. But when you<br />
look forward over a term of years and imagine what this can do,<br />
then I think it will be agreed that there will be little reason<br />
why the great schools, secondary schools independent or State<br />
should not be able to improve the standard of their science<br />
teaching improve the qualifications of those going on to the<br />
universihos or any other tertiary institution and thereby add to<br />
the total scientific knoviledge and facilities of the country.<br />
Now I am not a scientist. Somebody some years ago<br />
invented a subject, a rather grisly subject, called political<br />
science. I know nothing about it. I am not a scientist but I<br />
know something about politics and something about the responsibility ./ 2 </p>
<p>2-<br />
of Politics and something about the political history of the<br />
world in our time, and there are two things that emerge from that<br />
consideration. The first is and I say this without denigrating<br />
the scientists that the failures of civilisation in this century<br />
have been failures of the human spirit, failures in the great<br />
and important art of knowing about people, of understanding<br />
people, of tolerating people, and these failures moral failures,<br />
intellectual failures have been brought about, I think, because<br />
we have underestimated the importance of humane studies and of<br />
human understanding, If we are going to avoid wars, if we are<br />
going to avoid catastrophes, internationally, then we must never<br />
lose sight of the fact that the business of education is every<br />
bit as much moral as it is intellectual, every bit as much a<br />
matter of training character and quality as it is of training<br />
people in the accumulation of facts.<br />
But there is another aspect. It is going on now.<br />
We have become rather accustomed havent we, of learning about<br />
new weapons, new explorations into space. More and more, a lot<br />
of people ha-ve begun to think that the sole business of science<br />
is propulsion and that we must explore outer space and that all<br />
this is* of necessity a very good thing. W~ ell, it maay be. I<br />
notice that a few people from time to time, and a few nations<br />
from time to time, contemplate spending a few thousand million<br />
pounds or dollars on trying to strike a blow at the moon? and I<br />
have nothing against the moon at all. I hove an affection for<br />
the moon. The moon has always struck me as being a highly<br />
handsome civil and reflective lady and why we should be wanting<br />
to hit her I don't know. I leave this to the scientists to<br />
explain. Aut putting on one side this silly ignorant prejudice<br />
of mine, I see in the current world such a scope for scientific<br />
development, such an irresistible demand for science, for the<br />
application of science in this very earth of ours that I marvel<br />
how we can survive or how the world can survive this century unless<br />
we produce far more scientific workers and thinkers and explorers<br />
than we do now. Consider, ladies and gentlemen, where we are it's a<br />
very pleasant place, a very comfortable city; it's a very<br />
comfortable country. We are by no moans overcrowded. WVe could<br />
have many many more people and hardly notice them. But the<br />
population of -the world nay almost doublo itself by the turn of<br />
the century, may almost double itself in the lifetime of most of<br />
the boys of this great school who are here today. And people,<br />
if they are to live in this world, if they are to have some chance<br />
of advancement in this world, if they are not to be consumed by a<br />
diet of starvation and hatred must be fed, must be clothed, must<br />
go on developing their own activities in life and this will be<br />
done not by doing with the soil or the elem., ents what grandfather<br />
did with them. This will be done only by people forcing their<br />
boundaries of knowledge further and further so that land will<br />
produce far more, so that elements now existent can be used<br />
effectively and properly, so that the world will undo, release<br />
its elements to sustain a population twice as great as we have<br />
now, This pressure of population on resources is I believe,<br />
the greatest genuine social problem that confronts us today in this<br />
world and it will not be solved with great respect to my<br />
particular union by politicians as such. It won't be solved by<br />
legislators as such, It will be soDlved by thousands and millions<br />
of people who are discovering and applying new things and that is<br />
where the scientist comes in. And some of the scientists may go<br />
to the moon if they want to, but I do hope that the vast majority<br />
of them won't think) that the vast majority of boys at school<br />
wontt think that it is no use taking science or being interested at o / 3 </p>
<p>-3<br />
in it unless you went to bo a nuclear physicist. Every aspect of<br />
science is under demand in the world humanity requires it.<br />
Therefore, I would think that apart altogether from the tremendous<br />
advantage that is got by having a new building with proper light,<br />
with proper facilities something to attract the student instead<br />
of the dark thing of old days with a solitary bunsen burner<br />
flickering in the corner, that apart altogether from the inherent<br />
attractiveness of this new building, it would increasingly be felt<br />
that there is here a great vocation which will sarve mankind all<br />
over the world. We are an advanced country. ' Jo : ught to produce<br />
far more people of this kind per thousand than another country just<br />
across the water, and we will need to. The Western countries will<br />
need to if they are to bring to the crowded Eastern countries of<br />
the world, emerging into independence, emerging into higher<br />
standards of life, if they are to bring to them a real hope of a<br />
happy future. Now there are three Presbyterian parsons on this platform<br />
and they have corrupted me hecauso, you see what I have been saying<br />
to you sounds singularly like a sermon. Bu it is a matter that<br />
I believe in, it has deeply affected my own outlook as the head of<br />
the Government on what ought to be done about science teaching and,<br />
therefore it gives me particular pleasure to be hero and to be<br />
about to l~ eclarc the building open. But before I do, I would like<br />
to tell you, just in general that my colleague, Senator Gorton<br />
and I have hiad a very great A~ eal of interest in evolving the<br />
particular ways and means of solving this problem of giving<br />
scientific aid to schools, particulbrly to the independent schools.<br />
The others can be dealt with through the State Governments without<br />
difficulty. One thing about which Senator Gorton will be making a<br />
statement next week is the setting up of a Committee to advise<br />
us, of competent people. I am happy to say that we have been able<br />
to persuade Mr. L. C. Robson to become associated with us in this<br />
great venture. This is worth untold thousands in efficiency in<br />
the administration of this scheme. But we also have established a<br />
Committee or my colleague has and will be announcing it but I<br />
think I might be permitted to say that one of this small but very<br />
representative authoritative Committee to advise us in relation<br />
to the indepenient schools on an Australian basis is Mr. Selby<br />
Smith himsel F, and we are deeply grateful to him. ( Applause)<br />
How he is going to deal with his successor and become a Professor<br />
of Education and at the same time devote some time to coping with<br />
people like me, I don't know, but I am grateful to him and I wish<br />
him well. And, Sir, having said that, I am happy to say that it<br />
is a pleasure for both ray wife and myself to be here. It is a<br />
pleasure on such a lovely day, in such a lovely setting and for the<br />
benefit of such a fanous school, to declare this building open. </p>
