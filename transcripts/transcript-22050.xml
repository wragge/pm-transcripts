    <content><![CDATA[<p>PRESIDENT MUSHARRAF:</p>
<p>Well ladies and gentlemen, it's my pleasure to receive the Prime Minister of Australia.  We had excellent discussions covering, of course, the earthquake which is the current subject and I expressed my extreme gratitude to the Prime Minister for all the assistance that Australia has given us, for the medical team which is in the hardest area, in the Neelum River Valley, which we are going to visit tomorrow.  Then we also discussed bilateral relations of mutual interest and international, the issue of terrorism and other subjects of mutual concern at the international level.  And may I say that there is complete consensus of views on the subject and Pakistan looks forward to a very strong, improved, strengthened relationships in all fields with Australia.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER HOWARD:</p>
<p>Well Mr President, can on, on my behalf, my wife's behalf, and my party's behalf, thank you and your Government for your hospitality.  We had a very direct and open discussion.  I greatly admire the personal stand that you've taken in the war against terrorism at very considerable personal risk to your own safety.  It's one thing for us in a relatively benign atmosphere in countries like Australia to talk about taking strong stands on things, it's entirely another thing when it's part and parcel of your existence to be threatened with assassination attempts.  We do have a commonality of view on most of the major world issues.  We discussed just a few moments ago the desirability of keeping going the process for the Middle East peace settlement, it is psychologically still a very important issue in the context of the campaign against terrorism and I particularly respect the way in which you, sir, have responded to the actions of the Israelis in pulling out of the settlements and the willingness on your part to talk to Israel, consistent of course with your long-stated support for the emergence of an independent Palestinian state.</p>
<p>I think the bilateral relationship can go a long way.  The momentum of your visit to Australia, and I hope the contribution my visit to Pakistan will make, can do a great deal.  And I look forward to the opportunity, with you tomorrow, to visit the earthquake area.  And can I just again say on behalf of the Australian people how moved we were by the flight of so many of your countrymen and women.  We have already given some assistance, as I indicated to you sir, I hope to say something further on that issue tomorrow.  But again my warm thanks for your hospitality.</p>
<p>PRESIDENT MUSHARRAF:</p>
<p>Thank you very much.</p>
