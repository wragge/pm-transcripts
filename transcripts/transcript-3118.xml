PROGRAMME FOR S2ATELESS UGANDAN ASIANS<br />
The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr E. G. Whitlam, announced<br />
today that Australia would be making a special contribution of<br />
$ US75,000 ($ A63,000) to the United Nations High Commission for<br />
Refugees ( UNHCR).<br />
Mr Whitlam said the contribution is in response to an<br />
international appeal by the High Commissioner for Refugees and is<br />
intended to help meet the costs in the transportation, care and<br />
maintenance and resettlement of the 3,600 stateless Asians now<br />
in transit camps in Europe after being expelled from Uganda last<br />
* month. Mr Whitlam said the contribution supplements an amount of<br />
$ US60,000 ($ A50,000) given in November to assist the movement of<br />
displaced persons from Uganda and brings to $ US135,000 ($ A113,000)<br />
the total assistance from Australia to the resettlement programmes<br />
organized by international agencies. </p>
