    <content><![CDATA[<p>I  very much welcome today's Parliamentary statement by the Prime Minister of Papua New Guinea (PNG), Sir Mekere Morauta, on the future of the PNGDF. In particular, I applaud his strong commitment to addressing the long-term problems that have beset the PNGDF and so seriously affected its capability.</p>
<p>Sir Mekere first raised his concerns with me when we met on 28 September at Kirribilli House in Sydney, during the Olympic Games. At that stage, I indicated that Australia would in principle be prepared to assist the PNG Government in its plans to reform the PNGDF. The Government subsequently agreed to send a high-level team of officials to Port Moresby to define the PNG Government's requirements in greater detail.</p>
<p>As a result, and as Sir Mekere said in his statement today, Australia will provide urgent assistance for the PNGDF's immediate needs, including rations, logistics and support for improved financial management. In addition, Australia has indicated that it will continue to be engaged in the process of long-term reform Sir Mekere has foreshadowed.</p>
<p>Our immediate response in the defence and security area should also be seen in the context of Australia's support for the PNG Government's wider programme of political and economic reform being undertaken by Sir Mekere and his ministers. I would like to commend them for the determined and comprehensive way in which they are seeking to tackle the many difficult issues facing PNG.</p>
<p>Australia stands ready to provide assistance, as necessary, for the PNG Government's efforts. This is a reflection of the great importance Australia attaches to its warm and long-standing relationship with PNG.</p>
