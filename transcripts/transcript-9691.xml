STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
INTERNATIONAL DAY OF INDIGENOUS PEOPLE<br />
The first International Day of Indigenous People is a time for all Australians to<br />
reflect on the position of indigenous people in our society on past<br />
injustices, on recent achievements, and on our hopes for a better future<br />
together. Our goal is to encourage Australia's Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander<br />
peoples to participate fully in the life of the nation while maintaining their own<br />
unique cultures and identities.<br />
In my speech at Redfern in December 1992, I acknowledged the many<br />
injustices of the past 200 years. As we have begun to recognise and<br />
acknowledge these injustices, so have we begun to redress them.<br />
The Native Title Act of 1993 was a watershed for the nation. It enshrined in<br />
law the rights of native title newly recognised by the High Court in its Mabo<br />
judgment, and provided mechanisms to allow those rights to be determined.<br />
The Government also established a Land Fund to make it possible for the<br />
many indigenous people unable to prove native title to buy land. This Fund<br />
will provide nearly $ 1.5 billion over 10 years and will give many dispossessed<br />
indigenous people a real base and a stake in the nation's future.<br />
The Government is examining further social justice measures for indigenous<br />
peoples, as the third stage of our response to the High Court's Mabo<br />
judgment. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities across the<br />
country have been consulted on how best the Government can ensure equity<br />
for indigenous people within the structures and institutions of our society.<br />
The Commonwealth Government is acutely aware of the disadvantage<br />
indigenous peoples suffer. </p>
<p>The poor health of many indigenous Australians compared with the total<br />
population causes particular concern. Over the last 12 years, in a bid to<br />
improve the general social conditions of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander<br />
people, we have taken steady and consistent budgetary and administrative<br />
action which has lead to lasting improvements in employment, housing and<br />
education. Nevertheless, we recognise the need for further improvements in these<br />
areas, and especially in the health of indigenous people, to redress the<br />
disadvantages still suffered by indigenous Australians.<br />
Earlier policies of child removal have been tragic for countless indigenous<br />
families. The Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs and the<br />
Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission are launching a National<br />
Inquiry into the Separation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Children<br />
so that we may know the full implications of these distressing past policies<br />
and be able to consider ways to deal with the often very sad outcomes.<br />
Alongside these specific policy initiatives, the nation has embarked on a<br />
process of reconciliation between indigenous Australians and the wider<br />
community. We must not fail in the aim of achieving a lasting reconciliation<br />
by the centenary of Federation in 2001. Australia is a successful multicultural<br />
society, and integral to our identity is the position of the first peoples of our<br />
country.<br />
The Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation has adopted as its vision:<br />
A united Australia which respects this land of ours; values the Aboriginal and<br />
Torres Strait Islander heritage; and provides justice and equity for all.<br />
This vision is in tune with Australia's national ethos of a fair go for all.<br />
Together we can make this vision a reality.<br />
