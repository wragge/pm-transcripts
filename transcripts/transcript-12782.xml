Tomorrow';s Budget will confirm commitments I made earlier this year to reinstate $5 million of funds to the Asthma Management Programme and the Medical Specialist Outreach Assistance Programme.<br />
These funds had earlier been allocated for GP House.  However, as I have said previously, it is not appropriate to provide Commonwealth funds for this purpose.  The Royal Australian College of General Practitioners (RACGP) has been advised of our intention not to proceed with the contract.<br />
The Department of Health and Ageing will be talking to the RACGP about reimbursement of costs unavoidably incurred by the College in developing the GP House proposal.<br />
When this matter arose earlier this year, I called for reports from the Departments of Finance and Health and Ageing.  The Auditor-General also indicated that he would be investigating the matter.<br />
I understand that the Auditor-General';s report will be tabled shortly.  I will release the Departmental Reports at the same time.</p>
