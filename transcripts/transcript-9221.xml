PRIME MINISTER<br />
PARTIAL, TRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW WITH THE PRIME MINISTER, THE<br />
HON. P J KEATING, M. P.<br />
RADIO 3MA, MIOLDURA<br />
FRIDAY 6 MAY, 1994<br />
PK: I think that the markets have probably taken a wrong view of economic events in<br />
Australia. Australia ' produced an inflation rate a week or two ago of under two<br />
percent and there is nothing around that leads me to conclude that we will in any way<br />
vary that outcome. So, if we have persistently low inflation with strong economic<br />
growth and I think we can have I think that the market's snap judgements made<br />
about conditions in the United States and the international market place are basically<br />
wrong judgements about Australia. They've got, really, little to do with the White<br />
Paper. They've got to do, really, with the bond markets of the United States anid world<br />
growth and world inflation.<br />
Ends. </p>
