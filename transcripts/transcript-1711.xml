COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA<br />
SPEECH .14<br />
BY 19 R<br />
The Rt Hon. HAROLD HOLT, C. H.,<br />
ON<br />
VIETNAM<br />
Ministerial Statement<br />
[ From the ' Parliamentary Debates', 2 November 1967]<br />
Mr HAROLD HOLT ( Higgins-Prime<br />
Minister) [ 8.471-Mr Speaker, the Leader<br />
of the Opposition ( Mr Whitlam) sought<br />
unlimited time in order to present the views<br />
of the Australian Labor Party on the Vietnam<br />
issue. He read nineteen foolscap pages.<br />
He read them beautifully. Occasionally he<br />
indulged in a little preening, like a veteran<br />
Old Vic Shakespearian. But he read it all.<br />
Is there any -man sitting behind him who<br />
knows the leadership that his leader has<br />
given him on the issue of Vietnam, Australia's<br />
participation in Vietnam, the policy<br />
to be adopted with relation to our troops<br />
in Vietnam, or our American alliance? Was<br />
there one word in nearly 50 minutes of<br />
declamation by the honourable gentleman<br />
opposite as to where he stands on these<br />
issues? This is what the country is waiting<br />
to hear. Does the honourable gentleman<br />
support Australia's participation in Vietnam?<br />
That is a simple question. Does he<br />
support it? Does he believe that we should<br />
be in Vietnam? I invite him to say so.<br />
He will not say so. Does he believe that<br />
Australian troops should be in Vietnam?<br />
I invite him to say so. If his Party were<br />
elected to office would it draw back Australian<br />
troops from Vietnam unless the<br />
United States obeyed the requirements of<br />
the Adelaide Conference decisions? He has<br />
not mentioned a word about that tonight.<br />
15464/ 67 Honourable -members could go right<br />
through this speech and not find one line or<br />
one word as to where the Australian Labor<br />
Party stands on these great issues. And<br />
this is the alternative Australian government-<br />
the government which would have<br />
to sit with our allies in discussion and<br />
negotiations on the future of Vietnam. We<br />
have waited ever since the honourable<br />
gentleman was elected to the leadership of<br />
his Party to find out where he stands on<br />
these matters. I have said many hard<br />
things about the predecessor to the honourable<br />
gentleman. But at least he was an<br />
honest-~ minded Leader of the Labor Party.<br />
He told us where he stood and where his<br />
Party stood. The country knew where it<br />
would stand if it elected him to office. I<br />
defy any Australian to say clearly where<br />
Australia would stand on this great issue<br />
if the Leader of the Opposition were<br />
elected to govern this country.<br />
These are vital matters because if honourable<br />
gentlemen opposite were to take office<br />
these would be the hard realities they would<br />
have to face. What would the Labor Party<br />
do about Australian troops in Vietnam?<br />
Would it reinforce them? Would it withdraw<br />
them? Would it demand conditions<br />
of our allies which ' our allies might well<br />
find insupportable? Would it sit in on a </p>
<p>Manila-type summit conference with the<br />
sort of policy that the former Leader of the<br />
Opposition had? The honourable gentleman<br />
has so often chided me, on Vietnam, with<br />
being all the way with L. B. J. Is he all the<br />
way with A. A. C. when it comes to Labor<br />
Party policy on Vietnam? If he is not with<br />
his former leader, where is he? His former<br />
leader believes, as does the honourable<br />
. member for Yarra ( Dr J. F. Cairns), that<br />
the policy of the Labor Party now is where<br />
it was when we stood against that party at<br />
the last general election. Those two members<br />
of the Labor Party do not run away<br />
from these issues, and I give them credit,<br />
as honest-minded men, for standing up for<br />
their convictions. What conviction has the<br />
honourable gentleman put forward tonight,<br />
that in any way can be tested, as to where<br />
a future Labor Government would stand<br />
on these great issues?<br />
These are not just trivial matters of<br />
debate. The Leader of the Opposition has<br />
been very clever in debate. He has dodged<br />
every harsh issue that has been presented<br />
to him just as he did when Prime Minister<br />
Ky came to this country. The honourable<br />
gentleman's Party was opposed to the visit<br />
of Prime Minister Ky. His then Leader<br />
said that he was going to march in demonstrations<br />
against this visit, and he did so.<br />
But where was the present Leader of the<br />
Opposition? He was having a damn good<br />
holiday somewhere, well out of the line of<br />
fire, and no-one knew where he stood. So<br />
he came back as Leader of the Opposition.<br />
He had given the public to understand that<br />
when he came into office as Leader there<br />
would be a dramatic change in the attitude<br />
of . the Labor Party to our position in Vietnam.<br />
He was the moderate man. He did<br />
not go along with his former Leader. But<br />
after the Adelaide Conference where has<br />
he gone? Did not this Conference decideand<br />
I ask for confirmation from the honourable<br />
member for Yarra-that the Labor<br />
Party was where it was at the time of the<br />
last election? Of course it did, and the<br />
honourable member for Yarra said so, as<br />
did the President of the Victorian Branch<br />
of the Labor Party and the former Leader<br />
of the Labor Party. But where does Labor<br />
stand under the present Leader of the<br />
Opposition? I invite honourable members to<br />
follow through the 19 pages of carefully<br />
prepared and studiously avoided references and try to find out where the Labor Party<br />
stands on these great issues. This is not<br />
good enough for the Australian people. We<br />
have never shirked the issue in two World<br />
Wars, in Korea and in Vietnam.<br />
Mr Birrell--What do you mean by<br />
' we'? Mr HAROLD HOLT-When I say ' we',<br />
I mean the Australian people. I have the<br />
honour tonight, as Leader of a Goveinment<br />
elected with the greatest majority in<br />
the history of this country, to speak for<br />
the Australian people. The Leader of the<br />
Opposition tried to confuse the issue for<br />
us by quoting Lee Kuan Yew, the Prime<br />
Minister of Singapore. Has he overlooked<br />
the statements that Lee Kuan Yew has<br />
been making recently about the mincing<br />
machine and about what would happen to<br />
Singapore and other South East Asian<br />
countries if America withdrew from Vietnam?<br />
The Leader of the Opposition made<br />
a cheap sneer at my colleague, the honourable<br />
member for Evans ( Dr Mackay), and<br />
quoted a number of eminent clergymen. I<br />
do not like quoting clergymen on matters<br />
of this sort because I believe that we, as<br />
the elected representatives of the people,<br />
have to take the decisions on these matters.<br />
But when the honourable gentleman purports<br />
to give the view of eminent clergymen,<br />
why does not he quote the view of<br />
Archbishop Loane of Sydney? Why does he<br />
not quote the view expressed publicly and<br />
which appeared in more than one newspaper,<br />
of Cardinal Gilroy on his return to<br />
Australia? Both these gentlemen spoke of<br />
the importance of this resistance to Communism<br />
in South Vietnam. I am not going<br />
to quote them extensively tonight but the<br />
quotations are here if anyone want to<br />
check them.<br />
The Leader of the Opposition took a<br />
long time to read a mass of material. I am<br />
not seeking half the time he took and I do<br />
not want an extension of time. But I can<br />
say a great deal about where the honourable<br />
gentleman stands, or more correctly,<br />
fails to stand. Cofsistent with his normal<br />
processes of deception or at least evasion,<br />
the honourable gentleman tried to convey<br />
the impression to us, not once but repeatedly,<br />
that the Secretary. of Defence in<br />
the United States of : America is somehow </p>
<p>out of sorts with his. colleagues'! in. the. Administration<br />
on the question of bombing.<br />
A great deal can be said for. and against the<br />
bombing. But the view held by the United<br />
States Administration and the view held<br />
by this Government and other allied governments<br />
has been that bombing serves valuable<br />
military purposes; that it helps to raise<br />
the morale of the South Vietnamese who<br />
do not feel themselves abandoned in this<br />
struggle; ' that it ' helps to prevent the flow<br />
of men: ' and " materials to the South; and<br />
that it helps to save allied lives which otherwise<br />
would be endangered if this flow of<br />
materials and men were not impeded in<br />
this way. That does not mean that we are<br />
not'able to look, as the occasion arises, at<br />
some move for a suspension or pause-in<br />
the bombing if it is genuinely felt that this<br />
would serve some purpose in attracting the<br />
North Vietnamese to peace negotiations.<br />
We have never taken a hard and fast line<br />
oh these issues.<br />
The honourable gentleman, from the comfort<br />
of this place, slanders us repeatedly as<br />
men who have no wish for peace. I reject<br />
that and throw it in his teeth. We want<br />
peace as much as anyone in this country.<br />
We want peace for Australia because there<br />
are great things that we can do with our<br />
country, given a situation. of peace. How<br />
can any man knowing the views of other<br />
leaders in South East Asia, and knowing<br />
the view so recently and so movingly put<br />
to us by the leader of a country: that is<br />
currently under invasion and aggression by<br />
the forces of North Vietnam, talk in the<br />
way that the honourable gentleman has<br />
talked to us tonight? If the Australian<br />
people are to look for leadership<br />
and. guidance-from the present<br />
Leader: of the . Opposition. they will<br />
look in vain. He will be the artful<br />
dodger as long as he can go on dodging,<br />
until he has to face up to this issue directly.<br />
We ask him to face up to it. Would he pull<br />
Australian troops out of South Vietnam?<br />
Would he endanger our alliance with the<br />
United States? We argued last November<br />
that Australia was in Vietnam for the same<br />
reasons that it had been in two world wars<br />
and in Korea. We said that we recognised<br />
that we were not merely defending a country<br />
against aggression and defending the way<br />
of life we believe in but also that we were<br />
giving strength to our own alliance with the United States, a country which, above all<br />
others, . can help to keep Australia secure<br />
in our alliance iudder ANZUS. The honourable<br />
gentleman has made -no mention ' of<br />
these matters tonight.. Is he reckless or<br />
regardless of the effect it would have on<br />
our alliance with the United States if we<br />
were to pull our troops out of Vietnam, as<br />
the Adelaide Conference proposed? That<br />
alliance was vital to us before the British<br />
decision to withdraw east of Suez. It is even<br />
more important for us today now that we<br />
know there is a time schedule on the British<br />
presence in this area and certainly as a<br />
land force in the Asian area. These are vital<br />
matters for the people of this country. The<br />
people are not to be fobbed off by a long<br />
speech that covers up with a smoke screen<br />
of words the basic points that are involved<br />
in these proposals that we have to face. I<br />
would like to hear the honourable gentleman<br />
at some time-and he has not yet<br />
done so in his long period of leadershipface<br />
up to these matters.<br />
Mr McNamara, at the conclusion of his<br />
statement before the Preparedness Investigating<br />
Sub-Committee of the Senate Armed<br />
Services Committee, on 25th August 1967,<br />
said: -In conclusion I would like to restate my view<br />
that the present objectives of our bombing in the<br />
north were soundly conceived and are being effectively<br />
pursued. They are consistent with our overall<br />
purposes in Vietnam and with our efforts to<br />
confine the conflict. We are constantly exploring<br />
ways of improving our efforts to insulate South<br />
Vietnam from outside attack and support. Further<br />
refinements in our air campaign may help. I am<br />
convinced, however, that the final decision in this<br />
conflict will not come until we and our allies<br />
prove to North Vietnam she cannot win in the<br />
south. The tragic and long drawn-out character<br />
of that conflict in the south makes very tempting<br />
the prospect of replacing it with some new kind<br />
of air campaign against the north..<br />
He wastalking against those who were then<br />
advocating a very much more intensive<br />
bombing campaign; he was not critical of<br />
the campaign being conducted. He was giving<br />
his explanation as to why he was resisting<br />
more intensive bombing. He continued:<br />
However tempting, such an alternative seems<br />
to me completely illusory. To pursue this objective<br />
would not only be futile but would involve<br />
risks to our personnel and to our nation that I<br />
am unable to recommend.<br />
Later on he continued:<br />
The bombing of North Vietnam has always been<br />
considered a supplement to, and not a substitute<br />
for, an effective counter-insurgency campaign in </p>
<p>South Vietnam. These were our objectives when<br />
our bombing programme was initiated in February<br />
of 1965. They remain our objectives today.<br />
Our bombing campaign has been aimed at<br />
selected targets of military significance, primarily<br />
the routes of infiltration. It has been carefully<br />
tailored to accomplish its basic objectives and<br />
thus to achieve the limited purposes toward which<br />
all our activities in Vietnam are directed.<br />
Having said that, I hope that the House will<br />
not hear this distortion again from the honourable<br />
gentleman who has tried to present<br />
some picture of either disloyalty or disagreement<br />
between the United States Secretary<br />
of Defence, -his President and other senior<br />
members of the Administration. The honourable<br />
gentleman began his speech by<br />
twitting the Government for the fact that<br />
it had not go ne on with the debate on<br />
Tuesday night. He said that a move came<br />
from honourable gentlemen opposite. It is<br />
interesting to recall that the vote was put<br />
and the motion to go on with the discussion<br />
on Vietnam attracted twenty-two votes from<br />
the Opposition and was resisted by fifty-three<br />
votes from this side of the House.<br />
Mr Birrell-How many were absent from<br />
each side?<br />
Mr HAROLD HOLT-A lot were missing<br />
from each side because nobody expected<br />
the* debate to come on at that time. It<br />
resulted from a move made by the honourable<br />
member for Yarra ( Dr J. F. Cairns)-<br />
I stand subject to correction on this-without<br />
consultation with his leader.<br />
Dr J. F. Cairns-I correct the Prime<br />
Minister forthwith.<br />
Mr HAROLD HOLT-Does the honourable<br />
member correct me? Did he approve of<br />
the motion?<br />
Dr J. F. Cairns--Yes.<br />
Mr HAROLD HOLT-Although the<br />
Opposition could only amass twenty-two votes for that particular motion I am glad<br />
to hear there is this identity of view and<br />
purpose between the honourable member<br />
for Yarra and the Leader of the Opposition.<br />
At least they could come together on the<br />
statement that the Leader of the Opposition<br />
has made, because he has carefully avoided<br />
every issue on which there was any possibility<br />
of conflict between any member of his<br />
Party and any other member of his Party.<br />
He has left unresolved for the people of<br />
this nation where the Australian Labor<br />
Party stands on the issue of Vietnam. He<br />
has not told us whether or not Australian<br />
troops should be there. He has not told us<br />
whether or not, if elected to Government,<br />
he would carry out the Adelaide decisions.<br />
On television, on an earlier occasion, I<br />
think he did go so far as to say that this<br />
would be the policy of his Party. Why has<br />
he not reasserted it here in the national<br />
Parliament? He is the one who is always<br />
demanding that the Government come and<br />
debate against him, yet when the Government<br />
debates against him in this Parliament<br />
he will not face the issues that the<br />
public are anxiously expecting to hear<br />
resolved. The plain fact of the matter is that today<br />
the Australian Labor Party stands, despite<br />
the facelift and despite the glamorous new<br />
leadership, where it stood at the last general<br />
election. It still stands for a troops-out policy<br />
in Vietnam. It still stands against our participation<br />
in Vietnam. As long as that is the<br />
policy honestly presented by the Australian<br />
Labor Party then the Australian people will<br />
have no truck with it. It is because the Australian<br />
people will have no truck with it<br />
that the honourable gentleman -spent<br />
minutes tonight setting up a smoke screen<br />
to obscure the fact that he is not prepared<br />
to tell the people of Australia where the<br />
Australian Labour Party stands on this<br />
matter.<br />
