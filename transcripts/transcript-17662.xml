<p>People affected by the December bushfires, storms and floods in Western Australia have access to a range of Commonwealth assistance through the Natural Disaster Relief and Recovery Arrangements (NDRRA).</p>
<p>These payments are jointly funded by the Commonwealth and WA Governments and administered through WA Government agencies.</p>
<p>This includes: </p>
<p> * 	Personal hardship and distress assistance including:<br />
		 * 			The provision of emergency assistance including emergency accommodation, food, essential clothing and other personal items  -  payments of up to $388 per eligible adult and up to $194 per eligible child on the 1st day of assistance (with reductions in payment levels on subsequent days);<br />
		 * 			Temporary living expenses of up to $110 per day per adult/family in the metropolitan area and up to $150 per day per adult/family in country areas;</p>
<p> * 	Up to $5,000 - to assist with the reconnection of electricity.<br />
 * 	Up to $10,000 - for the replacement of white goods and floors coverings.<br />
 * 	Restoration of essential public assets for local councils<br />
 * 	Cost of counter disaster operations<br />
 * 	Interest-rate subsidies for loans of up to $150,000 for small businesses and primary producers<br />
 * 	Professional advice grants and freight subsidies for primary producers; and<br />
 * 	Clean-up and recovery grants of up to $25,000 for small businesses and primary producers.</p>
<p>The Disaster Income Recovery Subsidy</p>
<p>The Government has extended additional support for eligible employees, small businesses and farmers in these areas who can demonstrate a loss of income as a direct result of the bushfires and floods.</p>
<p>The Disaster Income Recovery Subsidy is a fortnightly payment of up to the maximum rate of existing Newstart Allowance for a period of 13 weeks. The subsidy will be available to those who will experience a loss of income as a direct result of the cyclone and its impact and are not currently receiving any other income support payment or pension.</p>
<p>The Commonwealth Government will support these people who will be unable to work through no fault of their own.</p>
