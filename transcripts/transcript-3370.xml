EMBARGO: 3.00 P. M.<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON. E. G. WHITLAM, M. P.,<br />
AT THE OPENING OF THE MAROONDAH SOCIAL HEALTH CENTRE, RINGWOOD,<br />
MELBOURNE, SUNDAY 1 SEPTEMBER 1974<br />
One of the greatest areas of inequality which exists<br />
in Australia is in the field of health care. Too many areas<br />
lack adequate hospitals and too many people don't have ready<br />
access to the services of doctors and other skilled medical<br />
workers. The provision of medical services has simply not kept<br />
pace with the changes in our society. This applies particularly<br />
in our cities. Hospitals, doctors and other services are spread<br />
unevenly and unfairly. They tend to be clustered in long-established<br />
and generally affluent areas. In contrast, people in newer and<br />
frequently disadvantaged areas have not had-proper access to the<br />
amount of high-quality care on which all Australians should be<br />
able to depend. It is quite wrong that people in some areas of our<br />
cities should only have to travel a few miles to receive treatment<br />
at a major hospital, while other people in the same metropolis<br />
are faced with journeys of 20 miles or more to get this treatment.<br />
It is equally wrong that people in some areas should have available<br />
a more than sufficient number of doctors to provide medical<br />
treatment while people in other areas suffer a shortage of doctors.<br />
It has been clear for some years that not enough<br />
would be done to overcome-these inequalities until the Australian<br />
Government, the national government, assumed a greater responsibility<br />
for the provision of hospital and medical services throughout the<br />
nation. It is for this reason that the present Government last<br />
year initiated an urgent and thorough examination of the nation's<br />
health services. A Hospitals and Health Services Interim<br />
Committee, which later became by statute the Hospitals and Health<br />
Services Commission, was appointed to investigate, report on,<br />
and recommend necessary action to overcome both immediate and longterm<br />
problems. The objective of the Commission is:<br />
" The provision of high-quality, readily accessible,<br />
reasonably comprehensive, co-ordinated and efficient<br />
health and related welfare services at local, regional,<br />
State and national levels."<br />
Acting on the recommendations of the Commission the<br />
Government has already started moving towards the satisfaction<br />
of this objective. In the last financial year, for example,<br />
we allocated $ 4.5 million to meet urgent needs for additional<br />
hospitals in Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane. </p>
<p>Perhaps the most exciting initiatives have been taken in<br />
the field of community health services. In 1973 the Government<br />
adopted as a statement of policy and principle the recommendations<br />
contained in the report entitled " A Community Health Program for<br />
Australia", prepared by the Hospitals and Health Services<br />
Interim Committee. In addition to the community health program<br />
based on that report, it introduced the Mental Health and Related<br />
Services Assistance Act last year to provide the basis for its<br />
separate, but closely associated, community mental health,<br />
alcoholism and drug dependency program. Both programs were<br />
introduced by the Government to foster the development of a high<br />
standard of community-based health care services. They were in<br />
accordance with the Government's announced health policy of<br />
providing regionally organised, community-based services with<br />
greater emphasis on health education, prevention and rehabilitation,<br />
and as a real alternative to hospital and other high-cost health<br />
resources. A total of $ 17.5 million was allocated under these programs<br />
in 1973/ 74. This consisted of $ 10 million under the community<br />
health program and $ 7.5 million under the community mental health,<br />
alcoholism and drug dependency program. A further $ 7.5 million is<br />
available under the latter program in 1974/ 75, after which it will<br />
be encompassed in the more broadly based community health program.<br />
The majority of projects approved under both programs in 1973/ 74<br />
will be operated by State health authorities. However, a<br />
significant number of volunteer and community organisations have<br />
also received Australian Government financial assistance.<br />
The Maroondah Social Health Centre is a good example of a<br />
community-based service which has received the Government's assistance.<br />
The centre had its origins in the St. Stephen's ( Methodist-Presbyterian)<br />
Social Health Board and was formed as a voluntary benevolent organisatio<br />
at a public meeting at Ringwood on 5 November 1973. Its aim is to<br />
help overcome the deficiency in services dealing with emotional and<br />
psychiatric problems in this area of suburban Melbourne. The<br />
Australian Government first became involved in assisting the project<br />
in April when the Minister for Health, Dr. Everingham, approved a<br />
grant of $ 10,500 to cover salaries and wages at the centre unti).<br />
the end of the 1973/ 74 financial year. A further grant of $ 9,000<br />
was approved in July for the first quarter of the new financial year.<br />
Since that allocation was made the Government has been<br />
considering further assistance. In its deliberations it has benefited<br />
from the representations made by the member for the federal electorate<br />
of Casey, Mr. Race Mathews, on behalf of the Centre. As a result I<br />
am able to announce that the Government has allocated $ 27,908 towards<br />
the project for the last three quarters of 1974/ 75. This includes<br />
$ 23,640 for salaries and $ 1,462 for the rent of the premises from<br />
which the service operates.<br />
This assistance forms part of an integrated network of<br />
community services being developed by the Government in the eastern<br />
suburbs of Melbourne. In the last month the Minister for Health has<br />
approved another substantial allocation to help in the development<br />
of these services. He approved the allocation of $ 600,000 to the<br />
Victorian Hospitals and Charities Commission to buy a private hospital<br />
in Ringwood which is being converted to a day hospital, rehabilitation<br />
centre and short-term hostel for physically handicapped people the<br />
first such facility to be provided in the eastern suburbs. </p>
<p>-3-<br />
I believe that an important lesson can be drawn from these<br />
allocations. They demonstrate the Government's continuing commitment<br />
to major reform in the provision of health and other services.<br />
In view of the current economic difficulties facing Australia,<br />
some people may have begun to doubt that continuing commitment.<br />
They may have begun to think that inflation and related economic<br />
problems would cripple our program of reform. Some may have begun<br />
to think that the effect of our current economic problems might be<br />
to prevent the present Government from making any significant<br />
difference to our society.<br />
I want to affirm now that our program of reform will continue.<br />
I want to affirm now that we will continue to work towards the<br />
eradication of the kind of inequalities that I have described in<br />
relation to health services. If anyone doubts that a sufficiently<br />
determined Government can make a difference in these areas, they<br />
should ask the people of Deer Park in Melbourne of the benefits they<br />
have received from their new community health centre. If anyone<br />
doubts the difference that can be made, they should ask the people of<br />
Caufield of the extra services that have been made possible by our<br />
assistance to the Caufield Community Care Centre. Equally they could<br />
check on the benefits that have flowed from the establishment of<br />
health centres at Ingle Farm and Clovelly Park in Adelaide. They<br />
could also seek the opinion of the thousands of people who are<br />
receiving new ancillary health services in the Illawarra region<br />
south of Sydney or in the western metropolitan region of Sydney itself.<br />
The Government has demonstrated that it can make a difference<br />
in the provision of health services in these and many other areas.<br />
Despite any economic problems we might face, we will continue to<br />
demonstrate that difference. Our commitment to reform does not,<br />
of course, apply only to health services. We have already transformed<br />
the funding of education at all levels. That transformation will<br />
continue. We have already begun in Albury/ Wodonga the first major<br />
program of decentralisation in this country. That program will continue.<br />
We have already begun to inject large sums of national finance into<br />
our ailing urban transport system. That injection will continue.<br />
In the last fortnight we have announced the provision of $ 56 million<br />
to councils to help reduce inequalities between local government<br />
regions. That drive against inequality will continue. And we have<br />
made it quite clear that we will go ahead with the greatly expanded<br />
program for the care and education of pre-school children.<br />
The present Government believes that major reforms cannot be<br />
achieved in any of these: areas without its involvement, without<br />
national involvement. The States by themselves simply don't have the<br />
trwidis to oii' about the chancres that are ncn. dec. The national Government<br />
does have these funds and any. current economic problems will not prevent<br />
it from bringing about improvements in essential services. Our<br />
dedication remains to the creation of the best community services<br />
that the country can afford.<br />
There are those who are quick to criticise government spending.<br />
There are those who would argue that at a time of economic difficulty<br />
we should cut back on all our programs. Nothing could be more short<br />
sighted. Indeed, if we accept that wage and salary increases are part<br />
of the inflationary problem, we should see these programs as helping<br />
to counter that problem. / 4 </p>
<p>-4-<br />
For, if we can provide a range of community services<br />
to satisfy the reasonable needs of all citizens and to create<br />
reasonable opportunities for all citizens, we will have taken<br />
a step towards reducing what might be termed the incomes mentality that<br />
is so prevalent in our society. Our aim here is to enable people<br />
not to have to look to their individual earning power to satisfy<br />
so many of their basic needs.<br />
The meeting of these needs by providing adequate<br />
services must depend on Government action. An increased wage<br />
alone is not going to ensure that a worker's children will receive<br />
a proper education. An increased wage will not guarantee access<br />
by that worker's family to high-quality medical and hospital care<br />
at a reasonable cost. An increased wage will not grant him adequate<br />
transport, roads, child care facilities, recreation outlets and<br />
the like, In turn, if that worker can look to the Government to<br />
provide these facilities and services, he will not be so dependent<br />
on seeking ever-increasing wages.<br />
Thus, our program of reform can fulfil two purposes.<br />
It can help reduce inequality in our society. At the same time<br />
it can help produce economic stability. The current economic<br />
climate will not stop the Government from pursuing and achieving<br />
these twin goals. </p>
