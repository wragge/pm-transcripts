PRIME MINISTER<br />
REMARK$~ BY 7THE PRCIME M4INISTER, THE HON P J KEATING, MP<br />
DINNER HOSTED BY THE PRIME MINISTER OF SINGAPORE,<br />
MR GOli CHO1N TONG<br />
Mr Prime Minister, distinguished guests.<br />
Thank you very much for this generous reception.<br />
F'or Auotralian Prime Ministers cominlg to Singapore has<br />
alwaYe been a pleasure though it must be said that these<br />
days it LB invariably business that we do.<br />
The pleasure uonies fropi doing business with people who I've<br />
always thought shared with Australians a certain personal<br />
style. Some people say that we're both inclined to be a bit blunt<br />
which I will accept on the condition that it doesn't imply<br />
we're not sharp.<br />
I would prerar to think that we're candid direct. We both<br />
like to get to the heart of the matter.<br />
Getting to the heart of the matter is what this visit of<br />
mine to Singapore and Japan and Cambodia is all about.<br />
I want to talk directl~ y to leaders in the region which<br />
matters most to Australia.<br />
As kyou and I both know, Prime Minister, these days we are<br />
Seeking an wers to very large question*<br />
ab Qut the future of the world trading sys tern<br />
about Lhe institutional arrangements we need to cteate<br />
in this part of the world<br />
about thlk security consequences which flow from the and<br />
of the cold war </p>

The frankness and frequency of the dialogue between<br />
Singapore and Australia sets a good pattern for what needs<br />
to develop more broadly in the region.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
No people are more conscious than Singaporeans that<br />
economies are dynamic and constant change is required if a<br />
country is to keep up with the pace.<br />
The evidence of how well you know that is all around us here<br />
in Singapore.<br />
Australians are developing the same awareness with a speed<br />
which muy ourpriuu yvu.<br />
The last decade has been a great educators a deregulated,<br />
less protected, much more outward looking economy, like<br />
necessity itself, is a great edutiaor.<br />
Being very much more engaged with the dynamic economies of<br />
Asia has the same effect.<br />
Not that our engagement in Asia is new.<br />
The presence here in February of 1,000 Australian war<br />
veterans and their families to take part in thecommemoration<br />
of the 50th anniversary of the fall of<br />
Singapore was a solemn and significant reminder of that.<br />
But the form and extent of engagement has changed. More<br />
accurately, it is changing. Radically changing.<br />
Our two way trade with Singapore grew by 18 per cent last<br />
year, to $ 4.2 billion,<br />
You are our fourth largest export market, our sixth largest<br />
trading partner.<br />
The operative word is " partner's that 18 what we seek in<br />
Asia partnerships.<br />
It is why I am here.<br />
One of the themes of the Business Seminar which I will be<br />
addressing tomorrow is " strategic linkages'. We are seeking<br />
ways in which business in Australia and Singapore can work<br />
together, bltef ally and in the wider region.<br />
As we found during our discussions this a[ fernoon, Prime<br />
Minister, it is a good theme for this visit, and for our<br />
Droader relationhship. </p>

My visit tomorrow with Defence Minister Yeo to HMAS<br />
Brisbane, which has been exercising with ships of the<br />
Singapore Navy and other partners in the Five Power Defence<br />
Arrangements is a reminder that we have important defence<br />
ties.. The fact that 3000 Singaporeans aro studying in Australia<br />
and, indeed, I understand four members of your C4binet<br />
studied there is further evidence that our relationship<br />
extends beyond pure trade.<br />
But trade is the foundation of it; 80 long as we do all that<br />
Is necessary for business to flourish, we can be confident<br />
that the relationship between Australia and Singapore will<br />
deepen and expand.<br />
I am very confident about our relationship, Prime Minister.<br />
I am very confident about the future.<br />
I thank you for your hospitality tonight and for your<br />
equally generous remarks and I propose a toast.<br />
To you, Prime Minister, and Mrs Goh.<br />
To the prosperity and well-being of the people of Singapore.<br />
And to the friendship between our two countries.<br />
