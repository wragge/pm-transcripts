TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
DOORSTOP, PARLIAMENT HOUSE, CANBSERRAo 26 MARCH 1995<br />
PM. I just thought I would give you a few words on the election and take a<br />
couple of questions. It was obvious the election in the ACT was a<br />
disappointing result for the Government. I think that the community<br />
has wanted to give the Government a message that it wants to be clear<br />
that it's considering its concerns and worrying about its needs I think<br />
that message is well and truly recieved. The important thing is for<br />
people to understand, though they may feel that the Government has<br />
not been closely focussing on their basic needs, it will be important for<br />
the Government to communicate that it has been, that it is no accident<br />
that we have a strong growth, high employment economy out there, but<br />
we are in this sort of twilight land debate as if it is not happening. It is<br />
happening, the Government is now sitting down to do its Budget, and it<br />
will do a serious job as it has done on all the other Budgets before.<br />
And the aim of that will be to preserve the recovery. There has been<br />
this line that we have had 5 minutes of sunshine we have had 36<br />
months of growth. Three years of growth, and over half a million jobs.<br />
And glib poll lines sent out to people reinforcing their fears is unfair,<br />
and I think one of the important things to say to Australians is the<br />
recovery, the chances of recovery being entirely sustainable, are high,<br />
and the Government will be doing things in the Budget to maintain that<br />
sustainability. But, the public want the Government to do better, in<br />
terms of these economic and fundamental things, and better we will<br />
do. Now, can I just say though, I think the poll does not reflect well on John<br />
Howard to be associated with this sort of push-polling technique, and<br />
Michael Baume running around releasing peoples' tax returns is an un-<br />
Australian way to behave. And, can I just make this other point:-when<br />
there is a real election on as there was in NSW that goes down to<br />
the wire on the big issues, the Green vote has been important. There<br />
has been a perception that the Government hasn't had control of this<br />
forestry debate ' though I think about 60% of green preferences will<br />
come back to the Government. I just make these two points about the<br />
Greens one, we will be, over five years, phasing out woodchips, and </p>

two, doing everything to protect native forests. But, they should<br />
understand that John Howard has just nominated as his Shadow<br />
Minister somebody who does not believe in International Treaties, so<br />
the Gordon below Franklin would have been flooded, there would have<br />
been no reserves in the wilderness areas of North Queensland, and<br />
the things that they hold dear would not be satisfied under those sorts<br />
of policies. But, it is important, not just for the Labor Party but for the<br />
nation, to get these Green issues right because global warming is here<br />
with us whether we like it or not, this will be an important international<br />
issue from here on in, and we have a unique opportunity here to<br />
preserve our Australian environment, and I want to do that.<br />
Can I just say about NSW, I think that Bob Carr has done<br />
tremendously well in NSW. He has got a better than even chance of<br />
forming a Government, and I will be looking forw~ ard to doing as much<br />
as I can with him and his colleagues.<br />
J: Prime Minister, there may have been 36 months of recovery, but the<br />
people of Canberra seem to be mighty ungrateful do you think that<br />
says something about the fundamentals of economic policy, or simply<br />
your ability to get the message out?<br />
P M; We have gone.... the facts are that the economy is growing at around<br />
and there was the largest fall in unemployment last year than any<br />
year on record. We have got 600,000 jobs that was the principle<br />
matter the Government gave commitments on in the election on that<br />
we have delivered, in very full measure. Now, interest rates have<br />
basically spooked people, they think that in some way we are heading<br />
for the sort of 1980s interest rate changes we are not. We are not.<br />
What we are heading for is the sustainable economic recovery. And<br />
the doomsayers who have switched straight off jobs and<br />
unemployment, straight onto interest rates and the current account,<br />
have got to be held accountable for at least misleading the public<br />
about the value and quality of the recovery we have had. Now, you<br />
have got to remember this about the ACT, too there has just been a<br />
local election here, there has been a substantial swing against the<br />
Labor Party here, the property market here is flat they are a bit out of<br />
sorts. There is a bit of that in it, but whether it is or not, the message is<br />
clear there In the ACT election, and I am taking that message on<br />
board.<br />
J: Do you take any personal resposibility for this, given that....<br />
PM: I am the Prime Minister, and what Prime Ministers do is they take<br />
responsibility for things, and I take it for any loss we suffer. I hope to<br />
be also taking it for the next election when we win.<br />
J: Graham Richardson said you have got to take a big mea culpa on this<br />
election? </p>
<p>TEL: 26. Mar. 95 15: 19 No. UU<br />

PM: f-Laurie Oakes addressing Graham as Mr Richardson, as a paid<br />
employee and a surrogate I mean he had the Federal Secretary of<br />
the Labor Party on there, but a paid employee of Mr Packer trying to<br />
represent himself as the Labor Party sorry, he had the Federal<br />
Secretary of the Liberal Party and a paid employee of Mr Packer trying<br />
to represent himself as the Labor Party I mean, a lot of credibility<br />
went down he drain this morning on that performance.<br />
J* ( inaudible)...<br />
PM: Look, Graham has taken his thirty pieces of silver let him have them,<br />
but don't give advice to me.<br />
J Do you think the message, though, in the Canberra<br />
election... ( inaudible) about your personal style, Mr Keating do you<br />
think there are any lessons you should take from that?<br />
PM-I think % A/ P 211 tgko loccon~ c 00IAo go through public life and Iifc'a<br />
experiences, but remember this look at the social changes of the last<br />
few weeks: seven-zero on the Native Title, Mabo, the Land Fund.<br />
They are great social and cultural victories for this country. We are<br />
now putting together a Budget, and the Budget will be a good Budget,<br />
but as always a well thought out Budget. And it is these matters of<br />
substance in the last year since the election we have had APEC<br />
threading together the Pacific Rim these are the matters of substance<br />
and the extent that style and the way the Government is working<br />
affects the perceptions of the substance, that is an important matter for<br />
us.<br />
J: There is a line now coming out of NSW that you personally your<br />
image cost the Labor Party 2-3% of the vote?<br />
PMV; We have got a majority of Federal Seats in NSW, and I just say this<br />
about NSW the view being taken that the the problem that the NSW<br />
Labor Party had with Mr Fahey's incumbency, Mr Fahey was<br />
expropriating the growth and jobs delivered to him by this Federal<br />
Labor Government. But, by the Federal Labor Party not being<br />
involved in the campaign, it meant that Mr Fahey was able to claim<br />
that, and in being able to claim it, I think, that's the difference in the<br />
campaign.<br />
J: ( inaudible)... change your style of leadership, Mr Keating?<br />
PMV. I have never sought to be an outrageously popular Prime Minister, but<br />
I have sought to be a very good Prime Minister. I have sought to do,<br />
and push through, all the policy changes that people lushed out on in<br />
the last 30 years. The people that passed the parcel in Federal<br />
politics on opening the country up, of giving us an identity of our own,<br />
of giving us a place in Asia, of making us an innovative, high-tech,<br />
educated society they are the issues that are important. And, I will go 3 P. 03/ 04! </p>
<p>4<br />
for the substance rather than the shadow every day of the week when<br />
it comes to those things.<br />
J: With the Budget, are you going to reconsider the Government's<br />
general frame of the Budget now to put more emphasis on<br />
the... .( inaudible)<br />
PM: The Government has a mature process running on the Budget, it has<br />
from the start, and we are still in the Budget round now. And, all this I<br />
think will confirm our view that we have got to do an exemplary job of<br />
it, as I hope we have done in the past. One more question.<br />
J Do you think Federal Labor should have taken a greater role in the<br />
NSW campaign?<br />
PM. When you are fighting an incumbent Government, you have got the<br />
problem of incumbency. The incumbency in this case attached to it<br />
was jobs and growth that was delivered by the Labor Party not the<br />
divisible Labor Party, the one Labor Party. So, a campaign that ends<br />
up being essentially a marginal strategy, suffers from one fact and<br />
that is, you can't claw that basic commitment of the public of<br />
understanding that the growth and jobs in NSW came from Labor.<br />
There is not one major private sector project in NSW that the Fahey<br />
Government can lay claim to the only thing it can lay claim to are<br />
railways, or public sector construction jobs there is not one major<br />
private project in NSW. The growth that is there the growth that is<br />
coming through the general economy, and the employment is coming<br />
off the policies not of the Fahey Government, but of this Government.<br />
I though that was an important point.<br />
ends.<br />
