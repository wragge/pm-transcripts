The Prime Minister Julia Gillard today announced there would be a State Funeral Service for the Honourable Kenneth Shaw Wriedt, a highly respected member of the Australian Labor Party and of the Federal and Tasmanian Parliaments.</p>
<p>Mr Wriedt was a Senator for Tasmania from 1967 to 1980 during which time he served as a well-regarded Minister during the Whitlam Government, holding the portfolios of Primary Industry (later Agriculture) from 1972 to 1975, Minerals and Energy in 1975 and Leader of the Government in the Senate.</p>
<p>He also served as Leader of the Opposition in the Senate from 1975 to 1980.</p>
<p>Mr Wriedt subsequently transferred to Tasmanian state politics in 1982, serving as Leader of the Opposition and as Minister for Police and Emergency Services and Roads and Transport in the Field Government from 1989 to 1990.</p>
<p>Ken Wriedt will be long remembered as one of the true gentlemen of Australian politics, a man of decency and integrity who contributed greatly to the public life in our nation.</p>
<p>Mr Wriedt's wife of five decades, Helga, sadly predeceased him just a month ago, and he is survived by their daughters Paula and Sonia and four grandchildren.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister said the service would provide members of the Federal and Tasmanian Parliaments and members of the public with the opportunity to pay their respects to a long-serving and distinguished political leader.</p>
<p>The service will be held at 11am on Wednesday 27 October 2010 at the Federation Concert Hall, 1 Davey Street, Hobart.</p>
<p>Further details in relation to the service can be obtained by phoning 03 6232 7120 or 03 6232 7130. </p>
