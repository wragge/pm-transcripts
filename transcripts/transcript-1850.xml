HRH THE DUKE OF EDINBURGH'S THIRD<br />
COMMONWEALTH STUDY CONFERENCE.:<br />
CANBERRA THEATRE, CANBERRA<br />
Welcoming Address<br />
by the Prime Minister, the lit, Hon, J. G. Gorton 16 MA I' 1968<br />
I don't really think that-what I am proposing to do this morning<br />
is to give a lecture. 7That I thought I was doing was to give<br />
a welcome, and indeed, that is what I do with great warmth on<br />
behalf of the Government of Australia and the people of Australa<br />
to all of you who are gathered together here in what is our<br />
National Capital.<br />
We haven't had a national capital for very long. It is only,<br />
I suppose 67, 68 years I'm not very good at precise<br />
mathematics of that kind, but early in this century that what<br />
were previously six completely separate and sovereign states<br />
federated in this nation of Australia and chose Canberra as<br />
the capital of the nation. I think it has probably only been<br />
in the last fifteen years that the people of this country as<br />
a whole, whether they come from Perth, or Darwin, or the north<br />
of Queensland, or wherever it may be, have come to look upon<br />
this city as a national symbol not as one which they would<br />
like to see their tax money spent in, in preference to the<br />
particular region from which they come, but es one in which they<br />
would like to see tax money spent in preference to most other<br />
regions from which they don't come. As a consequence, it has<br />
grown, and grown in a planned way.<br />
I think, Sir, that when you visited this city first it had some<br />
28,000 people. It now has 100,000, and we expect that early<br />
in the 1980' s it will be a quarter of a million. It was the<br />
idea of a young man, that is to say, the planning of it was the<br />
idea of a young man 34 years old at the time when he first<br />
drew the circuits, the streets, the general way of getting<br />
around Canberra which has resulted in almost every tourist who<br />
comes here getting lost at least twice. Sut which, nevertheless,<br />
has oiven a feeling of space, a feeling of ovnership, a feeling<br />
of pride, I think, to most of those who live in the capital.<br />
It is more than merely a capital city. It is the place in which<br />
those leading members of the public service wvho, I understand,<br />
are to speak to you at a later hour this day, live and work, and<br />
for the most part, have their being. Of course, some of them<br />
have still not yet been brought to The capital.<br />
It is the seat of government at any rate of Commonwealth<br />
Government which, in a Federal system as any of you who come<br />
from federated countries know, is a government which bears all<br />
the odium of anything vyhich has to be done in order to raise<br />
taxation and gets none of the credit for any of the benefits<br />
which flow from it. Nevertheless, it is here that , reat<br />
government decisions are made, and it is on the advice of those<br />
who will be speaking to you that those government decisions are<br />
at any rate sometimes based. Niow that I will leave for them<br />
to talk about. They will sa7y how it is that a government service </p>
<p>( 2)<br />
in Australia operates. They will explain, better than I could<br />
explain, the duties and responsibilities which lie upon them<br />
and they will, no doubt, very carefully point out that while<br />
they are responsible for advice, they are not responsible for<br />
policy, and indeed, they are responsible for carrying out<br />
policies decided by governments, governments being elected by<br />
the people of Australia because vie are, as I think you have<br />
been told, a country which is wedded to democracyj<br />
The theme of the conference is, as I understand it, how to make<br />
a machine work for the good of man, rather than to have men<br />
existing to serve machines, hov,,' to harness the industrial development<br />
and invention which takes place so that that industrial<br />
development and invention, causing as it nearly always does,<br />
disruption initially, will never~ theless eventually provide a<br />
better life than was possible before the invention took place.<br />
This question is one which has bedevilled man for far back in<br />
history. In Great Britain, the country from which my father<br />
came, I remember reading of Luddite riots which took place when,<br />
for the first time, the cottage industries '-, hich had employed<br />
people in weaving and other methods of making their living were<br />
threatened by the incipient factories which at that time were<br />
brought in because it was found that things could be made cheaper,<br />
and in many cases better. But although things could be made<br />
cheaper, and in many cases better, nevertheless a pattern of<br />
life was disrupted and a pattern of home employment was put in<br />
jeopardy, and so there were riots.<br />
Yet, the eventual results of the invention, of course, advanced<br />
immensely the m6terial standard of living of those in that<br />
country. In the case of the industrial revolution which swept<br />
the world I suppose, if I may oversimplify beginning with<br />
the invention of steam, in that time also we had the same problem<br />
repeated, with great industrial capacity created, with infinitely<br />
more efficiency brought to bear on t-he production of the needs<br />
of individual people, but with individual people indiscriminately<br />
being herded into those " dark Satanic mills", about which words<br />
were written at the time.<br />
' Well, we have moved from those days, We have moved to understand,<br />
as this conference will discuss, how we can use the new inventions<br />
which come pouring in upon us, which must in many cases disrupt<br />
existing patterns of employment how we can use them so that we<br />
avoid human distress, so that we avoid human displacement, so<br />
that we achieve the benefits that the new inventions will bring<br />
to us.<br />
In order to do this, we need more than a mere understanding of<br />
the inventions themselves, than a mere understanding of the<br />
application of new principles, important though this may be,<br />
for these new scientific achievements, these new technological<br />
achievements are bringing to us as human beings a capacity for<br />
good which I think has not been know,, n in the world before to the<br />
extent to which it is, and a capacity for evil, which I think<br />
has not been known in the world before to the extent to which<br />
it is. Just as the invention of fire was the invention of<br />
something which could be used on the hearth of a home to warm </p>
<p>( 3)<br />
a family during a winter's night, or to provide a meal which<br />
was not raw and half-burnt, so the invention of fire could be<br />
used, and has been used, to destroy cities and irreplaceable<br />
libraries4 Just as the understanding of the atom has enabled<br />
immense advantage in medical techniques and in industrial<br />
techniques, and I think and hope for the future, provided a<br />
chance for dry continents such as our own to take water from<br />
the sea and turn that water into the fresh water that we need,<br />
so the understanding of the atom has also given an opportunity<br />
for cities and regions to be laid waste,<br />
Therefore, it is more than merely understanding the scientific<br />
changes, more than merely understanding the technological changes<br />
which are required. It is an understanding of human hearts.<br />
It is a call to educate human beings to see that these great<br />
powers now being released are used for good and are not used for<br />
evil. Beyond that, and I think below that, but nevertheless of immense<br />
importance, is this requirement to understand what human needs<br />
are. I know they vary; of course they must from individual<br />
to individual. But there probably must be, I think, some<br />
common human requirement if an individual is to feel himself<br />
fulfilled, if he is to feel that he is living a not merely<br />
materially successful, but a satisfactory life.<br />
These things, I think, we do not yet knowi, but because one of<br />
the by-producats of the scientific revolution is that there is<br />
going to be more and more leisure, more and more capacity for an<br />
individual to move away from the hourly requirement to earn and<br />
leave him more time to develop I did not say " enjoy", but to<br />
develop oneself must be regarded as enjoyment we need to know<br />
more about what it is that people wish to do in this way, and to<br />
provide that along with the harnessing of the scientific and<br />
technical advances made.<br />
That I think, Your Royal Highness, is one of the basic ideas<br />
underlying the whole of this conference, and indeed, the other<br />
conferences you have held. Because these are problems which<br />
are not confined to one country but problems which in varying<br />
degrees already encompass the countries of the world and will<br />
in the future encompass in greater degree more countries, it<br />
is time and more than time that people gathered, as you have<br />
gathered, to discuss these matters. And it may be that if<br />
from your discussions come some ideas which, as ideas are<br />
inclined to do, filter slowly, but filter through a community<br />
and then to a government, then it may be that you will be<br />
providing for your children or your grandchildren a world in<br />
which the great advances which have been made will be understood,<br />
will be used in a proper way in the world, and which<br />
I think we all seek more than anything else the individua~ l<br />
can feel he is contributing to the community in which he lives,<br />
can get satisfaction from that, can feel that whatever it is<br />
inside him which is able to be developed, whether it be musical<br />
talent, artistic talent, literary talent, or any other talent,<br />
is being given full opportunity to burgeon and develop. if<br />
this happens, then a great service will have been done to<br />
mankind. </p>
<p>( 4)<br />
And so I wish you well in your deliberations. I have great<br />
pleasure in welcoming you again, if I may, to the National<br />
Capital, and I hope when you disperse to the cities of this<br />
Commonwealth that you will see for yourselves the problems<br />
still remaining and perhaps suggest some solution. If in<br />
your discussions you disagree as to the precise solutions or<br />
even as to the precise problems, well, Sir, that will be not<br />
at all surprising because it is not unknown for us to disagree<br />
amongst ourselves.<br />
I thank you. </p>
