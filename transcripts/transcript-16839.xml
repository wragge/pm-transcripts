    <content><![CDATA[<p>On behalf of the membership of the Pacific Islands Forum, I wish to formally convey our deepest condolences to Samoa, American Samoa and Tonga for the tragic loss of life as a consequence of the tsunami that struck on the morning of 29 September. Our prayers go out to all of those families who have lost loved ones and those injured or displaced by this tragic event.</p>
<p>I am confident that the Pacific family will do all it can to support the relief efforts in Samoa, American Samoa and Tonga.</p>
<p>As Chair of the Forum, I urge the broader international community to mobilise in support of the relief and recovery efforts and long term reconstruction of the villages and infrastructure devastated by the impacts of both the tsunami and the earthquake. </p>
