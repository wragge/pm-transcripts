THE PRIME MINISTER'S SPEECH<br />
AT THE OPENING OF THE NEW CIVIC CHAMBERS AT QUEANBEYAN<br />
MONDAY,. 21 APRIL, .1975<br />
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN:<br />
THANK YOU FOR INVITING ME TO OPEN TONIGHT QUEANBEYAN'S<br />
NEW COUNCIL CHAMBERS AND BABY HEALTH CENTRES YOU WILL KNOW<br />
THAT I AM NO STRANGER TO QUEANBEYAN HAVING ATTENDED MANY<br />
FUNCTIONS HERE AND HAVING HELD MAJOR CAMPAIGN MEETINGS HERE<br />
IN 1972 AND 1974X THIS OCCASION AFFORDS ME AN OPPORTUNITY<br />
TO RECALL COMMENTS AND COMMITMENTS I MADE AT THOSE CAMPAIGN<br />
MEETINGS AND AN OPPORTUNITY TO DEMONSTRATE HOW MOST OF THAT<br />
PROMISED HAS'BEEN ACHIEVEDX I CHOSE QUEANBEYAN FOR THOSE<br />
CAMPAIGN MEETINGS AND SPOKE ABOUT THE PROBLEMS OF THE CITIES<br />
AND MY GOVERNMENT' S PLANS FOR IMPROVING THEM BECAUSE I<br />
BELIEVED THAT QUEANBEYAN REPRESENTS, IN MICROCOSM, OUR GREAT<br />
CITIES AND THEIR PROBLEMSX<br />
QUEANBEYAN, LIKE THE CITIES OF SYDNEY AND MELBOURNE,<br />
GROWS AT'SUCH A RATE THAT ITS RESOURCES ARE NOT ADEQUATE TO<br />
MEET THE SERVICES DEMAND WHICH ITS GROWTH CREATESX YOUR"<br />
GROWTH OF 5.5 PER CENT PER ANNUM IS CAUSED BY FACTORS NOT<br />
OF YOUR MAKING OR CONTROLX YOU HAVE A BACKLOG IN THE<br />
PROVISION AND EXTENSION OF SERVICES WHICH COMMUNITIES<br />
RIGHTLY EXPECTX YOUR INCOME IS BARELY SUFFICIENT FOR ALL<br />
YOUR NEEDSX LOAN SERVICING PLACESA GREAT BURDEN UPON THE<br />
STRUCTURE OF YOUR FINANCING AND AS WITH OTHER LOCAL GOVERNMENT<br />
ORGANISATIONS IN THE CITIES OF THIS NATION, YOU MUST COMPETE<br />
WITH SISTER ORGANISATIONS IN THE SEMI-GOVERNMENT LOAN MARKET<br />
FOR THE SAME LIMITED SUPPLY OF FUNDSX s @ 2/ s </p>
<p>-2-<br />
IN THE POLICY SPEECH WHICH I DELIVERED ON BEHALF<br />
OF THE AUSTRALIAN LABOR PARTY FOR THE ELECTIONS OF 1972<br />
I SAID: " OUR PROGRAM HAS THREE GREAT AIMS. THEY ARE:<br />
TO PROMOTE EQUALITY<br />
TO INVOLVE THE PEOPLE OF AUSTRALIA IN THE<br />
DECISION-MAKING PROCESSES OF OUR LAND; AND<br />
TO LIBERATE THE TALENTS AND UPLIFT THE<br />
HORIZONS OF THE AUSTRALIAN PEOPLE."<br />
BUT I ALSO SAID IN SPEAKING SPECIFICALLY OF THE<br />
CITIES OF THIS NATION:<br />
" INCREASINGLY, A CITIZEN'S REAL STANDARD OF LIVING,<br />
THE HEALTH OF HIMSELF AND HIS FAMILY1 HIS<br />
CHILDREN'IS OPPORTUNITIES FOR EDUCATION AND<br />
SELF-IMPROVEMENT, HIS ACCESS TO EMPLOYMENT<br />
OPPORTUNITIES, HIS ABILITY TO ENJOY THE NATION'IS<br />
RESOURCES FOR RECREATION AND. CULTURE, HIS ABILITY<br />
TO PARTICIPATE IN THE DECISIONS AND. ACTIONS OF THE<br />
COMMUNITY ARE DETERMINED NOT BY HIS INCOME, NOT BY<br />
THE HOURS HE WORKS, BUT BY WHERE HE LIVES, THIS<br />
IS WHY LABOR BELIEVES THAT THE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT<br />
MUST INVOLVE ITSELF DIRECTLY IN CITIES." 3/. </p>
<p>-3-<br />
BY THE PURSUIT OF THE SECOND AIM WHICH I ASSERTED<br />
IN 1972 TO INVOLVE THE PEOPLE OF AUSTRALIA IN THE<br />
DECISION-MAKING PROCESSES OF OUR NATION MUCH OF OUR PROGRAM<br />
FOR THE CITIES WAS DETERMINED BUT WE ALSO WANTED PUBLIC<br />
PARTICIPATION AND COMMUNITY INVOLVEMENT IN THE IMPLEMENTATION<br />
OF POLICY, ALL THE PROGRAMS UNDERTAKEN BY THE AUSTRALIAN<br />
GOVERNMENT, HOWEVER, HAVE MEANT A GREATER DEGREE OF<br />
INVOLVEMENT BY THE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT IN MATTERS LIKE<br />
SCHOOLS, HOSPITALS AND WELFARE THAN HAD HITHERTO BEEN<br />
ACCEPTED IN AUSTRALIA, THE UNDERLYING PHILOSOPHY IS THIS:<br />
IN MODERN COMMUNITIES EVEN THE WEALTHIEST FAMILY CANNOT<br />
PROVIDE ITS MEMBERS WITH THE BEST EDUCATION, WITH THE BEST<br />
MEDICAL TREATMENT, THE BEST ENVIRONMENT, UNAIDED BY THE<br />
COMMUNITY, INCREASINGLY, THE BASIC SERVICES AND<br />
OPPORTUNITIES WHICH DETERMINE THE REAL STANDARD OF LIFE OF<br />
A FAMILY OR INDIVIDUAL CAN ONLY BE PROVIDED BY THE COMMUNITY<br />
AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE COMMUNITY IS WILLING TO<br />
PROVIDE THEM, EITHER THE COMMUNITY PROVIDES THEM OR THEY<br />
WILL NOT BE PROVIDED AT ALL, IN THE AUSTRALIAN CONTEXT<br />
THIS MEANS THAT THE COMMUNITY, THROUGH THE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT,<br />
MUST FINANCE THEM OR THEY WILL NOT BE FINANCED AT ALL.<br />
.14/, </p>
<p>-4-<br />
OBVIOUSLY THEN OUR PROGRAMS PROVIDE FOR, OR RATHER<br />
POSITIVELY REQUIRE, A LEVEL OF INVOLVEMENT AND INITIATIVE<br />
BY-LOCAL GOVERNMENT, AND BY GROUPS AND INDIVIDUALS IN THE<br />
COMMUNITY. IN ALL OF THIS, WE HAVE FORGED A NEW PARTNERSHIP.-<br />
A PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN GOVERNMENT AND COMMUNITY IN THE<br />
IMPLEMENTATION OF THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT'S POLICIES.<br />
IN QUEANBEYAN, NO LESS THAN IN OUR GREAT CITIES OF<br />
WHICH IT IS A MICROCOSM, THIS PARTNERSHIP HAS BEEN EVIDENT.<br />
THERE-ARE MANY EXAMPLES OF HOW WE HAVE TRIED TO ACHIEVE THIS'<br />
PARTNERSHIP, THIS COMMUNITY PARTICIPATION, THROUGH COMMUNITY<br />
ACTION IN DECISION-MAKING AND POLICY IMPLEMENTATION. SOME<br />
OF THESE ARE: AUSTRALIAN ASSISTANCE PLAN<br />
THE CHILDREN'S COMMISSION<br />
THE SCHOOLS COMMISSION<br />
COMMUNITY HEALTH PROGRAM<br />
AREA IMPROVEMENT PROGRAMS<br />
THE REGIONAL EMPLOYMENT DEVELOPMENT SCHEME<br />
IN MOST OF THESE EXAMPLES WHICH I MENTION, YOUR COMMUNITY<br />
HAS PARTICIPATED, BUT IN YOUR CASE, THERE ARE OTHER EXAMPLES<br />
OF PARTICIPATION OR ACTION BY MY GOVERNMENT WHICH ARE NOT<br />
REPEATED ON A NATIONAL SCALE. LET ME MENTION HERE THE<br />
AREAS IN WHICH WE ARE IN PARTNERSHIP, THAT IS, YOUR COMMUNITY<br />
OF QUEANBEYAN AND MY GOVERNMENT WORKING TOGETHER IN WHATI<br />
CALL THE PARTNERSHIP PROGRAM. a a </p>
<p>UNDER THE AREA IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM A $ 120,000<br />
GRANT MADE UP OF $ 70,000 FOR THE FIRST STAGE OF A<br />
COMMUNITY COMPLEX. $ 32,000 FOR CLEARANCE OF THE<br />
QUEANBEYAN RIVER AND ITS BANKS, $ 8,000 FOR<br />
INVESTIGATION OF CONSTRUCTION OF AN ADDITIONAL<br />
WEIR, AND $ 10,000 FOR A TREE PLANTING PROGRAM.<br />
UNDER THE CHILDREN'S COMMISSION PROGRAM $ 9,926<br />
FOR THE HARRIS PARK PRE-SCHOOL AND $ 9,449 FOR THE<br />
SOUTH QUEANBEYAN PRE-SCHOOL FOR RECURRENT EXPENDITURE<br />

UNDER THEMIGRANT EDUCATION PROGRAMS $ 67,000 THIS<br />
FINANCIAL YEAR FOR MIGRANT CHILDREN EDUCATION.<br />
UNDER THE SCHOOLS COMMISSION PROGRAMS $ 22,870 THIS<br />
FINANCIAL YEAR AND IN ADDITION, $ 9,696 TO TEACHERS<br />
AND SCHOOLS IN YOUR CITY FOR EDUCATIONAL INNOVATIONS1<br />
UNDER AUSTRALIAN EDUCATION DEPARTMENT PROGRAMS FOR<br />
THE PERIOD 1.1.73 11.4.75 $ 53,620,<br />
UNDER THE HOSPITALS PROGRAM -, THE ACCELERATION OF<br />
WORK AT THE QUEANBEYAN DISTRICT HOSPITAL BECAUSE<br />
OF THE GRANT OF $ 8.83 MILLION TO NSW FOR THE CONSTRUCTION<br />
AND IMPROVEMENT OF HOSPITALS.<br />
UNDER THE HOME NURSING SUBSIDY SCHEME $ 19,512 FOR THE<br />
QUEANBEYAN DISTRICT HOSPITAL DURING 1973 TO 1975. </p>
<p>-6-<br />
FROM THE GRANTS COMMISSION $ 80,000.<br />
FOR FLOOD RELIEF ASSISTANCE AS PART OF<br />
THE GRANT TO THE N. S. W. GOVERNMENT QUEANBEYAN<br />
RECEIVED ASSISTANCE TO RELIEVE MAJOR FLOOD<br />
DAMAGE IN 1974.<br />
UNDER THE RURAL ARTERIAL ROADS PROGRAM<br />
TOGETHER WITH THE GOVERNMENT OF N. S. W,,<br />
$ 159,000 FOR THE QUEANBEYAN RIVER BRIDGE;<br />
$ 130,000 FOR THE APPROACHES TO THAT BRIDGE<br />
AND $ 5,000 FOR THE COMMENCEMENT OF WORK ON<br />
THE RAILWAY BRIDGE ON CANBERRA AVENUE.<br />
As WELL, $ 10,781 WAS PROVIDED TO YOUR CITY<br />
COUNCIL THIS FINANCIAL YEAR FOR RURAL LOCAL<br />
ROADS. FOR A NEW CANBERRA-QUEANBEYAN RAILWAY BRIDGE<br />

AND, </p>
<p>-7-<br />
UNDER THE DEPT OF TOURISM RECREATION'S AREA<br />
ASSISTANCE PROGRAM $ 80,000 FOR THE DEVELOPMENT<br />
OF TIPTOP PARK,<br />
BUT SUCH A LIST DOES NOT DO FULL JUSTICE TO THE<br />
EXTENSIVE RANGE OF MATTERS IN WHICH WE CO-OPERATE. FOR<br />
EXAMPLE, THERE IS CO-OPERATION BETWEEN US IN REGIONAL<br />
PLANNING, IN WATER SUPPLY, IN TRANSPORT TO AND THROUGH<br />
QUEANBEYAN TO CANBERRA, AND IN ASSISTANCE TO YOUR CITY<br />
BY THE NC; D. C. IN LOCAL. PLANNING. PERHAPS THE BEST<br />
EXAMPLE, HOWEVER, OF OUR PARTNERSHIP PROGRAM AND OF YOUR<br />
INVOLVEMENT IN POLICY-MAKING AND IMPLEMENTATION, IS YOUR<br />
PARTICIPATION IN 1973 IN THE REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT SYMPOSIUM,<br />
CONCEIVED BY BOB WHAN, AND SPONSORED BY MY GOVERNMENT,<br />
THAT SYMPOSIUM CONSIDERED THE PROBLEMS OF THE REGION AND<br />
PRODUCED MATERIAL WHICH OUR PLANNERS CAN USE IN THE<br />
CONSIDERATION OF PLANS FOR THE WHOLE SOUTH-EASTERN REGION. ' 4<br />
I SHOULD, HOWEVER, ADD A WARNING. ALL THESE PROGRAMS<br />
I HAVE MENTIONED ARE NOVEL FOR AUSTRALIA AND EXPERIMENTAL IN<br />
AUSTRALIA. BECAUSE THEY ARE NEW, BECAUSE THEY ARETENTATIVE,<br />
THEY LACK THE POLITICAL CLOUT THAT COMES FROM<br />
YEARS AND YEARS OF EXPERIENCE AND EXPERTISE. BECAUSE THEY<br />
SEEK OUT NEW AND NEGLECTED AREAS OF NEED, THEY MAY BE<br />
REGARDED AS POLITICALLY PERIPHERAL, THEY HAVE NOT HAD THE<br />
TIME TO BECOME SACRED COWS, BECAUSE THEY ARE DESIGNED TO<br />
SERVE THE NEEDS OF THE WEAKEST, OF THE LEAST ARTICULATE MEMBERS<br />
OF THE COMMUNITY, AND BECAUSE THEY INVOLVE COMMUNITIES AND<br />
INDIVIDUALS AT A LOCAL LEVEL, THEY MAY BE REGARDED AS<br />
POLITICALLY DISPENSABLE BY THE OPPOSITION AND BY STATE<br />
GOVERNMENTS. </p>
<p>MY GOVERNMENT'S VIEW THOUGH IS STILL AS I STATED IT IN<br />
MY POLICY SPEECH OF 1972:-<br />
" WE ARE DETERMINED THAT THE AUSTRALIAN PEOPLE<br />
SHALL BE RESTORED TO THEIR RIGHTFUL PLACE IN<br />
THEIR OWN COUNTRY AS PARTICIPANTS AND<br />
PARTNERS IN GOVERNMENT...". S<br />
8/. </p>
<p>-8-<br />
LET THERE BE NO MISTAKE ABOUT THIS POSSIBILITY.<br />
OUR OPPONENTS HAVE ALREADY GIVEN NOTICE OF THEIR<br />
INTENTIONS. THEY CRY " CENTRALISM", " SOCIALISM"<br />
AND " BUREAUCRAT ISAT ION" WHENEVER WE PRESS AHEAD WITH<br />
ANY OF OUR POLICY COMMITMENTS. THEY FEAR THAT<br />
UNFEELING PUBLIC SERVANTS IN CANBERRA AND PUBLIC<br />
SERVANTS IN CANBERRA, AS WE ALL KNOW, ARE ALWAYS<br />
UNFEELING WILL DESTROY COMMUNITY INITIATIVE. I<br />
MAINTAIN THE CONTRARY THAT OUR NATIONAL COMMUNITY<br />
PROGRAMS WILL REPLACE THE EXISTING STATE CENTRALISM<br />
WITH GENUINE REGIONAL INVOLVEMENT AND PARTICIPATION$<br />
As PROOF OF THEIR INTENTIONS, WE NEED LOOK<br />
NO FURTHER THAN THEIR ACTIONS. THEY OPPOSED OUR<br />
REFERENDUM BY WHICH LOCAL GOVERNMENT WOULD HAVE GAINED<br />
REPRESENTATION ON THE LOAN COUNCIL AND, TWO OF THE<br />
PROGRAMS I HAVE MENTIONED THE AUSTRALIAN ASSISTANCE<br />
PLAN AND THE REGIONAL EMPLOYMENT DEVELOPMENT SCHEMEARE<br />
BEING CHALLENGED BY SOME OF THE STATE GOVERNMENTS<br />
IN THE HIGH COURT$<br />
IF THAT CHALLENGE SHOULD SUCCEED, NO LESS<br />
THAN FIFTY-SEVEN NATIONAL WELFARE PROGRAMS, SOME OF<br />
THEM INITIATED BY THE PREVIOUS GOVERNMENT, COULD BE<br />
IMPERILLED. FOR EXAMPLE, PROGRAMS FOR THE AGED AND<br />
HOMELESS, THE HANDICAPPED, ABORIGINAL PEOPLE, ISOLATED<br />
CHILDREN, HEALTH CENTRES, LEGAL AID OFFICES, NURSING<br />
HOMES AND HOME NURSING, MEALS ON WHEELS, THE FLYING<br />
DOCTOR SERVICE, AND BLOOD TRANSFUSION. 84 1/ 9 </p>
<p>THE COMMON DISTINGUISHING FACTOR IN ALL THESE PROGRAMS<br />
IS THAT THEY ARE DESIGNED TO MEET SPECIAL NEEDS OF<br />
THE-WEAK AND INARTICULATE SECTIONS OF THE COMMUNITY.<br />
IF THESE GROUPS WERE POLITICALLY POWERFUL, IF THEY<br />
COULD MOUNT EFFECTIVE POLITICAL PRESSURE, THE<br />
GOVERNMENTS WHICH DARED TO PLACE THESE PROGRAMS IN<br />
JEOPARDY WOULD BE DESTROYED. BUT AS IT IS, THE THING<br />
PASSES OFF WITH SCARCE A MURMUR.<br />
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN: YOUR CITY, YOUR<br />
COMMUNITY ESPECIALLY THE NEEDY, WEAK AND INARTICULATE<br />
MEMBERS OF IT HAVE BEEN MUCH ASSISTED BY OUR JOINT<br />
EFFORTS, BY OUR PARTNERSHIP PROGRAM. WE MUST ENSURE<br />
THAT THERE IS NO GOING BACK, THAT COOPERATIVE<br />
INVOLVEMENT IN, AND ASSISTANCE TO, THE COMMUNITIES<br />
OF AUSTRALIA BY THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT BECOMES<br />
ESTABLISHED. IT IS THE RIGHT OF EACH COMMUNITY AND<br />
OF EACH INDIVIDUAL IN IT. WE SHOULD BE SATISFIED WITH<br />
NO LESS THAN THIS. </p>
