    <content><![CDATA[<p>E&amp;OE...............................................</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Are you trying to persuade Janette to take up the offer of a holiday</p>
<p> in Merimbula next year?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I will discuss it with her but you know there is that strong</p>
<p> Hawks Nest claim, but this is a terrific spot and I will certainly</p>
<p> put it on the table.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>The situation in the Gulf, we have Cabinet meeting tomorrow, how important</p>
<p> is it for Australia to get involved in a possible strike against that</p>
<p> country?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well the important thing is not to get involved, as such, the important</p>
<p> thing is to share with the United States, if that is our wish, the</p>
<p> responsibility for seeing that the retention of weapons of mass destruction</p>
<p> is not allowed. I mean, what's at stake here is not whether or</p>
<p> not one gets involved but whether people who want to store and potentially</p>
<p> use weapons of mass destruction should be allowed to get away with</p>
<p> it. And that's the issue that has to be considered, not only</p>
<p> by Australia, but by a large number of other countries.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Iraqi diplomats today, pointed out that such a strike has not been</p>
<p> sanctioned by the UN, is that another consideration for Cabinet tomorrow?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I don't share that interpretation. There's plenty of views</p>
<p> around suggesting that the resolutions, already passed by the United</p>
<p> Nations, constitute sufficient authority or action. However, I am</p>
<p> hopeful that this can be settled peacefully. If the Iraqi leadership</p>
<p> were to bend and to allow inspection of these sites then the use of</p>
<p> force would not be necessary. And after all, the Iraqi leadership</p>
<p> promised in 1991, that inspections of this kind would be allowed and</p>
<p> all the Iraqi Government has to do is to keep the commitment it made</p>
<p> in 1991.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Do you think there is a danger that we could be over-reacting, perhaps,</p>
<p> like we did last time?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, we didn't over-react last time, not at all. I don't</p>
<p> accept that we over-reacted last time at all. I thought, what was</p>
<p> done last time was correct, and it was proportionate and it was in</p>
<p> no way an over-reaction. The Iraqis were given all the warning in</p>
<p> the world to vacate Kuwait and the leadership refused to do so and</p>
<p> that inflicted a terrible cost on the Iraqi population. I don't</p>
<p> think we are over-reacting. You are dealing here with the foulest,</p>
<p> possible material which can cause devastation on millions of people</p>
<p> if it is unleashed. You are not dealing here with somebody who is</p>
<p> just being difficult, you are dealing here with somebody who doesn't</p>
<p> recognise the norms of the civilised world.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Australia is a long way from Iraq, do you think Australians appreciate</p>
<p> the threat that you obviously see?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I think Australians do not want to see a world in which people can</p>
<p> get away with manufacturing, storing and having the capacity to deliver</p>
<p> foul, chemical and biological warfare against neighbouring countries</p>
<p> which could, if unchecked, cause the deaths of hundreds of thousands,</p>
<p> if not millions, of people. That's something that I think you</p>
<p> have to understand no matter where you live. The world is a very small</p>
<p> place when it comes to the capacity to deliver, on anybody, that kind</p>
<p> of material.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>A woman I was sitting with here tonight, her son has just finished</p>
<p> a tour of duty in the navy and he is still eligible for recall, she</p>
<p> tells me that he is worried sick that tomorrow you might go with the</p>
<p> United States and what would happen to him?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I can't comment on individual cases, you appreciate that.</p>
<p> Governments have to take decisions based upon what they think is in</p>
<p> the national interest and we will take a decision and we will take</p>
<p> everything into account.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Do mothers have that to fear for their sons again?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>That is a very understandable thing and anybody in my position understands</p>
<p> that and it is something we take into account but the history of the</p>
<p> world, particularly in the 20th century, is such that if you don't</p>
<p> take account of the behaviour of people who get away with unreasonable</p>
<p> behaviour, if you imagine, by giving in to people who behave unreasonably,</p>
<p> you induce them to behave reasonably in the future, you are always</p>
<p> wrong.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Mr Zammit, today, launched a fairly personal attack on you, Mr Howard,</p>
<p> are you disappointed that he should show such a lack of loyalty?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I am disappointed that he has let his own electorate down because</p>
<p> there are fewer planes over Lowe and there is less noise over his</p>
<p> electorate now than when my Government was returned.</p>
