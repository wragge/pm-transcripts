PRIME-MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING, MP<br />
ON ARRIVAL AT SOUTH PACIFIC FORUM<br />
BRISBANE AIRPORT<br />
SUNDAY 31 JUILY, 1994<br />
J: Prime Minister, how do you think this forum will make a difference to the<br />
economic and environmental problems facing South Pacific nations?<br />
PM: Well, I hope it does. I think, this is probably, in some cases, in some<br />
places in the Pacific one of the last opportunities we'll have to do<br />
something about forestry. I think we might be able to, we'll certainly be<br />
able to talk about fisheries resources, about development of human<br />
capital and tourism things which are of material assistance to the<br />
community of the pacific. So, the South Pacific Forum has been a<br />
useful forum in the past for discuissing these issues. I hope,<br />
particularly with it In Australia on this, its 25th meeting, that we can do<br />
something useful again, for the welfare of the Pacific Island<br />
community.<br />
J: But there's been a lot of talk in the past and not much has resulted,<br />
how can you actually improve things this time?<br />
PM: Well, I wouldn't say that I don't agree with that. I think we've made<br />
progress on particular issues. The theme of this is managing<br />
resources. This is the theme which has been generally promoted by<br />
Australia and accepted by the leaders of the Forum countries. And, I<br />
think, under the theme of managing resources be it in fisheries,<br />
forestry, tourism, human development this, I think, is an apposite<br />
and appropriate theme for now.<br />
J: Why aren't you spending more time on Bougainville? Why has<br />
Bougainville got such a low profile?<br />
PM: Because it is a matter for Papua New Guinea. It Is not on the agenda<br />
any more than aboriginal reconciliation in Australia Is on the agenda.<br />
J: You've called for an urgent need for something to be done about the<br />
environment in the South Pacific. How do you think youre going to be able<br />
to convince the South Pacific that they should take some urgent action-now? </p>
<p>PM: I'e already had a number of bilateral discu ssions with leaders and<br />
prime ministers of some South Pacific countries about this subject<br />
And, Australia has a lot to offer, I think, in terms of assistance we might<br />
be able to advance in terms of management of resources and that will<br />
be one of the things we'll be, certainly, suggesting.<br />
J: Prime Minister, Pacific countries have criticised Australia for saying<br />
that the South Pacific has to pick up its socks, are you concerned<br />
about that kind of criticism?<br />
PM: Well, I've never heard any serious criticism about that I think that<br />
Australia has had to adjust itself in the last decade, of course it has,<br />
enormously. This is a totally different country than it was ten years<br />
ago. It is now an outward, competitive, confident place where before it<br />
wasn't So, the adj * ustment task is one which Australia has worn and<br />
Australians have worn and succeeded in. Arnd, it is a similar message,<br />
I think for countries who we are giving substantial support to.<br />
J: How willing are you to give them more aid, give them more of the<br />
means to combat the. environmental degradation?<br />
PM: Well, we already provide a lot of aid and I think it is a case of countries<br />
have got to, themselves, articulate a program to manage their<br />
resources on a sustainable basis.<br />
J: How do you justify to the Australian taxpayer that we spend some thirty<br />
per cent of our foreign aid budget just on the fifteen nations of the<br />
forum given that population-wise, they don't really amount to a very<br />
large number of people?<br />
PM: Well, they are part of our responsibility, I think, as a developed country<br />
in this part of the worid, in terms of aid and, particularly with Papua<br />
New Guinea, with the former trust arrangements which we had for most<br />
of this century. And, thats where that responsibility comes from and<br />
by and large we seek to administer it sensibly, creatively. Other<br />
developed countries, of course, have other priorities. Look at Africa,<br />
for instance. France, for instance, has a substantial foreign aid budget<br />
in the African region. We happen to live in the Asia-Pacific and it is in<br />
this area that most of our attention is turned.<br />
J: You are asking for a fair bit from these countries. Do you think that<br />
they do have the resources to come up with. the solutions without...?<br />
PM: Well, I don't think it is asking countries much than to keep an eye on<br />
the sustainablity of their own resources. I mean, to not make that point<br />
is to say, well, let resources get to the point where they are<br />
unsustainable and then where do they go then?<br />
ends. </p>
