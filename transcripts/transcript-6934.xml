FOR MEDIA 28 MAY 1986 9'<br />
Cabinet todiay considered the implications of the recent South<br />
African raids on Botswana, Zambia and Zimbabwe. The Federal<br />
Government condemns the South African actions in the strongest<br />
terms. It is impossible to justify such arrogant violation of<br />
the sovereignty and territorial integrity of South Africa's<br />
neighbouring states. The situation in southern Africa demands<br />
an end to apartheid and a suspension of violence on all sides.<br />
The attacks have severely bruised the initiative taken through<br />
the Commonwealth Eminent Persons Group to facilitate dialogue<br />
between black and white South Africans. it would be a tragedy<br />
if this widely commended attempt to negotiate a settlement<br />
were to founder because of South Africa's actions.<br />
The Australian Government is eagerly awaiting the Eminent<br />
Persons Group's further assessment of its position. The Group<br />
is to meet in London in early June. The Group is expecting a<br />
response from the South African Government by that time t.<br />
proposals which it has advanced.<br />
The Group is looking forward also to receiving views from the<br />
African National Congress.<br />
if as a result of South African intransigence the Eminent<br />
Persons Group were indeed shown to fail, Australia would hold<br />
the South African Government responsible.<br />
In that event the Australia n Government will move quickly to<br />
accelerate its consideration of further possible economic<br />
measures against South Africa.<br />
These would necessarily include the list of measures<br />
identified in the so-called second tranche of the Commonwealth<br />
Accord on Southern Africa agreed at Nassau in October 1985. </p>
