    <content><![CDATA[<p>Heads of Government from the 54-member association of Commonwealth nations will meet in Brisbane, Australia for their biennial summit from 6-9 October 2001.</p>
<p>The theme for the conference will be âThe Commonwealth in the 21st Century: Continuity and Renewalâ, reflecting the Commonwealthâs enduring strengths in supporting good governance, democracy and economic development. The leaders will receive a report from the High Level Review Group, mandated by the 1999 Durban Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM) to consider how best the Commonwealth could respond to the challenges of the 21st Century.</p>
<p>CHOGM 2001 will take place at the Brisbane Conference and Exhibition Centre. The traditional retreat for the Heads during the CHOGM will be on 7-8 October at the Hyatt Regency resort on the Sunshine Coast at Coolum, just north of Brisbane.</p>
<p>This will be the first time since the 1981 Melbourne CHOGM that the Australian government will host a CHOGM. It is particularly appropriate that CHOGM will be held in Australia during 2001 which marks the Centenary of Federation in Australia.</p>
<p>Australian Prime Minister John Howard said: âThe Australian government is looking forward to hosting CHOGM in Brisbane next October, in the year that we will be celebrating Australiaâs Centenary of Federation and reflecting on our nationâs future and our role in the region and the world. This first gathering of Commonwealth leaders in the new century will provide them the opportunity to reaffirm their commitment to the principles of freedom, democracy and mutual assistance.â</p>
<p>Commonwealth Secretary-General Don McKinnon said: âAll Commonwealth countries will look forward to the 2001 CHOGM in Brisbane. It is a worthy site for the Commonwealthâs first summit for the new century. The excellent facilities at both the conference centre and retreat site will be conducive to serious deliberations by Commonwealth leaders, in particular on the future of the Commonwealth.â</p>
