    <content><![CDATA[<p>Prime Minister Kevin Rudd today announced a $3 million assistance package to support the new Bali Democracy Forum (BDF) and the Institute for Peace and Democracy in Indonesia. </p>
<p>The Prime Minister made the announcement in Bali where he is co-chairing the BDF with the President of Indonesia, HE Dr Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono.</p>
<p>The BDF and the new Institute at the University of Udayana in Bali are aimed at fostering democracy in the Asia Pacific and are timely regional initiatives by President Yudhoyono.</p>
<p>Australia strongly congratulates President Yudhoyono for his vision and his regional leadership in convening the Bali Democracy Forum.</p>
<p>The Forum will be open to all countries from across the region and will meet regularly at a ministerial level. It will be supported by the new Institute which will organise workshops and research on democratic processes, such as electoral systems, the role of civil society and the media, the judiciary and the role of the military.</p>
<p>It is in Australia's own national interests to support an initiative aimed at strengthening democratic process and good governance in the Asia Pacific.</p>
<p>It is fitting that this initiative has been launched by President Yudhoyono, in Indonesia, which has undergone a remarkable transformation in recent years to become the world's third largest democracy.</p>
<p>Australia's assistance to the BDF will provide:</p>
<p>     * Support for a partnership between the Institute and Australia's Centre for Democratic Institutions at the Australian National University;</p>
<p>     * Start-up financing for the Institute;</p>
<p>     * A mixture of short- and long-term âdemocracy scholarshipsâ, established in partnership with the Institute which will bring students from the region to study in Australia.</p>
