F76/ 156<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR PRESS JULY 1976<br />
COOMBS REPORT RECEIVED<br />
Th report of the Royal C~ mmission on Australian Government<br />
Administration has been transmitted to His Excellency the<br />
Governor-General and received by the Go rernment. The report<br />
will be released as soon as a supply of printed copies is<br />
available. The Royal Commigs'ion, chaired by Dr H. C. Coombs, has made a<br />
comprehensive review of the working of the Commonwealth<br />
administration and has submitted a wide ranging set of<br />
recommendat ions.<br />
The Royal Commission, which was appointed in June 1974, was<br />
the first comprehensive inquiry into the Federal Public Service<br />
for more than fifty years. The Government will study carefully<br />
and give thorough consideration to over 300 recommendations<br />
made by the Royal Commission on the principles for more efficient<br />
administration. I pay tribute to the dedication of the five Commissioners<br />
Dr Coombs, Mr P. H. Bailey, Professor Enid Campbell,<br />
Mr Deputy President Isaac and Mr P. Munro to their task.<br />
The Government is grateful -for their contribution to such<br />
an important field of study. </p>
