    <content><![CDATA[<p>Australia's ability to tackle the public policy challenges of the future will be boosted by the Rudd Government's establishment of the Australian National Institute for Public Policy at the Australian National University (ANU).</p>
<p>Our development as a prosperous, dynamic and outward looking nation depends on strong, well informed, innovative and robust public policy debate.</p>
<p>The Commonwealth Government will invest up to $111.7 million in the Australian National Institute for Public Policy, which will have under one banner the public policy expertise available through ANU and the Australia and New Zealand School of Government (ANZSOG).</p>
<p>Modelled on the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University, the vibrant public policy precinct will combine a number of elements:</p>
<p>     * $14 million to bolster public policy expertise at ANU, through enhancing capacity in The Crawford School of Economics and Government and establishing the H. C. Coombs Policy Forum, which will inform future policy development;</p>
<p>     * $7 million in Sir Roland Wilson Foundation scholarships for public servants to study at ANU;</p>
<p>     * The recently announced $17.3 million National Security College;</p>
<p>     * A new $19.8 million building to jointly house the new National Security College and the enhanced presence of ANZSOG in the precinct, expected to open in 2012;</p>
<p>     * The recently announced $53.1 million Australian Centre on China in the World (including a building); and</p>
<p>     * $0.5m to scope the need and nature of additional accommodation for officials and students in Canberra for courses.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister also announced that the Government has accepted all of the recommendations in Ahead of the Game: Blueprint for Reform of Australian Government Administration.</p>
<p>The Blueprint outlines a comprehensive reform agenda to ensure the APS can meet today's challenges of unprecedented complexity and scale. Once enacted, the recommendations will strengthen strategic direction and citizen engagement across the APS; whilst equipping the staff and leaders of the APS to perform at their best.</p>
<p>The Government values its strategic relationship with the ANU, and has a strong commitment to public policy debate and a strong public service.</p>
