VISIT TO US, CANADA AND UK<br />
SYDNEY DEPARTURE<br />
PRESS CONFERENCE AT MASCOT AIRPORT, SYDNEY 28TH MAY, 1967<br />
PRIME MINISTER gentlemen, I thin k the range of matters we shall be<br />
discussing on this visit must rank amongst the most significant that any<br />
Australian Prime Minister has been called upon to undertake in the course<br />
of an overseas journey. As you know, I shall be seeing President Johnson,<br />
the Prime Minister of Canada, Mr. Pearson and the Prime Minister of<br />
Great Britain Mr. Harold Vlilson, in addition to other senior members of<br />
those three Administrations. The subject matters themselves will be<br />
tremendously important.<br />
In the United States, I shall be canvassing with President<br />
Johnson a number of matters of mutual interest to us. In the international<br />
field, Vietnam, of course, will loom largely in our discussions, as will the<br />
British intentions in relation to their military presence East of Suez. There<br />
will be discussions between us, I would hope, on other matters of mutual<br />
interest relating to Britain's entry into the European Economic Community,<br />
but apart from that, there will be talks about matters of interest of Australia<br />
in the trade and economic fields,<br />
In Canada, we have no problems as between Australia and<br />
Canada of any significance, but we do have important mutual interests.<br />
17, e are both senior members of the Commonwealth of Nations, and the<br />
Commonwealth is going through a period of difficult movement in which the<br />
future is not easy to perceive. Both of us, I think, would want to see a<br />
continuing role for the Commonwealth. Both of us have a consciousness that<br />
as our own two countries develop in population and in economic strength<br />
and they are both at this time countries of considerable economic sigrifcance<br />
and strength both of us have significant relations with the United States.<br />
I would want to talk with Mr. Pearson about the future role that our two<br />
countries can play in the kind of world which we see developing around us.<br />
I like to think sometimes of where Australia and Canada will be by the end<br />
of this century. I won't be here, of course, to do much about that, but<br />
our two countries, with a growing population there and a growing population<br />
here, able to make our policies and our influence felt amongst such countries<br />
as the United Kingdom and the United States, can, I think, usefully influence<br />
the course of events in various policies which will emerge internationally.<br />
So these are things that he and I will have an opportunity of canvassing<br />
together in the quite intimate discussions I shall be having with him during<br />
the weekend I shall be spending privately with him, and in my talks with him<br />
and other members of his Cabinet.<br />
Of course, the stimulus for my visit to Canada at this time is<br />
Australia's participation in EXPO-67, and I am looking forward to being there<br />
on the day specially set aside to celebrate Australia's participation in this<br />
important international exposition. But Mr. Pearson and I will have<br />
opportunities together for useful discussion on many matters of mutual<br />
interest. W~ hen I get to the United Kingdom, there will be matters there<br />
which are of critical importance for Australia, and amongst these, the most<br />
significant undoubtedly will be British intentions in relation to their military / 2 </p>
<p>-2<br />
role, not only East of Suez, but the global role which the United Kingdom<br />
sees itself pursuing in the years ahead.<br />
As to their entry into the European Common Market, the trade<br />
aspects of this can, of course, be dealt with more appropriately by my<br />
colleague the Minister for Trade, the Deputy Prime Minister, who is our<br />
specialist on these matters and who has returned recently from overseas and<br />
from his own discussions in Europe and in the United Kingdom. But events<br />
move swiftly ir, this era, and by the time I get there, no doubt there will be<br />
further clarification on British prospects and I shall be able to have direct<br />
talk with the Prime Minister who has set aside the whole of the Tuesday<br />
morning immediately after our arrival on the Monday night in London for his<br />
talks with me, and some later opportunities in that week. There will be<br />
other Ministers with whom I shall be in discussion on matters which also ane<br />
of significance for us the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Minister for<br />
Defence, the Minister for Commonwealth Relations, and the Minister for<br />
Trade. These are just highlights, as they occur to me, of the discussions<br />
I shall be holding. In America, as you will see from the detailed itinerary that has<br />
been circulated to you, I have a number of important speaking engagements<br />
which I am hoping will prove helpful to American and Australian interests<br />
internationally. In the United Kingdom, .1 haven't public speaking commitments<br />
as yet, but there will be there the close and intimate discussions with the<br />
Prime Minister and senior members of his Ckabinet.<br />
Altogether I am hoping that this will prove a visit to each country<br />
of great value for Australia. Certainly it will be informative for me and my<br />
colleagues and I hope that I shall be able to conv~ ey Australian views in a way<br />
which will have some impact on the policies which each of these countries will<br />
be pursuing in the future.<br />
C. On the Referendum, Mr. Holt, could we have your reactions?<br />
PM: Well, first as to the aborigine people, I think we can all as a<br />
nation take satisfaction in the overwhelming support given to the proposal to<br />
remove any trace of discrimination, as it has appeared to many people, in the<br />
Australian Constitution. It will not only be of benefit as I see it to pecple<br />
of the aboriginal race in that it will enable the national government to<br />
co-operate more closely with the Governments of the States in ensuring just<br />
treatment and full acceptance in the Australian community of the aboriginal<br />
people, but I think it will help Australia's image abroad in that so many<br />
Australians have shown their determircation to give full acceptance to people<br />
of the aboriginal race in the Australian community.<br />
As to the nexus proposal, here as I said before the result, a<br />
victory for NO would, in my judgment be a victory for prejudice, for<br />
misrepresentation of what was involved in this, and an expression on the<br />
part of many people of fears not very clearly felt or understood, but leading<br />
them to a judgment that when in doubt they would vote N 0. / 3 </p>
<p>-3<br />
I don't know what it is about New S1outh Wales that has given them<br />
the special merit of giving the Government such good support, but my own<br />
interpretation of it is that in this State there was, both at the political level<br />
and amongst the press, a more temperate and responsible presentation of the<br />
case for the breaking of the nexus and this was re flected in the vote. In some<br />
of the smaller StatE, under standably, there was a fear that their own relative<br />
importance in the national Parliament might be diminished in an enlarged<br />
P arliament or with a Senate held where it is now. But I pointed out at the time,<br />
and others supported me-in this, that representatives from those small States<br />
in the House of Representatives unanimously for the proposal and in the Senate<br />
there was an overwhelming majority, including a maujority of Members from<br />
the smaller States who voted in support of it.<br />
It was, I concede, a disappointing result in that we did not secure<br />
our objective, but that has been the decision of the Australian people. I feel<br />
that as time went on and there became a clearer understanding, support<br />
developed, but we were not able to get the majority we needed.<br />
However, we shall now have to proceed in the knowledge that this<br />
is the judgment which has been expressed on the national scale. I have no doubt<br />
in my own mind that there must be a redistribution in the life of this Parliament.<br />
There are electorates, even in the same city, where one Member has to<br />
represent more than two and a half times the number of electors of a n. other.<br />
I, myself, would not wish to go through another general election without a more<br />
equitable and balanced representation Inside each of the States of the ' Commonwealth.<br />
However, the details of these matters have yet to be discussed between<br />
myself and my colleagues. W~ ork will be done on the implications of this<br />
outcome before I return, and I hope -after my return to be able to talk closely<br />
with them about it.<br />
Tha-nk' you. </p>
