FOR PRESS PM. No. 27/ 1972<br />
VISIT OF PRESIDENT NIXON TO CHINA<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister, the Rt Hon.<br />
William McMahon, CH, MP<br />
When President Nixon last July announced his intention<br />
of visiting China, I wi-. comed it without reservation and wished him<br />
good fortune in an initiative which had the full support of Australia.<br />
Now that the visit is successfully concluded and a<br />
joint communique has been released, we can take stock of what was<br />
accomplished and just as importantly what still remains to be<br />
achieved.. The first point I make is that the fact of the visit<br />
itself -quite apart from what was discussed and agreed during it<br />
was a gain for all of us. For the isit unprecedented in itself<br />
and in its bold disregard of established practice marked in a<br />
dramatic fashion the importance each side attaches to having both<br />
a clearer idea of the other's preoccupations and a more normal<br />
relationship. Secondly, it is clear from the co-mmunique itself that<br />
this first high-level contact has not resulted in any fundamental<br />
reversals of foreign policies by either side.<br />
Indeed, that was not to be expected for, as the<br />
communique notes, " there are essential differenccs between China<br />
and the United States in their social systems and foreign policies"<br />
Thus on issues such as Indo-China and Korea, the two sides were<br />
apparently able to do no more than to restate, and no doubt to<br />
elaborate, their established positions.<br />
It is worthwhile noting that both sides by their<br />
attitudes during the talks made it clear that neither is about to<br />
abandon old friends.<br />
The two sides were able to agree on some general<br />
principles of conduct which should govern relations between states<br />
and which the two sides wqere themselves prepared to apply to their<br />
mutual relations. These princi les, though couchel in the language of the<br />
Bandung Declaration, arfequally the principles of the United </p>
<p>-2<br />
Nations Charter, to which China now subscribes; and they are<br />
principles which have long underlain in practice Australia's own<br />
foreign policy. With these principles of international relations in<br />
mind, the two sides went on to state a number of agreed points.<br />
* I draw Particular attention to three of these:<br />
" Neither should seek hegemony in the Asia Pacific region<br />
and each is opposed to the effort by any other country<br />
or group of countries to establish such hegemony."'<br />
" Both wish to reduce the danger of international military<br />
conflict."<br />
" Progress towards the normalisation of relations between<br />
China and the United States is in the interests of all<br />
countries." The first two of these points augur well for the peace<br />
Of the region of which Australia is part. But it would be wrong to<br />
suppose that their mere assertion, even coupled with the reiteration<br />
of the Bandung Principles, is all that is required.<br />
For as the US side stated in the talks, " Peace in Asia<br />
and peace in the world require efforts"~ and I emphasise " efforts",<br />
which are more than words " to reduce immediate tensions and to<br />
eliminate the basic causes of conflict."<br />
The reduction of tensions is thus not enough in itself;<br />
what is also needed is the elimination of basic causes of conflict.<br />
In this respect, it would be foolish to ignore that the Chinese<br />
side reiterated its support for what it describes as " the struggles<br />
of all the oppressed people and nations for freedom and liberation".<br />
How do these words square with the Bandung Principles?<br />
What do they mean in practice, and how will they be understood by<br />
our friends and neighbours in Asia who are ' Laced with subversive<br />
threats to their independence?<br />
As to the third of the points to which I have drawn<br />
attention Progress toward the normalisation of Sino/ American<br />
relations the Australian Government sees great advantages in that<br />
process, and notes with satisfaction that a beginning is to be<br />
made with " people to people contacts the development of bilateral<br />
trade, and the maintenance of official contacts through various<br />
channels. As long ago as May 13,1971, I said " That we want normal<br />
bilateral relations with the People's Republic of China."<br />
So the US approach is in fact entirely in line with<br />
what we ourselves have been trying to do, in accordance with our<br />
long-standing objective announced well before President Nixon's<br />
statement last July ofL the progressive normalisation of relations<br />
with China. es/ 3 </p>
<p>3<br />
Unfortunately, we have not been able to make much progress<br />
towards that objective. The prime reason has been the difficult<br />
question of the Republic of China with its government on Taiwan.<br />
As with President Nixon, so with us the Chinese side has<br />
taken the position that this is the crucial question obstructing the<br />
normalisation of relations.<br />
Recognising the difficulty of resolving that question, we<br />
had wished to move first in other areas of our bilateral relations,<br />
such as trade and scientific and cultural relations.<br />
I note that in respect of the United States, the PRC is<br />
prepared not to make Taiwan the stumbling-block in the way of<br />
normalising relations.<br />
It may be that Peking will now be prepared to do the same<br />
in our case; we shall certainly test out the Chinese on this.<br />
But it equally may be that the PRC has one policy in respectof<br />
the USA, which is a super power, and another in respect of middle<br />
powers such as Australia even though in the joint communique the<br />
Chinese side stated that " All nations, big or small, should be<br />
equal." We shall hope that the PRC will live up to its own words and<br />
will follow a consistent policy, but not being surprised if in<br />
the event the PRC has one policy for the big and another for the<br />
not so big. Finally, I make again the point that I made last July:<br />
President Nixon's initiative in visiting Peking is a beginning,<br />
an exploration, not a settlement of matters at issue even between<br />
these two powers, let alone of wider issues.<br />
But there is no doubt in the mind of the Australian<br />
Government that the visit has turned out, as we expected, to be<br />
a good beginning, one which opens up new prospects not only for the<br />
two participants but ultimately for a just and secure peace in<br />
Asia and beyond.<br />
