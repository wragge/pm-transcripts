PRIME MINISTER 18/ 92<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING, MP<br />
ECOLOGICALLY SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT REPORTS ON GREENHOUSE<br />
AND INTERSECTORAL ISSUES<br />
The Ecologically Sustainable Development ( ESD) reports on<br />
Greenhouse and intersectoral Issues were tabled in<br />
Parliament and released publicly today. This follows, and<br />
complements, the release of the ESD Working Groups' sectoral<br />
reports on 2 December 1991.<br />
The Greenhouse Report was commissioned in November 1990<br />
following the Government's decision to adopt an interim<br />
planning target to limit greenhouse gas emissions.<br />
At the time, the Government observed the need for additional<br />
work to assess the costs and benefits of possible greenhouse<br />
response measures, in line with its undertaking not to take<br />
actions that would have net adverse impacts on the economy<br />
or on Australia's trade competitiveness, in the absence of<br />
similar action by major greenhouse gas producing countries.<br />
The ESD Greenhouse Report draws together the work of the<br />
nine ESD Working Groups in identifying options for reducing<br />
greenhouse gas emissions and provides the Chairs' advice on<br />
a range of cost effective options which could be implemented<br />
by governments in seeking to achieve the interim planning<br />
target. The Intersectoral Issues Report was prepared separately by<br />
the ESD Chairs, drawing on the expert input from ESD Working<br />
Group and wo: ckshop participants, consultants and other<br />
interest groups. It highlights the importance of an<br />
integrated, system-wide approach to the successful<br />
implementation of ESD policies. Many of the issues dealt<br />
with are inherently complex but nevertheless fundamental to<br />
consideration of ESD policies. </p>
<p>The presentation of these two reports marks a milestone in<br />
the ESD process the completion of the Working Group phase.<br />
The challenge now for governments, and the wider community,<br />
is to examine and build on these reports in developing new<br />
policies and processes which will move us towards<br />
ecologically sustainable development.<br />
The Government intends to develop effective mechanisms for<br />
ongoing community consultation as a key element of its<br />
response to the ESD process. These mechanisms will include<br />
further roundtable meetings to discuss implementation of ESI)<br />
policies. The Government considers that, as with the ESD Working Group<br />
reports, the two reports released today will contribute<br />
significantly to the initial national strategies for<br />
Ecologically Sustainable Development and Greenhouse response<br />
which are in the process of being developed.<br />
I thank the Chairs, Dr Roy Green, Professor Stuart Harris<br />
and Professo David Throsby, for their efforts throughout<br />
the ESD process and for these reports. I also wish to thank<br />
the many individuals and organisations who devoted their<br />
time and expertise to the ESD process at every stage.<br />
