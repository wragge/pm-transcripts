18 March 1997 TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
THE HON JOHN HOWARD MP<br />
INTERVIEW WITH KERRY O'BRIEN THE 7.30 REPORT<br />
E O E<br />
O'BRIEN: John Howard, what's your best advice on whether Sir Julius Chan is now back firmly<br />
in control in Papua New Guinea?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well the best I can really say is not terribly different from your own news reports and<br />
what Sean Dorney has just said. Clearly there's a new commander of the defence<br />
forces. We, of course, totally support the authority of the civilian government over the<br />
military. And the fact that Papua New Guinea has remained a constitutional<br />
democracy for the last 22 years is something that we warmly applaud and support.<br />
And to the extent that our view is relevant in the matter, we're completely on the side<br />
of Sir Julius Chan as the duly elected Prime Minister of the country in asserting his<br />
civilian authority over the military. The attitude we have to the Sandline operation in<br />
so far as it impacts on the bilateral association between our two countries is of course<br />
a completely separate matter. I think it's fair to say that as Sean did in his report<br />
that the particular exercise which was limited to a demonstration of attitude in relation<br />
to Sandline that's over. Obviously the internal situation remains difficult and we'll<br />
follow developments very closely.<br />
O'BRIEN: This has been an ominous new development though, hasn't it in Papua New Guinea's<br />
history since independence? There was a point yesterday where it really did sound like<br />
a coup in the making. You must have had some uncomfortable moments and I wonder<br />
what you can say about the actions that you must have canvassed? </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, not a lot and I think you'll understand it wouldn't be appropriate for me to do<br />
so. I neither want to dramatise the situation with easily colourful language or, on the<br />
other hand, play it down. It was and remains serious. Papua New Guinea is very close<br />
to us. We are seen by the rest of the world as having a special association with that<br />
country. It's not an easy relationship. We are the former metropolitan power Papua<br />
New Guinea the former colony. We try to understand that. I respect the sovereignty<br />
of Papua New Guinea, but that doesn't relieve us of the responsibility to state our view<br />
if we think something is happening with which we don't agree. I want a stable,<br />
democratic Papua New Guinea. I want the duly elected civilian government of that<br />
country to remain in complete control and that is why I made it very clear today that<br />
we completely supported the right of the Prime Minister to dismiss the Commander of<br />
the defence forces and the unconstitutionality of what the Commander of the defence<br />
forces had done.<br />
O'BRIEN: Have you spoken to Sir Julius Chan since the revolt yesterday?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
No haven't. I haven't thought that appropriate. Our views were immediately<br />
conveyed through a spokesman and my High Commissioner or our High<br />
Commissioner in Port Moresby has been in close contact with the government. 1, of<br />
course, had a four to five hour meeting with Sir Julius in Sydney last Sunday week<br />
where we canvassed the whole gamut of the bilateral relationship. Naturally that<br />
conversation didn't contemplate any of the events of the past 48 hours. But it certainly<br />
canvassed our position on the mercenaries...<br />
O'BRIEN: And, in fact, you did tell Sir Julius face to face that there would be consequences in<br />
terms of our relationship with Papua New Guinea if he did go ahead with his plans to<br />
use mercenaries in Bougainville. That seems to have had no impact on him given what<br />
he said tonight?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, if you take his words at face value, yes that is true, it does not appear to have<br />
had any impact. I do want to make it clear as I did then, as I did in the Parliament this<br />
afternoon, that there will be consequences. Once again this is not a situation for<br />
overblown needlessly bellicose rhetoric but there should be no misunderstanding on<br />
anyone's part. But if those mercenaries are used in Bougainville there will be quite<br />
significant consequences.<br />
O'BRIEN: What will those consequences be? </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I don't at this stage want to canvass those. I have put them very plainly and<br />
unambiguously to Sir Julius.<br />
O'BRIEN: I assume it must disappoint you that he doesn't regard them as being more important<br />
than his desire to use mercenaries.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well I don't want the mercenaries used. I think the introduction of mercenaries into<br />
PNG has led to some of the instability of the past few days. It's a wholly sordid,<br />
unwelcome development in our part of the world. I sympathise with Sir Julius in his<br />
Bougainville problem. We don't believe it can be solved by military action. We think<br />
it will be aggravated by the use of mercenaries. We have put forward some suitable<br />
alternatives to the use of those mercenaries. That offer remains on the table. I don't<br />
for reasons I ask you to understand want to go into the detail of what those reasonable<br />
alternatives are but our position is very clear and nothing in the last 48 hours has<br />
changed it. If those mercenaries are used then there will be consequences and they will<br />
be quite significant.<br />
O'BRIEN: In his press conference last night Sir Julius linked General Singirok's actions to<br />
Australia's protests over the mercenaries. What's your reaction to that?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I don't accept that analysis. I think the better view is that the instability of the past 48<br />
hours is a product of the introduction of the mercenaries into that country.<br />
O'BRIEN: Very briefly, a couple of questions on the negotiations over native title and the Wik<br />
judgement, are you still confident that you can announce your solution by Easter as<br />
you had intended?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well I said about Easter. I am not going to be tied to a particular day. I said around<br />
Easter. The discussions are still going on. Kerry, it's a hard ask to get an agreed<br />
outcome on this. I am trying very hard. The atmosphere of the talks has been better<br />
than I expected but we still have a long way to go. </p>
<p>O'BRIEN: And very, very quickly, have you ruled out legislating to extinguish native title over<br />
pastoral leases?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
No I haven't ruled that out, no. The only two things I have ruled out are overturning<br />
the whole concept of native title, in other words rejecting the Mabo finding that under<br />
the common law such a thing as native title exists and the other thing I have ruled out<br />
is doing nothing because that's..<br />
O'BRIEN: Somewhere in between.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well somewhere in between, well, somewhere in between yes but I haven't ruled out<br />
extinguishment. I know the sensitivity of many in the community towards that and I<br />
certainly haven't ruled out amendments to existing legislation but I am trying very<br />
genuinely and very hard to achieve an agreed outcome that delivers justice to all of the<br />
parties and also security of tenure to Australia's pastoralists but also to others and<br />
respects the feeling of achievement that the Aboriginal people found when native title<br />
was said to exist by the High Court in the Mabo decision. Now if there is an instinct<br />
for goodwill amongst all of the parties it ought with a lot of effort be possible to get an<br />
agreed outcome. If there can't be an agreed outcome then I have a very clear view in<br />
my own mind now as to what course of action I will be recommending to my Cabinet<br />
colleagues and that will come, if it's not immediately after Easter it won't be too far<br />
after that.<br />
O'BRIEN: John Howard thanks for talking to us.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
It's a pleasure.<br />
