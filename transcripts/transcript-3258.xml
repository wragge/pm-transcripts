CHRISTMAS ISLAND<br />
The Prime Minister, Mr Whitlam said tonight:<br />
" Christmas Island was, in the past, administered by Britain<br />
for convenience as part of the Colony of Singapore. In 1958 it<br />
was transferred to Australian sovereignty by Britain.<br />
" Australian sovereignty over the island is not in question.<br />
Nor are we handing over control of the rock phosphate deposits.<br />
" When I was in Singapore in February the question of<br />
Christmas Island was mentioned to me by Lee Kuan Yew. There was no<br />
discussion in any detail. No agreement in principle about the future<br />
of the island has been reached and there has certainly been no secret<br />
" deal". as has been alleged.<br />
" Any change in the future status of Christmas Island would<br />
involve the interests of a number of departments and instrumentalities<br />
in Australia and a number of countries such as New Zealand and<br />
Indonesia ( which is closer to Christmas Island than is Singapore).<br />
No negotiations on this subject have taken place.<br />
" Those who are making the most noise about what they-allege<br />
to be a sell out of Australia's interests are those who have been<br />
most active in selling up Australia's resources over the last decade.<br />
" If their allegations were true, their concern would be<br />
grossly hypocritical. As their allegations are untrue, they can<br />
only be seen as a malicious fabrication propagated by desparate men facing<br />
electoral defeat."<br />
CANBERRA. </p>
