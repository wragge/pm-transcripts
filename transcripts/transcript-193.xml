PRESS CONFEREZNCE GIVEN BY TiHE PRIME MINISTER,<br />
THE RT. HON. R. G. MENZIES AT KINGSFORD SMITH<br />
AIRPORT, SYDNEY ON MONDAY 20TH JUN, 196o, 9 AM<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No doubt you urant to ask me some questions but<br />
perhaps before you do that I might just say something<br />
quite briefly about the principal objects of my visit.<br />
The Prime Ministers' Conference, as you probably<br />
know, Endbd up much more successfully than some of us<br />
had expected. It had all the makings of difficulty.<br />
There had been a number of statements made about the<br />
South African facial policies. Then the Prime Minister<br />
of South Africa couldn't come for reasons that we know<br />
of. He was represented by his deputy, Mr. Louw, who I<br />
thought was in a difficult position for that reason. ! bL<br />
adopted our old rule that we don't engage in official<br />
discussions on internal policies, or, for that matter,<br />
on disputes bet\.; een Commonwealth countries. We had, as<br />
you will remember, refused to discuss in open Conference<br />
the argument about Kashmir and so that rule uas re-affirmed.<br />
But we then did have some r'ivate discussions,<br />
with his approval, with Mr. Louw. And in the end result,<br />
as you know, the communique which I hope will be<br />
the last communique I'll say something about that in<br />
a moment contains something on that problem which was<br />
acceptable all round, and w~ hich I think it u~ ill be admitted<br />
wasn't frightfully controversial. But the essence<br />
of that matte. that discussion, was not what its<br />
result was, but the temper in which it was conducted. I<br />
thought it was the best evidence of the liveliness and<br />
reality of the Commonwealth that such an explosive matter<br />
could have lent itself to discussion of a completely<br />
good-tempered, reasonable kind. That was to me a<br />
wonderful thing. In the private discussions tha I took<br />
part in Dr. Nkrumah the Prime Minister of Ghana, the<br />
President Ayub of Pakistan, the Tunku Abdul Rahman of<br />
Malaya, all of whom have very power: ful views on this<br />
matter and-had expressed. them were, I thought, completely<br />
reasonable. They didn't put their criticisms<br />
in such a form as to render the position of the European<br />
people in South Africa intolerable. On the contrary<br />
they, I thought, recognised very well the problem of a<br />
minority of European people, people of European descent,<br />
who after all had largely made the economy of South<br />
Africa and had been responsible for its development.<br />
They recognised that. They made various suggestions<br />
I won't endeavour to rehearse them here but Mr. Louw<br />
undertook to report them to his Prime Minister, but I,<br />
naturally, on my travels, have not heard anythingC<br />
directly since.<br />
I think on the u; hole a lot of good came out of the<br />
discussions. The ground was cleared a good deal. I<br />
think that these responsible leaders of one African and<br />
two Asian countries were much more roasoned* in their approach<br />
than some of the more extravagant statements that<br />
I heard and read on this matter outside the conference.<br />
I said just then thlat I hoped it would be the last<br />
communique. As the oldest inhabitant of these Prime<br />
Ministers' Conferences I'm famnous for always objecting<br />
to having a communique; not because I object to communicating,<br />
but because in my experience these communiques<br />
are always such platitudinous documents. If<br />
anybody disagrees it doesn't go in and therefore you get<br />
what is universally agreed on, such as that we are all<br />
in favour of peace or that-t-e are all resolutely opposed<br />
to sin, or whatever it may be. And although these<br />
things come to the journalistic ear with all the charm<br />
of novelty, I think they get a little uninteresting and </p>
<p>I've been saying, " V,{ hy have one, it doesn't matter". I<br />
think I'm getting a few converts on that matter for this<br />
reason and this is a very interesting aspect of the<br />
Commonwealth. Today we have That I'll call the old Crown Commonwealth.<br />
countries Great Britain, Canada, Australia,<br />
New Zealand, South Africa and we have the new ones<br />
India, Pakistan, Ceylon, Ghana and Malaya and at any<br />
tick of the clock, now, Nigeria and, subject to wind<br />
and weather, the ., lost Indies. It is estimated that<br />
there must be three or four more African countries, once<br />
colonial, or now colonial, which are going to, on achiev<br />
-ing their independence, apply for membership of the<br />
Commonwealth. There might be 16 within two or three<br />
years, within five years conceivably 20 Commonwealth<br />
countries if every colony that becomes independent and<br />
self-governing chooses to remain in the Commonwealth or<br />
desires to remain in the Commonwealth. It is a. very<br />
interesting thing that almost without exception they<br />
do. There are great Allelulias, very properly, about<br />
getting Independence, perhaps achieving the status of a<br />
republic, but almost invariably they say, " 3ut we want<br />
to remain in the Commonwealth". And I think myself that<br />
that is largely b
they can have all this kind of frank exchange of opinion<br />
in an intimate way without all the gallery play that is<br />
involved in motions and amendments c. nd lobbying and<br />
votes.<br />
QUESTION-Sir, did you get that impression with South Africa,<br />
that they wish to remain in the Commonwealth?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Undoubtedly, yes, undoubtedly. And if we are going<br />
to have more and more new members of the Commonm. ralth,<br />
then I think that we are in grave danger of getting to<br />
a point where somebody will say: " I want to have a<br />
vote", you know, " The numbers are building up;-how can<br />
we determine what anybody thinks uhless we have a vote".<br />
And the day we have a vote we might as well wind up in<br />
my opinion, because we will then be indistinguishable<br />
from a major committee of the United Nations. If we<br />
are going to retain the character of the Commonwealth<br />
then no votes: we meet to meet, to talk, to exchange<br />
our ideas, to be perfectly frank with each other, to be<br />
rude to each other if you like in person so much more<br />
decent than being rude in writing. That makes a special<br />
association and these people understand it. But we are<br />
having an official examination made of what rules, if<br />
any, ought to be applied to future admissions, because,<br />
quite obviously, you may have a present colony with<br />
million people in it achieving independence, you may<br />
have another with half o million people or 300,000 and<br />
the question, " Should everybody just come in automaticaly?"<br />
1, well that's being looked at. But I believe, myself,<br />
that it is go!. ng to be very difficult to discriminate<br />
between countries now within the Empire and in<br />
future to be within the Commonwealth. It's very difficult<br />
to discriminate and to say, " Well, you are in the<br />
1st Eleven and you are in the 2nd". And to my mind, if<br />
we are to preserve the character of it, we ought not to<br />
have these communiques so that people have to argue and<br />
argue and argue as to whether something should be said<br />
in a published document about a particular matter. What<br />
needs to happen is that we should say, ' Itell, we meet<br />
we discuss, we don't issue a communique". We make i<br />
quite plain that we're here to exchange our views and we<br />
can agree or disagree. " de will indicate from time to<br />
time what the subject under discussion was and if any<br />
Prime Minister , ishes to explain to his own country what </p>
<p>his views are on a particular matter, well, so far as I<br />
know nothing has ever prevented him from doing so in the<br />
past and that will continue. I think that by increasing<br />
the informality of this matter we may get over the problem<br />
of numbers.<br />
Of course, there is another aspect that we considered,<br />
that we will have to think about a good deal in<br />
Australia, and that is the problem of Africa as a whole.<br />
We have got all taken up with South Africa but Africa<br />
as a , hole with over 200 million people is made up of a<br />
series of communities who are literally galloping towards<br />
Independence. This is not just a nice stately<br />
process they are galloping towards independence. Th<br />
United Nations expects to have about 10 or 12 I think,<br />
new African communities asking for membership of the<br />
United Nations inside the next 12 months.<br />
QUESTION: Do you think it likely that anyareas now under non-<br />
British administration may seek admittance to tho Comm nnwealth<br />
when they gain Independence?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Well, I don't at the moment, no. No, I don't. But<br />
one can't tell, but I would think npt. Certainly they<br />
are going to seek admittance to the United Nations and<br />
that gives rise to two matters that we in Australia will<br />
have to do some thinking about.<br />
Thofirst of them is that these communities will for<br />
the most part not be economically independent. This is<br />
one of the current problems of the world: how to reconcile<br />
political independence with unquestioned economic<br />
dependence on other people. People attach such importance<br />
to political independence that they are a bit inclined<br />
to overlook the other aspect of the matter and<br />
therefore most of these countries, most probably all of<br />
these countries, will be in a state of considerable confusion<br />
unless they get economic aid from somewhere. The<br />
Soviet Union will be very happy to extend it on terms.<br />
I discovered in the United States in discussions there,<br />
that there is an increasing awareness in the United<br />
States of this African problem, taking Africa as a<br />
whole. Jhether that involves some new plan on the lines<br />
of the Colombo Plan or some extension of what we call<br />
the Colombo Plan is a matter that we have all agreed to<br />
study. Nobody has committed himself to anything; but<br />
we've all realised that there is every possibility of<br />
the most tremendous duplicated and re-duplicated political<br />
turmoil in the Continent of Africa, unless these<br />
emerging countries can achieve some kind of economic<br />
stability, or at any rate go along some portion of the<br />
road towards it.<br />
QUESTION: Mr. Monzics could you tell us about SEATO; whether you<br />
think SEATO sarcatrain Communism in Asia?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Yes, but before I got to that I was just wondering<br />
whether I had missed some aspect.<br />
PRESSMAN: You started off, Sir, by saying there wore two<br />
points, but you have only mentioned the first<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Oh, the second. I really intended that my first<br />
point should have beon this, that whereas at one time<br />
many of us might have thought that it was better to go<br />
slowly in granting independence so that all the conditions<br />
existed for a wise exercise of self-government, I<br />
think the prevailing school of thcught today is that if<br />
in doubt you should go sooner, not later, I belong to<br />
that school of thought myself now, though I didn't once. </p>
<p>But I have seen enough in recent years to satisfy me<br />
that even though some Independences may have been premature,<br />
where they have been a little premature, they have<br />
at least been achieved with goodwill. And wihen people<br />
have to wait too long for independence, then they achiee<br />
it with ill-will, and that perhaps is the difference<br />
between the British colonial policy of this century and<br />
that of some other countries.<br />
QUESTION: PRIME MINISTER<br />
QUESTION: PRIME MINISTER: Would you apply that view to New Guinea, Sir<br />
I would apply that to any country.<br />
Continuing with Now Guinea, Sir, did you discuss<br />
anything about the New Guinea area with the Dutch?<br />
No, no I didn't go there. Mr. Hasluck went to the<br />
Hague. ' dhon you say " apply that to New Guinca" 5 yes,<br />
but that doesn't mean I belong to this fancy school of<br />
thought that you write a timetable out and say, " In<br />
years' time so and so, and in 20 years' time so and so".<br />
That's just silly. But we are doing a faithful job of<br />
work in New Guinea and Papua. Wo will go on doing it.<br />
We will get to the point where the standard of living of<br />
the indigenous inhabitants has risen, as we think, pretty<br />
well, We may got to a point, or my successors may get<br />
to a point, where they say, " Well, maybe if we allow<br />
them to determine their future now, it is a little<br />
premature". I would sooner take that risk at that time<br />
than leave it too long so that the demand for self-determination<br />
became explosive and produced hostility.<br />
It's the contrast between Indonesia , nd Malaya. You<br />
can't got a better example of the two things,<br />
The SEATO Conference was very interesting. I had<br />
never attended one before. I was impressed by it. I<br />
was rather sceptical when I went there about some aspects<br />
of the matter. I was rather pleased with it. I<br />
thought that the countries reprusented took it seriously;<br />
the speeches that were made both in the General Sessions<br />
and in the confidential sessions were very . ood, very<br />
direct, intelligent, reasonable. I think that there is<br />
no doubt about it that SEATO has had the effect of inducing<br />
for the first timu some sense of com. naunty, of<br />
common danger and of the need for common associ. tion, in<br />
the SEATO countries. But I thought, and I said when I<br />
was there, that one of the great dangors was that we<br />
should regard the South East Asian freaty Organisation<br />
as a place on the map just as we talk _ bout South iast<br />
Asia, as if it were a ogographical expression. Whereas<br />
if it is to meon anything it has to be a community of<br />
N. tions with a sense of community, and they won't develop<br />
a sense of community while they continue to have niggling<br />
little disputes, one with the other, Cambodia and<br />
Thailand h-, ve a dispute about a Temple. '. 1ll~ with<br />
very great respect to the Temple, this dispute doesn't<br />
seem to justify bedovilling the whole of the relations<br />
between the one country and another, both of whom stand<br />
equally at risk. And there are other disputes about a<br />
few islands and this and that and I urged that every<br />
step should be taken to get rid of those li ttle internecine<br />
arguments, because the Communists, the Chinese<br />
Communists principally in this case, would of course do<br />
their best to exaccrbace those problems, create ill-will<br />
and thusinternally to destroy the value of SEATO. That<br />
point was well understood. I am very impressed by the<br />
serious approach that all these representatives took of<br />
the matter. . io had the military planners there, As is<br />
well known nobody has some concrete commitment of a military<br />
kind, but the military planning has been seriously </p>
<p>attended to! We have just sent over to be the Chief<br />
Military planner, Major General . ilton who, as you know,<br />
is one of the most brilliant of our younger Generals in<br />
Australia.<br />
QUESTION: Sir, you told us before you left Canberra you were<br />
going to form some opinions in your mind in London on<br />
the problem generally of South Africa. Have you any<br />
recent views. Did you change your thoughts about the<br />
South African situation when you , ot to London and had<br />
these talks?<br />
PRIME AINISTER: Change ; rhat position?<br />
QUESTIONT: Joll you were joing to form some opinions about<br />
South Africa.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Yes. I don't feel anymore disposed than I did then<br />
to make a speech about South Africa's internal policies,<br />
but I have views about them, yes.<br />
QUESTION: You were speaking : bout other countries in which you<br />
said the position generally " might become explosive".<br />
Does that apply too. would you say to South Africa?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Well, yes. I am very glad I don't have the responsibility<br />
of government in South Africa, because I<br />
think that there are certain ideas that are there current<br />
and practised, the workability of which I gravely<br />
doubt. That is an understatement. I don't think they<br />
will work. But I'm not going to pruach to them. Too<br />
much preaching to the South Africans has been done. It<br />
is the best possible way in which to harden them in,<br />
perhaps, n inflexible application of their policies.<br />
QUESTION: Can you tcll us nything about the situation in<br />
Tokyo?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: ioll it happened when I was in mid-air, so to<br />
speak, but I don't feel very happy about it. oJem ight<br />
as well face up to it. This is, from a public point of<br />
view, however it may be explained, an admission that the<br />
Government of Japan doesn't feel : ble to control unruly<br />
elements at a time when there is a proposed visit from<br />
the President of the United States Japan's most<br />
powerful friend since the rar. Well, that I think, is<br />
a most unhappy event. Once again nobody would envy<br />
Prime Minister Kishi the choice that he had to make. He<br />
might very wellsay, " Well I am not going to put my<br />
distinguished visitor at any risk", but the end result<br />
of it all is that the Communists have scored a notable<br />
propaganda victory and Communist minorities in gon-communist<br />
countries will be encouraged to believe that they<br />
can push Governments around, Woll, that is a pretty<br />
serious weakening of the position. ! We havo, well all of<br />
us have looked to Japan in this sense that Japan was to<br />
be encouraged to stay out of the Communist orbit, that<br />
we in Australia, for example, would increase our trade<br />
with Japan, our economic contacts, because we realised<br />
that a Japan that wasn't economically sound was much<br />
more likely to pass into the control of the Communist<br />
powers. The United States has adopted the same view and<br />
the result has been that a good deal of the specific<br />
concept both of the United States and of our own country<br />
ind others . round these parts, has boon based on,<br />
at any rate, a stable non-Communist orderly Japan, repenting<br />
of the past and learning to live in a civilised<br />
fashion with the world, and in it. And under those<br />
circumstances this gree-t concession to the capacity of<br />
a rol tively few people to do mischief is, I think well<br />
very unhappy, perhaps unavoidable, I don't know. </p>
<p>markedly different from one or two other bowlers I've<br />
seen, nor were either of the three balls for which he<br />
was called markedly different from any of the others<br />
that he bowled that day. However, who am Ito say?<br />
QUESTION: Did you find any interest in the Australian economy<br />
while you were over there?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Yes, well I was very interested to find both in<br />
Great Britain and in the United States that there is a<br />
very great concentration of interest, economically, on<br />
Australia. The disposition in the United Kingdom is to<br />
move ratler more and more in the direction of Australia<br />
for the purposes of investment on the ground, apart<br />
from the fact that we are a stable community, as we are,<br />
that there are all sorts of enormous possibilities of<br />
future development. And in the United States, particularly<br />
in financial circles in the United States, it is<br />
really quite exciting to discover the attitude that<br />
men who are engaged in dealing with investable funds,<br />
find what their attitude is towards Australia. I have<br />
come back a complete optomist about the attitude of<br />
these great countries overseas to us and to our develop-<br />
Â® ment and I would confidently expect that unless we do<br />
something pretty silly or are hit by some strange<br />
catastrophe, we will find, year by year, an increasing<br />
interest expressed in practical terms.<br />
QUESTION: On the local political situation, Sir will you be<br />
taking part in the Bendigo and Balaclava by-elections?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I haven't a clue, though I strongly suspect.<br />
QUESTION: I thought you had probably received cables<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Oh, no. I've boon too interested in reading all<br />
the side-play about Bendigo.<br />
QUESTION: -Iould you comment on that.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Well, I've . hoard a fuw " rumbles" ( Laughter)<br />
QUESTION: Did your oconomic talks in England and America<br />
embrace questions of monopoly and restrictive practices,<br />
Mr. Prime Minister?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No, Sir. Not as far as I was concerned, no.<br />
QUESTION: Did you reach any understanding, Sir, about the<br />
future of missile tusts and the Joomera Range?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Nothing more than you know. They believe there<br />
that the Joomrora programme, in total, won't be very<br />
materially affected. They are still working on the<br />
question as to whether they ought to go in for space<br />
research, in which case ' oomera, of course, would have<br />
further application. But so far we have had no report,<br />
unless it's cone within the last day or two. But they<br />
wore working on that when I was there. I think they are<br />
interested in the problem of space research myself, but<br />
of course it isavery largo financial considoration.<br />
QUESTION: Could you tell us, Sir, if you think the world has moved<br />
in the time you've boon away? Do you think the situation<br />
has improved?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I think it's moved a little eccentrically. But now<br />
that I'm back, no doubt all that will change.<br />
With the compliments of:<br />
Hugh Dash, Press Secretary to the Primo Minister. </p>
