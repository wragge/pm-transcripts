PRIME MINISTER<br />
PARTIAL TRANSCRIPT OF DOORSTOP, PARLIAMENT HOUSE, 14<br />
SEPTEMBER 1989<br />
E 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
JOURNALIST: What can you say to an industry that you can't<br />
compensate PM: Well, let me say first of all, that I have greatly<br />
appreciated the constructive way in which the<br />
representatives of the tourist industry here assembled, have<br />
asked to see me today and the spirit in which they've put<br />
their position. You mentioned compensation, let me say they<br />
haven't asked for compensation and I appreciate that point.<br />
But what they have properly asked for is that, as a<br />
Government, we should recognise, as we do, the considerable<br />
hurt that's been caused to the tourism industry one of our<br />
great industries, one of our great growth industries, in the<br />
past and for the future. They have asked that we understand<br />
the serious problems that have been caused for the industry<br />
generally and, of course, for some particular people in the<br />
industry, grievous problems. we do understand that<br />
situation and I've responded positively to their request<br />
that the Government should look at hdW, in the post dispute<br />
situation, that we can prepare the way for the full<br />
restoration of confidence overseas and within this country<br />
for this industry. We share, the industry and myself on<br />
behalf of the Government, we share the view that Australia<br />
remains one of the most attractive tourist destinations for<br />
people around the world wanting to have a good holiday. And<br />
for people within Australia, it remains a most attractive<br />
country in terms of all the tourism opportunities that are<br />
there. Now, I have ' responded positively to their concerns<br />
and they are going to put some more detailed proposals to me<br />
as to how, together, the Government and the industry, can<br />
rebuild and expand further this great industry. I have<br />
appreciated very much the opportunity of meeting with them<br />
and together pledging ourselves to the rebuilding of this<br />
industry.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, given the industry's comments<br />
yesterday, I can only assume that one of the pleas they made<br />
to you was to get this dispute ended as quickly as possible.<br />
The pilots now appear to be saying that ' we're prepared to<br />
go flying again as long as there can be negotiations. No<br />
. strings-attached other than that'. Why can't that happen? </p>
<p>-2-<br />
PM: Well, I've made quite clear that, as far as the pilots<br />
of this country are concerned, the avenue is there in<br />
increasing numbers and they're taking that avenue. They are<br />
signing up with the airlines. The leadership of the<br />
Federation has created the situation now where they have no<br />
status, they have no members employed in the industry and<br />
those who are signing up have made it quite clear that, as<br />
far as they are concerned, they have a very strong view that<br />
they want no dealings with the Federation. Let me make it<br />
quite clear in saying those things that it is appropriate<br />
that pilots should join up now. The airlines want them, we<br />
want them back. I've never had any dispute with individual<br />
pilots, it's with their leadership. I want to see as many<br />
of the pilots who've served this country back there doing it<br />
again within an airline industry which is going to be a very<br />
much more efficient industry and that, by example, let me<br />
make the further point that it will be my clear expectation<br />
that when those pilots do sign up in that way, which will<br />
accelerate the restoration of a full airline industry in<br />
this country and that's going to happen. If they sign up<br />
quickly then that's going to accelerate the restoration of a<br />
full airline industry. In those circumstances, of course,<br />
there will be a place for an organisation of pilots. We're<br />
not looking at a situation of de-unionising pilots, but<br />
because the Federation has instructed their people to resign<br />
they have no members in the industry. The way is open now<br />
for pilots to rejoin on their individual contracts and, of<br />
course, as that happens, looking to the future there will<br />
obviously be some organisation to represent the pilots.<br />
