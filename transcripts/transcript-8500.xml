SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P. 3. KEATING MP<br />
CORAL SEA RECEPTION, GREAT HALL, PARLIAMENT HOUSE<br />
4 MAY 1992<br />
It is my great privilege tonight to host this reception in<br />
honour of those American and Australian servicemen and<br />
women whose courage and sacrifice fifty years ago did so<br />
much to keep us free.<br />
The Battle of the Coral Sea was the first major check to<br />
Japanese miiay expansion in our region. It forced a<br />
seemingly invincible enemy to rethink and reconstruct<br />
their plans for domination of the area.<br />
Plans which, after the battles of New Guinea, the Solomon<br />
Islands and Midway they were forced to abandon altogether.<br />
in stemming the tide of Japanese aggression, the Battle of<br />
the Coral Sea had great consequences for the war.<br />
It also had great consequences for the peace: for it<br />
forged a bond between Australia and the United States<br />
which will endure for as long as the cause of democracy<br />
endures with us.<br />
The bond has its most obvious manifestation in the<br />
alliance between our countries.<br />
The war in the Pacific was the foundation of that<br />
alliance. But its resilience derives from more then our experience<br />
of World War II.<br />
It derives principally from our long friendship.<br />
Americans have been coming here for 200 years.<br />
They came to trade in the earliest days of European<br />
settlement. In 1840 the united States Exploring Expedition<br />
came in the course of their remarkable scientific survey<br />
of the Pacific. </p>
<p>in 1908 the Great White Fleet came and received a<br />
stupendous welcome.<br />
Austra liens have always recognised something of themselves<br />
in Americans as well they might.<br />
We are both countries of the New World as one great<br />
Australian patriot of a much less complex age exclaimed<br />
Christopher Columbus and James Cook were the saviours of<br />
mankind. These days we don't imagine ourselves, or even the two<br />
explorers, in such exalted terms.<br />
But we do remainz countries whose strength has been the<br />
strength of those who not only imagined a better life, but<br />
who had the courage to seek it.<br />
And who sought it and made it in the New World, in our<br />
countries. We both derive our strength from individual effort and<br />
initiative.<br />
We derive it therefore by enshrining those values which<br />
encourage and protect the rights and opportunities of<br />
individuals I mean tolerance, freedom and justice.<br />
Our strength, and the strength of our alliance, is derived<br />
from our shared liberal, democratic and humane values.<br />
These remain, I believe, our common aspirations: they<br />
are, I have no doubt, our areatast aspirations.<br />
It follows that It is our common duty, our duty to the<br />
heroes of the Coral Sea, to see that those values are not<br />
eroded. Nor can we say that we have fulfilled our duty, if we fail<br />
to create in this generation faith and hope of the kind<br />
which inspired those men and women of 1942 to risk<br />
everything for the cause of their countries.<br />
That is why it is not enough on this fiftieth anniversary<br />
of the battles which decided our future, to merely pay<br />
homage to the past we will most truly honour the Coral<br />
Sea heroes when we find the ways to guarantee the future<br />
of the next generation as they guaranteed ours.<br />
if we are to r. eiuain countries of hope and faith, it seems<br />
to me that we must be countries of renewal. We must be<br />
prepared to move on.<br />
While taking care to preserve those great democratic<br />
values and traditions on which our way of life is built,<br />
and for which so ma~ ny fought and died, we must change. </p>
<p>3<br />
That is why Australia seeks a renewed sense of national<br />
purpose. It is also why the Australian government now directs so<br />
much of its attention to its economic transformation and<br />
its trade and political focus to the Asia-Pacific region.<br />
For us, it is the direction of the future: a rapidly<br />
changing reality which Australians are now accommodating.<br />
For the same reason Australia would like to see the United<br />
States reaffirm its role in the region.<br />
We would like to see a US institutional and investment<br />
presence to match the trade and strategic one.<br />
We think it would be in the Uinited States' interests, and<br />
very much in the interests of the region, if the world's<br />
greatest liberal democracy were integrated with Asia and<br />
the Pacific to a degree at least equivalent to that<br />
obtaining with Europe.<br />
A greater US presence in the Pacific can on ly help the<br />
region fulfill the promise of its name as an ocean of<br />
peace and stability.<br />
We would like to see the friendship so manifest fifty<br />
years ago renewed and regenerated in this year of<br />
cornmemioration and in the years to come.<br />
I take this opportunity to welcome Secretary Cheney and Dr<br />
Cheney to Canberra.<br />
And to welcome all of you particularly, of course, those<br />
veterans to whom we are all so indebted and in whose<br />
honour tonight's reception is held. </p>
