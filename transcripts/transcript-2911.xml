SPEECIH BY. THE PRIME MINISTER,<br />
1TE lION, E. G, WHITLAM, M. P,,<br />
AT THE i'ITH ANNUAL CONVIENTION OF THE<br />
INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS SOCIETY OF N. SW.,<br />
HOTEL FLORIDA, TERRIGAL, N, SJW., 5 MAY 1973<br />
PRICES, INCOMES AND INFLATION<br />
IT IS TEMPTING TO BELI'EVE THAT A SUCCESSFUL PRICES<br />
AND INCOMES POLICY CAN BE A MAGIC REMEDY, NOT ONLY FOR<br />
INFLATION, BUT FOR ALL THE ILLS OF SOCIETY, IF ONLY<br />
-GOVERNMENTS COULD CONTROL PRICES AND WAGES SO THE ARGUMENT<br />
GOES WE WOULD BE WELL ON THE WAY TO A MORE JUST AND<br />
PROSPEROUS NATION. THE DILIGENCE WITH WHICH PRICES AND<br />
INCOMES POLICIES ARE PURSUED IN MANY WESTERN COUNTRIES IS<br />
TESTIMONY TO THE POWER OF THIS IDEA. THAT THESE POLICIES<br />
HAVE SO OFTEN FAILED OR AT BEST MET WITH LIMITED SUCCESS<br />
HAS NOT DETERRED OTHER COUNTRIES FROM ATTEMPTING THEM,<br />
11/ 2,, </p>
<p>AUSTRALIA IS NO EXCEPTION, MY OWN GOVERNMENT,<br />
AS YOU KNOW, IS COMMITTED TO A RANGE OF ANTI-INFLATIONARY<br />
POLICIES INCLUDING THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A PRICES JUSTIFICATION<br />
TRIBUNAL, BY WHICH WVIE INTEND TO BRING THE MOST FORMIDABLE<br />
OFFICIAL AND PUBLIC PRESSURE TO BEAR IN AN EFFORT TO KEEP<br />
PRICES DOWN, NEXT THURSDAY" WE SHALL BE MEETING THE STATE<br />
GOVERNMENTS IN CANBERRA TO D'ISCUSS ' THE PROBLEM OF INFLATION<br />
AND POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS TO IT,<br />
FOR LET THERE BE NO DOUBT OF HOW SERIOUSLY MY<br />
GOVERNMENT REGARDS THIS PROBLEM OR THE STRENGTH OF OUR<br />
DETERMINATION TO TACKLE IT, INFLATION IS INCREASINGLY<br />
RECOGNISED AS THE MOST FORMIDABLE AND INTRACTABLE PROBLEM<br />
OF ECONOMIC MANAGEMENT, MANY GOVERNMENTS AROUND THE WORLD<br />
NOW BELIEVE THIS TO BE SO. THE PACE OF INFLATION HAS<br />
QUICKENED IN THE 1970s IN MOST COUNTRIES, AUSTRALIA INCLUDED,<br />
IT IS ALREADY BECOMING CLEAR THAT THE THREAT OF<br />
INFLATION WILL BE THE MOST SERIOUS ECONOMIC PROBLEM<br />
FACING THE GOVERNMENT, THE LABOUR MARKET HAS MOVED RAPIDLY<br />
IN RECENT MONTHS TOWARDS FULL EMPLOYMENT LEVELS AND THE<br />
TREND SEEMS CERTAIN TO CONTINUE, WE WELCOME THIS; WE<br />
ENCOURAGED IT, BUT IN SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES THERE IS THE<br />
MAXIMUM OPPORTUNITY FOR PRODUCERS TO RAISE PRICES, THE<br />
LEAST INCENTIVE TO RESIST INCREASING COSTS, AND THE LEAST<br />
OPPORTUNITY FOR EFFECTIVE CONSUMER RESISTANCE, </p>
<p>PROBABLY THERE IS NO SINGLE SOLUTION PRACTICABLE<br />
OR IMPRACTICAL, JUST OR UNJUST TO THE PROBLEM OF INFLATION,<br />
THERE ARE, HOWEVER, SOME CLEAR CONCLUSIONS TO BE DRAWN FROM<br />
AUSTRALIAN AND OVERSEAS EXPERIENCE ABOUT THE REQUIREMENTS<br />
OF AN EFFECTIVE ANTI-INFLATIONARY POLICY, A PRE-CONDITION<br />
FOR SUCH A POLICY IS EFFICIENt MANAGEMENT OF OVERALL DEMAND<br />
BY SOUND BUDGETARY AND CREDIT POLICIES, No POLICY, OR<br />
COMBINATION OF POLICIES, DESIGNED TO AFFECT PRICES OR<br />
INCOMES DIRECTLY CAN BE SUCCESSFUL IF EXCESSIVE PRESSURES<br />
ON RESOURCES ARE'ALLOWED TO DEVELOP,<br />
SECONDLY, THE OVERALL ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT MUST BE<br />
RIGHT, THE EXCHANGE RATE MUST BE APPROPRIATE, POLICIES<br />
ON RESTRICTIVE PRACTICES, TARIFFS AND CONSUMER PROTECTION<br />
MUST ENCOURAGE COMPETITION AND LIMIT OPPORTUNITIES FOR<br />
PUSHING UP PRICES, GOVERNMENTSAND THEIR AUTHORITIES MUST<br />
FOLLOW RESPONSIBLE POLICIES ON PRICING AND EMPLOYMENT<br />
CONDITIONS, THIS IS THE CONTEXT INTO WHICH PRICES AND<br />
INCOMES POLICIES HAVE TO BE FITTED, THE GOVERNMENT BELIEVES<br />
THAT THERE IS A PLACE FOR SUCH POLICIES, BUT IT DOES NOT<br />
BELIEVE THEY ARE A CURE-ALL FOR INFLATION, v </p>
<p>THERE ARE, OF COURSE, FAVOURABLE FACTORS IN THE<br />
PRESENT SITUATION, THE RISING STRENGTH OF THE LABOUR<br />
MARKET SHOULD ENABLE POLICIES DESIGNED TO RESTRAIN PRICES<br />
TO BE UNDERTAKEN WITHOUT FEAR , OF CREATING GENERAL UNEMPLOYMENT.<br />
THE STRENGTH OF THE CURRENT BALANCE OF PAYMENTS AND THE HIGH<br />
LEVEL OF INTERNATIONAL RESERVES ( DESPITE THE WITHDRAWAL OF<br />
SOME FUNDS AFTER THE RECENT CURRENCY REALIGNMENTS) ALSO MEAN<br />
THAT WE CAN CONTEMPLATE AN INCREASED INFLOW OF IMPORTED<br />
GOODS WITHOUT ANXIETY ON THE INTERNATIONAL ACCOUNT.<br />
WE HAVE ALSO TAKEN HELPFUL ACTION ON THE EXCHANGE<br />
RATE. AN EXCHANGE RATE WHICH UNDERVALUES THE DOMESTIC<br />
CURRENCY INCREASES THE COST OF IMPORTED GOODS, INCLUDING<br />
MATERIALS FOR INDUSTRY, PREVENTS EFFECTIVE COMPETITION BY<br />
IMPORTS, REDUCES RESISTANCE BY PRODUCERS TO RISING COSTS,<br />
AND HELPS MAKE THE CONSUMER HELPLESS IN THE FACE OF ORGANISED<br />
PRICE INCREASES, OUR REVALUATION OF THE DOLLAR LAST DECEMBER<br />
WAS A VALUABLE ANTI-INFLATIONARY MEASURE, 1/ 5. </p>
<p>FURTHERMORE, my GOVERNMENT HAS UNDERTAKEN A RANGE<br />
OF SPECIAL ANTI-INFLATIONARY POLICIES, DON'T WANT MY<br />
REMARKS TO SOUND TOO MUCH LIKE A RECITAL OF GOVERNMENT<br />
POLICY THE PROPER PLACE FOR THAT WOULD BE IN VICTORIA<br />
RATHER THAN TERRIGAL BUT I SHALL MENTION BRIEFLY SOME OF<br />
THE THINGS WE ARE DOING. L HAVE REFERRED TO OUR PRICES<br />
TRIBUNAL. WE HAVE ALSO ESTABLISHED A JOINT PARLIAMENTARY<br />
STANDING COMMITTEE TO REVIEW PRICES IN KEY SECTORS, WE WILLSTRENGTHEN<br />
THE LAWS AGAINST RESTRICTIVE TRADE PRACTICES,<br />
WE WILL USE OUR POWERS THROUGH TARIFFS, SUBSIDIES AND CONTRACTS<br />
TO PREVENT UNJUSTIFIED PRICE RISES WHEREVER WE CAN, THE<br />
AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT IS THE NATION'I S BIGGEST SINGLE CUSTOMER<br />
AND MOST IMPORTANT SINGLE CONSUMER, As SUCH IT CAN EXERCISE<br />
A CONSIDERABLE INFLUENCE ON PRICE MOVEMENTS, BY HELPING THE<br />
CONSUMER TO A BETTER AND INFORMED AWARENESS OF THE PRICE AND<br />
QUALITY OF AVAILABLE GOODS, WIE CAN DO MUCH TO DISCOURAGE<br />
EXORHITANT OR IRRESPONSIBLE PRICE RISES,<br />
IN THE LAST RESORT, HOWEVER, THERE IS A LIMIT TO<br />
WHAT ANY GOVERNMENT CAN DO TO CONTROL THE LEVELS OF PRICES<br />
OR WAGES, IT IS TRUE GOVERNMENTS CAN R'ESORT TO A STATUTORY<br />
FREEZE IMPOSED BY EXECUTIVE ORDER, SOME COUNTRIES HAVE<br />
ATTEMPTED THESE CONTROLS; NO COUNTRY HAS REGARDED THEM AS<br />
ANYTHING BUT A TEMPORARY MEASURE, IN DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY<br />
THERE IS A LIMIT TO THE WAY THESE POWERS CAN BE USED. THERE<br />
IS A LIMIT TO THEIR EFFECTIVENESS,# THERE IS A LIMIT TO THEIR<br />
POLITICAL ACCEPTABILITY IN A FREE SOCIETY, THERE IS A LIMIT<br />
TO THEIR ENFORCEABILITY, THERE IS A LIMIT TO THE ADMINISTRATIVE<br />
MACHINERY NEEDED TO SUPERVISE THEM, </p>
<p>6,<br />
IN OTHER WORDS, IN ANYTHING SHORT OF A TOTALITARIAN<br />
SOCIETY, GOVERNMENTS ARE RESTRAINED IN THEIR ABILITY TO ADJUST<br />
WAGES AND PRICES AS THEY PLEASE. OUR PROPER CONCERN, THEREFORE,<br />
IS NOT WITH WHAT GOVERNMENTS CANNOT DO, BUT WITH WHAT THEY<br />
CA. AND SHOULD DO. THE QUALITY OF LIFE WHAT USED TO BE<br />
CALLED THE STANDARD OF LIVING..-DEPENDS ON A WHOLE RANGE OF<br />
CONDITIONS AND SERVICES WHICH GloVERNMENTS CAN DETERMINE AND<br />
PROVIDE, WHICHi GOVERNMENTS ALONE CAN DETERMINE AND PROVIDE.<br />
A MANUFACTURER CAN INCREASE THE PRICE OF HIS GOODS; HE CANNOT<br />
PROVIDE A HOUSING SCHEME, A DOCTOR CAN RAISE HIS FEES AT<br />
LEAST HIE MAY THINK HE CAN BUT HE CANNOT PROVIDE A HEALTH<br />
SERVICE. A BUSINESS F* IRM CAN INCREASE ITS CHARGES: IT CANNOT<br />
PROVIDE MORE SCHOOLS, BETTER ROADS'OR IMPROVED COMMUNITY SERVICES,<br />
THESE THINGS ARE THE PROVINCE OF GOVERNMENTS,<br />
ISIMPLY MAKE THE POINT THAT THE SEARCH FOR A PRICES<br />
AND INCOMES POLICY HOWEVER DESIRABLE IT MAY BE MUST NOT<br />
BECOME A SUBSTITUTE FOR ACTION IN AREAS WHERE GOVERNMENTS HAVE<br />
A REAL AND UNCHALLENGED POWER TO IMPROVE THE STANDARDS OF OUR<br />
LIVES, NOR MUST THE FEAR OF INFLATION BLIND US TO THE FACT<br />
THAT THERE ARE WORSE ECONOMIC EVILS, IDO NOT ACCEPT THAT THE<br />
DELIBERATE CREATION OF UNEMPLOYMENT CAN * EVER BE AN ACCEPTABLE<br />
REMEDY TO INFLATIONARY PRESSURES. [ HIS VIEW IS STILL HELD BY<br />
SOME OF OUR OPPONENTS. IN THE PAST, BUDGETS HAVE BEEN FRAMED<br />
AND ECONOMIC POLICIES IMPLEMENTED IN BLIND SUBSERVIENCE TO THIS<br />
CRUEL AND DISCREDITED THEORY, EVEN IF THE. THEORY WERE TRUE, MY<br />
GOVERNM~ ENT WOULD UNHESITATINGLY REJECT SUCH AN APPROACH, THE<br />
CURE WOULD BE WORSE THAN THE DISEASE, 1 17 a </p>
<p>7,<br />
THE REAL VICTIMS-OF INFLATION ARE THOSE ON SMALL<br />
INCOMES -MORE ESPECIALLY THOSE ON FIXED INCOMES, FOR THE<br />
MAN WHO MUST SPEND NEARLY ALL OF HIS INCOME IN ORDER TO LIVE,<br />
INCREASES OF A NEW CENTS IN THE BASIC COMMODITIES ARE KEENLY<br />
FELT. THEY MAY INDEED BE CRUCIAL TO HIS HEALTH, HIS WELL-BEING,<br />
HIS COMFORT. HIoW THEN CAN A HUMANE GOVERNMENT BEST ASSIST HIM?<br />
THE TRUTH IS THAT EVEN IF INFLATION IS CONTROLLED, THE MAN ON<br />
SUCH AN INCOME IS STILL AT A CRIPPLING DISADVANTAGE. GOVERNMENTS<br />
CAN THEREFORE HELP HIM BY ATTACKING THE SOCIAL INJUSTICES THAT<br />
DISCRIMINATE AGAINST HIM AND RENOVATING THE INEFFICIENT PUBLIC<br />
SERVICES HE IS FORCED TO USE.<br />
LET US TAKE THE TYP-ICAL ' AUSTRALIAN TYPICAL AS<br />
PORTRAYED BY THE STATISTICIANS. YOU WILL NOTICE TONIGHT THAT<br />
IHAVE REFRAINED FROM USING TOO MANY STATISTICS. ISUSPECT<br />
THAT IN THE PAST 24i HOURS YOU HAVE HAD A SURFEIT OF THEM. IT<br />
IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER WHAT WALTER BAGEHOT SAID OF STATISTICS:<br />
" THE ECONOMIST USES STATISTICS MUCH AS THE DRUNKARD USES LAMPPOSTS<br />
FOR SUPPORT RATHER THAN ILLUMINATION." NEVERTHELESS,<br />
WE MAY CONSIDER AN AUSTRALIAN EARNING $ 1011 A WEEK AS AN EMPLOYEE<br />
( THOUGH THE AV'ERAGE WAGE MUST NOT BE REGARDED AS THE TYPICAL<br />
WAGE), BRINGING up 2AL CHILDREN AND LIVING IN A SUBURB OR TOWN<br />
OF 10,000 PEOPLE, THE FIRST AIM OF A MODERN GOVERNMENT MUST<br />
BE TO ENSURE THAT HIS EMPLOYMENT IS SECURE, 1/ 81 1 </p>
<p>8,<br />
BY ABOLISHING THE INEFFICIENCY AND UNFAIRNESS OF<br />
THE PRESENT HEALTH SCHEME WE CAN REDUCE THE COST OF CONTRIBUTIONS<br />
OF THE AVERAGE MANI WE CAN REMOVE THE FEARS AND DOUBTS OF<br />
THOSE WHO STILL HESITATE BEFORE MAKING AN EXTRA VISIT TO THE<br />
DOCTOR, BY ATTACKING INEQUALITY IN EDUCATION FROM PRE-SCHOOLS<br />
THROUGH TO UNIVERSITIES WE CAN ENSURE THAT THOSE ON LOW<br />
INCOMES WILL NOT BE DISADVANTAGED MORE THAN OTHERS THROUGH<br />
THE EROSION OF THAT PART OF THEIR INCOME THEY SPEND ON<br />
EDUCATION FOR THEIR CHILDREN, PENSIONERS THOSE ON FIXED<br />
INCOMES, THE PRIMARY VICTIMS OF INFLATION MUST BE ASSURED<br />
THAT IN ILLNESS THEY WILL GET ALL POSSIBLE CARE, AND THAT<br />
THE ABOLITION OF THE MEANS TEST AND THE INTRODUCTION OF<br />
NATIONAL SUPERANNUATION WILL HELP REMOVE THE HARDSHIPS OF<br />
RETIREMENT, WHEN THE EFFECTS OF INFLATION ARE MOST UNSPARING,<br />
NONE OF THESE MEASURES CAN BE REGARDED AS-A CURE<br />
FOR INFLATION, THEY ARE NOT A SUBSTITUTE FOR A SUCCESSFUL<br />
PRICES AND INCOMES POLICY, ANY MORE THAN A PRICES AND INCOMES<br />
POLICY CAN BE A SUBSTITUTE FOR SOCIAL REFORM, MY GOVERNMENT<br />
BELIEVES THAT RESTRAINTS ON PRICES, ANDTHE ORDERLY DETERMINATION<br />
OF PERSONAL INCOMES, ARE MERELY ONE INGREDIENT IN THE RECIPE<br />
FOR A MORE JUST AND PROSPEROUS NATION, </p>
<p>IHA\' E NO DOUBT, FROM THE ATTENDANCE AT THIS<br />
SEMINAR, AND Å EEING SO MANY DISTINGUISHED SPEAKERS, THAT YOU<br />
HAVE MADE A VALUABLE STUDY OF A DIFFICULT AND PERHAPS<br />
INTRACTABLE PROBLEM, I CONGRATULATE THE INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS<br />
SOCIETY OF NEW SOUTH WALES ON. ITS MOST SUCCESSFUL MEETING.<br />
IT IS A TRUISW TO SAY TH4AT THERE ARE NO EASY SOLUTIONS TO<br />
MODERN INFLATION OR THE FEASIBILITY OF PRICE-INCOME POLICIES.<br />
MY CONCERN IS TO REMIND YOU THAT WHILE WE MAY NOT KNOW THE<br />
ACCEPTABLE SOLUTIONS, AT LEAST WE KNOW THOSE WHICH ARE NQT<br />
ACCEPTABLE. N'O SOL. UTION IS ACCEPTABLE IF ITS BURDENS ARE<br />
NOT SHARED FAIRLY BY THE WH1OLE COMMUNITY, NO SOLUTION IS<br />
ACCEPTABLE IF IT DISCRIMIIATES AGAINST THE VEAKEST AND MOST<br />
DEFENCELESS SECTIONS OF SOCIETY. No SOLUTION IS ACCEPTABLE<br />
IF IT TOLERATE: HIGH LEVELS OF UNEMPLOYMENT, NO SOL. UTION IS<br />
ACCEPTABLE IF T IGNORES THE NEED FOR FUNDAMENTAL REFORMS,<br />
IT IS WITHIN THOSE LIMITS, AND UPON THOSE CONDITIONS, THAT<br />
INFLATION MUST BE FOUGHT. MY GOVERNMENT BELIEVES THAT WITH<br />
YOUR CO-OPERATION, THE CO-OPERATION OF ALL SIDES OF INDUSTRY,<br />
THE BATTLE CAN BE WON. </p>
