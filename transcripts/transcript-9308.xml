STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
SYDNEY CASINO<br />
The decision by the New South Wales Government to build the new casino In<br />
pyrmont Is regrettable and I call on Premier Fahey o reconsider this move ' in<br />
light of thie widespread criticism it has attracted.<br />
A major casino has the potential to significantly benefit Sydney through<br />
Increased tourism, more jobs and a wider range of entertainment. It could<br />
help make Sydney an even more lively city.<br />
But, the casino has to be the right building in the right location. The middle of<br />
Pyrmont is patently the wrong location for such a large structure.<br />
The decision to site the Casino in Pyrmont runs counter to the character of<br />
the area and to the finer textured development that we are trying to achieve<br />
under the Commonwealth's Better Cities Program.<br />
The Better Cities Program for UltimolPyrmont also aims to reduce traffic<br />
congestion and pollution and increase the residential population of the area<br />
in a way sympathetic to its rich heritage.<br />
Today's press reported that the Sydney City Council Intends to challenge the<br />
plan for the casino In court. I trust that the parties will work towards a<br />
satisfactory resolution that will be of lasting benefit to Sydney.<br />
