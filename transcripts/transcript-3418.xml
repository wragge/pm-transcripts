PRIME MINISTER'S PRESS CONFERENCE<br />
CANBERRA, TUESDAY, 15 OCTOBER 1974<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Are there any questions?<br />
QUESTION: In light of Mr. Snedden's remarks that he is waiting<br />
for the call of the people, that he is planning to move towards<br />
an early general election and in light of the reports that you,<br />
yourself, have briefed ministers about the possibility of an<br />
election in December, can you now spell out your views on the chances<br />
of an early election? Will there or won't there and, if so, when?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: My view is that the people spoke in December 1972<br />
and again in May 1974 they spoke decisively in each case. In each<br />
case they intended to elect a government for the following three years.<br />
They elected, in each case, a Labor Government. The Parliament-first<br />
sat in July. That means that there should not be another election<br />
for the House of Representatives until the middle of 1977. My<br />
Government is proceeding with its program on that basis; that it<br />
has been re-elected for three years. Now, the Opposition is clearly<br />
wanting to get the public used to the attitude that there should be<br />
elections more frequently than at theee-year intervals. The<br />
Constitution very clearly has proposed that there should be an<br />
election every three years for the House of Representatives and<br />
every three years for half the Senate, those elections being at the<br />
same time. Now, because of the Double Dissolution, there must be<br />
an election for half the Senate just before the middle of 1976* and<br />
there shouldn't be an election for the House of Representatives<br />
until the middle of 1977. Now, it is true that any time, twice a year,<br />
the Senate can refuse Supply and thus produce an election for the<br />
House of Representatives. It was done for the very first time in<br />
April this year. It'can be done, of course, any time in November<br />
when the Budget for the whole of the current financial year has co<br />
be decided or, say, the following May, when there have to be<br />
provisional appropriations for the first five months of the next<br />
financial year. Now accordingly it would be possible for the Senat.'!<br />
to reject~ a Budget in November or the Supply Bills next May, and it<br />
could reject them by just being evenly divided.<br />
Mr. Snedden constantly suggests that there may be an<br />
election. Now, it will depend not only on what he says but on wha.<br />
the senators say and he has no control over his senators. There<br />
two Liberal parties in the national Parliament. There is the Libc~.-, i<br />
Party in the House of Representatives; there is the Liberal Party<br />
in the Senate. And the Liberal Party in the Senate has a Leader<br />
and a Deputy Leader who are elected wholly by senators. Mr. Snede'<br />
has no part in choosing who the Leader or Deputy Leader will be in<br />
the Senate Liberal Party. They go their own way. So, naturally, ho~<br />
is confused. But I think there is more seriously an attitude by the<br />
Liberals in general to produce the idea that it is natural to have<br />
more frequent elections than the constitution envisaged, to give<br />
the impression that an election is always around the corner or may contt<br />
about you know, election jitters and upset business confidence<br />
through that idea. I don't believe there is any substantial view </p>
<p>-2-<br />
in Australia that there should be another election for the House<br />
of Representatives or that there should be an election for half<br />
the Senate before the due time just before the middle of 1976.<br />
It is on that basis that my Government is proceeding.<br />
Now it is true that there have been ten bills already<br />
rejected by the Senate since the new Parliament was elected. I forget<br />
about the six bills which they rejected a third time and on which<br />
there was a joint sitting. Apart from those six there have been ten<br />
rejected, two I think the week before last. Now, if after an<br />
interval of three months any of those bills is rejected again there<br />
can be a double dissolution situation again. If there is a double<br />
dissolution situation the Government won't advise the Governor-General<br />
to dissolve both Houses unless Supply is refused by the Senate.<br />
Obviously, if Supply is again refused by the Senate then I shall<br />
advise the Governor-General to dissolve both Houses on the basis<br />
of a second rejection if there is in fact a second rejection of any<br />
of these ten bills. I think the next work by Laurie Oakes and David<br />
Solomon is to be called " The Grab for Power". It is an account of<br />
the election in May last. I think that's just behind the whole of<br />
this talk. Mr. Snedden miscalculated, mistimed, last April.<br />
He blew his top in a bit of hysteria and the events of April.<br />
He miscalculted. Well, he always has to s * trut to justify what he did<br />
then. I believe, in fact, he will be very cautious about himself,<br />
and the Senate Liberal Party will be rather cautious also.<br />
QUESTION: While you were overseas the Education and Economic<br />
Commnitte'e of Caucus decided that the $ 400 tax allowance should be<br />
restored. What's your own personal view on this? What do you think<br />
Caucus is likely to decide, and do you think that this sort of<br />
recommendation, as Mr. Snedden has already said publicly, reflects<br />
on the quality of your leadership?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I'm not obsessed with the qualities of my leadership.<br />
I've been leader of a political party in the national Parliament<br />
longer than most people have the privilege of leading any political<br />
party in this Parliament. I've been leader of my party for nearly<br />
eight years and t every election we have improved our percentA. je<br />
of the vote. I chn't have to promote the Fuhrerprinzip. I'll<br />
leave that to those who have failed as leaders. Now, about this<br />
education deduction proposition. My view is it remains that ztha<br />
' 1-00 deduction is a waste of money. The $ 150 deduction is ju~ tified.<br />
I 3t port the $ 150, I reject the $ 400. Now. Caucus Economnic<br />
arid Education Committees, which like all Caucus cormaittees ar.: selfappoii--<br />
d, made a recommendation that the deduction 5zhould remain<br />
at $ 400. sometimes wonder who my colleagues believe elected a<br />
Labor Govern. ' nt. Who they think a Labor Government should have first<br />
in mind. Now, the Lb cor Government has introduced legislation it<br />
was opposed at certain -2tages by our opponents but we have introduced<br />
legislation, and so far i' bFs been passed which means that there<br />
has been more than seven times a-large a provision * rurl For<br />
education by the Australian Government in the calen. pars 1974/ 75<br />
the two full years under us as was allocated by t~ i. last two full<br />
years 1971/ 72 by our predecessors. I advise you to look at Mr. Beazley's<br />
splendid article in today's Age. It gives a chapter and verse for<br />
the increased expenditure for education under my Government.<br />
The Education and Economic Committees self-apppointed of the<br />
Caucus recommended that the deduction should remain at $ 400, i. e.<br />
they recommended that $ 30 million more should be spent this year </p>
<p>-3-<br />
than the Budget provided. I mentioned this at the Cabinet meetinicj<br />
yesterday. I asked if any minister wished to re-consider this<br />
matter. Not one suggested we should re-consider it. Accordin-1y,<br />
when this matter comes up before the Caucus it will have the<br />
re-asserted view of the Cabinet that the money can be better spont.<br />
The last statistics show they are for 1971/ 72 that the average<br />
deduction for a dependent student only exceeded $ 150 a year for those<br />
who were on an income of $ 10,000 or more. It is quite obvious that<br />
money is better spent in the education field on improving facilities<br />
all over. Now, I don't deny that there are some parents who have to<br />
spend more boarding and so on for their children but we have<br />
catered for them through the isolated children's allowances which<br />
we-introduced. And similarly, of course, you could say that there<br />
were some disadvantaged areas where the community has to spend more,<br />
as for Aborigines, and we have done so. I commend Mr. Beazley's<br />
article to you for this. It will come up in Caucus and I believe<br />
it will be rejected as I strongly believe it should be.<br />
QUESTION: Mr. Connor said in Parliament this morning that he had<br />
prepared a White Paper for you on energy or uranium and that he<br />
had prepared it in good time. Will you now release that. paper?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: This is a Cabinet submission and it will be<br />
discussed in Cabinet.<br />
QUESTION: One of the reasons for the devaluation of the dollar<br />
was atit would have a beneficial effect on business confidence.<br />
Do you believe that it has? Has it had enough? And, particularly,<br />
would you consider any other forms of incentives such as some<br />
incentive like the investment allowance, re-introduction for a<br />
tentative period, if it turned out that business confidence hasn't<br />
reacted as you thought it would at the time of the devaluation?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: The devaluation has given a boost to business<br />
confidence. Those who study the Stock Exchange tell me that there<br />
has been a marked improvement there. Of course the Government<br />
will consider any of these matters. I, myself, at this stagje,<br />
would think there was no justification whatever for restoring<br />
the investment allowance. But, nevertheless, if circumstances<br />
change then obviously we would consider it. My Government, I believe,<br />
has shown that it is prepared to consider matters, or reconsider<br />
them, as circumstances change. It so showed in respect to devaluation<br />
and there is not a single member of Parliament who objects to the<br />
devaluation. In effect, our revaluations over the first 22 months,<br />
has been cut down to half that amount. The dollar is considerabi;,<br />
more valuable than it was when we came into off icc, 1-, it it has br~ er<br />
devalued from the height which it had reached.<br />
QUESTION: You just made reference to your own longevity as Leader<br />
of the Labor Party. I wish to ask a supplementary question to one<br />
which you answered in a recent Washington " Meet the Press" program.<br />
You were questioned about the dangers of left-wing groups in the<br />
Caucus ousting you and you replied that they would be cutting their<br />
own throats. I now ask....<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Any group that wanted to oust me w~ ould be cutting<br />
their own throat. I don't want you to think that the only throats<br />
to be cut would be those you describe as left-wing. </p>
<p>QUESTION: Do you regard yourself as indispensable to-the Labor<br />
* Party and do you believe that you are the only person competent<br />
to lead a Labor Government?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No, I believe there is a wealth of talent in<br />
the Australian Labor Government in this Parliament. I believe<br />
that I have the greatest amount of talent at the present time.<br />
But quite apart from what I may think about this, this is unquestionably<br />
the view of all my colleagues. This is not an issue on which I feel<br />
disposed to differ from them.<br />
QUESTION: Does it concern you that Caucus has already made one<br />
deciionon one of your Budget matters, namely the 10 per cent<br />
surcharge, and are threatening to do so on the education one as well?<br />
or, do you consider that this is just pure bloody mindedness?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Let me get this in perspective. We've been in<br />
power for over 22 months now and the Caucus has overuled the Cabinet<br />
on two occasions. Once was a year ago on the gold subsidy. The<br />
second was on reducing the range of taxpayers who had to pay a higher<br />
rate of tax on their unearned incomes. Now on this latter one<br />
there was no surprise on my part because,, in fact, when the matter<br />
came up for discussion in the Caucus one of those who supported the<br />
discussion of it by committees of Caucus was the Treasurer himself<br />
And what emerged from the committee consideration was in fact<br />
proposed by the Treasurer at the very Caucus meeting where it arose.:<br />
Now, I wasn't particularly upset by the change which was made. There<br />
has been an advance in what I believe was an equitable principle<br />
that people should pay a higher rate of tax on their unearned<br />
income than on their earned income. Now there is one other matter<br />
where you can say that during the lifetime of my government my view<br />
has been rejected by the Caucus, that was on the question of<br />
Parliamentary salaries. But the Cabinet wanted, proposed a view<br />
which the Caucus adopted. I was in a minority in the Cabinet and<br />
in the Caucus.<br />
QUESTION: I was just going to make an aside, Sir, that if there is<br />
any'blood letting or blood cutting, neck cutting, would you take<br />
that tie off and leave it for one of us before it happens. But,<br />
on a more serious note, have you made any comment yet on the result<br />
3f the British elections?<br />
-' RIME MINISTER: I sent a cable to Mr. Harold Wilson but I haven't<br />
made public comment. Nevertheless, I am very happy to say<br />
here, an.-it would come as no surprise to you, that I am delighted<br />
that the Labor Government has been re-elected and has a majority<br />
in its own right. rather sorry that my old professor, Enoch<br />
Powell, is exiled to the neighbouring islands and so on, but<br />
nevertheless, clearly I bull y7e that there should be government by a<br />
party which has a majority in its own right. I auw tlad that the<br />
British Labor Party now again has that.<br />
QUESTION: What is your view about the unsolicited distribution<br />
of bank cards and do you feel that they could add to inflation?<br />
And, also, did you receive one?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Yes I did, I did. -1 </p>
<p>QUESTION: Did Mrs. Whitlam, receive one?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Yes, she did. In recent months she has got an<br />
account of her own actually. So we received bank cards. Now, at<br />
last, when I don't have to establish my bona f ides as a creditor,<br />
credit is being foisted on me. I am not sure that we will use them<br />
or destory them or return them. I think that is the increasing<br />
order of probability.<br />
QUESTION: Can you say which one has the greater credit, or is<br />
that too personal?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Oh I think it is, but you are an old friend and<br />
I will talk to you afterwards. I mean you and I both married well.<br />
Comment: You have more houses than I have.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I think I was at your wedding and you at mine,<br />
and they have both lasted.<br />
Comment: Amazing.<br />
PRIME MINISTER: This was the first and best of my apppointments.<br />
QUESTION: Can I interrupt? Did you in fact in Cabinet yesterday<br />
discuss with your ministers the possibility of a December election?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No. I repeat, though, that we will not be working<br />
for any election before the three years is up.<br />
QUESTION: Did you have a discussion outside Cabinet?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Oh, obviously, one talks about varibus contingencies<br />
but I don't want to talk about what goes on in Cabinet. There were<br />
no agenda items on this and I shouldn't have to repeat that I<br />
believe that if you go to the people with a three-year program as<br />
we did, . then you should try to carry it out.<br />
QUESTION: On October 1, in his first day on the floor of the House<br />
as Acting Prime Minister, Dr. Cairns made it clear to the Parliament<br />
that the present reference to the Industries Assistance Commission<br />
apropos the new lands in Western Australia could be opened up as<br />
a general reference on the question of superphosphate and, in fact,<br />
was wide enough for a general reference. In view of that do<br />
you still adhere to what you said in the House this morning?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I don't know what Dr. Cairns said on this matter.<br />
Of course I adhere to what I said this morning.<br />
QUESTION: There seems to be some suggestion that the Government,<br />
afterall contrary to Mr. Enderby's announcement, may not buy the<br />
Leyland land at Waterloo. Was this matter discussed yesterday in<br />
Cabinet, and as far as you are concerned will the Government be<br />
proceeding with that?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: There was a report on this matter in Cabinet.<br />
I had discussed it with two or three of my colleagues before<br />
I went away three weeks ago and the general idea is that that land<br />
could be very effectively used by the Australian Government for a<br />
range of activities which it has in the urban field. </p>
<p>-6-<br />
It would not only be well situated for housing but also, quite<br />
clearly, for child-care and health centres and other initiatives<br />
.4n that area.<br />
QUESTION: Were you aware during the flight from Hawaii to Suva<br />
th~ at the Permanent Head of the Foreign Affairs Department, Mr.<br />
Renouf.... PRIME MINISTER: Well, before you go any further here, I was asked<br />
questions i1n the Parliament this morning and I will answer no further<br />
questions on it.<br />
QUESTION: Do you believe that Australian uranium producers should<br />
be allowed to negotiate new contracts for the sale of uranium abro-id?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Mr. Connor discussed this on a motion by Mr.<br />
Anthony on 2 October while we were away and again on a motion by<br />
Mr. Anthony this morning. I heard this time whAt he said, I read<br />
what he said on 2 October and I find each speech completely convincing.<br />
As I said in Question Time today, he massacred Mr. Anthony on 2<br />
October and he would masacre him today and he did.<br />
QUESTION: Yesterday morning you were offered some friendly advice<br />
from the President of the Miscellaneous Workers' Union, Mr. Roy<br />
Cameron? PRIME MINISTER: I have got nothing to add.<br />
QUESTION: On one point that you didn't refer to yesterday, Sir,<br />
was his remark that you should say more and your ministers should<br />
say less...<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I agree completely with what he said on that.<br />
QUESTION: If the education deduction of $ 400 is a waste of money,<br />
;;_ iT~ Wt an education deduction of $ 150 not also a waste of money?<br />
PRIME MINISTER! There are still a great number of things and<br />
services whic parents have to pay for themselves in the education<br />
fi ~ ld. We have, of course, made tertiary and technical education<br />
'. We have vastly increased the expenditure on schools. We are<br />
unc-. aking expenditure on the pre-schc~ ols and child-care facilities,<br />
tli~ jeneral matters in the scope of the children's commission which<br />
we arc ' oointing an interim committee. The objective, of course,<br />
must be tu t all the materials and services in the educational<br />
field provide2 free but they are not yet provided free, but $ 150<br />
would certainly cover v1' lat is not yet free.<br />
QUESTION: How important do you think the so-called " social contract"<br />
is in combating inflation and how optimistic are you that the<br />
forthcoming talks with the A. C. T. U. might lead to somec basis for<br />
such a contract?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Mr. Justice Moore's conference is resuming today<br />
and we are taking part in it so, although it is meeting in private,<br />
you know the attitudes we are taking there and you know also our<br />
reaction to the decisions of the A. C. T. U. meeting of unions three<br />
weeks ago. The " social contract", as you call it, as it's called </p>
<p>-7-<br />
in Britain, is the best hope for restraining cost inflation and<br />
we are moderately optimistic that we can bring about such arrangements<br />
in Australia. Clearly, a Labor Government is more likely to got<br />
those arrangements in Australia, as in Britain, than a Tory<br />
Government. </p>
