    <content><![CDATA[<p>E&amp;OE ......................................................................................</p>
<p>Thank you very much Larry for that very generous introduction. To your</p>
<p> wife Jenny, to Don Page, to councillor Lyn Beck, Dr Brian Pezutti MLC,</p>
<p> many other distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen.</p>
<p>As I think you have probably read and heard, I am in the middle of what</p>
<p> is, give or take the odd interruption, such as the flight down to Melbourne</p>
<p> last night to go to a certain dinner which I gather a lot of this audience</p>
<p> watched on television, is a week long visit to different parts of regional</p>
<p> Australia. I have variously called it a visit to regional Australia, to</p>
<p> country Australia, to the regions or to the bush, because as you know</p>
<p> those expressions these days tend to be a little interchangeable. And</p>
<p> it has so far been for me a very fascinating, instructive and in many</p>
<p> ways also quite rewarding experience.</p>
<p>I am doing it because I understand that in different parts of regional</p>
<p> Australia there is legitimate concern that the benefits of the national</p>
<p> economic strength that Australia has at the present moment is not being</p>
<p> as evenly shared as it might have been. And it is very important that</p>
<p> those of us who live in areas which are doing very well economically,</p>
<p> it is very important that we understand that there are some of our fellow</p>
<p> Australians who through no fault of their own, are missing out on the</p>
<p> benefits of generic national economic strengths. It's also been rewarding</p>
<p> for me because, and instructive, because it has reminded me that there</p>
<p> are many parts of regional Australia that are doing very well.</p>
<p>I was in Port Lincoln in South Australia at the weekend and I saw for</p>
<p> the first time in some detail the marvellous tuna industry which is bringing</p>
<p> enormous export income to that part of Australia. But the next day I went</p>
<p> to Quorne in the Flinders Ranges area, a rural community that is almost</p>
<p> a metaphor for the challenges that many parts of the bush face at the</p>
<p> present time. A district heavily dependent on the wool industry, facing</p>
<p> the twin vice, I suppose, of a fairly severe drought in that part of South</p>
<p> Australia as well as low commodity prices. And then I went to Bourke,</p>
<p> a very famous town in Australian history, and Australian folklore, a town</p>
<p> that has been racked by very unhappy relations between aborigines and</p>
<p> other Australians over the years, but I found a community willing to work</p>
<p> together in all its parts to face that problem and also a community that</p>
<p> had the opportunity to embrace a very strong cotton industry over the</p>
<p> last ten or fifteen years which had provided a tremendous economic stimulus.</p>
<p>So, it is a rewarding interesting experience because it drives home to</p>
<p> me the genuine despair of some people and a legitimate and understandable</p>
<p> despair, but it is also a reminder that everything is different according</p>
<p> to where you are. And that of course is something that Larry understands</p>
<p> very well in this electorate. Richmond of course is a very varied electorate,</p>
<p> it is a combination of what you might call some elements of the old rural,</p>
<p> it's got very strong service industries based on tourism, it's got very</p>
<p> significant levels of unemployment, it has people who are broadly described</p>
<p> as in some ways committed to an alternative lifestyle but all part of</p>
<p> the community. So it does have particular challenges. And speaking as</p>
<p> I know I am to a lot of people who share Larry's and my commitment to</p>
<p> the Coalition's success I know that it does contain its measure of political</p>
<p> challenges.</p>
<p>Larry is right, we are living in an environment where it is fair to say</p>
<p> that Australia is a stronger, more confident country than what it was</p>
<p> just on four years ago. We were able to stare down the worst of the Asian</p>
<p> economic downturn with virtually no impact at all. We've seen significant</p>
<p> reductions in unemployment, we have much, much lower interest rates now</p>
<p> than was the case four years ago. We have very low inflation. we have</p>
<p> strong levels of business investment. We've embraced some very fundamental</p>
<p> economic changes and most importantly on that front of all, on the 1st</p>
<p> of July we are going to see the introduction of a new taxation system.</p>
<p>And I don't underestimate for a moment just how major that change is,</p>
<p> but nor do I for a moment, concede to anybody that it is other than a</p>
<p> hugely beneficial change for the entire Australian economy. And it is</p>
<p> very important that all of us see tax reform and the new tax system as</p>
<p> being exactly that. We had a description for it a couple of years ago,</p>
<p> we said not a new tax, a new tax system. And it is very important that</p>
<p> we don't look at it in its segmented areas. It is very easy to run a scare</p>
<p> campaign on the application of the goods and services tax to an individual</p>
<p> item. I can in isolation mount an argument for having no goods and services</p>
<p> tax on any item you name. I can in isolation indeed mount an argument</p>
<p> for having no taxation at all. And sure, hooray somebody says and I understand</p>
<p> that.</p>
<p>And in some kind of utopian concept you might want to argue for that,</p>
<p> but we live in a real world. We live in a society, I think that fundamentally</p>
<p> believes that there is a limited, but none the less important and strategic</p>
<p> role for the government. The faith of the Liberal and National Parties</p>
<p> is built on a belief that people doing their best with as little government</p>
<p> intervention as possible, as lower levels of taxation as possible, that</p>
<p> that is the best kind of society. We believe in people being given the</p>
<p> encouragement to get out and make their own way, to build their own fortunes,</p>
<p> to start with nothing and to build it up through working hard and hopefully</p>
<p> leave it to the next generation.</p>
<p>Now that is the kind of society that we generally believe in. But we</p>
<p> also as a community believe that there have got to be some basic services.</p>
<p> We are not a society that wants to see people starving in the streets.</p>
<p> We are a society that believes that the government has some social responsibilities.</p>
<p> To provide a decent social security safety net. And I have certainly found</p>
<p> since I have moved around the Australian community that the concerns that</p>
<p> people have in the areas that are doing it hard, are concerns about very</p>
<p> basic things. People who live in the outback want the same access to medical</p>
<p> practitioners as you and I have. They want some basic services from the</p>
<p> state governments, as well as from the commonwealth government. They want</p>
<p> to share in the information technology revolution, they don't want an</p>
<p> Australian society where you have haves in the cities and the coastal</p>
<p> areas in information technology and have-nots in the more remote parts</p>
<p> of the country. So we have to achieve a balance.</p>
<p>And one of the reasons we have decided to reform the Australian taxation</p>
<p> system is that it will provide, because the GST revenue is going to the</p>
<p> states, it will provide them with a greater capacity to deal with the</p>
<p> fundamental responsibilities and services which under our federal system</p>
<p> are the responsibilities of state governments. For years and years and</p>
<p> years, people have argued that we needed to reform commonwealth/state</p>
<p> financial relations. For years, people have argued, particularly state</p>
<p> premiers, of all political persuasions, whether it has been Charlie Court</p>
<p> or Joh Bjelke-Petersen or Henry Bolte or Neville Wran, or any of them,</p>
<p> all have said the same thing. We need a reform of commonwealth/state financial</p>
<p> relations. Well the GST will deliver that. It will deliver the single</p>
<p> greatest reform to commonwealth/state relations since World War II.</p>
<p>But most importantly for people in the regions, and most particularly</p>
<p> for those in the regions that live long distances from the major population</p>
<p> centres, taxation reform will mean cheaper fuel and cheaper business operating</p>
<p> costs. The significant reductions in the cost of diesel fuel as a result</p>
<p> of the introduction of the new taxation system will be of enormous benefit</p>
<p> for people who live in rural Australia. So I want all of you ladies and</p>
<p> gentlemen so see the new taxation system for what it is. It is a bold,</p>
<p> fundamental embrace of a new way of structuring taxation in this country.</p>
<p> It will produce cheaper fuel, cheaper exports, lower business costs, a</p>
<p> $12 billion cut in personal income tax with 80% of Australian taxpayers</p>
<p> on a top marginal rate of no more than thirty cents in the dollar. It</p>
<p> will provide compensatory benefits by way of increased pensions and allowances</p>
<p> for retired people and self-funded retirees. The business tax section</p>
<p> will almost halve capital gains tax and it will lower the corporate tax</p>
<p> rate from thirty-six cents in the dollar to thirty cents. Now they are</p>
<p> the positives. And it will also very importantly replace entirely the</p>
<p> existing wholesale sales tax, with in theory seven rates of tax, with</p>
<p> a single rate goods and services tax. And it will also over time as GST</p>
<p> revenues build enable the states in relation to the financial institutions</p>
<p> duty to abolish it almost immediately and subsequently the bank account</p>
<p> debits tax and a variety of state stamp duties.</p>
<p>Now it is a very big reform and there are going to be a lot of scares,</p>
<p> there will be a scare a day, and the tabloid press won't be reluctant</p>
<p> to run some of those scares. They will run the negatives. And we will</p>
<p> need to reply. And we are going to have a very vigorous and active five</p>
<p> or six months. But it is a fight worth having and it is a cause worth</p>
<p> fighting for, because in the end this country is going is going to have</p>
<p> a more competitive taxation system. In the end you will be able to look</p>
<p> back and say we are glad they went the extra miles, we're glad that Howard</p>
<p> and Anthony were prepared to get out there and fight for the cause of</p>
<p> taxation reform.</p>
<p>I have believed in fundamentally reforming Australia's taxation system</p>
<p> now for more than twenty years. And there have been various attempts over</p>
<p> the years to do something about it. I am not doing it because of some</p>
<p> blind ideological commitment. I am not doing it as some kind of easy political</p>
<p> relaxation, because it's not. It certainly isn't, it is anything but comfortable</p>
<p> and relaxing on occasions if I can borrow a phrase that somebody once</p>
<p> used. But what I am doing it for is because I believe deep down that we</p>
<p> need these kind of reforms, and I believe that people are elected to high</p>
<p> office in this country to do something positive and if you're not willing</p>
<p> to do something positive you might as well get out of the way and let</p>
<p> somebody else have a go. And we live in a political environment where</p>
<p> the public expects their governments and their leaders to deliver outcomes</p>
<p> and to deliver results.</p>
<p>We're no longer as tribal about our politics. There are more and</p>
<p> more people who float around in the middle. There are more and more people</p>
<p> who are easily attracted by peripheral people who offer magic solutions</p>
<p> only to be revealed as having feet of clay in a fairly short period of</p>
<p> time. What people want are governments that are prepared to embrace problems</p>
<p> and to adopt policies that are going to bring about fundamental change.</p>
<p>And I know as somebody who, in different ways, has had something to do</p>
<p> over the last 20 odd years with the intense debate about economic policy</p>
<p> in this country. I've known for a long time that we needed to do</p>
<p> basically about four or five things to make our economy more internationally</p>
<p> competitive. We needed to open up our exchange rate, we needed to have</p>
<p> a deregulated financial system. We needed to get our budget in order to</p>
<p> get it back into surplus and out of deficit. We needed to do something</p>
<p> about our arthritic industrial relations system. We needed, in my view,</p>
<p> to get the government out of running businesses that it's no good</p>
<p> at running and I'll come to Telstra in a moment as I'm sure</p>
<p> you'd be disappointed if I didn't mention it.</p>
<p>And we also and very importantly needed to do something about our taxation</p>
<p> system. Now in different ways in various stages all of those things have</p>
<p> been tackled and one of the reasons Australia was able to lick the Asian</p>
<p> economic downturn, in fact the overwhelming reason was that our economic</p>
<p> position was strong. If we'd still been in deficit, if we hadn't</p>
<p> shown the rest of the world that we were prepared to embrace economic</p>
<p> reform that global economy in which we now live would have punished us</p>
<p> very severely and I wouldn't have believed that 18 months ago that</p>
<p> we could have done as well in the face of that Asian downturn. And I'm</p>
<p> so pleased that we took the decisions we did in 1996 to get the budget</p>
<p> into shape. Some of those decisions made us unpopular. Some of them made</p>
<p> us unpopular in areas of regional Australia. I know that but in the long</p>
<p> run we delivered a much greater benefit and that was that we were able</p>
<p> to essentially protect and waterproof this country against that very severe</p>
<p> economic downturn.</p>
<p>But you can never stop this process. We have to keep going and if we</p>
<p> are to protect ourselves against the next adverse international circumstance</p>
<p> when it comes along, and it will come along at some stage, we need to</p>
<p> have completed the next round of reform and that means making this country</p>
<p> more effective as far as its taxation system is concerned.</p>
<p>So I believe in taxation reform because it will make Australia stronger</p>
<p> and better economically. I believe it will improve our international competitiveness.</p>
<p> I believe it's a fairer system. I believe once it's been introduced</p>
<p> and fully understood, people will find it a less complicated system than</p>
<p> the existing arrangement and that is why I ask all of you to go with us.</p>
<p> We'll go through some difficult times politically over the next few</p>
<p> months on this issue. There'll be plenty of scares but keep our eye</p>
<p> firmly fixed on the long term aim and that is to give this country a comprehensively</p>
<p> better and comprehensively new taxation system.</p>
<p>One of the things that I mentioned, talking about the sort of things</p>
<p> that were needed to make this country more competitive, was to get the</p>
<p> Government out of running those things that private enterprise is better</p>
<p> at running. And I mentioned Telstra. I know not everybody in the community</p>
<p> including a number of people who support the Coalition are totally convinced</p>
<p> about the desirability of the full privatisation of Telstra. Let me tell</p>
<p> you why it's government policy. Let me remind you that that policy</p>
<p> says that we won't proceed to the full privatisation of Telstra unless</p>
<p> we're satisfied that the community service obligations of Telstra</p>
<p> are being fully met. It's a condition of moving to the sale of the</p>
<p> rest of Telstra that there be a satisfactory inquiry carried out into</p>
<p> those community service obligations. But I believe and I hope that the</p>
<p> Australian community will agree with me that as time goes by it will be</p>
<p> increasingly absurd and inappropriate for this country to invest tens</p>
<p> of billions of dollars in a telecommunications company when that money</p>
<p> could be alternatively invested in other forms of public expenditure or</p>
<p> public investment because the ownership of Telstra represents a public</p>
<p> sector investment by the Australian tax payer.</p>
<p>It's a question of making a choice. Do we think it's better</p>
<p> to have tens of billions of dollars tied up in a telecommunications company</p>
<p> or would we rather see those tens of billions of dollars used to pay off</p>
<p> part of our national debt. We've paid off a lot of it but if we were</p>
<p> able to sell the rest of Telstra we could make the Commonwealth free of</p>
<p> net debt by about the year 2003 and that's only three years away</p>
<p> from now. And we'd have something left over as well, quite a large</p>
<p> amount left over. And wouldn't it be better to see what was left</p>
<p> over, invested for example in accelerated commitment to infrastructure.</p>
<p> Wouldn't it be better to see that money invested in another way.</p>
<p> Isn't there a better way of investing billions of dollars of public</p>
<p> money than tying it up in a telecommunications company and in the process</p>
<p> raising all sorts of difficult issues when for example you have a telecommunications</p>
<p> company now which is owned just over 50% by the Government and it might</p>
<p> want to invest in say a media asset and that raises questions as to whether</p>
<p> it's appropriate for the Government to have an investment in another</p>
<p> media asset.</p>
<p>As time goes by, I believe it will be increasingly inappropriate for</p>
<p> the Government to own just over 50% and it will be increasingly desirable</p>
<p> and in the national interest that we should invest that additional money</p>
<p> in other forms of public investment including public investment in infrastructure</p>
<p> in regional Australia. That is not to say that we won't continue</p>
<p> to commit significant resources to infrastructure in the regions but it</p>
<p> means that if we were able to sell Telstra, we would be able to accelerate</p>
<p> and increase the level of commitment to infrastructure in different parts</p>
<p> of the country.</p>
<p>Well ladies and gentleman, can I just finish by saying this. The Government</p>
<p> is about more of course than economics. It is also about the kind of country</p>
<p> we have. It's about the kind of society we seek to build. Larry mentioned</p>
<p> East Timor, he mentioned the way in which I think we were able to demonstrate</p>
<p> the historic commitment of Australia for standing up for what was right,</p>
<p> not only in our own region but also around the world.</p>
<p>One of the things of which I am very proud that the Government has been</p>
<p> able to do and I pay tribute in particular to the work that Alexander</p>
<p> Downer has done as Foreign Minister has been the way in which we have</p>
<p> been able to rebalance our foreign relations. When I came to the Office</p>
<p> of Prime Minister, I felt as though I had inherited a situation where</p>
<p> my predecessor in the Government of this country saw our relations as</p>
<p> being exclusively and totally involved in the Asia Pacific Region. The</p>
<p> Asian Pacific Region is the most important region to us, is now and will</p>
<p> always be but there's more to our relations than our own region.</p>
<p> We are in every way as a country a citizen of the world and we have important</p>
<p> relations in Europe. We have important relations with the United States</p>
<p> and I think we've been able to rebalance those relations. We've</p>
<p> been able to play a very strong role in our own region and we've</p>
<p> been able to do that because we've been economically strong and because</p>
<p> we've been able to argue very very strongly for the right things</p>
<p> to be done in our region.</p>
<p>But it is important to see the Government in dimensions beyond what it's</p>
<p> achieved on the economic front and Larry was kind enough to mention many</p>
<p> of those things. I think also our health reforms and I am delighted to</p>
<p> know incidentally that as a result of the introduction of the tax rebate</p>
<p> and the lifetime health cover proposals which you are seeing advertised</p>
<p> on television at the present time with the use of those umbrellas. I've</p>
<p> very happy to report that some of the major health funds in Australia</p>
<p> this year have announced that they are not going to increase their insurance</p>
<p> premiums. Some of the major funds to date, at least 30% or more of Australians</p>
<p> who have private health insurance will not only have the benefit of the</p>
<p> tax refund but largely as a result of that they won't see any increase</p>
<p> in their private health insurance premiums over the next 12 months and</p>
<p> that is a direct result of the determination of this Government to preserve</p>
<p> the private component of the health insurance in this country. We're</p>
<p> not a government that believes that health should be totally a public</p>
<p> monopoly but we are a government that believes that the supplementation</p>
<p> of the public sector by the private is very important.</p>
<p>Ladies and gentleman I am delighted to be in Larry's electorate.</p>
<p> He's frank enough to know and I'm realistic enough to agree</p>
<p> with him, this is a tough seat. It has been made a bit more marginal by</p>
<p> the redistribution. He's been a terrific Member. He's an extremely</p>
<p> able and respected Minister. He's taken to his responsibilities as</p>
<p> Minister over the last 12 months in a very effective and energetic fashion</p>
<p> and I really do admire him greatly for that. I admire the work he did</p>
<p> first as a Parliamentary Secretary and more recently since the changes</p>
<p> following Tim Fischer's retirement as Minister for Community Services.</p>
<p>Can I say because this is a Coalition dinner and I have been all of my</p>
<p> political life a strong believer in the Coalition how much I enjoy working</p>
<p> in harmony with John Anderson who took over as Deputy Prime Minister from</p>
<p> Tim. Tim did a tremendous job, he lead the National Party through some</p>
<p> difficult times, he kept the faith he supported loyally the decisions</p>
<p> that we took as a government and John has done exactly the same thing.</p>
<p> He's a man I admire and respect and trust totally. He brings great</p>
<p> integrity, great intelligence and great decency to his responsibilities.</p>
<p>The National Party is well served in the Federal Parliament with its</p>
<p> younger Deputy Prime Minister and its younger Ministers like Larry Anthony.</p>
<p> It's a strong Coalition. And all of us know from past experience</p>
<p> that the great years of the Liberal Party and the National Party have</p>
<p> been when they've worked together. The Menzies / Fadden, the Menzies</p>
<p> / McKewen, the Fraser / Anthony and now the Howard / Fischer, the Howard</p>
<p> / Anderson years. They're the great years of the Coalition. Division</p>
<p> is death, unity builds success, encourages and inspires loyalty and gathers</p>
<p> support.</p>
<p>I don't take the next election for granted. Every election is hard</p>
<p> going in this country. You can't predict anything any more. Look</p>
<p> at Victoria. I will regard the next election whenever it occurs and it</p>
<p> is due at the end of next year and I'm in no hurry to make it any</p>
<p> earlier let me assure you of that. I think things are going very well</p>
<p> at the present time and I am a great believer in people getting, great</p>
<p> believer in people getting full value. Three years is pretty short and</p>
<p> there's no reason to make it even shorter but it will be a tough</p>
<p> fight. The nature of the electoral process in this country has changed.</p>
<p> People expect good governments and they have a right to expect good governments</p>
<p> and understandably they look for new hope, new definitions, new proposals,</p>
<p> new ideas. But if we work together we can make it, we need your support,</p>
<p> we thank you for the support you've given over the years. You've</p>
<p> got a terrific young energetic Local Member whose got a great future in</p>
<p> Federal politics as your representative. Give him all the support you</p>
<p> can over the next couple of years.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
