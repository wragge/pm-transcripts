    <content><![CDATA[<p>The death, in such tragic circumstances, of Diana, Princess of Wales, in Paris earlier today will shock and sadden Australians.</p>
<p>It has ended at a very young age the life of a person who had a particular facination for people around the world.</p>
<p>I know that many Australians will remember with affection the visits paid to this country by the Princess over the years.</p>
<p>Her last visit was in 1996 in aid of the esteemed Victor Chang Memorial Foundation.</p>
<p>On behalf of the Australian Government I express my deepeest sympathy to her two sons, Prince William and Prince Harry, and to other members of the Royal Family.</p>
<p>31 August 1997</p>
