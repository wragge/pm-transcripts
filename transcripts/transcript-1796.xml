STAT3ME-IFNT BY THE PRIME MINISTER,<br />
THE RT. HON. JOHN GORTON, MP. IN<br />
THE HOULSE OF REPRESENTATIVES ON<br />
13 MARCH 1968<br />
PAYMENT TO CAPTAIN ROBERTSON<br />
In conjunction with its consideration of the Report of the<br />
Royal Commissioners, the Government has given much thought to the<br />
position of Captain R. J. Robertson. On his resignation in 1964, Captain<br />
Robertson was ineligible for any pension from the Defence Forces<br />
Retirements Benefits Fund and received only the repayment of his own<br />
contributions to the Fund. As Honourable Members are well aware, no<br />
Service Board, either in 1964 or now, has authority to grant pensions.<br />
Provision for pensions In all three Services is made in the Defence Forces<br />
Retirement Benefits Act 1948-66. The Naval Board in 1964 could only<br />
ensure that Captain Robertson was aware of the consequences of his<br />
decision to resign and this It did.<br />
No officer of the Armed Services Is entitled to resign<br />
and claim his f ull pensilon merely because he is dis satisfied With a<br />
particular appointment. Howev--r, it Is widely felt that Captain Robertson<br />
resigned as and when he did because of certain critical findings made by<br />
the first Royal Commission and that, In the special circumstances of this<br />
case, the second Royal Commission having accepted a different<br />
reconstruction of the accident and having said that Captain Robertson was<br />
free of any criticism, the Government should take some action recognising<br />
the changed position. The Government has now decided that a payment should:<br />
Sbe made to Captain Robertson * and In reaching this conclusion necessarily<br />
had to take a broad view. Whilst paying some regard to the pension which<br />
Captain Robertson might have received In certain eventualities If he had<br />
not resigned as and when he did, the Government did not regard this as the<br />
sole criterion. Other factors also had to be taken Into consideration.<br />
' Having considered various ways In which this payment might be made the<br />
Government decided that payment of a lump sum, as an act of grace, would<br />
be the most appropriate and the Government has now decided to authorise<br />
payment accordingly of 000 In reaching this decision, the Government<br />
took Into account advice from the Commissioner of Taxation that he would<br />
regard payment made in the form proposed as being free of income tax. </p>
