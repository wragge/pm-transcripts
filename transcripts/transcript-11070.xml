<p> competition policy, Senator Harradine, 25th anniversary</p>
<p>E&amp;OE................................................................................................</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Well, thank you very much for joining us today on the Country Hour</p>
<p> and it's nice to see you in Longreach.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, it's very good to be here. It's a great occasion.</p>
<p> It's the 20th anniversary of the formation of the</p>
<p> National Farmers' Federation and I thought it would be entirely</p>
<p> appropriate to bring the Federal Cabinet to Longreach. This is the</p>
<p> first time, to my knowledge, that Federal Cabinet has ever met in</p>
<p> Longreach. We, since we've been in government, have made a habit</p>
<p> of going around the country, of having regional Cabinet meetings,</p>
<p> meeting on a regular basis outside of Canbera. We have Cabinet meetings,</p>
<p> obviously, from time to time in Sydney and Melbourne but we've</p>
<p> made a real thing of going to other parts of the country. And this</p>
<p> is very much of a peace with that. And I'm delighted to be back</p>
<p> here. I was here a couple of years ago speaking to a meeting on native</p>
<p> title and that really began the process which ended up with a successful</p>
<p> resolution of the native title issue. So I've got a very positive</p>
<p> recollection of my last visit to Longreach.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Well, that is interesting and, indeed, the visit is somewhat timely</p>
<p> given the National Farmers' Federation's role in pushing</p>
<p> tax reform. How influential will the discussions you have with them</p>
<p> today be in where you go from here?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Oh, very important. The National Farmers' Federation in the 20</p>
<p> years it's existed has always, to its great credit, been in the</p>
<p> forefront of supporting sensible economic policy. The National Farmers'</p>
<p> Federation was one of the first major organisations in this country</p>
<p> to support the deregulation of the financial system and the floating</p>
<p> of the dollar and a more intelligent approach and a more worldly approach</p>
<p> to financial matters. The National Farmers' Federation has been</p>
<p> a strong advocate of the interests, the trading interests of agriculture</p>
<p> abroad. And they, of course, have been very strong supporters of tax</p>
<p> reform. And I welcome that and I thank the NFF for the consistent</p>
<p> support that it's given to tax reform. And they've done</p>
<p> that because tax reform is vital for farmers. It really is because</p>
<p> tax reform is all about reducing costs, the costs of doing business,</p>
<p> the costs of exporting, the costs of fuel. People tend to look at</p>
<p> tax reform just in one narrow area and that is the imposition of a</p>
<p> GST. In reality there's a lot more to that. It's an aggregate</p>
<p> approach which results in the removal of a lot of business costs and</p>
<p> their removal will make our farmers, in particular, more competitive</p>
<p> on world markets.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>So will you look for their support for a compromise position today?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, the farmers, quite understandably, don't want changes made</p>
<p> to the package that will disadvantage them. And I understand that</p>
<p> and I sympathise with that and I'm with them on that. We're</p>
<p> not going to reach some understanding that's going to disadvantage</p>
<p> Australian farmers. They're disadvantaged enough. They carry</p>
<p> the burden of corrupt world markets. They are not heavily subsidised.</p>
<p> Many of them are not subsidised at all like American and Japanese</p>
<p> and European farmers. And they're carrying a heavy enough load</p>
<p> as it is and I'm certainly not going to reach any understanding</p>
<p> or give any undertakings to anybody that is going to lead to them</p>
<p> being disadvantaged under any tax package.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>You'd have to accept now, though, that a compromise position</p>
<p> must be reached, unless you want to go to an election which I presume</p>
<p> you don't.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, what I'm doing at the moment is showing a willingness to</p>
<p> talk to the Australian Democrats. We've had an election on this</p>
<p> issue and we won that election. People seem to lose sight of that</p>
<p> fact. We disclosed every last detail to the Australian people. We</p>
<p> took the risk. We won that election. There is no justification on</p>
<p> ordinary principles for there to be another election. I don't</p>
<p> think the Australian public wants to have another vote on something</p>
<p> they resolved in October of last year. I certainly don't. I think</p>
<p> the Australian public is a bit tired of the situation whereby you</p>
<p> elect a government on a platform and then that government's prevented</p>
<p> from implementing that platform. But look, I'm not going to do</p>
<p> more than state the obvious and that is we're going to have a</p>
<p> discussion with the Australian Democrats. We are a long way apart.</p>
<p> If they mean what they say then we're a very long way apart.</p>
<p> But we'll have a talk to them. I think it's very important</p>
<p> that that discussion take place and we'll see what happens out</p>
<p> of that.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>You mentioned public support for the GST. Polls in the Sydney Morning</p>
<p> Herald and The Age today, in fact, showing that opposition</p>
<p> to it is up four points in a month. That's seventeen points since</p>
<p> you released your tax package. Surely that must concern you at a fairly</p>
<p> critical time.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, that doesn't overly concern me because, well, I don't</p>
<p> know quite how the question was phrased but even if were phrased in</p>
<p> the most benign way imaginable, over the last few months there's</p>
<p> been a total concentration on the less positive sides of the package,</p>
<p> on the GST aspect. And inevitably there would have been an erosion</p>
<p> of public support because the whole debate has been about compensation</p>
<p> and the adequacy and very little focus on the fact that people get</p>
<p> large personal tax cuts and fuel costs are reduced, export costs are</p>
<p> reduced and the country's made more competitive. In a broader,</p>
<p> fuller debate, as we had in the election last year, then the national</p>
<p> interest benefits, the national benefit, the benefit for Australia,</p>
<p> what's in it for the whole country, what's in it for individual</p>
<p> taxpayers, that would assert itself a lot more and I'm quite</p>
<p> certain public attitudes could well be different.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>But Prime Minister, in the same poll the ALP's ahead for the</p>
<p> first time since the election, again a concern at a critical time.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, that's not been echoed in the other poll but, look, I think</p>
<p> taking too much notice of polls only seven months after an election</p>
<p> is a bit dumb. I certainly don't take much notice of polls when</p>
<p> you're only seven months after the last election.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Not when a double dissolution's looming, though. It must be...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I haven't indicated what we're going to do. But look,</p>
<p> the things that matter are how people actually vote in elections and</p>
<p> I've been in politics a very long time now and I've seen</p>
<p> polls come and go. I've seen people who rely on polls come and</p>
<p> go too. In the end, what really matters is the judgements you make</p>
<p> of the attitudes of people after a campaign and your capacity to argue</p>
<p> something in the national interest. I mean, we need tax reform and</p>
<p> you go into public life to do things that are right for the country.</p>
<p> You don't go into public life to occupy a high office indefinitely</p>
<p> irrespective of what you do with that responsibility. And I've</p>
<p> always seen public service about doing good things for the country</p>
<p> and standing up for something that I believe in and arguing for it</p>
<p> and fighting for it. Many of the things that I've argued for</p>
<p> in my life have come second in opinion polls all the time until they're</p>
<p> finally implemented and then I've lived to fight another battle.</p>
<p> So, tax reform is really no different from that.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Can you talk about the possibilities for compromise going first...?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, not really, no. There's really no point. I'm not signalling</p>
<p> any willingness to compromise. All I'm doing is signalling a</p>
<p> willingness, along with the Treasurer, to talk to the leader of the</p>
<p> Australian Democrats and to her spokesman about the issue. People</p>
<p> would be wrong to assume that I'm going into that meeting resolved</p>
<p> to compromise. I just want to find out exactly what the Democrats</p>
<p> have got to say.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Surely you don't have any choice though.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, we'll just see what comes out of the meeting.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>On the National Farmers' Federation front, they've stated</p>
<p> already unequivocally this week that they won't budge on the</p>
<p> diesel fuel package. Can you guarantee that that package will stand</p>
<p> as it is?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I've already said to you a few moments ago that I can assure</p>
<p> the farmers of Australia that anything we do in the tax package will</p>
<p> not disadvantage them compared to where they are now.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>So is that a guarantee that you won't play with that package</p>
<p> or you may tinker a bit?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>It's a guarantee that the farmers will be, in any arrangements,</p>
<p> be treated just as well as they are under the present package.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>And that may result in some changes to the package?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No look, really, you can make a commentary as to what you think but</p>
<p> I'm not going to answer any hypothetical questions about what</p>
<p> are hypothetical changes. People should understand that I'm not</p>
<p> going to that meeting resolved to compromise. I'm going to that</p>
<p> meeting to find out exactly where the Democrats stand.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>What if the National Farmers' Federation come out today, as I</p>
<p> believe they will, and say that they're prepared to move on the</p>
<p> food issue within the GST. Now, they've been one major group</p>
<p> saying that shouldn't be a point of compromise. Would that give</p>
<p> you some room to...?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I'll be interested to hear anything they've got to</p>
<p> but I'm not going to react to it either today, if it happens,</p>
<p> or hypothetically now against the possibility that it might happen.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, can I ask you to answer some more general questions from</p>
<p> rural Australia? First up we go to the Northern Territory.</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>Steve Burns, the Northern Territory Manager for the Royal Flying Doctor</p>
<p> Service based in Alice Springs. In the budget, Prime Minister, $43.1</p>
<p> million has been set aside over the next four years for general practitioner</p>
<p> retention grants. The RFDS currently has 40 doctors working remote</p>
<p> area Australia. Should they not also qualify for these retention monies?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, that is a very good question. I don't off-hand know the</p>
<p> answer to that. Can I examine that and I'll get the details of</p>
<p> it from the station and I'll come back to you?</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Certainly.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I mean, could I say, your organisation just does an incredible job.</p>
<p> Off-hand I'm not aware of any other support that you may receive.</p>
<p> Let me investigate that. I understand the point you're making.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Let's move to South Australia.</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>Rob [inaudible] from Kingston southeast South Australia. Mr Howard,</p>
<p> I'd like to ask you why the Government is pushing the producers</p>
<p> towards privatisation of all the bodies that we've got like the</p>
<p> Wheat Board and the Wool Corporation and the like so we end up with</p>
<p> a heap of private operators who are going to be bidding against themselves</p>
<p> which will come to our disadvantage, I believe, especially with the</p>
<p> number that will fold up and leave us with debts as has happened in</p>
<p> this local industry?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I don't have as gloomy a view as you apparently have about</p>
<p> the consequences of privatisation. When you say the Government is</p>
<p> pushing you towards it there are a lot of growers and a lot of producers</p>
<p> who support privatisation and I remember the debate that was conducted</p>
<p> more than 10 years ago about the domestic monopoly in the wheat industry.</p>
<p> There was a lot of support amongst growers for ending that and for</p>
<p> opening the thing up. We do, of course, retain a single desk approach</p>
<p> for export. I'm not convinced, nor as I understand the view of</p>
<p> many growers, are they convinced for that privatisation, in the long</p>
<p> run, won't be beneficial.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>And Mr Howard moving finally to the west.</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>Marie Dilly, dairy farmer from Coolup, Western Australia. As I go</p>
<p> around Farmers' Federation meetings the one question I'm</p>
<p> consistently asked is how is national competition policy going to</p>
<p> benefit me and my business as a primary producer. I find that a very</p>
<p> difficult question to answer so, therefore, Mr Howard, could you please</p>
<p> tell us how national competition policy is going to benefit not only</p>
<p> the primary producers of this country but the communities with which</p>
<p> they live?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, competition, generally, has already brought enormous benefits</p>
<p> to farmers. One of the reasons you have lower interest rates now is</p>
<p> that there's more competition. Not as much as I would like and</p>
<p> the major banks still have a long way to go to deliver more competition</p>
<p> in the small business area but there has been a huge improvement in</p>
<p> other areas. We've had a review of national competition policy.</p>
<p> And I think that review is being released today or yesterday and we</p>
<p> are inviting comments. I know it's a hot issue in the bush. The</p>
<p> aim of competition policy, of national competition policy is to reduce</p>
<p> costs by achieving greater efficiencies. Now, that's the aim</p>
<p> of it. And if you can reduce costs through greater efficiencies then</p>
<p> everybody benefits. There's not much doubt, using another generic</p>
<p> example, there's not much doubt that greater competition in the</p>
<p> telecommunications area has produced a reduction in costs, not as</p>
<p> much, once again, as people in the bush would like or people in the</p>
<p> bush are entitled to have but it has produced significant advantages.</p>
<p> I would hope that the community will respond in a constructive way</p>
<p> to this examination of national competition policy. And we'll</p>
<p> look at the results of people's responses to that inquiry.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, tax reform was the major election policy plank offered</p>
<p> to the bush, along with the social bonus package that goes along with</p>
<p> the further 16 per cent sale of Telstra. Now, Brian Harradine's</p>
<p> definitely against one and still possibly against the other. If neither</p>
<p> of those things happen, where does it leave your bush policies, where</p>
<p> does it leave country people?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, it doesn't affect, in any way, the fact that we've</p>
<p> delivered the lowest interest rates in 30 years and the lowest levels</p>
<p> of inflation in a long time. It doesn't alter the benefits that</p>
<p> have come to the bush through the Natural Heritage Trust which was</p>
<p> funded out of the sale of 30 per cent of Telstra. It doesn't</p>
<p> alter the fact that we're putting money into GP attention. It</p>
<p> doesn't alter the fact that we're establishing regional</p>
<p> health centres. It doesn't alter the fact that we've put</p>
<p> over $500 million into the advancing agriculture scheme. There are</p>
<p> a large number of policies that are outside both taxation reform and</p>
<p> the funding of particular initiatives out of the sale of another 16</p>
<p> per cent of Telstra. But taxation reform, of course, is a very important</p>
<p> thing not only for the bush but for the whole country. The bush has</p>
<p> also benefited from industrial relations reform and despite all the</p>
<p> sound and fury against the Government and against Patricks at the</p>
<p> time of the waterfront despite, the Australian waterfront has changed</p>
<p> permanently as a result of the changes the Government supported last</p>
<p> year. And those changes will deliver long-term benefits to the bush</p>
<p> as well.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Do you still think you can get the tax package through today, these</p>
<p> few days after Mr Harradine's said no?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, you know as well as I do that his decision to vote against it</p>
<p> has made things more difficult. I never took for granted that he would</p>
<p> support it, never. If you examine carefully what I've said over</p>
<p> past weeks you will notice that I've always said I was hopeful</p>
<p> rather than over-confident. I knew that he had reservations but I</p>
<p> also knew that before the election he'd acknowledged that the</p>
<p> Government was going to the public with full details of the policy</p>
<p> and we had rather hoped that he would give a greater weight to the</p>
<p> mandate received than the reservations he had. Now, we'll just</p>
<p> see how things unfold. Nothing has altered the fact that we need tax</p>
<p> reform and we intend to continue to argue the case for it because,</p>
<p> as I said a few moments ago, you go into public life to do positive</p>
<p> things for the benefit of the country. You don't go into public</p>
<p> life just to cling to office. You go there to do proper things for</p>
<p> the country. And I've always seen it in those terms and the longer</p>
<p> I've stayed the more determined I am to try and achieve some</p>
<p> positive outcomes. Now, we do have the strongest economy in our region.</p>
<p> We've got the best set of economic figures for more than 30 years.</p>
<p> Now, that's been the result of reforms that we undertook a few</p>
<p> years ago. People wrongly imagine that because we're so strong</p>
<p> now we don't need tax reform. That couldn't be more wrong.</p>
<p> If we want to be strong in five years time we should go on reforming</p>
<p> things like our taxation system.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Twenty-five years to the day since your entry to Parliament. What's</p>
<p> the personal cost to you if you don't get this through when that's</p>
<p> been your major agenda?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, it's not a question of personal cost to me. It will be</p>
<p> the cost to the country that matters. Forget about the cost to me.</p>
<p> You see, politics is too trivialised and personalised in this country.</p>
<p> Everything is looked at through the prism of how will it affect him</p>
<p> or her rather than the impact of good policy lost on the nation's</p>
<p> future. And that's what really matters. I've achieved a</p>
<p> lot in 25 years but the thing that really counts is how much more</p>
<p> governments can do to make this a stronger, more competitive nation.</p>
<p> Now, everyone knows that we need tax reform. Mr Beazley knows that</p>
<p> because he supported it in the 80s. My predecessor, Mr Keating, knows</p>
<p> in his heart we need tax reform and so did his predecessor, Mr Hawke.</p>
<p> And we should really stop playing games with the country's future.</p>
<p> And we are game playing at the moment. We all know, as people that</p>
<p> have been in public life for a long time, that reform in this area</p>
<p> is long overdue. I've known that for 20 years. Mr Beazley knows</p>
<p> that. He's presumably an intelligent man. He supported tax reform</p>
<p> when he was a senior member in the Hawke Government. He knows deep</p>
<p> down that we can't go on forever with our present tax system.</p>
<p> I think we should stop playing games with the country's future</p>
<p> because that is what is going on at the moment.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, thank you.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
