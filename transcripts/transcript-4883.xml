PRIME MINISTER'S INTERVIEW FOLLOWING ] AEETING WITH PREMIERS<br />
OF WESTERN AUSTRALIAN AND QUEENSLAND, MELBOURNE, 6 November, 1978<br />
PRIME MINISTER. I think it was a very productive discussion.<br />
yes. I think the statement quite clearly indicates the differing<br />
points of view, but it acknowledges that there needs to be<br />
closer consultation between the Co= monwealth and the States in<br />
relation to these matters. Queensland and Western Australia, and<br />
the Commonwealth are particularly concerned to maximise the<br />
opportunities available to Australia in terms of investment,<br />
resource development. That obviously has consquences for general<br />
activity in Australia, for the strength of our balance of payments,<br />
and if there are differences between governments it doesn't assist<br />
in maximnising the advantages and benefits to Australia.<br />
So, it is important that we approach the forthcoming discussions<br />
at officer level and at Minister level with a view to removing<br />
differences where there.,. are differences and making sure that<br />
we jointly bend our efforts to working for Australia as a whole.<br />
QUESTION: As a simple point thought, the export controls remain?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: The statement makes it perfectly plain that there<br />
will be discussions with the States in relation to it, but pending<br />
the review the guidelines are operative, yes.<br />
QUESTION: compromise on both sides, Mr Fraser?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I think that in the spirit in which we approached<br />
the matter today there is a recognition of a need to get to a<br />
common point of view if that is possible, and I believe that it is<br />
possible. I don't want to preempt what will come out of the<br />
discussions and the negotiations, but I think that the present<br />
Comrmonwealth Government on a number of issuesk and not least oni the<br />
policy in relation to infra-structure borrowing, which was<br />
announced earlier this afternoon, has indicated that it believes<br />
Australia is going to be better advantaged if the Commonwealth<br />
Government anld the State Governments are working in harmony for<br />
common purposes and, it is certainly going to be our objective<br />
to achieve that kind of view and I would be very surprised if it<br />
wasn't the States view also.<br />
QUESTION: But you might have to give some ground in achieving that?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: To get to a position on which all people agree<br />
implies going into a discussion with not a rigid, intractable<br />
and absolute position. If you are going to do that then there is<br />
never going to be agreement.<br />
QUESTION: Would it be that you moved too fast in the past?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: There is no nedd to talk about the past but I think<br />
that what does need emphasising in relation to this is that those<br />
administrative guidelines were issued as guidelines for<br />
discussion, and that was at the time they were issued, for discussion<br />
with the States, for discussion with the companies, and if we<br />
were going to issue them validly as we were for discussion there<br />
was a clear indication that there could be changes that was the<br />
strong implication right from the very outset.<br />
