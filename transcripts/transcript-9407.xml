SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
OPENING OF THE HUNTER ADVANTAGE EXHIBITION<br />
PARLIAMENT HOUSE CANBERRA<br />
7 NOVEMBER 1994<br />
Well, let me say what a real pleasure it is to open the Hunter Advantage Exhibition.<br />
And the timing couldn't be better.<br />
Only this morning I was speaking to the National General Assembly of Local<br />
Governments about the enormous wealth of talent that exists in regional Australia.<br />
And now we have it on full display here with the Hunter region a region I might add<br />
that is one of great beauty and character.<br />
The Hunter is a very old region, one of our oldest, but one which has certainly<br />
rejuvenated itself and now looks to the fu~ ture with great confidence.<br />
I think it's also worth making the point that in the great countries of the world, it's the<br />
regions that define them.<br />
It's the regions, rather than the political boundaries of their states, which give countries<br />
their character.<br />
It's certainly the case for France, Germany and Italy.<br />
In Australia, this is also true, though it's not so well recognised.<br />
But not only does the Hunter give this country character, it is also a region with a<br />
strong export profile, a region that knows what it means to Lead Local and Compete<br />
Global. In fact, the picture of the Hunter today is very impressive indeed. </p>
<p>And it bears a little looking at.<br />
Some of it, of course, is very familiar.<br />
Most Australians will know about the Hunter's coal mines and coal export port one<br />
the locals claim is the largest in the world but one that is certainly the largest in the<br />
southern hemisphere.<br />
Most Australians will be familiar with the Hunter's enormous variety of agriculture.<br />
Most, I imagine, will have quaffed the odd glass of world famous Hunter wine.<br />
And not a few Australians will have caught waves on Newcastle's great surf beaches.<br />
But I suspect far less Australians know about some of the other aspects of the Hunter,<br />
that it has in fact an increasingly diverse industrial profile with significant growth in it's<br />
high value added goods and services.<br />
That's something borne out by this exhibition which includes some of Australia's best<br />
companies. In fact, last Thursday I presented Hunter Valley Rewinds with one of only 12<br />
Australian Quality Awards to be given this year.<br />
The Hunter is also a region with a fine University which is playing its part in the export<br />
drive. It has developed a water purification system, the TUNRA Jetfiote, which is destined<br />
for export markets.<br />
And its Centre for Industrial Control Science has developed a special computer<br />
controller for use in the mining, chemical, engineering and car industries.<br />
This controller which has already generated considerable interest from many<br />
international firms will be chasing a share of what is potentially a multi-billion dollar<br />
export market.<br />
But innovative products are by no means the preserve of the university sector and I<br />
couldn't but help noticing the Medicab, the automotive stretcher, that forms part of this<br />
exhibition. I understand that the Joint House Department has already expressed interest in<br />
purchasing one for use here in the Parliament.<br />
But if the developers want to double their sales here at Parliament House, they midght<br />
do well to give the Leader of the Opposition a call. </p>
<p>Although the way things are going at the moment, I'm not sure whether he should<br />
station it near the House of Reps or the Senate.<br />
I think it's also worth making the point that one of the reasons for the Hunter's success<br />
is that it has a very healthy industrial relations profile that may have something to do<br />
with the fact that the Australian Centre for Best Practice has its head office in<br />
Newcastle.<br />
But I suspect it's got more to do with the fact that the Hunter has developed a detailed<br />
enterprise agreement, one developed between the region's councils and unions, and one<br />
which McKinsey in their regional development study cited as an example of a<br />
sophisticated performance measurement driving changes in behaviour.<br />
Over the years, the Government has sought to tap into the enormous assets of the<br />
Hunter and when necessary to give the region a hand up.<br />
Through the Better Cities Program, we are providing $ 70 million over a four year<br />
period to the Honeysuckle redevelopment, which has already begun to revitalise<br />
Newcastle, providing jobs and attracting private sector investment.<br />
For my part, I should confess some involvement in the decision to set up a tax office in<br />
Newcastle, although I hear a few of the local business people will never forgive me for<br />
that. But whatever assistance might have flowed to the Hunter from the Commonwealth and<br />
State Government over the years, this is little compared to that which has come from<br />
the leadership exercised by those people living and working within the Hunter itself<br />
This theme of leadership is one that I addressed in some detail this morning when I<br />
pointed out that, faced with the choice between $ 2 million and 20 local leaders and<br />
million and no local leaders, regional leaders would opt for the former because local<br />
leadership is something that can't be bought.<br />
In fact, the Hunter has a fine tradition of leadership and one which has been<br />
particularly strong in recent times.<br />
It's leadership that came to the fore in the aftermath of the Newcastle earthquake.<br />
It's leadership that continues today.<br />
And it finds its expression in the many companies that are on display here.<br />
Let me congratulate those who had the initiative to stage this exhibition, particularly<br />
Mrs Jill Wyborn from the Chamber of Commerce and Industry.<br />
Of course, this exhibition complements the other great work that is being done by<br />
many people and organisations right around the Hunter. </p>
<p>I'm thinking here of the contribution of the likes of Dr Margaret Bowman, the former<br />
Chairman of the Hunter Institute of Higher Education who participated in the Regional<br />
Development Taskforce chaired by Bill Kelty.<br />
I'm also thinking of the work done by Rotary as part of the Employ Australia initiative<br />
which has seen more than 2500 vacancies notified to the CES over the past 3 weeks.<br />
With leadership like this, it's difficult not to feel optimistic about the Hunter's future.<br />
And it's something that will be given a huge boost when a Regional Development<br />
Organisation is shortly established in the Hunter.<br />
This Regional Development Organisation will have a major role in harnessing the<br />
enormous leadership reserves in the Hunter and putting into place a strategy for the<br />
region. It is, as you know, one of the major Working Nation initiatives designed to ensure that<br />
regional Australia also participates in the strong economic growth now underway.<br />
I suspect this commercial may have run a little longer than it should have but then there<br />
are so many good things to say about the Hunter.<br />
Perhaps I might leave any further comments to others here.<br />
So let me finish up with my own vote of confidence in the Hunter and my<br />
congratulations to all those associated with the putting together of this fine exhibition.<br />
Thank you. </p>
