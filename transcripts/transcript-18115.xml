<p>Narrator: On the 1st of September the Gillard Government held a Community Cabinet at Yeronga State High School.</p>
<p>Student: Well we are at Yeronga State High School and we are hosting a Community Cabinet meeting with Julia Gillard.</p>
<p>Footage of one-on-one meetings</p>
<p>Narrator: The Community Cabinet provided local residents with an opportunity for one-on- one meetings with the Prime Minister.</p>
<p>Graham Perrett MP: Ladies and gentlemen please make welcome the Prime Minister of Australia, Julia Gillard.</p>
<p>Applause</p>
<p>Prime Minister: I did want to open up by saying to you that we have a lot to be thankful for as a country, a lot to be proud of. We are a peaceful nation, we are a prosperous nation and we've got an economy that is the envy of the world and we very much prize that fair go. And even when nature throws challenges at us, like it did last summer, we pull together and show that Aussie spirit.</p>
<p>It's always best to come and talk to communities face to face and see what's on your mind, so this is your opportunity to put before us the issues that matter to you and we will do the best we can to answer any question that you've got.</p>
<p>Community Member 1: It seems to me at the moment that you're almost on a daily basis on the campaign trail and is this affecting the government's ability to govern the country as a whole?</p>
<p>Prime Minister: What you don't see is those hours and hours and hours spent in meetings and doing paperwork! And maybe just as well cause I'm not sure it would make all that interesting watching!</p>
<p>Community Member 2:  Do you think Prime Minister, that some of the revenue raised through carbon pricing initiatives will be used to assist poor communities overseas?</p>
<p>Prime Minister: We've already detailed that that money is going to be used to assist Australians with the less than a cent in a dollar flow through impact onto costs for things that they buy.</p>
<p>Community Member 3: Will the Federal Government be providing funding to Cross River Rail?</p>
<p>Minister Anthony Albanese MP: That is currently being developed in terms of the planning stage by the Queensland Government.</p>
<p>Prime Minister: Ladies and gentleman thank you very much for coming along tonight. Thank you.</p>
<p>Community Member 4: I'm here to like see them and hear what they have to say.</p>
<p>Community Member 5: It's a wonderful idea, so that they come to see us and we get to talk to them about the things that are really important within the community.</p>
<p>Community Member 6: I really think the reforms that they have done for mental health, her (the Prime Minister) and Nicola Roxon, really make an improvement to our vulnerable people.</p>
<p>Community Member 7: I also got the opportunity to tell what we as students think as well about social justice issues.</p>
<p>Community Member 8: It's my first time to see the Prime Minister face to face. I'm very proud to see that.</p>
<p>Community Member 6 (continuation of comments): It's what democracy is all about.</p>
<p>Footage of the Prime Minister mingling with members of the public, pans of the Public Forum and One-on-One meetings.</p>
<p>Ends with musical interlude</p>
