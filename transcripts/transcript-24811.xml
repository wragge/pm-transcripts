    <content><![CDATA[<p>Today I met with Papua New Guinea’s Prime Minister Peter O’Neill ahead of the Pacific Islands Forum.</p>
<p>This is my third visit to PNG as Prime Minister.</p>
<p>Australians value the bond we share with PNG, forged through history, geography and our enduring links.</p>
<p>We have shared many significant moments, including September 16, 1975 – the day PNG became independent.</p>
<p>To mark this milestone, I am pleased to announce that Australia will provide $25 million over four years to support the upgrade of PNG’s foremost national cultural institution, the PNG National Museum and Art Gallery.</p>
<p>This will ensure that the remarkable building continues to showcase and preserve PNG’s rich cultural heritage.</p>
<p>The Kokoda track is a powerful part of PNG's history. Since 2008, Australia has provided $40 million to maintain and improve the Kokoda track. Today I announce a further $5 million per year over five years to continue this initiative.</p>
<p>This will support the maintenance of the track, improve the quality of life for communities living and working along it, and help protect its natural and cultural resources.</p>
<p>Prime Minister O’Neill and I discussed progress on processing and settlement under the Regional Resettlement Arrangements. I thank PNG for its continued cooperation in this regional solution. Progress has been made and we discussed the importance of moving ahead to settle those found to be refugees.</p>
<p>I congratulate Prime Minister O’Neill for hosting the Forum, which is focused on real reforms that can improve the lives of all people in the Pacific region.</p>
