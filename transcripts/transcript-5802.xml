FJR MEDIA FRIDAY, 30 APRIL 1982<br />
CORAL SEA BALL<br />
It is a very great pleasure to have Mr and Mrs Bush with us<br />
here tonight. I understand that you, Mr Vice-President, have<br />
some familiarity with Australia from a previous visit. But<br />
more particularly you are no stranger to the region in which<br />
we live. For not only were you involved in the Pacific War,<br />
where you won three air medals and the Distinguished Flying<br />
Cross, but in more recent years you were the first incumbent<br />
of the U. S. Office in Peking from 1974 to 1976.<br />
A visit by an American Vice-President is a highly significant<br />
event in itself, but in Australia-America week, the visit of<br />
a Vice-President who was a distinguished and courageous<br />
participant in the Pacific War is particularly appropriate,<br />
particularly significant.<br />
I am delighted that both you and Mrs Bush were able to accept<br />
my invitation and that of the Australia'n-American Association<br />
to visit us now when we commemorate tw'major land-marks in<br />
the close relationship between Australia and the United States.<br />
Our common purpose this evening is to commemorate the Battle<br />
of the Coral Sea, a victory which Australians will always*<br />
remember with profound thankfulness. But we are also celebrating<br />
this week the Thirtieth Anniversary of the Entry into Force of<br />
the ANZUS Treaty, a treaty which remains a cornerstone of the<br />
relationship between our two countries, and which was founded<br />
on our shared experiences in the war in the Pacific.<br />
The significance of the events which took place early in 1942<br />
is beyond the living memory of two-thirds of the Australian<br />
population, yet it has a special meaning for all-of us. I<br />
was just old enough at the time to sense the widespread unease<br />
in Australia in the months between Pearl Harbour and the Battle<br />
of the Coral Sea, but it was only later, and with the benefit of<br />
hindsight, that I be gan to really understand what people hadfelt.<br />
To understand that the fear of invasion and occupation<br />
of Australia had been so real and so widespread. People really<br />
wondered whether to move to the country or whether they would<br />
be safer to stay in the cities. </p>

It is a relationship based on mutual respect, entered into by free<br />
people to prbtect and promote their interests, with none of<br />
the fear seen in Poland, or Czechoslavakia or Hungary, or any<br />
of the other countries of Eastern Europe. We are bound<br />
together by a common belief in freedom and democracy, and<br />
the desire to choose how to live our own lives, principles<br />
which are held to be paramount in free nations.<br />
We all recognise, Mr Vice-President, the enormous efforts<br />
that the United States has made in the interests of world<br />
peace and stability over the last 40 years, for as the largest.<br />
democratic nation, so mucho6fthe burdenof defending freedom<br />
ana democracy has fallen on her shoulders. But while the<br />
United States undoubtedly is the cornerstone of the defence<br />
of freedom throughout the world, this defence is not a<br />
burden that it should bear alone.<br />
I was once asked why Australia was concerned with the great<br />
issues, the relationships between the United States and Europe,<br />
and between the Western Alliance and the Warsaw Pact. And<br />
what right, I was asked, did Australia have to speak on these<br />
issues. We are a nation of fifteen million people and clearly<br />
our physical power is limited as a consequence. But that<br />
doesn't prevent us having a view to be put, and -I hope to be<br />
be heard. The freedom, the liberty of Australians, depends<br />
as much upon the working out of the relationship between<br />
the Western Alliance and the Soviet Union as does the<br />
freedom and liberty of Western Europe or the United States<br />
itself.<br />
And while in many of these things we are not a principal<br />
party, we are nevertheless vitally interested. Peace and<br />
freedom are too important to be left t. 0 the super powers<br />
alone. Over and above that, the Australian Government has<br />
an obligation to Australians.<br />
We, not Americans or Europeans or Englishmen, must be<br />
protectors of Australian liberty, of Australian democracy..<br />
We owe it to our fathers who fought for peace and liberty<br />
to see that we fulfil that obligation, and we owe it<br />
more to our children. We owe it to them to make sure that<br />
peace does not go by default simply because those who want it<br />
leave its defence to others.<br />
We in Australia recognise that if we wish the United States<br />
to do what is necessary in defence of world peace, we<br />
must do what we can on our own account, and I believe<br />
this Government has lived up to that obligation in many ways.<br />
Mr Vice-President, today's world is facing threats to its<br />
stability, to its security, -more serious<br />
than any that have arisen in the last forty years.<br />
We see the enormous and superior military strength of the<br />
Soviet Union; we see a worsening economic situation in many<br />
countries, leading to serious and tragic levels of unemployment<br />
and hardship; we see poor nations increasingly overwhelmed by<br />
the burden of debt; and developed nations unable to devise<br />
solutions to their own economic problems let alone those of others. </p>
<p>-4<br />
Against this background, the meetings taking place next month<br />
at the Versailles Summit of major Western economic powers, and<br />
at the summit of NATO heads of government in Bonn take on<br />
added urgency.<br />
Following Afghanistan and Poland, there are some problems<br />
to be tackled within the Western alliance. These are compounded<br />
by economic difficulty and uncertainty and it will be. harder<br />
to achieve the necessary unity and sense of purpose.<br />
In all of this, the burden of leadership rests on the<br />
United States, on President Reagan, and I am sure you would<br />
all want me to wish him and his administration well in the<br />
great and enormous responsibilities that will be with them.<br />
Mr Vice-President, I thought it appropriate in this year<br />
in particular to speak of the origins of the on-going<br />
relationship between the United States and Australia, because<br />
it has a particular relevance to the problems that need to<br />
be faced, and it does not hurt to remind ourselves the<br />
relationship between the United States and Australia is not<br />
just one of shared values and interests, but one which is<br />
based in history and shared sacrifice by Americans and<br />
Australians. Since its inception in 1948, the Australian-American<br />
Association has worked tirelessly to promote understanding<br />
between our two countries, and to provide a continuing<br />
contribution to the development of friendly contacts.<br />
I know that I speak for the Association as well as for<br />
myself when I say that we are indeed vgry grateful<br />
Vice-President George Bush and Mrs Bush have been able<br />
to join us for the celebration of Australia-America week.<br />
We know the pressures of office and we are glad to see the<br />
United States recognising its interest in Japan, South-East<br />
Asia, Australia, New Zealand and China by the Vice-President's<br />
visit to the Pacific area.<br />
It is timely and welcome, and the discussions we had earlier<br />
today have been of great value. Mr Vice-President, I bid<br />
you welcome to Australia. </p>
