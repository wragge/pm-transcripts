<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, what's your response to the latest development</p>
<p> in the case of Steve Pratt and Peter Wallace?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I think the hopes and the thoughts and the prayers of many Australians</p>
<p> will be with them. We hope that they get a fair trial. They are not</p>
<p> guilty men. They are humanitarian, decent Australians who are trying</p>
<p> to help their fellow man and we devoutly hope that they will be free</p>
<p> and reunited with their families as soon as possible.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>....with the international observers, does that indicate that it's</p>
<p> now looking as though it's going to be a show trial?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>My concern is for the fate of the two men. I don't wish to answer</p>
<p> that question. I can only express the devout hope that they are given</p>
<p> a fair and decent trial.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>How are your talks with Meg Lees going, Prime Minister?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Continuing.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Is a deal looking more unlikely now?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>The talks are continuing.</p>
