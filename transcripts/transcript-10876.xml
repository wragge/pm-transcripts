  The Australian Government warmly welcomes the conclusion of negotiations</p>
<p> between the Indonesian government and the International Monetary Fund</p>
<p> (IMF) on a new programme for the Indonesian economy. I am pleased</p>
<p> that both sides have approached the negotiations in a positive and</p>
<p> flexible spirit. The entire region has a substantial interest in the</p>
<p> stabilisation of the Indonesian economy and a return to sustainable</p>
<p> growth.</p>
<p>  The renewed commitment of the Indonesian government to implementation</p>
<p> of the new programme is particularly welcome. In our discussions with</p>
<p> the Indonesian government my colleagues and I have stressed that Indonesia's</p>
<p> recovery depends on its commitment to make the necessary reforms.</p>
<p> The support of the international community will also be important.</p>
<p>  We also welcome the flexible and constructive approach of the IMF</p>
<p> to the negotiations. The IMF's support for regional economies</p>
<p> as they make the necessary structural reforms is fundamental to overcoming</p>
<p> the financial crisis and putting in place the conditions for a sustained</p>
<p> recovery</p>
<p>  Australia's support for the new agreement is underlined by our</p>
<p> willingness to bring forward $US300 million from our contribution</p>
<p> to the second tier of IMF support.</p>
<p>  Australia will continue to work closely with the Indonesian government</p>
<p> and the IMF to ensure the successful implementation of the IMF-supported</p>
<p> programme.</p>
<p>  8 April 1998</p>
