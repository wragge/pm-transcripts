SPEAKING NOTES FOR THE PRIHE MINISTER<br />
OPENING OP THE CONFERENCE ON LEGISLATIVE AND AWARD<br />
RESTRICTIONS TO WOKEN'S EMPLOYMENT<br />
17 OCT3OBER 1986<br />
Before a turn to the specific concerns you have gathered to<br />
discuso, I would like briefly to reacquaint you with the<br />
Governront'o comnmitment to Affirmative Action and its<br />
relevance to the current economiic challenges we face. Our<br />
approach to Affirmative Action was based on a belief in<br />
merit ao the aajor principle in determining employment and<br />
promotion. Prom that poscition we proceeded to develop a<br />
program, in consultation with business, unions end other<br />
GovernCots that was compatible with Australia's unique<br />
bunineco, legal and industrial relations traditions.<br />
In ters of the importance to our national economic goals,<br />
the lu; ic behind Affirmative Action is compelingly simple:<br />
no country can afford to neglect half of its huaan<br />
resources. That observation, true as it was in 1984 when<br />
Affiranetive Action was launched, is even more relevant today<br />
when Australia must gear itself to take on the best in world<br />
markets and win. In other words, the benefits to women in<br />
the workforce flowing from Affirmative Action have the<br />
potential to flow on to the economy and nation ao a whole.<br />
Today's conference is a direct result of the process of<br />
co-operation between my Government, employers, unions and<br />
State Governments. Co-operation and consultation is the way<br />
we do business. I believe this conference exemplifies our<br />
general approach and our specific commitment to policy<br />
questions which relate to the status of women.<br />
I should pause to put that specific commitment in its<br />
fullest context. No Government in Australia has set i-tself<br />
so seriously the objective of equal status for women with<br />
that of men in our society or been so successful in<br />
achieving it.<br />
Within the framework of this commitment, we had two<br />
particular important reasons for initiating this conference.<br />
First, the imperative to restore Australia's international<br />
competitive position. Australia needs a flexible, skilled<br />
workforce to face the economic challenge ahead. </p>
<p>Second, our unequivocal commitment to equity for women in<br />
our policy objectives. This means that we will continue to<br />
work hard to eliminate barriers which prevent women from<br />
getting a fair go.<br />
Discriminatory provisions in legislation and awards<br />
prescribing conditions of employment for women clearly<br />
militate cgainst those two objectives.<br />
Undeniably, women have been, and continue to be,<br />
disadvantaged in the labour market. The majority of women<br />
workers aio found in too narrow a range of occupations and<br />
industries. Wocon are concentrated in the sales, clerical<br />
and sorvico, sport and recreation occupational<br />
classifications. They are under-represented in<br />
administrative and executive, transport and communications<br />
occupaticno and in the trades. As a result, women are<br />
particulaay vulnerable to the effects of economic downturn,<br />
new technology and structural change.<br />
We wero zll too well aware of this picture in coming to<br />
office, zad through the Affirmative Action program, together<br />
with other labor market programs, we have taken concrete<br />
steps to tackle the problem. Our approach. has been<br />
by consultation and co-operation with the<br />
parties concerned.<br />
We recognico the importance of developing our policy<br />
positions by taking into account the views of those groups<br />
who will be most directly affected and most active in their<br />
implementation. So, for example, with Affirmative Action,<br />
we did not cimply rush into a program of legislative reform<br />
which wouXd be unacceptable to employers, unions or womon<br />
themselvec. Instead we embarked upon a process of<br />
discussion end experiment. Some 18 months later we were in<br />
an ideal position to develop legislation acceptable to all<br />
parties, passing as it did through the Parliament in August<br />
with only very minor changes.<br />
Through that process we identified the impediments to equal<br />
opportunity in employment for women that arise from<br />
legislative and award restrictions.<br />
Companies participating in the Affirmative Action pilot<br />
program identified restrictions to women's employment in<br />
certain catogories of occupation or certain environments<br />
which were the direct result of legislative or award<br />
prescription. For example, restrictions on the maximum<br />
weights that women can lift are a very real obstacle to<br />
women being employed in jobs requiring manual handling.<br />
There are other restrictions which also deny opportunities<br />
in a range of jobs that otherwise would, and indeed should<br />
be available to women. </p>
<p>3.,<br />

introuced to protect women from~ the very goal hazards in<br />
the workpaace. However, they also grew out of ontroached<br />
attitudoc to the role of women which aco no 1orngor<br />
acceptOblo. These provisiona need to be ro-ouamined in the<br />
light o2' cnti-diacricination and occupational hoalth and<br />

there ucs a need for urgjont attantion to bo paid to this<br />
problom, Tho Tdorzl Government hoo a letarship gole in this area.<br />
We do, zc&amp;. er all, require the privato sector, through the<br />
AffirmatAve Action legislation, to undertakeo major reviews<br />
of thoir, own practice and procedures to oncure that women<br />
ar2 not discouraged or indeed prevented Crorm taking up job<br />
opportuitioa. Clearly, however, there are areas of our<br />
legislativa and award Icyotems which go beyond the influence<br />
of indiv. ducil em~ ployers.,<br />
Govarnra: ntG cannot, of couirse, change th-oGe oysterns by<br />
waving a wand. But as advocates of oqual opportunity we<br />
. will do w~ iatever is in our powcr to oncourage the relovant<br />
partier, o come together in a forum such or; today'G to<br />
addroon thcse isoues.<br />
indeed tte stage Is already 5et 2oz change. Th c<br />
DAscxiujination Act which cam~ e into offoct In .194 provided<br />
for an c2 omption for discrimiatoryj Sta lccjolotioa for<br />
two yearc. In uguot 1936 vie revicued that aeoption. Due<br />
to the limited progrecs oadc in ravftewing diGcriminatory<br />
legiGL~ tion made by State Govornaients nnd the nood 5or an<br />
orderly process of review and change, we decided to extend<br />
the e2nemption for a further 12 montha to 1 August 1987.<br />
I would like to make it clear-today, however, that our<br />
Government stands firm in its view that State and Territory<br />
governmnents should take urgent action to remove<br />
discrimiaatory provisions in their own legislation. To that<br />
end, further enemptions beyond I August 1987 will not be<br />
considered unless there is clear and substantial<br />
justification on health arid safety grounds.<br />
Of course the Sex Discrimination Act does not apply to State<br />
awards or to existing or future Federal awards. The States<br />
should take their own initiatives to ensure that their-own<br />
awards are free from discriminatory provisions.<br />
In the case of the Federal Government, Cabinet will bo<br />
shortly considering an amendment to the Conciliation and<br />
Arbitration Act to require the Conciliation and Arbitration<br />
Commiosion, when making future awirds or orders,~ to have<br />
regard to the anti-discrimination provisionis of the Sex<br />
Discrimination Act. </p>
<p>Significcant ground work has been undortakon t1roady. Peak~<br />
councils hnve shown a genuine comrnitmont to renev~ ng.<br />
existing dtocriminatory provisions in Federal nwardo. I<br />
would like to record my appreciation of the willingness<br />
demonstrated by the ACTU and key employer badice during<br />
consultatiens leading up to this COnfercenco, Jointly to<br />
supervise n system which vill accolcritg tho removal oi<br />
currently onisting discriminatory provisiono in awazds.<br />
Some Stato Govornmontc havo oloo actod to oncourago change<br />
to restoictive provisions of State awarda and I aook forward<br />
to the detL Zlcd reports which the Statoo and T'eryltorics<br />
will be mr'&amp; ing on progross in thin area.<br />
in riddin2 our legislative and z. -ird aystoD of<br />
discriminatory practices wo will be taking a significant<br />
step forwaicd in oliminating barriora to Womaoo~ aqUc3<br />
participatn in the work gorco.<br />
F~ or our patthic is part and parcel of a much broader<br />
program of reform to raise tho Gtatus of wom~ en In all walks<br />
of life.<br />
I have raoo: od already to the lowor status of women in<br />
employmont. 3t is true that z~ any wonen conti. nue to look to<br />
their role ivi the home and the family for their pzincip~ l<br />
fulfilment. But we need to rememabor thot wouen alo<br />
continue to take the brunt of outmoded and inappropriate<br />
attitudes qite inconsistent with notions of equality; that<br />
women maike tri over 60 per cent of the racipienta of Socini.<br />
Security benefAits and that ovortwholoingly wotnen cnsrry Via<br />
responsibil. 1tieG Of child roaring in society.<br />
In three sho : t years of Covernont w3 have donoc auch to<br />
address thesi issues, not just because they represent<br />
inequalitios but because they 1upede our efficient economic<br />
and social development.<br />
The Sex Discrimination Act, for example, provides women with<br />
an avenue appeal against actions by individuals or groupe<br />
which discraminate on the grounds of sex, marital status or<br />
pregnancy. Since this Act was passod there have been over<br />
complaints to the Sex Discrimination Commissioner, the<br />
vast majority of which have been settled successfully<br />
through conciliation. The use of this avenue~ by so many<br />
women in Australia in just over two years denronstrateo<br />
without doubt the need for a legislative framework from<br />
within which to encourage attitudinal change.<br />
For those women who are dependent on the Social Se curity<br />
system for thuir income we have done much to alleviate both<br />
their dependency and their poverty. By Christmas of this<br />
year the standard weekly pension/ benefit will be 37.5 per<br />
cent higher than when we came to p'owe r; wc will in fact be<br />
close to achieving the target of increasing pensions and<br />
benefits to 25 per cent of the average weekly earnings.<br />
Additional pznr~ ion or benefit and the family income<br />
supplement wil. also have increased by a significant 70 per<br />
cent and the mother's/ guardian's allowance by 100 per cent. </p>
<p>.7 We recognise too that there are anomalies in the Social<br />
Security systoea resulting from a history of incremental<br />
change to that system. To remedy this we are conducting a<br />
major review of the Social Security system, with femilles in<br />
poverty az a central focus.<br />
We are also Gil too well aware of the difficulties faced by<br />
single parentc who do not get adequate support from their<br />
previous partner or spouse. Our review of child maintenance<br />
arrangementG, about which a dincussion paper was published<br />
for comment last woek, aims to shift the responsibility of<br />
caring for children to both parents.<br />
We want to provide ways in which womon can move from the<br />
poverty cyclo to economic independence. Our initiatives in<br />
encouraging women to participate in labour market programs<br />
and in education all surve to do just that. Our commitment<br />
to the creatAon of 20,000 new child care places by June 1988<br />
acknowledges the very real need for women in all situations<br />
to have access to high quality care for their children.<br />
Our achiovemcnta, I believe, are considerable, but still<br />
more needs to be done. To this end last year I announced in<br />
the Parliamnt that the Government would devise a national<br />
agenda for women until the year 2000. Through consultation<br />
with iany thousanda of Australian women over the past eight<br />
months we ' have gone a long way in ascertaining the views and<br />
aspirations of women in varying circumstances around<br />
Australia. These vieva will hoIp the Government to identify a program,<br />
of action that will ensure that by the year 2000, women not<br />
only have a cay, but have a choice, and most importantly a<br />
fair go. No doubt many of the issues that will arise as a<br />
result of the national agenda will need to be tackled in<br />
co-operation with other sectors of the comm, u nity in much the<br />
same way as we are meeting and talking today.<br />
Our Government is committed to playing a major role in that<br />
process in whatever form is appropriate, and we look forward<br />
to your continued co-operation in helping us to give women a<br />
fair go in employment related fields.<br />
I wish you every success for today's deliberations and look<br />
forward to hearing about the conference outcomes. </p>
