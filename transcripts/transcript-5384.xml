1,, AU ST,, L
PRIME MINISTER f-' 4V Q'P<br />
FOR E DIA THURSDAY 1919<br />
OLYM PIC GAMES A. O. P. EXECUTIVE DECISTO<br />
The Prime M4inister said today that the Government deeply<br />
regretted the decision of the Executive of the Australian<br />
Olympic Federation re-affirming participation by an Australian<br />
Team in the Moscow Olympic Games.<br />
The Prime Minister said that no Member of the Executive had<br />
contested the Government's analysis of the world situation as<br />
described by the Prime Minister, the Deputy Prime Minister,<br />
the Foreign Minister and Mr. Ellicott.<br />
Members of the Executive were specifically asked whether they<br />
agreed or-not with the Government analysis of the seriousness<br />
of the world political situation following the Soviet invasion<br />
of Afghanistan. It was clear that all Members of the Executive<br />
agreed with the Government's analysis.<br />
Against that background, the Prime Minister said, he was at a<br />
loss to understand how the majority of the Executive could<br />
re-affirm its earlier decision.<br />
The Government remained firmly of the view that a boycott of the<br />
Moscow Gamnes is correct, for two specific reasons. The Soviet.<br />
Union has made itself an unfit host for the Games because of<br />
its conti~ nued aggression and brutality against Afghanistan.<br />
In addition, the Australian Government is strongly and unrepentantly<br />
of the view that we should stand with regional friends and partners<br />
and with major allies.<br />
It is a sad day for Australia to find ourselves alone with<br />
Communist Laos and Vietnam from our part of the world. All<br />
other countries of South-East Asia and the Pacific are supporting<br />
the boycott and de facto New Zealand also supports it'l, l eaving<br />
Australia in company with Laos and Vietnam alone.<br />
The Governmient, makes no apology for putting its -view consistently<br />
and firmly. We had a duty and an obligation to add Australia's<br />
weight to the scales, to the cause of liberty and independence<br />
of nations. </p>
<p>2<br />
Australia has not been alone in this view. Governments of<br />
nearly all major freedom loving countries, of a number of<br />
diff'--L: erent political complexions, have taken the same vie-% q.<br />
Indeed, 67 countries are not going, including three of the<br />
five top medal winning countries at the last O-lympics; and<br />
an effective boycott is in place.<br />
It is to the profound regret of the Government that members<br />
of. L th*, e Executive of the Olympic Federation, who agreed w,% ith<br />
tne Government's assessment of the international situation,<br />
ch~ ose to isolate Australia from her regional friends and major<br />
allies on this issue.<br />
In the Government's view, the AOF Executive's decision is wrong.<br />
Nevertheless the Government has tof~ d the Executive that it will<br />
not use arbitrary and totalitarian powers to prevent participation.<br />
The only power effectively available * to the Government would be<br />
to deny access to a passport to travel overseas. That is not<br />
a proper power for a democratic Government to use in these<br />
circumstances.<br />
1-1e have sought to persuade the members of the AOF Executive as<br />
Australians to put this nation first. The majority has not<br />
done so.<br />
I ask all Australians to note the substantial contradiction in<br />
the Executive's statement.<br />
A majority of the Executive says that it is too late for them<br />
to change their minds about attendance in Moscow, but in the<br />
same breath they urge individual sporting bodies and individual<br />
athletes to consider my remarks carefully, implying that it is<br />
not too late for those sporting bodies and individuals to change<br />
their minds.<br />
How the Executive can reconcile these points of view is beyond<br />
comprehension. It represents'a failure of executive leadership and a denial<br />
oit: national responsibility. 000---</p>
