SECOND VLSLT TO THE US 1969<br />
S { D1 E Y, N. S. W.<br />
DEPARTURE PRESS CONFERENCE GIVEN BY THE<br />
PRIME MINISTER, MR TOHN1 GORTON AT M OASC<br />
AIRPORT 1 MAY 1969<br />
Q. Prime Minister, it was suggested today that a US Senate<br />
Committee will investigate both Pine Gap and Woomera installations. Do<br />
you know anything about this?<br />
PM:-No. All know about it is that I read a headline in one of the<br />
Sydney evening papers to that effect.<br />
Q. Are you worried that any such investigation would prejudice<br />
the security of the installations?<br />
PM: I would merely have this to say, both on Woomera and Pine<br />
Gap that as far as .; am concerned I would not urge the United States<br />
to make public any information which the United States felt would derogate<br />
from the usefulness of those installations.<br />
Q. . t was suggested in the same article that Pine Gap was used<br />
for chemical warfare research.<br />
PM: I have never heard that. i understand, and believe that<br />
there are no chemical warfare experiments going on anywhere in<br />
Australia, as far as I know.<br />
Q. What particular defence points do you want to discuss in<br />
America?<br />
PM: Oh, quite a wide range of matters all dealing with defence.<br />
I couldn't possibly enumerate them all. Y'ou wouldn't expect me to.<br />
Q. Mr Gorton, what are the important issues you will be<br />
discussing with the President?<br />
PM: There again, I don't believe you would expect me to give<br />
a list. " it wouldn't be exhauscive. I might leave something out. I might<br />
mention something that, as it turned out, we didn't discuss. I think all<br />
I can say is " a wide range of matters dealing with our security and our<br />
relations with the United States and a continuation of the talks which last<br />
time were begun. And that is really all 11 can say.<br />
Q. Sir, do you expect to find any more evidence of isolationism<br />
in the attitude of the US Administration towards South-East Asia both<br />
militarily and politically? </p>
<p>2-<br />
PM: Have I ever said i found any evidence of isolationiam<br />
Q. Y'ou have not personally,<br />
PM:-Well how could I find any more. You asked me if<br />
I expect to find any more evidence and I want to make it clear that<br />
so far I haven't detected evidence of isolatiods m in the talks I have<br />
had over there.<br />
Q. What aspects of the Vietnam peace talks will you be<br />
discussing with the President?<br />
PM: i couldn't tell you at this stage, but undoubtedly the<br />
subject of peace talks will be raised and talked about, as to what<br />
aspects, I couldn't tell you now.<br />
Q. Will you be talking about withdrawing Australian<br />
troops?<br />
PM: I don't see that happening in the foreseeable future<br />
as has already been explained by the Minister for Defence and the<br />
Minister for the Army. But it must depend on the way things develop,<br />
and no-one can tell precisely how things will develop.<br />
Q. Sir are they ready to retain their role in Asia?<br />
PM: To retain their interest in Asia? I believe the United<br />
States would retain its interest in Asia in one form or another without<br />
special request.<br />
Q. Will you be urging this on the Americans?<br />
PM: . don't think there will be any need for me to urge it.<br />
But of course Australia would like the United States to retain an<br />
interest in Asia, but i don't think there will be any need to specially<br />
urge that. I think it will happen.<br />
Q. Any specific reason for another return trip to Canada<br />
on the way back?<br />
PM: Really just because this is somnething like the fourth<br />
rushed trip in a year or less than a year, and the specific reason<br />
is to have a couple of days somewkere to sleep before the final<br />
hop back. </p>
<p>-3-<br />
Q. Will you be seeing Mr Trudeau?<br />
PM: I am not sure. I don't think so. I would be delighted<br />
if he w, re able to spend a day to come and see us; I would be very<br />
pleased, but that would be subject to his own engagements in Ottawa.<br />
Q. How would you sum up what you expect from your<br />
talks?<br />
PM: I would like to sum them up when I come back and<br />
when I talk to Parliament. </p>
