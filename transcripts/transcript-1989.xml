FOR PRESS: P. M. No. 9/ 1969<br />
ECONOMIC CONSULTATIONS K-0~ J1969<br />
Statement by-the Prime Minister, Mr. John Gorton<br />
Invitations have been extended to representatives of<br />
national organisations to meet with Ministers in Canberra next month.<br />
Ministers will meet these organisations on 10 March<br />
in three separate groups: primary industry, manufacturing industry<br />
and commerce. The talks will, I am sure, be most useful in providing<br />
Ministers with an up-to-date appreciation of the views of those directly<br />
Involved in commerce and industry.<br />
Invitations have also been extended for representatives<br />
of the Export Development Council and the Manufacturing Industries<br />
Advisory Council to have separate discussions with Ministers on the<br />
morning of 11 March and with representatives of the Australian Council<br />
of Trade Unions that afternoon.<br />
Below is a list of the national organisations invited to<br />
be represented at these talks.<br />
