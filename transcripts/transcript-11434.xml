    <content><![CDATA[<p>E&amp;OE....................</p>
<p>  Thank you very much Sharman Stone, the Member for Murray. To my other Parliamentary</p>
<p>   colleagues, Mr John Daton, the other distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen.</p>
<p>  The last time I visited the Murray electorate as Prime Minister we had a</p>
<p>   gathering under a rooftop such as this at Euchuca, and it was associated</p>
<p>   once again with an environmental project, and it was conducted more or less</p>
<p>   under the aegis of the Murray-Darling Basin Commission. And I'm delighted</p>
<p>   to be back today to be associated with the commissioning of this marvellous</p>
<p>   project. As the sign outside declares it's a project jointly funded by the</p>
<p>   Commonwealth, the State and the community. And in many ways today's event</p>
<p>   and this particular project fulfils two of the goals that I had about the</p>
<p>   nature of government policy, in not only the environmental area but many</p>
<p>   other areas, when I became Prime Minister.</p>
<p>  One of those goals was to achieve what I've chosen to describe as the building</p>
<p>   of a social coalition within our community, recognising that the many problems</p>
<p>   that confront Australia and Australians, none of them can be solved by the</p>
<p>   Commonwealth government, or indeed any government acting alone. None of</p>
<p>   them can be completely solved by individuals or communities acting alone.</p>
<p>   None of them can be solved by business organisations acting alone. But most</p>
<p>   of them can be solved if there is an effective coalition between all of</p>
<p>   those interests. And caring for the environment is one such area where that</p>
<p>   social coalition has really begun to work in a big way.</p>
<p>  This sort of gathering, as many would acknowledge, wouldn't have been possible</p>
<p>   10, or 15, or 20 years ago. 10 or 15 years ago a lot of people in this audience</p>
<p>   wouldn't have thought the environment was anything other than a trendy issue</p>
<p>   that concerned the leafy suburbs of Melbourne and Sydney. They were wrong.</p>
<p>   Just as many of the people who live in those trendy suburbs don't understand</p>
<p>   that you've got to get a balance between caring for the environment and</p>
<p>   the preservation of jobs, particularly in industries such as the forestry</p>
<p>   industry. But that belongs to another time and another place. But it's still</p>
<p>   a very important issue and it's a very important example of the need to</p>
<p>   preserve a balance in our community. And if we want to preserve the Australian</p>
<p>   bush all of us have got to understand that we have a contribution to make.</p>
<p>  And what this project does is therefore bring together that social coalition.</p>
<p>   But it is also a practical outcome of an idea I had more than three-and-a-half</p>
<p>   years ago when I was thinking in the lead up to the 1996 election about</p>
<p>   how it would be possible to make the sale of one-third of Telstra not only</p>
<p>   a boon for reducing debt in Australia but also to use some of the proceeds</p>
<p>   of that to provide some attractive investment in areas that were important</p>
<p>   to Australia's long term future. And I don't think I'm exaggerating to say</p>
<p>   that sort of, almost literally walking along the beaches at Hawkes Nest,</p>
<p>   the place on the coast of New South Wales where my family want to go for</p>
<p>   its annual holiday, I devised the idea of establishing a natural heritage</p>
<p>   trust. And then out of that sale of Telstra we would invest money in a trust</p>
<p>   that would be used, I hope in perpetuity, to contribute to the renewal of</p>
<p>   Australia's environment.</p>
<p>  And the Murray-Darling Basin is the principle recipient of resources coming</p>
<p>   out of that trust. And the problems that are encapsulated just over there,</p>
<p>   the challenges that are met by this project, the problems of salinity, of</p>
<p>   water logging, age old problems becoming more pressing as we move into the</p>
<p>   next Century. They are the very practical things that are being addressed</p>
<p>   out of this trust and of the money that is being made available.</p>
<p>  And we are witnessing a level of cooperation between different sections</p>
<p>   of the Australian community that we haven't had before. And people have</p>
<p>   put aside their differences and they see that they have a common benefit</p>
<p>   and a common gain to be had out of working together to properly look after</p>
<p>   our environment. And many of the assumptions we all made as children that</p>
<p>   certain resources in this country were unlimited, the idea that we'd never</p>
<p>   have to worry about nurturing them or conserving, all of those assumptions</p>
<p>   have been challenged over the last 20 or 30 years.</p>
<p>  One of the most symbolic things my wife said she's ever done since I've</p>
<p>   been Prime Minister was to be invited to cap the first bore just near Longreach</p>
<p>   in Queensland a few months ago under the program that was announced in the</p>
<p>   budget to begin repairing the great Artesian Basin which is so tremendously</p>
<p>   important to the long term resource future of this country.</p>
<p>  We are all a lot more conscious of the precious and the limited resources</p>
<p>   that this country has. And all of us are more willing and more able and</p>
<p>   more ready now to sink our difference on issues to work together to preserve.</p>
<p>   The farmers of Australia have become the greatest environmentalists in relation</p>
<p>   to land care of all and I congratulate them. They've always understood the</p>
<p>   value of land better than most and they've always understood that if you</p>
<p>   don't take care of your valuable resources then you'll pay a very heavy</p>
<p>   price in years to come. The contribution that rural people have made to</p>
<p>   the land care movement has been truly astonishing.</p>
<p>  I want to thank the scientists associated with the commission. I want to</p>
<p>   thank everybody who's been associated with getting this project together.</p>
<p>   I think as I look around this gathering I see every generation and every</p>
<p>   section of the community represented. I see the young from the schools,</p>
<p>   I see people representing the farming community, people representing local</p>
<p>   government, people representing Federal and State government, local businessmen</p>
<p>   and women, all of you have come to this gathering. And something in the</p>
<p>   order of $15 million already has come to this particular catchment area</p>
<p>   and over $1 million to this particular project from the Natural Heritage</p>
<p>   Trust.</p>
<p>  And it really does give me an enormous amount of pleasure to be involved</p>
<p>   in this commissioning ceremony today. I want to acknowledge the tremendous</p>
<p>   energy that Sharman Stone as your Federal Member has brought to concern</p>
<p>   for environmental issues. She's fought very hard to see that the electorate</p>
<p>   of Murray gets its fair share of the resources that are coming out of [inaudible].</p>
<p>   If it gets more than its fair share well she won't be one to point that</p>
<p>   out. And like any good Federal Member why should she be.</p>
<p>  But this electorate is really in a sense, and what happens here will be</p>
<p>   a metaphor for the capacity of our entire nation to handle these problems</p>
<p>   because the problem of salinity is a huge challenge for this country. Water</p>
<p>   conservation is a huge challenge for Australia. And the management of our</p>
<p>   resources in relation to those two challenges in particular will determine</p>
<p>   the ongoing wealth of the ongoing capacity of this part of our country.</p>
<p>  It is the food basket of Australia. I've been reminded of that quite forcefully</p>
<p>   and quite effectively over the last few hours since I arrived in Shepparton</p>
<p>   last night. I visited the largest pear producer in Australia. I've come</p>
<p>   to this magnificent gathering and I've had the opportunity of opening the</p>
<p>   new Department of Rural Health associated with the University of Melbourne,</p>
<p>   an exercise and a project that is designed to address over time the shortage</p>
<p>   of medical facilities and doctors within rural communities. But to be involved</p>
<p>   in the commissioning of Stage 1A of this project, and to thank all of those</p>
<p>   who've been associated with it, and to particularly congratulate the local</p>
<p>   community for coming together and working so effectively to get behind the</p>
<p>   project is a distinct privilege and honour for me. And I therefore have</p>
<p>   tremendous pleasure in declaring it, commissioned I think is the correct</p>
<p>   turn of phrase, commission the Muckatah Depression Catchment Project Stage</p>
<p>   1, I declare it duly commissioned. Thank you.</p>
<p>  [Ends]</p>
