AID FOR TASAHIIA<br />
The Priam3 inister, Mr. Holt said today that there<br />
had been further discussion in the course of the visit to<br />
Canberra of Mr. Reece of the arrangements to apply to relief of<br />
hardship from the Tasmanian bushfires and mattcrs of<br />
rehabilitation. The Treasurer, Ir. Hc'Mahon and Mr. Howson, the<br />
Commonwealth's Liaison inister for purposes connected with<br />
bushfire assistance had participated in the talks between the<br />
Prime Mlinister and Mr. Reece.<br />
The Commonwealth proposed thact special assistance<br />
should be given to Tasmania in order to restore as quickly as<br />
possible the economy of the State and to relieve the hardship<br />
and suffering of those affected.<br />
Mr. Howson had made two visits to Tasmania and had<br />
held discussions with the Premier. In addition, Commonwealth<br />
and State officers had conferred continuously on all aspects.<br />
Mr. Holt said he and Mr. Reece were now able to state that they<br />
had reached agreement on the basic principles of a program-me of<br />
relief and rehabilitation. The Commonwealth had undertaken to provide<br />
substantial support to the State for the measures Mr. Reece<br />
proposed to introduce. These measures would be such as the<br />
State considered to be necessary to meet the emergency and the<br />
hardship which had been experienced in various sectors of the<br />
economy. The State would consult with the Commonwealth about<br />
its proposed measures of assistance to confirm their<br />
acceptability for the purposes of the Commonwealth's financial<br />
undertaking to the State.<br />
As in the case of the help given to New South Wales<br />
and Queensland for relief of the drought, the Commonwealth's<br />
overall financial assistance to the State of Tasmiania would be<br />
provided partly by way of loan and partly by way of grant.<br />
Mr. Holt praised the generous and ready response to<br />
the Governor's Appeal Fund from every corner of Australia and<br />
overseas. This would go a long way towards relieving personal<br />
hardship and distress. Mr. Reece had said that he hoped it<br />
would be possible to provide many of the families made homeless<br />
with some basic furniture and other essential household<br />
requisites. Mr. Holt said he and the Premier reaffirmed the<br />
basic principles already announced late last week concerning<br />
assistance for housing. It was intended to provide housing up<br />
to Housing Department standards with need as the first criterion.<br />
The two Governments were now looking closely at the<br />
problems of primary producers and people in business. They<br />
had suffered not only an immediate loss of income but also a<br />
loss of capital. It was not yet possible to lay down the basis<br />
of assistance, but efforts would be made to enable those<br />
affected to be rehabilitated in their own area. </p>
<p>2<br />
There were some particular problems facing primary<br />
producers, especially those concerned with replacing fencing<br />
and stock. These were being considered. There would be<br />
special discussions about these between Commonwealth and State<br />
officers as soon as possible.<br />
The Commonwealth recognises that the loss of assets<br />
to the State, such as schools, bridges and powerlines would<br />
also need to be considered. Its approach would be to ensure<br />
that these assets would be reinstated without the State<br />
incurring an onerous debt burden, or the necessity to make<br />
replacement at the expense of the State's ordinary works<br />
programme. The Premier, for his part, paid a warm tribute to<br />
the help and attitude of the Commonwealth, and expressed his<br />
personal thanks to the Prime Minister, the Federal Treasurer<br />
and 1ir. Howson.<br />
