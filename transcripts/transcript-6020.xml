ELECTORATE TALK<br />
b~ aborls economic policies show ' That conteimpt the Labor Party<br />
has for Australians. It is just a re-run of the tired, tried<br />
policies that Mr Whitlarn forccd on Australia, and which caused<br />
a great deal of hardship for all Australians.<br />
It is Labor's age old answer to any economic question: to spend,<br />
spend, spend. Labor would add according to their estimates,<br />
a further-$ 2.75 billion to the Budgcet deficit, and the real<br />
cost of their policies would be a lot higher. Labor adinits.<br />
its big spending would require a greatly increased borrowing<br />
program, and says it would raise some of that money with<br />
indexed national recovery bonds. These are the kind of<br />
securities-whlich would be required by a Government which was<br />
having difficulty borrowing money, and if investors wcore<br />
worried about higher Government spendi4ng and higher inflation.<br />
It is extraordinary that Labor should feel it necessaryr to outL'. Lne<br />
the steps it would take to deal with the consequences of big<br />
spending and high inflation. Of course, their-b-igger borrowing<br />
prograra and their indexed bonds would draw funds fromt banks and<br />
building societi. es, and leave less money for housing and businoss.<br />
Interest rates would be forced up; families paying off their homes<br />
would be hit hard; small businesses would be hit hard, and<br />
farmers, who are struggling with the severe effects of the<br />
drought, would also be very hard hit.<br />
The Labor policy docuant acknowledges that the Governmzent has built<br />
up our exports, has .1. aid the fouiidation for a big increase in expOrt-S<br />
when world trade picks tip, and has, Increased our international<br />
reserves to a record level. But this same document fore, shatdow-S<br />
a serious balance of payments crisis arising from policies they<br />
would introduco. Th1ey go on to say how they would then deal with<br />
that crisis by greatly increased borrowing overseas, and by<br />
a higher tax on imports, which would of course add to costs.<br />
It is again extraordinary that a Party offering itself for officf!<br />
should predict a balance of payments crisis causod by the policie-s<br />
it would introduce if it were to obtain office. It is a<br />
recognitiom by Labor of the risks in their own policies. And<br />
it more than that. it is a recognition that overse~ ts<br />
investment, would flood out of Australia, and be replaced by<br />
Khemlani type loans. </p>
<p>Electorate Talk--1323<br />
Labor's economic policies also tell us what we have always known,<br />
that Labor would iuunediately destroy the wage pause.<br />
That of ' course is exactly what the trade union movement wants,<br />
and if you ever wanted any evidence of the infliieace of the<br />
trade unions over the Labor Party, you only had to look at the<br />
front page of last Friday's Sydney Morning Herald where Mr<br />
Hawke was shown happily shaking hands with those well-known<br />
Left Wing unionists, Laurie Carmichael and John Halfpenny, after<br />
receiving $ 50,000 for his campaign from t-heir union. Th at<br />
picture tells its own story. Labor and the unions are totally<br />
alone in wanting to wa~ sh the pause and<br />
sabotage the return to Competitiveness and profitability in<br />
our industries which the pause will give. But then that is<br />
what the Left Wing union leaders want.<br />
Labor's economic policies have not only been attacked and condemned<br />
by the Government. Labor's spokesman on employment, Mr Young,<br />
was asked last Friday whether two people in the studio would<br />
have a better chance of employment if Labor was in government.<br />
He said " No The Australian newspaper has described<br />
Labor's policies as " disastrous" and " the road to recklessness". s<br />
The Financial Review Editorial said that Labor was relying<br />
" ion a naive 19th century faith in funny money". Labor's<br />
economic program, far from being one of " reconciliation and<br />
reconstruction", would plunge Australia and Australians into<br />
despair. 00o--2 13.2.83 </p>
