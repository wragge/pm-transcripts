29 May 1997 TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
THE HON JOHN HOWARD MP<br />
INTERVIEW WITH PAUL LYNEHAM NIGHTLINE<br />
E O E I<br />
LYNEHAM: Prime Minister, welcome again to Nightline.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
It's good to be here.<br />
LYNEHAM: Now your opponents say that you are not big-hearted enough to lead the nation towards true<br />
reconciliation between black and white. What do you say?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
That's mean-spirited and it's wrong and it's what you would expect from a political opponent. I am<br />
committed to reconciliation but on a proper basis and not a basis that is preoccupied with the past<br />
but rather a basis that is concerned about addressing disadvantage in the present and building a<br />
stronger, more co-operative future so I dismiss that as the typical criticism of political opponents.<br />
LYNEHAM: But you know it's widely said that your speech on Monday to the Reconciliation Convention could<br />
have, should have offered more leadership, more inspiration.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well I made it very clear the depth of my personal feeling about past injustices and I think in doing<br />
so I spoke for most of Australian community. I strongly defended what I am trying to do with native<br />
title against some unfair criticism and you cannot have a proper dialogue between different sections<br />
of the Australian community unless we speak plainly and directly and frankly to each other.<br />
LYNEHAM:<br />
Wasn'it it too much of a political speech, not enough reaching out?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
No, well Paul, I did a lot of reaching out in that speech but when claims were made in my presence<br />
that my ten point plan was blatantly lopsided and deliberately unfair, I naturally, on behalf of the<br />
Government must respond.<br />
LYNEHAM: You apologised personally but you didn't apologise as the leader of the nation, on behalf of the<br />
nation for say the stolen generation issue. Why not?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well there are a number of reasons. One of them is that a formal, unqualified apology does,<br />
according to legal advice that we have received have certain legal implications and those who study </p>
<p>this carefully, and I am sure there are many in the Labor Party who have done that, who know that<br />
what I am saying is true.<br />
LYNEIIAM: So you have to perhaps then be liable for compensation which you don't want.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
The advice that I have received from a Government senior legal adviser is that an unqualified<br />
apology has significant legal implications and that is one of the reasons why the response to this<br />
report must be a considered response and we must, as the Report Chairman acknowledged, give<br />
ourselves time to respond in a measured way. I mean, there are many things in the recommendations<br />
which I am sure most people would very stronglysupport.<br />
LYNEHIIAM: It's a very shocking document.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
It is and I have read large parts of it. I have read many of the personal cases.<br />
LYNEHAM: Could you understand Kim Beazley's emotion yesterday"<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Look I never criticise anybody for displaying emotion. I never would so I make no criticism of him<br />
or indeed anybody else but can I say that we cannot get into a situation in this country where current<br />
generations accept responsibility for past misdeeds. I mean, where does it end? Will you get to a<br />
situation where, say children given in adoption might at some time in the future argue that their<br />
human rights were violated because their natural mothers had no right to agree? There has to be a<br />
point at which we resolve as a community to remedy past mistakes by building a better future.<br />
Surely that is the code by which a reconciled Australia ought to live.<br />
LYNELIAM: Wasn't the Governor General right when he said it's not a question of personal blame, it's a question<br />
really of national shame? If we feel pride about things like Gallipoli and the other defining moments<br />
of our nation, isn't it also fair to feel shame about things we did badly, that we got wrong?<br />
PRIME: MINISTER:<br />
I don't have any argument with that. I have got no quarrel with that.<br />
LYNEHAM: You talk about guilt a lot.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well I do because I think there is an element of retribution in the approach of many people. There is<br />
a theme in the attitude of some which does have guilt and retribution. I have no difficulty at all in<br />
accepting that wrong things were done and they would have caused great pain to people but they<br />
were not done by the present generation.<br />
LYNEIIAM: Some think you want to sweep that under the carpet and just see history through rose coloured<br />
glasses. </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, I mean, my critics always find a way of attacking me. I mean, that's to be expected. And I<br />
didn't expect a warm reception on Monday in Melbourne because many of the people in that<br />
audience are political, life-long enemies of mine and politically hostile to me.<br />
LYNEHAM: We seem so bitter now, so divided, much more so than ' 67 and there's talk now of a possible double<br />
dissolution on your 10 point Wik plan. Don't you fear the social consequences of say, an election<br />
based around that?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Paul, I've got to fix the native title mess, I can't leave it. I've got to fix it. I mean, you cannot leave<br />
the law in its present state. There is enormous uncertainty all around Australia. It's easy for people<br />
to say it's divisive, it's terrible. I'm in the chair. I've got to fix it. And however difficult it is, I'm<br />
determined to do so.<br />
LYNEHAM: On another issue of real national importance your fearless prediction that Mark Taylor would do so<br />
well in Britain, I hope you didn't put too much money on him.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well you know my views on gambling Paul. But can Ijust say of Mark, I still have an enormous<br />
amount of faith in him, I really do...<br />
LYNEHAM: Even though he's forgotten how to bat?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, a lot of Captains have gone through difficulties like that in the past and they've triumphed and<br />
I, along with millions of other Australians are still hoping that it'll all come good.<br />
LYNEHAM: So if you were Chairman of selectors you'd keep him on the team?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Yes I would.<br />
LYNEIAM:<br />
Thanks for your time.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
It's a pleasure. </p>
