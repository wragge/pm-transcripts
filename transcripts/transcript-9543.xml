PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
DOORSTOP, CENTRAL QUEENSLAND UNIVERSITY, ROCKHAMPTON, QLD<br />
7 APRIL 1995<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
PM: I'm happy to take the odd question from you.<br />
J: Mr Keating, there still seems to be some student anger at your recent<br />
comments?<br />
PM: Not very much, I don't think, because they now know that I wasn't<br />
addressing an unemployed person, I was addressing a University student<br />
who didn't wan to pay the HECS fee. And, I made the obvious point if<br />
you don't want to pay your HECS fee, give your place to somebody who<br />
does. And, as a consequence, it means that the nation is investing fourfifths<br />
of the cost of every University course in a young person who can<br />
then go out in the top deciles of wage and salary earners. So they have to<br />
repay the Commonwealth for one-fifth of the cost of their education after<br />
they start work. So, it is eminently fair, and of course, we have put all that<br />
money back into University places. so roughly one-third of all the students<br />
in this campus wouldn't be here without HECS.<br />
J. Do you regret the comment in the first place, though?<br />
PM: Well, the comment was directed to some person who wanted us to pay for<br />
their fees exclusively, and of course that would just take us back to the old<br />
system where only the wealthy had places in universities.<br />
J: The High Court has handed down a decision today which means that State<br />
public servants can switch to the federal award do you feel vindicated?<br />
PM: Well, I think we have extended as the States have adopted obscurantist<br />
laws and policies we have extended the Federal industrial relations<br />
jurisdiction. And, we have left it to employees and unions to decide </p>
<p>whether they want to be Federally registered, and of course, they have<br />
voted with their feet in seeking to be so registered. And, so, I think this<br />
decision is probably a vindication of the Commonwealth's position.<br />
J, Mr Howard on the Noel Crichton-Browne affair earlier this week you said<br />
that he should show some strong leadership, and today he has come out<br />
and said that you can do that with a softly-softly approach do you feel the<br />
same way?<br />
PM: If Mr Crichton-Browne leaves his Senate place, it will obviously have<br />
nothing to do with Mr Howard's leadership it will just be sheer attrition.<br />
And, therefore, it proves the point that it is not thoughtfulness... .1 mean Mr<br />
Howard he is a real wordsmith. He is out there now trying to say, " Well,<br />
it's thoughtful I'm taking a thoughtful, conservative approach to this".<br />
What he has taken is a weak and indecisive approach to it, and if the<br />
Liberal Party insist that Mr Crichton-Browne give up his Senate place, it<br />
will have nought to do with Mr Howard's leadership.<br />
J: And child care you made that promise in 1993<br />
PM: I'm not going through Budget things here. The whole of the outlay system<br />
is under review. This Government has extended child care as no other<br />
Government before when we became the Governiment, there were<br />
45,000 childcare places. We are well on our way now when we are getting<br />
to the point when all the childcare places on demand in this country will be<br />
met.<br />
J: But will you be breaking that election promise?<br />
PM: I just said I'm not going through outlays discussions anything else?<br />
J: What message do you have for the Central Queensland home-owners<br />
struggling with the interest rate hikes?<br />
PM: I am just saying that we have still got relatively low interest rates by<br />
Australian standards it is just that they got to be so low that they were<br />
probably unsustainable. They have now come up a bit but only by a<br />
couple of percent and now the Government is working flat out on the<br />
Budget, and a good Budget will make further increases to the interest<br />
rates far less likely. And, I think that's what most people are worried about<br />
they are worried about the prospect of future interest rates, rather than<br />
what has happened. And, last week we had some national accounts data<br />
-zhnwinn the eoanory slowing a the Govemnmont wntohod it would and<br />
which has proved that the earlier interest rate adjustments are working,<br />
and that coupled with a good Budget means that interest rates rising in </p>
<p>the future will be less likely, and that must be good news for home owners.<br />
Thank you.<br />
J: And just lastly on the drought?<br />
PM: On the drought I will give you a comment the Government has already<br />
acknowledged the difficulties of the drought, and when I came here with<br />
Marjorie Henzell in the later part of last year, we made quite revolutionary<br />
changes to income support. And, as a consequence, we have removed<br />
the farm assets test for the receiving of Social Security support. We now<br />
have 10,000 farm families getting that support. But, nothing can support<br />
them like rain, and so we are hoping that there is now some reasonable<br />
follow up rains to the January rains. Thank you.<br />
ends. </p>
