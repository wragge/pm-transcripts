<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, good morning.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Good morning Neil.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Is there anything which is non-negotiable?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, tax reform is non-negotiable. I mean, we obviously couldn't</p>
<p> agree to an outcome that didn't significantly reform the Australian</p>
<p> taxation system. We have clearly gone into it very committed to tax</p>
<p> reform. I think everybody knows where we stand, everybody knows what</p>
<p> our preferred option is and that is the policy we took to the people</p>
<p> in October of last year. We have added to it with the things that</p>
<p> I mentioned to Senator Harradine last Friday. But that preferred option</p>
<p> in its entirety is not going to get accepted because by the Parliament...</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Well, what is tax reform? How do you define it?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, a tax reform is changes that make the tax system more pro-competitive,</p>
<p> that make our exports cheaper, reduce our business costs....</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Tax relief too for high income....</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>...provide greater incentive to people particularly in the middle</p>
<p> income range. I am a great believer that you have to encourage the</p>
<p> aspirational side of the Australian community. You have got to look</p>
<p> after the poor but you have also got to encourage people who are prepared</p>
<p> to have a go and who want to lift their incomes, who want to perhaps</p>
<p> have a slightly larger home, who want more options in relation to</p>
<p> their children's education. There's a very strong aspirational streak</p>
<p> in the Australian community and I think it is something to be encouraged</p>
<p> and nurtured.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>What is middle income then in your definition?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, it's certainly a lot higher than $40,000 or $50,000 a household.</p>
<p> Bear in mind now an increasingly typical Australian household is perhaps</p>
<p> a husband earning $35,000 to $40,000 and his wife in a part-time job</p>
<p> earning $20,000 to $30,000. Now, that's not completely typical but</p>
<p> there are a growing number of households of which that is a fair description</p>
<p> and you have to take account of them.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Are the diesel fuel concessions on the table?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>That is an area where the Democrats want changes. We naturally are</p>
<p> keen to ensure that the farmers are not, relatively speaking, disadvantaged</p>
<p> because they are still battling although the outlook in the bush now</p>
<p> is a little better than what it was. And I found in Longreach earlier</p>
<p> this week that the farmers saw the Government as being more understanding</p>
<p> of their position. I mean, we would argue we always were but perception</p>
<p> is important and some of the seasons around the country have been</p>
<p> better and there's a bit more hope on the farm horizon but there are</p>
<p> still huge areas of difficulty and I'll be seeing some of them in</p>
<p> New South Wales and Victoria next week.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Does that mean the diesel fuel concessions are less urgent?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, I don't think it does mean that. The Democrats have some concerns</p>
<p> about the environmental aspects of that and we have commenced a discussion</p>
<p> on that and I am quite certain we'll have further discussions and</p>
<p> we're willing to talk that through in some detail. And if there are</p>
<p> alterations that can be made there that protect the benefit of the</p>
<p> rural community and also protect the reductions in business costs</p>
<p> then obviously we're prepared to look at them in a very positive way.</p>
<p> It's one of those areas where you can make some changes in relation</p>
<p> to the environmental effects which are consistent with the business</p>
<p> cost objectives that we have got.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Will the Nationals wear that?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, it's not a question of Nationals versus Liberals. I am as a</p>
<p> Liberal just as committed to the bush, in fact, there are more Liberal</p>
<p> seats in the bush....</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Sure, but we've had the leadership saying they could walk out on Coalition</p>
<p> if the diesel taxes were taken...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I don't think we are going to have anything like that because we are</p>
<p> not going to do anything that would justify a Liberal or a National</p>
<p> member of the Ministry doing such a thing.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Is there no room for tax cuts if there is no GST?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>If you don't have big change the amount of tax cuts you can make are</p>
<p> reduced. But tax cuts are important but so is having a system that</p>
<p> reduces the cost of our exports. And something that reduces the price</p>
<p> of fuel and something that makes Australia a more attractive place</p>
<p> as a world financial centre.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>But is it possible that in the end there could be a package with no</p>
<p> tax cuts?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I wouldn't support that for one moment. The answer is no.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Higher level?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, that's getting into the detail of it which, forgive me, I'd</p>
<p> rather not speculate about because I am trying to conduct a bona fide</p>
<p> negotiation. There's a lot of good faith on our part and I accept</p>
<p> there's good faith on the part of the Democrats. It's been constructive</p>
<p> but I don't want to unduly raise expectations because we still have</p>
<p> a long way to go and nobody should make any assumptions simply because</p>
<p> the first few hours produced statements to the effect that it has</p>
<p> been very positive and very constructive, which it was.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Last time I spoke to you, about a couple of weeks ago you said you</p>
<p> weren't over confident on getting the GST through. At that stage you</p>
<p> were negotiating with Brian Harradine. Are you more confident now</p>
<p> or less confident?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I don't know that I would put it any more strongly than that. I was</p>
<p> never somebody who believed that Brian Harradine was in the bag and</p>
<p> you were quite right to say that I kept making that observation. Others</p>
<p> seemed a lot more confident than I although I had probably dealt as</p>
<p> successfully with Brian Harradine on other issues as anybody, perhaps</p>
<p> more so. I always believe that there was at the back of his mind a</p>
<p> cultural worry about the sort of change that we had in mind. Even</p>
<p> though he is somebody who in the past has respected the Government's</p>
<p> mandate, and I do think it weighed on him quite heavily that we had</p>
<p> made full disclosure of our policy before the election, and that still</p>
<p> remains the most disappointing part of this whole process.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>The business coalition is reported today as saying that a hybrid tax</p>
<p> on food, sort of, half food wouldn't work. They say they'd rather</p>
<p> drop it, it's sort of all or nothing. Do you agree with that?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, that's really asking me to, that gets into an area that's obviously</p>
<p> under a lot of discussion. Can I just say to the business community,</p>
<p> from our point of view the best option was the one we took to the</p>
<p> public. Now, we would rather get that through but it looks at the</p>
<p> moment as though we can't. And that if we are to have substantial</p>
<p> reform there'll have to be some changes. Now, the point of the negotiations</p>
<p> is to determine whether the sort of changes that would be necessary</p>
<p> to get parliamentary support so alter the package that it no longer</p>
<p> represents the substantial reform that we need. Now, I am, and Peter</p>
<p> Costello and I, are talking to the Australian Democrats about these</p>
<p> issues and we will be making a judgement about that. It's too early</p>
<p> to make that judgement.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>It would seem in a sense that your words are coming back to haunt</p>
<p> you. I suppose that happens in politics though. I mean, food was once</p>
<p> totally non-negotiable.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes, well in...if we had won the last election with a majority in</p>
<p> both Houses and we had been able to get support for the package we</p>
<p> took to the Australian people that would have remained the position.</p>
<p> I mean, I do not willingly...I mean, I don't like what has happened</p>
<p> but I am a pragmatist as well as an idealist. I mean, my ideal was,</p>
<p> in tax reform, was what I took to the public at the last election.</p>
<p> It is now plain that for everybody to see, there is no point in mincing</p>
<p> words about it, that we are not going to get all of that. Now, it's</p>
<p> a question of whether what we can get of that passes the test of substantial</p>
<p> beneficial tax reform. Now, if the words have come back to haunt me,</p>
<p> well they have, I have to live with that. I haven't changed my view</p>
<p> but I have to live within the constraints of the parliamentary system</p>
<p> under which you and I both operate.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Do you think that goes though to the credibility of yourself and Treasurer</p>
<p> in the public view?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, I don't think it does because I think the public still accepts</p>
<p> fully that the Treasurer and I wanted the package we took to the public.</p>
<p> So did they, they voted for it. But they understand and accept that</p>
<p> we can't get that through the Parliament and they therefore believe</p>
<p> that because change is imposed upon us by the non-Coalition majority</p>
<p> in the Senate, if we accept that providing it still delivers fundamental</p>
<p> reform then that doesn't dent our credibility.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>If you don't get a GST in some form through here, is it dead forever?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I don't think there is any doubt that if this attempt fails</p>
<p> it will be the biggest setback in my political lifetime of the cause</p>
<p> of tax reform. I hesitate to say anything is dead forever but in any</p>
<p> circumstance it is always unwise isn't it.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Never ever.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, it's always unwise. Let's put it that way. However, it would</p>
<p> be striking a lethal blow. I mean, I can't imagine that if this attempt</p>
<p> at getting tax reform up falls over I can't see anybody getting within</p>
<p> a bulls roar of this in the next 10 or 20 years.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>And what does that do to Australia?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I think it leaves us poorer economically, less competitive. I think</p>
<p> it loads aspirational Australians with very high levels of personal</p>
<p> income tax at modest income levels. It makes it much harder to attract</p>
<p> the brightest and the best in areas like information technology, we'll</p>
<p> have a bigger brain drain. You have got to think in a globalised economy</p>
<p> you want all these whiz bang experts, you have got to live with the</p>
<p> fact that salaries and tax rates in other countries are a lot more</p>
<p> attractive and if they are drained out of us we'll be all the poorer.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Whatever happens, you are going to have to re-negotiate with the States</p>
<p> aren't you? Because the deal that's been done with the States is predicated</p>
<p> on something which you won't have?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, any removal has ripple effects so the answer is there could</p>
<p> be some ripple effects in relation to the States but the nature of</p>
<p> the arrangement with the States is that they are after the transitional</p>
<p> period substantially better off that's why they signed up.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>If you can't do a deal, if you can't negotiate through the Democrats</p>
<p> there are two options as has been discussed there's an election or</p>
<p> you just say, okay that's it, we can't do it. Which is most likely?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>That's a very hypothetical question which I won't have a go at if</p>
<p> you don't mind.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Do you agree public support is swinging against the GST?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Neil, I think public support ebbs and flows according to what part</p>
<p> of tax reform is under the spotlight. During the election campaign</p>
<p> what was under the spotlight was the national benefit of tax reform.</p>
<p> Over the last few weeks what has been under the spotlight has been</p>
<p> the negatives thrown up by the critics of tax reform. I don't accept</p>
<p> that if you had another debate on the broader aspects that the national</p>
<p> interest benefits wouldn't reassert themselves.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>There'd be a big risk of losing an election though wouldn't there</p>
<p> if you had to fight one on it?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, that's getting back to a hypothetical question. I will say this</p>
<p> about elections. There are certain Constitutional requirements for</p>
<p> resolving deadlocks between the two Houses. But we have a situation</p>
<p> now where it is only eight months since the last election and if you</p>
<p> ask me in a vacuum do I want another election, does the public want</p>
<p> another election. Nobody wants another election when you have only</p>
<p> had one eight months ago, particularly one on the same issue. So all</p>
<p> things being equal, what is the point of having another election?</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>I am told that the party's done polling which shows that support has</p>
<p> swung against the GST and that could cost you an election if you went</p>
<p> to one. Are you aware of that polling?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I never confirm or deny whether the party has done polling nor</p>
<p> what is in it if it has done it.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>If this falls over, is this...I mean, the second leg of it has always</p>
<p> been business tax reform, do you go ahead with that or not?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Oh, very difficult, almost impossible to have serious business tax</p>
<p> reform if this falls over. It's all of a piece and whilst it might</p>
<p> theoretically be possible to do so I think from a practical point</p>
<p> of view, no.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Are the Democrats being reasonable?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>All I want to say at this stage, Neil, is that we have had a good</p>
<p> and constructive discussion. It has been courteous and I am conducting</p>
<p> them in very good faith.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>We'll take a quick break and come back with a couple of quick calls</p>
<p> on the GST then some other issues for the Prime Minister.</p>
<p>[Commercial break]</p>
<p>The Prime Minister is with me, we will take a couple of very quick</p>
<p> calls, please make it quick, we want to just get the point on the</p>
<p> GST specifically, David go ahead.</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, nice to talk to you. I coincidentally had a meeting with</p>
<p> a couple of people from the Tax Department yesterday about the electronic</p>
<p> filing system that they are looking at producing and it is a fantastic</p>
<p> concept, it is really great because the whole basis that we came up</p>
<p> with is that literally you will be able to press one button and it</p>
<p> will file all of your monthly returns with the tax Department.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Yes, David, GST.</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>They're going down the track of trying to simplify everything for</p>
<p> everybody, I think we're all trying to do that. The problem with starting</p>
<p> to put exemptions through, this is just going to over complicate the</p>
<p> situation.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>That is a fair point. That's why our preferred option is not to have</p>
<p> anything other than as broadly based an indirect tax as you can, but</p>
<p> the political reality is that we can't at the moment muster parliamentary</p>
<p> support for that. Now, I can't disagree with you as an issue of principle.</p>
<p> That's all I can say.</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>Thanks David, thanks for calling. Just in terms of what is negotiable,</p>
<p> is the rate negotiable, 10 per cent?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, that's not something that's been talked about.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Is it negotiable?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I certainly think it is the right level myself, that's why we</p>
<p> thought about all of that. We thought anything above it was too high</p>
<p> and we thought anything above it might be seen as lacking credibility,</p>
<p> anything below it lacking credibility in a general sense. But I don't</p>
<p> think anybody is seriously arguing that you can have a general rate</p>
<p> which is different.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Simon, go ahead please.</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>Well, that was my question, is it possible we can raise the rate up</p>
<p> to 11 / 12 per cent and drop the GST on food?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I'm against that because you add further, the higher the rate, the</p>
<p> more you are returning to what is wrong with the present system. The</p>
<p> present system is that you have some very high rates of wholesale</p>
<p> sales tax on a limited number of items and nothing on a whole lot</p>
<p> of items. And that causes enormous distortions and unfairly burdens</p>
<p> one section of producers vis-a-vis others. So, the higher the rate,</p>
<p> the less credible is the reform involved in the change.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Thanks, Simon. Dawn, go ahead please.</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>Yes, Mr Howard, about three weeks ago on this station, you mentioned</p>
<p> self funded retirees and that they would get tax cuts. Well, I can</p>
<p> assure you that very few self funded retirees pay very little or no</p>
<p> tax because of the investments that they are in. And if people are</p>
<p> paying tax, well they don't have a very good financial adviser.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, that's an interesting assertion. I can assure you that I know</p>
<p> lots of self-funded retirees who pay a reasonable amount of tax because</p>
<p> their income is above the tax free zone.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, how much is the food factor in the GST? I was going through</p>
<p> some tapes the other day and there are estimates between about $3.8</p>
<p> billion and $6 billion.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Depends what classification you give it. If you throw in restaurant</p>
<p> meals and the whole shooting match, then it is much higher. If you</p>
<p> have a more limited definition, the Democrats have talked about the</p>
<p> Irish model which is essentially fresh food and anything that doesn't</p>
<p> involve any preparation on the vendors premises, that's the definition</p>
<p> that they are talking about. It's a moveable feast, dare I say it.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>It's very complex when you do that.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, that is why we have argued that you should have it across the</p>
<p> whole lot. I mean, you are singing my song. You have it across the</p>
<p> whole lot and you provide compensation to low income earners. And</p>
<p> the other point to be made is that if food is out that does confer</p>
<p> a benefit on high income earners as well as low income earners because</p>
<p> high income earners even in the fresh food category tend to eat more</p>
<p> expensive food.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Does the negotiations going on at the moment, does it start at the</p>
<p> point of including, I think it was $1.5 billion as negotiated with</p>
<p> Brian Harradine? Is that there?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, the position in relation to that is that we were willing to</p>
<p> put that on top of the package we took to the public at the election,</p>
<p> now obviously if you start taking bits of what we put to the public</p>
<p> at the election away, and you start ruling things out, you don't automatically</p>
<p> just leave that additional compensation exactly where it is, that</p>
<p> really in a sense comes back onto the table. But our position is that</p>
<p> if in the end what is put to the Parliament is the package that we</p>
<p> put to the public at the last election, then we would add to that</p>
<p> what I outlined to Senator Harradine.</p>
<p>MITCHELL:</p>
<p>Is there a chance that we are going to muck this up? With a hybrid</p>
<p> or with nothing?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>We will end up with a second best although perhaps not too far behind,</p>
<p> but nonetheless a second best system, by not embracing what the public</p>
<p> voted for last October. I wouldn't say at this stage we're going to</p>
<p> muck it up because if I thought we were in a situation where we were</p>
<p> going to be mucking it up I wouldn't be involv</p>
