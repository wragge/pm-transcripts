    <content><![CDATA[<p>E&amp;OE...............................................................................................................................</p>
<p>Thank you very much to Captain David Eldridge,</p>
<p>   the Chairman of my Taskforce on Youth Homelessness. To my colleague,</p>
<p>   Warwick Smith, the Minister for Family Services and Senator Helen</p>
<p>   Coonan, a Senator from New South Wales, other representatives, particularly</p>
<p>   of the Sydney City Mission, of other welfare organisations, the</p>
<p>   St Vincent de Paul Society and also to other officers of the Salvation</p>
<p>   Army.</p>
<p>One of the very first things that did as Prime</p>
<p>   Minister was to get together a group of people to launch the taskforce</p>
<p>   into youth homelessness. It was a commitment that I had made in</p>
<p>   a speech I delivered as Opposition Leader to ACOSS late in 1995</p>
<p>   and it arose out of my personal desire after discussion with a lot</p>
<p>   of parents and also with others involved in the welfare field that</p>
<p>   we ought to try and find out whether or not there was some better</p>
<p>   or more improved way of dealing with the challenge of youth homelessness</p>
<p>   and something that more directly focussed on the desirability of</p>
<p>   trying to achieve as much as we possibly could, reconciliation between</p>
<p>   young people who leave home and other members of their families.</p>
<p>We all of course have an idealised view of family</p>
<p>   life. All of us hope that the maximum number of young people in</p>
<p>   the Australian community will experience growing up in a loving,</p>
<p>   secure and stable home environment where the welfare of children</p>
<p>   is the central concern and greatest commitment through life of their</p>
<p>   parents. Now that is the ideal and it is an ideal that is worth</p>
<p>   restating even in the most cynical of times and it's an ideal</p>
<p>   to which all of us should be committed and it's an ideal to</p>
<p>   which all of us should lend our energy because it is indisputable</p>
<p>   that the greatest gift that any young person can have is a loving</p>
<p>   home environment. It provides them with assets for life which cannot</p>
<p>   be matched by anything else. Having stated the ideals we must of</p>
<p>   course recognise that sadly, not all of our young people have the</p>
<p>   opportunity of being given that very secure start in life. Not all</p>
<p>   of our young people are provided with a secure and loving home environment.</p>
<p>There are complex reasons why that secure environment</p>
<p>   is not available in every case. They are the product of changing</p>
<p>   societal attitudes, they are the product of economic difficulty,</p>
<p>   they are the product of unemployment, they are the product of all</p>
<p>   sorts of pressures and what society must do, whilst always reaffirming</p>
<p>   its belief in striving to the ideal in the maximum number of cases,</p>
<p>   what society ought to try and do is to provide a network of help</p>
<p>   and counsel and advice and an understanding to help those people</p>
<p>   who do not have that precious gift that is available to so many</p>
<p>   other young people in the community.</p>
<p>I have spoken in the past few months a great deal</p>
<p>   of the importance of there being a shared endeavour in our community</p>
<p>   between individuals, the Government and the great community organisations</p>
<p>   of modern society. Individuals alone can't always look after</p>
<p>   themselves. Many can but some can't. Through no fault of their</p>
<p>   own they do need help and a compassionate society ought to provide</p>
<p>   that help. The Government alone can't provide that help although</p>
<p>   the Government has a very important role to play. The Government</p>
<p>   has community resources available to it and it has an overall responsibility</p>
<p>   to set the scene and to provide a framework. And the third great</p>
<p>   arm of that shared endeavour is represented here today by magnificent</p>
<p>   organisations such as the Salvation Army, the Society of St Vincent</p>
<p>   de Paul and the various city missions throughout Australia, and</p>
<p>   they are the third very important arm. And one of the significant</p>
<p>   things that I wanted to do in my approach to youth homelessness</p>
<p>   was to involve those organisations to a much greater extent and</p>
<p>   that was because I had the very strong belief that they had more</p>
<p>   coalface experience and a greater practical day to day understanding</p>
<p>   of it than any other group of men and women in our society because</p>
<p>   they deal with it, they deal with it day to day, they understand</p>
<p>   the sense of despair and the sadness and the loneliness and the</p>
<p>   deprivation that is the lot of young people who are afflicted by</p>
<p>   homelessness.</p>
<p>I have also had the opportunity of witnessing the</p>
<p>   joy and the happiness that can come when there is a reconciliation</p>
<p>   between a young person and his or her family members and that is</p>
<p>   the rewarding part of it. I wanted to involve them. I wanted the</p>
<p>   Government to, by setting up the taskforce, demonstrate its commitment</p>
<p>   to this particular issue. I also wanted there to be a greater understanding</p>
<p>   of the sense of alienation that some parents in the past had felt</p>
<p>   towards the process of assessing the entitlement of young people</p>
<p>   to the youth homelessness allowance. I had had many complaints as</p>
<p>   a Member of Parliament in my own electorate and also in my position</p>
<p>   as Opposition Leader from parents who said that the process shut</p>
<p>   them out, that if one of their family members left home and sought</p>
<p>   the allowance, they often were shut out of the process, they didn't</p>
<p>   feel part of it. They felt that they were held responsible totally</p>
<p>   without having an opportunity of putting their case. </p>
<p>I have heard reports from all around Australia</p>
<p>   from my colleagues of angry meetings of parents complaining about</p>
<p>   a process that had shut them out and with so many of these things,</p>
<p>   there was of course an element of truth in that. There was also</p>
<p>   in some cases an element of exaggeration so I wanted one of the</p>
<p>   things, one of the elements of this task force's work to be</p>
<p>   a focus on ways in which the parents of children who were homeless</p>
<p>   could feel part of the process, could feel that an adverse judgement</p>
<p>   was not automatically being made on them and that they were given</p>
<p>   an opportunity of putting their point of view, of understanding</p>
<p>   the process but above everything else, an emphasis on reconciliation,</p>
<p>   of early intervention and of involving community groups. And out</p>
<p>   of that taskforce came the launch of a series of pilot projects</p>
<p>   that the Government funded all around Australia and one of those</p>
<p>   pilot projects of course is represented here today and that is a</p>
<p>   pilot project which is a joint endeavour of the Salvation Army in</p>
<p>   Sydney and of the Sydney City Mission, and it's an example</p>
<p>   of how a different approach can produce results. This is an area</p>
<p>   of course where you have to work very hard to get sometimes only</p>
<p>   a modest return.</p>
<p> There are successes but there are also a lot of failures. But the</p>
<p>   most important thing is that there is a shared commitment represented</p>
<p>   here today between a lot of individuals who have been sadly touched</p>
<p>   by the problem of youth homelessness. Amongst the audience are some</p>
<p>   young people who are part of the group that we are trying to help.</p>
<p>   There are also parents of those young people who are also people</p>
<p>   who are equally deserving of help and understanding. There's</p>
<p>   also here of course the representatives of the organisations who</p>
<p>   are so very directly involved and finally, of course, there's</p>
<p>   the Government, and in that old cliche the Government's always</p>
<p>   here to help but what we are trying to do with this is to get a</p>
<p>   better of understanding of a very significant human problem. </p>
<p>We gather here today in the largest city in Australia.</p>
<p>   It's a very beautiful city and there's a lot to be proud</p>
<p>   of to be a citizen of Sydney as most of us who are here today, we</p>
<p>   are citizens of Sydney as well as firstly and most importantly being</p>
<p>   Australians. But it's also a fact of life that in any big city</p>
<p>   there's a lot of loneliness and there's a lot of individual</p>
<p>   sadness and there are a lot of people who are reaching out for help</p>
<p>   and above all, they want company and they want understanding and</p>
<p>   I have had many discussions over the time that I have been Prime</p>
<p>   Minister with people involved in trying to help young people and</p>
<p>   I have talked to people who have been involved in providing help</p>
<p>   line services.</p>
<p>I remember talking to a De La Salle brother who</p>
<p>   is involved in the running of a help line service in Brisbane and</p>
<p>   what he told me was that the most common area of assistance that</p>
<p>   people wanted when they rang up was help in how to relate more effectively</p>
<p>   and how to communicate more effectively with their parents and their</p>
<p>   brothers and sisters and their friends. And it's a very simple</p>
<p>   yet rather sad thing that what is so obviously lacking in the lives</p>
<p>   of many people is the opportunity and the capacity to talk to the</p>
<p>   people you want to talk to most. All of us I think are inadequate</p>
<p>   sometimes in expressing our feelings. All of us are inadequate in</p>
<p>   communicating effectively with people we should communicate effectively</p>
<p>   with. Of course one of the reasons, as you all know, that people</p>
<p>   leave home and one of the reasons why families break down and children</p>
<p>   no longer think that they have anything much in common with their</p>
<p>   parents and vice versa is a simple difficulty in communication and</p>
<p>   a failure to understand each other and a failure to be able to talk</p>
<p>   directly to each other.</p>
<p>I do not claim and my Government does not claim</p>
<p>   for a moment to have the answers, all of the answers to the problem</p>
<p>   of youth homelessness. We do have a commitment to try some new ways</p>
<p>   of tackling the problem. We recognise it, it flows in part from</p>
<p>   economic circumstances. We recognise in part that it flows from</p>
<p>   changed attitudes towards individual responsibility. We recognise</p>
<p>   that it flows in part from different generational attitudes towards</p>
<p>   the authority of parents and the relationship between children and</p>
<p>   parents. There are a whole lot of reasons but we're very genuine</p>
<p>   in our desire to find some of those answers. We are very grateful</p>
<p>   for Captain Eldridge's personal contribution and also the contribution</p>
<p>   of the other members of his taskforce. He comes as so many people</p>
<p>   in this room do, from a great Christian organisation, from an organisation</p>
<p>   that is committed to the welfare of young people within our community</p>
<p>   and I very warmly thank him and all of his colleagues.</p>
<p>I am very happy to announce, ladies and gentlemen,</p>
<p>   that I have informed my colleague, Warwick Smith that we are going</p>
<p>   to extend the funding and therefore the continuity of the pilot</p>
<p>   programmes by providing an additional $2.3 million and that will</p>
<p>   allow funding to go on for another six months. We've done that</p>
<p>   because we think the pilot programmes are so successful and they</p>
<p>   have provided so many new insights and better understandings, and</p>
<p>   given a better emphasis on the importance of reconciliation, not</p>
<p>   to pretend for a moment that the ideal always exists because plainly</p>
<p>   it doesn't. There are many sad examples of where it doesn't</p>
<p>   exist but equally, to recognise that if we can give a greater emphasis</p>
<p>   to reconciliation between parents and children, to the role of great</p>
<p>   organisations, I think all of us would be very grateful.</p>
<p>So could I end again by thanking all of you who</p>
<p>   have contributed. I want to thank the representatives of the Department</p>
<p>   of Family Services and their Minister, Warwick, for the contribution</p>
<p>   that they have made. It is a partnership and it does involve individuals,</p>
<p>   the Government and organisations. I do want to thank the Salvation</p>
<p>   Army, the Brotherhood of St Laurence, the Wesley Central Mission,</p>
<p>   the Society of St Vincent de Paul, Anglicare and of course the Independent</p>
<p>   City Missions of Australia, and indeed, all others who contributed.</p>
<p>   And I thank the young people and the parents who have been touched</p>
<p>   by this programme, I hope in a beneficial way, for their attendance.</p>
<p>   It's a very important, personal commitment of mine and of my</p>
<p>   Government and I hope it can be said that it has made a difference</p>
<p>   and it has contributed to a better understanding of an immensely</p>
<p>   challenging human and social issue in modern Australia.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>ENDS</p>
