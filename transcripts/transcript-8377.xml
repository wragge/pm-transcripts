PRIME MINISTER] 3/ 92<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON. P. J. KEATING, MP<br />
MEETINGS WITH BUSINESS, UNION LEADERS<br />
Over the next two weeks I will be meeting chief executives<br />
of some of Australia's largest companies as well as<br />
representatives of small business and trade unions to listen<br />
to their ideas for bringing forward the economic recovery.<br />
I will be joined in these meetings by the Treasurer, Mr<br />
Dawkins, the Minister for Finance, Mr Willis and the<br />
Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce, Senator<br />
Button. The national meetings are the first step in what will be a<br />
concerted effort by my Government to hear the ideas of those<br />
who will play a major role in getting Australia back to<br />
work. I<br />
The first meetings will take place in Melbourne next<br />
Wednesday ( Jan. 15) and Thursday ( Jan. 16).<br />
Further talks will be held in Sydney the following Monday<br />
( Jan. 20) arid Tuesday ( Jan. 21).<br />
As the Economic Statement is developed I and other Ministers<br />
will consult more widely with business, unions and other<br />
groups throughout Australia.<br />
Those involved in the talks are people from some of our most<br />
dynamic enterprises, large and small, and many executives<br />
have made special efforts to be available to meet with<br />
Government at short notice.<br />
There is a growing sense of purpose and enthusiasm being<br />
directed to our national economic problem and these meetings<br />
will do much to encourage that enthusiasm.<br />
The speed of the recovery and our ability to create jobs<br />
quickly wil. l be greatly influenced by these companies. </p>
<p>2<br />
For that reason it is important the Government has a clear<br />
picture of what their plans are and what is happening across<br />
the economy as a whole.<br />
The meetings will be with individual chief executives and in<br />
some cases with small groups.<br />
All Melbourne meetings will be held in the Prime Minister's<br />
office in Treasury Place, starting about 9.30 a. m. on both<br />
Wednesday and Thursday and finishing about 3.30-4 p. m. each<br />
day. Media will be notified of further details for the Melbourne<br />
meetings ( p: cfacs, list of participants etc.) early this<br />
week. Arrangements for the Sydney meetings will be finalised later<br />
in the week,<br />
12 January 1992 </p>
