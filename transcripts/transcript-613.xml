FOR TH138 1020<br />
INCREASED COAL EXPORTS TO JAPAN<br />
Statement by the Acting Prime Minister and Minister<br />
for National Development, Senator W. H. Spooner, M. M.<br />
The New South Wales coalmining industry had increased its<br />
trade with Japan at the expense of the United States, the<br />
Minister for National Development, Senator Snoonor, said in<br />
Cessnock yesterday.<br />
The American share of coal exports to Japan had fallen from<br />
60.2% in 1960 to 53.4% in 1961, he said.<br />
Australia in 3960 supplied 16.6/ o of Japanese coal imports,<br />
but by 1961 the proportion had risen to 23.<br />
" This is a feather in the cap of the New South Wales<br />
coalmining industry," the Minister said. " But we will need to<br />
fight hard to maintain this trade. Export business is always<br />
fiercely competitive.<br />
" We can expect to be challenged for the Japanese market.<br />
This is why, when the New South Wales Minister for Mines,<br />
Mr. J. B. Simpson, and I went to Japan two years ago we<br />
arranged with the Japanese steel industry to purchase their<br />
coal requirements on long-term contracts in consideration of our<br />
respective governments pushing ahead with the port<br />
reconstruction prograrmme at Newcastle, Port Kembla and Balmain.<br />
" The main proportion of this expenditure falls upon the<br />
New South Wales Government. But I am glad to say that the<br />
Commonwealth is providing Å 1 million as a grant to New South<br />
Wales and lending another Å 1,650,000."<br />
Senator Spooner was speaking at the inauguration of a new<br />
bowling green at Cessnock, With Mr. Simpson, the Minister for<br />
Mines, he handed the green over to the Cessnock Bowling Club<br />
on behalf of their respective governments.<br />
The Senator said that Australia faced great changes which<br />
would follow Britain's entry into the Common Market, They would<br />
necessitate re-thinking, and some readjustment of many of<br />
Australia's trading activities<br />
" We have anticipated this," he said. " Much has been done<br />
already and in particular the coal industry has given a national<br />
lead. " We foresaw the effect in local markets of competitive fuels.<br />
We sought export business and sought it successfullyo<br />
" Six years ago the total overseas sales from the State was<br />
204,000 tons. In -; 96-1/ 62 we sold more than 3,162,000 tons<br />
overseas, Although it is unlikely that we will repeat this<br />
level this year, yet we anticipate that we shall sell approximatel.<br />
2 million tons, and the Joint Coal Board is confident that there<br />
will be steady increases thereafter."<br />
The Minister went on to speak of great improvements<br />
which had occurred in the coalmining industry in the past few<br />
years: Coal was in ample supply;<br />
Quality of coal had been improved by the introduction<br />
of washeries and treatment plants;<br />
Coal prices were about -15% lower than they were in 1952;<br />
o There had been a great decline in industrial disputes,<br />
In 1949/ 50 the percentage of possible manshifts lost<br />
was 14.28%, whereas the figure was down to 1.91% on<br />
June 30, 1961, ooo<br />
L </p>
<p>2<br />
One of the contributing causes for these big improvements had<br />
been the betterment of social amenities on the coalfields. These<br />
had been made poEsible by grants from the Welfare Fund of the<br />
Joint Coal Board.<br />
The Federal Government had contributed Å 1,890,000 to the<br />
Fund, and the N. S, W. Government Å 969,502: a total of Å 2,860,402<br />
by the two governments.<br />
The Welfare Fund had contributed to the capital cost of the<br />
new Cessnock bowling green to the extent of Å 1,000, which had<br />
been provided in equal shares by the Commnonwealtn and State<br />
Governments. Other guests invited to the special luncheon and handing-over<br />
ceremony included Mr. G, NEILLY, Mr. K. BOOTH, M. L. A.;<br />
Mr. A. JAMES, M. HR,; Messrso S. C. COCHRAN, S. FLOWERS and B. W.<br />
HARTNELL, of t-he Joint Coal Board; the Mayor of Cessnock,<br />
Alderman BROWN, and the Deputy Mayor, Alderman BLAIR; Mr. J. W.<br />
STEPHENSON, Town Clerk, and Inspector SEWELLo<br />
