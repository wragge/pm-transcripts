FOR PRESS PM. No. 60u1968<br />
NATIONAL EXPORT WEEK<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister, Mr John Gorton<br />
A National Export Week will be held from 14th 19th<br />
October of this year. The Week, which will be sponsored by the Export<br />
Development Council, will be aimed primarily at an expansion of exports<br />
of manufactures. There will be extensive contacts with manufacturers<br />
during this week in each State in the Commonwealth. These activities<br />
will include seminars, workshops and lectures on all practical aspects of<br />
exports and marketing. The Export Development Council will be responsible<br />
for organising the Week and the venture will have the full support and<br />
encouragement of the Government. I will launch the National Export<br />
Week at a gathering in Canberra on 11th Oc-tober.<br />
While a number of Australia's manufacturers have<br />
demonstrated outstanding export performance, there is a surprisingly<br />
large number exporting very little or nothing at all. In a growing country<br />
such as Australia, increased exports of manufactures will do much to<br />
strengthen the economy.<br />
