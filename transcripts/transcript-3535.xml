Press Statement No. 404<br />
9 December 1974<br />
Industries Assistance Commission Report<br />
Woven Man-Made Fibre Fabrics<br />
The Prime Minister, Mr Whitlam, today announced<br />
the Government's decision on the report of the Industries<br />
Assistance Commission on Woven Man-Made Fibre Fabrics.<br />
Mr Whitlam said that the Government accepted the<br />
long-term level of assistance of 40% for " traditional"<br />
fabrics of nylon or polyester but not polyolefin) as<br />
recommended by the Commission but because of problems<br />
presently being experienced by the industry it had been<br />
decided to introduce as from today tariff quotas on a<br />
short-term basis. On polyolefin fabrics the Government has<br />
accepted the recommended long-term level of assistance of<br />
22.5% but decided to reduce the present rate to this level<br />
over a two year period.<br />
The Government decided not to accept the supplementary<br />
recommendations received from the Industries Assistance Commission<br />
for an increase in tariff levels for certain fabrics for 12 months<br />
as it considered that the arrangements for tariff quotas should<br />
adequately achieve the necessary short-term protection for the<br />
industry. Mr Whitlam said that the Government had also decided<br />
to extend duty-free admission under by-law to certain light-weight<br />
fabrics including some used in the production of school uniforms.<br />
The Minister for Manufacturing Industry will have<br />
responsibility for the policy aspects of the administration of<br />
tariff quotas and he will announce detailed arrangements in the<br />
near future. Mr Whitlam said that details of the customs tariff<br />
changes arising from the Government's decision will be announced<br />
when administrative arrangements to implement them have been<br />
finalised. 2/. </p>

The Government has also decided to prescribe the<br />
industry producing woven man-made fibre fabrics as being<br />
eligible for structural adjustment assistance.<br />
