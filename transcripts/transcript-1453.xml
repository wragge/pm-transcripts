    <content><![CDATA[<p><strong>P. M. No. 121/ 1966</strong></p>
<p>The Hon. Hubert Opperman, OBE., MP., will be Australia's First High Commissioner to Malta. The formal agreement of the Government of Malta to his appointment has now been received. Malta<br />is an independent country and a member of the Commonwealth of Nations. </p>
<p>The decision of the Commonwealth Government to establish a High Commission in Valetta was announced by me at the time of the recent visit to this country of the Prime Minister of Malta, the Hon. Dr. Gorgio<br />Borg Olivier. Australia and Malta have close links from their Commonwealth membership and the steady flow of migrants from Malta to this country.</p>
<p>There is in Australia at this time the largest number of persons of Maltese descent outside Malta itself.</p>
<p>I am sure Mr. Opperman will give the same able and devoted public service to Australia in this important new sphere as he has always revealed in his Parliamentary and Ministerial capacities.</p>
<p>CANBERRA,<br />15 December, 1966 I</p>
