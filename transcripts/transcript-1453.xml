    <content><![CDATA[<p><strong>P. M. No. 121/ 1966</strong></p>
<p>The Hon. Hubert Opperman, OBE., MP., will be Australia'sÂ First High Commissioner to Malta. The formal agreement of theÂ Government of Malta to his appointment has now been received. Malta<br />is an independent country and a member of the Commonwealth of Nations.Â </p>
<p>The decision of the Commonwealth Government to establish aÂ High Commission in Valetta was announced by me at the time of the recentÂ visit to this country of the Prime Minister of Malta, the Hon. Dr. Gorgio<br />Borg Olivier. Australia and Malta have close links from their CommonwealthÂ membership and the steady flow of migrants from Malta to this country.</p>
<p>There is in Australia at this time the largest number of persons ofÂ Maltese descent outside Malta itself.</p>
<p>I am sure Mr. Opperman will give the same able and devotedÂ public service to Australia in this important new sphere as he has alwaysÂ revealed in his Parliamentary and Ministerial capacities.</p>
<p>CANBERRA,<br />15Â December, 1966 I</p>
