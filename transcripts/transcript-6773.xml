SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
INAUGURAL BULLETIN BLACK AND WHITE ARTISTS AWARDS<br />
1 NOVEMBER 1985 SYDNEY<br />
Mr and Mrs Kennedy, Honoured Guests,<br />
I very much appreciate the opportunity to be here tonight<br />
for this, the inaugural national awards for australian<br />
cartooning, sponsored by " the bulletin" and named in honour<br />
of the great Stan Cross.<br />
I say I appreciate the opportunity because, at the very<br />
least, being here tonight gives me the chance to turn the<br />
spot-light on to a few of those who have so unkindly, and<br />
terribly unreasonably put me in the spot-light<br />
over the last few years.<br />
I understand that in the audience tonight are, for a start,<br />
the cartoonists from most of the major metropolitan dailies.<br />
excellent. I can expect to see blank spots next to the<br />
editorial columns tomorrow.<br />
As a politician, most interest for me tonight extends to-the<br />
award for the best political cartoon. because I'm not a<br />
financial member of the black and white artists, I'm not<br />
eligible to vote. Although, since I feature so much in your<br />
work, perhaps you should give me honorary membership. </p>
<p>of course, if I, had that membership, I might be more<br />
inclined to vote for an artist there must be some around<br />
who spends more time analysing the obvious deficiencies of<br />
some of my esteemed opponents, than on noting any passing<br />
foibles on the part of me or my colleagues.<br />
AS I say, political cartooning is the area of principal<br />
interest for me.<br />
Cartoonists have developed their talents in the field of<br />
political analysis for hundreds of years. In Australia, we<br />
have been particularly blessed or cursed, depending on<br />
your perspective with a long history of biting, satirical<br />
political commentary in the form of cartoons. One cartoon<br />
can leave an impact more potent and longer lasting than a<br />
1,000 words.<br />
Since 1855, with the arrival of " Melbourne Punch",<br />
Australians have been offered incisive social commentary by<br />
a vast range of black-and-white artists, enlivened by the<br />
wit of a brash new colonial culture.<br />
The pace of Australian cartooning picked up further with the<br />
advent of " The Bulletin" in 1880.<br />
There could be no more appropriate sponsor for tonight's<br />
awards than " The Bulletin". Its association with the cream<br />
of australia's literary and drawing talent extends over more<br />
than a century, and has been described accurately, in my<br />
view-as providing the literary genesis for a substantial<br />
part of Australia's national culture.<br />
The famous black-and-white artists of early " Bulletin"<br />
history are legendary figures in the history of Australian<br />
drawings and cartoons. Livingstone Hopkins or " Hop" as he<br />
was known to many Phil May, Will Dyson, Norman Lindsay,<br />
and the great david low all received their early chance at<br />
success, and the basis for illustrious careers, from " The<br />
Bulletin" In later years, others arose to take their place including<br />
of course, Stan Cross whose classic sketch forms the<br />
physical representation of tonight's awards.<br />
Stan Cross is probably best known for " The Potts" family, a<br />
series which continues even today, a testament to Stan<br />
cross' judgement of the humour which appeals to all<br />
Australians. his " Dad and Dave" works, during the<br />
depression years, their bittersweet humour an accurate<br />
reflection of the times, they live on today untarnished by<br />
time.<br />
And later of course, " Wally and the Major", commenced early<br />
in World War II, became an institution for Australian<br />
newspaper readers. </p>
<p>3<br />
The famous sketch which is physically represented in<br />
tonights' awards is rightly recognised as encapsulating all<br />
the essential elements of genuine wit as it has developed<br />
uniquely in Australia. Although it first appeared over<br />
years ago, this classic scene of two of Australia's early<br />
larrikin construction workers, dangling precariously and<br />
without ceremony or safety from the beams of a<br />
partly-completed skyscraper, retains its full measure of<br />
humour and social commentary today. ( perhaps they were<br />
hanging up a Eureka Flag). that the humour of the piece<br />
exceeds its social commentary is perhaps a further apt<br />
comment on the Australian ethos. We admire most in<br />
ourselves the ability to recognise the humour of a<br />
situation, even in adversity.<br />
The issues of the day in Australian cartooning have varied<br />
little over the period since this sketch was first published<br />
in 1933: pollution, corruption, women's liberation,<br />
immigration, sport and of course politicians have all stood<br />
the test of time and remain as much with us today as they<br />
were then.<br />
And the talent of Australian cartoonists, with their sharp<br />
pencils and sharper wits, exposing the pomposity,<br />
self-delusion and plain bad judgement which so often has<br />
characterised debate on questions such as these remains with<br />
us also.<br />
I have no doubt that the recipients of awards here tonight,<br />
and indeed all members of the Black-and-White Artists' Club,<br />
will maintain the high standard established by their<br />
illustrious predecessors, encouraged by the judgement of<br />
their peers on occasions such as this.<br />
It is now my great pleasure to open these envelopes<br />
containing the winners' names and to present the awards. </p>
