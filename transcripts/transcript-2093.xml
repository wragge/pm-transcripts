STATE COUNCIL MEETING OF THE VICTORIAN<br />
DIVISION OF THE LIBERAL PARTY<br />
Melbourne, Vic. JULY 1969<br />
Speech by the Prime Minister, Mr. John' Gorton<br />
Mr. President, Mr. Premier and Delegates:-<br />
This is, as the President has said, merely a fleeting visit.<br />
I have to be in Queensland by lunchtime, then have a meeting of the<br />
Women's Sections from all over Queensland, and then attend a fund-raising<br />
dinner for one of our candidates. So you can see, it is not an uncrowded<br />
day. But this part of it is one that I would not, for anything, have missed.<br />
I speak to you at a time only some months before there will<br />
be a decision made by the Australian people as to what Government will<br />
carry them on and through those exciting seventies which beckon to us now.<br />
It is my hope, and my belief, that with your help the Australian people will<br />
choose as their pilots through these years ahead a government which<br />
continues those policies and those philosophies which have, over the last<br />
twenty years, transformed this nation; a government which will adopt new<br />
approaches and policies to take full advantage of those great opportunities<br />
which await us. It is a little inhibiting speaking to you on the eve of a Budget,<br />
but perhaps I might remind you of some of the things which have been done<br />
in the space of very little more than a year or eighteen months, things<br />
which already indicate, I think, the courses we will take in the future. I<br />
would remind you that we have adopted an entirely new approach to the<br />
system of building road communications throughout Australia and Victoria,,<br />
and this is an important avenue of approach, not just a gimmick. For the<br />
first time, there has been a cost-benef it analysis of the construction of<br />
roads and where they should be. For the first time there is no longer a<br />
requirement that a fixed amount of the total road money available whether<br />
it Is of cost-benef it or not should be spent in particular areas, and for<br />
the first time there is a requirement that the congestion of the cities should<br />
be relieved by a proper road programme. Accompanying these new<br />
approaches has been the addition of half a billion dollars for the road<br />
programme.<br />

We have, let me remind you, taken the not inconsiderable<br />
policy decision to enter, or perhaps I should say re-enter, the field of<br />
overseas shipping so that Australia will have ships plying with Australian<br />
produce between this country and Japan, between this country and the<br />
United Kingdom, between this country and the United States. And this will<br />
not only be profitable, it will save invisibles in our import bill. And it<br />
will also enable us to know precisely what the economics of this trade are<br />
and to see that our producers, and to this extent I speak of our primary<br />
producers for they provide the bulk of our exports to see that our<br />
producers are not mulcted by freight charges higher than they should be.<br />
We have accepted a responsibility in the new changed<br />
situation to our north, although let us make it quite plain that we cannot<br />
take over the role of sheriff which Britain had. But we will be clearly<br />
seen to be members of the posse and have there in that region, visible<br />
Ifor all to see, an. Australian presence. And these were not easy decisions<br />
to make, and are but some of those new approaches in this relatively brief<br />
I would add just one more to them before I leave. We have,<br />
I think, already shown our awareness in a practical way of those of whom<br />
I have so often spoken and those whom I believe you think of so often that<br />
is the handicapped amongst us, the ill, the aged. This will continue, and<br />
it will continue in the seventies at an increasing tempo, with more people<br />
coming in ( for our immigration programme is already a record), with<br />
more development taking place, with more overseas capital required to do<br />
it and more Australian ownership being offered in that development and<br />
the key word is " offered". And as those material goals before us are<br />
reached, we will not only seek to look after those ill and aged of whom I<br />
have spoken, but try to see if we cannot improve the quality of life in<br />
-' Australia, as the material resources of Australia grow. And by the<br />
quality of life I mean the opportunity for people to train themselves for<br />
whatever field of endeavour they may wish to enter. If they wish to train<br />
to be a television producer, a film actor, a plumber, a carpenter, a farmer,<br />
in the field of business management, a scientist whatever it is they wish<br />
to be; that opportunity to receive the necessary training is what we would<br />
wish to see provided as part of the quality of life. And to try to see that<br />
our younger people are brought up with the opportunity not only to achieve<br />
that of which I have spoken but to take part in outdoor activities surfing,<br />
skiing, riding, in whatever it may be that Is a healthy outdoor interest<br />
and is as much a part of the quality of life as is intellectural attainment.<br />
These things become easier as material resources grow,<br />
but they are an integral part of a full life in a nation such as Australia,<br />
and will be achieved under the leadership of the Liberal Party, and with<br />
the help and assistance which you of the Branches, however you may<br />
differ on minor matters, are united to give us. </p>

Pill Wh~ at a difference there is between those of you in this hall<br />
who will argue out matters of detail but on matters of ideology the climate<br />
which provides employment and growth are as one. What a difference<br />
between some other meeting, which I seem to have heard is taking place<br />
somewhere or other in Melbourne, where the whole of the time appears to<br />
be devoted to pretending that those deep schisms which exist don't exist<br />
and can be papered over and can be hidden for at least long enough to<br />
pretend to the people there is something difference from what there really<br />
is. We will come before you, as we always have, putting<br />
programmes that can be achieved without inflation and without pretence. We<br />
will make no promises that can't be carried out. But if I may, just before<br />
I close, be a little repetitive, I would like to bring to the attention of those<br />
of you who have not already read it, a little piece of doggerel I wrote at<br />
Question Time one day in the House no-one was asking me questions at<br />
the time, so I thought I would put the time to good use: which seems to<br />
me to put in one nutshell the different approach of our opponents, particularly<br />
their Leader. And the little piece of nonsense runs like this and of<br />
course you will understand it is in the mouth of the Leader of the Opposition<br />
I promise you, I promise you<br />
To do anything at all you want me to<br />
And if I get rather lost<br />
As to how much it will cost<br />
I can always raise taxation<br />
On guess who? You.<br />
Well, you think of it and he'll promise it. But this will not be our approach.<br />
It would not be the approach you wanted. It would not be the approach you<br />
would support. But with that support you give us and I thank you for it<br />
now I am sure that we will see, with the team of candidates we have,<br />
that towards the end of this year there will be opening for Australia three<br />
more years of Increasingly exciting government and increasingly exciting<br />
development for this nation which we all love. </p>
