ASSISTANCE FOR NEW FIELDS OF MEDICAL RESEARCH<br />
Statement by the Prime minister, the Rt Hon. William<br />
McMahon, M. P.<br />
The Government has approved substantially increased grants<br />
for medical research. This includes special Provision for research<br />
into diseases and conditions responsible for the death and chronic<br />
illness of many Australians.<br />
The total grants approved of $ 13.5 million over the next<br />
three years represent a $ 6.5 million increase over the amount<br />
granted to the National Health and Medical Research Council for<br />
medical research in the last triennium.<br />
The major innovation in this substantial expansion of the<br />
Commonwealth's support for medical research is in the first of the<br />
three major categories of research provided for.<br />
Within this category of special needs which are not<br />
currently supported, a total of $ 2.67 million is to be made<br />
available to initiate research under the following headings:-<br />
Psychiatric illness, which has become a major medical<br />
problem in our community.<br />
Cardia-vascular disease, the largest single health problem<br />
confronting Australians.<br />
Viral and renal diseases<br />
Infectious hepatitis<br />
Arthritis, which is a major cause of chronic illness<br />
Asthma, bronchitis and hay fever, the most prevalent<br />
respiratory conditions<br />
Accidents, including traffic, domestic, occupational and<br />
recreational accidents.<br />
Addiction to drugs and alcohol. / 2 </p>
<p>a 2.<br />
T7he second category relates -to support for certain medical<br />
research institutes i--n Australia which have developed specialised,<br />
in-depth programmes of notable achievement.<br />
Thle Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of 1fAedica1 Research and<br />
the Howard Florey Institute of Expkerimcntal Physiology and<br />
Medicine have established outstanding world-wide reputations,<br />
and contributed significantly to improve our knowledge in thei r<br />
fields and we want to ensure that support for them is continued.<br />
Finally, we have agreed. to continue support for traditional<br />
areas of medical research through scholarships, overseas fellowships,<br />
and equipment grants as well as the maintenance of current<br />
research activities in universities, hospitals, institutes,<br />
government departments, and by individual doctors and dentists.<br />
In these last two cateqori the increase in assistance is<br />
more than fifty per cent compared with the previous triennium.<br />
The Government is confident that these grants will provide a real<br />
stimulus for medical research.<br />
It is another in a series of significant Government<br />
initiatives over a wide range of public health problems.<br />
The Commonwealth has already taken warning action related<br />
to the hazards to health of smoking in new requirements for<br />
television advertising. We have also recently announced<br />
substantially increased grants for heakt and cancer research.<br />
