THE PRIME MINISTER, MR WHITLAM, THIS EVENING<br />
RELEASED THE TEXT OF HIS LETTER TO MR JUSTICE<br />
WILLIAMS, CHAIRMAN OF THE PRICES JUSTIFICATION<br />
TRIBUNAL, REFERRED TO IN HIS STATEMENT ON<br />
THE ECONOMY.<br />
THE TEXT OF THE LETTER IS ATTACHED.<br />
CANBERRA 13 November 1974. </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER CANBERRA<br />
12 NC"' 14<br />
My dear Judge, I am writing at this time to convey to you<br />
officially the concern with which the Government regards<br />
the present economic situation, particularly in relation<br />
to private investment and employment.<br />
The Government is now undertaking a number of<br />
measures to deal with this situation, and I am this<br />
evening making a statement in Parliament on the subject.<br />
A copy of this statement is being sent to you for your<br />
information. As you will see, I emphasise the complexity of<br />
the problems confronting us and the fact that rapid<br />
inflation is now accompanied by rising unemployment and<br />
a falling away in private investment on which economic<br />
growth and continued prosperity greatly depend. I also<br />
refer to the particular problem that, in considering<br />
new investment projects, businesses are concerned about<br />
the prospects of maintaining worthwhile returns, not just<br />
in the immediate future, but over the whole life of the<br />
investment concerned, subject to normal market risks.<br />
I therefore undertook to write to you indicating<br />
the Government's view that, in the present economic<br />
circumstances, the Prices Justification Tribunal should<br />
give particular attention to the problems of sustaining<br />
and stimulating an adequate level of private investment<br />
and of maintaining rates of return on capital which will<br />
induce the new investment required to maintain economic<br />
growth and employment.<br />
The comments that I have made are not intended<br />
in any way to reflect on the manner in which the Tribunal<br />
is carrying out its statutory responsibilities. Indeed,<br />
the Government has confidence in the Tribunal's judgement<br />
and responsiveness to the changing economic situation in<br />
/ 2 </p>
<p>2<br />
considering particular prices or price increases, and<br />
has no intention of changing its basic functions. In<br />
particular, the Government appreciates that the Tribunal<br />
has played an important part in curbing inflation and<br />
there can be no doubt that it has been successful in<br />
restraining prices below the level that would otherwise<br />
have applied. While, therefore, it is desirable to make<br />
clear the importance that the Government attaches to<br />
investment and employment matters, it is of course<br />
intended that the Tribunal should continue to act, in<br />
accordance with its statutory responsibilities, to<br />
ensure that prices are not set at levels which are higher<br />
than are properly justifiable and that companies are not<br />
passing on in prices avoidable increases in costs.<br />
Yours sincerely,<br />
t-G<br />
E. G. WHITLAM<br />
The Hon. Mr. Justice L. H. Williams,<br />
Chairman, Prices Justification Tribunal,<br />
Queens Road,<br />
MELBOURNE. VIC. 3004 </p>
