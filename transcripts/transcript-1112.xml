COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA 6 r/ 077<br />
SPEECH<br />
The Rt. Hon. SIR ROBERT MENZIES,<br />
M. P.,<br />
ON THE<br />
SECOND READING<br />
OF THE<br />
STATES GRANTS ( TECHNICAL TRAINING)<br />
BILL 1965<br />
[ From the Parliamentary Debates 1 8th May 1965]<br />
Sir ROBERT MENZIES ( Kooyong-<br />
Prime Minister) [ 8.11l].-1 move-<br />
That the Bitt be now read a second time.<br />
This Bill extends for the next three financial<br />
years the grants for State technical colleges<br />
and schools first given by authority of the<br />
~ tates Grants ( Science Laboratories and<br />
Wechnical Training) Act 1964. As with the<br />
science grants œ 5 million will be provided<br />
each year and the distribution between States<br />
remains unchanged. These grants are given<br />
in an area where independent schools do not<br />
perate, and the grants are confined there-<br />
. ore to State institutions. They are intended<br />
to facilitate the training of young men and<br />
women in trades schools and technical colleges.<br />
Trades schools include schools of<br />
automotive engineering, printing schools,<br />
school' s teaching carpentry and joinery and<br />
many other skills.<br />
Experience of the first year of this programme<br />
has indicated that it fills a most<br />
important place in the Australian educational<br />
scene. For every scientist or tech-<br />
5831/ 65 nologist, many highly skilled technicians and<br />
tradesmen have to be trained. The equipment<br />
to train these people must be adequate<br />
in quantity and up-to-date in quality. It has<br />
become clear in the course of the first year's<br />
administration of the scheme that equipment<br />
has been neither adequate nor up to<br />
date. The size of the Commonwealth grant<br />
in relation to past State allocations for technical<br />
training has been so generous that the<br />
States have found considerable difficulty in<br />
stepping up their construction and equipment<br />
programmes within the first year of<br />
the scheme. But with the assurance of three<br />
more years of finance at this level, they will<br />
be able within that time to make a substantial<br />
impression on the needs for wellequipped<br />
training facilities.<br />
Some examples of the States' proposals<br />
for the new triennium will illustrate the<br />
nature of the programme which this Bill will<br />
facilitate. In New South Wales work will<br />
be undertaken at colleges in Cooma, Wauchope,<br />
Wollongong, Gunnedah, Newcastle, </p>
<p>Cowra, Leeton and Blacktown, as well as<br />
in the metropolitan area, and much equipment<br />
will be installed. In Victoria, the State<br />
has made proposals for the grants to be<br />
spent in a number of technical schools and<br />
colleges on building and equipment to teach<br />
science, applied science, metallurgy, the<br />
engineering and motor trades, woodwork<br />
and plumbing. In Queensland, the proposals<br />
cover the Central Technical College and<br />
technical colleges at Bundaberg, Cairns, the<br />
Coorparoo School of Food, Eagle Farm,<br />
Ithaca, Kangaroo Point, Rockhampton,<br />
Yeronga and the Queensland Agricultural<br />
College. Projects range from chemistry and<br />
electrical engineering to plumbing, sheetmetal<br />
and bricklaying, with animal science<br />
and dairy technology buildings at Gatton.<br />
In South Australia grants already have<br />
been made in 1964-65 for Education Department establishments and at the South<br />
Australian Institute of Technology and<br />
Roseworthy Agricultural College, and the<br />
proposals for the triennium include substantial<br />
expenditure on an automotive trade<br />
school and further expenditure on engineering,<br />
food technology and at Roseworthy. In<br />
Western Australia, building already has<br />
taken place at five schools and the proposals<br />
for the triennium include a substantial<br />
equipment programme and a very large<br />
expenditure for the Fremantle Technical<br />
School. In Tasmania, the whole of the<br />
expenditure in the first two years of the triennium,<br />
amounting to over œ 334,000, will<br />
be spent on the new general block at the<br />
Hobart Technical College.<br />
I commend the Bill, which will have such,<br />
an important effect on the training of skillejl<br />
personnel in our country, to the House. 9<br />
