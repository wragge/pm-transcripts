PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 19 AUGUST 1985<br />
JOINT STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE PREMIER OF NSW,<br />
THE PREMIER OF VICTORIA, AND THE PREMIER OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA<br />
ministers from the Commonwealth, New South Wales, Victoria<br />
and South Australia will meet in Adelaide in November to<br />
consider more effective ways of managing the Murray River<br />
and its Basin.<br />
In announcing the historic meeting today, the Prime<br />
Minister and the Premiers of the three States said there<br />
was serious concern about water and land salinity in the<br />
Murray Basin. Although water and land management is<br />
primarily the responsibility of individual States,<br />
significant advances can be achieved through intergovernmental<br />
collaboration in dealing with the complex<br />
water and land-related management problems in the Basin.<br />
The complex interaction between water and land management<br />
underlines the need for more active involvement of all<br />
government agencies with significant interests in these<br />
matters agriculture, water resources, soil conservation,<br />
environmental protection in any new collaborative intergovernmental<br />
approach to natural resource management in th: 1<br />
Murray Basin.<br />
This is imperative if increased emphasis is to be given to<br />
treating the causes of water and land degradation<br />
originating mainly in past and current management practices<br />
rather than the symptoms of the problem, as has tended to<br />
be the case to date.<br />
To provide a sound basis for consideration by the four<br />
Governments of options for more effective collaboration in<br />
Murray Basin management, it has been agreed that the<br />
meeting will Involve all Ministers of the four Governments<br />
with responsibilities relating to water, agriculture, soil<br />
conservation and environment protection.<br />
The initiative for such a high level meeting, designed to<br />
consider the complex issues involved and develop<br />
recommendations for action by the respective Governments,<br />
came in first instance from the South Australian Premier, </p>
<p>Mr Bannon, and the Victorian Premier, Mr Cain, and was<br />
readily agreed to by the other Governments involved.<br />
The meeting, in which the Commonwealth will play a coordinating<br />
role, will be preceded by preparatory work<br />
undertaken by officials of the four Governments.<br />
Representatives of local and other interest groups will be<br />
invited to attend the meeting as observers.<br />
The Murray Basin contains the nation's most important water<br />
resource, providing assured water supplies to 80% of all<br />
irrigation in Australia. It includes some of our best<br />
cropping and animal production country.<br />
The long-term future of this region is of considerable<br />
national significance, and the outcome of the forthcoming<br />
ministerial meeting will be an important contribution to<br />
whatever further action is considered necessary to achieve<br />
sustainable utilisation of the natural resources of the<br />
region and to secure its economic future. </p>
