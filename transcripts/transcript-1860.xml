VISIT TO THE U. S. 1968<br />
WASHINGTON<br />
ADDRESS TO THE NATIONAL PRESS CL( i i JU] 096B<br />
BY THE PRIME MINISTER, MR. JOHN GORI&amp; 18 R<br />
28 MAO 1968<br />
Mr. President, and Gentlemen:-<br />
I suppose this is the most daunting audience to whom it<br />
would be possible for a politician to speak, because quite clearly, every<br />
word that is said, and particularly if it is said off the cuff--and in any<br />
case it has to be said off the cuffi because I have not got anybody to write<br />
my speeches for me, I haven't got time to do as many as I should--but<br />
every word that is said off the cuff is listened to, and interpreted; I won't<br />
go so far as to say misinterpreted, but at any rate, very, very closely<br />
examined. The other thing about it is that all of you know so much more<br />
about international and economic affairs than any speaker who came to<br />
talk to you could possibly claim to know. So there are considerable<br />
difficulties facing me.<br />
Now, this has brought to my mind a delightful mental<br />
picture, when you talked about the sequoia, and coupled with the words<br />
" duchessing" and " arm-twisting". And I could not help but wonder what<br />
the duchess was having her arm twisted for. But I do not think either of<br />
those things in effect happened. I do not wish to talk to you for a long<br />
time. Initially, when I first came and spoke at the reception I<br />
was given at the White House, I sketched out in short compass the feelings<br />
that we in Australia have about what the United States is doing in various<br />
parts of the world, and, by implication, what we hoped the United States<br />
would continue to do in various parts of the world. But there are one or<br />
two things that I do want to say.<br />
I do want to say that as a representative of a small nationit<br />
is all right-later on I will tell you how big we are going to be in the<br />
future--but just at the moment a comparatively small nation I<br />
wonder if anybody has thought what the situation of comparatively small<br />
nations in the world today would be if there were not in existence a United<br />
States, with a heritage of democracy, and with a willingness to see that<br />
small nations, who otherwise might not be able by themselves, were given<br />
some shield and some guarantee that they would be able to run their own<br />
affairs in their own way. just imagine what the situation in the world would<br />
be if there were not a great and giant country which were prepared to make<br />
those sacrifices for that end. And the end is not negligible.<br />
For a long time, for as long as my study of history extends<br />
into the past, and indeed for as long as my vista of the future extends,<br />
there is likely to be, as there has also been, a deep division of opinion<br />
among mankind as to whether it is better for a country, any country, to<br />
have political freedom, to have Governments which are chosen by<br />
majorities and dismissed by majorities, or whether it is better to have<br />
some Government which is not so subject to dismissal, and which is a<br />
state above the individual. This is the cleavage which for so long has<br />
continued: Is the state designed to serve the individual or is the individual<br />
designed to serve the state? / 2 </p>
<p>Now we have seen in the past this struggle in the Second<br />
World War, when those who believed that the individual was merely<br />
something to serve the state--when those who believed that you could<br />
not have political and economic freedom, but had to submit yourself to<br />
some arbitrary authority in order to gain a loaf of bread, sought, under<br />
black fascism to have it around the world. And that kind of division<br />
of opinion still exists.<br />
If it is true, as I believe that it is true, that in the future<br />
mankind, as a whole, and in all the nations of the world, can only reach<br />
a state of enduring peace and proper progress if it is realized that the<br />
individual must dominate the state and not the other way around, then<br />
what was done in the Second W-orld War was something which serves the<br />
future of humanity. Now, I go further.<br />
As we see it in Australia, this is the basic question in<br />
Vietnam. It is claimed this is a civil war. We do not see it that way.<br />
We see it as your President sees it, and as I believe your President's<br />
predecessors saw it, as another test of whether small nations are to be<br />
subdued by force, as another test of whether the state or the individual<br />
is to be the unit by which humanity progresses. And because we see it<br />
that way, we contribute. We do not contribute a great deal, but we do<br />
have Navy, Air Force, Army there. We do what we can to help, because<br />
we think that what you are doing to help the South Vietnamese is right.<br />
I do not mean that all the people in my country feel this<br />
way, because I do not. But I do mean that the vast majority of them, the<br />
last time they had a chance to express their opinion, felt this way. And<br />
I am confident that the next time they have a chance to express their<br />
opinion, they will feel this way--though in the interregnums I have no<br />
doubt that minorities will protest, will carry banners, will get television<br />
coverage, will get press coverage, but will not represent the feelings of<br />
my own nation. Now, let me tell you a little of my own nation-those of you<br />
who have not been there. I know there were thirty or so who recently came<br />
through--we were delighted to see them. We are a country of some 12<br />
million people. We are a country of immense national resources which<br />
have not yet been properly or fully exploited. We are a country, as I<br />
believe, where frontiers lie for those who are willing to come and live<br />
with us, for those who are willing to provide that capital we need to help<br />
us develop into a significant power--a more significant power. Let me<br />
tell you some of the things that have happened in the last ten years in this<br />
comparatively new country.<br />
In that time, our gross national product has risen from<br />
5003 million to $ 18, 800 million--an eighty per cent increase. Despite<br />
the growth, the average annual increase in our gross national product<br />
has been five and a half per cent. Our fixed capital investment has<br />
doubled, from 500 million a year to 000 million a year. And ninety<br />
per cent of that capital investment comes from our own resources--ten<br />
per cent from abroad. We have invested twenty-six per cent of our gross<br />
national product in this kind of growth. VWe have increased our population<br />
over a period--give or take a year or two--from nine million to twelve<br />
million. Well, Mr. President, I do not think that is too bad a record.<br />
And if I sound as if I am bragging, it is because I am. But it is only the<br />
beginning. </p>
<p>They have already discovered most of the oil, sixty per<br />
cent of the oil that we are going to require for our present needs, and<br />
there will be discovered all that is going to be required for our future<br />
needs. The mineral resources already uncovered are fabulous. And<br />
yet I believe the surface has scarcely been scratched.<br />
I am certain that given ten, twenty years, we will be able<br />
to provide a nation of twenty million--twenty-five million people--and<br />
we will be able to give to each individual in that nation that kind of social<br />
justice which we believe must be a part of any successful country. We<br />
must see that those who are subjected to the " slings and arrows of<br />
outrageous fortune", to illness and old age, ( against which they have been<br />
unable to provide) to invalidism, are properly looked after, and we will<br />
do this. We will play our part, as we grow, along the lines I have<br />
roughly sketched, in the region in which we live, because I think that not<br />
only we, but all the wealthy countries of the world must, if they are in<br />
the future to be understood-must, if they are, in the future, to see the<br />
kind of Governments which will serve their people established in Asia,<br />
be prepared to help contribute and establish those countries in Asia for<br />
the benefit of the people there and for the benefit of ourselves and of our<br />
children and of our grandchildren.<br />
I think that in this task that lies before us, we have been<br />
enormously helped by the United States. I believe the completion of this<br />
task will be brought the more quickly to fruition by the continued help of<br />
the United States in the area--not the United States alone but by the United<br />
States, with us, and such others as will join in that area in the economic<br />
development, the raising of the living standards of the Asian people, the<br />
raising, therefore, of the requirements, the material requirements of<br />
the Asian people, and the protection of what I began to talk about as<br />
political requirements, but will finish talking about as spiritual<br />
requirements. Because in fact, that is what political freedom meansit<br />
means that economic freedom must be provided through political<br />
freedom, but it also means that the innate desire of every individual to<br />
deVelop to the top of his bent, to the best of his capacity, in h ichever<br />
way he wants to go, must be encouraged and permitted, subject only to<br />
his not exploiting those others among whom he lives.<br />
Well, Sir, you have got a lot of questions set down there,<br />
and perhaps I have talked long enough. But I did want to let you know<br />
just the gratitude we feel to the United States, just the certainty of<br />
development in the future we feel for ourselves. And I think there is<br />
almost no Australian and no Australian leader who would not say to you,<br />
even if he is in a different party--and different parties are not much<br />
good--but if he is in a different party, he would at least join with me in<br />
this, to say we are going to grow, we are going to try to provide an<br />
example of a nation along the lines I have indicated to you. We are already<br />
on the way. I do not know where the end of that way will be, but I do know<br />
this--that a nation's reach must exceed its grasp, or what is a future for.<br />
And our reach is pretty great, I think.<br />
I thank you.<br />
President romley: Mr. Frimne Minister, please tell us what you can<br />
about the results of your talks with the President and his advisers. / 4 </p>
<p>Prime Minister: I would be delighted to, Mr. Secretary. We had<br />
some most interesting talks on a whole variety of subjects. But of course<br />
since they were private talks, it is difficult to say any more than that, or<br />
they would cease to be private talks.<br />
Q. It has been reported, Mr. Prime Minister, that you envisage an Israeli<br />
style defence posture for Australia in the future, relying on the ability to<br />
launch punitive forays to discourage aggression. Is this so?<br />
PM. This was never a statement made by me publicly. This was<br />
a statement attributed to me by interpreters of what had been said at a<br />
private meeting. And I cannot discuss or disclose what was said at a<br />
private meeting--that is a Party meeting. But I would be prepared to say<br />
this--that we, in Australia, when I talk of an Israeli-type capacity for<br />
defence, mean a citizen army, properly armed, properly quipped, and<br />
ready to be able to go at a moment's notice into action, just as the Israelis<br />
were able to go at a moment's notice into action. This does not necessarily<br />
mean that such an army is to be used only in Australia, because we have<br />
treaty commitments with the United States, and we regard those as our<br />
greatest shield. But it does mean that I would like to see allied with<br />
mobility of forces, spearheads able to be used immediately, and a build-up<br />
of that kind of citizen military force. which means that for a large part of<br />
the year an individual carries out whatever his occupation may be, but is<br />
available for call-up, is trained for part of the time each year) and is<br />
properly armed and equipped should an emergency ever arise.<br />
Q. Mr. Prime Minister, what will Australia do to bolster Malaysia -Singapore<br />
defence after Britain leaves?<br />
PM. Mr. President, that is a matter which is to be discussed on<br />
June at the Five Power Meeting to be held in Kuala Lumpur, between<br />
Great Britain, Australia, New Zealand, Malaysia and Singapore. Until<br />
that Five Power Meeting has been held, and indeed quite possibly this first<br />
Five Power Meeting may only lead to future discussions amongst the<br />
same powers--but until those matters have been hammered out, a precise<br />
answer to what I take to be a question of defence rather than economic help<br />
and other help just simply could not be given. It is on 10O June that talks<br />
begin to see what all the various countries concerned in the region are<br />
prepared or able or willing to do.<br />
Q. Mr. Prime Minister, you proscribed defence, but indicate<br />
you leave open economic. Would you care to discuss that.<br />
Pm. Well, we already provide considerable economic assistance<br />
to the area, and not only to Malaysia and Singapore, but to the area which<br />
includes Indonesia, our nearest neighbour, and our most populous<br />
neighbour. Through the Colombo Rlan, a considerable amount is provided.<br />
A great deal of technical and scientific training and training in public<br />
administration is given in our own universities. We have in Australia<br />
some 130, 0,00 Asian students at the moment--not all from Colombo Plan.<br />
But we have the equivalent of one complete Australian university devoted<br />
to training Asian administrators, Asian doctors, whatever it might be. We<br />
of course will continue to do that. I think the United Nations or somebody<br />
in the United Nations has suggested that all countries ought to give one per<br />
cent of their gross national product--not all countries--that a number of<br />
countries ought to give one per cent of their gross national product to a lot<br />
of other countries. We do not see any particular point in picking out a<br />
specific figure like that. But we are, per head, I think, from memory,<br />
something like the third ranking country in the world in the provision of<br />
foreign aid of various kinds. </p>
<p>Q. Mr. Prime Minister, with : Emerson, Roche, and Newcombe,<br />
all professionals now, is Australia prepared to surrender the Davis Cup<br />
to the United States?<br />
PM. Well Mr. President, can you tell me when a tennis player<br />
is an amateur and when he is a professional, and when you can, I will<br />
answer that question!<br />
Q. With the United States having second thoughts about the<br />
F-li! aircraft, is Australia considering cancelling its purchase rather<br />
than to be saddled with an inferior machine?<br />
PM. Now, Mr. President, I would hate to get into an intercompany<br />
argument about the capacities of any particular aircraft, Whoever wrote<br />
that question states that this is an inferior machine. On the other hand,<br />
there does seem to be quite a body of opinion that it is an extremely good<br />
machine indeed. I understand that at this stage of development, the F I11<br />
has had rather fewer accidents than the Phantom had at the same stage<br />
of development. This at least is what I am told. And the specific answer<br />
to the first part of your question, Sir, is no--we have contracted to buy<br />
F-111aircraft. We have a team over here now seeing whether there are,<br />
as with most developing aircraft, some bugs that need to be ironed out.<br />
When they are ironed out to the satisfaction of our own team, then we<br />
would propose to continue with the purchases that we have already<br />
undertaken to make.<br />
Q. Mr. Prime Minister, do you think the peace talks in Paris<br />
should include representatives from South Vietnam?<br />
PM. I cannot answer for South Vietnam, and I would not propose<br />
to. But as far as my own country is concerned, at this stage of the peace<br />
talks in P-aris, which I imagine are really talks to see whether there is<br />
a base for any peace tallks--we see at this stage no requirement for<br />
Australian participation. ' We do have there an External Affairs<br />
representative--that is a State Department representative using your<br />
terms--and he is in close consultation with Mr. Harriman and Mr. Vance.<br />
But this does not seem to me to be the sort of exercise where a lot of<br />
people s it around a table-it ha s not reached anywhere nea r that pointto<br />
work out an old-fashioned Versailles Peace Treaty. Rather it is a<br />
circumstance where the United States' representatives, the North<br />
Vietnamese representatives are having discussions. We have the<br />
opportunity to express our views to the United States' representatives<br />
as various aspects of those discussions arise. That is all we wish. And<br />
I cannot speak for South Vietnam.<br />
Q. Mr. Prime Minister, do you endorse Prime Minister Holt's<br />
position of " All the way with LBJ". Are you all the way with LBJ, another<br />
questioner asks?<br />
PM. Two of them. Let me perhaps answer it in this way as in a<br />
sense I answered it when I first came. We think that the United* States has<br />
in its history so far done more than any other country to protect the rights<br />
of small nations and the liberties of the individual. We have treaty<br />
obligations under the ANZUS pact with the United States. We form our<br />
own judgments and make our own policies on aspects of foreign affairs<br />
as they may arise in the future. But I think it likely, on past example,<br />
that the objects of the United States would be likely to be the same objects<br />
as those of the Australian people. And that, I think, is what I will say on<br />
that. </p>
<p>ti er Do you plan to visit Vietnam and other Asian countrieq<br />
PM. Yes, Sir, I will be arriving back in Australia on 1 June,<br />
and leaving--if my memory serves me right--on 5 June for Vietnam,<br />
and from Vietnam to Malaya, Singapore and Indonesia. And I ought to<br />
make it clear that the only reason that the other Asian countries are not<br />
included is because there just are not enough hours in the day or days in<br />
the month to make this possible when there are also local political<br />
requirements. They will come later.<br />
Q. Could Australia's prosperity survive a recession in Japanthat<br />
is, is the Australian economy now too reliant on exports of ore?<br />
PM. I think if there were a serious recession in Japan, that it<br />
would have some effect on the purchases of our iron ore. But the<br />
Australian prosperity I thinkc would still survive. It is now so much more<br />
broadly based than it used to be. Certainly Japan in many ways is one of<br />
our best customers. The United States is our third best customer. Vie<br />
can even survive a recession in the United States. But I think neither<br />
one of those possibilities is likely.<br />
Q. In the interests of promoting tourism to Australia and the<br />
South Pacific, do you contemplate modifying the ban against air charters<br />
to Australia?<br />
PM. Look, this frankly I do not know. I would have to talk to<br />
my Minister for Civil Aviation about that, and get all the pros and cons<br />
of it. I will write you a letter.<br />
Q. How do you feel about reports that New Zealand wants to<br />
become a state of Australia?<br />
PM. Well, I feel they are inaccurate, and grossly exaggerated,<br />
like Mark Twain said about the report of his death. I have just recently<br />
been in New Zealand, and spoken to their Government, and they, I am<br />
quite sure, Sir, do not want to become a state of Australia. I do not<br />
know whether I should go any further and raise any queries as to whether<br />
Australia wants them to be a state anyway, because there are difficulties<br />
about federal governments which plague us as it is. But I do add to that<br />
that what we are arranging with New Zealand, and what New Zealand is<br />
arranging with us is closer and closer economic ties, and a kind of free<br />
market, as it were, where a factory established in New Zealand can have<br />
products in Australia entering either free of duty or with less duty than<br />
many other countries. But they are quite properly a very independent<br />
and proud nation.<br />
Q. Is the American duty on Australian wool hurting that<br />
industry badly, and have you askXed the United States to modify it?<br />
PM. The answer to the first part of that question is, it is hurting<br />
it, and the answer to the second part of that question is yes, frequently.<br />
Q. Mr. Prime Minister, are you in any way disturbed by the<br />
anti-Vietnam, anti-war sentiment being expressed in the United States?<br />
PM. It is difficult for somebody at as great a distance as I<br />
am to assess the real depth of the anti-Vietnam sentiment being expressed<br />
in a country 3, 000 miles away, or however many thousand miles away it is.<br />
/ 7 </p>
<p>7.<br />
But we do have the same kind of expression in our own country, and it is<br />
an expression of a very small minority. My mind, Mr. President, goes<br />
to a quotation from a speech by one of your former great Presidents,<br />
Theodore Roosevelt, who said that the dangers to freedom in the sort of<br />
society that the United States has or would have do not come so much.<br />
from majorities as from organized and fanatical minorities who attempt<br />
to impose their will or their wishes by other than constitutional means<br />
or the ballot box. This I think is the situation in my own country as<br />
regards those who express, violently express, anti-Vietnam sentiment.<br />
What the situation is in the United States, I don't know. There are, of<br />
course, others. I speak of people who make violent protests. There<br />
are of course others who have doubts in my own country, and no doubt<br />
in yours. There are people who see this as a civil war in my own<br />
country, as no doubt in yours. I do not agree with them. And they are<br />
not worrying in Australia because they are not in a majority in my view.<br />
Q. Mr. Prime Minister, we have writers from all segments<br />
of industry here. How is oil prospecting going in Australia? You mentioned<br />
oil in your speech. Would you elaborate?<br />
PM. Yes. Well, the two major finds, or the major find so far<br />
has been under the sea, between the state of Victoria, where a combination<br />
of companies--Esso, one of yours, Broken Hill Pty., one of ours-has<br />
discovered really what looks like being, but not yet fully proved to be,<br />
very, very great oil deposits indeed. It is estimated that they have found<br />
oil on Barrow Island in Western Australia, thousands of miles away, and<br />
some other smaller fields at Moonie. already provide sixty per cent of<br />
our present oil requirements. Oil prospecting is continuing, and I<br />
believe, though there is nothing but faith behind this belief-that more and<br />
more will be found, and that we will be able to be completely independent<br />
in this field.<br />
Q. Mr. Prime Minister, is the fact that you have an American<br />
wife a disadvantage to you in Australian politics?<br />
PM. Mr. President, it would be quite impossible for any man in<br />
this room ever to say that a wife he had of whatever nationality was a<br />
disadvantage. But I can add to that, and say that not only is it not a<br />
disadvantage-it is in my view a great advantage, particularly since we<br />
discovered, much to her and my surprise, a year or so ago, that she is<br />
not only an American citizen, but also an Australian citizen. So we get<br />
the best of both worlds.<br />
Q. Mr. P-rimie Minister, when would you say the next election<br />
will take place in Australia?<br />
PM. The time at which the next election should take place, if<br />
the House of Representatives runs its full term, is towards the end of<br />
1969. That is the time when it would take place, if the House of<br />
Representatives ran its full term.<br />
Q. Someone asks--when will the Sydney Opera House be<br />
finished? Will you have that open house so we can all at least come and<br />
visit?<br />
PM. Well, I would hope that you would all come and visit before<br />
the Sydney Opera House is completed, because the last party we had<br />
through was thoroughly enjoyable from our point of view, and I think from<br />
their point of view, and gave us extremely good publicity coverage. But<br />
/ 8 </p>
<p>8.<br />
there -does seem to be some argument about the precise date at which the<br />
Cpera House to which you refer will be f inished. Indeed, Sir, some of<br />
the more disrespectful citizens of the Commonwealth of Australia are<br />
referring to the F-ill1 as a flying opera hotse. I am not. But I think<br />
within a year or two. It is really taking shape. It will be something when<br />
it is done, and something worth coming to see. But don't wait for it--just<br />
come.<br />
Q. Mr. Prime Minister, before the last question, we want to<br />
extend to you our certificate of appreciation awarded for meritorious<br />
service to correspondents of press, radio and television in the capitol<br />
and our traditional press club official silk necktie.<br />
PM. Thank you very much Sir.<br />
Q. Finally, Mr. Prime Minister--is it true that Matilda has<br />
stopped waltzin-g, too, in Australia, and is now doing the. frug?<br />
PM. No, Sir, that is completely untrue. Mind you--what did<br />
you call that-<br />
Q. It is a dance.<br />
PM. I know it is a dance. I rather think that occasionally some<br />
foreign ministers get photographed doing it. But we are quite versatile,<br />
quite versatile, and the young people and the not-so-young people certainly<br />
do whatever that last dance you mentioned was. But they have not stopped<br />
Waltzing Matilda, because Waltzing Matilda is not our national anthemit<br />
is our national song. There have, I think, been no occasions on which<br />
Australian troops have marched to war except to the strains of Waltzing<br />
Matilda. There have, 1 think, been no occasions when vanguards of<br />
Australian' troops entered cities, such as Bardia, and with a certain<br />
braggadocio, hauled a slouched hat to the top of a flagpole, when they did<br />
not do it to the strains of Waltzing Matilda. There won't be everybody<br />
in Australia who agrees with me on this. But my own mind goes back to a<br />
time in London during the blitz, when a few of us waliked into a nightclubbecause<br />
in those days we were young enough to walk into night-clubsin<br />
Air Force uniform, Australian Air Force un-iform, and as we entered<br />
the band, no doubt because it had run out of other tunes to play, suddenly<br />
struck up Waltzing Matilda, and I think that all Australians, with me, were<br />
stirred, and will continue to be stirred by this song--even though we do<br />
this other dance you mentioned in the intervals. </p>
