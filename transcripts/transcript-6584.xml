JOINT PRESS COt'JFERDNCE -Prime Minister and Kinister for Primary Industry,<br />
Brussels Hilton 4. O0pm, 4 February 1985<br />
E &amp; 0 E Proof only<br />
Well ladies and gentlemen I know that there are some<br />
matters other than the matters that we we've been discussing with<br />
the Commission that you'd probably like to address some questions<br />
to me on, so I may I make the suggestion that we deal with the<br />
events of today at least the events of today in Brussels with<br />
Mr Kerin here and dispose of that mattcr and then Mr Kerin has<br />
to go off and have some other discussions and then I'll be<br />
available for questions on other issues.<br />
If that is accepLable~ to you let me say that Mr Kerin and 1 today<br />
have had lengthy discussions. Firstly, I had half an hour with<br />
Monsieur Delors, the President of the Commission, and then we had<br />
a lengthy session from 11.00 o'clock through till about half past<br />
one in session and then further informal discussions over lunch until<br />
three. I put to the President of the Commnission and then to<br />
all the Commissioners in full session the concerns of Australia<br />
with the impact upon Australia of the operation of the CAP. I<br />
prefaced our exposition to the President and Commission by pointing<br />
out that Australia did not come to the Commission on the.* basis of<br />
asking it to adopt policies and approaches which were inconistent<br />
with the way in which we as a Government were prepared to operate<br />
ourselves. By that I meant that within Australia we had bdrought<br />
the various social partners together on the basis that the<br />
achievement of propar national objectives would best be served<br />
by the trads unions and business seeing that their own enlightened<br />
self interest was much more likely to be served by a perception<br />
of the broader national interest and that we had, certainly by<br />
by internation standards, succeeded admirably by pursuing that<br />
approach. That we had within that framework indicated not merely<br />
a disposition but an intention in practice to go about a review<br />
of our own eeenomic S~ U: ULu. w Lw zunkn It wgire relevant to current<br />
circumstances. I instanced what we had done in the steel and the<br />
automobile industry to make those industries more efficient or<br />
export oriented and ultimately more exposed to international<br />
competition. Not only had we adopted these approaches within<br />
Australia but that we had in our relations with the countries of<br />
of our region in a way in which we were gradually seeking to come<br />
together in that area, had also sought to see the interests of<br />
Australia in the context of that broader international com~ munity<br />
of which we are part. And it was in that sense that I said to the<br />
Commission, therefore, that we came with clean hands as it were<br />
in asking them to adopt the samie approat1a that there was we<br />
believe~ d, whR~ n vipwed in that perpective. a mutuality of interest<br />
between Australia and thc community in that therd was no doubt that<br />
the pursuit of the CAP policies by the Commission through time and<br />
presently was such as not merely to operate against the interests </p>
<p>FROMl 32 2 513012 6 5'. e 234<br />
P. M. cont...: of Australia, but also against the real1 interests<br />
of the community itself here. Because, of course, the pursuit of<br />
these policies which had transformed the Community from one which<br />
was seeking to achieve merely self-sufficiency into a major<br />
world exporter of primary products, had consistently and increasingly been<br />
involved in misallocation of resources within the Community, it had<br />
llleatiL hiyhi~ r fuud prices, it had meant higher wage costs and it<br />
involved a significant increase in rigidities within the Community<br />
and therefore reduced the capacity of the Community to make those<br />
adjustments which were necessary if the European Community was<br />
going to be able properly to achieve the greatest degree of<br />
economic growth in competitive world situations.<br />
Now it was within that conceptual framework, if you like, that we<br />
put our point of view to the Commission about the adverse impact<br />
* upon Australia of the operation of the CAP. We said to them<br />
that we were not here to merely beat drums, make empty threats<br />
and carry on in a confrontationist way but that we did have very<br />
strong concerns generally and in regard to specific commodities.<br />
I addressed those specific commodities and our concerns of the<br />
way in which through the operation of the CAP Australia had not<br />
merely, as it had in the first stage, lost traditional markets<br />
here, but as the Community had become a substantial exporter we<br />
had lost traditional markets. For instance in beef we've lost<br />
markets in the Middle East and North Africa and reduced markats<br />
in Canada. And if I may go there from that point directly to one<br />
area that we pressed strongly with them, that there was very<br />
substantial concern within the Australian rural community that<br />
we faced problems in regard to the Pacific Basin region for our<br />
beef exports in that that region, which markets had been developed<br />
by the industry to compensate for the loss of the previously<br />
traditional markets in U. K. and Europe. And so we pressed with<br />
the Commission that there should be not merely a confirmation but<br />
a strengthening of indications that had previously been given about<br />
a preparedness on their part to address this issue. And in the<br />
result I believe I'm able to say that the Commission in the<br />
detailed discussions now that Mr Kerin will be conducting with<br />
Commissioner Andriessen tomorrow, that I believe that out of those<br />
discussions now will come a firming up of the position by t" he<br />
Commission to the effect that the Commission will be expressing a<br />
position of having no intention presently or in foreseeable<br />
circumstances of applying export funds or introducing beef at<br />
discounted prices in those markets to which I've referred the<br />
Pacific Basin region. Now we believe from the discussions we've<br />
had today that we'll get that sort of indication, but Mr Kerin<br />
will bc taking those discussions now in more detailed form with<br />
the Commissioner tomorrow. But I am confident, therefore, that<br />
as a result of our discussions the apprehension that had been<br />
felt by the rural community and by the National Farmers Federation<br />
in the talks we'd had as recently as yesterday here, that we will<br />
be in a position to achieve some reassurance there. I say no<br />
more about beef other than to express as I say that optimistic<br />
view. 3<br />

P. M. cont...: In regard to dairy products we observed again<br />
the adverse impact that has been felt by our industry as a result<br />
of the massive export surpluses that have been generated as a<br />
result of the CAP. And in particular in regard to cheese I<br />
indicated to the Commission that our import regime for cheese will<br />
have to hp reviewed because of the significant increase in<br />
cheese imports that have occurred particularly since the<br />
understanding was reached with the Community in November of<br />
1983, that even since that time there's been significant increases<br />
in Cheese imports into Australia, I pointed out that our import<br />
regime for cheese will have to be reviewed in these circumstances<br />
pointing out to them that any changes, however, that we'll make<br />
will be fully consistent with our international obligations and<br />
MTN commitments.<br />
In regard to sugar I again pointed out to the Commission the<br />
significantly adverse impact upon of Australia of developments<br />
in the international sugar market. You know that there's been<br />
this dramatic reduction in price from about 40 cents a pound<br />
back in 1980 down to a situation more recently, it's been<br />
down in the order of 5 cents a pound. This has created very<br />
significant problems. And the position following the failure<br />
last year to achieve an international sugar agreement following<br />
the discussions in Geneva at which John was present has meant<br />
for our industry, which is we assert the most efficient in the<br />
world, very substantial problems. You will recall that in the<br />
election campaign I undertook to the representatives of the<br />
canegrowers that I would seek to use my influence to see if<br />
we could get some international meeting to try and get a degree<br />
of co-operation. And I put to the Commission that fo llowing'<br />
discussions that had been taking place amongst representatives<br />
of producers that Australia is considering an initiative whereby<br />
it would convene a meeting of the major producers that's<br />
Australia, Brazil, Cuba and the European Community. And I put<br />
( 9 to the Commission that it would be helpful if they could adopt<br />
the attitude in respect of their own producers as saying that<br />
. they saw such an approach has being a helpful and constructive<br />
measure. And I hope that that will be the case, Let me also<br />
say that I put to the Commission that their sugar regime runs<br />
until 1986 and indicated that our producers would seek to have<br />
the opportunity to present their views to the Commission during<br />
the course of that review and I hope that as a result of the<br />
discussions that we've had that the Australian producers will<br />
take that opportunity.<br />
In regard to cereals we again put the view that again our<br />
industry had been substantially disadvantaged by the fact that<br />
the European Community had become a very substantial exporter<br />
in this area. The quite remarkable position has been achieved<br />
that last year the European Community actually as a result of<br />
its policies had a higher harvest of wheat than the United States.<br />

<p>4.<br />
P. M. cont I particularly also went to the area of barley<br />
and I pointed out to the Commission that EC subsidised barley<br />
exports had reduced the world price for feed barley by 13%<br />
and that if the EC were to continue to export barley subsidised<br />
malt during 1985 into the Pacific region then Australia would<br />
stand to lose 110,000 tons in sales representing some<br />
of its traditional market.<br />
Finally in regard to wine we put the view to the Commission that<br />
there was a lack of reciprocity in the trading relationship<br />
in wine between Australia and the Community in that we in<br />
Australia accepted the. Cormmunity standards in regard to wine<br />
and didn't seek to impose the artificial barriers in that<br />
respect, but there was not reciprocity in that area as far<br />
as Europe was concerned. And we put to them strongly that they<br />
should be prepared to accept our standards and that again<br />
will be a matter that John Kerin will be discussing with them.<br />
So ladies and gentlemen I apologise that it's taken some time<br />
but I hope I've now covered the areas that we discussed both<br />
in general conceptual terms and in regard to specific commodities<br />
with the Community. And I believe that as a result of the<br />
discussions certainly the relationship between Australia and<br />
the community is now on a basis where rational discussion can<br />
be held. We're not in the business of confrontational rhetoric<br />
but we are in the business of putting forcefully to the<br />
Community the legitimate concerns of our rural community and,<br />
as I say, I believe that-in the discussions which have now<br />
been set up following our meeting today that we can hope for<br />
-some fleshing out of those areas of assistance to which<br />
I have referred.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime M~ inister given the background of the new<br />
members of the Commission that there was some hope on the<br />
Australian side that there would be a degree of what Hr Kerin<br />
characterised yesterday as ' economic sanity' do you think<br />
that's what they've got<br />
Well let me say that I think that the composition of<br />
the new Commission is such as that the new Commissioners do<br />
bring to their very substantial and difficult task a degree<br />
of expertise which is welcome and it was certainly the case<br />
that we were able today to have the discussion which was<br />
an intelligent and rational discussion. I think they certainly<br />
understand the dimensions of the problems confronting Australian<br />
rural producers and they accepted, I believe, the rationality<br />
of the case that we put. I mean having said that one is forced<br />
to say that they in turn are faced with a situation which is<br />
not one to which economic rationality is the only consideration<br />
which we've brought to bear. They have their own very substantial<br />
rural conatituencies. But in that respect may I say that I<br />
pointed out to them we understand the nature of the political<br />
pressures that can be brought to bear by rural interests and<br />
the legitimate concerns of producers that they are not going<br />
to be disadvantaged. But what we pointed out was the economic<br />
fact that the way in which the CAP was operating was not<br />
efficient in terms of meeting those needs of farmers. Because<br />
the facts are that 8% of the benefit of the CAP progam goes.<br />
to about 20% of their producers their most efficient producers.<br />
FROM 32 2 5130126' a5.02.04 23144 </p>
<p>P. M. cont...: So if you like as a social instrument it is<br />
inefficient and so you're not only getting inefficiencies in<br />
terms of equity but, as I said at the opening Of my statement,<br />
you're also getting very substantial economic efficiences and<br />
rigidities within the. European Economic Community which mean<br />
that their capacity to have an economic structure which will<br />
make them most efficient in competition in other areas is to<br />
that extent reduced. Now those arguments, I think, are well<br />
understood. Now the extent to which they can move to give<br />
effect to the arguments is a matter of time. But I believe<br />
there is a commitment and an intention on the part of this<br />
new Commission to address those issues with a degree of<br />
realism. JOURNALIST: On sugar did the EC actually respond that they<br />
would attend the proposed meeting in Australi1a.<br />
Well this is not a meeting of Governments or Government<br />
institutions. It's proposed as a meeting or producers and<br />
representatives of producers. And really what I put to the<br />
Commission was that they should allow their producers to<br />
see from the Commission's point of view thM-. they would regard<br />
that as an initiative which could be useful.<br />
JOURNALIST: On the beef, did they actually promise they would<br />
not trade unfairly in Asia, or did they promise to talk about it.<br />
What we have reached is a posiLJlOA wheru X believe I'm<br />
-able to say what I did about the sort of thing they'll bay.<br />
The actual specifics of the formulation are to be finalised<br />
by Mr iKerin tomorrow. But I feel able on the basis of today's<br />
discussions to express confidence that there will be a view<br />
emerging following today and the detailed discussions tomorrow<br />
that there will be a position emerging in which they will be<br />
saying that they have no current intention or in the foreseeable<br />
. future of operating to our disadvantage in that region by<br />
the use of subsidised exports.<br />
JOURNALISTt What was it they said today that leads you to<br />
expect that and who was it who said it to you.<br />
P. M. t Well I had first of all discussions with the President<br />
and then these points were put to the Commission in full today.<br />
And concurrently there have been discussions at the official<br />
level. And it's out of all of those discussions that have been<br />
going on that I believe tomorrow should see that sort of position<br />
emerging. JOURNALIST: Are you looking at a watertight guarantee that the<br />
Europeans are not going to dump their beef in the Pacific Basin.<br />
FROM 32 2 5130126' 85.82.04 23: 45 </p>
<p>6.<br />
P. M. t Yes, that they; will be giving us an undertaking that they<br />
will not be dumping and t-hat they will give us that undertaking<br />
now and into the foreseeable future. And I would hope that we<br />
may also be able to achieve a posit-ion that in addition to that<br />
sort of undertaking for the present and foreseeable future that they<br />
may be prepared to go to the point of saying that should there be<br />
beyond that foreseeable future any contemplation of change that<br />
no such change would take place other than at the Commission level.<br />
In other words it's not something that could be affected<br />
subsequently by bureaucratic decisions.<br />
JOURNALISTt So you think you're leaving Brussels with a-good result<br />
in other words. Is that the way you would look at it.<br />
Well I want to be careful about not raising undue<br />
expectations. I hope, I think I've put it fairly, I believe that<br />
as a result of the work we've done which is to be finalised by<br />
John tomorrow, I think that sort of undertaking that I've indicated<br />
should be forthcoming. If iit i6 Lhat certainly meets the hopes<br />
that were expressed to us by the representatives of the rural<br />
community.<br />
JOURNALIST: So if you get those guarantees what do they -want in<br />
return. Well that's matter that will be part of the discussions<br />
tomorrow. if we can get satisfaction in that respect then I<br />
believe it would be possible for John to diocuee with them whether<br />
there would be a pursuing of the Article 23 matters under GATT.<br />
JOURN~ ALIST: Did you get any undertakings on the barley and malt?<br />
All that was done there mike was to put the details to<br />
them of what's happened adversely in the reduction as I said of<br />
the 13% in price and to indicate the apprehension~ that we've got..<br />
I received at that stage no undertakings from them but merely there<br />
was an acceptance by them that they took aboard what we said and it<br />
would be a matter pursued in discussion tomorrow by Mr Kerin.<br />
JOURNALIST+ Did that also apply to eugar. Was that the situation<br />
Wall I t%-hink with sugar what wn've achieved is this and<br />
again I don't want to overstate the position but I believe<br />
that we have reached a position with the Cornmunity that I think<br />
they would mnake it clear to the ' European producers that they<br />
ooulId see some merit in the meeting of the sort that I have<br />
indicated. And if we can do that, well then we will have Itaken<br />
that part of fulfilling the undertaking which I gave to producers.<br />
Because there is absolutely no doubt that the present position is<br />
intolerable where the Australian industry, as I say we believe<br />
we're the most efficient sugar producer in ie world, is because<br />
of the absence of an international sugar agreement emerging from<br />
last year's discussion, are operating in this position where they<br />
are getting suc~ h a pitiful return below cost of production returnfor<br />
their product. And all we can say, and I don't want to overstate<br />
it, but what the Australian producers have said is well, let's at<br />
least try and get a meeting of the major producers to see whether<br />
there is a possibility of doing something about getting a more<br />
rational international marketing position. And I think as a result<br />
of the discussions today Australia will be in a position where o7<br />
FROM 32 2 5130126185.02.04 23: 47 </p>
<p>P. M. cont it will be able to convene that meeting and it<br />
will] be able to be convened in the circumstance where at least<br />
the European Commission would not be indicating to the European<br />
producers that they were averse to that meeting taking place.<br />
JOLJRNALISTt Did you seek an assurance that they wouldn't be<br />
dumping any more butter below GATT prices.<br />
we. Li wnaL wu yuL Lu LUzisu w. yandral eoLir of tho<br />
problems that have been created for the dairy indujtry generally<br />
as a result of their actions. The officials, of course, have<br />
made clear the adverse impact that we saw that resulted from the<br />
decisions they had made-in--regard to sales to the Soviet Union<br />
in defiance of the international dairying arrangement. But the<br />
specific aspect of the dairy industry that we put to them which<br />
represented our own conviction and certainly followed the<br />
discussions that we'd had with the representatives of the<br />
National Farmers Federation we put to them quite clearly that<br />
we could not and would not tolerate a position where subsidised<br />
dairy products were being brought into Australia, taking up a<br />
very significant share of th~ e Australian market and m~ ade it<br />
quite clear that in those circumstances we would be reviewing our<br />
import regime to try and meet that situation.<br />
JOURNALISTt Mr Kerin given that the EEC broke the international<br />
dairy agreement and given that they welched on agreements with<br />
Australia over cheese imports, why would you have any confidence<br />
whatsoever that they would abide by any undertaking given to<br />
Australia over beef.<br />
KERIN: I'd just like to make the point that there is a new<br />
Commission. We've been the first country to come here with the<br />
new Commission. It's a chance to restate again how we expect<br />
the FC to behave in the international commodity arena and I don't<br />
think there was any, well they certainly didn't equivocate today<br />
from that point of view. And although they didn't say we're sorry<br />
chaps, or anything, we're dealing with a whole new Commission.<br />
The Prime Minister made the case in the'strongest possible terms.<br />
H~ e mapped out the high ground on the specific commodity matters<br />
that VIl be talking about tomorrow with Mr Andriessen.<br />
JOURNALISTt What did they reply on the cheese matter.<br />
Well they took note of what I said and I indicated t hat<br />
Mr Kerin would be spelling that out and the clear implications<br />
of it tomorrow. And there was no equivocation about our position<br />
on that.<br />
JOURNALIST: I get the impression, Prime Minister, that you've<br />
been pleasantly surprised with the attitude of the Europeans.<br />
P. M: Let's be clear about this. I don't want to leave the<br />
impression that we've just come here and put what I believe has,<br />
of course, been a totally rational, legitimate and well-founded case.<br />

cont...: That we've dne. I beliE-ve ielve done it<br />
effectively. But I hope that the answers I gave before did not<br />
overstate the way our expectations can be. I believe that we've<br />
got legitimate expectations of a satisfactory response in the<br />
area of beef in the Pacific market. I think that is a legitimate<br />
expectation of our talks. In the area of sugar I've set out<br />
what I believe we've achieved there and I don't want to overstate<br />
that that is that we ought to be able now to have this<br />
international producers meeting that we'd seek to convene without<br />
opposition from the Comm~ ission and that there will be an<br />
opportunity for our producers to have an input if they wish to<br />
consideration by the Commission of the sugar regime which expires<br />
4 in 1986. Those are specifics. I hope also that in regard<br />
to wine that they will see, I think, the unarguable case that<br />
we've put there. I mean we accept their standards, they should<br />
accept ours. And I am hopeful that in the discussions something<br />
will come of that. So if you add those things together you can<br />
point to achievements and pluses. But having said that you are<br />
still faced with a total regime which creates very significant<br />
problems because we have the basic and unarguable fact that you<br />
have this very substantial Community with fertile soil and<br />
political imperatives which has pursued policies leading to<br />
Significant oversupplies in all our major rural areas of<br />
production other than wool. Now that's not something that I<br />
want to leave the impression that we'vye solved our basic problem.<br />
I think the fair statement is that in realistically achievable<br />
areas we have got some runs on the board which will be of benefit<br />
to sections of our industry.<br />
JOUIRNALIST: In terms of getting th'qm to accept your economically<br />
rational arguments is the reaction better than you expected or<br />
as you expected or not<br />
Oh, I think yes they understood the arguments that we<br />
were putting as indeed as intelligent men they had to. Arnd the<br />
Al arguments and the case, the exposition, in incontravertible. I<br />
. think I indicated in answer to a previous qruestion that<br />
unfortunately what we're faced with is a consideration not only<br />
of the application of economic rationality, but of certain internal<br />
political imperatives which are not easily overcome.<br />
' IJOLJP1ZhLST: 14elU. how long would Australia suf fer such a drain on the<br />
balance of payments before the Government responded with some<br />
sort of overt retaliation.<br />
Well one has to be realistic in this question of retaliation.<br />
I think there is nothing more tutilt:, di' d r seek of couroo<br />
to speak for the National Farmers Federation. They have their<br />
very articulate and able spokesman available to speak to you but<br />
I don'I t believe. that they would take the view that anything is achieved by<br />
eq: ty gestures and threats of retaliation. We have to accept the fact that<br />
And within that framrework, therefore, threats can be somewhat<br />
empty. What we have attempted to do is to put to the community<br />
the views of our Government and the views of the Australian<br />
industry. And may I say, I notice the representatives of the<br />
National Farmers Federp&amp;'% ion are present here,. that we have been<br />
assisted by the way in which both in Australia and here as<br />
recently as yesterday, the representatives of the rural<br />
community put their case to us. And we weren't faced with a / 9 </p>
<p>FROM 2 51Z0112E. 8.2e 3~<br />
' f/ F~ 9.<br />
P. M. cont situation of being asked to make empty threats<br />
because where can you get in doing that. But we believe that<br />
we are able to say to this Community which is conceptually founded<br />
upon the proposition of principles of liberal free trade that<br />
they should understand not only in our interests, but in their<br />
own, that ultimately our mutual interests are only best served<br />
by the application of the principles that we are putting. And<br />
we believe that we've got to continue to put that argument..<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr H~ awke if you don't get the assurances that you<br />
want and you don't take out trade retaliation, will you come back<br />
and make the same arguments again.<br />
Well let me pick up that point in this direct and relevant<br />
way in the latter part of the discussions the President,<br />
Monsieur Delors, indicated to me that they had appreciated the<br />
breadth and detail of the exposition that I put. And they expressed<br />
the view that they would want to see continuing discussions between<br />
us. And so I think we have established a framework now quite<br />
clearly where we will be able to continue discussions in the way<br />
that we put them. 1 don't expect, and I don't imagine, that<br />
Australian rural interests believe that you're going to resolve<br />
these problems in one day or two days. We have got certain<br />
advances I believe. I've outlined them, I don't want to go<br />
into those again. But in addition to getting those advances which<br />
I hope will be of some comfort to our rural industry and to<br />
Australia as a whole, inL addition to that I repeat, I believe<br />
we have established a framework wherein we'll be able to continue<br />
to-press our point of view.<br />
JOURNALIST: Was the ban on uranium exports to France raised<br />
Yes, it was raised. We didn't only deal with agricultural<br />
matters, but with a whole range of bilateral relations. That<br />
was raised. I made it clear to the Commurnity that that decis ion<br />
had been made firmly by the Australian Government for good<br />
internal reasons. That it applied to F~ rance and I made it clear<br />
that it would be quite improper for the commission to try and<br />
create, to erect an implication, of Australia as an unreliable<br />
supplier on the basis of that decision. we're specific for<br />
specific reasons applying to one country, and one country only<br />
as a community.<br />
JOURNALIST: Did they ask you to lift the ban.<br />
No, they weren't gauche enough to do that or even droit enough.<br />
JOURNALIST: the ban as being for good political domestic<br />
reasons. Did you explain it was also for international political<br />
reasons. Well we made the decision as a Government because of<br />
our perception as a Government that that was the appropriate<br />
course of action. It is a course of action which I believe would<br />
receive the support of othier countries in our region. But we<br />
made that decision autonomously and made it in the context of<br />
our broader approach on these matters.<br />

<p>A<br />
JOURNALISTt In what cc., ntext did they raise the uranium<br />
Simply because we were, as I say, in addition to talving<br />
about agricultural matters, we also talked about the whole<br />
range of bilateral trading. Now in that the question of energy<br />
resources came up. You will appreciate that the Australian coal<br />
ñ ndustry has made substantial advances recently. And during<br />
1984 in sales to Europe and so the whole question of both<br />
Australia as a supplier of energy resources and also of investment<br />
by the Community in Australia was a matter of discussion. So<br />
let me make it quite clear that the overwhelming proportion of<br />
our discussion was in the area of agricultural products. But<br />
we had an obligation to address these other issues.<br />
JOURNALIST: Did they say they raised it because France wanted<br />
them to. They didn't say they raised it because France wanted<br />
them to. But in the course of their exposition on this subject<br />
they did make the point that what happened to one member of the<br />
Community was regarded as significant for other members of the<br />
Community. And it was in that context that I made the point<br />
that I've made to you that it would be totally improper for the<br />
Commission to erect upon the basis of that decision some<br />
proposition about Australia being an unreliable supplier in the<br />
general sense.<br />
JOURNALIST: They accepted your explanation.<br />
I believe they did.<br />
