PRESS CONFERENCE GIVEN BY THlE PRIME MINISTER,<br />
MR WILLIAM McMAIION, AT PARLIAMENT HJOUSE,<br />
CANBERRA, ACT. 21 OCTOBER 1971<br />
Q. Have you seen anyone down here today from the<br />
Treasury, Prime Minister?<br />
PM: Yes.<br />
Q. What line of discussions have you had, may I ask?<br />
PM4: I wanted to find out what their version of the consumer<br />
index was.<br />
Q. What is it?<br />
PM: They explained tL-he figures Lo me, particular the sharp<br />
increase that occurred in New South Wales as the result of<br />
the increase in fares and the increases that had occurred<br />
over the whole of Australia because of the impact of<br />
increases in health charges. The greater part of these<br />
were due to wage increases. They also went through the<br />
various other elements of the September Index ith me.<br />
But I.. have.. given you my impression of what their thinking was.<br />
It then became clear that if you had removed the special<br />
influence of New South Wales special influences relating<br />
to New South Wales that the rate of increase would not<br />
appear to be anywhere near as sharp -or as sharp if you<br />
could put it a little more accurate -as the raw figures<br />
-would indicate.<br />
Q. Did they make any predictions about what the December<br />
quarter would bring in view of increases in State Bu&amp; c ets<br />
Pm: I raise. this question myself and I obtained verification<br />
of my own views that the December quarter while being<br />
speculative at this moment could at least be expected to be<br />
quite substantial because of the impact of the Commonwealth<br />
Budget figures were not felt in the September quarter, as the </p>
<p>collection of the data occurred in the middle of August and<br />
the Budget didn't come down until a little later, and that<br />
the effc-ct of Budget changes in the Victorian Budget would<br />
not be written in until the December index figures became<br />
available.<br />
Q. Does this mean that a substantial increase in the<br />
December quarter won't prompt the Government to tak,-e any<br />
action on the economy?<br />
PM: I will not make any statement there, but again it<br />
must be obvious that in the December quarter, most of the<br />
impact also will be substantially due, or as put last night,<br />
directly or indirectly due to the impact of wage increases,<br />
and not as the result of an increase in demand. Nowi what would<br />
happen then in the March quatter March and June quarterswill<br />
largely depend on the National Wage Case, if the decision<br />
is out by that time. vOUia re<br />
Q. Sir, Mr Lynch has made it clear Nk%, xis/ oing to do<br />
something about the Arbitration Act tightening it up.<br />
Do you think what you do there will have an effect on<br />
the cost of living? Will you be able to pull it into line<br />
through action on wages?<br />
. P. M: You are taking it over a very broad cnnvas.<br />
As yet, we haven't made our decision, so the question is<br />
hypothetical, and one to which you couldn't give an answer<br />
that is sufficiently exact. But it is as I said, in my<br />
view and in the view of the officials and those participated<br />
in the drafting of the Budget, the forecasts that we made then<br />
are turning out to be correct with this one exception that<br />
demand is not quite as strong as w~ e would like it to be.<br />
B ut the economy is a healthy one, our overceas balances are<br />
strong, our overseas trade is going along~ well, and personal<br />
savings are particularly high. What is-needed is a little<br />
more confidence. If this confidence was there, then I am<br />
sure the economy could be brought quid-y to a pretty healthy<br />
state. </p>
<p>Q. Any idea how you are going to instil that confidence,<br />
Prime Minister?<br />
PM: Talkabout it. There is a wonder: ful phrase that was<br />
once used by Roosevelt: " The only thing we have to fear is<br />
fear itself". And I think that applies pretty well to<br />
Australia's position today.<br />
Q. You are not planning any other definite measures to<br />
increase consumer spending, for example?<br />
PM: Naturally, and I have said this before, we are<br />
watching the economy vary carefully. We have plenty of scope<br />
for revision and we could act quickly should we feel the time<br />
was right to do so. I can give this assurance that I, in<br />
particular, the Treasury officials and the Reserve Bank are<br />
watching the figures very closely, and I have had at least<br />
two very thoroughgoing discussions with them during the course<br />
of the last four weeks.<br />
Q. Do the present employment figures, in the light of this<br />
Index rise, present you with any trouble, or do you pL-opose<br />
to take any amelioratory steps at this stage?<br />
PM: Not immediately. But I have said to you that I have<br />
had thoroughgoing discussi ons with all the officials recently<br />
and in particular, we will have a national income and<br />
expenditure forecast presented to the Government quite soon.<br />
Those are the figures that will be important to us in consideringj<br />
what we should do.<br />
Q. You have asked for this specifically, Prime Minister,<br />
have you?<br />
PM: I did some weeks ago.<br />
Q. How far ahead does this project? Is it a projection<br />
on the rest of the financial year? I-</p>
<p>PM I don't know how long a projection it will be, but it<br />
is a projection.<br />
Q. When do you think you % vill get it? After this trip or<br />
before?<br />
PM: Q. PM: Q. PM: Not before, no, I don't think so. I think I would be<br />
extremely lucky, although I have been asking them to hurry up<br />
with it. But these have got to be done with a great deal of<br />
thoroughness and care, and I think you might get a surprise<br />
a pleasant surprise when we see the next employment figures.<br />
Have they indicated to you that there are already<br />
indications that things might not be following the same pattern<br />
we saw in September?<br />
Don't let me get too speculative, but I do my homework.<br />
an I know all the people in the employment offices, and I<br />
never hesitate to contact them personally.<br />
' What would give you a pleasant surprise a small drop<br />
or a small rise, or what?<br />
The figures that I would be looking at would be see to<br />
whether the October figures accorded with the pattern of the<br />
October figures for previous years..<br />
The pattern being an improvement in tlesituation in<br />
October usually? It is usually avery small increase in registrants<br />
look I couldn't explain them accurately to you because I haven't<br />
got them in front of me, but they are usually somewhat neutral<br />
figures. And I will be interested to see what does happen.<br />
We won't have the figures after all until the second wveek in<br />
November.<br />
Q. PM: </p>
<p>Q. Is that time, therefore the second week in Novemberwhen<br />
you have to sit down and decide whether the Go-rnment<br />
PM:<br />
Q. That will be an important week for us, yes.<br />
Does that mean the Government will get the income and<br />
expenditure That I couldn't tell you. As I have said,<br />
extremely difficult analysis to make, and one that<br />
done with a great degree of thoroughness and care.<br />
been asking them to hurry up with the analysis for<br />
prepared to. make them ( 3to too rushed a job. I want<br />
analysis I can get. it is an<br />
has to be<br />
W hilst I have<br />
me, I am not<br />
the best<br />
Q. You will still be away then, won't you?<br />
PM: Look I have said to you.. no, that isn't correct.<br />
Let me correct you, because I said I didn't know when it was<br />
coming forward.<br />
Q. No, I just meant that second week<br />
Interjection : The employment figures will be out in that second week.<br />
PM: Oh, the employment figures. Yes, they would come out<br />
in the second week. It would only be within a day or two of<br />
my cominq back.<br />
Q. PM:<br />
Q. PM: Prime Minister, just what degree of concern do you<br />
feel about the state of the economy?<br />
I have said to you already that the economy is in a<br />
healthy state.<br />
You are not concerned?<br />
Of course I am concerned. Any politician whoever loses<br />
a capacity toib concerned would be a strange one. Of course<br />
PM: </p>
<p>I look at the figures with care but I know that the greatest<br />
problem of all that we have to solve is of inflation.<br />
And we are doing the best we can to.-try and solve. Many<br />
people are now conccding for the first time that what we<br />
have said is correct. For example, if you look at today's<br />
papers, there is a-very good... . and if you would like to<br />
look, for example, at an article by Professor K. J. Hancock<br />
in the " Financial Review" of 19 October, he says in this<br />
context: " Given that the Government takes the view that<br />
some deflationary counter to inflation is desirable<br />
it is hard to see the logic of those who assert tha-' the<br />
Government's Budgetary policy is misconceived."<br />
I think you ought all know these. And the statement of the<br />
National Bank today believes that " the economic slow-down<br />
of the past year has been caused by the conservatism of<br />
individuals in the personal sector as a whole." These<br />
are very important statements because now it is becoming<br />
understood by so many. The cause is there. The cause<br />
is a very real one and we have tried to the best of our<br />
ability to ensure that we bring inflation, particularly<br />
wage inflation, under control under relative controland<br />
I believe we are on the way to succeeding.<br />
Q. You said one of the things you are going to do about<br />
the economy is to talk. Have you considered going on<br />
national television or radio and trying to undo the message<br />
that was given to people in January and February?<br />
PM: No, I don't think I have. But I don't want to push<br />
this too far. I have I suggested to the ABC<br />
I might go on, but they had a programme filled up and then<br />
I was going away. I couldn't finalise the arrangements<br />
with them. But I have made arrangements... I1 thought I<br />
would be having a press conference on Wednesday before I<br />
went, and I would do exactly the same then as I am doing<br />
now, saying a little more confidence is what we need to<br />
get demand back because the potential for demand is<br />
pretty high and personal savings and disposable income<br />
will permit some increase in demand. But again, if you </p>
<p>start to look at the figure. Look at Waltons' figures<br />
today for retail sales. They were surprisingly high. So<br />
production figures are pretty good. You know, the figures<br />
are not As clear-cut yet, for anyone to be able Ito be precise,<br />
I don't care who hie is.<br />
Q. Prime Minister, you mentioned Professor Hancock's speech<br />
the other night to the Economics Society. Although it is<br />
quite correct what you did quote, the main burden of hispaper<br />
was there was a strong chance the Arbitration Commission would<br />
no longer have the small degree of control it at present has<br />
over the wages policy, because the MTIA would perhaps go outside<br />
the Arbitration system. Are you concerned with this possibility<br />
which seiems to flow from the decision in the Carpenters' case,<br />
that we may have the MTIA having sweetheart agreements outside<br />
the Arbitration Commission in addition to the National Wage<br />
Case and setting a case in which the Government cannot even<br />
make representations as it can do now with the Arbitration<br />
Commission.<br />
PM: Yes I am disturbed by it and I will be seeing Mr Cilarkson<br />
tomorrow. He hasn't indicated to me he wants to see me about it<br />
but I presume it would be in connection with the Nati-nal<br />
Employers policy decisions as to what they intended to do<br />
with Arbitraition. I think i't would be a retrograde step if<br />
they were to have negotiations with the Metal Trades Industries<br />
outside the Commission and later on went to the Commission<br />
itself and tried to get a national wage increase. It could<br />
be extremely dangerous and would introduce a policy that<br />
wouldn't be in the best interests of this country and certainly<br />
wouldn't be in the best interests of the working man.<br />
Q. * Have you considered the idea of using corporation powers<br />
to enlarge the powers of the Arbitration Commission in your<br />
Hkkadxiniiwx present review of the Arbitration Commission?<br />
PM: I don't think you can. In fact the Arbitration power<br />
is a separate placitum of the Constitution, and gives the<br />
power to legislate for the peace, order and good gover.:-Aent<br />
of the country, and we can only legislate with regard to<br />
Arbitration. We cannot affect the Arbitration decision 1~' </p>
<p>itself. We must leave them free to make up their minds what<br />
they think is right.<br />
Q. i thought the corpofation power, and of course it is<br />
the subject of wide discussion outside the corporation<br />
power might give the Government greater control over an<br />
institution such as the Arbitration Commission operating<br />
as an incomes board, being able to set maximum rates as well<br />
as minimum.<br />
PM: I don't think so. It has never been suggested to me<br />
and on the plain meaning of the words, I doubt whether that<br />
interpretation is.-right. 4" U g~<br />
good<br />
Q. To change the subject You have had a/ view of the<br />
fasters. What do you think of Paul Ponoermo's actions-.<br />
he was taken to hospital today?<br />
PM: I have been very worried about him-i. Very worried.<br />
I did, as I mentioned in the House, ask the Speaker if<br />
he would make arrangements to ensure that whatever facilities<br />
were available to them were made available, partic. ilarly if<br />
they wanted to have a wash, if they wanted somewhere they<br />
could change, that they would be able to do so. I also made<br />
enquiries yesterday to see that he was watched carefully<br />
to ensure that he didn't come to any harm. And I checked<br />
again this morning to ensure that lie was watched. I was<br />
later on informed that some of ) Js friends had arranged for<br />
the ambulance to take him to hospital. But I have been<br />
worried about him, very worried.<br />
Q. You had him watched in the medical sense?<br />
PM: In the medical sense, yes. I thought if~ he we're not<br />
eating that he could damage to himself, and I didn't want that<br />
to happen. </p>
<p>Q. What about this question of increasing aid to<br />
million, have you thoughtc-out that?<br />
PM: Yes, it is only recently that we made the decision<br />
about the increase of $ 11 million, and both the Minister for<br />
Foreign Affairs and I have answered questions about it in<br />
the House. I have also discussed it again with Mr Bowen<br />
this morning.<br />
Q. Can we expect further announcements?<br />
PM: I can't make any other statement about it.<br />
Q. Did you discuss the possibility of increase?<br />
PM: I won't go any further.<br />
Q. Was this in the light of the increase in the British...<br />
PM: No, it was in the light of the United Nations'<br />
initiative<br />
Q. The Brits say they acted because the United Nations<br />
asked them for more money. Have we had a specific request<br />
from the United Nations?<br />
PM: I don't know because I wanted to talk to Mr Bowen<br />
about it today. He is ill in bed and I was not able to find<br />
out what the exact position was.<br />
Q. Sir, will you be talkingzbout the refugees on this<br />
trip? Is it one of the things....,<br />
PM. No. V<br />
Q. Can you tell us, generally, the reasons for the<br />
trip?<br />
PM: PTMh: e reasons were, I thought, made pretty plain in </p>
<p>PM: Sir? So far I intend to visit only the United States and<br />
Britain. I mnust... I1 think then I will come straight 1 iome.<br />
That will get me home then on the Wednesday before the House<br />
meets, and I think that is about as late a s I want to return<br />
to Australia. What date is that?<br />
Somewhere about the 16th or 17th. I could look it<br />
up for you, but I think you can get it just as easily as I can.<br />
Prime Minister, did you get any indication when<br />
you received an invitation from President Nixon that this<br />
was in response to your letter to him which you mentioned in<br />
the House. You agreed in the House that you had writLen to<br />
the President following....<br />
No, I didn't. I didn't get any impression that it<br />
was as a result of that. I did not. I got an impression<br />
the statemcnt that I issued. I received a personal invitatioi<br />
from President Nixon to come to Washington on 2 November.<br />
Sometime before, I had received an invitation from Mr Heath,<br />
and I informed him that OThen a suitable opportunity arose<br />
I would come. As I was going to Washington I immediately<br />
informed him, and he asked me if I would come to London<br />
and we have arranged meetings there.<br />
Is the suggestion well founded that President Nixon<br />
has some announcements to make that will affect us and wants<br />
to tell you about them? Have you got any reason to believe<br />
that that is so?<br />
I think it would be imprudent for me to be making<br />
any kind of a statement that could create false impressions<br />
and I have no intention of doing so. But there has been<br />
a speculation on a wide range of subjects and I am sure most<br />
of them will be covered in the discus~ ios.<br />
Can you say what other countries you will be visiting<br />
PM: PM:<br />
Q. PM: </p>
<p>that this was a very suitable time for me to come because.<br />
it would be immediately before the decision-making processes<br />
on a wide range of matters would be initiated, and that it<br />
was a very favourable timc to be there. I would have liked<br />
to have gone a little later, particularly during one of the<br />
weeks that the House was up but it was felt on analysing the<br />
information we had that the 2nd was the best date I could be<br />
there.<br />
Q. Sir, can you tell us when in fact pu got the<br />
invitation?<br />
PM: Last Thursday.<br />
Q. You. really didn't waste any time accepting it.<br />
PM: No. Well I gave you the explanation a few seconds<br />
ago that I would have liked to have gone a little later and<br />
I pointed this out, but it was also pointed out to me that<br />
in our interests, our Austral. ian interests, it would be wise<br />
to be there at the earliest possible date.<br />
Q. Can you indicate some of these wide range ot matters<br />
PM: No, I don't want-to. But the Press speculated, and<br />
frankly, the Press speculation on this occasion has been<br />
wide ranging and has touched most subjects that I think are<br />
of importance.<br />
Q. Sir, will you have any point of view to put to<br />
the President on China which seems to be the big issue&gt;<br />
I think your visit will be before he goes to Cihina.<br />
PM: Yes, but I am not going to be now forecasti, g<br />
or stating explicitly what I will be saying. The details<br />
of what I intend to say is something that has qot to be<br />
reserved for discussion with him, and then subsequently<br />
T am pretty certain a joint press statement will be made.<br />
* The Press that come, I can assure you, will be kept well<br />
informed. </p>
<p>12.<br />
Q. I assume before you leave Australia will make<br />
a decision regarding its currency level?<br />
PM: No<br />
Q. I assume you will be discussing it in those talks<br />
both in Washington and London.<br />
PM: The answer to your first question is: I don't<br />
think we will be making a decision as to the long-term<br />
parity of the Australian currency with other currencies.<br />
The second one, of course, I will be discussing both the<br />
import surcharge of the United States and the question of<br />
currency realignments together with the other problems<br />
associated with it such as greater freedom of trade<br />
multilateral trade and I take it that, incidentally, although<br />
it won't affect us, thexpxkñ uiaxx will be the question ofa'<br />
greater sharing of the defence burden.<br />
Q. Have you spoken to the President on so-called<br />
" hot line"? Have you spoken to him personally yet about the<br />
trip or is it a written arrangement?<br />
PM" Well, he wrote to me personally. Then there were<br />
discussions on at leatt two occasions bxnt eHe Australian<br />
Ambassador to Washington and the White House staff.<br />
Q. If you are going to get back mid= November and<br />
Cbbinet will be considering changes to the Arbitration<br />
I presume.<br />
Act, presumably, which Mr Lynch is/ go ng o present to<br />
Cabinet, you are going to be rather pressed to get this<br />
into Parliament before the House rises for Christmas.<br />
PM: Yes, but we has not been, as it were, waiting for<br />
all the papers to be pre-sented one Cabinet meeting.<br />
We have had several Cabinet meetings about the Arbitration<br />
system, and I think most of us are in a position, whrre if<br />
we have to make decisions on a single paper we will be able to<br />
do it fairly quickly. </p>
<p>13.<br />
Q. The intention is to have a policy statement mor'e<br />
or less first, rather than detdUled legislation before<br />
the HoUse rose?<br />
PM: I doubt whether we could have detailed legislation.<br />
It would be a policy, statement.<br />
Q. Sir, have you got any comment on the Fr Anthony's<br />
suggestion there could be a Federal election early next<br />
year?<br />
* PM: No.<br />
Q. It-is not true or you have no comment?<br />
SPM: I have no comment.<br />
Q. I think you said early this year there would be<br />
no more legislation introduced into the House three weeks<br />
before the house rises on December 10. Will that in fact<br />
occur?<br />
PM: Yes that decision will stand with these exceptions.<br />
That in the case of tariff reports and in the case of<br />
essential Treasury Bills, they would be introduced. But these<br />
are usually passed without very much discussion. They are<br />
bills of a formal kind that can't be avoided.<br />
Q. If I could ask one more question. You told<br />
Parliament the other day you would look at the figures<br />
presented by Mr Howson on the Television and Film School.<br />
Have you done so yet?<br />
PM: Yes. I have had a thorough look at them<br />
Q. Can you tell us the result of it? / 14 -M a </p>
<p>14.<br />
PM: No, I can't. I think it would my response if I<br />
said anything to say it in the House.<br />
Q. You said you saw a Treasury official today. Can<br />
you tell us who you saw? Did you see Sir Richard?<br />
PM: I saw Mr Garrett, first of allpwho, as you know,,<br />
is an old friend of mine, and we started to discuss the<br />
C index figures. He thought it was better if I saw Mr<br />
Rye, and I t'Aen had a talk to him. He is one of the whiz kids.<br />
Q. Prime Minister, thank you very much. We hope we<br />
will be able to see you again soon. F-</p>
