PRIME MINISTER~<br />
FOR MEDIA SATURDAY, APRIL 17 1982<br />
CUSTOMS PROCEDURES<br />
The statement issued by the Minister for Business and Consumer<br />
Affairs, Mr M. oore, has been drawn to my attention. I have,<br />
of course, told him and the Minister for Health, Mr MacKellar,<br />
that there must be a full disclosure of all the relevant facts.<br />
I shall be taking the opportunity of speaking to the two<br />
Ministers in Canberra on Monday, when Ministers assemble<br />
for the Cabinet meeting.<br />
The general position on customs procedures as far as Ministers<br />
and Members of Parliament are concerned is quite clear.<br />
Instructions were issued at my request in 1976 to ensure<br />
that Ministers and Parliamentarians returning from overseas<br />
undergo the same customs and quarantine formalities as other<br />
Australian citizens returning home.<br />
I shall be asking the Minister for Business and Consumer<br />
Affairs to bring under notice again and reinforce the instructions<br />
that were issued in 1976. -oOo---</p>
