    <content><![CDATA[<p>I am pleased to announce Commonwealth funding of $3 million for</p>
<p> the Integrated Cancer Programme to support cancer research and bolster</p>
<p> the fight against this devastating disease.</p>
<p>Cancer touches the lives of every Australian family. By the age of</p>
<p> 75 years, one in three men and one in four women will be diagnosed</p>
<p> with cancer. Research is the key to cutting back its reach and impact.</p>
<p>The Integrated Cancer Programme is a joint initiative between the</p>
<p> Sydney Cancer Centre and the Centenary Institute. This Commonwealth</p>
<p> funding will allow the Programme to expand its research and ensure</p>
<p> that the new cancer research discoveries are applied directly to the</p>
<p> clinical care of patients fighting the disease.</p>
<p>Cancer is one of the six National Health Priority Areas. The Commonwealth</p>
<p> provides extensive support for cancer control. For example, it gives</p>
<p> state and territory governments more than $55 million to conduct</p>
<p> breast and cervical cancer screening programmes. It also provides</p>
<p> $0.8 million and $2 million per annum respectively for the</p>
<p> National Cancer Control Initiative and the National Breast Cancer</p>
<p> Centre. These centres are funded to enhance Australia's efforts</p>
<p> in cancer control. The National Health and Medical Research Council</p>
<p> is also providing $23 million in 1999 for health and medical</p>
<p> research relating to cancer.</p>
<p>The Integrated Cancer Programe brings together an exciting mix of</p>
<p> basic cancer research, applied laboratory research and clinical research,</p>
<p> the results of which will be applied through multi-disciplinary cancer</p>
<p> treatment and education. This work, assisted by Commonwealth funding,</p>
<p> will be of immense benefit to sufferers and will help to maintain</p>
<p> Australia's position at the forefront of medical research and</p>
<p> treatment of cancer.</p>
<p> The health of all Australians is extremely important to the</p>
<p> Commonwealth Government and, for this reason, I am keen to lend support</p>
<p> to worthwhile endeavours like this. I also expect that the NSW Government</p>
<p> will match our commitment by providing a further $3 million to</p>
<p> the Programme.</p>
<p>My Government will continue its focus on health issues that potentially</p>
<p> affect everyone, paying particular attention to diseases like cancer</p>
<p> that have such a major impact on sufferers and their families.</p>
