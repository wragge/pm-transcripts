    <content><![CDATA[<p>This week marks the centenary of the Australian landing at Anzac Cove.</p>
<p>On that day, some 750 were killed.</p>
<p>Nearly 9,000 would lose their lives at Gallipoli before the evacuation eight months later.  Over 61,000 would lose their lives during the Great War.</p>
<p>Our forebears faced terrible trials, but the worst of times brought out the very best in them.</p>
<p>Their perseverance, selflessness, courage and compassion came to define us as a nation.</p>
<p>So this week, around Australia and overseas, we will commemorate this anniversary.</p>
<p>Tomorrow, I will be in New Zealand for the dedication of the Australian National Memorial in Wellington. </p>
<p>This Memorial is a reminder of the deep ties between our two nations.</p>
<p>We are more than friends, we are family.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, I will travel to Turkey to join our Anzac Day commemorations at Gallipoli.</p>
<p>This Anzac Day, I hope all Australians will participate in the dawn services, marches and commemorations which will occur.</p>
<p>On Anzac Day, we remember all who served our country – in all conflicts and in all peace keeping operations.</p>
<p>In a century of service, we have lost 102,000 of our nation’s finest.</p>
<p>This week, I hope all Australians – young and old – in every town and suburb – will honour them and remember them.</p>
<p>Lest we forget.</p>
