    <content><![CDATA[<p>Today I am pleased to announce more than $32 million worth of grants for the first round of the Australian Government's Personal Helpers and Mentors Program.  </p>
<p>The grants are for service providers in 28 demonstration sites selected for their experience in mental health service delivery and connections with local clinical health and community-based organisations. It is expected that 140 personal helpers and mentors will commence work at these demonstration sites by the end of May 2007.</p>
<p>This first round of funding forms part of the Government's $285 million commitment for this program, which I announced in April 2006 as part of the government's contribution to the Council of Australian Governments' National Action Plan on Mental Health.  </p>
<p>The Australian Government is strongly committed to improving the lives of Australians with a mental illness.  When I announced the Commonwealth's major new investment of $1.9 billion towards mental health reform last year, I expressed concern about the number of people with a mental illness in Australia who don't have anyone to help them get the assistance and services they need.  People who are living with a mental illness often need help to find accommodation, organise payments, attend appointments and receive their entitlements under government programs.   </p>
<p>The Government is funding around 900 new personal helpers and mentors over five years to assist those severely affected by a mental illness to manage their daily activities.  Across Australia, personal helpers and mentors will help people reconnect to the wider community, and will support their recovery.  </p>
<p>Importantly, the organisations selected to deliver this program have experience in working with people with a mental illness in a community setting.  The funding grants announced today will allow these organisations to recruit personal helpers and mentors with a range of backgrounds, qualifications, skills and knowledge to ensure flexible care and support for those in most need.</p>
<p>As part of the Australian Government's commitment to mental health, we are investing in a range of programs to provide better access to primary health care, increase the mental health workforce, and provide more respite places and treatment.  </p>
<p>I congratulate the organisations chosen to deliver this first phase of the Personal Helpers and Mentors Program, which will provide real benefits for people with a mental illness, their families and carers.  A full list of the providers in the first 28 demonstration sites is set out in Attachment A.</p>
