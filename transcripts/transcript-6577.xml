FOR MEDIA 28 January 1984<br />
Many-submissions have already been received in response to<br />
the Government's invitation for the community to help shape<br />
a national campaign against drug abuse.<br />
Most submissions so far have been letters from individuals<br />
with suggestions on how particular drug problems could be<br />
solved.<br />
I **, The Government will continue to encourage submissions from<br />
community groups and individuals until February 16 so that<br />
the comprehensive national c-ampaign will reflect community<br />
ideas and concerns.<br />
Submissions should be directed to Dr Neal BlewettL-, Minister for<br />
Health, Parliament House, Canberra, 2600, and the envelope<br />
marked ' National Campaign Against Drug Abuse'.<br />
* The success of the national campaign will largely depend on<br />
the ideas and proposals being brought forward to Governments,<br />
particularly by community groups and those with special<br />
knowledge and experience.<br />
Individuals and voluntary organisations, through submissions<br />
and participation in workshops such as that being held by the<br />
Alcohol and Drug Foundation of Australia, will play an<br />
important role in shaping the campaign.<br />
Ideas received from the community will be shared with all<br />
Governments and be available to the Ministerial Committee on<br />
Drug Strategy which will meet in March to form recommendations<br />
for the forthcoming meeting with State Premiers.<br />
The date of the meeting of Government'leaders will be announced<br />
as socn as it has been settled with Premiers and the Chief<br />
Minister of the Northern Territory. </p>
