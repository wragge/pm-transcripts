TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER THE HON P J KEATING, MP<br />
AND SA PREMIER JOHN BANNON,<br />
DOORSTOP, JANUARY 30 1992<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF ONLY<br />
PM: Well the Premier and I have had a meeting this<br />
morning about the forthcoming economic<br />
statement of the Federal Government. We have<br />
also had a chance to speak to the business<br />
community and one of the Social Security<br />
organisations in SA we'd like to do things<br />
which would encourage a faster recovery in<br />
Australia, but at the same time are good for<br />
the structure of the place. W listen to views<br />
put to us by the business community about a<br />
range of things, about how they see the<br />
economy, about what things the Government might<br />
do and also we discussed some of the<br />
infrastructure questions. And we've decided to<br />
come and just look at the interface between<br />
water, road and rail which exists here and<br />
that's the main point of the visit.<br />
J: What do you think of Mr Bannon's shopping list<br />
Mr Keating?<br />
PM: Well it's extensive, I would think ill of him<br />
if it wasn't, but I think we will have to sift<br />
our way through those things. But the common<br />
theme, I think, the Premier and I are on common<br />
theme about strengthening the infrastructure of<br />
Australia. We do have real problems now in<br />
the micro-economy that is. There is a hint to<br />
how much Budgetary and monetary policy can<br />
change Australia. If there are physical<br />
problems they have to be overcome, and that's<br />
why we are considering some of these subjects.<br />
J: Mr Keating, a lot of the Premier's suggestions<br />
are those things based on micro-economic </p>
<p>2<br />
reform, things like the transport how well<br />
do you receive them?<br />
PM: Well I think in this sense that this is the<br />
period when we need the states concentrating on<br />
the things which they do mostly and that is<br />
transport and a lot of the infrastructure<br />
questions which are not directly Commonwealth<br />
issues but because of the national economy and<br />
because of our financial arrangements with the<br />
States they've become a matter of co-operative<br />
issues between us. So I welcome the fact that<br />
the Premier is focussing on these problems.<br />
J: So a good chance of some money coming that way?<br />
PM: Well, we like to treat all of the States fairly<br />
and equitably and do things which have a theme<br />
to them, which improve the productive focus of<br />
the country and therefore, obviously, some of<br />
these things will fit into that picture.<br />
J: Dr Hewson says a real increase in wages will<br />
cost more jobs.<br />
PM: Well I thought that was a very shabby comment<br />
from Dr Hewson. He has oppossed every wage<br />
increase in the last ten years and when this<br />
Government has got inflation down to our<br />
lowest level in a quarter of a century, and he<br />
is walking around with a consumption tax which<br />
is going to add 15% to prices, you've got to<br />
have a lot of front and a lot of hide to be<br />
talking about inflation when you are walking<br />
around with the inflation detonator in your<br />
hands. A consumption tax, and if Dr Hewson's<br />
consumption tax were to go into place<br />
Australia's inflation would go back to double<br />
digits and we would be back where we started<br />
twenty years ago and not where we are now. Yet<br />
he has got the hide to address the Government<br />
about low inflation and, worse than that, the<br />
hide to say to Australians who actually made<br />
the sacrifice and now, because inflation is<br />
low, have higher real wages, to say that he<br />
should take it off them.<br />
J: He also says that an increase in real wages<br />
means an increase in unemployment and<br />
you're buying votes<br />
PM: Yes, I mean that is the sort of inane comment<br />
he makes that a real wage increase which comes<br />
by way of the fact that the underlying level of<br />
inflation is low, therefore making any nominal<br />
wage increase of more real value, of greater<br />
real value, that that success is described by<br />
him as the Government buying votes or creating </p>
<p>-3<br />
unemployment when he is walking around with<br />
something which is going to add f ive or six<br />
percentage points to the price system from a<br />
per cent tax on all goods and services. I mean.<br />
it is an amazinag comment from somebody who<br />
must have a hide as thick as an elephant.<br />
J: Isn,' t George Campbell right from the ACTU and<br />
the metal workers saying the jobs are the<br />
priority, you really ought'nt to be offering a<br />
real wage rise in the current circumstances<br />
should you?<br />
PM: You have got to understand some technical<br />
competence in this debate is required, even by<br />
the ABC. We are not offering a real wage rise.<br />
But: if wages come out this year at where<br />
the Government expected earlier inflation to be<br />
but: inflations coming out at obviously<br />
there is a real wage increase in there. So<br />
what do we say to people, well you've made the<br />
sacrifice, we're wearing the recession, we're<br />
wearing unemployment but the good side for you,<br />
the up side, Dr Hewson wants to take it away.<br />
Its like the comment he made about business,<br />
the Premier and I have been keen to meet the<br />
business community to speak to them and to pick<br />
up their views. Not all our views, of course,<br />
are views which we accept or that we can<br />
contemplate, but some are he said we shouldn't<br />
be meeting them. He said that's business<br />
looking for a handout, that I shouldn't be down<br />
here talking to them, that's his view. I mean<br />
its this sort of strident view that the only<br />
thiLng that you do is inflict people with some<br />
pain, stick a new tax on them, don't meet with<br />
them or talk to them, oppose any increase for<br />
workers while at the same time saying that<br />
their bread, their milk, their clothing, their<br />
housing, their dry cleaning, their taxi fares<br />
all carry a 15% tax.<br />
J: Has Bob Hawke told you that he will be leaving<br />
Parliament sooner rather than later, not going<br />
to the end of the term?<br />
PM: No he hasn't but we're not here for<br />
J: Mr Bannon, now you keep this<br />
infrastructure project for almost a year now,<br />
have you finally got through to Mr Keating?<br />
Bannon: I t~ hink that there is a general acceptance that<br />
providing projects deliver long-term value to<br />
our economy, now is a good time to look<br />
seriously at doing them. I guess anyone can<br />
say well perhaps we could have started earlier<br />
or the conditions might have beepi better a </p>
<p>-4<br />
while back I really don't think that is the<br />
point. The point is that there are projects<br />
which have been identified, they have been<br />
refined, they are ready to go and providing<br />
they can deliver that long-term value, and they<br />
are not just making work, they have got a f air<br />
chance of acceptance I think.<br />
J: Mr Keating, what has happened to make you<br />
change you mind on these infrastructure<br />
projects, they didn't get a very warm reception<br />
when they were officially floated?<br />
PM: In the 1980s we were cutting Government<br />
spending because we had a hugh current account<br />
problem and one of the things which suffered<br />
was public investment, but if private<br />
investment is down in a recession it does<br />
fol~ low that this is the appropriate time to<br />
lif* t public investment somewhat. So, you know,<br />
it's not a matter of any religious conversion<br />
on my part, its simply a matter of being, you<br />
know, wise to the current circumstances but it<br />
is, I repeat, the point is it was true that<br />
when we needed to lift public savings and cut<br />
the size of the public sector a lot of<br />
Government capital work suffered.<br />
J: Mr Bannon have you won any commitments from the<br />
Federal Government today?<br />
BANNON: Wel~ l only in so far as I think we have had a<br />
very good hearing following our submission and<br />
the! bu ' siness people and others who have been<br />
abl~ e to speak to the Prime minister, I think,<br />
have had in turn a very good reception. The<br />
fact that the Prime Minister is personally<br />
inspecting some of the areas where we propose<br />
things to happen is also very positive but I<br />
wouldn't expect him to be announcing here and<br />
now that, yes, he agrees. So obviously he's<br />
got: to then consider it in the national context<br />
and as part of the statement. But this is as<br />
much as I think would be reasonable f or any of<br />
us to ask at this stage of consideration.<br />
J: Mr Bannon you say that South Australia is a<br />
special case, how has the Prime Minister<br />
responded to some of the special considerations<br />
that you have outlined?<br />
BANNON: Wel. l you can ask him. But the f act that we<br />
have been able to put before him, the<br />
su bmissions are there in detail, they obviously<br />
don't get considered in a day. They need to be<br />
tak en back, assessed. He may have further<br />
quiestions or qudries. We'll respond to -those<br />
in the course of the preparation of the </p>
<p>statement.<br />
J: long term commitment from the Federal<br />
Government?<br />
PM: Well it's one of the issues the Premier<br />
addressed us on. I think it has had the<br />
character of a national project to this time<br />
and I think it will keep that character.<br />
Arrangements between us, as the Premier said<br />
eloquently a moment ago, has got to be<br />
considered in the context of the statement in<br />
our financial capacity and across the States.<br />
J: Do you think SA is a special case?<br />
PM: We SA has got some unique difficulties that the<br />
more populist States don't have. I've always<br />
recognised that and as we drove over here we<br />
came past the submarine project which the<br />
Premier pointed out some pertinent features<br />
about. That is here by virtue of the fact that<br />
this Labor Government in Canberra recognises<br />
the fact that SA does have particular<br />
circumstances and difficulties which in part<br />
the submarine project itself, in its time, was<br />
designed to address. Now of course<br />
difficulties remain and that's why we are now<br />
examining other things.<br />
J: What sort of long-term inflation rate is the<br />
Government looking for?<br />
PM: Well we're not here to give you long-term<br />
inflation rates<br />
ends </p>
