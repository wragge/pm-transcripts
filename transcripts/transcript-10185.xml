2 December 1996 TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
THE HON JOHN HOWARD MP<br />
ADDRESS AT 1996 NATIONAL AWARDS FOR RETAIL EXCELLENCE<br />
THE REGENT HOTEL, SYDNEY<br />
E&amp; OE<br />
Thank you very much Frank Lowy and to your wife Shirley, and to everyone else.<br />
Janette and I are really delighted to be here tonight.<br />
I feel very privileged to share a platform with Kieren Perkins. I guess along with<br />
millions of other Australians, I held my breath that Saturday morning in July. And his<br />
magnificent win that morning, along with Susie O'Neill, seemed to turn the whole<br />
thing around. And it was a magnificent demonstration of the thing that makes all of us<br />
the proudest people imaginable and that is Australian determination and Australian<br />
success and Australian quality and Australian excellence. That's what tonight is all<br />
about. It is about honouring the excellence and the achievements of men and women<br />
in the retail industry.<br />
Can I say at the beginning of my remarks to you Frank Lowy; you are a great<br />
Australian. You're a person who has demonstrated an extraordinary flair and capacity<br />
in business; you're philanthropic; you're a person who gives a lot back to the<br />
community and you are, in many respects, the personification of the story of post<br />
world war to Australia, a nation that receives millions of people from around the<br />
world. Yourself comning originally from Europe, from very sad and unhappy<br />
circumstances, building a new life in this country, pouring so much into it and<br />
becoming so much a part of Sydney and so much a part of Australia. And I'd like to<br />
say what a pleasure it is for Janette and I to be your guests and Shirley's guests here<br />
tonight. Tonight is about remarking on and honouring excellence and achievement. And it is<br />
appropriate that one of the greatest sportsman Australia has produced should be the<br />
first speaker tonight. And excellence is something that ought to run firmly through all<br />
aspects of Australian life. Achievement on the sporting field or in the swimming pool<br />
is something that Australians have always honoured with enormous enthusiasm, they </p>
<p>always will and so they should. But excellence in the school room, excellence at<br />
university, excellence in a profession, excellence in business, excellence on the<br />
shopfloor, excellence at the retail level, is also something that we should unhesitatingly<br />
honour. And particularly those people who commit themselves in the small and<br />
medium size business sector.<br />
Many of you know I do have something of a passion for small business. One of the<br />
reasons, I guess, is that I grew up in a small business environment. My father had a<br />
small garage they used to call them, or service station at Dulwich Hill, an inner<br />
suburb of Sydney. And I was taught as a young bloke that the most important thing<br />
you could do in life was to start with nothing and work your heart out and hopefully<br />
pass on a bit more to your children than you yourself have. It was a pretty good ideal<br />
and it's a very important ideal for Australia in the 1990s.<br />
I know that retailing is about the most competitive thing anybody can be in at the<br />
present time. I know it's tough. I know there's a lot of cut-throat competition. It's<br />
always been an unprotected industry. You've never had any government handouts.<br />
You've never had any protection. You've always been on your own and without much<br />
sympathy if you fell over.<br />
And I know that retailing patterns and consumer habits have changed. I often say to<br />
people that the last recession in Australia left Australia's consumers permanently<br />
hardened in favour of driving tough bargains. And I think we as a community changed<br />
a lot in that last recession. But we've always had amongst our national characteristic a<br />
tremendous capacity to innovate and to change and to adapt to new circumstances.<br />
One of the stunning things about Australians is their willingness to embrace new ideas<br />
and new technology. We are, as many of the people in one section of retailing,. will tell<br />
you, as a society we probably veraciously devour new technology, new gadgets and so<br />
forth, more rapidly than any other country in the world. The way in which Australians<br />
have taken the mobile telephone to their heart, or should I say to their ears, so<br />
enthusiastically is a very good demonstration of that.<br />
And I want to say to all of the retailers of Australia, and particularly those of you who<br />
operate on a small scale, I want to say that my Government will do everything it can to<br />
create good circumstances to make retailing strong and prosperous. We want to have<br />
and preserve the low inflation that we have at the present time. A high dollar is a pain<br />
in the neck for some people, but for other people it's a good thing. Now, we don't<br />
control the dollar, the world market forces control. And I want to say to you that the<br />
days of thinking that any government could control the exchange rate, those days are<br />
gone forever. But a high dollar can bring benefits in lower inflation. It can help,<br />
therefore, to feed into lower interest rates and therefore provide a very, very sound<br />
business base.<br />
And we've acted very quickly to bring in many of the reforms we promised to help<br />
small business. From the I1st of January the ridiculous unfair dismissal law that we<br />
now have will be swept away and replaced by a far more intelligent one.<br />
Our other industrial relations reforms, which have now all gone through Parliament,<br />
will come, most of them, into operation on the 1 st of January and they will make direct </p>
<p>bargaining a lot easier. We've implemented our commitments in relation to the<br />
provisional tax uplift factor and we've legislated to introduce our capital gains tax<br />
rollover relief And I notice that Charlie Bell, the Managing Director of McDonalds, is<br />
here tonight. Charlie has chaired a committee which has given a whole raft of<br />
recommendations to me about how we can reduce the paperwork burden on small<br />
business by 50 per cent in our first three years in Government. And I promise Charlie<br />
and I repeat the promise tonight in front of everybody so you can all hold me to it<br />
that we'll give him a comprehensive and, I think, very positive response to those<br />
recommendations by the middle of February in 1997.<br />
Now we are very, very keen indeed to make conditions as good as we possibly can for<br />
small business in Australia. But, there is of course, so much a government can do.<br />
The rest is up, of course, to the entrepreneurial spirit and the flair and the innovation<br />
and the hard work of men and women in business all around Australia.<br />
I always get a tremendous personal delight out of being at an evening like this because<br />
it's one of those occasions where you can really feel tremendously proud to be Prime<br />
Minister of a country that has produced so many people who've tried and so many<br />
who've succeeded. So many people who've started with nothing, have come to<br />
Australia with nothing and have built great and successful enterprises. They've<br />
employed people, they've generated wealth, they've made a lot of people happy and<br />
they've made a contribution to this society. And business is not, in the eyes of many of<br />
its critics, just a question of a hard edged approach to making profit, it's also about<br />
building a happy and united community. And the shopping centres that Frank Lowy's<br />
Westfield Corporation have produced are now part of the community life in this<br />
country. They've helped change for the better the way in which people shop, our<br />
shopping habits and our whole attitude to shopping and retailing has been transformed<br />
over the last 10 or 20 years. And the Westfield Company and many other people here<br />
tonight have made a massive contribution to that.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much for having me as your guest. I want to<br />
congratulate in advance all of those who will receive award tonight. I want to thank<br />
Frank Lowy and his great company for the massive contribution that it has made to<br />
Australia. And I want to thank all of you for the investment that you are making in the<br />
future of our country, the risks that you are taking not only for yourselves, but the risk<br />
that you are taking to build a better, more prosperous and more contented Australian<br />
community. Thank you. </p>
