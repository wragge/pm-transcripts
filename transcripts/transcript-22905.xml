<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, can we ask you about the sad passing of Charlie Perkins today? Do you have a comment on that?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes I do. Charlie was a tireless fighter for the cause of his people. He put his views forthrightly. He put it without fear or qualification. I extend my sympathy to his family. He was much liked and admired, and inspired great affection within the indigenous community of Australia and his death does take a very significant figure. Really a person who left an enormous impression on the indigenous community and fought very hard, particularly in the early years when things were changing and there was a lot more resistance to change. And itâs in that context that I think his lasting significance will be seen.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
