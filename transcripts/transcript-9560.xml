STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
US PEACE PRIZE AWARDED TO SENATOR EVANS<br />
I am delighted to offer my congratulations to Senator Gareth Evans who has<br />
today been awarded a prestigious US peace prize.<br />
The 1995 Grawemeyer Prize in Improving World Order, awarded by the<br />
University of Louisville in Kentucky, is awarded annually for significant<br />
contributions to international affairs by individuals or groups.<br />
It has been awarded to Senator Evans for his writings on the subject of UN<br />
peace-keeping including an article he contributed last year to the US journal<br />
" Foreign Policy" and his 1993 book " Cooperating for Peace".<br />
This prize, of US$ 150,000, gives due recognition to the outstanding foreign<br />
policy leadership of Gareth Evans over more than seven years.<br />
The prize is also a tribute to modern Australian diplomacy which has<br />
established a new tradition of working creatively, sensitively and<br />
comprehensively for the national interest.<br />
Senator Evans will be proposing to the Government how the prize money can<br />
be best used to help promote Australia's foreign policy interests.<br />
