    <content><![CDATA[<p>E&amp;OE...............................................</p>
<p>Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen. I'd like to start by saying</p>
<p> one or two things about the decision of the House of Representatives</p>
<p> to reject the Native Title Amendment Bill as amended by the Senate.</p>
<p> The amendments made by the Senate were completely unacceptable to</p>
<p> the Government. In the end, the Senate did not compromise one iota</p>
<p> on the position it had taken in December of last year. It insisted</p>
<p> on the inclusion of the unacceptable right to negotiate on the unworkable,</p>
<p> even in the eyes of the former Labor Government, and of Father Frank</p>
<p> Brennan, a clause dealing with racial discrimination. It also insisted</p>
<p> on the inclusion of a clause relating to, or rather the exclusion</p>
<p> of a clause, relating to sunset and, of course, it also insisted upon</p>
<p> a registration test that was quite unacceptable to my Government.</p>
<p>The Bill we presented to the Australian community was a fair Bill.</p>
<p> It was a compromise on the legitimate expectations of many people</p>
<p> in the Australian community based on the promises made, and the statements</p>
<p> made by Mr Keating in 1993, that the grant of a valid pastoral lease</p>
<p> extinguished native title. And in those circumstances, the Government</p>
<p> did not believe that it would be fair on those sections of the Australian</p>
<p> community if it were to compromise further. The Government's</p>
<p> fundamental objection to the position taken by the Senate, is that</p>
<p> that position would give to one section of the Australian community</p>
<p> an advantage that is not enjoyed by other sections of the Australian</p>
<p> community. We want to treat all Australians equally. We do not believe</p>
<p> that one group of Australians should have privileges under the law</p>
<p> denied to other sections of the Australian community.</p>
<p>Can I say in relation to the often repeated claim that if the rejection</p>
<p> by the Senate of the Native Title Amendment Bill were to be one of</p>
<p> the pieces of legislation on which I might obtain a double-dissolution</p>
<p> in the future, that that would be a race election. I deny that, and</p>
<p> so far as my own party is concerned, it will not be a race election.</p>
<p> I will not seek to exploit issues of race. I will not seek to use</p>
<p> racist language. I will not seek to drag issues based on race into</p>
<p> an election campaign. It is the proper function of a democracy in</p>
<p> Australia that if the two houses of Parliament cannot agree then it</p>
<p> is open to the Government of the day to resolve that deadlock by first</p>
<p> having a double-dissolution and then presenting the legislation which</p>
<p> was the subject of the disagreement to a joint sitting of the Parliament</p>
<p> after that election. It was put there specifically to allow the people</p>
<p> of Australia to decide in the event that those provisions were invoked</p>
<p> if the two houses were in conflict. And I've always found it</p>
<p> quite extraordinary that in some way the Australian people cannot</p>
<p> be trusted to make a rational decision. It strikes me as a piece of</p>
<p> elite arrogance for people to say that the Australian people cannot</p>
<p> be trusted to make a calm, non-racial judgement on a difficult issue.</p>
<p> I believe that our Bill is fair. I believe it embodies the compromise</p>
<p> that Australian people regard is fair, that is our belief. It is not</p>
<p> based on race. It is based on a bona fide belief in fairness and treating</p>
<p> all Australians equally. And I do reject as elite arrogance, the view</p>
<p> that in some way the Australian people can't be trusted to make</p>
<p> a calm, rational, dispassionate judgement. I believe they can because</p>
<p> I believe the Australian people are overwhelmingly decent, they are</p>
<p> overwhelmingly non-racist and they have overwhelming goodwill to the</p>
<p> indigenous people of Australia. I want to make it very clear that</p>
<p> whatever may be the circumstances of the next election, issues of</p>
<p> race from the Liberal Party will not be allowed to intrude.</p>
<p>May I say just one or two things before I take your questions on the</p>
<p> very important issue of waterfront reform. Reform of the waterfront</p>
<p> is vital for jobs. It is vital for investment. It is vital for the</p>
<p> export industries of Australia. The purpose of waterfront reform is</p>
<p> not some kind of ideological anti-union push, vendetta or crusade.</p>
<p> It has never been the objective of my Government to destroy a particular</p>
<p> union or to destroy unions in general. Unions are a legitimate part</p>
<p> of the fabric of the Australian community but it has always been the</p>
<p> objective of my Government to have a more efficient and a more competitive</p>
<p> waterfront. It has always been our belief that if we could have a</p>
<p> more competitive and a more efficient waterfront, we would create</p>
<p> more jobs, we would boost our exports and we would encourage further</p>
<p> investment. And we believe that the practices of the MUA, year in</p>
<p> and year out over a very long period of time, have hindered that goal</p>
<p> and prevented the obtaining of a more efficient and a more productive</p>
<p> Australian waterfront.</p>
<p>We have always said that we would reform industrial relations generally</p>
<p> and that specifically, we would endeavour to change the law to allow</p>
<p> reforms to be obtained on the Australian waterfront. And I want the</p>
<p> events of the past few days to be seen against the background of that</p>
<p> long commitment. It is not some kind of latter day knee jerk reaction</p>
<p> to a particular set of circumstances. It represents an element of</p>
<p> our longstanding commitment to a more efficient waterfront because</p>
<p> we believe Australia will benefit, and the national economic interest</p>
<p> of Australia via more jobs, more exports and more investment will</p>
<p> benefit from the more efficient waterfront.</p>
<p>It must be remembered that the Maritime Union of Australia set out</p>
<p> to destroy Patricks. The Maritime Union of Australia behaved in an</p>
<p> irresponsible, uncooperative, belligerent way to Patricks, and indeed,</p>
<p> over the years that has been a fair description of its behaviour.</p>
<p> The leadership of the Maritime Union of Australia has been out of</p>
<p> step with the interests of the members of that union. The unionists</p>
<p> have not been well served by the behaviour of their leaders.</p>
<p>I believe that the national economic interest of this country requires</p>
<p> a more productive waterfront. It requires the sort of reforms that</p>
<p> have been achieved in other countries, and I say to the rank and file</p>
<p> of the trade union movement throughout Australia, our quarrel is not</p>
<p> with you, our quarrel is not with unionisms, our quarrel is not with</p>
<p> unionists, our quarrel is with unproductive, anti-competitive work</p>
<p> practices which have hindered the creation of jobs in Australia, have</p>
<p> deterred investment and have damaged the export performance of our</p>
<p> nation. And it was the elimination of those practices and the alteration</p>
<p> of the industrial climate in which those practices are allowed to</p>
<p> occur, that has been the objective of my Government since it has been</p>
<p> elected more than two years ago, and in relation to myself and my</p>
<p> Party, has been a single-minded industrial relations objective for</p>
<p> more than a decade.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, is the logic of what you were saying earlier to us</p>
<p> about a double-dissolution that you must call such an election before</p>
<p> the end of October?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well you can't have a double-dissolution unless the Parliament</p>
<p> is dissolved before the 29th of October. But let me say immediately</p>
<p> that I am not going to speculate about when, or if, such advice might</p>
<p> be tendered to the Governor General. I simply make the obvious legal</p>
<p> point that if I were minded to advise a double-dissolution, then I</p>
<p> would have to advise it in sufficient time for the dissolution to</p>
<p> be granted by the 29th of October. The timing of the election after</p>
<p> the granting of the double-dissolution would, of course, be a matter</p>
<p> for the Government but if there is to be a double-dissolution, and</p>
<p> I make no comment about that, other than to acknowledge, of course,</p>
<p> that a number of triggers now exist for such an outcome. If there</p>
<p> is to be a double-dissolution then the Parliament itself must be dissolved</p>
<p> by not later than the 29th of October this year.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, if I may, two of your predecessors, and I'm thinking</p>
<p> of Malcolm Fraser and Bob Hawke here, had double-dissolutions but</p>
<p> didn't follow them with a joint sitting. Following on what you</p>
<p> said earlier, if you want to have Wik resolved in the way in which</p>
<p> you do, that is really your only option isn't it?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well it would be a strange circumstance to have a double dissolution</p>
<p> inter alia on the basis of the rejection of the native title legislation,</p>
<p> win that double dissolution and then not have a joint sitting. I can't</p>
<p> imagine myself doing that.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>[Inaudible]...placed on giving certainty to the stakeholders, how</p>
<p> can you justify possibly delaying it twelve months before the people</p>
<p> decide?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I can't. If there's to be a double dissolution I've</p>
<p> got to tender advice to His Excellency well before the 29th of October.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>[Inaudible]</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, that is not my fault. I mean, we could have had the certainty</p>
<p> last night, we could have had it this morning, if the Senate had passed</p>
<p> the legislation.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Is a double dissolution election your only option now, Mr Howard,</p>
<p> or is possible you could have a bill that just covered the contentious</p>
<p> issues brought in after a half Senate election.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>It is the only one, according to my advice, yes.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>If you go to the polls [inaudible] if you use Wik as one of the double</p>
<p> dissolution triggers, will you guarantee Australians that hold free-hold</p>
<p> title, that their backyards are safe?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I will guarantee the Australian community the proper legal consequences</p>
<p> of the legislation that we're putting forward.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, you said that the Maritime Union had served its members</p>
<p> badly...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>The leadership of the Maritime Union, yes.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>And that the Government wasn't anti-unionist as such. But do</p>
<p> you concede that some of the people who have lost their jobs will</p>
<p> be innocents in this, that not all those people are, in your terms,</p>
<p> guilty of the work practices that are undesirable and so on, some</p>
<p> are victims of the union leadership?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>What I'm saying, Michelle, is that the ordinary members of the</p>
<p> union have been badly let down by their leadership. That's what</p>
<p> I'm saying and...</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>[Inaudible]</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, you asked me the question and I'll answer in the way I</p>
<p> think fit. The situation is that the ordinary members have been badly</p>
<p> let down by their leadership. It is an inevitable consequence of a</p>
<p> bargaining monopoly that has been held, enjoyed, exercised and ruthlessly</p>
<p> used by the wharfies, the Maritime Union of Australia, over a long</p>
<p> period of time.</p>
<p>And what has changed is that in March of 1996 a government was elected</p>
<p> with a mandate to break that monopoly. And it has always been my argument</p>
<p> - and you can look back over speeches and comments I've made</p>
<p> over a period of 10 or 15 years - that one of the maladies of Australia's</p>
<p> industrial relations system was the bargaining monopoly held by registered</p>
<p> unions. And our objection is not with unions. It has never been with</p>
<p> unions. Our objection has been to the fact that under the old law</p>
<p> unions had privileged positions, monopoly bargaining positions, which</p>
<p> they often used in a way that ill-served the interests of their members.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, could I just clarify - you mentioned about splitting the</p>
<p> Wik legislation. Does that mean to get the Wik legislation, to get</p>
<p> it through and to get it resolved, you're locked into a double</p>
<p> dissolution plan or you're still holding open the option of a</p>
<p> regular election with a half Senate election?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, what I'm saying is this, that I'm not speculating about</p>
<p> when and in what form the next election will be. However, I acknowledge</p>
<p> that there are three double dissolution triggers available and I'm</p>
<p> simply not going to say any more than that. And, quite plainly, when</p>
<p> one thinks about the next election you've got to remember that</p>
<p> we have a couple of significant events which are yet to occur. We</p>
<p> have a Federal budget on the 12th of May and we have the unveiling</p>
<p> of the Government's plans for taxation reform, which I've</p>
<p> indicated will take place before the next election. So there's</p>
<p> quite a lot of policy water to flow under the political bridge before</p>
<p> the next election takes place. But, look, I am simply not going to</p>
<p> be drawn, no matter how you phrase the question or how you put it,</p>
<p> I'm simply not going to be drawn as to speculation on the form</p>
<p> of the election or when it might occur, except to acknowledge that</p>
<p> if it is to be a double I've got to meet the 29th of October</p>
<p> and if I am to get the Wik legislation through, given the obdurate</p>
<p> attitude that the Senate has taken, then I have no alternative other</p>
<p> than to give certain advice.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, are you giving undertakings that we will see your</p>
<p> tax plan before the election is called or during the election campaign?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I repeat the undertaking I made in August of last year which, to the</p>
<p> best of my conscientious recollection and belief, without having refreshed</p>
<p> my memory on it before coming to this press conference, was that we</p>
<p> would unveil it in sufficient time to allow the electorate to make</p>
<p> a proper judgement on it.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, the general belief is that your position in the Senate</p>
<p> is likely to be much worse under a double dissolution election. Obviously</p>
<p> you've taken this into account. Do you believe that will be the</p>
<p> case?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, there is a possibility that it could be. But whether it will</p>
<p> be will depend on the voters. And I naturally don't concede anything.</p>
<p> We have now, what, five times six, one times five and two times one,</p>
<p> as far as the representation from the various jurisdictions is concerned.</p>
<p> Now, it depends on what happens. It will depend upon the mood in the</p>
<p> electorate, it will depend upon the attitude of voters and it will</p>
<p> depend upon the behaviour of different parties, particularly the smaller</p>
<p> parties. But, at the end of the day, you are elected to do things</p>
<p> and to govern and to implement commitments you've made. We made</p>
<p> a commitment to make the Native Title Act more workable. It</p>
<p> is plainly unworkable. It was plainly necessary to respond to the</p>
<p> High Court decision in Wik. We've done that. The Senate has rejected</p>
<p> it. So if the issue is to be resolved then it may be necessary to</p>
<p> have a double dissolution. But I have not made any decision on that</p>
<p> and I won't be speculating about, if and when, beyond what I've</p>
<p> already said.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>What happens in the Senate, Mr Howard, will also depend on what the</p>
<p> Liberal Party does about One Nation preferences. Are you any closer</p>
<p> to finding out a position on that, given what you've said about</p>
<p> race elections today?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, what I've said about race elections today is quite unrelated</p>
<p> to the question of distribution of preferences. I mean, the question...</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>No it's not.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes, it is - quite unrelated. The issue of whether or not something</p>
<p> is fought on the basis of race depends upon the attitude taken, the</p>
<p> words uttered and the use made of political differences in relation</p>
<p> to race. And, look, the answer to that question is that it will be</p>
<p> determined, as I said a year ago, probably 15 months ago, it will</p>
<p> be determined by the State organisations of the Party closer to the</p>
<p> election, which has long been the practice.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>How close did you come to a compromise with Senator Harradine or do</p>
<p> you think, in retrospect, it was never on?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, we were always ready to embrace a different way of achieving</p>
<p> the objectives we wanted, particularly in the four critical areas.</p>
<p> I had a number of discussions with Senator Harradine. And it must</p>
<p> be said that, in the final analysis, he wasn't in a very compromising</p>
<p> mood. Because at one stage we actually had what we wanted in relation</p>
<p> to the sunset clause and we also had what we wanted in relation to</p>
<p> the registration test. And, I guess, for a few fleeting hours it may</p>
<p> have appeared that there was a willingness on his part to change and</p>
<p> so forth. But in the final analysis we ended up actually having a</p>
<p> marginally less acceptable bill the second time around than we did</p>
<p> the first time around. Because a number of the less than high profile</p>
<p> amendments, that were inserted by the Senate, have actually made it</p>
<p> a little bit worse than what it was in December of last year.</p>
<p>So, I guess I have to say that, despite the amiability and the cordiality</p>
<p> of the discussions that took place between myself and Senator Harradine,</p>
<p> perhaps it was never on. But I'm not seeking to make any personal</p>
<p> reflection on Senator Harradine in relation to that. If you want to</p>
<p> know what his state of mind was on it, I think you should ask him.</p>
<p> I won't seek to speak for him.</p>
<p>I was always ready to have a look at a proposal that would have achieved</p>
<p> the objectives we wanted in a different way. I was never prepared</p>
<p> to surrender, in relation to those four principles, because they went</p>
<p> to the very essence of what we wanted to do.</p>
<p>I have to say again that what the farmers of Australia wanted was</p>
<p> to implement what Paul Keating said to be the position in 1993. And</p>
<p> that is, the grant of a valid pastoral lease totally extinguished</p>
<p> native title. And it was always a disappointment to the farming community</p>
<p> of Australia that the Government was unwilling to do that. But we</p>
<p> didn't believe that was right, for the reasons that I have outlined</p>
<p> at great length in the past. And that is why, I think, what we put</p>
<p> forward was a compromise and to compromise on a compromise was quite</p>
<p> unreasonable. And I, of course, regret that the Senate has chosen</p>
<p> to deny the certainty that I believe the community wants on this issue</p>
<p> but it's made that judgement. And, either through a double dissolution</p>
<p> or an ordinary election, it will be for the people of Australia, as</p>
<p> it should be the case in a democracy, to resolve this matter. And</p>
<p> I say again that there is a form of specialist arrogance that says</p>
<p> that the people of Australia are incapable of handling a sensitive,</p>
<p> decision-making process.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>There's a difference between being disappointed with a law or</p>
<p> a High Court decision and upholding it. There are many people who</p>
<p> say that you're simply abrogating what the High Court did in</p>
<p> the Wik decision.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>We are doing what governments for time immemorial have done and that</p>
<p> is that if the law, as declared by the courts is, in the view of the</p>
<p> government, in need of change then we seek to change it. Your question,</p>
<p> with respect, proceeds upon a complete misunderstanding of the respective</p>
<p> roles of the courts and the parliament in our system of government.</p>
<p> It is the role of the courts to declare the common law, interpret</p>
<p> the statutes of parliament. It is always within the power of the parliament</p>
<p> - and that's what it exists to do - to alter the law providing</p>
<p> it follows the proper constitutional processes. And that is exactly</p>
<p> what we've endeavoured to do. I mean, the proposition that the</p>
<p> Parliament of Australia has never altered the law, as declared by</p>
<p> the High Court of Australia, is absurd. They've been doing it</p>
<p> for 98 years, from the very early days of Federation.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, given that the Wik issue is about the respective rights</p>
<p> of indigenous Australians and non-indigenous Australians, how can</p>
<p> you avoid an election, fought partly on Wik, becoming a race-based</p>
<p> election?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I think it can be avoided if it is conducted in a proper fashion by</p>
<p> the principle participants.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>On the waterfront, Mr Howard, was there any alternative to the way</p>
<p> that the company [inaudible] acted this way to achieve your goals?</p>
<p> And, secondly, is there scope for the Government to support the company</p>
<p> in the legal battle it now faces?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I mean, what the company does, ultimately, is a matter for the</p>
<p> company. I mean, the Government is not the agent of the company and</p>
<p> the company is not the agent of the Government. I don't answer</p>
<p> for what the company has done. We changed the law and the company</p>
