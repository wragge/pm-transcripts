TRANSCRIPT OF QUESTION AND ANSWER SEGMENT WITH JOHN<br />
MCINTOSH, SATELLITE HOOK-UP TO NEW YORK AUSTRALIAN<br />
INVESTMENT CONFERENCE 28 SEPTEMBER 1989<br />
E 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
MCINTOSH: Good morning. It is John McIntosh and I am<br />
talking to you now from the Metropolitan Club in New York,<br />
which was the Club founded by J. T. Morgan so we are here<br />
gaining inspiration. I have got some questions for you. We<br />
have a limited amount of time, I understand, so I might<br />
break five minutes before the half hour is up to ask you if<br />
you have some comments to make to our very enthusiastic and<br />
full audience here tonight.<br />
PM: Right John.<br />
MCINTOSH: My first question, Mr Prime Minister, is<br />
according to a Bureau of Agricultural and Resource<br />
Economics, commodities accounted for 85% of Australia's<br />
total merchandise exports of the 88-89 year. That is down<br />
only marginally from 88% in 1984-85. What this suggests to<br />
me is that despite the big falls in the $ A a few years back,<br />
despite the substantial levels of investment which you say<br />
is going on, the Australian economy is still dependent as<br />
ever it was on volatile commodities. Do you think this will<br />
ever change? Should it? And if so, can you tell us what<br />
policies you are pursuing to reduce Australia's exposure to<br />
fluctuations in commodity prices?<br />
PM: Well thank you John. There is no question that<br />
primary commodities are going to continue to be a<br />
fundamentally important part of the Australian economy as<br />
far as we can see into the future. Because we are blessed<br />
in this country in many ways which together makes us amongst<br />
the world's most efficient producers of agricultural<br />
exportable products and of course the vast resources of<br />
minerals which go right across the range, of which your<br />
audience is aware. So let's understand that those<br />
commodities are going to continue to be fundamentally<br />
important. But we haven't been content just to sit there<br />
and say well we are going to leave it at that, because that<br />
leaves us far too exposed, as you know, to fluctuations in<br />
world commodity prices. So we are moving to change that<br />
profile of exposure to diversify our economy and to take<br />
advantage of the fact that we have in this country a highly<br />
skilled workforce, a well-educated community, and that we </p>
<p>have the geographical proximity to the fastest growing<br />
economic region in the world. And we are moving in a whole<br />
range of ways to take advantage of that. Let me say that<br />
there are indications of the sort of changes that we want to<br />
see, John. If you look at the area of service exports, for<br />
instance, they were some 40% higher in this last financial<br />
year in real terms than they were two years ago. And<br />
manufactured exports similarly were about 16% higher in real<br />
terms than they were a couple of years ago. Business<br />
investment in Australia is now, as a result of our policies<br />
in the whole area of macroeconomic management, at the<br />
highest level and the highest proportion of our gross<br />
domestic product than it has been ever recorded at 13.5%.<br />
There have been 15.5% real increases in business fixed<br />
capital equipment investment in each of the last two years<br />
which is an extraordinarily high figure. And so you can see<br />
that the things are happening there in the investment terms<br />
to diversify our economic structure. Let me give you some<br />
examples of where we are moving in the right direction. For<br />
instance, we have got five projects worth $ 150 million in<br />
the food processing industries, four are worth nearly $ 100<br />
million in textiles. These are just some examples of the<br />
way in which we are moving to give value added processes<br />
here to the fundamental commodities that we produce. In the<br />
area of steel, BHP has a current investment worth about $ 600<br />
million, which will again help us to cater for niche exports<br />
in that sort of market. And so what we are really doing,<br />
and we are doing it in our macroeconomic policy and our<br />
microeconomic reform, creating an environment for business<br />
of which they are taking advantage to gradually but very<br />
significantly change the profile of exposure of Australia so<br />
that we will have both the strength of our commodity exports<br />
but taking advantage of a growing capacity for exports of<br />
services and manufactured goods.<br />
MCINTOSH: You have emphasised on other occasions that<br />
Australia does not subsidise its farmers, does not subsidise<br />
its coal miners, and has embarked upon a five year program<br />
of tariff reductions. Yet in other parts of the world,<br />
including the US, the trend in recent years has been towards<br />
increased protectionism and ' managed' trade. How long can<br />
Australia stand aside from these global trends?<br />
PM: Well, we are going to continue John, to take a leading<br />
role within the multilateral trade negotiations and<br />
bilaterally to try and bring the world to its senses. We<br />
have got a position where we established in 1986 the Cairns<br />
Group of Freetraders. There we have already established<br />
that Cairns Group as a significant and permanent group in<br />
the Uraguay Trade Round Negotiations that we were<br />
instrumental, I think, in breaking the deadlock that<br />
occurred in Montreal at the end of last year and getting the<br />
resumption of those talks going from April of this year in<br />
Geneva. So we are very very much committed with likeminded<br />
countries to making the world understand what is the<br />
economic truth. And unfortunately, I think, in the United<br />
States the leadership level, as in Europe at leadership </p>
<p>-3-<br />
level and Japan, we haven't got to sell the story of the<br />
economic insanity of increasing protectionism. The fact is,<br />
of course, that the cost and price structure of Europe and<br />
the United States and Japan is much higher than it need be<br />
because of the pursuit of false protectionist policies. If<br />
you take the United States, for instance, the OECD estimates<br />
that in last year, 1988, the United States subsidised its<br />
agricultural producers to the equivalent of about $ 38<br />
billion. And the estimates at Congress suggest that<br />
commodity price support programs alone cost $ 13 billion.<br />
Now the simple reality to that, John, which I imagine your<br />
audience completely understands, is that if you go beyond<br />
the economic legitimacy of self sufficiency, which is a<br />
legitimate aim for any country, and then go into a process<br />
of subsidising your producers, then what you do is escalate<br />
your domestic cost and price structure. It means you are<br />
less competitive. It means there is relatively less<br />
employment opportunities available. Now we understand those<br />
truths. We are going to keep telling them. And I think<br />
there is some hope for the future. I certainly have got a<br />
positive response, when I was in the United States earlier<br />
this year, explained these realities. I think they were<br />
accepted. Of course the bottom line is not the<br />
understanding of the economic truths, it is a question of<br />
political will. And fortunately I think that there are<br />
forces lining up in Europe amongst manufacturers and<br />
organised consumers and workers which are saying, look we<br />
have had enough of being taken for a ride by a small<br />
minority. When you have something at less than 10% of<br />
population who are, significantly less than ten per cent,<br />
being amongst your primary producers. And they are the tail<br />
that is wagging the whole community dog. It doesn't make<br />
sense. And so we are going to keep telling that story.<br />
MCINTOSH: I want to ask a question about the pilots<br />
dispute. In this country, the Reagan Administration's<br />
response to the air traffic controllers' strike in 1981<br />
marked a watershed in labor relations, and the beginnings of<br />
a decline in union power. In this dispute you have<br />
authorised the use of taxpayers' funds to aid the airlines,<br />
the use of military and foreign strike-breakers to do the<br />
work of pilots, and the use of common law remedies to impose<br />
penalties on striking pilots. Do these actions set a<br />
precedent for dealing with future relation problems, or<br />
should we see this issue in isolation.<br />
PM: Well I think it is essentially an isolation for this<br />
reason. That the organised trade union movement in this<br />
country, John, has pulled it completely into line in support<br />
with the uniquely Australian consensus wages accord<br />
approach. And the essence of that as you know, is that the<br />
trade union movement here has agreed to exercise very<br />
considerable wage restraint in respect of claims for<br />
increased money wages in return for which we as a government<br />
have increased the social wage in terms of providing<br />
universal health and hospital coverage, infinitely increased<br />
expenditures in the area of education and social welfare so<br />
that those social wage elements have been increased. And </p>
<p>-4-<br />
for that the trade union movement has accepted lower money<br />
wage increases. Now because we have that general support,<br />
and we have had a situation where, as is being recognised,<br />
there has been a shift from wages to profits, which the<br />
trade union movement recognises. There-has been an historic<br />
shift from wages to profits which has enabled the massive<br />
investment that has taken place which in turn creates a more<br />
competitive structure of the economy which provides more<br />
secure employment. The union movement as a whole supports<br />
that. Now the pilots wanted, if I can use an Australian<br />
phrase, they have wanted five bob each way. They wanted to<br />
take all the advantages of the improvements in the social<br />
wage, that is the tax reductions that have occurred. They<br />
have got the top tax reductions. Improvements in<br />
superannuation. They have got the top superannuation<br />
packages while ordinary workers are getting their first<br />
taste of this. So the pilots have grabbed all the increases<br />
in the social wage, which have come from a mass of workers<br />
forgoing excessive money wage increases, and pilots say<br />
alright we will grab all that of the increased social wage<br />
but we will have the excessive money wage increases as well.<br />
Well the Government is saying, the airlines are saying, and<br />
the trade union movement is saying, that is not going to<br />
happen. So there is a unique sort of situation here in<br />
which we have felt it proper to use all the strength at our<br />
command, including some of the things that you have talked<br />
about. But that is not attacking the pilots as such. What<br />
it is doing is to protect a system which, as I say, has<br />
produced for workers in this country an increase of one and<br />
a half million jobs which is a rate job improvement, job<br />
increase, twice as fast as the rest of the industrialised<br />
world. Twice as fast. And improvement in the social wage.<br />
All those things have come with profits increasing,<br />
investment surging. That is what we are fighting to<br />
protect, and what we will do.<br />
MCINTOSH: Your Treasurer has said that the blow-out in<br />
Australia's current account deficit reflects the surge in<br />
business investment spending. I have some doubts about<br />
where all this investment is going. If you visit Australia<br />
a lot of it seems to be going into office blocks in Sydney<br />
and Melbourne. And a couple of charts in your most recent<br />
Budget documents show that the proportion of the investment<br />
going into trade exposed industries, industries which will<br />
help pay off all the foreign debt, is shrinking. Can<br />
foreign investors be confident that Australia can in fact<br />
service the additional debt that you have taken on over the<br />
past two years?<br />
PM: Well I am grateful for that question John, and I think<br />
you are aware of what is happening here and these trends in<br />
Australian investment do need to be looked at in the<br />
appropriate context. Now it is the case that total<br />
investment is at record levels. I have indicated that<br />
investment as a proportion of gross domestic product is at<br />
the highest level ever recorded. And if you look at it in<br />
five year terms the Treasury documents show that the rate of<br />
investment increase in-this last five year period is light </p>
<p>years beyond what has been happening before. Investment,<br />
John, in non-commodity trade and industries has risen very<br />
considerably since we came to office in 1983 and it has more<br />
than doubled over the period. There was a strong investment<br />
in commodity tradables in the early 1980s which, as you<br />
know, was associated with the resources boom in this<br />
country. Since 1985 investment in commodities has been<br />
fairly stable in the range of about three to four billion<br />
dollars per annum. Investment in so-called non-tradables<br />
has increased rapidly since 1987 and it is quite clear, as<br />
you will appreciate, that a lot of that investment will<br />
contribute directly or indirectly to foreign exchange<br />
earnings. I mean, as you know, investment in buildings and<br />
so on, which may be classified as non-tradable, can<br />
contribute very significantly to foreign exchange earnings<br />
through the leasing of office space to relevant companies.<br />
For instance, the resources and manufacturing sector. So<br />
that distinction is not always a real one. And similarly,<br />
of course John, non-tradable area includes the services<br />
sector, which includes the financial services and it is very<br />
clear, as you personally know, that investment in this area<br />
has given Australia a capacity to sell consulting and other<br />
services overseas. So the business sector, John, does not<br />
lack confidence in Australia in any sense. To the contrary.<br />
As you know most of the increase in foreign debt over recent<br />
years is attributable to the private sector. The fact is,<br />
of course, that as a Commonwealth, as a nation, the<br />
Government, we don't owe debt, we are a net creditor. But<br />
what has been happening is that you have had enormous<br />
investment by the private sector because they have made the<br />
commercial economic judgement that out of the investment<br />
that they make in this country they are able to earn<br />
sufficiently to them, and not only to service that debt in<br />
interest and in capital terms but to return a profit. And<br />
that is of course what has happened. If you look at, in the<br />
particular areas, there are many significant projects which<br />
are forging ahead now with the active involvement of foreign<br />
investors. I mean if you look in the minerals and energy<br />
area, we have just seen the north-west shelf project which I<br />
was opening the other day. Now in total that is a massive<br />
project involving some $ 12 to $ 13 billion investment and<br />
we've just started the first flow of liquid LNG to Japan and<br />
that's going to build up in the 1990s to export income for<br />
this country to the order of two or three billion dollars<br />
per annum. In tourism you're aware of the enormous<br />
investment there. In heavy industry we've got four major<br />
mineral processing projects at the moment involving a total<br />
capital outlay of around half a billion dollars, all due to<br />
come on stream by the end of 1990. In the aerospace<br />
industry Hawker deHavilland have a 20% share in a project to<br />
produce the new NBX helicopters in Australia which is going<br />
to generate something like $ 400 million in export earnings<br />
in its first ten years of production. So we have a<br />
situation there as I say. We owe no net Commonwealth debt<br />
as a government. What we are seeing and I've just given<br />
you some examples of it a situation where over 60% of the<br />
debt is owed by the private sector and it reflects these<br />
sort of investments which are going to provide substantial </p>
<p>-6-<br />
export earnings for us in the future. In other words what<br />
is being established John is a pattern of growth with an<br />
investment surge, rapid employment growth and with tight<br />
Government policies in the fiscal, wages and monetary area<br />
so that the pattern of production, the pattern of growth is<br />
being set in a way which while it is incurring as I say a<br />
debt at the moment by the private sector is being done in a<br />
way which they will be able to repay and which will create<br />
for Australia a very very significantly stronger economic<br />
structure and export earning capacity into the future.<br />
MCINTOSH: Last week we saw the announcement of another<br />
record current account deficit. Are the Government Budget<br />
forecasts still on track?<br />
PM: What we do when we draw up the Budget John, and I<br />
suppose what the major businesses do, you have to rely on,<br />
you use the best econommic analysis available to you. Ours<br />
is very good. Our Budget was drawn up relying on the best<br />
economic analysis available to the Government. May I just<br />
say these things about the August figures which I think are<br />
worth noting. I'm not trying may I say to your audience<br />
John and ladies and gentlemen I'm not in any sense trying<br />
to give some sense of complacency about the figures. We<br />
know that they are large and the general strategies we've<br />
got in place are directed towards creating a level of<br />
activity which overall will mean a level of imports which is<br />
sustainable and which we can purchase. But nevertheless let<br />
me say this about the August figures. It is a seasonally<br />
high month for imports and it was a surge of imports in the<br />
current account figures for August, it was the surge of<br />
imports rather than any decline in exports which brought<br />
that deficit. It also had two more trading days in August<br />
than in July which is a factor which is generally more<br />
significant for imports than for exports. There were the<br />
two one-off factors of a Qantas jet and one of these LNG<br />
ships that I was talking about with the shelf project.<br />
Those serve to push the August figure up somewhat but both<br />
Paul Keating and I have said that for the first six months<br />
of this financial year we expect these figures to be<br />
somewhat high. But the basic problem has been of course<br />
that we've had a level of demand running higher into this<br />
year than we could've expected before. Our policies<br />
therefore are directed, our wages policy, our monetary<br />
policy, our fiscal policy, are directed towards reducing<br />
that level of demand. But could I also make this point<br />
which is related to the answer I just gave a moment ago<br />
John. If you look at the composition of those import<br />
figures you'll see that the biggest increases are in the<br />
categories of other transport equipment and machinery, most<br />
of which of course is composed of investment goods. This<br />
investment growth will certainly, as I say, add to<br />
Australia's productive capacity. So bringing it all<br />
together the figures were too high, there were some special<br />
factors in it, but if you look at the composition of the<br />
imports that are coming in they are building up a stronger,<br />
more diversified, economically competitive export oriented<br />
industry in this country. Our macroeconomic policies will </p>
<p>-7-<br />
gradually bring down the overall level of demand in this<br />
country so that we will, we believe, get a sustainable<br />
position on our external account. But the important thing<br />
for your audience to know is that what we are about in this<br />
country is getting investment, including investment from<br />
overseas, to be part of this restructuring of the Australian<br />
economy which is going to produce, as I say, a more<br />
competitive and more diversified Australian economy.<br />
MCINTOSH: In the last few days the $ A has moved up towards<br />
cents, partly on the back of very high interest rates in<br />
Australia. Do you believe this to be a short term move? If<br />
not does it have any bearing on the outlook for interest<br />
rates?<br />
PM: You are obviously into an area where I must be very<br />
careful in what I say because any comments by a Prime<br />
Minister or a Treasurer can of themselves almost guarantee<br />
spurts one way or the other. So I must be very very careful<br />
in what I say but I don't want to avoid your question John.<br />
As you know, the value of the Australian dollar is<br />
determined by market forces. We floated the dollar and its<br />
level is determined by market forces, market forces in<br />
turn reflect many many factors. Reflect Australian interest<br />
rates, reflect Australian commodity prices and also of<br />
course in a residual sense the value of the Australian<br />
dollar will reflect to some extent the sentiment about a<br />
number of other overseas currencies. When you take all<br />
those things into account it causes the $ A to fluctuate<br />
within a broad trading range. I'm not going to comment or<br />
speculate upon movements in those various factors which can<br />
cause movement in the $ A within that range. Do note however<br />
I think it's relevant to observe for your audience that<br />
since early this year the dollar has fallen from about 89 US<br />
cents to be about 78 cents at the present. That movement in<br />
that period does reflect some advantage for the<br />
competitiveness of our trading industries. On the question<br />
of the interest rate outlook, well of course I have to be<br />
particularly careful there. But the level of interest rates<br />
is partly related of course to the stamps of official<br />
monetary policy. I make clear again, as I have been<br />
directly in previous answers, that monetary policy has been<br />
tightened and it has been tightened deliberately by the<br />
Government over the period as part of our general approach<br />
to try and bring down activity to a level which is<br />
consistent with our capacity to sustain a given level of<br />
imports. So we have had tight monetary policy together with<br />
tight fiscal and wages policy. I think your audience knows<br />
and you certainly know John about the tightness of our<br />
fiscal policy where we've now had another huge surplus, our<br />
Budget surplus, and we have now the fourth successive<br />
reduction in real Commonwealth outlays and a turnaround, as<br />
you know, in the net public sector borrowing requirement<br />
from a minus situation into plus. So our monetary policy<br />
has been tight and that's been reflected in interest rates.<br />
I just want to make these two points about our monetary<br />
policy and interest rates. As an intelligent bloke and as a<br />
politican, an intelligent politician, I'm not going to have </p>
<p>interest rates higher for one day longer than is necessary.<br />
I mean I'm not a masochist. I'm not here to try and hand<br />
Brownie points to my political opponents. That's not my<br />
caper. What my caper is is to do the thing which is<br />
economically responsible for this country John. At this<br />
time it requires a continuation of tight monetary policy.<br />
We're not going to further tighten it, I don't think that's<br />
necessary. But we're not going to keep it tighter for one<br />
day longer than necessary, but I'm not going to loosen it<br />
one day sooner than is necessary. So there won't be any<br />
upward pressure on interest rates coming from a tightening<br />
of monetary policy. But, as I say, like the le vel of our<br />
interest rates reflect a combination of a number of<br />
factors. This Government, this Australian Labor Government,<br />
has done what our conservative predecessors never had the<br />
wit, the will, the wisdom, the guts, the courage or anything<br />
to do. That is we have created a competitive situation.<br />
We've floated our exchange rate and we've created a<br />
situation now where we are a competitive market-oriented<br />
economy which in the fiscal area has produced outcomes which<br />
I know many in your audience would like to see done in the<br />
United States. You'd like to see a pruning of government<br />
expenditure in a rational way which would produce a budget<br />
surplus. We've done all that and created great employment<br />
increase in the process. Now out of all that what happens<br />
to your level of your dollar, what happens to your interest<br />
rates reflects, as I say, a number of market factors. I'm<br />
not going to speculate beyond what I've said as to what will<br />
happen there.<br />
MCINTOSH: ( inaudible)<br />
PM: There is no doubt, speaking both through my mind and<br />
may I say perhaps more importantly in this case my pocket,<br />
the Hawkes will win. There is a lovely correlation. The<br />
Hawkes have been in the Grand Final each year for the life<br />
of my Government and I think that's a happy correlation. So<br />
I'm sticking with them. They will win.<br />
MCINTOSH: As in the US, Australia currently has a very<br />
tight labor market and historically low unemployment, yet<br />
wages growth seems to be quite moderate by Australian<br />
standards. Can we be assured ot the continuing cooperation<br />
of the ACTU with the Government to keep wage growth down and<br />
in particular will there be another wage-tax trade-off in<br />
1990?<br />
PM: Yes I'd just like to say these things. As you know we<br />
have established this is not just my statement but the<br />
statement of your successive presidents Reagan and Bush.<br />
The relationship between our two countries has never been<br />
warmer, more productive than it is now. Sure we have our<br />
differences but we regard the relationship with the United<br />
States as remarkably important. We welcome your investment<br />
here, we offer you a country of well-disposed people to the<br />
United States. We share the fundamental principles of<br />
commitment to liberty and equality of opportunity. We have<br />
a highly trained workforce here. We're well-placed </p>
<p>-9-<br />
strategically to the fastest-growing economic region in the<br />
world. We want to work together with you to add to our<br />
mutual economic benefit and to the benefit of the region and<br />
to the world as a whole.<br />
MCINTOSH: ( inaudible)<br />
PM: Thank you John, thank you.<br />
