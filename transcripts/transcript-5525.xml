PRIME MINISTER<br />
CANBERRA 24 February 1981<br />
j<br />
PRINCE OF WA'LES<br />
The monarchy is interwoven in Australian life in a very real<br />
and vital way. The Crown is part of our constitutional<br />
processes of Government. -Feeling for the Royal Family is<br />
0 deep-seated in the emotions of many Australians, and we all<br />
share and enjoy the public occasions which add colour to Qur<br />
contemporary scene. Each of us can look back on events in<br />
our own lifetime affecting the Royal Family and they stand out<br />
in our memory.<br />
Tonight-is such an occasion.<br />
Her Majesty the Queen has announced from Buckingham Palace the<br />
engagemz---of His Rdyal Highness the Prince of Wales to<br />
Lady Diana. s Spencer. The announcement has been conveyed to his<br />
Excellen-i the Governor-General and to the Australian Government.<br />
On beha cf the Goverrnent, and all Australians, I welcome the<br />
annoupct with great pleasure and extend congratulations and<br />
good wisas to Prince Charles and Lady Diana..<br />
I am not able to say that the announcement has caught the<br />
Australian people entirely unaware or unprepared. The media has<br />
assisted us in, at times, graphic detail. But thus prepared I<br />
can say with even greater assurance that we applaud the announcement<br />
and look forward with excitement to the pageantry of a Royal wedding.<br />
Australian people hold PrinceCharles in special regard. From the<br />
completion of his schooling here as a young man, and his subsequent<br />
five visits to Australia, we have come to recognise and applaud his<br />
sense of humour and his dedication; his outgoing personality and his<br />
concern for people. He has spoken many times of his affection for<br />
Australia and Australians. We have a great affection for him,-in<br />
which his wife-to-be will now share.<br />
Prince Charles will be visiting Australia again later this year and<br />
he will be given a warm welcome. I do not know when we might have<br />
the great pleasure of welcoming Lady Diana to Australia but whenever<br />
that is, I am certain that the welcome will be equally warm, equally<br />
affectionate.<br />
The Crown gives us a focal point in our development as a nation and<br />
links us with our history and our origins. The significance of the<br />
monarchy is not diminishing. It is not fading in Australian<br />
consciousness. I., </p>
<p>-2-<br />
The Queen and her family are part of a living and relevant:<br />
institution, which in Australia is'very much tied to our<br />
ownm institutions and emotions. We all share with Her Majesty<br />
the Queen and Prince Philip, and the other members of the<br />
Royal Family, the joy of this particular occasion and to them<br />
also we extend our good wishes.<br />
I shall be conveying our sentiments" to Prince Charles and<br />
Lady Diana, and to Her Majesty the Queen, on behalf of all<br />
Australians. oo00oo---</p>
