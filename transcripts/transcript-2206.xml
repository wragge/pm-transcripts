FOR PRESS: P. M. No 45/ 1970<br />
INCREASE [ N LIMITS OF LIABILITY FOR AIRCRAFT<br />
Statement by the E: rime Minister, Mr. John Gorton<br />
The Commonwealth Government proposes to amend its,<br />
legislation relating to compensation payable to injured passengers or the<br />
dependants of passengers killed in domestic aircraft acciden'ts. The<br />
proposed amendments are designed to improve the position of air<br />
travellers, or their dependants, in this respect.<br />
The Civil Aviation ( Carriers' Liability) Act, prescribes the<br />
liability of airline operators in the event of aircraft accidents. In the case<br />
of domestic operations, an airline is liable for damages arising from an<br />
accident taking place on board its aircraft whether or not it was responsible<br />
for the accident, and the Act specifies $ 15, 000 as the maximum amount<br />
of damages payable in respect of any one passenger.<br />
The Government believes that this limit on damages sh ould<br />
now be raised to $ 30, 000, and that provision should also be made for early<br />
interim payments to the surviving spouse and children of a deceased<br />
passenger pending assessment of the damages payable. The limits of<br />
liability in respect of damaged or destroyed baggage will also be increased.<br />
At present, the Act applies only to passengers carried by the<br />
airlines, and the Government intends to extend its provisions to cover<br />
passengers on all charter flights, commuter services and joyrides etc.<br />
so far as Commonwealth powers permit.<br />
As the Commonwealth legislation relates primarily to<br />
interstate operations, the various State Governments have enacted laws<br />
applying the same rules to intrastate air services. I have written to the<br />
State Premiers seeking their views on the Commonwealth's proposals and<br />
asking for their co-operation in having comparable amendments made<br />
to their legislation in due course.<br />
The Government will introduce the necessary amending<br />
legislation into Parliament at the earliest opportunity.<br />
The Government would like to see changes in' the Carriers'<br />
liability arrangements applicable to international services operatedto and<br />
from Australia, but these are subject to an international convention which<br />
has been ratified by Australia. Worldwide consideration is currently being<br />
given to increasing the limit of liability in respect of international passengers,<br />
but the Government has concluded that, as it will be some time before any<br />
finality could be reached in this matter, it should deal with the legislation<br />
affecting Australia's internal air services separately and as soon as<br />
possible. CANBERRA I April 1.970 </p>
