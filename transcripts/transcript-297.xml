<p>MEETING OF COMMONWEALTH PRIME MINISTERS<br />
FINAL COMMUNIQUE MARCH 17th, 1961<br />
The Meeting of Commonwealth Prime Ministers was concluded to-day.<br />
Pakistan, Ghana and Cyprus were represented by their Presidents. The other<br />
Commonwealth countries were represented by their Prime Ministers.<br />
It had been agreed that on this occasion the Prime Ministers would<br />
concentrate their main attention on a limited number of specific problems which<br />
are currently of common concern to them all namely, disarmament, the structure<br />
of the United Nations and certain constitutional problems affecting the<br />
Commonwealth itself. At the outset of the Meeting, however, the Prime Ministers<br />
held a general review of the international situation as a whole, in order to set<br />
these particular problems in the perspective of current world events. They also<br />
considered, in the course of their Meeting, recent developments in the Congo<br />
and in South East Asia.<br />
The Prime Ministers re-affirmed the support of their Governments<br />
for the efforts of the United Nations to restore order in the Congo and to<br />
secure the independence and integrity of the Republic. They deplored outside<br />
intervention in the Congo and recognised that many of the problems which had<br />
arisen were due to such intervention. They considered that the United Nations<br />
forces in the Congo should be strengthened and that the Security Council<br />
resolution of 21st February should be fully implemented.<br />
The Prime Ministers noted with concern the situation which had<br />
developed in Laos. They expressed the hope that the parties would be able to<br />
reconcile their differences, that intervention from outside would cease, and that<br />
Laos would be enabled to enjoy an indepeRdent, neutral and peaceful existence.<br />
The Prime Ministers held a full discussion on the problem of<br />
disarmament. They recognised that this was the most important question facing<br />
the world to-day and considered that a favourable opportunity was now at hand<br />
for a fresh initiative towards a settlement of it. They agreed that the aim<br />
should be to achieve general and complete disarmament, subject to effective<br />
inspection and control, on the general lines indicated in the statement in<br />
Annex 1 of this communique. They recalled the resolution on general and<br />
complete disarmament which was adopted unanimously at the 14th session of the<br />
General Assembly. They agreed that every effort should be made to implement<br />
this resolution by agreement between the major powers, and that further<br />
negotiations for this purpose were necessary. Certain proposals designed to<br />
promote such negotiations have been put by various countries before the United<br />
Nations. </p>
<p>The Prime Ministers expressed their hope that the negotiations on the<br />
cessation of nuclear weapons tests, which were due to re-open at Geneva on 21st<br />
March, would lead to the early conclusion of an agreement on this subject.<br />
Such an agreement, apart from its importance in itself, would provide a powerful<br />
impetus towards agreement on disarmament generally.<br />
The Prime Ministers considered the various proposals which have<br />
recently been put forward for changes in the structure of the United Nations<br />
including, in particular, the structure of its Councils, the position of the<br />
Secretary-General and the organisation of the Secretariat. They recognised<br />
that such changes could only be made with general consent. They agreed that,<br />
whatever adjustments might be made, it remained vitally important to uphold<br />
the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter and to preserve the<br />
international and independent character of the Secretariat. They further agreed<br />
that members of the Commonwealth shared with all nations a fundamental common<br />
interest in maintaining the integrity of the United Nations as a force for<br />
orderly political, economic and social progress throughout the world.<br />
The Prime Ministers also discussed certain constitutional<br />
questions relating to Commonwealth membership. The conclusions reached were<br />
announced in communiques issued on 13th, 15th, and 16th March relating,<br />
respectively, to Cyprus, South Africa, and Sierra Leone. The text of these<br />
communiques is reproduced in Annex 11. </p>
<p>ANNEX 1<br />
STATEMENT ON DISARMAMENT<br />
Aim<br />
S 1. The aim must be to achieve total world-wide disarmament, subject<br />
to effective inspection and control.<br />
2. In view of the slaughter and destruction experienced in so-called<br />
" conventional" wars and of the difficulty of preventing a conventional war,<br />
S once started, from developing into a nuclear war, our aim must be nothing<br />
less than the complete abolition of the means of waging war of any kind.<br />
Principles 3. An agreement for this purpose should be negotiated as soon as<br />
possible, on the basis of the following principles<br />
All national armed forces and armaments must be reduced to the<br />
levels agreed to be necessary for internal security.<br />
Once started, the process of disarmament should be continued without<br />
interruption until it is completed, subject to verification at<br />
each stage that all parties are duly carrying out their undertaking.<br />
The elimination of nuclear and conventional armaments must be so<br />
phased that at no stage will any country or group of countries<br />
obtain a significant military advantage.<br />
In respect of each phase there should be established, by agreement,<br />
effective machinery of inspection, which should come into operation<br />
simultaneously with the phase of disarmament to which it relates.<br />
Disarmament should be carried out as rapidly as possible in<br />
progressive stages, within specified periods of time.<br />
At the appropriate stage, a substantial and adequately armed<br />
military force should be established, to prevent aggression and<br />
enforce observance of the disarmament agreement; and an international<br />
authority should be created, in association with the United Nations,<br />
to control this force and to ensure that it is not used for any<br />
purpose inconsistent with the Charter. </p>
<p>2.<br />
4. On the basis of the above principles, it should be possible, given<br />
goodwill on both sides, to reconcile the present differences of approach<br />
between the different plans put forward.<br />
Negotiations The principal military powers should resume direct negotiations<br />
without delay in close contact with the United Nations, which is responsible<br />
for disarmament under the Charter. Since peace is the concern of the whole<br />
world, other nations should also be associated with the disarmament negotiations,<br />
either directly or through some special machinery to be set up by the United<br />
Nations, or by both means.<br />
6. Side by side with the political negotiations, experts should<br />
start working out the details of the inspection systems required for the<br />
measures of disarmament applicable to each stage, in accordance with the<br />
practice adopted at the Geneva Nuclear Tests Conference.<br />
7. Every effort should be made to secure rapid agreement to the<br />
permanent banning of nuclear weapons tests by all nations and to arrangements<br />
for verifying the observance of the agreement. Such an agreement is urgent,<br />
since otherwise further countries may soon become nuclear powers, which would<br />
increase the danger of war and further complicate the problem of disarmament.<br />
Moreover, an agreement on nuclear tests, apart from its direct advantages, would<br />
provide a powerful psychological impetus to agreement over the wider field of<br />
disarmament. 8. Disarmament without inspection would be as unacceptable as<br />
inspection without disarmament. Disarmament and inspection are integral parts of<br />
the same question and must be negotiated together; and both must be made as<br />
complete and effective as is humanly possible. It must, however, be recognised<br />
that no safeguards can provide one hundred per cent protection against error Or<br />
treachery. Nevertheless, the risks involved in the process of disarmament<br />
must be balanced against the risks involved in the continuance of the arms race.<br />
9. It is arguable whether the arms race is the cause or the result of<br />
distrust between nations. But it is clear that the problems of disarmament and<br />
international confidence are closely linked. Therefore, while striving for the<br />
abolition of armaments, all nations must actively endeavour to reduce tension by<br />
helping to remove other causes of friction and suspicion. </p>
