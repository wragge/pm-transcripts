Prime Minister Julia Gillard today congratulated 40 Australians who have been recognised for their outstanding work in building strong and cohesive local communities.</p>
<p>The 40 local champions have been independently selected as the new People of Australia Ambassadors following hundreds of nominations from the public.</p>
<p>Australians were encouraged to nominate inspirational people who have helped to build bridges, promote inclusion and strengthen ties in their communities.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister and Parliamentary Secretary for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs Kate Lundy announced the new Ambassadors in Melbourne today.</p>
<p>They were joined by football champion and new Ambassador Harry O'Brien, who is actively involved in the AFL's own Multicultural Program and engaged in a variety of community projects.</p>
<p>The Ambassador program is a key initiative of the Gillard Labor Government's multicultural policy, The People of Australia, announced last year.</p>
<p>The 40 Ambassadors now have a new platform to promote their good work and share their ideas and initiatives that can help inspire others.</p>
<p>The Gillard Government recognises good work that is happening in our communities and that good work deserves to be championed at the national level.</p>
<p>The new Ambassadors will be able to provide advice to Government and the Australian Multicultural Council.</p>
<p>Their contributions will help assist and strengthen the Government's multicultural policy.</p>
<p>The Ambassadors have been recognised for the real impact they are having on the lives of many Australians - from bringing kids together through sport, to helping small business owners from diverse backgrounds get up and running.</p>
<p>The inaugural Ambassador program speaks to the strength of our Australian communities and our capacity as a nation to welcome people and make them feel part of our community.</p>
<p>The 2012 Ambassadors' term commences today and ends on 30 December 2012.</p>
