    <content><![CDATA[<p>Itâs very fitting to be here at Ground Zero.</p>
<p>This is an extraordinarily sombre place.</p>
<p>Itâs really quite overwhelming to be in this place, on this spot, where some 2,900 people were killed â including 10 Australians â in one of the most horrific moments in world history.</p>
<p>I pay my respects to all who died that day.</p>
<p>I particularly acknowledge the 10 Australians who died that day.</p>
<p>I remember all the emergency services personnel who responded on that terrible day â particularly those who died.</p>
<p>I guess above all else, though, we cherish the freedom which was under assault that day.</p>
<p>We should never forget that the 9/11 bombers were people who hated us, who hated our way of life, because we are free people: we are countries and civilisations which believe that everyone should be free to live their own life, to worship their own god, to do their own thing.</p>
<p>We should cherish that way of life which is so magnificent and yet which sadly is still so hated by fanatics around the world.</p>
