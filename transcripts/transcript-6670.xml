PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 11 JULY 1985,<br />
A top-level official joint Chinese-Australian<br />
co-ordinating group will promote long-term co-operation<br />
in the transport sector between Australia and<br />
China. The Australian Minister for Transport, Mr Peter Morris,<br />
will have responsibility for transport policy aspects of<br />
this impor tant Government-to-Government co-operation<br />
programme. The on-going co-ordinating group will be Co-Chaired by<br />
Mr Zhao Weichen and Mr John Dawkins, Australian Minister<br />
for Trade.<br />
The establishment of the co-ordinating group at this<br />
high level is a major step forward in Australia's<br />
relations with China.<br />
Agreement to estab lish the co-ordinating group was<br />
reached last week in Beijing by Sir Peter Abeles, leader<br />
of the Australian Transport Mission, and Mr Zhao<br />
Weichen, Vice Chairman of the State Economic Commission<br />
of China.<br />
The Australian Transport Mission visited China from 23<br />
June to 6 July, in accordance with the understanding I<br />
reached with the General Secretary of the Chinese<br />
Communist Party, Hu Yaobang, in Canberra in April.<br />
During the visit to China the Transport Mission met<br />
General Secretary Hu Yaobang, Vice Premier Li Peng, Vice<br />
Chairman Zflao Weichen and other senior representatives<br />
of the State Economic Commission, as well as Ministers<br />
representing the State Planning Commission, the ministry<br />
of Communications, the Ministry of Railways, the<br />
Ministry of Aviation Industry, the Ministry of Posts and<br />

The new group will co-ordinate inter-Governmental<br />
relations in the transport sector, and will also<br />
establish a framework for a wide range of private trade<br />
and commercial opportunities.<br />
The establishment of the joint co-ordinating group will<br />
open the way to a mutually beneficial exchange of ideas<br />
and expertise.<br />
This could involve co-operation in transport economics<br />
and management, railways, highways and bridges, ports<br />
and harbours, transport equipment maintenance services,<br />
bulk and container cargo handling and air services.<br />
Within Government-to-Government co-operation, one<br />
proposal under consideration is for Chinese air<br />
controllers to be sent to Australia for training.<br />
Another involves Australia sending experts to China to<br />
discuss Australia's relevant experience in low-cost<br />
highway construction.<br />
The Australian Council of Trade Unions, which was<br />
represented on the Transport Mission, has agreed to<br />
co-operate in the training of Chinese transport<br />
executives in Australia.<br />
Meetings of the joint co-ordinating group will be held<br />
annually, alternately in each country. Australia will<br />
host the first meeting, possibly in October this year.<br />
Sir Peter Abeles, Managing Director of Thomas Nationwide<br />
Transport Industries and Joint Managing Director of<br />
Ansett Transport Industries, leader of the Transport<br />
Mission, Mr Paul Barratt, Trade Ambassador-for North<br />
Asia of the Australian Department of Trade, deputy<br />
leader,' ' and other senior members of the Transport<br />
Mission will meet with transport industry<br />
representatives in the near future. The Transport<br />
Mission members will brief industry representatives on<br />
the outcome of the Mission and likely future<br />
opportunities for co-operation. </p>
