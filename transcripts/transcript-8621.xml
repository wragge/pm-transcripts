TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KDTINO MP,<br />
O&amp; A SESSION, AUSTRALIAN FINANCIAL RErVIEW POST BUDGET<br />
DINNER, RECENT HOTEL, SYDNEY, 19 AUGUST 1992<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
Q: Prime Minister, last week the Treasurer in<br />
consultation with the Governor indicated that there<br />
would be no more cuts in interest rates in this<br />
cycle, yesterday that position was reported to be<br />
qualified. Could you please clarify that?<br />
pm: You mean, would you like me to make your job easier?<br />
what we say is that given that the inflationary<br />
performance that we've been able to secure, that's<br />
with inflation rates, the statistical inflation<br />
rates below 2 per cent, and 2 per cent again in<br />
forecasts for this year, that it will be our<br />
performance on inflation and inflationary<br />
expectations which generally governs what we do on<br />
monetary policy, and also the conditions within the<br />
economy. I think we would say that at this point<br />
rates have fallen far enough, but if you want me to<br />
say they won't be falling any further under any<br />
circumstances I won't be saying that, won't be<br />
saying that.<br />
Q: Prime Minister, with regards to theFBT proposal on<br />
car spaces could I ask firstly, who will supply the<br />
car spaces where the person using the car requires<br />
the car for his or her business? And secondly, will<br />
it apply to car spaces at Parliament House in<br />
Canberra?<br />
PM: I don't think so, but you know the Departments of<br />
State pay'to the Treasury. We make the appropriate<br />
adjustments in terms of fringe benefit payments.<br />
And I know things like this are dear to the hearts<br />
of many here, but the fact of the matter is that<br />
fringe benefits tax is a tax so that cash, or<br />
substitutes for cash, for goods taken in kind are<br />
appropriately taxed. Now when the fringe benefits<br />
tax was established In ' the middle of the late 1980s<br />
some concessional treatment was given, particularly </p>
<p>77TEL: 20. Aug .92 18: 03 No .012 P. 02/ 1<br />
2<br />
with relation to motor cars and other things, and In<br />
this case in parking, and I think all we are<br />
essentially doing is tidying up an anomaly in the<br />
design of a tax.<br />
Q: Treasurer, it's9 how I remember you Paul.<br />
PM: Loyalty, even after they leave us.<br />
Q: A bit of a statement, you've been associated with<br />
all but one of the past ten Budgets, end a quick<br />
count this afternoon was six mini Budgets, and over<br />
this period the Budget balance was moved from<br />
substantial deficit back to surplus, then back into<br />
deficit. Was this experience and your views changed<br />
by the role of fiscal policy and the economic<br />
adjustment proes na -wth respect to influencing<br />
income net distribution?<br />
PM: I don'It think so. No, I think that in the early<br />
1980s it was appropriate to expand fiscal policy for<br />
the Government, with private investment down, to<br />
substitute for public investment and public<br />
spending, and as then the recovery came through and<br />
we saw boom conditions for most of the ' 80s, fromi<br />
the middle to the late ' 80s, it was then also<br />
appropriate to withdraw that stimulus and produce a<br />
surplus, or surpluses. But now in these conditions<br />
where the economy is finding it difficult to grow<br />
with the sort of speed we would like, although for<br />
the public sector I think, and the Government and<br />
the Budget and fiscal policy, in promoting that kind<br />
of recovery is I think important. That is, that in<br />
terms of the shorter term movements in the cycle of<br />
the economy, fiscal policy has an important, I<br />
think, balancing role to play. That is, where in<br />
the past people have believed that moeaY 0i<br />
was the instrument most quickly to cpal of<br />
this, I mean people have often said, commentators of<br />
fiscal policy, the lags are too long, and the lead<br />
times are too long, whereas the monetary levers were<br />
available at the hand of the Central Bank. But as<br />
we know the monetary impacts take quite some time to<br />
come through and it may well be, I think it probably<br />
is, the case that fiscal policy may be a more speedy<br />
remedy in some cases to the national economic<br />
condition. And so I think that the trick is to use both<br />
instruments together, and of course with it wages<br />
policy as well. And that is why we take the view<br />
that in a complex society, a complex economy,<br />
reliance upon simply one instrument isn't enough and<br />
that's why we differ with the Opposition in<br />
believing that, for instance, now where we have got<br />
a Budget deficit of $ 13, billion or about 3.3 per<br />
cent of GDP, that it would be an entirely<br />
inappropriate thing to do to cut that in half, to </p>
<p>TE: 20. AU9.92 18: 03 No. 01* 2 P. 03/.<br />
3<br />
withdraw 07 billion from public spending and<br />
stimulus. That is, to take 2 per cent of GDp from<br />
it would simply kill the recovery stone dejad. That<br />
is entirely the wrong thing to do as our friend Dr<br />
Hewson, is urging us to do. The wrong thing to do.<br />
So I think fiscal policy has got a sort of medium<br />
term role about it, and it is a role which we played<br />
through the ' 80saend we are still playing now. But<br />
those who simplistically believed that I believed<br />
only in surpluses and that now I should continue to<br />
believe in them even though the economy has been<br />
much weaker and that private spending and private<br />
investment has been lower, then of course that's<br />
wrong. I don't believe that and I never have. I<br />
think fiscal policy has a very useful role to play<br />
and a Government which wants to play it well, that<br />
Is to design measures carefully and be cognisant of<br />
the stimulus and the lags which can come with it,<br />
can be using a very a useful device in the economy.<br />
So I think fiscal policy is an exceptionally useful<br />
thing and it ought to be used sensibly, and can be,<br />
and I think we are using it sensibly. We have<br />
produced now in this year Budget outlays of 4.1 per<br />
cent of GDP real. The population is growing at 1.6<br />
per cent so we have got about 2.5 per cent of the<br />
outlays grove as part of, if you like, the stimulus<br />
in this year's Budget. It is entirely the right<br />
thing to have.<br />
Q: Mr Prime Minister, what resources or assistance is<br />
the Federal Government prepared to contribute to<br />
actively promoting the Sydney Olympics 2000<br />
campaign? And more importantly, howoes the<br />
Government view the prospects of success for this<br />
campaign?<br />
Pm; Well I contributed on behalf of the Commonwealth<br />
million to the campaign at a breakfast. They<br />
must have had something in the Weetbix, I don't know<br />
what it was but it was something there. And I have<br />
coughed to the tune of $ 5 million on behalf of the<br />
rest of us, and 5 now is better now than 5 later.<br />
And as well as that the Commonwealth is going to<br />
underlie a substantial proportion of the cost in the<br />
event that the bid is successful. And at this stage<br />
it seems that were the matter be decided now, I'm<br />
told that Sydney has been faring very well. I can<br />
only hope that remains into a year ahead, in<br />
September next year when the decision is taken. But<br />
the Federal Government is behind the bid, we think<br />
it would be important to Sydney and Australia and<br />
that's why we've put our money on the line in the<br />
early stages to help the bid succeed.<br />
0; Prime minister, is the Government concerned that the<br />
change in tax status of limited partnerships may in </p>
<p>TEL: 20. Fiug. 92 18: 03 NO. 012 P. 04/ i1<br />
4<br />
fact discourage investment, equity Participants in<br />
infrastructure projects? And is this In fact in<br />
conflict with the Government's -agreed agenda that<br />
these projects are in the national Interest?<br />
PM: I don't think so. I think one has Just got to makce<br />
decisions about these sorts of devices before they<br />
start running. I think that is exactly what we have<br />
done now, to think about all of the regulatory<br />
structure we have established for companies. ' There<br />
is no real point in letting people get their way<br />
around that, all in the meaning of development. We<br />
have given Australians, anyone who wants to invest<br />
in this country, a choice of instruments, either as<br />
sole traders or as single investors, or as trusts,<br />
or as partnerships, or as companies. In many<br />
countries of course equity is taxed twice, companies<br />
are taxed twice, a tax at the compony level and the<br />
distribution of their dividends are taxed as income.<br />
This is not so in Australia. With dividend<br />
imputation, largely we tax company income once. So<br />
therefore there is complete neutrality between the<br />
of companies as a vehicle and these other<br />
things. Now the States to try to, I think, drag some revenue<br />
their way have tried to interest investors in<br />
setting up as limited partnerships, and the<br />
attraction for many people is it means they walk<br />
around in a regulatory structure which we have for<br />
companies. Now I don't think that we want to<br />
develop another stratum in investment in a way which<br />
permits that to happen. That is, the mature thing<br />
to do is to basically keep the company structure<br />
such that all the cheques and balances we have now<br />
developed, often learning lessons painfully, some of<br />
the ' 80s lessons, mean that we should keep that<br />
company structure in place. Before these things<br />
start running away on us now is the time to act, and<br />
I think we have.<br />
Q: As a large section of the older unemploy d are<br />
retrenched people from the finance sector, what area<br />
of retraining do you recommend for these people?<br />
Pm: well if you're a former Treasury officer, come back.<br />
Q: And before you dismiss me, I live in Barton.<br />
PM: Yes, but are you one of ours? Look, we are seeing<br />
rationalisations, we have seen them now really from<br />
the late ' 80s onwards, as the heady days of<br />
financial deregulation and high salaries for all<br />
sorts of people, have bought companies, financial<br />
intermediaries to their knees and they have had to<br />
make adjustments. ' And5 part of that has been in the<br />
business they have been doing and the staff they<br />
have been hiring. I think I can only say that as </p>
<p>1% Ir* economy grows again more strongly over the<br />
course of this year, and banks start lending again,<br />
and when the financial system starts to work again,<br />
then some of those natural employment opportunities<br />
are going to open up. Now I wouldn't think it would<br />
ever get back to the sort of levels of employment of<br />
the mid to late but again that remains to be<br />
seen. I em not certain where the surfeit of people<br />
from the financial industry should go. But I will<br />
say there is a Commonwealth program for you all<br />
somewhere.<br />
Q: Mr Keating, in the early 1980s you were a very<br />
fervent supporter of a broad based consution-taxthrough<br />
your own option C. Could you please explain<br />
what lead you to discard a policy that you obviously<br />
so strongly believed in?<br />
At Because I couldn't get the wage discounts that<br />
should have come with it. That is, I didn't have a<br />
right any more then anyone else did to blow the<br />
national inflation rate to pieces by manicly<br />
pressing on and adding 5 or 6 or 7 percentage points<br />
to the price system and then letting it drift into<br />
wages. So I tried to use those processes to secure the wage<br />
agreements that would see us accommodate such a<br />
change with decelerating inflation. That was one<br />
reason. The second reason was that the direct tax<br />
system, the income tax system was so severely<br />
hemorrhagi. ng that really most people in the off icial<br />
family gave up on this repair. That is they thought<br />
it was so badly neglected and had so many conceptual<br />
holes that the payment of income tax became entirely<br />
an elective matter. And with support of the then<br />
High Court that many people in the bureaucracy<br />
believed that it wasn't capable of repair. So we<br />
decided that one thing we would do is catch them<br />
when they spend them. That was if it was sl. ipping<br />
through income tax net to tax expenditure and<br />
collect some of it there.<br />
Now when the consumption tax proposal under Option C<br />
was then denied to me for the reasons I just gave<br />
you, we then went and repaired the income tax base<br />
so much so that compliance levels came back up, we<br />
put a capital gains tax into the system, fringe<br />
benefits, all these other various devices to tax<br />
income properly. And the end result is we've got<br />
now one of the most secure, complied with tax<br />
systems in the world.<br />
So there was now no point in taxing expenditure.<br />
But to go taxing expenditure now, to blow the<br />
inflation rate back into double digits from the low<br />
2 per cent we have after 20 years of wearing the<br />
blight of inflation,* to., do it Simply in the name of </p>
<p>TEL: 20. Aug .92 18: 03 No .012<br />
6<br />
some ideology with no prospect Of wage discounts,<br />
but worse believing and selling it as a cure eli to<br />
all the nation's problems, not just a simple tax<br />
switch which Option C was, but selling it as come<br />
sort of elixir or remedy is, of course, simply naive<br />
and dishonest in the extreme. And that's why now a<br />
switch to expenditure from income is a tenth order<br />
matter, and at this stage this nation has got more<br />
to do with its time and its attention with things<br />
like enterprise bargaining, workplace reform,<br />
training end education and the reel structural<br />
transition issues, it's got more to do than worry<br />
about a dangerous tax shift which will simply blow<br />
the inflation rates to bits.<br />
So if It can't be done with low inflation it<br />
shouldn't be done. And at 15 per cent with poor<br />
compensation for low paid people and a very big<br />
burden as Dr Hewson proposes 15 per cent on all<br />
people to have the proceeds driven by way of a<br />
reduction in payroll tax and excise on petrol. You<br />
understand that cleans the proceeds of the<br />
consumption tax out. The tax cuts don't come from<br />
the consumption tax, they come from cuts in<br />
government spending. The whole of the proceeds of<br />
the consumption tax comes are devoted to the<br />
abolition of pay-roll tax and the reduction of<br />
petrol excise.<br />
So with when you put forward a proposition to<br />
working Australians of low income that they should<br />
have their food taxed, their clothing taxed or their<br />
services taxed so that pay-roll tax should be<br />
abolished but petrol made cheaper, it'. a rotten<br />
deal, a rotten deal, and it's a deal that I think,<br />
Australians in the end won't wear. Now the<br />
Coalition wanted to be different, to propose<br />
something different. What they're really doing is<br />
proposing something extraordinarily dangerous. And<br />
the trouble is even if they know it, they're not<br />
obviously letting on, but they can't but help know<br />
it. The obvious point also is that if someone is on<br />
$ 25,000 a year or $ 30,000, whether we tax their<br />
income or their expenditure is immaterial. They are<br />
one in the same thing because someone on that level<br />
of income has no savings. So whether you tax their<br />
income or their expenditure it is one in the same.<br />
But the person on $ 150,000 a year has savings and<br />
yet you are only taxing their expenditure. So what<br />
you'll see is a huge transfer of wealth from the low<br />
paid to the high paid. And does anyone thinks that<br />
with such a transfer on, they'd all have the support<br />
they are now getting in the labour market for low<br />
inflation, wage restraint,, high profits,<br />
productivity bargaining, productivity increases all<br />
of that will simply be under assault as a </p>
<p>TEL: 20. Aug. 92 18: 03 No. 012 P. 07/ 1<br />
7<br />
conservative government tries to shift wealth from<br />
the lower orders of the income ranges up to the<br />
higher orders by a very unfair and regressive tax.<br />
And that's why I think it won't wash. And even<br />
properly compensated would be a total extravagance<br />
at this time in our economic history, but<br />
uncompensated it's a piece of barbarism, fiscal<br />
barbarism which I think would be rejected.<br />
0: Prime Minister, if you go back over the Budget<br />
papers for the last four years or so, it appears<br />
that the main objective of monetary 20lic? has<br />
shifted from the current account, or equivalent the<br />
excess domestic demand, to inflation. Was this<br />
shift because the current account actually increased<br />
as interest rates were raised and declined as rates<br />
were eased? Has this experience of the late 1980s<br />
influenced official thinking about the role and<br />
impact of monetary policy following the floating of<br />
the Australian dollar? And finally, if faced by<br />
widening current account deficit in the future, will<br />
the government again raise interest rates to try and<br />
reduce it?<br />
PM: Where did the current account debt come from? It<br />
came from the fact that we were running a balance of<br />
trade deficit, that we couldn't pay for our imports.<br />
The Liberal Party after 30 years of office was so<br />
bereft that it basically left us with a position<br />
where they relied on commodities, and commodities<br />
let us down. Above all, in 1980s we were running a<br />
current account surplus of 6 per cent of GDP, it<br />
was from trade or the absence of it that the current<br />
account debt developed and started to derail rapidly<br />
under an uncompetitive regime, and rose to about 38<br />
per cent of GOP by the middle 1980s. Now it was<br />
that growth in the trade deficit which produced the<br />
current account debt.<br />
At the moment we're now running a strong balance of<br />
trade surplus. In other words, if we were not<br />
dealing with the accumulated debt and the net income<br />
deficit Australia would have made one of the<br />
substantial economic adjustments to a higher level<br />
of exports and import replacement and a better trade<br />
balance. But that's not the position because we've<br />
still got the net income deficit to deal with.<br />
So it means, I think, that we've got to produce more<br />
goods and services. That is that the correct<br />
response for Australia is a supply side response.<br />
That is, we've got to put in more productive plant<br />
and equipment and produce more value added, which<br />
we are doing of course in elaborately transformed<br />
manufactures end all ! sorts of manufactured exports,<br />
as well as in agriculturg, and as well as in<br />
minerals. </p>

go while monetary policy will always have a role in<br />
demand management of some kind, so too does f iscal<br />
pD9l4cy. But in terms of the current accountT<br />
think Australia has to press on until its Supply<br />
capacity starts to catch up with the net income<br />
deficit. And that's going to take time but that's,<br />
I think, our only course. Because to try and sit on<br />
the place and hold it down, this sort of double<br />
digit unemployment, if that were seen to be the<br />
remedy for the current account deficit, will I think<br />
be a mistake because socially it wouldn't hold and<br />
wouldn't last and it wouldn't deal with the problem<br />
anyway. So I think monetary policy has its role to play,<br />
it's obviously got a role to play in price<br />
stability, it's got a role in demand management anid<br />
again as Bernie Fraser said so eloquently during the<br />
week, it's got to be done with all of the<br />
instruments together. And that's why running a<br />
complex economy is a complex matter where complex<br />
judgements have got to be made, and some simple<br />
resort to some draconian monetary policy to try to<br />
deal with demand and inflation is, of course, only<br />
the view of simpletons, and of course that's exactly<br />
where I put Dr Hewson.<br />
Q; Mr Prime Minister, could you please comment on the<br />
economic performance of New Zealand and your<br />
forecast for New zealand for the current financial<br />
year?<br />
PM: Look, I know that there is a bit of a sport<br />
developing in the media about New Zealand and<br />
frankly it's not a sport I like. I don't like it<br />
and I think it's a great shame that the Liberals<br />
have decided to try to come back to Australia and<br />
push New Zealand down our neck, our throat. But let<br />
me make a couple of points because I have never<br />
accepted, never, that one introduces structural<br />
change like economic change, but not in the<br />
transition with growth and activity.<br />
Now in the 19809 In Australia, we had an enormous<br />
structural transition from an inward looking closed<br />
economy to an outward looking one. We had such<br />
things as the removal of exchange controls, floating<br />
of the exchange rate, the opening up of the<br />
financial system, the reduction in tariffs. But it<br />
was all accommodated with an employment related<br />
policy. That is, with the agreement we had with the<br />
trade unions we sought to run the economy faster and<br />
to turn the proceeds of growth to employment rather<br />
than to see them spill away in a price and wage<br />
round, or worse, not havq that growth at all<br />
believing only that micro-economic or structural </p>
<p>TEL: 20. AU9.92 18: 03 NO. 012 P. 09/ 1<br />
change should be accommodated at the Cost of higher<br />
levels of unemployment.<br />
I never accepted that view. I never accepted the<br />
Lange/ Douglas view, never. I thought it was an unf-<br />
Labor thing to do and I think it today. And I said<br />
in the House yesterday and it's worth repeating that<br />
when I beca&amp; me Treasurer there were 6 million people<br />
in the Australian labour market, there is now 7.6<br />
million; it's over 25 per cent larger. ina New<br />
Zealand, the labour market today Is exactly the same<br />
size, in fact it is a little smaller than it was in<br />
1983. That is, a decade on it's labour market has<br />
actually fallen or got smaller. The other<br />
Interesting point I think is that we had more growth<br />
in the Australian economy then the 1980a than there<br />
wasn total product in the New Zealand economy. That<br />
Is, more growth in the Australian ecznomy than there<br />
was total GDP in the New Zealand economy. And I<br />
think those two facts speak for themselves. That<br />
Is, a generation were left behind in New Zealand by<br />
a Government that should have devoted itself to them<br />
all in the name of microeconomic change,<br />
microeconomic change which in the end let down those<br />
people. Now it may be that New Zealand is picking<br />
Itself up and growing, and I hope it is, but it is<br />
certainly about time it is, it's a decade too late.<br />
Q: Prime Minister with the forecast to 10.5 per cent<br />
unepl~) Metrate for this financial year, which is<br />
the same as what it was on average for last<br />
financial year, how are you possibly going to win<br />
the next election?<br />
A: Well It makes it difficult for us. I don't think<br />
anyone but a fool would deny that. But the<br />
elections in this country should be decided by the<br />
governments who have been prepared to change<br />
Australia. And this Government took Australia from<br />
a backward frightened economy, inward looking<br />
economy, to an outward aggressive economy where<br />
structural change and change in the nature of our<br />
industrial base became the order of the day. And<br />
those changes continue apace to this very day. And<br />
in the speech i gave you earlier I talked about the<br />
quite revolutionary change in vocational education,<br />
which I was able to announce in an historic<br />
agreement between the Commonwealth and the States to<br />
create a structure to sit beside the universities in<br />
vocational -education, and as well, in the huge<br />
number of places which have been added to our<br />
tertiary capacity in education over the last half a<br />
dozen years.<br />
Those sorts of changes are the things which will<br />
remake Australia. we'should be out there selling<br />
our brains, selling innov ative products, getting a<br />
margin on clever things, not going out there to </p>
<p>. RUS92 18: 03 No. 1<br />
compete with low cost countries doing basically the<br />
things they are doing In cutting the wages of<br />
Australians whil~ e trying to do it. That's not the<br />
clever thing, that's the dumb thing. That's the<br />
thing that Raewson wants to do, go back to 3 bucks an<br />
hour anid put people on basically low wages, to<br />
produce products we should be long out of, rather<br />
than go into the products which require education,<br />
and which require research and development,. and<br />
product innovation. They are the things we need.<br />
This Government has been the Government which has<br />
given Australia an open market economy. It maybe a<br />
great irony that it took a Labor Government to give<br />
Australia a true open market economy, but in doing<br />
so grafted onto it one of the finest social policies<br />
in the world access to health, access to<br />
education, reformation of the social security<br />
system, reformation of education system, and<br />
occupational superannuation, long term savings in<br />
retirement. It's been basically a social revolution<br />
at the same time accommodated with the opening up in<br />
a modern way of an economy.<br />
They're the things in which the Government will seek<br />
re-election and why shouldn't it seek re-election<br />
and why shouldn't it be re-elected? And as we go on<br />
through the period when that unemployment comes<br />
down, we'll go into the 1990s with a low<br />
inflationary period, historically low levels of<br />
inflation, lower interest rates, a more productive<br />
country, national savings being rationed to the<br />
right places and not the wrong places by the banking<br />
system after having been through the first phase of<br />
deregulation, the learning phase, and where we'll go<br />
with a smart society to do clever things in the<br />
Asia-Pacific.<br />
I mean, that's the vista that Labor holds up. What<br />
does Dr Hewson hold? Basically, it's the Gordon<br />
Gecko view of the world, greed is good, survival of<br />
the fittest, if you're not a millionaire you're a<br />
lay about, if you want health protection go and pay<br />
for it, if you want to put your kids through<br />
university let your old man cough up 15 or<br />
thousand bucks a year to put you through. That's<br />
his view. That's why I don't think he is going to<br />
win.<br />
0: if I can just follow up, does that mean you think<br />
you can win the election with 10 per cent<br />
unemployment?<br />
PM: Of course I do, of course I do. Why would I waste<br />
my time on some of you jokers if I didn't?<br />
Q: Mr Keating, lastinight I listened quite attentively<br />
to Mr Dawkins explain the need for Australia to </p>
<p>TEL: 20. AUg. 92 18: 03 No. 012 P-11/ 1<br />
develop our manufacturing Industris Could you<br />
please explinto me how an extra $ 335 million of<br />
local government expenditure will assist our<br />
manufacturing industries rather than just<br />
contributing to the number of council workers I see<br />
propped up by shovels?<br />
PM: That's not a very clever question, I've got to say,<br />
not a very clever question.-So If you're looking<br />
for marks I'd reward you low marks. Now let me give<br />
you the answer. Unlike you, there are people out<br />
there unemployed. And they're unemployed through no<br />
fault of their own, they've been denied the<br />
opportunity society can offer them. And one of the<br />
great tragedies of unemployment is that people lose<br />
their melt esteem, and they think society doesn't<br />
want them and that they are of no use. And they get<br />
locked out of doing some of the very useful things<br />
the rest of us can do with the right of keeping<br />
their self esteem up. And as well an that they lose<br />
the opportunity to go and take on full time<br />
employment, because as they are more stigmatised by<br />
unemployment their opportunities wane. That's why<br />
labour market programs, exist around the world.<br />
That' 1s why we'll put 400,000 people through the<br />
Commonwealth's labour market programs this year.<br />
And that's why $ 345 million to regional areas of<br />
Australia, which is particularly hard hit by<br />
unemployment, will be a useful thing to do, to give<br />
those people work experience, and also to do work on<br />
projects for which there's obviously always a<br />
pressing need in local government, often and<br />
invariably underfunded as it is. it's always<br />
struggling for revenue because rates are the basic<br />
areas of its income &amp; part from direct payments from<br />
the Commonweal. th. And therefore, financial support<br />
for these sorts of projects in local communities is,<br />
I think, important. You made the point about, and<br />
of course need I say necessarily, it means that in<br />
societal terms those people are getting a go and<br />
they might not otherwise, which makes things just<br />
better generally.<br />
Now, you made the point about how are we going to be<br />
a more clever country? The answer is, by doing<br />
clever things. By putting more kids through<br />
university, by getting retention rates up in<br />
schools. I mean, how the Liberals could have ever<br />
thought we could have been a clever country with 3<br />
kids in 10 completing secondary school, God alone<br />
knows. With 7 out of 10 children basically<br />
untrained, how we could have ever been approaching a<br />
very smart country. Those retention rates in<br />
secondary school are now 7 in 10 and they are now<br />
heading for 9 in 10, and the appropriate proportion<br />
of them will go through university, and the balance<br />
of them will now 6~ e picked up in a mature vocational<br />
education system. </p>
<p>TEL' 20. Rug. 92 18: 03 NO. 012 I?. 12/ I<br />

That's how we're going to be producing the sort of<br />
things, and the focus on research and development,<br />
the focus on product inno-vaton, then higher prof its,<br />
the competing exchange rate all are of that enormous<br />
story of exports through the 1980s. We've literally<br />
exported our heads of f through the ' B809 producing,<br />
in many respects, elaborately transformed goods.<br />
And there's no, the link that you make, which is<br />
basically saying look, if they're not producing<br />
something smart forget them, if they're out there<br />
unemployed in Fairfield, in Bankatown where I'm<br />
from, or Western Melbourne or Northern Melbourne,<br />
forget them. That's the view that says you don't<br />
really want a society like this, that you're putting<br />
no premium on social value and no premium on<br />
harmony, and not taking responsibility, but in a<br />
country with large structural change and<br />
particularly where demand is falling, that there's a<br />
responsibility on the Government to deal with<br />
unemployment. That's a responsibility I accept, and<br />
particularly where demand is falling, a<br />
responsibility on the Government to deal with<br />
unemployment. That's a responsibility I accept and<br />
one which I think society accepts. That'. why I<br />
think your link between smart goods and smart<br />
products and 335 million local councils is not a<br />
proper link and not an appropriate link and one<br />
which I think would be a great mistake for<br />
Australians to believe should be made.<br />
Q: We've seen a lot of deregulation and rationalisation<br />
in the period of your Government. I wonder if it's<br />
time now for the next step in that, to remove one<br />
layer, or to give Australians the opportunity to<br />
remove one layer from the Government structure<br />
within Australia, move to a two tiered structure,<br />
and possibly to elect you as our first President?<br />
PM: Thank you for the compliment, thank you but no<br />
thanks. Look, can I just say this. It is a fact of<br />
our constitutional life and history that we have<br />
States and local government, and if we were going to<br />
the drawing board Australia would probably be more<br />
appropriately governed regionally. That's not the<br />
case. That's not the case today.<br />
So I think the thing to do is to work cooperatively<br />
as a nation. And the work which we've done with the<br />
States in recent years is, I think, quite profound<br />
in terms of success we've been able to bring in the<br />
last 12 months in such things as a National Rail<br />
Authority, and beefing up the development in<br />
national rail in this country, in the development of<br />
an East Coast Electricity Grid, where we separate<br />
power generation fronfi distribution to create for the<br />
first time a real market for electricity that could<br />
only be done by cooperation between States and the </p>
<p>TEL: 20. RU9.92 18: 03 No. 012 P. 13/ 1<br />
Commonwealth Government, in the creation of the<br />
National Training Authority where formally the role<br />
of the States in technical and further education<br />
became a dual role between themselves and the<br />
Commonwealth. These sorts of areas of cooperation,<br />
I think, can mean that in Australia, in things like<br />
uniform regulation and uniform standards which we've<br />
now agreed upon, are a good way and I think the only<br />
way to be running Australia.<br />
Now, one ca never be entirely overtaken by with<br />
that bonhomie end give the States taxing powers and<br />
let them split the Commonwealth Budget up and the<br />
rest, because the Commonwealth Government should run<br />
the nation's economy and run fiscal policy. Within<br />
that, though, there's no cause why we can't have a<br />
cooperative structure. And in doing that we have<br />
the best of Australian governments, and the best<br />
coming out of Australian governments and the<br />
Australian people, I think, have been really well<br />
served. Now, what our constitutional history holds in the<br />
future only the young among you will know, but I<br />
don't see it changing radically, not in my political<br />
lifetime. And so the other view is to make the<br />
existing structure work, and I think we're making it<br />
work and I think Australians are getting value from<br />
the relationship between the Commonwealth and the<br />
States.<br />
0: My question relates to something I read recently in<br />
the weekend newspapers, and it relates to your<br />
tastes in music. I think you were quoted that at<br />
times you liked Tom Jones, which I certainly do, but<br />
also opera, but both at full volume. And I wondered<br />
if either one of these or both combined contributed<br />
to your political acumen?<br />
Pm: my political acting?<br />
Q: Acumen.<br />
PM: Acumen?<br />
0Q. Not acting, no.<br />
Pm: We're all actors, I don't resile from that. Well,<br />
it's not a Budget matter, let me say. But I think<br />
if one is passionate about things and in politics,<br />
and in political life, one has to be to do it, then<br />
it's entirely likely one would be passionate about<br />
other things. And one of the things I happen to be<br />
passionate about is music, and I think that at times<br />
when my spirits have flagged, and over the years<br />
that's every now and again, not too often, then the<br />
Resurrection Symphony'I of Mahler's or something<br />
appropriate to the story like that, or even one of </p>
<p>TEL: 20. Aug. 92 18: 03 No. 012 '. 144.1<br />
Strauss' songs or something of that order, does<br />
revive one's flagging spirits. And if I feel<br />
perhaps a little more uplifted I can actually turn<br />
the clock back to the ' 608 and listen to a bit of<br />
twelve bar blues, a bit of good ' 01 rock In roll and<br />
all that. But I must say that I'm basically on the<br />
classical end of the spectrum these days, even<br />
though I keep the old library at hand.<br />
0: Mr Prime minister, this question will be very simple<br />
because you've virtually answered it earlier in the<br />
evening. Do you think the Australian manufacturers<br />
have the product range and capacity at competitive<br />
prices to meet the rise in demand which will occur<br />
when~ the economy recovers without a blowout in the<br />
balance of payments?<br />
J: Well I think probably in the first instance it<br />
always takes a while to get that full capacity<br />
utilisation levels back, because in any system where<br />
it's running at part capacity it takes a while for<br />
that response, for people to start rehiring people,<br />
and to meet demand, which may in the first instance<br />
be met in some part by Imports. But as we get our<br />
wind back and start to pull full capacity out of the<br />
system, I think that will be less the case. And<br />
there was a lot of capacity installed in the 1980s,<br />
I think people forget this. There was a terrible<br />
lot of capacity installed and it's now not being<br />
fully utilised, it's being seriously underutilised,<br />
and as we build back I think we will find a lot of<br />
domestic demand is satisfied by that. I think it<br />
would also be the case that the investment<br />
environment in the ' 909 will be so good in terms of<br />
inflation, interest rates, the tax system, cost of<br />
capital, depreciation, productivity, labour<br />
relations, and with the highest levels of<br />
profitability going to the traded goods sector of<br />
the economy. That we will see more investment<br />
instilled in plant and equipment, in productive<br />
capacity, when we saw in the ' 806 that some of the<br />
investment went into real estate, construction,<br />
office towers, shopping centres, at cetera. And<br />
given the fact now that the old belief in Australia<br />
that inflation in property has waned substantially,<br />
the next phase in investment, I think, will go into<br />
income producing businesses and into plant and<br />
equipment to add to Capacity.<br />
So, I think there's a lot of capacity there<br />
underutilised that will go up to, always it goes up<br />
to the full hundred per Cent when demand starts to<br />
really pick up in a consolidated way and a sustained<br />
way, and I think then people will see the profit<br />
potential of putting in more capacity and growing<br />
more quickly. Notq you may always have this problem<br />
of capital goods And capital imports, a surge of<br />
capital imports to accommodate more capacity, in the </p>
<p>and that's of course what we must do, And I Gont<br />
think that'sa ever been a problem carrying capital<br />
goods on the current account providing you're going<br />
to get a return on them down the track.<br />
The only way out of Australia'I5 long term Current<br />
account and indebtedness problems in with<br />
production, and~ pouction is only going to come<br />
from investment and t nly thing therefore to do<br />
is go for it. Get all the conditions Into place to,<br />
and they are coming into place now, as I say low<br />
inflation, low interest rates, a competitive tax<br />
system, big depreciation rates, 150 per cent for<br />
R D for instance which we've just reaffirsed, a<br />
pool of savings through occupational superannuation,<br />
there's a tremendous stack of good points for<br />
Australian investment in the 19909, and they're in<br />
the end all the things which are basically going to<br />
deal with our production problems and imports. And<br />
it's more the pity that we had to end up with a<br />
stock of debt to learn the lesson that you can't<br />
simply do the unclever thing, and let the creativity<br />
of your people fall by the wayside and not invest in<br />
income producing things, things which add value,<br />
believing that only the primary export sector was<br />
our salvation. We've paid a very high price for<br />
that mistaken belief, and with the price paid and<br />
the lesson learned, I think we can now look forward<br />
to much higher levels of production and in the end,<br />
of course, dealing with the current account deficit<br />
at source.<br />
