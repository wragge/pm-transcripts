PRMEMIIL E<br />
SPEECH PREPARED FOR THE PRIME MINISTER, MR BOB HAWKE,<br />
TO WELCOME DELEGATES TO THE " ALL TOGETHER AUSTRALIAN"<br />
PROMOTION TEXTILE COUNCIL OF AUSTRALIA 25 AUGUST, CANBERRA<br />
Friends, It was with pleasure that I accepted your<br />
invitation to open the " All Together Australian" Promotion.<br />
Following on the success of similar campaigns in<br />
the past this promotion is both timely and needed. As an<br />
example of an industry in this case the textile industrygetting<br />
out and vigorously promoting an Australian product<br />
it must be applauded.<br />
This self-help promotion is a demonstration of the<br />
spirit of enterprise which is essential to the future<br />
success of Australian industry. Ijam glad to say that<br />
spirit is becoming more evident throughout the country.<br />
Across an increasingly wide spectrum of business activities,<br />
there is growing evidence that empl1oyers and employees are<br />
accepting and confronting ' the econgmic reality that<br />
currently faces them. They are addressing this with a view<br />
to taking fullest advantage of the expected recovery in<br />
economic activity. They are developing, both in<br />
co-operation with each other, and,. with the Government, a<br />
range of constructive and Positive plans for the future.<br />
Initiatives are now being" taken where in the past reactive<br />
and defensive postures had been the norm. I welcome these<br />
developments. </p>
<p>2.<br />
Innovation and adaptability are essential<br />
ingredients of business survival and of business success.<br />
They will be encouraged and fostered by the Government in<br />
such ways as are available to it.<br />
It is crucial that Australians understand the<br />
rapidly and dramatically changing world within which they<br />
live. The lotus years are over. No longer can Australians<br />
assume that full employment and increasing real wages for a<br />
rapidly growing population are endemic to our system. If we<br />
are to harness our resources and optomise growth, employment<br />
and the opportunities for personal fulfillment, our<br />
Governments have to plan for it and people have to work for<br />
it.% This was the point of the National Economic Summit<br />
Conference. It is most satisfying to see that the spirit of<br />
national reconciliation which was engendered there has had a<br />
constructive practical impact on mA~ y areas of the<br />
Australian industrial scene.<br />
Summit members in Iicated 6heir support for " the<br />
introduction of an active industrial development policy".<br />
Such a policy should lead to increqsed employment, greater<br />
job security, and improved industrial efficiency,<br />
competitiveness and profitability. </p>
<p>Achievement of these goals presumes consultation,<br />
consensus and commitment the guiding principles motivating<br />
the approach of the Economic Summit participants. These<br />
three C's all characterise the " All Together Australian"<br />
Promotion. If Australian manufacturing industry is to take<br />
fullest advantage of the economic benefits flowing from the<br />
expected recovery in economic activity, a further<br />
requirement, that of consumer confidence can be added to<br />
them. Only if this exists will consumers look for<br />
particular products and keep returning to them.<br />
Other campaigns have aimed at stimulating consumer<br />
demand for high quality products made in Australia, by<br />
Australians and for Australians.<br />
Those campaigns were very effective indeed. A 1983<br />
survey conducted by Morgan ResearchICentre Pty Ltd., found,<br />
for example, that awareness of one recent campaign was as<br />
high as 89% and acceptance levels were<br />
This " All Together Australian" campaign is in some<br />
ways complementary to the earlier campaigns. It should<br />
benefit from and build upon the larger community awareness<br />
engendered by them. </p>
<p>This Government is well aware of the importance to<br />
Australia of the textile industry and of the problems<br />
encountered in recent years. As a substantial employer of<br />
Australian workers, particularly women and migrant workers<br />
in non-metropolitan areas, the industry makes an especially<br />
significant contribution to our community.<br />
At the same time we are concerned that problems of<br />
competitiveness associated with changing world economic<br />
circumstances should be recognised. Such problems should be<br />
dealt with in ways most conducive to the long-term viability<br />
of industry and to the welfare of its workers and all<br />
Australians. Competitiveness in this sense cannot<br />
satisfactorily be restored by feather-bedding of inefficient<br />
or outdated processes or by a regressive drop in working<br />
conditions. What industry can legitimately expect, and my<br />
Government is working to provide, is a stable and<br />
predictable set of policies. The security of investments<br />
made must be protected; the resprt to ad hoc measures which<br />
so characterised policy in the past must be put aside. In<br />
line with this my Government intends to retain the current<br />
long-term assistance program for the Australian textile<br />
industry. P., </p>
<p>The severity of the recession has brought in its<br />
train strong pressures for increased industry protection.<br />
In circumstances of high unemployment such pressures are<br />
understandable, but we do not think that any good purpose<br />
would be served by changing established medium-term programs<br />
to provide more protection.<br />
For one thing, the problems faced by industries<br />
have many causes, and greater protection from import<br />
competition would do little to address more fundamental,<br />
long-term problems.<br />
The textile industry's ability to cope with<br />
competitive pressures should be enhanced, inter alia, by the<br />
Promotion we are launching today.<br />
Recognition of the need to provide a framework for<br />
strong economic recovery has underpinned the Government's<br />
approach to the 1983 Budget. With this Budget we are<br />
confident the Australian economy will achieve the type<br />
of broadly based recovery which wi Y lead to the<br />
strengthened consumer demand whichabove all else is crucial<br />
to the economic stability of industory. We expect this<br />
without risking the dangers of reviving the inflationary<br />
spiral. </p>
<p>We can now point with some confidence to signs of<br />
economic recovery for this country. Production and labour<br />
market statistics are showing an improvement. Our Budget<br />
will foster this incipient recovery and turn it into a<br />
long-term trend, beneficial to all Australians.<br />
In this process campaigns such as the " All Together<br />
Australian" Promotion can and will have a valuable role.<br />
Importantly they reflect determination to put " enterprise"<br />
back into private enterprise.<br />
I extend to you all my best wishes for the<br />
Promotion's success. </p>
