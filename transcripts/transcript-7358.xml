FOR MEDIA 18 JULY 1988<br />
JOINT STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, MR HAWKE, THE PRIME<br />
MINISTER OF NEW ZEALAND, MR LANGE AND THE PRIME MINISTER OF<br />
IRELAND, MR HAUGHEY.<br />
" Nelson Mandela celebrates his 70th birthday. Although he<br />
has been held in a South African jail for 25 years Nelson<br />
Mandela remains a potent symbol of freedom for all those<br />
living under the vicious regime of apartheid."<br />
These are the comments made by the Prime minister of New<br />
Zealand, Rt Hon. David Lange, the Prime Minister of Ireland,<br />
Mr Charles T. Haughey, and the Prime Minister of Australia,<br />
Hon. R. J. L. Hawke, in a joint statement issued today at the<br />
conclusion of Mr Haughey's visit to Australia and New<br />
Zealand. The Prime Ministers went on to say that Nelson Mandela has<br />
dedicated himself to the struggle against apartheid on<br />
behalf of all African people. " He has fought against white<br />
domination and he has fought against black domination", they<br />
said. " His ideals are those of a democratic and free<br />
society in which all races live together with equal<br />
opportunities" " We call on South Africa to release Nelson Mandela without<br />
condition and to remove the ban on the African National<br />
Congress", said the Prime Ministers. " This would act as a<br />
clear signal to those who respect freedom and the democratic<br />
process that the South African Government is genuine in its<br />
desire to take part in a peacefully negotiated settlement."<br />
" There must be a dawning of sanity in Pretoria if the worst<br />
is not to happen", the Prime Ministers concluded. 393 </p>
