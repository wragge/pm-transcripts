FOR MEDIA TUESDAY, 13 JANUARY, 1981<br />
RETIREMENT OF THE CHIEF JUSTICE<br />
I have today informed the Cabinet of Sir Garfield Barwick's<br />
intention to resign from the Office of Chief Justice of<br />
Australia on and from 11 February, 1981.<br />
Sir Garfield has given great service to Australia in the<br />
highest judicial office. Appointed as Chief Justice on<br />
1 May 1964, he has served longer than any of his<br />
predecessors. He has filled the Office with distinction,<br />
capping his earlier career at the Bar as a Minister of the<br />
Crown and in other areas of public life.<br />
As Chief Justice, Sir Garfield has played a large part in<br />
the development of the law in Australia. He has guided and<br />
encouraged a number of developments enhancing the role and<br />
standing of the High Court. In h-is last year he presided<br />
over the Court's move to a permanent home in Canberra: the<br />
new High Court Building bears testimony to Sir Garfield's<br />
vision, energy and imagination.<br />
I have conveyed to Sir Garfield the Government's appreciation<br />
of his service as Chief Justice and on behalf of the Australian<br />
people have wished him well in his intended retirement.<br />
In accordance with legislation the Attorney-General will<br />
be consulting with State Attorneys-General in relation to<br />
the appointment of a new Chief Justice to succeed Sir Garfield..<br />
