    <content><![CDATA[<p>Subjects: Drugs</p>
<p>E&amp;OE.................</p>
<p>Thank you very much for those very kind words of welcome, and I particularly</p>
<p> acknowledge the presence here today of Brian Watters and David Crosby.</p>
<p>  And can I especially thank the mission and the residents, and the</p>
<p> other people who are supported by and use this facility, for the opportunity</p>
<p> of being your guest today.</p>
<p>I want to say a few very brief words about the important work that</p>
<p> organisations such as the Adelaide Central Mission undertake, and</p>
<p> of course to announce in a formal sense, although the funding was</p>
<p> announced a few weeks ago by my colleague Dr Wooldridge, a further</p>
<p> contribution of over a quarter-of-a-million dollars to the mission</p>
<p> which will enable the employment of an additional counsellor to provide</p>
<p> further work to assist the people who continue to need the assistance</p>
<p> of this, and like facilities not only in Adelaide but all around Australia.</p>
<p>This announcement is part of an overall strategy of the Federal government</p>
<p> trying to provide extra help to the many people in the community who</p>
<p> are working so hard to attack the problem of illicit drugs.</p>
<p>  And I want to say at the outset ladies and gentlemen, that nobody,</p>
<p> not least the Prime Minister of Australia, pretends that there is</p>
<p> one simple easy solution to the challenge of illicit drugs.</p>
<p>  It's been a challenge that has been with us for a long time.</p>
<p>  It's a challenge of which the community is perhaps more deeply aware</p>
<p> now than it has been for a very long period of time. And it's a challenge</p>
<p> for which there is no one simple single easy solution.</p>
<p>It needs to attacked in my view in three ways.  We need to provide</p>
<p> additional resources and additional energy in educating people against</p>
<p> the dangers of commencing illicit drug use.  We need to provide</p>
<p> additional resources to the law enforcement authorities who seek out</p>
<p> those who would profit at the expense of human misery of others.</p>
<p>  And indeed we need to work hard against the abuse of alcohol within</p>
<p> our community, as indeed we need to work hard against the abuse of</p>
<p> gambling within our community.  And I have certainly as Prime</p>
<p> Minister have spoken often of the need to fight against the abuse</p>
<p> of gambling within our community. And finally, as part of the three</p>
<p> pronged approach if I can put it that way, we need to put additional</p>
<p> resources into providing treatment facilities for people who have</p>
<p> an addiction problem.  And this is a good meeting.  Reminds</p>
<p> me of some of the older political meetings I used to go to and I'm</p>
<p> enjoying it immensely.</p>
<p>You need extra resources to go into treatment facilities and that</p>
<p> has been an area that I think has been neglected in the Australian</p>
<p> community, and I don't seek to blame any one section of the community</p>
<p> for that but rather I seek to acknowledge, and I think in common with</p>
<p> others that have been involved in the area, I believe that new and</p>
<p> additional resources ought to be provided.  And I'm very pleased</p>
<p> to say that over the last two years my Government has committed more</p>
<p> than $500 million over a period of four years to the war against drugs.</p>
<p>  Not only in relation to education, but also in relation to policing</p>
<p> and in relation to treatment facilities.</p>
<p>But ladies and gentlemen, facilities such as Byron House provided</p>
<p> by the Adelaide Central Mission, facilities such as Byron House provide</p>
<p> a vital support capacity to those in our community who need help,</p>
<p> and who need assistance: people who have a problem with alcohol addiction,</p>
<p> people who have a problem with other forms of drug addiction, people</p>
<p> who are suffering the impact of homelessness.  And I want to</p>
<p> pay a special tribute to the work of organisations such as the Adelaide</p>
<p> Central Mission.  I have long admired the contribution of our</p>
<p> great welfare organisations, the city missions, the St Vincent de</p>
<p> Paul, the Salvation Army, and all the other great organisations that</p>
<p> provide in a very selfless way, the necessity to assist the people</p>
<p> of Australia who need assistance and who are suffering particular</p>
<p> problems of addiction and a particular problem of personal and family</p>
<p> distress.</p>
<p>So I am here today to principally applaud the work of the Adelaide</p>
<p> Central Mission, to remind those who work in facilities such as this</p>
<p> just how valuable their work is.  We do need a social coalition</p>
<p> in the Australian community to deal with this challenge.  The</p>
<p> government can't do it on its own.  The welfare organisations</p>
<p> can't do it on their own.  The families of people who have a</p>
<p> drug problem can't do it on their own. What is needed is a coalition</p>
<p> between all of those.  And rather than at a political level there</p>
<p> be a preoccupation with some of the differences that might exist between</p>
<p> different governments about how you approach this problem, what we</p>
<p> need to do within our community is to focus on those views that we</p>
<p> have in common, to focus on the common commitment of Federal and State</p>
<p> governments across the political divide to trying to make a difference.</p>
<p>Now, nobody has, as I said at the beginning of my remarks, nobody</p>
<p> has all of the answers.  I don't seek to make a political issue</p>
<p> of the campaign against drugs.  I am as prepared to work with</p>
<p> a Labor Premier of New South Wales and a Labor Premier of Queensland,</p>
<p> as I am to work with the Liberal Premiers of Victoria and South Australia.</p>
<p>  This is an issue which is above and beyond party politics.  And</p>
<p> I was reminded the other day that in the first speech that I made</p>
<p> to the Federal Parliament as Leader of the Liberal Party, I argued</p>
<p> that fighting drugs should be something that transcended the political</p>
<p> divide within the Australian community.  And I'm very pleased</p>
<p> that many of the initiatives I've launched, and many of the views</p>
<p> that I've expressed on these issues are very directly echoed and supported</p>
<p> by both Mr Carr, the Premier of New South Wales, and Mr Beattie the</p>
<p> Premier of Queensland, and indeed in many respects, by the Leader</p>
<p> of the Opposition Mr Beazley.</p>
<p>But ladies and gentlemen, I'm very pleased indeed to launch the particular</p>
<p> programme which will provide additional counselling facilities, to</p>
<p> help people with a drug and alcohol problem.  I congratulate</p>
<p> the mission.  It's a magnificent example of the sort of organisation</p>
<p> that ought to be supported by the 'Tough on Drugs' strategy, and it</p>
<p> is a living proof of the need for that social coalition between the</p>
<p> Federal government, the State governments, the business community,</p>
<p> the welfare sector, and families who are concerned to help their members</p>
<p> and indeed to help their friends who are suffering from the scourge</p>
<p> of drug addiction.  I thank the mission for having me here today</p>
<p> and I congratulate it most warmly and most generously on the humanitarian</p>
<p> work that it is undertaking.</p>
