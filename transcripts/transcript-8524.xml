PRIME MINISTER<br />
ADDRESS BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P. 3. KEATING, MP<br />
BREAKFAST FOR SYDNEY OLYMPICS, SYDNEY, 29 MAY 1992<br />
Premier Greiner and Mrs Greiner, Distinguished guests,<br />
Ladies and gentlemen<br />
Thank you for the invitation to speak to you this<br />
morning. A couple of weeks ago ! addressed a huge number of people<br />
gathered at the Meicourne Tennis Centre to raise money<br />
for theAustralian X-' ympic Team bound for Barcelona.<br />
If their support tcr th~ e cause is any measure, Sydney's<br />
-bJi. for the Olympics. in the year 2000 will ride a huge<br />
wave. I have to say in passing that it was a great pity that<br />
Melbourne's quite superb _ bid for the 96 Olympics was<br />
Ariusucessful the people associated w ith that effort and<br />
the people of Melbourne deserved much better.<br />
But I have no doubt that all those who put their energy<br />
into that effort will now put their energy into Sydney.<br />
Just as Melbourne's was, this is a nat~ ional. bid an<br />
Australian bid.<br />
It requires a national effort.<br />
In many ways Melbourne's bid provided a solid foundation<br />
for the Sydney bid.<br />
Many of the strengths of the argument for Melbourne can<br />
be translated to Sydney.<br />
Their bid made the point that it would be only the second<br />
time in the history of the modern Olympics that the Games<br />
have been held in the Southern Hemisphere.<br />
The point was made so well by Melbourne it need not be<br />
emphasised by the Sydney Committee.<br />
Sydney can concentrate on the other compelling reasons<br />
why the Games should come south. 7 2 </p>
