<p>GRIMSHAW:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, good morning</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Good morning.</p>
<p>GRIMSHAW:</p>
<p>You're a week and a day off handing down a budget that will presumably</p>
<p> be predicated, at least in part, on a GST that the Senate isn't</p>
<p> showing any signs, at this stage, of passing. Are you going to have</p>
<p> to bend on compensation?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, every budget is predicated on the Parliament passing the legislation</p>
<p> to give effect to the budget measures. So it's no different in</p>
<p> that sense from any other budget. Tracey, everyone knows the position</p>
<p> with the Senate. We don't have the numbers. We fought an election</p>
<p> on major tax reform, not because it was good for this or that section</p>
<p> of the community but because it was good for the whole country. I</p>
<p> mean, we put that plan up because we believed it was good for Australia's</p>
<p> long-term future. Now, that's far more important than its impact</p>
<p> on this or that section of the community. In the long run, if we don't</p>
<p> have tax reform of this nature, we'll be a weaker, poorer, less</p>
<p> competitive country into the next century. It's that important.</p>
<p> And that's why we poured so much political effort into it and</p>
<p> that's why we took such a tremendous risk in the national interest.</p>
<p> And that is really what I want the Australian people to focus on,</p>
<p> that this is about securing the economic future of Australia. It's</p>
<p> not just about how it affects this or that section of the community.</p>
<p> We've lost sight of the national interest objective over recent</p>
<p> months. And that's not surprising but in the long run I believe</p>
<p> Australians will rally behind a reform that they know is good for</p>
<p> the long-term benefit of their country.</p>
<p>GRIMSHAW:</p>
<p>Well, I suppose it could argued as since Australians did rally behind</p>
<p> it, you won an election in which it was a key issue, but the Senate</p>
<p> is not rallying behind it and Senator Harradine said as recently as</p>
<p> Friday that the package remains structurally unfair. You need his</p>
<p> support, don't you?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, it is true, as you say, that the public voted for it. And I</p>
<p> would like every member of the Senate to remember that. I mean, we</p>
<p> fought an election on this. We didn't hold back any detail. We</p>
<p> didn't fudge it. We didn't say one thing and do another.</p>
<p> We've done exactly what we said in the election campaign we would</p>
<p> do. I rejected all the conventional political advice in going to an</p>
<p> election campaign proposing what some people said was a new tax. It</p>
<p> was not a new tax. It was an entirely new tax system. And in those</p>
<p> circumstances we'd actually believed that the Labor Party and</p>
<p> the Democrats, indeed, everybody in the Senate should listen to what</p>
<p> the public said. It's not just Brian Harradine. I mean, Brian</p>
<p> Harradine would not have all this focus on him if the Democrats and</p>
<p> the Labor Party had accepted the verdict of the people, would he?</p>
<p>GRIMSHAW:</p>
<p>And yet he does have this focus on him and he has said to you, he</p>
<p> has challenged you, to say publicly what you will do to rectify what</p>
<p> he describes as the structural unfairness in the system.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, everyone knows that we want to get it through. And obviously</p>
<p> there have been and there will continue to be discussions between</p>
<p> the Government and anybody in the Senate that shows a willingness</p>
<p> to consider the Government's position. Now, I'm not going</p>
<p> to go into the details of what may or may not be said and how it will</p>
<p> be said to Brian Harradine or to Mal Colston or, indeed, to anybody</p>
<p> else. But suffice it to say we want to implement the plan because</p>
<p> it's good for Australia's economic future. We're prepared</p>
<p> to, as I've said repeatedly, do a bit of fine-tuning but we're</p>
<p> not going to pull it apart the way that the Democrats, at the moment,</p>
<p> are suggesting we do. Because once you pull an important element out</p>
<p> of it you undermine the whole infrastructure, the whole architecture,</p>
<p> of the package.</p>
<p>GRIMSHAW:</p>
<p>Will fine-tuning perhaps been eating into the budget surplus to provide</p>
<p> a greater pillowing effect, if you like, cushioning effect?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well look, it's a fair question of you to ask and anybody in</p>
<p> your position would naturally ask that but I'm just not going</p>
<p> to get into that except to say that self-evidently, we are talking</p>
<p> and we'll continue to talk to the various players in the Senate.</p>
<p> I mean, self evidently that is the case but I'm not going to</p>
<p> sort of speculate, except to say that it's an integrated plan</p>
<p> and we're not, for example, going to exempt food, that's</p>
<p> out. You can't have business tax reform without general tax reform.</p>
<p> I was glad yesterday that Mr Beazley said he supported capital gains</p>
<p> tax reform. Well, I'd say to him, you can't have capital</p>
<p> gains tax reform without all the other reforms. You can't just</p>
<p> pull one bit out and say, we'll have that but we'll reject</p>
<p> everything else. I mean, life's not as simple as that. And the</p>
<p> whole thing is an integrated package. And that's its virtue.</p>
<p> I mean, it's easy to sort of do a little bit here and there.</p>
<p> Governments have been doing that to our tax system for years, that's</p>
<p> why it's such a mess. This is the first serious attempt to renovate</p>
<p> the whole system and it would be tragic, economically, for Australia</p>
<p> if it fell over, particularly after we won an election on it.</p>
<p>GRIMSHAW:</p>
<p>Senator Colston has accused Labor of trying to hasten his death. Do</p>
<p> you believe that they are dragging out the debate awaiting that eventuality?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, they're certainly dragging out the debate and I think the</p>
<p> attacks on him are appalling. I have never heard such language used</p>
<p> about anybody. I mean, it is just beyond reason. The man has cancer.</p>
<p> That is unarguable. The evidence has been given. Are people seriously</p>
<p> saying he hasn't? I mean, it doesn't matter what he's</p>
<p> done in terms of his rows with the Australian Labor Party. And there</p>
<p> does come a point where they ought to ease up and I just think the</p>
<p> attacks that have been made on him are just appalling.</p>
<p>GRIMSHAW:</p>
<p>If the GST fails is it back to the drawing board for the budget?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>The budget is unaffected. As I said before, there's nothing unusual</p>
<p> about a budget being based upon the assumption that the Parliament</p>
<p> will pass legislation giving effect to budget measures. So in that</p>
<p> sense there's no particular significance in that.</p>
<p>GRIMSHAW:</p>
<p>Mr Beazley suggested yesterday that if there's no GST and the</p>
<p> budget takes into account GST significantly then the budget will be</p>
<p> wrecked?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, he wants to wreck it. He wants to wreck the tax plan. I mean,</p>
<p> just remember the Labor Party has embarked upon a political exercise</p>
<p> of stopping tax reform in the hope that will damage the Government's</p>
<p> credibility. They're not really paying much regard to whether</p>
<p> tax reform is good or bad for Australia. They don't really care</p>
<p> about that. They just want to score a political hit on the Government.</p>
<p> Now, that's fine I guess, if you want to be a negative Opposition</p>
<p> but I think the public wants a bit more than that. Doesn't the</p>
<p> public really want to know what is good for Australia? And we put</p>
<p> forward a plan that we thought was good for Australia and we won the</p>
<p> election. They agreed with us. And what we're really saying is...</p>
<p>GRIMSHAW:</p>
<p>But you haven't won the Senate.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, but in the long run...</p>
<p>GRIMSHAW:</p>
<p>You've got to win the Senate, haven't you?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>...what's more important, I mean, the will of the Â I</p>
<p> mean, how do you run a country? How do you run a parliamentary democracy</p>
<p> if the results of elections squarely fought openly and candidly on</p>
<p> an issue are not listened to?</p>
<p>GRIMSHAW:</p>
<p>Now, we're looking for some budget leaks here.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I'm the wrong bloke.</p>
<p>GRIMSHAW:</p>
<p>Some exclusive information, we are told that high tech medical research</p>
<p> and women returning to the work force will be among the big winners</p>
<p> in the budget. Can you confirm that?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well there's a lot of rumours. Look I neither confirm nor deny</p>
<p> rumours. But I can remind you that in relation to giving encouragement</p>
<p> to women to return to the workforce after they've been out for</p>
<p> a couple of years having children we made some policy commitments</p>
<p> on that in the election campaign so there's nothing new about</p>
<p> that.</p>
<p>GRIMSHAW:</p>
<p>So pretty safe to assume that the budget...?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I'm not confirming or denying anything in the budget.</p>
<p>GRIMSHAW:</p>
<p>What sort of incentives could you give women who've been out...?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well one of the things that we want to do, we had in mind at the election</p>
<p> campaign, was to improve their skills in areas where there may have</p>
<p> been technological changes and advances while they've been out</p>
<p> of the workforce. Our whole policy in this area is to give women the</p>
<p> maximum amount of choice. If they want to stay out of the workforce</p>
<p> for a few years when their children are young, indeed indefinitely,</p>
<p> if that's there choice well they should be helped and encouraged</p>
<p> to do so. If on the other hand they only want to do it for a couple</p>
<p> of years, which many women wish to do. They like to stay out for a</p>
<p> while and then go back, they don't want to lose their skills,</p>
<p> they don't want to fall behind. And what we had in mind at the</p>
<p> election campaign was to try and give them a bit of help.</p>
<p>GRIMSHAW:</p>
<p>Okay. I want to get on a few issues during this segment. Health fund</p>
<p> premiums. We are told they are about to rise. Given that you have</p>
<p> just given us all a 30% rebate for being in private health insurance,</p>
<p> that must dismay you that news?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I've never given a guarantee that there'd be never</p>
<p> ever be any rises in premiums in the future. There's certainly</p>
<p> was an arrangement worked out with the Government where the rises</p>
<p> were to be less frequent. And there's no doubt the 30% rebate</p>
<p> will take pressure off the funds to lift their premiums. They're</p>
<p> still suffering from the enormous exit of people over the last couple</p>
<p> of years. The other point I'd make is that the 30% rebate is</p>
<p> a rebate on the increased premium if there is an increase. So it's</p>
<p> not a fixed amount. So if your premium goes up by Âx' dollars</p>
<p> you get 30% of that back.</p>
<p>GRIMSHAW:</p>
<p>And yet we were told that the rebate would bring more people into</p>
<p> the system and therefore make it cheaper overall. Now suddenly within</p>
<p> a short space of time of getting this rebate premiums are about to</p>
<p> go up.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I don't know the extent of increases but, as I say, I've</p>
<p> never said increases would never occur.</p>
<p>GRIMSHAW:</p>
<p>Six per cent.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well that's been kicked around but nobody can guarantee that</p>
<p> there'll never be increases in anything. I mean that's ridiculous.</p>
<p> But the 30% rebate has made it cheaper. Health insurance premiums</p>
<p> will always be cheaper, by 30% cheaper as a result of the rebate.</p>
<p> And the signs are, although we haven't got the official figures,</p>
<p> the signs are that there has been a big increase in the number of</p>
<p> people going back into private health insurance. Now....</p>
<p>GRIMSHAW:</p>
<p>Might that drop of premiums go up?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Tracey, I don't know. I mean we don't control these things.</p>
<p> In the end they are controlled by the individual market choices of</p>
<p> people.</p>
<p>GRIMSHAW:</p>
<p>All right. While we're on matters of health we were told that</p>
<p> church groups in Sydney, one in particular, is planning to open a</p>
<p> heroin shooting parlour, in contravention of the law, in contravention</p>
<p> of your personal principles. How do you feel about that?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I'm against heroin shooting galleries. I don't think</p>
<p> there's any evidence that they're of benefit. I think they</p>
<p> send a bad signal. They involve potentially a breach of State law.</p>
<p> The New South Wales Premier for example, who's got responsibility</p>
<p> in Sydney. He's against it. He has the same view as I do on this</p>
<p> issue.</p>
<p>GRIMSHAW:</p>
<p>And yet it seems to be, these sorts of ideas seem to be gathering</p>
<p> momentum.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well they get a lot of publicity because they have a news value as</p>
<p> distinct from the health value. I mean, it's terribly easy to</p>
<p> get publicity on the drug issue by sort of thumbing your nose at the</p>
<p> law and some say, oh look I'm in favour of the heroin trial,</p>
<p> I'm in favour of the shooting gallery. It's terribly easy</p>
<p> to get publicity doing that. The long term valuable work that is being</p>
<p> done is the extra money that's going in to helping people break</p>
<p> the habit. I mean I've talked to people who are involved and</p>
<p> as recently as last Thursday I sat down and talked to some young people</p>
<p> at the Central Mission in Adelaide. And the message I got from them</p>
<p> was that the biggest single need was to have rehabilitation and treatment</p>
<p> facilities available for somebody when that person decided that it</p>
<p> was time for him to break the habit. And the absence of that, rather</p>
<p> than other things, was what was uppermost on the minds of these people</p>
<p> who had been grappling with a heroin addiction for years.</p>
<p>GRIMSHAW:</p>
<p>All right. Let's look internationally and as closely as East</p>
<p> Timor. You had a very successful meeting with Indonesia's President</p>
<p> Habibie last week. But the actions of the militia in the wake of that</p>
<p> meeting must worry you. I mean how easy is it, well not even easy,</p>
<p> how possible is it going to be to have a fair and safe vote on independence</p>
<p> for East Timor?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Tracey, it's not easy. It's better now than it was a few</p>
<p> weeks ago because there's a far stronger, or prominent public</p>
<p> commitment from the Indonesians for an open ballot.</p>
<p>GRIMSHAW:</p>
<p>Not from the militia groups though.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, but Tracey, you have to deal with the possible here. The asset</p>
<p> Australia has to use in Indonesia and Timor is influence. If people</p>
<p> are running around saying you should do this, you should do that,</p>
<p> what are they saying we should do? Invade the place? I mean, that's</p>
<p> ridiculous. If we walk away and wash our hands of it, that's</p>
<p> not going to influence the Indonesians to behave in a different way.</p>
<p> It's more likely to thrust them in on themselves and encourage</p>
<p> them to give up any responsibility for East Timor in saying, well,</p>
<p> if the world is unfair to us then we'll turn our backs on it.</p>
<p> What we have to do is steadily and sensibly and strategically use</p>
<p> our influence and that's what we've done. Now I can't</p>
<p> guarantee there'll be no more violence. Of course I can't,</p>
<p> because I don't control East Timor. East Timor is part of Indonesia</p>
<p> whether we like it or not. We have to deal with that reality and respect</p>
<p> it, and I think we've come a long way in the fact that the Indonesians</p>
<p> are now publicly committed through the UN will put a lot more pressure</p>
<p> on them.</p>
<p>GRIMSHAW:</p>
<p> Sadly we're running out of time, but I want to ask you about</p>
<p> diplomatic efforts to release the two Australian aid workers in Kosovo.</p>
<p> Are you encouraged by the release of the US troops?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I'm delighted for their sake, and for the sakes of their</p>
<p> families that they're out. And I congratulate Jesse Jackson and</p>
<p> all of those involved in it. Naturally I hope that the same thing</p>
<p> can happen for Pratt and Wallace. I mean it's....</p>
<p>GRIMSHAW:</p>
<p>Do you step up the diplomatic efforts?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well we've never relaxed on that but you will understand it's</p>
<p> one of those situations where sometimes the less said the better.</p>
<p> We're trying everything we can at a diplomatic level. Malcolm</p>
<p> Fraser has done a great job as the Chairman of CARE in going there</p>
<p> and talking to the Yugoslav government. I thank him for that and I</p>
<p> know how concerned he and other members of CARE are. We have worked</p>
<p> very hard at a diplomatic level. We'll go on doing so, we'll</p>
<p> go on arguing that these men are not combatants. They're humanitarian</p>
<p> people who've helped serve refugees as much as they've helped</p>
<p> refugees in other parts of the country and I hope in the end that</p>
<p> that will be realised.</p>
<p>GRIMSHAW:</p>
<p>We'll leave it there. Thanks for your time.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Pleasure.</p>
