<p>E&amp;OE.............</p>
<p>  PHAN:</p>
<p>  To kick-off a series of interviews with newsmakers in Australia we have</p>
<p>   in our first programme Prime Minister John Howard. In an interview recorded</p>
<p>   earlier I started by asking the Prime Minister for his reaction to the trade</p>
<p>   deficit.</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  The size of a trade deficit is relative and if the trade deficit goes up</p>
<p>   somewhat but is accompanied by other economic fundamentals that are very</p>
<p>   strong then it is eminently manageable. And when you look at the other fundamentals</p>
<p>   of the Australian economy, inflation, budget surplus, growth, investment,</p>
<p>   all of those things are very strong, therefore, it's quite possible to,</p>
<p>   for a period, accommodate current account or trade deficit that is a little</p>
<p>   higher than the long-term trend.</p>
<p>  PHAN:</p>
<p>  Australian consumers, Prime Minister, seem to be consuming at a hefty pace.</p>
<p>   We've seen imports in Australia or for the month of September rise some</p>
<p>   seven percent, exports are of course following. Is there any fear that inflation</p>
<p>   really will be kicking in and on top of that there's the GST that could</p>
<p>   be adding inflationary pressure?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well, the inflationary pressures are still quite low in the Australian economy.</p>
<p>   For example, we had a wages growth figure a few days ago that was below</p>
<p>   expectations. And given that wages have in the past been a main driver of</p>
<p>   higher inflation that's encouraging. Our consumer price index for the September</p>
<p>   quarter was a little higher than normal but that was due entirely to a spike</p>
<p>   in the price of fuel because of the increase in the world price of crude</p>
<p>   oil. That is now subsiding, therefore, there is no reason why our inflation</p>
<p>   rate ought not to return to a more normal level for the last few years and,</p>
<p>   of course, that has meant that we've had the lowest inflation rate for more</p>
<p>   than 30 years.</p>
<p>  PHAN:</p>
<p>  The Reserve Bank Governor, Ian Macfarlane, has talked about possible necessity</p>
<p>   to take pre-emptive steps in terms of monetary policy. If he does raise</p>
<p>   rates by between 25 to 50 basis points, what's your reaction?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well, I never speculate about the future path of interest rates. That's</p>
<p>   my reaction.</p>
<p>  PHAN:</p>
<p>  Prime Minister, let's talk now about the referendum that's going to happen</p>
<p>   this weekend on whether or not Australia should become a republic. It seems</p>
<p>   that some polls show that two-thirds of Australian voters actually support</p>
<p>   a republic in Australia, however, the referendum may fail because they don't</p>
<p>   agree with the type of republic that's being offered to them because they</p>
<p>   really want to elect their own President. Why are Australians not being</p>
<p>   offered that option, what they want, which is to be able to elect their</p>
<p>   own President?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well, Australians are being offered what the Government promised that they</p>
<p>   would be offered and that is the republican model that gathered clear support</p>
<p>   out of a constitutional convention that was held at the beginning of last</p>
<p>   year. That was the promise that the Government made and that promise is</p>
<p>   being delivered in full. I don't know what the result is going to be and</p>
<p>   I'll wait and see. I'll cast my vote. I'm advocating a no vote because I</p>
<p>   don't believe in disturbing a very stable constitution which has made Australia</p>
<p>   a sea of stability.</p>
<p>  PHAN:</p>
<p>  Kim Beazley of the Opposition has said that if the Opposition ever won power</p>
<p>   they would offer this option to the Australian people to be able to elect</p>
<p>   their own President. Why wouldn't you consider offering Australians this</p>
<p>   option?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well, I believe that if the yes vote wins on Saturday there will never be</p>
<p>   another referendum with the option of a direct election because most of</p>
<p>   the people in both the Government and Opposition parties believe that a</p>
<p>   directly elected President would basically change our system and that it's</p>
<p>   not an option they would support. So despite what he is saying I don't for</p>
<p>   a moment believe that that is going to happen. But can I say this to your</p>
<p>   listeners that this is a matter for Australians to decide and whatever the</p>
<p>   outcome is I will accept it. And I don't think Australia will play a stronger</p>
<p>   or more effective role in the region as a republic. We already play a very</p>
<p>   strong role in the region with our present constitution and I'm quite certain</p>
<p>   that if we continue with it after Saturday we'll continue to be just as</p>
<p>   effective and strong and clear in the region as we are now.</p>
<p>  PHAN:</p>
<p>  And if, indeed, Australians vote for a republic Australia would you resign?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  You're kidding.</p>
<p>  PHAN:</p>
<p>  Well, you strongly disagree with the idea of a republic Australia, would</p>
<p>   you step down if Australians want a republic?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Of course not. I'm the person who's allowed the Australian people for the</p>
<p>   first time in 100 years to vote on this issue. I've given them the choice.</p>
<p>   I've always said that I will allow them to make a choice and I'm doing that.</p>
<p>   The idea of resignation would never enter my head. It's a perfectly astonishing</p>
<p>   proposition and you're the first interviewer ever to put it to me.</p>
<p>  PHAN:</p>
<p>  Let's move on to talk a little bit about foreign relations. The new President</p>
<p>   of Indonesia, President Gus Dur is embarking on a pan-Asian tour starting</p>
<p>   this weekend. He's planning to visit nine countries in about three days</p>
<p>   as I understand. He's planning to visit China and Japan. Conspicuously he's</p>
<p>   not visiting Australia. What is your reaction to that?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well, of course, that's not surprising to me because we have gone through</p>
<p>   a period of tension with Indonesia because of the role, the leadership role</p>
<p>   we took in East Timor. And it is to be expected that the relationship will</p>
<p>   go through a healing process because of that leadership role over the months</p>
<p>   ahead. I have no doubt that we'll re-establish a very good relationship</p>
<p>   with Indonesia but there has to be a period of healing. There has to be</p>
<p>   a period of drawing of breath, of an acknowledgement that we took strongly</p>
<p>   different views on East Timor.</p>
<p>  PHAN:</p>
<p>  Australian Prime Minister John Howard.</p>
