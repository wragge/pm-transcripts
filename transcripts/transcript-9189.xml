TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P. J. KEATING MP<br />
DOORSTOP, OMNI SAIGON HOTEL, HO CHI MINH CITY, 12 APRIL 1994<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
J: Prime Minister, Dr Hewson in Australia has said that it is another<br />
mistake in relation to the so-called apology, what would you say to Dr<br />
Hewson?<br />
PM: If there are any apologies to be made the Liberal party should make it<br />
to the 504 Australian families who lost sons in Vietnam in a war they<br />
should never have made a commitment to and I would -have thought<br />
the Liberal party would have been the last organisation in Australia to<br />
be talking about the war in Vietnam. I thought they would just go away<br />
and hide.<br />
J: Why is that?<br />
PM: Because of the unprincipled nature of their commitment. The same<br />
kind of reasons why they are making the same utterance today for<br />
unprincipled political reasons, domestic political reasons. That is why<br />
the commitment was made in tifirst place.<br />
J: By the same token wouldn't it make sense in terms of trying to achieve<br />
final reconciliation of opposing views in Australia which have been reopened<br />
by events of the past few days to make some kind of gesture<br />
on the ground here?<br />
PM: I made it at the appropriate place which was the one cemetery that I<br />
was able to visit in this area which was Kanchanaburi.<br />
J: But there is a memorial at Long Tan?<br />
PM: 1 have said enough about it and I don't want to go on about it. K2 </p>
<p>J: Can I ask you, In relation to the discussions you had with the<br />
Vietnamese President Le Duc Anh, what was the message you were<br />
seeking to get across in relation to about acknowledging the<br />
difficulties the Vietnamese face which is being interpreted in some<br />
areas as being some sort of apology for the war?<br />
PM: There was no apology. I notice the beat up by that in The Australian<br />
this morning, that was a complete fabrication without foundation. I<br />
sought here to establish further Australia economically and<br />
strategically with the two fastest growing countr! ies in the region<br />
Thailand and Vietnam I think, those interests have been advanced.<br />
The kind of relationship which I have been able to develop with<br />
Indonesia in the last few years, I think, I have seen more than the<br />
beginnings of In the relationship with Vietnam and with Thailand. That<br />
is, coming to understand better and, I think, in both these countries we<br />
found genuine enthusiasm for the role Australia has been playing in<br />
Asia. Whether it be APEC or Cambodia or the strategic dialogue or<br />
the post ASEAN Ministerial Forum the ASEAN strategic regional<br />
discussion of which we are full members and Vietnam is now a<br />
member that Australia's role in the region is very well appreciated.<br />
J: Can I clarify what you meant though when you said Australia had met<br />
its responsibility to Vietnam.<br />
PM: I'm not even sure the word ' responsibilities' was used. What I made<br />
clear was that Australia would do that which it could sensibly do to<br />
help build the Vietnamese economy and that is with the aid program, in<br />
education, in health, in writing bodies of commercial law which they<br />
don't have. All these things will be about the more rapid development<br />
of the Vietnamese economy.<br />
J: When the question of human rights came up with the Parliamentary<br />
delegation, how did the Vietnamese respond?<br />
PM: Prime Minister Kiet gave me a commitment in Canberra that there<br />
would be an exchange of delegations to look at the relationships<br />
between our two countries including human rights. He has honoured<br />
that commitment and the resultant consultative delegation, I think, will<br />
be very useful in establishing the relationships between our two<br />
countries in these areas. That is, in all areas including human rights.<br />
J: Would you be distressed if that delegation were not able to consider<br />
individual cases, merely to consult?<br />
PM: I am not here to be making judgements about something which might<br />
or might not happen in the future. The thing was they have recognised </p>
<p>3<br />
that was an issue between us and they have put an instrument in place<br />
to discuss it within. But again, I think, this relationship is going to be<br />
one of many struts, of many piers and they will include economic<br />
development, trade, investment, strategic interests and an interest in<br />
the development of the whole Asia Pacific area.<br />
J In terms of economic development of Vietnam, what was the main<br />
message that you wanted to get across to the Vietnamese in the way<br />
in which they went ahead into the future?<br />
PM: Just that they should think about the region in terms of structures, that<br />
Is, they should see where the developments are coming, what the<br />
strategic influences are going to be. They, I think, will be important on<br />
them, how the strategic and the commercial are intertwined, how they<br />
should try and set their economy up, what things they might do first,<br />
which things are best pursued by government, which things are best<br />
pursued by the private sector, these sorts of things.<br />
J: And in that transition from the command to a market economy which<br />
are things you think they ought to be doing that'-should be left to the<br />
private sector not the..<br />
PM: I think the Government should principally invest in human capital.<br />
They should invest in the creativity of their kids, through their<br />
education system because if they get those levels of education and<br />
creativity up they will find the opportunities and they will make the<br />
pace. I said to the Government, to Prime Minister Kiet, and I also<br />
made the same point in Laos that many things in the public<br />
infrastructure can be provided privately and there is not a real lot of<br />
point for a Government with scarce resources providing funds for<br />
things like telephones or certain reticular roads.<br />
J: ( inaudible)<br />
PM: I think so, because I think they understand that with scarce resources<br />
It is basically the investments ought best be made in the areas of<br />
social development, human development like education, like health.<br />
J: What point do you want to make to the Secretary-General this<br />
afternoon?<br />
PM: Where Australia stands, how we see the area basically better viewed<br />
as a Asia-Pacific rather than simply as Asia; that there is an important<br />
role for the United States in the area, particularly in relation to Japan<br />
bringing a high degree of strategic certainty and peace to the area, at<br />
any rate the trading links are trans-pacific and that they should be<br />
thinking in terms of arrangements which allow them to freely<br />
participate in multi-lateral trade, through the GAITT, but also things<br />
which build on the GATT that allows them a greater level of </p>
<p>4<br />
participation more rapidly and that those structures are the ones.<br />
Now, whether that means extending the ASEAN Free Trade Area or<br />
pushing along the agenda for APEC, these are the sort of structures<br />
which are..<br />
J: So you will be urging him to take a less hard lin~ e, a more tolerant line?<br />
PM: I don't think one has to urge that at all, I think, that has already been<br />
taken. It is a matter of trying to inform some of the views from our<br />
perspective.<br />
ends </p>
