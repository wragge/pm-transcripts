LIBERAL PARTY OF N. S. 4. STATE COUNCIL, 23RD OCTOJ-R 1964<br />
Speech by the Prime Minister, the Rt. Hon. Sir Robert Iienzies<br />
Sir and Ladies and Gentlemen<br />
Tonight I just want to talk to you because you are,<br />
if you will allow me to say so, my ow,½ n people and you, like<br />
myself and my colleagues, have a profound interest in what<br />
happens in the next month or two, what happens in the next ten<br />
years, but in particular, what happens in a Senate election,<br />
what happens in a State election, what happens in the wthole<br />
course of political controversy. And I thought I would like<br />
to offer a few words to you about one or two aspects of this<br />
matter. We are going to have a Senate election on December<br />
and our opponents, remembering the last general election<br />
which was only a little over ten mcnths ago, have been casting<br />
around to see how far they c: 3n divide us or embarrass us.<br />
TherVefore I want to say something to you about some of the<br />
things that they think they have disCovered that divide us oi'<br />
embarrass us, because apart from that, a Senate election coming<br />
pretty soon after the general elections is not an election in<br />
which you write out a new policy speech policy speeches cre<br />
not so easily prepared as all that and, after all, we were<br />
re-elected last elections on a policy w~ hich was a policy for<br />
three years and a great deal of it has already gone into<br />
operation in less than eleven months.<br />
What we really have to do in a Senate election is<br />
to report what we've done pursuant to our engagements at the<br />
election and to indicate what we see is the future shape of<br />
events during the rest of the life of the Parliament, and the<br />
people will decide, in the Senate vote, whether they want to<br />
repudiate their mandate given to us last December or whether<br />
they want to help us to put it into full effect. That, in<br />
reality, is the simple issue at a Senate election.<br />
But our opponents are, themselves, of course,<br />
heavily divided and they seek to divide us, and I must say if<br />
I were in their place, I would regard that as a rather suitable<br />
tactical exercise. Last night we were debating in Parliament this<br />
great Peace Congress whatever it is called which began<br />
today didn't it? ( Voice " Sunday") Sunday, oh well, rather<br />
good for a Communist-inspired Congress to meet on the Sabbath.<br />
I think that's not a bad idea. That I suppose) is tactically<br />
a good exercise. But we had a debate about it, and if there<br />
is anything that became completely clear in the course of the<br />
discussion, it wras first of all that this Congress is bogus,<br />
that it is here to preach peace to the most peace-loving people<br />
in the world, that it isn't preaching the same sermon in Peking<br />
and Moscow and the other thing is that the Lobour Party itself<br />
has got into a state of complete ambiguity about it,<br />
In 1951, which is after all not so long ago when<br />
we were in office, the Labour Party at its conference denounced<br />
these so-called peace conferences, said that they were ./ 2 </p>
<p>-2-<br />
" Communist-front" organisations and threatened with expulsion<br />
any member who attended them. That was just in 1951. Time<br />
has gone on and the Labour Party has moved steadily to the<br />
left. I don't need to remind you that in Victoria, the left<br />
wing had a great victory, its joint standard-bearers being<br />
Mr. Colwell and Dr. Cairns; Mr. Calwell being by disposition<br />
not very much to the left and Dr. Cairns being by disposition<br />
very far to the left. But they were two who led the forces<br />
and who had a great victory in the election for the Victorian<br />
executive. And all this time, in your State, the Labour Party<br />
has asstmed the attitude of an extremely moderate Labour Party,<br />
right wing or at the worst, centre of the road, but perhaps<br />
a little right of centre, and they have had some success in<br />
conveying this image, as I believe it is called, to the people.<br />
But now what has happened?<br />
Well, first of all of course, in the Senate election<br />
they have selected a very prominent left-winger to be one of<br />
their team, and when it came to this conference, this conference<br />
which leaves all orthodox Labour men cold or apprehensive,<br />
what have they decided? As I pointed out last night, the New<br />
South Wales Labour Party carried a resolution which said,<br />
" Well, officially we won't have anything to do with it, but<br />
unofficially, members may attend." Now, that's worth thinking<br />
about, isn't it? Officially, we don't associate ourselves with<br />
it; speaking as the A. L. P. in New South Wales, we don't want<br />
to be associated with what we well know to be a Communist<br />
front, but in order to have a little bit each way, we then say<br />
to our members, " Well, if you want to attend, unofficially<br />
( I don't know what that means) do so by all means." I say I<br />
don't know what it means. I suppose that when one of them<br />
attends, he says, " I want to make it quite clear that I am<br />
unofficial. Don't refer to me as So-and-so I dont<br />
know how this is done. But this is a proof of the ambiguity<br />
of their attitude. It is indeed from my point of view a proof<br />
of the steady move that is going on in the Labour Party ' owards<br />
the left. This will mean more and more accommodation with the<br />
Communists and with the Communist fronts. Now I want to say<br />
no more on that, about the Peace Congress because if you want<br />
to study what has been said on these matters, Hansard is very<br />
readily available. But I would like to say something about a matter<br />
which is now completely current and that is the great argument<br />
that is going on about internal airlines in New South Wales,<br />
and this I think requires a little bit of explanatory matter.<br />
I hope you won't mind if I occupy you for a few minutes in<br />
giving you that explanatory matter.<br />
I am not going to discuss the legalisms of this.<br />
I can't, These are before the Court. It will be for the High<br />
Court to determine whether the regulations promulgated by the<br />
Commonwealth and which occupy the field, are valid or not,<br />
and I say nothing about it. As far as we are concerned we will<br />
facilitate the decision of that matter by the High Court of<br />
Australia, and of course, obviously, what it says will determine<br />
the matter. But I just want to take you back a little. Back<br />
before the war, whon I was Attorney-General and a great deal<br />
more optimistic about constitutional changes than I am now,<br />
we had two proposals to amend the Constitution. One had<br />
relation to orderly marketing and it was rejected heartily,<br />
particularly in those areas in Australia which it was designed </p>
<p>-3<br />
to assist. ( Laughte: r) , And we put up with it, as a second<br />
proposal, a proposal that the Commonwealth should have power<br />
over Civj; I tviriatiLon. Nobody in the Federal Parliament<br />
could be found to argue about it, it was so obvious,<br />
Civil aviation if there is one proof, to use the<br />
old hackneyed phrase, that we have got away from the horse<br />
and buggy age, it is the fact that today aircraft take 6ff<br />
from Sydney and in a few minutes almost literally, they are<br />
in another State. And we thoughi even then when the aircraft<br />
was slow, lumbering and did 130 miles an hour, that it was<br />
pretty obvious that if you were going to have control of<br />
civil aviation, with all the airports you needed w-ith all<br />
the facilities that would be required, with all Zhe air<br />
safety measures, and all the navigational aids, with all of<br />
these things so obviously necessary for an efficient and safe<br />
and modern air service, it was quite clear that you couldnt<br />
have seven different authorities dealing with it. And so<br />
we put it up and it was rejected, not by any pmcess of reason,<br />
if I may say so, with great respect by the electors of~ that<br />
year, but on the safe general principle that when there' is<br />
a proposal to give any power to the Commonwealth, you vote<br />
" No. l Well, Sir, I'm a federalist. I have made this<br />
clear time after time. I don't want to see unified government<br />
in Australia, but we must have judgment as to what powers<br />
ought to be exercised in a unitary way, I would be astonished<br />
to find anybody here tonight who thought really that civil<br />
aviation ought to be controlled by six Slates anA some aspects<br />
of it, perhaps by the Commonwealth of Australia. And the<br />
best proof thal that is an accurate remark is to be found in<br />
the simple facts. I wonder if I might rehearse them to you.<br />
We have six States. We have South Australia. Now<br />
if anybody wants to tell me that my friend, Sir Thomas<br />
Playford, is a great believer in ur~ fication, he is wasting<br />
his time. ( Laughter) Of course ho's not. But it happens<br />
that in South Australia they have no provision for any State<br />
licensing of an aircraft at all. It is all done, for obvious<br />
and sensible rcasons, under the Commonwealth Air Regulations.<br />
I notice that Tom is now saying, " I will never surrender this<br />
power to the Commonwealth". All I want to say to you is, he<br />
has never exercised it, and it seems to me to be rather odd<br />
to refuse to surrender a power that you have never thought fit<br />
to exercise but which you have preferred to have exercised<br />
by the Commonwealth, for very sensible reasons.<br />
In Victoria, they have no State licensing. In West<br />
Australia, the laws and the regulations of the Commonwealth<br />
operate. In Tasmania, they have an interesting system. You<br />
get a Federal licence and a State licence and unless you<br />
have both, you can't operate. ( Laughter) Therefore, in<br />
effect, the whole condition for carrying on an intra-. state<br />
air service in Tasmania if there be such is that you have<br />
a Commonwealth licence, under the Commonwealth regulations.<br />
In Queensland, they have power to exclude Commonwealth<br />
regulations in relation to intra-state traffic but they have<br />
never exercised it, So you have five States in w.-hich. de<br />
facto the Commonwealth air regulations have operated, the<br />
Commonwealth authorities have licensed aircraft, and the<br />
allocation of routes and all these things air safety<br />
air control have all been in the hands of the central<br />
Government. And the one State that is out on all that is New<br />
go </p>
<p>South Wales. Now ) Z wonder why it is that in New South Wales<br />
there is some special circumstance which renders it undesirable<br />
that the Commonwealth should exercise this vastly important<br />
power in this vastly complex modern operation of transport.<br />
Apparently the answer is that there are two intra-state<br />
airlines operating here, quite quietly, and that thie State<br />
says that the Commonwealth ought to have nothing to do with<br />
the licensing of them or with the allocation of routes. Now,<br />
all that the Commonwealth has said is, " Look, we have been<br />
advised, rightly or wrongly, that we have power in this matter.<br />
We know perfectly well that we assume 95 or 98 per cent. of<br />
the entL* re responsibility for civil aviation in Australia,<br />
financially and otherwise." Just let me give you a few of the<br />
figures on that,<br />
Even in the case of these local intra-state airlines,<br />
the Commonwealth is looked to for a subsidy. Tie pay subsidies<br />
of œ CY+ 0,000 a year to these intra-State airlines. have<br />
spent in point of fact, œ C6 M. on facilities for civil<br />
aviation. We are at present finding œ C12jM. a year for the<br />
maintenance of these facilities, and oddly enough of the œ f1iM6<br />
Ai. or near enough, we find for intra-state facilities.<br />
Now these are very large sums of money, I think,<br />
In the neXt five years, airports development programmes<br />
in Australia coming into our account will amount to Q30M. plus<br />
another œ-600, 000 in this year for development and maintenance<br />
of municipal airports. Now these fabulous millions of monley<br />
are being found, and what have the State Governments found?<br />
A few score Thousand. If you added it all up, you coulintt<br />
reach œ C100,000. In other words, in practical effect, the<br />
whole financial responsibility for this matter falls on the<br />
Commonwealth Government and Pa rliament.<br />
Now what does this mean? This means that you have<br />
large airports. You have Mascot. You have other large airports<br />
in this State and in all the other States. They have to be<br />
provided with safety facilities by the Commonwealth traffic<br />
in and out of them must be regulated in the interests of the<br />
public safety, there must be effective controls over a control<br />
area, there are international aircraft coming in and out of<br />
international airports, and all these things are done and, if<br />
1 may say so, magnificently done by the Department of Civil<br />
Aviation, so that our air services, international and local,<br />
have a reputation all round the world, And the whole<br />
responsibility for attending to these things falls on the<br />
Commonwealth. Dont you think it is rather funny to have<br />
somebody come along and say " No. Forever and a day, we, a<br />
particular State must have the right to determine who shall<br />
fly in and out o1l these facilities that you provide who shall<br />
fly in and out of this controlled area, what their timetables<br />
are to be." This seems to me to be an almost monstrous<br />
assertion of something that in prope~ r consideration is<br />
irrelevant. If it is determined by the Court that we haven't<br />
the power then thi~ s will go on. If it is determined by the<br />
Court that we have the power, then of course, we will exercise<br />
it in the interests of the c'ommon safety.<br />
Now come back to New South Wales. There are two<br />
intra-state airlines. I have no bias about either of them.<br />
I know very little about them, but I do know that each of them<br />
is subsidised by the Commonwealth and I do know that each of<br />
them is serving what is the paramount interest, in my opinion,<br />
in this State the interests of the people in the country<br />
centres who want air services, both feeder to the main lines e 1 </p>
<p>and between themselves and Sydney. This is the paramount<br />
interest. We have never sought to interfere with it. W4e<br />
, agree. We have said, time after time, we want to serve this<br />
interest. In the second place, we don't want to crush one<br />
of these airlines, So far from doing that, we wcnt each of<br />
these airlines to have services allocated to it which wrill<br />
enable it to carry on a profitable operation and n useful<br />
operation for the people in the country areas. 4e have never<br />
said that Mr. Ansett is to have so-and-so or he is not to<br />
have so-and-so, I wouldn't know. All I know is that it is<br />
not beyond the wit of people to make an equitable allocation<br />
of routes and services as between two businesses, ea~ ch of<br />
which we are determined to preserve and each of which we,<br />
in fact, subsidise in order to make it profitable.<br />
Well, what does the State Government do here. It<br />
passes an Act, very hastily. It 2 ays down penalties running<br />
into many thousands of pounds the whole idea beingZfrighten<br />
people off acting unaer the Commonwealth regulations.<br />
And I had a letter from Mr. Renshaw about this only the other<br />
day. Before I quote that, I mu.. st just go back to the fact<br />
that on August 6th. which. is a long timue ago, I wrote a letter<br />
explaining all these things to every Premier the letter has<br />
been tabled in the House, it ouhkob, el nw n<br />
indicating first of a-ll that we were advised that we had this<br />
power; secondly we tihought it would be in the interests of<br />
orderly control off civil aviation that we should exercise it,<br />
and thirdly that in the case of any particular State, wo would<br />
act when it came to the point of allocating :-outes in the<br />
closest consultation with the State transport authorities.<br />
All that was stated very very clearly on August 6th.<br />
Well then, much later on, regulations of ours are<br />
tabled, they are due to go into operation unless they are<br />
disallowed, and TI have a despatch from the Premier of New<br />
South Waoles in which he sets out his views on this matter and<br />
indicates quite plainly that he proposes to go ahead, that<br />
he will not delay the operation of his own Air Transport Act<br />
or give any undertakings to that effect. In other words,<br />
that if one of theo airlines operates a route which it has<br />
already had for a number of yoars, it will do so at the risk<br />
of being fined f-10,000 or œ C20,000 and the Government of New<br />
South Wales will not hold this matter up pending the litigation,<br />
pending the decision of the Court as to where the power lies.<br />
Well I must say that that struck me as a most<br />
astonishing attitude because there is a legitimate argument.<br />
I dontt know who is going to win the argument but there is<br />
obviously a legitimate argument as to where the power lies,<br />
and this will be determined. The first shots were fired in<br />
the High Court today, and I say nothing about the legalism<br />
of this thing because I don~ t profess to be qualified to do<br />
so. ( Laughter) You forget, I don't forget, but you forget<br />
that I have been in this job for fifteen years ( Laughter)<br />
and not the law but politics. Not oven the profits, but<br />
politics, not the law. And so yesterday I sent a telegram<br />
to Mr. Renshaw which I later on today told him I would make<br />
public. I wonder if I might read it to you, it is quite short.<br />
It is not without point. eo* / 6<br />

" YOUR LETTER OF OCTOBER 20TH SEEMS TO OVERLOOK<br />
THE FACT THAT IT IS ONLY THE COMMENCEMENT OF YOUR<br />
AIR TRANSPORT ACT dITH ITS PARTICULARLY HARSH<br />
PENALTIES THAT CAN PREVENT A CONTINUATION OF EXISTING<br />
AIR SERVICES TO DUBBO AND ORANGE. ( Tha LB ricght.<br />
If our proposal that the status quo should be preserved<br />
until this matter had been determined had been adopted,<br />
then of course the existing services to Dubbo and<br />
Orange would continue because they are part of the<br />
status quo.) THEREFORE IT IS ONLY THE COMMENCEMENT<br />
OF YOUR AIR TRANSPORT ACT THAT CAN PREVENT A CONTINUATiON<br />
OF EXI3TING AIR SERVICES TO DUBBO AND ORANGE.<br />
THERE IS IN THE COMMONWEALTH'S VIEW NO REASON<br />
WHATEVER WHY TH2i EXISTING AIR SERVICES SHOULD NOT<br />
CONTINUE WHILE THE QUESTION OF CONFLICTING COMMONWEALTH<br />
AND STATE LAWS IS RESOLVED."<br />
Now I wonder if anybody thinks that's unfair. That's a<br />
proposition that is as old as the hills. In my time in<br />
those remote, respectable years in which I practised the law,<br />
this was a commonplace. " Well, if you will undertake to<br />
prgserve the position as it now is, pending the determination<br />
of the litigation, that is all right" and this is what we<br />
offered. " YOUR PROPOSAL", I said to him " IS THAT A<br />
CHANGE BE MADE PENDING LEGAL CHALLENGE. THAT WOULD,<br />
OF COURSE BE CONTRARY TO THE USUAL PRACTICE WHICH IS<br />
TO MAINTAIN THE STATUS QUO PENDING THE DETERMINATION<br />
OF ANY LEGAL ISSUES."<br />
DESPITE WHAT YOU SAY ABOUT PREVIOUS JUDGMENTS<br />
OF THE HIGH COURT AND PRIVY COUNCIL ( I wontt go into<br />
this' he had an argument based on the last decisions),<br />
THE TRUTH IS THAT NEITHER HAS CONSIDERED THE POSITION<br />
AS IT NO4 STANDS."<br />
And that's true because the last time this was in Court, we<br />
had not issued regulations, we had not undertaken to occupy<br />
the field of civil aviation control and, therefore, it hap<br />
all changed. " THE JUDGMENTS TO ;' JHICH YOU REFER SEEM TO HAVE LITTLE<br />
BEARING ON CURRENT MATTERS EXCEPT THAT SOME OMMENTS<br />
MADE IN THE HIGH COURT JUD6MENTS SUPPORT THE VIEW,<br />
UPON WHICH THE COMMONWEALTH HAS ACTED, THAT THE<br />
COMMONWEALTH HL4S WIDE POWERS IN THIS FIELD.<br />
AS I SEE IT ( I want you to note this) YOUR<br />
LETTER ATTEMPTS TO PRESENT THE MATTER IN SUCH A FORM<br />
THAT THE BLAME IN THE PUBLIC MIND FOR ANY DISLOCATION<br />
OF AIR SERVICES WILL FALL ON THE COMMONWEALTH WHEREASI<br />
IN FACT ANY DISLOCATION OF AIR SERVICES CAN ONLY<br />
RESULT ROM A DECISION OF YOUR GOVERNMENT NOT TO DEFER<br />
THE COMMENCEMENT OF YOUR NEW TRANSPORT ACT. ( Hear hear)<br />
IF YOUR GOVEPNMENT IS DETERMINED TO LET YOUR ACT 6OME<br />
INTO FORCE AND NOT TO ALLOW THE STATUS QUO TO CONTINUE<br />
PENDING THE LITIGATION YOU WILL UNDERSTAND THAT MY<br />
GOVERNMENT WILL HAVE T6 JAE IT CLEAR TO THE PUBLIC<br />
WHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DISLOCATION OF SERVICES<br />
WHICH RESULTS." ( Hear, hear) ( Applause)<br />
Now, Sir, having said that, could I just go back<br />
to the beginning of this phase when I said that I was a<br />
federalist, and I know that you are federalists and I know that,<br />
/ 7 </p>
<p>-7<br />
like me, you don't want to have a complete aggregation of power<br />
in the centre. But your federal principles always have to be<br />
thought of in terms of the practicalities of life. There are<br />
certain matters in which it would be disastrous to have control<br />
from the centre. Until somebody can satisfy himself or herself<br />
that he or she would like to see seven different authorities<br />
controlling civil aviation in Australia, then it seems to me<br />
to be pretty clear that there is an irresistible case for one<br />
doing it. Indeed, Sir, it is always unwise to prophesy and<br />
of course it is even worse to look back over a period ol~ twenty<br />
years ani say what would have happened if somebody had done<br />
something. Well I think I will take that risk.<br />
If in 1937, whenever it was, we hadn't had this<br />
contentious matter about organised marketing, frightfully<br />
unpopular in my electorate, if we handn't had that and had<br />
just had one single referendum proposal, civil aviation, it would<br />
have been carried by on overwhelming majority. Nobody has yet<br />
been heard to put a solitary rational argument against it,<br />
because you see in the nature of things, there are some matters<br />
which are indivisible. I will take an example of one that is<br />
divisible, the great problem of education.<br />
I would never accept the pooposition myself that the<br />
Commonwealth ought to have control of education because 1 think<br />
that education, if it is to achieve its highest results in the<br />
development of citizens, must have an almost infinite variety,<br />
it must have local characteristics, it must nct be just the same<br />
in Tasmania as it is in Queensland. Education is the production<br />
of a citizen under an environment wnich is not necessarily Lhe<br />
same environment as in some other place. And so I am all for<br />
variety in education, I would regard it as a horrible disaster<br />
if all the curricula in all the schools were written up in an<br />
office in Canberra,, That's what I mean when I say there's a<br />
problem which is in its nature divisible,<br />
But how is civil aviation divisible? Can anybody<br />
sensibly believe w1-ien a Boeing 707 flies into Mascot from<br />
overseas and it comes within the whole area of control in the<br />
interests of safety so that it is brought down by a proper<br />
system of control, that you can distinguish between that and<br />
a--other aircraft which is coming in from the west which has to<br />
go through the some controls, which has to be accommodated<br />
within the total pattern of flying?<br />
Look, ladies and gentlomen~ forn~ sins Irust have b~ n hoicked<br />
around the world and around Australia in the air for about a<br />
million and a half miles by now; I know all the noises that<br />
an aircraft makes exce-. pt one and I don't want to hear that.<br />
( laughter, Applause) And one of the glories of it is that<br />
we have developed such a comprehensive, such an indivisible<br />
system of control in this country, and indeed thuy have in Great<br />
Britain and elsewhere, that when you find yourself going around<br />
and around in a dense cloud, you just say to yourself, " Oh,<br />
well, we are in the stack" and you look at your watch and you<br />
hope that you will be down in about ten minutes. And sometimes,<br />
if you have to make a speech at the other end, you hope you<br />
will be very long delayed. ( Laughter) I understand all these<br />
feelings. But this is something indivisible, and to have what<br />
professes to be a great Constitutional issue, an issue of State<br />
rights built up over this thing, seems to me to be just about as<br />
silly and irresponsible as anything possibly could be. 1 And, Sir,<br />
I hope that nobody in this Party in New South Wales wil be<br />
0 0 0&amp; 00/ </p>
<p>8-<br />
deceived by it. Indeed, I hope that none of them will believe<br />
for one moment that if our power to do these things is established<br />
in the Courts and we proceed to become the licensing authority<br />
for intra-state lines in New South Wales I hope nobody will<br />
believe that we are going to do this as Zhe humble obedient<br />
servants of somebody. We're not. WJe are going to do this on<br />
a basis of equity and the predominant rights of the people in the<br />
country who need these services. ( Applause)<br />
After all, it is worth remembering that we pay the<br />
subsidieoz. We are not likely to land ourselves with an absurdly<br />
4igh subsidy becouse one of the airlines has had an absurdly bad<br />
deal and can't make money are we? You know, we can be foolish<br />
but we are not fools all Zhe time. That is a boastful statement<br />
but I make it. ( Laughter)<br />
Now, Sir, I don't want to say any more about that.<br />
I just want to go back to mention one or two other matters.<br />
Itve mentioned the Peace Congress, I've mentioned the airlines<br />
controversy. Itd just like to say something about the economic<br />
problem as we now see it and then something about the international<br />
problem and I'll be as brief as I come to them as can be.<br />
This great slogan of the Labour Party that this is<br />
a Stop-Go Government is brilliant. It's brilliant, like<br />
accusing n motor car driver of being a stop-go motor car driver.<br />
A terrible thing to be. Terrible thing. If the traffic lights<br />
are against him, he should drive through them. ( Laughter) In<br />
the interests of consistency, he ought to ignore the rule of<br />
the road, he ought to ignore the weather. Well.. you know, it's<br />
too silly for words that kind of thing. The fa'ct is that we<br />
have a policy which is briefly expressed in these terms% That<br />
we want the greatest possible degree of progress and development<br />
in Australia that can be achieved without destroying the stability<br />
of the currency. I wonder if anybody can fault that. And,<br />
of course, if that's to be your principle, then you must always<br />
De watching the indices of pressure on the economy, of pressure<br />
on the structure either shortages of labour or an over-supply<br />
of labour, shortages of material or an over-supply of material<br />
as it may be from time to time.<br />
And alongside of you, you have the Reserve Bank.<br />
All I ask of people is to understand that it is a very good<br />
thing to have a Reserve Bank. There's not a civilised country<br />
jn the world without one, and if you have a Reserve Bank you<br />
ought to allow it to do its job. A Reserve Bank is not 1here<br />
just to take the bidding, the whims and fancies from day to day<br />
of non-expert political people. The Reserve Bank is there to<br />
study all the aspects of the national economy, the credit, the<br />
-liquidity of the banks, the trade balances, all the matters which<br />
come into account, and, from time to time to take those steps<br />
which only a Reserve Bank can take to modify the effect of so-and-<br />
So* It may call up special reserve deposits some of the<br />
money in the trading banks when their liquidity is so high that<br />
a great inflation becomes threatened. It may, on the other hand,<br />
wrhen there is a decline in that kind of thing, restore, release<br />
some of these. It may move on the question of interest rates.<br />
It may take all these various aspects which are part of its<br />
technique, not only here but in any other country in the world,<br />
for keeping as much stability as possible in the monetary system.<br />
And we are all for that. We much prefer to have it done in that<br />
normal fashion than to be compelled to take stringent measures<br />
in a rather dramatic way. We had to do that a few years ago.<br />
It wasn't very popular. We are human beings, we have no desire<br />
tohve to do it agrain, and I don't think we need to because I<br />
0 0009 </p>
<p>9-<br />
think that these matters have been handled with very great skill.<br />
People may say, " Oh, stability. This is a sort of<br />
fetish." Nobody in this audience thinkis it's a fetish, I hope.<br />
Everybody in this audience tonight has saved up some money, has<br />
invested some money, has some assets. In a sense you knows<br />
we are all little capitalists, to quote that immortal phrase<br />
of Jack Dednaan's, and we want our money to hold its value, and<br />
strangely enough though this is supremely true in the case of<br />
somebody with œ C260 or œ 300 or œ C+ 00 in a savings bank, or with<br />
an investment in a life insurance policy, it is also profoundly<br />
true in . he case of some of the greatest industrialists and<br />
investors in the world.<br />
We have them in Australia from time to time, We have<br />
the advantage in Australia of having hundreds of millions coming<br />
into Australia on private investment account, with some of the<br />
shrewdest people in the world controlling that investment at the<br />
other end, and every time I see one of them, from a Roci*, efeller<br />
down the first thing he says to mc is, " Do you know what the<br />
grea attraction about Australia is? This is the one country<br />
with a future which Las great stability." It is worth<br />
thinking aboUt that, and with a little pride.<br />
There are plenty cf countries in Latin America, 4<br />
there are countries in Africa which may present the prospects<br />
for a quick turnover, some groat prospects of development, but<br />
their political and financial instability is So notorious that<br />
they are not an attractive haven any more. And all I am bound<br />
to say to you is that as long as we keep our heads and behave<br />
like sensible people, I have no doubt that one of the great<br />
factors in the enormous growth that is going to occur in<br />
Australia will be that we command the confidence of people,<br />
particularly in the United States and in Great Britain,<br />
Now the only other matter that I want to say a word<br />
to you about is t~ e matter of foreign affairs. I made a glancing<br />
reference earlier to the Labour Party and the fact that it was<br />
divided and the fact that it seemed to me to be moving fairly<br />
steadily in a left direction. Where does it stand on our<br />
foreign affairs? We had an election about this, and this<br />
p'. ayed a great part in the last election.<br />
We have alliances, we have arrangements, we have<br />
mutual. advantages and obligations with some of the great<br />
countries of the world. We have with the United States,<br />
the South-East Asian Treaty and AHJUS, the ANZUS treaty, the<br />
significance of which to Australia has never yet clearly been<br />
understood, and on top of that we have Great Britain in the<br />
South-East Asian Treaty and Great Britain in Malaysia and our<br />
obligations willingly accepted in relation to Malaysia, our<br />
constant opposition to aggression, wherever it comes primarily<br />
Communist aggression from the north and aggression a present,<br />
unhappily, from Indonesia. And we stand against it and we<br />
have had enough sense to get firm friends who stand with us.<br />
The Labour Party sneers. It is always quoting a<br />
phrase I used once about our great and powerful friends,<br />
You know, they do it rather well. They say, " The Prime Minister,<br />
he talks about great and powerful friends. This is a good way<br />
of dismissing them," They would be howling like mad for their<br />
help if the point arrived.<br />
But our policy consistently has been that we must<br />
build our defence and the defence of the free world, the defence </p>
<p>10<br />
of freedom, into the overall structure of defence with the<br />
other great powers in the world who stand for freedom and<br />
who indeed are prepared to lay out vast stores of treasure<br />
and of lives to defend it. I don't know where the ILabour<br />
Party stands on this.<br />
We had a funny little incident recently in the<br />
House, ( Bill McMa~ hon will remember it very well) where one<br />
of the Labour Members said there ought to be no Australian<br />
soldiers in Malaya, None. That's good Labour policy.<br />
Well, 7 1 sympathised with him because it is a wise man who<br />
knows what Labour policy is on these matters; ( Laughter)<br />
it depends on whether you read the version of 1951 or 1956<br />
or of 1959 or whatever it may be, and he was taken to task<br />
for this rather incautious remark by the Deputy Leader of the<br />
Opposition who, I understand, is a young man with ambitions.<br />
( Laughter) He was taken to task, and then he was restor'ed<br />
by Mr. Calwell.. I don't know where they stand. I really<br />
don't. All I know is tat-atany crucial1 moment over these<br />
years when a wholehearted statement by the opposition I'de<br />
stand with t~~ e Government on this matter; this is a joint<br />
policy for Australia" would have done infinite good, we have<br />
waited for it in vain,<br />
And I hope that everybody, Sir, will have these<br />
things in mind they are only a few out of many that we<br />
have to consider because we are going to have a Senate<br />
election, and although I am not without experience in<br />
conducting a Government with an equally-divided Senate ~ a<br />
hostile Senate, it is an experience that one gets a little<br />
tired of as the years go on. I beg of you, deliver us from<br />
it* I hove no doubt that we will be preserved in our<br />
position in the Senate by the people because I believe<br />
profoundly that at this last election we had a policy and<br />
a campaign which coiunanded the enthusiastic support of the<br />
Australian people and in particular of the younger people of<br />
Australia with their lives and their families in front of<br />
them. ( Applause I would be very unwilling to believe that<br />
the enthusiasm which demonstrated itself at the last poll<br />
was of so evanescent a character that it faded away by<br />
December 5th. It won't. But it will be for you, if I may<br />
say so, to maintain it.<br />
It is important that the Government should continue<br />
to have a charter incapable of frustration in another place,<br />
and if you think of what I have been talking to you about<br />
tonight and a dozen nnd other matters that will manifest<br />
themselves over the next four or five or six weeks, I am<br />
perfectly certain that once more I will be nble to say to<br />
myself when the poll comes along, " Well, we have a great<br />
number of grect people in Now South Wales who are doing their<br />
job and will do it with success."<br />
QUESTION : Is it not a fact that the Federal Executive of<br />
the ALP, meeting quite recently in Cainberra, has<br />
determined to work wholeheartedly for the Federal<br />
control of aviantion and if three or four very<br />
prominent members of the Labour Party are not<br />
already committed, through a Federal Government<br />
Committee to such a policy? a o0a0111 </p>
<p>11<br />
PRIME~<br />
MINISTER Sir you couldn't be more right. The fact is<br />
thai tie Federal Labour Party is unanimously in<br />
favour of Federal control of civil aviation. It<br />
has said so in Parliament, it said so through its<br />
representatives on the Joint Parliamentary<br />
Committee on the Constitution and it made no<br />
secret of it the other day, Its attack on the<br />
Government was not that we were assuming control<br />
over aviation but they thought we were doing it<br />
for the wrong reason, which is a proposition that<br />
mystifies me a little, but on the end result, Sir<br />
you are dead right. They are one hundred per ceni.<br />
Q. Will the Prime Minister please tell us whether<br />
his Government considers the suggestion made by<br />
Mr, Wilson in Britain recently practicable.<br />
You will remember Mr. WJilson suggested a Commonwealth<br />
consultative council be set up to<br />
integrate the affairs of the Commonwealth more<br />
closely?<br />
P. M. Well, Sir, all I know about that proposal is the<br />
necessarily brief reference made in the newspapers<br />
and I don't profess clearly to understand what it<br />
means yet. No doubt I will hear from Mr, Wilsn<br />
in due course because it is my practice to be in<br />
communication with the British Prime Ministers.<br />
I just point out that we have had in recent years,<br />
in the last ten, twelve years, a Prime Ministers'<br />
Conference each year which has lasted for ten<br />
days, sometimes for a fortnight and this enabled,<br />
of coursel a very great exchange of views to<br />
occur. Every year, some Minister or Ministers<br />
will be in London or some British Ministers will<br />
be here and, of course, discussions on the official<br />
level are almost continuous, and ve--y properly so,<br />
on matters of trade and finance, to take two<br />
examples. We also have the Commonwealth Parliamentary<br />
Association which meets regularly and that<br />
provides a means of contact between Commonwealth<br />
countries. There is also something that emerged<br />
in a general shape from the last Prime Ministers'<br />
Conference and that was a proposal for a<br />
Commonwealth Secretariat. Now that w'ill, pretty<br />
soon, I think, be discussed on the official level<br />
to see what the functions of a Commonwealth<br />
Secretariat ought to be. It may be that Mr. Wilson<br />
is proposing some modification of that idea by<br />
establishing some kind of permanent body or<br />
assembly or council, but I wouldn't say " 1yes" l<br />
or 1" no" l to it without knowing exactly what he has<br />
in his mind, but I am certainly, of course, very<br />
willing to hear what he does have in mind and to<br />
give it the most careful thought.<br />
Q. Sir Robert, I will send you a copy of this, but<br />
the question I want to ask you, reads as follows:<br />
I, along with many Liberals, view with concern<br />
the contention of your Government to introduce<br />
restrictive practices legislation and I hope it<br />
is understood that if the proposed legislation<br />
becomes lawg the Government will lose the<br />
support of many true Liberals and a large section<br />
.0/ 12 </p>
<p>12<br />
Q. of the business community. I therefore ask:<br />
( Contd.) Will you give consideration to the suggestion<br />
put forward by a former Queensland State<br />
Liberal Party President, Sir Leon Trout, that a<br />
small commission be set up to see if the<br />
legislation was practicable and if there were a<br />
sufficient number of cases of sufficient<br />
importance to warrant the legislation.<br />
P. M. Sir, if you will allow me to say so, you have<br />
made a few assumptions there. One of the<br />
assumptions is that whatever is in the legislation<br />
it will excite the great hostility of a<br />
great number of people. With great respect,<br />
how do you know? You haven't seen the legislation<br />
yet. We are not taking this matter lightheartedly.<br />
We have had proposals, we have had<br />
them examined welve heard representations from<br />
various aspects of industry and so on, both<br />
metropolitan and rural, we've had two or three<br />
long close Cabinet discussions on it of late and<br />
before we finish, we will be hearing more<br />
representations on this matter. I think . when<br />
the legislation finally emerges, the people of<br />
Australia will take it on its merits. I don't<br />
triink that everybody in Australia necessarily<br />
has the same view as my old friend, Sir Leon<br />
Trout, who objects to any legislation of this<br />
kind, as I understand it, on principle. I think<br />
the people of Australia will look at it and<br />
say, " Well, now what does this do? What does<br />
this make unlawL'ul? Is this a good thing to have<br />
made unlawful? What is the machinery that is<br />
set up? Is it fair? Is it businesslike? Is it<br />
not over-technical?" These are the things that<br />
people will look at, because it must be<br />
remembered that on this question of restrictions<br />
and trade practices, there are very many<br />
interests, there are very many fairly big people<br />
who may not like a particular proposal. There<br />
may be very many small people who do. The whole<br />
business that we have to aim at is to provide<br />
for genuine fair competition, because we believe<br />
tuh itsh. t asits ioi. sa . o cno radcacnocrQd awncieth witnepIuiTbp. de cra olicy<br />
interest. Now it is easy enouht o saytha<br />
When you have to come to or I O lnO<br />
form of a particular measure, that becomes a<br />
vastly complex affair. But I pin my own colours<br />
to this mast, that I believe that anything that<br />
we can do, however it turns out, anything that<br />
we can do to increase fair competition in the<br />
interests of the ordinary consumer in Australia<br />
would be a very good thing. ( Applause)<br />
Q. Does Sir Robert consider, even bearing in mind<br />
the differing economic conditions, the recent<br />
Territory ordinance prescribing vastly different<br />
rates of pay for native people of Papua and New<br />
Guinea as conducive to better relations with<br />
these people, when one considers for example,<br />
native doctors being paid a quarter of the rates<br />
of white doctors and native school-teachers being<br />
paid considerably less than half than that paid<br />
to white people in New Guinea? </p>
<p>13<br />
P. M. Sir, I beg to be excused from talking as if I knew the<br />
details of the regulation or ordinance because I don't.<br />
I have a Minister who attends to those matters. But<br />
I do want to point this out to you as a broad consideration.<br />
Itts worth having in mind. Our whole purpose<br />
in Papua and New Guinea is that some day we will bring<br />
these people to self-government. Now that is the object<br />
of the exercise to bring them to self-government. I<br />
add to that: To bring them to self-government on terms<br />
that they can sustain, on terms on which they can continue<br />
to live without being utterly dependent financially on<br />
other countries. I've seen a lot of modern countries<br />
inl the world newly-emerging countries, which are futll of<br />
political inl. ependence and are economically completely<br />
dependent on the first man who comes along with a bag of<br />
gold, and I don't want to see that happen, and therefore<br />
I don't accept the proposition that it necessarily follows<br />
that a great kindness would be done by us to the Papuans<br />
and New Guineans by introducing Australian standards of<br />
pay, for example, in their country. Wde would make it<br />
impossible for them ever to become politically independent<br />
with economic self-reliance. This is not a problem of<br />
sentiment. Thi~ s is a problem of doing what is for them,<br />
in the long run, the best thing and how this is to be<br />
dealt with in particular cases gy the Administration is<br />
a problem of great delicacy, not to be understood, if I<br />
may say so, except by people who are in the middle of it<br />
and who have given a lot of thought to it, and I certainly<br />
wouldn't endeavour to muddy the water by offering some<br />
extremely ill-informed views on it myself,, ( Applause)<br />
Q. Sir, I noted with much gratification you~ r remarks about<br />
the divisibility of educat-ion. I hove just spent several<br />
weeks in New ( tuinea in the remote parts and before I go<br />
on to the question, I must say on the ground roots level,<br />
the Government are doing a most magnificent job of<br />
education on the lower levels. ( Hear hear). H1owever,<br />
there is much concern about the developments and tnie<br />
adoption of the recommendations of the Commission on<br />
Higher Education, particularly at the tertiary level,<br />
The recommendations, which I have studied in great detail,<br />
are eminently sound and practical. Could you advise us<br />
of the intentions of the Government regarding the adoption<br />
of those re commendations please?<br />
P. M. Well, Sir, I am sorry to say that I cantt because the<br />
matter has yet to reach the Cabinet in a form suitable<br />
for decision. I have read the report myself and I think<br />
it is a very valuable one. I have also heard rumours<br />
and perhaps more than rumours in the last few days about<br />
a report that is coming in on the future of tertiary<br />
education generally, and judging by the size of it I<br />
think I will have to get around to studying it a dttle<br />
later, but I don't anticipate that on either of these<br />
matters there can be any effective decision taken in the<br />
next month or six weeks.<br />
Q. Sir, from time to time we see statements that the Army<br />
cannot introduce compulsory training or expand the CMF<br />
due to a shortage of instructors, Wouldlyou, Sir, ask<br />
your military advisors to consider establishing the<br />
Australian Instructional Corps which before World War II<br />
although small, was one of the finest bodies of permanon?<br />
soldiers in the world and a ctuallly trained the Duitroon<br />
men who load the Army today? * 000000/* </p>
<p>P. M. g1ell, Sir7 all I can tell you is that I know that that<br />
proposal, among others, has been one of those under<br />
consideration, but beyond that, I would ask to be<br />
excused because I anticipate that in the week after next,<br />
( the House meets next week rather longer than usual) the<br />
following week we are going to have a complete examination<br />
of the Defence position on a paper produced by the Minister<br />
for Defence, and when that's been dealt with, no doubt the<br />
answers to all these problems will fall into their place.<br />
Q. Has the Government been able to assess the effect of the<br />
change of Government in the Kremlin, and if so, what is<br />
that assessment?<br />
P. M. Sir, Ifm sorry. No. I'm asked whether we have been able<br />
to assess the effect of the change of Government in the<br />
Kremlin. WAell, the answer is that we haventt. We are like<br />
everybody else around the world, just speculating at present<br />
as to how it happened, but I did receive a courteous visit<br />
the other day from the Amb; assador from the Soviet Union in<br />
Canberra, who called to assure me that although there was<br />
a change of Prime Ministership there would be no change in<br />
policy. That led of course, 10 an interesting conversation<br />
between us as to ho difference between being a Prime<br />
Minister in the Soviet Union and a Prime Minister i~ n<br />
Australia. ( Laughter) ( Applause)<br />
Q. May I ask the Prime Minister a question somewhat related<br />
to an earlier one. Would the Prime Minister hope to be<br />
able to make to the country a comprehensive statement on<br />
the Defence situation, and including one dealing with the<br />
strength of the Army, before the Senate elections?<br />
P. M. I am a little cautious about raking prophecies. IP. in<br />
these conferences, Mr. Rowe, that we are having the week<br />
after next in Cabinet, if we arrive at conclusicns which<br />
are definitive and I see no reason why we shouldn't, then<br />
I would assumne that we would announce them in Parliament<br />
in the following week,<br />
Q9 Mr. Prime Minister, may I ask you whether it is a fact<br />
that the civil aviation industry as a whole is regarded as<br />
a back-stop to our Air Force in time of an emergency, and<br />
the second part of the question is: Does the Feder4<br />
Government also finance the introduction of modern aircraft<br />
to our civil aviation systems or guarantee the finance for<br />
them and therefore assist our airlines systems?<br />
P. M. You know, Mr. Waddy, you might almost have had a look at<br />
my notes because you have just reminded me I forgot that<br />
point, beca-use we have in fact, of course, as you know,<br />
found millions, many millions of pounds for the re-equipment<br />
of airlines, including intra-state airlines. We have been<br />
the financial backers of modern air services in Australia<br />
and modern facilities of all kinds, so that Mr. Waddy is<br />
quite rights As for his first question, of course thatts<br />
quite dloar that if we came to a war, the existence of<br />
aircraft capable of trransporting people and goods would<br />
be of first-class importance and therefore this is, in a<br />
reserve sense, part of the defence structure of the<br />
country. </p>
