PRESS OFFICE TRANSCRIPT 5 DECEMBER, 1978<br />
Prime Minister Interviewed by Swiss Television Team<br />
Question Can Australia's agriculture prosper without the E. E. C.?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
It can prosper without the European Community, yes. At<br />
the same time the European Community is enormously important<br />
to Australia. 80 percent of our exports, agricultural<br />
exports, to Europe have been prohibited by the rules of<br />
the Community. It is not only a question of access but a'-so subsidised<br />
exports while 000 million worth of which compete very directly<br />
with our exports in Third markets. We have the anomalous<br />
situation where we are not allowed to send a kilogram of<br />
cheese to Europe. 4,000 or 5,000 tons of very heavily<br />
subsidised European cheese find their way into the Australian<br />
market. Dairy farmers don't like that very much. If there<br />
were equal trading opportunities there Nxould be no troubles but there<br />
aren't. I believe that increasingly people are recognizing<br />
the justice of Australia's case in relation to the European<br />
Community and recognizing also that some changes will have to<br />
be made. We do need to get to a situation in which there are<br />
fair rules of trade and that applies not only to access, it<br />
also applies to the question of export subsidies into other<br />
traditional markets which can be destroyed completely by<br />
the export subsidy policy, and often have been.<br />
Question Do you think that new markets can be found nonetheless?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
There are other markets. But that doesn't alter the principle.<br />
We are involved not only with the right of access and what<br />
that will do for our own industries, we are involved with<br />
the principles of trade. That's a lot of what the MTN is<br />
all about at the moment; establish fair rules of trade so that<br />
the largest industrial trading groups don't use their<br />
industrial weight, their power, their size, to deny a reasonable<br />
opportunityto other countries.<br />
Question Are you blaming the E. E. C. and other countries, for applying<br />
discriminatory rules in agricultural sector. The Asians might<br />
do that and say you are having high tariffs on industrial<br />
goods. / 2 </p>
<p>SWISS TELjEVISION TEAM -2-<br />
Prime Minister ( continued)<br />
I don't think they can because they know quite well that<br />
in the areas they are talking about their exports to our<br />
markets have been increasing by 30% to 40% a year for<br />
seven or eight years. They've had very favoured access<br />
into our markets. The ASEAN countries know that we've made<br />
a number of very special arrangements to assist them to get<br />
access, and greater access, into our markets. One of their<br />
problems of course is that they are competing against each<br />
other, very often with the same compmodities,, but also<br />
competing against Taiwan, Hong Kong, South Korea, who are<br />
starting to export to our market area. You've only got to<br />
look at the rate of access, or the increase in the rate of<br />
access to our markets and it has been very great. You can<br />
look at it another way around we buy more sensitive goods;<br />
textiles, apparel and footware, from ASEAN countries, from<br />
the developing countries, than any other developed nation.<br />
We buy $ 2.50/$ 3.00 a head where Europe, North America,<br />
Japan, buy something in the 25 to 60 range. Now that<br />
indicates that is another measure of the openness of<br />
the market. There are some ironic things in this particular<br />
arena. I had one of our manufacturers approach me the<br />
other day wanting to export textiles to the Phillipines<br />
and he wasn't allowed to and he was told this was 100 percent<br />
reserved for the local market because it was a labour<br />
intensive industry. If our exporter was able to compete<br />
on fair economic terms he should have been allowed some access.<br />
I don't think the ASEAN countries, when you look at the facts<br />
of their trade and the growth of their trade, can really complain<br />
about the sort of access they've had to the Australian market.<br />
It's substantial access and it's a growing one.<br />
our position in Europe is that it used to be a substantial<br />
access but it has been reduced to nothing by the special rules<br />
of the Community.<br />
Question In your opinion, do you think Australia has done enough for<br />
its Aboriginal people, or is there still a lot to be done?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
There is a lot to be done. I think it might be a fair criticism<br />
to say that Australia started too late. In recent years great<br />
progress has been made. Resources are being made available<br />
and in this kind of problem I think we recognise that progress<br />
you can't achieve all you want to achieve in a week or a year.<br />
It will take some time. .13 </p>

Question Your Government has decided to mine uranium despite<br />
some opposition within the country. How vital is uranium<br />
for this country? What made you go ahead with it?<br />
Prime minister<br />
A number of reasons. There are, as we believe, international<br />
obligations. Overwhelmingly Europe wants access to larger<br />
supplies of uranium for peaceful purposes. Europe is short<br />
of power. It doesn't want to be blackmailed again as Europe<br />
was by the OPEC countries. It therefore wants to diversify<br />
sources of power. Uranium for peaceful purposes is an<br />
obvious energy source. We do believe there are international<br />
reasons, international obligations. Also because of the<br />
particular qualities of uranium we believe that it is much<br />
better for Australia to be involved in the trade so that we<br />
can make sure that the trade is conducted in the safest<br />
possible manner, with the strongest non-proliferation regime.<br />
We believe that the non-proliferation regime will be stronger<br />
than if Australia was not involved because of our very deep<br />
and real concern to make sure that the safeguards are as<br />
tight and as strong as possible.<br />
Question In your opinion, is Australia a part of Asia? Do you have<br />
any plans of bringing Australia closer to Asia?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
I think Australia has probably come closer to Asia over a long<br />
period. The Columbo Plan, a major aid program, was founded<br />
many years ago. Our foreign aid is centred in Southeast Asia<br />
and now in the Pacific also. We have very close relations<br />
with the ASEAN countries. A very particular relationship<br />
with Japan and a developing relationship with China which I<br />
believe all goes very well for the future development of<br />
Australian-Chinese relationships in future years. Geographically,<br />
we are on the edge of Asia and what happens in Southeast Asia<br />
will inevitably affect us. So to that extent, economically,<br />
geographically, we are very much a part of Asia. We can't<br />
avoid the circumstance that much of our historic background,<br />
cultural background and traditions are different. European,<br />
originally Anglo-Saxon but now broadened out into a<br />
multicultural society which I hope is less narrow, less insular<br />
and more tolerant than Australia might have been in the days<br />
before the last World War. What happens in Asia is of enormous<br />
concern to us.<br />
Question But would you be, for example, prepared to let in more Asian<br />
immigrants than you are today?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
There's no discrimination in our immigration programme on<br />
the grounds of race or colour or origin. The problem with / 4 </p>
<p>-4<br />
-Prime minister ( continued)<br />
immigration at the moment is the level of unemployment<br />
within Australia. It's that that imposes the ( inaudible)<br />
Question But would you be prepared to let in more Asian refugees<br />
than Prime Minister<br />
More have been coming in. If you look at the figures, the<br />
numbers have grown quite greatly.<br />
Question<br />
Even more?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Let's take the decisions as far we've gone at the moment.<br />
There's a very real refugee problem in Southeast Asia which<br />
we are aware of and there will be international discussions<br />
undertaken in Geneva within the next few days. We hope very<br />
much that the United Nations and others will recognise to<br />
a greater extent the international responsibilities in<br />
these areas. The size of the problem could well be beyond<br />
the capacity of countries in the region itself to overcome.<br />
This has been recognised by the United States and some<br />
other countries who do take a substantial number of refugees.<br />
Let me only say that Australia, with a number of countries,<br />
has been increasing it's intake of refugees very substantially.<br />
We will certainly do everything within our power and capacity<br />
to alleviate the very real and serious human problem.<br />
Question Why are there so many strikes in your country?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
I don't know that there are. Our newspapers report them<br />
very fully. There are sometimes too many strikes in export<br />
areas which bring people to notice but over the last year or<br />
so the number of strikes in Australia, the time lost in man<br />
hours and sort of thing, is much less than in the United<br />
States on a comparative basis. Three or four years ago<br />
it was quite out of hand. There is always room for<br />
improvement and we have recently made some ministerial changes<br />
which will enable greater attention to be given to this<br />
general issue. Make comparisons with some other countries, no need<br />
ton ame them, I don't think Australia's record stands too<br />
badly. </p>
<p>Question<br />
Are the economic problems of Australia any different<br />
from those other industrialised countries in so far as<br />
fighting inflation and unemployment?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
I think our approach to the problems might be a little bit<br />
different because we believe, as does the OECD organisation,<br />
as does the Secretariat of GATT, in its last most forthright<br />
report, that the only way to fight unemployment is to fight<br />
inflation; so that your industries become more competitive<br />
and get a greater share of your own markets and a better<br />
share also of export markets that might be offering. This<br />
also will give people confidence to buy and expand their<br />
investment, general activity. I think one of the problems<br />
there has been with advanced industrial countries over recent<br />
times is that people have said inflation is very important;<br />
they've made some progress against inflation. To an extent<br />
they've relaxed their general economic policies hoping that<br />
that will improve employment but in fact it has tended,<br />
very often, to make inflation a bit worse again with unfortunate<br />
effects on employment. When the GATT Secretariat said that<br />
if there is to be real progress in the expansion of markets,<br />
expansion of production, the reduction in unemployment, we<br />
need to get back to inflation levels of the earlier 1960' s<br />
or even earlier times. I think there is a great deal of<br />
truth in that. I believe we've got inflation down from, for<br />
us historically high levels of 17%, 18% and 19% which we<br />
inherited from our predecessors, to somewhere around 7% or 8%.<br />
It is still trending downwards. Our Treasury forecasts indicate<br />
that by the middle of next year it should be running at an<br />
annualised rate of about But we wouldn't be satisfied<br />
with that. We would still believe that that is too high.<br />
I think now in the Australian economy we are starting to see<br />
the signs, the early signs if you like, of the policies of<br />
the last year or two. Many industries have better order books.<br />
They are getting back into exports. They are getting a larger<br />
share of our own domestic market. / 6 </p>

Question Do you still consider Australia to be a lucky country?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
In many wags Australia is a lucky country. We do have<br />
natural resources and we have a wonderful land but other<br />
people could say that of their own countries. I think a<br />
country is what a people make it. Australia is what<br />
Australians collectively make of Australia. What we can<br />
contribute to Australia; how we can build it and improve<br />
it and make it a better place. I think you could say that<br />
of your people and your country it's what your own<br />
people make of it. You asked me this particular question,<br />
I think I am allowed to say that I think the Australians,<br />
the Australian people, have the capacity to make this the<br />
best country on earth; the best country in which to build,<br />
bring up a family and build a person's, a family's, future.<br />
That's the way Australians see it.<br />
