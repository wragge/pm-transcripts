<p>E&amp;OE..................</p>
<p>Thank you very much Bruce.  John Coates, the Chairman of the Australian Olympic Committee, Kim Beazley, the Leader of the Opposition, Jackie Kelly, the Federal Minister for Sport, my other Ministerial and Parliamentary colleagues, Peter Bartels, the Chairman of the Australian Sports' Commission and very importantly our magnificent Olympians.</p>
<p>Ladies and Gentlemen this is a very easy speech to make, the only I suppose constraint is the important discipline of time.  I want to say on behalf of the Government and I am sure I can say it on behalf of the entire community, of the National Parliament and on behalf of all of the Australian people, how incredibly proud we are of what you have collectively done for the reputation, the good name, for sporting excellence, the competitive spirit and the sheer decency of the Australian people and the Australian nation.</p>
<p>It's the biggest team we've ever sent to the Olympic Games, the spread of sports is the biggest, the number of medals won is the biggest, the organising effort that you John as the guiding light of the Australian Olympic Committee have put into the long campaign we in politics ever see things almost unavoidably in terms of campaigning for gold and you've done that so magnificently.  And you personally deserve a great deal of thanks for organising.  </p>
<p>It has been a great partnership.  It's been a partnership between the athletes and the Australian Olympic Committee, the role of the Australian Sports' Commission and the Institute of Sport I agree with everything you had to say about it John.  The co-operation you've received from both sides of politics over the last few years in preparation for these games, all of it has come together and it's wonderful when such a combined partnership produces such a magnificent outcome.  </p>
<p>We all have many memories. I and my wife enjoyed ourselves immensely, we took great personal pleasure and pride in being there supporting the magnificent young men and women who so magnificently represented Australia.  I said before that as I think a token of what and an earnest of what the Australian people think about our Olympic achievements and how important sport bulks in the life and the psyche and the sense of identity in the Australian people, the Government is reviewing the current level of support which is very significant for sport and we do intend to make a further contribution and we are going to increase funding. I hear an interjection from one of my Ministerial colleagues and he's fully supportive - the Treasurer.  Fully supportive and I'm not verballing him, it's true.  It's absolutely true.</p>
<p>But ladies and gentlemen I have asked the Olympic Committee and the Sports' Commission to jointly put proposals to the Government.  Governments have all sorts of commitments and priorities.  We think sport does bulk very large and we think it important that although inevitably there would be a special effort made because the Games were being held in Australia, that there is a case for making additional provision over and above the very generous provision that was contained in the last Budget and we will have some further discussions with the representatives of the Olympic Committee and the Australian Sports' Commission regarding that.</p>
<p>So to all of you can I just say again how proud you've made us.  I think it is nice and appropriate symbolically so that the last of your many gatherings celebrating your magnificent success should be in a building that represents the aspirations of all of the Australian people.  It is a building that itself sees many fierce competitive contests, all of them played in a particularly Australian way.  You represented, you represented your country and you gave great credit to the nation that feels very proud of all of you.  Thank you from the bottom of our hearts for what you've done.  I wish all of you well and I want to say that you've contributed to giving to the people of Australia four of the most delightful, enjoyable weeks that I've experienced in my lifetime and I think I can say that without fear of contradiction from anywhere in the country.  Thanks and good luck to you all.</p>
<p>[Ends] </p>
