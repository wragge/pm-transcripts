LIBERAL PARTY DINNER<br />
ROBERTSON ELECTORATE<br />
TERRIGAL, N. S. W. 18 OCTOBER 1968<br />
Speech by the Prime Minister, Mr. John Gorton<br />
Mr. President,. Mr. Bridges-Maxwell, other Members of Parliament<br />
and Members of this Federal Conference:-<br />
it has been very pleasant for me today to come to this<br />
electorate. I was able to meet too few of the people because time was<br />
so short, but, nevertheless, it has been, insofar as I have been able<br />
to meet some people, quite delightful. It has been doubly delightful,<br />
in a way, because I am with a member of the Federal Parliament who<br />
I think perhaps more than most members, more than almost all members,<br />
0 is really concerned with social welfare questions in Australia.<br />
He has given a great deal of time to this, a great deal<br />
of thought to this. He bombards me with memoranda about this, and<br />
much of what he has to say not all but a great deal of what he has<br />
to say has been extremely significant, and some of it has found its<br />
way into something that we are going to carry out. This is important<br />
to us, I think, as a country, as I will develop later.<br />
What I really want to say to you all here tonight is that<br />
you are, some of you initially, some of you as spiritual successors,<br />
the same sort of people who, over two decades ago, decided that Australia<br />
was going in the wrong direction. Those people who came together<br />
in 1945, nearly twenty-five years ago, decided the type of government<br />
they had, the philosophy which that government was following, was one<br />
0 which would neither make our nation great nor give to the individuals<br />
in that nation the full chance to develop their own capacity. They<br />
therefore formed a new political party, and subsequently changed the<br />
government. This has been significant, I believe, because if that<br />
change had not been brought about by those who belonged to conferences<br />
such as this throughout all Australia then we would not now be withincooee<br />
of the kind of nation that we are. It was because you and your<br />
predecessors did this that we were able to get away from a conception<br />
that the individual existed only to serve the state, and rather to accept<br />
the unalterable truth that a state ought to exist, and the only proper basis<br />
for a state to exist, is for that state to serve the interests of the individuals<br />
who make it up. So you got away from all the controls, you got away from<br />
all the dogma, you got away from all the old-fashioned thinking which, had<br />
it continued, would have prevented us from being what we are now.<br />
And I believe that what you did then has already -paid enormous<br />
dividends to the nation in which we live. At that time people were saying,<br />
if you have five or six per cent of unemployment, that is reasonable, that<br />
is the sort of thing that we can expect. At that time, people were saying,<br />
we ought to have profit control. It doesn't matter if somebody invents<br />
something new a new patent, a new way of doing things, a better way<br />
let me use this example in this electorate a better way of growing oranges<br />
so that we get more cases per tree, more trees per acre that doesn't matter.<br />
/ 2 </p>
<p>-2<br />
And we moved away from that, and during the period<br />
between then and now, we have advanced because of the assistance<br />
you then gave and are still giving.<br />
But there has been a change now. We are facing a<br />
period of change almost comparable with that period we faced two<br />
and a half decades ago, because there are new problems facing our<br />
nation, there are new courses we have to chart, there are new decisions<br />
we have to take. Some two and a half decades ago, there was no question<br />
about who would defend Australia. Great Britain would defend it. When<br />
the time came that she was in danger, we would go to her assistance<br />
and we went to her assistance in 19 14-18, in 1939-45 ( even before that<br />
in the Boer War), and th flower of our manhood. died in those two<br />
conflagrations. But in between times, we had no worry about defending<br />
ourselves because we were defended by the British Empire, as it then<br />
was, and the British Navy which ruled the seas and secured our<br />
independence. All that has changed.<br />
Now Britain has withdrawn, or is withdrawing from this<br />
part of the world. Now those countries to our north, which for so long<br />
were ruled either by Britain or by Holland, or by France, or by some'<br />
other European power, have become independent nations in their own<br />
right. Now there lies behind those indpcpendent nations the threat of I<br />
won't say communism but the threat of expansion on the Marxist-Leninist<br />
dogma that communism must be imposed by force over the whole world.<br />
We find ourselves contiguous to new nations and we find ourselves with<br />
this new threat, and we find ourselves without the shield on which, as<br />
long as we have been a nation, we have depended.<br />
This is one of the great changes we must admit has<br />
happened. There are two things that flow from it.<br />
First we must cement our relations with the United States<br />
under the ANZUS pact, for our own protection. Second, we must see<br />
what we can do to maintain the stability of those nations to our north,<br />
and thirdly we must contribute to our own capacity for our own defence<br />
more of our resources than we have ever had to contribute before.<br />
So we find ourselves requiring not $ 400 million for our<br />
own defence, but in this year 250 million, and we will find, as the<br />
years go by that the amount of money required for this will increase,<br />
though the amount ' of GNP for this, as far as I am concerned ( the<br />
percentage of Gross National Product) will not. I do not li be this. I<br />
doubt if you like this, because this kind of expenditure, thwje kind of<br />
resources could go into schools, roads and developments, and that area<br />
in which my opponent seems to be so engrossed sewerage and many<br />
other fields which are important and significant, but no so important and<br />
significant as this. This is one great change which recently has come about<br />
and which we must face, and are facing.<br />
Then I believe I do not necessarily put these in order of<br />
priority, but they are all important that we must adopt, as a nation in<br />
the situation in which we find ourselves today, a new concept for looking<br />
after those who are old or ill or handicapped or in some other way the<br />
subject of the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune. / 3 </p>
<p>-3<br />
. Up until very recently, the Party which I lead and which<br />
you support accepted the philosophy that what we had to do in the field<br />
of social welfare was to make a contribution, that we gave something,<br />
but that we didn't expect that something which we gave to be enough to<br />
meet all the needs of the human individual who was in need. We expected<br />
that the family, as it used to do, should be able to look after, to some<br />
extent, people who were in need.. We thought the charities from outside<br />
should contribute too. I don't think, in the nation in which we find<br />
ourselves today, we can any longer accept this. For myself, and for<br />
the Party which I lead, and I hope and believe for you, I am of the opinion<br />
that we must accept the philosophy that we need to be sure that the<br />
contribution the community makes to people in this position is enough<br />
to enable them to live in frugal comfort without any assistance from<br />
outside though if that assistance from family or charity omes, well<br />
that is so much the better. But there should be nobody who, in need,<br />
in illness, perhaps without a family, perhaps without access to a<br />
charity, does not have einoug h to eat, does not have enough to heat their<br />
home, does not have suff icient blan'kets to keep them warm at night. This<br />
we must stop, anid this will stop because that is another new approach<br />
that we must make. It is not easy to make it because the requirements of<br />
people of this kind vary so enormously. Some who live in aged persons'<br />
homes can save on what the community gives them. Others who live<br />
by themselves in small back streets and pay high rents cannot, but<br />
these are problems we are now examining. These are problems the<br />
Welfare Committee of the Government is trying to work out, and I<br />
believe will work out. These are problems to which your member in<br />
particular is turning his attention. These are problems which present<br />
again a change in the attitude which we must take as a nation to those<br />
who have served the nation well in their time, and who deserve, in my<br />
view, at least a decent, respectable self-respecting chance to live in<br />
their old age or in their invalidism.<br />
Then we have, here now in'-this nation, a sort of<br />
excitement, an opportunity for development which has never been<br />
known in it before. For a long time we grew gradually. Yes, there<br />
were gold rushes. People suddenly came here. They built ghost<br />
towns. They mined the gold. They went away, and the population<br />
increased as they came and decreased as they left. Apart from that,<br />
there was just a gradual development of industry, a gradual development<br />
of agriculture, a gradual lzcrease in the size of towns arnd c2&gt; s.<br />
All of a sudden, we are finding all throughout Australia new<br />
things iron ore, which will bring us in enormous overseas income oil<br />
in Bass Strait maybe oil in this electorate, who knows? We hope so.<br />

being built, new ports being dredged, new railways being constructed,: the<br />
whole face of the north of Austradlia being changed. Along with it, we . have<br />
the great development in our own industrial capacity inside Australia, the<br />
great requirement for people with new technological skills, the desire for<br />
people who will work and who have knowledge. This requires billions<br />
not millions but billions of dollars of private investment and millions,<br />
perhaps hundreds of millions of Government investment.. But the point<br />
is that instead of the gradual progress which for so long continued, we<br />
are now progressing geometrically. The sky is the limit now, as long<br />
as we can get the capital from outside, or from inaide, and the manpower<br />
from outside, and the technological skills from inside to take advantage<br />
of all the opportunities which suddenly have opened up to us. / 4 </p>
<p>4-<br />
This is a thing that has only happened in the last few<br />
years and this is a thing we must reach out and grasp because in<br />
grasping it and in using the opportunity so grasped properly lies the<br />
decision of what we will. be in two or three or four decades ahead as<br />
a nation. We will be by the turn of the century, twenty-eight million<br />
people not the twelve we are nowo and the turn of the century is only<br />
some thirty years ahead which, in the life of a nation, is but the blinking<br />
of an eye. Yet what we do now to seize that opportunity will decide<br />
whether, at that times we have achieved all that it is possible for us to0<br />
do or whether th,= e living then will -say " Thirty years ago people didn't<br />
have vision. They didn't see what was possible. They didn't t-r-ke the<br />
measures that were necessaryi They fell short, and we would have<br />
been a greater nation had they not fallen short.<br />
There are some other things that are changing too. I<br />
did see, Sir, on my way here, as you pointed out, the great roadworks<br />
which were taking place in order to enable people from here to get to<br />
Sydney quickly, and people from Sydney to get here quickly. These 1:<br />
have seen in quite a number of places in New South Wales and indeed<br />
in other States, and it made me think about whether in fact it was quite<br />
so impossible for a State Government to run its requirements, as has<br />
sometimes been suggested to me.' But I put that aside and what I say<br />
quite seriously to you all is that you are all Liberals, you are all people<br />
who, in the long run, will make a considered opinion felt not accepted<br />
by direction but felt, considered, and if reasonable, accepted. When<br />
this party was formed two and a half decades ago, there were certain<br />
dogmas accepted concerning the relations between an Australian<br />
Government and the State Governments which made up the divisions<br />
of this nation. They may have been right I think they were then; they<br />
may have been wrong, but surely you cannot ossify, surely something<br />
which has been accepted two and a half decades ago, it is reasonable<br />
to say ought to be taken out and looked at and examined again to see<br />
what a nation twenty-five years later now needs if it is properly to be<br />
a nation. I do not tonight wish to argue philosophical cases, merely<br />
to ask you to think about them. But I don't believe that in a nation of the<br />
size we are and in a nation with the destiny we have, it is possible for<br />
any other government than an Australian Government to have the overall<br />
control of the economy, to say whether a deficit should be large or small,<br />
to let credit run free if that is necessary or to constrict credit if that<br />
is necessary, to control taxation, to see indeed that the economic management<br />
of all our nation is run in one way.<br />
I think there is growing in our population as I think there<br />
ought to be growing in our population, a requirement that the educati onal<br />
facilities available to a child should be of roughly comparable standard,<br />
whether that child is born in Western Australia or New South Wales or<br />
Queensland or wherever it may be. I think that there is growing in our<br />
population a requirement that if somebody becomes ill and is in need of<br />
care, then they should be able to get roughly comparable care, no matter<br />
in what division of this nation they may become ill. If I am wrong in this,<br />
then I am wrong, but these are things you should think about because they<br />
are things that I am thinking about, because they are things the Liberal<br />
Party will have to think about if it is to move with the times. </p>
<p>I </p>
<p>I give only those examples there are many others but<br />
in giving them, I do not want to be accused, as I have been accused, of<br />
being a centralist. I am not. I think the administration of all these matters<br />
should remain in governments closer to the people than any government<br />
in Canberra can be, But think about whether the goals that I have suggested,<br />
the provision of finances that I have suggested for special purposes in<br />
education or in roads or in transport or in health ought not really to be<br />
something in which an Australian Government has a leading part and in<br />
which a state government has the administration and the disbursement<br />
of the funds. This is heresy if it is to be compared to the 1945 Constitution<br />
of the Liberal Party. What I am asking you to do is to put your minds on it<br />
and see whether you think it is a reasonai-. e sort of heresy or not. I think<br />
it is. But in the long run, it is conferences here and in all the other<br />
electorates in Australia who will have a great voice in deciding just what<br />
ought to be done. Certainly I am sure of this. The whole matter needs<br />
examination and discussion because this is another of the great changes<br />
facing us as a nation today.<br />
The rest what is it that a political party such as ours<br />
should seek to hold out to the people of Australia? Full employment?<br />
Yes, we have done that. A chance for material benefit? Yes, we have<br />
done that. The opportunity to take a risk and lose if the risk was not<br />
wisely chosen, an opportunity to take a risk and win and keep one'ss<br />
winnings if the risk was wisely chosen, an opportunity for material<br />
benefit, for harder work and greater rewards for that harder work? Of<br />
course these things we need to hold out, and I believe these things are<br />
now available. We need to give to people more than that because this is<br />
not enough. This material benefit, this material advantage, these<br />
material advances are not for individuals. People want something more.<br />
They want a chance not only to get but to give, not only to accumulate but<br />
to contribu te, a feeling that in what they are doing they are not only,<br />
improving the farm on which they live, expanding the factory which they<br />
manage, getting a better business, but a feeling that in doing that and in<br />
the other community work in which they may be involved, they are enabling<br />
their children to inherit a country which is a better one than the one they<br />
inherited themselves. They want a country with better opportunities for<br />
those who are willing to take them, with a requirement, and indeed a demand<br />
for sacrifice and contribution as well as material benefit from what they<br />
may do in their daily lives.<br />
I think that people want this. I am sure they ought to want<br />
it. I believe it is at the basis of Liberal philosophy. I think this kind of<br />
feeling in one way or another, with whatever nuances there may be about<br />
it is what has drawn you to support the kind of political philosophy which<br />
we apply and which has brought you to this dinner tonight. And if I am<br />
right in this, then I think that at the turn of the century we will 1.5 not<br />
only twenty-eight million people but that we will be twenty-eight million<br />
people who are materially great, who are becoming a power in the world,<br />
who are able to defend themselves, who see the horizons towards which<br />
they are going and who are in themselves fulfilled individuals. */ 6 </p>
<p>6-<br />
If this is the end result of what we are trying for, then<br />
it is an end result which I think has not yet been attained by any other<br />
nation I can think of in the world. So it is not only these material matters.<br />
It is the chance * to provide along with material advancement self -satisfaction<br />
that is the wrong word self-fulfilment and at that time a horizon which<br />
is quite unlimited. If you and others like you believe in this and help us<br />
in this and see that we have a chance to do this, then while you will not<br />
see the results any more than I will, you can, I think, have faith that<br />
those results will be great in the annals of the world.<br />
I believe that you are contributing to some thing which<br />
will be greater than anything we have seen before. You know, it was<br />
said, " A man' s reach must exceed his grasp or what's a Heaven for."<br />
I'd translate that as saying, " A nation's reach must exceed its grasp<br />
or what's a future for?", and a great deal depends on you to see whether<br />
our nation's reach does exceed its grasp and the future that is possible<br />
is attained. I will do my best; those with me will do their best, but<br />
we depend in the ultimate on you, and I hope you will give us your support. </p>
