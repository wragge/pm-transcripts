<p>CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY</p>
<p>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS OMITTED</p>
<p>It's a great pleasure to join you this evening and a privilege to introduce this evening's distinguished speaker.</p>
<p>First, however, a few words about the Association.</p>
<p>There's a certain pragmatic genius in organisation in which the order of the words “Australian” and “American” seems interchangeable, depending upon whose signature block is on the correspondence.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the acronym  -  AAA  -  covers either contingency.</p>
<p>Perhaps that is how it ought to be between friends, equals and allies  -  and it reflects the seamless way our people share lives in our countries.</p>
<p>Both nations have diasporas who not only enrich the world through their values and commitments but now serve the nations of their birth in the wider world.</p>
<p>No matter how far away, they share their world knowledge with us at home.</p>
<p>They never really leave us: they are our representatives, wherever they live and work. Our reputation rides with them.</p>
<p>It's just that kind of global public good with great national benefits that drives this Association.</p>
<p>Who else would provide the online listings of which Australian pubs broadcast American football and baseball and ice hockey or the emergency register of American-style ‘diners' in Australia.</p>
<p>Who else would advise unsuspecting Americans to ‘try before they buy' when it comes to Vegemite.</p>
<p>Or warn them that when an Australian business contact ends a sentence on an upward inflection it doesn't necessarily mean he or she is asking you a question.</p>
<p>The support the Association offers is also a serious contribution to the affairs of our two nations, including through your partnership with the Australian Government to found the United States Studies Centre at the University of Sydney.</p>
<p>One of the important pieces of work coming from that centre is the three-year $2 million “Alliance 21” project.</p>
<p>Enlisting 50 of the best strategic thinkers to identify challenges and opportunities for the US-Australia alliance.</p>
<p>Another important mechanism for knitting new bonds between our nations is the Association's postgraduate fellowship program.</p>
<p>Tonight, by your presence here, you are supporting young professionals with everything to offer and everything to achieve.</p>
<p>Young men and women with the same character and attributes as the young Andrew Liveris.</p>
<p>In 1976 Andrew was a newly-minted Bachelor of Science in Chemical Engineering from the University of Queensland.</p>
<p>First-class Honours, university medal, a bright love of chemistry instilled by his school science teachers  -  obvious potential for a fine academic career.</p>
<p>Instead, Andrew went for a job interview with Dow.</p>
<p>In the course of that interview Dow offered to “show him the world” - an offer he could not resist and one they have more than delivered on in the 37 years since.</p>
<p>Hong Kong. Thailand. Saudi Arabia. Of course, the US  -  and so many places between.</p>
<p>Andrew has transformed one of the world's great companies.</p>
<p>Recasting a 20th-century industrial icon as a modern, 21st-century presence in 160 countries and a global workforce of more than 50,000.</p>
<p>Turning Dow into a company dedicated to innovation, research and development  -  a firm that teams up with strong local companies to pursue global opportunities  -  a business producing high-tech manufacturing for new and profitable markets.</p>
<p>As Andrew set about transforming the company, he set about transforming the culture of the company too.</p>
<p>Taking to heart the words of Dow founder, Herbert H. Dow: “If you can't do it better, why do it?”</p>
<p>For Andrew, better also means better for the planet and its people.</p>
<p>He knows that social responsibility isn't an impediment to corporate success  -  indeed done right it's a selling point.</p>
<p>Now, 37 years after Dow promised to show him the world, Andrew Liveris, the boy born in the Northern Territory, is President, Chair and Executive Director of Dow worldwide.</p>
<p>There's a touch of derring-do to his work, no-one can deny.</p>
<p>A few years ago he played a co-starring role in former President Clinton's dramatic mission to repatriate two jailed American journalists from North Korea.</p>
<p>The plane used in the rescue was one of Andrew's.</p>
<p>When he's not on missions of mercy, he finds time to co-chair President Barack Obama's committee on manufacturing and to chair the US Business Council.</p>
<p>He's written editorials for the Wall Street Journal and given testimony before US Senate Committees.</p>
<p>His views are sought and valued everywhere he is known.</p>
<p>He has been named a Legend in Leadership by the Yale Chief Executive Leadership Institute and was hailed as a True Leader by the Australian Financial Review's “BOSS” magazine in 2012.</p>
<p>He is one of the most respected CEOs in the United States.</p>
<p>I certainly appreciated his participation in my 2011 Future Jobs Summit.</p>
<p>We agree on much  -  and sometimes agree to disagree.</p>
<p>From his base in Michigan Andrew is a frequent visitor to our shores and a keen observer of the Australian scene.</p>
<p>And still, after all these years, his robust commentary is delivered with a definite trace of an Australian accent.</p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen, it is my pleasure to introduce to youa great friend of two great nations, Mr Andrew Liveris. </p>
