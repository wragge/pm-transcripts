    <content><![CDATA[<p>
In the twenty years since the first Earth Summit, the world's great environmental challenges have grown.</p>
<p>Biodiversity is being lost.  </p>
<p>Many oceans and forests are threatened.</p>
<p>Carbon emissions and other pollutants have grown dramatically.</p>
<p>But in the same twenty years, the strength of the world's peoples to meet those challenges has grown too.</p>
<p>The global economy is twice as large as it was in 1992.</p>
<p>Economic growth has lifted hundreds of millions of people out of poverty  -  building new lives of hope and building the capacity for communities to protect their natural heritage.</p>
<p>New technologies have emerged  -  and continue to emerge  -  driving green growth and clean energy use.</p>
<p>And even through difficult days, international determination for shared action towards shared goals has endured.</p>
<p>World leaders and their peoples have united in the past to achieve great environmental goals. </p>
<p>We can do it again.</p>
<p>That is why Australia believes that this Conference must agree to develop and then work towards a set of Sustainable Development Goals.</p>
<p>Everyone here knows that collective action is hard  -  and global collective action even harder.</p>
<p>Because through global collective action we seek complex change, with imperfect knowledge, through difficult actions.</p>
<p>Everyone here also knows that setting goals is important.</p>
<p>Because when we set goals, we put before ourselves a task which is practical and empirical. </p>
<p>To allocate resources with rigour  -  to define progress through a measure of our outcomes, not of our efforts or intentions.</p>
<p>And even when we set ambitious goals, which stretch our resources and test our resolve, we bring a precision and clarity to our work together  -  and in doing so we set the firmest possible basis for long-term success.</p>
<p>The Millennium Development Goals have transformed global thought and action against extreme poverty.</p>
<p>While much remains to do, it also true that much has been done.</p>
<p>Including being on track to halve the number of people living in poverty by 2015.</p>
<p>Yesterday I was delighted to accept an invitation from the UN Secretary General to co-chair the Millennium Development Goals Advocates.</p>
<p>And through this role Australia will do its part in the vital ongoing task of pursuing the MDGs.</p>
<p>Our own aid program is set to increase sixty per cent in the next five years.</p>
<p>This is an act of a generous people  -  but undoubtedly it is one prompted by a determined global project.</p>
<p>And we believe global thought and action against environmental challenges can be similarly transformed.</p>
<p>Friends, Sustainable Development Goals are not the only important objective we will discuss here.</p>
<p>The world needs new models of clean growth.</p>
<p>This must be grounded in an acceptance of this vital fact:  that a growing global economy also consumes more energy. </p>
<p>Innovative new mechanisms like the Global Green Growth Institute, launched yesterday as an international organisation, can help.</p>
<p>Australia is playing our part, adopting market-based mechanisms like carbon pricing and investment for renewable energy technologies.</p>
<p>And as an island continent we understand the world needs a new focus on the health of our oceans and on theâblue economy' they underpin.</p>
<p>Australia welcomes the resolve expressed here at Rio+20 to step up our efforts for our oceans. </p>
<p>Australia is pleased to see recognition in this conference of the need for greater action to conservethe high seas and their resources.</p>
<p>We hope that all states will act urgently on this global issue by developing a strengthened oceans governance regime under the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, including for the establishment of marine protected areas.</p>
<p>We welcome agreement to take action to eliminate fisheries subsidies that contribute to over-fishing.</p>
<p>And to address the affects of climate change on our oceans, including acidification.</p>
<p>Again, Australia is playing our part.</p>
<p>Supporting collective action to restore depleted fish stocks, conserve marine ecosystems and improve the science of ocean management.</p>
<p>With additional funding of $8 million to the Coral Triangle Initiative and up to $25 million to the Pacific Oceanscape Framework.</p>
<p>And establishing a national network of marine reserves, placing some three million square kilometres under conservation management.</p>
<p>Women must be able to fully participate in and benefit from sustainable development.</p>
<p>I welcome warmly the SummitÂ´s affirmation of the vital role of women in all areas of sustainable development.</p>
<p>I was proud to be one of the Leaders supporting the Call to Action on Women earlier today.</p>
<p>Friends, with unity we can achieve change and that unity must embrace the world's women and all of our people.</p>
<p>And the world must listen to the knowledge of indigenous people and work with them as custodians of their lands and waters.</p>
<p>Yesterday Australia launched the Indigenous Peoples and Local Communities Land and Sea Managers Network, a forum that will help us listen and learn.</p>
<p>Friends, Rio+20 has brought us together for the third time in 20 years.</p>
<p>We are  -  each of us  -  greatly privileged to be present here today.</p>
<p>Let us greet this privilege with passion and perspective.</p>
<p>We are not here this week just to talk to each other. </p>
<p>We're here to decide, to agree  -  and then to act.</p>
