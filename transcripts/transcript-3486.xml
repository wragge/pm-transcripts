J!._ AUSTRALIA~<br />
PRIME MINISTER PRESS STATEMENT NO. 381<br />
November, 1974<br />
GREAT BARRIER REEF<br />
The Prime Minister, Mr. Whitlam, said in Cairns<br />
today that the Australian Government would create a marine<br />
park based on the Great Barrier Reef in order to protect the<br />
reef from oil drilling.<br />
Mr. Whitlam said the Government was closely studying<br />
the recent report of the Wallace Royal Commission into drilling<br />
on the reef. The report would go before the Cabinet again.<br />
However, because of the': urgent need to protect the reef from<br />
despoilation, the Government will now proceed with the creation<br />
of the marine park. Drilling would be banned in any area of<br />
the park where it was considered harmful to the reef or to<br />
the environment as a whole.<br />
" We will take this action to protect an irreplaceable<br />
part of Australia's natural heritage," Mr. Whitlam said. " We<br />
are determined to safeguard the reef and ensure its survival.<br />
We will preserve it both for its intrinsic value and its<br />
importance to the tourist industry of Queensland."<br />
Mr. Whitlam said it was essential that the marine park<br />
be established in co-operation with the Queensland Government.<br />
The Australian Government wanted a Great Barrier Reef Marine<br />
Park Authority to administer the park with members appointed<br />
jointly by the Australian and Queensland Governments.<br />
Mr. Whitlam said there had been little evidence<br />
of Mr. Bjelke-Petersen's willingness to co-operate. Queensland<br />
needed a Labor Government to ensure the survival of the reef.<br />
" The Premier did not even bother to reply ' to my letter<br />
of 23 September inviting his Government to co-operate with the<br />
Australian Government in the creation of the Authority," he<br />
said. " We will, if necessary, go ahead and create the Authority<br />
without Queensland." ./ 2 </p>

Mr. Whitlam recalled that the Wallace Royal Commission<br />
had been appointed because of a conflict between Mr. Bjelke-<br />
Petersen and a former Liberal Prime Minister, Mr. John Gorton.<br />
Mr. Gorton believed that Mr. Bjelke-Petersen's Government was<br />
not sufficiently aware of environmental issues.<br />
" There is ample evidence to justify Mr. Gorton's<br />
view," Mr. Whitlam said. " The Queensland people must face<br />
that they are being governed by environmental vandals."<br />
The Labor Party in Queensland had promised in the<br />
last election to dedicate national parks over five percent<br />
of the State. The amount now was a mere 0.6 percenti and this<br />
had been achieved only be adding 800,000 hectares in the<br />
Simpson Desert. If one excluded the Simpson Desert, Tasmania<br />
had as much land dedicated as national park as Queensland.<br />
Yet Tasmania had a land area of only 3.9 percent of Queensland's.<br />
Mr. Whitlam said the beautiful Weymouth rainforest<br />
was still a pastoral lease and the Iron and Mc1lwraith ranges<br />
were still under threat. In a State with a civilized government<br />
such areas would be national parks.<br />
" The Labor Party in Queensland has promised-and will<br />
implement its promise to dedicate five percent of the State<br />
as national park, including the biologically significant areas,"<br />
Mr. Whitlam said.<br />
" Through our Australian National Parks and Wildlife<br />
Service and our grants to the States for nature conservation<br />
the Australian Government will be delighted to help achieve<br />
this goal. " The Queensland people have waited since 1.969 for<br />
the Cooloola National Park to be created. They still don't have<br />
it, but it is already clear that when they do get it, it will<br />
only be a fraction of the size it should be, and most incredibly<br />
of a doughnut shape. It was promised before the last election.<br />
It is only because of conservationist and union vigilance that<br />
Queensland is even being offered this apology for a park.<br />
" The Queensland Government has also agreed to create<br />
a National Park at Cape Cleveland around the Australian Institute<br />
of Marine Science. The Australian Government, and the Queensland<br />
people are still waiting.<br />
" The Greenvale nickel project is being built at Yabulu<br />
and will pollute the sea one mile out with highly toxic ammonium<br />
sulphate, nickel and cobalt. The Australian Government has not<br />
even been consulted. " Cabinet last Thursday approved the. drafting of a<br />
Marine Environment Protection Bill. When this is law, we will<br />
be looking at such projects very. closely."<br />
Mr. Whitlam said the co-called Clean Air and Clean<br />
Waters Acts in Queensland were a farce. There had been only one<br />
prosecution under the Clean Air Act. </p>
<p>-3-<br />
The Government's treatment of the Bellevue Hotel and<br />
The Mansions showed its comtempt for the historic buildings<br />
of Queensland. In an incredible act of vandalism, Mr. Bjelke-<br />
Petersen had had all the verandahs ripped off the Bellevue Hotel<br />
knowing that this would create an eyesore and hasten the destruction<br />
of the building. " We have funds in our National Estate program<br />
for histroic buildings," Mr. Whitlam said. " I invite the<br />
Queensland Government to apply for the $ 150,000 needed to save<br />
the building."<br />
