PRIME MINISTER TUESDAY, 16-OCTOBER 1979<br />
From the Press Office SUMMARY OF ABC'S 12: 30 pm NEWS<br />
Street,. Minister for Industrial Relations, * said today<br />
the views of the Arbitration Commissioners had been taken<br />
into account when drawing up the Conciliation and Arbitration<br />
Act. The ABC's Canberra Office says the Bill allows the<br />
President of the Arbitration Commission to step into any<br />
case and either transfer it to another Commissioner or bring<br />
it before the Full Bench. Before handing down a decision on<br />
award rates or conditions the Commissioner has to refer it to<br />
the Deputy President of the relevant industry panel. The<br />
Bill also makes it easier for the Federal Government to move<br />
for de-registration of a union. Mr. Street was asked today<br />
about an Opposition claim that the Government was trying to put<br />
astraightjacket on the* Arbitration Commission.<br />
Mr. Street<br />
Well, of course that's nonsense. The consultancy process<br />
is not a straightjacket at all. It is to maintain<br />
consistency so that you don't suddenly get one wage decision<br />
which is out of line with the general run, which of course<br />
creates enormous industrial disruption. That is what it is<br />
for and that is what I am sure it will achieve.<br />
The amendments 1: o the Conciliation and Arbitration Act are<br />
due to go before the Senate this week.<br />
A strong earthquake followed by a series of after-shocks has<br />

towns and communities.<br />
Flash floods in the northwest of Italy, triggered by three days<br />
of continuous heavy rain have caused the deaths of two people.<br />
I1ran . and : Libya have . put * up. their oil, prices, and in doing so<br />
' hav&amp;-' bec6m-n&amp; the f Iirst countries ' to ' go above the ceiling agreed<br />
on by OPEC., Libya has raised the price of all its grades of<br />
r. o il by '$ 2.77 cents American a barrel. This makes its highest<br />
grade $ 26.27 compared with the OPEC ceiling price of $ 23.50.<br />
Iran has increased the price of its best grade of crude by $ 1.50<br />
to $ 23.71. At their meeting in June, member nations of OPEC<br />
had agreed to hold prices at or below the ceiling. The guideline,<br />
which was not binding on members, had held firm until now.<br />
On the first day of his European visit, China's Chairman has<br />
launched a strong but indirect attack on the policies of the<br />
Soviet Union. Speaking at a banquet in Paris he said that in<br />
Europe, the Middle East, Africa and Asia, treacherous means<br />
of agression were being used to sow discord. He said the<br />
risk of grave military confrontation also existed in Europe.<br />
