    <content><![CDATA[<p>E&amp;OE................................................................................................</p>
<p>To Mr Bill Skate, the Prime Minister of Papua New Guinea, distinguished</p>
<p> guests ladies and gentlemen. There are a number of reasons why today</p>
<p> luncheon is a very special occasion. It brings together two nations</p>
<p> that have deep ties of history and people-to-people links. It is also</p>
<p> the first occasion on which Bill Skate as Prime Minister has visited</p>
<p> Canberra and we very very warmly welcome you Sir, not only in your</p>
<p> own right but also as the Prime Minister of a Nation for whom Australia</p>
<p> and Australians has a very deep affection. It is impossible to adequately</p>
<p> catalogue the links that do exist between our two nations and chatting</p>
<p> over the dinner table we reminded ourselves of just how intricate</p>
<p> are those links. I discovered, for example, the Minister for Resources</p>
<p> in the Government, Senator Warwick Parer, spent the first six years</p>
<p> of his life in Rabaul. I was reminded by a former Prime Minister,</p>
<p> Bob Hawke, that he spent some time of his life as a trade union official</p>
<p> giving advice on wages and industrial relations policy in Papua New</p>
<p> Guinea. And I recall the contribution to the building of that nation</p>
<p> by many of my former colleagues in the Coalition.</p>
<p>Of course the ties that bind us together are nowhere more powerful</p>
<p> than in an area of common love between Australians and the people</p>
<p> of Papua New Guinea and that is in the area of sport. And of all the</p>
<p> sporting links between the two nations, none is more powerful than</p>
<p> in the game of rugby league. And I'm delighted to acknowledge</p>
<p> the presence here today of a number of people who symbolise that link.</p>
<p> I'm delighted to acknowledge, of course, the presence of an Australian</p>
<p> who's probably better known in Papua New Guinea than any other</p>
<p> Australian and that is Mal Meninga, one of Australia's greatest</p>
<p> rugby league players and a great Kangaroo captain and now the coach</p>
<p> of the Canberra Raiders.</p>
<p>I'm also delighted to welcome John Ribot, the Executive Director</p>
<p> of the Melbourne Storm Rugby League Club. And as you will know, Mr</p>
<p> Skate, John captained the Australian President's XIII to Papua</p>
<p> New Guinea in 1985 and has maintained his links ever since. And, of</p>
<p> course, your own Marcus Bai, who's been such an outstanding success</p>
<p> as a player with Melbourne Storm, is also here and he, himself, is</p>
<p> building his own hero status amongst rugby league followers. And you'll</p>
<p> forgive me, ladies and gentlemen, whilst I'm on the subject of</p>
<p> football, of the rugby variety, but I take the opportunity, sparing</p>
<p> Graham Fortune's blushes, of acknowledging the tremendous achievement</p>
<p> of the Australian Wallabies at Lancaster Park last Saturday in winning</p>
<p> the Bledisloe Cup.</p>
<p>Of course, ladies and gentlemen, we gather here today in the shadow</p>
<p> of that enormous tragedy that overtook the villages around the Sissano</p>
<p> Lagoon. We record and reflect with immense sadness on the horrific</p>
<p> loss of life. And can I say to you, Prime Minister, that all Australians</p>
<p> felt for the families affected by that tragedy; the wives made widows,</p>
<p> the children made orphans and those left disabled. And we all felt</p>
<p> a special pang of sympathy and affection for you and for your country</p>
<p> as you coped valiantly with such a terrible disaster. And our desire</p>
<p> to reach out to you was a reflex action, an instinctive response to</p>
<p> family friends.</p>
<p>About 140 Australian Defence Force personnel were on the ground for</p>
<p> two weeks. There were medical staff and they helped deal with horrible</p>
<p> cases of gangrene coupled with scores of broken limbs and the prospect</p>
<p> of terrible disease. There were also communication specialists, logistics</p>
<p> staff, engineers and RAAF air crews whose support was essential. And</p>
<p> quite a number of them are here today as very welcome and honoured</p>
<p> guests of the Australian Government and I know, in a general sense,</p>
<p> of also the Government of Papua New Guinea.</p>
<p>Can I say, as Prime Minister, how immensely proud I was and I know</p>
<p> that all Australians were for what those men and women did in those</p>
<p> days immediately following that disaster. We can only begin to try</p>
<p> and understand the mental strain and trauma and the painful and distressing</p>
<p> circumstances under which they worked. But to see amidst that devastation</p>
<p> and death and sorrow and sadness, to see those wonderful images of</p>
<p> Australian defence personnel working in the name of humanity and decency</p>
<p> to relieve suffering touched me and touched all Australians in a way</p>
<p> that I hope those of you who are here and your colleagues who shared</p>
<p> that experience will understand and accept as a very, very sincere</p>
<p> and grateful expression of how we felt.</p>
<p>There is something particularly touching about the image of a person</p>
<p> wearing that wonderful slouch hat, ministering to people who are sick</p>
<p> and disabled and in a situation of distress. And all Australians are</p>
<p> immensely proud of you and we are immensely grateful to you for the</p>
<p> way in which you demonstrated that Australia is a true friend of those</p>
<p> in need and how deeply compassionate and how willing is the Australian</p>
<p> spirit when it is called upon in those circumstances.</p>
<p>Those images will remain with Australians for a long time. And for</p>
<p> myself, that tragedy served to remind how history, geography and circumstance</p>
<p> continues to bind our two nations together. It must have brought back</p>
<p> to many Australians, as it did to me, images of our shared past. Not</p>
<p> so vivid, perhaps, none so vivid rather, perhaps, as the tales, those</p>
<p> affection tales, of the so-called Â‘fuzzy-wuzzy angels' who</p>
<p> helped Australian soldiers more than 50 years ago. The feats of tens</p>
<p> of thousands of those intrepid carriers are immortalised by the stories</p>
<p> of the help they gave to wounded Australian diggers, mainly on stretchers,</p>
<p> over the tortuous Kokoda track. Some of you may have read or heard</p>
<p> the original 1942 poem by Bert Beros, and I quote just a small part</p>
<p> of it:</p>
<p>"Many a mother in Australia when the busy day is done sends</p>
<p> a prayer to the Almighty for the keeping of her son, asking that</p>
<p> an angel guide him and bring him safely back.</p>
<p>Now we see those prayers are answered on the Owen Stanley track.</p>
<p> May the mothers of Australia when they offer up a prayer mention</p>
<p> those impromptu angels with their fuzzy wuzzy hair".</p>
<p>And however sentimental the rhyme and however in the eyes of some</p>
<p> but not, I think, in the eyes of most, dated the language may seem,</p>
<p> the poem helped to tell then how Australians were drawn through gratitude</p>
<p> and admiration to your people and it remains a heartfelt appreciation</p>
<p> enduring even unto today. And in a small way many Australians will</p>
<p> see the demonstration of compassion and help given so effectively</p>
<p> by the men and women of the Australian Defence Force as a small repayment</p>
<p> of the immense debt of gratitude that the wartime Australian diggers</p>
<p> owed to the people of your lovely country.</p>
<p>Mr Prime Minister, you may rest assured that the Government I lead</p>
<p> and the people of Australia consider Papua New Guinea a close friend</p>
<p> and we'll continue to support your efforts to rebuild after that</p>
<p> horrible disaster. And in addition to what has already been provided</p>
<p> we will provide whatever additional resources are needed beyond those</p>
<p> already available to ensure the reconstruction of the two or three</p>
<p> new schools needed, the upgrading of roads, the alterations to make</p>
<p> facilities accessible to the disabled, help with agriculture and fisheries</p>
<p> to rebuild the area's economy, assistance to church and non-government</p>
<p> organisations for rebuilding in new areas, ongoing support for those</p>
<p> suffering orthopedic injuries and amputations, support for geological</p>
<p> survey work and advance to local level administration on planning.</p>
<p>Mr Prime Minister, let me say how pleased the Australian Government</p>
<p> is with the role that you and your Government has played in relation</p>
<p> to the very difficult challenge of Bougainville. We have seen the</p>
<p> emergence of consultation, negotiation and the first possibilities</p>
<p> of a lasting peace and political settlement. We in Australia are not</p>
<p> nave about what lies ahead and ultimately, of course, success will</p>
<p> depend upon the attitude of the Bouganvillians themselves. But we</p>
<p> have made progress and you deserve a great deal of the credit for</p>
<p> that.</p>
<p>And can I also take the opportunity of recording the appreciation</p>
<p> that I feel and the Government feels towards the part played by the</p>
<p> Australian Foreign Minister, Alexander Downer, in the progress that</p>
<p> has been made in achieving some kind of lasting settlement in Bougainville.</p>
<p> And after so many years of conflict we all look forward to the prospect</p>
<p> of peace and I know from our discussions that you are deeply committed</p>
<p> to peace on Bougainville. And I also know from our discussions this</p>
<p> morning that Australia and Papua New Guinea and our other friends</p>
<p> in the Pacific region will work together very closely to achieve that</p>
<p> goal.</p>
<p>In our discussions this morning we shared our thoughts regarding the</p>
<p> impact of the economic downturn in the Asia-Pacific region on our</p>
<p> two countries. That impact is not going to pass quickly and there</p>
<p> is quite a deal of water to flow under that particular bridge before</p>
<p> we are going to see an upturn in the economies of that region. We</p>
<p> both agreed about the importance of continuing to pursue, notwithstanding</p>
<p> the difficulties, those necessary reforms that will make our two economies</p>
<p> more effective and more competitive, not only in the Asia-Pacific</p>
<p> region but also in the broader world. And we here in Australia, of</p>
<p> course, will be embarking upon a very major reform of our taxation</p>
<p> system. And I know from our discussions this morning, given your own</p>
<p> intentions in that particular area, that you will closely examine</p>
<p> the field evidence that emerges from the Australian experience.</p>
<p>Mr Prime Minister, it has been a personal pleasure for me to be your</p>
<p> host today. We met last year on several occasions. I respect and admire</p>
<p> the challenging way in which you are going about your task as Prime</p>
<p> Minister of your country. Australia and Papua New Guinea share a lot</p>
<p> of history, we are friends, we respect each other, we will periodically</p>
<p> differ. Our relationship is now the mature relationship of two sovereign</p>
<p> independent nations. The relationship was once otherwise but we have</p>
<p> grown, I think, easily and effectively and comfortably into the new</p>
<p> relationship.</p>
<p>On behalf of the people of Australia, I bid you a very warm welcome.</p>
<p> On behalf of the people of Australia I send to you and your fellow</p>
<p> country men and women, our good wishes, our determination to maintain</p>
<p> the close ties that have characterised our relationship and the gratitude</p>
<p> for the shared experiences and the mutual assistance which has gone</p>
<p> in earlier years. I would now like t o invite the Deputy Leader of</p>
<p> the Opposition, Mr Gareth Evans, to support my remarks. Thank you.</p>
