the Budget, the Budget ofters an oppor-tunit which Austrailians<br />
cannot afford to miss, to obtain commuity-wide support for<br />
wag e restraint and co-operation. The combination of nersonal<br />
tax cuLts and the new Lax,. reb,-ate on home interest rates w,. ill<br />
improve the position of Australian families dramatically.<br />
The BudIget also addresses the wider needs of Aus-tralz'an families<br />
with increaises in family al-lowance~ s and threlch the new family<br />
income snoojilement of7 $ 10 .00 a weel-ffor each dclpent chil<br />
for low income families.<br />
The Budget also iimproves the position of. E otnier needy groups<br />

The k1ind of co-operation which Australia needs t-odlay ca nnot,<br />
however, be achieved by Governn-enlts alone,, it cannot be imposed<br />
as a matter of Government Pol icy. The Government has done what<br />
it can in giving a leadl, and providince a-basis ' or co-operation<br />
to prevent any new wage push, and T bol i,, ve the comt-runitv,<br />
will want employers and emrployees, iii--nagement and unions, to<br />
heLed th1e, Government's call for i-oidera tion and oo-opera-: tnon.<br />

its real response in a practical way to tChe fact that rm. any<br />
things in the Budget are consistent with -, h-at th-ey have been<br />
advocating. But it is encouraging that the ACTU has welcomied<br />
the tax cuts in the Budget. as -a contCribuD~ tion to stability in<br />
industrial relations, as sati.-fy,-Jig ACTU demands for " tax<br />
indexation and an equl table redistribution of the income tax<br />
burden away from the lowver income earners and famiiiilies", and<br />

<p>What we need is a willingness of groups within our community not<br />
to push demands which are out of line with these recent<br />
settlements and to take account of the enormous costs in terms<br />
of employment and Australia's long term economic prospects which<br />
would flow almost inevitably from significant wage rises at this<br />
time.<br />
When we look at the urgent need for co-operation the Labor Party's<br />
talk about prices and incomes policy is total irrelevance. Labor<br />
has not got a policy on prices and incomes. The whole proposal<br />
is utterly vague and ill-defined, it provides no basis for<br />
2ffective economic management in difficult times. But there<br />
isno doubt that in practice, a so-called prices and incomes<br />
policy would mean support from the Labor Party for higher wage<br />
rises than the economy can afford, together with Government<br />
provided benefits which would increase Government spending massively<br />
and fuel inflation as a result.<br />
It is also clear that after 12 months of detailed discussion,<br />
Labor has not got real ACTU commitment to practical and<br />
realistic policies. That is not surprising because Labor's<br />
policies are vague in the extreme and Labor has certainly got<br />
no agreement to a prices and incomes policy from the employers,<br />
because it has apparently not yet seen fit even to consult them.<br />
People should also remember that in any case a deal with the<br />
ACTU would not be a deal with all the unions. What do the<br />
metal trades unions, the air traffic controllers, the Bass<br />
Strait oil workers, the railway workers in Queensland, the BLF<br />
and the Shop Assistants' Union, for example think about all of<br />
this? What would they be prepared to do? The Labor Party<br />
never has and never will be able to get the Australian community<br />
to work together. The time when Mr Hayden was in Government and<br />
when Mr Hawke was President of the ACTU and of the Labor Party,<br />
tells the story of Labor's economic and industrial incompetence<br />
in Government, because at that time, when they had the chance<br />
to show what they could do, Australia's industrial relations were<br />
disastrous. The almost 6 million working days lost through<br />
strikes and disputes in 1974 is more than 50% greater than the<br />
S number of working days lost last year and as we all know last<br />
year. was not a good year for industrial relations.<br />
Labor would again pursue divisive policies. Labor's policies<br />
remove all incentive to co-operate. Labor would give special and<br />
unreasonable privileges to the trade unions, whichwould give the<br />
unions every reason to be immoderate in their demands. Labor's<br />
distrust of the private sector means that business will never<br />
have confidence under Labor, that its interests will never be taken<br />
into account.<br />
Labor would deliberately, favo1ur sectional interestss, r specially<br />
through . practices such as trade ' union preference, . wh. i. ch would<br />
not provide a basis for the com! muii. ty as a whole to work together.<br />
Wherever Labor has had a chance t. o gov(). rn, it has always caused<br />
economic chaos through mj. sl'nag( cement and wrong policies and<br />
this does not happen by cha. ncc. It happens because Labor's<br />
socialism means that Labor Governments try to drive Australians<br />
where they do not want to go and this prevents; Australians from<br />
working together or co-operating. Au; : tral ia cannot a[ ford that.<br />
It is only with responsible, practical economic policies and by<br />
working together, that we will be able to keep building this country<br />
and overcome present economic problems. n r<br />
