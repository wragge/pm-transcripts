SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE RT. KONo R. I NZIES<br />
AT THE ALL NATIONS CLUB ON FRIDAY, 25TH NOV4EMER, 1960.<br />
Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen:<br />
I want to compliment my old friend, the President, o)<br />
his obviously continuing studies in ambiguity. ( Laughter) I've<br />
never heard a more masterly exhibition of ambiguity than the one<br />
he gave us tonight, since the last time I read one of his<br />
judgments. ( Laughter)<br />
I also want to say at once, a propos of the last<br />
remark, about Sir Richard Boyer's rock-and-roll session, that on<br />
one occasion this may seem to some of you to be rcriarkr. le I<br />
was up at the A. B. C. Studios doing a television recording this<br />
is a remarkable event and on the way out it turned out that the<br />
Rock-and -Roll Session was on.<br />
For some reason that is concealed from the wis and<br />
prudent and revealed only unto babes, the gentleman in charge of<br />
the Rock-and-Roll Session, who was a young Australian, spoke in<br />
a rich Texas accent. ( Laughter) This apparently is de riguour.<br />
Here were all these young gentlemen, and these young<br />
women, curiously garbed, they were flourishing around there. I<br />
was fascinated to see this because I'm an old follow, T wanted<br />
to know what these frightful performances that excite people's<br />
minds might be. I've never seen a collection of people so<br />
utterly bored! ( Laughter) So miserably unhappy. But at any<br />
rate, as one of the people with me said, it's good exerciseo<br />
( Laughter) Now, that is all I know about Rock-and-Roll; that '. s<br />
the only time I ever saw it. I never want to see it again until<br />
the final shadows are gathering around me, when I might feel that<br />
it induced the necessary atmosphere. Now that is all I have to<br />
say about that. I'm not allowed to be political; I'm not allowed to<br />
have an argument with the Chairman of the Broadcasting Commission<br />
I have plenty, but we conduct them in private, with a smile on<br />
our faces and clenched teeth. ( Laughter)<br />
Nor, Sir, am I surprised to be told that this is a nonpolitical<br />
occasion. If it hadn't been I don't think I would have<br />
been here I have enough of that as it is, in other places. But<br />
I well remember Sir Robert Garran talking to no about the idea of<br />
this Club; and I well remember telling him that I thought it was<br />
a magnificent idea. I think it is.<br />
I'm very glad to realise looking around, seeing what<br />
goes on, seeing what we are given o eat, seeing what we are<br />
given to drink, that you have been able to enlist the aid of a<br />
few tycoons like Dave Blacklock ( Laughter). This is a very,<br />
very useful thing, Dave.<br />
But of course it is non-political, The whole this<br />
matter as it was put to me originally by the grand old man<br />
himself was that some place ought to be established and<br />
Sydney was the obvious place in which to commence it, since<br />
Sydney is always in need of civilizing influences. ( Laughter)<br />
When a man says publicly, in effect, that he is no<br />
longer in need of civilising influences, then he is beyond<br />
redemption. That is all I want to say to you. ( Laughter)<br />
Anyhow that was the idea. I felt at once that this was<br />
a splendid idea because in some way or other we had becone </p>
<p>accustomed, and perhaps we still in Australia, to talking<br />
about " new" Australians and " old" Australians.<br />
I suppose the phrase " new Australian" was a handy,<br />
compendious sort of thing; though I do remember reading an<br />
advertisement one day in one of the newspapers by two nativeborn<br />
Australians who in some mysterious fashion were about to have<br />
a child the wife was anyhow. ( Laughter) And they advertised<br />
to see whether they could have an apartment and they said, " Two<br />
Australians, old, together with one Australian, new, would like to<br />
rent an apartment or flat", or something.<br />
But these distinctions, though t!. ey come trippingly to<br />
the tongue, these broad descriptions, have in them the seed of<br />
something unsound. This Club, I believe, was established so that<br />
all of the people who came here might come here and feel that<br />
whatever their derivation might be, they were all Australians<br />
citizens of one place, of one country, people whose common<br />
interests far outweighed any differences of background or of<br />
circumstances. And that is the whole justification for a Club of this<br />
kind. We are neither new nor old, but we hope to be good; we<br />
hope to be useful; we hope to be powerful contributors in our<br />
own fashion to this country.<br />
All I want to do is to elaborate that idea just a<br />
little because there are a few aspects of it they're commonplace,<br />
they're platitudinous, but thea as everybody knows who reads<br />
about me, I'm a master of the platitudes. ( Laughter) They are<br />
commonplace. But like most commonplace truths, they are<br />
occasionally neglected.<br />
Now first of all, politically. Let me make a nonpolitical<br />
remark, a non-Party remark about the broad political<br />
problem. One of the important things about Australia is that<br />
and this is a matter to which my friend, Mr. Calwell, who began<br />
it, and my own Government which continued it, can share some<br />
credit: I never regard this as a Party matter this country has<br />
for years and years now, since the war, had a great volume of<br />
immigration. I can assure you, speaking as one who long before the<br />
war was engaged in political affairs, that the migration we have<br />
seen into Australia, the movement of populations into Australia,<br />
in the last fifteen years, would have been utterly impossible<br />
between 1925 and 1939. Utterly impossible<br />
There would have been objections of all kinds. There<br />
would have been grumbles. It would have been said that there<br />
are people coming in here to take the bread out of our mouths.<br />
You know, all these orthodox, rather silly, arguments were<br />
current and they were prevalent in the fifteen years before the<br />
war. In the fifteen years since the war, with a remarkable<br />
degree of what night almost be regarded as unanimity, the people<br />
of Australia, employers, employees, great companies, great<br />
unions, ordinary citizens like you and nc, have all said, " T. is<br />
is the thing". The result is that we have had an increase in the<br />
population of Australia in the last fifteen years, apart<br />
altogether from natural increase of the population, which is<br />
developing this country so fast, in terms of humian beings that I<br />
doubt whether there is any other country in the world that can<br />
clain, pro rata, a similar history in that field. ( Applause) </p>
<p>0 3.<br />
I remember on one occasion speaking to Congress in<br />
Washington, and pointing out that we had a good deal in common,<br />
altering the historic period a little. Because when I was a<br />
small boy at the turn of the century everybody talked about the<br />
vast movements of people into the United States. Superior people<br />
said, " Oh, it's only a melting pot". As if there was something<br />
wrong with a molting pot? You wouldn't get too far without it.<br />
But there was the idea; that was the phrase. And the<br />
picture was of immense hoards of people moving into the United<br />
States, from some time after the Civil War until a little after<br />
the turn of the century.<br />
Our rate of intake compared to our base of population<br />
has been greater than the rate of intake of the United States<br />
over that period. Therefore the first thing to remember is that this is<br />
a very remarkable thing: that by common consent of what I will<br />
call the " indigenous inhabitants" of the country, there has been<br />
this great movement of people from European countries, from<br />
Great Britain. There is a danger in all that, only one. It is a<br />
danger that we have to avoid; and a danger which this Club<br />
partly exists to counteracti And that is that we should become<br />
or you should become, those of you who derived from other<br />
Nations members of a colony with some " separatists" element<br />
about it. So that politicians, whoever they may be, will be<br />
coming along at election time and saying, " Now we must play for<br />
the Italian vote; we must play for the Belgian vote; we must<br />
play for the French vote; we must play for the German vote".<br />
That kind of thing would be terrible. It would be<br />
terrible because it would indicate that people, having come here,<br />
had not becone merbers of this cormmunity, but were separate<br />
bodies, floating around, or even fixed, but not coalesced in any<br />
way with the community.<br />
I deplore the possibility of that kind of thing. I<br />
don't want, myself, as a politician, to have to talk to people<br />
and say to myself " Well theoe are ( Italian, German, whatever<br />
they may be) I must remember that; I must speak to them in<br />
that sense". I'm the Prime Minister of Australia and I want,<br />
whenever I talk, to talk to Australians.<br />
And if they have come from other countries, then I must<br />
say that they bear a striking resemblance to my own ancestors.<br />
It's always worth remembering that: the only indigenous<br />
inhabitants of this country were the aborigines.<br />
People like myself you take myself my grandparents<br />
on my father's side were Scots and came out from Scotland a<br />
very honorable exercise and, of course, a great enrichbint of<br />
the country. ( Laughter3 I speak with all the modesty and<br />
absence of bigotry of a Scotsman. ( Laughter) And my mother's<br />
family came from Cornwall. And there you are: the free booters<br />
of the north, and the smugglers of Cornwall. ( Laughter) ( No<br />
wonder they regard me as a harsh tas'. master).<br />
When I married my wife I thorht she was of practically<br />
pure Scots derivation. I discovered too late that she is<br />
practically Irish to the back teeth. ( Laughter)<br />
Well, there we aro, you see. These things are all a<br />
mixture. And when you talk about an Englishman ( Interjection: </p>
<p>" That's the best of the part.) Would yer mind saying that with<br />
a bit of a brogue? ( Laughtor)<br />
Then if you go back a little futher: who are the<br />
English? You know, you have to go back and back the Angles,<br />
and the Saxons and the Picts and the Scots and the Normans who<br />
conquered them. Oh, dear me. The Danes, who half-civilised<br />
them. ( Laughter) Are you a Dane, Dick? Oh<br />
The truth of the matter is that all the great races<br />
and great nations in the world have been built up upon aggregating<br />
a variety of people, and acquiring from each variety a quality<br />
which matters. This has been a great, great thing in the<br />
history of Australia.<br />
I hope that we will all resist as this Club exists to<br />
resist any idea that we should be put out into separate<br />
fractions and pretend that we are just fractions, and that we are<br />
not really parts of the whole.<br />
Now that is the only political observation I make to<br />
you. Industrially I want vou to remember what has happened<br />
in Australia. We've had the most enormous industrial developmentthat<br />
is elementary. Everybody knows about it. Without it we<br />
could not have sustained an immigration programme; and without<br />
the immigration programme we could not have sustained the<br />
industrial development.<br />
I go around a good deal, as you might suppose. And<br />
every now and then I find that I have to visit some big factory<br />
or establishment conducting some operation which I know to be of<br />
enormous importance to my country. Each time I say to the<br />
manager, " How many to use this phrase that I don't much care<br />
for " how many new Australians do you have in this factory?"<br />
The answer is always 40%, 50%, 60%. So that at the end of a<br />
year you are increasingly saying to yourself: " How would we go<br />
for these great industries, if we hadn't had this movement of<br />
population into the country?".<br />
I want you to remember that. This is an occasion of<br />
great pride. I would like all of you to say to anybody who has<br />
come to Australia recently, and who works in these great<br />
enterprises, how much it has meant to this country. Even in<br />
the most basic industries we have, expansion would have stopped<br />
like that, but for the increase in population. Therefore,<br />
industrially, this has been a magnificent thing.<br />
Then, of course, socially I think the impact is going<br />
to be remarkable. I don't want to doscend to the sordid details<br />
of the kitchen but really, what has been done to us in the last<br />
ten years has, I think, been quite magnificent. The good old<br />
simple ideas have been varied. Many thousands of Australians<br />
have begun to understand that there is more in life, more at the<br />
table, than roast mutton and potatoes.<br />
When I was a small boy, and even when I was a young man,<br />
if I could remember back as far as this, there were two kinds of<br />
cheese available in Australia one was old cheddar, and one was<br />
young cheddar. ( Laughter) And now we live in the greatest<br />
variety in the world.<br />
But these are mere gastronomic affairs. The fact is<br />
that in art, in music, in writing, in all the things that touch<br />
the human spirit, and furnish the human mind, I believe that the<br />
contribution of riches to the Australian community in the last<br />
tenyears is not yet. canrt et be fully understood, but will<br />
ultiatel tentdo crnsfo'm he continent. </p>
<p>These are marvellous things, and they will be all the<br />
more marvellous if we can constantly say to ourselves in the old<br />
song on which so many of us wore brought up: " the more we are<br />
together, the happier we'll be" l.<br />
The less we dwell on our differences, the better. But<br />
if we must dwell on them, let us understand them, let us understand<br />
why they exist, and let us, perhaps transmute them<br />
ultimately into occasions not of difference, but of unity, the<br />
new amalgamiation of ideas, a new fusing~ of literature, of<br />
background, of to use a word that I don't care for very much<br />
culture in all its forms.<br />
Now, Sir, all those rather wandering remarks presented<br />
themselves to my mind as I thought about the origin of this Club,<br />
about Sir Robert Garran, who was, himself, a groat scholar, and<br />
a thinker, and a statesman.<br />
I just add one thing to them before I conclude.<br />
The world grovs closer together. You may take th-<br />
" wings" in the morning and fly into the uttermost parts of the<br />
sea in an hour or two today. You can, thanks to the international<br />
dateline and I've experienced this quite a lot<br />
arrive in San Francisco before you leave Sydney. I know; I've<br />
proved it! It's no use the scientists confounding me. The last<br />
time I went I left at 5 o'clock from Sydney on Thursday afternoon<br />
and arrived in San Francisco at twentyfive to five on Thursday.<br />
In one sense all this has been astonishing. In<br />
another sonse it becomes almost frightening; we become so close<br />
to other countries that we feel, occasionally, that we are<br />
vulnerable to them.<br />
But in spite of this tremendous acceleration of physical<br />
neighbourhood in point of time and place in the world, more and<br />
more one sees tendencies to have a sort of isolationism, a<br />
nationalism carried too far, a feeling that, " Well, -: it the rest<br />
of the world look after itself; we'll look after ourselves".<br />
One of the great beauties of what has been happening in<br />
.! Iustralia is that the thousands, and now becoming hundreds of<br />
thousands, and growing into millions, of people who have come<br />
here from overseas, they are not isolationists, they are not<br />
I'm not talking about it in a military sense isolationists in<br />
the sense that they are not interested in the rest of the world.<br />
On the contrary, they come here, knowing by all their<br />
background and experience, that we become more and more part of<br />
the world, part of the world of thought, part of the world of<br />
literature, part cf the world of music, part of the world of<br />
painting and of sculpture. And all this will tend, in 1ustralia,<br />
to make us a m~ ore internationally miinded community.<br />
Sir, all these things I believe are good. And it is<br />
because I believe them to be g ood, because I know them to be<br />
good, and because I want then to continue, that I availed myself<br />
of your invitation to come here tonight and just say a few words<br />
about them. ( Applause) </p>
<p>6.<br />
Question: Does the Prime Minister consider that the United Nations<br />
has a greater chance of survival than the League of Nnations?<br />
Prime Minister: Well, if you all heard that question, did you?, tDo I<br />
believe that the United Nations has a groater chance of survival<br />
than the League of Nations?' I think m., y answer to that is " Yes,<br />
I do". 14 Because I think that the world has learned a good deal<br />
from the errors that occurred in relation to the League of<br />
Nations. There was a great disposition between the two wars to<br />
think that the covenant of the Peacy Treaty, the covenant of the<br />
League of Nations, the existence of the League of Nations in<br />
itself provided protection for peace-loving people against<br />
aggression. And that just wasn't true because it was a som~ ewhat<br />
vague body: it had no strength it was a debating authority<br />
it had no particular strength.<br />
And I believe my self that people leaned on it so much,<br />
particularly between 1 934 and 1939 that they misled themselves<br />
into thinking that they were save, when they were not. I saw<br />
that very clearly in Great Britain in 1936 and in. 1938.<br />
I think we have learned something from this. It is a<br />
slow and painful process; but at any rate on two or three occasions<br />
now the United Naions has actually taken some step in<br />
relation to a matter which has had some significant effectup<br />
in Korea; across in the Congo a very unsolved problem yet,<br />
but a very mauch less difficult problem than it would have been<br />
if the United Nations had stood by.<br />
!. nd then of course in the second place, never forget<br />
that the League of Nations always tried to fly on one wing<br />
because the United States of Amnerica didn't belong to it. But<br />
the United Nations has, apart from the position of China an<br />
almost universal membership. And it certainly contains the<br />
United States, which the League of Nations didn't.<br />
Therefore I think, on the whole, while one mustn't be<br />
over optimistic because there is much to be done yet, I would<br />
give the United Nations a greater chance of success, than I would<br />
have given the Leag; ue of Nations. ( Applause)<br />
Question: What is the Prime Minister's view as to the<br />
establishment of a Pacific Comm~ on Market?<br />
Prime Minister: Well, Sir, if I knew what a Pacific Commu~ on Market was I<br />
might have a better idea of answering it.<br />
If this is something that is designed to balance the<br />
European Comm-on Market then I think I ought to say to you that<br />
the European Common Market scheme was based on the idea of the<br />
Western European powers that if they could get together and<br />
establish some kind of aconomic union with, ultimately an even<br />
Customs barrier which was the same all around them, anA with<br />
internal free trade between them, then they might develop their<br />
economic strength. And I havo always thoufght that was rig ht. Because it<br />
leads to flexibility, to m.' ovement of expert people from one<br />
country in Europe to another, to access to rawq materials from </p>
<p>France, for e.: ample, which could be effoctively used in Gorraany,<br />
and from raw riatorials in Germany which might be effectively used<br />
in France. I think that this thing is well calculated to<br />
reduce costs of production, to prove the overall economic<br />
strength of Western Europe. And that, I think, is a very good<br />
thing for the world.<br />
We have a few aspects of it ourselves that attract our<br />
interest. But I needn't discuss those tonight. But by and<br />
large the European Common Market was a good conception. fand the<br />
Messina Powers are to be congratulated on it.<br />
But you can't take a scheme like that and transfer it<br />
to the Pacific. I find it very difficult to understand how you<br />
could have Australia and New Zealand and Malaya and India and<br />
East Pakistan and the Philippines, al) with one Customs barrier<br />
around them, one covering the lot, and internal free trade.<br />
Because quite frankly, if you will allow me to make a thoroughly<br />
selfish remark, -f I were to propound a scheme of that kind, I<br />
wouldn't be beaten at the next election I'd be beaten before it<br />
ever arrived. ( Applause, laughter)<br />
Question: Does the Prime Minister think th; at mankind will<br />
survive the rapid growth of world population?<br />
Prime Minister: Well, Sir, I think that that is a most ambiguous<br />
question. I suppose it is quite true in theory, that we can eat<br />
ourselves out of house and home in the world, but I think that<br />
the pessimists on this matter overlook two things.<br />
One is that the rate of increase in the population by<br />
natural increase doesn't necessarily maintain itself as<br />
standards of living rise. On the contrary' The rate of<br />
reproduction rather tends to fall as the standard of living<br />
rises. That I believe is what is now called one of the great<br />
" demographic truths".<br />
But in the second place and this is the other side of<br />
the picture how do we know how much food the world can<br />
produce? There are too many people in the world who<br />
pronounce themselves on certain matters without having considered<br />
other factors in the world picture, which are rapidly changing.<br />
We could go to a place six or seven hundred miles from<br />
here where, only relatively few years ago sheep couldn't<br />
flourish: they would dwindle, peak and pine, to use Shakespearet<br />
expression. At the end of a couple of years, ' No, the pasture<br />
was no good; they couldn't flourish on it; they couldn't<br />
fatten; they just died off'. And there wore hundreds of<br />
thousands of acres of it,<br />
Then the raeoallurgists one doesn't think of<br />
metallurgists as agriculturalists, but they are went into it<br />
and they discovered that there were certain trace elements in<br />
the soil, or that wore not in the soil, that were lacking. And<br />
whatever it was on that occasion copper or cobalt, or somethingthey<br />
said " That's the deficiency", the land is put into<br />
cultivation, a certain amount of this deficient mineral -Irilled<br />
in and now they carry two or three sheep to the acre. </p>
<p>Now that is just a trifling example. I don't believe<br />
we yet know how ruch : 2ood the world will produce; or how many<br />
animals the world will nourish. We don't know yet because<br />
science is only at the beginning of solving these problems.<br />
Does anybody know, in the case of Australia, whether<br />
from the Great Salt Lakes of the interior: we won't some day on<br />
a proper and efficient basis derive fresh water and irrigate<br />
the country? I don't know. But I believe it will be done.<br />
And so before one becomes pessimistic and envisages<br />
a future world with doubling and re-doubling populations, with so<br />
many of them dying of starvation, one should be very thankful<br />
to realise that while the Almighty gave us problems to solve,<br />
He also -tve us human minds with an almost infinite capacity for<br />
solving then. ( Applause)<br />
Question: Can the Prime Minister foresee the election of a " new"<br />
Australian, other than British, as a member of Federal Parliament,<br />
and possibly, as a Minister?<br />
Prime Minister: In the good homely Australian phrase, Sir, my answer to<br />
that is " Too right". ( Laughter, applause)<br />
Question: Could world peace be improved by better understanding and<br />
friendly atmosphere between the world loaders at Summit mec; ings<br />
by each speaking the other's language?<br />
Prime Minister: Did you hear that? The suggestion is that we would all<br />
get on very well together if we spoke each other's language,<br />
I'm not at all sure that agree with it. I'm sorry<br />
to disappoint those who are advocates of some form of<br />
international language, but I'm not at all sure that I agree with<br />
it. I have known a few . people and I have had a few<br />
responsible tasks in my life; I've had a few follows that I<br />
think I might have got to an -"-derstanding with if I hadn't<br />
understood what they were saying. ( Laughter)<br />
And as a corollary to that, let me tell you that there<br />
is a great virtue in talking, if I may select an example at<br />
random, to a Russian. And i have no Russian. There is some<br />
advantage in being able to meditate about the matter while the<br />
interpreter gives you the translation. There is a good deal to<br />
be said for that.<br />
I don't belong to the yak-a-ty yak school<br />
of negotiation you know what I mean? You see a lot of these<br />
people: one has hardly shut his mouth when they are talking the<br />
same language, before the other follow is sr-ing, " Yes, yes but<br />
look, so and so and so and so" o And then the second cuts the<br />
first off in mid-air. No, NoJ When I speak I like to be<br />
understood. But when the other fellow speaks I'm not too sure<br />
that I do. ( Laughter., applause) </p>
<p>Quetin: What impact will the election of Senator Kennedy to the<br />
Presidency of the United States have upon world affairs?<br />
Prime Minister: There is a very honest answer to be made to that<br />
don't know". I don't know because I have met Senator Kennedy and<br />
that is all. I know Nixon pretty well. Therefore everything I<br />
would have would be mere hearsay.<br />
But I think that we want to act on this assumption which<br />
I think is well-founded, that the incoming President, Senator<br />
Kennedy, is a man of parts. He has, though he is young, a<br />
pretty active experience. I have every reason to believe that he<br />
is a man of courage, of resolution and of breadth of mind. And<br />
that is not d bad equipment with which to start in discharging<br />
the greatest office in the free world. ( Applause)<br />
Question: What is considered by the Prime Minister as the best<br />
contribution Australia can make to world stability?<br />
Prime Minister: Well if I may say this, I think that the first<br />
contribution that any country can make to stability is to be<br />
stable itself. No unstable country can make a true contribution<br />
to stability in the world.<br />
And if we are to be stable in xustralia, then I don't<br />
mean that we are to be stagnant in Australia. Of course we<br />
won't be. But as we go along, if we can be stable, sensible,<br />
sane, developing, never be afraid to express our own views to<br />
the other nations of the world but never fall into the error<br />
of thinking that we are one of the greatest powers in the world<br />
an error that people occasionally do fall into that is our<br />
contribution. Good sense, wisdom, a spirit of adventure. But a<br />
sense of balance underneath it all.<br />
And one of the great tasks, internationally, o~ f any<br />
Australian leader, whether it is myself or my successor, or<br />
whoever it n-ay be, is on that basis of s to talk with<br />
modesty, but with firmness, and with frienuiness in th~ e Councils<br />
of the world. And it is surprising how, in spite of our numbers,<br />
almaost, or relatively insignificant numbers, we are listened to<br />
in the Councils of the world. I think that is a good thing.<br />
We want to go on. ( Interjection: " Don't you think that is<br />
because of you rather than of Aiustralia?") Certainly not.' It's<br />
in spite of me. ( Laughter)<br />
Question: Speaking of cricket, in the Prime Minister's opinio~<br />
do Meckiff and Rourke really " 1chuck" and would batsmen do better<br />
if they refrained from doing so?<br />
Prime Minister: Sir, I don't know. The umpires have a habit of<br />
deciding those matters and they are in the best position to<br />
judge. </p>
<p>BcL I just want to renind you I saw this story<br />
attributed the other day to my friend Jack Hobbs but it<br />
originally began in relation to Victor Trumper. He was in<br />
batting many years ago with a distinguished colleague of his, a<br />
fanous cricketer, and they were ' doing very nicely, thank you'<br />
and Vic's partner came donm the pitch for one of those nid-wicket<br />
consultations like going behind the Speaker's chair at Canberra-<br />
( Laughter) and he said " Vic, this fellow's throwing". And Vic<br />
said, " Shut up; right take hin off!" ( Laughter)<br />
, uestion: Would the Prime Minister care to say :. wat he tainks of<br />
Mr. Khrushchev?<br />
Prime Minister: Now there is a time limit on these things and therefore<br />
I can't really profess to answer this question without talking<br />
for half an hour.( Laughter) And I am not going to do that.<br />
Put I had a most interesting, and quite long, personal<br />
discussion with hin. He of course is an exhibitionist, beating<br />
the shoe on the desk I was there; I saw all this and slapping<br />
with the hand. All this is a forn of showmanship. He is an<br />
earthy character, He is not without humour. I found that<br />
rather disturbing. ( Laughter) I ventured to describe it on some<br />
occasion after Igot bac: hone as what might be called " farm yard"<br />
hunour, if you follow me.<br />
Andthere he is. I don't think that he wants a global<br />
war, a nuclear war. I think he means to nake all the ".' vance he<br />
can in the world short of waging nuclear war. I don't think t-t,<br />
he is very sensitive to what I will call the " western mind"; I<br />
don't think ho really understands it.<br />
I think he still believes that we are perhaps more<br />
easily frightened by bluster than we are. Because we are not<br />
really a bit frightened by bluster. But he hones that some of<br />
the new countries, particularly in Africa, may take hin ' au pied<br />
de la lettro' and say, " This is it. Je nust behave. We can't<br />
quarrel with that nan; he's fornidable; he's strong; he's<br />
threatening". That was his object. I don't think it succeeded. In<br />
sone ways I think that he is a man with a rough, robust<br />
intelligence that is not to be overlooked at all, that is<br />
fornidable. But whether he clearly sees the ultimate direction<br />
in which he is travelling, or whether he clearly understands the<br />
nature of the people that he is dealing with, that is an entirely<br />
different matter. A lot of these people who are dic '". ors are accustomed<br />
to believe that people are numbers, they're statistics, they are<br />
people to be moved around. In our kind of world we believe that<br />
the most indestructible element is the spirit of man that is<br />
the indestructible thing. And it is because we look at men and<br />
women as individual human beings who have a spirit which is<br />
indestructible, that we never regard them as mere statistics, or<br />
people to be ordered around. That is the great distinction.<br />
I think I can understand his point of view; I would<br />
doubt very much whether he understands mine, ( Applause) </p>
