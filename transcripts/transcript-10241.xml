TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
THE HON. JOHN HOWARD MP<br />
DOORSTOP FEDERAL SECRETARIAT, CANBERRA<br />
JRNLST: Do you regret Gabi Hollows' resignation from the Fred Hollows' Foundation?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well I don't know all of the circumstances of it. Obviously her loss to that particular<br />
body is a great shame but that was her decision. It in no way alters my view or the<br />
view of the Government that there should be different people on the CAASA board<br />
because that board needs a lot of people who are experts in safety matters and at all<br />
times we have respected and understood Ms Hollows' expertise in other areas. That<br />
was made very plain. The fact that she has resigned from the Hollows Foundation is<br />
regrettable but that really is a matter for her and she has her reasons and she will no<br />
doubt be asked about them but it doesn't in any way alter, in any way, the<br />
Government's position in relation to the board. They're two separate issues. We said<br />
we wanted a different board. We've been quite openly trying to bring about a different<br />
board. It's in the interests of air safety in Australia that that happens and that that is<br />
our position and the Minister has sought to implement Government policy and he<br />
deserves credit for doing that and credit for passionately pursuing the cause of greater<br />
safety in the Australian skies.<br />
JRNLST: You say in the interest of air safety, why doesn't the Government just double the size<br />
of the CAASA board to get the aviation experience and expertise on there?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
The most important thing is to get a board which is absolutely focused on the issue of<br />
air safety and that's what John Sharp has been trying to do for a year and there is<br />
obviously a little bit of political payback in the behaviour of the current Chairman of </p>
<p>the Board and I think that's a great pity. The former Government made an absolute<br />
mess of air safety when it was in power. They ought to get out of the way and let the<br />
new Government and the new Minister implement the authority we have from the<br />
people. Now that doesn't reflect on the other qualities of those people but they just<br />
don't have experience in this area. It's a critical area. It's not an area for playing<br />
Canberra games on. It's an area for making sensible decisions in the interests of air<br />
safety for the Australian people.<br />
ends </p>
