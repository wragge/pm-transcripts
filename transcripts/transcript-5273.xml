PRESS OFFICE TRANSCRIPT WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 27 1980<br />
DOORSTOP, PARLIAMENT HOUSE, CANBERRA PROCEDURES IN PARLIAMENT ON<br />
Tuesday, 26 February.<br />
Question: Prime Minister, would you agree with Sir Billy Snedden that<br />
yesterday's performance in Parliament was deplorable?<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
It certainly was deplorable, and I think people are entitled to be slightly<br />
surprised.. by Mr Hayden's reaction because what I had said was<br />
mild and extraordinarily accurate, I have made it plain that there i<br />
thread in the Australian Labor Party which seems to want to find<br />
excuses for the Soviet invasion-that doesn't mean to say they<br />
approve it, but it seems to want to find excuses for the Soviet<br />
invasion of Afghanista4 or if not that, at least find reasonsw1hy<br />
Australia should do nothing about it. One of the odd things<br />
I find in this whole circumstance is that Mr Hayden condemns the<br />
invasion, he then says that a boycott of the Olympic Games would<br />
be, if not the most effective, a very effective way of bringing the<br />
message home to the Soviet government and people, and then he sets<br />
about immediately, virtually, undermining the boycott that many<br />
nations are trying to achieve.<br />
Now, those statements just don't tally up. On the one hand he<br />
condemns the invasion, and the second he says a boycott would<br />
be an effective means of doing something about it, and then he<br />
immediately sets about trying to destroy the prospects of an<br />
effective boycott.<br />
On trade . matters, . on economic sanctions where we have taken<br />
some quite resolute action.-comparable with that of other countries<br />
he almost . tkies to imply that * we. i are not doirg4enough,<br />
but says we shouldn't do more, and ends up by saying we shouldn't<br />
do anything. Really, I thought what he said was. the language<br />
that comes from somebody who is very worried and very unsettled.<br />
Question: Will'. you be raising the issue of Parliamentary behaviour in the<br />
Party room today in your own joint Party room meeting?<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
It might come up we-have a short question time which is generally much<br />
better behaved than the question time in the Parliament. What had<br />
happened in this instance and what happened in the Parliament over the<br />
energy matter also I was quoting something Mr Keating had said which<br />
made it perfectly plain they were going to raise more money from their<br />
energy policy than we raise by the oil levy, more money out of oil<br />
producers.-I made some comments about that, but because the Labor<br />
Party doesn't like it, because they know they have exposed their<br />
flanks on a number of issues on a number of occasions, they try to stop<br />
the answers being given by noise, by a row in the Parliament, by the<br />
kind of larrikin, barnyard behaviour that we saw yesterday, led by the<br />
leader of the Opposition, but supported by a large number of others. / 2 </p>
<p>-2<br />
Question: Do you think the scene has been set, Prime Minister, for this sort of<br />
thing to continue, and not much progress on legislation?<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
We will make progress on legislation, don't worry about that. But,<br />
I would hope that this sort of thing would not continue because we,<br />
quite deliberately set about trying to establish the circumstances<br />
where there could be a bi-partisan approach to the major international<br />
matters that are of concern to, I think, all Australians.<br />
Bu t that approach, if it is to work, puts certain obligations,<br />
responsibilities, on the Opposition, and on the leader of the<br />
Opposition himself. Those obligations would be ones which<br />
plainly do lend a degree of support to what the Government<br />
has done instead of trying to undercut that support, trying to<br />
undercut the policies that we have pursued, whatever his motives<br />
might be.<br />
Qu~ estion:<br />
Prime Minister, on something I know that you do feel is of fundamental<br />
importance to Australians, and that is the question of interest rates<br />
for home-loans. Do you think the Government can hold the line or that<br />
you will be forced, as newspapers are saying this morning, to put up<br />
Australian sayings bond rates?<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
I don't want to add -to anything that the Treasurer has said on this<br />
issue,.. but let me only say that against the background of the interest<br />
rates that have applied in the United Kingdom 16-17 percent, even<br />
higher, 15-I_ percent in the United States the Australian economy<br />
up to this point stood up to it with remarkable strength, and it has<br />
done that because of a perception of this Government's economic<br />
-policies, because of the strength of the balance of payments, because.<br />
our rate of inflation has been lowerthan that of Britain and the<br />
United States, but if there is a very substantial differential in<br />
interest rates between those two major countries and a country such<br />
as Australia,. it is inevitable that there will be some implications'<br />
for us, and I think really that that is what you have been seeing<br />
for the last week or so. But I can. t add any more to that at the moment.<br />
Question: But do you think our strength is still there?<br />
Prime Minister:-<br />
The strength of the . economy is still there, but let me make the<br />
point again against the background of the capacity of capital<br />
to move between nations, against the background of tae kind of interest,<br />
rates that have been present in the United States and the United<br />
Kingdom for a very long while, it is not possible for the Australian<br />
economy not to feel some impact, some effect, and that I think, is<br />
what has been happening over the last week or so.<br />
Question: Would you expect this to hit home buyers? </p>
<p>-3<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
I don't want to say anymore about this at the moment.<br />
Question: In relation to question time yesterday, what do you have to say<br />
to the suggestion that you weren't quoting Mr Keating in full?<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
Well, to quote him in full means to quote a whole article. I am<br />
perfectly happy to have that whole article tabled in the Parliament<br />
or incorporated in Hansard where it will show quite plainly exactly<br />
what Mr Keating said, and he was saying that AfghanistaD was no<br />
business of ours, who would want Pakistan, who would want Aghanistan<br />
or whatever it might have been, indicating that he had no concern<br />
for the issue whatever., I. just don't believe that that is good<br />
enough. It is very much reminiscient of the kind of remarks that<br />
Neville Chamerlain made in relation to Czechoslovakia in 1938, and<br />
I have said on many occasions that in these vastly important issues,<br />
as I understand President Carter's actions, as I understand the<br />
joint declaration from France and Germany, the statement of the<br />
British Prime Minister they are all trying to establish the<br />
circumstan ce-in which, in the 1980s, the world does not go down<br />
the tragic and disastrous path that'it pursued in the latter<br />
part of the 1930s.<br />
The tragedy of this . present circumstance is that since Mr Hayden<br />
believes he has got to make every issue a political issue, since<br />
he believes that there is no issue, , virtually, on which he can<br />
support the Government, and that seems to be the way he reacts,<br />
he therefore puts himself in an equivocal ambivalent and very<br />
difficult position over the Afghanistan issue.<br />
Question: On the question of Afghanistan, since your meetings with President Carte<br />
the lack, or the activity in the Indian Ocean the American defence<br />
activity has been confined to fleet units sailing and having itself<br />
photographed. In . fact, what is the latest assessment? What is<br />
happening in both. Afghanistan with the Soviet Union and Western<br />
defence in the Indian Ocean?<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
I don't think I can tell you what is happening in Afghanistan much more<br />
than you have seen over the news reports. There . has obviously been<br />
a very unsettled circumstance in Kabul, there is obviously enormous<br />
opposition, not only from the. alleged rebels who are fighting against<br />
the Soviet army, but from the people of Afghanistan itself who have<br />
been independent, fiercely proud for centuries, wanting to do it their<br />
way and they ought to be allowed that privilege and that right as an<br />
independent people. There are, as you know, estimates which vary<br />
from between 75,000 and 90,000 Soviet troops in the area. There have<br />
been some reports that there have been more troops starting to move<br />
towards Afghanistan and I wouldn't be at all surprised in that<br />
because I think that if they are going to stop the discontent and the<br />
opposition, and at the same time remain in Afghanistan, they are going<br />
to, need double the number of troops that they have got there now,<br />
if they are really going to suppress the freedom and independence of<br />
spirit of the people of Afghanistan. In the Indian Ocean, in the </p>
<p>-4<br />
Prime Minister:( cont.<br />
in. the northwest Indian Ocean, the United States has placed much,<br />
much greater naval and maritime capacity and<br />
their forces there now are really quite formidable.<br />
Question: . the wool dispute. Can you indicate what your position would be if<br />
the growers decided to take action<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
I have got nothing to add to the joint statement that Mr Nixon and<br />
some growers put out yesterday. I would only say that the intention<br />
there was to invite the brokers-and other parties to a meeting which<br />
I would hope would be held today which could work ' out a strategy<br />
for handling this particular dispute. It is a disastrous one, it is<br />
a. serious one and one that does challenge the arbitration system.<br />
I think the.. growers are very determined and the Government is, but<br />
since there are discussions in progress I haven't really got anything<br />
specific to add to that statement thiat was released last night.<br />
