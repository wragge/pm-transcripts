INQUIRY INTO CARE OF THE AGED AND THE INFIRM<br />
The Government has set up a committee to inquire into<br />
Federal programs for the care of the aged and the infirm.<br />
The Committee comprises:<br />
Mr Austin Holmes ( Chairman), Department<br />
of the Prime Minister and Cabinet<br />
Dr Sidney Sax, ( Hospitals and Health<br />
Services Commission) Department of Health<br />

Security<br />
Mr Neil Hyden, Department of the Treasury.<br />
The Government is concerned to meet pressing needs both<br />
effectively and efficiently. The Committee will be<br />
primarily concerned with the scope for rationalising<br />
the large number of existing Federal programs in this<br />
area. The Government has noted the view expressed in recent<br />
reports tha @ programs aimed at the aged and the infirm<br />
have been launched without reference to an overall framework<br />
or philosophy.<br />
In bringing forward its recommendations the Committee will<br />
pay close attention-to previous reports in this area; notably<br />
those by the Social Welfare Commission and the Commission<br />
of Inquiry into Poverty. The Committee will consult as<br />
appropriate with concerned organisations, community groups<br />
and individuals.<br />
The Committee's terms of reference are attached. </p>
