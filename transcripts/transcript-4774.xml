PRESS OFFICE TRANSCRIPT 14 AUGUST 1978_<br />
INTERVIEW WITH LAURIE POWER<br />
Question: Did you know about the Senator Withers' thing<br />
on January 17?<br />
Prime Minister: statement about this at the appropriate<br />
time in Parliament. The Report will be tabled and I have had<br />
very deliberate reasons for not speaking about these particular<br />
matters once they were first raised in the Royal Commission.<br />
The Royal Commission was in progress and once the Royal<br />
Commission wasn't in progress we've been waiting for the<br />
Royal Commission to report. I felt that the appropriate and<br />
proper place for me to say anything is in the Parliament<br />
when I table the Report, and I will be. It will be a very<br />
plain statement.<br />
Quuestion: Do you expect to be able to placate the Senators<br />
this afternoon?<br />
Prime Minister; Oh, I think we will have a good discussion.<br />
I hope it will be a relaxed discussion. I can understand, I<br />
think anyone can understand, people being concerned about<br />
these particular matters. I certainly know all Ministers<br />
were vastly concerned, but against the background of that<br />
Report, the Government believed it had no option but to<br />
accept it. It was a Royal Commission the Government had<br />
itself commissioned to inquire into matters that the<br />
Government believed serious enough to warrant a Royal<br />
Commission's report and Ministers in examining the Report<br />
believed that there was no basis of rejection of the Commission's<br />
findings. Those who argue that the Report ought to be rejected<br />
I can only say to them, read the Report and also look at the<br />
evidence. Question: Have you lost any support as a result of it?<br />
Prime Minister: I would think that outside there is a very<br />
widesprea u-nderstanding that the right course has been aken<br />
by the Government. I really do and I think the reaction from<br />
that is very plain. 000---</p>
