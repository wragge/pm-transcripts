PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 18B MARCH 1990<br />
1 extend to Mrs Katter and family sincere condolences from<br />
Hazel and myself.<br />
Although Bob Katter was on the other side of the political<br />
fence we had developed a warm personal relationship.<br />
He was energetic in the pursuit of his beliefs and in<br />
particular he had a deep commitment to the multiculturalism<br />
of Australia.<br />
He had a great sense of humour and those who will miss<br />
Bob Katter will be found across the whole spectrum of<br />
Australian politics.<br />
