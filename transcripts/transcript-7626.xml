TRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW WITH PETER THOMPSON, AM PROGRAM,<br />
JUNE 1989<br />
E 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
THOMPSON: Well the Prime Minister has kept closely in touch<br />
with events in China throughout the weekend and he joins us<br />
now. Good morning Prime Minister. Thanks for joining me<br />
this moning.<br />
PM: Good morning Peter.<br />
THOMPSON: What's your reaction to the massacre in China?<br />
PM: I profoundly deplore it. We had expressed earlier two<br />
points of view. one that we welcome the expressions of the<br />
move towards democracy that was spearheaded by the students<br />
and on the other hand also we welcome the restraint that had<br />
been exercised by the Chinese authorities. Now of course<br />
that's changed and we have this drastic loss of life as a<br />
result of the use of military force to supress these<br />
peaceable expressions by the students and others and I have<br />
ordered that our attitude that I've expressed should be<br />
conveyed to the Chinese authorities and I've also ordered<br />
that the HMAS Parramatta which was due to go to Shanghai in<br />
the near future should not now undertake that visit and I<br />
express the hope that good sense will prevail, that the<br />
authorities that China will understand both from our own<br />
point ' of view that this sort of repression is not consistent<br />
with the maintenance of a viable and constructive authority<br />
in China and secondly that the rest of the world will not be<br />
able to cooperate in what we've welcomed as the opening up<br />
of China if this sort of attitude is to prevail.<br />
THOMPSON: Would you consider more drastic steps, even the<br />
reviewing of diplomatic relations?<br />
PM: Well that's not an issue at this time. We take a view<br />
of hope and that is that intelligence and good sense and a<br />
sensible appraisal of, if you like, China's own self<br />
-interest will lead tmtkIe-conclusion that this sort of<br />
action is not only contrary to the recognition of human<br />
rights but as I say is also against the self interest of<br />
China. THOMPSON: How are you being kept up to date of what's<br />
happening there? </p>
<p>-2-<br />
PM: Over the weekend I have had very little sleep. I'm not<br />
saying that in any other sense other than I've wanted to<br />
keep in touch with my people late into the night and early<br />
in the morning. We have a situation where our Embassy has<br />
been working around the clock. Their information is being<br />
fed back here not only into our Department but into our<br />
assessment agencies and I have been kept constantly informed<br />
of developments. I pay tribute to our Ambassador and his<br />
staff in China. The quality of his work is not only<br />
recognised by ourselves but by a number of other countries<br />
that recognise the quality of their work.<br />
THOMPSON: No prospect of withdrawing staff at the moment<br />
from the Embassy?<br />
PM: Well we haven't gone to that point. I think it's<br />
important that we should maintain the facility and the<br />
capacity to be informed of developments there.<br />
THOMPSON: Can I turn to Iran just very briefly. Will<br />
Australia be expressing condolences at the death of<br />
Ayatollah Khomeini?<br />
PM: The Governor-General as Head of State will be conveying<br />
the appropriate message.<br />
THOMPSON: Which is what?<br />
PM: Well obviously he's the Head of State and an expression<br />
of regret at his passing will be passed through. Our<br />
concern of course is with the future and we hope that with<br />
this event we hope profoundly that firstly the processes of<br />
transition within Iran will be peaceable and secondly and<br />
most importantly as far as the future is concerned, that the<br />
new leadership in Iran will take the opportunity of this<br />
change to see that Iran becomes more completely a<br />
constructive partner in the international community of<br />
nations. THOMPSON: Do you feel pleased that this era of history<br />
under the Ayatollah's over?<br />
PM: Well I think it's churlish to talk about pleasure on<br />
the occasion of the death of anyone but I do say this, that<br />
with the death of the Ayatollah that by definition is the<br />
end of a particular era and I express the hope as I say and<br />
I repeat that the new~ ieadership will emerge peaceably and<br />
in a way which will see again, if I can put it this way,<br />
that an intelligent appraisal of the self interests of the<br />
people of Iran should lead to a fuller and more constructive<br />
cooperation with the international community of nations. </p>
