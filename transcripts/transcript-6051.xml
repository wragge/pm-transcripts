SPEECH BY THE HON R. J, HAWKE, AC., mP,<br />
PRIME MINISTER, AT THE<br />
LABOR DAY DINNER<br />
MELBOURNE 12 MARCH 1983<br />
LET ME SAY FIRST OF ALL: THIS IS NOT<br />
MY NIGHT TONIGHT BELONGS TO YOU, THE MEN AND WOMEN<br />
OF THE AUSTRALIAN LABOR MOVEMENT, WHO WORKED SO HARD.,<br />
SUFFERED SO MANY DISAPPOINTMENTS AND SETBACKS,<br />
0 AND GIVEN THE LABOR MOVEMENT YOUR LOYALTY AND DEDICATION<br />
TO BRING ABOUT THIS GREAT VICTORY,<br />
AND FOR ME, IT IS A TREMENDOUS PRIVILEGE<br />
TO BE ABLE WITHIN A DAY OF BEING SWORN IN AS<br />
PRIME MINISTER OF AUSTRALIA TO SPEAK TO YOU PERSONALLY,<br />
AND TO SAY SIMPLY BUT MOST SINCERELY: " THANK YOU",<br />
IT IS YOUR VICTORY, IT IS YOUR VINDICATION,<br />
THE YEAR SINCE THE LAST LABOR DAY DINNER<br />
HAS SEEN THE MOST REMARKABLE POLITICAL TRANSFORMATION IN<br />
THE HISTORY OF AUSTRALIA.<br />
AND IT HAS ALL HAPPENED FROM HERE FROM<br />
MELBOURNE, FROM VICTORIA,<br />
VICTORIA HAS LED THE WAY, </p>
<p>ArNr THAT TRANSFORMATION IS SYMBOLISED BY THE<br />
FACT THAT, FOR IHE F IRSI TIME IN HISTORY, THI S DINNER<br />
IS ATTENDED BY A LABOR LORD MAYOR OF MELBOURNE,<br />
A LABOR PRENIER OF VICTORIA AND A LABOR PRIME MINISTER<br />
OF AUSTRALIA, JOHN CAIN'S TREMENDOUS TRIUMPH LAST<br />
APRIL SET THE PACE.<br />
INOT ONLY BROUGHT TO AN END 27 YEARS OF*<br />
CONSERVATIVE ASCENDANCY IN THIS STATE THE JEWEL<br />
IN THE LIBERAL CROWN,<br />
IT WAS THE KNELL SOUNDING FOR THE<br />
FRASER GOVERNMENT. WITHIN A FEW MONTHS, SOUTH AUSTRALIA RETURNED<br />
LABOR UNDER JOHN BANNON,<br />
THEN THREE WEEKS AGO TONIGHT, BRIAN BURKE<br />
LED LABOR TO A SIUNNING VICTORY IN WESTERN AUSTRALIA,<br />
AND LAST SATURDAY NIGHT, IT WAS THE<br />
COUNTING IN VICTORIA WHICH RIGHT FROM THE BEGINNING,<br />
POINTED TO THE REALITY WHATEVER THE COMPUTERS AND THE<br />
PUNDITS MIGHT HAVE BEEN SAYING THE REALITY OF A<br />
MASSIVE LABOR VICTORY THROUGHOUT AUSTRALIA, </p>
<p>-3-<br />
AND NOW THE AUSTRALIAN LABOR PARTY IS IN THE<br />
EXTRAORDINARY POSITION OF FORMING GOVERNMENTS IN<br />
WESTERN AUSTRALIA, SOUTH AUSTRALIA, NEW SOUTH WALES<br />
AND VICTORIA AS WELL AS THE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT OF AUSTRALIA,<br />
NOT SINCE THE LATE FORTIES, WHEN<br />
JOHN CAIN'S FATHER THAT GREAT LABOR LEADER, THAT<br />
GREAT AUSTRALIAN FORMED HIS FIRST GOVERNMENT, HAS THERE<br />
BEEN ANY PARALLEL. BUT IN REALITY, LABOR'S POSITION IS NOW<br />
VERY DIFFERENT. WE CAN NOW SEE THAT BY THE LATE FORTIES,<br />
LABOR WAS ABOUT TO ENTER A LONG PERIOD OF DECLINE AND<br />
DIVISION. By CONTRAST IN .1983, THE LABOR GOVERNMIENTS<br />
ARE FRESH AND VIGOROUS IN VICTORIA, SOUTH AUSTRALIA<br />
AND WESTERN AUSTRALIA OR, AS IN NEW SOUTH WALES,<br />
ROCK SOLID, STABLE, AND SUCCESSFUL.<br />
o AND INQUE ENSLAND, THERE IS EVERY SIGN<br />
OF A GREAT LABOR RESURGENCE, WITH THE POSSIBILITY OF<br />
OUR HOLDING EVERY MAINLAND STATE GOVERNMENT BY THE END<br />
OF THIS YEAR. BUT ABOVE ALL, WE ARE I BELIEVE, UNITED<br />
AS A PARTY AN4D AS A MOVEMENT AS NEVER BEFORE.<br />
AND THAT WILL BEc THE BASIS FOR OUR WORK<br />
TOWARDS NATIONAL RECONCILIATION, NATrIONAL RECOVERY,<br />
AND NATIONAL RECONSTRUCTION. 3 </p>
<p>THIS IS NO TIME FOR GLOATING OVER THE<br />
DISCOMFITURE OF OUR POLITICAL OPPONENTS, THAT HAS<br />
NEVER BEEN MY WAY.<br />
* BUT I DO BELIEVE WE ARE ENTITLED TO HAVE<br />
FROM OUR POLITICAL OPPONENTS AN ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF<br />
SOMETHING THAT THEIR POLITICAL LEADERS AND THE<br />
POWERFUL FORCES OF THE CONSERVATIVE ESTABLISHMENT<br />
BEHIND THEM HAVE FOR TOO LONG TRIED TO DENY. US,<br />
AND THAT IS THE LEGITIMACY OF LABOR AS<br />
A NORMAL AND NATURAL GOVERNMENT IN THIS STATE AND IN<br />
THIS NATIONS. IT WAS THE ATTEMPT TO DENY OUR LEGITIMACYTHE<br />
ASSUMPTION BY MEN WHO BELIEVED THEY WERE BORN TO RULE<br />
THAT THE LABOR VICTORIES OF 1972 AN4D .19714 WERE MERE<br />
ABERRATIONS ON THE PART OF THE PEOPLE OF AUSTRALIA<br />
WHICH LED TO THE EVENTS OF NOVEMBER 1975,<br />
Now, WHENEVER THEY HAVE HAD THE CHANCE AT THE<br />
BALLOT BOX, THE PEOPLE OF AUSTRALIA HAVE DECLARED<br />
OVERWHELMINGLY, NOT ONLY THEIR SUPPORT FOR LABOR,, BUT<br />
THEIR DEEP BELIEF IN THE LEGITIMACY OF THE LABOR PARTY<br />
AND THE LABOR MOVEEMENT THIS GREAT AUSTRALIAN INSTITUTION<br />
WHICH HAS A PROUD RECORD OF A CENTURY'IS SERVICE TO THIS<br />
NATION IN WAR AND PEACE.-</p>
<p>AND ONE OF THE FIRST STEPS ALONG THE PATH<br />
OF NATIONAL RECONCILIATION TO WHICH WE ARE COMMITTED<br />
WOULD BE AN ACKNOWLEDGEMENT FROM THE NEW CONSERVATIVE<br />
LEADERSHIPj THAT THEY AT LAST RECOGNISE AND ACCEPT<br />
THE LEGITIMACY OF LABOR AS THE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE<br />
HOPES AND ASPIRATIONS OF MILLIONS OF OUR FELLOW<br />
AUSTRALIANS, THERE CAN BE NO UNDERESTIMATING THE<br />
DIFFICULTIES OF THE TASK ENTRUSTED TO US BY THE<br />
AUSTRALIAN PEOPLE. AND BY I MEAN NOT ONLY THOSE OF US<br />
IN GOVERNMENT, I MEAN ALL OF US THE WHOLE LABOR<br />
PARTY, THE WHOLE LABOR MOVEMENT.<br />
THE GREAT WORK OF NATIONAL RECONCILIATION,<br />
NATIONAL RECOVERY AND NATIONAL RECONSTRUCTION, WILL CALL<br />
FOR UNITED, CO-OPERATIVE EFFORT BY ALL OF US, IF WE ARE<br />
TO FULFIL THE GREAT TRUST REPOSED IN US BY THE PEOPLE<br />
OF AUSTRALIA, AS A GOVERNMENT, WE HAVE ALREADY SET IN TRAIN<br />
THE FIRST MOVE TOWARDS THE IMPLEMENTATION OF OUR PROGRAM,<br />
WE HAVE ALREADY HONOURED THE FIRST COMMITMENT WE<br />
MADE DURING THE CAMPAIGN, ./ 6 </p>
<p>You-WILL RECALL THAT IN THE POLICY SPEECH<br />
FROM THE SYDNEY OPERA HOUSE I SAID:<br />
" WE UNDERTAKE, IMMEDIATELY ON ASSUMING OFFICE,<br />
TO CONVENE A NATIONAL ECONOMIC SUMMIT CONFERENCE,<br />
FULLY REPRESENTATIV'E OF AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRY,<br />
THE AUSTRALIAN WORKFORCE AND THE AUSTRALIAN<br />
PEOPLE THROUGH THEIR ELECTED GOVERNMENTS,<br />
ITS PURPOSE IS TO CREATE A CLIMATE FOR COMMON<br />
UNDERSTANDING OF THE SCALE AND SCOPE OF<br />
AUSTRALIA'S PRESEN4T CRISIS, TO EXPLORE THE POLICY<br />
OPTIONS, AND TO ENSURE THAT THE RELEVANT PARTIESGOVERNMENTS,<br />
BUSINESS AND THE UNIONS -CLEARLY<br />
APPRECIATE THE ROLE THAT EACH OF THEM WILL HAVE<br />
TO PLAY IN PULLING THE COUNTRY OUT OF THE<br />
PRESENT ECONOMIC CRISIS.<br />
2 YESTERDAY, IMMEDIATELY UPON BEING SWORN IN,<br />
ISENT THE LETTERS OF IN4VITATION4 TO THE PREMIERS AND TO<br />
OVER SEVENTY REPRESENTATIVES OF THE UNION MOVEMENT<br />
AND THE INDUSTRIAL, COMMERCIAL, PROFESSIONAL AND FARMING<br />
COMMUNITIES OF THIS NATION. THE CONFERENCE WILL BEGIN<br />
ON THE 11TH OF APRIL AND WILL BE HELD lN THE HOUSE OF<br />
REPRESENTATIVES IN THE NATION ' S CAPITAL. 17 </p>
<p>-7-<br />
AND IN MY LETTER OF INVITATION, I SAID THIS:<br />
" IITE NATIONAL ECONOMIC SUMMIT CONFERENCE PRESENTS<br />
US WITH A RARE, AND I BELIEVE, AN HISTORIC<br />
OPPORTUNITY TO SET A NEW COURSE FOR AuSTRALIA.<br />
I AM CON4FIDENT THAT YOU WILL WELCOME THE<br />
OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE PART IN AND CONTRIBUTE TO<br />
WHAT, I DEEPLY BELIEVE, CAN BE MADE A NEW<br />
BEGINNING. IT IS NOT NECESSARY FOR ME AT THIS<br />
63 STAGE TO STRESS THE SERIOUSNESS OF THE ECONOMIC<br />
AND SOCIAL PROBLEMS NOVI FACING AUSTRALIA.<br />
THE EMPHASIS OF THE CONFERENCE WILL BE ON PRACTICAL,<br />
SPECIFIC AND EFFECTIVE MEASURES TO MEET THOSE<br />
PROBLEMS AND TO DEVELOP PROCESSES FOR CONTINUING<br />
CONSULTATION AND CO-OPERATION. HOWEVER, I BELIEVE<br />
THE CONFERENCE WILL ALSO HAVE AN IMPORTANT<br />
SYMBOLIC PURPOSE, AS A DEMONSTRATION, To AUSTRALIA<br />
AND THE WORLD, OF OUR ABILITY TO WORK TOGETHER<br />
TO SURMOUNT OUR PRESENT PROBLEMS AND LAY FIRM<br />
FOUNDATIONS FOR A BETTER FUTURE FOR ALL OUR PEOPLE'.*<br />
AND AS I SAID BEFORE, ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT<br />
THINGS, NOT ONLY FOR THE SUCCESS OF THE CONFERE1NCE, BUT<br />
FOR ALL OUR EFFORTS TOWARDS RECOVERY WHICH WILL FLOW FROM<br />
AND FOLLOW THE CONFERENCE, WILL BE THE CAPACITY OF THE<br />
LABOR MOVEMENT ITSELF -POLITICAL LABOR, INDUSTRIAL LABOR<br />
TO WORK TOGETHER, IN CO-OPERATION WITH ALL THE OTHER SECTORS<br />
OF THE COMMUNITY,, UNTIL WE HAVE RESTORED PROSPERITY TO THIS<br />
NATION AND HEALTH TO ITS ECONOMY. </p>
<p>HERE HOME AT LAST I SPEAK TO THE MEN<br />
AND WOMEN OF THE LABOR MOVEMENT WHO HAVE GIVEN ME THE<br />
HELP AND ENCOURAGEMENT FOR EVERYTHING I HAVE BEEN ABLE<br />
TO ACHIEVE IN MY PUBLIC LIFE. YOU HAVE NEVER<br />
LET ME DOWN, BUT MUCH MORE IMPORTANT THE MOST<br />
IMPORTANT THING OF ALL I KNOW YOU WILL NOT LET THE<br />
0, PEOPLE OF AUSTRALIA DOWN,<br />
AND I END AS I BEGAN THANK YOU FOR<br />
ALL YOU HAVE DONE FOR OUR GREAT PARTY, OUR GREAT<br />
MOVEMENT, OUR GREAT NATION; AND THANK YOU FOR ALL<br />
THE HELP THAT I HAVE COMPLETE FAITH WILL BE FORTHCOMING<br />
IN THE FUTURE SERVICE OF OUR CAUSE AND OUR PEOPLE.<br />
