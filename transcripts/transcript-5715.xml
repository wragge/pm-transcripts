FOR MEDIA TUESDAY, 15 DECEMBER 1981<br />
REVIEW OF CABINET PROCEDURES<br />
Cabinet procedures will be further streamlined as a result of<br />
the recent review. In general, the Cabinet system is working<br />
well although Ministers in Australia, as in'other countries,<br />
are under intense and increasing pressures.<br />
But the Cabinet system of government serves Australia well<br />
and suits Australian principles of Parliamentary responsibility.<br />
Fundamental changes have not been shown to be necessary.<br />
Changes made following the ' last review of Cabinet procedures<br />
in 1978/ 79 in general have been shown to be working effectively.<br />
There is now to be greater emphasis on individual Ministerial<br />
responsibility within the Cabinet framework. Because of the<br />
increasing number of Cabinet papers, Ministers will be asked<br />
to settle more matters on their own responsibility or in<br />
consultation with other interested Ministers without Cabinet<br />
time being taken up.<br />
A number of procedural changes will be made in particular<br />
some tightening of guidelines for Departments to ensure<br />
adequate notice of matters comning forward and improved Cabinet<br />
papers and handling arrangements.<br />
There will be a streamlining of the preliminary handling of<br />
Budget issues., At appropriate points Cabinet will give<br />
guidance on parameters and priorities. There will be a greater<br />
emphasis on the role of the Minister f6xt Finance in the Budget:<br />
process. Against the background of the Cabinet guidance,<br />
the Minister for Finance will discuss and settle individual<br />
expenditure items with the responsible Minister in advance<br />
of the final Budget Cabinet meetings. Any matters outstanding~<br />
relating to on-going expenditure, together with new policy<br />
proposals, will be examined in mid-year by the Budget Committee<br />
which will make recommendations, to Budget Cabinet.<br />
Expenditure restraint in Commonwealth -administration -remains<br />
a priority * of the Government. All expenditure proposals will.<br />
receive the closest examination and every effort will be made<br />
to realise savings and to absorb cost increases. The<br />
Minister for Finance will be scrutinising rigorously any<br />
case put for additional appropriations in the current year.<br />
Such requests will not normally be supported unless additional<br />
estimates are essential -to meet approved salary and wage<br />
adjustments. / 2 </p>
<p>The Cabinet Committee changes proposed come as a result of<br />
practical experience. It has been shown that the dividing<br />
line between the present General Policy Committee and the<br />
Industry Policy Committee is blurred and amalgamation of<br />
these two Committees into a General Administrative Committee<br />
will give a more even workload and a more predictable<br />
program to those Ministers involved. Major industry policy<br />
decisions, as usual, will be taken in Cabinet. The<br />
membership of the General Administrative Committee will bEt:<br />
Sir Phillip Lynch<br />
Mr Nixon<br />
Senator Guilfoyle<br />
Mr Viner<br />
Senator Durack<br />
Mr Fife<br />
Mr Hunt<br />
Mr MacKellar<br />
Mr Macphee<br />
Mr Thomson<br />
Mr Newman<br />
Mr Brown<br />
Mr Moore<br />
Mr Hodgman<br />
Senator Messner<br />
Senator Baume<br />
Mr McVeigh<br />
Mr Wilson<br />
The public presentation of Government policies has been<br />
handled by the Public Information Committee. Experience<br />
shows that public presentation issues are best handled when<br />
the main policy issues are being considered. In future,<br />
discussion of public presentation questions will be taken<br />
in the relevant Cabinet or Cabinet Committee meeting and the<br />
Public Information Comnmittee will be abolished.<br />
The workload on Federal Ministers is considerable,<br />
especially when their parliamentary, electorate and<br />
community responsibilities are taken into account. The<br />
changes that are now being made should help Ministers in<br />
handling the substantial burden of ministerial office.<br />
