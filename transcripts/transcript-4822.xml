MR. FRASER COMMENTS ON UNEMPLOYMENT IN AUSTRALIA<br />
FROM WILLESEE<br />
SEPTEMBER 1978<br />
WILLESEE: Well it seems it is now official, unemployment IS going<br />
to get worse. In Federal Parliament yesterday the Minister for<br />
Employment and Industrial Relations, Tony Street, painted a gloomy<br />
picture. Today, the Leader of the Opposition Mr. Hayden called<br />
for the Prime Minister's resignation saying he had misled the<br />
Australian public over the unemployment situation.<br />
The fact is that, going back to the days of the Whitlam Government,<br />
all governments have agreed that the two problems were inflation and<br />
unemployment. Well Mr. Fraser has done a marvelous job with<br />
inflation but not with unemployment and now wewI , e told officially<br />
it's going to get worse and that's pretty surprising, coming from<br />
any government. The Prime Minister agreed today to this interview<br />
with Paul Black.<br />
PAUL BLACK: Prime Minister, it would seem that the Government<br />
has failed to come to grips with unemployment?<br />
MR. FRASER: No I don't believe so for one moment because our<br />
policies are in fact, as I believe, the only ones that will come<br />
to grips with the problem.<br />
PAUL BLACK: The situation at present is that Mr. Street says<br />
j--ot only will there not be significant improvement but things are<br />
going to get worse. </p>
<p>. Willesee,' 15/ 9/ 78<br />
MR. FRASER Well let me trace the sequence of events through.<br />
We had established the circumstance in which Australian industry<br />
was not competitive. We have to make Australian industry competitive<br />
again, we have to get this country moving forward in a proper and<br />
productive manner arid it is time that vie all recognised, Government,<br />
and I believe we do, State Governments, employers, and trade unions,<br />
that if we're to overcome the problem of unemployment we have all<br />
got a role to play in relation to it.<br />
PAUL BLACK But can you understand then, people saying, okay,<br />
he's doing all that, but nevertheless the facts are that unemployment<br />
is getting worse and therefore we think he's failed?<br />
MR. FRASER Well I think people are capable of following the<br />
facts of the argument a good deal better than that and not coming<br />
to that particular conclusion because the average Australian<br />
working man, if not a number of union leaders, know quite well that<br />
if wage rates are too high, if conditions change too much, which I<br />
puts too much of a cost on employers, that employers are going to be<br />
able to afford to employ less people.<br />
PAUL BLACK But Prime Minister, can you understand people doubting<br />
your word, as Government leader, when they see the~ possibility of<br />
half a million of their colleagues being out of work by January/ Februa<br />
FR. FRASER I believe people can understand that there were<br />
very serious situations created during the time of our predecessors.<br />
I believe that the average Australian has much, much more intelligence<br />
than very often politicians allow for and that he does understand<br />
that these matters can't be put right quickly and therefore I think<br />
he can understand what I am saying.<br />
PAUL BLACK : Does Mr. Street's statement yesterday have<br />
full Cabinet backing?<br />
MR. FRASER : Oh of course it does. We believe that Mr. Street<br />
needed to lay out the situation plainly, clearly, so that everyone<br />
can see it, so that everyone...<br />
PAUL BLACK It's official, </p>
<p>Willesee., 15/ 9/ 78<br />
MR. FRASER : Oh yes of course it is so that everyone can<br />
therefore understand what the problemi. But we also, and this I<br />
think was the real reason for it, we wanted people to understand<br />
-the part that they can play in helping to overcome it.<br />
PAUL BLACK Did you really want hint to make that sort of<br />
statement?<br />
MR. FR ASER The statement he did? Oh yes of course. And something<br />
that in fact, Tony Street and myself had discussed over a<br />
period of two, three, four months, maybe. I<br />
PAUL BLACK It's a very pessimistic outlook though isn't it?<br />
MR. FRASER Well I don't think it is pessimistic in this sense.<br />
I do feel excited about Australia's future, when I can see the<br />
position in which when what we want is people to have confidence<br />
in this country and I think sometimes Australians are too diffident<br />
I think Australians could have more confidence in their own country<br />
because of their own country's achievements and when they start<br />
-to put Australia in the same company as Germany's, well then that's<br />
respectable company, and I believe that<br />
PAUL BLACK But people are going to find that very hard to<br />
understand, to relate to the world situation aren't they, they're<br />
going to look at the situation more on an Australian level and say,<br />
Mr. Street virtually said yesterday, if you're looking for a job,<br />
forget it didn't he?<br />
MR. FRASER: Oh no I don't think so, not for a moment, because<br />
again I think that question under-estimates the responsibility and<br />
capacity to understand of the Australian people.<br />
PAUL BLACK But there are thousands of Australians who will<br />
never know the security of a permanent job?<br />
MR. FRASER: I believe that Australians, if they want to get a<br />
permanent job can go to the training programs that we have and, you<br />
know, it is not adequately understood, that there are 110,000<br />
Autralians, a very large proportion of them young Australians, in<br />
training, on job, at any one time and well over 60% of that keep </p>
<p>Willesee, 15/ 9/ 78<br />
MRZ. FRASER cont Id:<br />
their jobs at the end of the training period. These programs<br />
will be improved, they will be extended, and coupled with those<br />
opportunities and with the growing profitability of Australian<br />
industry I believe that Australians who want to work and want to<br />
look forward to the future with c. Ionfidence are going to have<br />
opportunities opened up for them.<br />
WILLESEE: Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser talking with Paul Black.<br />
Mr. Fraser made great play there of the intelligence of Australians.<br />
It's a funny thing, you know, Mr. Fraser once said that he needed<br />
three years to set the economy right, he is now saying* that<br />
Australians are intelligent enough to understand that these<br />
matters can't be put right quickly and also we remember his election<br />
promises and predictions unemployment will go down, it's gone up,<br />
arnd now the Government tells it is going to keep going up.<br />
So much for unemployment and election promises. </p>
