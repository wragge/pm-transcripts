TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
SPEECH AT THE ALP BUSINESS DINNER, WREST POINT CASINO,<br />
HOBART, 15 JUNE 1995<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
I am delighted to be in Tasmania again and I am particularly delighted to be<br />
here with Michael Field. We were just saying some nice things about him at<br />
the table. He wasn't hearing them, but we were saying nice things about him.<br />
And what we were saying was that when Tasmania was really facing a great<br />
difficulty just a few years ago with a tremendous problem in terms of its<br />
expenditures and its receipts, in short its Budget, there were very few people<br />
in the system, anywhere in this country, who could have taken that by the<br />
scruff of the neck and made the sort of changes that this State really needed<br />
to make and I think that the Tasmanian community is starting to appreciate<br />
that now.<br />
And I was Treasurer at the time and I certainly did and I can assure you that<br />
when one went over the litany of State indices, by far and away the greatest<br />
change in that period was under the leadership of Michael Field and I am<br />
delighted now that we are seeing the polls changing here and they are for<br />
one reason that is, that the Coalition Government here, the Liberal Party, is<br />
again showing that if you end up with a Government adrift, the State goes<br />
nowhere and I suppose that is best demonstrated by the fact that if you take<br />
the employment in Tasmania that is here as a consequence of the<br />
Commonwealth's programs, you take that out, in terms of, if you like, private<br />
sector employment, employment has actually shrunk in the period of the<br />
Groom Government and that is against that very big increase in employment<br />
nationally.<br />
We have had 630,000 job growth since the election of 1993. So it is an extra<br />
special trick to make it go backwards. You know you haven't just got to be<br />
mediocre to make it go backwards, you have really got to excel yourself. And<br />
that drift, you know, all process and all show but no substance and no<br />
change. </p>
<p>I mean public life is only about change. I mean Duncan ( Kerr) was very<br />
kindly paying me a compliment about change. But I do believe in change and<br />
I just think we are only here for the changes in public life because the system<br />
runs itself. I mean to be up here as a Minister saying well " here I am, I am a<br />
Minister, I have got the car and I have got the office and the title but I am not<br />
doing anything". You know what a way to live, what a way to live. But that is<br />
how some of these characters live and in the Tasmanian Government that is<br />
how they all live.<br />
So public life is about public policy and about public change and if you are<br />
not in the change business, well get out of the road and let someone more<br />
enterprising, more ambitious, more courageous have a go. That is what<br />
should happen here in Tasmania and that is what I think will happen. So I am<br />
delighted, as I say, to be here tonight with Michael and I do really look<br />
forward, sincerely, to a Tasmanian Government, under his premiership,<br />
working with the Federal Labor Government because this State deserves<br />
better than it is getting. It has got obstacles, but it has got very strengths,<br />
Tasmania, and it deserves much better than it has had.<br />
It wasn't that many years ago, 25 or 30 years ago, this State led the<br />
Commonwealth just about in most things in industry, in labour, in most<br />
things. This is not true today and there is no cause why that should be so.<br />
So I am even more convinced of the need for the Federal Government's<br />
programs to be operating here in Tasmania and we look at things Duncan<br />
mentioned a couple of those statements, Working Nation is one. Getting the<br />
long term unemployed back into work. Case managing people, getting to<br />
understand their personalities, getting their confidence, understanding their<br />
aptitudes, finding a place for them, giving them a subsidy, getting them back<br />
into structured training.<br />
These sorts of things are the things that will deal with problems of<br />
communities that don't have that natural buoyancy and strength in<br />
employment and where we owe this most particularly, of course, is to our<br />
young people and I know in parts of Tasmania here youth unemployment is<br />
very high and any community that is prepared to sacrifice the well being,<br />
prosperity and peace of mind of our young people, isn't one that has a lot of<br />
interest in its future and, therefore, I think again the things we have been able<br />
to do, and I say we the Federal Government have been able to do, are<br />
important. By the way, they are the very things that our opponents want to cut out:<br />
labour market programs, the enormous spending on TAFE, all the things that<br />
really go to the heart of communities in a position of economic disadvantage,<br />
seem to be the things they want to be rid of. But they are the things, in<br />
places such as this, in parts of this State where we need most.<br />
You know I was talking this morning to a couple of officers who were<br />
managing a couple of the Commonwealth programs, when we were looking at<br />
this Landcare project this morning, and they were talking about their </p>
<p>experiences and how successful they are in getting long term unemployed<br />
people, including young people, back into training and back into work.<br />
But nothing is ever going to take the place of entrepreneurship, of investment<br />
and the raw employment that comes with it and I think all that means turning<br />
around the sort of sense of self importance that Tasmania has, that sense of<br />
prosperity about itself, and not being fed the line by sort of conservative<br />
politicians that the State is in some way a victim of circumstances. It has got<br />
every opportunity to really I mean you look at all the innovative things that<br />
are done here, there is no reason why there can't be more of it and it doesn't<br />
need to be fed patronising lines by politicians without ideas, as though the<br />
State is in some sort of position of being, you know, victimised in the<br />
Federation or not being supported nationally. It has every opportunity and,<br />
in fact, the national Government the more it can sensibly do here, the better.<br />
So, once again as I say, I look forward to having the opportunity to work with<br />
Michael and really seeing it kick along and I thank you for joining us tonight.<br />
I have the opportunity, obviously, with you to go over more generally some of<br />
the directions that we are taking and why I think we are at a most exciting<br />
time in our history. I mean a century ago, in this decade a century ago, was a<br />
period of the greatest depression, the greatest drought and yet the greatest<br />
sense of the nation, the greatest well-spring, the welling up of Australian<br />
nationalism, of Australian endeavour, Australian identity and that went on,<br />
of course, until it was snuffed out by the First World War and I only<br />
reappeared again, briefly, in 1972. I hope it has reappeared more strongly in<br />
this decade, one century later.<br />
Because now, here we are at the foot of the fastest growing markets of the<br />
world, we have never been in that position before. Our markets were<br />
traditionally in Europe, with Britain, or in North America a long way from<br />
here. We are now with them at the foot of these very large markets in a<br />
country which is now so much more economically competitive than it used to<br />
be. Australia today is 40 per cent more competitive than it was in 1983, that is by<br />
the exchange rate, wages and inflation 40 per cent. That is a phenomenal<br />
number. Not 4, or 14: 40 per cent more competitive and, essentially, that is<br />
what is driving our exports. A decade ago we exported 13 per cent of our<br />
GDP. This year we are exporting 22 per cent and I was having a little<br />
tete-a-tete on the radio tonight with a commentator at the ABC and he was<br />
asking me about this and I said " well this year GDP is $ 500 billion. We are<br />
exporting 9 per cent of GDP more, than we were before this Government<br />
came to office. And 9 per cent of $ 500 billion is $ 45 billion." Just imagine<br />
where our National Accounts would be if we didn't have that $ 45 billion in<br />
there. We are now running a current account deficit of around $ 25 billion a year.<br />
Just imagine where we would be without that growth. But just imagine the </p>
<p>innovation that has been put there to make it happen and you can see it<br />
happening right across the country in all sorts of things and the greatest<br />
growth, of course, is in elaborately transformed manufactures. Things which<br />
have innovation about them, have creativity about them, because one of the<br />
country's great strengths, and I think our greatest strength, is our education<br />
system and it is something that this Labor Government has put its back into<br />
since 1983.<br />
In 1983, only three kids in ten completed secondary school. This year that is<br />
over eight in ten, which is a revolution really in education. We are streaming<br />
per cent of those through universities, which means we have added to the<br />
system about 18 or 20 universities of say 10,000 average campus size.<br />
In other words, the capital city universities, we have added the equivalent of<br />
18 to 20 of those to the system since 1985-86. And we have now in the One<br />
Nation program, put about $ 1.2 billion into Technical and Further Education,<br />
or vocational education, since 1992. So we are now seeking to build beside<br />
the universities a competent and mature vocational education system so that<br />
those 60 per cent who didn't go, who have never gone through and won't go<br />
through, into tertiary education can find a place for themselves in the labour<br />
market in vocational education.<br />
And it is that, essentially, which will be driving and is driving our product<br />
innovation. But it is driving it because we have got a country where we have<br />
got a better alignment of profits and wages. Where we have got a<br />
competitive exchange rate system in place. Where we have now introduced<br />
a productivity culture which is naturally producing a naturally low inflation<br />
rate. Just remember this, we had a recession in 1991-92 and we had a recession<br />
in 1981-82. At the end of the 1981 -82 recession, we came out of it with just<br />
on 11 per cent inflation. We came out of the 1991-92 recession, with 2 per<br />
cent inflation. And the reason for that is because we have now got<br />
productivity naturally occurring in the system and we have produced by low<br />
tariffs, a contestable Australian market that actually for the first time probably<br />
in our history, a really toey, competitive, contestable Australian market and<br />
that is producing natural productivity which is holding the inflation rate down.<br />
It is not being held down through a draconian monetary policy. It is not being<br />
held down through high interest rates. It is not being held down now in a<br />
recession because we have got growth running of the order of, you know, 4 to<br />
per cent. We have had it there now for three years and yet we are still<br />
producing low inflation and that is coming because we have made a<br />
breakthrough in the whole competitive structure of the country.<br />
And this is something. When I first went to Parliament, our Tory friends used<br />
to put themselves up as the sort of managers, the money managers. You<br />
know there was the Labor Party over here and there was the pin-striped suit<br />
brigade over there. But, of course, once inflation hit, they were absolutely<br />
dumb-founded and dumb-struck. </p>
<p>When double digit inflation arrived, they had no grip on wages, they had no<br />
grip on costs. Is there any wonder that the capital stock fell apart in the<br />
middle 70s and we started with a very large current account deficit. We had<br />
a current account deficit of 6 per cent of GDP in 1980, three years before this<br />
Government came to office. The debt, the nation's debt, had moved from<br />
virtually nothing to 30-odd per cent of GDP within three years of the.<br />
Government coming to office as a result of the neglect of the 70s when<br />
J W Howard was asleep at the wheel. You know giving comments, cocky<br />
little comments, on the way into Parliament House up the steps like a radio<br />
jockey every morning, commenting on his own work.<br />
But that is when it all happened. That is when, about the time, that<br />
Malcolm Fraser became Prime Minister was really when the weights were on<br />
in terms of national economic change and he and Howard threw the pass and<br />
as a consequence it was left to a Labor Government to turn Australia into a<br />
market economy.<br />
But we have turned into a market economy and produced this enormous<br />
change, including in the labour market, and let's record this fact that we have<br />
had now 26 per cent employment growth since 1983. In 1983 we had a<br />
labour market of 6 million, we have now got a labour market of just over<br />
8 million. We have had, outside the United States, the fastest rate of growth<br />
in employment of any OECD country and per year we have had five times the<br />
rate of employment growth that the Fraser/ Howard Government had in the<br />
late 70s and early 1980s and we are still keeping it up.<br />
In fact in the last year we had the biggest fall in unemployment we have ever<br />
recorded. And, as I said to you, we had 4 1/ 2 per cent employment growth,<br />
which I think is beyond any other country in the OECD, maybe the<br />
United States is in there with us. That is in employment.<br />
Household disposable income has risen by 40 per cent since 1983 and the<br />
reason for that is there is more people in households in work and that is a<br />
phenomenal change. And, of course, in the social wage if we take another<br />
measure which is probably the most accurate measure of all because,<br />
you know, we have had this debate, we have had in the last year were a<br />
couple of phoney debates. One of them was John Howard told us in his<br />
headland speech, " the Liberal Party have been battling for battlers for a<br />
week". And I said " well that's interesting, we have been battling it for a<br />
hundred years". And I am not misquoting him.<br />
But the best measure of all this is real household disposable income<br />
per head, per capita and it is the best measure. The reason it is the best<br />
measure, of course, is it includes wages, salaries, supplements, pensions<br />
and social security benefits. It includes the lot. It is adjusted for changes in<br />
the size of the population, it is after tax and it is adjusted for changes in<br />
purchasing power. So in Australia in the period 1983-94, real household<br />
disposable income per capita increased by 16 per cent real. That is a real<br />
increase 16 per cent in people's household disposable income and that, </p>
<p>I think, is the measure of how important social progress and the social wage<br />
is.<br />
And I made reference in the Parliament recently that very telling remark by<br />
the US Labour Secretary Robert Reich at an OECD conference on<br />
employment and the social wage and he said " in the United States we have<br />
had enormous employment growth and now in a period of high prosperity,<br />
high profitability, a very high profit share in the economy and quite strong<br />
economic growth, the median wages of Americans are still falling, still falling,<br />
and they have been falling continuously for 15 years." So he said " you have<br />
got this terrible choice, an American style economy which has got high<br />
employment, but low wages, or a European economy which has got high<br />
wages and low employment. What a choice," said Robert Reich.<br />
Well in this country we have come right up the middle. That is, we have got<br />
high employment growth and we have also had strong income growth and we<br />
have got a social wage underpinning it with such things as Medicare, with of<br />
course access and equity in health, in education. And in terms of payments,<br />
just let me give you an indication, I have just got a couple of interesting little<br />
numbers here. Let's take somebody.. well the social wage gives<br />
considerable assistance to families. We estimate that a family with two<br />
children is worth $ 200 a week. That is when you look at additional family<br />
payments, Medicare, the lot.<br />
Under our Government, spending on the social wage increased by 73% in<br />
real terms, or more than $ 700 per year for every man, woman and child in<br />
Australia. And what our research is showing is that this has narrowed the<br />
gap of the social wage quite considerably. This is including strong increases<br />
in the pension a single pensioner is receiving an additional $ 18 a week<br />
more than if we had kept pensions for them in line with inflation $ 18 a week<br />
more. An unemployed couple with 2 children, renting privately, under Labor<br />
this family is $ 96 better off in real terms than when we came in office. So, it's<br />
an indication I think let's take a single-income family with 2 children, and at<br />
two-thirds of average earnings about $ 25,000 a year under this<br />
Government, the disposable income of the family has increased in real terms<br />
by $ 52 per week. Their income tax has fallen their family payments have<br />
increased by $ 36 a week. Now, that's really helping battlers people who<br />
need assistance, and why I think we have got this magic mix of a strong,<br />
efficient, low inflation, high productivity economy, grafted onto an equitable<br />
social wage, and it could have only come from a Labor Government. And I<br />
think that's why I think when you see that sort of sense of you know, you<br />
can't produce good policies without good motivation, and just talking to<br />
people today about the way in which the labour market programs are helping<br />
the disadvantaged and the long-term unemployed these good things come<br />
from good aspirations, good inclinations, good feelings. And the Labor Party<br />
has traditionally had these. It's always had them, because it is of the<br />
community, and that's why, I think, only a Labor Government could actually<br />
produce this mix and advance the country, but do it fairly. And that is what I<br />
think is happening. </p>
<p>We have got people trying to misrepresent us. John Howard is running<br />
around all the time trying to talk about all these things but let me just run a<br />
couple of things past you. In the last month look at what, in the last month,<br />
the Government has done:<br />
It has delivered a Budget in surplus, and in surplus for years to come;<br />
It has established a national superannuation policy, which will at least<br />
double the retirements incomes of Australians, and create by the year<br />
2020, a pool of national savings of $ 2 trillion $ 2000 billion;<br />
We have created a new maternity allowance;<br />
We have delivered $ 158 million Justice Statement amongst other things,<br />
with family service programs, extending Legal Aid and legal services, and<br />
establishing a national women's justice strategy;<br />
We have realised a century-old Australian dream to have a single gauge<br />
railway linking the capital cities of the mainland that is, we saw the One<br />
Nation train go from Brisbane to Perth via Melbourne, for the first time in<br />
our history a week ago;<br />
We have launched a $ 25 million national Civics Education Program for<br />
our schools and communities, to tell our young people about the nature of<br />
our constitutional arrangements, and their history;<br />
And we have announced our proposal to make an Australian Australia's<br />
Head of State, and for Australia to become a republic by the year 2001.<br />
In one month. In one month a surplus Budget, a new national retirement<br />
income policy 15% of all Australian workers put away $ 2 trillion in savings<br />
by the year 2020 a maternity allowance, the Justice Statement, the One<br />
Nation railway, the Civics program and the republic in one month.<br />
Now, that's more on a month than the Tories did in the whole of their<br />
Governments. Really. And I'm saying this advisedly. I used to be there<br />
and I remember being there during the McMahon Government, and I was up<br />
playing tennis with a journalist I knew, and I said " how are you going?', and<br />
he said " oh well, it's been pretty boring", he said " you know, the Government<br />
has put out one statement in 2 weeks", I said " is that right? What was that?",<br />
and he said " to appoint someone to Repatriation Tribunal number And<br />
that was the truth. I mean, people forget the Rip Van Winkle years of the<br />
Coalition. You know, the torpor that Menzies left us in, through this period.<br />
You know, old McMahon and people like that. And then, of course, with great<br />
hope and expectation, the Fraser Government which did nothing. And yet,<br />
in one month, this has changed, and we have got, yet, the Leader of the<br />
Opposition running around saying " don't forget me". When it mattered, of<br />
course, as far as he was concerned, he forgot us he left us with double-digit </p>
<p>inflation, double-digit unemployment, the biggest Budget deficit in our history,<br />
smashed profits. You know, appalling employment forecasts he was sort of<br />
drummed out of public life out of the Treasury in 1983, and now after a<br />
Labor Government has, with energy, foresight and ambition, put this model<br />
together for Australia, and after this Government has done these things in just<br />
a month, he is saying " what about me?".<br />
And there we saw him at his best or shall we say his worst a week ago: we<br />
had the " headland" speech. What was in it? Nothing. One commentator<br />
senior commentator described it as mulch. And it was. you read through it,<br />
and it was just a collection of press statements. You know, incoherent, and it<br />
had no thread to it. The other thing is, they can't even write a decent<br />
sentence. Now I know maybe I'm old-fashioned, but I actually think writing a<br />
nice sentence down has a lot going for it. They can't even write can't even<br />
write. I mean, they are supposed to be the Tories they once had people<br />
from the great doyennes of the Bar, you know, men and women of letters.<br />
And what have we got know? Words incoherence. This is the headland<br />
statement. I mean, it was just all over and done with in a day. Waited, come,<br />
gone finished. Over. Then, a couple of days later came the republic.<br />
Now, the thing is, the thing about the republic I'll just say this about John<br />
Howard: I respect John Howard's right to be an Australian monarchist, but I<br />
do not respect his pretending for several days to be something other than<br />
a monarchist. I don't respect him blowing in the breeze. Whatever else he<br />
might be, he's supposed to be a Leader he's nominally and notionally, the<br />
Leader of the Opposition. And least of all do I respect his attempt in the last<br />
week to confuse and misrepresent the issue to cover his own indecisiveness<br />
and divisions within his own party, and those divisions, of course, are very<br />
evident here in Tasmania. Mr Howard has been talking about a " people's<br />
convention" half of it appointed by him. As if another committee, as Jeff<br />
Kennett called it, could help the process. Then you had him talking about a<br />
plebiscite he began talking about options and choices, and the only choice<br />
he didn't talk about was the one which the debate is really all about whether<br />
an Australian should be our Head of State. But here is what he said the day<br />
before yesterday I'll just read it to you: " Now, we are putting up a<br />
convention a people's convention. If a consensus comes from that, we will<br />
put it to the public for a vote for a referendum. If there is no consensus, we<br />
will also put the issue to a vote, but in those circumstances, we would have to<br />
offer people a range of choices, and we would have to say do you want this<br />
or that?". So, " do you want this, this, or this?". Well, in other words, it is<br />
down to this it's down to pretending this mind-numbing business of process,<br />
rather than the simple issue. He can only try and survive the debate -I<br />
mean, this is what this week showed that John Howard can only try and<br />
survive the debate he can't constructively engage it. He is trying to survive<br />
the debate by pretending that a referendum is a denial of choice, or that the<br />
question is more complex than it really is, or that the Government which has<br />
found support with a lot of people in the Liberal Party is up to some kind of<br />
villainy by creating the conditions in which Australians can debate, and then<br />
decide whether an Australian will be our Head of State in the 21 st Century. </p>
<p>We have got Bronwyn Bishop of course she's out there saying it's a<br />
communist dictatorship. We have got them saying that Keating wants to be<br />
President. Well, let me tell you the day that Parliament gave me a twothirds<br />
vote would be the day I knew that I had lost my political virtue. I only<br />
want two things when I retire from politics one, I want to live in an Australian<br />
republic, and two, I want a private life.<br />
So, anyway, the Government's proposal is designed to ensure that the<br />
position of President will not be filled by a politician that it is above politics,<br />
and it will be filled by people who are universally esteemed by their fellow<br />
Australians. The conclusion I draw from Mr Howard's behaviour in the last<br />
week does not really concern the republic at all the conclusion that I draw is<br />
this: I think the last week has demonstrated how sad it is that at this stage in<br />
our history, the Liberal Party has resorted to a Leader who will not lead. As<br />
one commentator put it this week " Mr Howard's leadership principle is " I'm<br />
your Leader please show me the way". " I am the Leader I will follow"."<br />
Remember this it's worth remembering that John Howard had two and a<br />
half years to prepare himself for this debate he actually prided himself on<br />
being a monarchist champion within the Coalition. This was one of the<br />
subjects he understood. When he was running around needling and knifing<br />
Downer, he was saying " I am one of the people that can understand these<br />
bigger subjects like the republic". He had two and a half years to prepare<br />
himself, but when it was announced in the Parliament on Wednesday, he was<br />
utterly unable to coherently respond within three days, his first response<br />
had dramatically changed to another response. I must say, even I was<br />
surprised by his incapacity, and it takes a lot to surprise me about John<br />
Howard's incapacity.<br />
Now, in the last week, we have had people on the Conservative side Ray<br />
groom here in Tasmania, Jeff Kennett in Victoria make decisions and say<br />
where they stand. Even poor old Tim Fischer in his own way has been clear<br />
about his position. But Howard's response has been only to erect a wall of<br />
obfuscation and meaningless process. He is throwing out some fly-paper in<br />
the hope that he will get the republic to stick. Which is, by the way, what<br />
every constitutional convention and we have had many over the years has<br />
managed to do they are uniformly expensive and unproductive. Now, Mr<br />
Howard was saying that he doesn't want the republic to be the main issue of<br />
Australia's political debate. Well, it's not the only issue I agree with him.<br />
But, how does he face up to the fact that in a month, the Government has<br />
produced these changes, as I have mentioned to you the surplus Budget,<br />
the big national superannuation scheme? Imagine them, the Liberals, having<br />
the wit or the courage to get every Australian person to put 15% of their<br />
income away as savings? Or to link the country up with a national rail<br />
system, or to launch te Civics Education program, or to indeed, launch the<br />
republic? So, this is the thing the Government has that vitality about it, and it has the<br />
bigger view. And let's just take that view in that month the one thing I didn't </p>
<p>mention was the visit I had to Japan, and the very successful meetings I had<br />
with the Government of Japan, and the statement I came away with endorsing<br />
the relationship between Australia and Japan, with the government of Japan<br />
saying that Australia was an indispensable regional partner of Japan this is<br />
the second largest economy in the world, and our largest major trading<br />
partner. We developed these bilateral linkages. At the same time, we are<br />
developing the multi-lateral ones, like APEC. And part of that conversation in<br />
Japan was about the value of APEC. I saw the Chinese Vice Premier in<br />
Sydney yesterday, also talking about the value of APEC keeping the United<br />
States strategically engaged in Asia, opening up markets around the Asia-<br />
Pacific rim these and other things have come from the Labor Government.<br />
So, not only developing the structures at home, developing them abroad.<br />
Could you imagine I mean Gareth and I are working on these issues could<br />
you imagine Alexander Downer working on APEC? ( No. No.) He's telling us<br />
to send a gun-boat to Mururoa. I'm sure he still has battleships in the bathtub<br />
with him, to sort of, create his own view of the world, you know. He would<br />
have the Repulse or the Renown floating past his toe, King George V just<br />
going over the ankles.<br />
But, the thing is the truth is they faced up to any of it the big economic<br />
model, with the graft of the big social wage, or any or the big social<br />
outreaches be it participation in education or in health or the big foreign<br />
policy gestures of the Government in APEC, or in chemical weapons, or in<br />
Cambodia or in the big bilateral relationship with Indonesia or Japan they<br />
can't get near the Government. And you can see that in the headland<br />
speech. It came to nothing. It was his big moment, and what was it? A<br />
complete fizzer. two nights later, the republic a bigger fizzer. So, this is<br />
why we believe that the Labor Party it listens, it is of the community, it<br />
understands community sentiment. But it has also got invention, and<br />
creativity, and imagination the Labor Party has got that one ingredient the<br />
Coalition has never had imagining something something better, and going<br />
after it. and the other thing is, we have got also belief in Australia, belief in<br />
Australians, and the notion that we believe that we will never be never truly<br />
represent ourselves, or adequately express that which we have become,<br />
unless one of us is our Head of State. Now, these are all things which are<br />
the mark of a Party with imagination and with a vista about what Australia is.<br />
And including, those big social questions, like reconciliation with our<br />
indigenes, a greater role for women in our society, improving the status and<br />
the participation of our women John Howard said we were falling prey to the<br />
special interest groups the environmentalists, Aborigines and women. Well,<br />
if they are special interest groups, if we don't respond to them, what sort of<br />
Party would we be? That's why we are going to keep this growth sustainable:<br />
you can see it now, 3 3/ 4% GDP growth, with modest inflation we are about<br />
to put another Accord together with the ACTU to guarantee wage restraint<br />
over the next 3 years, and good inflation outcomes. We are going to<br />
continue with our education system adding to that program of innovation to<br />
our exports, we are going to continue to build those relationships outside of </p>
<p>11<br />
Australia, and we want to do it holding our head up as Australians. All that is<br />
a formula John Howard can't match.<br />
And that's one of the reasons I will be working with Michael Field as Prime<br />
Minister and Premier after the next election ( hear hear) ours and his, to see<br />
the great craft of the Labor Party working again fully here in the state of<br />
Tasmania as a full partner in the federation of this great country. Thank you.<br />
ends. </p>
