<p>LIEBMANN:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, good morning to you.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Good morning, Steve.</p>
<p>LIEBMANN:</p>
<p>I'll get you to get to the sooner rather than later election</p>
<p>   prospect much later, but can I begin by asking you whether this</p>
<p>   is it, is the package now cast in stone or are you prepared to negotiate</p>
<p>   with the package's critics and lobbyists?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, Steve, we have already said that there is a mechanism in</p>
<p>   relation to some of the fine detail where we did listen to what</p>
<p>   people have got to say and try and assimilate their points of view.</p>
<p>   But the thrust of the package and the main elements of the package</p>
<p>   took months to put together and we're not going to, suddenly</p>
<p>   over the next few days, say, oh no, we're going to alter that</p>
<p>   and we're going to put it to that. It is a very carefully put</p>
<p>   together package. The most important thing I want to say about it</p>
<p>   is that it is good for Australia's future. That is the most</p>
<p>   important thing about it. And it's fair to individual Australians</p>
<p>   but, most importantly, it will give us a stronger economy, make</p>
<p>   us a better country, give us greater growth and generate more jobs</p>
<p>   and that's its great appeal to me.</p>
<p>LIEBMANN:</p>
<p>Okay, so, essentially though, no backflips, it's a case, by</p>
<p>   and large, of now you have it, take it or leave it.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, it's not take it or leave. I mean, I don't mean</p>
<p>   to say to the Australian people, you know, you've got to have</p>
<p>   this because I say so. It's not a question of that at all.</p>
<p>   We have put together a total plan and we're asking the Australian</p>
<p>   people to listen to it. We're going to explain it and we ask</p>
<p>   them, at an appropriate time, along with other things, to support</p>
<p>   it. But the primary goal I have over the weeks ahead is to explain</p>
<p>   this plan to the Australian people, to answer their questions, to</p>
<p>   point out where I think the criticism is wrong and, of course, to</p>
<p>   point out how it will benefit them and benefit their country.</p>
<p>LIEBMANN:</p>
<p>All right. The reason I asked that question, though, was because</p>
<p>   last night the Democrats, Meg Lees said that the Democrats are still</p>
<p>   in the game but they want to negotiate with you and they want to</p>
<p>   push you to convince you that you should abolish the GST on food.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, we've considered that and the situation is that once</p>
<p>   you start leaving big items like food out, you go back to the problem</p>
<p>   of the wholesale sales tax. And the reason that you have rates of</p>
<p>   22 per cent on family cars at the moment is that you don't</p>
<p>   have it on a whole lot of other things and therefore you've</p>
<p>   got to have very high rates on the things that do attract tax. And</p>
<p>   the simplicity of a broadly based GST is that you can have a lower</p>
<p>   rate if you have a broader base. And the way to look after low income</p>
<p>   people with food is to compensate them, to give them good tax cuts,</p>
<p>   to increase the pension by more than the cost of living increased</p>
<p>   from the tax changes. That is how you help the people. And I'm</p>
<p>   encouraged by the reaction of many people in the welfare sector.</p>
<p>   I was encouraged by some of the comments made on behalf of the Salvation</p>
<p>   Army. I was encouraged by, I thought, a very balanced response from</p>
<p>   ACOSS, there are bits of it they don't like it but there are</p>
<p>   other bits that attract them. I think the response of the welfare</p>
<p>   sector so far has been very encouraging because this is a fair package.</p>
<p>   I mean, we have laboured long and hard and caringly to make certain</p>
<p>   that the low income people are protected.</p>
<p>LIEBMANN:</p>
<p>And yet ACOSS this morning is sort of reserving its final judgment</p>
<p>   on the package and it's saying  and so are other commentators</p>
<p>    that low income earners and pensioners could end up the losers</p>
<p>   in this, that their earnings and their spending is substantially</p>
<p>   skewed towards food and clothing and they're worried about</p>
<p>   that buffer.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, Steve, I can understand people taking time to have a look</p>
<p>   at it. And the fact that ACOSS has reserved its position is good</p>
<p>   news, as far as I am concerned, because a year ago they wouldn't</p>
<p>   have reserved their position. A year ago they just would have flatly</p>
<p>   rejected it. Now, I think ACOSS has played a very constructive part</p>
<p>   in this. I can say to them and to others who are concerned about</p>
<p>   low income earners, we're not just compensating them for the</p>
<p>   price effect, we're adding, in relation to pensioners, 1.5</p>
<p>   per cent, guaranteed buffer over and above the price effects of</p>
<p>   these changes.</p>
<p>LIEBMANN:</p>
<p>Michael Raper told Tracey earlier this morning on the programme</p>
<p>   that ACOSS believes that if you closed all the loopholes, all the</p>
<p>   minimisation loopholes, the revenue from that would enable you to</p>
<p>   abolish the GST on food.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, Steve, part of the problem with this sort of discussion is</p>
<p>   that one man's loophole is another man's investment incentive.</p>
<p>   And there are a lot of people who believe that if, for example,</p>
<p>   you got rid of negative gearing you would destroy the rental market</p>
<p>   in Sydney and you would drive up rents to an unacceptably high level</p>
<p>   for the poor because nobody would invest in rental property. So</p>
<p>   you've got to be very careful that, as I say, one man's</p>
<p>   loophole is another man's investment incentive.</p>
<p>LIEBMANN:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, earlier this morning you hit the road to sell the</p>
<p>   package. Before it was unveiled yesterday 47 per cent of voters</p>
<p>   opposed a GST, 46 per cent felt it was bad for Australia, 65 per</p>
<p>   cent feared that they'd end up paying more. Can you change</p>
<p>   their minds?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, the polls have been a bit wishy-washy on this issue. I don't</p>
<p>   believe that people are permanently against a GST, unless you see</p>
<p>   it as a GST on its own. I mean, I'm not in favour of a GST</p>
<p>   on its own. I'm in favour of a whole approach, a new plan,</p>
<p>   a new way of doing it, and that's what we've produced.</p>
<p>   And we'll be asking people, not to say whether they're</p>
<p>   for or against a GST, we'll be asking people to support our</p>
<p>   total plan. And that includes private health insurance, getting</p>
<p>   a new tax subsidy, it includes the personal tax cuts, it includes</p>
<p>   the huge reduction in fuel costs in the bush, it includes the $4.5</p>
<p>   billion of costs taken off our exporters which will generate jobs</p>
<p>   and more export income. You've got to look at the whole plan,</p>
<p>   not just the GST. That is a part of it, an important part of it,</p>
<p>   but it's only part of it.</p>
<p>LIEBMANN:</p>
<p>All right, before the package was unveiled yesterday  and</p>
<p>   I know you think I'm dwelling on the GST  but a lot of</p>
<p>   people were worried, 10 per cent now, what's it going to be</p>
<p>   three, four, five years down the track. And you've unveiled,</p>
<p>   as part of the package, this mechanism to cap the GST at 10 per</p>
<p>   cent. New South Wales Treasurer, Michael Egan, says a 10 per cent</p>
<p>   GST is going to slug the average family of four $6,000 a year, and</p>
<p>   he goes further and says it might be 10 per cent now, or when it</p>
<p>   comes in in 2000, but it will just keep going up and up and up.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, Mr Egan, better than anybody should know how difficult it</p>
<p>   is to get an agreement between all of the six States of Australia</p>
<p>   on anything, let alone with the Federal Government and the two Territorys.</p>
<p>   We have got a lock in mechanism which says the rate can't go</p>
<p>   up unless every State government, the Federal Government and both</p>
<p>   Houses of the Federal Parliament agree. Now, presumably if this</p>
<p>   comes in, Mr Egan is not saying that he's going to favour an</p>
<p>   increase in the rate, is he?</p>
<p>LIEBMANN:</p>
<p>I'm not sure, you'd have to ask him.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, he's implying that by what he said.</p>
<p>LIEBMANN:</p>
<p>Just on that mechanism and I know it might strike you as being</p>
<p>   a minor point, but some people have suggested there is no mechanism</p>
<p>   to lock in the mechanism, if you know what I mean.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, what they're saying is that the mechanism is under an</p>
<p>   act of the Federal Parliament, yes. But you know as well as I do</p>
<p>   that if this plan is introduced and passed into law, but no government</p>
<p>   in the future, certainly no government of our persuasion is going</p>
<p>   to want to increase it and you've also got the very strong</p>
<p>   likelihood of the Senate not wanting to change, and once it gets</p>
<p>   embedded there, the chances of it disappearing are absolutely zilch.</p>
<p>LIEBMANN:</p>
<p>The bottom line to all of this is surely, the question, whether</p>
<p>   the voters believe you, the Treasurer, your Government, whether</p>
<p>   they trust you all. Could it be they might end up saying, look,</p>
<p>   this is simply too good to be true?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, Steve, that is something that ultimately we'll find</p>
<p>   out and I will accept the judgement of the Australian people whenever</p>
<p>   it is delivered. In the meantime, I'm going to go all around</p>
<p>   the country and pour myself into explaining this plan because I</p>
<p>   believe in here that it is good for our country and that is why</p>
<p>   we're doing it. People are not foolish, they do understand</p>
<p>   the present tax system is broken down. It does need changing, it</p>
<p>   is unfair. And we're putting forward a comprehensive plan.</p>
<p>   It's not just a grab bag of ideas, it's an integrated</p>
<p>   plan. It looks after poor. It gives incentive to middle income earners.</p>
<p>   You can now go from $20,000 to $50,000 in income without going into</p>
<p>   a higher tax bracket and that's 60 to 70 per cent of the entire</p>
<p>   Australian community. It does have a lot of incentive for middle</p>
<p>   income earners. It's very good for country people. And it's</p>
<p>   very good, overall, for the country because it makes our exports</p>
<p>   cheaper and it makes our business costs cheaper and, therefore,</p>
<p>   there's more resources for business to employ people. Now,</p>
<p>   that is a message that I will take to the four corners of this country</p>
<p>   over the weeks and months ahead. Now, if at the end of that the</p>
<p>   Australian people believe it's good for Australia, they support</p>
<p>   it, if they don't, they won't, and I will accept their</p>
<p>   judgement because I have great confidence, total confidence in their</p>
<p>   commonsense.</p>
<p>LIEBMANN:</p>
<p>Do you have total confidence, though, in the surplus because that</p>
<p>   is also a big gamble, that the tax cuts are based on future surpluses</p>
<p>   and given forecasts about the state of the world economy, the Asia</p>
<p>   meltdown, are the tax cuts and the benefits going to be sustainable</p>
<p>   when we get to 2000?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, they are going to be sustainable because there is still plenty</p>
<p>   of surplus left after the contribution being made to this plan.</p>
<p>   And it's very interesting that people should now be saying,</p>
<p>   talking about the surplus, that the cry until now, particularly</p>
<p>   from the Labor Party, is that the surplus has been too big. I mean,</p>
<p>   it would be interesting now if Mr Beazley and Mr Evans turn around</p>
<p>   and say, oh, the surplus is in danger. For the last couple of years</p>
<p>   they've been saying that we've gone too hard to get into</p>
<p>   surplus, that we've done it too quickly, we've been too</p>
<p>   tough and we've accumulated too big a surplus. Now they say,</p>
<p>   oh, careful it's risk. I mean, they should make up their mind.</p>
<p>   We've got it right. We're taking some out of the surplus.</p>
<p>   One of the reasons why we can afford these personal tax cuts is</p>
<p>   that as well as getting money from the surplus, the GST itself produces</p>
<p>   a dividend out of the black economy. There's $3 billion there</p>
<p>   that you can't get out of the black economy without a GST.</p>
<p>   So when you, once again, put it all together as an integrated plan,</p>
<p>   you see the logic of it and you see how the one bit depends upon</p>
<p>   the other. And it's not a question of putting and taking and</p>
<p>   saying I'll take that bit, I'll take the tax cut but I</p>
<p>   won't take that bit over there, you can't do that.</p>
<p>[COMMERCIAL BREAK]</p>
<p>LIEBMANN:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, just on the general question of income taxes, they</p>
<p>   could rise between now and the year 2000 or, indeed, after, could</p>
<p>   they not? I mean, what I'm getting at is...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, they won't under us.</p>
<p>LIEBMANN:</p>
<p>But the...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, they won't under us. I mean, of course they won't.</p>
<p>   I mean, we've been through two and a half years of turning</p>
<p>   a budget deficit of $10.5 billion into a surplus of $2.7 billion</p>
<p>   and we've done that without increasing any taxes. </p>
<p>LIEBMANN:</p>
<p>And you...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, if we've done it against that background, if we've</p>
<p>   been able to avoid tax rises, why on earth would they occur under</p>
<p>   us in the future? If there were a change of government, they will</p>
<p>   go up, but not under us.</p>
<p>LIEBMANN:</p>
<p>And you couldn't foresee circumstances under which, under</p>
<p>   you, as you say, you would have to go to the people and say, look,</p>
<p>   when we announced the tax reform package, these were the exemptions</p>
<p>   but we may have to exempt...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Steve, I don't foresee those circumstances. This is a very</p>
<p>   careful package. It does have generous personal tax cuts, so it</p>
<p>   should, because we're asking the Australian people to accept</p>
<p>   a fundamental change. But it's very carefully balanced. I mean,</p>
<p>   the people who are going to offer you the big tax cuts, the magic</p>
<p>   pudding, are the Labor Party. They're going to do what Mr Keating</p>
<p>   did in 1993. They're going to say, we can give you a tax cut</p>
<p>   without a GST.</p>
<p>LIEBMANN:</p>
<p>Well, in fact, that's what Opposition Leader Beazley is saying</p>
<p>   this morning.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Of course, that's right.</p>
<p>LIEBMANN:</p>
<p>He's saying he can beat you hollow on tax, offer bigger tax</p>
<p>   cuts and a fairer system without relying on a GST.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>But Mr Keating and Mr Beazley did that in 1993. And when they won</p>
<p>   the election they took away the tax cuts and they increased the</p>
<p>   wholesale sales tax and without compensation. And the increase in</p>
<p>   the wholesale sales tax in 1993 after that election was almost exactly</p>
<p>   the same impact as the changes that we announced yesterday. There</p>
<p>   were no income tax cuts. There was no social security compensation.</p>
<p>   There was no tax deduction for private health insurance. So, I would</p>
<p>   say to the Australian public, beware of a Beazley offering you a</p>
<p>   GST-free tax cut.</p>
<p>LIEBMANN:</p>
<p>Your most vocal critic so far appears to have been the Housing</p>
<p>   Industry Association and it is saying this morning that a GST applied</p>
<p>   to all homes after July 2000 will add more than $17,000 to the cost</p>
<p>   of a new home and destabilise the industry.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I think that's wrong and I'll tell you why it's</p>
<p>   wrong. To start with, the industry's never had it better because</p>
<p>   interest rates are at a 30-year low. And Ron Silberberg and the</p>
<p>   Housing Industry Association know that the greatest driving influence</p>
<p>   on real estate and housing is the level of interest rates and this</p>
<p>   government has cut interest rates by $300 a month for the average</p>
<p>   homebuyer. The impact of the GST on an average house is about 4.7</p>
<p>   per cent in price, not 10 per cent because a whole lot of items</p>
<p>   that now go into a new house, like baths and basins and things like</p>
<p>   that, are subject to wholesale sales tax. Now that will disappear.</p>
<p>   And, on top of that, we're going to give every new homebuyer,</p>
<p>   every first homebuyer, whether it's an old house or a new house,</p>
<p>   if it's your first house you'll get $7000 home savings</p>
<p>   grant. And that will, in our view, adequately cover the situation.</p>
<p>LIEBMANN:</p>
<p>Not in the Association's view. They're saying that $7000</p>
<p>   falls short of the mark.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, Steve, it is understandable that if you are a lobby group</p>
<p>   for a particular section and you've wanted something you will</p>
<p>   go on arguing your ambit claim. But I ask Mr Silberberg's members</p>
<p>   and the HIA's members to understand the other benefits of this.</p>
<p>   I mean, all of them are small business operators. They will all</p>
<p>   now be able to get the taxes paid on their inputs back. Their operating</p>
<p>   costs will be lower, lower than what they are at the present time</p>
<p>   because one of the virtues of a GST is that it will take about $10</p>
<p>   billion in costs through rebated input taxes off the operating cost</p>
<p>   of all businesses.</p>
<p>LIEBMANN:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, I'm playing devil's advocate in part</p>
<p>   here this morning. The New South Wales and Queensland Labor governments</p>
<p>   have criticised the package and you would probably say, well, you'd</p>
<p>   expect them to...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>But they're not serving the interests of their people.</p>
<p>LIEBMANN:</p>
<p>But what happens if Labor Premiers, Bob Carr and Peter Beattie,</p>
<p>   say, listen, we're not going to be your salesmen, we're</p>
<p>   not going to be part of this? Can they say that?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, they will do so at the peril of being repudiated by their</p>
<p>   own electorates because this plan will offer something to the States</p>
<p>   that they've asked for for generations, and that is a growth</p>
<p>   tax. We're giving them all of the proceeds of the GST and that</p>
<p>   means in the years ahead they will all have more money to spend</p>
<p>   on roads and health and education and hospitals. Now, are they going</p>
<p>   to say to the people of their States: we don't want this extra</p>
<p>   money, we're not going to provide those extra services. Over</p>
<p>   a 10-year period, from the turn of the century, this plan will give</p>
<p>   the States $25 billion more than they will get under the existing</p>
<p>   arrangements. Now, are Beattie and Carr going to say: we don't</p>
<p>   want New South Wales' and Queensland's share of that?</p>
<p>LIEBMANN:</p>
<p>But why then is Peter Beattie saying, as recently as on this programme</p>
<p>   this morning, up until now we were a low tax State, John Howard's</p>
<p>   just changed all that?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, that's just wrong. I mean, he's got to sing Federal</p>
<p>   Labor's tune. He's got to sing from the same hymn sheet</p>
<p>   until the election. Now, if we win the election  I make the</p>
<p>   prediction now, if we win the election and we have our Special Premiers'</p>
<p>   Conference, Peter Beattie and Bob Carr will go along and they say,</p>
<p>   well, we didn't like it but, you know, we have to be good Australians</p>
<p>   and we've got to accept it. They'll grab it with both</p>
<p>   hands after the election. And they need to because it is good for</p>
<p>   their States. I mean, Queensland not only gets the extra money through</p>
<p>   the Federal-State change, but that diesel fuel change, the lower</p>
<p>   fuel costs are of greater benefit to Queenslanders than any other</p>
<p>   State. Because Queensland is a big State and it's a heavily</p>
<p>   de-centralised State and, therefore, it relies more heavily on heavy</p>
<p>   road transport to bring goods from one part of the State to the</p>
<p>   other. And the benefit for Queenslanders in this change is proportionately</p>
<p>   greater because of that simple fact - Queensland's the only</p>
<p>   State in Australia where the majority of people live outside the</p>
<p>   capital city and, therefore, Queenslanders, by that definition alone,</p>
<p>   are going to get proportionately more out of this and Peter Beattie</p>
<p>   should understand it. I can't wait to get to Queensland to</p>
<p>   start campaigning for this.</p>
<p>LIEBMANN:</p>
<p>Two final quick questions. If you get re-elected, can you get this</p>
<p>   through the Senate?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, my view on that, Steve, is simply this that if the Australian</p>
<p>   people say, yes, to this at the next election, whenever it is, the</p>
<p>   opposition parties in the Senate are under a moral imperative to</p>
<p>   let it through.</p>
<p>LIEBMANN:</p>
<p>And final question, Prime Minister. What is adequate time for public</p>
<p>   discussion?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I can't put a day or a week or a month on that. No,</p>
<p>   I can't, Steve. I don't know yet. </p>
<p>LIEBMANN:</p>
<p>Are you telling me that the thought of going to the polls hasn't</p>
<p>   even entered your mind?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Oh look, the generic thought is always there, it's always</p>
<p>   there from the moment that you are elected. But I do not have a</p>
<p>   date in mind, I have not made up my mind. Obviously, like any other</p>
<p>   Prime Minister, I want to get re-elected. Of course I do, I'm</p>
<p>   not going to say to you I don't, of course I do. But I don't</p>
<p>   take the Australian public for granted. We have put forward a bold</p>
<p>   and visionary and imaginative long-term plan which is good for the</p>
<p>   country. I want to devote myself, in the time immediately ahead,</p>
<p>   to explaining it, to going around the country. Further down the</p>
<p>   track I'll think about other matters.</p>
<p>LIEBMANN:</p>
<p>You haven't made an appointment with the Governor-General,</p>
<p>   you're not thinking October 10th, 17th.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, I have not made...I mean, people have been playing games</p>
<p>   with me, inviting me to dinner parties on particular Saturdays in</p>
<p>   October and November and we're happy to accept all the invitations.</p>
<p>LIEBMANN:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, we appreciate your time this morning and thank</p>
<p>   you for joining us.</p>
