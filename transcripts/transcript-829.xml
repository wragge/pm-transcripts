    <content><![CDATA[<p>COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA.<br />SPEECH BY<br />Rt. Hon. SIR ROBERT MENZIES,<br />M. P.,<br />ON<br />PARLIAMENTARY ARRANGEMENTS.<br />[ From the " Parliamentary Debates," 15th October, 1963.]<br />Sir ROBERT MENZIES ( Kooyong-<br />Prime Minister)-by leave-Sir, at the last<br />general election in December, 1961, the<br />M'Government's majority was reduced to<br />which meant one after the election<br />of a Speaker. It is therefore not surprising<br />that the Government has, throughout<br />the life of the Parliament, been under<br />repeated pressure by the Opposition to go<br />to an early election. Indeed, Sir, when<br />the new Parliament met, a no-confidence<br />motion was submitted by the Opposition on<br />27th February, 1962, the proceedings<br />taking the form of a no-confidence amendment<br />to the motion for the adoption of the<br />Address-in-Reply to the Governor-General's<br />peech. This amendment was defeated by<br />votes to 59.<br />Mr. Bryant.-Pretty close!<br />Sir ROBERT MENZIES.-Yes, indeed.<br />j) hat is the point. I am glad you follow<br />me. On 14th August, 1962, in the Budget<br />10389/ 63. debate, the Opposition moved a motion of<br />censure in the normal way by moving,<br />" That the first item be reduced by Å“ 1<br />Had this motion been carried, the Government,<br />would, of course, have been defeated.<br />The motion was defeated by 58 votes to 56,<br />there being at that time a vacancy in the<br />Opposition-held seat of Batman. On 2nd<br />April, 1963-that is, this year-the Opposition<br />moved, " That this Government no<br />longer possesses the confidence of this<br />House".... Opposition Members.-Hear, hear!<br />Sir ROBERT MENZIES.-I am<br />delighted to hear it. This motion was<br />defeated by 59 votes to 58.<br />Mr. Armitage.-How many do you want<br />to win by?<br />Sir ROBERT MENZIES.-After the<br />election, Sir, I propose to win by eleven or<br />thirteen votes. I am indebted to my friend.<br />That was a very good question.</p>
<p>Now, to come back to the facts. The<br />motion was defeated by 59 votes to 58.<br />There was a vacancy in the Opposition-held<br />seat of Grey, but a Government member<br />was absent, unpaired, from the division.<br />On 18th April, 1963, there was yet another<br />censure motion, which was defeated by 57<br />votes to 55. On 20th August, 1963-again<br />this year-the Opposition moved an amendment<br />to the motion for the second reading<br />of the Appropriation Bill. The amendment<br />concluded with the words-and these are<br />significant words-" the House is of the<br />opinion-Mr. Calrns.-Are we to have an election<br />or not?<br />Sir ROBERT MENZIFS.-Restrain your<br />fears. The amendment concluded with the<br />words, the House is of the opinion that the<br />Government no longer possesses its confidence<br />or the confidence of the nation.<br />Opposition Members.-Hear, hear!<br />Sir ROBERT MENZIES.-It is wonderful<br />how helpful they are on all great occasions!<br />This amendment was defeated by<br />59 votes to 57, there being a vacancy in<br />East Sydney, an Opposition-held seat.<br />It will thus be seen that already, in somewhat<br />under two years, the existence of the<br />Government has been challenged no fewer<br />that five times, three times with an increasing<br />note of urgency in the last six months.<br />Mr. O'Brien.-Shocking!<br />Sir ROBERT MIENZIES.-No; it is wonderful.<br />You are easily shocked. ' You will<br />be even more shocked in a month' s time.<br />Sir, in each case it must be reasonably<br />assumed that the Opposition was<br />serious in its intentions, and that it<br />would have welcomed success. Any other<br />assumption would be unwarranted and<br />offensive. Any such success would have<br />meant the defeat of the Government and,<br />under established constitutional practice, an<br />election. Mr. Webb.-What is wrong with that?<br />Sir ROBERT MENZIES.-Would you<br />mind listening a little? It will be one of the few times when you will have to listen to<br />me. Mr. Webb.-If you are here.<br />Sir ROBERT MENZ~ IES.--Quite right.<br />You can always listen to me if I am here,<br />but not if you are not here. I repeat that<br />in each case it must be reasonably assumed<br />-and I gather that this is agreed-that<br />the Opposition was serious in its intentions,<br />and it would have welcomed success. Any<br />other assumption would be unwarranted<br />and offensive. Any such success would<br />have meant the defeat of the Government<br />and, under established constitutional<br />practice, an election.<br />The Opposition knows, as I do, that in<br />the present state of the House of Reprcsentatives,<br />the crossing of the floor by one<br />member sitting on the Government side<br />would bring about the defeat of the Government,<br />as indeed would the inadvertent or<br />voluntary abstention of two Government<br />supporters from a division. These are<br />elementary mathematics. In short, the<br />Opposition has five times sought to force<br />an election which would be one for the<br />House of Representatives alone.<br />Mr. Cross.-That is right.<br />Sir ROBERT MENZIES.-You do not<br />disagree with that, do you?<br />Mr. Cross.-Not at all.<br />Sir ROBERT MENZIES.-Of course not!<br />I have it on record now. Five tim es th'<br />Opposition tried to force an election. Do<br />not abandon your leader too quickly, my<br />dear boy. I emphasize this point because I<br />observe that it is now being said by the<br />Leader of the Opposition ( Mr. Calwell) that<br />an election for the House of Representatives<br />alone, that is, before July, 1964, would be<br />wasteful and improper.<br />Mr. Calwel.-Hear, hear!<br />Sir ROBERT MENZIES.-He says,<br />" Hear, hear! and the honorable member<br />for Brisbane ( Mr. Cross) does not agre.<br />with him! Harmony breaks out on the'<br />Opposition benches! This is indeed a<br />curious argument for the Leader of the<br />Opposition to employ, having regard to the<br />events that I have recited. Are we to<br />understand that all of his no-confidenc,<br />motions were deliberately designed to fail?</p>
<p>I would be reluctant to make any such<br />charge of political insincerity against an<br />opponent whose constant devotion to his<br />party I freely recognise. I add to this short<br />history of events that, as honorable memmers<br />have observed, in the last no-confidence<br />amendment, less than eight weeks ago, the<br />special inclusion of the words, " or the<br />confidence of the nation"' was a direct<br />demand to test the opinion of the nation<br />by a House of Representatives election.<br />Opposition Members.-Hear, hear!<br />Sir ROBERT MENZIES.-Thank you<br />very much. I subnmit that these facts<br />conclusively establish that there can be no<br />legitimate objection on the part of members<br />of the Opposition to a dissolution of the<br />House of Representatives, a dissolution<br />which they have done their best to secure<br />on five critical occasions.<br />Mr. Speaker, I will now proceed to set<br />out some additional reasons for recommending<br />that, without an actual defeat of<br />the Government, there should be a dissolution<br />of the present precariously balanced<br />House, and a-new election. There have<br />been times in history when peace seemed<br />secure and when there were no international<br />roblems of moment-<br />Mr. SPEAKER ( Hon. Sir John McLeay).<br />-Order! Honorable members will refrain<br />from interjecting.<br />Sir ROBERT MENZIES.-I am sorry,<br />ir, but I must instruct honorable members<br />) apposite. I remind them that there have<br />been times in history-does anybody deny<br />it?-when peace seemed secure; when there<br />were no international problems of moment;<br />when, in any event, there were no material<br />differences between the political parties on<br />foreign affairs; when there was stability of<br />government; and when circumstances were<br />conducive to long-range policies. The present<br />position of Australia is quite different.<br />Australia is a Commonwealth country, with<br />a significant voice in Commonwealth affairs.<br />has, apart from its vital association with<br />Jreat Britain, the United States of America,<br />f-rance, Pakistan, New Zealand, the Philippines<br />and Thailand, in the South-East Asia<br />Treaty Organization, an alliance with the<br />United States and New Zealand in Anzus.<br />,-Pursuant to these arrangements my Gornment<br />has, during the current Parliament,<br />first made an agreement with the United States for the establishment by it, on Australian<br />territory in the north-west of Western<br />Australia, of a naval radio signalling station,<br />the value and significance of which would,<br />of course, be of the greatest urgency and<br />moment in the event of a war in which the<br />United States was engaged. Indeed, without<br />its prompt and full use, the operations<br />of the United States naval forces of all kinds<br />wouild be grievously handicapped. My Government<br />believes that in any foreseeable<br />future any such war must be one of defence<br />against Communist aggression and that any<br />such aggression would put the security of<br />Australia at risk. In short, in such events<br />the United States forces would be defending<br />Australia.<br />In our contract with the United States in<br />respect of this radio installation, therefore,<br />my Government, while providing for general<br />consultation and access by Australian naval<br />forces to the signalling facilities, has not<br />required or obtained a joint control of the<br />station. Such joint control would, of<br />course, enable an Australian government<br />to veto the American use of the station<br />in peace or in war, or require an Australian<br />censorship of the messages transmitted. The<br />Opposition in Parliament has, I believe,<br />made it clear that should it come into office<br />it will re-negotiate the treaty and will insist<br />upon joint control; that is, upon a veto by<br />either party on the activities of the other.<br />Sir, the station is about to be constructed<br />at the cost of many millions of pounds by<br />the United States. It is, in my submission,<br />important that the inter-party problem in<br />Australia be resolved. In these international<br />engagements, certainly it is essential to<br />security. Secondly, we have also made a clear but<br />unilateral declaration of our attitude to the<br />new state of Malaysia. This was made by<br />me on behalf of the Government on<br />September, 1963-only the other day, in a<br />sense-in the following terms:-<br />But for the benefit of all concerned, honorable<br />members would not wish me to create or permit<br />any ambiguity-<br />Mr. Uren.--Are you happy, Jack? You<br />do not look at all happy, Jack.<br />Mr. SPEAKER.--Orderl The honorable<br />member for Reid will restrain<br />himself. Sir ROBERT MENZIES.-Of course he<br />does not like Malaysia.</p>
<p>Mr. SPEAKER.-Orderl Honorable<br />members will refrain from interjecting.<br />Sir ROBERT MENZIES.-I do not<br />mind, Sir. I have plenty of time.<br />Mr. Cross.-Time is running out.<br />Sir ROBERT MENZIES.-Yes, it is<br />running out for you, but not for me. That<br />is why I say I have plenty of time, and<br />so I repeat what honorable members opposite<br />appear to dislike-the statement I<br />made on behalf of this country in this<br />House. I begin my quotation again-<br />But for the benefit of all concerned, honorable<br />members would not wish me to create or permit<br />any ambiguity about Australia's position in relation<br />to Malaysia. I therefore, after close<br />deliberation by the Cabinet, and on its behalf,<br />inform the House that we are resolved, and have<br />so informed the Government of Malaysia, and the<br />Governments of the United Kingdom and New<br />Zealand and others concerned, that if, in the<br />circumstances that now exist, and which may continue<br />for a long time, there occurs, in relation to<br />Malaysia or any of its constituent States, armed<br />invasion or subversive activity-supported or<br />directed or inspired from outside Malaysia-we<br />shall to the best of our powers and by such<br />means as shall be agreed upon with the Government<br />of Malaysia, add our military assistance to<br />the efforts of Malaysia and the United Kingdom<br />in the defence of Malaysia's territorial integrity<br />and political independence.<br />These are words with which all honorable<br />members are familiar. Sir, this<br />declaration has attracted wide internatioiial<br />attention, and is clearly of crucial importance<br />in Australian foreign and defence<br />policy. It is most important that the<br />other nations concerned should know<br />whether it carries the clear backing of the<br />Australian people. The Opposition, speaking<br />through its leader on the same day<br />in the House of Representatives, has<br />announced a view which, while listening<br />to it, I thought reasonably helpful. But<br />a close study of the text of the speech<br />makes it clear that the Opposition's position<br />differs very materially from that of<br />the Government. It is true that the<br />Leader of the Opposition said-<br />The Labour Party supports the concept of<br />Malaysia and welcomes its creation. We believe<br />that this experiment in nationhood should be<br />given its chance, free from attack or interference<br />from other nations, to prove itself. But, Sir, he went on to say that the continued<br />presence of Australian troops in<br />Malaysia-Shall be covered by a treaty clear, open, and<br />if possible, mutual, which gives Australia an<br />effective voice in the decision of the treaty<br />powers. Mr. Don Cameron.-Is there anything<br />wrong with that?<br />Sir ROBERT MENZIES.-If you have<br />patience you will hear -what I have to say<br />about it. Whatever this may turn out to<br />mean, since any treaty involves mutuality,<br />it does not mean support for the declaration<br />made on behalf of the Government<br />by me as Prime Minister. I say this for<br />two reasons, which I will state as succinctly<br />as possible.<br />In the first place, Malaya-and this I<br />am afraid has been overlooked-was not,<br />and Malaysia is not, an alined country.<br />It is a non-alined country or, in the old<br />vocabulary a neutral country, and because<br />of that it is not a party to Seato. It has<br />been, and is, a matter of high policy for<br />Malaya and Malaysia to be regarded as a<br />nation jealous of its independence but not<br />as one having, in peace-time at any rate,<br />-mutual contractual military obligation,<br />with any other country. In this respect. j<br />Mr. Speaker, it resembles India. True,<br />Great Britain has a defence arrangement<br />with Malaysia. But this arises from the<br />fact that Great Britain was the colonial"<br />power, and that, in granting independenr 3<br />under a carefully evolved constitution,<br />found it desirable to give effective assurances<br />to the new nation that its complete<br />independence would be protected. In short.<br />the British agreement does not run counter<br />to Malaysian non-alinement, but, in effect,<br />helps in a practical way to preserve<br />Malaysian independence.<br />Australia, not having been the colonial<br />power, stands in a different position. If<br />what the Opposition wants is, as I understand<br />it, that there should be a mutual<br />-treaty of defence between Australia aj<br />Malaysia under which Malaysia becomes oui<br />ally for military purposes in advance of any<br />armed attack upon co-operating Australian<br />forces, then the answer is that such a treaty<br />would, in the absence of a revolutionar'.-<br />change in Malaysian policy, be impossible,<br />achievement.</p>
<p>. Again, what Australia does under the<br />Government's declaration is to support<br />Great Britain in the defence of Malaysia's<br />"-territorial integrity and political independence<br />This being so, we believe that disadvantage<br />would accrue to Australia if we<br />conditioned our help upon the securing of a<br />detailed treaty. , For the reasons I have<br />indicated, any such treaty could not reasonably<br />be expected to express any advance<br />iliitary obligations by Malaysia to us. This<br />being so-this is the vital question-is it<br />better for Australia to have a simple but<br />clear declaration of * intention on our part<br />which, in its very nature, preserves our own<br />judgment as to the nature, extent and disposition<br />of Australian forces to be deployed,<br />or for us deliberately to enmesh ourselves in<br />a mass of written detailed rules and regulations<br />which would limit our own freedom of<br />action while conferring upon us no actual<br />rights to secure reciprocal military obligations<br />on the part of Malaysia? In short,<br />Sir, the Government believes that the Opposition's<br />proposal is impracticable and would<br />be damaging to the complete authority of<br />the Government of Australia over its forces<br />in the event of an attack upon Malaysian<br />-security or political independence.<br />The problems which exist in our near<br />neighbourhood are too critical to admit of<br />uncertainty in our national policy. To deal<br />with -them, there should be a government<br />with an effective mandate and authority;<br />and the sooner there is one, the better for<br />all concerned.<br />There is another great issue of international<br />policy which needs to be resolved.<br />I speak about -this with some delicacy. It is<br />the declared policy of the Australian Labour<br />Party, I understand-I have not heard the<br />outside voices yet-that Australia should<br />negotiate for and Participate in a nuclearfree<br />zone south of the equator, with an<br />agreed prohibition of the accumulation or<br />deployment of nuclear weapons in that area.<br />If this came off, as honorable members no<br />Sdoubt hope it will, with Australia as a party,<br />our allies under Seato and Anzus could not,<br />except against the will of Australia, use<br />nuclear weapons in the defence of this<br />region, including Australia, even though<br />powers north of the equator created and<br />sed them.<br />Mr. Cross.-Nonsensel Sir ROBERT MENZ[ ES.-You must<br />explain it to me. The Government, though<br />it has, in line with -the unanimous opinions<br />of the Prime Ministers in conference in<br />London, refrained from establishing nuclear<br />military power -itself, would regard the<br />Opposition's policy, if it succeeded, as<br />suicidal-Mr. Pollard.-Bomb-happy Bob!<br />Sir ROBERT MENZTOES.-Now, Reggie,<br />behave yourself! The Government would<br />regard the Opposition's policy, if it succeeded,<br />as suicidal, since it would operate<br />to handicap our defending allies who possess<br />nuclear weapons while leaving Communist<br />nuclear powers, who are north of -the<br />equator, completely free to deploy and use<br />nuclear weapons'wherever -they chose. It<br />is time for this issue to be resolved by the<br />people. Opposition Members.--Hear, hear!<br />Sir ROBERT MENZIES.-I am delighted<br />to ' find such unanimity about -an election.<br />To sum up, I would say this: Since the<br />1961 election, the Government has, after the<br />election of -a Speaker, and given completely<br />normal circumstances, a majority of only<br />one in a House of 122 voting members. It<br />will, I am sure, be understood that in the<br />existing circumstances a proportion of the<br />time of myself and other Ministers has to be<br />devoted to what I may call the almost daily<br />problem of political survival, with all the<br />cumulative strains involved.<br />Mr. Pollard.-What are you here for.<br />anyhow? SIr ROBERT MENZIES.-I am here,<br />apparently, to listen to you. I'have listened<br />to you from that seat for a long time, and<br />I hope to -listen to you for a long time<br />further. However, since you are apparently<br />unaware of what is involved in office, I will<br />repeat what I have said. I do not mind. It<br />will, I am sure, be understood that in the<br />existing circumstances a proportion of the<br />time of myself and other Ministers has to be<br />devoted to what I may call ' the almost daily<br />problem of political survival, with all the<br />cumulative strains involved-and one of the<br />strains is listening to the honorable member<br />for Newcastle, who is interjecting. And,</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, -this occurs in a period of Australian<br />history in which an Australian<br />government, whatever side it comes from<br />should be able to devote the whole of its<br />energies to the international, defence,<br />economic and developmental problems of<br />the nation. These are growing and frequently<br />pressing problems of magnitude and<br />complexity. Their solution calls for close<br />and concentrated attention, undistracted by<br />the parliamentary crises-<br />Mr. Jones.-Why don't you-<br />Mr. SPEAKER-Order! The ' honorable<br />member for Newcastle Will remain silent.<br />Sir ROBERT MENZIIES.-With great<br />respect, Mr. Speaker, he Came here only to<br />make a noise and he will never make a noise<br />except from the back bench, on whichever<br />side ' he is.<br />Their solution calls for close and concentrated<br />attention, undistracted by the parliamentary<br />crises which are inherent in an<br />almost equally divided House. In particular,<br />Australa is increasingly significant in<br />and affected by the political and economic<br />activities and arrangements of other nations.<br />It therefore needs a government that can<br />speak and act authoritatively on behalf of<br />Australia. The nation is entitled to this, and<br />to choose uinambiguously who shall speak<br />for it. I repeat that, for the Teasons I stated earlier, the Opposition can-not legitimately<br />object to an election which it has<br />repeatedly done its best to secure.<br />I shall -mention times, because there has<br />been some very -funny gossip, stated as -fact,<br />in certain organs of opinion. I therefore<br />yesterday morning advised His Excellency<br />the Governor-General -that the House of<br />Representatives should -be dissolved at the<br />close of the current business on or about<br />31st October, and that an election should<br />be held on 30th November.<br />Opposition Members.-Hoorayl<br />Sir ROBERT MIENZIIES.-I share your<br />joy. I had a personal interview with His<br />Excellency yesterday afternoon. I am sorry<br />to disappoint the prophets. His Excellency<br />has to-day accepted this advice in writing on<br />the usual condition, of course, that before<br />dissolution the Parliament should have made<br />the necessary financial provisions for the<br />services of the country. Well, all honorable<br />members understand that. This means<br />that the debates on the Appropriation Bills<br />must be completed before dissolution.<br />There are, of course, Mr. Speaker, other<br />important measures, some of them arising<br />out of the Budget, which will have to be<br />disposed of. I expect, particularly in the. 1<br />light of my announcement to-night, that all<br />the necessary business will be completed<br />by or before the end of this month.<br />TIY AUTHORITY: A. J. ARTHUR, COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT PRINTER, CANBERRA.</p>
