PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 5 December 1985<br />
JOINT PRESS RELEASE BY THE PRIME MINISTER, MR H{ AWKE, AND THE<br />
SOUTH AUSTRALIAN PREMIER, MR BANNON<br />
The Prime minister, Mr Hawke, and the Premier, Mr Bannon, today<br />
announced that two major South Australian projects had been<br />
granted funding under the joint Commonwealth-State Bicentennial<br />
Commemorative Program.<br />
The first project is to relocate the existing Mile End Railway<br />
Museum at Port Dock Station at Port Adelaide. Mr Bannon said<br />
that the museum fulfilled an important role in the preservation<br />
and care of historically significant engines, rolling stock and<br />
memorabilia associated with South Australia's railway history.<br />
" It is the only railway museum in Australia displaying<br />
locomotives representative of four different railway gauges,<br />
reflecting the State's unique position in Australian railway<br />
history." Mr Bannon said the Museum would attract 60,000 visitors a year<br />
and because of its proximity to the South Australian Maritime<br />
Museum, would add another feature to the redevelopment of the<br />
Port Adelaide area. The museum will be completed within the<br />
Bicentennial year 1988.<br />
The second project to be given Federal funding is the tropical<br />
conservatory in the Botanic Garden. Mr Bannon said that the new<br />
tropical conservatory of steel and glass construction would have<br />
educational, scientific and recreational value to the community<br />
and would provide a striking Bicentennial focus for the<br />
imaginative redevelopment of the Hackney bus depot site. It will<br />
be used to cultivate a tropical-plant display featuring species<br />
from Australia, Malaysia and the Pacific region.<br />
Mr Hawk~ e said that the Commonwealth Government was pleased to be<br />
associated with the two projects. The project nominations from<br />
the South Australian Government demonstrated imagination and a<br />
commitment to Australia's heritage. They were another example of<br />
Commonwealth-State cooperation which served to illustrate the<br />
Bi'centennial theme ' Living Together'.<br />
The two Bicentennial projects will cost a total of $ 7.1 million.<br />
Two other Bicentennial projects which will be jointly funded by<br />
the Commonwealth and State have already been announced. These<br />
are the River Murray Interpretive Centre at Goolwa and a Tourist<br />
and Out1-back Interpretive Centre at Port Augusta. </p>
