AUSTRAL IA<br />
PRIME MINISTER June 1974<br />
PRESS STATEMENT NO. 263<br />
NITROGENOUS FERTILISERS SUBSIDY<br />
The Prime Minister, Mr E. G. Whitlam, M. P."<br />
announced today that legislation extending the Nitrogenous<br />
Fertilisers Subsidy Act until 31 December 1975 would be introduced<br />
into Parliament later this year. Mr Whitlam said that this action<br />
was in accordance with the Government's commitment to continue<br />
the present subsidy pending a report on the matter from the<br />
Industries Assistance Commission.<br />
Mr Whitlam said that under the Industries Assistance<br />
Commission Act,+ assistance could not be continued beyond<br />
31 December 1975 in the absence of a report from the Commission.<br />
Mr Whitlam said the Industries Assistance Commission<br />
had been asked to advise on the amount and duration of any<br />
subsidy and the consequences of limiting any such assistance to<br />
a maximum tonnage per farmer.<br />
Under the present subsidy scheme the subsidy is paid<br />
at the rate of $ 78.74 per tonne of contained nitrogen. It is<br />
paid on nitrogenous fertilisers manufactured and sold for use in<br />
Australia and in certain circumstances on imported nitrogenous<br />
fertilisers, provided the full benefit is passed on to the user.<br />
Subsidy payments in 1972/ 73 amounted to $ 13.1 million.<br />
The Government recognised the regional importance of<br />
nitrogenous fertilisers to sugar producers, horticulture and<br />
sections of other rural industries.<br />
Mr Whitlam said that the Government's decision on<br />
assistance beyond 31 December 1975 would be taken after receiving<br />
the Commission's report which has been requested by September 1975.<br />
