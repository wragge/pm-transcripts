PRESS CONFERENCE GIVEN BY THE PRIME M4INISTER,_<br />
SIR ROBERT MENZI3S , JN LONDON, ON 1 9T JUE, 165<br />
PRIMEIMINISTER In vieiw. of what has appeared in the Press here,<br />
I tought I ought to say something about the suggestion by<br />
rumah about the withdrawal of the Australian Forces. I think<br />
Iought to say right away that I do not propose to quote what<br />
o her people say in the Conference. I think this is not right.<br />
I$ fact there is a general rule, which is sometimes broken, to<br />
t at effect. But where a statement is made which affects my<br />
p sition what I have said or what I have done, then I regard<br />
myself a-liberty to say something, and on this occasion what<br />
D Nkrumah put forward was given publicity by his delegation<br />
p~ resumably, and it is very important therefore to note what it<br />
w s that he put forward.<br />
He said he thought that Australia and New Zealand<br />
could make a magnanimous gesture by withdrawing, in the case of<br />
A Iustralia, the troops already in South Vietnam, and delaying the<br />
djespatch, in the case of New Zealand, of the artillery unit that<br />
tlhey are proposing to send. He also said that an appeal should<br />
emade to the United States to terminate bombing in North Vietnam.<br />
Now you will not fail to notice that these are all<br />
ropoalsfor the weakening of the Military position of what I<br />
ill call " our side". There was no suggestion that any appeal be<br />
9ade to North Vietnam to refrain from reinforcing or supplying, and<br />
~ o appeal to the Viet Cong to cease fire, nothing of that kind.<br />
his was purely a one-sided proposal and as such I dealt wiith it,<br />
What I said in substance and almost in terms, I<br />
Shink, was that these two proposals were calculated to weaken the<br />
osition of South Vietnam and the forces defending South Vietnam and<br />
orrespondingly to strengthen the position of the enemy, without<br />
lny concession being made by the enemy at all, and such a proposiion,<br />
Ias not prepared to accept for one minute, and I therefore<br />
ejected it and quite rightly,<br />
I would just like to make it clear, if it needs to<br />
made clear, that if this mission succeeds in establishing some<br />
asis for negotiation some basis for a conference, and manages<br />
to secure as part of that a general cease-fire on the part of all<br />
. lements, that of course would be a very different matter, and one<br />
jrhich naturally we as one of the sponsors of this mission would<br />
trelcome. I There is one other aspect of this conference which<br />
I think I should mention, and it's this. As I think I pointed out<br />
g ast year when I got back to Australia, there is a new vocabulary<br />
r rsing in these meetings. People use words in different senses.<br />
Pwwe are, of course, treated and defined by others as being<br />
jcommitted while they themselves say they are uncommitted, This is<br />
a subtlety which needs a little study.<br />
WJhat is meant, I gather, after two days, is that you<br />
are committed if you either publicly support the action of the<br />
United States or publicly participate in the defence of South<br />
Vietnam, but you are uncommitted if you confine your support of<br />
China or Hanoi to urords, This is a distinction of immense<br />
subtlety. It has to be borne in mind because, really, to be<br />
accused of being committed, which in my ease is an honourable<br />
crime, by someone who is equally committed on the other side, seems<br />
to me a little odd, Now I wanted to say that because there is a<br />
lot of distortion going on in some of the columns here in London.<br />

PRI E MINISTER What I now say will be increasingly true in<br />
( C ntd.) future years as the numbers of those present<br />
gro r. This year we have twenty-one Prime Ministers. ge have, I<br />
6up] kose fifteen topics that will need to be discussed and if<br />
eve sybody wants to make a speech on each, that will be three<br />
hun red speeches and of course that horse won't gallop. In the<br />
old days, everybody could speak on everything but it can't be done<br />
tod y. For example, yesterday we were surveying<br />
pol tical problems of the world and we were dealing in particular<br />
wit the general survey of Africa. Well it is the African Prime<br />
Min sters who speak and by the time that they've spoken,( I am not<br />
say ng they spoke at any undue length; it was very informative<br />
and interesting) but by the time they have finished, time's up,<br />
you might say, and this is going to happen more and more. So<br />
tha more and more there will be views expressed that will not be<br />
ar ued out in the conference. Nobody other than an African<br />
spoke on the African problem. None of the rest of us spoke, nor<br />
I suppose ever will, until we come to the communique to see what<br />
goes in. This is no complaint. It is inevitable. This is a<br />
phenomenon we will all have to take notice of in the Prime<br />
Miristers meetings. I am sure we will have to devise some ways<br />
anc means of restricting either the length of statements or the<br />
re etition of arguments already put which will enable both sides<br />
to be stated where there are two sides to the question. It is<br />
go ng to be a bigger problem as time goes on.<br />
There is another matter connected with the<br />
Au traliaiposition on these discussions. Nothing has been said so<br />
fa: to detract from the position of Malaysia, and I am hoping we<br />
sh l1 come out of this conference with another declaration in<br />
support of Malaysia like the one we had last time, and so far I<br />
halren't heard anything that would suggest that we cannot. But one<br />
vi w we take very strongly is that you cannot treat Vietnam in<br />
is lation because manifestly if the Communists overran South Vietnam<br />
an the whole position was lost there would be imminent danger to<br />
La s to Thailand, and I would think certainly to Malaysia, which<br />
is already of course occupied on one front. Therefore we have<br />
tr. ated the problems of South-East Asia as a whole, saying you<br />
ca mot break them up into fragments, and what would normally be<br />
ot resoluteness of mind about South Vietnam is strengthened because<br />
to us South Vietnam is part of a pattern and it is in relation to<br />
the whole area that we see the overall threat and the overall need<br />
fo resistance. One further point I would like to make about<br />
t e mission is this. I did not expect Mr. Senanayake would be able<br />
to, join it because the very reason which prevented him from<br />
co~ ming to this conference would obviously prevent him from going on<br />
almission of this kind which might take some time. His Budget<br />
cdmes in a month earlier than ours and as you know, he has a<br />
d~ tficult series of problems, financially and economically, in his<br />
oihn country. Certainly his absence or unwillingness to join this<br />
m: ssion is not to be treated as a criticism of the setting-up of<br />
Smission and on the contrary, Ceylon made it quite clear that it<br />
voured this view, this action, as indeed most of us did.<br />
We do not take vote Ãµ but clearly there was a<br />
s bstantial consensus of support for the Wilson proposal. </p>
<p>-3<br />
QUE. STION : Can you clarify for us the New Zealand angle?<br />
P. M. : No, I can't. The Prime Minister of New Zealand is<br />
here. He is of age. He can speak for himself,<br />
Q* I would have regarded Australia as one of the<br />
Governments principally concerned in South Vietnam.<br />
I just wondered what action the mission was going to take<br />
to sound out your own views on the basis for a negotiation.<br />
P. M. dell, we haven't been treated as a party principal<br />
and I must say that the mission proposes to approach the<br />
United States and I would anticipate it would visit Moscow,<br />
Peking Hanoi, Saigon, Washington, and it will maintain<br />
contacl in one way or another with the Secretary-General<br />
of the United Nations, but it had not occurred to me that<br />
it needed to come to Canberra to ask me what my views were.<br />
Q. Could you give us the basic principles on which a<br />
settlement could be reached, You mentioned a cease-fire,<br />
but could you take it from there?<br />
P. M. We, ourselves have always believed that if there is<br />
to be a cease-fire It must be all round and reciprocal.<br />
In other words, if there is to be a cease-fire on the<br />
part of the South Vietnamese and the Americans and the<br />
Australians, whoever is there, then there must equally be<br />
a cease-fire on the side of the Viet Cong, however one can<br />
get at them or identify them. A cessation of reinforcement<br />
or maintenance of any kind from North Vietnam, a cessation<br />
of aggressive conduct on the part of North Vietnam in<br />
other words, a full respect for the territorial integrity<br />
and political independence of South Vietnam and that<br />
nothing should be left which would involve South Vietnam<br />
after an armistice in being left to the mercy of the<br />
Communist groups in the Viet Cong. In the long run, what<br />
we want is an independent South Vietnam, living in peace,<br />
able to conduct relations in an atmosphere of peace, able<br />
therefore to establish a democratically-elected government<br />
with some probability of stability and with some assurances,<br />
however they may be obtained or guaranteed, that she be<br />
left alone to live her own life.<br />
Q4 Do you see any possibility of the removal of the<br />
division between North and South Vietnam?<br />
P. M. I would not have thought so in my time not that I<br />
am blaming myself for it, but I am stating it as a<br />
chronological proposition.<br />
Q. Inaudible,<br />
P. M1 Don't get this out of proportion. Australia is not<br />
Iliuknede r criticism. What Ghana did was to say " I would<br />
to make a suggestion." He said, " I make this<br />
humbly and I suggest to my friends that they might help."<br />
I don't call that an attack. I had to reject the<br />
suggestion, that is all.<br />
Q. In your opening presentation, you used the x.. ord<br />
that the two proposals made by Ghana were " calculated"<br />
to weaken the position in South Vietnam. Do you use<br />
the word " calculate" in its strict sense? a0 00/ </p>
<p>PrM. No, I dont meau_' Udesigned-Oh no. I am<br />
prepared to assume this would have the effect of<br />
I am glad you raised that point. I am not challenging<br />
the bona fides of the suggestion by Nkruniah. All I<br />
challenged instantly was the effect that it would have,<br />
QO Has Australia ever had in a conference like this<br />
a direct request like this to do something externally?<br />
P. M. No, not in my time, but perhaps this is the only<br />
time when the circumstances might give rise to it, because<br />
we do have forces there,<br />
Q. Do you hold out at this time much hope for the<br />
success of the mission, in view of the differences of<br />
opinion we have had so far.<br />
P. M. I don't know that I will want to say very much on<br />
that. I think it has some hope of success, but for us to<br />
speculate about it and sort of begin to lay the odds, I<br />
think might have no good result. I think it is a very good<br />
thing to have this mission) that this is a very well worthwhile<br />
exercise. Those who might think this might operate<br />
to the disadvantage of China can think so only on the<br />
footing that they believe that China will not call it<br />
off. That will be for China to decide or for Hanoi to<br />
decide.<br />
Q. How much do you feel that Mr. Wilson's suggestion<br />
might help him with his own political troubles in Britain?<br />
P. M. I wouldn't make any such suggestion. I think that<br />
is a good cynical view, but it is not mine. Mr, Wilson<br />
discussed this notion of his with me at great length before<br />
be produced it. I happened to be the senior Prime Minister<br />
and I happened to be in a place where he was and therefore<br />
there was a chance to talk and he took me into his<br />
confidence in this matter and we discussed it and tossed<br />
it around and I think from everybody's point of view it<br />
is a jolly good proposal and well worth pursuing.<br />
QO When did he make you aware of this proposal first?<br />
P. M. I think it was the night before. This was a highly<br />
secret proposal. Yes, I heard about it within twenty-four<br />
hours of the announcement.<br />
Q. As far as you are aware, had he made any proposal<br />
of this kind to President Johnson while you were there<br />
last week in this respect?<br />
P. M. I don't think so.<br />
Q0 If the mission succeeded in obtaining a real ceasefire<br />
these are circumstances in which you might then<br />
consider the withdrawal of the Australian troops?<br />
Q. dtell, we would then consider the position as the<br />
Americans would. We would not be likely to withdraw while<br />
they remained because we're there with them and for a<br />
common purpose.<br />
Q. Have you had any discussions with President Nkrumah<br />
outside the conference? e see &amp; 1 </p>
<p>P. M.<br />
Q. P. M.<br />
Q. P. M.<br />
Q. P. M.<br />
Q. P. M. No. We haven't had much chance to have any private<br />
discussions with anybody since it began. I am going to<br />
Chequers tonight. There are bound to be one or two Prime<br />
Ministers there and Dorneywood tomorrow night, and I<br />
suppose there will be more there.<br />
Do you think there's a possibility that the Commonwealth<br />
will become so cumbersome that it will cease to<br />
make any worthwhile contribution in the future?<br />
I'd sooner not answer that. I'm a little what's<br />
this modern word? I'm a little unclear in my mind.<br />
There is no question, as far as you know, of Ghana's<br />
membership in the mission being dependent upon Australiars<br />
withdrawal...... Oh dear no. No suggestion of it. I'm afraid one or<br />
two of you may still be under the impression that this was<br />
a sort of demand. It was put up as a suggestion. This<br />
was done when we resumed yesterday. He even said that<br />
he made it with due humility, and it was never at any time<br />
associated with Ghana's membership of the mission.<br />
He didn't raise it on the first day?<br />
No. This was the first and only time this proposal<br />
was made. In other words, this came as a kind of second thought?<br />
I don't know whether it was a second thought or a<br />
third thought. All I can say is the simple fact that he<br />
mentioned it when we resumed our conference yesterday<br />
morning. At the conclusion of the conference the<br />
Minister for External Affairs Mr. Hasluck, said " Might<br />
I make one point on this question of why should the mission<br />
not visit Australia? The thought in Mr. Wilsohts mind,<br />
you will recall at the outset, was the Mission would go<br />
to those powers who have it within their competence to<br />
stop hostilities if they wish to do so." For the same<br />
reason I think it unlikely that they'll need to visit<br />
London. </p>
