FOR PRESS: PM No. 51/ 1971<br />
MINISTERIAL COMM ITTEE ON ABORIGINAL AFFAIRS<br />
Statement bythe Prime Minister, Mr. William McMahon<br />
In my statement to the meeting of Commonwealth and State Ministers<br />
responsible for Aboriginal Affairs in Cairns on 23rd April 1971 1 said that I wou. ld<br />
establish within the Commonwealth a Ministerial Committee to assist the Minister<br />
responsible for Aboriginal Affairs to develop and co-ordinate policies for Aboriginal<br />
advancement and to prepare material dealing with these policies for Government<br />
decision. The Committee, which will commence work as soon as possible, will<br />
comprise: The Minister responsible for Aboriginal Affairs;<br />
The Treasurer;<br />
The Minister for Foreign Affairs;<br />
The Attorney-General;<br />
The Minister for the Interior;<br />
The Pcstmaster-General;<br />
The Minister for Social Services.<br />
Other Ministers including the Ministers for Health, Housing, Education and Science,<br />
and Labour and National Service, will join the Committee when matters for which<br />
they are responsible are under review. The Comm-ittee will be assisted by the Council<br />
and Office of Aboriginal Affairs.<br />
The Committee will take into account the policies and programmes in<br />
operation in the Northern Territory which are comprehensive and impressive and<br />
which it is important should be more generally known.<br />
The Committee will review urgently Commonwealth programmes for the<br />
advancement of Aboriginal citizens. These programmes will include those which are<br />
carried out by the Commonwealth on an Australia-wide basis or in the Northern<br />
Territory as well as Commonwealth financial support for State programmes. The<br />
Committee will report to the Government progressively.<br />
There are some aspects of this question on which it would be inappropriate<br />
for me to comment until the question of a possible appeal in the Yirrkala Land Case<br />
is determined. In the meantime the Government has decided that if an appeal is made<br />
it will meet the legal costs of the appellants.<br />
In the Northern Territory areas totalling 94, 000 square miles are reserved<br />
for Aborigines. Special legislative provision has been made for pastoral and<br />
agricultural leases within these Reserves for Aborigines only and a considerable<br />
number of applications for these and other purposes has been received. They will be<br />
considered by a specially constituted Land Board with Aboriginal members appropriate<br />
to the localities concerned. </p>
<p>Financial assistance is also available to help Aborigines in agricultural or<br />
pastoral activities and business ventures such as timber, fisheries and various<br />
commercial projects. The work of delineating areas of ceremonial or traditional<br />
interest to Aborigines is proceeding and a number of these places will shortly be<br />
declared for protection under law. Consideration is also being given to setting<br />
aside certain areas associated with hunting, foraging or recreation e. g. at Gove and<br />
Groote Eylandt. It is impossible to summarise adequately the range of policies<br />
and action taken and I have asked the Minister for the Interior to elaborate on them<br />
in a statement he will issue shortly.<br />
The Committee has. been asked to consider whether changes in or<br />
developments of policy in the Northern Territory are desirable in relation to<br />
protection of lands reserved for the use and benefit of Aborigines and<br />
within such lands<br />
ensuring continuing groups of Aborigines<br />
the use of land for ceremonial, religious or<br />
recreational purposes<br />
( it) making available on appropriate tenure to<br />
individual Aborigines and groups of<br />
Aborigines land necessary for the conduct<br />
of commercial enterprises.<br />
setting up an Aboriginal Land Fund to acquire land coming<br />
on the market in the Northern Territory which can be made<br />
available on appropriate tenure to Aboriginal groups for<br />
commercial enterprises and other purposes.<br />
ensuring that subject to the requirements of national development<br />
Aborigines on lands reserved for their use and benefit will be<br />
given reasonable preference in mineral<br />
prospecting and exploration and<br />
( it) the opportunity to participate effectively in<br />
mining and related developments.<br />
supporting commercial enterprises which have reasonable<br />
prospects of success on land held by Aboriginal communities<br />
( particularly where they are isolated and without alternative<br />
opportunities) by grants from the Aboriginal Advancement<br />
Trust Account as well as by loans from the Capital Fund for<br />
Aboriginal Enterprises.<br />
I do not wish to anticipate the recommendations of the Ministerial Committee<br />
or decisions in relation to them but I repeat what I said at Cairns that it is my<br />
Government's intention to build effectively upon existing programmes both in its own<br />
fields of responsibility and in collaboration with the States so as-to achieve a<br />
breakthrough to a new level of achievement in the advancement of Aboriginal citizens.<br />
