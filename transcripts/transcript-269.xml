P. M. No. 2/ 1961<br />
CONTRIBUTION-TO WORLD-HEALTH ORGANISATION<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister and Minister for External<br />
Affairs, the Rt. Hon. R. G. Menzies<br />
In 1955 the 4orld Health Organisation launched a<br />
world-wide campaign to eliminate malaria, a disease which<br />
threatens a third of the world's people. The campaign is<br />
being financed in large part by voluntary subscription to a<br />
Special Account for Malaria Eradication. In response to an<br />
urgent request from the Director-General of the World Health<br />
Organisation, the Australian Government has this year<br />
contributed Å“ C20,000 to the Fund.<br />
This year's contribution is larger than previous<br />
contributions, and is a token of Australiats support for the<br />
campaign and of the Government's appreciation of its<br />
objectives. The Australian mainland is virtually free from<br />
malaria, but in the Territory of Papua and New Guinea the<br />
eradication of malaria rjmains a major problem. In that<br />
Territory Australia has undertaken a fourteen year eradication<br />
programme, estimated to cost ovter two and three quarter million<br />
pounds. The success of that programme, on which last year<br />
the Administration of the Territory spent over f-200,000, will<br />
be of benefit not only to the Territory, but to the world-wide<br />
campaign which the World Health Organization is directing.<br />
CANBERRA, 7th February, 1961. </p>
