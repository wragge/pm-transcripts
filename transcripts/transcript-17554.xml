Prime Minister Julia Gillard and Acting Attorney-General Brendan O'Connor today said the Commonwealth Government would continue to provide assistance to Queensland communities affected by flooding over Christmas.</p>
<p>Following a request from Queensland, the Government is providing two Blackhawk helicopters to assist in the evacuation of Theodore.</p>
<p>Australian Defence Force personnel are on stand-by to offer further support if required.</p>
<p>Six additional Local Government Areas have been declared natural disaster zones following severe rainfall over the past few days - Cairns, Cassowary, Tablelands, Goondiwindi, South Burnett and Western Downs.</p>
<p>A total of 31 Queensland LGAs are now receiving Commonwealth assistance through the Natural Disaster Relief and Recovery Arrangements (NDRRA).</p>
<p>Under the NDRRA, financial support will be provided by the Commonwealth to Queensland for counter disaster operations and for the restoration of essential public infrastructure, such as roads, bridges and schools, where expenditure exceeds certain thresholds and requirements.</p>
<p>In addition personal hardship and distress grants are available to communities in the Southern Downs, Western Downs, Lockyer Valley, Banana Shire, Central Highlands, Barcaldine, North Burnett and Bundaberg Local Government Areas.</p>
<p>While conditions across much of Queensland have eased, the threat from floodwaters remains in many areas. Authorities have evacuated a number of residents in Charleville, Theodore, Dalby and Chinchilla. Other communities remain isolated.</p>
<p>The Gillard Government will continue to work closely with the Queensland Government to provide assistance to affected communities.</p>
<p>Many emergency services workers and volunteers in Queensland spent Christmas away from their families to support communities that have been inundated with water. These people deserve our thanks.</p>
<p>Acting Attorney General Brendan O'Connor said the Commonwealth Government would continue to monitor the situation in disaster declared areas across Australia and work with State Governments to provide assistance to communities affected by extreme weather conditions over the past few weeks.</p>
<p>More than 120 LGAs in five states - Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia and Western Australia - are receiving Commonwealth assistance through the NDRRA.</p>
<p>We will also continue to monitor the situation in other flood affected areas, particularly in NSW where a number of communities remain isolated across the state.</p>
