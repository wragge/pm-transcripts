    <content><![CDATA[<p>I was saddened today to learn of the death of Sir Allen Fairhall, the former Defence Minister and Liberal Party Member for Paterson.</p>
<p>Sir Allen was one of the '49ers, that special group of parliamentarians who were elected in the 1949 poll that ushered in more than 20 years of Liberal-National governments.</p>
<p> He was the Minister for Defence from 1966 to 1969, Minister for Supply from 1961 to 1966 and Minister for the Interior and Works from 1956 to 1958.</p>
<p>Many people saw him as an aspirant for the leadership of the Liberal Party following the drowning of the then Prime Minister Harold Holt. He declined despite being a leading candidate and voluntarily retired in 1969.</p>
<p>He was knighted in 1970.</p>
<p>Although I did not serve in Parliament with him, I knew Sir Allen well. He was a forthright politician and a likeable person who was a very good Defence Minister and campaigner.</p>
<p>On behalf of Janette and myself and the Australian Government, I extend my deepest sympathies to Sir Allen's family and friends. I have extended  the offer of a State Funeral to his family.</p>
