FOR MEDIA 16 FEBRUARY 1983<br />
MR HAWKE NEGLECTSHOMEWORK<br />
Mr Hawke often tells us of his great expertise in<br />
industrial. relations. One would have thought he would<br />
know his facts. Given the importance he gives to a<br />
" prices and incomes policy", one would have expected<br />
him to do at least a little homework.<br />
Mr Hawke recently said in a national television broadcast that<br />
there was never a price! s and incomes policy in Britain.<br />
But the facts dernostrate that there was.<br />
Mrs Shirley Williams who ran the policy in-Britain during<br />
the seventies has said that " In practice it ( was) quite<br />
a strict policy". She demonstrated clearly that Mr Hawke<br />
was plainly and simply wrong.<br />
Mrs Williams also made it clear that the British prices<br />
and incomes policy was only maintained by pretty<br />
draconian powers and penalities powers that are not<br />
available to an Australian government. It cau! sed<br />
companies to cut back on investment and damage their<br />
longterm interests with an inevitable destruction of jobs<br />
and job opportunities,<br />
But Mr Hlawke still won't accept the facts. He's still<br />
twisting and turning with word games and oxcuses. He says<br />
" I put it that there was not a situation where there was<br />
in place policies in regard to all the eleinents of prices,<br />
dividends, rents and interest..., arid I adhere to that<br />
as does every commuentator who has examined the situation<br />
there. There were elements of a prices and income3 policy<br />
but part of the problem was that the parts did not make<br />
a whole"<br />
Mr Hawke still can't get it right. Don't take my word for<br />
it, take the word of Mrs WilliaITIs who says quite plainly<br />
" In practice it is quite a strict policy. The incomes<br />
policy side was voluntary but it was very much kept. On<br />
the pr-ices side direct control of the retail mark-ups,<br />
the amount that the retail Lrade could add on to any sale,<br />
and thore was also a prices code for the private company.<br />
And companies had to yet approval from the uvernment before<br />
they could increase thoir prices beyond a certain amount." </p>
