SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
CONFEDERATION OF AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRY<br />
ANNUAL DINNER<br />
CANBERRA 8 NOVEMBER 1990<br />
Congratulations on your impeccable sense of timing.<br />
This annual dinner brings the members of the CAI to Canberra<br />
in the midst of an unusually intense period of policy<br />
activity. Indeed, as I told my ministers in the Cabinet Roam on<br />
Monday, the Federal Government is engaged in our most<br />
concentrated burst of policy reform since 1983.<br />
Consider this list of reforms currently under way:<br />
the Special Premiers Conference last week brought<br />
together the parties to Australia's Federal compact in<br />
a unprecedently constructive and positive approach to<br />
making our system of Government work more efficiently;<br />
the Special Conference of the Labor Party has opened<br />
the way for the introduction of competition into the<br />
vital telecommunications industry;<br />
the Two Airlines agreement has at last run its course:<br />
a new, more competitive, structure for domestic<br />
aviation is being put in its place:<br />
land transport, the waterfront, coastal shipping are<br />
all seeing fundamental reforms that will improve<br />
productivity and efficiency;<br />
policies are being developed that will see a workable<br />
and sensible approach to ecologically sustainable<br />
development;<br />
In a major statement in Parliament this afternoon I<br />
announced the latest developments in the Government's<br />
continuing task of micro-economic reform.<br />
3 106) i </p>
<p>Tonight I will touch, on many of these issues particularly<br />
ones in which the CAI has expressed special interest, such<br />
as the Special Premiers' Conference.<br />
But at the outset I want to integrate this diverse range of<br />
activity and put it in its proper perspective the<br />
perspective provided by more than seven and a half years of<br />
Government, in which we have consistently followed a<br />
strategy directed at improving the quality of. li4fe for all<br />
Australians. w<br />
Our strategy has seen consistent pursuit of these goals:<br />
sustained and sustainable economic growth;<br />
continuing employment growth;<br />
controlled and equitable wage growth;<br />
increased efficiency and international orientation of<br />
the economy aiLming at a transition to a competitive<br />
world class economy fully enmeshed in the dynamism of<br />
the Asia-Pacific region;<br />
a fairer society created through radical welfare<br />
reform, with tho emphasis on better services for<br />
families and for the aged and sick; but all of this<br />
within the context of unprecedented financial<br />
responsibility and restraint;<br />
a clever country in which intellectual skills are<br />
prized and harnessed to the broader needs of the<br />
community; an environment safeguarded for future generations<br />
through policies~ of ecologically sustainable<br />
development.<br />
This is not the place to take you through the chapter and<br />
verse of our reform program since 1983.<br />
But I do point, with pride, to the consistency with which we<br />
have pursued those comprehensive but intensely complementary<br />
goals over the past seven years.<br />
The Accord which delivered wage restraint and social wage<br />
increases in 1983 is still providing, in. 1990, an effective<br />
mechanism for wage fixation, as well as for the vital<br />
processes of award restructuring and union amalgamation. And<br />
let me add how pleased I am to note the significant measure<br />
of tripartite consensus that is emerging over the future<br />
shape of the wage system, through the conferences held under<br />
the auspices of the Industrial Relations Commission. The<br />
CAI has played a key rcole in that process. This is a very<br />
significant achievement which needs to be cemented into<br />
place in the forthcomiLng National Wage Case. 3107 </p>
<p>The National Economic Summit, that brought the key economic<br />
players together around the same negotiating table in 1983,<br />
is echoed in 1990 with the Special Premiers' Conference<br />
bringing together the leaders from our three levels of<br />
government in a determined effort to span jurisdictional and<br />
partisan differences with the common objective of improving<br />
the system of federal administration.<br />
Our floating of the dollar and deregulation of the financial<br />
system in 1983 began an unparalleled sequence of<br />
microeconomic reforms that -w as my statement in Parliament<br />
showed today is continuing to reinvigorate key sectors of<br />
the economy.<br />
Before 1983, Australians endured almost three consecutive<br />
d8endes of conservative rule. They were decades<br />
in which the essential tasks of economic restructuring<br />
and micro-economic reform were neglected;<br />
in which the challenges of a rapidly changing<br />
international environment were shirked in favour of the<br />
introversion of tariff protection;<br />
in which the hard tasks of introducing fairness and<br />
efficiency into our taxation and social welfare systems<br />
were swept under the carpet;<br />
in which fiscal discipline was a forgotten art as<br />
budget deficit piled on budget deficit;<br />
in which industrial confrontation between employers and<br />
employees was ' allowed to obscure their underlying<br />
commonality of interest.<br />
In 1L983, this Government was confronted with the urgent need<br />
to : remedy those accumulated symptoms of neglect and of<br />
abrogated leadership.<br />
We have had to cram 40 years of reform into ten.<br />
And deliberately and progressively, we are putting Australia<br />
back on the rails.<br />
We have created a rate of employment growth twice the OECD<br />
average.<br />
We have turned a Commonwealth budget deficit of $ 9 billion<br />
into a surplus of almost that size, reducing the public<br />
sector's call on the nation's savings by around $ 28 billion<br />
at today's prices.<br />
We have slashed the nominal rate of assistance to the<br />
manufacturing sector from 13 to 10 per cent, and the<br />
effective rate from 22 to 17 per cent.<br />
Industrial disputes have fallen by some 60 per cent.<br />
3108 </p>
<p>4.<br />
For the future, our macro-economic management must continue<br />
to focus on reducing the current account deficit as a<br />
proportion of the GDP to the point where our debt to GDP<br />
ratio stabilises, and on reducing our inflation rate to that<br />
of our major trading partners.<br />
It was to achieve these goals that we have, in recent times<br />
had to rein in demand, which had been placing~ unsustainable<br />
pressure on our current account.<br />
The tight fiscal, wages and monetary policies that we<br />
employed for this purpose have of course imposed hardships<br />
on the community.<br />
But there has never been any doubt that had we not taken<br />
these firm measures, the rest of the world would, in effect,<br />
have taken them for us resulting in a much greater degree<br />
of dislocation and pain throughout the community.<br />
It is now clear that we have achieved our immediate aim of<br />
slowing demand and that the benefits are flowing as<br />
yesterday's CPI figure dramatically showed. Accordingly we<br />
have been able to ease monetary policy, with five separate<br />
reductions this year in professional interest rates now<br />
feeding through to smaller businesses and home-owners.<br />
This, combined with. scheduled tax cuts and wage increases,<br />
and cyclical developments in the economy, should see<br />
activity pick up through 1991 as the Budget forecast.<br />
That is the fundamentally sound position in which Australia<br />
now stands.<br />
But there can be nc question of changing the basic direction<br />
of policy or of slackening the pace of reformn. We cannot<br />
afford to slip backwards. We will not do so.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen,<br />
That is the broad context within which I want you to<br />
understand the Government's determination to proceed with<br />
the current round of micro-economic reforms.<br />
Let me speak tonight of two specific areas: the Special<br />
Premiers Conference and today's Parliamentary Statement.<br />
Quite simply, I believe the Premiers Conference introduced a<br />
new, commonsense, constructive dimension into Commonwealth-<br />
State relations.<br />
Through direct negotiations unemcunbered by the suspicions<br />
that are the traditional ingredient of such meetings, the<br />
Premiers, Chief Ministers and I reached agreement on a range<br />
of matters directed to the more effective delivery of a wide<br />
range of services to the citizens of Australia and enhancing<br />
the contribution of government to economic efficiency. 3109 </p>
<p>In substance and in atmosphere, the Conference was a very<br />
significant breakthrough.<br />
ThE3 CAI's submission, which I was very pleased to receive in<br />
tho lead-up to the Conference, identified four key areas<br />
requiring greater cooperation and rationalisation: the<br />
environment; packaging and labelling; food; and economic<br />
infrastructure, particularly communication, transport and<br />
energy. I am happy to be able to report significant achievements in<br />
each of those areas.<br />
As you are aware, the Government is committed to the concept<br />
of ecologically sustainable development a greater<br />
integration of economic and environmental goals in all our<br />
major industry sectors. The development of an<br />
Intergovernmental Agreement on the Environment, on which<br />
Governments across Australia are now committed to working,<br />
wi: ll help facilitate:<br />
a co-operative national approach to the environment;<br />
a better definition of the roles of the respective<br />
Governments; a reduction in the number of disputes between<br />
Governments on environmental issues;<br />
greater certainty of Government and business decisionmaking;<br />
and, not least,<br />
better protection of the environment.<br />
I am aware of your~ concern about the need for greater<br />
consistency in environmental regulatory processes. As you<br />
know, a lot of work is being done in this area at the moment<br />
to identify the problems and suggest ways of overcoming<br />
them, and your sponsorship of the Bureau of Industry<br />
Economics' work in this area is a positive contribution.<br />
On your second point, we will receive a report on packaging<br />
and labelling requirements at the next Special Premiers'<br />
Conference scheduled for May 1991. The report will be based<br />
on the principles and framework we agreed on at the<br />
Conference for rationalising regulation in brief, each<br />
State will recognise each other's standards in cases where<br />
national uniformity is not deemed to be essential for<br />
economic efficiency.<br />
In your third area, one of the major reforms announced at<br />
the Conference was the support by the States and Territories<br />
for a system of uniform food standards regulated by a<br />
National Food Authority.<br />
131.10( </p>
<p>It is on your fourth point, infrastructure, that there has<br />
been the moat dramatic progress, both at the Premiers<br />
Conference and through the decisions of the Federal<br />
Government I announced in Parliament today.<br />
The Premiers, Chief Ministers and I were able to<br />
achieve a degree of progress in the critiq* l area of<br />
land transport that had, in earlier and leisser forums,<br />
proved impossiLble.<br />
We signed a Heads of Agreement to establish a National<br />
Rail Freight Corporation, which will involve new<br />
investment, new industrial relations standards and new<br />
rail management.<br />
On road transport, we agreed to pursue the introduction<br />
of national uniform operating regulations and driver<br />
licensing, nationally consistent road user charges and<br />
clearer definition of responsibilities for funding and<br />
managing elements of the road system between different<br />
levels of Government.<br />
The next Premiers' Conference in May. 1991 will consider<br />
a report on the scope for further extensions to the<br />
interstate electricity network.<br />
Australia'sa telecommunications industry is being<br />
dramatically re-shaped, with potentially limitless<br />
benefits: new investment, new jobs, new exports, and<br />
for consumers, cheaper services and greater choice.<br />
Domestic aviat~ ion has been at last liberated from the<br />
dead hand of t~ he Two-Airlines Agreement, opening the<br />
door to new services and lower prices.<br />
Real progress has been made on the waterfront with<br />
entrenched inefficiencies giving way to leaner<br />
practices that: without massive industrial disruptions<br />
promise productivity gains of up to 60 per cent.<br />
That is only a thumb-nail sketch of what I have described as<br />
the most active pe17iod of micro-economic reform this country<br />
has seen.<br />
I have repeatedly challenged the Opposition parties to point<br />
to a period of more profound and more rapid micro-economic<br />
reform, across a broader front. That challenge of course<br />
remains unanswered; because for 31 of the 34 years before we<br />
came to Office Aust~ ralia was governed by a conservative<br />
Coalition that was consistently incapable of the hard work<br />
and far-sighted vietion necessary for successful reform.<br />
Ladies and Gentlemen 3.111 </p>
<p>7.<br />
It's all too easy in discussing micro-economic reform to get<br />
overwhelmed by the technicalities or to be simply confused<br />
by the jargon. In fact the quality of the debate about, for<br />
example, telecommunications reform has been very high indeed<br />
at least on the Government side.<br />
But behind all the technicalities of interconnect fees,<br />
duopolies and the resale of telecommunications capacity,<br />
there lies a simple truth.<br />
Telecommunications reform is ultimately about new<br />
investment, new jobs, cheaper services, and new exports. It<br />
is; about improving the way in which Australian households<br />
and Australian businesses get access to that most<br />
fundamental of modern day instruments, the telephone and<br />
the ever expanding range of other new communications<br />
technologies. It is about making sure Australia can play a part in the<br />
explosion of demand for telecommunications equipment in our<br />
immediate Asia-Pacific region. As I said in Parliament<br />
today, the nations of the Asia-Pacific region have half the<br />
world's population but only 17 per cent of its 500 million<br />
telephones. Dy the end of this century, that 500 million is<br />
expected to double.<br />
The reforms we are making are designed to ensure that<br />
Australia can compete effectively in this extraordinary<br />
growth. In other words, what we are after in telecommunications<br />
reform is the same goal we pursue with every other policy<br />
endeavour to equip our economy so that it can deliver to<br />
its citizens the. quality of life to which they justifiably<br />
aspire. And let me stress this vital point.<br />
I~ f you believed what you read in the newspaper, you might<br />
conclude that micro-economic reform is limited to a couple<br />
of industries and a handful of employers.<br />
Nothing could be further from the truth.<br />
' The battles of micro-economic reform are taking place across<br />
it broad front indeed, across the broadest possible front:<br />
the entire economy.<br />
Lt is a process that ultimately involves everyone.<br />
This is more eloquent than all the statistics, and certainly<br />
mnore comprehensible than all the jargon.<br />
Last Friday in Melbourne I opened a new campus of the<br />
Western Institute which will form part of the Victorian<br />
University of Technology, the first University to be sited<br />
in the western suburbs of Melbourne.<br />
3112 </p>
<p>8.<br />
Immediately afterwards, I opened the South Pacific Truck<br />
Tyre plant at Somerton a plant which is scaling new<br />
heights in productivity, thanks to massive capital<br />
investment and positive industrial relations that have<br />
abolished restrictive work practices and created more<br />
efficient patterns of work. Productivity at this plant is<br />
realistically expected to be the best of any tyre plant<br />
anywhere in the world, and so it gives Australia another<br />
competitive edge in export markets.<br />
New universities offering educational opportunities where<br />
they have never been offered before, and new factories<br />
setting world standards for productivity this is microeconomic<br />
reform.<br />
Such examples are the hard evidence out in the community<br />
that fundamental change is taking place; they are the heart<br />
and soul of the dynamic process of economic reconstruction<br />
currently underway in Australia; they are the proof positive<br />
that Australia can, increasingly, engage our region, and the<br />
world, on new and more competitive terms.<br />
I promise you, and I promise the people of Australia who are<br />
the ultimate beneficiaries of this commitment, that my<br />
Government will carry through these plans to their<br />
completion. 311.3 </p>
