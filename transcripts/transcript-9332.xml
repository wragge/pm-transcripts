TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
DOORSTOP, " GENAREN", NARROMINE, 24 AUGUST 1994<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
J: You acknowledge that drouth! is frequent what programs can the<br />
Federal Government put in place to make the job easier for farmers?<br />
PM: Well, I think my point was let's not regard drought as an entirely<br />
exceptional thing. Let's deal with the exceptional circumstances when<br />
they arise, but let's keep long-term programs in because drought is<br />
around most of the time now in one form or another. I think, that's<br />
what we're trying to do. That is, to try and design the. RAS scheme<br />
the Rural Adjustment Scheme in a way where we can actually support<br />
people who are viable and carry them help carry them through<br />
difficult drought times.<br />
J; Does that mean there won't be any more emergency aid during this<br />
drought?<br />
PM: No, no. That's no, I think there will always be hard hit areas that do<br />
need emergency relief. And I think you've got to do two things you've<br />
got to have an emergency facility, and you've got to have a longer term<br />
facility.<br />
J: Will there be further funding coming? The Government has offered<br />
$ 14 million two weeks ago, is there any more coming?<br />
PM: Well, I think that we will see how that applies. I mean, we're now<br />
starting to review the application of the RAS scheme across the States<br />
to see that it applies that the generosity of the scheme is uniform, and<br />
to make sure in the review of RAS that the criteria for payments and<br />
assistance in drought affected areas, you know, is really a workable<br />
program. </p>
<p>J: What about suspending the assets test a lot of producers would like<br />
to see that happen?<br />
PM: But then, what do you say about the assets test for people in the rural<br />
towns? And everywhere else? You see, that's a. . that means<br />
suspending the assets test in general. That's what that means.<br />
J: So that proposal that will go to Caucus next week is likely to fail?<br />
PM: Well, I think that's a very difficult one to manage. I mean, we've<br />
already got now substantial concessions in rural home excluded, fifty<br />
per cent of the value is, I think, is only taken into account.<br />
J: The athletes success at the Commonwealth games yesterday a lot of<br />
people are saying that Australia.. ( inaudible)..<br />
PM: Oh well, I think that Australians feel justifiably proud of their athletes<br />
with the tally of gold medals we've won and as with these games, I<br />
think, most of the people the Australians thought would be stars have<br />
not disappointed them. And Australia is a great sporting country and<br />
it's further confirmation of this fact.<br />
J: Cathy Freeman won the, I think, 400 metres this morning and she ran<br />
her victory lap with the Australian flag and the Aboriginal flag. What<br />
are your comments on the flag over there at the Commonwealth<br />
games?<br />
PM: Oh well, she had the Australian flag. I mean she's an aboriginal<br />
person. Anyone of prominence, ' andabkoriginal person of prominence,<br />
they associate with the aboriginal flag from time to time. I mean, I<br />
don't think we can be too critical of that.<br />
J: She's one of our most successful aboriginal athletes at the<br />
moment.. ( inaudible)?<br />
PM: I think of course it is. I mean aboriginal Australians have distinguished<br />
themselves down through time, and they're still at it.<br />
J: Prime Minister, business leaders are placing pressure on Alexander<br />
Downer to release more details in his directions statement. Do you<br />
think he will capitulate?<br />
PM: Well, you can't be in the game of politics and not have policies. Mr<br />
Downer wants to be a player in the game of politics without policies.<br />
And to have, you know, sort of feelings about policies or directions, but<br />
not actually have them. The reason he doesn't want to tell us is not<br />
that he doesn't have them, he thinks that we won't like them. I mean,<br />
obviously, he has a whole lot of hardline policies. It's not that he<br />
hasn't thought about these policies, it's just that he doesn't believe that </p>
<p>the public will like them. So he's being monkey-cunning and sitting on<br />
them.<br />
J: Is he in danger of alienating the business community?<br />
PM: I think the business community is taking a dim view of the coalition.<br />
Look at the.. I said at the time he was elected they've changed the<br />
jockey but not the horse. I mean the problem about the liberal party is<br />
it has institutionally had it. It doesn't know anymore what it wants to do<br />
with Australia, and doesn't know how. Even if it knew, it doesn't know<br />
how. It couldn't control inflation in the seventies, it had no policies for<br />
faster rates of growth, it certainly had no trade policies of substance.<br />
And when the business community now see the growing economy, four<br />
per cent employment growth, five per cent economic growth, low<br />
inflation, high profits, they say well before we shift from this, the<br />
coalition have got to give us a coherent strategy. And of course, no,<br />
Mr Downer doesn't have a coherent strategy. Dr Hewson didn't have<br />
one, Mr Peacock didn't have one, Mr Howard didn't have one, and<br />
that's why I think the business community is saying we better stick with<br />
the party we know, and the Government we know.<br />
J: Barry Jones has got ( inaudible)<br />
PM: Well, I'm not here to answer any more..<br />
J: Just one more local story. I believe this is your first time to the area Mr<br />
Keating. We were just wondering the perception is that people in<br />
Canberra are neglecting the situation out here with the drought. Do<br />
you think it's important for you to be able to see it first hand and see,<br />
you know, what the situation is here?<br />
PM: Yes. Well, I do, and I think it is important to get a feel, a local feel, of<br />
drought affected areas and drought conditions. I mean, I've seen it<br />
many times over my parliamentary life, and it's a matter of trying to<br />
tailor the programs and policies to deal with it. But we're also seeing a<br />
lot of leadership. And what we're seeing here today is a lot of<br />
leadership about preservation of the country-side concern about<br />
salinity, concern about soil erosion, innovative farming policies to<br />
minimise erosion, to improve the yield from pasture, sensible stocking<br />
levels, you know, preservation of remnant forests. I mean, this is the<br />
lesson that we're seeing, I think, with the leadership of a lot of people<br />
in farm communities. That's our hope. That's going to be our hope.<br />
Now the Commonwealth can play a role we can play a role in<br />
Landcare, we can play a role in trying to encourage the farm<br />
community into better practices. But we're now starting to see that<br />
come naturally, and I think that this is when we will see this blossom.<br />
When the farm community's leadership is such that this becomes the<br />
norm in rural Australia. And as well as that, we're seeing an<br />
improvement in prices, which is always a cheering thing, that is,<br />
something to cheer people up. I mean, wool Prices have improved, </p>
<p>4<br />
and as rural incomes start to shift up, that's going to cause a bit more<br />
joy.<br />
J: Do you think the personal effects of drought do you think they're<br />
starting to hit home with people now? Like, do you feel that more and<br />
more politicians are realising that this is the situation we can't pretend<br />
it's not as bad as it really is out here?<br />
PM: I don't think anyone is pretending that at all. I think that people know it<br />
is, it's just the bewildering problem of an absence of rain, and how you<br />
keep viable people on the land until the drought conditions break.<br />
That's the point of getting these Rural Adjustment Schemes and that<br />
right, so they truly are helpful carrying people on. Okay, thank you.<br />
ends. </p>
