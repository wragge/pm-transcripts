<p>The Pilgrims<br />
A Dinner to honor The Right Honorable Robert G.<br />
vfenzies, Prime Minister of Australia, was given by The Pil-<br />
, rims of the United States on Saturday evening, March<br />
955, at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel, New York, Mr. Hugh<br />
3ullock, Chairman of the Executive Committee of The Pil-<br />
' rims of the United States, presiding. The Right Reverend<br />
he Bishop of New York gave the invocation.<br />
CHAIRMAN BULLOCK: Ladies and Gentlemen, will you<br />
ise and drink with me The Pilgrims' loyal toast: To Her<br />
dfajesty The Queen!<br />
( The audience stood and toasted the health of Her<br />
dajesty the Queen, while the orchestra played the British<br />
Jational Anthem.)<br />
PRIME MINISTER MENZIES: Sir, To The President!<br />
( The audience toasted the health of The President of<br />
he United States, while the orchestra played the American<br />
' ational Anthem.)<br />
CHAIRMAN BULLOCK: Mr. Prime Minister, Your Ex-<br />
! llencies, Mr. Secretary, Governor Dewey, Very Distinguished<br />
; uests and Fellow Pilgrims:<br />
For over half a century The Pilgrims Society has provided<br />
ie most distinguished platform from which a speaker could<br />
iscuss matters of common interest to citizens of the United<br />
Page 3 </p>
<p>States and citizens of the British Commonwealth of Nations.<br />
While most of our guests of honor have come from the<br />
United Kingdom, nevertheless, over the years, we have been<br />
privileged to entertain prime ministers of Canada, New<br />
Zealand and, on two previous occasions, prime ministers of<br />
Australia. This evening, once again, we have as our honored guest<br />
another Prime Minister of Australia. I am just as disappointed<br />
as you are that our President, Mr. Davis, is not here to welcome<br />
him. No one could do so with equal eloquence. I only hope<br />
that our loss is Mr. Davis' gain and that he is benefitting<br />
from a warm South Carolina sun-although an Australian<br />
sun is more reliable this particular time of year. Not that<br />
I have ever been privileged to be in Australia, but there will<br />
succeed me shortly at this rostrum three gentlemen who have.<br />
But first I want to read to you two messages. The first<br />
is from our sister society in Great Britain:<br />
" THE PILGRIMS OF THE UNITED STATES:<br />
" The Pilgrims of Great Britain join with The Pilgrims<br />
of the United States in the welcome you extend tonight<br />
to one of the most distinguished citizens of the Commonwealth<br />
who has just been visitifig these shores. Mr.<br />
Menzies with his wide knowledge of world affairs and<br />
his gift of expression is a welcome guest at every feast,<br />
and we will think of you and him on this happy Saturday<br />
evening. " HALIFAX CAMPBELL STUART<br />
President Chairman<br />
[ Applause<br />
I have a second message that I hope you will listen to<br />
carefully. It reads:<br />
Page 4 </p>
<p>" Dear Mr. Bullock:<br />
" Please extend my greetings to the Right Honorable<br />
Robert G. Menzies and to those who honor him at the<br />
March fifth dinner given by the Pilgrims of the United<br />
States. " In two World Wars Australia contributed valiantly to<br />
the Allied cause. And recent years have given continuing<br />
demonstrations of the interest and effort which our two<br />
nations share in the preservation of freedom and security.<br />
I need only cite our mutual support of the United Nations<br />
in its efforts to repel aggression, our participation in the<br />
Colombo Plan, and our common membership in the<br />
ANZUS Treaty and the Manila Pact.<br />
" I trust the visit of Prime Minister Menzies will reenforce<br />
the close and friendly relationship which exists<br />
between our two countries.<br />
" To all of you I send best wishes for a most enjoyable<br />
meeting." That message comes from the Honorary President of<br />
The Pilgrims of the United States. The signature is " Dwight<br />
D. Eisenhower". [ Applause)<br />
Across the pages of history of every city and state and<br />
nation there comes, none too often, a brave and able crusading<br />
spirit whose touchstone is integrity and whose aim is dear<br />
for all to see-good government.<br />
And even before his election as District Attorney of New<br />
York County in 1937 at the age of 35, and certainly after his<br />
elevation to Chief Executive of the greatest state of our Union,<br />
integrity and good government have been synonymous with the<br />
name of Thomas E. Dewey. [ Applause] During his three<br />
terms as Governor he has given New York State a splendid<br />
administration. Page </p>
<p>Governor Dewey admires our guest of honor as much as<br />
I do. I have heard him evaluate Mr. Menzies in the highest<br />
terms as an administrator and statesman. Before this eminent<br />
Australian addresses us, however, it is my privilege to present<br />
to you an American administrator, an American statesman,<br />
who has made our city, our state, our country a better place<br />
to live in: The Honorable Thomas E. Dewey. [ The audience<br />
rose and applauded.)<br />
THE HONORABLE THOMAS E. DEWEY: Mr. Chairman, Mr.<br />
Prime Minister, Distinguished Guests, Ladies and Gentlemen:<br />
" It is a little over five years ago that Mrs. Dewey and I were in<br />
Berlin, and I was somewhat surprised that the Mayor of Berlin<br />
had made a rather insistent request that I visit City Hall. We<br />
were not in Berlin for political purposes, nor were we there for<br />
the purpose of visiting City Hall. But the Army, which was in<br />
charge, " suggested" that we go, so, of course, I said, " Wherever<br />
I am, I do as I am told," and we went. [ Laughter]<br />
The Mayor, as you will remember, was Ernst Reuter,<br />
who was one of the extraordinary people of our time. He<br />
was imprisoned because he was a Communist, allegedly, and<br />
he was imprisoned because he was not a Communist. He<br />
was one of Hitler's victims who escaped from a concentration<br />
camp to Britain where an honest man with a free conscience<br />
has always been able to find asylum. Then he went to Turkey.<br />
He learned the language, and for six years taught economics<br />
in Turkish. After the war, he returned to Berlin, and, in due<br />
course, he became the first elected Mayor of West Berlin. He<br />
was one of the great souls of our time, and his recent death<br />
was one of the tragedies of our time, at the age of<br />
Having got to the City Hall, we sat down with the other<br />
six members of the City Government. Mayor Reuter said,<br />
Page 6 </p>
<p>" Governor, I suppose you are a little curious as to why I<br />
urged you to come to City H-all."<br />
I said, " Well, Mr. Mayor, I was interested in the reason."<br />
He said, " Did you see the three thousand people who<br />
were on the steps of City Hall as you came in?"<br />
I said, " Yes."<br />
He said, " Do you know why they were there?"<br />
I said, " No, Mr. Mayor. I don't and I was interested."<br />
He said, " Do you realize that you are the only man they<br />
have even seen who ran for the highest office of his land, was<br />
defeated, and survived? [ Laughter] You are the most important<br />
object lesson to the people of Germany that I ever<br />
saw." [ Laughter)<br />
I have cherished that lesson and I'm grateful for it, I<br />
might say. It is comforting to live in a country where you<br />
can disagree with 51 per cent of the people and still be<br />
allowed peaceably to practice your profession. [ Laughter)<br />
It is nicer to have 5 1, but sometimes you have to settle for 49.<br />
[ Laughter] I remember back in the days when there was less, shall<br />
I say, intense personal partisanship at the Executive Mansion<br />
in Albany, when Al Smith was Governor. Al Smith was a<br />
Democrat, but he had retained a Republican as Conservation<br />
Commissioner. A member of the Assembly said to him at a<br />
reception one night, " Governor, I am interested in the fact that<br />
you have kept on all this time a Republican Commissioner of<br />
Conservation." Governor Smith responded, " Well, I will tell you about it,<br />
Pete. He is a nice guy and he is a good Conservation Commissioner.<br />
I told him that I had a collection of monkeys in<br />
the zoo back of the house and so long as he kept those monkeys<br />
in good health he could be Conservation Commissioner, and<br />
Page 7 </p>
<p>they are the healthiest monkeys in America." [ Laughter<br />
It must have been nice to have lived in the days when<br />
partisanship didn't exceed good taste. Maybe those times<br />
will come back again. I do not know any particular portion of<br />
the world where that pleasant and nostalgic condition prevails,<br />
but it may still be said that there are portions of the world,<br />
and particularly of the English-speaking world, where, when<br />
all the chips are down, there is no voice of authority who fails<br />
to put the welfare of his country and the peace of the world<br />
ahead of partisanship or the interest of his particular political<br />
party. I am at a peculiar disadvantage tonight. For a great many<br />
years I have been Governor of New York, for so long that<br />
the memory of man runneth not to the contrary. [ Laughter<br />
The difficulty is that you fall into slovenly habits if you are<br />
Governor of New York, perhaps even if you are a prime<br />
minister-I wouldn't know; I never have been one. The<br />
difficulty is that you get so that you come to dinners with an<br />
idea or two, but your real purpose is to scavenge on the people<br />
who speak before you, and so long as you are Governor, you<br />
have a right to speak last. [ Laughter] Now that I have<br />
voluntarily surrendered that exclusive privilege, I am no<br />
longer a successful scavenger. [ Laughter I leave that to my<br />
betters on my left and on my right.<br />
There are too few of us who have had the privilege of<br />
visiting the great nation whose Chief Executive Officer we<br />
honor tonight. I was horrified to find three and a half years<br />
ago when I visited Australia that no prime minister of Britain,<br />
no king or queen had even been there, no president or vice<br />
president of the United States-maybe some cabinet officer,<br />
but nobody remembered it. And there is a land mass larger<br />
than the United States of America. There is a nation with<br />
Page 8 </p>
<p>the vigor that can only come from the peculiar liberties enjoyed<br />
by English-speaking people, and a variety of climate<br />
extending from the north, which is tropical, to the south, which<br />
compares with the northern part of the United States, where<br />
in March it is delightfully warm, I am told, and where in<br />
August, as it was when I was there, it can be fairly cold and<br />
miserable, just as it is here in New York right now. The<br />
central heating is not in accordance with our standards but<br />
I venture to say that it produces a much healthier people. I<br />
found very little central heating, but I didn't find very many<br />
people complaining about it. Moreover, they didn't seem to<br />
bother about whether the temperature was 65 or 72 degrees,<br />
as we do, and I heard nobody complain about it except the<br />
newspaper men who were traveling along with me-and me.<br />
[ Laughter) I did have to dig out my winter underwear that<br />
I had shipped out, and I felt a little bit like a weakling<br />
because my Australian friends weren't wearing any. I thought<br />
perhaps they were producing a sturdier race. We had better<br />
look to our laurels.<br />
I spent some time, I have forgotten quite how long, at<br />
a sheep station-in American that is a sheep " ranch," but in<br />
Australia it is a " station." It was the largest sheep station in<br />
Australia, and it is called Boonoke. They have produced the<br />
finest line of Merino sheep in Australia. If you don't think<br />
that is important, you ought to live in Australia and you would<br />
find out how important it is. I was cold from the minute I<br />
got there until the time I left, but I learned more about sheep<br />
shearing, how magnificently sheep shearers can work, and what<br />
an important thing it is to produce a fine line of sheep with<br />
the right kind of wool, than I had in my preceding 49 years of<br />
existence. Page 9 </p>
<p>There are some remarkable differences as well as similarities<br />
between Australia and this country. They have now and<br />
have had for some years a shortage of manpower. As a result,<br />
you don't have to stay at your job if you don't like it. You<br />
can walk down one block and get a different one. The result<br />
is that in one shop which employs 500 people they had 2,000<br />
people employed in that year, never more than 500 at a time.<br />
This must be wonderful for the people who work in it and<br />
terrible for the boss.<br />
They have a tax system which is not unrelated to ours,<br />
and no more attractive than ours. They have a system of<br />
treating their guests which is rather different from ours, too.<br />
When I was there, the Prime Minister then and now, out of the<br />
generosity of his heart, made available an airplane which the<br />
government provided. In fact, in addition to that, there was<br />
a brilliant and charming young man named Arthur Allen who<br />
can eat orange juice, steak, potatoes and pie for breakfast, and<br />
I know very few Americans outside of Boston who can do that.<br />
When I got there, I found that my clothing had been lying in<br />
the airplane office for five weeks, and looked like it. My<br />
secretary, Paul Lockwood's clothes had been there the same<br />
length of time. He is 6 feet 4 and weighs 240 pounds. His<br />
looked even worse than mine. Allen apologetically said, "~ I<br />
am so sorry that I did not bring my iron. When we get to<br />
Canberra I will take care of it."<br />
They really produce some remarkable civil servants in<br />
Australia. I never saw one in this country who would say that.<br />
Well, anyway, in the time I was there, I had this delight.<br />
ful schedule: it simply called for visiting a large number of<br />
Australian cities, each of which is more charming than its<br />
predecessor, and we were always the guests of the Prime<br />
Minister. So that, unlike this country, I suspect that unless<br />
Page </p>
<p>he has a unique and special privilege, the State Department<br />
has assigned somebody to accompany him, and, beyond that,<br />
he is on his own, he has no military aide, no political aide,<br />
no presidential secretary, no cars, chauffeurs, no airplanes.<br />
I enjoyed the hospitality of the Australian Government<br />
for the entire time, and the only counterbalancing factor was<br />
that each place I went, from Deniliquin, population 1,500,<br />
to Sydney, I found a radio in front of my face, a wonderfully<br />
cordial welcome, speeches of welcome, and I, who had gone<br />
on this trip never expecting to make but two speeches, made,<br />
think to my embarrassment, four speeches a day minimum the<br />
entire time I was in Australia, and every one of them on the<br />
nationally owned radio service. If the people of Australia<br />
ever hear of me again, I am sure they will throw me out, but<br />
it was all beyond my control.<br />
When the Prime Minister of Australia comes to this<br />
country, he receives the usual inadequate American welcome,<br />
but he doesn't have a radio and television set thrust before him<br />
every day. [ Laughter and applause]<br />
I am sure that all of you would be delighted if the Prime<br />
Minister were in a position to throw away the thoughts that<br />
he has gathered and tell you more about this fabulous land,<br />
larger than the United States, with a population of about 9<br />
million, a great continent lying with the shadow of a long<br />
island above it, held in divided and disputed authority. From<br />
that island, the Japanese attack on Australia was in a position<br />
to be launched but was frustrated, partly because almost a<br />
million American troops went to Australia.<br />
One of the extroardinary events of modern history was<br />
that invasion of almost a million young men from a nation as<br />
far away from home as they could be ( you can't get any further<br />
away from New York than Australia). There they were,<br />
Page 11 </p>
<p>lonesome and on the loose, full of vigor, many of them partially<br />
trained, dumped on Brisbane and the surrounding area.<br />
And the incredible thing is that the people of Brisbane and<br />
Australia were able to open not only their homes, their purses,<br />
but their hearts, and they took in this almost a million Americans,<br />
so that as a result there was not only a minimum of that<br />
dreadful friction which occurs when a community is inundated<br />
by the youth of a strange nation in uniform to fight a war,<br />
but there has been erected a monument to the Americans who<br />
came. I suggest, ladies and gentlemen, that the monument<br />
should have been to the people who welcomed them with<br />
all their hearts and souls and made them feel at home.<br />
[ Applause] It may be true that they saved Australia. It may be true<br />
that the vast naval engagements destroyed the power of the<br />
attacking force, but this was one of the most memorable of<br />
all invasions, which resulted in a grand total of good will<br />
which will last for a century.<br />
It is good to know that there are such wonderful people<br />
as far away from this country as they can be, with the kind<br />
of leadership that every American admires, with the kind of<br />
purpose that we admire. It is especially valuable that in these<br />
difficult times where there is the sharpest disagreement as to<br />
policy, not only among the English-speaking peoples but<br />
among others, as to the degrees and gradations of our defense<br />
of existing free areas, that we have not only stout friendship<br />
but also the brilliant intellectual companionship of the people<br />
of Australia, and I should also add of New Zealand and<br />
Malaya and Singapore, who are their near neighbors, in dealing<br />
with the most delicate and explosive problems of the free<br />
world at this moment. They are the finest of allies that the<br />
free world has ever known. I should like to say to you to-<br />
Page 12 </p>
<p>night that of all the leaders of the free world whom I have<br />
known over the last 20 years, and I have known practically<br />
all of them, none has ever stood higher, and there is none<br />
today with more powerful intellectual capacity, a purer flame<br />
of patriotism, a more brilliant capacity to serve the cause of<br />
human freedom, than the gentleman we have the honor to be<br />
with tonight. [ Applause)<br />
CHAIRMAN BULLOCK: About a month ago Governor<br />
Dewey and I were at a small luncheon together, and he talked<br />
somewhat along these lines about Australia and about our<br />
guest of honor. I said, " Governor, you are elected." When he<br />
looked a bit puzzled, I said, " I urge you to speak at The Pilgrims<br />
dinner which we are giving early in March in honor<br />
of Prime Miftister Menzies." And, Governor, whether you<br />
speak first or last, you speak superbly, as always! [ Applause]<br />
Earlier this century a President of the United States wrote<br />
a book entitled " Have Faith in Massachusetts." This country<br />
does have faith because of the kind of men Massachusetts<br />
produces three Presidents, a host of Cabinet members, a<br />
legion of fine public servants.<br />
You know I am sure that Weeks is an honored name in<br />
Massachusetts. Secretary Weeks' father before him was United<br />
States Representative, United States Senator, and a member of<br />
two Presidential Cabinets. Secretary Weeks himself typifies<br />
the best of Massachusetts traditions. He was Harvard, 1914<br />
it couldn't have been any other college, could it? ( Laughter)<br />
He is an Overseer today. In World War I he commanded a<br />
Battery attached to the Rainbow Division and saw his full<br />
share of action. His son commanded the same Battery in<br />
World War II. Page 13 </p>
<p>He has been banker as well as manufacturer, with many<br />
years of public service. He has been United States Senator<br />
from Massachusetts. He worked diligently to put a great President<br />
in the White House. And since January, 1953, he has<br />
been our very able Secretary of Commerce.<br />
I present to you a Massachusetts man and an outstanding<br />
American public servant: The Honorable Sinclair Weeks.<br />
[ The audience rose and applauded.]<br />
SECRETARY WEEKS: Mr. Chairman, Mr. Prime Minister,<br />
your Excellencies, Governor Dewey and Pilgrim guests; I am<br />
very happy to be with you this evening. I appreciate very<br />
much the friendly introduction I have received. When they lay<br />
it on quite as thick as that, I think of a dear old lady from my<br />
part of the country in New England who passed away and on<br />
her tombstone she was one of the great characters of her<br />
small community she had done every good work and been<br />
a wonderful citizen on her tombstone they put this epitaph,<br />
" She averaged well for these parts." [ Laughter] Mr. Chairman,<br />
that is all I ever hope to do to average well for what<br />
I may say is the best part of the United States, New England.<br />
I may also correct you, Mr. Chairman. I hesitate to do<br />
this because I would hardly want to be ungrateful for your<br />
reference, but I cannot have myself allied with the Rainbow<br />
Division. My division was the best division, the Twenty-Sixth<br />
Division. [ Laughter]<br />
It is indeed a pleasure to join with you in welcoming your<br />
distinguished guest, the Right Honorable Robert Gordon<br />
Menzies, the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth of Australia.<br />
I am glad to have the opportunity of talking to the<br />
Pilgrims. Your Society, which for over fifty years has been<br />
Page 14 </p>
<p>strengthening the bonds between the United Kingdom and the<br />
United States, together with your sister organization in the<br />
British Isles, have fostered a better appreciation on both sides<br />
of the Atlantic of our common heritage, in such fundamentals<br />
as language, literature, law and government, and have facilitated<br />
a two-way exchange of ideas and cultural achievement<br />
which has brought a better understanding between the two<br />
oldest English-speaking peoples of the community of nations.<br />
With better understanding has come unity of purpose,<br />
strengthening our common devotion to freedom and our determination<br />
to help each other preserve it. So I congratulate you,<br />
The Pilgrims of the United States and of Great Britain on this<br />
great achievement.<br />
It seems to all of us highly appropriate that from time to<br />
time you welcome the representatives of the other Englishspeaking<br />
nations, and when such a representative is from the<br />
Commonwealth of Australia, which in war and peace has made<br />
contributions to international freedom and progress out of all<br />
proportion to its population and wealth, we do honor to ourselves<br />
as we honor him. [ Applause]<br />
I think it is rather interesting that the two who have<br />
been asked to talk to you this evening with the Prime Minister<br />
have both had some experience with Australia. My first<br />
experience was in 1917 when I had a good look at the soldiers<br />
of Australia and New Zealand, and I can say to you without<br />
any throwing off on the soldiers of our own or any other<br />
nation, that we all thought that the men of the Australian and<br />
New Zealand Army Corps were about as fine fighting men as<br />
there were on the Western Front. [ Applause]<br />
Somewhat later, the business with which I was associated<br />
in my previous existence till 1953, set up a subsidiary in<br />
Australia, in Adelaide, and it has been very successful, if I<br />
Page </p>
<p>may say so apologetically. I won't mention names, so there<br />
will be no danger of a plug here, but between ' 29 and the<br />
opening of the second World War, we multiplied the business<br />
four times as far as volume of sales, and since that date, in<br />
' 39, we have multiplied it ten times, and it is going along all<br />
right. We like it. I say " we" -you understand I have disassociated<br />
myself from the business. We like it, and we think<br />
it is the kind of an operation at least we hope it is the kind<br />
of an operation that our friends in Australia like.<br />
I went out there some time before the second World<br />
War. Tom has stolen some of my thunder as far as Australia<br />
is concerned. I could talk on it for hours. I went out on a<br />
ship they didn't fly in those days, and I read everything in<br />
the world I could about Australia and, ladies and gentlemen,<br />
the next trip you take, go to Australia. It is a great<br />
country. You see things there that other places in the world<br />
you only see in fossil form. I am speaking of the vegetable<br />
life. [ Laughter] The animals and I'll see how many of you<br />
can follow me now the animals are all marsupials. Is that<br />
correct, Mr. Prime Minister? But a little more seriously, go<br />
out there and if you don't do anything else go and see the<br />
koala bear and if you want to see the worst part of Australia<br />
go to one of those sheep stations that Tom was talking about,<br />
and experience Australian flies.<br />
The tea is marvellous. Seven times a day I had it. I<br />
cannot say as much for the coffee. At least I could not in those<br />
days. I guess it is a lot better now.<br />
Australia is a country that always steps up and meets its<br />
responsibilities. It is doing so again today. It has realized<br />
the danger to the free world of Communist aggression in Asia,<br />
and is doing something about it. The recent meeting at Bangkok<br />
of the Council of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization<br />
Page 16 </p>
<p>reminds us of our joint interest in the Far East. There the<br />
Foreign Ministers of Australia and the United Kingdom and<br />
the United States, New Zealand, Pakistan, the Philippines,<br />
Thailand, a representative of France, have just forged dcloser the<br />
ties of defense. In particular they recognize the insidious<br />
threat of Communist subversion and infiltration to the peace<br />
and security of the area, and henceforth we think that the eight<br />
governments will carry on continuing consultations and mutual<br />
assistance, each drawing upon the experience of the others in<br />
dealing with this danger.<br />
No less important in preserving the integrity and authority<br />
of the freely constituted governments of Southeast Asia are<br />
their economic strength and the social well-being of their<br />
citizens. At Bangkok the member states inaugurated steps to<br />
increase economic cooperation and to promote economic<br />
progress. Of course, the Bangkok meeting is merely the latest<br />
of many successful steps free governments have taken in the<br />
past few years to deter aggression and preserve peace. I need<br />
not recite for this audience the long list of accomplishments<br />
in mutual help and firm solidarity. You and I know that today<br />
free nations are collectively stronger than at any time in recent<br />
years, and perhaps we may pray that this be so, that the utter<br />
futility of modern warfare may become more evident as time<br />
goes on. But in any event, whatever happens, the United<br />
States and Australia not only will but must continue to stand<br />
shoulder to shoulder. [ Applause]<br />
With respect to business relations, and this is my particular<br />
field, of course, the relations that we have in this<br />
country with Australia have been excellent. 475 business establishments<br />
in the United States have placed their investments in<br />
Australia in the form of companies that they have established<br />
there, and they find a ready welcome on the mat. Companies Page 17 </p>
<p>that you know all about the Standard of New Jersey, Ford,<br />
Chrysler, General Motors, Goodyear, General Electric, Swift-<br />
I could go on indefinitely our investments in Australia have<br />
just doubled in total dollar value in the last four years. In<br />
connection with the investment of American capital in Australia,<br />
it is interesting to me to recall the words of Acting<br />
Prime Minister Sir Arthur Fadden at the opening of the new<br />
Philip Morris plant in Melbourne in January this year when<br />
he referred to Australia's policy of welcoming foreign capital<br />
from abroad in these words, " The policy of the present Commonwealth<br />
Government is therefore to welcome overseas capital<br />
to Australia, particularly if it is intended for permanent<br />
investments, and if it is likely to contribute to the desirable<br />
development of Australian resources." And I say our experience<br />
in 25 years has demonstrated that all of that is true, in<br />
trade back and forth. We are accustomed up there to think<br />
of wool as one of the leading exports to this country, and we<br />
need it and use it in our woolen and worsted industry. But<br />
many people do not realize what a change has come of recent<br />
years. Back in ' 37, when I went to Australia, 2 per cent of<br />
our imports from that country were in metals and minerals,<br />
and today they are 33 per cent of what we take from Australia,<br />
and we think that our trade with Australia can be and will be<br />
increased in both directions, and we hope that that is what<br />
will happen. They are the economic counterpart of that mutual cooperation<br />
between the English-speaking peoples of the world<br />
which your organization has fostered so successfully over these<br />
many years.<br />
The importance of this common interest cannot be overstressed.<br />
With it goes the interchange of not only goods but<br />
of our people and our cultures, and what better way on earth<br />
Page 18 </p>
<p>is there to develop friendship and peace between the nations<br />
for the common good of all.<br />
Personally, I think that there is a bright economic future<br />
in store for Australia and the United States if we do some<br />
things which will promote economic growth. And here I want<br />
to make a point. Because of some conversations that have<br />
been indulged in recently, there are many steps we can take<br />
to attain prosperity, and what I say here applies to Australia<br />
as it does to this country.<br />
One of them is to encourage the advancement of technology.<br />
The industrial revolution's machinery released man<br />
from muscular slavery and is supplying him with a wealth of<br />
new goods and new jobs. Today is the dawning age of truly<br />
automatic machines, which we describe by a new word " automation."<br />
Automation is providing man with mechanical senses<br />
of feeling and hearing and sight, in some cases even with<br />
electronic brains. The result of this fresh surge in productivity<br />
must be a higher standard of living for everyone. Yet, my<br />
friends, there are some Doubting Thomases that have arisen<br />
in both countries who seem afraid to take a full advantage of<br />
the new technology with its self-regulating machinery, its automatic<br />
memories and other labor-saving innovations.<br />
Some apprehension stems from a lack of knowledge, some<br />
from misleading propaganda.<br />
Recently a new rash of opposition to and fear of new<br />
technological progress has been voiced in some circles in this<br />
country, and some unscrupulous demagogues and economic<br />
illiterates are trying to scare people into the belief that this<br />
automation is a vicious frankenstein devouring their jobs. I<br />
am certain that this is the most stupid and the most cruel misguidance<br />
that can be given to the free workers of the free<br />
world. Page 19 </p>
<p>Such a dread of progress, however, is not new in history.<br />
Years ago a mob invaded Hargreaves' home and smashed his<br />
spinning jennies. Quill penmen rose in anger against the<br />
introduction of the printing press. Paris workers rioted against<br />
the sewing machine. English hand knitters used sledgehammers<br />
to smash Cartwright's power loom. Supposing these<br />
people had been able to stop progress. Millions of new jobs<br />
would never have been created. Untold numbers of new products<br />
would never have been manufactured for the pleasure and<br />
well-being of mankind.<br />
Karl Marx, whose false doctrines have brought limitless<br />
misery to his dupes, bitterly condemned the machine as the<br />
soul of capitalist exploitation.<br />
Now, let us not permit those doctrines to prevail. It is<br />
my job as Secretary of Commerce to study the economy and<br />
to determine what is happening in this field, and the jobs<br />
that have been increased over the years have been something<br />
beyond belief.<br />
I will just give you one example. In the automobile<br />
field, where some scaremongers at the moment are attempting<br />
in particular to frighten workers with the bogey man of automation,<br />
the record shows that the industry, a pacemaker in<br />
technological advancement, employed a million workers in<br />
1953 as against just half that number in 1939.<br />
The late Philip Murray, the American labor leader, said,<br />
when president of the CIO, " I do not know of a single solitary<br />
instance where a great technological gain has taken place in<br />
the United States of America that it has ultimately thrown<br />
people out of work. I do not know of it. I am not aware of<br />
it, because the industrial revolution that has taken place in the<br />
United States in the past 25 years has brought into the employment<br />
field an additional 20 million people."<br />
Page </p>
<p>Automation is the modern term for what is known as<br />
labor-saving machinery, but it is labor-saving not from the<br />
standpoint of throwing people out of jobs but from the<br />
standpoint of taking the backbreaking work off of the backs<br />
of the people of the world.<br />
Now, I would like in conclusion to reaffirm my trust in<br />
the partnership of Australia and the United States. We have<br />
in common a colonial background from which have grown<br />
two proud, great nations, united by fond memories and ties of<br />
warm friendship amongst ourselves and the United Kingdom,<br />
and nothing can ever sever that bond. We cherish similar<br />
ideals and spiritual values, and twice as allies we have mingled<br />
the blood of our sons in battle. Our mutual desire is only<br />
for good will among the peoples of the earth, but in any grave<br />
emergency, in the Pacific or elsewhere, the United States and<br />
Australia not only will but must stand resolutely side by side,<br />
and we shall not shrink in fear from encouraging further<br />
industrialization and technological progress, because we know<br />
that on the expanding economic strength of the free world is<br />
based mankind's best assurance of freedom and the deepest<br />
hope of a just and a lasting peace. Thank you.<br />
[ Applause]<br />
CHAIRMAN BULLOCK: Thank you, Mr. Secretary. I am<br />
sure you will agree with this: automation can perform material<br />
miracles, but it never can produce the greatest miracle of all<br />
a leader of men.<br />
And that brings us to our guest of honor, from a continent<br />
in the South Pacific as Governor Dewey said, a land<br />
mass larger than the United States -from a British cornmunity<br />
whose Queen is the same as England's Queen, from a<br />
Pacific power to which Asia is not the Far East but the Near<br />
Page 21 </p>
<p>North, from our gallant ally in two world wars and in Korea,<br />
our partner in the ANZUS Treaty and the Manila Pact, that<br />
sunny, friendly, admirable nation whose inspirational national<br />
motto is " Advance Australia"! [ Applause]<br />
And Australia's first citizen is a sterling product of his<br />
stalwart country. Born in Victoria, with degrees from Grenville<br />
and Wesley Colleges and Melbourne University, a brilliant<br />
scholar, a barrister at law, called to the High Court of<br />
Australia in 1918, made a King's Counsel in 1929, a Privy<br />
Counsellor in 1937, he holds a host of Honorary Degrees. He<br />
has the Freedom of the City of Edinburgh, the City of Oxford,<br />
the City of London. He has addressed both our Houses of<br />
Congress. He has been awarded our Legion of Merit. He<br />
was made a Companion of Honor in 1951.<br />
From the time he entered public life in 1928, he has<br />
had a remarkably distinguished career. He has held the same<br />
legislative seat since 1934. He was Attorney General from<br />
' 34 to ' 39, Prime Minister from ' 39 to ' 41, and, from 1949<br />
on, Prime Minister again. I ask you to rise and drink to the<br />
health of the man who has been Prime Minister of Australia<br />
longer than any other man in Australia's history, one of the<br />
most eloquent speakers you will ever hear, one of the ablest<br />
statesmen in the world today, a very great Australian: The<br />
Right Honorable Robert G. Menzies.<br />
To the Prime Minister of Australia!<br />
[ The audience rose, applauded, and drank the health of<br />
the Prime Minister of Australia.]<br />
THE RIGHT HONORABLE ROBERT GORDON MENZIES:<br />
Sir, the only undenied remark you made was at the very end<br />
when you said that I was an eloquent speaker. And having<br />
said that, you introduced me to a rostrum which so far as I<br />
Page 22 </p>
<p>can see represents the new technological age about which<br />
Secretary Weeks spoke. How can I make a speech to you<br />
when there is a red light in front of me which says, " Time,"<br />
and another one saying--in which there is no light at all,<br />
and another formidable looking gadget which says, " Set for<br />
length of speech," [ Laughter] and another one which, so far<br />
as I can tell, merely tells you what day of the week it is.<br />
[ Laughter] And then something down here where you might<br />
lean in the middle of a speech, not realizing that you might<br />
press the button marked, " Raise", or the button marked<br />
" Lower," or a much more mysterious button marked " Angle."<br />
[ Laughter] I think I ought to begin by saying to you that I am not<br />
an " Angle." I lost my angles long since. [ Laughter] Nor am<br />
I a Saxon. In fact, I am pure Celt, born in Australia. Now,<br />
Sir, I have listened with all proper embarrassment to the speech<br />
made by you, to the speech made by my young friend, who<br />
is still an old friend, Thomas Dewey, who has a curious sense<br />
of humor about me, and, of course, to the speech made by<br />
the Secretary from the highbrow state of the United States.<br />
[ Laughter] If I had to rely on all these things I confess that I would<br />
stand up, shut up, and sit down. [ Laughter] But two delightful<br />
things happened when I came here tonight. One was that<br />
the orchestra played " Waltzing Matilda," which is unquestionably<br />
Australia's national song, with a nice lilt in it, and<br />
the words which describe the activities of a sheep stealer,<br />
[ Laughter] but on all counts I like " Waltzing Matilda."<br />
Only a few days ago I was in Paris and to the intense<br />
astonishment of the denizens of Paris, who still haven't discovered<br />
whether it was Haile Selassie or the President of<br />
Nicaragua who was visiting them, [ Laughter] the red carpet<br />
Page 23 </p>
<p>was laid down and there was a guard of honor and a band,<br />
and the band played with all the verve in the world, " God<br />
Save the Queen," and then it played the Marseillaise, and then,<br />
as I walked along, it played " Waltzing Matilda." ( Laughter)<br />
I liked that enormously because it reminded me that a few<br />
years ago when I had been attending a conference in London<br />
and was not very well, the medical men said to me, " You must<br />
leave London, where the sun has not shone in the memory<br />
of man, and you must have a week in the sun before you go<br />
home." [ Laughter) As we went down to the hotel, my wife<br />
and I and my daughter, a hotel that was so exclusive and so<br />
expensive that when I looked over the cash register, I found<br />
that only film stars had stayed there in the last year or two.<br />
[ Laughter] They had a small orchestra in the best French<br />
manner, and the leader played the violin, and somebody had<br />
said to him, " This is an Australian." He therefore conducted<br />
some researches, and he got the score of " Waltzing Matilda,"<br />
and each night as we sat there in almost solitary state because<br />
it was out of season, he came along and he played " Waltzing<br />
Matilda,"' with so many roulades, so many crescendos, that it<br />
sounded like love song. [ Laughter] I have never forgotten<br />
it. So when I came in here tonight, I felt completely at home<br />
and then of course, for good measure, you have placed on<br />
the tables, wattle; and I must say that that is a touch which<br />
every Australian here tonight appreciates to the full, because<br />
though we are broadmninded and had to be when your Army<br />
occupied us during the War [ Laughter], we are at the same<br />
time bigoted. We are bigoted in favor of some of our own<br />
emblems. Sir, there is one other preliminary thing that I ought to<br />
say and it is this: that I had lunch yesterday in Rome and then<br />
I committed myself to the tender care of an American airline<br />
Page 24 </p>
<p>which I must say seemed to me to be highly efficient. We<br />
proceeded via Madrid and Lisbon to the Azores, which I discovered<br />
from my American friends should be called the<br />
A-zores I am not going to argue about that at all. [ Laughter]<br />
As we left the Azores the skipper made a rather cryptic<br />
remark to me about the weather. He said, " Head winds might<br />
be indicated," and at once, with long and bitter experience ( I<br />
wanted to raise no inter-Commonwealth argument over this<br />
matter) [ Laughter] I said, " Yes, I know what that means, we<br />
are going to Gander."<br />
He said, " Well, I hope not," but you won't be surprised<br />
when I tell you that, at some unearthly hour that morning at<br />
about 3 o'clock, the engines began to slow down. It obviously<br />
was many, many hundreds of miles from New York. I had<br />
read a little booklet that they put in the planes for our<br />
encouragement, " Prepare to Ditch without a Hitch," and I<br />
felt instinctively for my life belt, and the air hostess said to<br />
me, " We are landing at Gander." [ Laughter Gander-I<br />
must not quarrel with the authorities in Newfoundland-but<br />
Gander lacks charm. [ Laughter I thought, " Well, I am<br />
getting out of this plane. I must have a look at old Gander."<br />
[ Laughter] I don't think I ever crossed the Atlantic without<br />
visiting Gander. Gander wouldn't feel the same without me.<br />
And as I stepped out ( it was, I think they said, 2 degrees below<br />
zero) I met a distinguished Australian civil servant inside<br />
the as usual overheated waiting room, and I said to him, with<br />
all that air of gaiety that a man fobs up at 3 o'dock in the<br />
morning ( Laughter], " My dear fellow, how delightful to see<br />
you. Let's have a touch of brandy." I hope no teetotalers<br />
society will take exception to this, but I have my answer, because<br />
he said very brightly, " I'd love one, thank you very<br />
much." And we went along to the bar, but the gentleman in<br />
Page </p>
<p>charge was otherwise occupied and, just as he was about to<br />
arrive to give us our brandy, they said, " Your plane is ready<br />
to depart," and I left my friend from Australia without his<br />
brandy and without even a dollar to pay for one himself.<br />
[ Laughter] So I don't care for Gander.<br />
Now, Sir, there is one other thing I ought to say about<br />
my friend, Governor Dewey's remarks. He said something<br />
about the celebrated Reuter of Berlin, whom I had the great<br />
pleasure of meeting myself in 1948, and who was indeed a<br />
very remarkable man; but remarkable as I thought him to be,<br />
I had never thought or said anything as bad about him as I<br />
heard tonieht. To accuse a man of lecturing on economics is,<br />
I think, serious, but to accuse a man of lecturing on economics<br />
in Turkish seems to me to be about as uncivil a remark as you<br />
could make about any human being. [ Laughter] Then, Sir,<br />
references have been made, and very properly made to the<br />
comradeship which exists between the United States and<br />
Australia, and it is a very profound one.<br />
References have been made to this great comradeship.<br />
I very well remember before the war being here. I was then<br />
an eminently respectable Attorney General of Australia, and<br />
talking with the late President Roosevelt about Australia, and<br />
from time to time on the East Coast and the West Coast<br />
talking to ordinary private citizens, and there is no doubt<br />
about it that at that time this country was all compact of good<br />
will, as it always has been. Australia was a very remote speck<br />
in the world, and this last war seems to me to have changed<br />
all that. Too many hundreds of thousands of young Americans<br />
were in Australia, received into Australian homes, seen in their<br />
uniforms, heard of in their joint battles with Australian<br />
troops, for our countries-my country and the United States<br />
of America-to remain as merely distant communities. I<br />
Page 26 </p>
<p>venture to believe that those experiences brought about an<br />
intimacy, a sense of neighborhood, a sense of closeness, which<br />
could not have happened under any other circumstances.<br />
I would not like you to think that there was uniform<br />
satisfaction in Australia. Of course there was not. Whenever<br />
an Australian went into a restaurant and said he would like<br />
a grilled steak, he was as likely as not in those days to be told,<br />
" I am sorry, sir, but the Americans were here this morning."<br />
[ Laughter] When an Australian of sufficient youth and romantic<br />
spirit looked around to see what had become of his girl<br />
friend, he was as likely as not to be told, " I am sorry but the<br />
Marines arrived this afternoon." [ Laughter] But putting all<br />
these trifling inconveniences aside, there can be no doubt about<br />
it that no two nations, one very great and one very small,<br />
could ever have come closer together with more mutual respect<br />
and more profound affection than the United States and Australia<br />
in those crucial years. [ Applause)<br />
One other what I am fond of calling preliminary remark<br />
-and I will then say something else but I did hear a<br />
reference this evening to the great problems of tea and coffee.<br />
[ Laughter] I think it was the Secretary of Commerce who<br />
referred to this problem, and if so, I must say to him now,<br />
" Infidel, I have you on the hip," because we complained very<br />
bitterly in Australia about the rapidly rising price of tea, and<br />
when we inquired as to why tea costs so much now, the answer<br />
is, " Well, there is. a much greater demand for tea in the<br />
Ceylon auction sales, or wherever they may be." And when<br />
we say, " How does that come about?" the answer is, " The<br />
Americans are drinking tea." [ Laughter) That is a pretty<br />
solemn thought, because whatever you say and very properly<br />
about the quality of the coffee that one may get in this<br />
country, there is not one good word to be said for the quality<br />
Page 27 </p>
<p>of the tea one gets in this country. [ Laughter) And yet you<br />
have decided, perversely, to drink less coffee and to drink<br />
more tea, and the result is that on many an honest sheep station<br />
in Australia, the honest workingman has to wash his boiled<br />
mutton down with only 3 cups of tea, instead of 4, because he<br />
cannot afford the fourth. [ Laughter And all due to American<br />
perverse activity in the tea market! [ Laughter) I could not<br />
resist telling you that, because it is a matter no doubt to which<br />
you will desire to pay some attention. But do let me say<br />
this, because this, after all, is the Pilgrims.<br />
This is a Society devoted for many years to the cultivation<br />
of good relations, of mutual understanding between first of all,<br />
the United Kingdom and the United States, and in the broad<br />
sense, between the English-speaking people all over the world;<br />
and because I am the spokesman of one section of the Englishspeaking<br />
people of the world, and because I am fresh from a<br />
conference in London in which all the people of the British<br />
Commonwealth have been represented by the leaders of their<br />
governments, I just would like to say a word or two about that<br />
kind of problem.<br />
The first thing, Sir, that I would like to say is this: In<br />
the nineteenth century Great Britain was the dominating power<br />
in the world, and Great Britain had about her all her colonies,<br />
her own dominions, as they grew to be; and in the twentieth<br />
century Great Britain has about her countries like my own,<br />
British, as British as they could be no question of severance,<br />
no question of lack of unity, still believing as I do, and as I<br />
have said time after time, that we are one people. But in the<br />
twentieth century, in the inexorable course of history, the<br />
United States of America, once not only a colony but a series<br />
of colonies itself, the perfect product of what colonies can<br />
grow to be, has become the great and dominating power in<br />
Page 28 </p>
<p>the world. And that process, as men of imagination and sense<br />
looked at it, posed a great problem. Would the United States<br />
of America become a great power withdrawn from the affairs<br />
of the world, or would it become a great power accepting the<br />
price of power, which is responsibility and understanding of<br />
other people in the world? And to me the great revolution in<br />
the world in the last quarter of a century has been that this<br />
marvelous country has not only taken its power and made its<br />
power, but has accepted its responsibility with a humanity and<br />
a generosity and a warmth of understanding which I believe<br />
are not to be surpassed in human history. [ Applause<br />
Every now and then, you, who are American citizens will<br />
be told, and there will always be some scribbler who will be at<br />
pains to write it for you, that there is resentment about this<br />
development in the United Kingdom itself, or somewhere or<br />
other in the British world. I beg of you to forget about it.<br />
Battered Britain and Britain is still of all countries who took<br />
the shock of war, the most battered in the sense that it still has<br />
the toughest problems in battered Britain I never failed to<br />
find in the highest places and in the humblest a warm appreciation<br />
of the position of the United States and of the spirit<br />
of the American people. [ Applause And therefore I say to<br />
you, if I may arrogate to myself the right to speak for the<br />
people of the entire British Commonwealth, that your position,<br />
your spirit, your record, all these things, are perfectly understood<br />
and deeply appreciated by us, all Communist propaganda<br />
and neo-Communist propaganda to the contrary notwithstanding.<br />
[ Applause)<br />
The second thing, Sir, that I want to say, which I may<br />
need to elaborate a little more on, is this: we need not pretend<br />
to ourselves the world is not today sharply divided--not<br />
divided by our will, but by the will of others-sharply divided<br />
Page 29 </p>
<p>between those who, like ourselves, believe in the free life of the<br />
individual, and those who, like the other great group in the<br />
world, believe in the disciplined service of masses of people to<br />
whom freedom is denied. And this presents mankind with its<br />
greatest problem, the most terrible problem, in a sense, that<br />
the world has ever seen, and it presents problems to us, some<br />
of which, occasionally, we fail to perceive.<br />
We assume, don't we, the unity of the Communist world.<br />
We assume a unity of opinion and of force in the Soviet Union.<br />
We assume some dose community between the Soviet Union<br />
and Communist China. We assume this unity of the Communist<br />
world wherever it is, because wherever it is, it follows<br />
the Communist line. It does not speak with twenty voices.<br />
It speaks with one. The one voice may be the voice of a man<br />
or of ten men or of a hundred men, because whenever you get<br />
a multitude of voices, you can get them only by having a<br />
multitude of free people, and therefore there is one voice, the<br />
Communist line.<br />
We of the Democratic world try to follow the Democratic<br />
line, but the Democratic line is not one line but three hundred,<br />
and that is something we need to have in mind, because the<br />
whole object of an aggressive, genuinely imperialistic force<br />
like world Communism is to divide and conquer. It says, if<br />
we speak with one voice and we can get the other people to<br />
speak with two, or twenty, or forty, we may then get them to<br />
disagree with each other, and if we can get them to disagree<br />
with each other, we will have divided them, and if we divide<br />
them, we conquer them.<br />
In a sense, we play that game for them. In a sense we<br />
lend ourselves around the world to this kind of misunderstanding.<br />
So that one may encounter a perfectly normal, intelligent<br />
citizen of the United States who will say, " I don't like<br />
Page </p>
<p>what's going on in England," and in London one may hear<br />
somebody say, " You know, the Americans are behaving very<br />
badly over so-and-so," and so it gets whipped up. And what<br />
is the material on which all this whipping up of differences<br />
occurs? It is material selected by people, not as a majority<br />
opinion, but as an opinion loud enough to be heard. And the<br />
result is that I constantly find myself being told that because<br />
Jones or Brown or Robinson or the Blunderbuss, or the<br />
Free Times, or the Messenger, in the newspaper<br />
world has said so-and-so, that this represents the opinion of<br />
the people of the United States.<br />
What I am saying to you is simple enough. The whole<br />
glory of Democracy is that each man may speak his piece, and<br />
every newspaper may write what it cares to write. That is the<br />
glory of a Democracy. But we must always remember that this<br />
lends itself to the grossest misunderstanding in other Democratic<br />
countries.<br />
If I may take the simplest example: England has been<br />
playing Australia cricket with, I regret to say, the most devastating<br />
success. [ Laughter] We have had a first-class thrashing.<br />
But whenever a cricket tour of an English team in Australia<br />
begins, you don't suppose that we in Australia read in<br />
the cabled news what the nice things are that are being written<br />
by the visiting team, or about the Australian or about the<br />
Australian public. Not at all. You are given a carefully compiled<br />
selection of all the rather rude remarks that are being<br />
written by two or three people out of twenty or thirty. And<br />
the effect of this, of course, on people who do not know, is<br />
devastating. They say, " Don't you think the English press is<br />
behaving very badly?" " Don't you think the English people<br />
are being rather tiresome about these matches?" And in the<br />
same way they are being persuaded that, out in Australia, we<br />

<p>are just a miserable lot of bowlers and squealers, [ Laughter]<br />
though we are not, because I can assure you that when your<br />
magnificent Davis Cup team so superbly defeated us for the<br />
Davis Cup in Sydney, on its merits, with no equivocation, I Y<br />
don't think any team ever had a greater reception from the t<br />
people of Australia who watched all the play. [ Applause] p<br />
We must never abandon Democracy in order to preserve t<br />
it. But by misunderstanding in each other's countries the a<br />
effect of what is being said I therefore take it as a great f<br />
opportunity to tell you that I believe that both in Great Britain g<br />
and in Australia, and I am sure in all the other British coun-t<br />
tries in the world, there is a supremely dear and warm understanding<br />
of the view in the United States. I am perfectly 0<br />
certain that I may hope that in the United States it is well il<br />
understood that on all great things that matter in the world 1<br />
a this moment we are united as any two groups of people d<br />
could have been in the entire history of mankind. [ Applause) d<br />
Could I, Sir, just trespass on your time for a minute or V<br />
two longer to say this. References have been made to median-n<br />
ical matters. It would not be a bad study some day for some-I<br />
body to work out the effect of mechanical matters on public c<br />
opinion and on the history of nations. For example, I happend<br />
to be one of those people who believe that if, in the Republic<br />
of France, it were possible for a prime minister who thought<br />
he commanded public support and who was about to be defeated<br />
on a vote in the Assembly, if it were possible for him<br />
to say, " I ask you to dissolve the Assembly; let us go to the<br />
people," that the history of France would have been one of I<br />
immeasurably more political stability than we have seen. C<br />
[ Applause) C<br />
I must say, speaking as a prime minister, an ex-prime t<br />
minister and opposition leader, and a prime minister whoc<br />
Page 32 </p>
<p>will undoubtedly some day be an ex-prime minister again,<br />
[ Laughter] that there is much to be said in a time of difficulty<br />
when you are doing something that you believe in and that<br />
you think you could get the people to agree with you about,<br />
to be able to say, " Very well, let's have an election. Let the<br />
people decide this matter." The absence of any genuine power<br />
to dissolve in France is, I believe, one of the things that has<br />
affected the history of that country. I don't say that merely<br />
for myself, for I have discussed it with half a dozen distinguished<br />
French political leaders, all of whom have agreed with<br />
that view. Similarly, we in the British communities are in the habit<br />
of discussing policy, international policy matters of this kind,<br />
in such secrecy as can be got in a Cabinet meeting. You know<br />
what I mean by that. [ Laughter] At any rate, we do close the<br />
door and we discuss these matters. Sometimes, of course,<br />
there is speculation, and sometimes there is not, but on the<br />
whole, nobody can ever say that is the policy of the government<br />
until it is announced by the head of the government.<br />
That is important, because in the long run governments of any<br />
country ought to be judged not by speculations, but by their<br />
deeds. It is international deeds that give effect to international<br />
policy. Here in the United States, if I may say so, you are much<br />
more addicted to the hammering out of public policies by public<br />
discussion. It may be a very good thing to do. I admit<br />
that I have sometimes shuddered to think what I would do if<br />
I were in charge of foreign policy and had to go before a<br />
committee and be cross-examined. The committee would no<br />
doubt get great benefit from it. [ Laughter] But this happens<br />
to be your method. Just as we have a parliamentary executive<br />
called the Cabinet, so in the United States there is the divi-<br />
Page 33 </p>
<p>sion of power, and what I would call1 the nonparliamrentary t<br />
executive. V<br />
I don't sit down and argue about these things and want tok<br />
tell the United States it is wrong, or want to have the United a<br />
States tell us that we are wrong. All I am saying is, do let us e<br />
understand that there are these enormous technical differences t<br />
in the system of government, but the effect, of course, is that t<br />
while some policy is being heatedly debated in public, the<br />
citizen of Minneapolis may be perfectly certain that he will beC<br />
told that the voice of some opposition member at Westminster C<br />
is the voice of England, just as certainly as that the citizen of C<br />
Colchester or Whitstable I picked two oyster places in<br />
England [ Laughter] -is pretty sure to be told that what has<br />
happened in some newspaper in Chicago represents the con-C<br />
sidered public opinion of the people of the United States.<br />
Now, please, I say to you, do not let us fall for thesec<br />
things. The oldest truth since men achieved some right of C<br />
self-expression, the oldest truth since men achieved some capac-s<br />
ity for converting the affairs of the spirit into the affairs of<br />
expression is this: that amongst decent people around the world<br />
the elements of unity are immeasurably greater than the elements<br />
of disunity. Does anybody in his five wits suppose that<br />
if, in the wisdom of God, another great disaster came on<br />
the world, the people of the United States and the British people<br />
of the world would not be together, side by side, slugging<br />
it out? [ Applause) It is not to be contemplated. All I want<br />
to say is that when people know that if disaster comes, they are<br />
beside each other, with no arguments, [ Applause] they need to C<br />
be at some pains not to be misled by the devices of those who<br />
would divide and conquer. They need to remember that it<br />
takes a lot of work to maintain understanding. It takes a lot of s<br />
prudence, a lot of shrewd judgment, a lot of dry intelligence<br />
Page 34 </p>
<p>to get rid of the nonsense that will be put up by those who<br />
want to separate us. Look in all these matters that have been<br />
going on in the last few months. Haven't we all seen how<br />
anxious the enemy, whether he is abroad or at home, is to<br />
exacerbate whatever differences he may think he sees between<br />
the British view and the American view? Let us beware of<br />
this thing. I have just come from London, from a Prime Ministers'<br />
Conference, and a Prime Ministers' Conference is an odd sort<br />
of thing according to the onlooker, because we don't take decisions<br />
and we don't have votes, and many of our discussions,<br />
if you like, are inconclusive. But I do say this to you, that it<br />
is one of the most marvelous things in the world for seven<br />
or eight or nine men from all around the seven seas to sit<br />
down together with different backgrounds, with peoples of<br />
different colors, with peoples of different remote historical<br />
cultures, for them to sit down together all under the leadership<br />
of Her Majesty, the Queen, and to meet as heads of<br />
governments and to talk to each other, to argue with each<br />
other, if you like, but always as friends, exposing their differences,<br />
seeking their unities, but always refreshing their<br />
common faith in the great things that move men and women<br />
all over the world. If only we could extend this, if only we<br />
could feel that every now and then all these Prime Ministers<br />
could sit down with their American counterparts, what a good<br />
thing it would be; not reading a newspaper, not listening to<br />
a mob orator, not listening to somebody who seeks to create<br />
dissension, but sitting down as men and as brothers with the<br />
greatest responsibility among them for the peace and good<br />
living of mankind that any group of people have ever had<br />
since the world began. [ The audience rose and there was<br />
prolonged applause.] Page </p>
<p>CHAIRMAN BULLOCK: When you return to your wonderful<br />
country, Mr. Prime Minister, I hope you will remind your<br />
countrymen how much we like and admire them. They will be<br />
familiar with the tremendous admiration of every citizen of<br />
the United States for their great Prime Minister. Thank you<br />
for honoring The Pilgrims by being our guest this evening.<br />
[ Prolonged applause)<br />
