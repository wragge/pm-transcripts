PRIME MINISTER<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON PJ KEATING MP<br />
ARCHBISHOP JAMES CARROLL<br />
Archbishop James Carroll, a prince of the Catholic Church, was by every instinct<br />
and inclination a kindred member of the working community of Australia and who<br />
by his grace, charm and humility was a very special Australian and a very priestly<br />
man. He served the Catholic Church with distinction and materially progressed its<br />
interests in education, being always influential in the direction and delivery of<br />
government aid to the Catholic school system.<br />
He was always a believer in a moderate Labor Party, a party in touch with the<br />
aspirations of working Australians and one able to advance their interests.<br />
He was deeply committed to the poor, the low paid, to the families living<br />
perpetually with the tyranny of debt. He saw government support for them as<br />
central to their well being.<br />
Those who knew him well will miss him as a person and as a priest whose values<br />
and priestly qualities made him a paragon of the church to which he devoted his<br />
life. SYDNEY 14 January 1995 </p>
