Jj AUSTRALIA<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR PRESS 29 NOVEMBER 1978<br />
SECOND DERWENT BRIDGE IN HOBART<br />
The Prime Minister today expressed surprise ar the claims made by<br />
the Premier of Tasmania and Senator Wriedt that the Commonwealth<br />
Government was atteisting to modify its comAitment to the<br />
Second Hobart Bridge.<br />
Mr Fraser said: " I cannot see any foundation whatever for either<br />
Mr Lowe's or Senator Wriedt's suggestion. Twice in the past year<br />
or so I have made unequivocal public statements reaffirming<br />
the commitment of the Commonwealth Government to the construction<br />
of the proposed Second Hobart Bridge. If it is necessary, let<br />
me say again that the Commonwealth Government will provide funds<br />
for the construction of the bridge.<br />
" The Commonwealth and Tasmanian Governments appointed a Joint<br />
Committee of experts to design the proposed bridge and to advise<br />
on a number of related matters. The Commonwealth Government has<br />
paid all the costs incurred by that Committee.<br />
" The Committee has almost completed its work and is in the<br />
final stages of preparing its report to both Governments..<br />
One of the important matters which the Government has asked the<br />
Committee to advise it on is the date construction of the bridge<br />
should begin.<br />
" I do not believe it would be appropriate for the Commonwealth<br />
Government to make unilateral statements on the matters it has<br />
referred to the Co= ittee until after it has received the<br />
Committee's report and discussed the Committee's recommendations<br />
with the Tasmanian Government." </p>
