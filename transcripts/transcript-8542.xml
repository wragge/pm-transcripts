PRIME MINISTER<br />
ADDRESS BY THE PRIME HINISTERr THE, R( ON P J KEATING, XP<br />
TO THE INSTITUTE OF COMPWIE DZIECTORS r MELBOURNE,<br />
OUNZ 1992<br />
Z KO PROOF ONLY<br />
Well thank you very much Brian ( Loton), ladies and<br />
gentlemen. it is a pleasure to speak to the institute<br />
again, I have now had a happy association with It over<br />
nearly ten years and I used to assiduously atteand your<br />
funotions at Lenader, I think is the name of the place, when<br />
I was Treasurer, and I always found miembers at the Institute<br />
to be interested and enquiring and open to argument, and<br />
when you are in public life that Is the only audience that<br />
you basically warm to. So I appreciated, first of all you<br />
asking mes and for coming in much numbers.<br />
I thought I would, today, talk to you about Australia In the<br />
broad, about the economy, about our-society adstart with<br />
making a few refierence to Victoria. You don't need to be<br />
an economic analyst to know--that Victoria has been in a<br />
severe state of recession, of down-turn and on the<br />
unemployment figures we saw last week, Victoria and South<br />
Australia are the two states where unemployment is<br />
continuing to rise. This is not so around the rest of the<br />
country. tn the graphic illustrations of employment, in the<br />
statisticians release lost weak, we saw New South Wales with<br />
the rise of unemployment, and then it coming of f, the same<br />
also In Western Australia, in Queeneland plateauing but in a<br />
much lower level than In any of the other states. And one<br />
could reasonably assume that it, Queensland will feel the<br />
recovery again earlier and more strongly than some other<br />
places. And so the pattern In that in New South Wales,<br />
Queensland and Western Australia we are seeing a recovery<br />
more evident than we are seeing in Victoria and South<br />
Australia and we are seeing a deoline in unemployment arnd a<br />
pick-up in employment growth in those three states, but not<br />
so here and not so in South Australia. </p>
<p>Now, what is the reason for that? Well it is very hard to<br />
say and I know many people have sought to ponder that<br />
question, but I think the answer is that we are seeing<br />
structural change and cyclical decline, we are seeing a<br />
decline in the Victorian employment base coming from the<br />
cycle, and we are seeing a structure shift as the whole<br />
economy changes from what It was, and that was en economy<br />
where which was largely protected and where w6 hadn't the<br />
kind of Sophisticated Industries which we are now starting<br />
to soo emerging.<br />
I think there are a number of other reasons why Victoria is<br />
languishing. I shall just go through them. I think the<br />
first is, the 1980s notion that you could build employment<br />
off public sector spending, which In the end of course is<br />
unsustainable, secondly the debt hangover, which you may<br />
say, well it hangs over other states, I think I would bay it<br />
hangs over here moru particularly and even some of the<br />
businesses which may be known to headquarter themselves<br />
elsewhere, but financed out of Victoria, the problem of<br />
Stat, Banks, the problem of State Banks In the Institution<br />
of banking these days, end seeking to find themselves a<br />
place by being bankers, if not of last resort, near last<br />
resort, and the problems which has come from that; and the<br />
cyclical movement away from mfanufacturing, as I mentioned<br />
earlier; and the labour hoarding which wa6 promoted by<br />
lower labour costs in the 1900s. 1 think the combination of<br />
l@ ovur ' hoarding from low labour cost* in the 1960a and also<br />
public sector spending In Victoria ink the 1980s, had<br />
unemployment here in victoria, to its lowest levels in the<br />
Commonwealth in 1988-89. Levels that many of us thought<br />
were unsustainable and that I think because of the fact that<br />
Victoria was primed, pumped primed and then supported by a<br />
very ambitious financial sector, that the decline in the<br />
economy which hbucU ome from the recession, plus the<br />
structural shift, meant that the Correction in Victoria has<br />
been more pronounced and more profound than it has been in<br />
other states.<br />
well I suppose the question Is where do we go from here.<br />
Well I think the first piace we go from here ise the recovery<br />
In general. And we are seeing the recovery, in the three<br />
quarters to March we have had Just upon two per cent of nonfarm<br />
GOP growth. Now the budget has a forecast of 2.7 per<br />
cent, which would mean we would need .7 In the June quarter<br />
we may get It, we may not. flvt the economy is clearly<br />
growing again. And I notice today that the business Council<br />
of Au~ tralia or yesterday made a release which didn't rate<br />
that well in the newspapers, but It said; the Business<br />
Council considers that the economy is recovering, employment<br />
opportunitias well improved as a recovery becomes more<br />
broadly booed, this will only happen If the Government<br />
continues to lock-in low inflation and pursues microeuonomio<br />
reforms. The Business Council seem a consistent<br />
pattern of signals for recovery and economic activity over<br />
the next six months In its survey of member companies. And<br />
it goes on, signs of recovery and economic activity over the<br />
next six months are indicated in the 6urvey. in particular, </p>
<p>the majority of respondents expect Increases in Volume of<br />
sales, exports and revenues, there hag been a signif icant<br />
increase In the number of responbdents Intending to Increase<br />
stocks and nearly half of the Manufacturing respondents have<br />
upgraded pilans for capital expenditure. I think we should<br />
believe, reasonably, that a rooovery of substance to coming<br />
through. go that is the first thing about where do we go f rom here.<br />
As that general recovery comes through it is going to pick<br />
up, in part, Victorian commerce and Victorian activity the<br />
same as It is the rest of the economy.<br />
2 think secondly, we have got to push the restructuring on<br />
but get the volumes up. The now efficiencies which are<br />
coming in to industry, because the downside of those new<br />
efficiencies iS higher unemployment, the upside Is of<br />
course, greatly enhanced productivity. That from those new<br />
efficiencies we should be seeking to build volume and<br />
employing people in businesses with a greater volume base,<br />
albeit businesses which are more efficient* And Instead of<br />
seeking, as some people do in the debate, entrenched<br />
inefficiencies, In the belief that volumes will be held<br />
constant, but where in reality volumes will be slated to<br />
die. Now perhaps an example of that is in the motor<br />
Industry in this State. We are seeing the Ford Capri<br />
exported to the United States, work for people at the Ford<br />
Plant that would not exist In the old motor Industry. We<br />
are socin? the Toyota motor company establish a $ 400 million<br />
stae-f-e-rt plant, in part to export that vehicle, that<br />
Is the Toyota Camry. And we are seeing now engine<br />
praduotion, for export we would not have seen some years<br />
ago. in other words, the plants may not be employing the<br />
number of people they were employing in the 19809 but they<br />
now have an economic future, both at home and abroad that<br />
they would not have had, We are still producing In the last<br />
12 to 15 months or even in the highest times, a year or so<br />
ago, two years ago the same number of motor vehicles we<br />
produced In 1973, because there is simply buyer resistance<br />
to price, people won't pay the price to turn their car<br />
over. So if we are seeking to maintain an industry, built<br />
on a high-cost, low-efficiency basis of production and hope<br />
that by some, if you like, staging of that, come pause in<br />
the structural shift, that that will maintain employment in<br />
the State of Victoria, don' t think that is true. So the<br />
new efficiencies have got to be pressed on with, but we have<br />
got turn it into bigger volume$, And that simply meant<br />
focussing again on exports as well as tha domestic market.<br />
The third thing I think about where we go from here; Is<br />
defitiliq the role for Government In making markets work.<br />
And I put that in contradistinction to the 1980s Victorian<br />
view, which was for the Government to be a market itself,<br />
because It Is no stcret to any of you, that I argued over<br />
this point in the 1980s. There is a role for Governments in<br />
making markets work, we have seen it in the One flation<br />
eatement, which Brian referred to In his introduCtory<br />
remarks. In estab. lishing a new national rail highway, which </p>
<p>can Only be done by Government, trying to make the transport<br />
market, or the transportation market Work, LA~ a better<br />
interface between the ports and rail. Or separating power<br />
generation from distribution, tojproduce a true market for<br />
electricity. This is the thing abut the role of Governmrent<br />
and the DCA retor&amp; to it yesterday in its release talking<br />
about micro-oonomic reform, that Is keeping the changes<br />
coming through, again in contradistinction to the New<br />
Zealand approach, now adopted by my political opponents,<br />
where you basically turn the Å lam-thrower on the Industry,<br />
we have some sort of gigantic national funeral pyre, " n<br />
from the ashes emerges some phoenix even though we know that<br />
market force@ alone won't change the rail system, because no<br />
private Interest will Invest In it, or the ports or the<br />
power generation, etcetera.<br />
So I think those things: press on with the recovery; press<br />
on the with structural change In the efficiencis; get the<br />
volumes up; get the Governmient in there to break the lo-g-<br />
Jame in the market to get the efficiencies moving; anid try<br />
and keep the economy together and the community together in<br />
a sort of commitment to the change In general.<br />
Now we have heard a lot said about comparative advantage,<br />
and there is a lot of literature published In recent years<br />
about it. But It seems to me we have a number of<br />
comparative advantages In this country. There are at least<br />
five that one can think of: there is resources and food;<br />
there is space; there Is a trained workforce; a high<br />
quality Government R&amp; D base, if not a private ML bse; and<br />
proximlity to the Asia-Pacific: they are all things which we<br />
hove. Of these we all know about resources and agriculture, we<br />
have all been brought up on those industries, that is<br />
knowing about them. We know about a trained workforce, but<br />
we are only just learning the value of It, how to use it,<br />
and how to build it. Because In the post we have put too<br />
low a premium on that training and our trained workforce is<br />
in a stote of decline. It Is now changing, rapidly. This<br />
is good for us. In 1983, only three children in ten<br />
com~ pleted secondary school, this year that is nearly eight<br />
in ten and we have now created In since the iniddle-1980a<br />
120,000 univerbity places, or the equivalent of twelve<br />
cnpuses to take 40 per cant, just on 40 per cent of that<br />
stream of kids out in to universities. we are just a jot<br />
behind the United States In university places, as a<br />
proportion of the schooling, those finishing compulsory<br />
education and way ahead of most OECD countries. But we have<br />
been poor at the next stratum of our educational system,<br />
which is training and vocational education. Where we have<br />
got ki~ ds cascading out of school into the milk-bars, railway<br />
stations, shopping mall plazas, instead of In to a properly<br />
structured vocational education end training system.<br />
we have always though of trade, I think trade and vocational<br />
training as something not really going on beyond<br />
apprentIceships or riudiimentary skills. The notion that </p>
<p>adding value and sophisticated manufacturing or<br />
sophisticated services, required Sophisticated skills and<br />
that you couldn't develop one without the other, Is really a<br />
late development in our national thinking, but a development<br />
we nkow have to press on with. And It is not the answer to<br />
go back to dead-end jobs, as John Howard would have us do,<br />
but to leave that behind and continue with a ski lls based<br />
workcforce, an education system that takes kids beyond that<br />
sort of unskilled area we had In the 1960a and 1950s, In to<br />
skills jobs which we have shown they have been able to got<br />
when the economy Is growing.<br />
Go : think we have to take the view that It there In any<br />
resources boom in the future, It is not the resources boom<br />
that Malcolm Fraser and John Howard had in mind, of digging<br />
up) enother mound of minerals, or growing another paddock<br />
full of wheat, but a boom in intellectual resources, which<br />
we have at our hand, but have been, to date not fully<br />
prepared to utilige. And that is of course using the skills<br />
of our children.<br />
Now the legacy of the lost year. of opportunities Of the<br />
1970s was a nation unable to pay for its imports, and a<br />
nation with disappearing dead-end jobs. And so we have seen<br />
a rise in structural unam.. 2oye-t, which has been cis most<br />
apparent in this state as it has been in any other state.<br />
The lament should not be to go back to It and try and hang<br />
on to it, but again to press ahead with the skills based<br />
Change of new efficiencies in industries and to get the<br />
volumes going.<br />
Now I wanit to put this % heme to you because I have got now a<br />
very aggressive opponent and there was a time when I was<br />
very genteel at these sort of meetings, and If it is just<br />
after an election I think you are entitled to a couple of<br />
years of a very haughty diet of thoughts, but with in<br />
proximity of a poll I think some political factors ought to<br />
be brought to mind. But I want to put them in this<br />
important eo~ ial and economic context. I don't believe that<br />
we can produce the kind of country we are now in the course<br />
of developing; that to one with an external orientation,<br />
where a premiiumi is going on skills and research and<br />
development, in product innovation, in exports, in import<br />
competiLloa, exploiting the proximity of the Asia-Pacific, I<br />
don't believe that you can develop that sort of country from<br />
the stale mineral, agricultural reliant, low training, low<br />
levels of participation education base from the 1970s we<br />
have come from, without getting basically national<br />
commitments to these things. So what I am maying to you is<br />
I don't think you can run the place without some sort of<br />
consensus approach. Now whether you want to call it<br />
consensus or consultation or co-operation or tripartite<br />
commitment, uall it who% you like if we want to take<br />
ourselves from the industrial museum, the Coalition were<br />
happy to leave us In tor the better part of a couple of<br />
decades, an~ d take us to being what we should have always<br />
mainained our~ zlves as; a sophiaticateO economy, where the<br />
premi~ um wos on higher value products and services ani more </p>
<p>interesting jobs, then I believe you have got to have<br />
basically Agreements about those things. Now as you know,<br />
People have said well you have had that With the Accord<br />
process, with a conasensus model developed f rom the 1983<br />
Economic Summit, and the answer to we have. The claim then<br />
made is, It is these processes which have slowed structural<br />
change, economic change. my claim is a counter-claim, that<br />
the change we have been through Is quite profound, " n quite<br />
rapid and could only have been dons In this context. In<br />
other words, the consensus model, the co-operative model hats<br />
allowed change that we would not have had, but I bslieve<br />
change which he@ come more quickly. And that our opponents<br />
view, which is now the sort of New Zealand view or the<br />
Thatcher view, that you basically expose the place to markest<br />
forces and the devil will take the hind-moot, that there<br />
Isn't a job for Government moving to the creations markets,<br />
that there isn't of the Government lifting the participation<br />
market rates in echools, that there Isn't a job for<br />
Government remodelling the training of the skills-based<br />
system of the country, that there Isn't a job for Government<br />
with management pulling that together In to a competitive<br />
whole, I think without that kind of approach we won't be<br />
abla to do it.<br />
Now we have seen It under the Accord, with national income<br />
determination, with the share of national income going to<br />
profits and the share going to wages, with the wage<br />
flexibility we have developed In recent years and are still<br />
now developing, with the anti-inflation consensus, where for<br />
the first time in our miodern history, we have had the<br />
workforce of Australia committed to anti-inflation, low<br />
inflation objectives, the consensus to open the economy up,<br />
to take down the board of protection, to out a competitive<br />
exchange rate mechanism, to live with all the adjustment.<br />
pressures which were implicit in that shift, to a floating<br />
exchange rate and a policy position of positive<br />
discrimination In favour of employment which we saw In the<br />
1980s, when we were doing three times the OECD average in<br />
emiployment growth, is I think the kind of model Australia<br />
needs, and one in which It will prosper.<br />
we are now at the position where inflation, we have beaten<br />
the 20 year legacy of high infladiin, Wi -ooksd at the last<br />
quarter zero Inflation end 1.7 per cent for the year. At<br />
the Premiers' Conference last Friday, when we looked at the<br />
nominal payments to the States and calculated the real level<br />
of payments, the deflator we used, the Inflation forecast of<br />
the CPI for the coming year, was 1.7 per cent. I mean it is<br />
eons since Australia had that position and the maintenance<br />
of those low inflation rates and the attendant inflation<br />
rates that come with it, bill rates of 6 1/ 2 per cent, which<br />
we haven't seen ina a couple of decades, can power on the<br />
next phase of Australia's development. Paul Volker broke<br />
the back of American inflation in 1980, and gave America a<br />
decade of prosperity as a result. But American fiscal<br />
policy and ierican public policy in micro-economic change<br />
did not accompany that kind of shif t, and they have run in<br />
to bottle-necks in their society. That Is the nistekG we </p>
<p>II:;<br />
7<br />
are trying to avoid. But I believe, we will emerge from<br />
this recession to recovery with inflation at a sasinably<br />
low level, with basically a structural budget surplus, even<br />
though It is In cyclical deficit, but returning to surplus<br />
by the middle 19908, with now large changes at the<br />
enterprise level with enterprise bargaining, a willingness<br />
on the part of the organised workforce to change work<br />
practices, and on the part of management, management<br />
practices, and a focus again not on the easy resort to<br />
inflationary profits, but the generation of income, gives . us<br />
a unique opportunity to soore from this shift the recession,<br />
and to take Australia through the 1990a on a sustainable,<br />
reasonably high growth, low inflationary path.<br />
Now, what I put to you is our opponents put all that at<br />
risk. what they are saying, let's have an APPM approach to<br />
industrial relations,<br />
Where an employee an Individual person and a company will<br />
have to agree themselves to opt back into the Industrial<br />
relations system to maintain the benefits of awards<br />
protection. So es federal awards excpire so to does our<br />
holiday pay, working conditions, rates of pay and the rest<br />
and there signed up under common law contracts for<br />
industrial relations purpoases. That will produce industrial<br />
relations mayhem and the anti Inflation consensus we now<br />
have will go out the window as surely as it comes in and s0<br />
therefore I believe this sort of confrontation approach that<br />
ts the simple motion that market forces will fix the place<br />
when we know a lot of the problems are inaccessible like the<br />
rail system, the interface with ports the<br />
telecommunications, electricity, roads in all of these areas<br />
where basically market forcea haven't operated and can't<br />
properly operate without governments being involved or in<br />
training or in changing the nature of TAFE, lifting the<br />
status of our vocational education system, looking at<br />
training wages as we are now doing to employ more young<br />
people than we've employed in recent times. All of these<br />
things can only come by a process of involving employers,<br />
unions, State Government's and Federal Government's because<br />
the State 0overnmuents run most of the instrumentalities the<br />
Federal Government has got macro-economic management, Of<br />
It's essence It is consultationery as we saw last Friday at<br />
the Premiers ConfereefC In trying to got TAFE back on the<br />
table again to look at the national approach. it has to be<br />
a discussion and if we rely on market forces market forces<br />
won't do it because there is not a market working so I think<br />
that 5nlashing the coneensus or smashing a cooperative basis<br />
of working together to confrontationist and a product of<br />
political primatives who don't know how to make the society<br />
tick, that don't know where all the bits of power are and<br />
how to strand it together into a common thread which can<br />
work for Austrelia and its future. So what I think about Dr<br />
H! owson is he is offering no eocial consensus, he is offering<br />
you 8 funeral pyre, he doesn't understand keeping the<br />
society together, he says there to no role for government<br />
and the social consensus In things like the right to<br />
effcrdable education not the right to pay what your parents </p>
<p>can pay for a university piece not the right to go and put<br />
twelve thousand on the table to buy a place In the<br />
university but the right to a university education If you<br />
are smart enough and ommitted enough. The right of access<br />
to medical treatment, a universal right to health protection<br />
a right too often in this country denie4 to the poor who<br />
couldn't afford to worry about their health, Income support<br />
for families of particular low Income families the families<br />
in people in low skilled jobs with children; naturally<br />
income support for the unem~ ployed not tipping them offÅ after<br />
nine months and sending them down to St Vincent de Paul<br />
Society or the Brotherhood of St Lawrence or somebody else.<br />
Provision for the aged as the population &amp; ase providing for<br />
them in nursing homes, hostels se-oommodation home and<br />
community care for support at hoaie a decent standard of<br />
living in retirement by national savings put away to produce<br />
a retirement income. These are all the things that can<br />
deliver a more cohesive society a more responsive workforce<br />
and with It a commitment a low inflation enhanced<br />
productivity wage flexibility enterprise bargaining and<br />
basically Autralia coming together in a very cooperative<br />
way. So the Coalition doesn't haye the sophisticated view<br />
and on top of that it wants to add 6 7 percentage points<br />
to the price system from the goods and services tax which<br />
will lift the Inflation rats accordingly. which will not bs<br />
discounted for wages which In large part will go Into<br />
onigoing inflation and then straight away into interest<br />
rates. Because we all know if the Inflationary floor under<br />
Interest rates rises the nominal Interest rate rises and we<br />
are back to those sort of double digit interest rates which<br />
for eo long have retarded our investment and economic<br />
growth. So I conclude on this point and I am happy to take questions<br />
on these points. That basically we thinkc there is role<br />
for goverulit but it Is not the role of the government<br />
being Market. The role for government is to do the things<br />
I mentioned; re-build a national rail network, build the<br />
arterial roads, to establish a decent market for electricity<br />
to exploit that huge comparative advantage of a coal seam<br />
right the way down the east coast of Australia, to give<br />
Australia a decent tourist Industry, to have a rational<br />
airline policy, to develop a vocation and education system<br />
or In even the things which are government In the tax systea<br />
the providers we did In the One Nation statement. Private<br />
provision for public development bonds, accelerated<br />
depreciation for investment in this country, pool<br />
development funds. All of these things I think augur for a<br />
role, an interested sophisticated role for governmnent in<br />
society and rejecting the view that if business people want<br />
to deal with goveriviients want to create a better society,<br />
went to do something good and sensible that basically in<br />
some way they are offending some sort of tenent of economics<br />
of sort of Adam Smith Economics or so john Hewson put it<br />
when the busineas community spoke to us in the One Nation<br />
consultation's he said they were bludgera looking for a<br />
handout not that they were people intereuted In Australia<br />
looking for better national outcomes but bludgers looking </p>
<p>9<br />
( Or a handout. He said he was appled that business was<br />
asking for things, what I say to you Is what business has<br />
asked for in the last decade Is a rational set of policies<br />
the right to a Sensible discussion with Labor the goverrnent<br />
to take notice of the separations of these two principal<br />
groups in the economy and In doing eo while doing so<br />
building a social framework which people in this country<br />
believe will look after them regardless of their eoonomie<br />
circumstances. Now that's the sort of model I think will<br />
pull AUStralia through and while Victoria has languished in<br />
this recession those who want to take us back to those<br />
stultifying days of the early 8os or late 708 of* inefficient<br />
Industries of companies that can never hope to compete and<br />
Just watch even the dead end jobs disappear will be doing<br />
Australia a great disservice and the people that ought to be<br />
listened to are the ones that want to keep a structural<br />
change going who are not frightened by the consequences of<br />
some of the structural change and will keep driving on until<br />
we end up with a society which Is re-modelled wearing some<br />
of the adjustment costs on the way through but coming out<br />
the other side Into a low inflation competitive culture<br />
which will stand Australia Ina good steed, provide decent<br />
levels of employment, higher level of income and more<br />
Interesting jobs. it's basically out there but It Is not<br />
out there If we faltere It is not out there if we doubt it<br />
and it is not out there It we are not sure of our place In<br />
Asia, we are not sure Who we are and what we are and if we<br />
go and exploit the neighbourhood we live Ina and go out there<br />
as a proud competitive people not selling a second hand bill<br />
of goods but something now and Innovative and clever then<br />
there Is a placa for us.<br />
Than~ k you for listening, I will be happy to take questions. </p>
