PRIME MINISTER 27/ 92<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON. P. J. KEATING, MP<br />
MOCKERY OF ABORIGINAL DEATHS A NATIONAL DISGRACE<br />
The scene on television tonight of two police officers<br />
mocking the death of Aboriginal people was sickening.<br />
Their behavior brings disgrace on themselves, on their<br />
police force and~ on Australia.<br />
I think every decent Australian tonight will feel anger and<br />
shame at this incident.<br />
The Aboriginal Deaths in Custody report should have made<br />
Australians reconsider their attitudes to Aboriginal people<br />
and their circumstances.<br />
The episode iLn Bourke, and recent evidence of similar racist<br />
behavior in Sydney, suggests that for some Australians<br />
nothing has changed.<br />
Two weeks ago I told the Council for Aboriginal<br />
Reconciliation that I didn't want talk, I wanted changes,<br />
real changes.<br />
I told them -that we had to close the gap in living standards<br />
and we had to change attitudes.<br />
These incidents show how much the onus is still on white<br />
Australians to make that change.<br />
Whatever economic and material progress we make, whatever<br />
progess we make towards what we think will be a good<br />
society, wil. l be nothing if our attitudes to Aboriginal<br />
people contin-. ue to be no better than those of the 19th<br />
century. CANBERRA March 12 1992 </p>
