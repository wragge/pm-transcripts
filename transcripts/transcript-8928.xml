PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON. P. J. KEATING, M. P.<br />
DOORSTOP, FAIRBAIRN RAAF BASE, SUNDAY 8 AUGUST 1993.<br />
J: Prime Minister, you're off to N~ auru, is there any hope that you'll be able to<br />
settle Australia's long running dispute with that country?<br />
PM: Well, discussions have been taking place now for some time, months, so there's<br />
some prospect that we can get to a settlement yes.<br />
J. What else is on the agenda for your trip to Nauru?<br />
PM: Well its the broad agenda or'the South Pacific Forum and I think that because<br />
we do meet annually we keep fairly abreast of contemporary developments and<br />
I think also the value of it is often in the retreat where the various leaders and<br />
Prime Ministers can get to talk to one another about issues of concern to them.<br />
J: Will you be guaging support for a leaders' mecting of APEC countries?<br />
PM: No I don't think that's going to be a primary issue here but some expression<br />
may be given about it, anyway.<br />
J: How confident arc you ( inaudible)..., be able to solve the problem of Nauru<br />
without it having to go back into court?<br />
PM: I think it's possible to teach a settlement. We are the responders before the<br />
International Court of Justice and we know the parameters of this problem<br />
from the mining of super phosphate over such a long time and I do think, rm<br />
quite confident we'll be able to reach an amicable settlement,<br />
-What sort of-deal are we-offeing'to-themn?<br />
PM: Well, you'll have to wait and see I think.<br />
Prime Minister, what is your reaction to Mr Goss's comments..( inaudible)...?<br />
PM: Well I couldn't understand the point of him making them, to be frank. He I<br />
just brought a note on that subject he said in the Canberra Times, reported<br />
V1 % A tj I W_ I </p>
<p>-Tr-L H9 4: Ub No. UU3 F. U2lU<br />

today, he said that he was encouraged and relieved by statements on Friday by<br />
the Federal Attorney-General who said the Federal Government is commidtted<br />
to continuing co-operation with Queensland to ensure the Wik people's claim<br />
did not jeopardise a major investment project there. Well if he was encouraged<br />
arnd relieved I cannot see the point, when we've been negotiating with him<br />
privately in the course of last week and earlier weeks, to come and say things<br />
about it publicly.<br />
And could I say that Mr Ralph wrote to me this week saying that: " Our<br />
agreement with the Queensland Government calls for decisions to be taken on<br />
these proposed investments by the 31 st of December next."<br />
There was no mention anywhere of the 20th August so I just don't know where<br />
that date comes from at all. You see, this matter, as Mr Ralph says, he says<br />
" The Wik people's claim goes far beyond Mabo." And that's right. Mr Goss<br />
has some of the complexion that this is a Mabo matter. This is primarily not a<br />
Mabo matter. This is a claim by the Wik peoples claiming a breach of fiduciaryresponsibility<br />
by the State of Queensland as trustees for the Wik peoples' lands.<br />
And they're alleging that leases issued by earlier governments I think the<br />
Bjelke-Petersen government leases which were issued without due<br />
consideration of the trusteeship responsibilities of Queensland.<br />
Now, that makes the matter primarily a Queensland problem. Now, to the<br />
extent that there is any native title aspects to this the generic legislation the<br />
Commonwealth is now considering in respect of Mabo, that will cover this.<br />
But, the primary problem here is a claim by the Aboriginal people for a breach<br />
of fiduciary responsibility for Queensland and that can run back into the<br />
nineteenth century. So, Mr Goss has sort of put the complexion it's up to the<br />
Commonwealth. It isn't, it's up to Queensland. And we've said we'll cooperate<br />
in looking at it.<br />
But, can I also say that I don't accept that immediately a mining company says<br />
something everyone must spring to attention and then extinguish Aboriginal<br />
rights. No, the Aboriginal people believe they've got an entitlement to go to<br />
the High Court and have these matters tested. Well, think that is their right<br />
but to the extent that these things impinge upon major projects that's a concern<br />
. to. Ofe-has-got to-gethe balance right. But the primary problem here is<br />
because the Mabo debate's around and everyone now understands that it's<br />
around, it seems for some people relatively easy in the public debate to connect<br />
any Aboriginal matter to Mabo. Well, this one is not a primary connection to<br />
Mabo. This is a primary connection to the State of Queensland and the<br />
execution of its fiduciary responsibilities as trustees to the Wik peoples.<br />
Now, the states are often saying ' states rights this, states rights that' but as soon<br />
as therc is a problem they come runnin' home to mumma back to the </p>
<p>TEL: 9. Rug. 93 9: 06 No. 009 p. 03/ 0<br />
-3-<br />
Commonwealth, I mean, T get them at the Premiers' conferences and it's all<br />
about ' our rights'. But the moment they have a problem it's all up to me and the<br />
Commonwealth. Well, the only way to solve these things is cooperatively.<br />
And also solving them with an eye to the interests of the mining companies, but<br />
also the rights of Aboriginal people to be not just simply extinguished in a<br />
relatively thoughtless way to supposedly just facilitate some project. Now this<br />
is an important project and because of that we are cooperating in the<br />
investigation but the idea that it's going to be all loaded onto the<br />
Commonwealth when it's primarily a Queensland problem and the notion that<br />
the Commonwealth should indemnify companies for leases signed by the<br />
Bjelke-Petersen government is stretching credibility a fair bit, I think.<br />
J: Mr Keating, do you think Malcolm Fraser would make a good President of the<br />
Liberal Party?<br />
PM: Well, the Liberal Party has lost its way and Malcolm Fraser sat for seven key<br />
years in Australia's post ' War economic history and let us become an<br />
uncompetitive economy relying on minerals and energy and grains and Wool.<br />
And that let Australia down very badly. And the notion, he rejects the notion<br />
of the opening up of Australia's markets-, he rejects the notion of a more<br />
competitive economy coming from lower protection; he rejects the notion of an<br />
open financial market; and if the Liberal Party go back to Malcolm Fraser<br />
they're really going back to the past. Now Malcolm's got some views on other<br />
things that I don't mind but on primary things, on economic things, that is on<br />
things like protection and Australia's fu~ ture in the world as an open trading<br />
society it is a trip down the time tunnel with Malcolm Fraser. But, the Liberal<br />
Party too, it keeps going back to its elder statesmen, people. You see this in<br />
the New South Wales Liberal Party, you can see it pretty well across the<br />
Commonwealth.<br />
J: There's a suggestion that Jeff Kennett might be thinking of entering politics to<br />
take over the federal leadership. What do you think of that?<br />
PM: Oh well, we can absorb any culture up here. Even Jeffery.<br />
J: Prime Minister, to the problems of this morning, were there any security<br />
problems highlightcd by what happened?<br />
PM: No, I don't think so, no. Someone parked a car out the front -but vigilance<br />
does matter and that's, I think, all that happened.<br />
ENDS. </p>
