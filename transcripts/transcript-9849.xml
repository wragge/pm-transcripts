TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
PRESS CONFERENCE, INTERNATIONAL PRESS CENTRE, APEC, OSAKA,<br />
JAPAN, 19 NOVEMBER 1995<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
PM: Today's meeting of the APEC Leaders, the adoption of the Declaration<br />
and the Action Agenda showed that APEC could deliver, and that the very<br />
firm and visionary commitment taken at Bogor in Indonesia a year ago,<br />
under the Chairmanship of President Soeharto those firm objectives of<br />
free trade in the Asia-Pacific by 2010 for industrialised countries, and<br />
2020 for developing countries those commitments were reinforced here<br />
today in those two statements. It's an outstanding result, it's one that<br />
keeps the strength of the Bogor commitment reflected now in the action<br />
plans, and in the Action Agenda, and will give President Ramos at the<br />
meetings in The Philippines the opportunity to then put flesh on the<br />
bones of those commitments towards the individual action plans. So, It's<br />
taking the prospect of shaping the growth of the Asia-Pacific by closer<br />
integration of economies, giving it so much more definition more rapidly, I<br />
think, than almost anyone could have expected just a couple of years ago.<br />
In Australia's terms, of course, we will have from this the benefit off an<br />
outstanding result in terms of additional growth and jobs, and closer<br />
integration with the neighbours in the region.<br />
The other thing I think which * is significant about it, is that not only has the<br />
Declaration and the Action Agenda here at Osaka provided the means to<br />
get to the Bogor objectives, but more than that, it's delivered a down<br />
payment on that aim of very significant proportions. And we have seen<br />
today a couple of very significant trade packages liberalisation packages<br />
announced, one by Japan, and one by Indonesia for instance -and putting<br />
a big advance down on the Uruguay Round, is something I think the<br />
APEC leaders feel very proud of. This, after all, was attempted at the </p>
<p>Halifax G7, and didn't go anywhere, but it has gone more than<br />
somewhere here.<br />
The other thing I would say is there is a tremendous attitude on the part of<br />
APEC leaders. And that is that they meet as leaders, and there is now a<br />
great amount of trust and a good relationship between them. And the<br />
thing that marks APEC out from other trade liberalising bodies, is that it<br />
has decided the end points. In the Uruguay Round, and the WTO0, there<br />
were never any end points decided. It has decided the end points, and<br />
therefore APEC has agreed that there will be a process beginning now<br />
which will then move towards those end points which are agreed. So it<br />
has the Leaders Meeting to drive the process, the authority of the leaders.<br />
and the ambition of the leaders to drive the process where, of course, in<br />
the GATT and the Uruguay Round It was invariably Trade Ministers or<br />
sometimes Foreign Ministers, and you could never get the authority there<br />
that you get from Heads of Government or Heads of State.: So, it's getting<br />
that impetus, and it's got by these regular annual meetings everyone<br />
gets to know one another, there is a great deal of trust and goodwill<br />
towards each other, and that political authority is then being brought to a<br />
process which has already fixed end dates. So, this makes the APEC,<br />
process completely different to any other.<br />
There was some additional things said today, and that is that.. . a couple of<br />
other proposals. For instance, on behalf of Australia, I put down a<br />
proposal to develop a working group on food security. This will be one of<br />
the problems as we see the Asia-Pacific area grow potential shortages<br />
of foodstuffs, and what that dimension might be, and what strategies that<br />
might be put in place. There was a discussion about macro-economic<br />
issues as well. But by and large, I think the model we have chosen that<br />
is, from the start, the end point understood, and then a voluntary<br />
approach concerted liberalisation to get down to the end points is a<br />
mature process, it's one which relies upon the goodwill of the leaders<br />
themselves and their own voluntary commitment to the end points, and<br />
one that I think judging by the size of the packages announced today is<br />
going to get us there, and get us there very adequately.<br />
I would like to take the opportunity on this occasion also to thank a<br />
number of people. I would like to thank Prime Minister Muraysma, who<br />
has done a first class job of bringing the stewardship of the APEC agenda<br />
here at Osaka to this point, supported as he has been by MITI Minister<br />
Hashimoto, and Foreign Minister Kono they were both significant in this.<br />
I would like to also thank my own Australian Ministerial colleagues, Bob<br />
McMullan and Gareth Evans, and I would like to particularly thank the<br />
officials we have had working on this throughout Peter Grey, our senior<br />
Official, Mike Costello and all the other Department of Foreign Affairs and </p>
<p>Trade Officials, Allan Gyngeli in my own office. Michael Thawley in PM&amp; C<br />
and David Ritchie also in that Department, as well as other Departments.<br />
I would also like to thank the members of the Pacific Business Forum,<br />
particularly Imelda Roche and Phillip Brass, and Neville Wran who, of<br />
course, was the Australian person on the Eminent Persons Group. Its<br />
been a very big effort now, really from 1992, to get this to this point, and<br />
getting that clarity at Bogor, and then moving it along to here, has<br />
required a lot of political, ministerial and bureaucratic effort over the<br />
course of the year, but the product is there, I think, for all to see, and the<br />
Osaka Action Agenda is a very high quality piece of policy making.<br />
J: Prime Minister, was there any. ( inaudible)... . in the meeting from the end<br />
points?<br />
PM; None whatsoever.<br />
J: Do you have reason to believe that Malaysia will work very hard to fulfil Its<br />
commitment to a free and open economy by the year 2020?<br />
PM: I have no reason, from anything Prime Minister Mahathir said today to<br />
believe other than his commitment to the Declaration, and to the Action<br />
Agenda.<br />
J: Prime Minister, how much pressure do your declarations today put on the<br />
rest of the world to free up trade, particularly at the WTO talks?<br />
PM: Well, APEC already represents over half the world's GDP. From memory,<br />
I think in a decade's time we are forecasting that to be around<br />
percent of world GDP. It's obviously, this very strong political commitment<br />
today, and the definition of the commitment, means I think APEC is the<br />
only body in the world now holding up the prospect of general trade<br />
liberalisation. And this must put pressure, over time, on Europeans in<br />
particular, to match some of this.<br />
J: Prime Minister, could you just tell us what importance you attach, and how<br />
you rank, the Chinese initiative today on tariffs?<br />
PM: I think that there is a general... .1 made this point in the meeting today<br />
about the GATT processes and APEC. At the GATT, the negotiators turn<br />
up and they say " we have got four cards", and someone says " wVell, have<br />
you only got four, or perhaps five? And if you really squeeze us, six?"<br />
But of course, there is still four cards in their pocket. What has happened<br />
at APEC, is we are saying we are putting ten cards down by 2010 and<br />
2020, and we are going to lay the cards out on a timeframe, on a process<br />
of concerted liberalisation. And the Chinese package, the Indonesian </p>
<p>package, the Japanese package are steps along the way of the individual<br />
action plans that will get the ten cards laid. So again, it gets back to the<br />
point I made earlier about the end points being defined. If the end points<br />
are defined, the road to the end points becomes more obvious, and<br />
therefore, national Governments can work on individual plans to get<br />
there, you know, looking at the needs of their economy, their<br />
commitments under APEC and generally, the need to resource the area.<br />
The great challenge, I think, for those of us who live in this part of the<br />
world, is resourcing the growth needs of East Asia. And as these<br />
economies get to a bigger base, when they were smaller growing by 8-<br />
phenomenal as that growth is of a small base, the resourcing<br />
requirements are manageable. But when the bases start to get big, and<br />
you are still getting large increments to growth, the resourcing<br />
requirements then become mammoth massive so it means the<br />
impediments need to be cleared away to get an appropriate free<br />
movement of resources. And of course, more efficient supply side<br />
economies to be able to deliver them. The prospect of continuing growth<br />
in I think, particularly in East Asia means that the supply response in<br />
the United States will be strong. Already, exports to East Asia and the<br />
United States are growing at twice the rate of East Asian exports from<br />
East Asia to the United States, and we will see the same sort of supply<br />
response from a lot of the economies in the region as they complement<br />
one another towards a better level of general resourcing to keep growth<br />
going. And with that growth will come income growth, and the more even the<br />
income growth, the better will be the cohesion of communities, the better<br />
will be the degree of harmony between economies, and of course, that is<br />
essentially the core thing that we are trying to do here integrate our<br />
economies, have higher standards of living, better jobs, higher quality<br />
employment, and more of it.<br />
J: Prime Minister, what does this mean to Australian exporters on the one<br />
hand, and consumers on the other?<br />
PM: I think it means for Australian exporters more opportunities, and I think<br />
that means, for consumers, in the ends more jobs, more growth, and by<br />
integration obviously more variety, and hence more interesting jobs. This<br />
has a direct impact on the prosperity of all of our economies, and it's why<br />
it has always needed that sort of political horse-power to break it through.<br />
And that's what I think you are seeing confirmed again today.<br />
J: Two questions if I may Prime Minister first, you said the end points are<br />
known, but can I ask you what you understand by free trade and<br />
investment does it mean zero tariffs, and zero non-tariff barriers by the </p>
<p>target years? That's the first question, and the second one is it's<br />
obviously difficult to compare these initial offers, but do you think there is<br />
a sort of rough or broad comparability in what's been put on the table so<br />
far?<br />
PM: Well, it's got if you read the Action Agenda, you will find in it very clear<br />
statements about the process, and about comparability. It says on page<br />
four each APEC economy will begin to develop its action plans<br />
immediately, after the Osaka Leaders' Meeting. Action plans will contain<br />
specific and concrete details with time frames for the near to medium<br />
term, while outlining the basic directions of 2010 and 2020. Each APEC<br />
economy will submit its action plan to the 1996 meeting, overall<br />
implementation will begin as of January 19971 and then it talks about<br />
transparency, and the mutuality of effort, and the process of review. And<br />
it deals with the review question very directly. Under transparency, it<br />
says each APEC economy will ensure transparency of its respective laws,<br />
regulation and ministry procedures which reflect the flow of goods, etc.<br />
APEC economies under non-discrimination will endeavour to apply the<br />
principle of non-discrimination between and among them in the processes<br />
of liberalisation. Some of that sentence is code for the status of China<br />
and MFN with the United States, but the commitment amongst the others<br />
is very clearly will apply the principles of non-discrimination between<br />
them. On comparability, APEC economies will endleavour to ensure the<br />
overall comparability of their trade and investment liberalisatlon<br />
facilitation, take into account the general level of liberalisation that's<br />
amongst the others and facilitation already achieved by each APEC<br />
economy. It should be WVTO consistent, and comprehensive.<br />
So, you know, in the language of international declarations and<br />
communiques, you don't get it much more solid than that. And I think<br />
that's why... I mean, as a veteran of umpteen OECD, IMF meetings, World<br />
Bank meetings particularly in and out of the GATT Round over the years<br />
this is almost strange language, it's so direct.<br />
J: ( inaudible)...<br />
PM: Well, I think what we are seeking to do is to open the barriers, and to<br />
facilitate trade and to facilitate investment. A lot of investment facilitation,<br />
of course, will get back to things like national investment policies,<br />
opportunities for people to invest in particular projects, in particular<br />
industries these sorts of issues. So there is no actual definition of what<br />
free means, in that sense, but we know what it means in terms of the<br />
commitment. That is, so that we can freely invest In one another's<br />
economies, and make it work. </p>
<p>On tariffs, there has been no discussion amongst members about whether<br />
free means zero tariffs, or 5% or 10%. If you look at Indonesia's package<br />
today, it's talking about every tariff above 20% gets to 20% by a certain<br />
time, everything between 20 and 0% goes to 10%, and then by another<br />
date, everything above 20% now ends up at 10%. So, you know, once<br />
you are down to those sorts of levels of tariff protection, you're not -I<br />
mean, the daily exchange rate fluctuation is worth more than the 5% tariff.<br />
So I don't think there is any point about zeroes or fives, but there is a lot<br />
of point about forties, and sixties, and hundred and twenties, and two<br />
hundred and forties.<br />
J-Prime Minister, according to Japanese officials, the issue of security was<br />
raised at regional security -was raised at this mornings discussions.<br />
Could you give us some idea of the points that were discussed, and how<br />
that related to APEC's particular mission?<br />
PM: I can't recall it being raised, other than that, obviously, if you take the<br />
leadership of the countries that are represented here, who now meet<br />
regularly, they obviously get to know one another on a personal basis,<br />
and I think that's meaning that we are starting to see things.. . we are<br />
starting to see a lot of movement. For instance, President Jiang Zemin<br />
visited Korea recently, we are seeing so much more movement between<br />
APEC leaders or leaders of the countries In the APEC are and 0 would<br />
like to think that part of that is the fact that they have got to know each<br />
other quite well at APEC meetings. And there is a real enjoyment<br />
amongst the leaders about seeing one another again, and sharing each<br />
others company.<br />
J: Prime Minister, at a number of bi-lateral meetings that you had with<br />
leaders yesterday, you expressed concern about President Clinton not<br />
coming here. Do you believe that he should have come, despite his<br />
problems back home?<br />
PM: Well, it is a very idealogical matter for the United States, and a political<br />
matter to decide what the shape of American public policy is, and how the<br />
Budget is, and I can understand the weight and gravity of that. But I was<br />
disappointed, of course, that the President wasn't here, and there has<br />
been some discussion about the fact that on the Republican side there<br />
was a view that this was the weekend to bring this matter to a head. Well,<br />
the point I would make is whether that is true or not, the United States as<br />
a country has had to deal with its domestic problems at the expense of<br />
the President's attendance here, and that I think is a disappointing<br />
development. That said, the President made certain that he was in touch<br />
with the APEC leaders of course, Prime Minister Murayama, and he had<br />
the Vice President attend in his place. And Vice President Gore made </p>
<p>very firm commitments on the part of the United States in the meeting<br />
today, saying that is, expressing the commitment of the United States<br />
to its continued engagement with East Asia, of its continuing commitments<br />
to APEC, and I am quite sure given those assurances that we will see<br />
the President's attendance at the meeting in the Philippines next year,<br />
when we get onto the individual action plans. But one thing is clear, I<br />
think. from today's meeting from here on out, APEC has reached its sort<br />
of critical mass, and gone solid, and it will only solidify further after Subic<br />
Bay next year, and the commitment of the United States President<br />
through his Vice President is, I think, was an assuring contribution to the<br />
meeting.<br />
J: Prime Minister, have you had a chance to discuss with the other leaders<br />
here your proposal for a panel to talk about security in a post-nuclear<br />
world?<br />
PM: I raised it with Prime Minister Murayama. That is, Australia was involved<br />
in the Chemical Weapons Convention, wherein we removed one whole<br />
category of weapons. And if we can remove a category of weapons and<br />
given that the I think it would be generally agreed that the verification on<br />
chemical weapons would be more difficult than nuclear weapons, it is<br />
possible obviously to get the stockpiles down, and remove nuclear<br />
weapons. Now, of course, this would involve a complex discussion about<br />
deterrents and deterrents policy during the wind-down, but there are now<br />
50,000 nuclear warheads out there. And I think there is a view amongst<br />
the nuclear states that there is the group of them who have these<br />
weapons, and there are the rest of the nations who do not. That's of<br />
course, not as it will be. There will be a much larger group that will have<br />
the weapons. It won't be just the handful of nuclear states now it will be<br />
a much larger group. So, the choice is between the handful, and the<br />
great mass of countries that don't have them, but between them are a<br />
much greater number of countries who have nuclear weapons. So<br />
Australia has though this is the opportunity to actually given the concern<br />
about French testing in the Pacific, and Chinese testing to actually go<br />
beyond the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, and the cut-off convention,<br />
to actually start taking the inventories down. And I raised this with Prime<br />
Minister Murayama yesterday, and received a fairly positive response<br />
from him.<br />
J: Prime Minister, who would you see being involved in that task force, and<br />
how do you see it operating?<br />
PM: Australia is putting together a group of prominent International people<br />
who have had an experience in arms control issues in defence policy, in<br />
international geo-politics, and at some point, will be announcing that </p>
<p>group, and charging them tasking them with the job of starting to put a<br />
bit of a map down for us about which way we might tackle the problems.<br />
J: ( inaudible)...<br />
PM: No.<br />
J: Prime Minister, if 1 could just follow up something which my colleague<br />
there asked about comparability, and also really about free trade. I can,<br />
you have talked a lot about these end points, but obviously we are all<br />
intrigued as to how eighteen economies in APEC actually share the same<br />
goal? I mean, the great free trader, which is China, can hardly share the<br />
same destination as the United States at this point. But anyway, my<br />
question is a question of comparability you have singled out Indonesia<br />
for praise for this detailed and ambitious plan it has Identified today how<br />
does this compare with, for instance, what the United States has put out?<br />
And, as far as I am aware and correct me if I am wrong there has been<br />
no indication that the United States is going beyond any commitment, or<br />
concession, it has already made under GATT. Now, how do these two<br />
things compare?<br />
PM: Well, these are commitments freely entered. And Bogor was. a<br />
commitment was made by the President of the United States, and in these<br />
documents, the commitment is there from the United States, too. I don't<br />
find it remarkable at all that the lesson of getting the right<br />
complementarity and resource allocation in a region that is growing as<br />
fast as this is all that remarkable. There is an obviousness about it that is<br />
though as we all know perhaps through some of the dismal periods of<br />
history that obvious or not, these things haven't happened. The thing<br />
about this is it is happening people do see the opportunity, they do think<br />
it is something they should do, and they are making commitments as<br />
Head of Government and Head of State level. And I think it Is that<br />
political impetus the fact that it is not left to Ministerial haggling, or<br />
bureaucratic incrementalism, but rather being driven by the leaders<br />
themselves is the difference here.<br />
J: Prime Minister Keating, the on a matter that is related to trade, and it is<br />
the waterfront dispute in Australia I was wondering what you think of the<br />
involvement of your predecessor former Prime Minister Bob Hawke in<br />
the attempts to resolve the dispute? And do you think that he wiAll be able<br />
to bring his background and experience in industrial disputes to resolve<br />
this matter?<br />
PM: Well, the Government has taken charge of the issue itself, and though<br />
commitments were made by the company and by the trade unions last we </p>
<p>which led the Government to believe would be capable of resolution<br />
before weeks end, when that was obviously not to be so, I ' spoke to the<br />
Minister for Industrial Relations, who of course then opened up a<br />
discussion with the President of the Arbitration Commission, President<br />
O'Connor. And as you know she has called a compulsory conference,<br />
and as a result of that call, already the waterfront stoppage as shortlived<br />
as it was has ceased. So, the Government has taken the issue<br />
over through those processes, and I expect the parties of course to come<br />
along and to appear. I mean, the company has been quite wilfully going<br />
its way now seeking to secure the non-unionisation of sites through<br />
discriminatory wage packages, and the ACTU for its part, while in<br />
dispute with the company sought to engage, of course, many other<br />
parties by a broad national stoppage, which of course didn't find favour<br />
with the Government. Now it will go to the Commission. It will go to the<br />
Commission, and the Commission will amongst other things adjudicate<br />
on the central point, about whether there should be, and can be, any<br />
discrimination for equal work and equal pay equal pay for equal work.<br />
And given the Commission'* s record on this point of discrimination, or nondiscrimination,<br />
I don't think it particularly if you were a betting person,<br />
you wouldn't particularly need to concern yourself too much about who<br />
the advocate was. I think Marcel Marceau could almost get this one<br />
through. Can I just say, though you asked me about Bob Hawke. If he<br />
can help in this, and the unions feel comforted by that experience, then I<br />
think that's a good thing.<br />
J: Mr Keating, has the waterfront dispute embarrassed you at this APEC<br />
conference, and secondly, is it possible to quantify the benefits which will<br />
flow to Australian farmers from today's decision?<br />
PMV: Well, no the answer in the first instance is no. It's just part of our<br />
industrial relations scene we have got the lowest level of Industrial<br />
disputes in Australia this year [ it was] last this low in 1940. And I would<br />
think just about one of the lowest in the OECD, if not the lowest. But, in<br />
any economy our size, there will always be some industrial problems. As<br />
far as the Australian agricultural sector is concerned, in raising this issue<br />
of food supply, food security, today, and looking at some of the problems<br />
through a working group, obviously we mean to get a better definition on<br />
this. But I can't see it being other than providing opportunities for<br />
Australian agriculture to lift their supply capacity to the region, and to<br />
participate in it.<br />
J: Mr Prime Minister, reportedly the Government of France is going to hold a<br />
nuclear bomb testing tomorrow are you going to take a specific action on<br />
this matter? </p>
<p>PM: Well, we have. AustraIi a's made the strength of our feelings and our<br />
actions known. We have supported, of course, expressions of<br />
condemnation, and multi-lateral bodies such as the Commonwealth<br />
Heads of government meeting last week, and in the UN. And apparently<br />
the President of France was very peeved about the fact that some of his<br />
European colleagues made similar expressions over the course of the<br />
week. I think there has been pretty general, broad, world-wide<br />
condemnation of this action, and there will be for a subsequent test. One<br />
more question, I think, and we'll go.<br />
J: Just on the industrial dispute in Australia I'm wondering if you are<br />
disappointed that the ACTU hasn't been able to call off the coal strike<br />
ahead of tomorrow's Arbitration Commission hearing?<br />
PM: Well, CRA had the opportunity of settling this matter last week and<br />
decided not to. They understand what the industrial imperatives in this<br />
are, but, of course, they will be parties before the Commission on<br />
Monday, and hopefully if that process works well.. . but as I say, if it is<br />
around the question of discrimination, around the question of equal pay<br />
for equal work, I don't see the Commission being able without I'm not in<br />
a position to judge this, because this is the Commission's matter but I<br />
don't see the Commission being able to say " yes, we will have non-equal<br />
pay for equal work", for instance. And, presumably, the parties would<br />
accept the Commission's findings in which case, of course, the disputes<br />
would be over. Thank you.<br />
ends. </p>
