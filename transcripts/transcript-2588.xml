PRIME MINISTER<br />
INDUSTRIAL LEGISLATION<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE RT. HON. WILLIA4 McAhHON<br />
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, CAIBERPA 1AY 10, 1972.<br />
Mr Speaker, as my colleague the Minister for Labour and<br />
National Service said when introducing this Bill, it contains the<br />
most significant amendments to the Act since 1947. I think it is<br />
timely to remind the House and indeed the community of the long<br />
history of significant legislation that Liberal-Country Party<br />
Governments have passed over the years since coalition came to<br />
power in 1949. Just as the Rill now before the House has two broad<br />
reasons concern for the community and concern for the individual<br />
worker so has all of the legislation introduced by successive<br />
Liberal-Country Party Governments since 1949. It was Liberal-Country<br />
Governments which really made workable the secret ballot legislation<br />
which had been introduced by our predecessors.<br />
The legislation that we brought down in the early fifties put<br />
into the hands of rank and file unionists the opportunity of ensuring<br />
good Government in their organisations. By legislation, they have<br />
been able to ask for elections to be conducted by independent<br />
officials. They have been able to have the Court enquire into<br />
irregularities in ballots. It is a Liberal-Country Party Government<br />
which ensures a viable sanctions process under the Conciliation<br />
and Arbitration Act.<br />
Whilst over the years we have stood firm on the principle that<br />
there must be sanctions or fines to deal with industrial lawlessness,<br />
we have been realistic enough to make changes in that process as<br />
the need to do so has arisen. We have approached the question of<br />
sanctions or fines with resolution but we have sought to provide under<br />
the Act every opportunity for parties to resolve their differences<br />
by the traditional processes of conciliation and arbitration. We<br />
have sought to give every opportunity to a union to resile from<br />
strike action and so avoid a penalty being imposed on it. However,<br />
as the Minister pointed out in his second reading speecn, if that<br />
opportunity is not taken then a union must face the conscu. vnces<br />
under the Law. It has been said that the sanctions process . Las fallen<br />
into disrepute. At one point of time there might have been some<br />
truth in that statement. However, that is no longer the We<br />
are determined to ensure that if fines are imposed under the socalled<br />
penal clauses of the Act those fines will be collected. That<br />
is a firm statement of intention by this Government. / 2 </p>
<p>Mr. Speaker one must, of course, refer to the historic<br />
amendments to the Act of 1956. These were introduced by the<br />
Minister for Labour and National Service of that time, the late<br />
Harold Holt. As Honourable Members know, the real thrust of those<br />
amendments was to separate the administrative and judicial functions<br />
of the old Court of Conciliation and Arbitration. This meant that<br />
the administrative function of the prevention and settlement of<br />
disputes became the responsibility of the new body, the Commonwealth<br />
Conciliation and Arbitration Commission, whilst the judicial functions<br />
have been the responsibility of the Commonwealth Industrial Court.<br />
Those amendments removed a lot of the legalisms of the system as it<br />
had existed. They resulted in the new commission adopting a more<br />
flexible approach to its responsible task of prevention and settlement<br />
of disputes. I, for one, believe that over the years, the<br />
Commission has carried out its very onerous role in a responsible<br />
and painstaking manner. It has served the community well. I think<br />
perhaps the community does not always realise the very great value<br />
to the community of our system of conciliation and arbitration.<br />
Save for that which operates in New Zealand, there is no other system<br />
comparable with it.<br />
One of the great benefits of it has been that, by and large,<br />
this country has not had inflicted upon it the very long drawn out<br />
disputes that characterise industrial relations in a number of other<br />
countries in the world. Relatively speaking, strikes in this country<br />
are of short duration. This is largely because parties are able to<br />
take their differences to the appropriate tribunal and indeed that<br />
tribunal has power to step in of its own volition when disputes occur.<br />
It would be a mistake, however, to see our system of conciliation<br />
and arbitration as an institution merely existing to serve the<br />
interests of management and labour the parties to industrial<br />
disputes. Employers and unions simply cannot be permitted to resolve<br />
their differences without regard to the effect on those groups who<br />
are not themselves directly involved. The Government has a<br />
significant role because it has a responsibility for the management<br />
of an increasingly sophisticated economy. Government is itself<br />
perhaps the most important party in industrial relations. It<br />
represents the community. This has always been recognized by the<br />
Conciliation and Arbitration Act in a variety of ways. It has long<br />
given government the right to intervene in certain prodeedings:<br />
It envisages Ministers notifying disputes. It has long contained<br />
provision for the " public interest" to be taken into account in the<br />
prevention and settlement of industrial disputes.<br />
We are proposing in the Bill now before the House to enhance<br />
the protection of the public interest. It is the factor uppermost<br />
in our minds whenever we have come to consider alterations to the<br />
Conciliation and Arbitration Act. It is what the community is<br />
entitled to expect of government.<br />
I have sketched very briefly some of the principal changes that<br />
have been made to the Act over the years, but it is not only the<br />
Conciliation and Arbitration Act itself that we have given a great<br />
deal of attention to over the years. Honourable Members will recall<br />
that when this country was faced with perhaps one of the most serious<br />
periods of disturbance on the Australian waterfront we were not<br />
slow to act. / 3<br />
/ 3 </p>
<p>conclued at that time that strong leqislation<br />
,-as needed and we introduced it in .1^ 65. That legislation had a<br />
most salutary effect on the Taterside ' r; Ter'-F' Federation as indeed<br />
it was intended to have.<br />
Nlow, Speaer, that leads me to sneak of the<br />
importance attached to this current bill as part of our total<br />
fight against inflation in this country.<br />
7e are concerned to ensure that the parties to industrial<br />
disputes settle their differences within the arbitraton system where<br />
the public interest factor is an all important one. Ve have<br />
included in the bill, for example, a provision that the Commission<br />
must have full regard to the economic consequences of what it might<br />
decided. We have included in the bill provisions widening the<br />
particular matters which are reserved for determination by a Full<br />
Bench of the Commission<br />
! e believe this is particularly imoortant because these<br />
are matters that ought not to be considered on a piecemeal basis.<br />
They demand a co-ordinated approach by the Commission. They demand<br />
that every opportunity is given to government and to the widest<br />
possible range of interested parties to put their views to the<br />
Commission when matters of this nature are being determined by<br />
the Commission. As part of our total planning in our fight against<br />
inflation, we are also strengthening provisions of the Act to deal<br />
with irresponsibilities of trade union power. we are convinced that<br />
certain powerful elements in the trade union movement have exercised<br />
their strength on too many occasions in a totally irresrpnsible<br />
fashion. Unfair and undue pressure has been placed upon employers<br />
by the use of the strike weapon. This has resulted in excessive<br />
rises in wages and salaries relative to national productivity.<br />
We have long held that it is important to the community<br />
that there be a strong trade union movement. We do not wish to see<br />
a weak trade union movement but, by the same token, we have to see a<br />
balance of power between employers and unions in the settlement of<br />
industrial disputes. Over the last twelve months, consumer prices have risen<br />
by 7 per cent a marked acceleration on the rate of 2 per cent<br />
to 3k per cent which Australia experienced throughout most of the<br />
1960' s. I believe it is recognised by most economists that this<br />
increase in inflationary pressures has been largely due to excessive<br />
rises in wages and salaries to which I have already referred.<br />
Inflation is a pernicious economic and social evil.<br />
The losers in the inflationary struggle are people often least able<br />
to afford it retired people, small savers, the unemoloyed, and<br />
less organised groups of workers. / 4 </p>
<p>4-<br />
It is for these reasons that the Government has " een<br />
seriously concerned about ' inflation, and has taken action on<br />
several fronts. to deal with the problem.<br />
First, we have recognised the importance of greater<br />
competition in the economy. The Attorney-General w'ill be making<br />
a statement to Parliament shortly outlining proposals for some<br />
important changes to trade piactices legislation.<br />
We have also indicated our intention to carry out a<br />
systematic review of the tariff structure.<br />
Second, we have taken an active part in promoting higher<br />
productivity in Australia through the assistance we have given<br />
to inter-firm comparisons, productivity groups, and productivity<br />
promotion. Third and here we come closer to the crux of the<br />
problem we are intervening actively in Arbitration Commission<br />
hearings whenever these have general economic significance. And<br />
we are seeking to ensure that restraint is exercised within the areas<br />
of the Government's own responsibility the Public Service and the<br />
various Conmonwealth statutory bodies. It is ,'' ithin this total<br />
context that the extensive amendments proposed by this bill must be<br />
seen. And this is not the only piece of legislation that we<br />
have brought forward in this Session to deal with the problem of<br />
industrial unrest that has dogged this country in recent times.<br />
Parliament has just recently passed an amendment to the<br />
Public Service Arbitration Act which is specifically designed to deal<br />
with industrial situations arising in the area of Commonwealth<br />
employment. We have strengthened that Act bv making available to<br />
management and the unions the traditional means of conciliation<br />
and arbitration to resolve industrial situations as they arise. I am<br />
sure this is a provisions which has been widely welcomed.<br />
There is absolutely no reason why organisations with<br />
members in Commonwealth employment should need to engage in<br />
industrial disturbance. The Public Service Arbi. tration Act as it has<br />
now been amended, will ensure that Constitutional means are<br />
available if and when industrial situations emerge in the Commonwealth<br />
area of employment. I spoke earlier of the extent to which this Government<br />
over the years has strengthened the Act to ensure every opportunity<br />
for democratic control in organisations registered under the<br />
Conciliation and Arbitration Act. There is a wide range of provisions<br />
included in this Act to extend further those opportunities.<br />
Tie firmly believe th. t unions and employer bodies should<br />
not be the playthings of those who sit upon executives. A heavy<br />
responsibility rests upon executives to see that the affairs of those<br />
organisations are conducted scrupulously and with respect to the<br />
views of the members. </p>
<p>The members should have the widest possible opportunity<br />
for expressing their views and for seeing to it that their<br />
organisations are properly controlled. Surely no-one can disagree<br />
with any of this. Surely no-one can disagree ' ith the provisns<br />
of the hill which are designed to achieve this.<br />
If the Opposition is going to argue against these<br />
provisions, then all any reasonable person can say is that they<br />
are merely the sookesmen of those union bosses who must have<br />
something to fear by these provisions being brought into law.<br />
There has been much said in recent months about the<br />
amalgamation of organisations in particular the amalgamation<br />
of unions. je recognise that amalgamation of unions is a<br />
characteristic of industrialised societies.<br />
We recognise that there can be benefits to the members<br />
of organisations in combining their resources to undertake more<br />
effectively their responsibilities. We believe, however, that<br />
because amalgamation of organisations is such an important step<br />
that it should be clearly authorised by the membership of the<br />
organisations which pronose to amalgamate. " e do not wish to see<br />
amalgamations take place unless the widest possible opportunity is<br />
given to members to voice their opinion about an amalgamation<br />
proposal. We do not want to see organisations grow so large that<br />
the members of them see themselves to be so minute in the total scheme<br />
of things that they lose all real contact with the officials whose<br />
taks it is to run the affairs of the organi-stion.<br />
The bill now before the House does not simply consist of<br />
a whole range of unconnected proposals for change in the<br />
Conciliation and Arbitration Act. It is, as I have poiated out, a<br />
cohesive document. It is designed to ensure that the interests<br />
of the community are not lost sight of when parties sit down to<br />
settle disputes. It is designed to ensure that the organisations<br />
involved in the settlement of disputes faithfully reflect the views<br />
of their members. There is a single nhilosophy running through the whole of<br />
it. That philosophy may be summed up as one which aims to protect<br />
the commlunity and the individual in the total area of industrial<br />
relations. And that is vital to our success and prosperity as a<br />
nation. </p>
