PRIME MINISTER 106/ 95<br />
JOINT STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING<br />
MP, THE MINISTER FOR ENVIRONMENT, SPORT AND TERRITORIES,<br />
SENATOR JOHN FAULKNER, AND THE MINISTER FOR RESOURCES,<br />
DAVID BEDDALL MP<br />
DRAFT DEFERRED FOREST AREAS<br />
The Government agreed this evening to-release detailed draft proposals from<br />
officials setting out Deferred Forest Areas in New South Wales, Victoria,<br />
Western Australia and Tasmania. The draft proposals for each State will be<br />
made available to stakeholders later this week. There will be a three week<br />
period for public consultation.<br />
The draft reports identify Deferred Forest Areas through which it is proposed<br />
to protect values needed to meet the Commonwealth's criteria for<br />
comprehensive, adequate and representative reserves pending the<br />
negotiation of Regional Forest Agreements with relevant States. The<br />
documents represent the positions which have been reached by<br />
Commonwealth officials in negotiations with their State counterparts.<br />
Following the public consultation period, the Government will then decide on<br />
the areas to be set aside as Deferred Forest Areas.<br />
This is a vital step in the development of Regional Forest Agreements with<br />
State Governments. It shows the progress that has been made in identifying<br />
forest areas to be deferred for further study to determine those forests which<br />
will be required for inclusion in a National Forest Reserve System. In<br />
contrast with previous decisions on forest use, assessments of possible<br />
Deferred Forest Areas have been conducted on a regional level.<br />
The Commonwealth's proposed criteria for a comprehensive, adequate and<br />
representative forest reserve system were announced in July 1995 and<br />
formed the basis of the identification of draft Deferred Forest Areas.<br />
The scheduled consultations will allow public scrutiny of the Government's<br />
process on this important issue. Any significant issues that arise during the<br />
consultation process will be referred to the Government's independent<br />
scientific panel to ensure the objectivity of the process.<br />
