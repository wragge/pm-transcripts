FEDERATION OF AUSTRALIAN RADIO BROADCASTERS/ SYDNEY TIME CLUB<br />
SYDNEY 3 DECEMBER 1986<br />
Mrs Cameron, Members of FARB, members of the Time Club,<br />
ladies and gentlemen.<br />
Anybody who has ever produced a talk-back radio show will<br />
know that politicians are no strangers to radio. I suppose<br />
I am no exception to that. Indeed I always enjoy<br />
participating in talk-back because it's an excellent way of<br />
keeping in touch with the Australian public, of letting them<br />
know what we're doing and of hearing their concerns and<br />
complaints. Sometimes hearing them pretty forcefully, too.<br />
The stimulating thing about talk-back is that listeners will<br />
ask your view about nearly every issue under the sun; and<br />
of course they're entitled to as good a response as you can<br />
give. But though we discuss almost everything on talk-back, we<br />
seldom discuss radio itself which is a shame in view of<br />
the gigantic contribution radio has made and will continue<br />
to make to Australian society, and in view of the very great<br />
changes taking place in the Australian media industry<br />
overall. So today, instead of talking on radio, I want to talk about<br />
radio which is fitting because the very wide<br />
representation of the radio industry present here today<br />
means I am talking, in effect, to radio.<br />
I want to address today the key question facing us all in<br />
government as well as in the radio industry: that is, how<br />
to ensure that radio continues to serve the best interests<br />
of the Australian community in the future as it has done<br />
for several decades already.<br />
In particular I want to address the issue of the<br />
introduction of FM radio to regional areas, a development<br />
which as you all know is imminent.<br />
The rapid pace of change is affecting radio as it is<br />
affecting the rest of the Australian society. We must<br />
master the technological ' challenge facing us. We must adapt </p>
<p>to our new competitive trading environment. We must learn<br />
to minimise restraints to growth where they exist. We must<br />
critically examine if we can simplify and reduce the amount<br />
of costly regulation which we have inherited.<br />
My Government has been given the responsibility of steering<br />
Australia through a time of very profound economic change.<br />
We are proud of our achievements in bringing about the<br />
conditions for future economic growth. Australian industry<br />
is poised to reap the benefits of a new competitiveness.<br />
And to their eternal credit, the Australian people have<br />
shown their willingness to make sacrifices in the interests<br />
of securing adequate living standards for the future.<br />
As part of this adaptation to new economic and technological<br />
circumstances, some industries have undergone quite<br />
considerable change. One common theme running through the<br />
Government's involvement in for example the revitalisation<br />
of employment and investment in the car and steel<br />
industries, or in the announcement of new ownership and<br />
control rules for the television industry, has been the<br />
creation of a more competitive environment.<br />
The radio industry is now, as you know, undergoing a similar<br />
process.<br />
With the introduction of the new FM licences, the radio<br />
industry faces potentially major change.<br />
The Government believes the increased utilisation of this<br />
public resource the FM band will yield substantial new<br />
consumer benefits.<br />
But we are determined also that the process of change in the<br />
radio industry will take full account of your views and the<br />
views of other sections of the industry. We know from<br />
experience that the best route to smooth structural<br />
re-adjustment is through detailed analysis, close<br />
consultation with affected parties, and, only then, a<br />
careful and balanced Government decision.<br />
We would all have liked it better, of course, if this<br />
process could have been completed more speedily.<br />
But it is necessary to achieve the right decision, and that<br />
process involves balancing competing industry opinions,<br />
expert views and government priorities. Inevitably this<br />
takes time.<br />
FARB has, I know, expressed dissatisfaction with the length<br />
of time that it has taken for the issue of new FM radio<br />
licences in Australia to be determined. You have rightly<br />
noted that it is ten years since a commitment was made to<br />
introduce new FM services nationally.<br />
For much of the three and a half years my Government has<br />
been in office, we have given priority to the greater<br />
problem of regional television. I make no apology for this. </p>
<p>However, we are now committed to moving quickly on the<br />
introduction of FM services, particularly in regional areas.<br />
We believe the members of FARB, and the Australian listening<br />
public as a whole, will ultimately benefit from this change.<br />
The Minister for Communications, Michael Duffy has, I know,<br />
already made clear to you that the Government's preferred<br />
option is to provide additional services by means of<br />
independent operators that is, to introduce competition.<br />
I believe that all elements of the industry FARB, FAIR,<br />
other independents, the Tribunal, and the Government are<br />
agreed that the supplementary licence scheme needs change if<br />
it is to be made workable. In its current form there must<br />
be strong doubts that the scheme would ever work<br />
effectively. only two hearings have been completed under it. They have<br />
taken two years, and they have yet to result in any new<br />
service. I hasten to point out, having noted that Deirdre O'Connor is<br />
here, that this is not meant to be a criticism of the<br />
Tribunal. Rather it exemplifies how unworkable is the<br />
system the Tribunal must administer.<br />
A substantial amount of information, and various competing<br />
proposals, or options, have now-, been put forward on how to<br />
streamline the supplementary scheme process. I should<br />
emphasise that the Government has not yet made its decision<br />
on this issue.<br />
obviously, where there is doubt about the means by which<br />
additional services are to be provided, the Tribunal<br />
represents the appropriate arbitrator. But where there is<br />
not based on the best available information, including<br />
that offered by the industry the Government must consider<br />
whether it can continue to delay the delivery of services to<br />
the public by the imposition of an inappropriate and time<br />
consuming scheme.<br />
The Government has a number of proposals under consideration<br />
which have been available for public comment. I hope that<br />
industry representatives have taken up this opportunity for<br />
comment, in a spirit of co-operation.<br />
FARB has, I know, responded in detail to the report of the<br />
Forward Development Unit in the Department of Communications<br />
which deals with FM issues. Let me make clear again that<br />
contributions to this debate are welcomed by the Government.<br />
I want to take this opportunity of assuring you that FARB's<br />
response will be seriously and fully considered.<br />
I would note, too, that the task of assessing the FDU Report<br />
is a task for the minister and the Government, not officials<br />
or advisers.<br />
I am aware of FARB's concern that up until now the </p>
<p>consultative process appears to have adopted an unreasonable<br />
interest in the viability of new licencees, and spent little<br />
time on the viability of existing licencees.<br />
If this is so, and I am not convinced that it is, then let<br />
me redress the balance to the extent possible today.<br />
We have no desire at all to undermine the viability of<br />
existing broadcasters. It would be patently inconsistent<br />
with our desire to see additional, diverse services provided<br />
to regional listeners if we were to merely drain the<br />
vitality of the existing services.<br />
On the other hand, the Government can be expected to have<br />
little patience with claims that there are no or very few<br />
markets where new, competitive services can co-exist with<br />
established services.<br />
Ladies and Gentlemen.<br />
I want to make a few brief comments today as well on the<br />
impact of the new television ownership and control rules, as<br />
they affect radio.<br />
You will all be aware that the new rules contain a cross<br />
media test, a matter which was central to the communications<br />
plank in the ALP platform at the last elections, and an<br />
issue which has received great attention in the United<br />
States in the last decade.<br />
As far as radio is concerned, the new rule should dfree up<br />
some parts of the industry from being perhaps tied to a<br />
corporate strategy predicated on television's interests.<br />
While no radio station need be divested under the television<br />
rule, the rule will limit any potential television licensee<br />
to areas where no monopoly radio licence is held.<br />
I would note also that the policy explicitly refers to<br />
" monopoly" radio, consistent with the Government's stated<br />
prejudice towards competition.<br />
Ladies and Gentlemen.<br />
Let me in conclusion make a few comments of more general<br />
relevance to the entire media industry. I am always ready,<br />
as I think you would know, to acknowledge and defend the<br />
essential role of the media in our democratic system. The<br />
ability of you and your colleagues in TV and the print media<br />
to keep the Australian public up to date on current<br />
political events is a genuinely desirable feature of our<br />
political life. So is your ability to criticise politicians<br />
when you see fit.<br />
But ready as I am to acknowledge that, I am equally prepared<br />
to return the criticism when I see fit and today gives me<br />
an opportunity to do that.<br />
I always thought that one of the basic tasks of news </p>
<p>reporting was checking your facts before g6ing to air or to<br />
print. I still think that should be one of the crucial<br />
tasks of news analysis. Yet recently we have seen some<br />
outstanding examples where indolence failure to check<br />
facts has been allowed to take the place of diligence<br />
Three times of late, lead stories in the National Times on<br />
Sunday which were themselves less than fully accurate have<br />
been picked up by electronic media and reported virtually<br />
without change or prior checking. It's irritating to read<br />
not just an incorrect newspaper story but to hear it<br />
broadcast for the rest of the weekend and I take this<br />
opportunity of gently reminding you all of your<br />
responsibility to reporting the truth.<br />
Ladies and Gentlemen.<br />
Radio is a positive, exciting, aggressive medium. It did<br />
not lie down and die when television was introduced<br />
despite the predictions of some critics. It has survived<br />
advertising slumps, war, and recessions. We should all work<br />
together to see that it survives the present demands of<br />
restructuring.<br />
