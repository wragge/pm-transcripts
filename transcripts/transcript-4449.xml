His Royal Highness The Prince of Wales has accepted an<br />

The invitation had followed discussions which Mr Harry M.<br />
Miller, Chairman of the Silver Jubilee Commemorative Organisation<br />

Silver Jubilee Appeal had with The Prince of Wales in London in<br />
May and June of this year. Mr Fraser said that he had been<br />
pleased to exttend the invitation on behalf of the Government<br />

and State Governments and representatives from the National Appeal<br />
Committee, the State Committees and the Committee for the<br />
Territories, to prepare in draft form a program of engagements<br />
for the visit. Those details will ' be announced when an approved<br />
