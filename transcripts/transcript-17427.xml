    <content><![CDATA[<p>Sydney</p>
<p>PM: Thank you very much. I know there's snow in Canberra, icy winds here, but the welcome back home for you is a really warm one. It's a really warm one because it comes from our hearts. You've done incredibly well, the nation is very proud of you.</p>
<p>You went there, you gave your all, you competed hard, you played fairly, you did it in the Australian way. So congratulations to each and every team member. Now so many of you have come back sporting medals but many of you went there, competed and did your best and my congratulations, on behalf of the nation, goes to each of you and I know that you are all looking forward to that important moment when you get to see mum, dad, your partners and your family, your friends.</p>
<p>I know that they're all looking forward to welcoming you home and I did want to say to mums and dads and partners and friends, thank you to each of them for supporting you as you've trained so hard for this part of your career. Obviously, they're the ones that got you to training, they're the ones that helped you buy the equipment, they're the ones that provided the emotional and physical support that has helped you get through, so a big congratulations to them as well.</p>
<p>I know that you are, in the days ahead, going to be moving right around the nation going back home to every corner of the nation and everywhere you go you are going to be making people smile.</p>
<p>Well done.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
