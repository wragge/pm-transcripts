INTERVIEW WITH PETER HARVEY 21 AUGUST 1978<br />
QUESTION<br />
How did it suddenly emerge?<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
The draft the shorthand notes of it, I think had always<br />
been in existance, well obviously they had, because during the<br />
discussions in Sydney Eric Robinson did dictate a draft and<br />
I didn't see it I didn't see it until today.<br />
I had been aware of its existenceI had been advised actual<br />
copies had been destroyed. A request was made for the notes to<br />
be retyped today, and they were.<br />
QUESTION<br />
Why have you waited so long before producing it?<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
For a very good reason. There is a question of confidentiality<br />
of discussions between Ministers, especially when those conversations<br />
are in either a Cabinet meeting or a full Ministerial meeting,<br />
and indeed it is very important for the operations of government.<br />
The substance of The Bulletin charges, as I believe, as other<br />
Ministers have believed, amongst whom I have discussed this matterthey<br />
had been answered last week by Eric, and by myself, without<br />
going into the detail. Quite plainly, as things continued, and<br />
as media interest continued, not content with those denials of<br />
the substance, it was necessary to lay the whole matter bare, and<br />
yesterday in discussions with Doug Anthony in discussion with<br />
Eric Robinson and in discussions today we agreed that this course<br />
should be taken and so it was.<br />
QUESTION<br />
Let's look at some of the things he says in the draft note to you.<br />
He says that he couldn't recall any specific detail of the<br />
conversation, yet in the~ evidence, as you are well aware, on<br />
page 1685 on the 6th June, he says that he became aware precisely<br />
of what Senator Withers had done. How do you explain this sort<br />
of contradiction?<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
I think you have got to read the evidence as a whole because in<br />
other parts of the evidence it says that he only became aware of<br />
the full extent and nature of the discussions when Mr Pearson<br />
gave his evidence before the Royal Commission so you have got<br />
to look at the evidence as a whole. The thing that had interested<br />
me was when he raised the matter and indicated that it was the<br />
fact of the conversation and not the substance that had been related<br />
in my office, was that, well, all right, this maybe gives an<br />
explanation of why he has got a clear recollection of it and I haven't. </p>
<p>Because if a Minister comes into my office and says he has<br />
been talking with his permanent head, that is not remarkable.<br />
If he says he hasn't spoken with his permanent head for some<br />
time it would be remarkable. In terms of a particular phone<br />
conversation, it had to be the nature, the purpose, the substance,<br />
themotive of a phone conversation that made this a remarkable<br />
one. Some parts of that, as denoted for example, was only<br />
revealed, I believe, when Mr Justice McGregor made his<br />
findings in his Report. If it had been the fact of the<br />
conversation, there is no-particular reason why it would<br />
stay in my memory. Now all along I said I haven't I don't<br />
question the Minister's recollection of the 17th January.<br />
I only say that I have got no awareness of that incident until<br />
April when Senator Durack, as Attorney-General, came to me<br />
with a report of a particular conversation which caused him<br />
concern and if the Attorney-General was concerned, I was<br />
obviously going to be concerned about it.<br />
QUESTION<br />
Why then the need for the note at all?<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
Because it would have clarified the point for me, and at the most<br />
it could have led to one or two additional sentences going into<br />
the Parliamentary statement. But the Minister was advised to<br />
check the evidence before the Royal Commission I concurred with<br />
that, as did other Ministers who were present and even though<br />
a draft was dictated, and it ought to be kept in that perspective,<br />
it was never signed, it was never sent, and there was never<br />
any pressure to have it sent.<br />
