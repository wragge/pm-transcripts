TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P. J. KEATING MP<br />
PRESS CONFERENCE, ERAWAN HOTEL, BANGKOK, 7 APRIL 1994<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
PM: I will try to give you an indication of some of the things which I<br />
discussed this morning with the Prime Minister and members of the<br />
Government. The first thing to say Is not enough people in Australia<br />
have understood the potential in the rela-tionship. with Thailand.<br />
Whatever the reasons, I would like my visit to be the moment at which<br />
Australia and Thailand begin to pay each other more attention.<br />
Whatever the reasons in the past, things like the level of investment,<br />
while increasing does not do justice to the relationship which we might<br />
otherwise have. We need to take steps to maximise the conditions in<br />
which investment can flourish and trade opportunities develop.<br />
This is the second largest ASEAN economy, soon expected to be the<br />
fastest growing. During' our-dscussions this morning the Prime<br />
Minister and I and members of the Cabinet, his Ministry and my party<br />
discussed the relationship in the broad, the elements In our bilateral<br />
relationship, its prospects, we discussed APEC, developments in the<br />
region, security matters. and I have got fftihr opportunities to discuss<br />
some of these questions tonight with the Prime Minister over dinner.<br />
We agreed upon a number of things also today. One important thing<br />
was an agreement to establish a new ministerial commission which will<br />
give us for the first time a regular riiinisterial level forum to discuss<br />
ways of expanding trade and Investment links. You might remember,<br />
though Australia has now with a number of countries, two others<br />
Japan and Indonesia a joint ministerial forum. This will be our third<br />
with Thailand and it means that many of the, if you like, intra portfolio<br />
points can be raised in this context. For instance, I raised today<br />
questions about Qantas's growth potential out of the hub of Bangkok<br />
and the Inhibitions it faces. Such a question could be raised in a<br />
ministerial council context. At the same time, the Prime Minister raised </p>
<p>with me barriers to Thai imports into Australia. This would be typical of<br />
the kind of matter which would be discussed there.<br />
I also indicated today and you may be aware that Bob McMullan, the<br />
Minister for Trade, will lead a major Australian trade and investment<br />
mission to Thailand later this year. Our trade is growing especially in<br />
manufactures, but we can and should do better and I think this trade<br />
mission will help enormously.<br />
We decided today In what I thought was an important decision to<br />
explore further what prospects there might be for the establishment of<br />
a link between the ASEAN Free Trade Agreement and the free trade<br />
area of Australia and New Zealand. So that is a link between AFTA<br />
and CER. We had a reasonably long discussion about this point and<br />
we have decided that I will raise this matter formally with New Zealand<br />
and I was invited by the Deputy Prime Minister to raise the matter<br />
formally with other ASEAN states, other members states of ASEAN. In<br />
the discussion I made the point that the combined GDP, of ASEAN<br />
which Is now an important regional trade area is approximately the<br />
same as the combined GDP of Australia and New Zealand. So, It<br />
would be a doubling of that market in terms of access. So, we have<br />
decided to pursue discussions around this point.<br />
I was also very pleased with my discussions with the Prime Minister<br />
and the Government about APEC, about the prospects for multi lateral<br />
resolution of trade problems , and expanding growth and trade<br />
opportunities on a multi lateral basis as distinct from the problems of<br />
unilateralist approaches and bilateralist approaches and, I think, our<br />
understanding of APEC Is getting closer, we see it having quite an<br />
ambitious potential and I am looking forward to further discussions<br />
tonight with the Prime Minister about the November meeting of APEC<br />
and its agenda in Indonesia later this year.<br />
I was also glad I raised with the Prime Minister the question of<br />
Cambodia. The fact that we have the United Nations sponsorship of<br />
the Peace Accords has produced an outcbme of great satisfaction, but<br />
work remains to be done. The Government has to succeed in growth<br />
development and the equitable government of the country, but I was<br />
glad to have an assurance from the Prime Minister that Thailand will<br />
not be supporting any individual factions in Cambodia. We articulated<br />
the importance of isolating the Khmer Rouge from trade and Income<br />
and to encourage them to be part of the processes of government In<br />
Cambodia including, of course, the incorporation of the Khmer Rouge<br />
into the army of the Royal Cambodian Government.<br />
I might say I am meeting General Wimol this afternoon because we<br />
have a long standing defence relationshil'with Thailand and the Thai<br />
army is an Important element in Thai society. </p>
<p>Finally could I say, the Prime Minister invited Australia to participate<br />
more fully in other regional growth areas of this part of the world and<br />
commended Australia on its aid program, most particularly mentioned<br />
the Friendship Bridge and the enhanced trade and investment<br />
opportunities which it will bring to the region.<br />
J: Prime Minister, what signals did you get from the Thai Government as<br />
to their sounding with other ASEAN nations about the prospect of a<br />
greater Asia-Pacific free trade zone?<br />
PM: This is In a link between AFTA and CER. The Deputy Prime Minister<br />
told me in having raised it informally with member states of ASEAN he<br />
had received no indication other than a positive one from his efforts.<br />
He said it had not been formally discussed at the formal meetings of<br />
ASEAN, though he had discussed it Informally with ASEAN member<br />
states and governments. But, in enjoining us to do the same, he<br />
believes Australia could play a role Itself in opening up this discussion<br />
and just making the point that the economy of Australasia is as large or<br />
larger than the combined GDP of the ASEAN member countries. So,<br />
in a regional freer trade area, we would be extending the concept of a<br />
free product market between Australia and Now Zealand as they would<br />
be extending the concept of freer trade and diminished tariffs between<br />
the ASEAN member countries.<br />
J: And do you have a time frame all over which you think this might be<br />
achievable?<br />
PM: No. We have spoken of it now over the last six months or so. You<br />
might remember Deputy Prime Minister Supachai raised this publicly in<br />
Australia during his visit and we will progress it I don't think with any<br />
time frame in mind. The other issue which the member states of<br />
ASEAN need to discuss is the rate of decline in tariff protection which<br />
is now scheduled for a 15 year phase down. I think, there is becoming<br />
a general view with the outcome GATT that that time profile is out of<br />
sync with GAIT commitments and also the natural economic<br />
expectations of these regional economies.<br />
J: How important would such a move be for Australia and its trading<br />
prospects in the region?<br />
PM: Where ever we can extend the notion of freer trade we ought to. We<br />
have done this now over a long period of time with New Zealand. We<br />
have an open goods market and we have now a much more open<br />
services market and to open that opportunity up further in countries<br />
with a GDP of roughly the same of our own, obviously, extends market<br />
opportunities for Australians and Australian business, it would further<br />
underpin our trade efforts in the area and more rapidly lead to the<br />
prospect of higher economic growth and more employment. </p>
<p>J: context of APEC, would you see this as a sub-group of APEC<br />
initially which could form. the nuclei of a broader and more<br />
comprehensive free trade region for the APEC area as a whole?<br />
PM: I think APEC will be an umbrella which covers a number of free trade<br />
areas. The most obvious one being the North American Free Trade<br />
Agreement and area NAFTA, it already covers NAFTA, CER and<br />
AFTA, it Is a matter of whether we could make AFTA and CER fit which<br />
would just extend, if you like, that free trade area, but within the<br />
compass of greater multi-lateral, If you like, a broader multi-lateral<br />
frame work with APEC.<br />
J: Do you see the integration of AFTA and CER eventually allowing trade<br />
as free as it is now between Australia and New Zealand?<br />
PM; These are complementary economies, there are higher levels of<br />
protection extant in these economies than there is in Australia. There<br />
would need to be some understanding about the pace with which that<br />
changed. In other words, were we to, let's say have such an<br />
agreement this very day, the agreement would only be of benefit where<br />
the trade liberalisations had already occurred. If they are going to<br />
occur over fifteen years It would mean there would be benefits, but<br />
over a much longer time frame. So, I think there is two elements to<br />
this. That is, quickening the pace of tariff reductions within the ASEAN<br />
free trade area and at the same time then seeing what complementary<br />
benefits there would be in Australia and AFTA doing something<br />
together.<br />
J: Prime Minister, if I can ask a domestic question, unemployment figures<br />
came out today suggesting that another fall in unemployment down to<br />
10.3. How soon do you think Australia will see unemployment back In<br />
single digits?<br />
PM: I. I don't think I can say precisely when because of the complication of<br />
the participation rate which has been dancing around now for the last<br />
couple of years. So, you could actually see quite a pick up in<br />
employment, but a shift up in the participation rate which would still<br />
leave unemployment In double digit figures. It is my hope though that<br />
consistent employment growth will consistently chip away at the<br />
unemployment level and with reasonable participation rates see<br />
unemployment slip down under 10 per cent.<br />
J: The OECD. report warned that the level of unemployment benefits are<br />
reaching a stage where they are a disincentive to some peo ple to get<br />
jobs. Is that going to be addressed In the White Paper?<br />
PM: 1 The answer is yes, it will be. I know something of the OECD report but<br />
I have not read it. We are looking at a set of incentives amongst other<br />
things in the White Paper context which would encourage people into </p>
<p>work, particularly part time work, but I think all that will be revealed In<br />
due course.<br />
J: The OECD has also said that Australia is suffering from a narrow and<br />
declining base and suggested that broader based taxes... It is<br />
basically a favourable report a concern to the bureaucracy certainly<br />
in Australia.<br />
PM: It Is part of this, sort of, euro centricity of the OECD, but basically they<br />
are Into bigger government than we are. Bigger government in<br />
Australia in the 1970a dislocated Australian private investment and<br />
getting a smaller but better government which is what Australia did<br />
through fiscal consolidation in the 1980s leaves us way outside the<br />
OECD pack in terms of fiscal effectiveness. Therefore, the frame of<br />
reference of the OECD Is not the frame of reference of Australia in this<br />
respect. Ours is an ambitious experience way beyond the general<br />
OECD experience and these writings would come with the context of<br />
the OECD experience. Were the OECD general member countries<br />
able to consolidate their fiscal scene as Australia has and make its<br />
outlay programs more effective, you know , it is a turn up for the books<br />
to have the OECD arguing for higher taxation. I spent most of my<br />
decade going there when they were arguing for lowering taxation.<br />
J: after compensation with Australian authorities though, it must reflect<br />
there..<br />
PMV: No, it doesn't. You can never assume that. I like the OECD, it is a<br />
useful body, but no OECD assessor could ever have anything like the<br />
fiscal experience of the Australian Cabinet and therefore it is like most<br />
OECD reports you take the parts which are useful in our experience,<br />
but the notion that Australia should go down the route of consumption<br />
taxation to build a second tax base in the tax system, to dislocate<br />
Australian private investment would be ultra-vires of our interests in<br />
the next fifteen years.<br />
J: What about their comments that we should also follow the New<br />
Zealand experience on labour market reform and having to move away<br />
from..<br />
PM; As I understand It, the OECD said that the labour market changes of<br />
our new industrial relations act provides a frame work which would<br />
assist in flexibility. I think that Is Important. I don't know whether too<br />
many of you read the Australian Magazine last weekend on Britain in a<br />
piece by Phillip Knightley where he recounted women working seventy<br />
and eighty hour weeks for the equivalent of $ 120-13OAUS a week.<br />
Yet, the managerial classes of Britain had enjoyed very high salaries<br />
and, of course, there was great wealth being generated in their stock<br />
market. Australia will not go down that route, that is why it<br />
unashamedly and unambiguously will always put a floor under these </p>
<p>6<br />
so-called processes of flexibility which denies the opportunity of some<br />
people to make poor people poorer and hence the importance of the<br />
award system as a base for enterprise flexibility. In other words, what<br />
Australia is doing in this respect is superior to what Is being done in<br />
some other countries and the frame of reference again is euro centric<br />
and needs to be seen against the broader aspirations of a social<br />
democracy of the kind fashioned by a labor government in the 1980s<br />
and not the Thatcher government of Britain for instance. Thank you<br />
ends </p>
