    <content><![CDATA[<p>E&amp;OE...............................................</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, you got your surplus, but the dollar is still falling.</p>
<p>   Is there no pleasing these financial markets?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I think movements in the dollar are largely unrelated to that,</p>
<p>   the immediate movements. I think long term though, financial markets</p>
<p>   will give a huge tick to this Budget. I don't normally comment</p>
<p>   on movements in the dollar and I certainly don't want to break</p>
<p>   that rule on this occasion. In the long term though this is a really</p>
<p>   classy Budget for the financial markets, because it is a genuine</p>
<p>   surplus. The economic forecasts are full of integrity, there's</p>
<p>   nothing overblown, they haven't been manipulated by the Prime</p>
<p>   Minister's office the way in which in certain estimates, in</p>
<p>   I think the One Nation statement of Mr Keating's were some</p>
<p>   years ago. They are genuine Treasury estimates, very conservative,</p>
<p>   and therefore they will give a lot of confidence to the financial</p>
<p>   markets. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>But it's only actually going to last for a few weeks isn't</p>
<p>   it? Because then you've got your tax package, Telstra social</p>
<p>   bonus which will blow these figures away.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Matt, the quality and the strength of this Budget will last for</p>
<p>   years because what we have done is to achieve the most remarkable</p>
<p>   and historic fiscal turnaround of any government since WWII. I mean,</p>
<p>   to turn a deficit annually of $10.5 billion, into a surplus of $2.7</p>
<p>   billion in two years is a phenomenal achievement and it will help</p>
<p>   us lock in these low interest rates and low inflation rates. I mean</p>
<p>   the lowest small business rates for 33 years, the lowest housing</p>
<p>   rates for 30 years, 280 000 new jobs in two-and-quarter years. The</p>
<p>   lowest inflation rate for 30 years, we can look the nations of the</p>
<p>   Asia Pacific in the region and say we have got strong predictable</p>
<p>   reliable growth. That is a tremendous economic report card. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>But we are still vulnerable to Asia though?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well just imagine where we would be if we had not done what we</p>
<p>   have done over the last two years. Just imagine if we still had</p>
<p>   Mr Beazley's black hole of $10.5 billion, if we'd taken</p>
<p>   Labor's advice, and not cut the deficit. Just imagine where</p>
<p>   Australia's economy would now be. We would be bobbing around</p>
<p>   like a small cork on a very turbulent sea.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>What about the jobless figure, Mr Howard?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>They are better now than they have been for eight years.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>But are you happy with it, that's the question.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well look you can never be happy with a jobless figure while any</p>
<p>   Australian who wants a job is out of work. I mean you never, you</p>
<p>   should never rest on that, but we have created 280 000 new jobs</p>
<p>   in just over two years. It is the lowest in eight years, I repeat,</p>
<p>   the lowest in eight years. It reached 11.2% when Mr Beazley was</p>
<p>   the Employment Minister, we now have it at 7.9%.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Where it will stay?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I beg your pardon?</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Where it is likely to stay?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I'm not as pessimistic as that. We've put a conservative</p>
<p>   figure in, which says that you'll be down to about 7.75% by</p>
<p>   the end of the coming financial year. We'd like to see it better.</p>
<p>   I can guarantee that we'll follow the policies that will deliver</p>
<p>   the best prospect of it getting better but it is better now than</p>
<p>   what it was, measurably better than what it was when we came to</p>
<p>   office.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, let's take some calls. Well, Prime Minister, it</p>
<p>   looks like we have a full board of calls. The first call goes to</p>
<p>   Richard Coole from Condingup in Western Australia.</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>Good morning Prime Minister.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Good morning Richard.</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>As a farmer, I would like to congratulate you on your surplus budget</p>
<p>   but without trade surpluses as well, Budget surpluses in my opinion</p>
<p>   result in an inward looking, contractionary type economy. Having</p>
<p>   just returned from China, where there is a $46 billion textile industry,</p>
<p>   and where our total wool exports are worth a mere $2.5 billion,</p>
<p>   surely your Government can help us perhaps with some innovative</p>
<p>   thinking, be a part of the Chinese action.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I think we've done a lot of that already. Our economic</p>
<p>   relationship with China now is stronger than it has been for the</p>
<p>   last three or four years. In fact, in the last two years, the improvement</p>
<p>   in economic and political relations between Australia and China</p>
<p>   has been one of the greater foreign policy successes of my Government</p>
<p>   and the economic linkages between the two countries, the fact that</p>
<p>   I understand China invests more in Australia than most other countries,</p>
<p>   the fact that we have just seen one of our major life insurance</p>
<p>   companies win a licence to do business in China and the fact that</p>
<p>   when I was in Shanghai and Beijing last year, I had one of the largest</p>
<p>   business delegations ever to visit that country and certainly the</p>
<p>   largest ever to accompany an Australian Prime Minister. All of that</p>
<p>   is evidence of the fact that our economic and business links with</p>
<p>   China are growing very strongly. It's a market of $1.2 billion,</p>
<p>   and we have followed a very pragmatic mix of economics and politics</p>
<p>   in order to build the sort of relationship with China that I think</p>
<p>   your question suggests. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Okay Prime Minister can we move onto Darwin now. We have Mick on</p>
<p>   the line.</p>
<p> CALLER::</p>
<p>Good morning Mr Howard. I have a question which was mentioned last</p>
<p>   night by Mr Costello in his speech, reference the commitment that</p>
<p>   the Australian soldiers had made to the country and now it was about</p>
<p>   time that the Australian country repaid it to the servicemen in</p>
<p>   issuing the Gold Card. Why does this not include Vietnam Veterans?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, what we've done is in relation to WWII veterans is we've</p>
<p>   applied the same approach that we applied in relation to WWI veterans,</p>
<p>   that is about 55 years after the end of the hostilities. Obviously</p>
<p>   I can say right now that Korean and Vietnam veterans will be treated</p>
<p>   at least as generously as WWI and WWII veterans. It may turn out</p>
<p>   in the fullness of time to be even more than that, but I'm</p>
<p>   not promising that. I would remind you of course that any veteran</p>
<p>   from Korea or Vietnam who has any war related disability is already</p>
<p>   getting the benefit of the Gold Card. I mean, this extension that</p>
<p>   was announced last night was for about 50 000 veterans of WWII who</p>
<p>   are not now enjoying the benefits of the Gold Card, in other words,</p>
<p>   are not now judged to have a war related disability but who saw</p>
<p>   active service in hostile circumstances overseas in WWII. So, I</p>
<p>   think there are already 180 000 or perhaps 170 000 WWII veterans</p>
<p>   who have the Gold Card because of a War related disability. We are</p>
<p>   including it now for another 50 000 who don't have any war</p>
<p>   related disability but nonetheless saw active service abroad and</p>
<p>   I can assure you that Vietnam and Korean Veterans will be treated</p>
<p>   at least as generously as we treated WWI and WWII Veterans.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>A call from Queensland now. Mr N Williams, from Tewantin.</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, good morning, and thanks for the chance to speak to</p>
<p>   you. First, congratulations on the surplus, it is wonderful. I hate</p>
<p>   paying rent and I hate us paying interest. But the question I had</p>
<p>   was, I agree with your fact that the tax system is presently not</p>
<p>   fair, your comment I know. Please could your staff look at a debits</p>
<p>   tax, which really does seem to be fair right across the board?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, there was a brief examination of that by a former Coalition</p>
<p>   Government. Can I say it won't work. If it did work it would</p>
<p>   have been introduced in many other countries. It will distort the</p>
<p>   whole financial system, it will impose unreasonable burdens on some</p>
<p>   sections of the community and no burdens on others. It does not</p>
<p>   properly measure economic activity so that you can have a fair tax</p>
<p>   base. It is my understanding that it was briefly tried in one country</p>
<p>   about 30 years ago, namely Sri Lanka and then abandoned. So, it</p>
<p>   has been looked at in the past and I'm sorry Mr Williams, it</p>
<p>   doesn't work.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister our next caller is from NSW. His name is Matt. He</p>
<p>   says he is the President of the NSW Young ALP.</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>Good morning Prime Minister.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Good morning Matt. Two Matts in a morning.</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>As a young Australian in constant contact with a lot of youth organisations</p>
<p>   and student groups, I must say that for young Australians I think</p>
<p>   last night's federal budget was a major disappointment, and</p>
<p>   my question to you is why has your Government failed to throw a</p>
<p>   life line to young Australians, and ease their suffering after two</p>
<p>   years of successive cuts to services and programmes when you ...(inaudible)...</p>
<p>   with a $2.7 billion surplus?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I don't accept that, and I appreciate the fact that</p>
<p>   you are honest enough to disclose your political affiliation. But,</p>
<p>   can I just say something about the surplus. Surpluses don't</p>
<p>   just sit there. Surpluses when built up, are used to repay previously</p>
<p>   accumulated debt and what we are doing this year is that we are</p>
<p>   going to collect a $2.7 billion more than we spend, but that's</p>
<p>   not going to go mouldy in the Treasurer's bank. What it's</p>
<p>   going to do is be used to repay the $95 billion of deficits that</p>
<p>   the previous Labor Government ran up in the early years of the nineties.</p>
<p>   And every time you pay a dollar off the country's debt, you</p>
<p>   further entrench low inflation and low interest rates. And you talk</p>
<p>   about young people. Young people want jobs, in time they may want</p>
<p>   to buy homes and have families, and if you provide better business</p>
<p>   conditions and if you have low inflation and low interest rates,</p>
<p>   small business will do more and employ more people. And also if</p>
<p>   you have low interest rates, you will make it easier for young people</p>
<p>   to buy homes. We have made changes to the education system. I think</p>
<p>   the changes we've made at a tertiary level have made the system</p>
<p>   fairer. I might also point out that in the changes that we've</p>
<p>   made to Commonwealth spending, we deliberately quarantine from any</p>
<p>   spending cuts at all, the support the Federal Government gives to</p>
<p>   schools in Australia. I remember when we had our discussion on education</p>
<p>   right at the beginning of the ERC proceedings two years ago, and</p>
<p>   I said from the very start, I'm not going to have any reductions</p>
<p>   in the basic recurrent funding that we give to schools, both the</p>
<p>   Government schools and also what I might call the more modest independent</p>
<p>   schools particularly in the, but not only in the Catholic sector.</p>
<p>   Now, I think given all the constraints that we faced as a Government,</p>
<p>   we have been very fair and very reasonable in the changes we've</p>
<p>   made and the beauty of being back in the black is that there are</p>
<p>   limitless possibilities opened up for the future. When you've</p>
<p>   paid off the mortgage you can turn your horizons to something else,</p>
<p>   something more creative, something more innovative, something more</p>
<p>   for the future, both in terms of a reformed taxation system and</p>
<p>   also other creative areas of social spending.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister we could move I think now to South Australia. We</p>
<p>   have Dean Dowling from Glenelg East on the line.</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>Right, okay, look when we had 35+ years of Federal Budget deficits</p>
<p>   since the war, to whom does the - two questions I've got -</p>
<p>   to whom does the Government owe the apparent debts and when must</p>
<p>   the apparent debts be repaid? The second question is, now you've</p>
<p>   got a budget surplus, in which bank are you going to put the surplus</p>
<p>   and at what rate of interest? Is the answer to the first question,</p>
<p>   no money was ever paid to anyone, they were just left as figures</p>
<p>   in the budget papers. Nothing was borrowed.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Okay, are you finished?</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, what happens when you accumulate, accrue a surplus is that</p>
<p>   the Commonwealth Government borrows the money, it borrows the money</p>
<p>   from individuals, it borrows the money sometimes domestically, sometimes</p>
<p>   overseas to make up the shortfall, and when it borrows the money</p>
<p>   it issues bonds and those bonds carry an interest rate and you've</p>
<p>   got to pay interest on the borrowing and eventually when the bonds</p>
<p>   fall due you've got to redeem the loan from the individual,</p>
<p>   and so when we get a surplus, we use that to repay previously incurred</p>
<p>   debt, and the beauty of what has happened over the last two years</p>
<p>   is that in 1995 about 20% of our GDP, our debt to GDP ratio is about</p>
<p>   20%. By the turn of the century it will be down to 10% and if we</p>
<p>   go ahead with, which we intend to, the sale of the remaining part</p>
<p>   of Telstra it could be down to 1.5%. Now that will lift an enormous</p>
<p>   load off the shoulders, off the back, and off the worrying minds</p>
<p>   of all Australians because we'll be able to breathe easily</p>
<p>   in the next millennium, because we'll enter it essentially</p>
<p>   debt free.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, a call now from Patrick Morrisey of Federal in</p>
<p>   NSW.</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>Good morning Mr Howard. I'd like to ask how can the Government</p>
<p>   ensure the tax rebates given to farmers for soil conservation actually</p>
<p>   facilitate more sustainable land use rather than propping up unsustainable</p>
<p>   enterprises?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I believe in the main, the rebate will be used in that way.</p>
<p>   It will be subject to appropriate criteria when the legislation</p>
<p>   is drawn up. Whenever you give a tax rebate, people say, well how</p>
<p>   can you be certain that it is used in the right way, but my experience</p>
<p>   in relation to those sorts of rebates in the past is that they are</p>
<p>   used effectively and certainly there's a very strong grass</p>
<p>   roots support for landcare in the Australian community. I went to</p>
<p>   the annual landcare awards ceremony in Canberra a few weeks ago</p>
<p>   and I was tremendously impressed about the community based character</p>
<p>   of the movement and it's one of those things that's brought</p>
<p>   together farmers, conservationists, community leaders, people right</p>
<p>   across the political and social spectrum because they all have a</p>
<p>   vested future interest in restoration of the quality of our land.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>A call from Sydney now. Bill of Kensington.</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>Good morning Mr Howard. Hello?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Good morning Bill.</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>Good morning. Thank you very much for putting us in the black again.</p>
<p>   It's been a long time coming, and thank you for that. I just</p>
<p>   want to ask you quite a simple question. Why can't we make</p>
<p>   contributions to health funds tax deductible like they were in the</p>
<p>   70s, again ensure against a gap, which Bob Hawke took off, and then,</p>
<p>   if this is attractive to people, and I'm sure a lot more people</p>
<p>   would be attracted to the funds.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, you can. It's a question of whether the resources needed</p>
<p>   to do it are available. We already of course do have a tax break.</p>
<p>   If you are earning under about $70 000 a year and you've got</p>
<p>   a family, you get $450 a year off your health insurance. For a couple</p>
<p>   it's $250 a year, and that normally, but not only, is taken</p>
<p>   as a tax break. What you are recommending is that we go further,</p>
<p>   and that we really increase the generosity of that tax deduction.</p>
<p>   Now, that is something that has to be set off against other calls</p>
<p>   that might be made on the resources that would be involved in that</p>
<p>   extension, and whether the use of those resources in some other</p>
<p>   way to support private health insurance, or support the health system</p>
<p>   would be more desirable. The gap is something that is under fairly</p>
<p>   constant debate. I understand the argument and I do know that it</p>
<p>   is an irritant to people who have private health insurance that</p>
<p>   they can't insure against the gap. I also know that it is an</p>
<p>   irritant that they, if somebody goes into hospital they not only</p>
<p>   have their private health insurance cover but they also then get</p>
<p>   some bills on top of that, and they think in a sense that they've</p>
<p>   paid three times. They've paid the Medicare levy, they've</p>
<p>   paid their private health contribution, and then they've got</p>
<p>   to pay some bills. Now, moves are already under way to try and eliminate</p>
<p>   that irritant of getting bills on top of, or getting a series of</p>
<p>   bills. I think it is fair of me to say to you Bill, that improving</p>
<p>   the health system and improving the attractiveness of the health</p>
<p>   system is something that is always on the Government's action</p>
<p>   agenda. You never close the book on health policy. I've not</p>
<p>   known a Government in Australia in the last 25 years, that's</p>
<p>   sort of closed the book on health policy and said well, no further</p>
<p>   changes are needed. It's a very important, very sensitive area</p>
<p>   of Government policy. With all its faults, the Australian health</p>
<p>   system is more economical and of a higher quality than any in the</p>
<p>   Western world, and conversations with Canadians and people from</p>
<p>   Britain and people from the United States will remind you of that.</p>
<p>   I had a conversation with such a group only a few days ago on the</p>
<p>   subject of health systems and with all the criticism that is made</p>
<p>   of ours, we have an infinitely better and more economically run</p>
<p>   system and a higher quality of health care delivery than most countries</p>
<p>   in the world.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>But Prime Minister, Matt Peacock here, if I could just add to that,</p>
<p>   isn't the private health insurance scheme still running down.</p>
<p>   I mean the trend is still there.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>It is lower than we would like. It would have been much worse if</p>
<p>   we had not provided the tax rebates that we have provided. The haemorrhaging</p>
<p>   has been certainly slowed down, we would want to see the impact</p>
<p>   of the high income tax surcharge. I think there are a lot of people</p>
<p>   in the, for couples over $100 000 a year bracket still don't</p>
<p>   realise that if you don't have private health insurance, then</p>
<p>   you pay another one percent on the Medicare levy and when that really</p>
<p>   bites in, and I don't think that will be until people start</p>
<p>   filling in their tax returns after the 30th June this year, there</p>
<p>   will be I am sure a new influx of people into private health insurance.</p>
<p>   Matt, it is not satisfactory. It is better than it would have been</p>
<p>   if we hadn't have acted. It should have been fixed six or eight</p>
<p>   years ago when Graham Richardson as Labor's Health Minister</p>
<p>   said, once you get below about 40% you start to have a problem.</p>
<p>   And he wanted something like we did, done then, and the Labor Government</p>
<p>   refused to do it. Matt, it is something that remains under constant</p>
<p>   review.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, we have a few more listeners in. We have Rachel</p>
<p>   from Yallunda in South Australia on the line.</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>Good morning Mr Prime Minister. </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Good morning Rachel.</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>Good morning. Regarding the Gold Cards for WWII veterans. Is this</p>
<p>   only for men and women returned from active service?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>At this stage...I'm sorry, at this stage yes it is. It's</p>
<p>   people who were, who faced the description is - hostilities on active</p>
<p>   service.</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>Another call from South Australia, Prime Minister. Andrew, from</p>
<p>   Adelaide.</p>
<p>CALLER:</p>
<p>Hello Mr Howard. I was just wondering why, with all the reductions</p>
<p>   in the Federal Public Service, why there hasn't been the same</p>
<p>   reductions to the number of politicians because they wouldn't</p>
<p>   have the workload that they once had, because of the reduction in</p>
<p>   the amount of people they are supervising?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, you don't measure the responsibilities of Government</p>
<p>   according to the number of people on the Government pay roll. You</p>
<p>   measure the responsibilities of Government according to a whole</p>
<p>   range of things. But don't blame me, I voted against an increase</p>
<p>   in the size of the Federal Parliament back in 1983. The Liberal</p>
<p>   Party voted against the increase from 124 House of Representatives</p>
<p>   members to 148, and we also voted against increasing the size of</p>
<p>   the Senate from 64 or 62 as it then was, to 76 and can you say,</p>
<p>   I think it was a great shame and I say this with some feeling given</p>
<p>   the voting system in the Senate, I think it was an enormous shame</p>
<p>   that the size of the Parliament was increased back in 1983 and that</p>
<p>   was done by the Hawke Labor Government just after it was elected</p>
<p>   without having told the Australian public that it was going to do</p>
<p>   it and I'm very proud to say that as Deputy Leader of the Liberal</p>
<p>   Party at that stage, Andrew Peacock was Leader, we fought against</p>
<p>   that increase and we voted against it. So don't blame me, I</p>
<p>   voted for a smaller number of politicians.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, we won't blame you. We are out of time, thank</p>
<p>   you very much for coming in this morning.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Okay. Thanks.</p>
