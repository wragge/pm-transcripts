    <content><![CDATA[<p>The suggestion in some newspapers today that Kirribilli House was used for a Liberal Party fund raising event during last weekend's Federal Council meeting is wrong.</p>
<p>A fee of $7500 (plus GST where applicable) was paid by business observers to attend the Federal Council meeting and a series of associated briefings and events. Similar arrangements were in place for the Australian Labor Party's national conference.</p>
<p>A drinks function was held at Kirribilli House for Federal Council delegates. The business observers were also invited to this function. </p>
<p>The reception did not include dinner and the cost of the event, as arranged prior to the Federal Council, will be met by the Liberal Party, not the taxpayer.</p>
<p>Prior to the event my office received advice from the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet that the use of an official residence for such a purpose, provided the cost of the function was paid by the Liberal Party, was appropriate.  </p>
