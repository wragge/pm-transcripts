December 1996 TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
THE HON JOHN HOWARD MP<br />
ADDRESS AT SALVATION ARMY CHRISTMAS APPEAL<br />
SALVATION ARMY, CANBERRA<br />
E&amp; OE<br />
It is very hard indeed to visualise what Australia would be like, particularly at a time<br />
such as Christmas, without the Salvation Army. And that is why I unhesitatingly<br />
accepted the invitation of the Salvation Army to launch, throughout Australia, its<br />
Christmas Appeal.<br />
The Salvation Army is not only a remarkable section of the worldwide Christian<br />
Church and of course Christmas is primarily the celebration of the birth of Jesus of<br />
Nazareth but the Salvation Army is also, as well as being a powerful section of the<br />
Christian Church, the Salvation Army is also one of Australia's leading, most admired<br />
and most loved welfare organisations. There would be very few Australians in either<br />
peace time or in times now thankfully in the distant past, in war time who wouldn't<br />
have been either touched by the work of the Salvation Army or in some cases helped<br />
by them and certainly impressed by them. And when I heard the Army band play one<br />
of the most best known of the traditional Christmas carols, I was reminded of listening<br />
to Army bands at street comners when I grew up. I grew up in the suburb of Earlwood<br />
in Sydney and there was a Salvation Army citadel nearby and they played there every<br />
Sunday evening. And as a very young boy I used to wander down to what was then<br />
called the Earlwood Tram Terminus and listen to the Army band. So it has been very<br />
much part of the Australian story.<br />
The most dramatic contribution that the Salvation Army has made in Australia's<br />
lifetime has been the contribution it has made to the relief of poverty, distress and<br />
helping those in our community who are less fortunate. And I want to ask all<br />
Australians to give generously at Christmas time. Most of us will celebrate a very<br />
plentiful, a very happy and a very adequate Christmas. For those who have well paid<br />
work, for those who are in good health, for those whose families are united, Christmas<br />
is a time of great joy and happiness and great celebration. But there are a significant<br />
number of our fellow Australians who are not that fortunate. Their family may have </p>
<p>recently broken up; they may be out of work; they may have lost their job on the eve of<br />
Christmas; through other misadventure their health may be poor; they may be suffering<br />
a terminal illness whatever the situation is, when the rest of the community is<br />
celebrating in plenty and you don't have much, it can be a particularly miserable and<br />
unhappy existence. And the Salvation Army in its wonderful, open-hearted, generous<br />
fashion, along with many other great welfare organisations such as the Society of St<br />
Vincent de Paul and the City Missions and the Smith Family and there are many of<br />
them they make a tremendous contribution to bringing happiness and comfort to<br />
those Australians who are not as fortunate as the rest of them. And the very least all of<br />
us can do is to put something aside and to give it to help. Australians, when they are<br />
properly asked and their sense of fairness and their sense of compassion is touched,<br />
most Australians can be very generous and I hope they are this Christmas.<br />
I couldn't commend in stronger terms the work of the Salvation Army. Over the years<br />
it's done so much, not only at Christmas time, but at other times of distress and<br />
deprivation for many of our less fortunate citizens.<br />
The Government very strongly supports the work of the Salvation Army. In this years<br />
budget we increased by between 25 and 30 per cent the emergency relief funding<br />
provided on an annual basis to organisations such as the Salvation Army to help with<br />
people in particular need or distress and we are examining with the major welfare<br />
organisations a new methodology to ensure that the level of that emergency fund keeps<br />
pace with real need and doesn't fall behind. So we do very strongly support their<br />
work. I personally admire what the Salvation Army stands for. The gentlemen who... . the<br />
officer who appears in the poster, David Eldridge I think it is I think I recognise him<br />
he is Chairman of the Youth Homelessness Taskforce that I established in fulfilment of<br />
a commitment I made in the election campaign and he's doing a remarkable job. But<br />
the genuine Christian compassion that is engaged in by the Salvation Army is a model<br />
to everybody else. And therefore I have very, very great pleasure in launching this<br />
national appeal.<br />
On behalf of the Australian people I want to thank the Salvation Army for the massive<br />
contribution it has made to the welfare of the Australian community, for the<br />
compassion and decency and concern and the demonstration of the message of the first<br />
Christmas that it has played out in all the years of its existence. And finally, again I ask<br />
all Australians to dig deeply into their pockets and to give generously and<br />
wholeheartedly and spontaneously to the Christmas appeal of the Salvation Army, or<br />
indeed the Christmas appeals of those other great organisations that I've mentioned<br />
because all of them together are doing a remarkable job. Without them we'd be a<br />
meaner, a poorer, a more unhappy, a less generous and less decent society and we<br />
should always, at a time like this, be very thankful. And the poster says it all:-" We<br />
should thank God for the Salvos" </p>
