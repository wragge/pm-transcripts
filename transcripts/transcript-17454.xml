Australian Prime Minister, Julia Gillard and US Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton today announced a major joint initiative to help more people benefit from affordable solar energy solutions.</p>
<p>The US-Australia Solar Research Collaboration initiative will support joint projects specifically designed to cut the cost of solar energy technologies.</p>
<p>It represents a major commitment from both countries to protect the environment by ensuring solar energy hardware becomes cheaper to buy.</p>
<p>The Australian Government is committing up to $50 million from the Renewable Energy Future Fund to support this initiative.</p>
<p>Solar power has significant potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and provide clean and renewable energy.</p>
<p>However, the cost of solar technologies still represents one of the greatest barriers to its wider commercial take-up.</p>
<p>The joint initiative will address this barrier - building on expertise and collaboration between Australian and US researchers.</p>
<p>The initiative will see new research on advanced solar technology projects such as dual junction photovoltaic devices, hot-carrier solar cells and high temperature receivers.</p>
<p>Funding will also be provided for exchange programs and research scholarships focused on achieving affordable solar energy solutions.</p>
<p>The Australian Solar Institute (ASI) - which is already driving research and development to make solar energy more efficient - will manage the Commonwealth's contribution.</p>
<p>Today's announcement builds on the joint commitment to further develop energy cooperation and innovation between the US and Australia.</p>
<p>Australia recently welcomed a US$500,000 grant from the US State Department to support the work of the Global Carbon Capture and Storage Institute in developing countries.</p>
<p>In December last year, Australia pledged its support for the US-led Renewable and Efficiency Deployment Initiative (Climate REDI) to help bring renewable energy technologies to developing countries.</p>
<p>Joint efforts between Australia and the US will ensure that we lead the way in the development and supply of the most competitive clean energy, including solar technologies.</p>
<p>This will provide real and sustainable benefits for citizens of both countries whilst contributing to the global response to climate change.</p>
<p>The Australian Government is committed to tackling climate change - with $5.1 billion allocated to its Clean Energy Initiative.</p>
<p>Australia's renewable energy target is for at least 20 per cent of the nation's power to be generated from renewable energy sources by 2020.</p>
<p>That target is expected to drive and estimated $19 billion in investment in renewable energy generation. </p>
