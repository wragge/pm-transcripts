Ladies and Gentlemen<br />
The Channar project which we are signing today is an<br />
historically important milestone in the evolution of a<br />
mutually beneficial, and friendly economic relationship<br />
between China and Australia.<br />
The project represents a significant new level of<br />
integration of our iron and steel industries in recognition<br />
of the great opportunities open to us to engage in trade in<br />
those materials for our mutual benefit.<br />
But more than that, this project is a tribute to the<br />
willingness and the capacities of the enterprises of our two<br />
countries to work together, despite differences in our legal<br />
and economic structures and traditions.<br />
Accordingly let me congratulate Hamersley Iron and the China<br />
Metallurgical Import and Export Corporation for the<br />
foresight, patience and hard work which has brought us to<br />
this signing ceremony today.<br />
The Mount Channar joint venture provides further and<br />
compelling testimony to the great confidence , and<br />
preparedness to seek long-term cooperation, wihich<br />
characterise the relationship between Australia and China.<br />
This joint venture is China's largest overseas investment;<br />
it is the first overseas mining project in which China will<br />
take a direct equity interest; and it represents a long term<br />
commitment, spanning several years, to continued trade<br />
between our two countries. </p>
<p>That confidence between our two nations has not of course<br />
come about by accident. It has resulted from a conscious<br />
decision on the part of our governments and our people to<br />
enhance the ties between us because of the potentially great<br />
benefits they present to both of our countries.<br />
of particular relevance to the Channar project has been the<br />
support given by both governments to the iron and steel<br />
initiative which I proposed to Premier Zhao in<br />
February 1984, and which we renewed last year.<br />
Let me record my personal thanks to now General<br />
Secretary Zhao for the invaluable interest and support which<br />
he has shown in developing our bilateral relationship<br />
generally but also, in particular, for his efforts in taking<br />
forward the commitments which we have made in the iron and<br />
steel initiative.<br />
On the Australian side let me also acknowledge on behalf of<br />
the Commonwealth the strong interest and support for this<br />
project which has been provided by the Government of Western<br />
Australia. Again on a personal note, let me say how pleased I am that<br />
Ambassador Garnaut, whose commitment to the Australia/ China<br />
relationship has been so important over nearly four years,<br />
is here today.<br />
I believe that Australia and China are on the verge of a new<br />
era of cooperation.<br />
We each stand on the edge of the fastest growing region in<br />
the world and each of us can play a vital role in that<br />
growth in the future.<br />
Australia offers materials and expertise to assist China in<br />
its impressive development and in its far-sighted efforts to<br />
link its economy with this region and the world beyond.<br />
This joint venture will provide a reliable supply of high<br />
quality iron ore to China's burgeoning iron and steel<br />
industry. For us in Australia it will provide a guaranteed export<br />
market for an industry facing adverse world wide trading<br />
conditions and it will materially assist Australia's balance<br />
of payments through to the end of this century.<br />
Expansion of trade between Australia and China has been so<br />
rapid that over the last six years, China shif~ ed from<br />
seventh place to fourth place as an Australian export<br />
market. Over that period, the value of exports more than<br />
trebled, growing at an annual rate of almost 20 per cent.<br />
I wish the joint venture partners well as they bring this<br />
exciting project to fruition. </p>
