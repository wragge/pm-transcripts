    <content><![CDATA[<p>Ceduna in South Australia will be the next community to benefit from the rollout of the Turnbull Government’s Connected Beginnings program, giving local Indigenous children a better start to school.</p>
<p>The Connected Beginnings program helps prepare vulnerable children for school by supporting the delivery of early childhood, maternal and child health, and family support services in disadvantaged communities.</p>
<p>Alice Springs was the first community to commence under the Connected Beginnings program, with Ceduna and a small number of other high need communities to join the program over the coming months.</p>
<p>The proportion of Indigenous children considered to be developmentally vulnerable in Ceduna is above the national average.  The Connected Beginnings program will help reduce this disparity and make a real difference to the lives of children and families in this community by connecting them to vital, practical services.</p>
<p>Connected Beginnings will create strong linkages in Ceduna between local schools, families and child care, maternal and child health and family support services. This is a great opportunity to ensure that families in Ceduna are being supported and that local children are ready for school.</p>
<p>The Australian Government is investing $20 million through Connected Beginnings to better support Indigenous children and disadvantaged families in areas of high needs.</p>
