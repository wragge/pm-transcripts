    <content><![CDATA[<p>I was distressed to hear of Paul Lyneham's death this afternoon.</p>
<p>In recent months he has battled to recover his health after a major lung cancer operation.</p>
<p>Paul was an accomplished, witty and fair journalist who has been greatly missed since his illness interrupted his television work for the Nine Network.</p>
<p>I best remember Paul as a journalist in two ways.</p>
<p>Firstly, his duo with the late Andrew Olle on ABC Radio 702 in Sydney was a masterpiece of entertainment and analysis. No-one was spared and a lot of information was communicated to the public. Sadly, now neither Andrew nor Paul are with us.</p>
<p>As a long serving political correspondent on the 7.30 Report, Paul Lyneham featured prominently in federal politics during the 1990s and most particularly during the 1990 and 1993 election campaigns. Subsequently, he was a great addition to both Nightline and Sixty Minutes when he went to work for the Nine Network.</p>
<p>In my political career I was interviewed by Paul Lyneham on numerous occasions. He was always good humoured, tough and challenging when the occasion warranted, but in my experience never malicious. I found his television style appealing.</p>
<p>I am so sorry to learn of his death. I extend my deepest sympathy to his wife, Dorothy and his children, Chloe, Joel and Matt.</p>
