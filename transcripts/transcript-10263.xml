March 1997 TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
THE HON JOHN HOWARD MP<br />
INTERVIEW WITH NEIL MITCHELL RADIO 3AW<br />
E&amp; OE<br />
MITCHELL: Mr John Howard, good morning.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Hello Neil, how are you?<br />
MITCHELL: I'm well thank you. We missed you at the Grand Prix yesterday.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well I was, unfortunately, I couldn't come because I had a meeting with the Prime<br />
Minister of Papua New Guinea, Sir Julius Chan. That meeting was arranged at the<br />
very last moment and I think people will understand, given the sensitivity which has<br />
now emerged in our relationship over the proposals to use mercenaries in Bougainville,<br />
that I really did have to take the opportunity of his presence in Sydney.<br />
MITCHELL: I understand. I'd like to ask you about that in a moment but first the, I'm sure you're<br />
well aware of the transport strike which we've been talking a lot about here which<br />
disrupted the Grand Prix, that was a tragedy wasn't it?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well I thought it was I mean, strikes of that kind are always stupid. They're<br />
particularly stupid when they inconvenience so many innocent people and there's </p>
<p>nothing that's up the nostrils of Australians more than having their enjoyment of<br />
sporting events obscured or interfered with or limited or reduced by what appears to<br />
them to be selfish, bloody-minded strikes. And it's very hard for anybody to accept<br />
that it was purely accidental that it occurred on the weekend of the Grand Prix and a<br />
lot of Australians would think it was quite deliberate.<br />
MITCHELL: Do you think we're perhaps facing a rocky period in industrial relations or you're<br />
confident it's under control still?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well from my point of view and I'm sure the Victorian Government would say the<br />
same thing, we never seek confrontation. That doesn't mean to say that we will walk<br />
away from a hard decision which makes some people unhappy. But it is not out of my<br />
industrial relations approach to have arguments or disputes with trade unions for the<br />
sake of having arguments and disputes. And for the record, industrial disputes in<br />
Australia now are lower than they have been for some years, lower than what they<br />
were 10 or 20 years ago. That of course has happened all around the world. It's not<br />
just due to circumstances in Australia, but I'm still leading what is a relatively new<br />
government and we've adopted a different agenda on industrial relations which<br />
incidentally has not led to the trouble and the strife and the riots in the streets and all<br />
that sort of thing that was forecast by people like Bill Kelty before the election because<br />
most rank and file trade unionists think that what we've done is fair. We're not cutting<br />
their wages. We're not undermining their basic conditions. We are giving them more<br />
choice. We are protecting small business by changing the unfair dismissal laws. We're<br />
getting rid of compulsory unionism. We're giving people a choice of a workplace<br />
agreement or an award. But contrary to some of the dire predictions that were made<br />
before the election of the new Government, we're not hacking away at peoples' basic<br />
conditions. I mean, I don't believe in that and I'm not going to allow it to happen.<br />
MITCHELL: Mr Howard, a report in the Sydniey Morninig Her-ald today, the suggestion that Cabinet<br />
is looking at a scheme for young unemployed undergoing military training, is that<br />
accurate? PRIME MINISTER:<br />
There is a proposal in the Employment Department. It's been generated within the<br />
Department and we will look at it if it's a fully developed proposal. It's not a central<br />
element of the ' work for the dole' scheme. Apparently the proposal has been<br />
developed in the policy section of the Employment Department. I am interested in<br />
having a look at it. I'm not committing myself to it ( linie dr-ops ol) the details of it.<br />
It's something that has been generated at a bureaucratic and not at a political level, but<br />
that doesn't mean to say you shouldn't look at it. I think we should be open minded<br />
enough to look at all of these things. But I should emphasise that the ' work for the<br />
dole' proposal which I announced some weeks ago and which will be considered in </p>
<p>some detail tomorrow at our Cabinet meeting in rural Victoria in Pakenham, that that<br />
proposal is going to be quite well developed by tomorrow and it doesn't have as a<br />
central element the military training option but if it's something that can be ( linle drops<br />
out) we'll have a look at it, but I am not saying we're definitely going to do it.<br />
MITCHELL: Do you think these are a problem in motivating young people to<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well there is with some young people but others there's not. I mean, one of the<br />
bizarre things about youth unemployment is that side by side with the very sad stories<br />
of how people try very hard to get a job and can't, there are still a legion of stories of<br />
small business men and women who advertise and don't get much of a response and of<br />
many jobs in some sections, particularly of service industries, going begging. So it's<br />
still an obscure picture in that respect. But nobody can deny that there are a lot of<br />
young people out there who are trying very hard to get a job and they need help, they<br />
need sympathy and they need motivation. And what governments have got to do is try<br />
a whole range of things. We've got to try a new apprenticeship approach, which we<br />
are. We have a ' work for dole' approach. There are all sorts of different ways in<br />
which you can tackle the problem and there's no single solution to it.<br />
MITCHELL: Mr Howard, the meeting of the Premiers in Melbourne on Friday came out with a<br />
number of thing I'd like to ask you about. The most basic of course is Federal<br />
funding. Have they been cut as much as they're going to or are they going to have to<br />
go to the well again?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, I can't pre-empt what we're going to put but I can make this observation that<br />
they did make a significant contribution at the last meeting of the Premiers. We have a<br />
problem and it wasn't of our creation but we are trying to fix it. We understand the<br />
difficulties of the States. I don't expect that this years' Premiers conference will be an<br />
acriminous meeting. I don't.<br />
MITCHELL: Well, I think that gets the point through. They also called for dramatic reform on<br />
health and at the same time I noticed HPA here in Victoria saying they are putting their<br />
rates up 11I%.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, I think what they are calling for is more money. You see we've got this situation<br />
where for ever and a day if a State government, and I'm not picking on any particular<br />
State government, has a problem with health, they say, well the problem is we need </p>
<p>more federal money. And yet in the same breath of course State Premiers are calling<br />
on the Federal Government to cut the deficit. I was interested to read out of that<br />
meeting criticisms of a number of proposals to cut spending in particular areas yet<br />
there was a general criticism of the Federal Government that it hadn't cut spending<br />
enough. Those two things obviously don't sit very easily together as you can readily<br />
understand, I think the public would readily understand. The biggest single problem in<br />
health in Australia at the moment is the drift of people out of private health insurance<br />
and something should have been done about that years ago, and the problem is that the<br />
more people who leave it, the greater is the difficulty because when people drop out it<br />
means that the funds push up their premiums, their benefits become a bit less generous<br />
because they are being squeezed and that in turn makes more people unhappy and<br />
more people drop out. Now, there were 61% of Australians covered by private health<br />
insurance in 1983 when Medicare was introduced, by the early ' 90s 1990s that had<br />
fallen to about 39%, and it was at that time the former federal health minister in the<br />
Labor Government, Graham Richardson, said we've got to do something to encourage<br />
people to stay in private health. Nothing was done. We promised in the last election<br />
we'd introduce tax subsidies from the first of July this year and they are coming in,<br />
they have been legislated for and they'll be delivered, $ 450 a family, $ 250 a couple,<br />
$ 125 for a single. Now, they will help, they will help a hell of a lot. But they should<br />
have been brought in years ago and we wouldn't now have, perhaps, the loss of critical<br />
mass in the private health market that we are suffereing. And that is a major part of<br />
the problem, it really is because it puts a huge strain because if people drop out of<br />
private health insurance it adds to the cost of running the public hospital system. I<br />
understand that. Bob Carr belatedly has said that the drift of people out of private<br />
health insurance is part of the difficulty. The tragedy is that if something had of been<br />
done about that five years ago we wouldn't now have quite the acute difficulty. But I<br />
recognise it's a problem.<br />
MITCHELL: Is it an option to increase the Medicare levy?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, there are a whole lot of options that we're looking at. We made certain<br />
commitments in relation to that and we're very keen to keep our commitment.<br />
MITCHELL: Will it be possible?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Oh look, I really don't want to get into speculation about, you know, different changes<br />
in the budget but, you know, we made certain quite precise commitments and we're<br />
very sensitive to the keeping of those and that is why we rule out other things and<br />
we'll continue to rule out things that breach those commitments. </p>
<p>MITCHELL:<br />
What did you think about the Premiers' plan to change the bank taxes is that going to<br />
work? PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I think that's a good idea. That is a State tax and anything that can rationalise those<br />
taxes is good providing it ends up being no more administrative burdensome I mean,<br />
I think it will be less administrative burdensome. I think that was quite a sensible<br />
move. It's not going to make any difference for the amount of money that people pay.<br />
MITCHELL: The Premier our Premier here was quoted as criticising you and your Government<br />
and saying that you weren't leading really did that concern you, have you addressed<br />
that with him?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
No, no, no. There's always colourful exchanges between Federal and State<br />
governments. I mean, we have gone at a very fast pace in implementing the things that<br />
we were elected. I mean, what you've got to remember is that I don't have a majority<br />
in both Houses.<br />
MITCHELL: I noticed the small business index the yellow pages index saying 80% unhappy with<br />
the speed of reforms.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well no, not 80 per cent. That's a very funny index that sort of look depending on<br />
how you read it 80 per cent can sort of be happy or unhappy. I acknowledge that a lot<br />
of people out there in small business are still doing it tough. But if you think of the<br />
things we promised, we promised industrial relations reform and we've done that, we<br />
promised unfair dismissal changes and we made the changes, we promised capital gains<br />
tax relief from the first of July this year and we have over delivered in that area. What<br />
we're actually delivering is much more than what we promised. In a couple of weeks'<br />
time I'll be giving a comprehensive response to the Charlie Bell Task Force on small<br />
business deregulation and there'll be a number of additional things for small business in<br />
that. We've had some interest rate cuts. We are doing a lot to benefit small business.<br />
Now it does take time, I've only been there a year. Many of the laws that we<br />
implemented have only just come into operation. It's only today, no I'm sorry in two<br />
days' time on Wednesday that the core part of our industrial relations changes, that is<br />
the introduction of Australian workplace agreements comes into force. Now I would<br />
have loved it to have been in July of last year but I didn't control the Senate. People<br />
have got to understand that when you don't control the parliament, it's all very well<br />
for people to say that Senator Colston and Senator Harradine support us and </p>
<p>everything, that's not true they voted against the Industrial Relations legislation.<br />
Both of them voted against every element of the industrial relations legislation. They<br />
supported us on Telstra. I mean, there's a world of difference between a government<br />
which controls both Houses outright with its own members as applies, for example in<br />
Victoria and some of the other states. I think Victoria now is the only that is in that<br />
situation and where you've got to negotiate with minor parties and independents, it<br />
slows the process down enormously. Now I think it's important that people who are,<br />
sort of, judging the pace at which we are affecting reforms in Australia that people<br />
understand that.<br />
MITCHELL: Are you frustrated by that?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Look, I wish I controlled both Houses but I didn't expect to be able to get control of<br />
both Houses and no government in this country has controlled both Houses in its own<br />
right with its own members since July of 198 1. That's almost 16 years ago. Because<br />
of the electoral system we have it's unlikely a government of the day ever will and try<br />
to change that electoral system will involve getting some legislation through the Senate<br />
and almost by definition the people in the minority parties are not going to vote<br />
themselves out of relevance.<br />
MITCHELL: Mr Howard, speaking of the Senate we've now got allegations of rorting being<br />
investigated on two counts and, if you like, if you put Senator Colston as having been<br />
from the left, we've got it from both sides of politics. Is it time for a bit more<br />
disclosure, a bit more a rather tougher approach on the entitlements which politicians<br />
are using?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well David Jull, the Administrative Services Minister, is right at the moment looking at<br />
different ways in which the thing may be tightened. I believe that the overwhelming<br />
majority of people on both sides of the House are scrupulous in relation to their<br />
entitlements and totally honest, I really do. Now obviously in any outfit you will get<br />
some people who push things to the edge of the envelope. Now I can't make a<br />
judgement about Senator Colston. He's entitled, like you and I would be in a similar<br />
situation, to a presumption of innocence. It's easy to smear people under<br />
parliamentary privilege and to call them rats and to demonstrate your violent hostility<br />
towards them, but the charges have got to be investigated they are. As far as I'm<br />
concerned he's not going to get any favoured treatment but nor is he going to be<br />
persecuted. He's entitled to natural justice. There are two enquiries if those enquiries<br />
reveal that action ought to be taken at another level well that will be taken and I won't<br />
interfere to stop it, I will let proceedings run their course. </p>
<p>MITCHELL: If that's done though is there any way of if such a thing happens is there any way of<br />
getting money repaid?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Of course money can and should be repaid if the circumstance is warranted, yes of<br />
course they should. And I would certainly support look, my position on this is very<br />
simple, let the guilt fall where it will, let the law take its course no matter who is in the<br />
gun, you know, in the gun sights of the law. I'm not going to give any favours to<br />
anybody, but equally we all know that the Labor Party hates Senator Colston because<br />
he left the Labor Party. Senator Ray made it perfectly clear that the prime motivation<br />
is not parliamentary entitlements integrity, the prime motivation of the Labor Party is<br />
revenge the ugly form of revenge. Now the public knows that they saw the<br />
demonstration of that last week with Senator Ray's outburst. Okay, that's the game<br />
he's playing the public will understand that but in the middle of all of that what I'm<br />
saying is the rules are there to be observed, if anybody breaks them they won't get any<br />
comfort from me or from anybody in my government.<br />
MITCHELL:<br />
Have you been kept informed of the progress in the Senator Woods investigation?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
No because I have enquired every couple of weeks, how is it going and I'm told well,<br />
you know, it is progressing and they have to have a report soon. I think in fact he's<br />
now resigned. I think irrespective of that there'll be a bit of interest in it. I haven't<br />
sought any details of the investigation because it's a police inquiry and it's not my<br />
business to know. It is mny business to know that it is being done and it's being<br />
handled. It's being handled as expeditiously as the circumstances allow.<br />
MITCHELL: Will you grant Colston, Senator Colston, a pair if necessary.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Grant Senator Colston a pair, well, he's not....<br />
MITCHELL: Sorry Senator Woods going.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, it is not for us to grant him a pair. It's for them. </p>
<p>MITCHELL: For them?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Yes, but look, my position on that, so there's no misunderstanding. I believe the<br />
provisions of the Constitution as amended in 1977 ( tape break)... and I accept that if<br />
somebody elected as a Labor member goes then he or she should be replaced by a<br />
Labor member. If somebody who is elected as a Liberal goes, he or she should be<br />
replaced as by a Liberal. There is, as far as I am concerned, the argument we've had<br />
some years ago, the public voted overwhelmingly to change the constitution. As far as<br />
a pair is concerned, well, there's no vacancy in relation to anybody other than Senator<br />
Woods and he has been granted a pair, or offered a pair by the Labor Party. Obviously<br />
if somebody is elected as the Labor Senator left the Parliament, then my view would be<br />
that a pair should be offered to the Labor Party.<br />
MITCHELL: The Premiers also incidentally gave support to Radio Australia and the Asian television<br />
service. Do you take that on board or have they<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, I do take it on board but can I very politely say to the Premiers in the same<br />
communique... my Treasurer was criticised for not having cut harder, by implication<br />
that we still have a budget deficit, yet we are being criticised, we are in effect being<br />
asked, well, we want you to cut but we don't want you to cut in these areas.<br />
MITCHELL:<br />
Mr Howard, you mentioned the meeting with Sir Julius Chan, now, has that resolved<br />
anything? PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I think it was very helpful to both of us in understanding the concerns we have and the<br />
strength of feeling. It is difficult for me to get too precise and I'm not trying to be cute<br />
in saying that because it is a delicate issue and it's at a particularly delicate stage. We<br />
remain very concerned and our position has not changed regarding the use of<br />
mercenaries on Bougainville and the whole implications of bringing mercenaries into<br />
our region and Sir Julius does understand that. I sympathise with his problem. He's<br />
had this insurgency, very destructive murderous insurgency on Bougainville now for 8<br />
or 9 years. It is 120 000, 130 000 people on an island which is far away from the rest<br />
of Papua New Guinea, and there's a very legitimate concern that if something happens<br />
there that will propose strains and tensions for self determination and break outs in<br />
other parts of the country and I understand that. On the other hand we don't believe<br />
that you can settle this by military means and we certainly very strongly opposed the<br />
mercenaries. Now, he understands that, I understand his problem, I don't think at this </p>
<p>stage I want to say a lot more because it is at a very delicate stage. I mean, obviously<br />
we didn't have any announcement to make out of yesterday's meeting but I didn't go<br />
into it expecting to. It was a situation of taking advantage of his presence in Sydney to<br />
have a lengthy discussion and it was very good. We spent about 4 5 hours with each<br />
other talking just on a one-on-one basis, and those sort of exchanges at a time of<br />
difficulty between two countries is very important. There's a lot of good will<br />
fundamentally between our two societies and it is important that we keep the<br />
relationship together but this is one of those cases where this quite serious the<br />
difference of opinion, and it is a very, very important issue.<br />
MITCHELL: Mr Howard, thank you very much for you time.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Thank you, it is always a pleasure, and I do Neil hope that the next time we talk it will<br />
be face to face in your studio. </p>
