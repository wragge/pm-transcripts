    <content><![CDATA[<p>P. M. No. 4295<br /><br />The Prime Minister, Mr. Menzies, announced todayÂ that the United Kingdom has offered for immediate competitionÂ by Australian students post-graduate scholarships to institutionsÂ of higher learning in the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>Scholarships are offered under the CommonwealthÂ Scholarship and Fellowship Plan, under which governments ofÂ Commonwealth countries will provide scholarships and fellowshipsÂ tenable in their own countries by men and women from<br />other parts of the Commonwealth.</p>
<p><br />This plan was one adopted by the Conference atÂ Oxford in July of this year, which considered means of extendingÂ co-operation in education within the Commonwealth.<br />Mr. Menzies expressed his satisfaction that thereÂ was tangible evidence of the success of the Conference after<br />such a short time, and pointed out that Australia would shortlyÂ be offering similar awards to enable students from other<br />Commonwealth countries to further their studies in Australia.Â </p>
<p>He went on to say that the overall plan would not only expandÂ appreciably the opportunities available for Australian students<br />to undertake post-graduate study or research overseas but that<br />Australian universities would welcome the opportunity of having<br />overseas students working in their own graduate schools.</p>
<p><br />As selection for these scholarships will be consideredÂ before the end of 1959, persons interested should make enquiriesÂ immediately from the Registrar of any Australian university orÂ university college, or from the Commonwealth Office of Education,Â </p>
<p>Successful applicants will commence their studies in theÂ United Kingdom in October, 1960, The scholarships will coverÂ return fares to the United Kingdom and the payment of fees andÂ living and other allowances.<br /><br />Canberra,<br />6th November, 1959.</p>
