    <content><![CDATA[<p>P. M. No. 4295<br /><br />The Prime Minister, Mr. Menzies, announced today that the United Kingdom has offered for immediate competition by Australian students post-graduate scholarships to institutions of higher learning in the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>Scholarships are offered under the Commonwealth Scholarship and Fellowship Plan, under which governments of Commonwealth countries will provide scholarships and fellowships tenable in their own countries by men and women from<br />other parts of the Commonwealth.</p>
<p><br />This plan was one adopted by the Conference at Oxford in July of this year, which considered means of extending co-operation in education within the Commonwealth.<br />Mr. Menzies expressed his satisfaction that there was tangible evidence of the success of the Conference after<br />such a short time, and pointed out that Australia would shortly be offering similar awards to enable students from other<br />Commonwealth countries to further their studies in Australia. </p>
<p>He went on to say that the overall plan would not only expand appreciably the opportunities available for Australian students<br />to undertake post-graduate study or research overseas but that<br />Australian universities would welcome the opportunity of having<br />overseas students working in their own graduate schools.</p>
<p><br />As selection for these scholarships will be considered before the end of 1959, persons interested should make enquiries immediately from the Registrar of any Australian university or university college, or from the Commonwealth Office of Education, </p>
<p>Successful applicants will commence their studies in the United Kingdom in October, 1960, The scholarships will cover return fares to the United Kingdom and the payment of fees and living and other allowances.<br /><br />Canberra,<br />6th November, 1959.</p>
