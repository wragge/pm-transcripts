FOR MEDIA MONDAY, 25 FEBRUARY 1980<br />
CYCLONE SIMON<br />
The Prime Minister today sent a message to the Acting Premier<br />
of Queensland expressing concern over the widespread wind and<br />
rainstorms that are lashing the Queensland coast causing damage<br />
to property and danger to life as a result of Cyclone Simon's<br />
passage southwards.<br />
Mr Fraser said that while he had not received a full report on<br />
the extent of the damage caused by Cyclone Simon, the Commonwealth<br />
stands ready to provide Queensland with whatever aid proves<br />
necessary under the agreed natural disaster assistance arrangements.<br />
