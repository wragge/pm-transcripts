In addition to providing advice to the<br />Government on new proposals and Budget matters relating to<br />science and technology, the Council prepares reports in<br />response to specific requests by the Government or the Prime<br />Minister, and on its own initi3tive.<br />ASTEC is an independent statutory body, established by<br />Parliament in 1978.
