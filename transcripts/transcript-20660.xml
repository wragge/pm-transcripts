    <content><![CDATA[<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well ladies and gentlemen, the next week will give me an opportunity of directly talking to President Bush, the Secretary General of the United Nations, I hope also the Chief Weapons Inspector, the British Prime Minister and the Indonesian President about a number of things but most importantly of course, the crisis regarding Iraq.</p>
<p>The one faint hope of a peaceful resolution of this issue is for the whole world to speak with one voice to Iraq, and that can best occur through a strong and unanimous second resolution through the Security Council. It's the one real hope of a peaceful resolution. You won't get a peaceful resolution by displaying weakness towards Iraq. Weakness will be treated with contempt. It has in the past, it will in the future.</p>
<p> If there is to be a single faint hope of a peaceful resolution, and we all want to grab hold of that, then that can be realised by the world community speaking unambiguously with one voice and I'll certainly be indicating that to the President and to the British Prime Minister. And I hope that if military action becomes unavoidable, if other achievable options for a peaceful outcome have been exhausted, then that action should take place pursuant to a new resolution. Not because I believe as a matter of international law that a new resolution is needed. I do not, not as a matter of international law, but because a second resolution would bring of course the greatest measure of international support and international involvement. Any questions?</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, Tony Blair says he is prepared to commit to a war without a second resolution. Will you go along with that?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No our position Geoff is as I have stated it. We make our own position on this.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Is the United Nations threatened, their very existence threatened, by action by Australia, the United States and Great Britain?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well we're not threatening the United Nations. The thing that would weaken the United Nations would be if it fails to act. The greatest threat to the credibility of the Security Council in particular will be if that body fails to match with deeds the rhetoric of resolution 1441.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p> Wouldn't you be better off going to see the leaders of France, Germany, Russia and China to try to persuade them, rather than to President Bush because you know where you stand with him already?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I think it's very important when you have a close alliance and you've argued a position and you have similar goals, I think it's very important to reinforce those similar goals and I think it's very important never to take alliances and friendships for granted, but as Dr Johnson encourages us, to keep them in good repair.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>President Bush is reported as saying that Iraq's time is up. Do you think it will be hard to convince him of the merit of going for a second resolution?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well he has indicated that he would be happy to support a second resolution. He said that overnight.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>The US has upgraded its forces to an orange alert. Have we done the same sir?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>We have received no information in recent times about a new specific threat to Australia. There was a general threat alert in November of last year. I'm told by ASIO in the last 24 hours that there has been no additional specific information indicating a threat to Australia that would warrant any alteration in the current threat assessments.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>What level of alert are we on?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>What we call high.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>High. How high does it go up to?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well there is no need for it to go any higher.</p>
<p> JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>So we're not on a top-level alert?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No we're not on a top-level alert, but look it's difficult but there is no new crisis at the moment.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Colin Powell said that success in Iraq, overthrowing Saddam, would enhance US interests [inaudible]. Would it also enhance Australian interests?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well Australia's interests are best enhanced by the world community taking action collectively to stop the spread of weapons of mass destruction in the hands of rogue states, and thereby run the risk those weapons will fall into the hands of international terrorists. That's why we're involved in this. That's why I'm concerned. Australia's interest lies in a world which is rid of rogue states having weapons of mass destruction. Not only is that dangerous in itself, but there is a real risk that those weapons will fall into the hands of international terrorists. I shudder to think of the consequences for the world if you have a marriage of those twin evils, I think you've got a very dangerous world, and that is why I'm concerned about this and that is why Australia is taking the stand that Australia is taking.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Does that problem include North Korea Prime Minister?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well North Korea will be infinitely more difficult to handle if the world acts weakly in relation to Iraq. I pose the rhetorical question - what chance do we have of controlling North Korea through international diplomatic or other action if we're not prepared to deal firmly with Iraq. Indeed, I believe that one of the reasons why North Korea is behaving badly is that she has looked at the equivocation of the rest of the world in relation to Iraq, and if that equivocation were to go on and that ambiguity were to continue, then the likelihood of dealing effectively with North Korea would be greatly diminished. Anyway, I'd better get a plane. Cheerio.</p>
