PREMIERS' CONFERENCE<br />
OPENING STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER R<br />
22 JUNE 1972<br />
A large number of items have been listed for<br />
consideration at this Conference, and there is also a<br />
full quota of Loan Council business to be transacted.<br />
It is our hope and I presume that it would also<br />
be the hope of the Premiers that, while giving the<br />
matters before us the attention their importance warrants,<br />
we will be able to conduct our discussions on them<br />
expeditiously, and with mutually satisfactory results.<br />
The central object of our attention will, of<br />
course, be the general financial position and prospects<br />
of the States.<br />
The extensive information which your Treasuries<br />
have provided to the Commonwealth Treasury has helped<br />
considerably towards our understanding of your position,<br />
both as regards your revenue budgets and as regards<br />
borrowing programmes, and the problems confronting you.<br />
We appreciate that co-operation. For our part, we want<br />
to do what we can within the limits that our own budgetary<br />
requirements impose upon us to help you with your problems.<br />
I suggest that we should move straight to discussion<br />
on the States' finances generally, and that this discussion<br />
be carried forward in private session where you could tell<br />
us anything you might wish to say in confidence to<br />
supplement the information and advice already available<br />
to us. By approaching the main matters before us in this<br />
way and first reaching general understandings on them, we<br />
would then be well placed to make good progress with the<br />
many other particular items listed for consideration both<br />
in Premiers' Conference and Loan Council. </p>
