    <content><![CDATA[<p>On behalf of the Government and the people of Australia, a gift will be dispatched to the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge to mark the birth of the new princess.</p>
<p>A cot blanket made from Tasmanian merino wool has been sourced from Launceston’s renowned Waverley Woollen Mills. The blanket will be embroidered with the Australian floral emblem, the wattle, by members of the ACT Embroiderers’ Guild.</p>
<p>In honour of the birth of the princess, the Government will also contribute $10,000 to the Healesville Sanctuary, part of Zoos Victoria, to support the important work it is doing for the Mountain Pygmy-possum (Burramys parvus).</p>
<p>Healesville Sanctuary has established specially-designed cool room facilities to support the research and captive breeding of the species.</p>
<p>The Mountain Pygmy-possum is Australia’s only hibernating marsupial. There are fewer than 2,000 left in the wild.</p>
<p>I hope one day the princess can visit Australia and hold a Mountain Pygmy-possum herself.</p>
