DEATH OF SIR JOIJ NORTHCOTT<br />
Tribute from the Prime Minister, Mr. Harold Holt<br />
Sir John Northcott's death brings to an end a<br />
long career of distinguished national service. He<br />
achieved eminence in top military positions, made history as<br />
the first Australian-oorn Jovernor of New South Viales, and<br />
served as Administrator of the Commonwealth.<br />
After his retirement as Governor, he continued<br />
to be associated with many public activities.<br />
Sir John Northcott was a warm, friendly man who<br />
typified the Australian character at its best. He will be<br />
remembered with respect and affection.<br />
