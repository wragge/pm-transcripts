    <content><![CDATA[<p>E&amp;OE..............................</p>
<p>LYNEHAM:</p>
<p>Prime Minister welcome again to Nightline.</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>It's a pleasure.</p>
<p> LYNEHAM:</p>
<p>What are your briefings telling you about the prospect of major</p>
<p>   social disorder in Indonesia?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I am concerned about what is happening and the Indonesian Government</p>
<p>   and armed forces must exercise restraint. Indonesia is going through</p>
<p>   a very difficult time. The adjustment process to get its economy</p>
<p>   in order is not easy for the people of Indonesia and they all deserve</p>
<p>   our understanding and support but the Indonesian Government of course</p>
<p>   has a crucial role. It's got to strike the balance between</p>
<p>   maintaining order but also recognising the great deal of pain that</p>
<p>   people are feeling and the natural desire of people in that situation</p>
<p>   to vent their feelings.</p>
<p>LYNEHAM:</p>
<p>Is anyone inclined, do you think to tell President Soeharto, or</p>
<p>   suggest to him that his troops might not use live ammunition against</p>
<p>   students?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well it's not for me as Prime Minister of Australia to get</p>
<p>   into the detail of riot response.</p>
<p>LYNEHAM:</p>
<p>Some will say there's all the evidence you need that the IMF</p>
<p>   package was too tough.</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well it was always going to be difficult, the adjustment process.</p>
<p>   The package was not as tough as it might have been had it not been</p>
<p>   for Australian persuasion and advocacy. I believe we got the balance</p>
<p>   right. Unless Indonesia adjusts, then the rest of the world will</p>
<p>   turn its back on that country and that will be tragic and the social</p>
<p>   dislocation would be much greater than what is involved in responding</p>
<p>   to the IMF package.</p>
<p> LYNEHAM:</p>
<p>Isn't it the fact that nobody really knows how serious the</p>
<p>   Asian meltdown will ultimately be and that the Budget figures we</p>
<p>   saw last night are certainly no worst case scenario?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I think what we could say about the Budget figures last night is</p>
<p>   that they were quite conservative. A lot of people have expressed</p>
<p>   the view that 3 per cent growth is at the conservative end of the</p>
<p>   range but that was the Treasury figure and we're not in the</p>
<p>   business of ...</p>
<p>LYNEHAM:</p>
<p>Others would say it's optimistic.</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, not many people have said that to me. </p>
<p>LYNEHAM:</p>
<p>Even if the three percent growth figure for next year is the right</p>
<p>   one, we're still being told that unemployment is not going</p>
<p>   to get much worse. Now how can that be?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well there's some in the pipeline as the Treasurer said earlier</p>
<p>   today.</p>
<p> LYNEHAM:</p>
<p>But enough to...</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes, according to our advice, yes. </p>
<p> LYNEHAM:</p>
<p>The Government's next big card is tax reform. Should part of</p>
<p>   that debate include the question of whether we really want say,</p>
<p>   the lowest possible personal income tax or better hospitals, schools,</p>
<p>   roads and other amenities?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>People want a new and a fairer tax system. There's no doubt</p>
<p>   about that. We have a very clear message and we are going to do</p>
<p>   that. </p>
<p>LYNEHAM:</p>
<p>Is your aim to try to make tax reform revenue neutral or are you</p>
<p>   looking at those big projected budget surpluses...</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I am not going to, we will use the budget surplus in the way that</p>
<p>   best advantages the Australian people. I am not going to at this</p>
<p>   stage talk about whether tax reform is going to be revenue neutral</p>
<p>   or this or that. The only proviso I will make is that we will not</p>
<p>   be increasing the overall tax burden. I made that clear in August</p>
<p>   of last year and that remains definitely our position. Everything</p>
<p>   else is on the table.</p>
<p> LYNEHAM:</p>
<p>You've also made it clear that we will have time to debate</p>
<p>   the tax plan before the election.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Oh yes.</p>
<p> LYNEHAM:</p>
<p>Does time mean a couple of months?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I am not going to specify what that time is. There will be adequate</p>
<p>   time for people to digest what is in the package and ask questions</p>
<p>   about it and people will be able to debate the wheres and why-fors</p>
<p>   but I am not going to tie myself in advance of its release to a</p>
<p>   minimum or a maximum amount of time. I am not in that business.</p>
<p>   There is no reason for that.</p>
<p> LYNEHAM:</p>
<p>Has it really taken shape yet? Is there a document?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>We have done a lot of work, the Treasurer and I, and the broad architecture,</p>
<p>   if I can again borrow the nomenclature of pure economic debate but,</p>
<p>   has emerged but there is still quite a bit of work to go. I am,</p>
<p>   along with the Treasurer, devoting an enormous amount of time to</p>
<p>   it. It's a very important exercise. It's something to</p>
<p>   which I am very strongly committed.</p>
<p>LYNEHAM:</p>
<p>YouÂve told your party room that this session of Parliament</p>
<p>   could be the last. Are you trying to put the wind up Labor or are</p>
<p>   you really being serious?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, I think it's just a normal piece of prudence. You shouldn't</p>
<p>   read too much into that. I was just stating the obvious.</p>
<p> LYNEHAM:</p>
<p>But it does suggest that your thinking has become more finely focussed</p>
<p>   on the months ahead, doesn't it and that seems to be mooted</p>
<p>   around the building.</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Paul, Paul we are in a situation where if there is to be a double</p>
<p>   dissolution, the Parliament has got to be resolved under the Constitution</p>
<p>   by the 29th of October so it's now almost mid-May. Naturally</p>
<p>   you get a little more focussed but time will take care of the date.</p>
<p> LYNEHAM:</p>
<p>And that really is an option is it, a double dissolution despite</p>
<p>   the losses you might face in the Senate?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>How else do you get the Native Title legislation into law?</p>
<p> LYNEHAM:</p>
<p>So there's no bluff on the subject?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, I'm not bluffing. I will decide at the right time whether</p>
<p>   or not I have a double dissolution but Paul, I am not kidding when</p>
<p>   I say that as it seems to me now, the only way we can pass the Native</p>
<p>   Title Amendment Bill into law is at a joint sitting following a</p>
<p>   double dissolution. Now whether I end up having a double dissolution</p>
<p>   will be influenced by a large number of factors but if you are looking</p>
<p>   at the Native Title bill, that's the only way I can get it</p>
<p>   through. I mean, imagine if I did what you suggested, come back</p>
<p>   and they knock it back again and I go through this business again.</p>
<p>   People will say, what's the country coming to? I can't</p>
<p>   even resolve something like that.</p>
<p> LYNEHAM:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, thanks for your time.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>It's a pleasure.</p>
<p>ENDS</p>
