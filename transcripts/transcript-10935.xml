<p>Brian, Margaret Reid, my other federal and state Parliamentary</p>
<p>   colleagues, and particularly Ian Macdonald, the Minister in the</p>
<p>   second Coalition Government that has responsibility for Canberra,</p>
<p>   ladies and gentleman. It really is a great pleasure to come back</p>
<p>   to this sell-out dinner of the ACT Division. To reflect for a few</p>
<p>   moments on what the Liberal Party has achieved, and can I in her</p>
<p>   absence because it's occurred since our last dinner, can I</p>
<p>   congratulate Kate Carnell on the outstanding victory which she and</p>
<p>   her team achieved. </p>
<p>That wasn't an easy election. There was the odd critical comment</p>
<p>   made by our Labor opponents about the federal Government, but despite</p>
<p>   all of that the people of Canberra realised that if you wanted the</p>
<p>   Canberra economy to progress and to boom then you ought to have</p>
<p>   a Liberal administration. And at this point it's worthwhile</p>
<p>   my stating, because this is the major Liberal Party gathering that</p>
<p>   I address in the Australian Capital Territory, it is worthwhile</p>
<p>   stating a few facts about Canberra and about the economy of the</p>
<p>   Australian Capital Territory. And these facts make very interesting</p>
<p>   reading against some of the things that are said. </p>
<p>It is true that the size of the Commonwealth public sector in Canberra</p>
<p>   has contracted but the private sector workforce has increased since</p>
<p>   1996 by more than 1000 people, and overall the number of unemployed</p>
<p>   in Canberra has actually fallen in that two-and-a-half year period</p>
<p>   by 2500. In March of 1996 when the Coalition Government came to</p>
<p>   power the unemployment rate in Canberra was 8.1%. In October of</p>
<p>   this year it was 6.7%. The number of young people looking for work</p>
<p>   in that period has fallen by one-third. Retail turnover in Canberra</p>
<p>   is now more than 13% above what it was in March of 1996. The consumer</p>
<p>   price index for Canberra is now one-third of what it was when we</p>
<p>   took office. And the population of the ACT has actually risen by</p>
<p>   2000 in the last two years. And the median house prices have actually</p>
<p>   increased from their 1996 levels. </p>
<p>Now I mention these things to put into context and to try and present</p>
<p>   an overall picture of the ACT economy because fundamentally it is</p>
<p>   a very positive optimistic economy. There have been changes. I don't</p>
<p>   deny the fact there have been a number of restructurings carried</p>
<p>   out in the public service that have had an impact on public sector</p>
<p>   employment. But it's also fair to say that the balance between</p>
<p>   public and private sector employment in Canberra has shifted markedly</p>
<p>   in favour of the private sector. </p>
<p>Many of you will remember that when Sir Robert Menzies retired</p>
<p>   as Prime Minister in 1966 that he cited the development of Canberra</p>
<p>   as one of his major successes. He went so far as to describe Canberra</p>
<p>   as his pride and joy. And he is the founder of the Liberal Party</p>
<p>   and as our longest serving Prime Minister was responsible for many</p>
<p>   things: the creation of the National Capital Development Commission,</p>
<p>   the Mint, Lake Burley-Griffin, structuring of the ANU around the</p>
<p>   institute and the faculties, the Tidbinbilla Deep Space Tracking</p>
<p>   Station, the massive tree planting campaign, the development of</p>
<p>   satellite cities and so on. And subsequently under the Gorton Government</p>
<p>   you had the progress of Weston Creek and the beginning of Belconnen.</p>
<p>   And the High Court, the Gallery, the Telecom Tower were all opened</p>
<p>   during Malcolm Fraser's tenure during his Prime Ministership.</p>
<p>   And the genesis of the Australian Institute of Sport, the ADFA and</p>
<p>   the new Parliament House also owe themselves to Malcolm Fraser.</p>
<p>And with that background in mind, and in the context of that it</p>
<p>   is worth reminding ourselves that during our first term, since March</p>
<p>   of 1996, we have actively supported the very high speed train link</p>
<p>   between Canberra and Sydney which has the potential to provide 15,000</p>
<p>   jobs during its construction phase and 2000 long term jobs on completion.</p>
<p>   And the preferred proponent, Speed Rail, has progressed to proving</p>
<p>   upstage. We've committed $195 million to the upgrade of the</p>
<p>   Federal Highway. We have sold the airport lease of Canberra airport</p>
<p>   to the locally owned Canberra Airports Group and congratulations</p>
<p>   to Terry Snow who's here tonight and has done so much for Canberra</p>
<p>   and for the ACT Division of the Liberal Party. </p>
<p>We've committed $472 million up to the year 2001 for Commonwealth</p>
<p>   construction projects in the ACT. We've introduced legislation</p>
<p>   which is opposed by Labor to provide long term residential leases</p>
<p>   in the ACT. We've chosen the site and design for the National</p>
<p>   Museum of Australia and we've maintained restoration works</p>
<p>   at the Old Parliament House, found a new block for the National</p>
<p>   Archives in the East Block complex and refocused the activities</p>
<p>   of the National Capital Authority.</p>
<p>Now I've taken a moment to read out a list and to refer to</p>
<p>   some notes, something I don't normally do. Something I don't</p>
<p>   particularly like doing. But I wanted to get a few facts and figures</p>
<p>   right because too many of our political opponents, too often, and</p>
<p>   for the meanest of reasons, have been talking down the economy of</p>
<p>   the great city of Canberra and I'm a little tired of that and</p>
<p>   I'm a little tired of the rather limp descriptions of the Government</p>
<p>   that I lead as being hostile to the interests of the people of the</p>
<p>   ACT, and hostile of the interests of people who are employed in</p>
<p>   the public sector. Those allegations are wrong and the allegations</p>
<p>   that we have been indifferent to the economy of the ACT are demonstrably</p>
<p>   wrong as those figures I've read out have demonstrated.</p>
<p>At the other side of the story, and that is that what the Government</p>
<p>   I lead has done for the overall economy of Australia, and what the</p>
<p>   Government that I lead has done therefore for the economy of Canberra</p>
<p>   is a story worth dwelling on for a few moments tonight. I can't</p>
<p>   remember a time that I have been in public life where the economy</p>
<p>   of this country has been on such stable and sure foundations. I</p>
<p>   entered Federal Parliament in May of 1974. I entered Federal Parliament</p>
<p>   in the middle of the three years of the Whitlam disaster. </p>
<p>I entered federal Parliament in 1974 when wages growth in this</p>
<p>   country was running out of control, when inflation was beginning</p>
<p>   to climb, when we were coming used to something that we hadn't</p>
<p>   experienced in more than a generation and that was a high level</p>
<p>   of unemployment. I watched the international credit worthiness of</p>
<p>   this country go down. I watched unemployment rise. I watched the</p>
<p>   public service become bloated. I watched the private sector become</p>
<p>   nervous and hesitant. I watched interest rates rise, I watched inflation</p>
<p>   rates rise. And it's taken more than 20 years for that period</p>
<p>   of instability and that period of chaos to be finally worked out</p>
<p>   of the Australian economy because right at the moment we are enjoying</p>
<p>   the most stable, secure, predictable economic conditions that the</p>
<p>   Australian people have seen for more than a generation.</p>
<p>You really do have to go back to the 1960s to find a period when</p>
<p>   interest rates were as low as they are now. When inflation was as</p>
<p>   low as it is now. When the climate for business investment was as</p>
<p>   strong as it is now. When the reputation of Australia economically</p>
<p>   abroad was as strong as it is now. I've just recently being</p>
<p>   in the APEC gathering in Kuala Lumpur and the strongest impression</p>
<p>   that I bring back from that gathering is the respect in which Australia</p>
<p>   is held overseas. And we are held in respect overseas because we</p>
<p>   are seen to have weathered the worst effects of the Asian economic</p>
<p>   downturn. We are seen to have stared down the economic disaster</p>
<p>   that overtook the Asia-Pacific region. And we have, in fact, come</p>
<p>   through that disaster in much better shape than even the more optimistic</p>
<p>   of us imagined possible 18 months ago.</p>
<p>And that didn't happen by accident, it didn't happen</p>
<p>   by accident, it happened by design. And it happened because the</p>
<p>   Government you voted for in March of 1996 was prepared to undertake</p>
<p>   the necessary surgery to fix the Australian economy. I know some</p>
<p>   of the things we did in reducing the budget deficit were unpopular</p>
<p>   and I know they were very unpopular here in Canberra. But in the</p>
<p>   long run what we have done and the run is not so long because the</p>
<p>   beneficial effects are now being enjoyed by Australia. But in the</p>
<p>   long run or the short run, however you describe it, we have, in</p>
<p>   fact, given to the Australian economy a level of protection that</p>
<p>   nobody would have thought possible or likely two-and-a-half years</p>
<p>   ago. And there is no substitute when there's a storm raging</p>
<p>   outside your country, there is no substitute for sound, domestic</p>
<p>   economic policies. I mean, when you get into trouble around the</p>
<p>   world economically you have got to make certain that you have got</p>
<p>   your fundamentals right. And we did that, and the result is that</p>
<p>   we are seen now as being the economic strong man of the Asian-Pacific</p>
<p>   region. We are seen by those countries as being strong enough and</p>
<p>   able enough to help them in their hour of difficulty, in their hour</p>
<p>   of travail.</p>
<p>We are seen as an economy that has not only got its budget in order</p>
<p>   but as a result of the programme that the Government took to the</p>
<p>   last election we are seen as an economy led by a Government that</p>
<p>   is prepared to undertake the necessary long-term further reforms</p>
<p>   that will strengthen the Australian economy. The programme we took</p>
<p>   to the last election was courageous in the history of Australian</p>
<p>   politics. I don't recall a government that took a more comprehensive,</p>
<p>   indeed, a more radical economic plan to an election and survived</p>
<p>   to tell the story. And the reason that we won the last election</p>
<p>   was that deep down those Australians voting where it really mattered</p>
<p>   knew that what we were putting to them was necessary in the long-term</p>
<p>   interests of our country. They knew that if we wanted to become</p>
<p>   more competitive we needed a new modern taxation system. They knew</p>
<p>   that the message coming out of the Asian turmoil was that countries</p>
<p>   when faced with that kind of turmoil don't slow down on the</p>
<p>   reform progress they, in fact, accelerate the reform progress. And</p>
<p>   that is what we were able to take the people at the last election.</p>
<p>Now, I don't mind admitting that there were times during the</p>
<p>   campaign when I wondered whether or not we were going to win. There</p>
<p>   were times on election night and day when I worried about what the</p>
<p>   ultimate outcome would be. But there was one thing that I never</p>
<p>   had any doubt about during that campaign and that was that what</p>
<p>   we did was the right thing in the long-term interests of Australia.</p>
<p>   And I knew that come what may I would always be able to reflect</p>
<p>   on the period and reflect on what we had done in that election campaign</p>
<p>   and say to myself that we called it right for Australia and we called</p>
<p>   it right for Australia's long-term interests. And every day</p>
<p>   that goes by now that the election is behind us I am increasingly</p>
<p>   proud of the tremendous team effort that the Liberal Party put in</p>
<p>   all over Australia.</p>
<p>It's one thing to win an election when you know that your</p>
<p>   political opponents have been in office for 13 years and you know</p>
<p>   that the incumbent Prime Minister is deeply unpopular and you know</p>
<p>   that there is a deep desire inside Australians to have a change</p>
<p>   of government. And that was the condition that existed in 1996 and</p>
<p>   I had no false illusions about the character of our victory in 1996.</p>
<p>   But in 1998 it was very different. We had been in office for two-and-a-half</p>
<p>   years, there was an inevitable subsidence of the strong anti-Keating</p>
<p>   feeling of 1996 and people were looking at things somewhat differently.</p>
<p>   We have taken some decisions that have hurt a few people, we have</p>
<p>   done a few things that were unpopular in the long-term interests</p>
<p>   of the country and we were promoting something that was easily capable</p>
<p>   of distortion and misrepresentation and that was a new tax system.</p>
<p>   And to win in those circumstances and to win comfortably in those</p>
<p>   circumstances gives to the re-elected Government a sense of strength</p>
<p>   and a dignity and a sense of authority which is even greater than</p>
<p>   what we enjoyed after the 1996 election.</p>
<p>Now, we have ahead of us a tough legislative battle. We have got</p>
<p>   to get our programme through the Senate. All I can say to those</p>
<p>   who sit opposite us in the Senate, just remember that elections</p>
<p>   are all about political parties presenting programmes, arguing for</p>
<p>   them, seeking support and when they get that support implementing</p>
<p>   those programmes. And I want to make it very clear to all of you</p>
<p>   tonight, ladies and gentlemen, and through you to the Australian</p>
<p>   people that we didn't lightly take that taxation plan to the</p>
<p>   Australian public at the last election. We didn't do it for</p>
<p>   fun, we didn't do it for our health, we did it for the long-term</p>
<p>   benefit of the Australian community. And we intend to see it through</p>
<p>   and we are absolutely determined that every last element of that</p>
<p>   taxation plan is going to be implemented for the benefit of the</p>
<p>   Australian people. And we don't say that out of some sense</p>
<p>   of ideological zeal, we say it because we genuinely believe that</p>
<p>   the economy of Australia needs and deserves a modern contemporary</p>
<p>   21st century taxation system. A taxation system where</p>
<p>   81 per cent of Australian taxpayers will be on a top marginal rate</p>
<p>   of only 30 cents in the dollar, a taxation system that, incidentally,</p>
<p>   will deliver if the Parliament enacts the law, a 30 per cent tax</p>
<p>   deduction on private health insurance premiums from the 1st</p>
<p>   of January next year. A taxation system that is going to take $10.5</p>
<p>   billion off the costs of running businesses in Australia. A taxation</p>
<p>   system that is going to make exports $4.5 billion cheaper. A taxation</p>
<p>   system that is going to deliver an aggregate cut in personal income</p>
<p>   tax of $13 billion a year. And a taxation system that is going to</p>
<p>   make the entire infrastructure of the Australian economy more competitive</p>
<p>   and more able to win markets, not only abroad but also to retain</p>
<p>   their fair share of domestic markets against import competition.</p>
<p>A case in favour of tax reform is overwhelming. It's a case</p>
<p>   that was acknowledged and advocated by my former opponent Paul Keating</p>
<p>   when he was Treasurer back in 1986. And it's a case that was</p>
<p>   advocated by Bob Hawke when he was Prime Minister. It's a case</p>
<p>   that was endorsed by Kim Beazley when he was a Minister in the former</p>
<p>   Labor Government. It is the case that has been endorsed by every</p>
<p>   serious student of the taxation system of this country. I mentioned</p>
<p>   at the beginning of my remarks that I entered Parliament in 1974.</p>
<p>   1974 was the year before the first of a whole series of comprehensive</p>
<p>   examinations of the Australian taxation system were presented to</p>
<p>   the Australian Parliament and which recommended as a fundamental</p>
<p>   part of reform the introduction of a broad-based indirect tax. Our</p>
<p>   proposal for taxation reform is years and years overdue. We have</p>
<p>   long needed a fundamental change to our taxation system. We have</p>
<p>   finally won public approval for it. Let the members of the Australian</p>
<p>   Senate listen to the Australian public, listen to the verdict of</p>
<p>   the Australian people and give effect to the wishes that were expressed</p>
<p>   at the ballot box on the 3rd of October last.</p>
<p>Can I finally, ladies and gentlemen, thank all of you for staying</p>
<p>   the distance and travelling the journey. I know it's been up</p>
<p>   and down, I know it's been a bit rocky, I know there's</p>
<p>   been criticism here and there of one or two things that the Federal</p>
<p>   Government has done. But looking around at this audience tonight</p>
<p>   I see a lot of old and familiar faces and that's wonderful.</p>
<p>   I also see a lot of new faces, I also see that this is a packed</p>
<p>   gathering. And I am told that lots of people wanted to be here tonight</p>
<p>   but couldn't be accommodated because it had already been sold</p>
<p>   out.</p>
<p>Now, what that means is that the Liberal Party is alive and healthy</p>
<p>   and vibrant and well in the Australian Capital Territory. That's</p>
<p>   what that means. I mean, you are very lucky you have got a Federal</p>
<p>   Government that's a Liberal government and you have got a territorial</p>
<p>   government that's a Liberal government. And that's not</p>
<p>   bad. You are not only lucky but you are pretty clever. And it's</p>
<p>   a good thing because it's been a very vibrant organisation</p>
<p>   and I do want to thank the President, Brian Nye, I want to thank</p>
<p>   all of the other people that have worked so very hard to keep the</p>
<p>   Liberal Party going here in the Australian Capital Territory. You</p>
<p>   deserve the success you have achieved, it's nice to have won</p>
<p>   two federal elections in a row, it's nice to have won two ACT</p>
<p>   elections in a row and it's great to be celebrating tonight</p>
<p>   amongst friends and supporters. Thank you very much.</p>
