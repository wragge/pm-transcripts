    <content><![CDATA[<p>PRIME MINISTER<br />TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />PRESS CONFERENCE, HILTON HOTEL, ADELAIDE, 7 OCTOBER 1994<br />E EO PROOF COPY<br />PM: Well as you know the Cabinet has been meeting outside of Canberra<br />for the first time this year, and in quite a long time, to get the feel of<br />some of the economies and the societies of the States and to consider<br />particular State problems in the places where the Cabinet meets, and a<br />chance for my part to see members of my own party this evening,<br />and then to attend a fairly major dinner does give you the<br />feedback.. you have the consciousness of the atmospherics, the<br />ambience, of a particular State, and it reminds you of the problems and<br />opportunities, and I think, this has a lot of value. At today, s Cabinet<br />meeting, we also considered some South Australian related issues, but<br />the main body of the meeting the list of business was on general<br />national issues, as in all other Cabinet meetings. But let me just run<br />through the issues for you today.<br />At the top of the list was the question of the clean-up of the<br />Patawalonga area, and the transfer of funds under the Better Cities<br />= P~ d oiit, and I'll be saying more about that tomorrow: with the<br />Deputy Prime minister, and I think there will be more details released<br />tomorrow. We also had a discussion about the MFP, and had a fairly<br />up-beat report from Senator Schacht on progress onfthe MFP. Of the<br />peculiar South Australian issues, we renewed the Commonwealth<br />Government's commitment to a target of 50% of women for<br />overnmentappointments to the Commonwealth Boards andCouncirs,<br />and all Ministers will be looking at their own particular portfolio<br />environments and taking concrete steps to improve the participation of<br />women under that commitment at 50% up to the year 2000. On<br />another matter, the Government also decided to increase funding for<br />child care places in the JET program the Jobs Education and<br />Training for sole parents. Y -u ighr-iemember this was introduced in<br />the late ' 80' s it has been a very successful program, and it is of<br />course, demand driven. It needs more funding for child care places</p>
<p>and we provided that funding today. But it has been a particularly<br />successful program for finding employment training for sole parents.<br />The Cabinet also considered, had a long discussion, about the<br />economic situation in Papua New Guinea some of the particular<br />problems of Papq@_ New. Guinea. That, I think, was the general resume<br />of the Cabinet meefing, and I will be very glad to take questions.<br />J: Prime Minister, how do you get the ambience for a State like South<br />Australia at a $ 150 a head dinner wouldn't you be better off perhaps<br />getting out and meeting some of the wage earners of Adelaide?<br />PM: Well, I think when one goes to Ilet me tell you this, when you go to a<br />Labor Party gathering, you see a good cross-section of the community,<br />and you got an idea when people come up and talk to you about<br />things. In terms of investment and employment, you get a chance to<br />meet members of the business community. You see, I think, we have<br />got the economy growing at 4 and while South Australia isn't<br />growing at that pace, it has every chance now to lock in to the national<br />economy. And a lot of that is about confidence a lot of it is about how<br />the business community perceive themselves here, what their<br />opportunities are, and so, you know, I find that in such circumstances,<br />the chances of finding out what people think getting a feel of the place<br />is a fairly easy thing to do. That is, people are quite forthcoming<br />they do tell you things.<br />J: What can you tell us about the discussion about Papua New Guinea?<br />What was the upshot about the discussion about Papua New Guinea?<br />PM: Well, it was a concentration on Papua New Guinea's finanicial<br />problems for the moment and, as you know, irs looking at a change of<br />its exchange rate system, it has budgetary problems, and we had a<br />general discussion about how we see those problems, how we relate to<br />them, and that is, of course, over and above the more obvious ones<br />like the place conference of _ Bouganville, and the, you know, the<br />volcanoes etc in Rabaul.<br />So was there any decision about Australian action or was it just a<br />discussion?<br />PM: Well, it was a discussion about.. . a Government has to have an attitude<br />of mind to these long run relationships, and longer running issues.<br />And they change from time to time. So the cabinet, to organise its<br />mind about these things, has a discussion from time to time. And it<br />was one of those sort of discussions.<br />J: So you don't expect any action to be taken?</p>
<p>3<br />PM: Well, there is a lot of action being taken with Papua New Guinea all the<br />time. We have just been involved and are currently involved with<br />the training of the group that will assist with the peace negotiations on<br />Bougainville. And in the last month when I saw Prime Minister Julius<br />Chan recently, we advanced Commonwealth Australian Government<br />budgetary payments to Papua New Guinea by a quarter to help them<br />through a liquidity problem. So there's quite a bit happening in the<br />relationship, but you need to re-focus every now and again, and find<br />your bearings again, and then move on.<br />J: Any further discussion about financial injection in Papua New Guinea?<br />PM; No, no.<br />J: Prime minister, there was a poll out this week which suggested South<br />Australians were the most pessimistic about the future of the State.<br />With the change of government, do you think the present<br />administration is going in the right direction in terms of turning the<br />structural problems that the economy has?<br />PM: Well look, as I said earlier, I think South Australia has every opportunity<br />to pick up on things happening in the national economy, and to focus<br />on the things which the national economy itself is focusing on on<br />expo~ s, on added value, on product innovation, and that is gradually<br />hippening in South Australia. You are seeing the product base<br />change towards exports, you are seeing the car companies focussing<br />on exports, you'can see it with specialised manufactures. And one of<br />the things I think, or certainly one of the things I wantied'to do, was to<br />try to bring South Australia more into the Eastern States' economy, and<br />that is one of the reasons why I proposed the building of the standard<br />gauge railway out from Melbourne to Adelaide. Now, without that rail<br />iink-there has always been a rail link but of a different gauge, and<br />that's always been a problem, and I think to do those sorts of things is,<br />you know, going to be important. But in everything, the important thing<br />is confidence and direction, and I think that as the business community<br />here picks up the general confidence of an upswing in the economy,<br />and also the linkages into Asia, the prospects for exports I don't think<br />South Australia is going to have any problem latching onto that.<br />J: Do you think, though, the fear of another round of interest rate rises<br />would prevent South Australia from locking in?<br />PM: No. Why? Interest rates are only 0.7% off their base in the last<br />years or something.<br />J: Prime Minister, on female representation on boards and that, is it fair to<br />say that some Departments aren't exactly getting anywhere near the<br />target at the moment?</p>
<p>PM: Well, its because it's the, I think, there are a number of reason for this.<br />One is that a lot of some of the so-called " boards" ( in inverted<br />comma's) particularly, say in Primary Industry where there are<br />virtually dozens and dozens of marketing and statutory marketing<br />boards -the producer representatives come to a notionally<br />Commonwealth Board, but there is no Commonwealth Cabinet<br />discretion about who comes. Now, we can encourage them, and we do<br />encourage peoplo to, particularly industry sectors of groups, to have a<br />better gender balance in the representation, but often you will find<br />these Boards send along the people that they think are most involved<br />with their industry. And that may not be with a large complement of<br />women. Thon there is the discretionary commitments by the<br />Commonwealth, or appointments by the Commonwealth to those<br />Boards. So in a sense, if you look at the totality, it is very hard to move<br />the representation up rapidly because a large part of the complement<br />of these Boards are not there at the discretion of the Federal Cabinet or<br />the Commonwealth Government. The other thing is, there are a lot of<br />so-called Boards that are not Boards they are essentially just<br />Departmental meetings. You know, it can be the sort of, you know, the<br />something the Defence Procurement Advisory Board, and you have<br />got a number of officers and Senior Public Servants sitting on it. I<br />mean, in a sense, it shouldn't have the status of a Board. So all these<br />things are changing the weighting and complement of what I think it<br />is going to be, and what has already been, a substantial change by the<br />Commonwealth in terms of the representation of women. Much greater<br />than say the Private Sector, and I think we're trying to encourage both<br />our own Departments and certainly, the view of ministries towards it's<br />constituency in terms of the representation of women, and at the same<br />time, encourage the Private Sector to do its bit.<br />J: Does that mean that the 50% target isn't really achievable in a lot of<br />areas?<br />PM: Well, if you say that blanket 50% only a relatively modest proportion<br />of the total numbers involved are there at the discretion of the<br />Commonwealth Government. So I think it's a case of objective<br />measurement, you know.<br />J: But isn't it, I mean some Ministers have been arguing that perhaps we<br />should be moving a bit quicker and perhaps that the target should<br />become a definitive figure now?<br />PM: Oh, that's what in a sense we decided today; that we remain<br />committed to this objective. What we are going to do now is to improve<br />the options that ministers have for appointing women to particular<br />Boards, and then say to the non-Government organisations, we want to<br />see when you give us a clutch of nominees for a particular Board, or</p>
<p>where we have ex-officio members to a Board, we would like a bit of<br />gender balance.<br />Would you be in favour of legislating that in the Private Sector as well?<br />PM: No, I don't think so. No, I'm not in favour of legislating. I think this is<br />something that has to change over time, because its such a huge<br />undertaking to get this change through business, but it's happening, I<br />think. And it will happen better with the leadership of the<br />Commonwealth.<br />J: Mr Keating, Dame Joan Sutherland yesterday took a spirited stand on<br />the subject of the republic were you impressed by her arguments?<br />PM: No. I wasn't impressed by her arguments. I mean, look, I think Dame<br />Joan is a person a most celebrated Australian and a most<br />appreciated one, but I think it is a long time since she has been part of<br />the contemporary Australian debate, if ever. And it is probably a little<br />unfair, I think, on her, to be asked to step into a debate which is shaped<br />by contemporary circumstances, and ask her to give, if you like, a set<br />of relevant and contemporary views. I mean, I just think that in her sort<br />of expatriate position, she's not really able to do that.<br />SBut she volunteered to be involved<br />PM; Well, all sorts of people volunteer for things. It's a case of good<br />intentions are not always good enough, and I think this is a case here<br />without detracting from the standing that she has earned for herself<br />with the country.<br />J: Is the Cabinet Sub-Committee making much progress in relation to<br />Government's response to the Turnbull Committee report?<br />PM: Well, I think the answer is that we have been thinking about it, and we<br />have been thinking about it in the context of the public debate. I mean,<br />we did say that we wanted a public debate we've got one, quite a<br />spirited one, and you know, you do pick up the threads of that debate.<br />I mean, all of us in this room, all your views would have changed today<br />from say, 6 months ago, about what elements of the debate are the<br />most interesting than perhaps was the case 6 months ago. And this<br />does help, I think, in forming your views. Now when we think our views<br />are informed to the point where we can say something that is very<br />concrete, then I think we will.<br />J: And do you know when that might be? Is there a timeframe?</p>
<p>PM:-No, I wouldn't want to commit us to a timeframe, but certainly we will<br />say something about it in the life of this Parliament. I was hoping to do<br />this before the end of the year, but I probably won't be able to.<br />J: Prime Minister, on the MFP do you think that South Australia was the<br />right choice, in retrospect? It has been a long time getting off the<br />ground.<br />PMV: Well, again I think you have got to look at the world economy. There<br />are very great influences on Japan to change. I mean. and to look at<br />other locations. I mean, Japan is going through a structural recession.<br />Japanese savings are so strong, The exchange rate has been<br />appreciated so much that large sectors of Japanese industry are now<br />uncompetitive, and it is simply an imperative for them to put those<br />industries and services off-shore. And you see this in car companies<br />in Australia, and you're seeing it with other electronic plants around<br />North America and Asia, and you'll see it with, I think, the MFP. I<br />mean, that is the genesis of it. But also in any recession as Japan has<br />been through, an uncharacteristically long one, it's not inexpiable that<br />they have wound back somewhat, but then now started to say as they<br />can see their way more clearly to see what sort of change Japan<br />should have in terms of its industrial structure and industrial sectors,<br />how the MFP opens up as an opportunity, and that's is why I think<br />there is more interest, and more genuine interest.<br />J: You don't think that the Japanese economy has become too wealthy for<br />its own good?<br />PMV: Well, what Japan has got to do is lift domestic demand, and-start<br />comnsu m tojm ports and running down savings. And it his been at the<br />savings game for now, what, all the post-war years, and the savings<br />are so enormous that obviously it has reflected now on the exchange<br />rate, and the exchange rate is now rendereing large slabs of Japanese<br />industry uncompetitive.<br />J: Just to go back to Dame Joan Sutherland are you concerned that the<br />comments she made about being served by Chinese and Indians in<br />the Post Office are sort of fostering racial tensions?<br />PM; Only concerned for her. I think that those sort of, you know, I don't<br />want to see her in this period of her very distinguished and truly<br />illustrious career, caught up in a political debate which she really isn't<br />familiar with. And I think it's a reflection on the organisers of this, as<br />much as it Is on her.</p>
<p>J: South Australia has been described as Labor's black hole how do you<br />rate Labor's chances of winning back much support by the next<br />Federal election?<br />PM: Well, the way we're going, pretty well. I mean, and I think also, I mean<br />no party in an election there's always, you know, we're always out<br />there with the binoculars looking for the silver lining. They are<br />bouncing around the clouds finding the lining. Because in some<br />elections you do poorly you know at the next one there's a chance to<br />do better, and I think this is true for the AtrIahaLabor Party in a<br />number of States it's true in South Australia, I think.<br />J: Prime Minister, given that you have one woman out of 8 federal reps<br />from South Australia Senator Rosemary Crowley you would<br />obviuosly see South Australia as very fertile ground for fast-tracking<br />women in the next round of pre-selections is that correct? Do you<br />think South Australia needs more work than other States?<br />PM: No. I think the committment by the Federal Conference of the Labor<br />Party is pretty clear, and State branches are now going to ex . ercise<br />theii-mind about meeting that commitment. And this is going to be just<br />as true in South Australia as any other place.<br />J: Mr Keating, what is your attitude to widows of Vietnam ' Vets following<br />the Governments decision today to accept the links between cancer<br />and Agent Orange?<br />PM: Well, there will be a process about the claims and their relativity to<br />exposure to these particular agents and defoliants, and you know, they<br />will be handled in the way in which other claims war-related claims<br />are handled.<br />J: But earlier today Con Sciacca said he wasn't sure if people would be<br />able to even make claims?<br />PM* Well. I haven't seen that detail yet, no. I haven't seen what he said<br />about that yet.<br />J: Prime Minister, what happened to make you to defer your assesment<br />to the Turnbull Report from this year to next year?<br />PM: Basically just pressure of work. I mean, I have been running that long<br />so hard for so long, you know up to Japan and Indonesia and we have<br />had Parliamentary sitting weeks, and the visits I did in relation to<br />putting together the drought package, and then Cabinet consideration<br />of theso sort of things, and the National Conference. It's very hard to<br />get the collective mind of Ministers and sit down on a subject as<br />esoteric as this and say now where are we dragging all these threads</p>
<p>together where are all the bits, how can you tie the bits up? You<br />know, we'll get around to it.<br />J: How important is the Committee's decision to respond to the various<br />reccommendations or suggestions that<br />PM: Look, I think that the Tumbull Report was a first class report it did go,<br />as it was asked to go to the real issues in the debate, and put views<br />down. Now often you don't quite got that from some reports, but this<br />really did address them, and I think it is a valuable document for the<br />public debate, but it is also valuable for the Government irs one of<br />those reports that you don't have to just take, look through and put on<br />the shelf if s one you go back to, and I think we will go back to it in<br />consideration of this.<br />J; Prime Minister, you mention the Patwalanga.. .( inaudible)<br />PM: Well, just to say that I think that this has the repuation of being one of<br />the worst polluted waterways in the country it obviously has very large<br />influences on this region of Adelaide, and I think that if we can do<br />something to remove pollution and improve water quality, the area will<br />again be used for recreational uses for leisure and I think it will<br />probably have other spin-offs as welt, in terms of a demonstration<br />effect of being able to show people what we can do with water<br />technology in Australia.<br />J. And you are confident that the package you announce tomorrow will be<br />able to ( inaudible)?<br />PM: I think so, and there are other elements of it which I think FI leave<br />until tomorrow.<br />J: Is there anything more we can be doing for Cambodia in the light of the<br />developments over the last 48 hours?<br />PM: No, I think they require some mature reflection Peter. There are, there<br />has been a great opportunity for Cambodia with the democratic<br />elections, but the system has got, the country has got to be made to<br />work, the system of government must be made to work, and you know,<br />I think any governemrnt certainly a government like Australia would<br />be at first looking to see how that political system might work better<br />before one embraces some of the other solutions being bandied about.<br />J, Prime Minister, the worst river you talked about flows past the worst<br />airport in Australia ( inaudible) some detail about the Conference<br />decision last week while you are in town this weekend....</p>
<p>9<br />PM: Well, I thought, can I say that for a new man in the job, ke Rann did<br />very well at the Conference for South Australia with the Airport, and as<br />a consequence, Adelaide will have in the course of these<br />arrangements, an extension of its runway, and that will be part of the<br />scoping study. We can't at this point know who the lessee's of the<br />airport will be. The arrangements aill be such that the extension goes<br />there. Now, that's the commitment that I think matters to South<br />Australia. The detail will get worked out over time. Thank you.<br />ends.</p>
