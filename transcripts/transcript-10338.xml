13 May 1997 TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
THE HON. JOHN HOWARD MP<br />
RADIO INTERVIEW WITH JOHN STANLEY 2 UE<br />
STANLEY:<br />
John Howard, you're not happy with what Bob Carr had to say?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
No, well firstly I made it very clear in the Parliament today that we would commit the same<br />
resources as the New South Wales Government, it's just that we're going to do it in a more<br />
planned and careful way and I reject completely any suggestion from Mr Carr that our desire to<br />
help the people of Newcastle and the Hunter Valley is less than that of the New South Wales<br />
Government, and I ask him to try and keep party politics out of this. It's a problem for both<br />
Governments. We can't reverse the BHP decision. We can however help the people of<br />
Newcastle in the adjustment process. I am prepared to have my Government commit the same<br />
resources. I don't find Mr Carr's way of spending the $ 25 million, that's 10 million from him,<br />
10 million from me and $ 5 million from BHP, I don't find that cost effective and I want to<br />
discuss with him other ways in which the money can be spent but I make it clear to everybody<br />
that we are going to make the same amount of money available.<br />
For him to start talking about, you know, betrayal and I've got an AAP report here that says that<br />
we're not matching the 10 million, well, the answer to that is, we are and I said so in the House<br />
and on top of that I am going to approach BH-P to make a bigger contribution. We are going to<br />
offer assistance through the Department of Employment, Education and Training. I am also<br />
going to get my Major Projects Facilitator, Mr Bob Mansfield, to identify for fast tracking any<br />
major investment proposals that are relevant to the Hunter Valley. I mean, the point is that the<br />
major impact of these retrenchments won't be for another couple of years and the sensible thing is<br />
to take a few weeks to work out the most prudent and cost effective way of spending the<br />
resources that governments are going to make available, not to sort of grab the first idea that<br />
comes into anybody's head.<br />
So can I say to the Premier of New South Wales, our commitment is the same as yours. Our<br />
concern is the same as yours. Our desire to help is the same as yours. Let's put Labor/ Liberal<br />
politics aside and try and do something constructive in a co-operative way involving BHP over a<br />
period of time.<br />
STANLEY: One point I did put to him when I spoke with him earlier was that an initial payment of$<br />
million from the Government without looking at it more closely could lead to a precedent being<br />
set where whenever there's a problem like this people are asking for the same.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well that is right. I mean we've got to keep a sense of proportion about this. Mr Carr's<br />
Government has taken decisions that affect the timber industry in the Hunter Valley, Hunter area<br />
which have involved retrenchments over a period of time, probably two and a half thousand jobs.<br />
In the time that the previous Labor Federal Government was in office, BI-P's workforce declined </p>
<p>from 54 000 to 23 000. Now look, I am very upset about what has happened in Newcastle and I<br />
have a lot of sympathy for the people of the Hunter V'alley and we are prepared to make some<br />
resources available but we've got to do it in a way where it hits the target and we've got to make<br />
sure that the money that is put aside is channelled preferably into programmes that are already in<br />
operation and in ways that return the biggest benefit through training and transitional<br />
arrangements. I just want to say to the people of Newcastle that we are just as concerned as the New South<br />
Wales Government. We will make the same commitment, I repeat that and I said that in the<br />
Parliament today and I am very disappointed that the New South Wales Premier has misquoted<br />
me. He shouldn't have done that. It's just that I rejected his way of spending our money and I<br />
am entitled to do that. I don't tell him how to spend his money and he can't expect, it's not his<br />
money, it's not my money, it's taxpayers' money but we've got control over it, and I want to help<br />
but I just think there's a different way of doing it.<br />
STANLEY: Is there a perception problem though that people want to know that there is something being<br />
done by Government in this situation?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
You've got a huge social, political and economic problem here. There are changes in the world<br />
economy which lead to companies like BHP taking the decisions that they do and communities<br />
closely knit such as the people of Newcastle, they are affected by these decisions. They feel them<br />
psychologically, people who lose their Jobs feel them actually and they do need to know that<br />
governments care and I do, and I accept the bona fides of Mr Carr when he said he does too. We<br />
might disagree as to how best you try and help but we can work that out but we can't reverse the<br />
globalisation of the economy. We can't tell companies who are answerable to their shareholders<br />
that they've got to invest here and there. We've got to try and work with them and we've also<br />
got to remind them of their social obligations and BH-P has social obligations, big ones, to the<br />
people of Newcastle.<br />
STANLEY:<br />
Prime Minister, I've got you on the line. I know you wanted to respond to Premier Carr because<br />
you weren't happy with what he said. I've got to go through the motions. Can you tell us what's<br />
in your Budget tonight?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
You're asking me about what?<br />
STANLEY: The Budget tonight.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
The Budget? I can tell you that it will be, the best description I can give you of it is that it is a<br />
budget that will save and build for Australia's future. I can't be more specific than that. It will be<br />
quite good for jobs and it will be quite good for small business.<br />
STANLEY: Jobs are going to be a key part of it, isn't it? </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:<br />
There will be a lot of things in the Budget that will help jobs.<br />
STANLEY: Okay, we'll here you talking about it with Alan Jones tomorrow morning then.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Indeed. Thank you<br />
STANLEY: Thanks for that.<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Thank you. </p>
