    <subjects>WA to sign up to DisabilityCare; Victoria to sign up to the Better Schools Plan</subjects>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>PM: In long negotiations over the weekend weâve concluded an agreement with Western Australia and I spoke to Premier Barnett last night and WA is now going to participate in the DisabilityCare Australia scheme.</p>
<p>Weâre going to have two pilot projects in the west and I thank the WA Premier for getting on board with our national approach.</p>
<p>There are some unique features to the WA scheme but I think itâs going to be good for everybody, particularly for those suffering from disabilities.</p>
<p>The other thing Iâd like to report to you is I spoke this morning to Premier Napthine in Victoria.</p>
<p>There have been negotiations underway between the Commonwealth and Victoria now over the last week.</p>
<p>And as of this morning we have reached agreement and Victoria will now sign up to the Better Schools Plan for Australia and that is a really good outcome for the school kids of Australia and the school kids of Victoria.</p>
<p>So these are the sort of things weâve been working on in recent days.</p>
