The Prime Minister today joined Australians around the nation to mourn the death of Dame Joan Sutherland - a great Australian and one of the nation's greatest voices.</p>
<p>Dame Joan Sutherland died peacefully at the age of 83 with her family by her side in Switzerland.</p>
<p>Dame Joan will be remembered by opera lovers for her extraordinary performances that kept audiences around the world spellbound.</p>
<p>She was widely regarded as one of the finest opera singers of the 20th century, so much so that Luciano Pavarotti once described her as 'the voice of the century'.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister said it was right for the nation to also celebrate the life of Dame Joan who made a tremendous contribution to her nation, to opera and the arts.</p>
<p>Dame Joan touched the lives of so many people around the world, yet never lost sight of her Australian upbringing and her many admirers at home.</p>
<p>She was generous in teaching and supporting new generations of singers and musicians, and until recently could be seen in the audiences of productions in Australia.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister offered her condolences to her husband Richard, son Adam and their extended family at this difficult time.</p>
<p>Born in Sydney in 1926, Dame Joan made her British debut in the Magic Flute in October 1952. Her 40 year career included a 19 minute standing ovation for her performance in Donizetti's Lucia di Lammermoor in 1959.</p>
<p>She was made a Dame of the British Empire in 1979 a Companion of the Order of Australia in 1975, Australian of the Year in 1961 and received an Order of Merit in 1991. </p>
