    <content><![CDATA[<p>This Sunday I will travel to Beijing to attend the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) leadersâ meeting.</p>
<p>APEC has promoted regional economic integration and fostered free trade and investment since its inception in Canberra 25 years ago.</p>
<p>APEC brings together leaders from 21 economies that account for more than half of global GDP; are home to more than 2.7 billion people and represent more than two-thirds of Australiaâs trade in goods and services.</p>
<p>The theme for this yearâs APEC meeting is <em>Shaping the Future through Asia-Pacific Partnership.</em></p>
<p>Leaders will discuss ways to further liberalise trade and better integrate our economies for the benefit of all nations.</p>
<p>Australia and China are hoping to finalise a free trade agreement so I will also use my visit to Beijing to further these important negotiations.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, I will travel to Nay Pyi Taw in Burma to attend the East Asia Summit.</p>
<p>The East Asia Summit engages all the major regional powers. Its members represent almost 70 per cent of Australiaâs two-way trade and include eight of our top ten trading partners.</p>
<p>It is an important forum to promote the prosperity and security of the region.</p>
<p>I look forward to positive and open discussions with world leaders at both APEC and the East Asia Summit.</p>
<p>I will return on Friday November 14 to welcome UK Prime Minister David Cameron to Australia and attend his formal address to a joint-sitting of the Parliament in Canberra.</p>
<p>We will then join other leaders in Brisbane for the G20 Leadersâ Summit on November 15 and 16.</p>
<p>7 November 2014</p>
