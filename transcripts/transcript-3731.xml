4 ' PARTNERSHIP IN THE PACIFIC AFTER VIETNAM'<br />
TEXT OF THE SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER, HON. E. G. WHITLAM, Q. C., M. P.<br />
TO THE NATIONAL PRESS CLUB, WASHINGTON<br />
THURSDAY, 8th MAY, 1975<br />
It is not quite two years since I last had the honour of addressing<br />
this National Press Club. In that time, as practitioners of our<br />
respective professions, we have all had to cope with tremendous<br />
events and tremendous changes occurring with unexampled speed.<br />
It was therefore with some little trepidation that I retrieved the<br />
remarks I last made to you to see how they stood the test of time.<br />
I find, however, that the very first point I made has been amply<br />
confirmed in a way few of us could have guessed in July, 1973.<br />
i said then that I was honoured to address representatives of the<br />
world's greatest and most free press in the world's greatest and<br />
most free democracy, and that the strength of each was the strength<br />
of both. If this democracy had been less free the constitutional<br />
upheaval of 1974 would not have occurred. If this democracy had<br />
been less strong it could scarcely have survived so traumatic an<br />
encounter. So in'cetn your invitation for a second time, I<br />
again pay. tribute to the manifest and enduring strength of the<br />
democracy of the United States, of which the press is so fundamental<br />
a part.<br />
In the wake of the remarkable events in Indo-China, all of usleaders<br />
in my calling, commientators-in yours are in the process<br />
of reassessing basic policies and relations. For the United States<br />
in particular, this is bound to be a difficult and perhaps'a painful<br />
process. In that reappraisal the last thing the Government or people<br />
of the United States need are sermons and homilies from foreigners.<br />
Certainly, you don't need them from an Australian. It is true that<br />
I happen to lead a political party which strongly opposed the intervention<br />
in Indo-China; It is also true that I am the Prime Minister<br />
of a nation which for many years supported the intervention and<br />
encouraged the escalation of the war. Whatever recriminations we<br />
might have at home, it is no role for an Australian Prime Minister<br />
to lecture the'United States.<br />
It is, however, very necessary that we should prevent the creation<br />
of new myths about what went wrong. And to do that it'is necessary<br />
to look at past mistakes mistakes in which both countries shared.<br />
The great danger is that in an atmosphere of deep emotion andrecrimination<br />
engendered by the suddenness of events in Indo-China,<br />
we should fasten upon explanations and self-justification and<br />
over-simplifications , which would ensure a return to, a repetition of,<br />
the great mistakes of the past. We have, in particular, to resist<br />
the same sort of myths which developed after the revolution in China.<br />
Those myths, those distortions of reality, perverted our relations<br />
with China for more than a generation. They led directly to the<br />
debacle in Indo-China. </p>
<p>2.<br />
We should have no truck with any new variation of the ' stab in<br />
the back' theory that the war in Vietnam was lost not in Saigon<br />
but here in Washington. The truth is that the United States did<br />
not ' lose' Vietnam, anymore than she ' lost' China. Vietnam was<br />
not America's to lose. What was defeated was not the United States<br />
and her -allies but a policy of foreign intervention which was bound<br />
to fail. There was no time in the past thirty years when such a<br />
policy could have succeeded. The tragedy for us all, but above<br />
all for the people of Indo-China, is that a policy so manifestly<br />
doomed from the beginning should have been carried through for so<br />
long. It was never true that the honour and prestige of the United States<br />
and her allies were bound up with the survival of the Saigon regime,<br />
any more than it was ever true that the honour, or prestige, or<br />
security of the United States were bound up with the fate of<br />
Generalissimo Chiang Kai-Shek.<br />
When I spoke to you last I spoke of the ' second opportunity' we<br />
had gained because of the moves towards reconciliation with China<br />
and with the signing of the Paris Agreement in January, 1973. I<br />
said :' For twenty years I have been appalled at the damage we of<br />
the West have done to ourselves and to other peoples by our Western<br />
ideological pre-occupations, particularly in South East Asia. We<br />
are not going to be readily forgiven for throwing away the chance<br />
we had for a sebtlement. in Indo-China in 1954 after Korea, after<br />
Geneva. We have now been given a second chance. It must not be<br />
thrown away.' Unfortunately my hopes, the hopes of the world, were<br />
not fulfilled after January 1973. The gross breaches of the Paris<br />
Agreements by both sides pol'itical breaches, military breache*<br />
made it inevitable that the final settlement in Indo-China would<br />
be reached by the arbitrament of war.<br />
Yet in the wider sense that second opportunity, that second chance<br />
of which I spoke, still remains, the question now is : What are to<br />
be our relations and our conduct towards Vietnam whether there<br />
be one Government of Vietnam or two? Are we to treat Vietnam<br />
after 1975 as we treated China after 1949? Through fear or<br />
frustration, because of our failure to impose the will'of the<br />
West on Indo-China, are we to treat Vietnam as the new pariah,<br />
the new untouchable among nations? No-one supposes that it is<br />
going to be a simple or easy task to establish meaningful relations<br />
with Vietnam,-a Viet nam emerging from thirty years of civil war<br />
prolonged and deepened by foreign intervention. It is going to<br />
be one of the most difficult tasks for statesmanship, for the countries<br />
in Australia's region and for the United States.<br />
Two hundred years ago on 22 March 1775 -Edmund Burke said<br />
' Magnanimity in politics is not seldom the truest wi-dsom'. It<br />
was his great speech on conciliation with the American colonies.<br />
He was advising another mighty nation which was about to suffer<br />
humiliation at the hands of another small band bf revolutionaries </p>
<p>3.<br />
-not because that nation was wicked or weak but because it was<br />
committed to policies doomed to fail. Magnanimity in the face of<br />
failure is much more difficult than magnanimity in victory. The<br />
present prosperity of Western Germany and Japan attests America's<br />
unparalleled magnanimity in victory. The other, more difficult,<br />
response lies ahead in Indo-China.<br />
This is very much a time for a realistic assessment of our<br />
strengths and opportunities and for a good deal of confidence<br />
in those strengths and opportunities. There are those who feel<br />
that because American policy suffered a defeat in Vietnam, we<br />
should be pessimistic about American policy elsewhere, and ignore<br />
American achievements elsewhere. Dangerous and difficult as the<br />
Middle East problem undoubtedly is, taxing as it is for Western<br />
statesmanship, it should not blind us to the wider stability and<br />
security achieved in the world during the past two decades. Who<br />
would deny that the world is a safer place -today that it was in<br />
the aftermath of World War II? Who would deny remem bering Berlin,<br />
remembering Greece,, remembering Korea, remembering Cuba that the<br />
threats to peace today are less menacing than those posed by the<br />
critical flashpoints and monolithic confrontations of a decade or'<br />
a generation ago? I hope we shall keep a sense, of perspective and<br />
reality in these matters, keeping in mind the real progress we<br />
have made towards a safer world, and not allow ourselves to be<br />
panicked or dismayed by lesser problems than those we have surmounted.<br />
before. In the specific matter of Vietnam, I am not going to be panicked<br />
by an outcome achieved militarily in 1975 which might have come<br />
about politically in 1954. I am intent upon reaching a modus vivendia<br />
meaningful, constructive relationship with Vietnam in 1975, as<br />
we would assuredly have had to do some time between 1954 and 1975,<br />
and as with such needless and damaging delay we have done with China.<br />
It is not, however, by focussing exclusively upon Vietnam or even<br />
upon Indo-China that we can get the true perspective of our real<br />
strengths and opportunities in the region Australia's opportunities,<br />
or America's strengths. There can be no suggestion of wanting to<br />
shrug off the events in Indo-China. On the contrary there are<br />
great lessons to be learnt. Nonetheless, let's coolly assess both<br />
the present and the future..<br />
If we look at the Pacific Basin area what do we find? The most<br />
developed and some of the strongest of the dozen or so most<br />
significant nations upon or around the four Pacific continents<br />
of Asia, Australia, North America and South America, are flourishing<br />
democracies. The United States' most important friends in this<br />
vast area, countries like Canada, Mexico, New ' Zealand, Australia<br />
and above all, Japan, have never been stronger stronger in themselves,<br />
stronger in their basic friendship twoards the United States. </p>
<p>The Asean Nations Indonesia, The Philippines, Thailand, Malaysia,<br />
Singapore are working closely and successfully together to<br />
promote their common interests in a natural and viable regional<br />
grouping. These countries happen to be those cast by the theorists<br />
in the role of the dominoes. Not one of them will give any thanks<br />
fok being cast in such a role. Each of them will work in its own<br />
way to accommodate itself to the new political realities in South<br />
East Asia. Each recognises that it is primarily its own internal<br />
strength and resilience which will safeguard it against external<br />
threats. Each recognises that the prime guarantee of national<br />
integrity and security lies in developing the forms of Government<br />
best suited to itself and ensuring that Government is in tune with<br />
national needs and popular aspirations.<br />
There is a further cause for confidence. On the Pacific side of<br />
the Asian region, Malaysia, Singapore, New Zealand, Australia,<br />
Fiji, Western Samoa and Tonga, and on'the Indian Ocean side,<br />
India, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh, are all members of the Commonwealth<br />
of Nations. I have been meeting their leaders in Jamaica this<br />
week. In this rema rkable association of nations not one Head of<br />
Government ' is Communist,. yet not one Head of Government was plunged<br />
into despair because of the events in Indo-China. In our communique<br />
issued on Tuesday the nations of the Commonwealth 34 of them, said<br />
this :' Heads of Government welcomed the end of the prolonged conflict<br />
in Indo-China, urged countries in a position to do so to contribute<br />
to international assistance for the urgent tasks of rehabilitation<br />
and reconstruction and looked forward to the new. Governments of the<br />
region playing their full part in the Community of Nations.' No<br />
panic here, no desperation. Yet, as I point out, many nations of<br />
the Commonwealth are the very nations who are supposed to be the<br />
likely victims of the falling dominoes. The truth is that all of<br />
us have great problems of one kifid or another yet each of us is<br />
basically confident of surmounting those problems in our * own way.<br />
Nor was there throughout our meeting in Jamaica any disposition to<br />
knock the United States, to recriminate against her or to suggest<br />
that the United States will not be a good ally or a trustworthy<br />
friend. Indeed, with the war in Vietnam over, many nations and<br />
Australia is one will have even greater confidence in America as<br />
an ally, for we know that American resolve, American capacity,<br />
American resources will no longer be weakened or dissipated in a<br />
fruitless cause.<br />
President Ford was entirely justified in remarking* two weeks ago',<br />
that because the United States' policy had not succeeded everywhere<br />
it should not be. assumed it had succeeded nowhere. The policy<br />
failed in Indo-China betcause it was foredoomed to failure. The<br />
policy succeeded in Japan and in Europe because it had the necessary<br />
ingredients of success a realistic appreciation of America's own<br />
interests of the people of Japan and Western Europe. It failed<br />
in Indo-China because the policy there was based neither on<br />
America's true interests nor on anything that was possible or<br />
relevant as far as the interests or aspirations of the peoples of<br />
Indo-China were concerned. But the great aims of American policy<br />
can now continue undiminished and undeterred, free of the impediments<br />
and distractions and distortions of Indo-China. </p>
<p>4 The great thrust of that policy rests upon the detente with<br />
the Soviet Union and with associating China in a wider detente.<br />
Nothing that has happened in Indo-China would warrant the United<br />
States being deflected from that great goal. For the essential<br />
mteaning of detente is simply the prevention of world war, or<br />
world nuglear war. It is precisely because this is the highest<br />
risk that mankind has ever faced the destruction of civilisation<br />
itself--that this is the highest goal a nation could ever set<br />
for itself.<br />
I view with concern and contempt efforts made by some in countries<br />
like Australia and the United States to downgrade or denigrate<br />
the efforts being made towards detente. No one asserts that the<br />
present partial detente really solves the great question of<br />
preserving world peace. But to go back now, to retreat from the<br />
Agreements And undertakings already reached, however slight,<br />
however tentative, is to retreat towards ultimate disaster. I<br />
do not assert that detente as it now exists is complete. But I<br />
do assert that-it must be made complete if any of us are to surviye.<br />
We can begin by efhsuring that regions of the world still largely<br />
untouched.-by great power rivalry continue to remain free of it.<br />
In that connection, Australia has lent her voice to the maintenance<br />
of a zone of peace in the Indian Ocean. All of us who support such<br />
proposals, all of us who support detente, know that the difficulties<br />
in the way of achieving detente are daunting indeed. But certainly,<br />
upon our success or failure turns the future of mankind. And it<br />
is because of this that the United States remains the true leader<br />
of the world and, as much as she used to be, ' the last, best hope<br />
of the world'. For it is to the United States that the West chiefly<br />
looks for meaningful leadership in that direction, If detente is<br />
to succeed, it will continue to require American initiatives,<br />
American courage, American leadership.<br />
For many years to come, people like us, America ns, Australians,<br />
politicians, journalists, will be examining in arguments, in<br />
articles, in speeches, in books what happened in Indo-China. This<br />
is as it should be. For so great a disaster, so great a mistake,<br />
such great suffering, cannot be easily dismissed or even forgotten.<br />
Ile shall all have to live with it for the rest of our lives. Yet<br />
even so, we have to go on to the future. In the two years since<br />
I last spoke to you America has undergone a vast domestic, as<br />
well as a vast international, catharsis. With those profound traumas<br />
behind you, with their bitterness and misery being purged away,<br />
what better time to profit by experience and build on the true<br />
strengths of American democracy and American idealism? Here is<br />
an opportunity not-just for America but for all of us to end<br />
our long preoccupation with military alignments in Asia, our<br />
ideological confrontations, our cold war hangups, and open a new<br />
chapter in Western co-operation. Let-* the deeper issues of poverty,<br />
overpopulation and mal-distribution of the world's wealth assume<br />
their proper importance in our hearts and minds. These are the<br />
real problems of Asia. These are ' the real problems of the world.<br />
These, I trust, will be the real concerns of the United States.<br />
With your great tradition of moral leadership, your unexampled<br />
generosity, your vision, your energy, your sheer'zest for<br />
accomplishment, you will find new inspiration in this taska<br />
task in which Australia will be a ready and a willing partner.<br />

<p>QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS PRIME MINISTER'S ADDRESS TO<br />
THE NATIONAL PRESS CLUB on 8TH MAY, 1975<br />
. Mr. William Broom, President, National Press Club: Our first<br />
question, Mr. Prime Minister. We want to know about your talks<br />
with our President Ford. Did you discuss with President Ford<br />
a program for Vietnamese reconstruction? From your talks with<br />
Congressional leaders in our Congress, did you detect strong<br />
unwillingness to fund Vietnamese reconstruction?<br />
Prime Minister: I think it would have been gracious to add that<br />
also at the top table among the expatriates and the visitors. and<br />
the authors is the Deputy Secretary of State and Deputy Assistant<br />
Secretary of State for the part of the region from which I come.<br />
There was some exchange of views between the President and me<br />
on these subjects but not lengthy ones. I can appreciate the<br />
difficulties there are at this stage in asking the American<br />
people to accept greater financial burdens in reconstructing and<br />
re-habilitating Vietnam. I stated the Australian Government's<br />
attitude that was my business and I said that in the Australian<br />
Government's budget for the-financial year which ends this June<br />
there had been provision made for reconstruction and re-habilitation<br />
in both South and North Vietnam and that I had no doubt there would<br />
be provision in the budget which we will be bringing in in August<br />
to continue, and in fact to increase, that provision, and preferably<br />
we would want reconstruction and re-habilitation to take place<br />
through international organisations. Where they have been available,<br />
the Australian Government has . made contributions to them, not only<br />
in the budget but again in the last two months.<br />
Mr. Broom In what way can Australia and the United States<br />
best help in reconstruction and re-habilitation in Vietnam?<br />
Prime Minister Well, I believe in all these matters one has<br />
to consider what are the views of the people of the country itself<br />
and preferably, as I said earlier, these should be ascertained<br />
through international organisations. There may well be some<br />
reluctance, some hesitation, some inhibitions, in the new<br />
Government in South Vietnam, or the Government in North Vietnam<br />
or the Government in Cambodia having relations with the Australian<br />
Government for that matter, or with many other Governments. But<br />
through international bodies, one would hope that there could be<br />
some such consultation. The areas where we have found in Australia<br />
that it was easiest to make arrangements for re-habilitation was<br />
in things like water supplies, hospital facilities and public<br />
facilities of that character, that is material things which were<br />
lacking to a very great extent and in fact had been very largely<br />
destroyed. These are things which are of a non-ideological<br />
character, they are obviously needed and there are obviously<br />
matters in these fields where developed countries, like Australia<br />
and the United States, can and I believe should assist. </p>
<p>Mr. Broom: Many in our audience wonder what Australia's<br />
policy will be towards Vietnamese refugees. Will Australia<br />
honour its signature to the 1951 United Nations Refugee<br />
Treaty and admit them?<br />
Prime Minister And also to the 1967 protocol. We have<br />
already, some days ago, approached the United Nations High<br />
Commissioner for Refugees to suggest that he should coordinate<br />
an international program to re-settle those Vietnamese who<br />
have fled from their country. It -i somewhat unfortunate<br />
that in the region itself there are very few countries which<br />
have signed the ' 51 convention and the ' 67 protocol. They<br />
include Australia and New Zealand and Fiji, Canada, some<br />
countries which still have colonial responsibilities in the<br />
area, like Britain and France, and I don't believe such<br />
significant countries as the Philippines, Indonesia, Thailand<br />
or Japan.<br />
Mr. Broom: Another question: We wonder how you assess future<br />
policies in South Asia and South East Asia of the Communist<br />
powers, the Soviet Union, China and the new Communist States<br />
of Indo China. Do you foresee any attempt to exploit the<br />
current power vacuum in that region and do you see any dangers<br />
ahead? Prime Minister I am not quite sure . hat is intended by a<br />
power vacuum. What has changed, I suppose, is that over the<br />
last two years or more there-has been a withdrawal or expulsion<br />
of American power on the mainland. American power, of course,<br />
in the air. and on the sea is immense, the greatest in the world<br />
and mobile. But I believe that in using the word ' Communist'<br />
we have to realise that there is no monolithic ideology or<br />
action by Governments which are totally Communist or predominantly-<br />
Communist. We have realised for the last fifteen. years that the<br />
Soviet Union and the Peoples Republic of China, while both competing<br />
for the crown of being orthodox Communist Governments, would be<br />
in very great disagreement on the Communist ideology or the action<br />
which it entails or requires. Now, by the same token, I have no<br />
less doubt that the principal occupation of any Communist Government<br />
around the world, like any other Government around the world, is<br />
and must be what it conceives to be the interests of its nation,<br />
its own nation. That is, a Communist Government does not cease<br />
to be a nationally oriented Government. That is clearly the<br />
intention, the practice of the Soviet Government, of the Government<br />
of the Peoples Republic of China, and I would guess that it will<br />
be the attitude of the new Cambodian. Government and of the Government<br />
or Governments in Vietnam. It would be, I should imagine, completely<br />
unlikely that they would all concert some program in the region.<br />
They will be looking after what each of them concedes to be the<br />
interests of its own nation. And the Vietnamese Government, or<br />
Governments, will have their time very fully occupied in reconstruction,<br />
rehabilitation and quite probably reconciliation. </p>
<p>Mr. Broom President Ford, earlier this week, proclaimed that<br />
the United States would reaffirm closer ties with the anti-<br />
Communist Governments of South Korea and Taiwan. Is building<br />
an anti-Communist alliance a viable policy in the light of<br />
recent changes in Asia?<br />
Prime Minister As I understand the President as having said,<br />
and if I understand his attitude after our conversation yesterday,<br />
he has resolved to fulfil the obligations of his nation which it<br />
has undertaken to other nations, and of course the United States<br />
has undertaken obligations, bilateral obligations, to each of<br />
the political entities that the questioner mentions. It is not<br />
forming any new association or alliance, it is honouring<br />
continuing obligations.<br />
Mr. Broom Your country was the first to recognize the Khmer<br />
Rouge Government after the fall of Phnom Penh. Will you protest<br />
the atrocities of the new Government which are being revealed<br />
today? Prime Minister We were not the first to recognize the new<br />
Government in Phnom Penh. We were prompt in acknowledging it,<br />
but quite obviously, to take one example that should be in the<br />
minds of everyone, the French Government acted quite some time<br />
before the Australian Government. We do not have any representatives<br />
at the moment in Phnom Penh there are some difficulties of<br />
communication with Phnom Penh or with the Head of State, who<br />
is still resident in Peking. I have no knowledge, therefore,<br />
officially or in any way directly there are no Australian<br />
correspondents either in Phnom Penh as to what is going on<br />
there. If there is any evidence which comes to us directly, of<br />
course we will protest. That is, in the event of any atrocities,<br />
of course we will protest about them. We have done that in all<br />
the countries it has occurred to our knowledge since we came into<br />
office. Mr. Broom Just one more question on events in your part of<br />
the world. How do you believe the question of a nuclear free<br />
zone for the Pacific will be resolved, keeping in mind that only<br />
one of the ANZUS partners, New Zealand, supports it?<br />
Prime Minister I understand that the proposal for a nuclear<br />
free zone in the Pacific, that is an extension westward of the<br />
Treaty of Tlatelolco, might be proposed by New Zealand for the<br />
agenda of this year's United Nations. It might come up in the<br />
form of discussing the proposal. Now all I would say, my own<br />
Government's attitude, is that we place priority on achieving<br />
Treaties in the nuclear field to which the nuclear power will<br />
subscribe. That is, we believe the first obligation for the<br />
nations is to secure the support of the United States, the Soviet<br />
Union, Britain, China, France, to these various Treaties. And<br />
we have done what we can to persuade other nations to ' sign and<br />
to ratify such Treaties, in particular, I suppose, the Nuclear </p>
<p>Non Proliferation Treaty. When my Government came in, it very<br />
promptly ratified that Treaty and it was encouraging to us<br />
that about a week ago West Germany and Italy and the three<br />
Benelux countries also signed it as well. We would hope that<br />
Japan will do so. We are disappointed that Indonesia has not<br />
done so and that India has not done so, but this is the priority<br />
that my Government fixes in matters of disarmament. We want<br />
Treaties of restraint to which the nuclear powers will subscribe.<br />
Mr. Broom Now that the United States Congress has approved<br />
indemnity, will you approve the use of Australia's ports by<br />
United States nuclear warships?<br />
Prime Minister The use of Australian ports by nuclear powered<br />
naval vessels was suspended by the previous Australian Government.<br />
It applied to United States and British naval vessels. It has<br />
been considered quite . recently again, and in particular, in the<br />
light of the fact that the Congress has now approved in effect<br />
a total indemnity against any adverse effects of the operation<br />
of nuclear powered vessels in Australian waters, in any host<br />
country. There is another matter which I imagine will next be.<br />
considered in Australia and that is the environmental aspects<br />
which are very largely a responsibility of the State Governments<br />
in Australia. We adopted a Federal system from the United States,<br />
we imposed it on a British parliamentary system, but it is in a<br />
more rudimentary form. So therefore, while in the United States<br />
you are used to the co-mingling of powers, so that if any area,<br />
such as a port, there are State responsibilities and Federal<br />
responsibilities, the Federal ones prevail. In Australia, this<br />
is not yet so clear. It is a point of view which I would very<br />
much support myself. The Australian naval ports all happen to<br />
be very considerable maritime centres. The biggest naval base<br />
in Australia, for instance is in the harbour of Sydney, and<br />
obviously the State Government would have to be concerned there<br />
because the safeguard arrangements are in the hands of the State<br />
authorities. Mr. Broom We have a lot of questions about your country. How<br />
things are going there, you know it is a long way away from us<br />
and not too many of us get there. One person wants to know how<br />
is the Opera House doing? Do you have any more architecture of<br />
that sort going up?<br />
Prime Minister Fabulously. I hope so.<br />
Mr. Broom And what are Australia's plans for developing a<br />
uranium enrichment industry?<br />
Prime Minister Australia does not have the knowhow nor, I<br />
guess, the capital to develop a uranium enrichment industry. </p>
<p>We have undertaken jointly with Japan a feasibility study to<br />
see whether we can get the capital and knowhow to estbalish<br />
such an industry. We have some preliminary negotiations in this<br />
respect twith the competing European systems, the one developed<br />
by West Germany, the Netherlands and Britain, and the other<br />
one being developed by France and Italy, and I think Iran is<br />
involved in that also. You might not all realise that Australia<br />
seems to have about one fifth of the known reserves of uranium<br />
in the, shall I say, the West.<br />
Mr. Broom Do you think that might give an OPEC type power<br />
to Australia in the nuclear age?<br />
Prime Minister If consumers are reasonable, no. Let's face<br />
it. The consumers so exploited the employee class and the<br />
colonial economies that they provoked organised retaliation.<br />
What my country prefers is arrangements between producers and<br />
consumers. In respect of renewable resources, crops, we have<br />
followed that policy for decades. We would still like to follow<br />
it. We regret that other countries no longer seem to wish to do<br />
so. In respect of non-renewable resources, minerals, then<br />
Australia has been driven into the situation of considering her<br />
interests in association with other countries which have similar<br />
interests and those associations in which the Australian Government<br />
participated, or in which it is contemplating participating, have<br />
in general been accepted as reasonable by countries, administrations,<br />
like the United States.<br />
Mr. Broom Several questions about food, of which your country<br />
is a great producer. What are your views on world grain stockpiling<br />
to prevent a shortage? Do you fear retaliation from world beef<br />
importers or exporters because of Australia's beef sales during<br />
this time of surplus? What are you doing and what will you do<br />
to aid your ailing livestock industry?<br />
Prime Minister Well, we wish that we could make more beef sales,<br />
and I hope you won't think it begrudging of me if I say that the<br />
United States has somewhat disappointed us in this respect. I<br />
won't say surprised, I will say disappointed. Australia is one<br />
of the few countries which exports beef. There are very few.<br />
After all, most of the world's population doesn't eat meat.<br />
Very few countries indeed can afford to import meat and those<br />
that can are those with which Australia has many associations,<br />
Western Europe, Japan and the United States, and Australia has<br />
supplied all of those markets. Last year, Japan, without any<br />
warning, stopped buying meat. The European Economic Community<br />
without any warning stopped buying meat and America reduced<br />
purchases of meat, and that of course very greatly harmed our<br />
meat industry, our cattle industry. We have certain advantages<br />
of area and climate which make for economies in meat productions.<br />
In those circumstances, we resent the fact that the few customers<br />
that there are in the world, the ones upon which we felt we were<br />
entitled to depend, completely ( most of them) cut off purchases<br />
of meat from Australia. In those circumstances, it is not<br />
surprising there has been a very great depression in some areas </p>
<p>in Australia and I believe that consumers ought to bear this<br />
in mind. If they want cheap meat, regular supplies of it,<br />
they must be regular purchasers because it obviously takes<br />
some time to produce beasts to the stage where they are to<br />
be killed and so on. Now, as regards wheat and other grains,<br />
Australia is one of the few countries which produces a surplus.<br />
Canada and the United States would be the other significant<br />
ones. By contrast to meat, wheat and grains in general] are<br />
things that everybody in the world consumes and always have<br />
and it is easily transported and easily stored and wherever<br />
there is a drought or a natural disaster in the world the thing<br />
which is easiest to provide to alleviate it is wheat or other<br />
grains. We now find in Australia, and no doubt Canada and<br />
the United States find it as well, that the developing countries,<br />
those that have a population increasing more rapidly than resources,<br />
that they are very happy for us to provide wheat on favourable<br />
terms, credit terms, and so on, which in effect mean gifts.<br />
Now other developed countries, ones which do not have the<br />
productivity of the United States and Canada and Australia, are<br />
very happy to provide. favourable credit terms to developing<br />
countries for the purchase of manufactured goods. Developing<br />
countries do not need them and do not even want them. But we<br />
can never seem to come to some arrangements where developed<br />
countries, such as West Germany or Japan, who can well afford<br />
to help alleviate the conditions in developing countries or to<br />
overcome natural disasters, they don't seem very keen to provide<br />
credit to the United States or to Canada, or Australia, to provide<br />
their surplus stocks. I should . point out that, while Australia<br />
is a developed country in the normal context of its economic<br />
pattern, its production, its investment, its employment is<br />
overwhelmingly i. n the manufacturing field, secondary industry,<br />
yet our overseas trade is still in the pattern of our neighbours<br />
or of other developing countries. We depend on the income we<br />
get for non-renewab. le assets like minerals or renewable assets<br />
like crops, or to a certain extent meat, and in those circumstances<br />
we just cannot afford to be unilaterally benevolent to the rest<br />
of the world. Developed countries ought to get together more<br />
in this respect. Australia has had a very bad deal from Western<br />
Europe and Japan. It has not had too good a deal from the United<br />
States as regards meat and, similarly, here we can ally ourselves<br />
with the United States. The rest of the developed world does<br />
not make it easy for us to use our agricultural productivity<br />
for the benefit of people who suffer natural disasters or whose<br />
human rate of increase is outpacing the rate of increase of their<br />
resources.<br />
Mr. Broom To carry that discussion just one step further,<br />
is there any prospect of an Australia/ New Zealand/ Canada/ United<br />
States common market?<br />
Prime Minister Very little I would think. I don't believe<br />
that this is really what is needed in the Pacific. Inevitably<br />
any such common market would be regarded as being for the benefit<br />
of the manufacturing countries and would be regarded as being<br />
to the disadvantage, certainly being no advantage to the developing<br />
ones. What we have to realise is two things. That is developing </p>
<p>countries want to see that the price they get for their exports<br />
keeps pace with the price they have to pay for their imports<br />
and secondly, that there is a steady increase in the processing<br />
of their commodities wi. thin their own shores. After all, we<br />
all know that the developed countries, the manufacturing countries,<br />
are prosperous, not just because of the commodities they produce<br />
but because of the processing they apply to those commodities.<br />
Now the prosperity of developing countries is adversely affected<br />
by the fact that they can't depend on the price they get for<br />
their commodities and they find it extraordinarily difficult<br />
to get the capital, the knowhow, to process a fair proportion<br />
of those commodities themselves. And the Pacific, with the<br />
exception of the countries you mentioned, is very much a developing<br />
area. And the proper way to keep them happy is to make it plain<br />
to them so that it is visible and palpable to their populations,<br />
that conditions are getting better and during their lifetimes<br />
they will be getting better still. And that is not achieved,<br />
I suggest, by just having another rich man's club in the Pacific.<br />
That is having a common market. That is how it would be regarded.<br />
For Australia and New Zealand, Canada and the United States, add<br />
in Japan if you like, were to form a common market, then there<br />
is no doubt that the rest of the Pacific would think that we<br />
were out to take advantage of them. And also I would have to<br />
be quite plain with you. There are a very great number of people<br />
in Australia, and still more in New Zealand, who would think that<br />
such a common market was to the advantage of those companies<br />
which are domiciled in the United States.<br />
Mr. Broom What has been Australia's experience with the TFX<br />
or Fill fighter airplane? Did you approve the purchase of that<br />
plane? Prime Minister We are taking good care of them and Australia<br />
has the most formidable air force for thousands of miles around.<br />
There is nobody who could approach Australia with hostile intent<br />
by sea or air. My party when in Opposition was extremely dubious<br />
about the acquisition of the Fill, the TFX, and there was good<br />
reason for it because we found out that a contract had been made<br />
without lawyers'advice on our part. Whatever you say about lawyers,<br />
it is at least prudent to have their advice when you are signing<br />
a contract for some hundreds of millions of dollars and our<br />
predecessors did not take that elementary precaution. The<br />
Prime Ministers at the time were all lawyers but they left it<br />
to people in the Department of Defence, including a Minister<br />
-who had been a pharmacist, to sign the contract. Well, there<br />
happened to be some flaws in the contract and it took about<br />
ten years to get the aircraft. I suppose one would have doubts<br />
whether it was necessary to have such sophisticated aircraft in<br />
our part of the world. It would seem that it is disproportionately<br />
technical but nevertheless I have no doubt whatever that it is<br />
a very effective aircraft and while it seems to be more than we<br />
need to cope with anybody who is ever likely to approach Australia,<br />
yet by the same token, there is no doubt that nobody could afford<br />
to approach Australia with hostile intent. ' Cr I" </p>

Mr. Broom What sort of retaliation does your Government<br />
plan towards thlie United States if Harry Hopman becomes the<br />
non-playing captain of the American Davis Cup teamn.<br />
Prime Minister This is a sore point that you should bring<br />
along the most distinguished of Australian expatriates to<br />
your hospitable board with me here. We know that Hopman is<br />
the best in the world and we don ' t mind sharing our best with<br />
the United States. ~ 1_ 1_ </p>
