     * The Rudd Government's Nation Building and Jobs Plan will roll out energy efficiency to Australia's suburbs on an unprecedented scale, and provide critical support for clean, green jobs.</p>
<p>     * The $3.9 billion Energy Efficient Homes program will drive demand in industries that can deliver real energy savings for around three million Australian households, relieving cost-of living pressures.</p>
<p>     * The program will also deliver greenhouse gas abatement of 49 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent by 2020  -  the equivalent of taking 1 million cars off the road every year.</p>
<p>     * The centerpiece of the program is providing insulation to around 2.7 million Australian homes.</p>
<p>     * Insulation is typically the most cost-effective household energy efficiency improvement, yet many older homes  -  up to 40 per cent of Australia's housing stock  -  remain uninsulated.</p>
<p>     * Through the new Energy Efficiency Homes program, around 2.2 million owner-occupier households will be able to make a simple phone call to arrange for ceiling insulation to be installed, providing possible savings of $200 on their energy bills, reducing their heating and cooling bills by up to 40%.</p>
<p>     * The program also includes rebates of up to $1,000 to install insulation in around 500,000 rental homes, which are often some of the most vulnerable households in terms of cost-of-living pressures.</p>
<p>     * And we've ramped up one of the other most cost-effective household energy efficiency improvements, increasing the Solar Hot Water Rebate from $1,000 to $1,600. This rebate is not be means-tested.</p>
<p>     * This is a true solar revolution for Australia's suburbs, helping families save as much as $300-$700 a year on their energy bills.</p>
<p>     * The program is also part of the Rudd Government's commitment to comprehensive action on energy efficiency  -  action to help tackle climate change and action that's good for the economy and green jobs.</p>
<p>     * The Energy Efficiency Homes program is already open for business  -  and you can go to my Department's website at <a href="http://www.environment.gov.au">www.environment.gov.au</a> to get on board.</p>
