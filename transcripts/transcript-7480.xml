TRANSCRIPT OF PRESS CONFERENCE ORIENTAL HOTEL BANGKOK<br />
3 FEBRUARY 1989<br />
E. OE PROOF ONLY<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, if I could start with a domestic<br />
political question, could you~ clarify for us now what you*<br />
meant in your answer yesterday in referring to any possible<br />
deferral of the tax cuts that this wasn't in your thinking at<br />
this stage?<br />
PM: it's a case of getting unnecessarily knicker knotted<br />
over a phrase on your part. I have made clear consistently<br />
that the tax cuts will come in on the first of July, period.<br />
JOURNALIST: Is Australia trying to convince Thailand of the<br />
necessity of building a new economic bloc in. Asia Pacific to<br />
fight against* 41992 single market in Europe and if so what is<br />
the role of Thailand? And my second question is does<br />
Australia intend to pursue the aim of bringing the Khmer<br />
Rouge Pol Pot into international courts?<br />
PM: On the first question my suggestion has been firstly in<br />
my recent visit to the Republic of Korea and again in my<br />
discussions with your Prime Minister that we ought in the<br />
region to examine how we can increase co-operation,<br />
particularly in the economic, social field between us because<br />
we are living in a world as I put it of para-dox. The paradox<br />
ithat there has never been more reason and ground for<br />
optimism on the political front in the international<br />
relations area than now. But against that there are very<br />
serious causes for concern and some degree of pessimism about<br />
the way in which nations are behaving in their international<br />
economic relations. And so I have said that it makes sense<br />
for this region which is the fastest growing most dynamic<br />
region of the world to think about the ways in which we can<br />
increase our co-operation and I suggested that a model<br />
without being prescriptive about it could be an OECD type<br />
organisation which is not a trading bloc. And that is not my<br />
suggestion that that sort of model, however, could provide a<br />
sensible and constructive and very useful mechanism whereby<br />
the countries of this dynamic economic region would be able<br />
to interchange information and also use their influence as a<br />
group upon the recalcitrant members of the international<br />
community, by which we basically mean increasing stand-ofts<br />
between the European community and the United States, that we<br />
as the most significant economic region in the world could<br />
say to them " Look it's time you came to your senses" and that </p>

P M: 11l -t depends on what you're alk iriq ou;<br />
" 1JRA. * ST Trading bc </p>
<p>PM: Trading bloc. Well if you look at the facts of<br />
production and trade the region thar I am talking about at<br />
the present time provides more than half of the production.<br />
It's larger than the other two and in terms of trade is going<br />
to be, is already, the most important area and will be<br />
increasingly so. So if you just look in aggregates and<br />
production and trade it can be more significant. But I don't<br />
want to approach these issues in terms of saying we are<br />
bigger, stronger, got more stick than you. I mean it is that<br />
sort of attitude which is counter-productive at the moment.<br />
We are seeing the relationships between the United States and<br />
Europe deteriorate into that sort of situation now and not<br />
only the general discussions but now its degenerating more<br />
particularly as a result of the argument they are having over<br />
the hormones issue that Americans ace saying well we are<br />
going to) in retaliation to you stopping the access of our<br />
meat, we are going to stop an equivalent or greater<br />
equivalent amount of your product-coming into our country.<br />
It's this concept of who is the more powerful, who can use<br />
the greater stick to hit the other one which is precisely<br />
the sort of thing that we want to avoid.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, do you have a time frame within<br />
which the Asia Pacific Group might begintrealise T mean<br />
should we wait to the end of the Uruguay Round talkinq<br />
two years, three years.<br />
PM: Well its artificial to put time frames on it. The<br />
sensible and intelligent way of looking at it is that we<br />
ought to process as quickly as possible, I believe, the<br />
consultative mechanisms, the sounding out of the countries in<br />
the region as to how they want to see our forms of<br />
co-operation increase including a consideration of the type<br />
of model that I have talked about. Now on that process I<br />
have said that I would hope that by the end of this year we<br />
could have a ministerial type meeting on that. It is not an<br />
issue which can be rushed because you have not only the<br />
question of individual perspectives and perceptions but also<br />
you have the existence of ASEAN and the members of ASEAN will<br />
want to consider their attitude to this issue in relationship<br />
to what their membership of ASEAN means. So quite clearly<br />
the processes of discussion, preparation, if there is overall<br />
a positive response to the concept will take the best part of<br />
this year to get towards a productive ministerial type<br />
meeting. Now while that's going on you have got the process<br />
under the adjourned Montreal meeting, if I can put it that<br />
way, with the agreement that there will be a meeting in<br />
Geneva in April. Now between now and April a lot of<br />
discussions are going on. For my part I have written strong<br />
letters to President Bush and to the major political leaders<br />
in Europe and have put a very hard line to them as to the<br />
obligation which rests upon them to use this time between now<br />
and April to produce a more productive result. Because what<br />
you have got to understand is; that a consideraole amount of<br />
progress has been made in the Uruquay Round discussions. </p>
<p>Agreements, the basis of agreem~ ent has been reached on Pleven<br />
out of the fifteen heads and the ? our that are ieft with<br />
agriculture, textiles and safeguards and intellectual<br />
property, those tour out ot the iifteen disagreement 3re<br />
holding up agreement on the eleven areas. So there is a very<br />
strong incentive for intelligent leadership around tne world<br />
to make use of this period between now anda April. Now<br />
obviously if good sense prevails against the more pessimistic<br />
s. cen~ ario thlat some people have been recently projectin t: h en<br />
the type of pressures and thinking that would ba going into<br />
our regional perceptions would be different. So to put a<br />
timetable on the possible emergence of some bloc is n~ ot<br />
really the right way to approach it. 1 want to see the work<br />
done on this region~ al concept becaus. e whatever assumption you<br />
make about the outcome of the NNCN Round there is a role and<br />
purpose for this regional grouping. it may nave ior the most<br />
pessimistic scenario another purpose but you won't know that<br />
until quite a way down the track.<br />
JOURNALST: Prime Minister, there's specu: lation about a<br />
potential Australian role in settlement in Kampouchea, so<br />
do you think Australia should be involved in som: e way or<br />
another, and how do yiou see that kind of involvement, what<br />
role, and thirdly his it arisen in any discussions you have<br />
had with Thai leaders here?<br />
PM: Aust: ralia should have a role an this condition. We are<br />
qualified, we are part of the region and we have a continuing<br />
well established interest, but we should have a role if we<br />
are wanted. Australia has never taken the view, ana<br />
certainly under my leadership, hasn't taken the view that<br />
here we are whether it be here or the Middle East or<br />
somewhere else, our name's Australia shift over we are going<br />
to come and fix it up that's not our approach. We do have<br />
a legitimate interest and if we are wanted then we will be<br />
prepared and happy to play a role. You ask what sort Of 3<br />
oie, well the qluestion which precedes that is that the<br />
participants in the discussions that are goin; an and the<br />
various strands of discussion. As you know there are many.<br />
There's the discussions between Vietnam and China, there's<br />
the discussions between the Soviet Union and China, there's<br />
discussions between Thailand and Laos and Cambodia and<br />
Vietnam and there is the JIM meetings. I mean you have got<br />
to understand there's a whole number of streams of<br />
discussions going on. Now out ot those discussions if it<br />
emerges that, if we could term it, the major directly<br />
involved parties want Australia in, then we'll be in. Now<br />
you ask what would the role be. You can't answer that<br />
question because the parties haven't answered the question<br />
themselves. There is as you know a difference of view<br />
between whether at one extreme you would have a military<br />
peacekeeping force or at the other extreme a totally unarmei<br />
body limited entirely to a monitoring process of the<br />
elections. Now therefore what role Australia would have must<br />
be an outcome of what sort of agreement is reached on the<br />
role of what is now, ini the absence of a final agreement, </p>
<p>called an international control mechanism. I mean the<br />
concept of a peacekeeping force, that phrase has been put<br />
aside and the control commission is put aside and they have<br />
used this general phrase, mechanism. They have got to put<br />
content into what they want the mechanism to be and what<br />
function there is for it to be because before I can answer<br />
your question, what will Australia's role be?<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, the Foreign Minister has said he<br />
doesn't think Australia should put an armed force in. Do you<br />
agree wit that view?<br />
PM: Well prima facie that would be the obvious Australian<br />
position. You prefer positions where you don't have armed<br />
personnel involved. Now neither the Foreign Minister nor I<br />
would rule out if you had agreement that there was a need for<br />
some component of that type, we would obviously consider<br />
that. but our preference would be for . n involvement which<br />
was not of that type. But we are committed to playing a<br />
positive and constructive role in the process, we have made<br />
that clear and in the discussions that I have had already at<br />
this point it seems to be very clear that there is a desire<br />
among the participants, as far an I can see, for an<br />
Australian presence.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, Australian dollar<br />
Senator Button says the economic fundamentals indicate that<br />
the dollar should not continue to rise. Is that. a view that<br />
you endorse?<br />
PM: Well I tend on these questions to basically conduct my<br />
discussions and express my views within the Government<br />
framework. I certainly intend to do that and I certainly<br />
don't intend to aive some exposition on what's happening to<br />
the SA from the Oriental Hotel in Bangkok.<br />
JOURNALIST: Senator Evans has said that he is concerned<br />
about the plight of the Vietnamese refugees in Hong Kong.<br />
Also your hosts have a lot of Vietnamese and other refugees,<br />
Kampuchean refugees in Thailand. Is Australia prepared to be<br />
more flexible in accepting refugees?<br />
PM: I don't think the question needs lo be put to Australia<br />
about whether we need to be more flexible. The simple<br />
indisputable and accepted fact Internationally is that on a<br />
per capita basis Australia has done more in accepting<br />
refugees than any other country, including the United States.<br />
So that's the actual figure. We've done more. Our<br />
record is outstanding. Therefore I don't think we need to be<br />
talking about doing more. What we are doing is conducting<br />
sensible discussions with countries in the region, and it has<br />
certainly risen in my discussions here that there needs to be<br />
a fully involved internationl conference this year. That<br />
will be held we believe it looks as though it will be the<br />
middle of the year, probably in Geneva. We'll be there, it<br />
looks as though Vietnam will be there and we want to see out </p>
<p>of that international conference the achievement of the<br />
objectives which sensibly everyone has in mind. That is, to<br />
have to the extent that there's going to be departures from<br />
Vietnam, that they be orderly and acceptably organised, that<br />
the pressures of first asylum that have been pressing so<br />
much, particularly upon Thailand, are eased and made<br />
acceptable. Those are the sorts of things that need to be<br />
worked out in such an international conference and Australia<br />
will be prepared to play its part in that conference. We've<br />
said so and we do that from a position of great strength i. n<br />
terms of our record. We don't have to talk about being more<br />
flexible or more generous. No-one has been as generous as we<br />
have. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Do you think it's time as the Treasurer suggests<br />
for middle class Australians to give up the idea of having<br />
homes hiV swimming pools and Hills hoists?<br />
PM: I think on my reading of what's happened that the<br />
Treasurer has been somewhat unfairly beaten up on this issue<br />
not that he's a poor defenceless fellow, he can look after<br />
himself as you know. But just let me make this point, simply<br />
that we live in a rapidly changing world now in which for<br />
some people, and just put in terms of the interests and<br />
preferences of people, that for a lot of people the concept<br />
of having access to medium, higher density relatively inner<br />
city housing, for a lot of people, has a greater relative<br />
attraction than building a long way out further away from<br />
place of work. That's not a question of Paul Keating's<br />
opinion or Bob Hawke's opinion and it just is a fact of life.<br />
For a lot of people that. is the case. It is the case that<br />
the attitudes of a number of regulatory agencies, including<br />
local governments, are rooted in a more historical<br />
conventional view of what the nature of preferences are. Now<br />
to the extent that what the Treasurer has said is opening up<br />
discussion about the desirability of looking at facilitating<br />
more of that type of housing which would be attractive to a<br />
lot of Australians then that's a good thing. It looks as<br />
though on what Mr Greiner has now announced that it's had<br />
precisely that effect. So this is not a question of saying<br />
that the dream of those who do desire. who have the<br />
preference of a block of their own, that's that's<br />
disappeared. It's just a realistic thing to acknowledge that<br />
for a lot of people the historical aspiration of that<br />
separate block may not be as attractive in these days as<br />
having access to attractive or higher density type<br />
accommodation closer to the city. So that's a perfectly sane<br />
thinq to have on the table.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, getting back to the Khmer Rouge. If<br />
the effective . leadership of the Khmer Rouge is rejected in<br />
advance by Phnom Penh, how can there be a political role for<br />
the Khmer Rouge and the second part of that question is your<br />
foreign minister said that if aid were cut to the Khmer Rouge<br />
that they would fade away and cease to be a threat. Is that<br />
not a little bit naive and even if it took five or ten years<br />
for the Khmer Rouge to fade away, wouldn't hundreds if not<br />
thousands of people still die?<br />
PM: These are precisely the questions which are being<br />
discussed now at the various levels that I talked about<br />
before, including the discussions between the Soviet Union<br />
and China, and China and Vietnam and the other strands that<br />
I'm talking about. It would be quite ridiculous for me or<br />
for anyone else to give you an unequivocal statement as to<br />
what the impact would be in the areas that you talk about<br />
because you can't be certain of this. Certainly I can't.<br />
But what you can be certain of is that the parties directly<br />
involved are now getting closer, much closer towards<br />
accepting that there can be no outcome which will allow the<br />
possibility of the Khmer Rouge resuming a position of<br />
dominance. That is not something that has to be forced for<br />
instance upon the Chinese who have been the most substantiai<br />
supporters and supplier of arms to the Khmer Rouge. They </p>
<p>iccept that position. So what has got to be worked out is<br />
how, for those elements of the Khmer Rouge that to the<br />
participants are acceptable as part of the process, how they<br />
are integrated into the outcome. What seems to be accepted<br />
is that there can be an identification of a number, the<br />
number not being certain yet, but ot a number of leaders of<br />
the Khmei Rouge who simply are not acceptable. There is some<br />
difference as to what that number is but you're not in<br />
different ball parks of argument. There will need to be in<br />
the discussions, in the negotiations, a way of quarantining<br />
the unacceptable figures. That doesn't mean that for the<br />
faction there cannot be seen to be a place. Now that's<br />
precisely one of the central issues that's involved in all<br />
the discussions that are going on and I get the impression,<br />
if 1 can put it this way, from the very generously detailed<br />
briefing that I have been given both by the Prime Minister<br />
and Foreign Minister Siddhi that they have optimism that this<br />
precise issue is capable of being worked out. If it is then<br />
the second part of your question is non-operative. They are<br />
not going to in other words agree to an outcome which leaves<br />
open the possibility of some return to the atrocities and<br />
barbarities of the past.<br />
JOURNALIST: What role do you see for Prince Sihanouk and do<br />
you think he'll go to the Jakarta talks?<br />
PM: I li. ke tne phrase that was used to me yesterday, I see<br />
it was in the press, that when the boat finally pulls out the<br />
Prince is usually aboard. I see that it is still the<br />
position from all the discussions I've had and reports I've<br />
received there is fairly common ground that Prince Sihanouk<br />
retains a posi. tion of centrality in the perceived outcome.<br />
He was somewhat off-put, if we can put it that way, by the<br />
recent reception here of the other participants in<br />
the CGDK grouping that came to Bangkok that upset him a<br />
little bit. But Im aware that the Prime Minister of<br />
Thailand has a long history of close personal friendships and<br />
relationships with Prince Sihanouk. There is no lasting<br />
damage that has been done by that episode at all. Their<br />
relationships are close. So I think in any way you look at<br />
it, given the perceptions of all the major parties, Sihanouk<br />
will continue to have a central role. There still seems to<br />
be some possibility that he will be attending the JIM Two<br />
meeting. JOURNALIST: The Treasurer Mr Keating has said that Australia<br />
can be a spring board into Asia and now he's raised the idea<br />
of a regional OECD, yet Australian investment in a number of<br />
countries in Asia is actually quite slight. I wonder, do you<br />
think Australia can justifiably claim to be a member of the<br />
regional economy?<br />
PM: Yes indeed we can, simply by looking at the statistics<br />
because the greater proportion of our trade and economic<br />
relationships and a substantial proportion of our total<br />
overseas investment is in the region by any statistical test<br />
you apply, whether it's trade or investment, we are part of<br />
the region. Now my concern which I've been expressing since<br />
I ve become Prime Minister is that we've got to do more, and<br />
the phrase I've used is to become enmeshed in the region, and </p>
<p>what we have done in the period since 1983 is very very<br />
significant. The degree of enmeshment is remarkably greater<br />
than it was. it has been a varigated performance when you<br />
look at it country by country and here in Thailand I have<br />
expressed a view, and I take this opportunity of saying it<br />
again, that I don't think the Australian business community<br />
has been quite as aggressive in an acceptable sense of that<br />
word and thrusting in taking advantage of possible<br />
opportunities here as it may have been. I think therefore<br />
that the agreement that I've reached with the Prime Minister<br />
here to set a doubling of the two-w.. ay trade between us within<br />
the next three years is achievable. It may appear ambitious<br />
but to lift it from the A$ 630 million to 1.3 by the end of<br />
1991 seems to me achievable. Certainly if you look at the<br />
particular projects which are available for Australian<br />
participation I don't think there's any reason wny we won't<br />
achieve that objective. importantly, the actual agreements<br />
that we have arrived at here to process an overall economic<br />
co-operation agreement, the concessional financing agreement,<br />
to go on with the double tax agreement negotiations, I think<br />
that in regard to Thailand it means that now as a result of<br />
my visit and the very productive discussions I've had with<br />
the Prime Minister that we will undoubtedly see a boost to<br />
involvement here and that will not only be in trade but in<br />
two-way investment. Australia has got to really complete the<br />
process from the rhetoric to the fact and the change of<br />
attitude. As I've said, for too long and under previous<br />
governments the phrase was there we're part of Asia, but the<br />
tough hard attitudinal change wasn't there. It is coming now<br />
and I'm as certain as I am of anything that the process of<br />
the enmeshment of the Australian economy with Asia is going<br />
to gather momentum because that is something which is<br />
manifestly in our interests in Australia and without<br />
overstating our capacities it is something which is certainly<br />
in Lhe interests of Asia.<br />
JOURNALIST: There was a report yesterday from Associated<br />
Piess in Chiang Mai that they're expecting a record bumper<br />
crop of heroin out of the golden triangle this year. Is that<br />
a concern to you and will you be talking to the Thai<br />
authorities about how to ensure that that crop doesnt get<br />
through PM: It is a matter of concern. We have talked about these<br />
issues. I've given my assurance to the Prime Minister and to<br />
his ministers that Australia's involvement with the Office of<br />
the Narcotic Control Board here in Bangkok will be carried<br />
on. [ t is a very effective concrete way in which we have been<br />
able to assist in their program of creating a more efficient<br />
policing body. There is no question but that we will<br />
continue our assistance in that form and also the<br />
co-operation between our police forces. So we have that<br />
commitment, we've got the runs on the board in terms of<br />
actual co-operation, both in terms of financial assistance<br />
and in terms of inter-operability of our police torces. All<br />
those things will continue. I must say I will be interested<br />
to see when I go up there the, operation of His Majesty's </p>
<p>concept and program of trying to develop alternative crops<br />
and avenues of economic activity for the people involved in<br />
the production of these crops. That's another aspect of the<br />
approach that can be adopted.<br />
JOURNALIST: Could you discuss Australia's assistance to the<br />
project of building the Thai-Laos bridge that you discusssed<br />
with Prime Minister Chatichai yesterday.<br />
PM: The Prime Minister expressed the view that it would be<br />
good if Australia would pick up this project. It was one of<br />
those areas of meetings betwoen Prime Ministers where the<br />
other Prime Minister, that is me, I also thought it would be<br />
good. So we agreed. Now the suggestion is that it would<br />
cost about S27 million that's in US terms without a rai. l<br />
and perhaps $ 31 million with the rail. We've accepted that<br />
W. e will undertake the responsibility, the design and the<br />
construction of the bridge. It's understood that there will<br />
need to be further detailed analyses done of what it<br />
involves. Obviously we need the agreement of Laos as well<br />
1 can't imagine that that will not be forthcoming. We'll<br />
undertake that work and then on the understanding that the<br />
outcome of those studies will validate the order of, not<br />
necessarily absolutely precisely, but the order of costings<br />
that have been put to us, then we'll go ahead with it. It'!;<br />
suggested that it's something that will be done over a flive<br />
year period. As I've said, this is something that will be<br />
intrinsically desirable in helping to increase communication<br />
and trade between two countries that historically have had<br />
such a relationship that's been characterised by conflict.<br />
So it will be important intr-insically, and as I've said, I<br />
think symbolically it's also important in being part of<br />
transforming a zone of war into a zone of peace. It's<br />
something that I'm very pleased that we in Australia are able<br />
to be associated with.<br />
JOURNALIST: ' What is the state of your Government's relations<br />
now with the regime in Burma arid how do you see them<br />
* deve loping?<br />
PM: I would think it's most correctly put by saving that We<br />
have maintained a presence there which seeks to be informed<br />
to protect Australian interests and interests of others who<br />
will be associated with us. We don't see ourselves as a<br />
major player in the events of Burma although it is the case<br />
that we have a fairly significant program of aid and<br />
assistance to Burma. We'ye made it clear that we want to see<br />
a situation in which human rights are respected and in which<br />
there is an opportunity for free and fair election in which<br />
the will of the people of Burma can be reflected. That's the<br />
stance that we adopt while we accept we are not a major<br />
player in the events there.<br />
JOUJRNALIST: In your speech last night you reaffirmed<br />
Australia's stance on immigration policy. In your talks in<br />
recent days has the question of the debate in AuIstralia over<br />
Asian immigration arisen and have you been able to gzauge<br />
whether there s been any longer term damage between our<br />
relations as a result of that debate? </p>
<p>it<br />
PM: The matter has arisen but as you would expect, given the<br />
politeness of our hosts it's not an issue that they pursue.<br />
But in the discussions that have come out it's clear that<br />
they welcome the unequivocal statements that I make on behalf<br />
of the Australian Government about our commitment to<br />
non-discriminatory policies. Just anecdotely may I say that<br />
one of my staff before I came here was travelling out in the<br />
country in Thailand here and was told in respect of certain<br />
Thai students that they had been going to come and I think<br />
there were tour of them were going to be coming to<br />
Australia. They'd heard about this debate and it changed<br />
their decision to go to Australia and instead have gone to<br />
North America. So any suggestion that there hasn't been some<br />
understanding fairly generally through the region about. the<br />
debate in Australia is simply not the case. The knowledge is<br />
there and part of what I'm about, why I'm here, and I've said<br />
also in Korea, is to reiterate the position and that is that<br />
the past practice of the ' 70s and the ' 80s of<br />
non-discrimination, that practice is irreversible. The White<br />
Australia policy will, as I've put it, stay where it belongs<br />
in the history books.<br />
JOURNALIST: You spoke before about Australian investment in<br />
Thailand. There's been two big attempts by Australian<br />
companies recently to get into Thailand, both have failed<br />
rather dismally in controversial circumstances. Did you take<br />
this up with the Thai Government?<br />
PM: We did not go to the details of the failed bids but in<br />
the major area of telecommunications, ministers went out of<br />
their way to say that there were very very extensive<br />
investment programs and expansion programs on the drawing<br />
board and that they look forward to successful Australian<br />
bidding in those areas. So I would have to say that from our<br />
point of view despite the unfortunate fact that we were<br />
unsuccessful in the past it does seem absolutely to be the<br />
case that our position in regard to the future is not only<br />
not prejudiced but that the Thai authorities are looking<br />
forward anxiously to Australian participation in the bidding<br />
for these further contracts. There is some anticipation I<br />
think that we've got a good chance of being successful.<br />
JOURNALIST: Just one quick domestic one. What are your<br />
feelings about the West Australian election and have you<br />
spoken to Premier Dowding in the last couple of days?<br />
PM: It will come as no surprise to you in answer to the<br />
first part of your question as what my feelings are. I have<br />
a great hope that Dowding will win because that's not only in<br />
the intersts of the Party in the state and federally, but<br />
more imporantly it's' overwhelmingly in the interests of the<br />
West Australian people. My second feeling is that it will be<br />
desperately close. Thirdly, have I spoken to him in the last<br />
couple of days, no. I am here in the region advancing the<br />
causes of Australia and of the region and that's fully taking<br />
up my time. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: At the banquet last night you said that<br />
Australia is ready to play a part in any restoration of peace<br />
in Cambodia. 1 understand that you partly answered the<br />
question but I would be interested in what role that would<br />
involve. Would Australia consider staffing the international<br />
control mechanism of funding and in what way<br />
PM: I really have answered that question. You can't be<br />
specific about what role you'll play until the parties<br />
themselves have agreed on what the role of the mechanism is.<br />
' heyve got to use the ,. ord mechanism now as a generic<br />
because that is reflective of the fact that there's still a<br />
lot of discussion and argument as to what the role will be.<br />
So I can't say what our role will be in something the role of<br />
wihich itself generally hasn't been determined. The important<br />
point is that we are prepared to do reasonably anything that<br />
the parties would want us to do together with others I mean<br />
Australia is not assuming sole responsibility in these<br />
matters but to do what would sensibly be requested of us.<br />
* Now that could include specialist staff who had experience or<br />
the capacity to involve the monitoring of elections and we<br />
have a lot of elections in Australia, too many, you can see<br />
that people are preoccupied with them so I don't see that<br />
we'd have any trouble in providing people who would be very<br />
competent in supervising elections. I could send along a few<br />
sharp scrutineers I can tell you. So we could do that. The<br />
processes of monitoring the withdrawal, ensuring that the<br />
withdrawal of the Vietnamese forces was undertaken, this is<br />
something which again we would have a capacity with others to<br />
do. obviously in providing these forms of personnel it<br />
requires finance. We understand that if we're going to be<br />
part of this exercise it will involve a financial outlay as<br />
far as we are concerned. But we've had a long standing<br />
involvement and commitment to try and torsee a peaceful<br />
outcome of this tragedy. Now that we are accelerating<br />
toaether towards the possibility of that resolution we're not<br />
going to be parsimonious from our point of view if we're<br />
* asked in ensuring that we make an effective contribution.<br />
