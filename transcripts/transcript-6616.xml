PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 12 April 1985<br />
JOINT STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER AND PREMIER OF WESTERN AUSTRALIA<br />
Forrest Place, in the heart of Perth, is to be enlarged and<br />
redeveloped at a cost of $ 5 million in time for the 1988<br />
Bicentennial, the Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, and the Premier, '. r<br />
Burke, announced today.<br />
The project will be jointly funded under the Commonwealth/ State<br />
Bicentenn" ial Commemorative Program, which aims to provide lasting<br />
memorials to the 200th anniversary in all States and Territories.<br />
The Federal Government has allocated $ 48 million to the<br />
Commemorative Program, of which Western Australia will receive<br />
million, to be matched from its own resources.<br />
Other Western Australia commemorative projects which will receive<br />
Federal funding include:<br />
establishment of a Ningaloo Marine Park and tourist<br />
facilities, $ 1 million;<br />
restoration of Fremantle's Arthur Head precinct, incllding<br />
the-Round House, $ 1.5 million;<br />
development of a network of heritage trails throughout the<br />
state, $ 1 million.<br />
The two governments have also agreed to provide substantial<br />
funding for an Aboriginal Commemorative project and a s * ail<br />
training vessel for young people. Details of these projects are<br />
at present being finalised by the Western Austialian Government.<br />
Mr Hawke said the Commonwealth Government had allc'ated nearly<br />
$ 200 million for a wide ranging national program of projects and<br />
events to mark the 1988 bicentenary.<br />
" Our aim, which is reflected in the diverse range of projects to<br />
be carried out in Western Australia, is to provide something that<br />
will appeal to everyone. </p>
<p>2<br />
" The Nitional. Program has been initiated and is now being<br />
implemented by tY-e A~ istralian Bicentennial Authority. They are to<br />
be congratulated for their success in putting a Program of such<br />
breadth and complexity together.<br />
" We want 1988 to be a peoples Bicentenary, to be shared and<br />
enjoyed by every Australian. Just as these projects illustrate<br />
our Bicentennial theme ' Living Together' by providing another<br />
example of Commonwealth/ State co-operation, so too will our<br />
Bicentennial celebrations throughout the year provide the<br />
opportunity for all Australians to get together and ensure a<br />
memorable year for all."<br />
Mr Burke said the financial commitment of the Commonwealth and<br />
State Governments to the Bicentennial Commemorative Program would<br />
give the State projects lasting value.<br />
" Each of them will enhance our heritage in some way", Mr Burke<br />
said. " T ie Forrest Place redevelopment will provide Perth with a true<br />
city square, highlight the grace of the old General Post Office<br />
and Commonwealth Bank and link the central business district with<br />
the exciting cultural centre development.<br />
ilAt Fremantlc, the Arthur Head project will protect the State's<br />
oldest building and make the historical precinct more attractive<br />
and accessible.<br />
The Wingaloo marine park-coritains some of the State's most<br />
outstanding scenic treasures and as a Bicentennial Commemorative<br />
Project will also be protected and made more accessible.<br />
" The development of heritage trails will enable Western<br />
Australians to better enjoy some of the state's mo~ st appealing<br />
environments. " The sail training project will not onl y impart new skills to<br />
young Western Australians, but also assist in the development of<br />
leadership qualities for the future.<br />
" The Aboriginal project will be a proper recognition that the<br />
human occupation of Australia pre-dates white settlement by<br />
thousands of years.<br />
" The State Government is delighted to be associated with all of<br />
these worthy projects", Mr Burke said. </p>
