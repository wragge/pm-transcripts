FOR PRESS: P. M. No. 3/ 1969<br />
OVERSEAS TAKEOVERS CF AUSTRALIAN COMPANIES<br />
joint Statement by the Prime Minister and the Treasurer<br />
In a discussion we had with Mr. C. T. Looker, President<br />
of the Australian Associated Stock Exchanges, on 5 December last, we<br />
informed him of the view held by the Government that the shareholders<br />
of an Australian company should have a right to amend its Articles of<br />
Association for the purpose of ensuring that control of the company,<br />
exercised through the voting powers of the shareholders, remains in<br />
Australian hands. In effect, we considered that the directors and<br />
shareholders of Australian companies should be placed in a position from<br />
which they could, if necessary, protect the company from outside<br />
manoeuvres in the market or elsewhere to gain control of the company.<br />
Mr. Looker undertook to discuss with members of the<br />
Associated Stock Exchanges the question of amiending the provisions of<br />
the present listing requirements of the Australian Stock Exchanges under<br />
which a company is not admitted to the Stock Exchange unless the Company' s<br />
Articles provide for equal voting rights for all shareholders of one class.<br />
Mr. Looker has now informed us of the outcome of the<br />
discussions between himself and his colleagues.<br />
They have put to us strongly their view that the most<br />
satisfactory form of protection for Australian companies against various<br />
undesirable types of take-over operations is to be sought by amending<br />
in certain respects those sections of the uniform Companies Acts which<br />
relate to the take-over codes. At the invitation of the Attorney -Genera I<br />
they will themselves makle detailed submissions on this matter to the<br />
Eggleston Committee which will advise the Standing Committee of<br />
Commonwealth and State Attorneys General.<br />
The Stock Exchanges will accede to the Government's<br />
request for the revision of the listing requirements to permit the quotation<br />
of shares of the one class having different voting rights. They would have<br />
preferred the postponement of this action until decisions had been taken on<br />
amendments of the uniform Companies Act but they appreciated that it. could<br />
take considerable time to make the necessary legislative changes in<br />
Commonwealth and State laws.<br />
In agreeing to this revision the Exchanges emphasised that<br />
such action must not impair the free transferability of shares. The question<br />
of who owns shares as distinct from the exercises of voting rights is not<br />
involved. They also feel that the revised listing requirements should<br />
ensure that an alteration to a Company's Articles to permit of qualified<br />
voting rights should be subject to approval being given by a simple majority<br />
in value of the shareholders of the company. The present approval of<br />
per cent of the shareholders present and voting at a meeting does not,<br />
in their view, necessarily represent a majority decision of all shareholders.<br />
The Stock Exchanges will be making a submission along these lines to the<br />
Eggleston Committee. The Government appreciates the approach of the Australian<br />
Associated Stock Exchanges to a problem which it feels is both urgent and<br />
important.<br />
