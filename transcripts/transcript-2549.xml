FOR PRESS: P. J' 11. No. 29/ 1972<br />
VISIT OF MR. MARSHALL GREEN<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister, the Rt. Hon William McMahon, CH, MP<br />
The visit to Australia by Mr. Marshall Green has<br />
provided the opportunity to discuss in a very full and frank way<br />
the results of President Nixon's visit to the People' Republic of<br />
China. Mr. Green emphasised that United States policy in<br />
Asia remained the same today as it had been prior to thie President's<br />
visit, and that United States support for its treaty allies in the<br />
region remained as firm as previously.<br />
No secret commitments had been enteredl into in Peking<br />
and there were no negotiations which compromised the basic<br />
interests of United States allies in the Pacific.<br />
The Australian Government welcomos these assurances.<br />
After hearing Dt. Marshall Green, there could be no<br />
doubt that the President's visit has opened up new prospects<br />
for a just and secure peace in our region.<br />
CANBERRA, March, 1972. </p>
