AUSTHALIA<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
EXTRACT FROM SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER TO THE AUSTRALIAN<br />
LABOR PARTY STATE COUNCIL, SYDNEY, 1 MAY 1983<br />
Let me just say something briefly about what we have done in<br />
the very short time that we've been in office. And then<br />
I want to contrast that with the alternative which has been<br />
offered to the people of Australia, something which has<br />
been starkly highlighted by the events of this past week.<br />
Now, its often been said we didn't go into the election of<br />
the 5th of March with some hastily concocted program or<br />
philosophy or view of the nature of-the crisis confronting<br />
this country and what had to be done about it. We had<br />
carefully thought through and had clearly perceived the<br />
essential nature of the problem confronting this country.<br />
It wasn't to be understood just in terms of inadequate<br />
economic theories that had been applied the past seven years.<br />
Nor was it to be perceived simply in terms of the inadequacy<br />
of a Prime Minister and the people around him. Essentially<br />
it had to be seen in terms of a country, of magnificent resources,<br />
having been more divided with a greater degreee of confrontation<br />
imposed upon it than at any time in its history. And we knew<br />
that it was impossible for this country to start the task<br />
of reconciliation, of recovery and reconstruction unless<br />
the people would start to be brought together under a<br />
Government which saw that the need was for the people to have<br />
a common perception of their problems and on the basis of<br />
that common perception to start to act together.<br />
We understood that you could call upon the vast reserves of<br />
decency within the Australian people and within its organisations;<br />
a compassion for those in this community in need and none more<br />
obviously in need than the vast and growing army of unemployed.<br />
And so it was with that message, it was with that understanding,<br />
that we went to the people and-the people of Australia responded<br />
to our understanding. And we didn't wait one single day after<br />
we were cowumissioned in office to start to give effect to our<br />
understanding which had been responded to by the Australian<br />
people. For as I promired during the campaign the first thing<br />
we would do on the first day of government was to issue the<br />
invitations to the National Economic Summnit Conference. And this<br />
I did on the first day. I signed the letters to all people who<br />
were coing to come to that great conference. We didn't simply<br />
sit idly by and wait for them to turn up on the llth of April but<br />
a great deal of work went into the preparation of that Summit<br />
and I pay tribute to the trade union movement, the great employer<br />
organisations and individual employers, to other groups, including<br />
ACOSS, the Local Government Association of Australia, the federal<br />
associations and also, may I say, particularly those often<br />
maligned people, the public servants and bureaucrats who responded<br />

' And ; s a hasis of proper ( decision -, ak-ing th-it we were cioing t%-o<br />
tear the veil away from the secrecy which consistently had bec-n<br />
held tic'htlv over the sources of guarded, information under the<br />
seven years of conservative government. And we made available<br />
in advance of the Summit, to all the people that were going to<br />
be there, and then to the media, whati had hitherto been regarded<br />
as the ccnfidential preserve of government. Now that's rno way<br />
to run a government and to cet a cohesiv e society together.<br />
So we mnade thc informati. on available in it way which has<br />

we b-elieve th'-at wec have no monopoly of w:; i~. we certainly<br />
hav7e rio menono lv of experience to b1. ring to bear upon the preblems<br />
of our country. I. We beli-eve we are well equipped to deal with<br />
them but we certainly believe that if we are going to get the<br />
best out of the trade union movement out of the employers<br />
and out of the welfare organisations and out of the representatives<br />
o' the thir-d tier of goverinmc-nt local gove-_ rnm-, ent of the professional<br />
associations: if' wo areC goanI! to acgt th--lbest out of them and<br />

novrernnment. A. nd as we continue to give effect to that so will<br />
hequality of joeeetand the quality of our society improve.<br />
All,-So the S unait wnheld6 on the basis of that historically<br />
! iriprecedenteci dissem-ination of releva-: nt information. </p>
<p>On Thursday in Sydney, ini the second week after the Surmmit,<br />
we hold a meeting with Paul Keat ing and Chris Hurford and<br />
Jo Dawkins in rces:; ct of the housing industry. Because what<br />
had emerged at the Sumniit was that there was a large degree<br />
of consensus amongst the employers, the building and<br />
construction employers, amongst the trade unions, amongst<br />
the various areas of government that one particular segment<br />
that we could move on to get the economy moving, tp lift the<br />
level of activity, to start to create more jobs within the<br />
housing industry. So that meeting was held last Thursday<br />
and on the basis of that and on the reports that have been<br />
given to me I know that in this coming period of time, in the<br />
third week I think of May, when we bring down our economic<br />
statement, there will as a result of what occurred at the<br />
Summit be presented to the Parliament a specific program<br />
of action around housing which will be directed towards what<br />
we w.-nt, that is lifting activity and providing more jobs.<br />
Now what have the events of this past week shown in terms of<br />
the alternative which is available to us, the alternative which<br />
is offered by the Liberal Party under Andrew Peacock. We have<br />
just been through the events of the Constitutional Convention<br />
in Adelaide. I h. ad some cause to talk about this on Friday<br />
night to your colleagues . at the creat cathering we had of the<br />
Labor Party in Victoria to celebrate the events of the 5th of<br />
March. I said what the events of this last week have shown was how<br />
tragically inadequate is that alternative which is now shaping<br />
up under the le. ader., hip of Mr Peacock. Because there in Adelaide<br />
you had this Constitutional Convention which had what task? It<br />
had the task of sa'yin' what are we as a community going to do<br />
in terms of providin,; the people of Australia today and the<br />
future citizens of Australia tomorrow what are we going to do </p>
<p>about : providirn : them with a cons ticutional instrument which<br />
will be relevant to their needs as they go towards the end<br />
of the twentiet; century and try and put themselves in<br />
the proper position to launch in to the twenty-first century.<br />
We were concerned with the future and your Labor Party, through<br />
yourLabor governments representing the overwhelming majority<br />
ofthe people of Australia, we played it according to the rules.<br />
We went there with the capacity, if we'd wanted to, to load<br />
the delegations of the federal government and of the governmentsof<br />
New South Wales, Victoria, Sbuth Australia and Western<br />
Australia, but we didn't, we played the rules. And so the<br />
composition of the national delegation and of the delegations<br />
in those four states were even numbers of government and<br />
of opposition. We didn't use the power that was available to<br />
us, if we'd wanted to, to break the rules and to break the<br />
conventions. But what did those two remaining bastions<br />
of conservatism, Queensland and Tasmania do? They broke<br />
the rules. They couldn't look to the future, they are<br />
obsessed with preserving the past. And so the delegation<br />
from Queensland was nine out of twelve from government.<br />
And our colleagues from Queensland, I guess understandably<br />
too, they weren't going to be part of that charade. And so<br />
the Queensland delegation was nine. Tasmania did the same<br />
thing not an even number that we, the government, the<br />
Labor Party, no. And so because we'd played the rules, we<br />
played it fair, square, dinkum because we'd done it and<br />
we've got the national government and four out of the six<br />
state governments we were in a minority because they'd<br />
loaded the numbers against us.<br />
Now Andrew Peacock had the opportunity after the people<br />
of Australia had spoken and spoken so clearly on the<br />
of March that they wanted political parties concerned with<br />
the problems of the present in terms of the hopes of the<br />
future he had the great opportunity in this last week<br />
in Adelaide, to face up to that challenge and meet the desires<br />
and aspirations of the Australian people. What did he do<br />
and what did those around him do? They desparately sought<br />
refuge in the past. And as I said on Friday night<br />
in Melbourne speaking to your Melbourne colleagues, we<br />
saw the emergence of the new raj, in Australian politics,<br />
Robin, Andrew and Joh.<br />
There he is, not merely squeezed in between Robin Gray<br />
and Joi. Bjelke-Peterson, but eagerly taking over from<br />
Joh Bjelke-Peterson, the most reactionary motions and<br />
reactionary philosophy. ie even goes to the extent of<br />
turning back on what they were saying in the campaign<br />
just a few weeks ago about the need for contemporaneous elections<br />
of the Senate and the House of Representatives. They know thats<br />
not now on. Hle took over Joh Bjelke-Peterson's motion. Now<br />
here were we trying to decide responsibly let's concern<br />
ourselves with the present.<br />
Cc I r ill I -L ' I r rl d </p>
<p>LOL'I sec0 how Lhis ins lrumc;~ w da-whnc, up contury ago<br />
amongst six reluctant colonies -let's see without being unduly<br />
radical let's see how we car impro--ve that instrument to deal<br />
with the present and the foreseeable future problems of<br />
Australia. But we were frustrated because what we wanted to do<br />
was frustrated on party lines where we clearly had the political<br />
majority but because we played the rules-( inaudible) and these<br />
people, as I've said, wanted to preserve the privileges and the<br />
relics of the past for the benefit of a mninority of people in<br />
this country against the interests of the vast majority. They<br />
ganged up 1having broken all the conventions again, reviving and<br />
demonstrating to the people of Australia that what happened<br />
in 1975 was no accident. The people of Australia should be<br />
very very careful that if they don't want to bring back the<br />
basic divisiveness of 1975 they must learn because in Adelaide<br />
this week the conservatives of Australia, now under the new raj,<br />
with Andrew Peacock there between Robin and Joh have shown<br />
that constitutional conventions and decency and fair play mean<br />
nothing to them. What they did in November 1975 they repeated<br />
again in Adelaide this last week. And those are the true<br />
alternatives that have now been starkly revealed by the politics<br />
of 1983.<br />
A party, the Labor Party, which has said we don't have all<br />
wisdom, a party which has gone out to the people of Australia<br />
and said we want to join with you so that we can deal with the<br />
present and w.. ith the future and we're doing it constructively<br />
and co-operatively. Against that you have now the conservatives<br />
of this country now led by Pea-. ck are like preservers of the<br />
past. They learn nothing, they forget nothing. And this<br />
party is a party of conservatism who strut around and talk about<br />
the necessity to adhere to the principles of law and order<br />
and of the decencies and conventions of our society. When<br />
the opportunities arose trampled them underfoot and have<br />
prevented the people of Aus'ralia having the opportunities<br />
th,' ey should have had in this past week Eo address themselves<br />
constructively and co-operatively to those problems. </p>
