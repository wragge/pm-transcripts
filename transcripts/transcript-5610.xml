PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA WEDNESDAY, 24 JUNE, 1981<br />
ADDRESS AT MEXICO BANQUET, MEXICO CITY<br />
I thank you for your gracious welcome and I am delighted to..,<br />
be visiting Mexico as Prime Minister of Australia.<br />
More and more Australians are becoming aware of Mexico's<br />
vibrant culture and dynamic growth. We know Mexico as a<br />
significant country, characterised by independence of mind<br />
and'-a determination to exercise its own judgment.<br />
You are a non-aligned country, but you do not belong to the<br />
non-aligned movement. You are one of the world's major oil<br />
producers, but you do not belong to O. P. E. C. In a world of<br />
bloc politics, Mexico treasures its individuality and in doing<br />
so gives an example to the world.<br />
Over the years, Australia and Mexico have each had their<br />
own preoccupations. We have each bent our energies to the<br />
building of our own nations and to our traditional.<br />
relationships, to the regions of predominant and immediate<br />
concern to us. On opposite sides of the world's largest<br />
ocean, we have seemedia long way apart. But now there is a<br />
change. With the many new and emerging Pacific states, and<br />
with growing opportunities and markets, a sense of identity<br />
and community is arising. All this, and more, points towards<br />
greater co-operation, and stronger links among countries in<br />
and around the Pacific.<br />
The Pacific connection alone would be reason enough for our<br />
two countries to take steps now to make up for lost time.<br />
But there are also other factors drawing us together at<br />
this time. Australia and Mexico have been working towards artL<br />
agreement on science and technology, and I hope this will be<br />
a concrete step in developing our relationship. Both our<br />
countries are rich in energy; you in oil, we in coal, uranium<br />
and natural gas. So we both enjoy the privileges and share<br />
the responsibilities which come with a relative abundance of<br />
energy resource You are rightly determined that Mexico shall<br />
not be, or seem to be, merely an oil exporter. The importance<br />
of energy as a world issue cannot be over-emphasised, and your<br />
initiative for a world energy plan is a step towards concrete!<br />
progress in this area. </p>
<p>-2<br />
Australia and Mexico are also both middle-ranking countries,<br />
and we both take moderate and independent views. I believe<br />
there is a role for us to play on issues of peace and stability<br />
and more especially on issues of development and progress.<br />
It would be wrong for us to keep silent, to say nothing, when<br />
a contribution we may be able to make may help clarify issues<br />
or strengthen resolve and when every incremental gain is valuable.<br />
We have a responsibility to our own peoples for their security<br />
and well-being, and an obligation to our children for the<br />
future. It is not enough to leave that responsibility and<br />
obligation to the great powers alone. We must exercise our<br />
own minds and judgments. We are indeed able to give support. to<br />
views and approaches we believe to be right, and such action caln'<br />
accord with an enlightened view of our interests. Countries<br />
such as Mexico and Australia can speak to great powers without<br />
being overwhelmed and to smaller states with genuine understanding<br />
of their position. Initiatives that may be taken by countries<br />
such As ours are less likely to introduce competition, less likely<br />
to arouse suspicion and misunderstanding, than are those of<br />
great powers. So while we must not exaggerate our contribution<br />
we must be willing to do what it is within our power to do.<br />
Our two countries have accepted responsibilities in relation to<br />
issues of world poverty and development, and the problems here<br />
are among the most pressing which face mankind. Later this year<br />
you will be hosting a Summit Meeting of developing and developed<br />
countries at Cancun. This will be an important meeting and I<br />
congratulate you for your initiative and determination in making<br />
sure that it will happen. Shortly before that meeting, Australia<br />
will be hosting a meeting of the Heads of Commonwealth countries<br />
in Melbourne. That meeting, like yours, will discuss issues<br />
affecting relations bettween developed and developing countries.<br />
I suppose, Mr. President, that you are sometimes asked, as I am,<br />
what is the point, what is the purpose of Heads of Government<br />
Meetings? I am sure you would agree that the very fact that Heads<br />
of Government meet is of value. For it is through such meetings<br />
that they can establish a relationship, an understanding of how<br />
others will react, of what may be done together, of how consensus<br />
may be established on priorities, and how conflict may best be<br />
avoided.<br />
If the meetings in Mexico and Australia later this year can achieve<br />
these results, their worth will already be established.<br />
May I suggest that these meetings, which will<br />
together be attended by some 55 Heads of Government representing<br />
two thirds of the world's population, may achieve somewhat more<br />
than that.<br />
If these meetings can achieve agreement that there is a real<br />
problem of massive proportion that we need to do something about;<br />
if these meetings can instil a life, a vigour, a purpose into<br />
what is called the North-South dialogue; if they can produce agreement<br />
that the issue is urgent and real, not only from every humanitarian<br />
and moral standpoint, but also from enlightened self-interest; and<br />
if a commitment towards doing something can result, then both<br />
meetings will have more than repaid the efforts put into them.<br />

<p>4 I -3<br />
I sometimes wonder whether nations address North-South issues<br />
with sufficient energy, whether there is not a feeling that<br />
the problem of poverty is not new and that whatever we do will<br />
be insignificant. But if we can all recognise that there is<br />
a massive problem which compels our attention, a problem which<br />
affects how hundreds of millions of people live or die, then<br />
surely we will ask ourselves," what can we do, individually and<br />
collectively?" Some things can be done by national Governments, but there is<br />
also need for efforts from the whole international community.<br />
Countries who ask what they can do will find much that they<br />
can do to help other nations. For example, both our countries<br />
are pastoral and agricultural, and both have tropical<br />
and desert areas. Much of the knowledge and experience we have<br />
could benefit others, if we can find ways to transfer it.<br />
We have a capacity to develop that knowledge through research,<br />
to point to practical things that can be done, to improve<br />
peoplep's standards of living. I hope that the agreement between<br />
our countries on science and technology, which I have already<br />
referred to, may play some part in that.<br />
My visit is a very short one. But even a fleeting visit is<br />
bound to leave a strong impression of Mexico's vitality and<br />
maturity. I hope that more Australians will come here and<br />
stay longer. That will be a good thing because there is no<br />
substitute for direct contact between people. I hope that all<br />
the travel will not be one way. In particular, I hope that you<br />
will find it possible to pay a visit in the not too distant<br />
future. I cordially invite you to do so. When you come, I<br />
hope that your impressions will be as favourable and warm as<br />
those with which I shall leave your country.<br />
Your Excellency, ladies and gentlemen, I ask you to join<br />
me in a toast to the President and people of Mexico.<br />
