FOR PRESS: P. M. No. 28/ 1966<br />
DEAT! 11 OF SIR DALLAS BROOKS<br />
Tribute by the Prime Minister, Mr. Harold Holt<br />
I am deeply saddened to learn of the passing<br />
of Sir Dallas Brooks, He was one of the most popular and most able<br />
Governors to serve in Australia and endaeared himself to<br />
the people of Victoria during what became a record period of<br />
office. Indeed, he could be said to have established<br />
a new concept of his office carin his activities through<br />
all sections of the community an maing all feel his friend.<br />
The Commonwealth has special cause for<br />
appreciation of Sir Dallas' public service. He on fo ur<br />
occasions served with distinction as Administrator of the<br />
Commonwvealth. In all he did he was most effectively assisted<br />
by his gracious and charming wife, Lady Brooks who firmly<br />
established her own high place in the affection of the people<br />
of Victoria. Sir Dallas was a man of broad views and wide<br />
interests. He was stirred by his vision of Australia's<br />
future greatness and when he finally retired, he made Australia<br />
his permanent home. Mrs. Holt and I have lost a very dear friend<br />
and we offer our profound sympathy to Lady Brooks and her<br />
family. CANBERRA, 22nd March, 1966. </p>
