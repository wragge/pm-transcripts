    <content><![CDATA[<p>E&amp;OE...............................................................................................................................</p>
<p>Well thank you very much Mr Morgan, to Mr Peter</p>
<p>   Sturrock, to my parliamentary colleagues, Ambassadors, High Commissioners,</p>
<p>   ladies and gentlemen. I'm delighted to address the Chamber</p>
<p>   not for the first time, but certainly for the first time as Prime</p>
<p>   Minister. And I do so against the backdrop of what has been a quite</p>
<p>   remarkable year for your industry. And I want to offer some congratulations.</p>
<p>   I first of all want to congratulate the industry in all its facets</p>
<p>   for a particularly successful year. To have reached record levels</p>
<p>   of sales of units in 1997 of some 723,000 is no mean achievement,</p>
<p>   and warm congratulations are due to all of you, not only to your</p>
<p>   companies but also to your employees because those kinds of results,</p>
<p>   including the profit results which were alluded to by Mr Morgan</p>
<p>   of course cannot be achieved by companies and their executives alone,</p>
<p>   but also involve the very considerable efforts of the men and women</p>
<p>   who are employed by the various companies that make up the industry.</p>
<p>It's not only been a remarkable year for your</p>
<p>   industry because of the number of motor vehicles that have been</p>
<p>   sold in Australia and the success of the other parts of the industry,</p>
<p>   it's also been a remarkable year because there has been a great</p>
<p>   deal of policy activity which is not only directly borne on your</p>
<p>   industry in relation to the decisions the Government took last year,</p>
<p>   but also more generally the industry policy that the government</p>
<p>   has laid down principally through the Investing for Growth</p>
<p>   statement that I delivered on behalf of the Government in December</p>
<p>   last year.</p>
<p>In this context I want to express my own personal</p>
<p>   thanks to John Moore, my Industry Minister, the person who interfaces</p>
<p>   most with your industry, and also Tim Fischer the Trade Minister,</p>
<p>   who also plays a very important role in relations between your industry</p>
<p>   and my government. We saw in 1997 exports grow in your industry</p>
<p>   to $2.65 billion. We saw largely, but not only as a consequence</p>
<p>   of the decisions taken by the government, we saw major investment</p>
<p>   announcements made by a number of the major companies which operate</p>
<p>   here in Australia. Those investment announcements, and the jobs</p>
<p>   that will flow from those investment announcements, are an important</p>
<p>   element of building confidence in Australian manufacturing industry.</p>
<p>   And they are also a direct dividend of the decisions that were taken</p>
<p>   by my Government and announced in June of last year.</p>
<p>I share Mr Morgan's remarks regarding the</p>
<p>   cooperative process that occurred before those decisions were announced.</p>
<p>   Making decisions about the long-term environment in which such a</p>
<p>   basic industry as motor manufacturing will operate, making those</p>
<p>   decisions are very important moments in the economic and industry</p>
<p>   life of any government. If the decisions are wrong, if the wrong</p>
<p>   settings are put down and the wrong signals given, then the consequences</p>
<p>   can be felt for years into the future. </p>
<p>That particular industry decision generated an</p>
<p>   enormous amount of debate within the Australian community. There</p>
<p>   was no shortage at the time of simplistic solutions that were urged</p>
<p>   upon the Government by those who wanted one or other outcome. In</p>
<p>   the end we took a decision which I believe reflected both economic</p>
<p>   and industrial realism. I said before the decision was taken that</p>
<p>   I could not imagine Australia without a motor manufacturing industry</p>
<p>   into the foreseeable future. But the idea that we wouldn't</p>
<p>   take decisions that would give a sense of basic stability and security</p>
<p>   and confidence to the industry was unthinkable. Equally, we did</p>
<p>   have APEC obligations and world trade obligations more generally</p>
<p>   speaking. And I believe that the decision that was taken in relation</p>
<p>   to the tariff pause between the year 2000 and 2005 on the understanding</p>
<p>   that there would be a further move down in tariffs in the year 2005</p>
<p>   reflected precisely the right balance which it was the responsibility</p>
<p>   of the Government to find.</p>
<p>And I believe the other aspects of the decision</p>
<p>   which Mr Morgan referred to and the very positive response that</p>
<p>   it received from all sectors of the industry is evidence of the</p>
<p>   balance that was involved in it. And I believe that we have provided</p>
<p>   a stable, predictable and secure investment framework and climate</p>
<p>   for the industry. And we look forward in the years ahead to a repetition,</p>
<p>   perhaps not in the precise numbers, but certainly in the general</p>
<p>   direction, a repetition of the extremely successful year that your</p>
<p>   industry has enjoyed in 1997.</p>
<p>We live as all of you know in a very turbulent</p>
<p>   part of the world economically. Since you last met a year ago, the</p>
<p>   economic situation in the Asian-Pacific region has deteriorated</p>
<p>   significantly. A number of countries, Indonesia, Korea and Thailand</p>
<p>   in particular, have needed substantial rescue packages from the</p>
<p>   International Monetary Fund. And I'm particularly proud that</p>
<p>   our own country has been strong enough to be, along with Japan,</p>
<p>   the only two countries in the world that have participated in those</p>
<p>   three rescue packages.</p>
<p>And our capacity to do that has been a direct result</p>
<p>   of our underlying economic strengths and a direct result of the</p>
<p>   economic policies we began to put in place when we were elected</p>
<p>   in March of 1996. If we had not strengthened our fiscal position,</p>
<p>   if we had not reduced our government outlays, if we had not sought</p>
<p>   to move from a budget deficit to a budget surplus, if we had not</p>
<p>   as a result seen significant reductions in interest rates and inflation,</p>
<p>   we would not have been in a position to help, through the IMF, those</p>
<p>   three countries.</p>
<p>It is equally fair to say that if we had not seen</p>
<p>   major reductions in interest rates over the last couple of years</p>
<p>   I do not believe that your industry would have experienced the boom</p>
<p>   in sales that it did, particularly in 1997. Because lower interest</p>
<p>   rates mean that more people, particularly young people buying into</p>
<p>   the cheaper end of the market have a greater capacity to involve</p>
<p>   themselves in motor car purchases than would otherwise be the case.</p>
<p>   And lower housing repayments and obligations in that area free disposable</p>
<p>   income for investment in the purchase of other goods, including</p>
<p>   motor vehicles.</p>
<p>The events in the Asia-Pacific region have not</p>
<p>   of course left Australia untouched, but it is fair to say that the</p>
<p>   impact of those events has been less than many feared when the deterioration</p>
<p>   commenced and certainly a lot less than would have been the case</p>
<p>   if the corrective measures I've alluded to had not been undertaken</p>
<p>   by the Government beginning in March of 1996. We are being affected,</p>
<p>   but we are not being hurt and affected to the extent that we would</p>
<p>   have been if we had followed a more lax and permissive approach</p>
<p>   to economic management.</p>
<p>What we have endeavoured to do over the last two</p>
<p>   years, be it in the area of motor vehicle policy, be it in the area</p>
<p>   of repairing the budget situation we inherited, be it in the area</p>
<p>   of industrial relations reform, all of those moves, all of those</p>
<p>   reforms have been directed towards strengthening the Australian</p>
<p>   economy. And I'm particularly pleased that we committed ourselves</p>
<p>   down that path two years ago because if we had not done so then</p>
<p>   we would have been more severely buffeted by the events in Asia</p>
<p>   than has turned out to be the case.</p>
<p>And all of our reform measures, be they ones in</p>
<p>   the past or be they ones in the future, are directed to one goal</p>
<p>   and one goal alone, and that is to strengthen the Australian economy</p>
<p>   and to give to the Australian economy a capacity to not only survive</p>
<p>   but to prosper in a very competitive world environment. And it's</p>
<p>   in that context that I turn very briefly to an area of economic</p>
<p>   reform which is crying aloud for attention, and that is the area</p>
<p>   of taxation reform.</p>
<p>Now I know that there is great interest in taxation</p>
<p>   reform in your industry. If ever there was a sector of the Australian</p>
<p>   economy which is penalised and denied the full results of its competitive</p>
<p>   effort and achievement, it is in the area of export manufacturing.</p>
<p>   And of course your own industry knows how counter-productive, penal</p>
<p>   and old-fashioned is the existing indirect taxation system in this</p>
<p>   country. And if one were looking in abstract, and one never does,</p>
<p>   at the Australian economy, one would have to conclude that there</p>
<p>   is something fundamentally myopic about a country maintaining an</p>
<p>   indirect tax system which we do at present which directly penalises</p>
<p>   people who wish to sell manufactured goods abroad. And that of course</p>
<p>   is precisely the situation in relation to your industry. And one</p>
<p>   of the strongest possible arguments for taxation reform in the area</p>
<p>   of indirect taxation is to replace the existing indirect taxation</p>
<p>   system with a taxation system that gives greater incentive and a</p>
<p>   fairer go to those who export manufactured goods from this country.</p>
<p>Now there are many arguments in favour of taxation</p>
<p>   reform but of all of them in the industry area none is more compelling</p>
<p>   and none is more incontestable than the proposition that the existing</p>
<p>   wholesale tax system blatantly discriminates against manufacturers</p>
<p>   and particularly discriminates against manufacturers who are involved</p>
<p>   in export.</p>
<p>We see taxation reform ladies and gentlemen as</p>
<p>   the next logical step in the further strengthening of the Australian</p>
<p>   economy. We don't see it as a revolution. We don't see</p>
<p>   it as a process of turning the Australian economy on its head. Rather</p>
<p>   we see it is a sensible further step to strengthen the Australian</p>
<p>   economy, to arm it with a more competitive ambience in the outside</p>
<p>   world, to give to it the break that more competitive taxation systems</p>
<p>   that other countries employ give to the export industries of those</p>
<p>   nations. Now, people will say it is hard, people will say it is</p>
<p>   risky, but at the end of the day it is the responsibility of the</p>
<p>   Government that is interested in the medium and the longer term</p>
<p>   to design and structure policies which will strengthen Australia</p>
<p>   in the medium to the longer term. </p>
<p>We are at the moment enjoying probably the strongest</p>
<p>   economic fundamentals that this country has had for 25 years. You</p>
<p>   have to go back that long or further to find interest rates that</p>
<p>   are as low as they are now. We have the lowest inflation rate in</p>
<p>   the OECD area. We have very strong levels of business investment.</p>
<p>   We hope by the turn of the century, even without the sale of the</p>
<p>   remaining two-thirds of Telstra to have halved our government debt</p>
<p>   to GDP ratio from the level it was in 1995, and if we are successful</p>
<p>   in relation to the sale of the remaining two-thirds of Telstra,</p>
<p>   we will reduce it to a bare 1.5% of GDP compared with a level of</p>
<p>   20% of GDP in 1995. </p>
<p>Now, that represents a very strong economic framework,</p>
<p>   but it doesn't represent an economic framework that I feel</p>
<p>   in any way complacent about, or one that should encourage us to</p>
<p>   rest on our laurels. As you know as business men and women, competing</p>
<p>   in the world is always about winning today's race. You can</p>
<p>   never derive any satisfaction in saying that my time was a lot faster</p>
<p>   than the time of an Australian competitor 20 years ago. You've</p>
<p>   got to win today's race to survive, you've got to win</p>
<p>   today's race and look forward to winning tomorrow's in</p>
<p>   order to make a decent profit. </p>
<p>And so it is with the management of an economy.</p>
<p>   Having achieved one reform goal and having been able to say that</p>
<p>   the economic foundations of the country are in very good shape,</p>
<p>   you must then go on to achieving the next goal. You must ask yourself</p>
<p>   what is the next logical step that will strengthen the Australian</p>
<p>   economy and enable it to win the next race and to win it very comfortably.</p>
<p>   In our view, that next step is the very important one of taxation</p>
<p>   reform. When I look back at the last 15 or 20 years of economic</p>
<p>   management in Australia and I think of the barriers to competitiveness</p>
<p>   that existed 20 years ago, and I think of how one by one those barriers</p>
<p>   in different ways have been modified or removed, I think we have</p>
<p>   been quite successful and quite mature as a country with our approach</p>
<p>   to economic management. </p>
<p>But in the area of taxation reform, we've</p>
<p>   had a few goes in the past but haven't been very successful,</p>
<p>   and it is a challenge to our maturity, our capacity to look to the</p>
<p>   medium to longer term, our willingness to worry about the kind of</p>
<p>   21st Century economically that we are going to leave to our children</p>
<p>   and grandchildren, it's in that context that we need to look</p>
<p>   at those remaining areas of reform that need to be addressed. </p>
<p>So it is against that background ladies and gentlemen</p>
<p>   that we are looking of course, and we'll be unveiling to the</p>
<p>   Australian public the outline of our plans to reform and re-shape</p>
<p>   the Australian taxation system. They are about making Australia</p>
<p>   a more competitive nation. They are about improving the opportunities</p>
<p>   for Australian manufacturers to export and export successfully,</p>
<p>   and they are about looking to the medium and longer term prosperity</p>
<p>   and strength of the Australian economy.</p>
<p>I want to take this opportunity again of thanking</p>
<p>   the industry for the contribution that it has made to the Australian</p>
<p>   economy over many years, and the contribution particularly that</p>
<p>   it as made in recent years. I want to congratulate the new members</p>
<p>   of the Automotive Trade Council, David Morgan, Sam Komori, Jim Wiemils,</p>
<p>   Mike Quinn, John MacKenzie, Bruce Griffiths, Grant Anderson and</p>
<p>   Graham Bulmer. The Automotive Trade Council will be charged with</p>
<p>   directing the market access and development strategy and the council</p>
<p>   will have a four year charter to deliver the markets which will</p>
<p>   secure the industry's future. The Council will be aided by</p>
<p>   Ian Grigg as my Government's special automotive envoy and he</p>
<p>   will spearhead representations to foreign Governments and companies</p>
<p>   with a view to winning market access, two way investment and strategic</p>
<p>   integration into global supply chains. It has been a very good year</p>
<p>   for the industry, it's been a momentus year, a year of very</p>
<p>   frank and direct exchange between the Government and the industry,</p>
<p>   a year in which long term stability was provided to the industry</p>
<p>   by the decisions of the Government. I look forward very enthusiastically</p>
<p>   to a continuation of that partnership and the opportunity in the</p>
<p>   future to again hear of the great success of the industry and of</p>
<p>   the contribution that it continues to make to the Australian economy.</p>
<p>   Thank you very much.</p>
