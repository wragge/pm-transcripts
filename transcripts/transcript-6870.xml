TRANSCRIPT OF PRESS CONFERENCE AT 377 SUSSEX STREET,<br />
SYDNEY 21 MARCH 1986<br />
E 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
JOURNALIST: inaudible<br />
PM: Well, I don't know there is such dissension in their<br />
ranks that it is very likely to appear I would think.<br />
JOURNALIST: You are obviously very happy about the way<br />
things have been going?<br />
PM: Well, it Is nothing much more than you wouJd expect<br />
really. This is the worst Opposition in, I think, the<br />
history of federal politics. The most inept leadership<br />
I have been saying from the time that this Parliament<br />
resumed that the media should be watching the Opposition<br />
parties because they were going to be fractured by different<br />
factions, philosophies and opportunisms. And that is<br />
the way It is working -out. They have no principles,<br />
they have no policies. And it is inevitable in that<br />
situation that you are going to have this degeneration<br />
in the rabble that you have got.<br />
JOU1NALIST: Mr Hawke any comments on what you will be<br />
discussing today at the meeting.<br />
PM: NO, 1 always maintain my comments for in the meetj'ng<br />
not outside.<br />
JOURNALIST: Will interest rates be a topic of discussion?<br />
PM: No. of course not.<br />
JOURNALIST: ANy idea of what is on page four?<br />
PM: NO. Tt Is fasctnating. If they had to keep that<br />
quiet, may be it is the liquidation list. I just don't<br />
know. / 2<br />

JOURNALIST: Would you expect some sort of challenge<br />
to Mr Howard, given the number of leaks from the Party<br />
in recent times?<br />
PM: I don't think it it just because of the leaks.<br />
As I said before, they have no principles. They have<br />
never really worked out what they stood for. They have<br />
had government for a fair while by default. They have<br />
never had to address themselves to what they really believe.<br />
And of course, it emerges that they believe in nothing<br />
except power. So they have no capacity to develop policies<br />
because they have no principles from which to develop<br />
policies. And in that sort of vacuum of principle and<br />
policy, what comes to the surface inevitably is personal<br />
lusts for power. What comes to the top is the pursuit<br />
of particular personal possessions. In that situation<br />
you will have leaks, you will have backbiting. And you<br />
will have very tenuous holds of positions of power.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, all I want is a tip for the Slipper?<br />
PM: Well, I have to confess that I haven't had a chance<br />
yet to study the form as closely as I would like to,<br />
but my preliminary position is Bounding Away and IMperial<br />
BAron, but I would like to have a look at the form of<br />
this New Zealander Scotch and Dry, it seems to be fairly<br />
good. JOURNALIST: What about for a bit of value?<br />
PM: For a bit of value? Perhaps Bataan,<br />
JOURNALIST: drought along the East Coast, is that<br />
a concern to the Government re the balance of payments<br />
problem? PM: Well, you never want a drought. But at this stage<br />
it hasn't been put to me as something that is likely<br />
to occur. Our problem, of course, is the prices we get<br />
for our products. We are amongst the world's most efficient<br />
producers of rural products. The great tragedy is that<br />
our farming community, the best in the world, is being<br />
mutilated by a corrupted international market. And that<br />
is why I am going to see President Reagan. Why 1 am<br />
going to press the case of Australian farmers. It is<br />
a tragedy that these men and women, who work so hard,<br />
more efficiently than anyone else in the world, are not<br />
getting a proper reward for their efforts because of<br />
this corruption of the international market initiated<br />
by the Europeans and now compounded by the understandable<br />
concern of the Americans who are trying to retaliate<br />
against the Europeans, but in that retaliation Australia<br />
could be hurt. So that is why I am going to the United<br />
States to try and ensure that the proper interests of<br />
Australians are protected. / 3<br />

PM: Well1, te'L me say that the matters to which 1 have<br />
beun referring, the corruption of international markets,<br />
has been a major factor in the massiv'e turnaround in<br />
