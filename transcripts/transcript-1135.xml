FOR PRESS P. M. No. 57/ 1965<br />
LORD C-ASEY'S APPOINTMENT AS GOVERNOR-GENERAL<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister? the RtHon. Sir Robert Menzies<br />
This appointment gives us great delight and satisfaction.<br />
I am certain that the people of Australia will welcome<br />
it warmly. I know that Her Majesty The Queen has most<br />
readily and happily agreed that a distinguished Australian<br />
might be her representative in Australia, and in approving<br />
this appointment, she has expressed her particular pleasure<br />
concerning it,<br />
As is well known, Lord Casey has, over many years,<br />
given most excellent service to Australia in many public<br />
fields, and to -the Commonwealti also. His name stands<br />
very high within Australia and overseas.<br />
It is a matter of great pleasure, officially and<br />
personally, to me and my colleagues that this new honour,<br />
and this new high field of service, which he will perform<br />
with great distinction, will now be his. W4e send, as all<br />
Australians will send, sincere congratulations to Lord and<br />
Lady Casey. No time has yet been fixed for Lord Casey to take<br />
up office, though it is likely to be within a period of two<br />
months. It will depend on arrangements still to be made<br />
with Lord Casey and, of course with His Excellency the<br />
Administrator Sir Henry Abel 9mith, who will continue in<br />
office until Lord Casey is sworn in. It will be appropriate<br />
for me to refer at a later time to the work of Sir Henry<br />
Abel Smith, but I mention at this stage that the Government<br />
most greatly appreciates his service to the Commonwealth of<br />
Australia. MELBOURNE<br />
28th July, 1965. </p>
