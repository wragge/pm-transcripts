    <content><![CDATA[<p>Thanks very much Jeff. Thanks very much Kate Carnell. It is an honour to be here. I acknowledge the presence of very many parliamentary colleagues led by the Opposition Leader Bill Shorten, the Shadow Minister.</p>
<p>I should particularly acknowledge Dr Andrew Southcott who has had a long interest in this area. Dr David Gillespie who has also dealt with this issue as a medical practitioner, as well as more recently as a Member of Parliament.</p>
<p>Yes Jeff, in 2005 as health minister I helped to launch the Rotary Winnebago. We’ve moved up to a bus because the issue has just got bigger as the years have gone by.</p>
<p>At some point in our lives one in five of us will suffer a significant mental health issue. At any one time some 1 million Australians are suffering from depression and in any one year tragically some 2000 Australians will take their lives.</p>
<p>This is a very serious issue and as Jeff said as much as we do, it’s never enough. We are doing more than ever before. I was pleased as health minister to preside over the $2 billion better outcomes in mental health programme initiative taken by the Howard government. I have to say that was largely in response to a lot pressure in our party room, led at the time by Warren Entsch who’s continued to have a very significant interest in this area.</p>
<p>So this really is a community campaign, it is a community campaign to reach out to our fellow Australian in need, to reach out to our fellow human being in trouble and to try to do what we can – as friends, as family, as citizens, as professionals – to do everything we reasonably can to help people through the dark moments in their life.</p>
<p>Dark moments will come – for some, very dark indeed. We need to be aware of them; we need to reach out to them.</p>
<p>Mental health has been the hidden epidemic for so long, but thanks to people like Jeff and Kate and everyone associated with <em>beyondblue</em>, and I notice a couple of board members over there – Professor Michael Kidd and Paul Howes. Thanks to the efforts of <em>beyondblue</em> we are doing better, but we are never going to do enough and the challenge always is to do more and to do better.</p>
<p>So, thank you so much Jeff and it’s my honour – my challenge – to declare this blue bus officially launched.</p>
