    <content><![CDATA[<p>We are pleased to release the Final Report of the Referendum Council, a body established in 2015 to provide guidance on constitutional change to recognise Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians.</p>
<p>This is an issue of importance to all Australians, and one that deserves careful and thorough consideration.</p>
<p>Today is another important step on the path to constitutional recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians.</p>
<p>The Council undertook a significant consultation process, seeking the views of all Australians through hosting a digital engagement platform and conducting regional dialogues with First Australians across the nation. </p>
<p>This historic Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander consultation process culminated in the landmark First Nations National Constitutional Convention held in Uluru in May, and the adoption of the Uluru Statement from the Heart.</p>
<p>Today we met with the Referendum Council to discuss the recommendations presented in the final report in greater detail. We will now take the time to consider the recommendations and the best way forward. </p>
<p>We wish to thank the Referendum Council, led by Co-Chairs Ms Pat Anderson AO and Mr Mark Leibler AC, for their dedication and commitment.</p>
<p>The final report is available at referendumcouncil.org.au</p>
