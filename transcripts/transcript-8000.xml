FOR MEDIA 6 APRIL 1990<br />
EMBARGOED UNTIL 6.00AM 6 APRIL 1990<br />
I am delighted to announce that the British Government has<br />
agreed to make a gift to Australia of an original document<br />
containing our Australian Constitution.<br />
The document is an original copy of the Commonwealth of<br />
Australia Constitution Act the British Act of Parliament<br />
which was passed in 1900 and which brought our nation into<br />
existence on 1 January 1901.<br />
The document, which has been on loan to Australia since the<br />
Bicentenary and is on display in Parliament House, is the<br />
British Government's own record of the Act. There would be<br />
no more original version of the Australia Constitution.<br />
This is the first time that such a gift has been made to any<br />
country by the British Government and it follows some six<br />
years of negotiations by the Australian Government.<br />
Release of the document to Australia will require<br />
legislation in the British Parliament and Mrs Thatcher has<br />
informed me that the necessary legislative arrangements will<br />
be made as soon as possible. I expect that the formal<br />
transfer will occur later this year.<br />
I wish to express my gratitude, on behalf of the Australian<br />
people, to the British Government and to Mrs Thatcher in<br />
particular for making possible this unique gift.<br />
I would also like to thank Mr Alf Morris MP, the Chairman of<br />
the ANZAC Group of Parliamentarians at Westminster, who<br />
previously introduced a private member's Bill into the House<br />
of Commons on this subject.<br />
I am also appreciative of the efforts of High Commissioner<br />
Doug McClelland and his staff in London.<br />
In a very real sense, our birth certificate as a nation will<br />
be returning home. </p>
