    <content><![CDATA[<p>Prime Minister Julia Gillard and Arts Minister Simon Crean today announced the shortlists for the 2012 Prime Minister's Literary Awards and congratulated the shortlisted authors and producers.</p>
<p>The 2012 shortlists recognise some of the strongest literary talent and history expertise in Australia and feature a range of authors and producers from award-winners to first-time novelists.</p>
<p>This year's Awards are the largest ever, including an inaugural poetry award and the newly incorporated Prize for Australian History, with over five hundred entries across all categories.</p>
<p>This was a very competitive year for the Awards and all the judges were extremely impressed with the high calibre of work entered.</p>
<p>The shortlists include a diverse range of entries from richly illustrated children's books to powerful documentaries with a broad range of themes including Indigenous history, family conflict, alienation, memoirs and fantasy.</p>
<p>In particular, the shortlist for the inaugural poetry award  -  a welcome and important introduction to the Awards  -  includes strong and innovative works, continuing Australia's rich tradition of the poetic voice.</p>
<p>It is also encouraging to see publishers of all sizes represented in this year's Awards, including small â€˜micro'-publishers, independent Australian-owned publishers, university presses and multinational publishers.</p>
<p>A total of $600,000 will be awarded in six award categories making the Prime Minister's Literary Awards the nation's richest literary awards in Australia. A prize of $80,000 tax-free will be awarded to the final winner in each of the award categories: fiction, non-fiction, Australian history, poetry, young adult fiction and children's fiction. Shortlisted entries also receive $5,000 tax-free.</p>
<p>The Gillard Government has also provided support to Australian authors, publishers, booksellers and libraries through investing $1.3 million in the National Year of Reading 2012.</p>
<p>All Australians are encouraged to reignite their passion for reading with these imaginative and compelling Australian stories during the National Year of Reading.</p>
