PRESS OFFICE-TRANSCRIPT WEDNESDAY, 27 FEBRUARY, 1980<br />
PRIME MINISTER INTERVIEWED BY RICHARD CARLETON<br />
ON ABC'S " NATIONWIDE"<br />
Clive Hale<br />
First up tonight, Federal Parliament, and in the House of<br />
Representatives the second successive day of uproar over the<br />
Afghanistan question as both sides indulged in acromonious<br />
debate; debate that reached a personal level not seen in<br />
the House in recent years. Reporting from our Canberra studio,<br />
Richard Carleton.<br />
Carleton Labor won yesterday's Parliamentary encounter, 60-40, and today<br />
in my assessment they won hands down. As much as anything,<br />
the Government's error has been tactical. Smarting as the<br />
Government was after yesterday's drubbing, today they sought<br />
to reverse the tide. It was the Government that brought<br />
the Afghanistan issue. back on for debate and they sought to<br />
argue that the Labor Party was undermining efforts to establish<br />
an effective response to the Soviet invasion. But by debating<br />
the issue again so soon, they have merely provided another<br />
opportunity, for a very buoyed opposition and an especially<br />
buoyed Mr. Hayden to play them on their weak spot: the<br />
inconsistency of boycotting the Olympic Games but continuing<br />
with the wool sales. And to Mr. Viner, the Leader of the<br />
Government in the House, who led for the Government, and<br />
his was a very pedestrian performance. Mr. Lynch, the Deputy<br />
Leader of the Liberal Party followed. Mr. Lynch is probably<br />
the Government's poorest debater and he read a very dull speech.<br />
It fell to Treasurer Howard to save even greaLer embarrassment.<br />
His was a stirring effort, and what's more, it was needed.<br />
For Mr. Hayden, yesterday and today, he has put in the best<br />
performancesthat I have seen from him in the twelve years<br />
that I have watched him in the Parliament. He has both his<br />
head and his heart in this issue and it couldn't have come at<br />
a better time for him. He needs now to be seen as an effective<br />
and a strong leader if he is to-carry the day this Friday<br />
when he attempts Federal intervention in the affairs of the<br />
State Branch of his Party in Queensland.<br />
But having said that, Mr. Hayden did decline to appear on<br />
the programme this evening. The butt of the opposition's<br />
attack and the man who has collected the thrown mud, the man<br />
whose integrity has been impuned, is the Prime minister, Mr. Fraser.<br />
Mr. Fraser, I thank you very much for coming on the programme<br />
this evening sir. Could I suggest to you that the Opposition's<br />
attack has been effective largely because they have been able<br />
to sustain, true or otherwise, the emotive line that your wool<br />
from Nareen, your family property, is keeping Russian soldiers<br />
warm in Afghanistan. / 2 </p>
<p>-2<br />
Prime Minister<br />
I hope you are not going to promote something that you know,<br />
as you introduced this programme, to be totally and<br />
completely false. It has been promoted by Mr. Hawke. It has<br />
been promoted by Mr. Hayden, but I. thought that the ABC was<br />
meant to be impartial and I did not think that you were<br />
meant to be here to promote something that is, as you know,<br />
totally false.<br />
Carleton It is the opportunity for you to give your story...<br />
Prime Minister<br />
But it has already been said and you know it quite well.<br />
Carleton It was said by you today, I think it was said..<br />
Prime Minister<br />
It. ' had been said by other people on many other occasions.<br />
Carleton Yes, that your wool has not gone to the Soviet Union.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Now, look, if you want to debate this on a personal basis,<br />
as Mr. Hayden has, that is your entitlement. But at the same<br />
time I would have thought it much better for this whole matter<br />
to be debated on the basis of policy. Your introduction to<br />
this programme, your introduction to yesterday's programme,<br />
is that of an observer who is looking only at the words that<br />
are used. It does not bother to go underneath, the words that are<br />
used in that Parliament,:. to see what is said, to note that<br />
in Mr. Hayden's attack on myself it was the most personal attack<br />
in totality, without one element of fact, without one element<br />
of argument, without one element of substance, and you took<br />
the froth and the bubble without bothering to go the<br />
analysis of what was happening, of what had been said.<br />
Carleton<br />
Let me try that now then sir. Let me try that now.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
You try it, but let's keep on the policy issues..<br />
Carleton<br />
But the hard political fact, let me suggest sir are<br />
Prime Minister<br />
The policy issues I think we will stick on... </p>
<p>-3<br />
Carleton But the hard political fact I am suggesting to you is that<br />
the opposition is winning this because they are succeeding<br />
in having the mud stick. That the impression, and you<br />
say wrongly and I<br />
Prime Minister<br />
And you are helping, very greatly.<br />
Carleton No. Prime Minister<br />
Oh yes. In the introduction<br />
Carleton Offering you the opportunity to knock it down sir.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Good, fine. Because your introduction to this programme<br />
yesterday and your introduction of the programme tonight<br />
was helping them to have that mud stick. Your first question<br />
was designed, perhaps, or not designed, I do not know, to have<br />
that mud stick on something which you know to be false. Let's<br />
debate the issues. Let's debate the Olympic boycott and<br />
why that is important. Why the Human Rights Commission<br />
in Poland believes it is important. Why they think that their<br />
people, the Poles, should not go to Moscow for the Olympic<br />
Games because it is a nation that has been struggling for<br />
freedom for 200 years. How many Australians would want to go<br />
to the Olympic Gamnes in Moscow if the Soviets has put 100,000<br />
troops into Papua New Guinea. Wouldn't you like to answer<br />
that question?<br />
Carleton That not for me to answer sir.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Oh yes it is. You give opinions on a great many things.<br />
You are entitled to give an answer to that question.<br />
Carleton Well, you might like to speak to Sir Talbot Duckinanton about<br />
that. ./ 4 </p>
<p>-4<br />
Prime Minister<br />
No. You have given opinions on a great many programmes your<br />
own much, much more political than that. You will not<br />
prejudice your* ABC impartiality by answering that question.<br />
Carleton<br />
My contract is in the wind at the moment.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
I think you might do better by answering the question than<br />
by not answering the question. If they put 100,000 troops<br />
into Indonesia instead of Afghanistan, do you think any<br />
Australian would want to go, would dare to go to Moscow?<br />
Come on, please answer it. Surely.<br />
Carleton I think yes, probably many would go to Moscow, yes.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
If they had put .100,000 Soviet troops into Indonesia, in<br />
an invasion, do you think Australians would still go?<br />
Carl eton<br />
I don't want to get into the position where I-. am just voicing<br />
my ill-informed views on issues like this though sir. But<br />
I mean you go back to the time when<br />
Prime Minister<br />
At least you are gracious enough to say they are ill-informed.<br />
Carleton Well, of course they are sir. I mean I don't have any<br />
access to the information that you have. I mean that is why<br />
you are here. I have asked you -here to hear your views.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
But I am trying to drive home to you that this invasion<br />
of Afghanistan is a serious matter. That this is what the<br />
Government has been talking about. On this programme yesterday,<br />
and in introducing it today, you tried to pick up the froth<br />
and the bubble. But let's get down to the substance of it:<br />
an invasion by the most powerful land army in the world<br />
of a small non-aligned state that could not never have offered<br />
any threat to anyone. Many people have likened what the<br />
Soviets have done to Germany's marching into the Rhineland<br />
in 1936. Then, because France did nothing, because Britain<br />
did nothing, they marched into Austria. Italy marched into<br />
Ethiopia. They marched into Czechoslovakia and ultimately<br />
into Poland and ultimately a World War was joined in which tens<br />
of millions of people died. I really do believe it is time<br />
that the media and the Parliament I make no excuses for the<br />
Parliament because Mr. Hayden has personalised this issue, </p>
<p>Prime Minister ( continued)<br />
whether it is wool or whatever, has sought to personalise<br />
it in a way which is a disgrace to the substance and the<br />
importance of the issue, in v~ hich men's lives, of your age<br />
and of mine and of younger and of older are at stake and are<br />
being killed and dying at this very moment.<br />
Carleton<br />
Mr. Fraser, why should Australians accept your assessment<br />
of Afghanistan and the importance of Afghanistan.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
But it is not my assessment.<br />
Carleton The argument that you put now of the importance of<br />
Afghanistan, when ten years ago sir, in your capacity<br />
then, Minister for Defence, Minister for the Army in previous<br />
governments, you put forward the argument of the domino theory<br />
and that Australia was threatened by the events in Vietnam.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
And do you think that has not been so? Do you think that<br />
what has happened in Vietnam, with the victory of North<br />
Vietnam, then moving 22 divisions into Kampuchea, establishing<br />
a refugee movement that resulted in more people being sent out<br />
of Vietnam than left Germany in all the days of the 1930s, with<br />
the instability that that had the potential for creating in<br />
South East Asia, with the problems in Thailand because of<br />
refugees pouring across that border, to a country that could<br />
ill afford to look after them, another half million refugees<br />
already in Pakistan as a result of Afghanistan, with the<br />
expectation of that rising to a-million -not on my count but<br />
on the count of people who know, the relief authorities, the<br />
United Nations agencies. One of the most remarkable things about<br />
Russian victories, communist victories because that -is what<br />
they are, is their capacity to create refugee movements of vast*<br />
masses of peoples. Really, it is important* that these matters<br />
be treated for what they are. It was not a frivolous question<br />
when I said what would you do about the Olympic Games if<br />
they had marched into Papua.: New Guinea or Indonesia, because<br />
that then brings it closer to us. Closer to an understanding<br />
that a life is a life whether it is here, in Indonesia or in<br />
Afghanistan. Carleton or Vietnam.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Or Vietnam, yes. The de-stabilising effects, the refugees that<br />
have occurred have been a direct consequence of North Vietnam's<br />
victory. -It was Lionel Bowen, Deputy Leader of the Labor Party,<br />
who said in the Parliament over the last day or two, that </p>
<p>6<br />
Prime Minister ( continued)<br />
unless we get the Russians out of Vietnam, get the<br />
Russians out of Kampuchea, we are going to be in a very<br />
dangerous situation. That is his judgement, support<br />
of the Government's. He did not speak much about Afghanistan.<br />
But what the President of the United States is about, what<br />
the French and the Germans and the British are about is not<br />
making the mistakes that were made between 1936 and 1940, in<br />
the early part of this decade of the 1980s. That really is<br />
a substantial matter. I think that when you put that<br />
alongside the personal attacks and the vituperation that has<br />
come from some people in that Parliament over the last day<br />
or two, trying to undermine theithrust of the Government's<br />
effectiveness and its policies in relation to Afghanistan,<br />
I think it is a tragedy, not only for the Parliament,<br />
but it is a tragedy for Australia.<br />
Carleton I am going to end it. I am going to end also on a domestic<br />
political note sir. Are you conscious that some of your own<br />
backbench, and probably much more importantly, some of your<br />
own Ministers, are have been critical of your performance over<br />
the last couple of days.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Now, I really think that that is taking personality politics.<br />
Playing Mr. Hayden's game, isn't it?<br />
Carleton I ( inaudible) intended to sir.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Yes, I know. But I know if anyone wanted to be they would be<br />
critical to me. They wouldn't be critical to you. So you<br />
saying that here and now, it is really playing the Labor<br />
Party's game for them. 000---<br />
