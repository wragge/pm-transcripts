FOR PRESS: P. M. No. 58/ 196-1<br />
R. W. MILLER TANKER<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister, the Rt. Hon. Sir<br />
Robert Menzies<br />
" The matter of the conditions on which a<br />
foreign-built ship should or should not be permitted<br />
to be licensed under our Navigation Act to trade on the<br />
Australian coast raises quite a number of difficult<br />
questions including the future of the Australian<br />
shipbuilding industry," Sir Robert Menzies said in<br />
Canberra today. " Several of my colleagues will be<br />
submitting papers to Cabinet on various aspects of<br />
the problem. The formulation of policy will not be an<br />
easy exercise when it is understood that there are such<br />
significant aspects as shipbuilding, foreign exchange,<br />
costs and the overall fuel position to be taken into<br />
consideration. I cannot at present anticipate what<br />
policy will be evolved." 1<br />
" Pending the formulation and announcement<br />
of its policy on these matters, the Government has decided<br />
to allow R, W, Miller Co. Pty. Ltd. to import the oil<br />
tanker MERCHANT KNIGHT under the Customs ( prohibited<br />
Imports) Regulations and to license this ship under the<br />
Navigation Act, on the conditions that the tanker will<br />
be operated on the Australian coast and under Australian<br />
Articles. Having regard to the fact that tankers now<br />
operate from time to time along the Australian coast under<br />
overseas registration and manning conditions, we cannot<br />
reasonably refuse R. W. Miller Coets present application,<br />
which is to import a tanker, register it in Australia,<br />
and operate it under Australian manning conditions."<br />
Sir Robert emphasised that the decision to<br />
allow the import of this tanker should not be regarded<br />
as creating a precedent. No other application to import<br />
a tanker would be considered until the whole position<br />
had been thoroughly examined by the Government.<br />
CANBERRA, 26th July, 1963. </p>
