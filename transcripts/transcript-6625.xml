TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER ON AM 23 April 1985<br />
E 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
HARRISON: the Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, to talk about<br />
some of the unpopular decisions which camne out of Canberra<br />
yesterday petrol up by 4 cents a litre, and that will give the<br />
Government a nice dividend of another $ 640 or so million in a<br />
full year, and there are to be cuts in Government spending<br />
up around a $ 1 billion. Mr-Hawke did not specify where these<br />
cuts would be made. They're to be announced in what's described<br />
as an economic statement in May, even though it won't deal with<br />
revenue, that does sound remarkably like what used to be called<br />
a mini-Budget. Well all this is being headlined this morning<br />
as a signal of the Government's determination ' to make<br />
tough economic decisions. But are they in fact so tough, but<br />
is the Government merely-trying to give the impression of being<br />
tough. Mr Hawke is in our Canberra studio now with Prue Goward<br />
and Warwick Beutler.<br />
BEUTLER: Mr Hawke, if. we could deal with the petrol pricing<br />
policy first, it's generally interpreted as'a good economic<br />
decision but I'm sure that that's not the way motorists will see<br />
it when they pull into the petrol pumps on May 1 and find that<br />
petrol has gone up by 4 cents a litre.<br />
No, obviously motorists would prefer not to have an<br />
increase in prices, but motorists are not-only motorists. They<br />
are citizens in the broader sense and what the citizens of<br />
Australia want, I believe, is sensible economic policy making by<br />
this Government which is going to ensure that the economic<br />
recovery which we've initiated in our two years in Government<br />
continues so that there's solid growth with more employment<br />
opportunities. And ' you're not going to get that unless you're<br />
prepared to make the relevant economic decisions, and this is<br />
one of them.<br />
BEUTLER: How do you justify the 4 cents a litre rise to motorists<br />
though?<br />
PM: Well very simply.' It's a continuation of the policy which<br />
has been endorsed now by both Parties, that you have what we<br />
call import parity pricing, which moves the price of Australian<br />
crude in line with the Arab light marker price. And that, of<br />
course, in our terms has gone up because of the devaluation of<br />
the Australian dollar. And it should be noted, if you want to </p>
<p>bring the politics into it and I welcome that fact that they've<br />
done it, but the opposition has supported and endorsed the<br />
decision that we've taken. So it's not a question of the motorist<br />
saying it's a terrible Government, it is a bi-partisan, acrossthe-<br />
board approach.<br />
BEUTLER: Well your colleague, Victorian Premier John Cain,<br />
doesn't think so. He says business needs this like a hole in the<br />
head. PM: Yes, well Mr Cain does not have the responsibility for<br />
the economic management of the Australian economy as a whole.<br />
Now I can understand State Premiers wanting to say things which<br />
they regard as helpful for them in terms of their domestic<br />
politics. That's alright. We learn to live with that. Mr Cain<br />
and Victoria have been the beneficiaries of Australia's economic<br />
prosperity under the policies of this Government. And you can't<br />
have it both ways. If you want to be the beneficiaries of our<br />
good economic policies then you have to understand that hard<br />
decisions at times have to be made.<br />
BEUTLER: Can we read from the decision that it is more important<br />
for the Government to be seen to be taking those tough decisions<br />
and getting the deficit down than worrying about the inflationary<br />
effects of the price rise in petrol.<br />
PM: No, no. Look economics has been called the dismal science<br />
and in one sense it's the-dismal science because it's very rarely<br />
the case that an economic decision taken for the best possible<br />
aggregate of reasons is not going to have some adverse impact<br />
somewhere in the economy upon some people, perhaps on a lot of<br />
people. That is in the. nature of ec6noftic6s. If it were just<br />
a case of managing an Australian economy wher: e you just sat<br />
back and pressed this button and that button and-: watched the<br />
grins~ light up in the faces all over Australia, it would be very<br />
easy. But life and economics is not like that. We have come<br />
to be living beyond our resources.<br />
BEUTLER: How have we been doing that?<br />
PM: Well let me just make the point if you look at the<br />
Government of Australia and go back to 1949 to 1985, that means<br />
Australia has been governed now for 35 years since ' 49 by<br />
definition that's simple arithmetic, and out of that period<br />
there's only been five non-Labor years. The situation in this<br />
country, the economic structure, the attitudes, the assumptions<br />
have basically been fashioned by 30 years of non-Labor Government.<br />
Now what we inherited when we came in was a deficit that was the<br />
highest that had been seen. We were looking at a $ 9.6 billion<br />
deficit. Now what we've been doing is trying to cut in to the<br />
deficit we inherited. We're going to continue to do that and<br />
we'll do it in a way which means that Australia's economic<br />
growth will be sustained. We rescued it from recession. We've<br />
brought high levels of growth. To be able to continue to do<br />
that, to enable the private sector to expand, the Government must </p>
<p>bring down the level of the deficit so we don't have those<br />
upward pressures on interest rates in the market. That's what<br />
we're doing.<br />
BEUTLER: But how can you tell ALP supporters that they're<br />
living beyond their means. Surely that's just an insult to them.<br />
PM: Why is it an insult? I accept that they are intelligent<br />
people, and that they will understand that you can't have<br />
a situation of, as I saya $ 10 billion deficit we were looking<br />
at when we came in, which just meant you were going to have<br />
interest rates going through the roof, which meant that it was<br />
the ordinary people of Australia, the ones who have the least<br />
capacity to protect themselves, that were going to suffer the<br />
most. GOWARD: Mr Hawke, does living beyond itsmeans include the<br />
trade union movement.<br />
PM: Trade unionists are Australians. All Australians have<br />
got to understand that we, in aggregate, can't go on just<br />
having spending programs which you finance out of the deficit<br />
and which you're then going to be borrowing money and pushing<br />
up interest rates. Because that not only means that you're<br />
going to be pushing up interest rates as suc h and imposing<br />
pressures upon people. By definition that ' Means a lack of<br />
capacity then, or will, on the part of the private sector to<br />
go ahead with an investment and create jobs. And we've got the<br />
position which people have got to understand, I've been saying<br />
it for years, I repeat it now, that you will not have a healthy<br />
Australia unless you have a healthy priVate sector. The private<br />
. sector provides three out of every four jobis in Australia.<br />
GOWARD: I take it by that you don't mean that wage levels in<br />
this country are too high.<br />
PM: Well, wage levels cannot go on rising in real terms. There's<br />
a case for being able to sustain the real level of wages through<br />
time and so that there is in that way, as productivity increases,<br />
a gradual adjustment to capacity. But it's not just a question<br />
of wages. It's the whole attitude of Australians that have<br />
tended to build up under all these years of conservative Government<br />
that you can just say you're living in lotus land. We're not<br />
living in lotus land. The world does not owe Australia a living.<br />
GOWARD: Well does that mean that the long term trend for<br />
Australian wage rates is downwards.<br />
PM: No, it doesn't mean that. What it means is that you've<br />
got existing levels, productivity is increasing through time,<br />
and there's got to be a preparedness and let me say to the<br />
trade union movement and on their behalf, they have been very<br />
co-operative and I have publicly, and I again do now, acknowledge<br />
the co-operation of the trade union movement with the Government<br />
in attempting to create an economic environment in which growth<br />
can occur, that has taken place. We've had very substantial </p>
<p>economic growth. And I look forward to the continued<br />
co-operation of the trade union movement. But it's not just<br />
the trade unions. It's no good just talking about them.<br />
It requires all sections of the community to understand that<br />
we have a basically very strong economy, one which if managed<br />
sensibly with the co-operation of the Australian people, can<br />
go on to very much better things. But it's a question of<br />
not seeking too quickly to grab the fruits of what should be<br />
regarded as longer term harvest.<br />
GOWARD: Well looking at your partnership with the ACTU and<br />
the Accord, ACTU Secretary Bill Kelty, amongst others, is<br />
reportedly critical of the Government's handling say of tax<br />
reform and he says that you've lost your way.<br />
PM: Oh, well, you have read as I have read this morning the<br />
front page of the Financial Review where it is said in some<br />
private conversation Mr Kelty may have said something. It's<br />
very interesting that you get some alleged private conversation<br />
being the subject then of a headline saying this is Kelty's<br />
position. He hasn't said it to us. I haven't seen him say<br />
it publicly.<br />
GOWARD: So you think your relationship with the trade union<br />
movement over the Accord is strong.<br />
PM: I think th-e relationship with the trade union movement over<br />
the Accord is strong. I don't mean by that that-. the trade<br />
union movement agrees with everything we'vye done. Of course<br />
they haven't and it wouldn't be a good day for Australia where<br />
they did agree with everything we did, or where we operated<br />
in a way which would only do things thdte the trade unions<br />
movement liked,. That's never been my position. I-said in the<br />
election campaign in February 1983 that you must: understand,<br />
I said to them directly, that we won't be always'doing things<br />
that you want. We won't be the handmaiden, the Government<br />
won't be the handmaiden, of the trade union movement. It's<br />
not and it will not be. What we have tried to do successfully<br />
is to talk with and co-operate with the trade union movement<br />
because this country does not want any more the confrontationism<br />
which marked the seven years of the previous Government and<br />
which was part of the reason why we subsided into the worst<br />
recession since the 1930' s.<br />
BEUTLER: What effect do you expect yesterday's announcements<br />
to have on business confidence and on the value of the dollar<br />
which seems to have-remained much the same at about 63 cents<br />
overnight. PM: Well I would hope that the markets would see this as<br />
evidence, not of something new, I mean we have made it quite<br />
clear that we were going to take the. firm and tough economic<br />
decisions that were necessary to keep this economy going on<br />
a good path. But here, you have the proof positive of that. </p>
<p>I woUld hope that will have beneficial effects. I think it<br />
will. BEUTLER: How real will the spending cuts be in next month's<br />
economic statement.<br />
PM: Well as I said in the press conference yesterday, Warwick, if<br />
you'd been in the Expenditure Review Committee and watched<br />
the Ministers going through the grinder as it were, there's<br />
no doubt about the reality of the case.<br />
BEUTLER: Turning now to the brawl in the Victorian Branch<br />
of the ALP, the violence continued yesterday. Do you believe<br />
the hardliners in the Left should leave the Labor Party.<br />
PM: Well, let me put it this way if they will not accept the<br />
decision and if they think they can carry on like this, there's<br />
no place for them in the Labor Party. If they, as I said at the<br />
press conference yesterday, the decisions have been taken, I've<br />
worked a long time to get this and so have a lot of other people,<br />
those decisions have been taken. They will stick. They will<br />
not be changed and certainly they will not be changed by this<br />
unacceptable behaviour of an extreme element of the Left in<br />
Victoria. Now they've got to make up their mind. They either<br />
realise that this decision is there and it's going to stay and<br />
live with it, or they should reconcile themselves to the fact<br />
that this Party is not for them.<br />
BEUTLER: So if they keep up their attacks on the-Party you'll<br />
PM: * Now don't go putting words into my mouth. I think I've<br />
made my position quite clear. The, ba'll,. is in their court as<br />
to. how they behave themselves.<br />
BEUTLER: Mr Hawke when you spoke yesterday of Australians<br />
livifig beyond their means, you sounded very much like Malcolm<br />
Fraser. If you accuse him of not living up to his rhetoric,<br />
why can we be sure that you will deliver.<br />
PM: Well, there's a big difference you see. You had seven<br />
years to watch Malcolm Fraser in office and you saw him preside<br />
over a disaster where he could talk, and not all that he said<br />
made sense, but where some of things did make sense he didn't<br />
match them with action. Against that seven years which led<br />
to disaster, seven years which produced 340,000 new jobs, you've<br />
seen us in office for two years producing the same increase in<br />
jobs in 23 months that took him 88 months to do. You've seen him<br />
lead Australia down into recession, you've seen us lead it out<br />
of recession into very strong economic growth. And, of course, </p>
<p>the other thing is what I talked about before. He believed<br />
that you could govern by the principles of confrontation. I<br />
rejected those when in Opposition and asked the people of<br />
Australia to believe that the policies of co-operation and<br />
consultation were better. Now two years of that have produced<br />
the record. They have produced record growth in employment,<br />
record economic growth, they have produced the lowest level<br />
of industrial disputation for seventeen years and it's halved<br />
the inflation rate. So there's the answer to your question.<br />
Look at the record. Look at the results.<br />
BEUTLER: How much tougher are you finding the job of being<br />
Prime Minister now.<br />
PM: Oh, I'm not finding it any tougher. I mean the hours<br />
are abominable and it means that you get a little bit more<br />
susceptible to the flu. I've had the flu for two or three<br />
weeks now which is a damn nusciance, I'm just getting on top<br />
of it. So there's that physical pressure, but I don't find<br />
it tough in any other way, I enjoy it, I love the challenge.<br />
BEUTLER: You're still enjoying the job.<br />
PM: Yes I am indeed.<br />
GOWARD: Mr Hawke, industrial relations is al-ways going to be<br />
the fear of the international investor about the Australian<br />
economy. If you look at industrial relations in'Queensland, say,<br />
your Industrial Relations Minister, believes there's a danger that<br />
that type of Sir Joh legislation there could spread. Now the<br />
international investor might actually Welcome that but I wonder<br />
if the threat of that type of legislation is a convenient stick<br />
for both you and the business community to beat -the trade union<br />
with this year every time it sticks up its head..<br />
PM: No, I don't use that sort of approach. And you talk about<br />
the international investor. If you attribute any degree of<br />
rationality to the international investor, he's going to say<br />
let's look at what's happened in Australia. We had seven years<br />
of the non-Labor alternative and what we had was continuous<br />
disruption, high levels of industrial disputes, continual<br />
confrontation. What have we had under two years of Labor<br />
a dramatic reduction in industrial disputation there's a point<br />
where I repeat where we've had the lowest level of industrial<br />
disputes for seventeen years. Now if he's got rationality, the<br />
international inveptor is going to say, if I could coin a phrase,<br />
goodness gracious me, that's a much better situation and he's<br />
right. Now I've said before and I say it again, the situation<br />
in Queensland will not be resolved by these processes of<br />
confrontation. Ultimately, and I hope sooner rather than<br />
later, the Premier will realise that there has to be discussion<br />
and negotiation. I have said quite clearly, I repeat it again<br />
on this program, there's not right all on one side in Queensland<br />
or all wrong. You've got to have a situation in essential </p>
<p>7.<br />
industries where the people are entitled to expect if they<br />
are going to get continuity of supply. The point is that in<br />
Queensland that can be achieved by the process of sitting down<br />
and negotiation, hammering out a settlement of disputes<br />
procedure which I believe will be honoured by the unions and<br />
I am prepared to play my part in bringing about that situation<br />
and * so is the ACTU. If we do that we can get what the people<br />
of Queensland want and need that is continuity of supplies<br />
in the electricity industry and we can also have a situation<br />
which I believe the great majority of Queenslanders and Australians<br />
want, and that is where we remain a country in which we don't<br />
have the legislation of the dictatorships of communism or of<br />
the extreme right. It's only in countries like that, where<br />
you have the sort of legislation which Sir Joh has brought in.<br />
Look, what does Sir Joh, what do people in Australia say about<br />
Poland. When you had a situation there in a communist country<br />
where you had Solidarity arising and saying free men and women<br />
ought to have the right to withdraw their labour, everyone around<br />
Australia, including Sir Joh, recognised that clarion call and<br />
said of course there are basic human freedoms which should<br />
exist irrespective of political systems. Now this is mass<br />
hypocrisy. We recognise it in Poland. We applaud those who<br />
fight for it but we allow in Queensland a situation where<br />
the opposite is done.<br />
GOWARD: Just quickly, Mr Hawke, the new economic realities,<br />
dyou believe that they make reshaping the Accord later in<br />
the year necessary.<br />
PM: Oh no, we've been quite relaxed about the way we discussed<br />
this.* The Accord has worked very well and that's universally<br />
recognised. It allows for discussion between Government and<br />
the trade u~ nions-as to what may need . t64 be Idone in emerging<br />
economic circumstances and that provision wil~ l be applied.<br />
ENDS. </p>
