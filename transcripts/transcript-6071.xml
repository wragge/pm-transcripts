FOR MEDIA 30th March 1983<br />
Regulations will be introduced under the National Parks and<br />
Wildlife Conservation Act to halt further work on the Gordon<br />
below Franklin dam.<br />
The Federal Government has taken this step only after repeated<br />
requests to the Tasmanian Premier for negotiations and<br />
discussions were rejected.<br />
The Government is still ready to negotiate a settlement of<br />
this issue that acknowledges the legitimate interests of<br />
Tasmanians in ensuring adequate future energy needs and the<br />
protection and generation of employment.<br />
I am prepared to talk with Mr Gray in Tasmania on Wednesday<br />
April 6 about alternative employment proposals and to<br />
establish procedures to protect those immediately affected<br />
by a halt to work on the dam.<br />
This offer, naturally, depends on the cessation of construction<br />
and associated works.<br />
The regulations, known as the World Heritage ( Western<br />
Tasmania Wilderness) Regulations will come into force as soon<br />
as they are gazetted.<br />
The regulations are being made to enable Australia to give<br />
effect, to its obligations under the World Heritage Convention<br />
following the nomination of the Western Tasmania Wilderness<br />
National Parks, at the request of Tasmania, for inclusion<br />
in the World Heritage List.<br />
The area has now been listed.<br />
The regulations will apply to the Dam construction area and<br />
any activity likely adversely to affect the area's cultural<br />
and natural heritage. </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER CANBERRA<br />
The Hon. Robin Gray, MHA<br />
Premier of Tasmania<br />
HOBAR~ T TAS 7000<br />
My dear Premier<br />
My letters of 28 March 1983 and 13 March 1983 have offered<br />
the preferred course of action to resol. ve the divisions that<br />
exist in your State over the Gordon below Franklin Darn.<br />
You have rejected both endeavours to negotiate a settlement.<br />
Further, you appear not to have understood the essence of<br />
our offer.<br />
Put simply, it is:<br />
We have stated repeatedly we will assist in developinq<br />
alternatives which guarantee your energy supplies to<br />
cover both the present and future needs.<br />
We are not opposed to the development of hydroelectricity<br />
to meet Tasmania's future energy needs.<br />
We are opposed to the Gordon below Franklin Dam.<br />
We have made it clear we will assist those directly<br />
affected by stopping work on the dam and in the<br />
transfer of employment from that site to other<br />
projects. We are committed to achieving equivalent employment<br />
opportunities for those working on the current<br />
project. Further, we will assist in developing a long-term<br />
economic package for the benefit of all Tasnianians.<br />
We acknowledge and accept our responsibility to do<br />
all possible for those currently unemployed within<br />
your State.<br />
Finally, we have many times stated our commitment to<br />
healing the divisions in our society. This issue<br />
clearly divides Tasmania. / 12<br />
r" </p>
<p>The issue will not disappear, nor will the conflict and<br />
divisions unless a negotiated settlement is reached<br />
which is broadly based, generally acceptable and<br />
preserves the areas affected by the World Heritage Area.<br />
We have done all possible to protect the workforce in<br />
Tasmania and we will continue to do so. Your rejection<br />
of our offer to negotiate leaves us with the only<br />
available alternative.<br />
Regulations will be gazetted under the National Parks<br />
and Wildlife Conservation Act 1975. The regulations apply<br />
to the dam area and prohibit further work on the construction<br />
of the dam site and associated works.<br />
The regulations will come into force immediately they<br />
are gazetted. I have arranged for copies to be made<br />
available to your Office as soon as possible.<br />
We have taken this course of action with great reluctance.<br />
Your refusal to negotiate left us no choice, and if that<br />
attitude is maintained you will through your actions begin<br />
to affect the employment of the Tasmanians about whom you<br />
express concern.<br />
Whether you refuse to acknowledge it or not, the issue<br />
is one which extends well beyond the boundaries of Tasmania.<br />
It is one about which many people feel strongly. It is one<br />
which is clearly divisive within your own community.<br />
I remind you of your own commitment during the State<br />
Election Campaign, which was to set about healing divisions<br />
in Tasmanian society.<br />
With the greatest respect, you have not succeeded. Nor<br />
will you unless you agree to sit down with the Commonwealth<br />
Government and begin to negotiate a settlement which can<br />
maintain all of the major objectives of both your<br />
Government and mine, including preserving the integrity of<br />
the World Hetitage area.<br />
I am prepared to meet with you in Hobart on Wednesday, 6 April<br />
to negotiate on matters already raised in previous<br />
correspondence and to establish the processes required to<br />
protect those immediately affected by the gazettal of the<br />
abovementioned regulations. / 3 </p>
<p>3.<br />
F in ally the offe r to Tree t on Wed ne-, sd ay 6 Apr~. depends<br />
on the~ cessation of construction oil the damn site<br />
and associated works.<br />
Yours sincerely Hawke) </p>
