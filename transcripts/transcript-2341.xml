FOR PRESS: PM No. 123/ 1970<br />
PM'S MESSAGE TO UN', SECRETARY-GENERAL<br />
The Prime Minister, Mr. John Gorton, tonight sent<br />
the following message to the Secretary-General of the United Nations<br />
" The Australian Government fully understands the concern<br />
of the Government of Israel at the circumstances in which death<br />
sentences were recently passed on two Soviet citizens of the Jewish<br />
Race. It is alleged that an attempt was to be made to hi-jack an<br />
aeroplane and no-one would wish to condone such an offence.<br />
But it is disquieting that the trial itself was held in<br />
camera and was not open to observers so that world opinion<br />
could judge of its fairness and of the facts of the case.<br />
it is also disquieting to note that if people of the Jewish<br />
Race were permitted freely to emigrate from the Soviet, in<br />
accordance with the principles of the United Nations, tihis<br />
incident would never have occurred.<br />
I note from press reports that the International Commission<br />
of jurists has expressed concern over the severity of the sentences<br />
and the lack of official -i-iformation regarding the trial.<br />
There is a clear need for all the facts of the case-to be<br />
established for the world to see and we hope that this will be<br />
recognised by the authorities of the Soviet Union and that such<br />
severe punishment of what appearf! to have been an attempt<br />
at escape will not proceed.<br />
