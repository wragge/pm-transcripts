TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P. J. KEATING MP,<br />
ADDRESS AT OPENING OF THE FINANCE SECTOR UNION OFFICES, 230<br />
EL. IZABETH STREET, SYDNEY, FRIDAY 23 JULY 1993<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF ONLY<br />
Thank you very much Keith ( Westgarth), Kevin ( Davern) and Len ( Hingley), I see<br />
the President of the Labor Party here Terry Sheehan and ladies and gentlemen.<br />
It is a great pleasure for me to could I say Keith, to be here on this occasion and<br />
I can ass * ure you I was elated in March as well. I am quite sure that we would not<br />
be opening any union offices had we not won the election, we would be closing<br />
them and that the savage right wing Thatcherite agenda of our opponents would<br />
now be in full swing. They would be having a beano, working out each bit of<br />
draconian law they could have put into place and how they would hop into<br />
ordinary people and in their defeat they are getting all pious about the<br />
soundness of their policies and the rest. Well, that is all right, let them, I don't<br />
care. The fact of the matter is they would have been into ordinary people, they<br />
would have hopped right into ordinary people in a way we have never seen<br />
because when they had a chance in this last period, the government had been in<br />
office ten years, to put a policy coming from a recession with the government<br />
facing the economic and social difficulties of the recession, where they thought<br />
they were a chance of winning, did they have a balanced approach to life looking<br />
at all the elements of Australian society? Not on your life. They were going to<br />
get in there and grab the national income and give it to the high income people,<br />
rip Medicare apart, rip the social wage apart and hop into wage and salary<br />
earners, put a GST on their back and give the tax cuts to business.<br />
So, there would have been the personal tax cuts they promised, you could have<br />
forgotten those, you would never have seen them because to have been funded<br />
they would have had to cut $ 10,000 million out of the public sector of Australia,<br />
out of the social wage, the social and education programs of the Commonwealth.<br />
As a public sector manager of ten years standing I can say definitively, I actually<br />
know more about this subject than anyone else in the country because I have<br />
presided over sixteen reviews of the Budget, you can not cut $ 10,000 million out<br />
of the Commonwealth budget without hurting a lot of people particularly the<br />
aged, the young, women, the sick and the infirm, these are the places where they<br />
would have had to cut and of course, public opinion would have come down<br />
against them. It would have been a consumption tax and nothing else but that,<br />
I I </p>
<p>2<br />
but more than that the thing they really wanted to get at was trade unionism.<br />
They hate the fact that people have a right to organise and-bargain for their<br />
incomes. I don't know why it is because the people who run the Liberal party,<br />
they are only basically wage plugs themselves and only one I remember was<br />
born with silver spoon in his mouth or two maybe, in one case a ladle, but the<br />
rest of them are dead ordinary. Why they want to hop into ordinary people has<br />
got me beat, but they do. They would have been right into it, they would have<br />
been ripping away at the structure of unionism and you saw Jeff Kennett at it in<br />
Victoria, I am pleased to say when we extended federal award coverage in<br />
Victoria the great body of Victorian unionists have now registered themselves<br />
under federal awards and so sense will prevail.<br />
All of this at a time when the best things were happening in the labour market,<br />
the best things in our industrial history. At a time when a union like this was<br />
amalgamating and becoming a focussed, central force in the financial industries<br />
of this country, where a union like this had lead the way, one of the leaders in<br />
enterprise bargaining with really innovative changes in the nature of those<br />
bargains especially for women, the majority of whom make up your membership,<br />
where you are looking at improvements in productivity and then spreading those<br />
improvements back to the workforce and to profits, it is the very essence of cooperation<br />
and decency at the workplace and of course, underpinned by the<br />
Labor governments policy of a safety net for those on low income.<br />
What is the point of objection to such a policy? Keith made the point earlier<br />
about the number of offices around the country you were five unions and you<br />
are now one and you may soon be six unions as one. Isn't trade unionism<br />
therefore running in a totally responsible direction? We have got an inflation<br />
rate which until recently was the lowest in the OECD, the lowest in the world and<br />
it is now just a decimal point or so away from that. Can anybody suggest that the<br />
trade union movement is rampant with an inflation rate of that variety, of that<br />
dimenstion? What in God's name made the Liberals so snakey on Australian<br />
trade unions and Australian working people? I don't know, but there is no doubt<br />
they want to expunge any sense of organisation at the workplace away and of<br />
course, the great spoof in their policy was they said they would have enterprise<br />
bargaining, but enterprise bargaining is as you know all of you banding<br />
together, talking to the managers, the owners saying can we reach an agreement<br />
and getting a good commitment, shared commitments which produce a sense of<br />
esprit de corp and comradeship in the organisations that you work in and make<br />
the businesses better.<br />
But that -is not what they wanted. They wanted individual wage contracts, so you<br />
got singled out and separated off and the employers dealt with you individually<br />
and then that was sold as an enterprise bargain. It was never an enterprise<br />
bargain. In contrast we have got enterprise bargaining and we are setting the trade union<br />
movement up with enterprise bargaining and we are setting it up in my view to be<br />
a much stronger body, a much stronger set of institutions in Australia than they<br />
would have otherwise been. In the 1980s when we needed aggregate wage </p>
<p>3<br />
flexibility, under the various Accords and tax cut arrangements where we had<br />
wages as a proportion of GDP falling, where we had to get the profit share up to<br />
re-start Australian investment after the 1981-83 recession, we had the aggregate<br />
flexibility, but what we are seeing now is flexibility within sectors. The important<br />
thing is that if we still have a centralised system as inflexible as we had In the<br />
1980s, if we didn't have enterprise bargaining as we established in Accord Mark<br />
VI and a Coalition government as it had come along, it would have gone for the<br />
jugular of the centralised system and the organs of Australian trade unionism<br />
would have been out of condition, that is not developing an organic system of<br />
bargaining, it would have been out of condition and less able to resist that kind of<br />
an attack. Whereas now we have moved away from the centralised system to<br />
enterprise bargaining, where unions are slimmed down, where their<br />
management, where amalgamations are congruous, where there are a set of<br />
common purposes amongst people in similar sectors of an industry, where we<br />
have seen appropriate amalgamations. Unions are now much better set up not<br />
only to do a better job for their members and the businesses which employ them,<br />
but they are going to be stronger, better exercised limbs and sinews of unionism<br />
to resist the kind of crude attack that you have seen attempted by the likes of<br />
Hewson, Howard et al.<br />
This structure is a much healthier one for the economy and for unionism and it<br />
also protects trade unions from the right wing predators who hang around our<br />
political system. These are important things and trade unionism has been<br />
through the ACTU and the great body of unionists in this country in the last ten<br />
years at the leading edge of changing the Australian economy into a modem,<br />
productive externally oriented economy with a low inflation rate. Not having to<br />
be dragged along, right up the front and in terms of productivity and bargaining;<br />
before Accord Mark VI the notion in this country was if you want to make a<br />
business more profitable you cut wages. What the trade unions said was there<br />
is something much smarter to do than that, we can make the business more<br />
productive, you don't have to cut wages, we can do more to make the business<br />
more productive together and that is why things like you have negotiated, with<br />
flexible working hours, with cycles up to 300 hours over eight weeks, job sharing,<br />
home based work, career break opportunities, part time employment and now<br />
you are looking at agreements involving Saturday trading, training, team based<br />
performance pay, all of those things are typical of the kind of innovative and<br />
ambitious flexibility that one can get in a co-operative structure.<br />
If you look around our part of the world, in Japan particularly, in Korea and all<br />
sorts of other countries you see the models of co-operation as the places where<br />
people want to do something better with their business and themselves as a way<br />
of making the thing function better and providing higher real income. Not by<br />
cowering people, the straitening, cowering thing, get everyone's eyes down,<br />
threaten them, split them off onto individual contracts if they play up, get rid of<br />
them. This punishing approach which the Liberals have always had. You would<br />
think if they just look around business in the region we live in they would see just<br />
how that sort of British model of employer/ employee relationships is just not<br />
appropriate to Australia any more and why we are much better off doing what we<br />
are doing. </p>
<p>We have now got one thousand enterprise agreements which have been<br />
agreed. One thousand, which is a very encouraging number and they are<br />
growing all the time. We have got the lowest level of industrial disputes for<br />
decades and part of that is the fact that the Government does sit down<br />
under an Accord with the trade unions to work out a structure. Now, we sat<br />
down before the election with Accord Mark VII, your officers were, there<br />
and we agreed to a safety net. We are now asking the Commission to<br />
endorse Accord Mark VII which provides for three updates of the safety net<br />
over the next three years which will then underpin the enterprise<br />
bargaining structure which will see most decisions in the workforce being<br />
taken. In the course of that we made clear that the Government would support<br />
those safety net arrangements, that we would also look at a legislative<br />
package to bring our laws and institutions into alignment with a system of<br />
national enterprise bargains so we actually change the' system to<br />
accommodate the new thing and of course, in that we talked about, as we<br />
did right through the 1 980s, the backdrop of a decent tax system behind it.<br />
Since 1983 we have had effectively a policy of de facto tax indexation, that<br />
is, in the period up to 1991 we had handed back in tax cuts more than tax<br />
indexation and I made clear with Peter Cook when we sat down to do<br />
Accord Mark VI1 that tax cuts would form again an Important backdrop to<br />
Accord Mark VII.<br />
What I announced yesterday is that those tax cuts will be paid, and not<br />
only paid in full $ 3.4 billion in 1994-95, but they will actually be brought<br />
forward into this financial year. This will be a significant tax cut for people<br />
from two thirds of average weekly earnings up. From $ 20,000 and<br />
onwards. The group who in the 1 980s didn't get above the weight of the<br />
tax cuts which formerly went under $ 20,000 and beyond about $ 45,000.<br />
So, it is their turn and their time and we have been looking therefore to do<br />
that. In the 1 980s we supported the low paid with things which the ACTU was<br />
engaged such as the Family Allowance Supplement was dramatically less<br />
the income of a low income family and made the tax cuts, most of our tax<br />
cuts focussed on the bottom end. When I became Treasurer in 1983 the<br />
bottom rate of tax was $ 30,000 it is now $ 20,000. The tax free threshold<br />
has risen so in that area we focussed our tax attention first. We are now<br />
focussing it in that area from two thirds of average weekly earnings and<br />
beyond. That is why yesterday's commitment to see those tax cuts paid in<br />
full next financial year and brought forward earlier to this year is important<br />
for that backdrop in the labour market where people because of the<br />
slowness of the economy are seeing it has taken time to get wage<br />
increases through the system and we will put the second tranche back into<br />
1998, probably 1998, so that we are doing what we intended to do and<br />
said we would do in February 1992 in ' One Nation' to say that basically the<br />
tax cuts would be paid for by fiscal drag in the system. </p>
<p>Because Of a much better and lower inflation performance we were going<br />
to be paying much more than such fiscal drag, but pushing the second<br />
round out means we return to pay that which we intended. The tax cuts will<br />
be delivered, they will be delivered in an economically responsible way<br />
and I should have thought given the fact the economy has been in the last<br />
couple of years slower than we had hoped and thought, in doing that we<br />
have met the economic imperative of the savings problem in the middle of<br />
the 1990s by bringing the Budget deficit back to around 1 per cent of GDP.<br />
I noticed in some of the newspapers this morning some comments, you<br />
would swear blind the tax cuts were abolished, much less being paid in full,<br />
and some are actually saying this was a central plank of the election, the<br />
election was decided upon it. It is just not true. The tax cuts hardly rated a<br />
mention in the election campaign. They were there as a backdrop to it<br />
from both the parties, but the election was fought about things that I<br />
mentioned a moment ago. About the way Australians live and relate to one<br />
another, the kind of society we want whether it is going to be survival of the<br />
fittest, or a society which is broader and kinder and nicer, where we do<br />
care about one another and things like access and equity in health, in<br />
education and these things matter. That was what the election was<br />
decided on and appropriately decided upon.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen could I say that I regard the Finance Sector Union<br />
as a model of what is happening in Australian trade unionism. It is growing<br />
in an area of an internationally traded service which is financial services.<br />
Deregulation of the financial system has had a big shake out in the<br />
banking system in particular, but will now lead to a very productive banking<br />
sector, one which I hope is more closely attuned to the needs of the<br />
economy with productive investment into the future. We are seeing the<br />
growth of the superannuation industry through the Government's policies,<br />
and the growth of the whole sector in financial services, banking and<br />
superannuation and insurance is a growth area for the economy, it is<br />
growth of an industry which wouldn't have had the growth possibilities it<br />
now has but for deregulation. And this group of unions has been always<br />
part of that process from the early 1 980s onwards, now coalescing as a<br />
single group to better represent your members and also to make certain<br />
that the organisations and businesses you work for are efficient and<br />
productive ones.<br />
If one has to stand back and say, here is a sector, in many respects a new<br />
one, an internationally traded service, one which has got great prospects<br />
both at home and in the region and what is Australian unionism doing with<br />
this sector and the answer Is developing the appropriate structures to<br />
make the sector better, giving employees within the sector the flexibility<br />
that they need particularly women in the innovative enterprise agreements,<br />
taking enterprise agreements forward and changing the wage system as<br />
we must do in a modern, flexible economy. </p>
<p>Thank you. 6<br />
I am delighted to be here, thank you Keith ( Westgarth), Kevin ( Davem) and<br />
Len ( Hingley) for inviting me. Thank you, all of you, for having me along.<br />
It is a pleasure to open a union office, a greater pleasure even to open one<br />
which has got its act together which is developing appropriate, rational and<br />
good structures which is operating for good purposes and of course, it just<br />
speaks volumes about the difference between them the Liberals and we<br />
of the community, we of the Labor party, we of the trade union movement.<br />
We stand for good, decent values, the right of organisation in the<br />
workplace, the right to see a good productive industry, what better thing<br />
could one be able to say at the opening of the headquarters of such an<br />
organisation. So, congratulations, it is a great pleasure to be here and to<br />
be declaring these premises of yours officially open. </p>
