ADDRESS BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP,<br />
OPENING OF BUILDING 8 RMIT, MELBOURNE, WEDNESDAY, 5 JULY<br />
1995<br />
Thank you for the opportunity to be here today at RMIT to open Building 8.<br />
It Is an extraordinary building.<br />
It's conceivable that some people might hate It: but I think it suits the<br />
environment and I'm persuaded that It definitely suits its educational and<br />
cultural purposes.<br />
It's slightly mad, but so are the city baths up the road.<br />
It's bright and this part of Melbourne needs It and It kisses goodbye to both<br />
the modem hideous glass towers and Victorian heaviness and hang-ups.<br />
I like It and I congratulate Peter Corrigan and Maggie Edmond.<br />
I hope they will come up to Sydney some time.<br />
Our cities always need a bit of cross-fertilization.<br />
I also must pay tribute to two other people: Ruth Duncan, the Director of<br />
Physical Planning and Construction; and your Vice Chancellor, David<br />
Beaniand who recognised that Edmond and Corulgan's building might be just<br />
the flagship RMIT needed: an Image of optimism and change; an Image of<br />
Australia In the 21 st century.<br />
And I gather that already it Is effectively conveying that message In Asia and<br />
Europe. We have seen an outdated building transformed into a significant contribution<br />
to Australian architecture and education.<br />
Old facilities have been improved and modernised to include state of the art<br />
educational technology. </p>
<p>2<br />
What we have now is a bold and challenging building which serves as an<br />
outstanding educational resource and statement about the direction of<br />
Australian culture.<br />
And the direction of RMIT It will be the flagship of the Institution, connecting<br />
It with the city, a focus arnd a resource for its activities, an expression of its<br />
perspective on the future.<br />
This building can also be seen as a symbol of the dramatic changes that have<br />
occurred In education and training over the past decade,<br />
RMIT is proof of the potential which exists when the two essential elements of<br />
tertiary education, TAFE and universities, are linked.<br />
Since the education reforms In 1988. Australian post-compulsory education<br />
has undergone extraordinary changes and expansion.<br />
The previous separation of TAFE and higher education, which restricted the<br />
access of the less advantaged to many forms of skills development, is now<br />
being broken down.<br />
It is becoming recognised that the distinctions between vocational and<br />
academic education are essentially arbitrary and accidents of history and<br />
Inertia. We have massively expanded the Australian higher education system it<br />
now enrols more than 30 per cent of all 17 to 22 year olds.<br />
Participation In formal education and training by people aged 15-24 has<br />
increased from around 44 per cent In 1985 to around 53 per cent in 1992.<br />
Commonwealth funding available to higher education has risen from $ 3 billion<br />
in 1983 to $ 4.8 billion In 1995 an increase of almost 61 per cent.<br />
It is of great Importance to reflect on the circumstances which have enabled<br />
the higher education system to expand so rapidly In recent times, and worth<br />
noting how substantial the growth has been.<br />
Since the reforms of 1989, manifested In part in the considerable<br />
developments at RMIT, there has been a 40 per cent Increase in the number<br />
of Austiralian higher education students.<br />
The reason this has been possible is to be found in a four letter word which<br />
appears In no dictionary: HECS.<br />
Revenue from the Higher Education Contribution Scheme over the last<br />
years has been used only to enable the system to grow. </p>
<p>This has meant that up to one out of every three students today would not<br />
otherwise be here.<br />
The students demonstrating about higher education charging policy might ask<br />
themselves If It is reasonable to protest against such an extraordinary<br />
expansion in higher education?<br />
It does seem fair to hav~ e former students pay around 23 per cent of<br />
taxpayers' subsidy, If and only when they reach average earnings?<br />
And it is worth noting that this Australian approach, a world first, is now being<br />
copied In many other countries the US, New Zealand, the Czech Republic,<br />
Canada and Botswana, for example.<br />
Dare I suggest to the demonstrating students that It was our Opponents in the<br />
last election supported the Introduction of full up-front undergraduate fees.<br />
HECS is only one of many innovations we have embraced.<br />
The Government is in the process of redefining education and training to<br />
reflect new forms of working and learning.<br />
We are not livng In a static environment.<br />
Types of work, the way we work, the way we learn and the ways we teach,<br />
and what we learn and teach, are all changing.<br />
We need to be flexible and adaptive, innovative and much over-used<br />
though the word Is competitive.<br />
Education and training are the bridges which will enable individuals to cross<br />
over from obsolete skills to skills of the future; from poorly paid employment<br />
to well-paid; from unemployment to work.<br />
It will enable people to get Jobs and hold on to them, as training and retraining<br />
become career-long experiences for all workers.<br />
If it is a bridge for Individuals, it is also a bridge for Australia itself from the<br />
to the 21 st century.<br />
Of course, it is not enough to create new buildings what happens inside<br />
those buildings must also be innovative and dynamic.<br />
I know RMIT Is well placed to meet this challenge.<br />
It stands out as an Institution of character. </p>
<p>4<br />
With higher education and vocational education combined In one institution,<br />
RMIT embodies the great change in modem education that is, the old<br />
divisions between school, vocational education and higher education no<br />
longer apply.<br />
I have been told that RM IT aims for practicality, excellence, relevance and<br />
responsiveness seeking ways to continually Improve its organisational<br />
design in pursuit of its educational objectives and welcome people from a<br />
wide range of cultural, social and educational backgrounds.<br />
The RMIT Mission Statement specifically Identifies the need to be at the<br />
forefront of technical and professional education of the kind which develops<br />
people for employment and focuses on research programs that address real<br />
world Issues.<br />
They tell me that RMIT Is also relentless In its efforts to ensure that it keeps<br />
pace with technological change.<br />
This all sounds very good to me and It will be even better if RMIT never<br />
loses sight of the fact that Its first responsibility its most fundamental<br />
responsibility Is to teach students well.<br />
The issue does not go away with the new technology.<br />
Australians have shown a remarkable capacity to embrace new technology.<br />
More than 40 per cent of Australian households have their own personal<br />
computers, second in the world only to the United States.<br />
Australians also have one of the highest per-capita rates of use of Internet in<br />
the world.<br />
And there Is no doubt that the university and research community has led the<br />
nation In the development of computer networks.<br />
But, as I said when I launched the report of the Broadband Services Expert<br />
Group earlier this year, the Information -society is not just about acquiring the<br />
new technology.<br />
It Is about how we choose to use technology to take us to a more democratic<br />
and equitable society and a more knowledgeable and creative one.<br />
The great challenge is to make sure that the new communications<br />
technologies enrich and strengthen us.<br />
Nowhere Is the impact of informabon technology, particularly multimedia and<br />
networks, going to be greater than in the field of education. </p>
<p>Education must keep up.<br />
Education must prepare young Australians for life in an Information society.<br />
This will require Imagination from our educators and planners In the<br />
development of curricula and the provision of Infrastructure.<br />
Building 8 houses some fine examples of how educational Institutions can<br />
embrace the technology.<br />
The RMIT Library is linked into world wide electronic Information networks.<br />
Students of fashion and textile design learn with the aid of a computer<br />
laboratory and specialist machine workrooms.<br />
State-of-the-art educational technology is a feature of the teaching methods<br />
used In the Bachelor of Applied Science in Mathematics, and in teaching<br />
Engineering, Applied Science and many other subjects.<br />
The computer laboratories on Level 9 of this building are some of the busiest<br />
teaching areas at RMIT.<br />
And RMmrs Department of VisuaJ Communications Is offering Diploma and<br />
Masters courses in Interactive Multimedia and Animation.<br />
The Government has taken a particular Interest in new communications<br />
technologies. We recognise the challenge: if we let it, the technology can be<br />
dehumanising, alienating, and counterproductive to our educational purposes;<br />
but if we are clever we can use It to strengthen the bonds between us,<br />
deepen the pool of our collective knowledge and raise our level of mutual<br />
understanding. We must pursue policies which ensure that existing injustices are not<br />
Intensified by unequal access to knowledge.<br />
And we must not fall Into the trap of thinking thtat the technology will ever be a<br />
substitute for thinking, writing, knowing, working, deciding and doing.<br />
We have been making great progress.<br />
In April. I announced that the Government would develop and Implement a<br />
national strategy for information services and technologies.<br />
The strategy Is being coordinated through a whole-of-government approach<br />
particularly in the formation of national policy and the Government's own<br />
use of technologies. </p>
<p>Two weeks ago I announced the membership of the National Information<br />
Services Council a high level discussion group to provide the Government<br />
with a range of views on marketplace developments, technical Issues and<br />
community views on the opportunities and challenges that the evolving<br />
services and technologies will present.<br />
I am delighted that Professor Beanland has agreed to serve as one of the<br />
members of the Council.<br />
Mnother aspect of the strategy is the establishment of a national education<br />
network.<br />
Through agreement between the Commonwealth Government and the States<br />
and Territories, Education Network Australia, or EdNA, has been launched by<br />
the Minister for Employment, Education and Training.<br />
EdNA will:<br />
encompass all sectors of education including schools, vocational<br />
education and training, and higher education;<br />
equip students and their teachers to participate effectively in the<br />
Information society, regardless of location or soclo-economic status;<br />
deliver educational services and products across the nation;<br />
provide an overarching framework for the vast array of cooperative<br />
smaller scale projects throughout Australia; and<br />
ensure that governments work tpgether to achieve the best and most cost<br />
effective outcomes for our education system.<br />
A further component of the National Strategy was unveiled last week by the<br />
Minister for Social Security.<br />
Aimed at bridging the gap between the ' information rich' and " information<br />
poor' In Australia, the Community Information Network has been established<br />
to provide free access to government and community Information and<br />
communication facilities and services.<br />
Initially, this access is being provided through 100 Local Access Points<br />
situated In DSS offices, libraries and community organIsatlons.<br />
The Government aims to rapidly increase the number of access points over<br />
coming months. </p>
<p>7<br />
Another area where the government has been very active is In the<br />
development of multimedia.<br />
Multimedia's combination of text, pictures, sound and static and moving<br />
Images takes Information technology into another realm, offering unique<br />
Interactive learning arnd cultural experiences.<br />
We believe Australia has a real opportunity to develop a world competitive<br />
multimedia Industry, particularly in the provision of content.<br />
Fortunately, we have in place many of the necessary ingredients In our<br />
creative people, our technical expertise, our well established film and<br />
television industry and educational institutions like RMIT.<br />
The development of an Australian multimedia industry was one of the aims of<br />
the Government's 1994 Cultural Policy Statement, Creatve Nation.<br />
The Australian Multimedia Enterprise has been established and will now<br />
oversee the development of multimedia projects with the assistance of<br />
million provided by the Commonwealth,<br />
I am aware that RMIT Is working on the establishment of an Interactive<br />
Information Institute a research facility dedicated to applied research into<br />
the multimedia and telecommunications Industries.<br />
This proposal is typical of the sort of interaction the government is trying to<br />
encourage where the best creative minds of our universities are combined<br />
with the investment power and market knowledge of the private sector.<br />
And let me say that I am delighted RMIT is playing such a prominent part in<br />
the process.<br />
I am delighted specifically because it is a significant element in RMIT's<br />
Involvement In developing this northern end of Melbourne as an educational<br />
precinct. Historically, of course that Is what It has been a sort of knowledge precinct<br />
and RMI's development will revive the tradition for the 21 st century.<br />
It Is therefore good for Melbourne, and while I am from Sydney and for all Its<br />
warts and what they've done to It, love the place I am also seriously<br />
enamoured of Melbourne.<br />
If my words aren't enough, know me by my deeds.<br />
In Creative Nation we put the International Music Academy here, an arm of<br />
the Australia Council, the Foundation for Australian Cultural Development, the </p>
<p>8<br />
Special Television Production Fund, and we put half a million into the MVSO<br />
with the message divest from the ABC if you want to.<br />
Not everyone in Melbourne noticed all these things, but everyone in Sydney<br />
did. To me there are unmistakable signs that Melbourne Is on the rise again.<br />
It is going to end -this century and enter the next one very strong culturally and<br />
economically.<br />
This development will play a profound part In the process all the more so If<br />
you can make something elegant out of the old CUB site up there.<br />
Thank you for having me here today.<br />
