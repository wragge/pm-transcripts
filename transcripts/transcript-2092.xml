LIBERAL WOMEN'S RALLY<br />
BRISBANE, Qld. JULY 1969<br />
Speech by the Prime Minister, Mr. John Gorton<br />
I never have looked up the number of women on the rolls<br />
throughout the Commonwealth of Australia In the way your President has,<br />
but I did just happen to discover that on the Queensland rolls, as distinct<br />
from the Commonwealth rolls, there are 15, 000 more women than men.<br />
So our minds must have been working in the same direction, Madam<br />
President. We were both looking to the strength. And indeed we were<br />
looking to the strength, at least as far as a political organisation is<br />
concerned. It is the strength that comes from the behind-the-scenes<br />
work of the Women's Section, from the running of the branches, from the<br />
posting out of literature, the contribution of ideas and from all the tasks<br />
that have to be done in a party or . n a campaign.<br />
Now, it will not be long some months, not long before<br />
we all find ou. rselves in an electoral campaign to discover whether the<br />
people of Australia wish us to continue to give the kind of government that<br />
has tran~ sformed Australia over the last two decades. And it has<br />
transformed Australia. It is a different nation from that of twenty years<br />
ago. You will remember sometimes we tend to forget but you will<br />
remem-ber all the people from so many races in the world who have come<br />
to Australia in that time, been assimilated and brought to us their own<br />
cultures, their own ways of thinking, and infused into the bloodstream of<br />
Australia, giving us a new vigour and a new interest. They have certainly<br />
improved the variety of what we eat and drink twenty years ago steak<br />
and eggs was about the culinary end as far as Australians were concerned:<br />
The population has been built up, the development of the<br />
country has grown in a way it has never done before and, at the same<br />
time, there has been removed from the minds of people generally that<br />
fear of unemployment which was always present two decades, or three<br />
decades ago. They find themselves living now in a country which has, I<br />
think, the lowest rate of unemployment of any nation in the world<br />
though from time to time particular parts may be stricken by particular<br />
pr&amp; blems. And even in the last year or eighteen months, I think we<br />
have given an indication to Australia that we are not merely going to go<br />
ahead without seeking changes and new pastures. While providing that<br />
background of progress, we will seek out new areas to help, new avenues<br />
along which we can advance to the future. / 2 </p>
<p>-2<br />
And begause these things tend sometimes to be overlooked<br />
in the rush of events, let me remind you of some of those new approaches<br />
which in the last year or eighteen months have taken place.<br />
We have, for example, in the field of education, taken<br />
steps to see that every school in Australia is provided through<br />
Commonwealth Government funds without matching requirements from<br />
the States with libraries. So those secondary schools of which I speak<br />
may have not only science teaching facilities but facilities for teaching<br />
the humanities which alone can develop minds able to use science to the<br />
proper ends. We have developed an entirely new approach to the problem<br />
of communications through roads in Australia. And for the first time,<br />
by cost-benefit analysis of various proposals, and by the abandonment of<br />
the requirement that a particular amount of a given sum should be spent<br />
in some particular area by abandoning that, by taking cost-plus<br />
processes, by adding a half billion dollars to the sums of money for the<br />
next five-year period, by setting aside specific amounts of that to try<br />
and overcome the congestion which the urbanisation of Australia is<br />
imposing on its city dwellers, by setting sums aside for new freeways,<br />
for new communications in the city, we have, I think, taken a giant step<br />
in that particular field, and a new step.<br />
We have entered the area of overseas shipping so that<br />
Australia will have a ship operating between Australia and Japan, between<br />
Australia and the United Kingdom and between Australia and the United<br />
States. This is not only to save the invisible costs which the operation of<br />
foreign ships imposes on us, but so that we can have proof that the products<br />
af the land for they are what will mostly fiW the ships are carried at<br />
costs which we know to be fair costs and that our producers are not mulcted.<br />
And this again, I believe, is something a nation, an island nation like<br />
Australia should have done, something which I believe will grow,<br />
something which within this short space of time has been a new initiative.<br />
We have taken decisions which were not easy in the<br />
international climate to our north, where the situation has changed so<br />
significantly. We have taken the decision that we will not be the sheriff<br />
in that region to which we belong, as England was the sheriff or was<br />
claimed to be the sheriff. We cannot fill the role of sheriff nor do we<br />
want to, but we are prepared to play our part in the defence of the region<br />
in which we stand as members of the sheriff's posse and as fairly strong,<br />
relatively strong members of the sheriff's po~ sse. We have decided that<br />
we will have Australian troops visible in the area to our north as evidence<br />
of this approach. These were not easy decisions to take in the light of the<br />
enormously changed circumstances through Brti's withdrawal from our<br />
north, but we have taken them. </p>
<p>-3.<br />
These are some indications of new approaches over the<br />
last eighteen months. And yet now we stand on the threshold of opportunities<br />
such as Australia has not known before and which will give us chances to<br />
take more and more new initiatives. We are on the threshold of the exciting<br />
seventies, those years when the overseas earnings of Australia will grow<br />
and grow as our farm produce grows, as our minerals finally come into<br />
their own and are exported and as I hope, will be fabricated and exported;<br />
on the threshold of years when, if things are properly run, there will be<br />
modernisation of the equipment in our manufacturing industries and more<br />
automation. One man will be able to do the work done now by two, yet<br />
there will be so much work to do, there will not be unemployment, but<br />
rahter a chance of the greater production which is possible if one man does<br />
the work of two and of the greater reward which is possible for each such<br />
man; These are the opportunities that lie before us.<br />
You would expect us, I believe, in these circumstances, to<br />
go in to these exciting seventies with the twin beliefs that we have work to<br />
do at home, development to do at home and we have also a part to play in<br />
the defence of the region in which we live; and that we must do both, or<br />
else there is a possibility we might fail to achieve either. And so you<br />
would, I think, expect us to devote to the development of our own capacity<br />
for defence not a greater percentage of gross national product but certainly<br />
greater rums of money as our gross national product grows. You would<br />
expect us, I think, to look to our alliances, and in particular our alliance<br />
with the United States for defensive purposes. And looking to those<br />
alliances, you would expect us to be prepared to contribute towards a joint<br />
defence and not merely to seek to take and give nothing back.<br />
And you would expect us to see that we kept the rate of<br />
employment as high as it is, that we continued to bring in the record number<br />
of migrants which we are now attracting and that we developed all parts of<br />
this nation as quickly as the manpower resources and the capital resources<br />
would permit. I say " would permit" for there are many things throughout<br />
Australia which today can be pointed to and people can say " This should<br />
be done. It should be done now. It will be economical. It will return<br />
money for the investment that is put into it. It will add to growth". All<br />
these things are true of all t tese projects. And yet with the work force<br />
fully employed, a great accretion of new projects is not immediately<br />
possible. Yet you would expect us to see these things happen, subject to<br />
the limitations of an expanding work force and expanding capital.<br />
I think, and I have been criticised for thinking this, but I<br />
still think it and still propose to express it, that we will need for the<br />
development of this country and the speed at which it should be developed,<br />
great amounts of overseas capital. We cannot generate from within our<br />
own savings enough to do all that lies before us. Yet I also believe that<br />
we can and should require an offer of participation to Australians in these<br />
/ 4 </p>
<p>-4<br />
new developments at the beginning and the key word is " offer"'. There<br />
should be a chance to participate. There should be a chance for Australians<br />
to see their investments grow as their country grows, to be part owners.<br />
This we will make clear I think we have made it clear to the world,<br />
and to those who have money to invest. And I do not believe for one<br />
moment that it will prevent the flow of that overseas capital which we must<br />
have. For Australian participation is not a condition, but the offer to<br />
Australians to participate is a goal which I think we will attain.<br />
I am sure, too, that you would wish us to use some of the<br />
material benefits which will flow from the economic circumstances I see<br />
before us, to ensure that in a way that has not happened before, those<br />
who are at the end of life's race, those who are widowed or ill or handicapped'<br />
in some other way, are helped by the community. And you would want us,<br />
I think, to see that those who help themselves during their life are not<br />
thereby entirely c~ ut off from any additional assistance from the State.<br />
I hope nobody will imagine when I say that that I am talking<br />
about the possibility of abolishing the means test. I am not and it should<br />
not be abolished. There is no reason in the world as far as I see it<br />
why $ 450 million should eventually be spent to provide a pension, for<br />
example, to my wife who will have one anyway, or to other wealthy citizens<br />
of Australia. That money can far better be used in relieving real need.<br />
But there is a need to see that those who have in some way or other given<br />
some provision to themselves are not entirely cut out at the lower levels<br />
from some assistance from the State as well.<br />
These are the things, I think, you would want a government<br />
to do. I would add one other thing. There is a need, I think, to improve<br />
not only the material circumstances of life so that one has two cars, bigger<br />
houses, more refrigerators or better machinery or whatever it might be.<br />
There is also a need to improve the quality of life, a need that will grow<br />
as the leisure time for the population of Australia grows, an opportunity<br />
to do a number of things. An opportunity first to choose the course in life<br />
which most appeals to an individual; to choose and be properly trained,<br />
and to be excited by the chance of being properly trained; to be whatever<br />
an actor, a film producer, a television producer, a plumber, a carpenter,<br />
a scientist, a technologist. And what I would say improved the quality of life would be<br />
if people, young and not so young, were given the opportunity to advance<br />
their minds and exercise their minds. There must be many of you here<br />
today who found, as my own wife found, that you had been married, there<br />
had been a family, the family had grown up and got married, and all those<br />
years that you had put in to raising that family had gone and the family<br />
had gone. And if the quality of life is to be improved, there should be<br />
opportunities for courses of various kinds for those who wish to take them<br />
so that that great reservoir of intelligence, ability and capacity which I </p>
<p>believe lies in the female population should be given a chance for Australia's<br />
sake to be used,_ sbld.' jegven &amp;-chance for the individual's sake to be<br />
used. I could go on for some time but there is not time speaking<br />
of the improvements in the quality of life that are possible and will be<br />
increasingly possible as the material benefits of our work and development<br />
continue to flow in to us. I hope and I believe that as we step across the<br />
threshold of tLese exciting seventies, the people of Australia will say they<br />
would like to see a continuation of the kind of government that has transformed<br />
Australia. For it is not old, it is not tired; it is young and vital and<br />
seeking new approaches and, in the next twenty years, it will seize<br />
opportunities to make that transformation greater still.<br />
I think and believe that this will happen. If it does, then<br />
on behalf of the team I lead in Canberra, I can pledge to you that we will<br />
seek to our utmost to do that which I have tried to outline to you this<br />
afternoon, and we will go into the fight to do it, fortified by two things<br />
fortified by the knowledge that in all things that matter, we are a united<br />
team and a united party. There are no ideological cleavages anywhere,<br />
though there are and there should be discussions and arguments as to how<br />
a particular goal should be achieved. And that is different from the<br />
bitterly divided Opposition. We stand for achievement whereas people<br />
riven with ideological factions, riven with hatreds, cannot achieve its<br />
pledges. The second thing fortifying us is gatherings such as this which<br />
I have had the honour to attend in so many places in Australia. They show<br />
that there are behind us sharing our aspirations, great masses of intelligent<br />
Australians, willing to give of their own time and effort to build the<br />
Australia we believe in. </p>
