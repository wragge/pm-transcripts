TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MIP,<br />
HINCH PROGRAM, NETWORK 10, NOVEMBER 25 1992<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
DH: As I mentioned your TV viewing habits are about to change. Sexually<br />
explicit and violent movi es, even big Hollywood hits will soon be banned<br />
before 9.00pm. The man behind thc move, Prime Minister Paul Keating, is<br />
my guest tonight. Mr Keating, good evening.<br />
PM: Good evening Derryn.<br />
DH: With a million unemployed, with the economy in such a mess, how come<br />
this exercised your mind so much?<br />
PM: It's something I've had a bee in my bonnet about for a lot of years, a number<br />
of years. I thinkc a couple of things: one that my own children that age, I've<br />
got four childrcn a boy and thrcc girls, and the girls are 13, 11 and 7 and<br />
they are at that age where I think they are being subjected to very explicit<br />
violence. It's exciting for some of' them and a bad influcnce on them and I<br />
worry about the whole mood of violence, and the desensitisation that goes<br />
on in the community as the standards continue to change.<br />
DH: Is it true that Caroline, Katherine and Alexandra werc sitting at homc one<br />
Sunday night watching a movie with you and you said, hey I don't like this,<br />
don't let my kids see this?<br />
PM: No, what they often do is they watch it in a room themselves, but I find<br />
myself running backwards and forwards to see what they have on. One of </p>
<p>the things that we had in the recent school holidays was they were switching<br />
in between breaks onto a movie which was a horror movie, which had upset<br />
the youngest one quite a bit, and it really was a horrible thing. The problem<br />
was that they switched. In fact, it shouldn't have been on, in my view, at the<br />
time it was on. As well as that, we had these terrible murders against<br />
children. It's all I think part of a background to violence which is seeping<br />
into our society in part from the transmission of Hollywood product,<br />
American film product.<br />
DH: Is it true your wife said, you're the Prime Minister -so do something about it?<br />
PM: No, not really. She shares my vicw about it, but I had mentioned it over the<br />
years to various people in television and T just thought it was time to say<br />
something about it.<br />
DH: Why shouldn't parents be the arbiters. Why shouldn't parents say to thcir<br />
kids, you're not going to watch this at 8.3Oprn, it's too grown up, and turn It<br />
off?<br />
PM: I think a lot of parents do, and I think that's good that they do. But the<br />
problem we had Derryn was that again, the classifications were bad, that<br />
' AO' classification can be from something really quite soft to something<br />
quite hard. It was too broad and I don't think that what were up until now<br />
the television classifications, did give parents any real guide.<br />
DH: When you talk about what's violent and what should not be shown, are you<br />
looking at things like " Lethal Weapon" where policemen kill people, are<br />
you looking at Dirty Harry movies, cowboy movies, or are you looking at<br />
absolutely extreme violence?<br />
PM: Let me give you one like " Cape Fear", where a womn's check was bitten<br />
away et cetera, that sort of true-to-life, close-in violence, is I think the<br />
stuff that really hurts. But the gencral obliteration of people, if you have a<br />
problem and you can't resolve it, wipe people away this sort of notion that<br />
you pick up in movies these days. OK, adults can put it in the proper<br />
context, I don't think children or adolescents can casily do that.<br />
DH-Moving it back to 9. O0pm, that was a compromise because there was a push<br />
for 9.3Opm, and some groups have even said 10.00pm, haven't they?<br />
PM: There's two things that have happened here now. 8.3Opm is thc most<br />
convenient time slot, it means the films finish at about 1O. 3Opm or 10.45pm, </p>
<p>same at 11.00pm, it's about when most people want to give it away<br />
watching films, and the audiences drop off quite sharply. What well see<br />
now at 8.30pm is softer than we formerly were able to see at 83Opm.<br />
DH: Do you realise the ramifications, though, when things like late-night news<br />
programs will be pushed right back and may disappear, that a show like the<br />
Vizard Show on the Seven Network will be pushed back and disappear?<br />
PM: That's only if the station takes the option of running a 9. O0pm movie for<br />
something there will now be a split category ' AO' will be split. For a<br />
start, there will be a single category for television, film and video, set by the<br />
Commonwealth film~ censor. So there will be at least, as a result of this<br />
change Derryn, one classification system. Now what was formerly ' AO'<br />
will now be ' M and ' MA. ' MA' can be only shown after<br />
Television stations may choose just to show ' M films and modified ' M<br />
films, in which case they don't have to change the Vizard Show or any of<br />
the other programs. It really means about 70 or 80 films a year out of 500<br />
which the three networks show, they won't be able to show in the 8.30pm<br />
time slot.<br />
DH: When will this come in?<br />
PM: Virtually forthwith. We'll have to make the arrangements and see to what<br />
extent it needs to be legislated.<br />
DH: Is it voluntary now, have the networks agreed with you?<br />
PM: Yes, they've agreed on this structure, they have.<br />
DH: Because it's going to cost them a lot of money, isn't it?<br />
PM: I don't think so, not necessarily, I don't think so.<br />
DH: They're claiming $ 80 million in lost revenue.<br />
PM: It would be $ 80 million if thc whole thing was put back to 9.30pm. Now I<br />
think that probably is right, but we've now kept the 8.30pm slot for the<br />
convenience of most viewers and there's a 9. O0pm slot if they want to put<br />
harder things on.<br />
DH: Mr Pr ime Minister, we'll take a break, we'll be right back. </p>
<p>DH-: And back with the Prime Minister in our Canberra studio. What about the ABC,<br />
what about SBS are they going to be exempt from this?<br />
PM: I don't think they should be, no.<br />
DH: Do you have control over them?<br />
PM: We are going to see to what extent this legislation is required here and where then<br />
the self regulatory you see basically we are still relying on the-self regulatory<br />
framework because most M' category film which is shown today on television<br />
which is called but what will be VNwI, i ll be still modified ' VI, it's still got to<br />
be modified by the stations themselves. So there will be a monitoring rote by the<br />
Austraian Broadcasting, the ABA-Thle ABA will be looking at bow the TV<br />
stations modify film, so that self regulatory thing still basically exists.<br />
DH: Gary McDonald at the Peoples' Choice Awards the other night had a swipe at you<br />
about this issue because he made the point that you're saying all these movies<br />
should be put back so the little scumbags can watch them at 9: 30pm instead of<br />
9: 00pm. But he also said you're coming out of Canberra which is the X-rated<br />
video capital of Australia is there an irony there?<br />
PM: I don't think so, no. This is about free to air television, this is the stuff that people<br />
can turn on in their homes and they expect I think, reasonably Derryn, if you. turn a<br />
television set on at 8: 30pmn that what you're not shown is very explicit violence<br />
and that it's perfectly reasonable. What's happened is that the networks have been<br />
pushing their luck on this now for a couple of years they've been pushing the<br />
boundaries out and basically what's happened is the political system said hey, hang<br />
on, we think this is basically going to far to fast.<br />
DH: But what about when you see a series like the sex series on the Nine Network,<br />
which was very explicit, not a movie obviously, but a series, a very explicit<br />
genitalia, the works, where do you stand on that?<br />
PM: The sexual material that was unusual.<br />
DH-: It certainly was.<br />
PM: It certainly was that's right, it hasn't been shown before nor since. The sexual<br />
material I don't see in the general not that I see that much television to be that<br />
offending to me. What I think is more dangerous and offensive is violence and I<br />
think it's a culture of violence that you resolve conflict by basically straightcninp,<br />
people up, knocking them out, taking violent action against them.<br />
DH: Could you see thcse moviesq then moving to the pay TV channel? </p>
<p>PM: Pay TV will have basically uncut films. They will be largely uncut films and that's<br />
why it was important to get a single -you see when pay TV begins those films<br />
will be classified on the same basis as films at the theatre. So we are going to have<br />
one classification system for free to air television and one for pay television,<br />
obviously that was absurd. This was the right time to move to a single<br />
classification system.<br />
DH: Yes, Mr Keating we are about to run out of time but just briefly the High Court<br />
decision today on Phil Cleary, removing the Independent from the seat of Wills.<br />
How do you feel about that?<br />
PM: We fought the election hard, I think it is a pretty tough result for Mr Cleary to be<br />
disqualified on the technicality of being a public servant on leave. like winning<br />
battles, but I like winning them the right way, up front. don't think we're taking<br />
aniy political pleasure in this.<br />
DH: Would you like him to stand as your candidate in the by-election?<br />
PM: That's entirely another matter. He couldn't at the moment stand under a Labor<br />
Party banner, that would be a matter for the National Executive of the Labor Party<br />
should he himself ever choose to be interested.<br />
DHI: One final question, what about the issue now of dual citizenship and allegiance to<br />
foreign powers that may affect more than thirty members of Parliament?<br />
PM: In practical terms there is an appeal process against these things within a period<br />
after the election, that period has passed for members of the current Parliament as I<br />
understand it. But it would certainly be a live issue for people nominating at the<br />
next general election.<br />
DH: And when is that?<br />
PM: That's sometime in the middle of next year or up to the middle of next year so it<br />
means those who do have dual nationality as a result of the High Court's decision<br />
today have got time to basically renounce citizenship of another country to be<br />
certain that their nomination for the House of Representatives or the Senate is<br />
valid.<br />
DH: Yes, Prime Minister thanks for your time.<br />
PM: T7hanks Derryn.<br />
