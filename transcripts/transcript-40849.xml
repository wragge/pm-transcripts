    <content><![CDATA[<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER:</strong></p>
<p>Thanks Craig, it’s great to be with you all. It’s wonderful to have you here Premier Li, here at the Sydney Cricket Ground.</p>
<p>Here where my home team is playing on its home ground, the Sydney Swans against Port Adelaide.</p>
<p>David Koch it’s great that you’re here as the President and what an amazing job you’ve done, all of you, Mr Gui, setting up that game in May in Shanghai. Port Adelaide playing the Gold Coast Suns, a great opportunity for Australian-Chinese cooperation, Australian-Chinese engagement in every field and above all on the sporting field.</p>
<p>Now Premier I know you said last night you would be cheering for both sides. Initially, Kochie managed to get a Port Adelaide scarf on you and then one of the Swans supporters in the crowd threw up a Swans scarf for you.</p>
<p>[Laugher]</p>
<p>There’s a bit of scarf competition going on here ladies and gentlemen.</p>
<p>We are playing in the best of the great Australian sporting tradition so we’re all friends here. Friends of AFL, friends of Australian Football and what a magnificent job the AFL has done to engage with all Australians.</p>
<p>It is a truly multicultural game and it is now, as we saw with Chen downstairs, it is a global game and there are already two teams playing in Guangzhou which is amazing so great work AFL.</p>
<p>[Applause] </p>
<p>Just as women hold up half the sky, they now hold up half of Australian Football. We’ve seen this year the first season of the AFL Women’s competition.</p>
<p>As I am sure, those of who that are glued to your smartphones know already, the Adelaide Crows have won the competition.</p>
<p>[Applause]</p>
<p>The game starts in about twelve minutes. Welcome Premier Li, it’s wonderful to have you here in my electorate, with my home team playing.</p>
<p>It’s great to have you here, you’ve had a magnificent visit to Australia and we’ve achieved so much and you’ve been warmly received wherever you’ve been. Just here today from the crowd and also just as we were today in the Botanic Gardens.</p>
<p>Welcome Premier and congratulations to the AFL. Go Swannies! But as we always say, may the best team win.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>[ENDS]</strong></p>
