VISIT TO US, , CANADA AND UK<br />
DTTAX. A, CANADFA<br />
PRESS CONFERENCE GIVE~ N BY THE PRIME MINISTER,<br />
MR. HAROLD HOLT JUNE, 1967<br />
PRIME3 MINISTER: Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and good morning, ladies and<br />
gentlemen of the Press and others whom I see here.<br />
First, may I say what a pleasure it is to be back in Ottawa. You<br />
mention my Parliamentary experience. It was in that capacity I was here<br />
fifteen years agro as the Chairman of the Commonwealth Parliamentary<br />
Conference and as I entered into the Parliament buiklingr this morning, I had<br />
some nostalgic recollections of the very interesting, fruitful talks we had<br />
there then. I have in my office in Canberra a nice big group picture of your<br />
Parliament building, with the representatives of so many Commonwealth<br />
Parliamentarians shown in it.<br />
You have asked me if I would go over the ground that I had coveredi<br />
in discussion with the Prime Minister and members of his Cabinet. You will<br />
be aware, ofcourse, that the Prime Mlinister and I have had other opportun~ ties<br />
of talking at very much greater length than was possible this morning, and:<br />
it can be assumed that we covered just about all the topics that a Canadian and<br />
Australian Prime Minister would wish to canvass together, most of them of<br />
a rather serious and official sort, but other matters as well and I shall say<br />
a word or two about points of detail before I conclude.<br />
This morning I had an opportunity first of having a talk with him and<br />
Mr. Martin before I saw the Cabinet in relation to the Middle East crisis, and<br />
it was very useful to have the up-to-the-minute information which was reaching<br />
them. Later there was some discussion on this inside the Cabinet. There are<br />
two good reasons why I will not be going into detail on this: first of all, it is<br />
not for me to discuss confidential Cabinet-room discussions I would not be<br />
invited to many more if I did but the second reason is that the Prime<br />
Minister has I understand already made some public comment and I do not<br />
think that he would object to my saying that he intends to make a statement<br />
to the House when it meets this afternoon.<br />
V'd. hat I would add is that naturally we are all deeply concerned by these<br />
dramatic developments. Those, who have been close to the discussions, from<br />
the United States, the UK, this country, and other interested countries, had not<br />
anticipated that events would move so rapidly, and before there had been<br />
prospect for some definitive United Nations decision.<br />
But there they are; they have moved. There are conflicting accounts<br />
as to what has occurred. In these situations it is usual to find each side<br />
saying that the other started the fighting first, and it may be some time before<br />
the facts can be sufficiently sorted out for us to come toany judgment on that.<br />
There was not time in all the circumstances for me to discuss in any<br />
very great detail in the Cabinet the full range of matters which I would have<br />
liked to cover, but there are three in particular which I can mention.<br />
The British intentions East of Suez have, as you will be aware,<br />
concerned my own Government, that of the United States, New Zealand, Malaysia,<br />
Singapore and other governments in the area. What may not be so widely<br />
known is that around the arc which runs from South Korea, Japan, Taiwan, 2/ </p>
<p>South Vietnam itself, the Philippines, Thailand, and of course Australia and<br />
New Zealand under the ANZUS Pact, there are security arrangements which<br />
the United States has entered into in the countries I have mentioned.<br />
The one area which has been regarded as a Commonwealth and<br />
primarily British responsibility is the Malaysia-Singapore area and it is a<br />
matter of obvious concern to the United States and ourselves if the British<br />
were so to reduce their military presence in that area as to cease to have<br />
effectiveness for our joint purposes. However, this is a matter on which<br />
Mr. Wilson has assured me no final decisions will be taken at least until I<br />
have had an opportunity of discussing the matter with him in London in a few<br />
days' time. I am sure this will have featured in his discussions not only with<br />
the President but with the representatives of other interested countries.<br />
I say no more on that at this moment because the two matters which<br />
I felt were more directly of interest and concern to Canada were these:<br />
Canada and Australia have been leading members of the Commonwealth, the<br />
old Commonwealth and the new Commonwealth. I have been a Commonwealth<br />
man all my life, hoping to see this great concept of a multi-racial association<br />
made to work effectively. I could never see how unless this could be accomplished,<br />
we could have a United Nations working effectively. If those of us who have so<br />
much in common interest are not able to co-operate in a constructive way, it<br />
is hard to see how the United Nations, with all its divergencies of interests and<br />
national cross-currents, could succeed in doing so.<br />
But over recent years, we have been concerned to find that there has<br />
been less emphasis on Commonwealth co-operation. Meetings are tending to<br />
become less frequent: it is unlikely, I gather, that they are meeting this year,<br />
and with the United Kingdom seeking entry into the European Economic Community<br />
there may be a reluctance to meet too early at a time when problems arising<br />
from that will be concerning so many countries of the Commonwealth. It was<br />
through the meetings of the Commonwealth that Australia and Canada were able<br />
to maintain a fairly close contact with each other.<br />
What I have been putting to your Prime Minister and to his Cabinet<br />
colleagues ( and I am very glad to say that they have responded in a very positive<br />
way to this) is that Australia and Canada must try to meet together more often<br />
at a governmental level and perhaps even in other ways, that we must get to<br />
know each other better, get to know more about what goes on inside our<br />
respective countries. One of your Ministers is coming out, I gather, to us<br />
in July and I welcome that, but I have also urged the Prime Minister to make<br />
a visit which will be only the second visit ever made, as I recall it, by a<br />
Canadian Prime Minister to Australia. He has assured me that he would hope<br />
to do this, and perhaps towards the end of the year this will be found possible<br />
for him. We have two countries growing in economic strength, growing in<br />
influence throu.-, hout the world. We have a special relationship, each of us,<br />
with the United States and the United Kingdom. Canada, which has developed<br />
a considerable influence through the United Nations and in particular areas of<br />
the world such as the Caribbean and in the continent of Africa, and Australia,<br />
which is developinr a growing influence in the Southeast Asian and Pacific area,<br />
together I think can contribute very valuably to international policy-making of<br />
the future and can contribute valuably, both of us being quite liberal aid-givers,<br />
to the economic programmes of the countries where our assistance is given.<br />
And so it makes good sense that we should not only get closer to each other,<br />
but consult much more frequently with each other. 3/ </p>
<p>I have a vision of a Canada and an Australia at the end of this century,<br />
when your population will by then almost certainly have doubled and ours will<br />
have doubled; and with the skills and the energies of our people, the enterprise<br />
we demonstrate in our countries, I feel that together we would be a significant<br />
factor in the consideration of international problems. So the more we can<br />
understand why the other adopts a certain line of policy, the more we can<br />
harmonize our policies on these international questions, the better it will be<br />
for this process in the future.<br />
There is the other good reason which I have also canvassed with the<br />
Prime Minister and his colleagues. I believe that there is a substantial<br />
Canadian self-interest in taking a much more active interest in what is going<br />
on in Asia and the Pacific. By the end of the century certainly there will be<br />
more than 60 per cent of the world's population in which we broadly term Asia.<br />
I think that if you take East of Suez now, there is probably three-fifths of human<br />
kind to be found in that area of the world, and most of the countries are countries<br />
unlike those of Africa, even unlike to a degree the countries of South America,<br />
and countries which have thousands of years of civilization behind them, and<br />
skills which have accumulated, but they have never been able to exploit their,<br />
skills or their rich resources because of the turbulence which has been a<br />
feature of life on the mainland of Asia.<br />
Now as different countries, and I speak of those particularly around the<br />
arc that I have mentioned, are able to bring communism under check, and are<br />
able to develop a greater degree of cooperation with other countries in the area<br />
and countries such as my own, the economic progress has been quite striking.<br />
In both Taiwan and Korea, they have developed two of the highest rates of<br />
increase of gross national product to be found anywhere in the world.<br />
It may interest you to know that Australia, which had a negligible trade<br />
with Japan in the years after the second world war has now developed its<br />
trade with Japan to a point where Japan has become the largest purchaser in<br />
value of Australian exports, outstripping even the United Kingdom. The<br />
growth of our trade East of Suez has moved from about 15 per cent in the<br />
early 1950' s to 40 per cent of our total export trade, and this export trade is<br />
a very much greater volume of course than it was in those earlier years.<br />
Now, Japan has evidenced, as have the two countries I have just mentioned,<br />
a very remarkable growth rate and there is a rising curve still in these<br />
countries. There are other countries which have the potential but which have<br />
not yet taken off in quite the same way. I can illustrate that for you by these<br />
figures: India has a population about 42 times that of Australia. It has a value<br />
of gross national product only double that of Australia. Indonesia has a<br />
population 9 times that of Australia, but it has a value of gross national<br />
production only one-third that of my country, and yet beyond argument it is<br />
a country vastly rich in resources and now that it has a more stable administration<br />
and is disposed to be more cooperative with the countries of the western world,<br />
there is some reasonable prospect that growth can develop much more rapidly.<br />
And so I say that Canada which has its own Pacific border and from British<br />
Columbia looks out across the Pacific, should, in its own interest, I believe,<br />
be taking an increasing activity and increasing interest in the affairs of the area.<br />
This is not in any way directed to the short-term problems that we have,<br />
for example, in Vietnam. Your position there is well understood, but I would<br />
hope that, taking the longer view and with these favourable developments which<br />
can be pointed to in so many countries, we would find a growing Canadian<br />
interest and through that interest a growing Australi a-Canadian cooperation. .4/ </p>
<p>Again I find your Prime Minister and his colleagues very receptive to this<br />
point of view, and indicating that they themselves see the value in pursuing their<br />
general courses along tiLA-se lines, while not of course neglecting their historic<br />
and traditional contacts with the United States and with the countries of Europe.<br />
Now the only other two matters I would like to mention and I will do<br />
this as briefly as I can: Last night it was my pleasure to present to the people<br />
of Canada as a centennial gesture two Australian pictures, one from our<br />
pioneering past a picture of about 1850 by George Hamilton who was one of<br />
the very early settlers. It is quite a historic picture in a sense, and the n-2rk<br />
of a good gift is that it hurts you a little to give it away, and it is a picture that<br />
we do not part with other than a degree of regret, but with a sense of pleasure<br />
that it is going to a very great friend in the Canadian people.<br />
The other one is right at the other end of the time spectrum, in that it is<br />
the work of one of our most distinguished painters, Sir W illiam Dobell. It is<br />
a painting which he was actually putting together for one of our Government<br />
galleries, and the paint was still wet on it when I snatched it from him. But I<br />
thought you had there a good Australian representation something out of the<br />
past, something from one of our very successful and more modern painters.<br />
The other thing is, as you know, we have a pavilion at EXPO. It has proved<br />
very popular. The expectation of the percentage of visitors we would receive<br />
given to us by the EXPO authorities has been greatly exceeded, perhaps in the<br />
order of three times the percentage that was indicated to us. This has had one<br />
consequence which some of us politicians and others might not welcome: the<br />
talking chairs which record us and our views on certain Australian matters have<br />
had to be adjusted, so that the time of speech has been severely truncated.<br />
Well, perhaps you would wish that could happen here. But we have made it known<br />
I did this last night to your Prime Minister and I felt it was appropriate that<br />
this should be made known as from Government to Government that Australia<br />
would wish this pavilion to remain with you, and I would look to the notable<br />
diplomatic skill of the Prime Minister to sort out as between his Government and<br />
others how it might best be employed in your country.<br />
Wlell, thank you for hearing from me to that degree. Now, in the time that<br />
is available, I will be glad to make myself available to you.<br />
Q. Sir, have you any comment to make on the outbreak of war in the Middle<br />
E~ ast and Australia's views on that war?<br />
P. M. No. As I say, your Prime Minister has made some comment and will be<br />
commenting agrain in the House. I certainly would not want to make public<br />
comment on the matters we discussed together. I was given all the information, of<br />
a factual kind and it is still a little confused, understandably that was in the<br />
possession of your Government. I think I mentioned earlier that we were deeply<br />
concerned, as were all peace-loving countries, in a development of this kind,: but<br />
until we can see what comes out of the Security Council, I do not know that there<br />
is a great deal that one can usefully add at this point of time.<br />
Of course, we regret the outbreak of fighting; we would have-hoped that the<br />
processes of conciliation, the good offices of the United Nations, could have been<br />
emp'oyed to find some solution of this matter. The Security Council has gone<br />
into recess, but the members are at call and I understand will be meeting again<br />
later this afternoon. But there, both the representatives of Egypt and of Israel<br />
have claimed that the fighting was initiated by the other and I am in no position<br />
to offer a judgment on that. It seems clear that there have been serious<br />
casualties already and much damage done to aircraft and military installations,<br />
and one particularly unfortunate developmnent is that the thrce Indians in the<br />
United Nations force there have been killed. </p>
<p>But other than that I do not think I could usefully make a comment I have<br />
not had an opportunity of consulting my own Australian colleagues on these<br />
latest developments. Vie had indicated earlier of course that if there were to<br />
a be a declaration by maritime powers comparab . to the one into which Australia<br />
entered some years ago, we would join in that declaration but that is the extent<br />
of positive action that we have been asked to consider at this point of time.<br />
Q. Mr. Prime Minister, you were quoted late last week to the effect that you<br />
were in favour of continued bombing of North Vietnam, perhaps intensified<br />
bombing, by the United Stat es. How much escalation, how much bombing, Sir,<br />
and to what end?<br />
P. M. . Well, I do not know that I talked about intensified bombing. I did talk<br />
about the bombing continuing, and it has been intensive bombing, particularly<br />
over the last several weeks when the weather has been good enough to enable it<br />
to be carried out the more effectively. But it does not seem to make sense to<br />
me that when you are resisting armed forces on the ground, and those armed<br />
forces are being supplied from North Vietnam, that you would leave the sources<br />
of supply immune from attack. We have supported the line which the Americfins,<br />
I believe realistically, have adopted in this matter. I know there have been<br />
suggestions that if the bombing were to cease, Hanoi, the Viet Gong, would be<br />
disposed to enter into negotiations. I do not find any substantial evidence, any<br />
convincing evidence, of this at all, and I get as much information on it as most<br />
other heads of government, who are in the closest consultation with the United<br />
States on these matters, and with the Government of South Vietnam. I would take<br />
a lot of persuading that if Hanoi wished to negotiate had a will to negotiate<br />
that it would not find some way, through the various diplomatic channels that<br />
are readily available, and through all the well-intentioned efforts made by<br />
representatives of other countries, to indicate a formula which without any loss<br />
of face to them could get negotiations moving. But on the contrary, every time<br />
there has been a lull either in the fighting or the bombing, full advantage has been<br />
taken of that by the forces in North Vietnam and the authorities there to build up<br />
their supplies, rush supplies which had clearly been inhibited from movement as<br />
a consequence of the bombing earlier, and in that way endanger South Vietnamese<br />
and American lives and the lives of our own people fighting there.<br />
So I have been quite emphatic on this and this is the view of our Government,<br />
and I believe it is the view of the United States. And while the fighting continues<br />
and infiltration of men and material from the north persists, so I believe the<br />
bombing should persist.<br />
Q. Sir, what sort of form do you have specifically in mind when you speak of<br />
Canada taking a greater interest in Asian affairs, and whether or not Canada<br />
should do that? What was Australia's interest in Canada taking a greater<br />
interest there?<br />
P. M. V~ ell, I thought I had indicated that a growing strength economically and in<br />
world influence of the two countries together was in the mutual interest of the<br />
two countries and could make an increasingly positive contribution to policy<br />
making in the world. In one sense, I might be arguing against the economic<br />
competitive position of my own country. I would be prepared to take that risk in the inerest<br />
of the larger considerions that I have mentioned. I am not implying that<br />
Canada is not shoving some interest in the affairs of the reg.. ion; you were<br />
contributors to the Asian Development Bank and you give more liberally than<br />
most countries per head of population to aid programmes. But this is a matter<br />
of degree and I think your own ministerial representatives and the Prime Mini ster<br />
would acknowledge that traditionally and historically the emphasis has been on<br />
Canadian activity in Europe and in its relations with the United States. I am no~ t<br />
arguing that there should be some dramatic reversal of the process. 11hhat I arn<br />
urging is that there be an increasing interest and participation in the affairs of<br />
the region. just what form this would take and in what institutions is a matter for<br />
discussion but it is important that there should be the will to do this and, as I have-<br />
6/ </p>
<p>6.<br />
indicated, the reactions I have had from the Prime Minister and his colleagues<br />
reveal that they appreciate the importance of doing this.<br />
Q. Sir, do I take it that Australia is still satisfied with the conduct of the war<br />
in Vietnam and that your Government still intends as you stated in Washington<br />
last year to go " all the way with LBJ"?<br />
P. M. XWell, if you do not mind applying that phrase to the Vietnam situation, I<br />
stick by it. We have given support to the United States in Vietnam. May I remind<br />
you that'Australia was the first country to declare itself alongside the United<br />
States when communist aggression moved into North Korea, and I have just come<br />
back from a visit to South Korea and have found the Australian contribution made<br />
at that time greatly appreciated there. Vie were one of the first countries to<br />
declare ourselves in support of the United States in South Vietnam for very much<br />
the same reasons that brought us into the conflict in South Korea: the determination<br />
to resist communist aggression which threatened the integrity of a particular<br />
country but also threatened peace and stability throughout the area as a whole.<br />
It is our conviction that unless communist aggression can be checked in South<br />
Vietnam, then there is no country in the region which could regard itself as being<br />
secure. I read an interesting article by Mr. Drew Middleton, published in the<br />
New York Times a couple of days ago. He has been in all the countries of the<br />
region and with the exception of Pakistan, Cambodia and Burma, he found a<br />
ready acknowledgment and appreciation of the American presence and what it<br />
meant to the security of those countries. And I have seen with my own eyes<br />
what these countries have been able to do in building their economies, in<br />
strengthening their social and political position once the communist threat<br />
has been either resisted or brought under check.<br />
Qf Mr. Prime Minister, you mention the need to bring communism under<br />
check in your area. Do you think it can be done without an eventual clash with<br />
Red China?<br />
P. M. Yes, I think it can. First of all, I do not think that with the resources<br />
available to those who would be resisting China that China could secure a military<br />
victory, and at that point of time I think it would be difficult for it to secure a<br />
political victory. The Chinese are pretty realist-minded people the fact that<br />
they have limited their involvement in North Vietnam, despite the very obvious<br />
interests they have in that matter, I think is some confirmation of this. They<br />
are also a very patient people and they may think that they can secure their ends<br />
over a period of time without getting involved in serious military loss. But I have<br />
seen the strength that has developed in South Korea, in Taiwan, in both of which<br />
countries there are very substantial and well-trai ned, well-equipped military<br />
forces; and the growin ir strength of Thailand economically and Malaysia<br />
economically Malaysia and Thailand also both building up their domestic<br />
security forces. An d I have seen the progress being, made in my own country.<br />
Indonesia I very much doubt whether we would have had the favourable turn<br />
of events in Indonesia had it not been for the clear evidence that the communists<br />
were not going to win in South Vietnam. </p>
