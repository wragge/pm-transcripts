PRIME MINISTER'...<br />
FOR MEDIA 17 SEPTEMBER 1979<br />
ADDRESS TO PACIFIC-ASIAN CONGRESS OF MUNICIPALITIES<br />
This is the Sixth Pacific-Asian Congress of Municipalities<br />
and Australia is honoured, Adelaide is honoured, that it is<br />
being held in this city. I am delighted to be here with you.<br />
The region from which you all come is, of course, a vastly<br />
important region for Australia, as it is to you. It is the<br />
region in which we live. It is the region in which we all<br />
need to work out our own futures, working as far as possible<br />
in harmony with policies that can advance our common cause to<br />
the greatest extent.<br />
I believe this meeting does affect the sense of interdependence<br />
between cities, between nations, between people. The Asia-Pacific<br />
economy is comparable in many areas with the Atlantic community<br />
and the Atlantic economy comparable in population, comparable<br />
in resources and Gross National Product, and comparable in<br />
trade and industry.<br />
In some respects, it is one of the fastest growing areas in<br />
the world. Within the region of course there is some honest<br />
diversity participants of this conference come from countries<br />
that are very far from Australia, others that are just next door.<br />
They come from two hemispheres; from large and from small<br />
countries, and from countries in all stages of development.<br />
But within that diversity I believe we should seek the goals<br />
of moderation, and of tolerance and understanding, especially<br />
where there are differences. Diversity is one of the significant<br />
characteristics of the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting<br />
when about 40 Heads of government meet every second year.<br />
At the last Heads of Government Meeting, at Lusaka, for example<br />
they worked together to help solve intractable problems and<br />
difficulties. They were able to do that only because people<br />
were able to be moderate passionate in support of moderation<br />
if you like with a spirit of compromise and with a spirit<br />
of good sense and well-being. Very much the same values are<br />
needed in our own region, where there are also problems. There<br />
are problems in Indochina, problems with refugees, and the<br />
challenges of inadequate standards of living in a number of<br />
countries. </p>
<p>2-<br />
A number of newly industrialising countries Singapore,<br />
Hong Kong, the Republic of Korea and Taiwan have shown<br />
remarkable progress over recent years, and in some ways, have<br />
led the way in the newly industrialising process. These four<br />
countries produce almost half the exports of industrial goods<br />
among the world's developing countries. That indicates on the<br />
one hand, the progress that these four nations have made, but<br />
it also emphasises the fact that greater progress is needed<br />
in a number of other countries.<br />
That is not always the fault of the countries concerned.<br />
Unequal trading opportunities sometimes hold back development<br />
which could otherwise occur. There are many countries where<br />
prospects are more limited than for these four, unless there<br />
are adequate aid programmes and adequate trading arrangements<br />
made in the wider world community.<br />
There is also a difference within the region in the extent<br />
to which countries have an acceptance of global economic<br />
interdependence. There are a number of countries that are<br />
very open in their trading practices: Singapore and Hong Kong<br />
S are two which depend almost totally on trade and on open<br />
markets for world goods. There are many others, in Indo-China,<br />
for example, where there is little interaction with neighbours<br />
and with economies that are nowhere near so open.<br />
There is this great diversity, not only in politics and approach,<br />
but also in need, between the countries of the region. There is<br />
however, a growing interdependence and a growing understanding<br />
of the need of the importance of interdependence between peoples<br />
and countries Despite a great diversity of cultures, and<br />
in economies, that interdependence is becoming more and more<br />
evident. There is now a network of economic relationships: 40% of<br />
the United States' exports, for example, go to countries of<br />
the Asia Pacific region while 47% of the United States' imports<br />
come from the western Pacific or from Canada. For Japan,<br />
of their exports go to the Asian Pacific region and 43%<br />
of their imports come from the region. 60% of the total trade<br />
in most western Pacific countries Jiie~ s ' within the region itself . None<br />
of this would be possible if there were not a close and-a<br />
growing network of economic and commerical relationships<br />
between the countries and cities of the region.<br />
Over recent times there has been significant change in<br />
the direction of trade, in many cases, and a significant<br />
transfer of technology. All of these again point to a<br />
growing interdependence between nations.<br />
Sometimes that interdependence can carry some dangers with it.<br />
We need to understand the possible dangers-and to do what we<br />
can to avoid them. The development of ASEAN for example has<br />
been quite remarkable. It is now a cohesive and strong group<br />
of nations advancing its own region and making a greater<br />
contribution therefore to the general stability of South East Asia<br />
and the western Pacific. But a number of the industrieswhich<br />
have emerged in ASEAN countries are competing with the<br />
same goods and the same commodities for the same markets, and<br />
therefore a competitive environment grows within the region.<br />
That's not just competition between industries in the region / 13 </p>
<p>and other outside. The competitive situation also arises<br />
within the region. It is important to do what we can to<br />
see that that does not lead to tensions within the region,<br />
as economic rivalry has sometimes in the past led to tension<br />
between other nations. Certainly we need to avoid in the<br />
Asia Pacific area any signs of the sort of economic nationalism<br />
that did so much damage in Europe and North America in the<br />
1930s. I don't believe there are signs of that kind of<br />
economic nationalism in our theatre. Nevertheless, it is<br />
very important indeed to be aware of the dangers that can<br />
come in inflationary circumstances, where the growth of trade<br />
is perhaps not as great as we would like to see, and the pressure<br />
for greater protectionism can therefore also be greater than<br />
we would like to see. It is to the credit of the region<br />
the Asian Pacific theatre that these dangers have largely<br />
been averted up to the present time.<br />
A short while ago, William Miller, Secretary to the'-United States<br />
Treasury said: " Inflation is a clear and present danger. It has<br />
struck at our nation's vitality. If it is not checked, then<br />
it will threaten our democratic system itself... We must<br />
attack the root causes and totally eradicate the basic sources<br />
of the malady... What is needed is a comprehensive sustained<br />
and total war against inflation". I found that view to<br />
be accepted, not only amongst the industrialised countries,<br />
but in most international forums at a meeting called by<br />
Jamaica at the turn of the New Year, developed and developing<br />
countries alike at UNCTAD 5 in Manila, and als-o at the Commonwealth<br />
Heads of Government Meeting at Lusaka. Because with rising inflation<br />
confidence is reduced, profitability is reduced, uncertainty amongst<br />
businesses and peoples is increased and then market growth is slow,<br />
leading to unemployment and then to more unemployment. In these<br />
circumstances, there can be great pressures for government<br />
intervention, and sometimes pressures for intervention at the time<br />
won't help cure the ills. It might sometimes make the ills more<br />
serious and more difficult ultimately to eradicate.<br />
One of the consequences of inflation is that it offers a threat<br />
to developing countries and newly independent States. That can<br />
come because inflation can lead to protection in advanced countries<br />
and therefore to the denial of markets to newly devel-oping countries,<br />
and to the industrialising countries.<br />
Governments of the region need as much as we possibly can to<br />
co-operate and to avoid the friction which can come from pressures<br />
for a very rapid change. I believe we can assist each other, and<br />
to some extent we can adopt common strategies to combat inflation,<br />
to minimise the evils of undue protectionism. We can do more<br />
actively to press major industrialised nations outside the region<br />
to adopt like policies to combat inflation and to reduce<br />
protection. This was a very strong thread at UNCTAD 5 in Manila<br />
in a most magnificent conference center, in a city which housed<br />
some 5,000 delegates in a most hospitable and friendly manner.<br />
The evil of inflation and of increased protectionism is one which all<br />
countries expressed great concern about at that conference, only<br />
a few months ago. / 4<br />
3' </p>
<p>4-<br />
Why is it so important to be concerned about these things?<br />
To-understand it we need to look at the historical background.<br />
Let me explain, against that background what I have in mind.<br />
In the late 1940' s to about 1970 there was unprecedented growth<br />
in world capital in the economies of developed and developing<br />
countries alike.<br />
There are particular reasons for that. Before the World War<br />
there had been a depression, after the War there was pent-up<br />
consumer demand which provided markets for the products of<br />
factories of Europe and North America. There was the imaginative<br />
Marshall Plan which assisted greatly in the rebuilding of wardamaged<br />
Europe. There was the introduction of new technology<br />
which produced new goods which in the industrialised countries<br />
were going to become commonplace in nearly every household.<br />
As a result of that, there was a sustained up-surge in growth<br />
of trade and of income in many countries. Many developing<br />
countries also experienced lack of growth during the same<br />
period. But by the 1970s, that consumer boom was running down.<br />
At the same time, there were increased impediments to enterprise,<br />
to investment and to development. There were increased impediments<br />
to jobs and to the creation of enterprises that would provide<br />
more work for more people.<br />
There were a number of reasons for this. The view had come about,<br />
as a result of a certai-1 view cf economics, that government's<br />
could provide all things. If they did rnot have'enough funds they coulc<br />
just print more. Inflation became entrenched in the 1970s in'<br />
many, many countries around the world in North America and in<br />
Europe. As a result of that, world trade has grown at only half<br />
the rate of the previous 20 years, as one of the direct causes<br />
of high world unemployment. There was an expectation that<br />
governments could provide all the things that their people<br />
expected, hoped for and wanted. Maybe aspirations were too high,<br />
but as the result of these pressures, inflation has become<br />
entrenched as a grave and serious evil in many countries in<br />
North America and Europe and in a number of others. But then<br />
again, because in many of the years since the War growth has<br />
been so great that people forgot the circumstances that might<br />
have occurred before the Second World War. They took-growth<br />
for granted. They thought this was the natural state of what<br />
would occur in the modern economies of developed or developing<br />
countries. Governments again led people to place unrealistic<br />
demands upon governments and upon their own economies. Growth can<br />
not be taken for granted. ' If you really want growth you have<br />
to have policies that promote it.<br />
The conditions which generated the great international growth<br />
from about 1949 to 1970 have largely disappeared. I am concerned<br />
that reducing inflation alone, and reducing protection alone,<br />
may not in themselves achieve the resurgence in growth that<br />
is needed if the problems of the world and world poverty are<br />
to be overcome. Do we needstatutory road blocks for development, and<br />
do we need statutory road blocks for investment? Many<br />
investments that would have been possible 30 years ago,<br />
years ago, maybe even 15, today would not be. There are all the<br />
environmental requirements that new laws now place upon enterprise. </p>
<p>There are foreign investment provisions which oil companies<br />
have; there are national investment policies; there are<br />
restrictive trade practices legislation. Corporations and<br />
enterprises have to find their way through all these things.<br />
I am advised that in CaliforniaP for example, it could take<br />
two to three years to get through the environmental restrictions<br />
just to place some L. P. G. gas tanks on the Californian coast.<br />
That is just one example of the difficulties that occur and<br />
the various developments that were not in existence 20 years. ago.<br />
Against that background, these concerns were mentioned at UNCTAD<br />
in Manila. They were mentioned again at the Commonwealth Heads<br />
of Government Meeting in Lusaka. As a result of the general<br />
concern that getting inflation down alone might not be enough<br />
to establish a resurgence of the world growth and of world<br />
trade. The Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting adopted an<br />
Australian proposal for a study on the constraints to growth.<br />
What are the constraints to growth within an economy and between<br />
nations? Can a study by the Commonwealth throw some greater<br />
light upon that and point the way to national or international<br />
policies and might enable us to look forward to a more prosperous<br />
world economic future than might otherwise be the case.<br />
Australia will be providing a representative for the study<br />
group and it will be reporting in time to assist governments<br />
in their preparation for a special session of the United Nations<br />
General Assembly in 1980. So that is not all that far off. It<br />
has been'emphasised at UNCTAD and at other forums that the system<br />
does not always work as well as we would like or work as fairly<br />
as we would like. The Common Fund is designed to make sure that<br />
developing countries in particular are given a better opportunity<br />
to market their commodities in the markets of the world within<br />
a proper framework and in a way which does not grow too serious<br />
to upset our own development or plans. The need for the Common<br />
Fund has been accepted both by the advanced, developed countries<br />
and by the developing countries, although much work needs to be<br />
done on its implementation.<br />
I hope very much that work flowing out of UNCTAD 5 and out of<br />
the study group which I have spoken about concerning the<br />
Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting will enable us to take<br />
the debate further. I hope that it will point to-pol-cies which<br />
governments can actively and sensibly pursue.<br />
There is a great deal of co-operation within this region which<br />
you are representing here ASEAN is a tremendous example of<br />
mutual support and co-operation amongst five significant<br />
countries. There is the Pacific Forum. There are<br />
the countries of the Pacific dealing with New Zealand and<br />
Australia which discuss many matters of mutual co-operation in<br />
the Pacific and the-South Pacific in particular, matters such<br />
as fisheries, transport and trade relatf. ons and a forum which<br />
brings together the Pacific nations enables them to pool their<br />
ideas, their hopes and their resources. There is the South<br />
Pacific BureaUL for Economic co-operation which links Australia 6 </p>
<p>-6<br />
and New Zealand with small independent State of the South<br />
Pacific and of Papua-New Guinda.<br />
Australia has participated in regional meetings, for example<br />
the 1978 Commonwealth Heads of Government Regional Meeting<br />
which involved a smaller number of. States in the Pacific<br />
together with India as the largest member of the Commonwealth.<br />
That group identified fields of co-operation which can be<br />
actively pursued amongst the member States.<br />
As a result of that regional meeting, working groups have<br />
been established on trade,-energy, terrorism and illicit<br />
drugs and trading in drugs. A further meeting of that<br />
regional group will be held and hosted in India in 1980.<br />
The Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting the full meetingheld<br />
every two years with about 40 States present, quite clearly<br />
and obviously at most times is going to be related to the highly<br />
difficult and sensitive major national and international issues,<br />
such as the last conference, Southern African issues, the<br />
problems of Zimbabwe-Rhodesia and also the major problems of<br />
economic relationships and the North South economic relationship.<br />
At that major meeting, some of the smaller States felt that their<br />
particular needs and concerns we're not always met. There is not<br />
always an' adequate response. There is not always adequate time<br />
to enable their problems to be discussed and understood. The<br />
regional meeting provides a greater opportunity for that and<br />
for that reason alone, is something of particular merit.<br />
Interdependence amongst States is obviously promoted by a number<br />
of the important institutions that are present in the area.-<br />
the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia in<br />
the Pacific, the Asian Development Bank. There have been other<br />
suggestions which help co-operation within the Pacific community.<br />
There have been proposals fo~ r greater co-operation in relation<br />
to Pacific trade, aid and development. The Prime Minister of<br />
Japan has broadly suggested that a Pacific Basin community<br />
should be established. There is much merit in these ideas, but<br />
they need, a great deal of work, a great deal of examination.<br />
People have an idea that the Pacific countries should be co-operating<br />
more closely but they do not at the moment know in what form or<br />
in what way; how it can be consumated. Therefore there needs to<br />
be substance given to the idea, so that the countries of the<br />
Pacific can pursue common objectives more vigorously.<br />
I believe that this conference itself is a very good example in.<br />
the way which communities can come together to discuss their<br />
common hopes, their common concerns.<br />
Very brie fly, could I say something about Australia in the region.<br />
I pointed to the changing directions of trade a few moments ago.<br />
Nowhere is that more evident than in the changed directions of<br />
Australia's trade. In 1960, 33% of our trade was with Asia and<br />
Asean 28% was with the United Kingdom. Now, over 50% of our<br />
trade is with Asian and Pacific countries and only 7% with the<br />
United Kingdom. Over the period from 1960 to the present trade<br />
/ 17 </p>
<p>-7<br />
has grown at an annual average rate in the Pacific Asian<br />
area of about 14%. With the United Kingdom it has grown<br />
by only 3% which means there has been a very real reduction<br />
in real terms of trade with the United Kingdom. Then again,<br />
if we look at ASEAN exports to Australia, to take an example,<br />
they have grown from about $ 107 million worth in 1972 to<br />
nearly $ 650 million worth in this last year.<br />
Developing countries exports to Australia has grown from $ 600<br />
million to nearly $ 3,000 million over the same period. Their<br />
share of Australia's imports has very nearly doubled. It is<br />
worth noting, that over recent years Australia's average<br />
annual rate of growth and import from ASEAN countries to take<br />
a group of developing countries has been more than 30%, where<br />
total imports have grown at a very much lesser rate than that.<br />
Developing countries share of Australia's total imports has<br />
also grown very significantly over the period. In other words,<br />
there has been a major reoitientation of Australia's trade and<br />
trading direction. We still have important trade with Europe,<br />
with the United Kingdom. But now the Pacific Asian theatre<br />
is becoming increasingly important to us.<br />
That I think is taking Australia's example to emphasise the<br />
countries of the Pacific Asian theatre are much more dependent<br />
upon each other than they once were, and I believe that that<br />
trend will cerc'ainly continue for all of us in the years ahead.<br />
In development assistance, we have special responsibilities<br />
for obvious an d historical reasons with Papua-New Guinea,<br />
and a large part of our development assistance goes to Papua-<br />
New Guinea. But, beyond that, the bulk of our bilateral aid<br />
goes to ASEAN and South Pacific countries where projects<br />
varying from $ 1 to $ 50 million are being supported by Australia<br />
and significant programmes also in the South Pacific. The<br />
aid programmes themselves establish valuable contact on<br />
national, provincial and local government levels and also<br />
enlarge the reality of understanding between people. One of<br />
the programmes of particular value is the student programme<br />
where overseas students come to study in our universities and<br />
colleges and schools. Since the Second World War, more than<br />
26,000 students from nearly 90 developing countrie-s, lhve had<br />
training in Australia under some form of official sponsorship<br />
from our government or from another government. 12,000 of<br />
these have come from ASEAN countries, and then on top, there<br />
have been 16,000 private overseas students over the last 9 or<br />
years from about 90 countries and about 9,000 of those have<br />
come from ASEAN countries.<br />
This was one of the best kinds of contact and communcation,<br />
because it means that young men and women in our institutions<br />
come to learn and make friends with students from overseas. In<br />
that environment, they are gaining greater knowledge and<br />
understanding of other countries and of other peoples. It is<br />
certainly our belief and our hope that students who study here<br />
and who return to their homeland carry a feeling of affection<br />
for Australia. These bonds between people may well ultimately<br />
be the strongest bonds between nations. We have recently adopted<br />
policies which I hope will enable us to expand the number of<br />
cases in our education institutions for students from other<br />
countries. ./ 8 </p>
<p>-8-<br />
The contacts between Australians and the people of the countries of<br />
Asia, the Pacific, on a business, personal ahd commercial<br />
level, are quite important to the relationship as an addition<br />
to the relationship between governments. That is particularly<br />
so when the historic and cultural backgrounds are so different.<br />
We have quite actively sought to promote that kind of cultural<br />
exchange between people, between Australia and a very wide<br />
range of countries. That is another reason why there is so<br />
much worth in this conference being held here in Adelaide.<br />
Local government interdependence is also very important. That<br />
we* have got this conference being held here is a recognition<br />
that local government is very important to good government.<br />
In many senses it is the level of government that is closest<br />
to the aspirations and hopes of people, I am quite sure that<br />
the participants in this conference will welcome the opportunity<br />
to exchange ideas and acknowledge the way in which your plans<br />
are undertaken, the advancement of your own cities and of your<br />
own peoples. It will be important for Australian members of this<br />
conference to understand how mayors and municipal leaders from<br />
cities overseas translate their hopes into actions that will<br />
advance the-importance of their own people. I am sure there<br />
is much to learn in this particular direction.<br />
The conference must surely lead us to have an enlarged<br />
appreciation of other communities, of their needs, and enlarged<br />
appreciation of how we can identify problems and resolve<br />
difficulties. Nations are no longer self contained. They<br />
can no longer in a selfish way pursue their own future without<br />
some care, without some concern for their actions in other<br />
nations, in other places. The economic, social and political<br />
progress which we are all part of depends upon an ability to<br />
enlarge contacts between people and between nations.<br />
Therefore there is a benefit with the wider opportunities<br />
thus created. Now, these objectives at this conference will<br />
make an important contribution. I hope you will go back to<br />
your own communities with an appreciation of what we are trying<br />
to do-in Australia, and hope you will leave behind you a much<br />
better understanding amongst a large number of Australians of<br />
what you are doing to advance the cause of your cities and of<br />
your own people.<br />
If the conference achieves nothing more than that, it will<br />
have advanced the cause of relationships between a very large<br />
number of countries, between a large number of cities and.<br />
peoples. </p>
