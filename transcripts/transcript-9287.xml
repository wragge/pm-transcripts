TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P. J. KEATING MP<br />
DOORSTOP, TULLY STREET PRIMARY SCHOOL, TOWNSVILLE,<br />
WEDNESDAY, 20 JULY 1994<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
J: Prime Minister, I believe you've been confronted by people about the<br />
Hinchinbrook development. Are you sympathetic to their concerns?<br />
PM: Well, the Commonwealth has now a very long history of environmental<br />
concern for Far North Queensland. You know, most obviously with the<br />
Reef, the Daintree rainforest, we've now got a review going in<br />
Shoalwater Bay and I had the pleasure this morning of launching the<br />
strategic plan fo'r the Reef which, of course, goes to questions such as<br />
development which effects us. So, Commonwealth interest in this is<br />
pretty manifest, pretty profound.<br />
J: environmental impact study on..<br />
PM: Well, again, there are processes for considering these things and we'll<br />
give it appropriate it will have due process attached to it. That is, if<br />
there is a heritage issue here in terms of the World Heritage area and<br />
where the Commonwealth needs to make a decision, well then a<br />
process will ensue in the normal course of events it's not a<br />
Commonwealth matter.<br />
J: How long will it take to get some answer..<br />
PM: I don't know, but I mean, again, the Commonwealth is only involved<br />
here on the basis that if there is in some way an area of the heritage<br />
area in which some authority by the Commonwealth is necessary<br />
which would bring the Commonwealth into it. I mean, because the<br />
Commonwealth has got such a great environmental record, every<br />
environmental issue that becomes a problem around Australia,<br />
everyone says ' oh, what can the Commonwealth government do for<br />
Well, the answer is we will do where it is appropriate for us to<br />
do. </p>
<p>J: Changing tact on the Federal Airports Corporation, a lot has been said<br />
and written, but very little from yourself. I mean, what is the situation<br />
with the airports, are they going to be sold?<br />
PM: Well, they are in the Budget over the next few years that we will sell<br />
the Authority or those assets which we deem are better serviced by<br />
private ownership. But, again, this will be a process. This is not going<br />
to happen immediately, it will happen over time.<br />
J: But is it shaping up as a battle at Federal Conference. You've got the<br />
Left unions lining up.<br />
PM: At every Federal Conference, there's always got to be one or two<br />
issues that people jockey around. It's part of the sport of it all.<br />
J: Can you tell me Prime Minister, when a decision will be made on the<br />
troops going to Rwanda?<br />
PM: We've sent a team to Rwanda to look at the position and see whether<br />
any plan by the United Nations is feasible and one which is safe for<br />
Australian service people and when we get that report we'll make a<br />
judgement about it.<br />
J: When do you envisage getting that?<br />
PM: It can't be far away.<br />
J: What sort of a role would you anticipate for the troops there?<br />
PM: Well, again, I'll have to see what comes back. If it's a role in protecting<br />
humanitarian efforts, well, it is has to be a well defined, clearly<br />
articulated one by the UN and we would then consider that seriously.<br />
J: There is concern that the Rural Adjustment Scheme won't meet the<br />
drought relief needs of the northc-s more money forthcoming?<br />
PM: Well, I notice the National party running around saying I should be<br />
standing in a paddock in some ' drought affected area see, they are<br />
all show and no substance. I mean, the substance here is is drought<br />
a recurring issue in Australia? And the answer is that it is. And,<br />
therefore, how should we treat it? Well, the Government's view is it<br />
should be treated under the Rural Adjustment Scheme programs<br />
rather than, say, natural disasters' relief because it is not an<br />
intermittent disaster. This is coming now quite regularly with climate<br />
change effects.<br />
J: The drought we have in Central Queensland at the moment isn't<br />
regular. It is the worst in history, there's never been one like it. </p>
<p>PM: I know, but there was one the year before that and one the year<br />
before. I mean, drought is around now in Australia all the time so,<br />
we've said let's try and cover this as a normal recurrence of rural life<br />
and use the Rural Adjustment Scheme to manage it. Now, my<br />
colleague Senator Collins has made clear that we are now going to<br />
review the RAS scheme so that it can adequately deal with the<br />
problems of drought and so that there is rural recourse by the farm<br />
community to assistance there. That, I think, is what we should do<br />
keep the review on the situation and announce a change to the RAS<br />
arrangements between the Commonwealth and the States that actually<br />
does fit the bill.<br />
J: The State governments are saying that the Rural Adjustment Scheme<br />
doesn't address core debt that builds up over the years.<br />
PM: Well, it depends what interest rate it services. I mean, RAS, I think,<br />
from memory can involve subsidies of up to 100 per cent of the interest<br />
rate cost, so effectively it's carrying costs are being met and its real<br />
value declines over time.<br />
J: Prime Minister, the State government this week has appealed to the<br />
Commonwealth for some extra drought assistance. Is that likely to be<br />
met?<br />
PM: We do things systemically. I mean, that's the way if you want<br />
assistance from the Commonwealth it's got to be part of a systemic<br />
program and, I think again, I'm repeating myself, but I think that's<br />
where RAS comes in. But having National party politicians wandering<br />
around drought affected areas, crying crocodile tears about them is not<br />
going to help people. What's going to help is a proper program, well<br />
funded, that actually works.<br />
J: But, producers are saying similar things too. Are they crying crocodile<br />
tears?<br />
PM: No, no, producers are effected, producers have got a genuine interest<br />
in this and, of course, they will be treated genuinely.<br />
J: So, you see no need for you to visit drought affected areas?<br />
PM: No, I've been in drought affected areas all through my political life. I<br />
understand what there are drought affected areas perpetually in<br />
Australia. Now, I can go and visit them and see them and say ' yes,<br />
this is a problem', but what do you do about it? The answer is a<br />
systemic response.<br />
J: On the broader environment, last month John Faulkner sent out a<br />
broad response to issues like setting aside Tasmanian forests<br />
biQdiversity, export wood chip licence controls. Given the criticisni of<br />
that, do you support the thrust and aims ofJohn Faulkner's statement? </p>
<p>PM: Well, we operate as a Cabinet and we develop, over time, forestry<br />
management plans with Tasmania and with New South Wales in<br />
particular, and we adjust these from time to time. Now, we have a<br />
policy on wood chips, we want to get to higher levels of processing<br />
and value added and we've put a requirement on companies in the<br />
industry to do this by a certain time. That is the general direction we<br />
are going in.<br />
J: Prime Minister, the social justice package. Can you tell me when that<br />
is going to be implemented?<br />
PM: Well, I think you had better decode that one. Which particular variant<br />
do you mean?<br />
J: The social justice package itself Mabo?<br />
PM: Well, there isn't a social justice package itself. I mean, there is a Land<br />
fund, which essentially , Mabo is about land. It is not a catcti all<br />
policy for an unlimited amount of funds for so-called social justice<br />
measures. It is about justice for Aboriginal people in their access to<br />
land particularly those who have been dispossessed of land and can't<br />
avail themselves of land under Mabo. Now, we have got the Land<br />
Fund legislation, I introduced it into the Parliament about two and a<br />
half weeks ago and that will lay on the table of both Houses of<br />
Parliament and be debated in the spring session of the Parliament. I<br />
am confident that it will pass notwithstanding the miserable opposition<br />
of the Liberal and National parties to it. Now, when it does pass that<br />
will be a great leap forward for social justice for Aboriginal people in<br />
this country because they'll have access to land via Mabo where they<br />
can make traditional connections to the land and where that<br />
traditional connection can't be made, owing to their dispossession,<br />
they can avail themselves of land under the land package.<br />
Now, beyond that, there may be some other issues which the<br />
Commonwealth may involve itself in in respect of social justice or<br />
heritage issues for Aboriginal people, but that's down the track.<br />
J: Just going back to privatisation, Brian Howe is skating on thin ice with<br />
the comments..<br />
PM: Well, he has made his comments in the context of the Cabinet's<br />
decision to do these things.<br />
ends. </p>
