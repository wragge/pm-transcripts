    <content><![CDATA[<p><strong>PRIME MINISTER: </strong>We are natural and complementary partners and our vision is to build on those long standing links to make innovation a key part of that relationship.</p>
<p>We witnessed an agreement to establish, yesterday, six new joint research centres. Researchers in industries in both countries supported by both Governments will work to solve shared challenges.</p>
<p>There have been strong commitments made on this visit. The University of New South Wales Torch Innovation Precinct and the Torch High Technology Development Centre will co-host Australian and Chinese industry partners, researchers and investors to drive development and commercialisation of new technologies.</p>
<p>And just now, we’ve seen the $10 million collaborative research agreement between the CSIRO and the Technology Transfer Hub in Foshan, which as you’ve heard is a part of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. Both are going to focus on commercialising close to market clean energy and biotechnology solutions.</p>
<p>Again, commercialisation industrial application is a key part of my Government’s National Innovation and Science Agenda. We have some of the greatest scientists and researchers in the world. One of the things Australia has not done well enough at is commercialising that research. There’s been inadequate levels of collaboration between industry and business – and we’re changing that. All of our policies in our National Innovation Agenda are calculated to drive stronger collaboration and deeper connection with industry.</p>
<p>Now, we will also establish here, as part of that focus on collaboration and commercialisation, a new Australian intellectual property counsellor, here, to be based in Beijing in China and that’ll strengthen our engagement with China on intellectual property issues and support Australian companies as they do business here, taking advantage of the new opportunities presented through the China-Australia Free Trade Agreement.</p>
<p>And I’d say again, as I did in Shanghai, I’m so proud to be here as the first Prime Minister, Australian Prime Minister, to visit China after the entry into force of the China-Australia Free Trade Agreement. The enthusiasm that that has generated – the trade that has generated – the optimism – the innovation – is really remarkable and those of you that were with us in Shanghai at that lunch for 1,800 people will have seen the energy in the room.</p>
<p>So we’re looking forward to a bright future of creative partnerships that harness our complementary strengths in science and technology to drive growth and generate for both our countries the next wave of economic prosperity in these the most exciting times in human history.</p>
<p>Thank you very much.</p>
