    <content><![CDATA[<p>Thank you Mr Bartholomeus, Reverend Semmier, my parliamentary colleagues Trish Draper, Chris Pyne and Joe Scalzi, Mr Mayor, ladies and gentlemen.  It';s a beautiful Adelaide morning and it';s a great pleasure to be with you and to share a few moments in opening these new facilities, which are the product of wonderful work of Lutheran Aged Care here in South Australia.</p>
<p>  Let me say how much I admire, and the Government admires, the contribution that over the years church-based aged care facilities have made to the caring of the aged in Australia.  They have in so many ways been the example that has been followed by others, and I hope for years into the future, whenever we think in Australia of aged care facilities, we think automatically of the contribution that has been made by so many of the churches and other religiously connected organisations, to the care of the aged in Australia.</p>
<p>  In common with all other societies that are like Australia, we are an ageing country.  The demographics are unmistakable.  The number of people over the age of 65 will grow as the years go by and the proportion of people of working age will diminish.  This raises a number of challenges for governments well into the future.  One part of that challenge will of course be in the area of aged care facilities.  It is the philosophy of our Government that we should assist people to remain in their own homes as long as is possible, and indeed the great bulk of people are able to realise that goal.  We provide, through the community care packages, increased facilities to assist people to go on living for longer periods of time in their own homes.</p>
<p>  But we also recognise that there will come a point for many people where that is no longer either possible or as a matter of choice, desirable.  And therefore the other element is to provide the appropriate levels of support and the appropriate incentives for the maintenance of a network of aged care facilities, of retirement villages, of hostels and of nursing homes.  And there is no better environment in which to provide those facilities than an environment which is underpinned by the care and the compassion and the commitment through their common faith, of religious-based organisations.  And Lutheran homes are a wonderful example of that and I want to thank you again for the contribution that you have made over the years.</p>
<p>Quite rightly, your Chairman pointed to the Government';s examination of the Hogan Review into the pricing and other aspects of aged care homes.  It is an issue which is in front of the Government literally at the moment, and I can assure you that the recommendations of that committee and the importance that is placed by that committee on the maintenance of proper and reasonable levels of funding from the Commonwealth Government, will be examined very carefully.  We will not walk away from our responsibilities.  We regard the care of the aged, the proper looking after of people who have given so much to this country – as I look out on this audience, I think of a truly heroic generation, many of whom went through a depression and a world war, World War II, were part of the great post World War rebuilding of this country when we welcomed millions of people from other parts of the world and together all of us created the stable, harmonious, modern Australia – we owe your generation a great debt and we will not walk away from that responsibility.</p>
<p>We have of course, as a Government, responsibilities to many sectors of society.  I did an interview this morning and in the space of about 10 minutes on radio, I was asked when are you going to cut tax on this, that and the other, and I was of course asked when are you going to spend some more money, and of course you';ll keep the economy ticking over well and the budget in balance.  Now it';s really quite easy.  You just have to juggle a few balls in the air and it';s extremely easy.  But you understand what I am saying.  It is a juggling act.  We can never satisfy everybody completely all of the time.  We have to make judgements, we have to make choices, but I can assure you that we will conscientiously address the needs of the aged care sector.</p>
<p>Can I just finally say, if I may be permitted to do so at such a gathering as this, to speak of the personal qualities of your two federal representatives who are here today.  I understand that Trish used to work here.  In fact, you have had some very famous people who have worked here over the years.  And she brings to her parliamentary duties, because of her background in caring for people, a great understanding and also her commitment to our services.  And Chris Pyne, in whose electorate this home is located, I also commend to you, to all of you, his great energy and his great commitment and his concern to look after the interests of everybody in the community.  I';m not leaving you out Joe, but you know, they';re just my federal mates and I wanted to say something about them.  But I';m sure you will understand that.  He';s a hard working bloke too and I wouldn';t want anybody to forget that.</p>
<p>But ladies and gentlemen, it';s great to share such a lovely morning with you.  I started off this morning going for a walk along the Torrens River, and as you know I do a lot of walking everywhere in the world, and there isn';t a nicer part of Australia in which to go for a walk than that beautiful Torrens River.  I can see the Adelaide Oval out of the corner of my eye and that sort of keeps me very, very happy.  Very, very happy indeed.  But friends, thank you for having me.  I wish you well.  You are obviously in the very best of care.  And I have great pleasure in declaring these new facilities well and truly open, and long may you all live peacefully and happily in a supportive Christian environment in these wonderful facilities.</p>
<p>  Thank you.</p>
