PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MIEDlIA 23January 1990<br />
EMBARGO lAM1 26 JANUARY 1990<br />
The establishment of a new award in the Australian honours<br />
system allows governments to officially recognise<br />
outstanding service by public service officers and other<br />
government employees.<br />
The first recipients of the new award, the Public Service<br />
Medal, are announced in the Australia Day Honours List.<br />
They include nineteen awards for Federal Government<br />
officers. The Queen recently approved the establishment of the Public<br />
Service Medal on the recommendation of the Government. The<br />
formal regulations for the Medal provide for the<br />
Commonwealth and other governments to make recommendations<br />
for the Medal to the Governor-General.<br />
The dedication, competence and integrity required of public<br />
servants are not always fully appreciated. These qualities<br />
are vital to the community. Public servants serve the<br />
Government and the community in many ways. Their work and<br />
advice for instance, in economic and financial policy,<br />
trade negotiations, or overseas representation can<br />
affect the well-being of the whole community and<br />
Australia's standing in the world. Their commitment and<br />
ability in delivering services can affect the well-being<br />
of individuals in the community. It is in the<br />
nation's interest to have a professional, effective and<br />
highly-motivated public service.<br />
This new award provides a tangible means for governments to<br />
express formal recognition of outstanding and meritorious<br />
service performed for the community and the nation<br />
generally. Officers receiving the first awards on the recommendation<br />
of the Commonwealth Government cover a wide representation<br />
of employees from Administrative Service Officer Class 2 to<br />
Senior Executive Service Level 4 Officers. The of ficers<br />
serve in most States and Territories. Five are women.<br />
The Medal carries an entitlement to the use of the post<br />
nominals " PSM" 1.<br />
Departments and authorities aro encouraged to make<br />
nominations for the PSM. A Committee chaired by the Public<br />
Service Commissioner advises the Minister Assisting the<br />
Prime Minister for Public Service Matters, the Hon Peter<br />
Morris M. P, on all nominations. Mr orris, on behalf of the<br />
Government, makes formal recommend.. ions for the PSM to the<br />
Governor-General. </p>
