COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA<br />
SPEECH BY<br />
The Rt Hon. J. G. GORTON, M. P.<br />
ON<br />
AID TO INDONESI<br />
( Ministerial Statement 1.<br />
[ From the ' Parliamentary Debates', 27 March 1969]<br />
Mr GORTON ( Higgins-Prime Minister)<br />
-by leave-I wish to inform the House<br />
that the Government has dccided to increase<br />
its aid to Indonesia from the $ 12.7m which<br />
is provided this financial year to $ 15m in<br />
1969-70. In addition it has been decided to<br />
commit in advance a total of $ 4m to finance<br />
economic development projects up to an<br />
expenditure of $ 2m in each of the years<br />
1970-71 and 1971-72. The Government<br />
has made this decision at this time in<br />
advance of the Budget for 1969-70 because<br />
Indonesia is still faced with very serious<br />
and highly complicated problems in its<br />
efforts to regain economic stability. The<br />
decision will serve to emphasise once again<br />
the great importance the Government<br />
attaches to helping its closest and largest<br />
neighbours to achieve a proper and adequate<br />
rate of economic growth.<br />
The $ 15m will be used largely to continue<br />
an aid programme of the same kind as has<br />
been established in 1967-68 and 1968-69.<br />
Although I am not able to give specific<br />
details of the programme for 1969-70 until further discussions have been held with the<br />
Indonesian Government I can say that the<br />
funds are intended to be used for programmes<br />
basically the same as those undertaken<br />
in the last 2 years-that is, for<br />
balance of payments support, imports of<br />
commodities, economic development projects<br />
and technical assistance including<br />
offers of training awards in Australia. I<br />
might add that other donor countries are<br />
also making special efforts to assist the<br />
continued rehabilitation and development of<br />
the Indonesian economy. The United States<br />
of America, the Netherlands, Britain and<br />
Belgium have between them so far pledged<br />
approximately $ US181m as aid to Indonesia<br />
in 1969. These pledges are being made<br />
towards meeting Indonesia's requirement<br />
for foreign aid in 1969, which has been<br />
estimated at $ US500m. I present the following<br />
paper:<br />
Aid to Indonesia-Ministerial statement, 27<br />
March 1969<br />
and move:<br />
That the House take note of the paper.<br />
