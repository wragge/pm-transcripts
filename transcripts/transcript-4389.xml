FOR PRESS 8 MAY 1977<br />
EMBARGO; 7.00 p. m. ELECTORATE TALK<br />
Tonight I would like to talk to you about some of the measures<br />
which the Government has already taken to help small businesses<br />
function and prosper for the benefit, not only of themselves,<br />
and their employees, but for the good health of the community as<br />
a whole.,<br />
Small businesses are a significant part of the Australian economy,<br />
employing 40 percent of the workforce. For manly members of the<br />
community there is great satisfaction in being the proprietor<br />
or partner in a small firm despite the often arduous nature of<br />
such a responsibility.<br />
The first of the measures taken by the Government to help small<br />
businesses is the Investment Allowance Scheme. Undler this Scheme<br />
percent of the material cost of a range of new plant and certain<br />
improvements on primary production land, can be deducted from<br />
income for tax purposes. After June 30, 1978, the Special Investment<br />
Allowance will be 20 percent. In both cases, the allowances are<br />
additional to the normal deduction for depreciation on the full<br />
cost of the plant.<br />
Another measure which helps business firms is the special trading<br />
stock valuation adjustment deduction. Under this scheme the rise<br />
in the cost of replacing trading stock, including livestock, is<br />
being taken into account. So far this is partial. For 1976/ 77<br />
the value of stock for tax purposes will be increased by half the<br />
percentage increase in the goods component of the Consumer Price<br />
increase between June 1976 and June 1977. This reform is designed<br />
to protect firms from the impact on their trading produced when<br />
the cost of replacing goods is higher than the amount by which<br />
they have been written off.<br />
The needs of small businesses were particularly in mind when the<br />
Government decided to allow private companies to retain free of<br />
undistributed income tax un to 60 ) ercent of their after-tax business<br />
income. Previously, private companies could keep only 50 percent<br />
of this income without incurring extra tax.<br />
Primary producers are now able to take advantage of a spccial<br />
scheme of income equalisation deposits. To avoid the special<br />
disadvantages that fluctuating income from primary production causes,<br />
they are now entitled to lodge deposits with the Tax Commissioner<br />
to reduce the in~ come on which they pay tax in that year. That income </p>
<p>of course becomes taxable as part of the income for the year<br />
in which it is withdrawn.<br />
The modifications to the averaging system for primary producers<br />
income will also have the effect of lowering the amount of<br />
personal income tax to which they are liable.<br />
All members of the community, of course, benefit from the<br />
indexation of personal income tax which in July will once again<br />
increase the take-home payof all people on the pay-as-you-earn<br />
scales.<br />
All these measures demonstrate the Government's commitment to<br />
creating an economic climate in which businesses, small and large,<br />
can expand and prosper. These benefits which the Government has<br />
enacted are clearly of greater benefit than many of the assistance<br />
measures, such as advice bureaux and the like, which are talked of.<br />
These measures are hard-cash injection into small business<br />
profitability enabling them to invest and create new job<br />
opportunities. Taken together they constitute unprecedented assistance for small<br />
businesses during a period when the rate of inflation is declining<br />
and business profitability rising.<br />
In these circumstances, it is to be expected that business<br />
investment in plant and equipment should be increasing.<br />
It is indeed gratifying to note that this is happening and that<br />
during the calendar year of 1976 investment rose by 18 percent.<br />
The economy is responding to the efforts of a Government which is<br />
dedicated to returning it to economic health.<br />
