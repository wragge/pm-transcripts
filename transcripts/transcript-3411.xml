Press Statement No. 335<br />
September 1974<br />
ROYAL COMMISSION ON AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT ADMINISTRATION<br />
SUBMISSIONS BY PUBLIC SERVANTS<br />
In reply to recent representations about public servants<br />
rights to make submissions to the Royal Commission on Australian<br />
Government Administration, the Prime Minister has informed his<br />
correspondents that the Government itself and the Commission are<br />
anxious that individual public servants should be given every<br />
possible encouragement to come forward with their views.<br />
Mr. Whitlam said: " The Royal Commission was established<br />
in pursuit of the Government's aim of improving Australian<br />
Government Administration and the Government believes that any<br />
submissions individual public servants may wish to make to that<br />
end are to be regarded as being in pursuance of their official<br />
duties. The Government therefore would not wish any obstacle<br />
to be placed in the way of Public Servants making submissions<br />
drawing on information acquired in the course of their duty<br />
except insofar as this might infringe the confidentiality of<br />
personal or business information provided to the Australian<br />
Taxation Office, Australian Bureau of Statistics etc. The Royal<br />
Commission has stated that it would not be necessary for Public<br />
Servants to produce copies of official documents to which they<br />
refer but that where it felt it necessary the Commission would<br />
ask for documents referred to."<br />
Mr. Whitlam ' also said that he was ensuring that advice<br />
on the Government's attitude towards disclosure of information to<br />
the Royal Commission is being made known to the Chief Officers of<br />
all* Departments and to others concerned.<br />
The Prime Minister said the Government considers that<br />
restrictions on freedom of expression of Public Servants and former<br />
Public Servants should be reduced to the minimum necessary for the<br />
conduct of affairs of state and that Public Servants should have<br />
maximum possible freedom to exercise civil and political'rights<br />
enjoyed by other citizens.<br />
