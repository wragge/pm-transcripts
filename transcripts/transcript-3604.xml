Address to the Nation<br />
by the Prime Ministeron 22 January 1975<br />
I'm taking the earliest opportunity to report to<br />
you on the mission abroad which I have just<br />
completed in company with some principal<br />
members of the Australian administration. This<br />
was very much a representative mission because<br />
of the complexity and diversity of the task<br />
we undertook on Australia's behalf. So as well<br />
as my colleague, Mr Lionel Bowen, the Special<br />
Minister of State. I had with me the heads of the<br />
Overseas Trade Department, the Minerals and<br />
Energy Department and the Attorney-<br />
General's Department and senior men of the<br />
Prime Minister's Department, The Department<br />
of Foreign Affairs and the Treasury. The composition<br />
of the team itself indicates something of<br />
the scope of our task.<br />
The really remarkable thing about Australia's<br />
relations with Europe for the past fifteen years<br />
has been the relative lack-almost total absence-<br />
of contact at the highest level. We visited<br />
seven of the nine members of the European<br />
Economic Community. The Common Market as<br />
a whole is our second largest trading partnerafter<br />
Japan. It buys-or refuses to buyagricultural<br />
products as a unit; it acts as one on<br />
our beef or our sugar. Yet we have never before<br />
had head of government contact with the Community.<br />
More than one and a half million Australians<br />
have come to us from the countries we<br />
have visited in Europe. Those countries have<br />
been ignored by Australian Prime Ministers for<br />
fifteen years. One of the countries-<br />
Yugoslavia-is a founder and leader of the nonaligned<br />
world-a significant grouping with<br />
which every country around the Indian Ocean,<br />
except South Africa, is associated. The Soviet<br />
Union is one of the two super powers which<br />
principally hold the fate of all of us in their hands. No Australian Prime Minister had visited<br />
Yugoslavia or the Soviet Union or most of the<br />
other countries visited by my mission; no Australian<br />
Prime Minister had visited the rest since<br />
the fifties.<br />
Only a visit by the head of government enables<br />
us to put our case, our views-to cover the<br />
whole range of policy-as fully and forcefully as<br />
possible. Only a visit by the head of government<br />
compels the countries visited to clarify and coordinate<br />
their own policies towards us. There<br />
has been a decade and a half of mutual neglect<br />
at this level. It was certainly time that we ended<br />
that neglect-stopped taking each other for<br />
granted-and this was very much the time to do<br />
it.<br />
The countries of Europe are among our chief<br />
trading partners, most of them are in every<br />
sense comparable countries. We share trade,<br />
culture, standards and attitudes, technologyand<br />
we share the same economic problems. It is<br />
because we are a great trading nation, because,<br />
like Europe, we are highly industrialised and<br />
highly urbanised that we cannot insulate ourselves<br />
from Europe's economic problems. There<br />
is scarcely another country whose economy depends<br />
more on the trade which passes through<br />
its ports. Most Australians live in cities which<br />
are trading ports. We cannot isolate ourselves<br />
from the world and its problems and particularly<br />
not from Europe and its problems. Economic<br />
isolationism is not an option for Australia. The<br />
impact of world problems is making its presence<br />
in Australia. Australia must have her presence<br />
felt in the world.<br />
The overall result of my mission has been that<br />
we have been able to present Australia's view </p>
<p>thoroughly, comprehensively and authoritatively<br />
on issues that matter in nations that matter.<br />
I don't believe that any sensible Australian<br />
who cares about our standing in the world, our<br />
reputation, our interests, our influence, our<br />
welfare, would question that this work is a crucial<br />
part of the task of any Australian Prime Min<br />
ister. Australia's economic strength-and this is just<br />
the time when we should be concentrating on<br />
our strengths-lies in our resources. It is a matter<br />
of history that a great deal of these resources<br />
fell under overseas control in the 1 960' s. There<br />
is one resource that is still predominantly in<br />
Australian hands-uranium. I found immense<br />
interest amongst the industrial nations of<br />
Europe in the purchase of Australian uranium,<br />
and therefore, deep interest in the policy of the<br />
Australian Government. I made it clear that we<br />
are anxious to ensure that we are able to<br />
develop our resources with the maximum Australian<br />
ownership. A number of European coun<br />
tries are keen to co-operate with us in the<br />
uranium enrichment process as, of course, is<br />
Japan. Australia's top officials have now been<br />
with me to each of these countries. Our policies<br />
ensure that very soon Australia will be earning<br />
more from her energy resources than she ever<br />
got from wool.<br />
Everywhere I stressed Australia's support for<br />
international co-operation in reducing world<br />
tensions and for the exercise of restraint by the<br />
great powers. I urged the widening and<br />
strengthening of the great movement for<br />
detente. I urged fuller and wider support for the<br />
Nuclear Non -Proliferation Treaty which a<br />
number of countries have yet to ratify. I urged<br />
this course particularly in countries seeking to<br />
buy our uranium. I stressed out belief-strongly<br />
shared by the three Indian Ocean nations I visited-<br />
that the Indian Ocean must not become a<br />
scene of competition or confrontation between<br />
the great powers.<br />
I do want Australians to understand the<br />
remarkable transformation in Australia's standing<br />
and place and prestige in the past two years.<br />
We are in the extraordinarily enviable situation<br />
of having warm, meaningful, mature relations<br />
with all the powers and groupings of relevance<br />
to us. This has been achieved without damaging<br />
old friendships. It has been achieved not by being all things to all men, but precisely because<br />
we put our views clearly and firmly and<br />
stood by them. This visit was necessary to com<br />
plete the pattern-it was a crucial part of the<br />
pattern of relationships we have built over the<br />
last two years. Of course my reception abroad<br />
was personally gratifying, but one just cannot<br />
fail to be heartened by the warmth, the reality of<br />
the interest and respect towards Australia. It<br />
was, for instance, made very manifest again<br />
and again when I resumed my visit after coming<br />
home at the time of the Darwin disaster.<br />
And, of course, the interest in Australia isn't<br />
lessened by the fact that these countries, those<br />
of them who share similar systems and economies,<br />
are experiencing exactly the same<br />
difficulties we are now passing through. Just<br />
before I visited the EEC, the heads of government<br />
of the nine member countries had met to<br />
discuss together their economic problemsunemployment<br />
and inflation-the very same<br />
problems I discussed with seven of them separately.<br />
With all the Western leaders I shared this<br />
common concern. And always the underlying<br />
theme was the recognition that the greatest<br />
danger is loss of nerve on the part of leaders or<br />
peoples. I am confident that the Australian<br />
qualities universally admired abroad will<br />
guarantee that there will be no breakdown here.<br />
During the past five weeks the Parliament was<br />
in recess; the Government certainly was not. It<br />
has been active and alert and will continue to<br />
be. The whole economic measures I announced<br />
in November are now in operation, though the<br />
effect won't show in the figures this month or<br />
next month. We've got under active consideration<br />
the whole range of options open to us, but<br />
it needs cool, steady judgment. We will be applying<br />
it in the weeks and months to come,<br />
strengthened in the knowledge, confirmed by<br />
my visit, that in no sense is Australia alone-not<br />
alone in the diff iculties of the time and above all,<br />
not alone in the world-a world where we enjoy<br />
immense goodwill. </p>
