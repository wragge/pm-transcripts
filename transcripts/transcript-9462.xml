PRIME MINISTER<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P. J. KEATING, MP<br />
AUSTRALIA DAY 1995<br />
ADDRESS GIVEN TO THE AUSTRALIAN OF THE YEAR AWARDS, SYDNEY,<br />
JANUARY 1995 CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY<br />
* EMBARGOED UNTIL 8. OOPM, 25 JANUARY 1995*<br />
This last year has been a good one for Australia and for Australians.<br />
Think of the individual success: in sport, the unprecedented triumphs at the<br />
Commonwealth Games, great performances at the World Championships,<br />
Kieran Perkins, Cathy Freeman, the Kangaroos, the wallabies, the cricket team;<br />
and in the arts, the Australian Ballet triumphing in Washington, the Australian<br />
Opera in Edinburgh, Priscilla and Muriel's Wedding in Cannes, Toronto, New<br />
York, everywhere.<br />
Meanwhile the Australian economy grew faster than that of any other developed<br />
country.<br />
And whatever necessities of careful management such growth may impose upon<br />
us, growth is without question what we want.<br />
We want it to get unemployment down and employment up; and we managed to<br />
do that, too. In fact we have seen 450,000 jobs created in the past eighteen<br />
months, and long term unemployment has fallen and fallen much faster than<br />
after any other recession in our history.<br />
Our obligation to unemployed Australians and those who will be seeking to enter<br />
the workforce in the next few years obliges us in turn to keep the growth going. </p>
<p>We must also remain true to those principles of fairness and equality which we<br />
have always held to be definitively Australian.<br />
The truth is Australians do hold to them and that fact continues to shape the<br />
way we are. It shapes policy. The Australian community would not let an<br />
Australian government leave the unemployed behind: the radical steps that<br />
were taken to bring them with us in last year's White Paper, Working Nation,<br />
were taken in response to that sentiment.<br />
This remains one of the great things about Australia: the weight of public opinion<br />
continues to come down on the side of that broad set of values we summarise as<br />
the " fair go".<br />
Through all the changes in the shape of our economy the imperatives of<br />
international competition, and against the ideological tide of unrestrained selfinterest<br />
which pervaded the 1980s, in Australia the notion has persisted that the<br />
pursuit of personal success ought to be balanced by care for others, self-interest<br />
by the common interest.<br />
We have had a perfect example of this in the last year.<br />
The extraordinary public response to the drought was a heartwarming reflection<br />
of Australia's national consciousness; it was also a persuasive reply to anyone<br />
who believes that individualism and materialism, or global mass culture, or state<br />
parochialism, or multiculturalism has replaced our sense of belonging to one<br />
nation and with it our national identity and national feeling.<br />
It was also reassuring'evidence that a common sentiment continues to flow<br />
between the city and the bush, that the legend lives on, that the bush and its<br />
recurring themes her beauty and her terror, as someone once said still grip<br />
our imagination.<br />
The bush is undoubtedly one of our great challenges: probably our most<br />
profound duty to the Australians of the next century is to leave the land both<br />
more productive and intact.<br />
That means we have to establish a regime of sustainable development across<br />
the country: the process has started and, what is most satisfying, the impetus is<br />
coming in large part from farmers and farming communities from the regions.<br />
Sustainable development clean profitable Australian industries for the twentyfirst<br />
century allied to a concerted effort to conserve and restore the natural<br />
environment will need to be a national effort, and between now and the end of<br />
the century that is what we can make it. </p>
<p>Regional Australia has an essential role to play.<br />
In fact, this seems to me one of the most significant contemporary developments<br />
in the life of Australia: the regions are developing a life and identity of their own.<br />
They are developing futures of their own.<br />
They are defining themselves in terms of their unique advantages and the niches<br />
they can find in the modern Australian and international economies.<br />
It is a development we certainly should encourage; not only because it will be to<br />
the nation's economic advantage, but because the more varied and vibrant the<br />
regions become, the more people will be drawn into our national life and the<br />
richer and stronger will be the cultural and social fabric of Australia.<br />
A revitalised regional Australia has the potential to enliven and enlarge our<br />
national life in ways comparable to the role played by immigration and<br />
multiculturalism.<br />
The lesson is the same there is strength in diversity: and in the tolerance, care<br />
and imagination required to build and maintain it; in the mixture of mutual aid<br />
and self-reliance on which modern multicultural Australia has been built; in other<br />
words, in our best traditions.<br />
It seems to me that in this era of unprecedented and necessary change change<br />
which we must make ourselves and changes which will inevitably be foisted on<br />
us it is essential that we hang on to these traditions, remind ourselves of them,<br />
teach them to our children.<br />
Nothing has ever served us better, and or will serve us so well in the future, as<br />
these things which are grown from our own experience.<br />
I need hardly say that that is why, I think, we should be teaching these values in<br />
our schools; why Australians of every generation and every national and cultural<br />
background should know something of Australian history and tradition; why our<br />
national symbols and institutions should more unambiguously reflect them; why<br />
we really must, before the end of this century, appoint for the first time an<br />
Australian as our Head of State.<br />
There has always been a dark side to Australian egalitarianism, of course: we<br />
have had this tendency to hack at tall poppies.<br />
It is hard to say whether in general this thwarts ambition or makes it burn all the<br />
fiercer. Those Australians I mentioned who have succeeded so brilliantly in the<br />
past year, suggest the latter. </p>
<p>Better still, perhaps it means the tendency is fading.<br />
The crucial thing is to keep up the ambition of Australians, encourage their<br />
creativity, delight in their invididual efforts and acheivements and not just in<br />
sport and the arts, but in science and technology, business, in service to the<br />
nation and its people and yet maintain the ties that bind us to this country, to<br />
our communities, our families, our human values.<br />
In the next year, as in every other one, we may expect to hear daily examples of<br />
where we are failing, where we are going wrong, where we should do better.<br />
In all this criticism there will be one consistent theme the voice which, in<br />
various guises, urges us to abandon our collective egalitarian values in the<br />
name of liberating the forces of rugged individualism.<br />
We will hear it in debates about unemployed Australians, Aboriginal Australians,<br />
Australian women. We will hear it in debates about the economy, the<br />
environment, the arts, health and education.<br />
We should of course heed all reasonable criticism and never lapse into<br />
complacency. But nor should we forget that very few countries have managed so well in the<br />
difficult art of balancing individual freedom with collective responsibility and<br />
collective strength. And we should not forget that, largely as a result of this, few<br />
countries are so good to live in and have so much potential to get better.<br />
That might be the lesson to draw from our commemmoration this year of the end<br />
of World War II. For all the countless individual acts of initiative, heroism and<br />
sacrifice, what we remember most of all is a great collective effort a communal<br />
effort in a common cause.<br />
I think that is always the way in the end real success depends on finding what<br />
we have in common, because in the end it depends on all of us.<br />
So in congratulating the Young Australians of the Year and the Australian of the<br />
Year I am inclined to say that perhaps tomorrow all Australians might take a bow<br />
and resolve to make this year even better than the last. </p>
