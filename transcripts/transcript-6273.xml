TRANSCRIPT OF PRESS CONFERENCE, AUSTRALIAN HIGH COMMISSION,<br />
NEW DELHI, 23 NOVEMBER 1983<br />
PM: It seemed to me that what might be most useful to you were<br />
iff I were to go through, not every detail but the outline of the<br />
contribution that I made and relate it to the proposals that were<br />
contained in Mr. Trudeau's opening submissions.<br />
So going first of all through the contribution I made I went in<br />
opening to the dimension of the problem that we're dealing with<br />
when we're talking about the international arms race, that has<br />
reached proportions of about $ 700 billion a year, which is<br />
meaning that every minute of every day about $ 1 1/ 3 million<br />
is being spent on arms. I pointed out, of course, the scandalous<br />
waste of human resources and ingenuity that was involved in that.<br />
I referred to the increasing level of tension between the super<br />
powers in their negotiations, that those relations were<br />
permeated with suspicion and that the between them is becoming<br />
increasingly dangerous.<br />
The context where there had been some attempt to portion blame<br />
I said that it was rather to pursue that in detail. I said<br />
that Australia did not subscribe to the view that the United<br />
States bears the greatest responsibility for the present<br />
difficulties between the super powers. I pointed out that our<br />
western societies are open and that open debate takes place<br />
which often exposes concerns and perhaps some weaknesses. This<br />
sort of thing is not reflected in the Soviet Union, which is<br />
pursuing the armaments program with unprecedented proportions.<br />
I made the point that in my discussions with the United States<br />
administration at the higest level, I believed them to be sincere<br />
in wanting to bring a halt to the arms race. I asserted that<br />
Australia does not accept the position that the nuclear weapons<br />
states alone should have the right to determine these issues,<br />
that their calculations indeed their miscalculations can effect<br />
us all and indeed could eliminate us all. The Australian<br />
Government does not accept that unilateral disarmament is a<br />
viable option in bringing about an end to the arms race. What is<br />
required are realistic and concrete and balanced proposals which<br />
have at their heart a recognition of national security interests. / 2 </p>
<p>I pointed out that as far as Australia is concerned, our security<br />
interests require collective arrangements for our defence and we<br />
have such an arrangement in the ANZUS alliance. I pointed out<br />
that we clarified the nature of that alliance and that it has<br />
been accepted by the three treaty partners.<br />
I pointed out that a consequence of our security arrangements<br />
with the United S-tates need the presence on Australian soil of<br />
joint facilities. They play a positive role in maintaining<br />
western security and they also have a significant role in<br />
verifying arms control and disarmament agreements.<br />
. I pointed out that this government has greatly elevated arms<br />
control and disarmament goals within our foreign policy, that we<br />
are a member of the multi-lateral disarmament negotiating body<br />
and that in those bodies we are promoting a negotiation of<br />
treaties to end nuclear testing, to ban chemical weapons and<br />
prevent an arms race in outer space.<br />
In the wider political arena we are using what influence we have<br />
to convince the super powers to moderate their antagonism and<br />
to improve their levels of understanding.<br />
I pointed out that disarmament objectives are guided by the three<br />
following principles security for all states at the lowest<br />
possible level of armament, stabilit~ y in nuclear balance, and an<br />
adequate verification of disarmament agreements. In line with<br />
those objectives we are attaching a particular priority to<br />
efforts aimed at securing nuclear disarmament through reductions<br />
in the nuclear arsenals, the upholding of the international<br />
non-proliferation regime and the conclusion of complete bans on<br />
nuclear testing. I also referred to our proposal for a nuclear<br />
free zone in the South Pacific.<br />
I said that adequate protective provisions and verification is<br />
the crucial pre-condition of progress in the area that we're talking<br />
about and that Australia would wish to encourage and support<br />
action in that field and I pointed out in particular in considering<br />
our own capabilities, we are activel. y examining the possibility of<br />
improving Australia'* s capacity to monitor nuclear explosions by<br />
further developing our seismic monitoring capability.<br />
That was in the area of verification. I said the problem of<br />
proliferation is, of course, more difficult and that fact was indeed<br />
reflected in the discussion which had taken place within the<br />
conference to the point of my intervention.<br />
They acknowledged there is no fool-proof means of preventing<br />
proliferation of nuclear explosives, but we believe that the<br />
process can and should be slowed down and the cost to the<br />
proliferator increased.<br />
I pointed out that in the context of any discussion about the<br />
non-proliferation of nuclear weapons, an issue of particular<br />
concerni to Australia and I would have thought to all of those<br />
gathered, was the position of South Africa. While the concept of<br />
aparthc~ id was totally opposed, it woulc utterly unacceptable<br />
if apartheid were to becomie nuclear armed and that we all hiad a<br />
vested interest in ensurini tlial-THiaL did not occur. </p>
<p>I said that we believed that the non-proliferation treaty should<br />
remain a cornerstone of international effort to prevent the<br />
spread of nuclear weapons and despite the view expressed by some,<br />
that this was an inadequate treaty, it is the only game in town,<br />
as someone else said. I pointed out that we went further than<br />
that, of course, and we recognised our obligation under the<br />
non-proliferation treaty, particularly article IV which had been<br />
referred to in the recent debate in our party and in our government<br />
and we recognised our obligation under Article IV of the NPT as a<br />
producer and exporter of uranium to facilitate and participate in<br />
the exchange of equipment, materials and information for the<br />
peaceful use of atomic energy.<br />
We believe, in that context, that we have a particu ' lar responsibility<br />
to secure improvement in international safeguards against the<br />
diversion of nuclear material from peacefu. uses. I pointed out<br />
further that we supported the proposition for a comprehensive test<br />
ban treaty and that we were one of the main promoters in the United<br />
Nations of a negotiation of such a treaty.<br />
I then went on to a point which hadn't been touched in the<br />
discussion and which I believe insufficient attention is paid to<br />
and that is that chemical and biological weapons are second only<br />
to nuclear weapons in their capacity to inflict death and human<br />
suffering on a massive scale and I put the view that Australia<br />
believes that it is especially important that relative international<br />
conventions be strengthened and I drew attention to the disappointing<br />
fact that only 2/ 3 of the Commonwealth members are parties for<br />
the relevant 1925 protocal of chemical warfare and less than 2/ 3<br />
agreed to the 1972 biological weapons convention.<br />
I finally drew attention to our concern that the arms race should<br />
not extend into outer space, with the prospect of the extension<br />
of the nuclear arms race into that arena is frightening in its<br />
possibilities. I concluded by saying that I thought the<br />
Commonwealth could play a constructive role in disarmament and in<br />
reducing tensions and in that context let me say that I<br />
supported the idea that had been advanced by Pierre Trudeau in his<br />
opening submission-. Essentially, the Trudeau proposal is that<br />
there should be a five power conference of the nuclear powers and<br />
that there should be an agreement between them as to an appropriate<br />
ratio of the nuclear weapons that they should hold and on the basis<br />
of that agreement then a reduction down on the basis of that ratio<br />
and in dealing with vertical proliferation in that way, it should<br />
be realted to the objectives of the NPT, which, as he pointed out,<br />
in its conception was in the form of a compact. That is that if<br />
the nuclear powers would agree to a reduction of their weapons, in<br />
return the other nations could become signatories to the NPT and<br />
agre ' e themselves not to acquire the capacity for nuclear weaponry.<br />
Now, he pointed out that the question of the NPT came up for<br />
reconsideration in 1985, that he had had some discussions already<br />
with Mrs. Thatcher, President Mitterrand and that he was intending<br />
to have discussions with the Chinese, the Akmericans and the Soviets.<br />
I expressed the view, on behalf of Australia, that any initiative<br />
in this area was to be welcomed and that we were prepared to<br />
welcome that. There was a view expressed in the conference that it<br />
/ 4 </p>
<p>was not appropriate to proceed along that path at this stage<br />
and that more work had to be done in general preparatory<br />
bilateral with the Soviets and China before going to the point<br />
of a five power conference. I expressed the view that there<br />
may be a possibility of narrowing that sort of thought of<br />
more preparatory work with the Trudeau concept of a five power<br />
conference. I think, Ladies and Gentlemen, that covers essentially the<br />
contribution that I made. The discussion for today concluded<br />
after 5. It will resume tomorrow. It may be then that I will<br />
make a further contribution in the debate.<br />
May I just make this point, which is totally unrelated to today's<br />
events, but some information. I will be having lunch tomorrow<br />
with Lee Kuan Yew and Foreign Minister Dhanabalan from Singapore<br />
and Foreign Minister Chazali from Malaysia.<br />
JOURNALIST: Where will you have the lunch?<br />
PM: It will be here in the High Commissioner's residence.<br />
JOURNALIST: ( inaudible)<br />
PM: Well, there may be. I would like it and I'll see if it can<br />
be done.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, could you place in context the<br />
discussions today on disarmament and the Trudeau initiative which<br />
you've welcomed, with the news today that the Russians have<br />
walked out of the INF talks in Geneva without setting a date for a<br />
return. PM: I suppose obviously that is not a propitious sign, but that is<br />
; hat had been signalled by the Soviet. If the United States went<br />
ahead with its proposals for the Cruise and Pershing missiles<br />
in Europe, I guess in that sense it is not surprising. I would<br />
believe that after a period of indication of such protests that<br />
the discussions will resume next year and I base that upon the<br />
fundamental proposition that ultimately it is not in the interests<br />
of the Soviet Union or any of the super powers to have to be<br />
expending such an enormous and increasing proportion of their<br />
capacity upon this build up of the nuclear arsenal. I think that<br />
basic reality will come to bear in~ the way which will mean the<br />
resumption of talks. Whether in the foreseeable future it means<br />
that the Trudeau concept of the five power conference is<br />
achievable, it is far too early to say.<br />
JOURNALIST: Does your Government support the deployment of the<br />
Cruise and Pershing missiles in Europe. How do you square that<br />
with what you were saying today, if you do?<br />
PM: Well, you may have noted that I said two things which are<br />
relevant to that. I said the Soviet Union has pursued an armiaments<br />
program of unprecedented proportions. The cause of the problem<br />
in Europe was the original deployment by the Soviet Union of the </p>
<p>and there is no way in which realistically in this world,<br />
you can talk about a unilateral move towards disarmament. Nor<br />
will a situation be likely to reach be productive of a general<br />
reduction if one side thinks that it is in a position of<br />
relative inferiority and so there is nothing at all inconsistent<br />
with what I've been saying today and those facts. Indeed, they<br />
are totally consistent with and reflect the basic propositions<br />
that I've put.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, can I ask you what Australia will be<br />
doing in terms of increasing its ability to note nuclear<br />
disturbances by seismic means, first of all. Secondly could I<br />
ask you do you have confidence that the Trudeau initiative won't<br />
die a death like the initiative of North-South dialogue which<br />
was so prominent a couple of years ago.<br />
PM: In regard to the first question, all I can say to you is<br />
Uiiat technical work is proceeding to increase our capacity in that<br />
area of seismic monitoring and I don't pretend to bring across<br />
the technical detail. In regard to the second, I can't say and<br />
nor can any reasonable person say that that proposal of the<br />
Canadian Prime Minister will not die the same sort of death as<br />
other proposals. Of course I can't say that, but I take the<br />
view, and I think it would be the view of the great majority of my<br />
fellow Australians, that any initiative is worthwhile because<br />
I mean it is an obsenity how long have we been going now<br />
about let's say 30 minutes that in that time $ 40 million has<br />
been spent on the armaments race. It is just so clear that this<br />
would be an infinitely better world if we could have a conversion<br />
of a part of these resources. Now, if we took the view in<br />
respect of any initiative that it may fail and therefore we don't<br />
try that just doesn't seem to me to be the way we should go<br />
about things.<br />
JOURNALIST: We were told there was a move by some<br />
countries for other Commonwealth countries to join Mr. Trudeau<br />
in what remains of his mission. What is your view of other<br />
Commonwealth nations joining and is there any thought of<br />
Australia sending someone along?<br />
PM: Well, you've obviously heard something about it. One of the<br />
participants suggested other nations may be involved two or<br />
three others and our name was mentioned. Let me make it quite<br />
clear in respect of that. It was a hypothetical observation made<br />
by one of the participants. There was no specific proposal. If<br />
such a proposal were made, then, of course, we would consider it.<br />
JOURNALIST: You'll have the opportunity in January, Prime<br />
Minister, of talking to the Chinese. Do you think you're likely<br />
to raise that then?<br />
PM: Well, there is an interesting conjunction of time on that.<br />
Thie Chinese Premier is going to be in Canada about the middle<br />
of January, at the time of his visit to the United States. I've<br />
been talking to Prime Minister Trudeau and I believe he would<br />
keep me informed of those discussions and it may be that when I<br />
go to China just a couple of weeks after that, I may be able to<br />
assist in some way in picking up the threads of that discussion. / 6 </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Can we interpret from that, PM, that you will<br />
make, whatever diplomatic effort we can to assist the implementation<br />
of the Trudeau initiative?<br />
PM: Yes, I made it clear in there that I believe that there was<br />
a need to marry the sort of approach of Mr. Trudeau to that which<br />
was put by another speaker. I mentioned of the need to be far<br />
more preparatory-with bilateral work, particularly with the Soviet<br />
bloc countries before you got to the stage of seeking a five<br />
power conference. But if there is anything I could do to help the<br />
concept, of course, we would do it. But let me emphasise, so<br />
that I don't want to bdlt it up as there may be a plan to do.<br />
It was a very low key sort of response because I think it's a<br />
very ambitious concept that Mr. Trudeau has put forward. It is<br />
worthy of support, but without deluding ourselves, it is<br />
something easy of achievement. If there is something we can do<br />
to help, we will do it.<br />
JOURNALIST: There was some suggestion of talks of a possible<br />
Commonwealth security umbrella for some of the smaller countries.<br />
Did you address yourself to that particular idea at all. If<br />
you didn't can you tell us what our views on that are now?<br />
PM: No, I didn't and I must say it was put in passing by one<br />
speaker. It would be quite to suggest that it was advancing<br />
a serious and developed proposition.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mrs. Gandhi, Prime Minister, seemed pretty critical<br />
of Grenada and the events that occurred over there. There seemed<br />
to be implicit criticism of the United States. Was Grenada at<br />
all raised today?<br />
PM: No, the way the discussion has been structured was really<br />
that Pierre Trudeau introduced the matter and it was basically<br />
around the area of the arms race and what could be done in that<br />
area and there was agreement that the more specific items,<br />
including Grenada would be the subject of particular discussions<br />
later on.<br />
JOURNALIST: Quickly, Prime Minister, whose initiative was the<br />
meeting with the Malaysian and Singaporean delegates?<br />
PM: We raised the question and, as I understand it I haven't<br />
been engaged in the discussion I think they were more than<br />
happy about it and were probably expecting that we would have a<br />
meeting. JOURNALIST: Did you come up with any suggestion about how<br />
Australia's Ambassador for Disarmament could play a greater role<br />
in the Trudeau initiatives or any other Commonwealth moves?<br />
PM: No, but I would believe that if anything were to develop in<br />
this area, obviously having a person particularly charged with<br />
responsibility in this area would be useful in maximising our<br />
capacity to do something and we would use him. </p>
<p>7.<br />
JOURNALIST: On the question of germ warfare, Mr. Hawke, will<br />
Australia be trying to seeking that part or put that in the<br />
communique which will be delivered next week other<br />
countries to sign those treaties you were talking about.<br />
PM: The question of the communique and how it is done is a matter<br />
still to be decided. You will appreciate there is a problem<br />
about communiques, as to whether you have a relatively short<br />
document of general political intent which everyone can agree with,<br />
or whether you have a much longer document where every sort of<br />
items that has been mentioned by participants is included. At<br />
this stage there is no decision about that. Speaking for myself,<br />
it seems to me and I said this at the end of my contribution<br />
I said at the end of this debate it is very likely that you are<br />
all going to have to say if we are honest we are all going to<br />
have to say to one another, well, what is there that is concrete<br />
that has come out of it. It was in that sense that I said that<br />
a move of support by those who haven't signed the 1925 protocol<br />
and the 72 treaty that adherance to that would be something<br />
specific and worthwhile and that we were working towards a new<br />
treaty to expand the 1925 protocol. Now, they may feel that it<br />
is worth giving some specific mention to that. It's too early to<br />
say.<br />
JOURNALIST: Can I ask a domestic question, Prime Minister?<br />
PM: Yes.<br />
JOURNALIST: The NSW Premier has apparently said today that the<br />
$ 30,000 limit on the assets test is too low for NSW Property values<br />
and will be seeking a response from you on your return. Do you<br />
have any<br />
PM: Sure, I'll always be prepared to talk with the Premier of<br />
NSW. He is a political colleague and a close friend and I'll<br />
be more than happy to talk with him. </p>
