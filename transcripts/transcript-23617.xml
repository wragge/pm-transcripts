    <content><![CDATA[<p>Ensuring our streets, homes and communities are safe will take tough and effective measures to assist the fight against crime.</p>
<p>Taking a national approach to gun-related crime is one measure that will help make communities safer.</p>
<p>New legislation will be introduced this month to target gun-related crimes that will implement minimum mandatory five year jail terms for illegal firearm trafficking.</p>
<p>The Australian Crime Commission estimates there are 250,000 illicit âlong armsâ and at least 10,000 illicit hand guns in Australia.</p>
<p>Even a small number of illegal firearms can have a significant impact on crime on our streets.</p>
<p>The Government will target gun traffickers and criminals who move firearms and firearm parts into and out of Australia.</p>
<p>Anyone caught in the illegal firearms trade will face mandatory minimum sentences of five years under the new regime. Light sentencing sends the wrong message to criminals.</p>
<p>Police officers are putting themselves at risk to serve members of the public and they need the publicâs backing, especially from the government.</p>
<p>This is part of our commitment to ensure a safe and secure Australia, with prosperous and strong communities.</p>
