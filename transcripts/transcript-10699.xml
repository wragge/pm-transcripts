<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>[Inaudible]</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well alarmed and like all Australians we feel very much for our</p>
<p>   fellow country men and women who....one case a life lost, left</p>
<p>   homeless. Any additional assistance that is needed from the Commonwealth</p>
<p>   Government will be made available. There are normal disaster relief</p>
<p>   arrangements and they are automatically triggered but if anything</p>
<p>   further is needed well, naturally, I'll cooperate fully with</p>
<p>   the New South Wales Premier. And I can only say on behalf of all</p>
<p>   Australians that our thoughts are very much with the people of Wollongong.</p>
<p>   It is a one in three hundred year event, an extraordinary development</p>
<p>   and we are thinking very much of them in their hour of difficulty.</p>
<p>   The emergency services, again, have been quite outstanding....</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>It's been a tough winter hasn't it?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>It's been a very tough winter for emergency services but I</p>
<p>   have just got to say on behalf of all Australians, we are proud</p>
<p>   of you, of the emergency service personnel, the police, the ambulance</p>
<p>   workers. They have really done us proud and that great Australian</p>
<p>   spirit of cooperating together in adversity has once more been demonstrated.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
