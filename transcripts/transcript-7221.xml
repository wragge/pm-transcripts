PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 13 SEPTEMBER 1987<br />
EMBARGOED UNTIL NOON 13 SEPTEMBER 1987<br />
I will be visiting the United States, Canada, Ireland,<br />
Switzerland and Yugoslavia between 9 and 25 October.<br />
I am looking forward to having informal talks with Secretary of<br />
State Shultz over the weekend of 10 and 11 October in San<br />
Francisco. The talks will follow up the valuable discussions<br />
held during the visit to Australia of Mr Shultz and Secretary of<br />
Defense Weinberger in June and will cover international political<br />
and economic issues, including prospects in United States-Soviet<br />
relations, and bilateral matters. I will make an address to the<br />
Australian-American Chamber of Commerce in San Diego on 9<br />
October. In Canada I will be attending the meeting in Vancouver of<br />
Commonwealth Heads of Government from 13 to 17 October. This<br />
biennial event brings together a wide spectrum of world leaders<br />
for detailed discussions ranging across current political and<br />
economic matters and co-operation in various functional programs.<br />
It will also provide a setting to consolidate and advance<br />
Australia's bilateral relations with other Commonwealth<br />
countries. I very much welcome the opportunity to visit Ireland from 18 to<br />
21 October. Ireland has made an extraordinary contribution to<br />
the Australian identity and is a country with which many<br />
Australians have close personal contacts. As we prepare to<br />
celebrate our Bicentenary, a visit is particularly appropriate.<br />
As a member of the European Community, Ireland's economic<br />
policies are of direct relevance to Australia's interests. In<br />
addition to official talks in Dublin, I hope to see something of<br />
the country and its people.<br />
In Geneva on 22 October, I will meet the head of the US<br />
delegation to the Geneva negotiations on nuclear and space arms,<br />
Ambassador max Kaxnpelman, and address members of the GATT on<br />
trade issues of vital importance to Australia under negotiation<br />
in the Uruguay round.<br />
I will be visiting Yugoslavia from 22 to 25 October for<br />
discussions with Yugoslav leaders. I am looking forward very<br />
much to this visit. The Yugoslav community has made a great<br />
contribution to Australia. Yugoslavia's independent policies and<br />
its views on international political and economic issues are of<br />
considerable importance to us. I hope that my visit will lead to<br />
expanded bilateral co-operation between our countries. 0 0.191 </p>
