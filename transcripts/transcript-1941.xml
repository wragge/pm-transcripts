    <content><![CDATA[<p>1 69/ 158<br />OPENING OF OLYMPIC SWIMMING POOL<br />WOY WOY, N. S. W. 19 OCTOBER 1968<br /><br />Mr. President, Distinguished Guests, Members of Parliament, Ladies<br />and Gentlemen: There has been one lesson I have learnt during theltime<br />that I have been opening various buildin gs, swimming pools and things<br />of that kind. That lesson is that I am usually so pleased and relieved<br />to have reached the end of whatever it is I have to say, and I know that<br />everybody sitting around is so pleased and relieved that I have reached<br />the end of whatever it is I have to say, that I generally forget to declare<br />open whatever it is that is supposed to be declared open! Now somebody<br />has got to remind me on this occasion because there is a button there<br />which I need to press.<br />This occasion has something quite unique about it. Very<br />often one comes along and opens whatever it is, and in fact it has been<br />in use for weeks or even months before one gets there. I gather that on<br />this occasion this pool has not been in use at all and that this really will<br />be an opening. That is another reason for me not to delay too long so<br />all those excited children who want to get in can do so. All of you, too,<br />who I am sure want to get in and se~ e how magnificent it is, will in fact<br />be able to do so. Those members of the Pool Committee, must feel some<br />sense of pride and satisfaction today as their minds go back to the time<br />when they banded together and decided they would do something to help<br />the community in which they live, and as they remember the work that<br />they did and the time that it took. I am sure many evenings were engaged<br />and much travelling was entailed I hope that today they feel a full sense<br />of satisfaction and a full sense that what they have done has been worthwhile,<br />as indeed it has been.</p>
<p><br />We, as Mr. Bridges-Maxwell has said, are going to buildÂ between us all a really great Australian nation for Australians, and thatÂ will require from those of us who are now able to work and from those whoÂ are at school and being taught, that will require a considerable amount ofÂ effort, a considerable amount of concentration, a considerable amount of Â hard work. But a life for a country is no good if the whole of it is engagedÂ in hard work and effort, necessary though that is. There must be roomÂ along the way for play and laughter and gaiety and song as well as the hardÂ work; and for the provision of sporting facilities. such as this pool, or footballÂ ovals or the beaches that you have and I hope will preserve. These areÂ the things which give. to our growing generation that opportunity for healthyÂ recreation, that opportunity for building up their muscles which will in turnÂ enable them to turn their minds and efforts to building a country andÂ advancing it for their children.</p>
<p>paricuar ote think this has been a magnificent effort. I have takenÂ paricuar oteof a suggestion that at some future time I might be invited<br />back. Now that appeals to me not because I have seen much of the ShireÂ of Woy Woy, but because I have felt since I got out of the car today' that I<br />have met a great number of people who are friends and whom I would like<br />to see again if I could come back here. So all I need is an invitation againÂ from the Mayor. Now amnot going to delay you any more. I remember four<br />lines of poetry which my wife keeps dinning into me whenever I am about<br />to become engaged in making a public speech. What she says is: " Listen,<br />look at those people out in front of you and something like this is running<br />through their minds:-<br />" I love the finished speaker<br />I really, truly do.<br />1 don't mean one who's polished<br />I just mean one who's through."<br />And I think it's time I was through and the pool opened. SoÂ I do declare the pool open.. I remembered'</p>
