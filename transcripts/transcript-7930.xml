LAND TRANSPORT STATEMENT 27 FEBRUARY 1990<br />
Labor has given land transport-high priority throughout its<br />
three terms.<br />
The facts are:<br />
Labor undertook and completed the first all-weather<br />
National Highway link around Australia: 16,000<br />
kilometres in all weathers, over all terrains.<br />
This project alone has cost $ 3.7 billion; it is in cost<br />
and scope a greater civil engineering achievement than<br />
the Snowy Mountains Scheme, also a Labor initiative.<br />
The National Highway System has been transformed in the<br />
process with major spending on the Hume, the Newcastle<br />
Expressway, Tasmania's Midland Highway, the<br />
replacement of 90 narrow bridges along the length<br />
of the Bruce Highway, the sealing of the Barkly<br />
Highway and vital works on the range of other<br />
highways which make up the system<br />
Labor has put more than $ 9 billion towards roads in its<br />
seven budgets.<br />
This is 18 per cent higher in real terms than the<br />
previous seven years under the Coalition, representing<br />
an annual average of $ 235 million higher in real terms.<br />
The proportion of total Federal Government revenue from<br />
fuel which is devoted to roads is higher than in the<br />
last year of the previous Government.<br />
Rail, too, has received priority. Labor recognises<br />
that rail is environmentally cleaner, safer and an<br />
integral part of the transportation system of any<br />
nation which relies on bulk handling for a large part<br />
of its export effort. </p>
<p>Australian National, under Labor, has achieved a higher<br />
cost recovery rate than any State railway, reducing its<br />
call on the tax payer by 65 percent in real terms, and<br />
without industrial disputes. Australian National now<br />
makes a profit on its freight network without " taxing"<br />
vital resource industries.<br />
Labor has instituted a National Arterials program to<br />
ensure that the highest priority is given to major<br />
projects of national economic significance which an<br />
individual State on its own would find too large to<br />
handle. Labor has poured $ 730 million into the Hume Highway,<br />
the nation's principal highway in terms of traffic<br />
volumes and value.<br />
Sixty-five per cent of the Hume is now 4-lane standard.<br />
By the end of our fourth term, almost all of the<br />
highway and most of the by-passes will be at this<br />
standard. Victoria in particular is now due to benefit<br />
substantially.<br />
The next term<br />
In our fourth term, Labor will:<br />
Devote SlOO million a year to a new roads program,<br />
financed from the additional 20 percent sales tax on<br />
luxury vehicles recently announced by the Treasurer<br />
The new program will concentrate on roads of major<br />
economic significance outside the capital cities and<br />
will be known as the Provincl1 Cities and Rural<br />
Highways Program<br />
roads projects funded under this new program will<br />
qualify on the grounds of high benefit-cost ratios<br />
Examples of roads or regions where the next Labor<br />
Government may fund appropriate projects, with the<br />
co-operation of relevant State Governents, include:<br />
the Calder and Midland Highways in Victoria<br />
the Lincoln Highway in South Australia,<br />
North Queensland and West of the Divide<br />
Tasmania other major regional roads with high benefit-cost<br />
ratios<br />
The new program will be used to complement the present<br />
nationa arterialg/ roads of national economic<br />
significance program which is aimed at funding major<br />
projects with high benefit-cost ratios and of vital<br />
importance to the national economy </p>
<p>at present, this program is in its early years and<br />
is concentrated in areas such as ring roads in<br />
Melbourne and Perth, the Glebe Island container<br />
terminal bridge; the Liverpool to Hornsby<br />
arterial; and the Gateway arterial in Brisbane.<br />
The debate over the state of the Pacific Highway north<br />
from Newcastle has focussed on suggestions for a<br />
four-lane dual carriageway<br />
such a project is, as I have said recently,<br />
possible under existing funding levels within the<br />
" ten to twenty year" time frame so cynically<br />
stated by National Party spokesmen, provided only<br />
that the State Government accords appropriate<br />
priority using the funds supplied to it by the Commonwealth<br />
and its own funds.<br />
We are prepared to devote funds from this $ 300 million<br />
over the next 3 years to accelerating the Pacific<br />
Highway upgrading should the State Government now<br />
choose to devote to it the highest priority, through<br />
the use of their own funds and exis. Zina Commonwealth<br />
funds. Labor recognises the benefits that rail offers and is<br />
pursuing an integrated rail freight management system.<br />
There is a vital need to upgrade both the north-south<br />
and east-west rail fre-ight corridors to ensure timely<br />
delivery of both exports and " just-in-time" inventories<br />
to ports or distribution centres.<br />
As a result, funds from the new program may also go<br />
towards priority improvements to mainline rail systems<br />
after taking account of State views.<br />
Labor also pledges in its fourth term to continue<br />
active negotiation and implementation of the initiative<br />
to obtain nationally consistent road laws and eliminate<br />
accident black-spots<br />
the commonsense nature of this initiative should<br />
be obvious<br />
truck drivers should have one national licence and<br />
a national demerit system<br />
a drunk is a dangerous driver, no matter where the<br />
State border starts, and<br />
bicycle helmets for children are essential.<br />
The Government renews its call to the States to accept<br />
these proposals, to which the Government last year made<br />
clear it is prepared to devote $ 120 million, over three<br />
years. </p>
<p>The Bottom Line<br />
Over the full term of the next Hawke Government an<br />
additional amount of $ 300 million will be made<br />
available for priority roads or rail projects in<br />
regional areas.<br />
This massive level of new funding will not impact on<br />
the Budget surplus Labor has achieved.<br />
It will be targeted to complement ( not to reduce) our<br />
present emphasis on national arterial projects which<br />
have by their nature more often than not been sited in<br />
major urban centres, and the 16,000 kilometre National<br />
Highway System.<br />
Like all Labor's new commitments during the election<br />
campaign, the new program is fully funded.<br />
This bottom line does not include the benefits of<br />
indexation of existing road funding<br />
indexation will, by itself, add some further<br />
hundreds of millions to Labor's roads funding<br />
efforts over the next three years<br />
these funds are alrpady included in the forward<br />
estimates, as this was a Budget commitment dating<br />
from 1988. </p>
