<p>PRIME MINISTER SHIPLEY:</p>
<p>It's been our great pleasure to welcome Prime Minister Howard</p>
<p> to New Zealand for, what I think he established as a tradition of</p>
<p> these bilateral meetings each year in the respective countries. As</p>
<p> we mentioned in Queenstown the discussions have been wide-ranging,</p>
<p> they've been extremely useful from my own point of view and from</p>
<p> the point of view of my ministers. I'm pleased to report that</p>
<p> the CER relationship is in extremely good heart and there were no</p>
<p> major outstanding issues that required the intense attention of the</p>
<p> prime ministers.</p>
<p>But one of the very useful suggestions that Prime Minister Howard</p>
<p> has come up with, and our government has agreed, in order to pick</p>
<p> up some of the ideas that have come through the weekend's discussions,</p>
<p> is that we should establish or explore how we can establish a prime</p>
<p> ministerial taskforce that deals with the minor outstanding matters</p>
<p> to do with CER. And also investigate the strategic steps forward as</p>
<p> to where CER might go, beyond where we are today. I think that's</p>
<p> an extremely useful idea and is perhaps a good way of taking the next</p>
<p> step on what is a very important relationship, certainly from New</p>
<p> Zealand's point of view.</p>
<p>So Prime Minister welcome again to New Zealand. I valued your insights</p>
<p> on your own economy and its performance, on Timor and on the many</p>
<p> other issues that we've been able to discuss and in particular</p>
<p> the drug issue in relation to New Zealand and Australia and again</p>
<p> I appreciate your willingness for us to continue to collaborate and</p>
<p> talk about and share our knowledge on this matter.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER HOWARD:</p>
<p>Well thank you very much. Can I say for my part how much my wife and</p>
<p> I and other members of the party have enjoyed the hospitality of New</p>
<p> Zealand and New Zealanders, Jenny. It's been a very enjoyable,</p>
<p> a very productive few days. It is a very close relationship, but like</p>
<p> all close friendships it needs to be kept in good repair, and the</p>
<p> best way of doing that is for us to have this regular kind of contact,</p>
<p> to share experiences. I agree very much with the emphasis you have</p>
<p> placed during the weekend on not only CER but also optimising the</p>
<p> opportunity that the APEC meeting here in New Zealand this year presents.</p>
<p> We do need, in the interests of both of our countries, a broadly based</p>
<p> WTO round. In the long run that's the best trade outcome for</p>
<p> Australia and New Zealand. We will bend all of our efforts to achieve</p>
<p> that particular goal. Timor will be the number one foreign policy</p>
<p> challenge for Australia and of particular importance to the entire</p>
<p> region over the next year or two and it was good to have the opportunity</p>
<p> of discussing those things over the last couple of days.</p>
<p>But what I found particularly useful again, as I did two years ago,</p>
<p> was the chance of talking to virtually the entire New Zealand Cabinet</p>
<p> and to have the opportunity at a face-to-face level of exchanging</p>
<p> our experiences. I've noted the significant improvement and very,</p>
<p> very strong performance of the New Zealand economy over the past few</p>
<p> months. I am of course a long-time admirer of many of the economic</p>
<p> reforms that have been undertaken in this country and particularly</p>
<p> of course the labour market reforms and in the 1980s taxation reform,</p>
<p> of which I have a passing acquaintance in Australia. And therefore</p>
<p> we have a lot of experiences to share. I should say that during the</p>
<p> whole time that I've been here nobody has complained to me about</p>
<p> the GST. And I say that for the consumption of the Australian audience</p>
<p> present. Everybody seems very comfortable and relaxed about the GST</p>
<p> here in New Zealand, and not surprisingly. It was a very, very intelligent</p>
<p> economic reform in the 1980s for New Zealand, as it is in the 1990s</p>
<p> for Australia.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister [inaudible]</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER SHIPLEY:</p>
<p>Our own foreign policy position is of course our own. The discussions</p>
<p> over the weekend were how the transition that may occur over the coming</p>
<p> months might be managed and what role New Zealand might play in assisting.</p>
<p> I don't want any confusion to be had about the two issues. New</p>
<p> Zealand always has its own foreign policy position. My comments in</p>
<p> relation to taking advice from Australia is on what particular involvement</p>
<p> might be required to assist in managing any issues that emerge. The</p>
<p> question that was put was about peacekeeping assistance. Both prime</p>
<p> ministers made it clear, it's very premature to be speculating</p>
<p> on that matter, but because Australia is so much closer to the real</p>
<p> issues that may emerge, we would look to them for advice on how we</p>
<p> might logistically assist. On the issue of foreign policy of course</p>
<p> New Zealand makes its own decision, and has its own position.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Do you accept that the Australian [inaudible] and has had in the past</p>
<p> different attitudes to ......</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER SHIPLEY:</p>
<p>Of course. But there's an emerging situation that now requires</p>
<p> a response, and that was the focus of the two prime ministers'</p>
<p> discussions over the weekend.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, on the drugs issue, how do you plan to take advice from</p>
<p> the FBI?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER HOWARD:</p>
<p>Well I'm going to take the opportunity of the visit to Australia</p>
<p> of the Director of the FBI, I think he's seeing me on Friday,</p>
<p> to explore a number of areas. Greater international cooperation between</p>
<p> law enforcement agencies - and one of the benefits that have already</p>
<p> flowed from the extra resources we have put into law enforcement is</p>
<p> that we've had more AFP presence in source countries and that</p>
<p> has aided the process of interception. We obviously want to share</p>
<p> the experiences of the FBI in relation to the role of federal agencies</p>
<p> in combating the drug menace. Many of the programmes that have been</p>
<p> undertaken in the United States in recent years in relation to law</p>
<p> enforcement and rehabilitation have been similar, not identical to,</p>
<p> but similar to many of the things we're endeavouring to do and</p>
<p> there is a story to be told about some of the successes in that area,</p>
<p> which I think is relevant to the debate in this country, I think we</p>
<p> can in Australia, and indeed in New Zealand, all countries are concerned</p>
<p> about the drug menace and we need to share our information and share</p>
<p> our understanding.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Mr Howard you indicated you're putting more resources into fighting</p>
<p> drugs [inaudible].</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER HOWARD:</p>
<p>Well it is not necessarily such an indication, but I don't rule</p>
<p> that out. But I want to make it clear that we have put a lot more</p>
<p> resources into this issue than any other national government. But</p>
<p> having said that, I do not want to politicise it in a party political</p>
<p> sense. I'm happy to cooperate with a Labor premier anywhere in</p>
<p> Australia, with a Coalition premier, with the law enforcement agencies</p>
<p> of Australia. This is something that ought to be above and beyond</p>
<p> party politics. It's something that ought to be, as far as possible,</p>
<p> separate from the heat and burden and hurly burly of election campaigns</p>
<p> because it is something that we need to work together very closely</p>
<p> on and that is the aim I have and I'll sit down as readily with</p>
<p> Mr Carr as I will with Mr Kennett or Mr Court to try and work to solve</p>
<p> this problem.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister when you've got the prime ministerial taskforce</p>
<p> on CER set up, will it be, who will comprise it, will there be business</p>
<p> representatives on the taskforce and would it be right to interpret</p>
<p> this as a [inaudible].</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER SHIPLEY:</p>
<p>I think on the latter point they were both very small issues, I can't</p>
<p> make this clear enough for you. The issues outstanding in CER are</p>
<p> minor but need to be solved and both prime ministers I think felt</p>
<p> that this meeting this year was not dominated by major things that</p>
<p> were causing a huge conflict but there are a few things that basically</p>
<p> come up every year and it seems that we need to think in a different</p>
<p> way. Having spoken about it over the weekend, the Prime Minister suggested</p>
<p> this approach and we both agreed that we would look at it. We also</p>
<p> agreed that that same group of both ministers and perhaps officials</p>
<p> can look strategically ahead and take this concept of where to next</p>
<p> for CER. We've only agreed less than half an hour ago that this</p>
<p> should be investigated as to how we can establish it and we will of</p>
<p> course come back to you when we get the framework and the agenda issues</p>
<p> fixed.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>[inaudible]</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER SHIPLEY:</p>
<p>Again, I don't think we should speculate until we've had</p>
<p> an opportunity to design this commitment. We agreed, we think this</p>
<p> is a better way to deal with the final issues to do with CER and the</p>
<p> future opportunities and we're going to work our way through</p>
<p> how that might be done.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Mr Howard what were the issues, the minor issues that Prime Minister</p>
<p> Shipley [inaudible]</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER HOWARD:</p>
<p>Well there's still debate about the Social Security agreement,</p>
<p> there's debate about the cost to business of the foreign investment</p>
<p> approval processes of the two countries. I don't think a New</p>
<p> Zealand investment proposal in Australia has been rejected for a decade</p>
<p> or more and I don't think one coming in the other direction has</p>
<p> been rejected for a long time either. There are some associated considerations</p>
<p> for Australia in relation to that in terms of our foreign investment</p>
<p> association with other countries, particularly Japan. I am in favour</p>
<p> where possible of getting rid of regulatory approval processes. I</p>
<p> have an inbuilt prejudice against them unless there's a clear</p>
<p> national benefit in having them, and that's one of the issues</p>
<p> you have a look at. We'd like to see just a tad more progress</p>
<p> on the social security discussions, but look there aren't big</p>
<p> issues.</p>
<p>But the other point that the New Zealand Prime Minister makes and</p>
<p> I think is very important, is how do you broaden the horizons of CER.</p>
<p> And we talked about that over the weekend and that is something also</p>
<p> that this group could have a look at and if you have a prime ministerial</p>
<p> focus on it, it goes above and beyond the sort of one by one exchange</p>
<p> at a particular portfolio level.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, you say that East Timor will be Australia's number</p>
<p> one foreign policy issue over the next 12 months or so. How concerned</p>
<p> are you that East Timor could disintegrate and what would that mean</p>
<p> for Australia?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER HOWARD:</p>
<p>Well Alison, I think the most important thing for me to do at the</p>
<p> moment on East Timor is to remind all of those who have responsibilities</p>
<p> of their responsibilities. To explain to the Australian people what</p>
<p> is at stake, to encourage the Indonesians in particular to an orderly</p>
<p> handling of the problem, and also to try and persuade the leaders</p>
<p> of the East Timorese people of the advantages of a progressive handling</p>
<p> of the issue and not a precipitive one. I don't want to start</p>
<p> talking in the language of disintegration and fragmentation, that's</p>
<p> not helpful. What we want is of course the will of the East Timorese</p>
<p> people to be respected, but we also believe that we have a responsibility</p>
<p> to urge upon everybody the desirability of having a period of autonomy</p>
<p> before independence, and that's what I've been doing now</p>
<p> for several weeks.</p>
<p>I've never said, and I never will say that independence should</p>
<p> be denied if that is clearly what they want. But I will point out</p>
<p> the consequences of that if it occurs precipitively. And I am conscious</p>
<p> of our responsibilities. Not in a sense that I don't want Australia</p>
<p> to shoulder those responsibilities, I do. And I will advocate them</p>
<p> and I will advocate the commitment of the resources needed to discharge</p>
<p> those responsibilities.</p>
<p>But I think it's very important when you're dealing with</p>
<p> a foreign policy issue like this, it's very important to explain</p>
<p> above and beyond the rhetoric of the issue what is involved if a certain</p>
<p> development occurs. I mean it's all very well for people to make</p>
<p> speeches about independence. It's necessary for prime ministers</p>
<p> to explain what that means if it happens too quickly and what the</p>
<p> responsibilities of the Australian population may be if its occurs</p>
<p> too quickly. We have a long association with East Timor, stretching</p>
<p> back to before World War II and it's an issue that's occupied</p>
<p> a lot of column inches in our newspapers and so forth over the years.</p>
<p> Now we're getting to a situation where the circumstances are</p>
<p> unfolding in front of our eyes and I want the Australian people to</p>
<p> understand what is involved, not because I'm going to be begrudging</p>
<p> in our response but because I want people to understand what's</p>
<p> involved.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Mrs Shipley, would you like to [inaudible]in East Timor ...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER SHIPLEY:</p>
<p>It's premature to speculate on this and I don't think that</p>
<p> we should try and beat history. I mean, this is an extraordinary set</p>
<p> of circumstances that currently prevail. I think we must wait and</p>
<p> see what occurs. Of course we hope for the best outcome so that no</p>
<p> peacekeeping force or any other type of intervention will be required.</p>
<p> And I don't think we can get ahead of ourselves until these events</p>
<p> unfold.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Mrs Shipley, what do you think is the most valuable thing you've</p>
<p> learned from Mr Howard about the drug issue and how Australia has</p>
<p> dealt with that?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER SHIPLEY:</p>
<p>Well, it's been a very broad ranging discussion. I think what</p>
<p> it's confirmed for me is that there are no soft options here.</p>
<p> Prime Minister Howard and I share the view that just because you've</p>
<p> got a problem, the way to solve it is not necessarily becoming more</p>
<p> liberal but rather trying to find ways that both educate, treat people</p>
<p> who are clearly ill and deny access where that's possible. That's</p>
<p> consistent with my own view and generally consistent with the public</p>
<p> policy position in New Zealand. I've been very interested in</p>
<p> the phenomena of whether the heroin market's growing because</p>
<p> whether we like it or not New Zealand often follows Australia. At</p>
<p> this stage there's not a major heroin market in New Zealand but</p>
<p> there are issues, obviously, that I want to be aware of so that if</p>
<p> they emerge we know what they look like and we also know what to do.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, in the past much has been made of trans-Tasman rivalry</p>
<p> and that certainly was apparent to many of us in the early days of</p>
<p> prime ministerial relationships. Now, you Mr Howard with Jim Bolger</p>
<p> seemed to get on quite well and now you're getting on quite well,</p>
<p> what's [inaudible]....</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER HOWARD:</p>
<p>I'm just an easy going bloke. I think both of us have recognised,</p>
<p> as I did with Jim Bolger, that  this is a relationship that</p>
<p> has not only a wonderful past but it also has a very special future.</p>
<p> And both of us have a responsibility, whatever our political beliefs</p>
<p> may be, and of course as you're aware Mrs Shipley and I, as I</p>
<p> did with Mr Bolger, share a broad coincidence of political belief</p>
<p> on the centre right of politics and we're both very proud of</p>
<p> that and of the common political philosophy and values that we have.</p>
<p> But irrespective of that, it's a very important relationship</p>
<p> and I don't see it ever in terms of rivalry, I see it in terms</p>
<p> of working together to achieve common goals and common outcomes. One</p>
<p> of the things that has struck me over the weekend is the reminder</p>
<p> that over the next two or three years New Zealand will be hosting</p>
<p> APEC, New Zealand will be hosting the President's Cup </p>
<p> I'm sorry, the America's Cup  we hosted the President's</p>
<p> Cup last year, that's right. We will be having the Olympic Games,</p>
<p> the Centenary of Federation, the Darvos meeting in Melbourne in the</p>
<p> year 2000 and in the year 2001 we'll be hosting CHOGM. Now what</p>
<p> you see there will be a common world focus on our two nations, on</p>
<p> our two societies and that is a contemporary reminder that the relationship</p>
<p> is not all in the past. Important and treasured and valued and emotional</p>
<p> though that may be, and long may it always remain so, but it's</p>
<p> also the future of the relationship is a very important one. And I</p>
<p> see it is as a prime responsibility of an Australian Prime Minister</p>
<p> to work in a cooperative way and I've never seen the relationship</p>
<p> in other than a friendly fashion. And may I say I have, on a personal</p>
<p> level, enjoyed immensely the friendship I developed with Jim Bolger</p>
<p> and I have, I hope, with Jenny Shipley.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Why do you think your predecessor's made [inaudible]</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER HOWARD:</p>
<p>Go and ask them.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>How would you sum up CER now?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER HOWARD:</p>
<p>Well, I think CER has been a great success. I mean, we have been able</p>
<p> to negotiate through difficulty where it's occurred but overall</p>
<p> I think it has been a huge success. I think it's been beneficial</p>
<p> to both countries. In retrospect, I give tremendous credit to Doug</p>
<p> Anthony, the Australian Deputy Prime Minister who argued long and</p>
<p> hard in Australia to win acceptance of it against the opposition of</p>
<p> some people who were being rather short-sighted at the time. And I</p>
<p> think it has been a great success and I think it will continue.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>What strategy have you come up with for making sure that APEC works</p>
<p> and that you can achieve [inaudible]</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER HOWARD:</p>
<p>What are my  I'm sorry, directed at me  what are</p>
<p> my hopes about, how do I feel we'll go?</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>The strategy.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER HOWARD:</p>
<p>The strategy?</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>For APEC.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER HOWARD:</p>
<p>Well, the most important thing is to get the member countries of APEC</p>
<p> focused on the importance of maintaining the ultimate goals of APEC.</p>
<p> It was hardly surprising at the last meeting that you should have</p>
<p> some nervousness given what countries like Indonesia and Thailand</p>
<p> and Korea had gone through. And I'm hopeful that at the next</p>
<p> meeting there'll be more of a focus on the future rather than</p>
<p> the present in APEC. Mrs Shipley will be in the Chair and we'll</p>
<p> be there to help in any way we can to achieve the goals of APEC. And</p>
<p> I will, for Australia's part, be putting the view to the member</p>
<p> countries of APEC leading up to it that we need to focus on the benefits</p>
<p> of freer trade, as I prefer to put it, within the region and within</p>
<p> the grouping because there are great benefits in freer trade. And</p>
<p> we've found that in Australia. New Zealand has certainly found</p>
<p> it. I mean, New Zealand has been a trailblazer in freer trade around</p>
<p> the world and deserves a lot of credit for it.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, there's a report out today on business tax which includes</p>
<p> a proposal on capital gains and a threshold [inaudible]</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER HOWARD:</p>
<p>Is this the Ralph Report?</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Yes, it is.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER HOWARD:</p>
<p>I've heard of it but I've not read it.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>[Inaudible] how comfortable would you be [inaudible]</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER HOWARD:</p>
<p>Well, Tony, I would strongly support a review of the capital gains</p>
<p> tax designed to ensure that Australia remained a country where it</p>
<p> was very attractive to invest, where small investors were encouraged</p>
<p> to take risks and those at the leading edge of technology in particular</p>
<p> were encouraged to take risks. One of the things that countries like</p>
<p> Australia and New Zealand must always do is to ensure that the brightest</p>
<p> and the best of the people with intellectual capital, that they are</p>
<p> not prevented from realising the full potential of their intellectual</p>
<p> capacity and their inventions and the product of their research for</p>
<p> want of a more encouraging taxation climate. Now, they're the</p>
<p> sorts of things that I would like. But can I also say, I'm not</p>
<p> going to support a capital gains tax </p>
