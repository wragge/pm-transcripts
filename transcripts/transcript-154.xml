P. M. No. 8/ 1960<br />
NEW MINISTER<br />
Statement by the Prime Ministe: Mr. Menzies<br />
Senator Paltridge has resigned from the post of<br />
Minister for Shipping and Transport and Mr. Opperman has<br />
been appointed in his place.<br />
I have for some time been conscious of the fact<br />
that Senator Paltridge has been grossly overburdened by<br />
having to attend to both Civil Aviation and Shipping and<br />
Transport. His successful work in relation to shipping has<br />
been quite outstanding and we are all indebted to him for<br />
it. But the problems of civil aviation are becoming more<br />
and more complex, involving as they do most difficult<br />
questions in relation to internal air services and facilities,<br />
and constant negotiations in relation to international airlines.<br />
The change now announced will enable Senator<br />
Paltridge to concentrate his notable abilities upon these<br />
matters. Mr. H. G. Pearce, will become Government vlhip,<br />
in succession to Ar. Opperman.<br />
CANBEiiRA, February, 1960. </p>
