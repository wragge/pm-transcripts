PRIIMNIES 2E<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P. J. KEATING, MP<br />
LAUNCH OF THE STUDY INTELLIGENT EXPORTS AND THE SILENT<br />
REVOLUTION IN SERWICES, PARLIAMENT HOUSE, 2 SEPTEMBER 1994<br />
For too long now, we've tended to think of exports purely as things that are<br />
transported to our wharves, put in the holds of ships and sent overseas.<br />
In the same way, we've tended to underestimate the critical importance of<br />
services to our national economy.<br />
Services are our economic oxygen.<br />
But because they're all around us because they account for 70 per cent of<br />
our GDP and 80 per cent of our employment we often forget just how<br />
important they are.<br />
I am very pleased, therefore, to launch this report Intelligent Exports and the<br />
Silent Revolution in Services because it goes a long way to putting our<br />
services trade in the national spotlight.<br />
It goes a long way to redressing what I think has been a failure to appreciate<br />
the importance of our services trade.<br />
And it gives us a new platform from which we can move forward.<br />
Services directly account for 20 per cent of all our exports.<br />
And when you look at the services input into our manufactures, mining and<br />
agricultural exports, you see that services contribute up to another 20 per<br />
cent of our exports.<br />
All up, that means services account for around 40 per cent of the total value<br />
of our exports, that's two in every five export dollars.<br />
But, as this study points out, you wouldn't know about it from our media<br />
only one in ten articles about exports relates to services. </p>
<p>When last Tuesday's Financial Review ran a piece on the balance of<br />
payments figures, it used the images of ships and mineral conveyor belts as<br />
backdrops for its charts on the current account and export figures.<br />
These images, while not inaccurate, do nonetheless reinforce the perception<br />
that trade, and more particularly export, is only about physical goods, the<br />
things you put in the holds of ships.<br />
What they miss out on is the importance of the services side to our exports<br />
either as exports in their own right or as vital components in our traditional<br />
exports.<br />
They miss out on the intelligent side to our exports, that part of our exports<br />
whose value has been added by the skills, creativity and ingenuity of<br />
individual Australians.<br />
And this goes some way to explaining why the revolution in services has<br />
been a silent revolution.<br />
The silence is a concern because services are going to play an increasingly<br />
important role in our trade.<br />
The information superhighway will see to that.<br />
As we pointed out in the White Paper on Employment and Growth, Working<br />
Nation, Australia's future depends upon the ideas, skills and knowledge of<br />
our workforce.<br />
With services the fastest growing category of world trade, and with Australia<br />
producing highly-skilled, well-educated workers, we are ideally placed to gain<br />
a greater share of the expanding services cake, particularly in the Asia<br />
Pacific region.<br />
When Indonesia's Foreign Minister Ali Alatas needed vital heart surgery<br />
recently, he didn't fly to the United States to find one of the world's most<br />
sophisticated medical centres, he came here to Australia, to the Austin<br />
Hospital in Melbourne.<br />
The service Ali Alatas received was an Australian export, an Australian<br />
services export.<br />
When IKEA put out a world wide tender for a stock management system for<br />
its operations in Singapore, it was won by Price Waterhouse's Australian<br />
consulting arm. </p>
<p>And the reason the Australian team won the right to lead the project was<br />
because it was multi-disciplined, it had the necessary expertise in software,<br />
retailing, marketing and distribution as well as the experience in doing<br />
business in Asia.<br />
Importantly, it's a project that should lead to many others in the region.<br />
When I visited Thailand and Laos earlier this year, I formally handed over the<br />
Friendship Bridge which spans the Mekong River and links Thailand and<br />
Laos by land for the first time.<br />
This Bridge stands as a testament to the quality and capability of Australian<br />
engineering and construction services it was designed, built and funded by<br />
Australians. Already two companies associated with the bridge, John Holland Engineering<br />
and Construction, and Maunsell Sinclair Knight have won flow-on work in<br />
Laos.<br />
They will join the likes of other Australian exporters like Transfield which<br />
recently secured the development rights for the $ 1.2 billion Nam Theun<br />
hydro-electric dam project.<br />
Engineering and construction companies have won major international<br />
tenders to design hospitals in several countries and a Melbourne based<br />
healthcare consultancy company has undertaken a host of joint ventures<br />
managing hospitals in the Middle East, India and Malaysia.<br />
Our education exports are now running at $ 1.3 billion a twenty six fold<br />
increase since 1986.<br />
And tourism now accounts for 12 per cent of our total export earnings.<br />
This report contains many more impressive statistics like these and countless<br />
stories of Australian services companies out there winning against the best in<br />
the world.<br />
Let me then turn to the report and congratulate its authors, the LEK<br />
Partnership, and the ten organisations which funded the project.<br />
In particular, I want to acknowledge the role Ralph and his steering<br />
committee played in overseeing the study.<br />
Let me also acknowledge the role that the Australian Coalition of Service<br />
Industries ( ACSI) has played over the past few years in upping the profile of<br />
the services industry and also for its work with the Government on the two<br />
vitally important areas of the Uruguay Round and APEC. </p>
<p>With the publication of this report, I think ACSI has gone from a fledgling<br />
organisation to one now on a par with its international counterparts.<br />
One of the great things about this report is that it's an international first for the<br />
services industry.<br />
And it builds on the McKinsey report on our emerging manufacturing exports.<br />
It shows that services exporters are typically small, innovative and flexible,<br />
that they rely heavily on exports to survive.<br />
In the six years to 1991, Australia bettered both the world and regional growth<br />
rates for the export of services.<br />
Australian exports grew by 17 per cent per annum while the Asian average<br />
was 14.6 per cent and the world average 13.6 per cent.<br />
This is impressive when you consider that over the same period services<br />
exports increased their share of total global exports from 18 to 21 per cent.<br />
As the report points out, the competitive domestic economy that is, this<br />
Government's opening up of the Australian economy was a big contributing<br />
factor in the growth of our services exports, with most services exporters<br />
pointing to our great strengths in our workforce skills, telecommunications,<br />
education system and information technology levels.<br />
And once the Hilmer reforms are in place this will give us an even more<br />
competitive services sector.<br />
Add to this economic prospects about as good as you could ever hope to get,<br />
and the future looks very bright indeed.<br />
Not surprising then that the companies which participated in the study expect<br />
their export revenues to double in the five years to 1998 to reach $ 33 billion.<br />
Not surprising also that total services exports are forecast to generate an<br />
additional $ 18 billion and 109,000 jobs by 1998.<br />
And as the economies of Asia continue their high growth, as APEC continues<br />
to grow as a force for trade liberalisation in the region, we can expect to see<br />
many more opportunities opening up.<br />
In fact, the report predicts that by 1998, Indonesia and China will become our<br />
most important services markets.<br />
Japan, of course, will remain one of the most significant destinations for our<br />
services exports.<br />
And as you know on Sunday, I'll be heading to Japan for a short visit. </p>
<p>And let me emphasise it will be very much a working visit without formality or<br />
ceremonial trappings.<br />
I will be meeting with Prime Minister Murayama and his senior colleagues to<br />
discuss the forthcoming APEC Leaders meeting which President Soeharto<br />
will chair in Bogor in November.<br />
I want to make sure that the Japanese Government understands what<br />
aspirations Australia holds for APEC and I also want to make sure that we<br />
understand Japan's views.<br />
I'm particularly looking forward to renewing my contacts with senior Japanese<br />
business people, Japan is, after all, our largest trading partner and our<br />
largest export market.<br />
Clearly, as this report shows, the growth in our services exports is very good<br />
but it could be great.<br />
Only 5 per cent of Australian service sector production is exported.<br />
The report suggests that an export share of 8 to 10 per cent of production<br />
could add an additional $ 10 to $ 15 billion to Australian service exports each<br />
year. The way we're going I'd say that the 10 per cent is well within our reach by<br />
the turn of the century.<br />
We have an economic recovery well and truly underway.<br />
It's a strong recovery.<br />
With business investment now coming through and inflation locked in low, it's<br />
a very sustainable recovery.<br />
As we move ahead down the growth path, we can't afford to sit back and<br />
coast along.<br />
That would be to waste the opportunities now before us.<br />
That would be to deny future generations of Australians.<br />
But I don't think that will happen because competition is now well and truly<br />
locked into our national economic psyche.<br />
More and more potential exporters are coming to realise that if they're<br />
competitive in Australia, odds are they're competitive internationally. </p>
<p>What this report has shown is that there is enormous scope for Australian<br />
service companies to lift their export game.<br />
It's difficult to see how the circumstances could be much better.<br />
And that makes the export imperative greater than ever.<br />
The world economy is growing and it's looking for the sort of high tech, high<br />
value adding services the intelligent services that Australia can provide.<br />
Government can help by creating the right environment and encouraging<br />
firms. We've got the right macroeconomic settings in place and as the report<br />
notes, in the White Paper we took additional measures to build more<br />
competitive services firms.<br />
We're putting in place major training initiatives to lift our skill levels and<br />
improve productivity.<br />
We're introducing tax initiatives to encourage investment in small to medium<br />
sized enterprises and bring more regional headquarters to Australia.<br />
We're making it easier to get access to finance.<br />
We're encouraging innovation through a more generous research and<br />
development tax concession, through assistance for the commercial isation of<br />
new technology and through a national technology diffusion network.<br />
We're giving industry better access to the government purchasing market<br />
while also extending the operation of the EMDG scheme to include tourist<br />
operators. But, as important as these measures are, at the end of the day, it's really up<br />
to business to show vision and leadership by getting into the export game.<br />
As I see it, it's simply a question of more Australian business people in the<br />
services industry saying " Well, let's look at this export game. Let's give it a<br />
go1 I don't for a moment preten~ d that it's easy. It's not.<br />
But there are a hell of a lot of service exporters already out there making it<br />
happen. I commend this report to anyone who's interested in our services industry and<br />
I urge the business community to lend its support to the series of national<br />
seminars commencing next week. </p>
