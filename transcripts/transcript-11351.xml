<p>Well, thank you very much, Senator Bishop; to my other Â Senator</p>
<p> Bishop, good Heaven's, what a bad start. Bronwyn, I'm sorry.</p>
<p> That's what happens when you spend an hour-and-a-half on the</p>
<p> golf course early in the morning. It takes your mind off business.</p>
<p> It makes me very active, Jackie. But to Bronwyn; to my other ministerial</p>
<p> colleague, Jackie Kelly; to all the other groups who are represented</p>
<p> here today and I particularly acknowledge Peter Bartells, the Chairman</p>
<p> of the Australian Sports Commission, and all the other organisations</p>
<p> that are involved in the sort of aims and the sort of projects that</p>
<p> we have in mind for the International Year of Older Persons.</p>
<p>Not every international year which is designated by the United Nations</p>
<p> or other international bodies draws unifying support within the Australian</p>
<p> community. But it's fair to say that this year, which has been</p>
<p> set aside to recognise the contribution of older people to the building</p>
<p> of Australia and to the nature of Australian society that we have</p>
<p> at present, is something that has the enthusiastic support of not</p>
<p> only the Australian Government but the enthusiastic support of all</p>
<p> Australians.</p>
<p>Our aim in this year is to recognise the contribution that older people</p>
<p> have made to the Australian nation and to also pursue a number of</p>
<p> underlying policy objectives. To recognise the desire of older Australians</p>
<p> to remain in their own homes. To recognise the desire of older Australians</p>
<p> to remain very active. And to implement a number of programmes which</p>
<p> work towards those aims.</p>
<p>I'm very proud of a number of the initiatives that the Government</p>
<p> has already implemented in the three years that it's been in</p>
<p> power to assist older Australians. I think particularly the extension</p>
<p> of the Seniors' Card to something like 225,000 largely but not</p>
<p> entirely self-funded retirees. I think particularly the extension</p>
<p> of the Gold Card to 50,000 World War II veterans, a very special group</p>
<p> of older Australians to whom all of us owe everything in terms of</p>
<p> our current lifestyle and the fact that we can live in freedom in</p>
<p> this wonderful country of ours.</p>
<p>We have linked the pensions to 25% of male total average earnings.</p>
<p> We've made changes to the thresholds in relations to taxation</p>
<p> for self-funded retirees. We've provided a capital gains tax</p>
<p> exemption for small businesses where the proceeds are rolled over</p>
<p> into an approved retirement fund. And we've, very importantly</p>
<p> for rural Australians, we've eased the assets test on retiring</p>
<p> farmers so that they can transfer their farm to their family without</p>
<p> affecting their eligibility for the pension. And also very recently,</p>
<p> and I know something widely welcomed by the Australian community and</p>
<p> particularly by older Australians, we've introduced a 30% taxation</p>
<p> rebate for private health insurance, which means that something in</p>
<p> order of 81% of all Australian taxpayers will effectively have a full</p>
<p> tax deduction for their private health insurance.</p>
<p>We are particularly committed, in relation to the care of the frail</p>
<p> aged, we are particularly committed to providing as much assistance</p>
<p> and as many incentives as possible to assisting people to remain in</p>
<p> their own homes. It is the overwhelming desire of older Australians</p>
<p> to remain in their own homes all their lives or, given the circumstances,</p>
<p> as long as possible. And we introduced a Staying at Home initiative</p>
<p> more than a year ago which over four years increases the number of</p>
<p> community aged care packages from just under 10,000 to 22,000. And</p>
<p> we're also going to provide greater support for Australia's</p>
<p> 1.5 million carers. And I have to say that some of the most heroic</p>
<p> Australians and some of the most wonderful Australians I've met</p>
<p> are those older people caring for often a disabled or handicapped</p>
<p> child in very, very difficult circumstances. And we have introduced</p>
<p> additional measures to assist them, as indeed we've provided</p>
<p> additional support for the domiciliary nursing care benefit and also</p>
<p> additional assistance in relation to those who suffer dementia. And</p>
<p> in relation to residential aged care, we're increasing funding</p>
<p> by more than $165 million a year. And over the next 10 years $1.3</p>
<p> billion will be provided to upgrade and build new premises.</p>
<p>You are, of course, aware of the very significant benefits for older</p>
<p> people coming out of the Government's taxation reform package.</p>
<p> And particularly the increases in the pension of 4%, that a further</p>
<p> 45,000 people will qualify for a part-pension and the pensioner concession</p>
<p> card, the increase in the tax threshold, the reduction in tax rates</p>
<p> and also very welcomed to many self-funded retirees, the abolition</p>
<p> of provisional tax. Now, all of these things are initiatives of the</p>
<p> Government which have taken place over the last three years.</p>
<p>The theme of 1999, the Year of Older Persons, is Australia, a society</p>
<p> for all ages. And that is a theme which is designed to recognise the</p>
<p> contribution of people of all ages to the building of the Australian</p>
<p> community. And I hope that during this year we as a nation can recognise</p>
<p> the immense contribution of older Australians to our society and to</p>
<p> build partnerships between the Government and the community and the</p>
<p> Government and business organisations to better meet the needs of</p>
<p> older people.</p>
<p>And as a permanent reminder of this international year I want to pursue</p>
<p> a substantial advancement in the health care delivered to older Australians.</p>
<p> We want to increase the ability of older people to continue living</p>
<p> in their own homes and to participate actively in their community.</p>
<p> And more specifically in relation to that, we're going to provide,</p>
<p> through Medicare, for general practitioners to be involved in multidisciplinary</p>
<p> care planning and case management for those with chronic and complex</p>
<p> needs. We want to give incentives at the practice level for general</p>
<p> practitioners to achieve multidisciplinary care plans for those over</p>
<p> 65 and with chronic and complex needs. And for those over 75, to pay</p>
<p> doctors to undertake an annual health assessment to focus on issues</p>
<p> of prevention and better management of chronic illness, with these</p>
<p> assessments to be done at the person's home where necessary.</p>
<p> We've committed Â and this was announced at the time of</p>
<p> the passage of the health insurance legislation Â an additional</p>
<p> $25 million for further co-ordinated care trials to address the health</p>
<p> care needs of older people who are chronically ill or disadvantaged.</p>
<p>I do want to, and I particularly welcome the emphasis here today on</p>
<p> encouraging older people to remain physically active in their local</p>
<p> communities. The Active Australia International Year of Older Persons</p>
<p> campaign that we're going to launch today will highlight the</p>
<p> benefit of physical activity for older people, indeed, for Australians</p>
<p> of all ages and is one of our major initiatives for the year. And</p>
<p> I particularly mark there the contribution of different agencies,</p>
<p> the Australian Sports Commission, the Health Department and the Department</p>
<p> of Veterans' Affairs, to deliver benefits in that particular</p>
<p> programme.</p>
<p>Twenty years from now there will be almost twice as many people over</p>
<p> the age of 65 as there are now. And this fact presents particular</p>
<p> challenges and for this reason I've established a Ministerial</p>
<p> Reference Group chaired by the Minister for Aged Care, Mrs Bishop,</p>
<p> to develop a national strategy for an ageing Australia. And it will</p>
<p> provide the vehicle for consulting the community about the type of</p>
<p> policies and programmes needed in the years ahead to meet the demands</p>
<p> of older people.</p>
<p>I've asked that group to focus on four themes. Firstly, helping</p>
<p> Australians to be independent and to provide for their later years</p>
<p> through employment, life-long learning and financial security. Secondly,</p>
<p> delivering quality health care through new approaches to service delivery,</p>
<p> co-ordinated care and independent living. Thirdly, improving attitudes</p>
<p> to older people and ageing, lifestyle issues such as personal safety,</p>
<p> housing, transport, recreation and community support. And fourthly,</p>
<p> encouraging healthy ageing and the role of general practitioners of</p>
<p> maintaining the wellbeing of older people. And I understand that that</p>
<p> group will release a preliminary discussion paper in the next month</p>
<p> or so with further discussion papers later in the year.</p>
<p>And in the area of recognising in a symbolic way the year, we're</p>
<p> going to mint a commemorative coin set, we're going to print</p>
<p> the commemorative stamp issue and we're going to fund a national</p>
<p> touring photographic exhibition and book called ÂImages of Our</p>
<p> Elders' to promote positive images of the contribution of older</p>
<p> people. And we're going to expand the Safe at Home programme</p>
<p> to improve the personal and physical security of all the people living</p>
<p> in their own home should the trial be successful.</p>
<p>And a great practical benefit will be our support for the partnership</p>
<p> between the Australian Bankers Association and seniors' organisations</p>
<p> to familiarise older people with automatic teller machines, electronic</p>
<p> funds transfer, the Internet and telephone banking. And additional</p>
<p> funding will also be provided to establish a Building Safer Communities</p>
<p> programme which will target areas of community concern including burglaries,</p>
<p> home invasions, assault and robbery, particularly against older people.</p>
<p>The Mature Age Workers Project will involve developing promotional</p>
<p> material for job network members and employer associations to encourage</p>
<p> them to assist older job seekers into employment.</p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen, as we approach the Centenary of the Federation</p>
<p> of Australia there is, I find, throughout Australia a surge of interest</p>
<p> in the history of our country and a surge of interest in the contribution</p>
<p> that people of different generations have made to the building of</p>
<p> the modern Australia. There is a growing pride in what Australia has</p>
<p> been able to achieve. There is a sense that there are now, in relation</p>
<p> to some of the great historical events of our nation, of course, a</p>
<p> dwindling number of Australia who had personal experience of involvement</p>
<p> in them. And as we near the Centenary of Federation we have an opportunity</p>
<p> to honour the contribution of all of those Australians that have made</p>
<p> this country what it is today.</p>
<p>I want 1999 to be a year that recognises the ongoing contribution</p>
<p> of mature Australians. I want it to be a year which produces, amongst</p>
<p> younger Australians, a wider appreciation of the contribution of generations</p>
<p> that have gone before them. I want it to be a year that recognises</p>
<p> that economic and physical security are the two of most important</p>
<p> things that older Australians can have. The security of a home, the</p>
<p> security of a supporting family, the security of financial stability</p>
<p> and adequacy and also the sense of physical safety of being able to</p>
<p> walk the streets of this country in physical safety and security,</p>
<p> all of those things are tremendously important.</p>
<p>I want to thank my ministerial colleague, Bronwyn Bishop, for the</p>
<p> tremendous leadership that she's giving as the portfolio Minister</p>
<p> for Aged Care. It's a new appointment and I think Bronwyn brings</p>
<p> very special skills to that job and I think she will make an outstanding</p>
<p> contribution through the year.</p>
<p>I do recognise the importance of the presence here today of my Minister</p>
<p> for Sport, Jackie Kelly. The emphasis on physical activity and the</p>
<p> need for Australians of all ages, and not just older Australians but</p>
<p> some of the less fit younger Australians, to be more physically active</p>
<p> and more physically energetic I know is something that Jackie is very</p>
<p> particularly committed to.</p>
<p>I think 1999 will be a great opportunity to emphasise what older Australians</p>
<p> have done but, more importantly than that, what older Australians</p>
<p> continue to do for this country. To recognise that we are, in the</p>
<p> main, a society that is lucky to enjoy longer, healthier lives, that</p>
<p> the excitement that many older people derive from new careers, new</p>
<p> opportunities, new experiences and new activities is something that</p>
<p> is adding very greatly to the quality of life. And what they give</p>
<p> back through experience and understanding and having lived through</p>
<p> experiences that younger Australians have not lived through, all of</p>
<p> that will go to a greater enrichment of our community.</p>
<p>I commend all of the organisations involved in making life better,</p>
<p> more fulfilling and bringing closer links between different generations</p>
<p> of Australians. I thank you very much for attending today's gathering.</p>
<p> Bronwyn has a few more things to say and a few other observations</p>
<p> to make about some of the activities but I know that 1999 will be</p>
<p> a great year in recognising the contribution of older Australians</p>
<p> to our modern Australian community.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
