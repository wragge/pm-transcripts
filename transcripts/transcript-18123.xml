The Prime Minister, Julia Gillard, today announced the Government will provide an extra funding to help Pacific Island nations improve services for women who have experienced violence.</p>
<p>Ms Gillard today said the funds will help governments, civil society and United Nations agencies prevent and respond to violence against women in the Pacific.</p>
<p>Violence against women affects all countries around the world, including Australia. It violates basic human rights and causes immeasurable trauma for women, families and the community.</p>
<p>Australia's latest support will help expand and improve services for women across the Pacific through counselling, crisis accommodation and legal support.  Australian funding also aims to help raise awareness and change community attitudes to violence.</p>
<p>Violence against women is still pervasive in our region. Recent research shows more than 60 per cent of women in some Pacific Island countries have experienced physical violence or sexual abuse.  In Australia, around one in three women have experienced violence and almost one in five have experienced sexual abuse since the age of 15.</p>
<p>Violence against women and the fear of violence has significant impacts on development. It affects families and communities and limits women's participation in social, political and economic life.  Violence against women also puts a strain on health care, social, policing and justice systems.</p>
<p>In the Pacific Australia has supported civil society and governments to promote women's rights, prevent and respond to violence, and increase access to justice for women survivors. Australian support has assisted the Governments of Kiribati and Solomon Islands to endorse national policies and action plans to address violence against women.</p>
<p>Australia has also supported the Fiji Women's Crisis Centre to meet the immediate needs of survivors of violence in Fiji and advocate for women's rights in Pacific countries. </p>
<p>In 2009, the Crisis Centre in Suva and three district branches provided counselling and support services to more than 3,700 women subjected to violence.  The Centres also supported men to raise awareness of the impact of violence and to challenge attitudes that condone such violence.  </p>
