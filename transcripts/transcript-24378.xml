    <content><![CDATA[<p>On Monday, I will attend the dedication of the Australian Memorial in the Pukeahu National War Memorial Park in Wellington.</p>
<p>The memorial commemorates the many conflicts in which Australian and New Zealand troops have jointly served.</p>
<p>It is testament to the bond forged between our nations across more than a century, as well as to our shared strategic interests and common values and heritage.</p>
<p>I will also visit the <em>Gallipoli: The scale of our War </em>exhibition at the Museum of New Zealand (Te Papa Tongarewa) and hold discussions with Prime Minister John Key on bilateral and international issues.</p>
<p>This visit is a reminder of the deep ties between our two nations.</p>
<p>We are more than friends, we are family.</p>
<p>The dedication of the Australian War Memorial in Wellington marks the beginning of an historic fortnight in the Anzac Centenary programme.</p>
<p>19 April 2015Â </p>
