    <content><![CDATA[<p>Australia, along with a number of other friends and allies of the United States, has been approached to consider resettling detainees from Guantanamo Bay.</p>
<p>This is a request from the Bush administration, and follows President Bush's statement that he would like to see Guantanamo closed. This is not a request from President Elect Obama.</p>
<p>The Bush Administration first approached Australia in early 2008 with a request to resettle a small group of detainees from Guantanamo in Australia.</p>
<p>After appropriate consideration, Australia declined to allow resettlement of that small group in Australia.</p>
<p>The Bush Administration approached Australia again in early December 2008 with a second request to assist with relocation.</p>
<p>Australia, as an ally of the United States, is examining this second request.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding that it is unlikely Australia would accept these detainees, given the fact that the Bush Administration has formally approached Australia with this request, the request demands proper consideration.</p>
<p>The Australian Government makes no apology for taking a very hard line against terrorism, which includes continuing to work closely with the United States and other allies worldwide in the global effort to defeat terrorism.</p>
