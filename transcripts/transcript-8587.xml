TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING, MP<br />
INTERVIEW WITH DERRYN HINCH, CHANNEL SEVEN<br />
22 JULY 1992<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
DH: Prime Minister Keating, good evening.<br />
PM: Good evening Derryn.<br />
DH: You called it, did it work, or should I say will it<br />
work?<br />
PM: Well it was as good a meeting as I think we could have<br />
had, all the people who are material to this issue<br />
being resolved, that is the two issues, the long run<br />
traini , ng from school to work, and picking up those<br />
jyoung people-for whom that transition will come to<br />
late. Thiat is, those who are currently unemployed,<br />
all the people that need to be talking about that were<br />
at the meeting today and it was a very good meeting.<br />
DH: The instant criticism you will get from people is<br />
where are the jobs, we have to have them now.<br />
PM: Well that's in terms of the current younguemlyd<br />
that's about 125, 000 of them. But we are doing two<br />
things, yesterday as part of this I announced a very<br />
big breakthrough with the Commonwealth and the States<br />
forming a National Training Authority. Now what that<br />
will do is put into place along side the universities<br />
a technical and further education system of substance,<br />
and quality, and status to take kids from school to<br />
work, to train them in school to work in the long<br />
transition, which we have been trying to arrive at for<br />
many years.<br />
DH: With this $ 720 million for TAFE__ I remember some<br />
months ago you were sort of bullying the States and<br />
saying if you don't come along with me we will start<br />
our own system and freeze you out of the money, right?<br />
PM: That's right. Well you have got to push and shove to<br />
get anything done Derryn, and we said to the States, </p>
<p>look, we don't mind this being cooperative but it has<br />
to happen. We can't leave kids, half of the school<br />
leavers about 150,000 each year untrained, we can't<br />
let this happen. Because the jobs for untrained<br />
people which were around when you and I were kids are<br />
not there now.<br />
DH: But you have said recently that we are the first<br />
computer generation that's hurting the job pool etc,<br />
we can't train kids for dead-end jobs. But there are<br />
people out there now who will take even a dead-end<br />
job.<br />
PM: But the job doesn't exist Derryn. What was your first<br />
job in journalism?<br />
DH: My first job was as a cadet for a newspaper.<br />
PM: Well mine was a clerk. Yours may still be there, but<br />
mine certainly isn't. I think most of those jobs are<br />
not there at any price, they are gone. Because<br />
basically the jobs are done by machines, by computers,<br />
by facilitation. So, the trick now is for the jobs<br />
that are there, the trained jobs, they are only going<br />
to be taken by people who are trained and yet we left<br />
so many young people untrained. So what today was<br />
about, and yesterday, is getting the kids out of<br />
school who don't go to university to train them for<br />
these jobs.<br />
DH: There is an irony here that Malcolm Fraser, when he<br />
had high unemploymenRt figures, he would say things<br />
like stay in school, keep them in the schools longer.<br />
Now you are saying, it didn't work for him, you are<br />
saying stay in various training courses, stay in<br />
school as well.<br />
PM: But it has worked for us. When we became the<br />
Government three kids in ten completed school, seven<br />
left untrained, not even at secondary level. Now that<br />
is seven in ten completing secondary school. We hope<br />
soon it will be nine in ten, and they will go into<br />
university in the 50 per cent extra places we have<br />
created and they will go into a modernised technical<br />
and further education system. In other words, in a<br />
period of seven or eight years Derryn, in Australia we<br />
will have made a twenty year educational change in<br />
about six or seven. And it is those people, young<br />
people forgotten in the days of Malcolm Fraser, seven<br />
in ten not completing even secondary school, let alone<br />
university or TAFE, they are the ones to be picked up..<br />
But the ones for whom that transition have left<br />
behind, that's the 120,000 who are unemployed now.<br />
DH: There's nothing for them.<br />
PM: Well that's what today was about as well, that was<br />
trying to set up traineeships and work experience and </p>
<p>training opportunities to have business take those<br />
people up.<br />
DH: Whenever you give business a hand it looks like you<br />
are handing just more profits to business even when<br />
times are tough. But why don't you bite-the-bullet<br />
and do things like get rid of the 17.5 per cent<br />
holiday loading which would make factories and other<br />
businesses, take a lot of pressure off them come the<br />
Christmas holidays? Why don't you do that?<br />
PM: Well because in this, I think someone made the point<br />
today that holiday leave loading represented I think<br />
four cents an hour for the employment of a young<br />
person. I mean compared to the rates we are talking<br />
about it is an infinitesimal change.<br />
DH: And yet small businesses and factories they tell us<br />
that come Christmas they dread it because they shut<br />
down for five weeks and they have got to find all that<br />
money, that 17.5 per cent for every employee all the<br />
time.<br />
PM: The people who are likely to be picked up in<br />
employment here are people who would not be largely<br />
commercially employed. That is, we will be offering<br />
as a result of this meeting, young people the<br />
possibility of work experience and training and<br />
possibly linking that to a job later. Linking that to<br />
an employment opportunity later. That is, training<br />
with employment and going on to work experience. Now<br />
that is the way of getting people back into the<br />
workforce, many indeed for the first time into the<br />
workforce, and that will mean we will have to agree to<br />
a structure which business will take people up in.<br />
DH: And that's for stopping the rotten future, but it's<br />
not helping now.<br />
PM: No, no that's for now. This if for the current group.<br />
You see a lot of today's discussion was about how we<br />
settle on a set of wage arrangements which fix the<br />
current group of unemployed, while at the same time<br />
being part of the longer run transition.<br />
DH: This is the $ 3.00 something an hour training issue?<br />
PM: No, that was John Hewson's thing, we rejected that.<br />
The meeting rejected that today, and the young people<br />
rejected that. They won't live on $ 3.00 an hour.<br />
DH: No, I am saying the $ 3.00 in addition to whatever they<br />
are earning, if they are in training they may be<br />
earning $ 4.00 or $ 5.00 an hour, but then if they are<br />
doing some other work they will get extra?<br />
PM: Well we are looking at a minimal level of pay, but<br />
with training involved. Whereas, under John Hewson's </p>
<p>proposal if you pay someone $ 114.00 a week, which is<br />
less than $ 3.00 an hour, and then they work three days<br />
a week and have two days training they are only<br />
getting three fifths of $ 114.00, they are getting<br />
$ 65.00 a week. In other words, under our proposition<br />
we are looking at propositions where we give people<br />
work experience and training. So they are not just<br />
getting some work experience and then it dies and<br />
finishes but they get an accredited training to go on<br />
and transfer their skills to some other place.<br />
DH: Mr Prime Minister, what about payroll taxes, now<br />
that's a State issue I know, but why not put pressure<br />
on the States to say wipe your $ 5 billion in payroll<br />
taxes around the country on the condition give say,<br />
per cent of it back to people who hire new young<br />
staff, and may be 25 per cent or some figure to people<br />
who invest the money that they save in new equipment,<br />
what about those sorts of plans?<br />
PM: I don't think that's the real problem. For a start I<br />
don't think that State budgets could stand that kind<br />
of loss in revenue, but I don't think that's the<br />
problem. The problem here is that the jobs for young<br />
people untrained have largely disappeared. And people<br />
will put them on, provided that it suits them, and we<br />
say we only want to see them put on if they get<br />
training experience to give them accredited training<br />
to take to another job, in other words we give them a<br />
future. The Government doesn't mind therefore coming<br />
to the party with a job subsidy, to be in there to<br />
encourage an employer to put them on, to give them<br />
that work experience and that training, and that I<br />
think is going to matter. Now if States wish to give<br />
relief on payroll taxes, a matter for them Derryn, but<br />
most of them can't afford to.<br />
DH: I think Joan Kirner who can afford it less than<br />
anybody, has said she'll consider it.<br />
PM: Well, and good on her, but I think that won't be the<br />
key thing. Even if they said look the payroll tax is<br />
off, employers are not going to hire unskilled young<br />
people for jobs that are not there. They'll-only take<br />
them on as part of dealing with this problem, that is<br />
from an Australian fairness point of view, trying to<br />
do something useful to take these kids up and give<br />
them experience, and where we can train them and give<br />
them a future.<br />
DH: Now all is obviously going to cost you money, may be a<br />
lot of money, have you been tempted to renege and to<br />
wipe the promised tax cuts? </p>
<p>PM: No, no, the tax cuts are further out and these kinds<br />
of changes can be made without any problem in relation<br />
to the tax cuts. There's also propositions been put<br />
to us to raise income tax levels. But the revenue<br />
consequences, the revenue benefits are so small as to<br />
not matter in the general run of the size of these<br />
budgets. We can do this, but what we want t o do is<br />
something good and sensible and structured and<br />
planned, that does something real about this group of<br />
current young unemployed people but at the same time<br />
fits it into the longer run transition.<br />
DH: What about some of the other things that have been<br />
floated recently, and I don't necessarily agree with<br />
them, like youth_* corps1 orpeace corps or consc~ zjpin1._<br />
PM: That got a run today and had a lot of support at the<br />
meeting. That is had support of the National Farmers'<br />
Federation the ACTU, Archbishop Hollingworth, people<br />
looking at rural employment schemes, 2rovincial<br />
-mp-1Qy! Jint slemes, regional-employment schemes.<br />
DH: Are they a chance?<br />
PM: They're a chance. Yes, they've got a place, I think<br />
they've got a definite place in the scheme of things.<br />
DH: that didn't they, with tree planting and things<br />
like that?<br />
PM: Particularly in regional areas, where there isn't the<br />
urban industrial base and in provincial areas, in some<br />
the provincial cities where local government can do<br />
things immediately and well. As well as the States,<br />
in regional areas. So I think that is something which<br />
did have a fair degree of support today and which I<br />
think we can usefully do.<br />
DH: Have you ever been unemployed?<br />
PM: I was for a while, yeah.<br />
DH: What happened?<br />
PM: Well it's a pretty lousy feeling. I actually know, I<br />
think I know what people feel, because you do feel as<br />
though the doors are all shut, that no-one wants you.<br />
It's a terrible feeling. I think its got to happen to<br />
you to know what it's like.<br />
DH: One of the biggest criticism of Canberra, and you get<br />
it all the time, you're in your ivory tower, you're<br />
too far removed, there is that famous quote from<br />
Margaret Whitlam once who said that inflation was a<br />
lot of hooha. Do you wear any of that, do you accept<br />
any of that? </p>
<p>PM: Well I was unemployed at one stage for about six<br />
weeks, and it's a pretty unpleasant experience<br />
knocking on doors trying to find a job and sort of at<br />
the time no-one wants you. You get the feeling<br />
awfully quickly there's something wrong with you.<br />
DH: Now I say to you, people who talk about the Summit<br />
that's been on the news tonight and people talk about<br />
it all this week. Say you Paul Keating, as a father,<br />
not as a Prime Minister have a teenage son who hasn't<br />
worked in six months and has a mate who hasn't worked<br />
and maybe a girlfriend who hasn't worked. What do you<br />
say to him to keep his spirits up, or get them back<br />
up?<br />
PM: Well I think you've got to say something real, and<br />
that is the government's got to do something that<br />
defies the commercial judgement of a business that<br />
would otherwise not hire them.<br />
DH: But if you say that the Government's got to do<br />
something you're son's going to say that bugger<br />
Keating in Canberra, I mean what do you say to your<br />
son to get his spirits back up and to say to him, OK<br />
this is how you can get through it.<br />
PM: Well the main thing is _ growtecho, n omic growth, as the<br />
thing gets going, the main thing is to train people.<br />
That's why the higher retention rates in school is the<br />
right thing. They then get training in universities<br />
or technical education and they find the trained job.<br />
It's the untrained jobs that's the problem. And it's<br />
the ones who are now untrained, that have fallen out<br />
of school, that where trying to pick up. When I say<br />
that the Government are doing something, I mean in the<br />
context of business and the unions and community<br />
groups to find these employment experience and<br />
training.<br />
DH: One last quick question, we are running out of time.<br />
This was the Youth Summit. What about the 400,000<br />
though, the lonfg term unemployed, who will be<br />
unemployed some of them through 1995-96?<br />
PM: Well that's where in the budget we will look at labour<br />
market prq. ams for the mature aaed unemplpyqd people.<br />
The big remedy to unemployment Derryn, is obviously<br />
economic growth. The economy is already growing, we<br />
probably will clock up the better part of 2 per cent<br />
for the year June. That's faster than Europe's<br />
growing, it's as fast as North America's growing.<br />
We'll probably grow faster next year. But there'll<br />
still be those people, who you correctly identify who<br />
are unemployed, and the labour market programs, that<br />
is the work experience and support programs of the<br />
Commonwealth, this year already, are handling about<br />
400,000 people. And we intend to look at that further<br />
in the budget. </p>
