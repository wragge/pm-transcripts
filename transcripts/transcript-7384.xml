PRIME MINISTER<br />
CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
" TERRA AUSTRALIS TO AUSTRALIA" CONFERENCE<br />
CANBERRA 21 AUGUST 1988<br />
The Australian Academy of Humanities is doing itself and the<br />
nation a great service in sponsoring, as the centrepiece of<br />
its Bicentennial activities, this conference " Terra<br />
Australis to Australia".<br />
It is a pleasure for me as Prime minister to open the<br />
Canberra week of the conference which is to be devoted to<br />
analysing multicultural Australia.<br />
Because if it is to have real significance, our Bicentenary<br />
celebrations must be marked not only by times of great<br />
rejoicing not only by magnificent sights such as Sydney<br />
Harbor on Australia Day but also by the serious process of<br />
assessment of our national identity.<br />
In studying multicultural Australia, this conference will<br />
indeed be probing close to the heart of our national<br />
identity. In our Bicentenary year it is most appropriate that we note<br />
the truth that Australia is a land of immigrants.<br />
Immigration to Australia Mis extended over the full two<br />
hundred years of our European history.<br />
The foundations of our free society were built upon the<br />
labour of English, Scottish, Welsh and Irish pioneers, many<br />
of them sent to this land in chains. in the nineteenth<br />
century they were joined by farmers from Germany, goldminers<br />
from China, and plantation labourers from the Pacific<br />
Islands.<br />
Through the massive post-war influx of people from Greece,<br />
Italy, The Netherlands, Eastern Europe and elsewhere,<br />
through the subsequent arrival of settlers from Lebanon and<br />
Turkey, in the trauma of the aftermath of the Vietnam War,<br />
successive waves of immigrants have sought to build a new<br />
life in this land.<br />
We should not fool ourselves into thinking that life for the<br />
new arrivals was easy that they were always welcomed with<br />
open arms that there was no hostility directed at them by<br />
existing residents of this land. 1289<br />

<p>But where in the past, Australians frequently reacted with<br />
fear, and selected immigrants on the basis of race, colour<br />
or nationality; and where in the past we somewhat vainly<br />
hoped to assimilate immigrants so that they looked, ate,<br />
dressed and played just like ' an Australian', more recently<br />
we have had a bolder and a fairer vision.<br />
Successive post-war governments Labor and conservativehave<br />
moved to a principle of non-discrimination in selecting<br />
immigrants, and to the policy of multiculturalism in<br />
integrating them within a diverse but cohesive Australian<br />
society.<br />
As a nation we have come to accept that all Australians<br />
whether Aboriginal Australians, descendants of the First<br />
Fleeters, or new arrivals have a right, within the law, to<br />
develop their cultures and to contribute them to the wider<br />
Australian society.<br />
It is regrettable, but broadly true, that each group of new<br />
arrivals in Australia has been greeted by predictions that<br />
they will never be successfully integrated into the<br />
Australian community.<br />
But the reality of the Australian experience is that each<br />
group of new arrivals has successfully defied those<br />
predictions. Their success is an essentially Australian one.<br />
The blending of cultures, and their development within the<br />
Australian environment, has been a constant feature of the<br />
last 200 years and it is one of the special characteristics<br />
that makes us distinctively Australian.<br />
One of the great attributes of Australian society is its<br />
capacity to offer all ne wcomers a fair go. one of the<br />
enduring aspects of the Australian identity is its<br />
diversity. This is not to say that Australia has no central values.<br />
The reverse is true. our democratic institutions, our<br />
belief in the freedom of the individual, our commitment to<br />
the rule of law, our recognition of the creative worth of<br />
entrepreneurial initiative and of the beneficial role of the<br />
state in assisting those who need assistance, our shared<br />
language all these are fixed elements of the Australian<br />
community; values which we will not diminish.<br />
within this diversity, as I declared on Australia Day this<br />
year, the one test of Australian identity is commitment to<br />
the future of our nation. It is that commitment not<br />
colour, or ethnic origin, or religion, or cultural<br />
background that makes one ' an Australian'.<br />
1 290 I-</p>
<p>I am proud to be the Prime Minister of a nation which, with<br />
bipartisan political support, has followed this enlightened<br />
and decent path into the future. Under my leadership I give<br />
my pledge, I give my Government's pledge, that there will be<br />
no turning back.<br />
Now, for many years it would have been unnecessary for a<br />
political leader of either party to spell out such basic<br />
facts about the community.<br />
Because for as long as most of us can remember, the major<br />
political parties have been at one on the central issues of<br />
immigration and ethnic affairs.<br />
There has been a bipartisan recognition that discrimination<br />
should play no part in our selection of potential immigrants<br />
or our treatment of new settlers. For many years, official<br />
Australian attitudes towards migrants have been<br />
characterised by decency and tolerance. And, in part as a<br />
consequence, these attitudes have permeated through most of<br />
the community.<br />
In these circumstances I would be avoiding my<br />
responsibilities as Prime Minister of this country if in<br />
addressing you tonight I did not take head-on the issues of<br />
this debate.<br />
The current debate about immigration has seen the collapse<br />
of that bipartisanship. It has seen a dramatic and tragic<br />
erosion of the web of consensus that united the political<br />
parties on this issue. And it has been accompanied by a<br />
marked increase in the explicitly racist tempo and<br />
temperature of comment in some parts of the community.<br />
The Opposition leader has explicitly called for a slow down<br />
in the rate of Asian immigration.<br />
He refused to associate himself with the Bicentennial<br />
Multicultural Foundation because of the word<br />
" multicultural".<br />
He patronised ethnic communities and effectively encouraged<br />
the creation of ethnic enclaves by allowing as he put it<br />
" the right of people of say, Greek descent to preserve Greek<br />
customs and Greek language within their own family." I<br />
emphasise " within their own family" as though to speak a<br />
language other than English on the streets, to dance<br />
something more exotic than the quick step, was unacceptable.<br />
The National Party leader has said explicitly: " Asian<br />
immigration has to be slowed," because there are " too many<br />
Asians coming into Australia."<br />
The Nationals' Senate leader has called euphemistically for<br />
bringing the immigration stream " back into better balance"<br />
which means reducing the " excessively high proportion of<br />
immigrants from Asia". 1291 </p>
<p>These comments are unprecedented in contemporary Australian<br />
politics in their discriminatory references to race. They<br />
are as ugly as they are blatant. And yet they stand<br />
unretracted by those who uttered them.<br />
Mr Howard is currently campaigning on what he deceptively<br />
calls a " one Australia" policy.<br />
if by the notion of " one Australia" we mean a cohesive<br />
society, free of conflict, in which all Australians have a<br />
fair go, and in which all are committed to our nation, them<br />
that is squarely within my concept of multiculturalism.<br />
If " one Australia" means that we respect the institutional<br />
structure of our society the rule of law, parliamentary<br />
democracy, English as our national language then that is<br />
central to multiculturalism.<br />
And significantly, these concepts are precisely central to<br />
the concept of multiculturalism articulated and given effect<br />
to by Mr Howard's predecessor Malcolm Fraser.<br />
To this extent, then, Mr Howard is not articulating a new<br />
truth about Australia because commitment to Australia and to<br />
its institutions has always been an essential element of<br />
multiculturalism. Cohesion within Australia has always been<br />
the partner of our cultural diversity.<br />
But Mr Howard's " one Australia" concept is not just about<br />
those things. It is based upon the belief that all<br />
Australians have to conform to one set of unchanging<br />
attitudes; it doubts the commitment of immigrants to this<br />
country; and it implies that certain Australians, by reason<br />
of race or ethnic origin, are less able to integrate into<br />
Australian society.<br />
In a recent speech, Mr Howard extended his " one Australia"<br />
slogan to cover other issues issues of industrial<br />
relations, equality of opportunity and Aboriginal Affairs.<br />
In short, " one Australia" is a Trojan horse, a slogan for a<br />
broad ideology of reaction which Mr Howard is trying to<br />
develop, to bolster his leadership, now that he has no<br />
credibility on central issues of economic policy making.<br />
In the field of immigration and ethnic affairs, the " one<br />
Australia" ideology seems to connote a return to the dark<br />
days of narrow-minded intolerance, fear of difference and<br />
pressure to assimilate.<br />
It is less about uniting Australians than dividing them.<br />
Mr Howard himself may not share these views of that minority<br />
in our community which is explicitly intolerant and racist.<br />
But he is playing with fire since that minority sees<br />
Mr Howard's current position as lending support to their<br />
ugly beliefs.<br />
1292 </p>
<p>It is not insignificant that the " one Australia" slogan is<br />
shared with an extremist right-wing organisation which is<br />
currently pushing a particularly distasteful brand of<br />
anti-Asian politics.<br />
The papers presented at this conference reveal that such<br />
extreme views have often been espoused in the past. But<br />
there is no place for them in the present. And they must<br />
not be allowed to determine or detract from our future.<br />
The truth has to be understood clearly.<br />
It is not good enough for Mr Howard to talk of " one<br />
Australia" on the one hand while standing by his<br />
discriminatory and inflammatory comments about Asians.<br />
I want to make it clear that the breach of bipartisanship on<br />
immigration and ethnic affairs issues has been a unilateral<br />
one from within the conservative side of, politics.<br />
I deliberately say " from within" the conservative side of<br />
politics. For you will have noticed that in my earliest<br />
public statements following the Howard/ Sinclair/ Stone<br />
utterances I have said that there are decent people on the<br />
other side for whom these positions would be as repugnant as<br />
they are to me. My judgement has proved correct and I pay<br />
tribute to those who are seeking to restore decency and<br />
sanity to the conservative position.<br />
It is therefore not impossible to restore bipartisanship on<br />
a non-discriminatory immigration policy and on<br />
multiculturalism. Indeed it is in all our interests, and in the interests of<br />
future generations of Australians, that bipartisanship be<br />
restored. But it can only be done if Mr Howard retracts those<br />
distasteful comments he has made and silences those in the<br />
coalition parties who have echoed him.<br />
And it can only be done if the policy making forums of the<br />
Opposition reject any proposal that race or ethnic origin<br />
become a criterion in the selection of new migrants.<br />
The alternative Government of Australia must not persist<br />
with its policy by codeword that basically suggests people<br />
of particular races or ethnic origins threaten the social<br />
cohesion of the nation.<br />
On the other hand, if the Opposition insists on injecting<br />
discrimination back into the Australian immigration debate,<br />
then my response is clear.<br />
I hope that it will never be necessary to fight an election<br />
on this issue, but I have said that if it is necessary I<br />
will fight on it. Because of my belief in the innate<br />
decency of the Australian electorate, I believe we would win<br />
such an election. 1293<br />
_ I </p>
<p>6..<br />
But I would rather lose an election than allow this country<br />
to descend by default into the abyss of discrimination. To<br />
allow that descent would be both morally repugnant and<br />
economically insane.<br />
There will be no discrimination by this Government. There<br />
will be no return to the White Australia policy. We will<br />
not run the risk that official administrative discrimination<br />
against Asians today will tomorrow expand to other races,<br />
other ethnic communities, other religious groups.<br />
Let us talk facts.<br />
We are a very different society from the colonial outpost of<br />
1888. We are a very different society from the Australia of<br />
1938 whose ties of trade, defence and immigration were so<br />
closely aligned to Britain.<br />
We are, in fact, a multicultural country. Today some 40% of<br />
Australians were born overseas or have parents born<br />
overseas. Half of them are from non-English speaking<br />
backgrounds. we cannot turn back the clock. We have no<br />
desire to.<br />
As the Premier of New South Wales, Mr Greiner, put it<br />
recently: " I don't think the debate is, should we have<br />
multiculturalism or not? I think that's a non-debate. I<br />
think the question is how do you make multiculturalism<br />
which is the society we've got how do you make it work?"<br />
Clearly, one way to make it work is through bringing some of<br />
the one million or so people who are Australian residents<br />
but not Australian citizens under the umbrella of<br />
citizenship. In July, in my electorate of Wills, I had the moving<br />
experience of presenting citizenship certificates to<br />
Australians who had come to this country from 25 countries.<br />
It was obvious that'those there saw citizenship as a symbol<br />
of commitment to Australia. So too does my Government. it<br />
is for that reason that we have made 1988/ 89 a year to<br />
promote citizenship. This will build upon the pride in our<br />
national identity which has emerged in this Bicentennial<br />
year. No-one will be pushed or dragged into becoming a citizen.<br />
If citizenship is to symbolise commitment for those<br />
Australians who have chosen this nation as their home, it is<br />
important to keep citizenship a voluntary act.<br />
An open and democratic society must seek to persuade people<br />
of the advantages of citizenship not force or compel them.<br />
Indeed compulsion would be almost a contradiction of such an<br />
open and democratic society.<br />
The Government's aim in the coming year will be to publicise<br />
the importance of citizenship, and to make all Australians<br />
aware including those born here of theiTF-ights and<br />
responsibilities as full participants in our society.<br />
1294 </p>
<p>Finally, let us not ignore the international perspective of<br />
this debate.<br />
It has become a truism over recent decades to assert that<br />
Australia's future is inextricably tied with that of Asia.<br />
This presents us with the great challenge, and the great<br />
opportunity, of participating in and contributing to the<br />
prosperity of the most dynamic region of the world the<br />
economies of the Pacific Rim.<br />
Australia cannot pretend to exploit those opportunities, to<br />
compete in those markets, while hiding behind the<br />
protectionist barriers of tariffs and quotas. We are<br />
striking down those barriers.<br />
Nor in exactly the same way can we pretend to be part of<br />
Asia while hiding behind a 1980s version of the discredited<br />
White Australia policy.<br />
We have struck down that policy and we will not<br />
countenance its revival.<br />
Our future prosperity depends on it.<br />
As the Prime Minister of Singapore, Lee Kuan Yew, was<br />
reported recently as saying, Australia risks becoming the<br />
" very poor relations" of Asia if we fail to link up with our<br />
region. It is with Australia's future in mind, that I return to the<br />
auspicious occasion which has brought us all here.<br />
This international conference has been mounted by the<br />
combined work of many Australian institutions, sponsors and<br />
organisers. And I thank Esso Australia for its generous<br />
sponsorship of the conference.<br />
For the conference is not only an academic exercise; it has<br />
great value for the whole Australian community. I am<br />
pleased to note that its proceedings will be published as<br />
Stories of Australian Migration and will also be broadcast<br />
on radio. in thsway I hope that some of the great variety<br />
of visions of Australia past, present, and future, will<br />
become better known and understood by Australians.<br />
It gives me great pleasure to declare open the second<br />
session of the ' Terra Australis to Australia' conference and<br />
to wish you all well in your deliberations. .129 </p>
