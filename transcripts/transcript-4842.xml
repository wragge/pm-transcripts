11 AUSTRL<br />
FOR PRESS 8 OCTOBER 1978<br />
NEW SOUTH WALES ELECTION<br />
I congratulate Mr Wran on his very significant, personal victory.<br />
It was a personal success for the Premier who distanced himself<br />
during the campaign from the ALP, and from traditional ALP<br />
policies in an elect ion fought largely on State issues.<br />
Obviously, I am disappointed with the Liberal result<br />
in New South Wales. Mr Coleman fought a courageous camipaign.<br />
He was handicapped by the briefness of his own term as<br />
Leader of the Opposition, and I much regret that for<br />
the time being at least, Mr Coleman is lost to the Parliamentary<br />
Liberal Party in New South Wales.<br />
Mr Wran depicted his Government as moderate and as seeking<br />
to restrain Government expenditure and to reduce taxation.<br />
He was-able to avoid tax increases over three.-State Budgets<br />
and during the course of this year to offer significant tax<br />
concessions to New South Wales, because of the financial policies<br />
that the Commonwealth Government has introduced over the<br />
same period.<br />
Indeed, it is worth noting that all State Governments have<br />
managed to avoid tax increases over that period. This could not<br />
have happened were it not for the financial arrangements made<br />
by the Commonwealth.<br />
During the campaign, the Premier pointed to the significant<br />
economic progress being made in New South Wales. He pointed<br />
to the improving economic performance in New South Wales industry<br />
and to the fact that the run-away increase in unemployment<br />
had been halted.<br />
Mr Wran claims this as a credit for his government. While not<br />
begrudging him, I do point out that the improvement would not<br />
have been possible had it not been for the overall economic<br />
policies of the Commonwealth Government, policies designed<br />
to overcome inflation and restore profitability.<br />
Indeed, during the elections, Mr Wran said he was at one with the<br />
Commonwealth in its fight against inflation.<br />
The Commonwealth welcomes Mr Wran's support, and the support of<br />
other Premiers in the fight against inflation, I am quite certain<br />
that the economic progress which Mr Wran spoke of during the<br />
course of the elections will be continued in New South Wales,<br />
and in the rest of Australia as a result of the Federal Government's<br />
policies. Clearly, these policies will operate with greater<br />
effect when they have the support of State Governments. </p>
