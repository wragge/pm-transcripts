I Send my cordial greetings to members<br />
of the Australian Jewish Community as they celebrate<br />
their Now Your. On this most important holiday In the<br />
Jewish Calendar, It Is appropriate to look over the<br />
past year and to look foriard, to renew friendships.<br />
to cancel disputes, to eschew enmity, and to seek<br />
atonement in its real sense.<br />
These are admirable aims and reflect the<br />
contributions which people of the Jewish faith have<br />
made to Australia throughout our country's history*<br />
In turn, Australia has offered freedom and tolerance<br />
to all who Join her family* de look forward to a<br />
future of peaceful developnent In which, as in the<br />
past, the Jewish comunity . lI play a significant<br />
role.<br />
