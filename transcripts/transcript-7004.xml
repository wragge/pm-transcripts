PRIME MINISTER<br />
EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY<br />
ADDRESS BY THE PRIME MINISTER THIRD ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING<br />
BUSINESS COUNCIL OF AUSTRALIA SYDNEY 17 SEPTEN~ BER 1986<br />
The Australian community is increasingly coming to<br />
understand the dimension of the economic challenge<br />
confronting our nation.<br />
I am not here today to attempt by way of any rhetoric to<br />
increase that level of comprehension.<br />
Rather within a calm appraisal of our present and<br />
foreseeable economic environment I will announce to you<br />
several important new steps the Government is taking to put<br />
Australia into the best possible position to meet this<br />
challenge. It is now four weeks since the Budget.<br />
The Treasurer and I have explained the rationale of the<br />
Budget on many occasions over these weeks and I do not<br />
intend to go over that ground in any great detail today.<br />
The main point I have to make is quite straightforward.<br />
r,<br />
Like any househy,. d which falls on hard times Australia can<br />
for the pr-esent no longer maintain its accustomed living<br />
standards. We must face up to the reality of drastically<br />
lower world prices for much of what we expprt, prices that<br />
are unlikely to recover quickly in the short term.<br />
As a nation, we simply cannot go on indefinitely spending 6<br />
per cent more than we are earning and financing the<br />
difference by adding to our external debt.<br />
Accordingly the Budget is designed to slow the growth of<br />
public and private sector consumption and raise public<br />
sector saving. </p>
<p>2.<br />
it will thus directly reduce the public sector's claim on<br />
private sector saving and help to lessen Australia's need to<br />
import and to borrow from abroad. In this way it will also<br />
aid the process of domestic economic adjustment unleashed by<br />
the dramatic improvement in our international<br />
competitiveness over the past year and a half.<br />
In fact the dramatic fall in our terms of trade over the<br />
period simply brings into sharp focus a number of issues<br />
which have been on this Government's agenda these past three<br />
years. A consistent tenet of our economic policy has been the need<br />
to internationalise the Australian economy.<br />
This strategy has rested on three simple observations:<br />
First, the fastest growing economies o ver the last<br />
decade or so have been those which have placed greatest<br />
emphasis on export-oriented strategies.<br />
Second, whi le services and manufactures have been the<br />
fastest growing components of world trade, Australia's<br />
share of this trade has been steadily declining since<br />
the early seventies.<br />
Third, it has become very much tougher to sell into<br />
Australia's traditional export markets. The reasons are<br />
clear. Agricultural trade is corrupted by subsidies;<br />
and for this and other reasons several previously large<br />
net importers of foodstuffs have become self sufficient<br />
or large exporters. Moreover many metals and minerals<br />
are in chronic oversupply, partly because new technology<br />
has reduced the resource-intensity of world production.<br />
Of course export-oriented strategies are not just about<br />
exports. Just as it is true, as every first year economics<br />
student knows, that " a tariff a tax on exports", so it is<br />
true more generally that inefficiencies in any sector of the<br />
economy can ham~ per Australia's trading performance overall.<br />
So an essential pac~ t of our thrust to internationalise the<br />
Australian economy4 -ias been a series of initiatives to lift<br />
the performance of all sectors of the economy whether<br />
directly engaged in trade or not.<br />
By any standard the list of measures taken is impressive:<br />
Reform of the financial system, including floating the<br />
currency; Taxation reform incorporating substantial personal tax<br />
cuts and the ending of double taxation of dividends; </p>
<p>Incent ' i'ves for industrial research and development which<br />
are among the most generous in the world;<br />
Steps to reform the education and training systems;<br />
The steel, motor vehicle, ship building and heavy<br />
engineering industry plans;<br />
Incentives to promote the formation of venture capital<br />
companies; Liberalisation of foreign investment guidelines and<br />
administration; and<br />
Measures to reduce farm costs.<br />
Shortly I w'ill also be announcing major reform of the<br />
Commonwealth Public Service reforms to streamline and'<br />
rationalise public sector operations and thus contribute to<br />
a more efficient economy overall.<br />
Moreover substantial progress has been made in reducing the<br />
burden of business regulation.<br />
I provided a first report on progress in this area in my<br />
address to last year's Annual General Meeting. I will not<br />
repeat that list, except to provide an updating in just two<br />
cases. The BRRU estimates that in the first case the streamlining<br />
of Customis clearance procedures introduced last year the<br />
savingG clready being achieved by business amount to more<br />
the $ 30m a year. In addition, I am pleased to announce<br />
that, as Loreshadowed last year, all States have now agreed<br />
to a National Food Standards code, which it is estimated<br />
could save business a~ iout $ 50m per annum by elim~ inating the<br />
need to comaply with different standards in different States.<br />
In the past year the Government has continued to reduce the<br />
extent of regulation wherever possible. For example, the<br />
Commonwealth has withdrawn from regulating private<br />
hospitals, taken , further substantial steps to relax controls<br />
on foreign invest mnent and begun to phase out inspection of<br />
processed fruit and vegetables except where a requirement is<br />
imposed by the target market.<br />
I would add that business has had a major-input into the<br />
work of the Business Regulation Review Unit. Business was<br />
consulted in the drawing up of the priorities for the Unit.<br />
But, in addition, two people have been seconded by business<br />
groups to assist the BRRU. The Head of the Unit, Alan<br />
Moran, tells me tlat the work of these secondees has been<br />
invaluable and productive. </p>
<p>The last of the secondees will return shortly to his parent<br />
company and we have invited business groups to nominate four<br />
replacements. I cannot stress too heavily how important it<br />
is for the BRRU to gain the services of suitably qualified<br />
and experienced people with a business background.<br />
If the BRRU is to play the role the Government hopes for it,<br />
the Unit needs to be sensitive and responsive to the needs<br />
of business as well as the wider community interest. It is<br />
for this reason that I urge business leaders here today to<br />
consider seriously making quality people available to the<br />
Unit on a temporary basis.<br />
measures to improve the internal workings of our economy<br />
have been complemented by initiatives directly to improve<br />
Australia's ability to market goods overseas. These include<br />
the formation of Austrade and action at<br />
government-to-government level to secure Australia's access<br />
to key markets. In my Address to the Nation last June, I<br />
announced a number of further measures in this area,<br />
including the launch of a national export drive and<br />
initiatives to assist small exporters.<br />
But I can now say that the Government has taken further<br />
substantial steps to make it easier for Australian firms to<br />
meet world competition.<br />
The first concerns international marine insurance. In<br />
1984-85 premiums totalling about $ 800m were paid in respect<br />
of such business originating in Australia but only some<br />
per cent of this was written by Australia-based insurers.<br />
Stamp duty on international marine insurance contracts<br />
varies from State to State but invariably is substantially<br />
in excess of the world norm.<br />
The Government considers this to be an unnecessary<br />
impediment to the sale of insurance services by Australian<br />
insurers. Accordingly the Commonwealth has decided to<br />
remove duty on contracts written in the ACT as soon as<br />
possible but no later than end December.<br />
I have written to State Premiers and the Chief minister of<br />
the N. T. advising them of the Commonwealth's decision and<br />
requesting their co-operation in removing the duty<br />
Australia-wide.<br />
The second set of new measures I am announcing today<br />
concerns export controls.<br />
You may recall that in my address to your Annual General<br />
Meeting last year I said that the Government would relax or<br />
abolish or simplj-; , export controls wherever they no longer<br />
serve legitimate-ends or they involve excessive costs. </p>
<p>The Government has now decided to relax substantially<br />
controls on the export of crude oil and a range of minerals.<br />
In the case of crude oil surplus to domestic needs, prior<br />
approval of export prices no longer will be required. But<br />
prices will continue to be monitored to prevent avoidance of<br />
excise revenue.<br />
The requirement to obtain prior approval of negotiating<br />
parameters for coal export sales has been removed. In<br />
future, companies will only be required to seek approval of<br />
final settlements. Export approval will be given except<br />
where it would be against the national interest to do so.<br />
There will be early consultations with the Australian Coal<br />
Consultative Council to determine the basis for the exercise<br />
of this reserve power.<br />
Following de'Cailed consultations with industry initiated<br />
after my address to your last Annual General Meeting, we<br />
have also removed the requirement on exporters of bauxite<br />
and-alumina to obtain approval for their negotiating<br />
proposals. Henceforth transactions between unrelated parties, which<br />
account for 60 per cent of these exports, usually will be<br />
approved. The new arrangements also provide scope for<br />
simpler procedures in the case of transactions between<br />
related parties, which raise questions of transfer pricing<br />
and the associated scope for tax avoidance.<br />
Export controls on tungsten are to be terminated. This<br />
brings tungsten into line with tin, as these controls were<br />
lifted in July.<br />
Further deta'. ls of thesemeasures are being announced<br />
concurrently by the Acting Minister for Trade and the<br />
Minister for Resources and Energy.<br />
Taken together these steps represent a considerable easing<br />
of the regulatory burden affecting more than a quarter of<br />
total exports in 1985-86. They will give Australian mineral<br />
exporters much greater scope to respond flexibly to market<br />
opportunities as they arise a capacity which is so<br />
important in today's tough minerals markets.<br />
Uranium apart for which our position is clear and where we<br />
properly apply the most stringent safeguards in the world to<br />
ensure uranium cannot be diverted from peaceful purposes<br />
the Government will continue to review the remaining areas<br />
of export control to see whether they are still justified or<br />
could be made less burdensome. C. </p>
<p>This task will be carried forward as part of the work of a<br />
special Sub-Committee of Cabinet which was formed ( last<br />
night) to consider a number of specific areas in which<br />
action could be taken to reduce impediments to trade<br />
competitiveness.. The Sub-Commrittee, to be headed by the minister for<br />
Industry, Technology and Commerce, Senator Button, has been<br />
charged to examine and report to Cabinet on a number of<br />
specific reviews commissioned by Cabinet. Ministers have<br />
been requested to bring relevant papers and their<br />
recommendations to the Sub-Committee against defined<br />
deadlines, mostly staggered over the next few months.<br />
As well as the remaining export controls, papers relate to a<br />
number of issues including, for example, policy in respect<br />
of visa free entry of tourists and other short term visitors<br />
arnd a number of studies which are underway concerning<br />
transport and handling procedures.<br />
The formation of the Sub-Committee will enable proposals for<br />
change to be considered in an integrated and co-ordinated<br />
way but with the degree of urgency which our difficult<br />
trading conditions now require.<br />
of course the major impediment to exports in 1983 was the<br />
manifest uncompetitiveness of our economy.<br />
Real wages were too high. The exchange rate was too high.<br />
Today the story is very much different. Despite economic<br />
growth averaging about 4-5 per cent per annum, real wages<br />
have declined by 4 to 5 pei~ cent over the past three years.<br />
The significance of this point cannot be overstated. Since<br />
1949-50 there have been five occasions on which a year of<br />
weak economic growth has been followed by at least three<br />
years of strong economic growth.<br />
Apart from the period 1983 to 1986, in none of these cases<br />
did real wages decline over the period. The lowest<br />
comparable outcome was a rise of 1.5 per cent in the three<br />
years following 1977-78. In all other cases real wage<br />
growth has exceeded 6.7 per cent.<br />
Those who would decry the value of the Accord to the<br />
Australian economy would do well to heed those facts.<br />
Returning to the present, restraint in unit labour costs,<br />
combined with the 36 per cent decline in the value of the<br />
currency since 1983, has produced a profound improvement in<br />
the competitiveness of Australian manufacturing. Indeed<br />
Australia has not been as competitive for at least two<br />
decades. </p>
<p>By far the largest element in that improvement has been<br />
depreciation. while necessary to rid us of the encumbrances<br />
of the past, however, we cannot rely on on-going real<br />
depreciation to preserve our competitive edge.<br />
The only effective way for us to retain our competitive edge<br />
permanently is to take our destiny in our own hands, work<br />
harder and more effectively, and maintain firm wages<br />
restraint for as long as it takes a course to which my<br />
Government is resolutely committed.<br />
What we require in Australia at the moment is nothing more<br />
nor less than a thorough reshaping of our attitudes to work,<br />
to costs control and reasonable price-setting, to innovation<br />
and to risk taking. And that means not just exploiting our<br />
export competitiveness, but also our competitiveness against<br />
imports. That reference to impcrt substitution may strike some ears<br />
as sounding odd against a general policy thrust to<br />
internationalise Australia's economy. But, of course, it is<br />
perfectly consistent with that thrust.<br />
What is different now as compared with earlier periods of<br />
substantial import substitution is that it will take place<br />
not because we have hidden manufacturing away behind a<br />
higher wall of protection but because our relative costs are<br />
now such that we can compete. In fact the trend under this<br />
Government has been and will remain to reduce<br />
protection. Investment in additional productive capacity will, of<br />
course, be a critical element in Australia's ability to take<br />
advantage of our newfound competitiveness.<br />
For that reason it is particularly pleasing to note that new<br />
manufacturing investment in 1985-86 rose by 40 per cent in<br />
nominal terms, which by any stretch of the imagination also<br />
implies a substantial real increase and possibly as much<br />
as twice the 10 per cent real increase of 1984-85.<br />
Similarly it is pleasing to note that tourism-related<br />
activity has been well to the fore in the 40 per cent real<br />
increase in non-residential construction which has occurred<br />
in the past two years.<br />
Nevertheless it remains true that the share in GDP of<br />
business investment overall has been low in recent years<br />
compared with the average experience of the 1970' s and<br />
1980' s. And moreover, it is obvious that increased<br />
investment would be a powerful vehicle for increased<br />
productivity. </p>
<p>8.<br />
The Government is looking to the business sector for a far<br />
sighted appreciation of the fundamental change in<br />
Australia's economic circumstances over the past three<br />
years. while recognising that profitability varies as<br />
between firms and industries, it is nonetheless true that<br />
the profit share is now the best that it has been since the<br />
late 60' s and early 70' s. And the opportunities for<br />
business to invest in profitable export-oriented and import<br />
replacing activity rarely have been better.<br />
one of the least appreciated developments of recent years is<br />
the recognition that investment by Australian companies<br />
overseas can also be a spur to Australian exports. A recent<br />
survey by CEDA of major Australian exporters to the ASEAN<br />
region highlights the necessity for exporting firms to<br />
develop an adequate marketing and distribution presence in<br />
target markets overseas. 0<br />
I am aware of some cases in which Australian exporters with<br />
a substantial permanent presence overseas offer assistance<br />
to smaller exporters of complementary products. The benefit<br />
to the smaller exporter is the ability to tap into existing<br />
expertise and facilities to promote their products, to the<br />
mutual benefit of both companies.<br />
I can only applaud such " piggy back" arrangements. I have<br />
asked Austrade to establish a register of companies willing<br />
to assist smaller enterprises in this way and to stand ready<br />
to put potential partners in touch with each other.<br />
increased productivity, combined with wage moderation<br />
consistent with our straitened economic circumstances, is<br />
essential if we are to trade our way out of our current<br />
difficulti~ es. And that response cannot be a short-lived<br />
one. A permanent improvement in our competitiveness cannot<br />
occur without a permanent improvement in the quality and<br />
productiveness of our work.<br />
I have been drawing attention for some time now to the need<br />
for management and labour to work together more effectively<br />
and more efficiently.<br />
And, indeed, many business people have told me their<br />
particular stories of how unions and management have worked<br />
quickly arnd co-operatively over recent years to review<br />
thoroughly the way work is organised. In each case the<br />
objectives have been improved quality, greater flexibility,<br />
improved productivity and sustained growth of sales.<br />
But in view of the rapid deterioration in our terms of<br />
trade, which is now slicing $ 6 billion from our national<br />
income, our pressing need is to speed up the<br />
internationalisation of the Australian economy. This has<br />
given a new urgency to the task of workplace reform. </p>
<p>we simply can no longer afford to retain many of the work<br />
and management practices which grew up or were agreed to in<br />
earlier periods, when trading conditions were less<br />
demanding. Our competitors produce high quality products, on time and<br />
within budget. We must learn to do the same.<br />
I have spoken, over the past few weeks, to representatives<br />
of both business and unions, to highlight the Government's<br />
concern that workplace reforms should now receive greater<br />
priority. The response has been very heartening.<br />
Representatixves of BCA, CAI and the ACTU have agreed to<br />
participate at a meeting which I will convene in Melbourne<br />
on Wednesday, 24 September.<br />
The parties have agreed to meet with one very clear<br />
objective. This will be no talk fest. The parties agree<br />
that reform is~ both necessary and urgent and moreover that<br />
they do not need to waste time telling each other so.<br />
Rather the o.' jective of that meeting will be to discuss<br />
practical wa3ys to give added impetus to this task of<br />
boosting productivity. All aspects will be on the table<br />
all aspects of work and management practices within the<br />
overall context of seeking to achieve the optimum invostment<br />
and productive strategy calculated to meet the economic<br />
challenge facing our country.<br />
The role of Government initially will be limited to<br />
convening the meeting. Once that is done we will withdraw<br />
to allow the parties to ddress the questions which only<br />
they can resolve.<br />
The Government of course will stand ready subsequently to<br />
provide whatever further assistance the parties themselves<br />
may consider necessary.<br />
The meeting next week, being a meeting of peak councils,<br />
cannot resolve issues which require a detailed knowledge of<br />
particular industries, enterprises or, in some cases,<br />
plants. However I look to the meeting next week to face squarely how<br />
to encourage the most productive dialogue between those best<br />
able to effect change.<br />
I call upon all parties to approach this task with energy<br />
and foresight. A little vision and a large measure of<br />
co-operative leadership at this stage can set Australia<br />
firmly on the course of sustained economic growth in the<br />
challenging new environment now confronting us. </p>
<p>The meeting next week will, of course, be only the very<br />
start of what must of necessity be a painstaking process.<br />
But it is a very necessary first step.<br />
To succeed there must be others in unions, in firms, in<br />
industries prepared to take up the challenge and carry<br />
forward the impetus to co-operative change and reform.<br />
I have every confidence in the capacity of ordinary<br />
Australians, when confronted with the facts, to respond<br />
constructively. Ladies and gentlemen<br />
The measures I have announced today will, I believe, be<br />
welcomed responsibly by the business community. That sense<br />
of responsibility derives from our shared knowledge that the<br />
private sector provides seventy five per cent of employment<br />
in Australia.<br />
A healthy, competitive private sector means more jobs and<br />
more secure jobs. And that sense of responsibility means<br />
equally, I believe, an understanding by the business<br />
community of its obligation to respond positively and<br />
co-operatively in its investment and management strategies<br />
to maximise the opportunities for growth and employment.<br />
Australia is facing a crucial time in its history. The task<br />
is large but it is by no means insurmountable. moreover the<br />
instruments to deal with it are to hand.<br />
These instruments are as pervasive as they are powerful.<br />
They include:<br />
A massive real depreciation of the order of 30 per<br />
cent since end 1984;<br />
A Budget to support adjustment in the current account<br />
but also, as sentiment improves, to permit lower<br />
interest rates;<br />
An approach to wages policy which will produce real<br />
wages outcc. nes consistent with our new circumstances;<br />
Government measures both longstanding and recent to<br />
promote adjustment and to internationalise Australian<br />
primary, secondary and service industries; and<br />
most of all, the determination and co-operation of the<br />
Australian people.<br />
Together this is an unbeatable combination. </p>
