<p>The Australian Government today took another step towards giving people with disability the care and support they need over their lifetimes, with the introduction of the National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS) Bill into Parliament.</p>
<p>The Gillard Government has delivered $1 billion for the first stage of a National Disability Insurance Scheme.</p>
<p>From the middle of next year, an NDIS will be real for more than 20,000 people with disability in five launch sites across the country - in the Barwon area in Victoria, the Hunter in New South Wales and across South Australia, Tasmania and the Australian Capital Territory.</p>
<p>An NDIS will ensure people with disability, wherever they live, receive care and support based on their needs, and have choice and control over this support.</p>
<p>The Bill will give people with disability the right to realise their potential in life, and to make choices and be in control of the decisions that affect their lives.</p>
<p>The Bill establishes the NDIS Launch Transition Agency as an independent body (under the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act 1997) to deliver the scheme. </p>
<p>The NDIS Agency will work with people with disability to develop a personal plan that identifies their goals and aspirations, recognises the support they receive from family and friends, and provides a statement of the support they will receive through the NDIS.</p>
<p>The Bill also supports people to manage their own funding where they choose to do so.</p>
<p>The Bill has been heavily shaped by the feedback the Government has received from people with disability, their families, carers and service providers, during numerous consultations across the country.</p>
<p>The Government has asked the Parliament to refer the Bill to the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee for consideration, so that we can continue to receive feedback about this important reform. </p>
<p>We will also continue to work with states and territories as we work to build a National Disability Insurance Scheme.</p>
<p>People with disability, their families, carers and advocates will also have an opportunity to comment on the Bill on the Your Say forum on the NDIS website.</p>
