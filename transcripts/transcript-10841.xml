    <content><![CDATA[<p>
  I am pleased to announce that I shall visit Thailand from 23 to 26</p>
<p> April for discussions with the Prime Minister of Thailand, Mr Chuan</p>
<p> Leekpai, and to participate in activities commemorating the sacrifice</p>
<p> of Australian service men and women during the Second World War.</p>
<p>  I will open the Hellfire Pass Memorial Museum on 24 April and attend</p>
<p> ANZAC Day memorial services at Hellfire Pass and Kanchanaburi. These</p>
<p> sites have a special place in Australian history.</p>
<p>  In honouring the many Australians who died and served in Thailand,</p>
<p> I will be joined by a pilgrimage of Australian former POWs and war</p>
<p> widows, to be led by the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Mr Scott.</p>
<p> Many other Australians will be present for the ceremonies.</p>
<p>  It will be a great honour to be accompanied on my visit by Sir John</p>
<p> Carrick, Sir Reginald Swartz and Mr Tom Uren. These three distinguished</p>
<p> former Commonwealth ministers were POWs in Thailand during the Second</p>
<p> World War.</p>
<p>  I very much look forward to discussing with Mr Chuan the good progress</p>
<p> Thailand has made in implementing its economic reform programme and</p>
<p> stabilising its economy. Through its support for Thailand's IMF</p>
<p> package, Australia is making a significant contribution to the rebuilding</p>
<p> of international confidence in Thailand's economic prospects.</p>
<p>  A return to growth in Thailand, a significant trade and investment</p>
<p> partner, will bring benefits to Australia.</p>
<p>  I shall also call on His Majesty, the King of Thailand.</p>
<p>  22 March 1998</p>
