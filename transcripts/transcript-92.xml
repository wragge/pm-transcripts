SPEACN If THE P1RIM MINISTP&amp; THlE RT. HON.<br />
1* Q. MEIRS AT THlE OPINING Sip cas<br />
SONS NIMIL DINGS IRI 18? ULTAM<br />
Sirw I always begtn by saying " irw because like my friend<br />
Nr. YAlly I find that if I dont, I an bound to forget sombody -the<br />
first thing I vant to establish with you Is a feeling of sympathy for<br />
so, because when I have said a few words to you I hiave to proms a but-.<br />
tona It's here. I take it for granted that In an efficient Andu try<br />
of this kind It will work. ( Laughter) When one presses a button at<br />
Canberra the ' Division bells* ring ( Laughter) but an this occasion<br />
somethin lse will happen which will celebrate the opening of the<br />
Nov the first thing that I want to syis of a somewhat<br />
frivolous kind, I fear, but I'vo board about = at foods for half a<br />
day now, The romappears to be heavily ' lined with then. oftenever I<br />
my wife sitting with her growing band of smll aandchildren I<br />
find her scooping mysterious messes out of tins and pttingi them, into<br />
the unsuspecting mouath of the little child, and I oather from all this,<br />
that this really does the trick. In fact Hr, AHdgll, the second Mr.<br />
Edgell I thought, got in a piece of pretty m; art adlvertising about<br />
these ? wbiy foods Nverybody nodded szoept my friend R~ ose down there,<br />
who is a omptitor and who seemed to me to have a slight attack of<br />
the palsr at that moment. ( Laughter)<br />
But what Iwant to say to you is thiss Have a ; ood look at<br />
Out elly, and then have a good look at Tony Luchottiv Also have a<br />
good look at me. Do you know we didn't have azny of these babr foods<br />
when we vore young. ( Laughter) Think of what in joing to happen to<br />
the next generations They will be a race, of giants and that is, of<br />
course, nation-building In literally a big way.<br />
Sir there are two aspects of the economia development of<br />
our ounmtry 2Ai. h I think are sometimes overlooked jand are worth ntioning<br />
on an occasion like this.<br />
suficintThe first of them in that we have not yet, I t hink, tdec<br />
suffiientpride In the romantic stories of achievumnt by mon who<br />
began some th n w who took all the risks, who had the spirit of<br />
enterprise and who h;; auy built up something Oret and useful. Here<br />
we have today a perfect example of It In the case of the 13dgell 19ater-.<br />
i see. Mro Edgellg the Chairman, I thought, sph_ 1 with proper pride,<br />
twith som little modesty about his own contribution to this matter.<br />
Who would have supposed In 1926 that anything like -this aould have<br />
occurred, not only here, but elsewhere in Australia, Nobody would<br />
have dreamed of It, When he spoke to you about * oanning' and the<br />
developmunt of " armingO and the early stages of it he might very<br />
well but for his modesty, have, told you that he with what today<br />
woulA appear to be a very modest sm of MOMAy, ah; r the first world<br />
war,, went over with in effect, his gratuityhialo nesadben<br />
to work in canning lactories in the United Sates -so that he might<br />
learn himself, through his own hands and through hown mind what<br />
ought to be done about it.<br />
Nov this is something that exhibits courage and Imagination<br />
and as a family enterprise It has found every unit in It filled with<br />
the ame spirit. And here today I have the great honour, and my wife<br />
. ms the great tonourp of being here at an opening which marks another<br />
big 3tep in the history of an enterprise which Is a: lready, of course,<br />
a household name in Australia. We want to be proud of these things.<br />
I never did manage to jet very such respect in my mind for sa mawho<br />
ti a process of speculation,, lucky or otherwise, made a vast<br />
fortune but I have an unqualified, admiration for people who have been<br />
oons tructive who have built up great thinjs In Aust~ ralia* Look what<br />
this family ? iitory has done for this delightful city of Bathurst,<br />
for this district, for this State.<br />
One could point to a dozen instances just like that or simlar<br />
developments in other branches of industry, beginning with nothing, </p>
<p>exeapt a high spirit plenty of intelli,, noe , plenty of imagination<br />
and = alimited determiation and we, who are he beneficiaries to these<br />
thin,, s, ought to acowod~ o that benoit, I think and treat such<br />
developaient with th. respect that they ar* e. ntitlAl to. They are 1z.<br />
deed charateristic of Australian history and nobody can ever under-.<br />
stand the economic growth of this country unless he poea and seeks to<br />
undar3tand the life story and tY* elife endeavours, of human beings,<br />
Now that I think is somethin-, that I hope dives yjou pridel it invariably<br />
2ns me both pride and pleasure, There in plenty of roam in<br />
this country, thank God, for young peopl. e of enterprise, plenty of<br />
doors to be opened and plenty of a ohievecienta to be made,<br />
The other aspect of our economic hisitory which cames within<br />
the span of my own lifetime is thist it isn't so long ajo that it was<br />
the aoepted theory that there was some Inevitable oonfliot between<br />
the interests of the mar. on the land and the Interests of the manufacturer.<br />
' We were told wn I was a boy that either you were in favour<br />
of secondary industry or you wore in favour of the farmer and you<br />
couldn't be In favour of both. This sorry nonsenir' has been long<br />
since disproved, but ne-ver could it be more eloquently disproved than<br />
an an occasion of this kinds because YO 3ou6e the perat aigniticaee<br />
of today is that the mn who grows thno wAother It is aspaaas<br />
or green peas, or carrots, or whatever It may be finds himself able<br />
to dispose of those things quite neartr howe to a processing works<br />
which Is a s od indiustry and which has the enormous advantads of<br />
Zetting its materi a at the source A~ nd fresh and ood, At the sam<br />
time it gives to him u i toady market and a Sro-dng miarket flor what he<br />
produoss. And ridht next to it Is the factory of Containers Ltd. a<br />
factory of a kind which one, would normally,, years ago, have * zpeotei<br />
to ' iM in a city and nowhere else. but here it is cheek tW Jowl<br />
with this one so that we have pure secondary industry, a flood pro..<br />
oessing inftstry and the . wving industry of the country, all brought<br />
together into one, comass. This is the most eloquent proof that the<br />
old Idea of Inevitablie division was a false onoo.<br />
For myself I amvery delighted because I stood, not In this<br />
room of course but in one of tWA others a long time ago -somebody<br />
told so and I A0it isn't true, that Itwas 19 years ago -and there<br />
was no hint of a enmaking factory at that time. There was no hint<br />
of this enossous expansion. I looked at It as something of Zroat<br />
interest something rather odd to find in, what 1 hope I may say with<br />
respect is, a provincial City not one of the great cities of the<br />
metropolis Pnd yet this arovth has gone Oo. Nov tbat, a_; ainq Is a<br />
matter of lense* satisfaction.<br />
But there are other causes for our satisfaction today, I<br />
bean by soae light-hearted remarks, at least I intended them to be<br />
light-hbearted# about baby fooda, Nov my wife,, naturally it'. inevitable<br />
in the course of nature understands more about babies than<br />
I do, and she has had a fair experienae of them,, including as I said<br />
now, am* Randhilre half a 4osen of them and ahe has travelled<br />
a great deal, not only over the length and breadth of this country<br />
but around a jood deal of the world and she made a very good point to<br />
me today as we were walking about. She saids " You knowq when you<br />
consider the hardships, the difficulties that so many hu&amp; dreds of<br />
thousandso or perhaps millions of young mothers put up with In the<br />
past, una&amp; 1e perhaps byreason of where they lived or the ciromstanoes<br />
or transport, to get te fresh food that they woould require, what a<br />
4onderful thin i t has been for mankind that this food processing<br />
industry s houald have s hown such a pheno mnl growth in recent times s<br />
food that an be relied on, food that lasts, food that can be transi..<br />
ported with ease, These are wonderful thiLngs for people to be able to<br />
deta. I have beon through one or two great food processing<br />
establishments in Australia and again I have a great pride in themi,<br />
beeause they have the highest possible standard not only of buisiness<br />
efficienqq but of cleanliness and of quality aA the result is, that<br />
whereas at one stage earlier in my lir fpeople had a certain reluctance,<br />
perhaps about some types of camied food, today it has become the<br />
commonplace of life, And as the pressure of lifo increwa so Will </p>
<p>the demand for Soods of quality available in a proper condition be<br />
bound to rise* My friend, mr. Kelly, who has had a lot of activity in th~ ese<br />
matters referred to the problem of decentralization. Decntralization<br />
In a first-class Ideal* It is indeed, expressing iLt broadly, essential<br />
but it is extraordinarily difficult. You cannot decentralize<br />
an industry merely by passing an Act of Parliament, merely by pron-.<br />
ouncizig a 0overuuaent poliq7, merely by some personal or public<br />
advocacy, because in the long run the hard economics of industry will<br />
have a profound effect on where that industry Is to go* Consequently,<br />
ono doesn't expect to find a great stoel workcs hiands of miles away<br />
from the source of its iron arnd its coal. One doesn't expect to find<br />
heavy indus tries in dihich the handling ofproduots becomes a matter of<br />
extraordinary cost, establishing themselves miles away from the neigh.<br />
bourhood of the resources that they need. The great thing to aim at<br />
in decentralization is to consider always whether the isture of the<br />
industry is of such a kind that it lends itself to encouragement and<br />
developmnent outside the city areas. Here we have, once more, a<br />
splendid example. And, of course, the economic advantages are not confined to<br />
thiose that may be worked out for you by an Accountant in black and<br />
white. There are other advantages, There is one Lm the case of these<br />
works$ I am perfectly cer" an that is the spirit of local pride and<br />
of local teamwork that can exist between the employer and the employed.<br />
That is not so omon in a big city where business tends to be impersonal<br />
wvhere the man lives in one place and works in another., and It's<br />
a day's work,. It must be extremely diffñ' ttxlt under those ciroaustances<br />
to develop this local pride which does produe offlcienc', which doos<br />
produce a pood understanding# and which does produce productivity of<br />
the highest kind, Buat you got it in a place like this, and In an<br />
enterprise like this. That* I think, is something which is 4enunely<br />
an econamic advantage, though it may never be capable of being<br />
expressed in a 9 sand d tabulation.<br />
I was delighted, today, when I heard Mr. Edgell pay<br />
that tribut, to the people who had worked oni the construction of the<br />
machines being used In there. He wasnit, employing a form of words,<br />
you noticed; he spoke with genuine feelingg ; h was enthusiastic about<br />
It ; he kno that he had a team of people and that they were working as<br />
a LXam And I believe SiLr, that in the long run as we beamse wiser<br />
and wiser on these madters, if not you and at least our successors,<br />
are bound to become wiser and wiser, even Mr. ILchtti's successor If<br />
he ever has one ( Laughter) my turm out to be wiser and wieer,* But as<br />
we all improve, wes and our successors, will, I believe, discover more<br />
and more that the true future of Australia# as a producers as an exporter,<br />
as a competitor in the world is doing to depend more and c'<br />
upon genuine co-operation and enthusiasm and understanding in the fields<br />
of employmient so that everybody who works in an enterprise has same<br />
feeling of pride in what it is producingg a pride In what it is doing<br />
for his towni and for his district and is therefore not an unwilling<br />
servant, but a willing co-operator in the task. Anid that spirit, I do.<br />
teat in this Vlaae, on all aides, and I thought it was admirably expressed,<br />
as I ve said, by Mr. odgell.<br />
Now, ladies and pentlmnen p yo had a bit of a burst of<br />
speechusnaking -wday and I'm going to desit I satisfy myself by say-<br />
Ing that it has given me unmommon pleasure to ocaic up here today to<br />
have a look at what goes on, to meet soaw of my old friends and ooet<br />
new ones, in particular the Mayor, who has been most courteous and gracious<br />
to us today, And havin said that I will now perform the final<br />
act, that is to say and don t hold me blameworthy, if it doesn't omoff<br />
this will be one thing you can't blam me for ( Laughter) I now<br />
declare these buildings open and I press the button. </p>
