SPEECH BY TUB PRIME MINISTER<br />
OPENING CEREMONY OF THE COMMONWEALTH HEADS or GOVERNMENT MEETING<br />
NASSAU# THE BAHAMAS 16 OCTOBER 1965<br />
EMBARGO UNTIL DELIVERY<br />
We Commonwealth leaders assembled here at Nassau are the<br />
inheritors of a great tradition. It. is the tradition of<br />
a Commonwealth emerged from Empirej like most great traditions<br />
it is not without flaw or blemish.<br />
But the very fact that we are a Commuonwealth that has emerged<br />
from Empire with a greater measure of common purpose is itself<br />
a measure of the strength of this tradition.<br />
Let us at the outset of this Meeting ask ourselves the question<br />
what have been the elements, the secret if you like, of<br />
that strength? And let us ask that queation seeking to find<br />
in the answer a guide in discharging our high responsibilities.<br />
If I could put it in a simple phrase, I believe the essence<br />
of that strength has been in an understanding of the -limits<br />
of power.<br />
Let me be precise. In the immediate post-war period, it<br />
would have been possible for Britain to maintain for longer<br />
than it did the colonia~ l status of the Indian sub-continent.<br />
It had the instruments of power to do so, but it understood<br />
the limits of that power.<br />
And those limits were understood through a xroper perception<br />
of the force of other rights and interests which together<br />
constituted a countervailing power. These included the right<br />
and determination of peoples to be free to determine their<br />
different destinies; and it included an enlightened self-interest<br />
on the part of a Britain which understood that, in the long<br />
term, its own economic* political and strategic concurns<br />
would be better protected by accommodating the new realities. </p>

This countervailing powar Is not so MusceptkblO to measurement<br />
as the power that can be accounted in battaliana, aquadrons<br />
and the elements of military and economic we&amp; ponry. Dut<br />
all our hietory as a Commvionwalth has shown that it is no<br />
loes real for that reason. It has an inexorabla ca~ pacity<br />
to grow and ultimately to overcome those who would take refuge<br />
in this sterile accounting of conventional power.<br />
Some would argue that# at times, tuhe limits of power have<br />
not been understood sufficiantly early. It has been argued<br />
of 3ritain. it has been equally argued of Auatralis, in<br />
relation to Papuai Now Guinea.<br />
But I rapeat, we assemle as a unique institution representing<br />
a quarter of the world's population, one third of its sovereign<br />
and independent nations, meating as equalo bacac~ ue, however<br />
falteringly at times, we have together learned the limits<br />
of power.<br />
Anrd that learning process has given the Commonwealth a particular<br />
capacity to recognioe in time the need for changal to discern<br />
civilised directiono for change; and, at important moment.,<br />
to be an effective agent for change.<br />
If my answer then to this question what is the secret of<br />
the strength of our Commonwealth tradition is correct,<br />
I believe it can usefully inform our approach to the major<br />
issues beforo us in the coming week.<br />
Without doubt the predominant of these is, and ahould be,<br />
South Africa~, an issue of historic concern to the Comonwalth.<br />
If ever thero was &amp; i regime which should have learnt from<br />
our experience the leason of the limits of power it is that<br />
in South. Af rica.<br />
They are the sterile accountants of our day wtho would measure<br />
their capacity to insulate themsealves against tho presoure<br />
of inevitable change by the size of their military arsenal.<br />
They are wrong. For the force of that countorvailing power<br />
is growing, it is inexorable and it is unquenchabla. The<br />
spirit of man and women yearning to be fre, to have that<br />
right to daterminG thsir own dectiny will not be extineuished.<br />
it will not be extinguishe~ d, however brutally that arsenal<br />
is unleashed upon themn.<br />
The world that ia witness to evento in South Africa is bacoming<br />
increasingly impatient. I believe it ir3 loafting to uo to<br />
draw upon our tradition, to seek to apply to IDouth Africa<br />
the lesions we have learned from our own experiencv.<br />
This will require us to strengthen, by our decisions, the<br />
countervailing power that is growing by the day within and<br />
outside South Africa. </p>
<p>This will require us to examine and to be prepared to implement<br />
the option of further effective economic sanctions.<br />
But just as importantly it will require us to sustain the<br />
flame of enlightened self-interest that has now been lit<br />
in South Africa, and is manifest in the recent talks in Lusaka<br />
between representatives of South African business and the<br />
ANC. For the fact is that all the economic capacity that<br />
haa been established in South Africa and which now disproportionatel)<br />
benefits the few, will only endure and be available for the<br />
benefit of all if a new, free and just South Africa io created.<br />
Equally, Australia believoo that all nations have a duty<br />
to encourage the two super powers to recognise the limits<br />
of power. They have the capacity not only to destroy each<br />
other a thousand times over but indeed to obliterate the<br />
human race from the face of this planet. This threat, and<br />
the aquandering of resources it entails, is now central to<br />
the concerno of mankind.<br />
And so, while repudiating the illusory calla of unilateral<br />
disarmament, we from thin Commonwealth have the opportunity<br />
to bring the pressure of our resolution upon the super powers<br />
to understand and discharge their obligations to all peoples<br />
to work for the progressive reduction of nuclear arsenals<br />
through balanced and verifiable agreements.<br />
The peoples of the South Pacific have themselves projected<br />
this resolve by their recent successful introduction of the<br />
South 7scific Nuclear ? ree Zone Treaty.<br />
Pinally, in our deliberations in the economic area we should<br />
acknowledge the limits of power. Australia believes that<br />
wo live in an era in which recognition of the mutual benefits<br />
of a multilateral trading system are in danger of disnppoaring.<br />
Increasingly there are those who would embrace the ultimataly<br />
self-defeating power of protectionism. This ic a dangerous<br />
outlook, and one which we should seek, by our work together,<br />
to dispel.<br />
We have learned from our experience, we reflect in our tradition,<br />
that conflict can give way to harmony. We rightly accept<br />
a3 an article of chared faith that the colour of people'@<br />
skin is as irrelevant as the colour of their eyes to their<br />
political, economic and social rights.<br />
Let us by our approach to our tack in the coming days, and<br />
by the docicions we take, not only confirm this article of<br />
faith within thi Comonwoalth but seek to maka it a roality<br />
for all those who look to us for help. </p>
