PRIME MINISTER<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P. J. KEATING, MP<br />
JOBSBACK 11-ATHING OF THE PAST ~ L Jr<br />
The statement yesterday by the Shadow Minister for Industrial Relations<br />
effectively re-launched the failed Coalition industrial relations policy,<br />
Jobsback. The new " evolutionary" policy has ostensibly lost the more nasty elements<br />
which made Jobsback so unpopular in 1993. On the face of it, one could<br />
interpret this as flattery: Mr Howard and Mr Reith appear to be admitting that<br />
Labor's policy of measured change in the labour market is right. But in truth<br />
the " admission" comes as a disguise for their traditional nasties.<br />
We are told that the three dollar per hour youth wage has been dropped, and<br />
current employees will only be on individual contracts if they choose. In other<br />
respects Jobsback is essentially intact.<br />
The only difference is the camouflage. The old wolves in wolves' clothing<br />
have reverted to being wolves in sheep's clothing.<br />
It is, of course, another step in the re-packaging of John Howard as an<br />
ideological cuddly, another ingredient in the making of a Coalition policy<br />
blancmange. Mr Reith appears to be selling the new policy on the basis that Australian<br />
workers who do not choose individual contracts will be protected in the future<br />
under current awards. Awards which under the Howard/ Reith system will<br />
apparently be frozen in time.<br />
Mr Reith either fails to understand or deliberately fails to address two<br />
fundamental problems with his policy. </p>
<p>First, contrary to Mr Reith's apparent assumption, the labour market is not a<br />
pool it is a river. There is a constant turnover of jobs. Each month 130,000<br />
new positions are filled. The people chosen to fill them new entrants and<br />
re-entrants to the labour market, those changing jobs will be fair game<br />
under the Howard/ Reith system.<br />
Employers will naturally take on those new workers under the cheapest<br />
individual contract.<br />
Presumably Mr Howard and Mr Reith are not oblivious to these facts.<br />
Presumably they know that in the last year over 1 1/ 2 million new job<br />
openings were filled. And because they also know that those wanting the<br />
award will not be preferred, they must know that under their system in time all<br />
employees will be subtly coerced into individual contracts.<br />
That means not a free labour market, but one based essentially on the Master<br />
and Servant provisions of the English Common Law. It does not mean a level<br />
playing field in the labour market: rather, it means a return to the inequality<br />
and authoritarianism of the past.<br />
Under the Howard/ Reith policy the safety net of minimum conditions will be<br />
much reduced. Among the conditions up for grabs will be overtime rates,<br />
shift allowances and holiday loadings.<br />
The essential difference between the new Jobsback and the old can be<br />
illustrated by the case of Mr Howard's driver. Under the old Jobsback his<br />
driver stood to lose the extra $ 100 a week he earns in overtime. Under the<br />
new Jobsback he can keep it he can stay on the award. It is the driver who<br />
replaces the present one who stands to lose; because he will be employed on<br />
an individual contract a contract he will have to negotiate from a position of<br />
profound weakness. In short, he can take it or leave it.<br />
Under the Howard/ Reith plan, the paid overtime and penalty rates on which<br />
so many Australians rely to make ends meet will increasingly become a thing<br />
of the past.<br />
Which is precisely how the new Jobsback might be described. It is a thing of<br />
the past. It is the old Jobsback in a cheap disguise.<br />
And what is the justification for these draconian plans? Low profits? No.<br />
Low employment growth? No. Low productivity growth? No. Industrial<br />
discord? Hardly. Mr Howard and Mr Reith have no case. What they have<br />
instead is the same ideological obsession they have always had.<br />
