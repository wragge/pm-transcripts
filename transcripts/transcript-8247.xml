SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
CONCLUSION OF THE PARLIAMENTARY DEBATE<br />
ON AUSTRALIA" S SUPPORT FOR THE UNITED NATIONS ACTION IN THE<br />
PERSIAN GULF<br />
22 JANUARY 1991<br />
Mr Speaker,<br />
The last two days of parliamentary debate have-&amp; bIe:<br />
historic significance. This Parliament has exhaustively<br />
debated one of the most serious issues ever to come before<br />
it: the commitment of the Australian armed forces to<br />
support military action authorised by the United Nations in<br />
the Gulf.<br />
I want at the outset to express my thanks to all those who<br />
have contributed to this debate, regardless of their party<br />
affiliation a debate which has lasted more than twenty<br />
hours and has involved more than one hundred speakers. I<br />
realise that this has not been an easy issue for any of us<br />
to confront. For the first time in twenty years, Australian<br />
forces are committed to combat. It will be to the lasting<br />
credit of this Parliament that we have confronted and<br />
debated this issue with realism, patience and a shared<br />
concern for the best interests of the nation.<br />
I am deeply gratified that this resolution will clearly be<br />
passed, and with an overwhelming majority.<br />
In concluding this debate, I want to repeat my thanks to the<br />
Leader of the Opposition, the Leader of the National Party,<br />
and the other members of the Opposition who have expressed<br />
their support for Australia's current involvement in the<br />
Gulf. It is vitally important, as we carry out our<br />
responsibilities in the Gulf, that we maintain the shared<br />
spirit of commitment to Australia's national interests that<br />
has characterised this debate.<br />
It is important because we need to send a coherent and<br />
strong message to the world.<br />
This message will fortify our serving personnel on board the<br />
-Bria√± J2na, the. -Syd= e and the -unesaz.<br />
This message will encourage our allies in the United Nations<br />
coalition, including those who have already in this war lost<br />
men and materiel. In the morning I will be meeting with the<br />
heads of mission of all countries who are taking action in<br />
support of the UN resolutions on the Gulf and conveying to<br />
them the strength of this Parliament's support for those<br />
resolutions. </p>
<p>This message will, with its specific condemnation of Iraq's<br />
unprovoked attack on Israel, tell the people of Israel of<br />
this Parliament's sympathy with them at this time of crisis,<br />
and of our respect for the restraint which they have<br />
displayed over recent days.<br />
This message will underline our concern that once this<br />
crisis is over there will be intensified efforts to<br />
establish peace and stability in the Middle East including<br />
a just resolution of the Palestinian issue and the<br />
continuing security of Israel.<br />
And it will underline very clearly and decisively the<br />
support of this Parliament for the resolute way this crisis<br />
has been handled by the United Nations, in defence of the<br />
principles of national sovereignty and collective security.<br />
Mr speaker,<br />
It is also important that we send a clear message to the<br />
people of Australia.<br />
Because as I said yesterday, it is important as we confront<br />
this crisis in Iraq that every Australian understand the<br />
facts of the situation.<br />
The message we will be sending to the people of Australia,<br />
with the passage of this resolution, will be a message that<br />
regardless of the widespread and innate distaste we all feel<br />
for war regardless of the hazards being undergone by our<br />
armed forces in the Gulf we see support for this<br />
resolution as thoroughly and intrinsically consistent with<br />
our highest duties as the elected representatives of the<br />
people of Australia.<br />
The allied nations did not want this war; we did not start<br />
this war. We tried hard to resolve the dispute by<br />
diplomacy. We have only with the greatest reluctance and<br />
deepest regret resorted to the military option.<br />
And the majority of Australians understand the magnitude of<br />
Iraq's challenge to the world community and the importance<br />
of our campaign to meet and overcome that challenge.<br />
Compassion and sorrow, including for the Iraqi people, are<br />
not the exclusive preserve of those who oppose the war but<br />
are shared by this Government and by all Australians.<br />
It would, of course, be much easier if we could simply sit<br />
this out on the grounds that war is terrible.<br />
But we Members of Parliament, least of all people, cannot<br />
abrogate our responsibilities and opt for the easy arguments<br />
with which some may feel more naturally comfortable. We owe<br />
it to ourselves and to our fellow citizens to examine with<br />
intellectual rigour this very complex situation. </p>
<p>Throughout the history of humankind, some have found it<br />
easier to go to war than others. And it has not always been<br />
true that those who found it easiest were necessarily the<br />
wisest. Let me say that I understand that those members who<br />
have said they cannot bring themselves to support this<br />
resolution have spoken from the heart. But this grave issue<br />
requires not just the heart but the head.<br />
As previous speakers have acknowledged, the stakes in this<br />
conflict are very high, not only for Kuwait but for all<br />
countries, great and small, who may depend on a system of<br />
collective security for national survival.<br />
If this system fails us now, at its first major test against<br />
aggression, the consequences for our security are disturbing<br />
indeed. I might mention here my disappointment at the comments of<br />
some opponents of Australia's stance who, while previously<br />
stressing the importance of United Nations mechanisms<br />
involving international disputes, have now abandoned that<br />
approach at the very time the UN is proving to be an<br />
effective body.<br />
Let me remind Honourable Members, as I did in my statement<br />
to this Parliament on 4 December, of Dr Evatt's prescient<br />
view about the obligations of nations in circumstances such<br />
as we face today. In 1945 he said:<br />
' It must: be made crystal clear that the nations seeking<br />
representation in the world's organisation must be<br />
prepared to contribute their share of physical force to<br />
restrain the action of proved aggressors.'<br />
It was crystal clear in 1945, and it remains so today. This<br />
country did riot question its truth then, nor should it now.<br />
Mr Speaker,<br />
Both the Leader of the opposition and the Leader of the<br />
National Party made mention of the Government's White Paper<br />
on Defence and questioned its adequacy as a framework for<br />
Australia's policy in the light of the current crisis and<br />
its global diLmensions.<br />
On the contrary, the White Paper explicitly recognised that<br />
we may need to deploy forces far from Australia's shores,<br />
and ensured that the Australian-. Defence Forces would be able<br />
to meet that threat.<br />
Paragraph 1.17 of the White Paper explicitly states, and I<br />
quote: ' Options will always be available to Australian<br />
governments fEor assistance to allies.... The type of<br />
Australian force structure required to protect our interests<br />
in our area of military interest entails substantial<br />
capabilities for operations further afield. For example,<br />
our guided miLssile frigates ( FFGs) equipped with Seahawk </p>
<p>helicopters are capable of effective participation in a US<br />
carrier battle group well distant from Australia's shores.'<br />
That is precisely what our ships are doing in the Gulf.<br />
The fact that we were able to respond swiftly and<br />
appropriately to this present crisis in itself demonstrates,<br />
I believe, that our defence framework is right and<br />
appropriate to Australia's needs.<br />
Mr Speaker,<br />
This Government firmly believes that we have taken the right<br />
decision on behalf of the Australian people.<br />
The news of each passing day confirms that belief. Most<br />
recently, we have been treated to the news that Saddam<br />
Hussein's abuses of international conventions have reached<br />
new depths with his threats to use allied prisoners of war<br />
in Iraq as human shields at strategic sites.<br />
It is difficult to find words which adequately express our<br />
outrage at this latest development. Iraq's treatment of<br />
prisoners of war is in blatant breach of the Geneva<br />
Convention and is against natural human decency.<br />
This parliamentary resolution is one way, an important way,<br />
in which we can demonstrate, as a nation, where we stand in<br />
this dispute with this dictator. It is a way of sending a<br />
signal to the world.<br />
Mr Speaker,<br />
I take this opportunity to pay tribute to those Australian<br />
men and women serving in our embassies in the region,<br />
especially those in Riyadh, Tel Aviv and Amman, and, until<br />
just before the fighting began, in Baghdad itself. In<br />
Riyadh and Tel Aviv, of course, our staff have been hearing<br />
the missiles fall.<br />
At considerable risk to their own safety, these staff have<br />
been working throughout the conflict to try to ensure the<br />
safety of fellow Australians who remain in the region. I am<br />
sure that all members of this Parliament join me in<br />
acknowledging their courage and professionalism.<br />
Mr Speaker,<br />
The 1990s began with the highest of hopes that peace would<br />
be given a chance; that former superpower rivalries and<br />
tensions would give way to a new world order of co-operation<br />
among nations, one in which ordinary men and women could get<br />
on with their lives and enjoy the fruits which a peaceful<br />
world can bring.<br />
Saddam Hussein's great crime is that he is destroying these<br />
hopes. If he is not stopped, the decade, the twentieth </p>
<p>century, will end in hopes darkened and aggression again<br />
triumphant. Young Australian defence personnel are in the Gulf to stop<br />
this happening. It is important that they know that this<br />
Parliament and the overwhelming majority of the Australian<br />
population are fully behind them.<br />
By supporting this resolution today, members of this<br />
Parliament will, on behalf of all Australians, demonstrate<br />
their understanding and support for the task these<br />
Australians are to perform. </p>
