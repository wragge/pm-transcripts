    <content><![CDATA[<p>All Australians will be saddened by the news that Tasmanian Premier Jim Bacon has been diagnosed with lung cancer and has consequently decided to retire from politics.</p>
<p> I telephoned Mr Bacon today and conveyed my good wishes to him and his wife Honey. We wish them both well as they fight hard together to recover Jim';s health.  Our thoughts will be with them and their family as they confront this challenge in the weeks ahead.</p>
