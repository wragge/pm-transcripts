PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P. J. KEATING MP<br />
SPEECH AT MORNING TEA, VICTORIA BARRACKS, MELBOURNE,<br />
4 JULY 1995<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
Thank you Kim ( Beazley), members of the Curtin family, very distinguished<br />
guests, members of the Cabinet and Ministry and ladies and gentlemen.<br />
It is a very fitting occasion, I think, for us to meet in this the 50th anniversary<br />
of the end of the War and the 50th. anniversary of John Curtin's death.<br />
Althoughi John Curtin's life was a life dedicated'to working-Australians in the<br />
Labor movement, in the trade unions, in the Labor Party and in the Federal<br />
Parliament, he found that his ministerial life, ' his Prime Ministerial life was<br />
dedicated, of course, to the prosecution of the war. On this 50th anniversary<br />
of the cessation of hostilities, of Victory in Europe and Victory in the Pacific<br />
for the democracies over the fascists in Europe, in Japan and in the Pacific,<br />
on this occasion, I think, it is important for all of us to remember those who<br />
prosecuted that war, directed it and fought it and those who died in the<br />
course of it and those who suffered and those who were left behind. Because<br />
to have such a conflagration as the Second World War was and to have this<br />
country under threat of occupation, to rest control of the region from an<br />
enemy at great personal sacrifice has to be remembered. It must mean<br />
something. It has to mean something and it has to keep on meaning<br />
something. We always, be it Anzac Day or other times, remember these times, but this<br />
anniversary has, perhdos, broken away from the stylised remembrance or<br />
commemoration of the people and the events to something far more heartfelt.<br />
It is because we know that we can identify in our lives with what half a<br />
century means. It is not so long ago to know that these events were taking<br />
place and, in a sense, coming here as we are today, we can somewhat<br />
recreate them. If only by the reminiscences of the people who were involved<br />
as we have heard from Jim ( Maher) this morning and the recollections of our<br />
great leader at the time, John Curtin, as we have heard from his grandson.<br />
I think that there is these constant linkages that the country seems to make<br />
and certainly the Labor Party makes. Ki m Beazley is my Deputy and Deputy<br />
Prime Minister. Of course, his father won the seat that John Curtin's death </p>
<p>caused the vacation and he came here very praisewprthy of John Curtin and<br />
kept that linkage going to pass it on to his son who has kept it going and, of<br />
course, being both natives of Perth they have had that linkage with the Curtin<br />
family over these years.<br />
We have all appreciated those contacts and those linkages so that the<br />
continuity is there. We feel that sense of continuity and it makes us stronger.<br />
Today, when the Cabinet meets in the War Room, in peace 50 years later, I<br />
think, there will be as there is already, a moving quality about it and we<br />
appreciate the peace and we appreciate what we have been given and we<br />
appreciate what Curtin and his Cabinet and his government and the people of<br />
this country were able to do in those desperate times with much less to do it<br />
with than we have today.<br />
So, I think, it is an occasion for reflection on that and also on John Curtin. I<br />
think it might have been John who said that not much is written of him and<br />
that is pretty true. But, again, in this sort of society, what is written doesn't<br />
necessarily matter. It is what is thought and what is felt. There is no doubt<br />
that the great affection for Curtin has remained right through the post-war<br />
generation and because they were the ones who taught it to us, that<br />
generation my parents generations taught it to us, and it has come to us.<br />
And, it may not be in the biographies or autobiographies or the histories, but<br />
it is there. Maybe someone will write more of it down and pick up some of<br />
Jim's Manuka reflections and the rest which are important to gauge the<br />
personality of John Curtin.<br />
I think the thing about him was he did feel for his fellow Australians. You can<br />
see by the references we have and the knowledge we have of him, how much<br />
of a burden the war was on him and how he felt responsible for the Australian<br />
forces which were deployed at his direction. He felt a singular responsibility<br />
for them. I think, that in such a desperate situation with a large continent with<br />
a very small population under an assault from an implacable and<br />
indefatigable enemy there is the singular loneliness of that leadership<br />
position which must have borne very heavily on him. We know that he was<br />
haunted by the knowledge of the suffering in battle and the deprivation and<br />
captivity of Australian forces.<br />
I think what we appreciate about him most was he was not only passionate,<br />
but pragmatic and resolute. Pragmatism came in the 1970s and 1980s to be<br />
a word which has been used in other respects in more derogatory terms, a<br />
derogatory reference, but pragmatism if one denotes from that learning the<br />
lessons of history and doing what is honourable and practical at the time,<br />
John Curtin made the opportunities, took the opportunities to do things in the<br />
best interest of Australia and he made new alliances the one with the United<br />
States is the most famous and he did things which he thought were<br />
calculated to best serve this country and the allied interests.<br />
So, he was practical ( inaudible) is all sweetness and light, it never was. He<br />
had many critics and he had critics when the stress on him was the greatest, </p>
<p>which was more the pity. But, he was resolute, he was decisive and that is<br />
what the country needed. It needed somebody who believed in Australia and<br />
Australians and who was resolute, decisive, inventive and pragmatic. They<br />
were all things that he was. That is, I think at its core why we appreciate him<br />
most. He was genuinely a leader and he took decisions and he stuck with<br />
them despite the criticism.<br />
For a generation of people he became the embodiment of what it is to be a<br />
good Australian. What it means to be a good Australian. If you say to<br />
anyone ' who do you think was a good Australian?' Many people would say<br />
John Curtin. They would think of him, perhaps, first because of the plainness<br />
of his life, the simplicity, yet the strength of purpose, the passion, the love of<br />
his country, his commitment to it, all of these things, I think, come to make<br />
him perhaps the idealised view of what a good Australian is and that has<br />
been a real guiding light for the rest of us, particularly the post-war<br />
generation, who had to try to take some lessons from the ruins of the Second<br />
World War.<br />
Today, let's remember his courage and his faith and his virtue and the fact<br />
that, I think, as most agree and even those most close to him agree, that the<br />
burden of the war probably led to his untimely death and the great pity was<br />
that we never saw his skills employed in peace time. That he never had the<br />
opportunity to do the things in peace that his life was really prepared for and<br />
that while we had the benefit of his leadership and his skills in war, we never<br />
had them when he would have most liked to employ them. That is, I think,<br />
sad but we were then, again, fortunate that the mantle was passed to another<br />
great leader in Ben Chifley who took up the job of post-war reconstruction.<br />
I hope that by holding this Cabinet meeting here today, will not only dually<br />
honour John Curtin, but rekindle the memory of his leadership and that of his<br />
government and the commitment of all those Australians to the war effort.<br />
Some things have been said here today, Jim mentioned the reference to no<br />
matter whether one was a messenger or Prime Minster, it was a national<br />
effort and, I think, the commitment by people and Mr and Mrs Salisbury<br />
amongst them here today who have served here, that sort of general<br />
commitment to people in the war effort was a national commitment by all<br />
Australians. He led that commitment and he died just as the war was<br />
finishing and where his successful prosecution had been complete.<br />
This is an opportunity to remember John Curtin, perhaps without the written<br />
histories, but to remember and appreciate him and say for those of us in the<br />
Labor family, in this government, that we are very proud to be here as the<br />
Labor government of Australia in the War Rooms where the Labor<br />
government of the 1940s won the peace for this country. To be here with the<br />
members of the family of John Curtin and with those who worked with him<br />
and were close to him. Thank you.<br />
