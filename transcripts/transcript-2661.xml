' THIS WEEK'<br />
TELEVISION INTERVIEW GIVEN BY THE PRIME MINISTER,<br />
THE RT. HON. WILLIAM : IcMAHON, CH, MP, ON<br />
HSV7, . ELBOURNE August 1972<br />
Interviewers: John Boland<br />
" ax Grant<br />
Q. Well, Prime " inister, it seems that the<br />
Government stock-: s were consid'erably restored after the<br />
Budget on Tuesday. But I am wondering whether some of<br />
this didn't fall awav when Sir Alan Hulme attacked the ABC<br />
and you, yourself, subsequently lent your support to that.<br />
This particular situation was likened by some journalists<br />
this week to the situation in wartime when Mr Calwell, the<br />
then Minister for Information, closed down certain papers<br />
in Sydney. Now, did you feel that this may have detracted<br />
from your efforts on the Budget, this particular conflict<br />
that you had during the week<br />
PM: Not a bit. Surely we are entitled to comment.<br />
What I did say was this. I wa:, asked a simple question:<br />
Do you believe that the ABC or the people of the ABC should<br />
be permitted to ask any question in any way they like?;<br />
And I said, " No, I don't. I believe they have to act<br />
responsibly. I believe they have to act upon the truth."<br />
But if I could take it a stage further, I don't believe,<br />
as it were, that they should consistently put one set of<br />
ideological principles and not put the other. But I<br />
also believe very, very strongly that the ABC, that is, the<br />
Commission, like the universities, must not be subject to<br />
interference by a government outside the law. If the law<br />
provides for something, then it is the responsibility of<br />
the Commission to observe it. Having said that, I have to<br />
make this one other comment. So far as I am concerned, this<br />
is a problem for the Postmaster-General who has had a lot<br />
of experience in these matters. He has not brought it to<br />
the Government, and I certainly don't intend to take it any<br />
further.<br />
Q. Do you think, though, that Sir Robert Madgwick was<br />
put in a terribly embarrassing situation when he had to<br />
repudiate the Postmaster-General over his statements on the<br />
Commissioners and the ABC? / 1 </p>
<p>2<br />
PM: I said I don't want to take this anyfurther because<br />
there were differences of opinion within the ABC, and as I have<br />
said, the Post '' ter-General has not brought this to a Government<br />
level, so I think it is appropriate that I should leave<br />
it at his level.<br />
Q. I would like to ask you this, though. Who really<br />
runs the ABC, Prime Minister?<br />
PM: Well, this is where there is some difficulty. We<br />
believe that Parliament must oass the law, and it devolves<br />
certain authorities on the ABC. It is then for the Commission<br />
of the ABC to decide what the devolution of authority shculd<br />
be, and this is where there is some problem, I believe, with<br />
the Postmaster-General. But, as I said, he is handling it,<br />
and until he decides if he does decide tat it is a matter<br />
of Government policy, then I can't go any further about it.<br />
I have some doubts as to whether he will bring it to the<br />
Government.<br />
Q. At the moment, is the ABC being vetted in any way<br />
except for their current affairs programme?<br />
PM: Not so far as I know. It may be done by the<br />
Postmaster-General, but if it is being done by him, he hasn't<br />
conveyed this information to me.<br />
Q. You have indicated in what you just said that you<br />
believe that the ABC is politically slanted.<br />
PM: I didn't say that at all.<br />
Q. Ygu did use those words but....<br />
PM: I stated certain qencral principles, and I said<br />
that I believed that in the act of Parliament under which it<br />
operates that it should be indenendent and free. But I also<br />
believe that it should observe certain canons. I can't go<br />
further into those because I have informed you of what my<br />
views are.<br />
Q. Prime Minister, I think very few peonle could argue<br />
about the Budget. It has been called a bonanza Budget and<br />
described in all sorts of other glowing terms. It must be<br />
very tempting to go to the nolls straight away.<br />
PM: Yes, it's tempting, but at the mment and I can<br />
give you an assurance of this as I have given it to other<br />
people U? to the moment, I have not made up my mind. In<br />
fact I have not considered on what date we should have an<br />
election. I did on Friday have the professionals in the<br />
Party meet me in Canberra, and they discussed the limit<br />
the earliest and the latest date we could go. Beyond that<br />
I haven't given it any further consideration.<br />
What is the latest date you could go? </p>
<p>-3<br />
PM: If you don't mind, I have gnt no intention at all<br />
of answering that-sort of a question.<br />
0. Well the earliest would probably be a month away.<br />
PM: About a month, yes. That is all the information<br />
I will give you at the moment.<br />
0. W. 7uld you considcr that, though? I mean, is that<br />
a live possibility?<br />
PM: It's not possible.<br />
Q. What about Octo~ ber 21?<br />
PM: I will go no further. I have given you all the<br />
clues I intend to give you, because as I said, I haven't<br />
given it deep? consideration, aind 1 am not the kind of person<br />
to answer a question without a considerable amount of thought<br />
beforehand.<br />
0. It would seem though, Prime Minister, that with<br />
the legislative ? rogramnc you have got in front of you to<br />
wind up this year, it would he fairly difficult to do this,<br />
and also you hava got the unemployment situation, to go<br />
to the peonla before late November. Would that be a reasonable<br />
sort of assessment?<br />
PM: These are matters that every porson would take<br />
into consideration when he is making up his mind what he<br />
should do. But there are many other considerations as well.<br />
And I can assure you of this, you will not be able to get a<br />
precise date, or an indicain of a nrecise date from me<br />
tonight.<br />
Q. Do you think that if President Nixon is successful,<br />
and it looks as though he will be, in re-election for<br />
President, that this would help the Government?<br />
PM: It would be some help, yes, but it wouldn't be<br />
decisive.<br />
0. Prime Minister, I wonder if I can, without trying<br />
at this print for a specific date, put it this way. Are<br />
there scme other things that you would like to do before<br />
you go to the polls?<br />
PMl: Yes, there are some other things. You menticoned<br />
first of all the legislative programme. The essential<br />
features of the Budget mnust be -asse d by the Parliament<br />
before we can go to an election. We also have the problem<br />
of administraticn of the election by the organisations of<br />
the Party, whether the Parties themselves are ready and<br />
on what date they will have the organistion in a fit state<br />
for an election. These are but two of the problems. There<br />
are others as well. As I said, you won't get any more out<br />
of me tonight, so I personally believe it would be far<br />
better if we moved on to something else </p>
<p>4<br />
PM:<br />
Q. PM:<br />
0. Unemployment, then, is a problem that you might<br />
like to rectify before you went to the nolls.<br />
I have said over and over again, and as I said on<br />
this programme the last time I was he-e that full employment<br />
is with us a cardinal princinle of policy. We have strenuously<br />
since September of last year taken measures to ensure that<br />
unem* loyment was kept as low as we could keep it, and if we<br />
find that the measures we are taking are not sufficiently<br />
strong enough, then we will take more. But we do believe<br />
the big area the area where there was a tendency to<br />
stop the growth of employment in the way we wanted-was<br />
consumption expenditure, We have made it a feature of this<br />
year's Budget to increase the capacity for demand, and through<br />
that method to be able to work its way back through the<br />
wholesale shops ito the factories, and through the fartories<br />
to increased employment. In other words, a moment ago, just<br />
before I came onto this orogramme, I listened to an economic<br />
reporter, and he said the Government has now put a lot of<br />
money into circulation. He was talking of a total deficit, I am now<br />
talking about an internal deficit we have turned a big<br />
interral surplus last year into a $ 60 million internal<br />
deficit this year, That is a vast amount of purchasing<br />
nower to put into circuiati If it gets into circulation<br />
quickly, then I have no doubt it will have an impact. So<br />
as the previous commentator said, it is up to you, it is<br />
up to the viewer, it is un to the people in the community.<br />
I believe this is an occasion when they can spend and they<br />
should spjend. I believe now that most of the doubts have<br />
been sweot away, and we want a happy economy and a happier<br />
people and not one that is worrying too much.<br />
You must be concerned, though, that the movement<br />
of unemployment hasn't really shifted very far from 100,000<br />
in recent months. Have you been disappointed that there<br />
wasn't a big decrease, particularly last month<br />
I have said, and in fact, if you look at the<br />
words of the Budget, I said that even though our or<br />
the Treasurer said that even though our unemployment is<br />
low by international standards and it is it is too<br />
high for us. And the views expressed there are my own.<br />
In fact the words " for us" were specifically introduced<br />
into the Budget by me.<br />
Now getting on to the Budget. The Budget provided<br />
million in long-term loans to farmers. Now is this the<br />
start of a $ 350 million rural develonment bank for farmers<br />
as the Deputy Prime Minister has indicated? </p>
<p>PM: There is too much made of this nroblem. It is<br />
correct to say that the objectives of the Liberal and the<br />
Country Parties are identical. They can be summed up in these<br />
words. We both believe that there should be better opportunities<br />
for long-term finance on a commercial basis for some sections<br />
of the rural industry. That is our objective. Where the<br />
problem arises is as to how achieve that objective. As<br />
for establishing a rural bank, my colleague, Tony Street, who<br />
is the Assistant to the Minister for Labour and National<br />
Service, some time last year presented a paper on behalf of<br />
the organisation the Liberal Party organisation<br />
recommending to the Government that we should have a national<br />
rural bank. I, in fact, promoted that idea many months before<br />
so that it is not new. The real difficulty that arises here<br />
is as to how you do it, and whether you will cause greater<br />
problems by the known methods than you will cure. At the<br />
moment, I think it is fair ko say that we do not know how<br />
we can overcome the problems associated with a separate<br />
rural bank. But we are looking at it, and what we did in<br />
this Budget was to provide $ 20 million for the Development<br />
Bank to permit it to go ahead with the provision of long-term<br />
finance for some of the rural industries.<br />
Q. So it is not on $ 350 million?<br />
PM: No, I don't think it is on, not in the immediate<br />
future. Certainly not.<br />
Q. Not when Mr Anthony has indicated that it is?<br />
PM: Well I don't think he indicated that it is<br />
immediately. In fact we gave this very careful consideration<br />
during the discussions on the Budget and we came down with<br />
a figure of $ 20 million to go to the Development Bank for<br />
this financial year.<br />
Q. Prime Minister, it was rather unsual for the<br />
Reserve Bank to come out quite as strongly as it did during<br />
the week and virtually say that perhans the Government should<br />
consider revaluing up to counter inflation. Is that a<br />
softening up for a Government move in that area?<br />
PM: I contest the words " so strongly". It is implicit<br />
in it, but it didn't express it directly that it came out<br />
strongly in favour of upward revaluation. What I can say to<br />
you is that when we looked at revaluation on the last occasion,<br />
I personally took the initial view that we should revalue<br />
upward against the US dollar by 6.32 per cent. And I did that<br />
for various reasons, and I can explain to you if you want them,<br />
and I will explain some of them to you because I think it is<br />
critically important that we understand this problem. We<br />
haven't to think only of pure monetary theory. On that we<br />
would have gone up to 8.57 per cent. We also had to consider<br />
our rural industries and the way they would have to compete<br />
against others who devalued. We had to consider the mining<br />
industries they lost about $ 8 million for every one per cent<br />
of upward revaluation. And above all, we had to think of<br />
confidence. I am sure that if we had gone further than 6.32<br />
per cent, confidence would not have been restored and we would,<br />
I believe, have increased the prospects of greater unemployment.<br />
So as a Prime Minister, I took a view right at the beginning of<br />
/ 6 </p>
<p>-6<br />
( PM continued)<br />
where we should go, and I finished up on that point, and that<br />
is where we stand.<br />
0. But now?<br />
PM: Well, now, while I haven't been in daily contact<br />
or even in regular contact with the Governor of the Resoerve<br />
Bank, at least I know that on that occasion, he thought our<br />
action was reasonable.<br />
Q. Prime Minister, there are a couple of things that<br />
I would like to get through just before our time is up, and<br />
one is overseas investment and takeovers of good Australian<br />
com anies by overseas firms. Now are we likely in this session<br />
to see Federal l~ egislation to prevent this going on<br />
selling off more of the farm, in other words?<br />
PM: I don't like these takeovers, particularly of the<br />
type associated with Kiwi. I don't like them at all and<br />
while I believe in free flow of exchanges under, well, normal<br />
circumstances, I believe that the sooner we can get Papers<br />
from the Treasury based upon the in-depth survey they made<br />
of the effects of capital inflow private capital inflows<br />
into the economy thie l~ etter it will be. They are preparing<br />
about five different neers and I do not know at the moment<br />
how far they have gone ir cnmpleting them.<br />
Q. Would you like to have le';-islation before this<br />
Session closes?<br />
PM: Yes, I would.<br />
Q. So you aim at doing it?<br />
PM: It depends how much we have got and when we have<br />
the election which you pressed me so hard about at the<br />
beginning. I want it as soon as I can get it, but it is a<br />
mammoth task and there is a tremendous amount to be done,<br />
particularly associating with those measures in the Budget<br />
that will relieve poverty and will give incentive to people<br />
in the middle and lower income brackets and that will also,<br />
I believe, establish very solid! foundations f-r future<br />
growth somewhere about 5 or 5h per cent.<br />
Q. Prime Minister, national superanruetion. Peo~ ple<br />
are still exnecting some move in the Government area in that.<br />
What is the latest an that? </p>
<p>7<br />
PM: That was explained in the Budget, too, and is a<br />
matter in which I have taken a very deep and personal<br />
attention. We did say in the Budget that we would abolish<br />
the means test within three years and I took a very decisive<br />
part in seeing that that went into the Budget. But I have<br />
also had to look very carefully at a national superannuation<br />
scheme or some other means of ensuring that we would be able<br />
to finance sensibly finance the measures that we have<br />
adopted. I have given this matter at least eighteen months<br />
consistent attention, but I have not felt satisfied that<br />
wo were getting the right answers, so I had no other<br />
alternative but to say that we would appoint an individual<br />
or a committee to examine this problem of a national<br />
superannuation scheme. Already I have got several people's<br />
names in mind and I believe that it won't be long before we<br />
will be able to get quidelines for the individual or the<br />
commission. I hope to be able to announce this quite soon.<br />
Q. What form will the poverty enquiry take, and when<br />
will it get under way?<br />
PM: We have already drawn un the terms of reference<br />
for the pcverty enql ry and we have one or two or possibly<br />
three names under consideration. We considered this last<br />
week in Cabinet, we will consider it again on Tuesdl, and<br />
I believe on Tuesday we ought to be able<br />
Q. Release the details?<br />
PM: Well, no, the details have been finished. It is<br />
the names we have to decide upon.<br />
Q. Very quickly, Prime Minister, following the meeting<br />
of State Secretaries and Federal President with yourself at<br />
the end of last week, what will you campaign on? There was<br />
talk about selling the nolicies between now and the election.<br />
Apart from the Budget, what else?<br />
PM: First of all, as you have said, we have got to sell<br />
our nolicies, and I hope that is what I was coming here to<br />
do today because there is so much in this Budget that is so<br />
good, we must let the Dcople know what is contained in it<br />
as politicians. But apart altogether from that, when the<br />
professionals and that is the professional officers of<br />
the organisations in the six States and in Canberra when they<br />
met, they prepared some papers for us. They admitted they<br />
had not given the papers to us until Friday morning at ten<br />
o'clock and they couldn't possibly expect us to give any<br />
decisions on them by the time we rose at one o'clock lunch<br />
time. So we will have to consider it again next Friday<br />
and then the professionals and I and the other two Ministers<br />
will be meeting again next week.<br />
Q. If you win the next election, would you consider<br />
bringing John Gorton back in to the Ministry in the light<br />
of recent Galluo Polls? ./ 8 </p>
<p>8-<br />
PM: I have never ever spoken about John Gorton one<br />
way or the other since he left the Government. I have<br />
no intenion of doing it.<br />
Q. Could you give some indication if that may be<br />
a consideration?<br />
P. M: No, I would g~ ive none. q3ut I would not say<br />
that he is ruled out.<br />
Q. In terms of time to sell the policies, that<br />
would tend to suggest November?<br />
PM: You are a very persistent nerson, but you will<br />
not get an answer about it from me.<br />
Q. Well you haven't ruled John Gorton out, so that<br />
is one interesting thing, Prime Minister. The other is that<br />
it is being said that this year's Budget is a politially<br />
designed Budget for the uncommitted voter. Now is that a<br />
fair assessment?<br />
PM: It is one of the ingredients, yes, but there are<br />
many better ones, because I know what was in my mind and<br />
what was in the mind of the Cabinet when we designed<br />
the Budget.<br />
Q. To win the election<br />
PM: Well, no, the first one was that we realised there<br />
were some nTe ople who had a fear of old age and that had to<br />
be removed and it has been removed. We knew there were areas<br />
of need that had to be covered, and I believe most of them<br />
have been covered. There was the area of poverty I referred<br />
to the Henderson Inquiry. And I believe in most of the areas<br />
we have looked at, we have covered this question of poverty<br />
and we have done it effectively. We have had the problem of<br />
nursing homes and home nursing attention. I am sorry that<br />
this hasn't been em; phasised and the benefits not known because<br />
I believe it would be a help to a great number of people.<br />
That was our number one concern.<br />
Q. But it is also an election-winning Budget, you feel?<br />
PM: Yes, it is an election-winning Budget, too.<br />
They are both important. And the third one was that we had<br />
to have sound economic and administrative reasons for the<br />
change. And that is why we have a deficit a total deficit<br />
of $ 630 million, and an internal deficit of $ 60 million.<br />
This is sound economic manae., ement and will be the basis<br />
of our success.<br />
Q. Prime Minister, one final question. You mentioned<br />
yourself when you were hero some months ago in March, you<br />
talked about unemployment and you wanted to get it down<br />
then. But it's not down, it is still up around 100,000.<br />
Would you be happy to go to the polls with unemployment<br />
at that level? / 9 </p>
<p>9<br />
PM: I dc-In't think it will be cuite at that level.<br />
We have done so much that we should have achieved the<br />
response that we expecte, by now. iut our expectations<br />
have not been achieved. I believe this Budget, with a<br />
deficit as I have said, of overall $ 630 million, internally<br />
millicn should do the trick. But as I have said again,<br />
our attitudes to Budgeting are not the hard and fast rules<br />
of other days. We believe in flexibility, and while I don't<br />
think it will. be necessary, it would take a little time before<br />
we could make certain of this. But if we felt it was<br />
necessary, of course we would act, as we have done, because<br />
ever since the days when Sir Robert inherited government,<br />
we have always been willing to take action whenever we have<br />
thought it was necessary and we have never thought it was<br />
a cast iron rule that you had to wait until the actual<br />
day of the next Budget itself.<br />
Q. So you think that this is an election-winning<br />
Budget?<br />
PM: Yes I do.<br />
Q. Prime Minister, if I thought it was going to be a<br />
case of third man lucky, I, too, would ask you when the<br />
Federal election was going to take place, but I don't think<br />
that theory is gning to work.<br />
PM: I can assure you it won't work!<br />
Thank you, indeed, for joining us. </p>
