SPEECH BY THE PRI4 MINISTER, TEE RT. HON. R. G. MENZIES H<br />
AT ST. MARK'S LIBRARY, CANBERRA, ON. 27TH AUGUST, 1959C.<br />
My Lord Bishop and Ladies and Gentlemen:<br />
I like that little touch of my friend Sutcliffe's about<br />
another Prime Minister. ( Laughter.) There is a certain delightful<br />
ambiguity about it; but if he is, In fact, intending to give me a<br />
guarantee, as a very important civil servant, that I will still be<br />
in office next year, I would be delighted to have it. But each<br />
time I open the paper and I read about the latest uproar that has<br />
been created by something my Government has done, I begin to have<br />
my doubts. ( Laughter.)<br />
Sir, I thought that instead of talking about some<br />
particular current problems of international affairs, it might be<br />
a good idea to say a little about some perhaps less obviou. s aspects<br />
of what goes on in the world. We are very much inclined, aron't we,<br />
to classify the world; to talk about the democracies in a sorlb-of<br />
comprehensive expression without, perhaps, working out very closely'<br />
what we mean by such an expression.<br />
Back in 1919, somebody coined a great phrase in fact,<br />
it was before that about making the -ntrld safe for democracyone<br />
of those great rotund phrases that atbr-wct the mind superficially.<br />
But I think we ought to do a littlt! thinking about what<br />
it means and what we mean by " democracy", and In the course of my<br />
little talk to you, I will suggest that We havo not beenwvery cle;' r<br />
in our minds about this matter, and that a good deal 01 wiL<br />
meaning stuff goes on in the world under the name of demcracy<br />
whi-ch is not very usofil, and my even be rather dangerous.<br />
Since that phrase was coined? what has heppened to the<br />
world? There was a comfortable feeling in those days that the<br />
world was steadily advancing to what we understand by democracy<br />
parliamentary democracy. People pointed to a species of parliament<br />
in Russia; they pointed to the Reichstag in Berlin; they pointedsometimes<br />
a little hesitatingly at the Chamber of Deputies in<br />
Paris. And there was a general feeling that the whole thing was<br />
going on and that in due course everybody would be in line with us<br />
and adopting our kind of parliamentary self-government.<br />
Well, the fact is that since this phrase was stated,<br />
hundreds of millions of people in the world have passed even out of<br />
the expectation of any form of democracy, or the immediate<br />
expectation of any form of democracy, because the rule of<br />
dictators a rule that has considerable attraction for many<br />
millions of people had extended itself since then over hundreds<br />
and hundreds of millions of people. And I think that under those<br />
circumstances we ought to give a little thought to the problem of<br />
the spread of democracy. A greater area and a greater population<br />
are under dictatorship today than anybody dreamt of 30 or 40 years<br />
ago, Of course, there are reasons for that. They are reasons that<br />
I have had occasion to think about in the past.<br />
Parliamentary democracy began with us not with Australia<br />
but with the people of our race, the people of Great Britain. it<br />
was not exotic; it was a slow, steady growth from the soil<br />
local government, larger areas of government, then a parliament<br />
on an entirely undemocratic basis, then a series of reform acts which<br />
made the parliament established on a democratic basis. All these<br />
things occurred not hastily overnight but slowly over a course of<br />
centuries, and in the present century the extens'ion of the<br />
privilege of democracy the privilege of the vote to women; . so<br />
that you have a complete suffrage. </p>
<p>00 0 </p>
<p>I think, myself and I have always thought so in nmy own<br />
life, that in Great Britain they do understand the working of this<br />
machine this system perhaps better than any other people in the<br />
world. And they ought to, because over the course of centuries,<br />
and perhaps unconsciously in the early stages, tihey invented it,<br />
and it grew up and they grew up to be part of it. We in Australia<br />
have inherited it. If am rather disposed to think that in terms of<br />
true democracy, we have no superior in the world in terms of<br />
democracy. I rather think we are probably the most democratic<br />
country in the world.<br />
In the case of Germany, in the case of Russia, people<br />
had a little more disposition to take orders; a little more<br />
disposition to like governments with a touch of authority; and<br />
the result was that the parliamentary institutions which were adoptEL.<br />
in those countries did not have their roots in the ground, and they<br />
blew away in the first high wind. That is not so with us. We<br />
-were born and bred in a particular outlook on government and on the<br />
rights of the people and on the function of parliament and on the<br />
function of an executive; whereas in countries such as thoseI<br />
have mentioned with a what I might describe crudely as a sort of an<br />
instinct for being ordered around, parliamentary government was<br />
overthrown and overthrown quite readily. It did not have its<br />
roots in the soil as in our case. Now, in the case of some of<br />
these countries these things may well change as time goes on.<br />
But the point that I am making to you is that when we speak about<br />
our democracy our systen of parliamentary self-government we<br />
are talking about something that we ought to understand; something<br />
that is deep in the line of tradition in our country, and that<br />
therefore it won't be easily overthrown.<br />
A man who arrived in Australia and by reason of some<br />
temporary trouble or some disorder, set himself up to be the master<br />
of this country to be the dictator of this country would, in<br />
fact, be greeted with howls of derision; not with black rage but<br />
with contemptuous laughter, because we don't look at things in<br />
that way, and we never will. But that rule does not apply everywher-<br />
Therefore, we had better look at our own democracy and ask<br />
ourselves one or two questions. The first of them is: Are we<br />
making, as far as we can, democracy, as we understand it, a good<br />
thing? Are we making democracy safe for the world, to reverse the<br />
old tag? Well, I think there are many admirable things about our<br />
democracy. As I say we are, I think, at least as highly advanced<br />
in that field as anybody else in the world. But we still have some<br />
very quaint manifestations of things which are the enmy of true<br />
self-government. We have a tremendous amount of complete<br />
selfishness in our approach to public affairs. I know from long<br />
experience that nobody who~ was affected by any government action<br />
ever came along and said " I'm against this because I'm going to be<br />
worse off" perish the thought! He always explains to you that<br />
his attitude is one of complete disinterest; he is thinking only<br />
of the good of the country. Well, whether it is cynicism on my<br />
part or not, I think that in the majority of cases, the first<br />
reaction in the minds of many people is a selfish reaction. And<br />
until we get to a state of affairs in which a man may genuinely<br />
ignore the small damage to himself,' because he sees the large<br />
advantage to the country, to the nation; until we have reached<br />
that pointi we won't be able to look the world in the ~ re and say<br />
that our system of government is the very one for them, and that<br />
they are complete fools not to adopt it.<br />
The theory, I suppose, of parliamentary democracy is<br />
that you are elected to parliament by a sufficient number of<br />
generously minded, or misguided, electors. You are elected for<br />
an almost intolerably short term of three years. What are you<br />
elected for? Just to reflect particular interests? To bow in<br />
the wind of current opinion? To yield to pressure groups, more and<br />
more organised every year? Is that you function? Because, quite </p>
<p>frankly, if that is the function of a member of parliament, any<br />
third-rater will do, because you don't need to be extraordinarily<br />
able or have high character or strength of mind to bow as some<br />
passing event may invite you to bow.<br />
A member of parliament has a very great duty to his<br />
people, and one of those duties, of course as has been said by<br />
better rmen than me before today is to bring to the service of<br />
the country their own judgment and industry and character, not<br />
distorted by anybody else's opinion at all, with the sure knowledge,<br />
of course, that if what they do, if what they say they stand for,<br />
if what their judgment requires them to decide at some particular<br />
point does not commend themselves to the electors they will be out.<br />
From ihe point of view of democracy it is much better for a man<br />
to be out by exercising his own mind and character than to be in<br />
by abandoning then. Pressure groups all this tremendous<br />
organisation that goes on to have special interests put forward,<br />
no doubt it is inevitable, but we must beware of letting it set<br />
itself up as a substitute for the true duties of parliament and<br />
the people who sit there.<br />
Then of course, we have other disabilities. We might ap<br />
well be frank about them. We have a great deal of intolerance,<br />
and I don't suppose that any country will ever, in the true sense,<br />
become the perfect democracy until it has achieved an attitude of<br />
perfect tolerance, because if democracy means anything it :. eans<br />
that the other man's significance in the cormmunity must always be<br />
recognised; the other man's views in the commnunity must a'lways be<br />
recognised. And intolerance of minorities, or intolerrtnee of<br />
people who appear to us or to some of us to be a little odd in<br />
views, is not democratic; it is something that we must always<br />
watch. And then, of course and I think it more every year<br />
our democracy is always being challenged by sheer sensationalism,<br />
You have only to open your newspaper any day and you find some<br />
sensational treatment of something not calculated to improve the<br />
judgment of the reader, but to distort it; to make him feel that<br />
that particular thing on which his c-,-. otions are being wound up,<br />
is really the overwhelmingly significant thing of the day. Let us<br />
see all these things in proportion.<br />
Well, those are what you might call a few of the<br />
orthodox moral homilies, but they are not irrelevant to the<br />
consideration of democracy, because I say that in spite of<br />
whatever defects there may be, I am proud to say that I * believe<br />
Australia is as near to the ideal of parliamentary democracy as<br />
any country in the world.<br />
Now Sir, having said that, let mae just refer to the same<br />
problem in the international sense. There is a common error<br />
made in my opinion, it has been made in most countries and by<br />
many people since the last war and that cormm-on error is the erro.,<br />
of assuming that a system of goverment that is good for us is<br />
good for other people, automatically. To take one example,<br />
Australia has trust responsibilities to the north, in what I will<br />
call, compendiously, New Guinea5 a large native population<br />
inevitably, since we have not been there for very Long, a<br />
primitive community, with its own infinite variety of languages<br />
I am told there are literally hundreds of languages, not dialects,<br />
but hundreds of languages. And with a native population an<br />
indigenous population which varies from those who achieved<br />
education as we understand that term, to those in the remote parts<br />
of the island who are still living in a state of primitive savagery,<br />
so that anybody from the outside who goes in, goes in at his own<br />
risk. </p>
<p>There you have the most complex structure a complex<br />
of languages, a complex of cultures, ranging from European culture<br />
to the most primitive up in the mountain fastnesses. And yet, at<br />
any meeting of the Trusteeship Council there will be heard some<br />
well-meaning person who wants to establ~ ish a time-table and say<br />
that within 1x" 1 years self-government parliamentary selfgovernment<br />
is to be established in the territory. And that has<br />
agreat appeal to people. They sayt They are God's creatures;<br />
they are human beings. Why shouldn ttthey have the right to rule<br />
themselves?" And yet, if we walked out tomorrow, leaving them<br />
with what we are pleased to call parliamentary self-government, the<br />
result would be disaster in that area, and everybody knows it.<br />
But, of course, the second fallacy in the minds of these<br />
rather occasional and earnest people who want to put everything<br />
into a time-table, as if all countries were the same, is that<br />
stohmaet wohfa tt heims rgeoaold lyf orb eulsi evmeu stt habet aglolo d cofourn trsioemse boardey etlhse e. s amelIis<br />
a very comfortable assumption that because parliamentary selfgovernment<br />
is good for us, and we understand and we know how to<br />
make it work, and occasionally we get a bit of value out of it<br />
and occasionally we get a bit of fun out of it because of all<br />
this which suits our temperament completely, a lot of people are<br />
willing to say that it must be good for Indonesia, or it must be<br />
good for New Guinea, or it is a splendid system for some other<br />
country. How do we know that it is? Why do we assume that a syst; Aof<br />
government which is not only a matter of our choice in our own<br />
time but is a matter of inheritance; a matter that hazs been bred<br />
into us a matter about which we have instincts. why should we<br />
assume ihat a system of that kind can be imposed or conferred in<br />
one blow on countries that have no such tradition, no such<br />
experience, no such instincts? It is quite unreal, and I think<br />
that we ought to beware of it.<br />
You won't fail to notice that thore are two or three cases<br />
in very recent history in which what we are pleased to call<br />
the boon of parliamentary self-government has been conferred on<br />
some large number of people to whom almost the first thing that has<br />
happened has been the attempt to run a parliament fails; the<br />
parliament is dissolved; then somebody comes along and says, " I<br />
will take executive charge of the government and I will, of course,<br />
take suitable steps to have a constitution drafted and then I<br />
might have a constituent assembly to get it dealt with." And so<br />
the first fruit of the creation ofT self-governmient is a species of<br />
dictatorship; and we have seen it. Make no mistake, it exists in<br />
two or three countries in essential particulars. It is only a<br />
phase, I know, and it will be succeeded by some broader system of<br />
administration; but whether that will be what we call the ordinary<br />
parliamentary system as we understand it, I don't knou. I think<br />
what we have to face up to is that we have a pretty full-time job<br />
making our own system of parliamentary self-government serve the<br />
purposes of the comm~ unity to the highest possible extent without<br />
worrying too much about encumbering our neighbours with advice<br />
or instructions as to what kind of system of government they are<br />
to have. Because the truth is though you won't be here to<br />
confute me and I certainly wontt be here to be confuted that<br />
in a hundred years' time there will probably be as many clearly<br />
different systems of government in the world as there are nations<br />
in the world; each will thrash its own out.<br />
Therefore, we must be careful about making this assumptionnot<br />
uncommon, I regret to say, in the western world that the<br />
system that is good for us must be good for other people, and<br />
therefore all you have to do when the time comes, or not<br />
infrequently before the time comes, is to say, " Here we are, now<br />
set up a parliament; give everybody the vote, and all things will<br />
be added to." Well, it is just not true, vie may be very proud of<br />
our system and indeed we are but we are not to be assuming<br />
that it is going to be equally good for everybody else. </p>
<p>In the nineteenth century they understood a few of these<br />
things very well. I know it is the fasion nowadays to say that<br />
they were a lot of rather stuffy people, but it was a very great<br />
Foreign Minister of England who, in the nineteenth century, laid<br />
it down as axiomatic that one of the first things about foreign<br />
policy was not to interfere with the internal affairs of other<br />
countries; concern yourself with your relations with them, to<br />
help thei, as indeed we are very proud to help in many places; to<br />
give then on their request, such advice or experience as we may<br />
have; but never to be butting in in our homely phrase on how<br />
they conduct their internal affairs. And that is a pretty good<br />
rule. Occasionally, exceptions may have to be made to it.<br />
Occasionally, as in the recent events in Laos, you may have to watch<br />
very carefully the rest of the world may have to watch very<br />
carefully to see that what begins by looking like an internal<br />
matter, does not achieve an international quality and invoke<br />
international action. But that, of course, truly considardl im,<br />
not an exception but a mere illustration of the rfl.<br />
May I, Sir, before I finish, Just make one little gloss on<br />
what I have been saying to you. People, public pooplc particularly,<br />
and men particularly, like to make speeches ftrdinner. It is<br />
a very suitable occasion o'n whieh toc maiit a speech, because everybody<br />
is well fed and in a cheerful mood and the lightest witticism<br />
evokes roars of laughter. And in that delightful atmosphere,<br />
people are in the habit of getting rid of all the problems of the<br />
world with a sweep of the hand, making powerful speeches about<br />
Anglo-American relations, or something of that kind. It . j,, oes<br />
down very well; everybody is for it, in the broad; and then<br />
everybody goes home and says " That was a wonderful night; a most<br />
powerful speech." And yet, you know with great respect to my<br />
fellow after-dinner speakers a good deal of it is wasted; a<br />
good deal of it was rather uselessly said, and for this reason<br />
I'll take the same illustration: The great democracy of Great<br />
Britain and the great democracy of the United States. People will<br />
speak about these two democraces as if they were the same kind of<br />
thing. They are not; as if they had the same system of government.<br />
They have not; as if the approach of their leaders to the formulation<br />
of policy was conducted in exactly the same way on both sides<br />
of the Atlantic. It is not. The most important thing in the world<br />
to discover, if you are going to avoid bickering, which occasionally*<br />
happens between Britain and the United States, is to understand the<br />
large differences of government that exist not just ignore the<br />
differences and concentrate on the fact Lhe undoubted fact that<br />
there is a parliament whatever you call it, whether it is called<br />
Congress or Parliament and that everybody has a vote, as if<br />
those two things, in this simple manner that I was describing to<br />
you earlier, represented the whole definition of democracy, and<br />
therefore we have the same system.<br />
I have had a great deal to do with the United States<br />
administration in my time, and the leading men there, and a great<br />
deal of occasion for studying their system of government; and I<br />
am constantly struck by the remarkable differences between their<br />
system and ours. And if one establishes those differences, then<br />
which one is it that we are wishing on to our neighbour. You see,<br />
we come up against an awkward problem on the threshold.<br />
In our country, in Great Britain, ministers work out their<br />
policy in the Cabinet room and finally a policy emerges; it is<br />
announced. And that is the policy of the government. The<br />
government may be thrown out by a parliament that does not like it,<br />
but until it is, it is the policy of the govrnment.,,-_ and-anybody<br />
around the world can read it and say,, " well2 there you are, the<br />
policy of the British GoVprnrnont, chte Australian Government is<br />
so-and-so." The whr'lo thrashing out of this thing occurs behind<br />
closed doors, and after a lot of close study very frequently of a<br />
lot of documents and consideration of conflicting arguments. </p>

<p>But in the United States of America, they are accustomed<br />
to public evolving of policy. So that it gets thrashed out by<br />
public discussions in committees, by somebody making a statement<br />
to the press and somebody else disagreeing with it. All this is in<br />
the process of formation.<br />
I remember having one of many very fascinating talks with<br />
the late John Foster Dulles who was a man of great character<br />
indeed, but was regarded here for a long time, and in Great<br />
Britain, as a man who had no policy except one that changed from<br />
day to day. Well, the reason for that was that he gave me this<br />
by way of illustration: He came back from a very important<br />
conference in Europe. He prepared a report to the President on his<br />
way back. He despatcheC, i lo the White House when aL-.' rved at<br />
his house that evening, and foÃ± iC. rr t-1 4c -able a sir-.': ons to<br />
attend a meeting of the Foreign Affairs Committee nztex rmernin'-Pt<br />
o'clock and he felt that he had to go. I wouldn't have, I fepr<br />
Laughter. But, so deep-rooted in the American mind is this<br />
question of congressional committees that here he was, the most<br />
pressed, the busjo:-t man, with all his responsibilities, with<br />
no opportunity of talk with the President at all, going before<br />
a committee with all the glare of lights and television, o doubtand<br />
the press, and was cross-examined from 10 o'clock ir. the<br />
morning until 6 o'clock in the afternoon on how his mind To<br />
on this thing. And the result is that he is put in a pos. ion, y<br />
see, of threshing out, coram publico, what the policy miag-i t-rn<br />
out to be, saying, " Well, of course, on the one hard I th-'<br />
that is a consideration" and then, of course, scmebody n'-y twrite<br />
down the bit that suits him and off it goes ard tie ex';<br />
fellow writes down what he thinks.<br />
( TAPE CHANGED AT THIS STAGE)<br />
A minister in our country Iknows every noise hr. t.<br />
parliament makes. He is familiar with the procedures of the<br />
parliament. He is in constant contact with the members of<br />
parliament and in particular with members of his own party that<br />
support him. And the result is that he is very seldom taken by<br />
surprise by something that emerges. 3ut in the United Sta.'; es thn.<br />
is not the position. Ministers don't sit in conc-e.. s; of<br />
them, in fact, have never been there I mean el; er ) cen r: iember3<br />
of the Congress. The result is they have to deal wit-t.'-Lr<br />
legislation and all that kind of thing by what we c. " s<br />
remote control. That suits the United States of America. It has<br />
one great advantage, of course, from the point of view o'<br />
President: he may pick the best man at that subject<br />
it may be in the country; put his hand on him and say, '. o1<br />
come along and administer Commerce or administer Agriculture or<br />
administer Defence" or whatever it may be. And that, no doubt, i<br />
an advantage. But against that we have always seen tho<br />
disadvantage of having an executive which is detached f. r" n<br />
parliament, detached from the legislature; and to th't extent<br />
not susceptible to the daily collection of impressions ar1, te ci.:<br />
making and answering of criticisms.<br />
All right, I like our system; the United St.-. es : ikes<br />
its system. But you have only to look at those two illustrations<br />
to see that people who assume that we both have the same system<br />
of government are doing a disservice to our good relations, because<br />
when you are discussing or thinking about your relations with<br />
your friends, it is a good thing to have a clear understanding of<br />
what differences there are in your methods, so that you may not be<br />
led into a dispute about something which turns out to be based on<br />
pure misapprehension of the machinery or procedures adopted by the<br />
other man or the other country.<br />
Well, Sir, that is a very rambling discourse. It lacks<br />
the compactness of one of your sermons, Sir, ( laughter) but I hope<br />
that, like your sermons, it may give us something to think about. </p>
<p>7.<br />
CHAIRMAN: Ladies and Gentlemen, you have now got an unrivalled<br />
opportunity. You may ask questions of the Prime Minister. Do<br />
take advantage of your opportunity.<br />
UESTION: Mr. Chairman, when Mr. Menzies was talking about<br />
democracy in the first part of his speech he mentioned that one<br />
of the most important characteristics of the member of the House<br />
or the Senate or any other parliament, should be that he exercise<br />
his own judgment, his own decision; in fact, he should be rather<br />
like the idea in Burke's letter to the electorate of Bristol.<br />
Coming from the U. K. about two years ago, I find that in<br />
Australia, the awful thing the Liberals invented in Birmingham<br />
in 1870 or thereabouts, the caucus, is very much stronger out<br />
here, and for that reason I wonder whether Australian democracy<br />
is not, to some extent, tempered by the influence of caucus<br />
and is not, therefore, altogether a true reflection of the<br />
individual member's personal opinions, or the opinions if we<br />
must be on a mandatory basis of the electors who put him up<br />
for the post?<br />
MR. MENZIES: Well, Sir, I hope I did not convey the impression<br />
that I believe that all parties ought to be abolished or that we<br />
will ever have a parliament that consists of 124 independents,<br />
because, quite frankly, I think that would be terrible.<br />
Parliament would simply cease to work, in my opinion, under those<br />
conditions, and I would hate to be the independent Prime Minister<br />
who presided over 21 independent ministers. I would not want<br />
that post. But what I had in mind, of course, was that Donceiing<br />
the importance of party alignment we all have them, in ill<br />
aspects of life. We like to be with our friends who have the<br />
same common approach to a problem as we have. And therefore<br />
nothing that I say runs counter to that. But I do say tIt. t a<br />
member of parliament wno pÃ± ants hirnself to ti pucle as<br />
possessing a body of views of that kind, to which he will be<br />
faithful and in which he believes, is not to allow himself to<br />
be diverted from his proper course in carrying out those ideas by<br />
some temporary schmozzle, by some temporary complaint, or a<br />
little whipped-up popular temporary :--ovement or agitation, unless<br />
he agrees with it. That is the point at which he mrust sy, " I am<br />
here to exercise my judjient and not merely to take orde. rs whlich<br />
lie outside the scope of what I have atiitted to the electors<br />
and on which they have elected me,<br />
I think you are quite right: That the caucus idea has<br />
developed a great deal. It is, I think, pretty rigid in the<br />
Labor Party; it is somewhat looser in my own, because some more<br />
liberty I think, is permitted. I am sure it is permitted, except<br />
on vital matters which affect the life of the government; in which<br />
case, of course, any member of my party is free to vote against<br />
the government, so long as he knows he is voting to put it out.<br />
And that, I think, has a somewhat stimulating effect. ( Laugh"'; e.)<br />
But I must say to my friend at the back that though I<br />
concede these points about Australia, I thought I had perceived<br />
them in equal degree in Great Britain. I think that if a party<br />
in Great Britain held the Treasury Benches as one did not so<br />
long ago by 7 or 8 votes, you would find that tiiat caucus<br />
instinct would be very, very powerful, even if it represented onl,<br />
the instinct of self-preservation. ( Laughter.)<br />
QUESTION': Do you think that the establishment inr some of the<br />
countries of the new British Commonwealth of semi--dictatorial<br />
governments is likely, in the long run, to upset the unity of the<br />
Commonwealth and take those countries out of it? </p>
<p>MR. MENZIES: It is very difficult to answer a question like that<br />
dogmatically. If I thought that the establishment of semidictatorial<br />
governments here or here would contin'r until the<br />
whole thing became a straight-out dictatorship, nou a preliminary<br />
stage to getting a parliament or a constit4iion, but an established<br />
thing, then I would think that it was almost impossible to<br />
contemplate how such a government could fit into the conception<br />
of the British Commonwealth. Because, although we have watcred<br />
down or altered a number of the old elements which were once<br />
thought to be of prime importance, I think the fact still remains<br />
that we do set out to be an association of free and selfgoverning<br />
communities, and an inveterate dictatorship . ould<br />
I think, lead me if I were one of the people to d is to<br />
doubt very much whether such a country ought to reman in the<br />
Commonwealth. But, of course, I am bound to say to you. that I know one<br />
or two of the pseudo-dictators. I am perfectly cortoon that f-n<br />
each case it is regarded as an interim stage only to enble : he<br />
country to be put into a proper state of organisation an. to<br />
enable democratic institutions of some kind to cemele. If that<br />
so, then one must not be in a hurry. If it turns out not to be<br />
and it became as great a matter of plain dictatosLj L. 2 Germany<br />
under Hitler or Italy under Mussolini, then I thinh I Yould be<br />
voting against them. </p>
