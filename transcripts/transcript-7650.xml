PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF UNEDITED INTERVIEW W1T BRIAN REDHEAD, BBC<br />
RADIO 4, LONDON, 20 JUNE 1989<br />
E &amp; O0E-PROOF ONLY<br />
R. EDHEAD: The whole world I think heard and witnessed your<br />
deep concern and upset about China. For a man who's been in<br />
politics a long time, why were you so personally concerned<br />
about it?<br />
PN.: I had a lot of myself invested in China. In a sense,<br />
as I put it in talking to some of my close friends, a little<br />
bit of me died when that happened. I've spent very, very<br />
many hotirs with the Chinese leadership but most particularly<br />
with Zhoa Ziyang in Australia in ' 83 and then in China in<br />
' 84 and ' 86 and what has been happening in China before this<br />
tragedy is many senses one of the most significant things in<br />
the century because we have there this population of over<br />
one billion people coming out of an irrelevant system, a<br />
closed society, to a position of significant economic reform<br />
which meant much to the people of China, meant much for the<br />
region, meant much for the world. To see the possibility of<br />
that war being closed down and being done in a way which<br />
involved the massacre of innocent young people who had no<br />
crime other than to seek a freer society with a tragedy of<br />
immeasurable proportions.<br />
REDHEAD: Can Australia help in any way offering perhaps<br />
sanctuary, not only the people from China, perhaps to people<br />
from Hong Kong, perhaps the Vietnamese boat people?<br />
PM: Well you're mixing up the number of issues there. As<br />
far as the Chinese nationals are concerned we have some<br />
15,000 of then in Australia, including some 10,000 students,<br />
which on a per capita basis is more than anywhere else in<br />
the world I think. I made the decision, we announced that<br />
as far as those people in Australia are concerned we've<br />
extended by another year their visas, their time when they<br />
can stay without concern in Australia and we will review<br />
that position later if it's necessary. So we're doing all<br />
that we possibly can to give a sense of safety and security<br />
to those who are within our borders. As far as the question<br />
of Hong Kong is concerned, we've had for some time a<br />
migration program which has attracted people from there, </p>
<p>PM ( cont): including under our Business Migration Program.<br />
That will be continued as far as the question of the<br />
Vietnamese people are concerned, it's a quite different<br />
issue because the essential characteristic of those who are<br />
leaving Vietnam nov, is that they are not political<br />
refugees, they are economic refugees and that demands<br />
different criteria from all of us and we were prepared to<br />
operate where you had a situation of genuinely a political<br />
refugee.. REDHEAD: Does Australia want to increase its population?<br />
Would it help Australia to be a more populus country?<br />
PM: we obviously have an immigration program which is<br />
directed to that end. We are running an immigration program<br />
with approximately 140,000 a year. We obviously want to<br />
increase our population. I mean immigration has been the<br />
life blood of a growing Australian economy in the period<br />
since the end of the war. We had seven million people at<br />
the end of the war, we are now nearly seventeen million<br />
people which has been predominantly influenced * by our<br />
immigration program. We are going to continue to do that.<br />
REDHEAD: But very controlled?<br />
PM: Well only controlled in terms of your economic<br />
requirements. There is no element of race at all in our<br />
immigration program. The figures that we set for annual<br />
intakes are done essentially in terms of an assessment of<br />
our economic capacity to absorb. The elements of our<br />
immigration program are these. There is the occupation of<br />
shortage category, if I can put it that way. There is the<br />
business migration element whereby people with a significant<br />
amount of capital and the prospect of businesses are<br />
welcome. We have family reunion and we have a refugee<br />
component. All of those elements are then brought together<br />
in terms of the umbrella criterian, if you like, of the<br />
economic capacity to absorb.<br />
REDHEAD: But has it the great economic capacity to expand?<br />
In the Pacific basin which everyone says is going to be the<br />
future of manufacturing in the world, will Australia be a<br />
poor neighbour or a very strong neighbour?<br />
PM: we are a strong neighbour and if we continue to make<br />
the sensible economic decisions which under my Government<br />
are made which you couldn' t guarantee under a successor<br />
but there won't be a successor, we'll continue in Government<br />
if we continue to make those decisions we will be a very<br />
strong partner in the most rapidly growing, most dynamic<br />
region of the world. </p>
<p>REDHEAD: I turn to the environment. You still talk of<br />
Australia as the country of what is it, the flying f ox in<br />
the drifting sand. So in a sense you had awareness of the<br />
environment before other people of the damage that man could<br />
do. PM: well yes we live in what has been historically a harsh<br />
environment. That is those who've settled in the period of<br />
European setttlement I refer to, since 1778 those who've<br />
opened up the continent have had to battle with the harsh<br />
realities of our environment, We haven't always been<br />
sensible in the way we've handled the issue. In fact one of<br />
the incredibly important environmental issues for Australia,<br />
which I'll be significantly addressing in a major<br />
environmental statement I'll be making soon after my return,<br />
is the whole question of soil degredation. We haven't been<br />
sensible in doing all those things that are necessary to<br />
retain your top soil. So we're going to have to do more<br />
about that and we will.<br />
REDHEADz As setting an example to others?<br />
PM: If there are things that we can do which set an example<br />
to others, well and good. I mean the unobvious area where<br />
we have just recently set an example I hope to the rest of<br />
the world is on the question of the Antarctic. We made a<br />
decision that we would not sign the Minerals Convention and<br />
I'm very pleased to say that just in the last two days we<br />
have acquired very significant support. Firstly, Rajiv<br />
Gandhi of India has indicated support for the Australian<br />
position and I've just come from Paris, where as a result of<br />
very interesting discussions I had with Prime Minister<br />
Rocard and President ! 4itterrand, France has joined us in<br />
what will now be a joint mission to try and pursuade other<br />
nations to work for the establishment of an international<br />
wilderness reserve in the Antarctic to make it free from the<br />
deprivavations of mining and other unacceptable forms of<br />
human activity.<br />
REDHEAD: Now what particularly, and this is a final<br />
thought, what particualrly do you want to talk to Mrs<br />
Thatcher about?<br />
Pic Well there are many things that we'll be talking about.<br />
I suppose the most central continuing theme of the days that<br />
we will be here, which will be reflected in my talks with<br />
her and the talks between our other Ministers and her<br />
Ministers and in the 300 odd Australian and UK businessmen<br />
seminar that we'll be having, will be the ways in which we<br />
can strengthen economic and trading links between our two<br />
countries. That will be the single most continuing and<br />
dominant themes, but there are so many other issues that<br />
we'll be talking about as well covering bilateral relations, </p>
<p>PM4 ( cont): regional issues, international political issues<br />
and environmental issues.<br />
REDHEAD; And will you have time to go to the Test Match?<br />
PH: I will have time to go and deliver on the program that<br />
I indicated to the Australian captain Alan Border, before<br />
the start of the first test. We sent a cable wishing him<br />
luck. I said you will win the first test, I will see you at<br />
Lords on Friday when we go into that Test one up.<br />
REDHEAD; Somebody said I also ought to ask what's going to<br />
happen to somebody in Neighbours, but I'm not a Neighbours<br />
fan who is she Daphne. What's going to happen to Daphne<br />
in Neighbours?<br />
PM: I try and keep my fingers on the total Australian pulse<br />
and I have to say that I must confess an ignorance of<br />
Daphne's impending fate.<br />
