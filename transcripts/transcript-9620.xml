CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P. J. KEATING, MP<br />
AN AUSTRALIAN REPUBLIC THE WAY FORWARD<br />
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES<br />
7 JUNE 1995<br />
* Embargoed until 7: 30pm, 7 June<br />
It is the Government's view that Australia's Head of State should be an<br />
Australian that Australia should become a republic by the year 2001. Tonight I<br />
shall describe the means by which we believe this ought to be done.<br />
Honourable members will recall that to fulfil an undertaking given during the last<br />
election campaign, on April 28 1993 the Government established a Republic<br />
Advisory Committee to prepare an options paper which would describe the<br />
minimum constitutional changes necessary to create a federal republic of<br />
Australia. The Republic Advisory Committee was chaired by Mr Malcolm Turnbull and<br />
comprised Dr Glyn Davis, Miss Namoi Dougall, the Hon Nick Greiner, Dr John<br />
Hirst, Ms Mary Kostakidis, Miss Lois O'Donoghue, the Hon Susan Ryan and<br />
Professor George Winterton.<br />
I take this opportunity to thank them. They consulted widely throughout<br />
Australia, carried out their work with dedication and energy and delivered to the<br />
Government and to posterity a most valuable document.<br />
In the eighteen months which have passed since the release of the Report, the<br />
idea of an Australian republic has come to occupy a central place in our national<br />
political debate: not only in this Parliament but within the political parties, in<br />
major representative and community bodies, in schools and universities,<br />
communities at large and, I daresay, around countless Australian dinner tables.<br />
In the process many Australians have come to favour a Republic. Just as many,<br />
perhaps, now believe it is inevitable. </p>
<p>Many may regret the prospect of change and be unsure about the means by<br />
which it can be achieved, but recognise that sooner or later we must have an<br />
Australian as our Head of State. That one small step would make Australia a<br />
republic. Governments can wait for opinion to force their hand, or they can lead. They<br />
can wait for the world to change and respond as necessity demands, or they can<br />
see the way the world is going and point the way.<br />
We are approaching the 21st century and the centenary of our nationhood. As<br />
never before we are making our own way in our region and the world. For us the<br />
world is going and we are going in a way which makes our having the British<br />
monarch as our Head of State increasingly anomalous.<br />
The fact is that if the plans for our nationhood were being drawn up now, by this<br />
generation of Australians and not those of a century ago, it is beyond question<br />
that we would make our Head of State an Australian. Any suggestion that the<br />
British monarch should fill the role would not be entertained. This is not<br />
because our generation lacks respect for the British monarchy, or the British<br />
people, or our British heritage, or the British institutions we have made our own,<br />
or our long friendship with the British in peace and war. On the contrary,<br />
Australians everywhere respect them, as they respect The Queen. But they are<br />
not Australian. It is so obvious, that if we were just now drawing up our<br />
constitution, we probably would not even feel the need to say that the Australian<br />
Head of State will be Australian it would go without saying.<br />
That it does not go without saying today is an accident of history. We are<br />
attached to Great Britain by long threads of kinship and affection which, to a<br />
considerable extent, are embodied in the warmth of our regard for Queen<br />
Elizabeth. Many Australians may well feel that to substitute an Australian for the<br />
monarchy constitutes in some way a rejection of these ties. I think all of us can<br />
understand these feelings.<br />
But the creation of an Australian republic is not an act of rejection. It is one of<br />
recognition: in making the change we will recognise that our deepest respect is<br />
for our Australian heritage, our deepest affection is for Australia, and our<br />
deepest responsibility is to Australia's future.<br />
Nothing in the creation of an Australian republic will alter the facts of our<br />
heritage and our affections. Indeed our relationship with Britain may well<br />
become the more thoroughly " modern relationship" which the British Prime<br />
Minister expressed a desire for two years ago. The development of a mature<br />
and modern relationship will certainly not be inhibited by recognition of the truth.<br />
We are friends with separate destinies to carve out in the world. We are not as<br />
we once were, in a parent-child relationship. </p>
<p>The people of modern Australia are drawn from virtually every country in the<br />
world. It is no reflection on the loyalty of a great many of them to say that the<br />
British monarchy is a remote and inadequate symbol of their affections for<br />
Australia. And we can be equally sure that in the 21st century the British<br />
monarchy will become even more remote from even more Australians.<br />
Australia occupies a unique place in the world and makes a unique contribution<br />
to it. Our destiny is in no-one else's hands but our own: we alone bear the<br />
responsibility for deciding what the nature of our government and society will be,<br />
what advantage we will take of our human and material resources, what kind of<br />
place our children will inherit.<br />
It is not a radical undertaking that we propose.<br />
In proposing that our Head of State should be an Australian we are proposing<br />
nothing more than the obvious. Our Head of State should embody and<br />
represent Australia's values and traditions, Australia's experience and<br />
aspirations. We need not apologise for the nationalism in these sentiments, but<br />
in truth they contain as much commonsense as patriotism.<br />
This is a point worth making: this republican initiative is not an exercise in<br />
jingoism; it is not accompanied by the beat of drums or chests. It asserts<br />
nothing more than our unique identity. It expresses nothing more than our<br />
desire to have a Head of State who is truly one of us. It changes nothing more<br />
than what is required to make clear and unambiguous our independence and<br />
responsibility for our own affairs.<br />
It is a small step, but a highly significant one. The government believes that at<br />
this stage of our history it is a logical and essential one. And it can reflect that<br />
stage in our history. An Australian Head of State can embody our modern<br />
aspirations our cultural diversity, our evolving partnerships with Asia and the<br />
Pacific, our quest for reconciliation with Aboriginal Australians, our ambition to<br />
create a society in which women have equal opportunity, equal representation<br />
and equal rights. In this decade we have a chance which few other countries<br />
have; in declaring ourselves for an Australian republic, we can give expression<br />
to both our best traditions and our current sensibilities and ambitions.<br />
At present, under the Constitution, Australia's Head of State is The Queen and<br />
her " heirs and successors in the sovereignty of the United Kingdom". Anyone<br />
reading the Australian Constitution who is unfamiliar with the practical realities of<br />
Australian government would assume that the role of the monarch was central.<br />
In fact, the involvement of the British monarch in Australia's affairs is now very<br />
limited. The Queen's role as Head of State is in most respects carried out by the<br />
Governor-General. Of the responsibilities The Queen retains, the most notable<br />
is her appointment of the Governor-General which, by convention, she does on<br />
the advice of the Prime Minister. </p>
<p>We are not quite alone among the countries of the world in having as our Head<br />
of State someone who is not one of our own citizens, but we are in a very small<br />
minority and a majority of the countries in the Commonwealth of Nations are<br />
republics with their own Head of State. Of the 185 members of the United<br />
Nations, only 15 do not have their own Heads of State and 14 of those 15 are<br />
former British Dominions.<br />
The Queen of Australia is also Queen of the United Kingdom and 14 other<br />
countries in the United Nations.<br />
Notwithstanding that The Queen is Australia's Head of State and fulfils that duty<br />
conscientiously, when she travels overseas she represents only the United<br />
Kingdom. Her visits abroad often tend to promote British trade and British<br />
interests they do not promote Australia's trade and interests.<br />
This is, of course, right and proper for the Head of State of the United Kingdom.<br />
But it is not right for Australia. The right Head of State for Australia is one of us,<br />
embodying the things for which we stand, reminding us of those things at home<br />
and representing them abroad. We number among those things fairness,<br />
tolerance and love of this country. It is a role only an Australian can fill.<br />
Each and every Australian should be able to aspire to be our Head of State.<br />
Every Australian should know that the office will always be filled by a citizen of<br />
high standing who has made an outstanding contribution to Australia and who, in<br />
making it, has enlarged our view of what it is to be Australian.<br />
In these and other ways, the creation of an Australian republic can actually<br />
deliver a heightened sense of unity, it can enliven our national spirit and, in our<br />
own minds and those of our neighbours, answer beyond doubt the perennial<br />
question of Australian identity the question of who we are and what we stand<br />
for. The answer is not what having a foreign Head of State suggests. We are<br />
not a political or cultural appendage to another country's past. We are simply<br />
and unambiguously Australian.<br />
If only by a small degree an Australian republic fulfilled these ideals it would be<br />
worth it.<br />
Measured against other stages of our development it is a relatively simple and<br />
modest undertaking. A hundred years ago, despite their rivalries and the<br />
enormous distances which separated them, the Australian colonies came<br />
together and created a nation. In the course of a century we have evolved from<br />
a collection of British colonies; to a single nation of limited independence; to a<br />
Dominion in the British Empire; to a sovereign nation in all respects bar one. In<br />
the same century we have come through great trials of our collective courage<br />
and ingenuity. </p>
<p>As Australian democracy and society have evolved and developed, the practical<br />
character of Australian government has dramatically changed. For example, in<br />
the 1930s the Governor-General ceased to be the representative of the British<br />
government in Australia and became the representative of the British monarch<br />
alone. In the same decade it was accepted that the British monarch would act<br />
solely on the advice of the Australian government not the British government<br />
in relation to Australian matters; and Australia assumed responsibility for its own<br />
external affairs which had been previously the responsibility of the British<br />
government. In 1930 for the first time, an Australian became Governor-General.<br />
With the abolition of all remaining rights of appeal to the Privy Council in<br />
London, in the 1980s Australian courts became the ultimate arbiters of<br />
Australian law. Also with the passage of the Australia Act, the Parliament of the<br />
United Kingdom relinquished the last vestiges of its power to make laws applying<br />
to Australia.<br />
In every instance, there was controversy. Today it is hard to imagine why the<br />
changes were opposed.<br />
And we are better for the changes. In the 1990s we are stronger, richer and<br />
better placed in the world than ever before. At every stage in our development<br />
there have been hesitations, but in the end we have always recognised<br />
necessity and where our interests lie. If at times we have been cautious about<br />
taking large steps forward, it cannot be said that we have taken any backwards.<br />
That is what we seek with the republic: a small but important step forward the<br />
last step in a process which began one hundred years ago. We think it is time to<br />
embrace the necessary change.<br />
We therefore intend to ask the Australian people if they want an Australian<br />
republic with an Australian Head of State.<br />
The change we propose has very limited implications for the design of<br />
Australia's democracy. It is the so-called " minimalist" option. All the essential<br />
Constitutional principles and practices which have worked well and evolved<br />
constructively over the last hundred years will remain in place.<br />
I stress that these proposals represent the Government's preferred position. We<br />
do not suggest that it is the only position and not open to change. But it is a<br />
position reached after careful consideration of the Advisory Committee's report,<br />
and we believe it to be a wise position that will stand the test of time.<br />
" Commonwealth" is a word of ancient lineage which reflects both our popular<br />
tradition and our Federal system, and we propose that the Australian republic<br />
retain the name " Commonwealth of Australia". </p>
<p>Under the proposals the role of the House of Representatives and the Senate<br />
will remain unchanged, as will the role and powers of the States. We will still be<br />
a Federation. In virtually every respect, our governmental arrangements will be<br />
exactly the same as they are now: the day to day handling of national<br />
government will remain with Ministers led by the Prime Minister; the Cabinet will<br />
continue to deal with the major issues; and Ministers will continue to be<br />
responsible to Parliament and the Australian people.<br />
Our membership of the Commonwealth of Nations headed by The Queen will not<br />
be affected.<br />
None of these things will change, but we will have an Australian as our Head of<br />
State, and we propose that he or she be described by the term " President of the<br />
Commonwealth of Australia".<br />
The President will perform essentially the same functions as the Governor-<br />
General. As with the Governor-General, except in the most exceptional<br />
circumstances, these functions will be carried out on the advice of the<br />
Government of the day.<br />
A former Australian Governor-General, Sir Zelman Cowen, made some remarks<br />
last week which I think bear repeating. They echoed those of a predecessor of<br />
his, Sir Paul Hasluck; and in fact I should think they contain a sentiment common<br />
to every Governor-General since Federation. Sir Zelman described the<br />
Governor-General's role as " the highest single expression in the Australian<br />
governmental structure of the idea that all Australians from all parties and all<br />
walks of life belong to the same nation".<br />
An Australian Head of State would perform precisely this unifying role; and, it<br />
follows, would need to be of the same stature and integrity as we seek in our<br />
Governors-General.<br />
A significant element of the Head of State's role is symbolic; performing<br />
ceremonial duties around the nation and abroad. This is the public aspect of the<br />
office: the means by which the Head of State represents Australia and, by his or<br />
her example and encouragement, provides national leadership.<br />
The Head of State will also continue to perform the formal administrative duties<br />
given to the Governor-General by legislation and which are undertaken on the<br />
advice of the Federal Executive Council. The Head of State's duties here<br />
include formalising government regulations and appointing public officials.<br />
The Head of State will assume the Governor-General's constitutional duties,<br />
most of which are, by convention, performed in accordance with the advice of<br />
the government of the day. These include summoning and dissolving the House<br />
of Representatives and the Parliament as a whole and issuing writs for Federal<br />
elections. The Head of State will also take over the Governor-General's role as<br />
titular Commander-in-Chief of the armed forces. </p>
<p>In line with actual practice, we propose that the Constitution be amended to<br />
make clear that the Head of State will exercise these constitutional duties on the<br />
advice of the government of the day.<br />
Finally, the Head of State will retain those very few powers now held by the<br />
Governor-General which, in the most exceptional circumstances, may be<br />
exercised without, or possibly contrary to, Ministerial advice.<br />
These are the so-called reserve powers. The Republic Advisory Committee<br />
identified these powers as: the power to appoint the Prime Minister; the power to<br />
dismiss the Prime Minister and therefore the government; and the power to<br />
refuse a request by the Prime Minister to dissolve one or both Houses of the<br />
Parliament. The Committee made the point that there are a number of principles or<br />
conventions underpinning our Westminster style of government and the practical<br />
operation of our Constitution. These principles, which are not currently set out in<br />
the Constitution, determine whether the circumstances exist for the Governor-<br />
General to exercise a reserve power and what action would be appropriate.<br />
Theoretically, it would be possible to fully codify or write down these<br />
conventions, assuming one could foresee all the contingencies they might be<br />
required to meet. I have no doubt that a great many people would like to see the<br />
Head of State's discretionary, or reserve, powers tightly defined as they are, for<br />
example, in the Irish Constitution so as to oblige the Head of State to act in<br />
accordance with express rules in the Constitution, or Ministerial advice, in all<br />
circumstances. The question is, then: should the reserve powers which are imprecise and<br />
governed by precedent and convention be codified? Should they be<br />
delineated, cut down or specified precisely in our Constitution, or should they<br />
remain as they apply now, by unwritten convention?<br />
The advantage of codifying the conventions, whether in whole or in part, would<br />
be to bring a degree of clarity and certainty to the options open to a Head of<br />
State in different situations.<br />
However, after careful consideration, the Government has formed the view that it<br />
is probably impossible to write down or codify these powers in a way that would<br />
both find general community acceptance and cover every possible contingency.<br />
As the system evolves there needs to be some capacity to respond to<br />
circumstances quite unforeseen today. Tightly defined rules can themselves<br />
have unforeseen consequences. </p>
<p>Were we to try, by Constitutional amendment, to set down precisely how the<br />
reserve powers should be exercised by the Head of State, those amendments,<br />
even if intended to be otherwise, could well become justiciable that is capable<br />
of being adjudicated by the High Court of Australia and required to be<br />
adjudicated by the High Court.<br />
Hence, codification would be likely to result in fundamental change to our system<br />
of government and alter the status of the High Court in relation to the Executive<br />
and the Parliament. Over time, Justices of the Court could well be drawn into<br />
arbitrating purely political disputes whose resolution should ultimately be in the<br />
hands of the electorate. The Court would thus be exposed to public pressure<br />
and, in the inevitable event that a party to a dispute was unhappy with its<br />
resolution, the standing and impartiality of the Court could be called into<br />
question. For these reasons the Government believes that, on balance, whatever the<br />
immediate attraction of this course might be, it would not be desirable to attempt<br />
to codify the reserve powers; and that the design, processes and conventions at<br />
present governing their exercise by the Governor-General should be transferred<br />
to the Australian Head of State without alteration.<br />
We are aware that with this option, there is a risk that Australian governments<br />
may occasionally find themselves in conflict with a Head of State who exercises<br />
political judgment without regard to the conventions. We are also, of course,<br />
conscious of the possibility of a repetition of the events of 1975, when a<br />
government possessing the confidence of the House of Representatives was<br />
denied supply by the Senate. But the question of the Senate's powers over<br />
supply is a very different issue from that of establishing an Australian Head of<br />
State. It is an issue that deserves to be addressed, but it doesn't need to be<br />
addressed at the same time.<br />
If these reserve powers are to be given to a new Head of State, it is critically<br />
important that the authority and source of the Head of State's power is consistent<br />
with the national interest and the continued effective operation of our political<br />
system. There has been considerable debate in the community about how the Head of<br />
State should be chosen. As things now stand, the Governor-General is<br />
appointed by The Queen acting on the sole advice of the Prime Minister.<br />
It is clear that most people believe the Prime Minister should not have such<br />
exclusive power in appointing an Australian Head of State. The debate is<br />
principally between those who support popular election and those who favour<br />
election by the Parliament. </p>
<p>The desire for a popular election stems from the democratic sentiment which all<br />
Australians including all of us in this place share. However, the Government<br />
has come to the view that if a new Australian Head of State were to be elected<br />
by popular mandate, he or she would inherit a basis of power that would prove to<br />
be fundamentally at odds with our Westminster-style system of government.<br />
It should be recognised that a Head of State, whose powers derived from a<br />
general election, would be the only person in the political system so elected. His<br />
or her powers would be nominally much greater than those of all other<br />
Commonwealth office holders, including the Prime Minister and the Cabinet, who<br />
are, without exception, indirectly elected via large elected parties. With a<br />
popularly elected President, potential would exist for the representative and<br />
democratically elected parliamentary chambers, the repositories of the diffuse<br />
power of Australian democracy, to be gradually diminished, while the<br />
embodiment of the nation and great powers were vested in one person. That<br />
would constitute a very dramatic and undesirable change to a system which<br />
all of us agree has served us well.<br />
Whatever differences of opinion may presently exist about the most desirable<br />
mode of his or her election, I think there is a consensus that the Head of State<br />
should be, in some sense, " above politics".<br />
With this the Government agrees. The Head of State should be an eminent<br />
Australian, a widely respected figure who can represent the nation as a whole.<br />
This in fact has been the character of the role of the Governor-General and it<br />
should be protected and retained in the role of a Head of State.<br />
Popular election guarantees that the Head of State will not be above politics<br />
indeed it guarantees that the Head of State will be a politician. As Sir Zelman<br />
Cowen pointed out in his speech last week, a " direct election of a President<br />
would ensure political outcomes"; and he went on to say that people like himself<br />
and another former Governor-General, Sir Ninian Stephen, " would not have the<br />
resources or inclination to contest such an election". We cannot have a Head of<br />
State who is " above politics" if we subject candidates to popular elections we<br />
will get instead politicians, political parties and political campaigns. And we will<br />
get a Head of State with an authority unheard of in our political system and<br />
discordant with some of the basic principles on which that system rests.<br />
We therefore propose, as the Republic Advisory Committee suggested, that the<br />
Head of State be elected by a two-thirds majority vote in a joint sitting of both<br />
Houses of the Commonwealth Parliament on the nomination of the Prime<br />
Minister and the Cabinet. Such a joint sitting would be a unique occasion,<br />
bringing together all the political parties, and both Houses of the Parliament, in a<br />
spirit of bi-partisanship and cooperation. Obviously, before the vote was taken<br />
the non-government parties would have to be consulted to ensure that the<br />
candidate had their support. </p>
<p>It would be impossible for any government to dictate the outcome of this<br />
process. A two-thirds majority vote of both Houses would require bi-partisan<br />
support and ensure that the Head of State had the blessing of all the major<br />
parties. The RAC report makes the point that a two-thirds majority in the present<br />
parliament would require the votes of 40 more members than the Government<br />
presently has. In fact, no government since World War II has enjoyed a twothirds<br />
majority.<br />
A Head of State appointed by both Houses would be subject to removal by both<br />
Houses if it was the opinion of a two-thirds majority that his or her conduct was<br />
inappropriate. This is why, given the difficulties of codification I have described,<br />
and given that we believe the conventions governing the reserve powers will in<br />
large measure need to remain with the Head of State, it is imperative that his or<br />
her mandate does not flow from popular election, but from the representative<br />
power of the House of Representatives and the proportional power of the<br />
Senate.<br />
The other brake on any wilful or misguided behaviour by a Head of State is that<br />
the process of removal should not be contingent on a specified set of facts or<br />
circumstances or conditions. The joint sitting would be unconstrained in its<br />
actions or in its decision by being able to consider squarely the behaviour of any<br />
incumbent.<br />
A further inhibition to misguided or inappropriate behaviour is the proposal that<br />
either House may, by simple majority, initiate a joint sitting to remove or censure<br />
a Head of State.<br />
The Government believes that, taken together the authority and source of the<br />
Head of State's powers coming from the Parliament, removal by the same means<br />
as appointment, and the capacity to censure these elements provide effective<br />
counter-weights to the substantial authority vested in the Head of State through<br />
the reserve powers.<br />
In addition, in the light of the events of 1975, any Head of State determined upon<br />
a controversial course of action would do so in the knowledge that he or she<br />
would be confronted with the weight of public opprobrium, and will be at pains to<br />
ensure that every course of action is both warranted and capable of being<br />
defended.<br />
The Government proposes that, consistent with the convention for Governors-<br />
General, the term of office for the Head of State be five years, and that Heads of<br />
State be permitted to serve one term only.<br />
To prevent any attempt to influence Heads of State by offers of subsequent<br />
employment, we propose that outgoing Heads of State not be permitted to<br />
accept remuneration from the Commonwealth in addition to their pension until<br />
five years have passed since their departure from the office. </p>
<p>As an additional step to ensure that the office of Head of State is not politicised,<br />
the Government proposes that serving and former parliamentarians<br />
Commonwealth, State and Territory be excluded from candidature until five<br />
years have passed since their departure from parliament.<br />
There are other detailed issues that will also need to be addressed. For<br />
example, arrangements for unexpected vacancies would broadly mirror those<br />
currently in place.<br />
It is not our intention that the Government's proposals should affect the<br />
Constitutions of the Australian States. It would be up to each State to decide<br />
how in future they would appoint their respective Heads of State. It is<br />
reasonable to expect that if the Australian people opt for an Australian Head of<br />
State, the States would follow suit. But the question would be for each State to<br />
decide. In this regard, we were interested that a committee commissioned to examine<br />
the issue by the West Australian government concluded that, if the minimalist<br />
approach proposed by the Republic Advisory Committee were to be adopted, the<br />
position of the States within the federation would not be substantially affected.<br />
The Government is ready to have senior Commonwealth Ministers brief State<br />
governments on the proposals and we sincerely hope that all State Premiers will<br />
make constructive contributions to the public debate.<br />
The Government puts forward these proposals to provide a basis for considered<br />
public discussion. The Australian Constitution cannot be changed in any way<br />
without a referendum, and to succeed at a referendum a proposed change must<br />
win the agreement of a majority of voters in a majority of States and a majority of<br />
voters overall.<br />
The Government proposes to put the question of a republic to the Australian<br />
people some time in 1998 or 1999. Acceptance at the referendum will mean that<br />
Australia can be a republic by the year of the centenary of Federation, 2001.<br />
Before the referendum, there will be extensive consultation with the people of<br />
Australia. But it should be clearly understood that nothing we can devise in<br />
addition to the due democratic processes will match those processes in the<br />
information they provide, the debate they stimulate or the power they give the<br />
people. The passage of the Referendum Bill through both Houses of the<br />
Commonwealth Parliament will be followed by an extensive campaign in which<br />
arguments for and against a republic will be put. And the people's vote and the<br />
people's vote alone will decide the issue. </p>
<p>In short, the Constitution requires that the Parliament, the nation's representative<br />
and deliberative body, alone can formally determine the proposals to be put to<br />
the people in a referendum. I stress this point. The Parliament alone can<br />
formally decide what is put in a referendum. At most, any suggested convention<br />
can only be a consultative device and, in obvious ways, an elitist one.<br />
There have been calls for a constitutional convention, but the limitations of that<br />
procedure should be understood.<br />
There were six Constitutional Conventions between 1973 and 1985 followed by<br />
a Constitutional Commission. It is not unfair to say that they were unproductive.<br />
And any future convention not limited to the issue of the republic and the Head<br />
of State, would be a convention going over the same old ground as all the others<br />
before it.<br />
Some people have drawn comparisons with the consititutional conventions of the<br />
1890s, but there is an essential difference between those and any current<br />
proposals. Here, we are attempting a modest change to the Constitution in the<br />
1890s they were attempting to write it. And among the things they wrote was the<br />
requirement that any change to the Constitution must be submitted to a<br />
referendum. That is the democratic obligation we are under today.<br />
The 1890s conventions were proponents of change they were concerned with<br />
one question how to create from the separate Australian colonies one<br />
indissoluble Commonwealth of Australia. So would any convention on the<br />
republic need to be a proponent of the republic, and concerned only with one<br />
issue the best means by which the people of the Commonwealth of Australia<br />
can have an Australian as their Head of State.<br />
The detail of the changes we propose may at first glance obscure the meaning of<br />
them. The meaning is simple and, we believe, irresistible as simple and irresistible as<br />
the idea of a Commonwealth of Australia was to the Australians of a century ago.<br />
The meaning then was a nation united in common cause for the common good.<br />
A nation which gave expression to the lives we lead together on this continent,<br />
the experience and hopes we share as Australians.<br />
The meaning now is still a product of that founding sentiment it is that we are<br />
all Australians. We share a continent. We share a past, a present and a future.<br />
And our Head of State should be one of us. </p>
