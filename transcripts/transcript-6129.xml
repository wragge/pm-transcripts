SPEECH BY THE AUSTRALIAN PRIME MINISTER, HON R. J. HAWKE AC, MP,<br />
AT THE<br />
PRESIDENT'S DINNER, JAKARTA<br />
4 JUNE 1983<br />
YOUR EXCELLENCY, PRESIDENT SOEHARTO* MADAME SOEHARTO,<br />
YOUR EXCELLENCIES, DISTINGUISHED GUESTS, LADIES AND<br />
GENTLEMEN, -I THANK YOU INDEED. MR PRESIDENT, FOR YOUR<br />
WARM WORDS OF FRIENDSHIP TOWARDS ME PERSONALLY AND<br />
MORE IMPORTANTLY, TOWARDS MY COUNTRY AND THE PEOPLE<br />
OF AUSTRALIA. AS THE NEWEST HEAD OF GOVERNMENT IN THIS<br />
REGION I APPRECIATE YOUR WORDS ALL THE MORE,<br />
MR PRESIDENT, COMING AS THEY DO FROM ONE OF THE<br />
LONGEST-SERVING, MOST EXPERIENCED AND MOST RESPECTED<br />
HEADS OF STATE, NOT ONLY IN THIS REGION, BUT IN THE<br />
WORLD. YOU HAVE GUIDED INDONESIA'S PROGRESS FOR<br />
SIXTEEN YEARS AND YOU HAVE JUST EMBARKED ON ANOTHER<br />
FIVE-YEAR TERM. </p>
<p>U YOU WERE CALLED TO THE LEADERSHIP OF THIS NATION<br />
AT A TIME WHEN INDONESIA WAS IN THE DEEPEST OF ECONOMIC<br />
DIFFICULTIES AND WEAKENED BY SEVERE INTERNAL DISCORD AND<br />
EXTERNAL DISSENSION WITH MUCH OF HER NEIGHBOURHOOD.<br />
UNDER YOUR PRESIDENCY, INDONESIA'S ECON IOMY<br />
HAS BEEN TRANSFORMED. BOTH IN THE REGION AND AROUND THE<br />
WORLD, YOUR NATION HAS ESTABLISHED A SOLID REPUTATION AS<br />
A RELIABLE PARTNER AND A GOOD NEIGHBOUR.<br />
YOURS HAS BEEN AN IMMENSE ACHIEVEMENT IN BOTH<br />
THE ECONOMIC, SOCIAL AND POLITICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THIS<br />
VAST AND DIVERSE NATION.%<br />
IF I MAY USE A PHRASE WHICH HAS RECENTLY BECOME<br />
FAMILIAR TO THE PEOPLE OF AUSTRALIA, YOU, SIR, SET YOUR<br />
HAND TO THE TREMENDOUS TASK OF NATIONAL RECONCILIATION,.<br />
NATIONAL RECOVERY AND NATIONAL RECONSTRUCTION AND BY<br />
CARRYING OUT THAT TASK WITH SUCH FIDELITY AND SUCCESS,<br />
YOU HAVE WON AN IMPERISHABLE PLACE IN THE HISTORY OF YOUR<br />
COUNTRY AND THE HEARTS OF YOUR COUNTRY-MEN AND -WOMEN&amp;<br />
MY OWN VISIT -AS PART OF MY FIRST OFFICIAL VISIT<br />
OVERSEAS AS PRIME MINISTER OF AUSTRALIA., UNDERLINES THE<br />
PRIMACY THE GOVERNMENT AND PEOPLE OF AUSTRALIA PLACE UPON<br />
OUR RELATIONS WITH INDONESIA$ </p>
<p>As YOU WILL RECALL, MR PRESIDENT, WITHIN<br />
A MONTH OF OUR ASSUMING OFFICE AS THE NEW AUSTRALIAN<br />
LABOR GOVERNMENT, THE NEW FOREIGN MINISTER, MR HAYDEN,<br />
CAME TO JAKARTA, INDEED, INDONESIA WAS THE FIRST COUNTRY<br />
HE VISITED. IKNOW YOU SHARE MY VIEW MR PRESIDENT, THAT<br />
THAT INITIAL CONTACT WAS MOST FRUITFUL AND VALUABLE,<br />
ESPECIALLY TO THE'EXTENT THAT IT MADE CLEAR THAT THE<br />
CONTINUING DEVELOPMENT OF OUR RELATIONS WAS THE OBJECTIVE.<br />
OF BOTH OUR GOVERNMENTS. IWAS THEREFORE MOST ANXIOUS<br />
TO TAKE THE EARLIEST OPPORTUNITY TO ACCEPT YOUR EXCELLENCY'S<br />
INVITATION TO COME TO INDONESIAS<br />
THE WARMTH OF YOUR WELCOME, SIR, AND THE<br />
THOUGHTFUL ARRANGEMENTS WHICH HAVE BEEN MADE FOR ME,<br />
MY WIFE AND THE PARTY TRAVELLING WITH ME, REFLECT NOT<br />
ONLY THE HOSPITALITY FOR WHICH INDONESIA AND HER PEOPLE<br />
ARE WELL KNOWN, BUT ALSO AM SURE I CAN SAY THE<br />
RECOGNITION OF THE IMPORTANCE AND TIMELINESS OF THE<br />
CONSULTATIONS WHICH FORM THE CORE OF OUR PROGRAM HERE. a a #/ I4 </p>
<p>THOSE CONSULTATIONS HAVE BEEN CONDUCTED FREELY<br />
IN THE SPIRIT OF THE PURPOSE I KNOW WE BOTH DEEPLY SHARETHE<br />
DESIRE FOR AN EFFECTIVE, CONSTRUCTIVE AND ENDURING<br />
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN INDONESIA AND AUSTRALIA THESE<br />
TWO CLOSE NEIGHBOURSi SO DIFFERENT IN SO MANY WAYS,. BUT<br />
WHICH SHARE SO MANY COMMON INTERESTS OF THE HIGHtST AND<br />
MOST ENDURING IMPORTANCE,<br />
AND I FIRMLY BELIEVE THAT FOR US, AS OUR NATION'S<br />
LEADERS, TO NEGLECT ANY OPPORTUNITY TO REMOVE MISUNDERSTANDINGS<br />
AND TO STRENGTHEN THE FOUNDATIONS OF AGREEMENT WOULD BE A.<br />
DERELICTION OF OUR DUTY TO BOTH OUR PEOPLES AND A DENIAL<br />
OF THEIR COMMON DESTINY IN THE REGION WHICH BINDS US<br />
TOGETHER INDISSOLUBLY AS NEIGHBOURS FOREVER.<br />
ACCORDINGLY I HAVE HAD SEVERAL OBJECTIVES IN MY<br />
TALKS HERE. FIRST, WAS MY KEEN DESIRE TO RENEW AND STRENGTHEN<br />
MY PERSONAL RELATIONS WITH YOU, MR PRESIDENT. I HAVE BEEN<br />
ANXIOUS TO EXCHANGE VIEWS WITH YOU ON THE KEY ISSUES OF REGIONAL<br />
AND GLOBAL IMPORTANCE$<br />
SECONDLY, I HAVE TAKEN THIS VALJJABLE OPPORTUNITY TO<br />
MEET MANY-OF YOUR COLLEAGUES AND RENEW OLD FRIENDSHIPS.<br />
THIRDLY., I HAVE SOUGHT TO-IDENTIFY AND EXPLAIN<br />
AUSTRALIA'S ATTITUDE-ON CERTAIN SPECIFIC ISSUES WHICH HAVE<br />
ARISEN BETWEEN US&amp;. 0 a6 </p>
<p>FOURTH, I HAVE TRIED TO USE THIS UNIQUE<br />
OPPORTUNITY TO EXPLORE WITH YOU WAYS IN WHICH WE MAY<br />
BE ABLE TO BUILD ON THE PROGRESS ALREADY MADE TOWARDS<br />
6VERCOMING CERTAIN PROBLEMS.<br />
FINALLY, I HAVE'BEEN ABLE TO CONSULT WITH<br />
YOUR EXCELLENCY ON FURTHER MEASURES WE MAY BE ABLE TO<br />
TAKE TOGETHER TO ADD SUBSTANCE TO OUR MUTUAL PROFESSIONS<br />
OF A DETERMINATION TO REMOVE DIFFICULTIES AND IMPROVE<br />
CO-OPERATION, IT IS OF COURSE NOT APPROPRIATE ON THIS<br />
OCCASION TO DISCUSS IN DETAIL THE COURSE OF OUR DISCUSSIONS<br />
TO DATE, SUFFICIENT TO SAY THAT I WAS DEEPLY GRATEFUL<br />
TODAY FOR THE OPENNESS WITH WHICH YOUR EXCELLENCY TOOK<br />
ME INTO YOUR CONFIDENCE ON INDONESIAN THINKING ON A<br />
RANGE OF MATTERS. I APPRECIATED, TOO, THE CARE WITH<br />
WHICH YOU LISTENED TO ME AS I OUTLINED AUSTRALIA'S<br />
POINT OF VIEW. </p>
<p>r6-<br />
I KNOW, MR PRESIDENT, THAT YOU WILL ACCEPT IT<br />
IN THE SPIRIT OF FRANKNESSi OPENNESS AND SINCERITY OF<br />
TODAY'S DISCUSSIONS IF I REFER, VERY BRIEFLY, TO<br />
EAST TiMOR. WE NEED NOT HIDE WHAT IS A MATTER OF PUg. LIC AND<br />
HISTORICAL RECORD, THAT THE UNFOLDING OF EVENTS IN LATE<br />
1975 AND 76, MARKED A SETBACK IN OUR RELATIONS$<br />
I AM, HOWEVER, CONFIDENT IN OUR ABILITY TO<br />
RESOLVE THOSE DIFFERENCES AND PUT THEM BEHIND US, SO THAT<br />
THEY WILL PRESENT NO OBSTACLE IN THE FUTURE DEVELOPMENT<br />
OF OUR IMPORTANT RELATIONSHIP$<br />
AUSTRALIA ACKNOWLEDGES AND WISHES TO ENCOURAGE<br />
THE MAJOR EFFORTS THE INDONESIAN GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN MAKING<br />
TO IMPROVE THE SITUAT'ION; AND TO IMPROVE THE CONDITIONS OF<br />
LIFE FOR THE PEOPLE OF EAST TIMOR AFTER CENTURIES OF<br />
COLONIAL MISRULE AND THE COLLAPSE OF THE COLONIAL REGIME.<br />
IN THIS CONTEXT WE SHALL BE MAKING NEW AUSTRALIAN<br />
CONTRIBUTIONS TOTALLING $ 1.5 MILLION TO THE INTERNATIONAL<br />
RED CROSS HUMANITARIAN RELIEF PROGRAM ANDTHE UNICEF ASSISTANCE<br />
PROGRAM IN EAST TIMOR.<br />
AND LET ME CONCLUDE REFERENCE TO THIS MATTER BY<br />
PLACING IT IN ANOTHER PERSPECTIVE THE PERSPECTIVE OF<br />
AUSTRALIAN HISTORY. sa17 </p>
<p>Tito<br />
THE PARTY WHICH IHAVE THE HONOUR OF LEADINGTHE<br />
AUSTRALIAN LABOR PARTY -HAS, IN ITS COUNCILS,<br />
EXPRESSED ITS CONCERN OVER THESE EVENTS,<br />
BUT LET ME SAY EMPHATICALLY, THAT THAT EXPRESSED<br />
CONCERN IN NO WAY DIMINISHES THE ENDURING FEELING ' OF<br />
FRIENDSHIP WHICH THE AUSTRALIAN PEOPLE HAVE ALWAYS HELD<br />
TOWARDS INDONESIA, FROM THE DAYS WHEN AN EARLIER AUSTRALIAN<br />
LABOR GOVERNMENT AND THE AUSTRALIAN LA3OR MOVEMENT THE<br />
TRADE UNION MOVEMENT WHICH I ALSO HAD THE HIGH HONOUR OF<br />
LEADING FOR A DECADE GAVE ITS SUPPORT TO THE PEOPLE OF<br />
INDONESIA, IN THEIR GLORIOUS STRUGGLE FOR INDEPENDENCE<br />
NEARLY FORTY YEARS AGO.<br />
IBELIEVE IT IS VALUABLE TO RECALL THAT EPOCH,<br />
FOR, OF SUCH MATTERS, AND MEMORIES,. ARE THE RELATIONS<br />
BETWEEN PEOPLES AND NATIONS MADE, 462/ 8 </p>
<p>BUT IT IS IMPORTANT TO REPEAT THAT, EVEN WHERE<br />
DIFFERENCES EXIST, THEY NEED FORM NO INSURMOUNTABLE BARRIER<br />
IN THE WAY OF DEVELOPING AND DEEPENING THE BASIC<br />
FRIENDSHIP BETWEEN OUR TWO COUNTRIES$<br />
ON THE CONTRARY, IT IS SURELY THE MARK OF THE<br />
MATURITY OF A RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN NATIONS THAT HONEST<br />
DIFFERENCES CAN BE EXPRESSED FREELY AND CANDIDLY<br />
WITHOUT IMPAIRING THE BASIC STRENGTH OF THAT RELATIONSHIP&amp;<br />
IT REMAINS TRUE THAT WE SHARE FUNDAMENTAL<br />
ASSUMPTIONS, WIDE AREAS OF AGREEMENT AND POINTS OF VIEWo<br />
ESPECIALLY ON THE WIDER QUESTIONS OF THE FUTURE OF OUR<br />
REGION ITS PEACE, ITS ECONOMIC GROWTH, ITS STABILITY<br />
AND ITS SECURITY, ABOVE ALL, WE EACH STAND UNSHAKEABLY ON THE<br />
COMMON GROUND THAT OUR REGION AS A WHOLE, AND EACH INDEPENDENT<br />
NATION COMPRISING THE REGION, MUST BE FREE OF OUTSIDE<br />
INTERFERENCE, INTERVENTION, AGGRESSIONj OR ANY ATTEMPT<br />
AT ASSERTING DOMINATION OR HEGEMONY OF ANY KIND. / 9 </p>
<p>9b<br />
HISTORY AND GEOGRAPHY -WE NEED NOT BE<br />
AFRAID TO CALL IT I'DESTINY' HAVE B'RO* UGHT OUR TWO<br />
COUNTRIES TOGETHER AND CONFRONTED US WITH COMMON PROBLEMS<br />
IN THE REGION IN WHICH WE BOTH LIVE. THIS HAS MEANT<br />
THAT WE EACH PURSUE BROADLY PARALLEL POLICIE$ IN<br />
OVERCOMING THESE PROBLEMS.<br />
WE BELIEVE THAT INDONESIA'S INDEPENDENT AND<br />
ACTIVE FOREIGN POLICY REFLECTS MANY OF THE SAME CONCERNS<br />
AS EXPRESSED IN OUR OWN FORWARD-LOOKING APPROACH.<br />
WE NOTE, FOR EXAMPLE, THE SUBSTANTIAL AND<br />
POSITIVE ROLE INDONESIA IS PLAYING IN THE SOUTH EAST ASIAN<br />
REGION, IN PARTICULAR INDONESIA IS MAKING A MAJOR<br />
CONTRIBUTION TO DEVELOPING THE STRENGTH AND SOLIDARITY OF<br />
ASEAN, A COMMITMENT IN WHICH'YOU, MR PRESIDENT, PERSONALLY<br />
PLAY SUCH A KEY ROLE. a<br />
THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT REGARDS ASEAN AS<br />
AMONG THE MOST NATURAL, VIABLE, VALUABLE AND SUCCESSFUL<br />
REGIONAL GROUPINGS IN THE WORLD&amp;<br />
THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT, TOO, IS WORKING TO<br />
ENHANCE THE PROSPECTS FOR SECURITY IN OUR REGION$ </p>
<p>IAM CONFIDENT THAT IN THE FUTURE AUSTRALIA<br />
AND INDONESIA WILL USE THESE AREAS OF SHARED PROBLEMS<br />
AND DEVELOPING COMMON EXPERIENCE TO THEIR MUTUAL ADVANTAGE.<br />
IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WE MAKE THE MOST OF OPPORTUNITIES<br />
TO GET TO KNOW EACH OTHER BETTER BOTH AS GOVERNMENTS AND<br />
AS PEOPLES. WE BOTH NEED TO MAKE A DELIBERATE EFFORT TO<br />
UNDERSTAND BETTER EACH OTHER'S POLITICAL AND SOCIAL SYSTEMS<br />
AND TO LEARN TO RESPECT THE DIFFERENT VALUES THEY REFLECT,<br />
ON THIS BASIS, EACH COUNTRY WILL BE BETTER ABLE TO<br />
ANTICIPATE PROBLEMS WHICH MAY ARISE, AS WELL AS TO<br />
IDENTIFY OPPORTUNITIES FOR CO-OPERATION.<br />
THE BASIC GOODWILL EXISTS ON BOTH SIDES, AND<br />
MUCH OF THE MACHINERY OF CO-OPERATION ALREADY EXISTS.<br />
THE HABIT OF INDONESIAN/ AUSTRALIAN CO-OPERATION<br />
AND CONSULTATION IS ALREADY WELL ESTABLISHED IN A NUMBER<br />
OF FIELDS, INVOLVING BOTH THE GVRMNA N H RVT<br />
SECTORS. Two-WAY TRADE HAS INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY IN<br />
RECENT YEARS. THERE IS SUBSTANTIAL AUSTRALIAN INVESTMENT<br />
HERE. INDONESIA IS A MAJOR DESTINATION FOR AUSTRALIAN<br />
TOURISTS, / 11 </p>
<p>-11~-<br />
OUR DEVELOPMENT CO-OPERATION PROGRAM WITH INDONESIA<br />
is AUSTRALIA'S LARGEST WITH ANY SINGLE COUNTRY EXCEPT FOR<br />
PAPUA NEW GUINEAS TODAY I HAD THE PLEASURE OF OPENING THE NEW<br />
AUSTRALIAN LANGUAGE TRAINING CENTRE IN JAKARTA,<br />
OUR BILATERAL DEFENCE CO-OPERATION PROGRAM AND<br />
CULTURAL EXCHANGE PROGRAMS AND THE YOUTH EXCHANGE PROGRAM,<br />
ARE FURTHER AREAS WHERE, AT THE INITIATIVE OF GOVERNMENT,<br />
A TWO-WAY FLOW HAS BEEN STIMULATED BETWEEN OUR TWO COUNTRIES.<br />
BUT MUCH REMAINS TO BE DONE. THERE IS A NEED FOR.<br />
ROTH OUR COUNTRIES TO BE ACTIVE AT THE GOVERNMENTAL LEVEL<br />
IN PROMOTING UNDERSTANDING OF THE OTHER. MORE THAN EVER THERE<br />
IS A NEED FOR A FOCUSED AND DELIBERATE ATTEMPT FOR EACH<br />
COUNTRY TO EXPLAIN ITSELF TO THE MEDIA AND TO PUBLIC OPINION<br />
IN THE OTHER. FEW SUCH CLOSE NEIGHBOURS IN THE WORLD ARE MORE DIFFERENT<br />
IN CULTURE-AND BACKGROUND&amp; THERE IS SO MUCH WE CAN LEARN ABOUT<br />
EACH OTHER AND, I BELIEVE, FROM EACH OTHER..<br />
IREFERRED AT THE OUTSET TO my GOVERNMENT'S COMMITMENT<br />
TO ESTABLISHING STRONG, CONSTRUCTIVE RELATIONS WITH INDONESIA,<br />
AUSTRALIA'S LARGEST AND MOST INFLUENTIAL NEIGHBOUR. THIS is<br />
NOT ONLY THE DETERMINATION OF THE GOVERNMENT BUT, BEYOND DOUBT,<br />
THE WISH OF THE. OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF THE AUSTRALIAN PEOPLE.<br />
THE IMPORTANCE OF INDONESIA To AUSTRALIA IS SOMETHING ON WHICH,<br />
WITHIN THE AUSTRALIAN COMMUNITY AS A WHOLE, THERE IS A HIGH DEGREE<br />
OF CONTINUITY, CONSISTENCY AND CONSENSUS. 804112 </p>
<p>MY GOVERNMENT BELIEVES IT IS DUTY BOUND<br />
TO GIVE EXPRESSION AND PRACTICAL EFFECT TO THIS<br />
CONSENSUS AMONG THE AUSTRALIAN PEOPLE THAT WE MUST<br />
WORK TOWARDS A SOUNDER AND BETTER RELATIONSHIP WITH<br />
INDONESIA IN THE FUTURE,<br />
THE LONG-TERM SUCCESS OF OUR JOINT EFFORTS<br />
TO BUILD A NEW AND ENDURING INDONESIA/ AUSTRALIA<br />
RELATIONSHIP IN THE FUTURE WILL DEPEND VERY MUCH ON<br />
HOW WE PROCEED NOW. WE CANNOT BUILD ON THE BASIS OF<br />
FALSE EXPECTATIONS OF EACH OTHER, NOR CAN WE EXPECT<br />
TO MOVE FORWARD IN AN ATMOSPHERE OF* MUTUAL SUSPICION,<br />
PREJUDICE, OR RECRIMINATIONSOUR AGREED PRIORITY MUST BE, THROUGH DIALOGUE,<br />
TO LAY EVEN FIRMER FOUNDATIONS FOR A RELATIONSHIP<br />
WHICH IS BOTH MUTUALLY ADVANTAGEOUS AND MATURE,<br />
MR PRESIDENT, AUSTRALIA IS PLEDGED TO THAT<br />
OBJECTIVE, AND I KNOW FROM OUR TALKS TODAY THAT YOU<br />
AND YOUR GOVERNMENT ALSO-SHARE THAT OBJECTIVES " 113 </p>
<p>S* -13-<br />
SO IN THAT SPIRIT OF COMMON COMMITMENT,<br />
YOUR EXCELLENCIES, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, FELLOW GUESTS,<br />
I INVITE YOU TO JOIN ME IN A TOAST TO THE HEALTH<br />
AND HAPPINESS OF PRESIDENT AND MADAME SOEHARTO,<br />
TO THE GOVERNMENT AND PEOPLE OF INDONESIA AND TO<br />
THE ENDURING FRIENDSHIP OF OUR TWO GREAT NATIONS. </p>
