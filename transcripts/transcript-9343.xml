PRIME MINISTER<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
RELEASE OF APEC PERSONS GROUP REPORT " ACHIEVING THE<br />
APEC VISION FREE AND OPEN TRADE IN THE ASIA-PACIFIC"<br />
am pleased to welcome the second report of the APEC Eminent Persons Group,<br />
" Achieving the APEC Vision", which was presented to President Soeharto, the 1994<br />
chair of APEC, in Jakarta today.<br />
Last year at their Seattle meeting APEC leaders welcomed the challenge to achieve<br />
free trade in the Asia-Pacific set by the EPG in its first report, " A Vision for APEC".<br />
The EPG's new report responds to APEC ministers' request in Seattle that the EPG<br />
suggest ways in which that goal might be achieved.<br />
I am very pleased by the general direction of the report and its recommendations.<br />
Australia warmly welcomes and supports the report's central proposal setting a date<br />
for achieving free trade in the APEC region. I also agree wholeheartedly with the<br />
EPG's emphasis on the role APEC must play in stimulating and contributing to<br />
multilateral trade liberalisation.<br />
Further trade liberalisation both in the APEC region and globally will be essential if<br />
APEC's members, including Australia, are to sustain their high economic growth rates.<br />
We have the opportunity in APEC to create a mutually reinforcing process of regional<br />
and global liberalisation that would enhance the multilateral trading system.<br />
It is pleasing to note that much of what the EPG proposes on trade and investment<br />
facilitation is already underway within APEC. For instance, leaders agreed in Seattle<br />
to draw up a set of APEC non-binding investment principles and work on this is<br />
progressing well. APEC is also actively addressing standards and conformance<br />
arrangements. Both should be of considerable benefit to the Australian and regional<br />
business community.<br />
APEC leaders will give careful consideration to the report when we meet in Bogor,<br />
Indonesia in November. But it will be important for APEC leaders to draw on the<br />
widest possible range of ideas the EPG report will therefore be only one of a number<br />
of inputs into our deliberations. In addition to reports from forthcoming ministerial<br />
meetings, leaders will also have before them the report of the APEC Pacific Business<br />
Forum group of APEC business representatives, which they established in Seattle.<br />
Other business groups such as PBEC and the newly-formed APB-NET will also<br />
contribute input.<br />
I would particularly like to thank Australia's EPG representative, Neville Wran, for his<br />
important contribution to the work of the Eminent Persons Group.'<br />
