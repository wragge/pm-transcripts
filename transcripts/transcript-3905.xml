September 1975<br />
I<br />
CRONULLA-SUTHERLAND RUGBY LEAGUE<br />
Th@ Prime Minister added his voice today to<br />
appeals to save the Cronulla-Sutherland Rugby League Club.<br />
Mr Whitlam represented the Cronulla area when he<br />
was first elected to the House of Representatives and his<br />
sons first played football at Cronulla schools.<br />
He said at' that time the area was just emerging<br />
from rural conditions. It had few prepared playing fields<br />
or facilities for its residents.<br />
Since then, local government authorities had done<br />
a magnificent job and the shire was now represented in<br />
first grade competitions in most sporting codes.<br />
Mr IAitlam said: " It would be a tragedy for the<br />
shire and for Sydney Rugby League football if this very<br />
young club which has achieved so much in such a short time<br />
should have to withdraw from the competition because of<br />
temporary financial difficulties."<br />
Mr Whitlam is sending a donation to the club.<br />
