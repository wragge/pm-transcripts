The Prime Minister, Mr E. G. Whitlam, sent the<br />

" The Australian Government strongly supports the objectives<br />
of Amnesty International in its campaign soeeking-the abolition<br />
of torture and the observance of International Humanitarian Law.<br />
The Government regards acts of torture as breaches of basic<br />
human rights and infringements of personal dignity that should<br />
be condemned in all circumstances. The development and<br />
observance of international law which abolishes all forms of<br />
torture is an objective which should be supported by all States<br />
in the interests of humanity.<br />
The Government is determined to take action at every<br />
practicable opportunity to promote the development of all aspects<br />
of International Humanitarian Law."<br />
