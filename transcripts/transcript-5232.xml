ELECTORATE TALK<br />
The Soviet invasion of Afghanistan is a grave threat to the<br />
maintenance of world peace.<br />
Not only has the invasion presented a sharp challenge to the<br />
United States, but it has had a profoundly destabilising effect<br />
extending far beyond Afghanistan and its immediate neighbours.<br />
It is important that we all have a clear perception of the<br />
implications of Soviet actions in Afghanistan.<br />
Large Scviet forces have invaded a small, non-aligned, independent<br />
country. The action taken against Afghanistan is similar to that taken<br />
against Hungary and Czechoslovakia in earlier years. On this<br />
occasion, however, the Soviet Union has moved outside the<br />
Iron Curtain bloc accepted since the War as the Soviet sphere<br />
of influence.<br />
We reject totally the Soviet claim that they were invited into<br />
Afghanistan by the former government in order to protect that<br />
country from external threat.<br />
It is a spurious claim.<br />
The xian who was a pro-Soviet ' leader of Afghanistan before the<br />
invasion was killed after Soviet forces had control of the capital<br />
city of Kabul.<br />
The new ' leader' of Afghanistan was brought into the country by<br />
Soviet officials severals days after Soviet control was established.<br />
He and his so-called ' government' are clearly Soviet puppets.<br />
The Soviet invasion of Afghanistan threatens world peace because<br />
of the strategic iimportance and volatility of the area.<br />
The bordering nations of Iran and Pakistan already not without<br />
their problems have reason to fear for their security.<br />
The next Soviet. objective could well be designed to give it access<br />
to the Persian Gulf and the Arabian Sea. / 2 </p>
<p>-2-<br />
With that access, the Soviet Union could assert control over much",<br />
of the world's oil supplies and a new dominance in the Indian Ocea&gt;,%,<br />
Who can doubt that that is their next objective?<br />
The consequences of any such Soviet action would be intolerable<br />
for the entire world.<br />
It would threaten the security of all countries and fundamentally<br />
alter the strategic balance to the disadvantage of the United States<br />
and its friends, including Australia.<br />
That is why we have decided that Australia must respond strongly<br />
and give a lead to others in our own area.<br />
We! need to make it clear that Soviet action in Afghanistan represents<br />
a serious threat to stability and peace and that the international<br />
community -should not allow any extension or repetition of such behaviour<br />
without the Soviet Union paying a high price.<br />
It. must also be understood that the Soviet Union has lent its<br />
support to other destabilising action as well.<br />
There can be no doubt that. Vietnam would not have moved into<br />
Kampuchea without Soviet support.<br />
The Soviet Union sees Vietnam as-promoting Soviet-interests in<br />
South East Asia and thus it supports the continuing presence of<br />
Vietnamese forces in Kampuchea.<br />
In Southern Africa, the Soviet Union has long encouraged the deepeninc<br />
and prolongation of instability and war.<br />
And now wh: n peace? is so near at hand in Rhodesia, as the country<br />
moves towards legal independence and genuine majority rule, it is<br />
clear that the Soviet Union does not find events there to its liking.<br />
When the Soviet Ambassador called on me at " Nareen" last week, he<br />
could not or would not answer questions as to why the Soviet Unio:-<br />
was not supporting the arrangements, agr~ eed to by all parties,,_.<br />
which hold out the best hope of movement towards peace' in<br />
Southern Africa for more than a decade.-<br />
Despite the hopes-of former years, Sovie . t behavi our Internationally<br />
is clearly unacceptable and the Government has acted todemonstrate<br />
its concern and its opposition.<br />
We have offered to consult with. the United States concerning an<br />
increased Australian contribution to security in the Indian Ocean areE<br />
We have supported United States action on wheat sales, by agreeing<br />
not to replace the 17 million tonnes of grain which the US had<br />
intended to sell t~ o the USSR during 1979/ 80 although our normal<br />
sales to the Soviet Union will continue.<br />
We have withdrawn approvals for two fishing projects off the<br />
Western Australian and Tasmanian coasts;'<br />
We are reviewing Soviet shipping operations in Australia, and no<br />
further approvals will be granted for Soviet research vessels to<br />
visit our ports. </p>
<p>3--<br />
Scientific collaboration with the Soviet Union is suspended as<br />
are all official talks and visits and no new programmes under the<br />
Cultural Programme will be entered into.<br />
Prosident Carter's announcement last. weekend of the US reaction to<br />
the Soviet invasion sought the co-operation of other nations in<br />
imposing sanctions on the Soviet Union.<br />
Australia's response has been prompt.<br />
In fact we have been one of the first Western nations to take such<br />
firm action.<br />
It was important for us to act to let the United S tates know that<br />
it is not alone in the major burdens and obligation it has as<br />
chief defender of the faith of the free world.<br />
Our action has already been warmly received. President Carter<br />
has written to me thanking Australia for our steadfast support<br />
and assistance.<br />
It was, the President said, an invaluable part of the joint effort<br />
of the Western Alliance in this most difficult situation.<br />
We realise that the weight that Australia a nation of 14 millioncan<br />
throw into the scales is limited.<br />
But it is of vital importance that we do all we can to support the<br />
United States, Britain and Canada indeed all . nations that respect<br />
the principles of international law in opposition to the Soviet<br />
action in Afghanistan.<br />
I am delighted to see that the Canadian Prime Mini4ster announced<br />
yesterday a range of measures against the Soviet Union which<br />
are'broadly parallel to those which we have taken.<br />
It may well be that the Soviet troops-will stay In Afghanistan<br />
despite what the United States and other like-minded countries do.<br />
But collectively need to make the price of their action so high<br />
that * It* Will ne* V r 16gain be repeated. </p>
