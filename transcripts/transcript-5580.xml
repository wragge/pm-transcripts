PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA flPJRSDAY, MAY 7 19 81<br />
TELEX TO THE PREMIER OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA<br />
The Prime Minister has sent the following telex to the<br />
Premier of South Australia, Dr Tonkin, with copies to all<br />
other Premiers and the Chief Minister fn. r.. the Northern<br />
Territory: " My dear Premier,<br />
I refer to your telex today relating to the public<br />
discussion in the last 48 hours on the outcome of the<br />
Premiers' Conference last Monday.<br />
I believe that there has been significant misunderstanding<br />
of these matters.<br />
It should be plainly understood that the precise terms<br />
of the Cabinet authority the Treasurer-and I took to the<br />
Premiers' Conference was that the Commonwealth's fin~ l<br />
decision should be determined at the Conference subject<br />
to the firm proviso that the amount to be offered the<br />
States should not exceed real terms plus an amount to<br />
cover absorption of certain items.<br />
The authority did not, as has been incorrectly stated<br />
or: implied, constitute a decision or direction by the<br />
Cabinet that the States should receive real terms<br />
plus the absorption amount.<br />
In these circumstances claims that the States have been<br />
deprived of an additional amount to which they were entitled<br />
are quite incorrect.<br />
As I have said in the Parliament today, the Commonwealth<br />
representatives at last Monday's Premiers' Conference<br />
were operating within ne gotiating gu-Idelines. There is<br />
nothing new at all in that. Indeed, I suggesf&gt; Lthat the<br />
States would have been greatly offended if the Commonwealth<br />
were to come to such a meeting with a fixed position.<br />
It was left to the Treasurer and me, and our colleague-<br />
Ministers at the Conference, to settle the final<br />
Commonwealth position in the light of the arguments<br />
put to us by Premiers and our current assessment of the<br />
limit to which the Commonwealth should go. / 2 </p>
<p>2<br />
Again this is a normal procedure and the Commonweatlh<br />
representatives treated this responsibility-with great<br />
-seriousness and took fully into account the arguments<br />
put forward by the Premiers at the meeting.<br />
The Commonwealth's final decision as conveyed to the<br />
Premiers at the end of the meeting on Monday last<br />
is not negotiable further. There is no question<br />
of providing additional amounts as you suggest in I<br />
your message.<br />
The fullest possible trust and understanding between<br />
the Commonwealth and the State Govrnments is of the<br />
geatest importance,. and will continue to be my<br />
objective and that of the Commonwealth Government.<br />
In the circumstances I do not accept that there is<br />
a need for a special meeting of Heads of Government<br />
as your propose. Yours sincerely,<br />
Malcolm Fraser" </p>
