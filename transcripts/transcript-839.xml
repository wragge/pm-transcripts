PRESS CONFER~ ENCE GIVEN BY THE PRIME MINISTER,<br />
THE RT. HON. SIR ROBERT MENZIES, 9 AT PAR3LIAIENT<br />
HOUSE, CANBERRA, ON TUESDAY, 22ND OCTOBER, 1963<br />
QUESTION-. Any plans for your election policy speech, Sir?<br />
PRIME<br />
MINISTER: November 12th I have in mind.<br />
Q. Have you got any details of your itinerary thereafter?<br />
P. M. No. I think perhaps when I say the 12th November, I ought<br />
to explain to you what I have in mind. You see, we are<br />
living in a new world nowadays. WIe have meetings, we have<br />
television, we have broadcasting all of these, of course,<br />
I will have to employ very actively in all States. I am<br />
proposing this time to do something quite novel. I am<br />
proposing to do my policy speech on television. I know what<br />
that means. That means that I will have to do it telerecord<br />
it, or whatever the words are two or three days<br />
before because, of course it wjill be necessary for it to<br />
be seen and heard in all htates at the same time with of<br />
course simultaneous broadcasting. I have given a lo of<br />
thoughz to this and I think that witn all these new means<br />
available to people of seeing and hearing, it is a modern<br />
thing to say, very well, the policy speech I will this time<br />
do on television so that some I don't know how many two<br />
or three million people will have the opportunity of hearing<br />
and seeing, if that gives them any satisfaction.<br />
Q6 It will be broadcast as well?<br />
P. M. It will be simultaneously broadcast. Yes. That would go<br />
over all round Australia on the 12th November and then on<br />
the 13th I would propose to have my usual large meeting in<br />
my own electorate. You know, in the orthodox way, not just<br />
repeating the policy speech but making a major speech to<br />
my own constituents..... questions.... all the usual business.<br />
Q. Could I ask, Sir, whether that will be in Canterbury or Kew<br />
Town Hall?<br />
P. M. I haven't soon the details of the itinerary, but I do know<br />
that by meetings, by broadcasting of course I always have<br />
to do a number of those a number of televisions, a series<br />
of meetings, I'll go into every State and, I think I am<br />
right in saying, twice into Victoria, New South Wales and<br />
Queensland. So it will be a pretty strenuous business with<br />
a lot of travelling and covering a lot of ground.<br />
Q. Will your policy speech take a. full hour, Sir?<br />
P. M. Oh, I don't know yet. I haven't yot gone through the pangs<br />
of giving birth to it. A lot of work to be done on that yet.<br />
I haven't really got cracking on it, and we have to have<br />
of course, Cabinet discussions, and a lot of work to be lone<br />
on that. I couldn't undertake to say the length of it.<br />
All I know is that in the past when I Love had to sit down<br />
only one man can write a policy speech. Of course lots of<br />
people put their ideas into the pool, but when it comes to<br />
the point, somebody has to write it. I usually start off<br />
by producing cbout 15,000 words and getting it down to<br />
12,000 and then, following the advice Johnson<br />
wasn't it? crossing out all the passages that seemed to / 2 </p>
<p>-2-<br />
P. M. be uncommonly fine and ultimately you get down to 6,000<br />
( Contd.) words. That is in a normal course. I don't know how<br />
long this time. I suppose in one sense, one might say, that<br />
the longest a television audience can be expected to survive.<br />
Q. I take it, Sir, that you will try for a complete national<br />
hook-up?<br />
P. M. Yes.<br />
Q. By that I mean that you would use commercial stations.......<br />
P. M. Oh, I am hoping so. Yes Kew Town Hall, November 13th, I<br />
have just been given. That is the night after this policy<br />
speech. By the way, I don't know whether you knew it, but<br />
after I had come to this conclusion, I found that in the<br />
last West Australian election both policy speeches were put<br />
on T. V. Any of you hear that? Im told that was quite<br />
successful. People appreciated it.<br />
Q. I recall, Sir, that Mr. Chifley did one policy speech over<br />
the radio.<br />
P. M. Yes. That was by broadcasting, there being no T. V. at that<br />
time. Anyhow, T. V. will give people an opportunity of<br />
looking and listening.<br />
Q. Can you tell us, Sir, whether you will be going largely on<br />
the Government's record or will you be breaking a fair amount<br />
of new ground?<br />
P. M. Oh, don't ask me that. I haven't written the policy speech,<br />
my dear fellow. All that will emerge.<br />
Q. Is there any significance, Sir, in that you have to go twice<br />
to Queensland, Victoria and New South Wales?<br />
P. M. Well, I can answer that quite frankly. It is in those<br />
States that we I think7 have the more critical things. Of<br />
course, in West Australia we lost a couple of seats narrowly<br />
and I am going to West Australia, naturally but it would be<br />
pretence to say that Queensland and New South Wales are not<br />
uncommonly important to the Government. They are.<br />
Q. Would you like to give us your forecast, Sir, seat by seat?<br />
Mr. Calwell did it for us last week.<br />
P. M. I know. Mr. Calwell has a faculty for prophecy, and a<br />
taste for it that I have never sought to imitate. All I<br />
know is that by midnight on November 30th, we will have a<br />
pretty good idea.<br />
Q. He is prophesying that you are giving Mr. Holt an armchair<br />
ride into the Prime Ministership.<br />
P. M. Yes, I have noticed this. He seems to keep on repeating<br />
this. Very interesting. Let's see. It is interesting<br />
for two reasons, One is, of course, in saying thathe<br />
assumes that I am going to win the election, which is a<br />
rather agreeable assumption because, of course, if I lose<br />
the election, we will all have an armchair ride to the<br />
Opposition benches, so obviously Mr. Calwell and he has<br />
made that clear anyhow doesn't expect to win the election;<br />
doesn't want it; doesn't expect to win it and is therefore<br />
afraid, so he says, that Mr. Holt will get an armchair ride.<br />
S. ./ 3 </p>
<p>-3<br />
P. M. Unlike me, unlike any of his predecessors, he is to have an<br />
( Contd.) armchair ride, Well, that assumes that I am going to<br />
win. I think that is not a bad assumption. In the second<br />
place, Mr. Caiwell knows as well as I do that if the day<br />
came when I suppose in the course of Nature it will come<br />
some time when I go out, presuming that I am in office, the<br />
succession to me in the leadership of the Liberal Party will<br />
be determined by the members of the Parliamentary Liberal<br />
Party in both Houses. They will make their own choice, not<br />
I, not Mr. Colwell.<br />
Q. Sir, his assumption apparently is that having won the<br />
election, you will then retire somewhere about next June.<br />
P. M. Ah, I see. Well, just to finish that other one. Nobody<br />
gets an armchair ride. People have to be elected and the<br />
parties decide that on my side just as much as on the other.<br />
So the only interesting thing about the prophecy is its<br />
implicit assumption that we are going to win. Well, as to<br />
what happens to me..... Really, one of these days if I ever<br />
get round to writing some memoirs, I will have to set down,<br />
election after election, what the prophecies were. Three<br />
times now Vote for Menzies, and before you can say<br />
" knife", he w-1ill be in the House of Lords. You wontt be<br />
happy, some of you cha-, ps until you make some wretched<br />
thing like an Earl or a L3scount out of me. Doar mae, I<br />
have no ambitions whatever in that direction. Sorry to<br />
disappoint you, None whatever. Then having made me a<br />
peer of some kind, two and three times, now I am going to<br />
resign out of hand. Well, I am feoling pretty well, thank<br />
you. I have heard this sort of story about people<br />
I remember years ago when Mr. Lyons I think it was in<br />
1931; the end of 1931 when ho had become the leader of<br />
what was then the United Australia Party. Everybody said:<br />
Ah, you wait. Of course if they win the election, he won't<br />
be Prime Minister for more than a month or two. One of the<br />
other fellows.... I think it was Sir John Lathara on that<br />
occasion... he was going to be Prime Minister. W4e11, it<br />
didn't happen. Joe Lyons was Prime Minister for seven years<br />
and I am not putting a terminal date on to my tern of office.<br />
The electors-may, if they think fit on November<br />
But I Im not.<br />
Q. Sir, can we take it that you have got no intentions at this<br />
stage of retiring......<br />
P. M. I haven't got it in contemplation at all.<br />
Q* Sir, there is one other thing about the November<br />
election. Mr, Bob Holt, on the day after you made your<br />
announcem., ent of November 30th, the State President of the<br />
A. L. P. in Victoria, said he welcomed the election. Mr.<br />
Calwell now says that the A. L. P. doesn't want the election<br />
on November 30. Have you any thoughts as to why?<br />
P. M, Well I didn't knew tha-t Mr. Halt wanted one. R. 94. Halt<br />
is il? I knew that Mr. Colwell didn't want one because<br />
having been very eager to have one far a long timae in this<br />
Parliament, he has devoted the la-st five or six weeks to<br />
explaining what a terrible thing it is and I understand<br />
the other night he said he doesn't wont one. Of course<br />
he doesn't want one. If I thought I was going to lose the<br />
election, I wouldn't want one either. It's just as simple<br />
as that. Politics is a renl business. 0 0 0 0/ 4 </p>
<p>Q. Well, Sir, what about his other charge that having got<br />
back on November 30, you will immediately put in some sort<br />
of a credit squeeze. In other words, he talks about a<br />
snap election and a snap credit squeeze.<br />
P. M. Oh yes, I read that. Very clever phrases these are. He has<br />
got to say something. This is a mere figment of his<br />
imagination about a credit squeeze. After all I sympathise<br />
with my friend Mr. Calwell. For the last eighteen months,<br />
he has been talking about nothing but unemployment and now<br />
it is disappearing out of the window in fact, completely<br />
gone well, you have to get on to something else. I have<br />
been an Opposition Leader, I know what it is like. Credit<br />
squeeze, gometimes these fellows ought to make up their<br />
minds as to what they really do believe. In one breath<br />
they say the country is in a terrible state of depression<br />
and misery, and in the next breath, they say there is such<br />
a boom that you fellows will impose a credit squeeze. They<br />
can't be right both ways.<br />
Q. Sir, in Queensland which seats do you plan to concentrate on?<br />
P. M. Oh, I don't know. I haven't seen the itinerary, but your<br />
guess is as good as mine. You know the seats we lost. Of<br />
course nowadays with so many ways of addressing the electors,<br />
you can occasionally cover a couple of seats from one place.<br />
I haven't worked out this itinerary yet. All my fellows are<br />
wcrking on that.<br />
Q. Do you, Sir, intend to use television much more extensively<br />
this is for personal interview than you have done in the<br />
past?<br />
P. M. Well, I hale forgotten how much I used last time, but I think<br />
it runs something like this: that I am proposing to televise<br />
the policy speech for obvious reasons and this is a modern<br />
matter. Then I think that I may do a couple more much<br />
shorter television pieces you know, under the allocation<br />
that is made for purposes of the election. I know that I am<br />
taking part in two or three or four party television setups<br />
you know, the kind of thing that happened last time.<br />
So I daresay I will have to gaze into the camera into that<br />
wretched unresponsive lens, what? Half a dozen times.<br />
Perhaps more. Then I think I am up for about half a dozen<br />
five-minute broadcasts and perhaps a final broadcast which<br />
takes longer. Butapart from that, I will be on the platform<br />
and having meetings in the orthodox way and no doubt<br />
receiving the compliments from the boys at the back of the<br />
hall. But I enjoy that.<br />
Q. Will you be making any statements, Sir, before the House<br />
rises, on the timetable or the proposed form of the restrictive<br />
trade practices?<br />
P. M. Oh, don't ask me this. Look now you're asking me to say<br />
what is going to be in my policy speech. Oh, no.<br />
Q. In Western Australia, Sir, will you -a ve time to gat to<br />
Gora ldton?<br />
P. M. I would doubt it. I'm not sure. You see7 the trouble is,<br />
within the limited period of time, there is a limiit to how far<br />
you can go. I will have to travel many thousands of miles<br />
anyhow. .000* 0 </p>
<p>Q. Do you recall that trip last time to Gcraldton?<br />
P. M. I do. I do very much. Anyhow we cane back with some<br />
Dongara crays. Did you ret any? I wondered what was wrong<br />
with you.<br />
Q. Moving away from elections in a way, has the Government<br />
provisionally chosen the bomber, or will the bomber to be<br />
chosen depend on the outcome of Mr. Townley's discussions?<br />
P. M. Look, all I can say about that problem is that Mr. Townley<br />
went over especially on this matter. He is extremely well<br />
acquainted with the Secretary for Defence, Mr. McNamara<br />
in America. They are on very close terms. He is at<br />
this moment engaging in discussions with him. I can't say<br />
any more than that at the present time, but when I can,<br />
I will. </p>
