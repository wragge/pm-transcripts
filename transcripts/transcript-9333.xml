PRIME MINISTER 78/ 94<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P. J. KEATING MP<br />
NEW LANDCARE PROJECTS FUNDED<br />
More than 700 new community environment projects are to be funded under<br />
the Federal Government's National Landcare Program.<br />
The $ 5 million in grants which will be funded under the Land and Water, One<br />
Billion Trees and Save the Bush elements of the National Landcare Program,<br />
will make it possible for communities to make a significant contribution to<br />
repairing the land.<br />
Land degradation is one of our most serious national environmental<br />
problems. But this is an area where there is an historic alliance between<br />
farming and conservation groups and between all levels of government in<br />
support of a common aim.<br />
Of the total funding $ 2.5 million has been allocated to Land and Water<br />
projects, almost $ 1 million to the One Billion Trees and $ 1.5 million to Save<br />
the Bush.<br />
The projects have been recommended by State and Territory Assessment<br />
Panels which are made up of community, state and local government<br />
representatives.<br />
The remainder of the grants under the $ 112 million Landcare program in<br />
1994/ 95 are allocated to joint Commonwealth/ State projects and research<br />
activities. Senator Collins will announce further details today of the $ 72.95<br />
million grants for new and continuing projects under the land and water<br />
elements of Landcare.<br />
The National Landcare Program is a catalyst for mobilising information, skills<br />
and resources to improve the capacity of all land holders to manage their<br />
land in an economically viable and environmentally sustainable manner.<br />
The Government has committed more than $ 420 million during the Decade of<br />
Landcare ( 1990-2000) for Landcare and related tree planting and remnant<br />
vegetation conservation programs.<br />
