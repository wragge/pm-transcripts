PRIME MINISTER<br />
CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
OPENING OF HERMITAGE EXHIBITION<br />
SYDNEY 9 MARCH 1988<br />
One of the highlights of my visit to the Soviet Union late<br />
last year was the tour Hazel and I were able to make of the<br />
Hermitage in Leningrad, home of one of the world's great art<br />
collections. The Hermitage is one of the largest and most venerable art<br />
collecting institutions in the world. As people lucky<br />
enough to have visited it can testify, Its international<br />
renown is well deserved. Its size was conveyed to me by the<br />
director of the Gallery in these terms: that if a visitor<br />
spent only one minute before each item of the collection it<br />
would still take eight years to complete the viewing.<br />
During my visit, I was pleased to pay tribute to the Soviet<br />
authorities responsible for making available to Australia in<br />
1988 this wonderful exhibition of paintings and drawings.<br />
It gives me pleasure to repeat those thanks now.<br />
This very fine gesture to mark the Bicentenary is one to<br />
which I attach particular significance as an indication of<br />
the importance the Soviet Union attaches to relations with<br />
Australia. The exhibition has been made possible under the Cultural<br />
Exchange Agreement between our two countries, an agreement<br />
under which a range of admirable and innovative activities<br />
have over the years enhanced mutual understanding between<br />
Australian and Soviet citizens.<br />
In return for this exhibition and other Soviet cultural<br />
contributions, the Australian Ballet and an Aboriginal art<br />
exhibition will this year tour the Soviet Union. In 1989 a<br />
return exhibition of French art works from this gallery and<br />
the National Gallery of Victoria will be shown in the Soviet<br />
Union. 004967 </p>

The Bicentenary has provided a good opportunity to build on<br />
the contacts between our peoples. Australians were thrilled<br />
to join the Soviet cosmonauts in their space station during<br />
the telecast of " Australia Live", which marked the opening<br />
of the Bicentennial Year on 1 January. We are happy too, to<br />
welcome the Soviet Union as one of the 50 or so Govei'nments<br />
participating in world Expo 88 in Brisbane.<br />
within Australia, the director of the Art Gallery of<br />
New South Wales Edmund Capon deserves our thanks and<br />
congratulations for his work in creating the exhibition.<br />
It gives me particular pleasure to declare the exhibition<br />
open and in doing so I offer congratulations to all those<br />
responsible, both in Australia and in the Soviet Union, for<br />
their work over a number of years to bring these Leningrad<br />
masterpieces to Australian audiences.<br />
With the benefit of my partial preview of this exhibition in<br />
Leningrad, I can assert with confidence that it will prove a<br />
memorable experience for all who see it in Australia 0 0496G8 </p>
