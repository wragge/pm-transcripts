    <content><![CDATA[<p>Australia has lost a sporting giant and a racing legend.</p>
<p>Few people have dominated a sport like Bart Cummings did. He will be remembered as a truly great trainer, the winner of literally thousands of races.</p>
<p>Twelve of those victories were Melbourne Cups and in five of those wins he also trained the runner up, an extraordinary achievement. Race day will not be the same without him.</p>
<p>On behalf of all Australians, we extend our sincerest sympathies to Bartâs wife of 61 years, Valmae, his children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren.</p>
