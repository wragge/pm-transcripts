JAL,<br />
PRIME MINISTER 16 February 1983<br />
SOUTH AUSTRALIAN FIRES<br />
I have this afternoon spoken to the South Australian<br />
Government about the disastrous fires which broke out<br />
in that State today.<br />
I want to make It clear that the Commonwealth stands ready,<br />
to assist the South Australian Government and the people of<br />
South Australia who ate suffering grievously as a result of<br />
the present bushfires.<br />
Already some 120 Defence Force personnel from Army Woodside<br />
and RAAF Edinburgh are deployed fighting the fires. Additional<br />
Army personnel at Keswick are being recalled to assist.<br />
If there are any additional Defence facilities needed,<br />
we stand ready to assist forthwith within the limits of<br />
Defence capacity.<br />
The Commonwealth will supplement immediately on a dollar<br />
for dollar basis measures designed for the immediate relief<br />
of personal hardship and distress in accordance with the<br />
Natural Disaster Relief Arrangements.<br />
It will also, in accordance with the arrangements, provide<br />
assistance on a $ 3 Commonwealth/$ I State basis above the<br />
agreed base figure for expenditure on restoration of<br />
gubli c assets and emergency protection and repair work<br />
y State, Local and Semi-Government authorities and a<br />
range of assistance measures for primary producers affected<br />
by the fires.<br />
I have told the South Australian Government that if there<br />
are particular circumstances in relation to this fire,<br />
and particular proposals that the State would want to<br />
put forward to assist in recovery from this very serious<br />
disaster, then we would stand ready to examine the position<br />
as a matter of urgency. This is the practice-we have adopted<br />
in all States in these circumstances.<br />
I have asked Ian Wilson to consult personally with the South<br />
Australian authorities and to give me an immediate and personal<br />
assessment of the damage.<br />
I extend my very real sympathy to the families of those<br />
who have died, to those who have been injured and who have<br />
suffered grave and serious loss. I also extend my good wishes<br />
to those who are battling this disaster. </p>
