PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR PRESS OCTOBER 27, 1976<br />
ADDRESS AT THE HOBART PRESS CLUB<br />
From time to time, it is useful to set the daily rush of<br />
events into perspective to review the ground we have<br />
covered and what lies ahead.<br />
I would like to take this opportunity to talk about the national<br />
perspective which has guided the government-in its policies<br />
this year and which marks out our future course.<br />
There is increasing evidence still early and tentative to be<br />
sure that the fight against inflation is being won.<br />
That fight is still a long way from being over, but we can<br />
take heart from the signs of progress, which are now emerging.<br />
The gains that have been made have been hard won, and we must<br />
not. throw them away. Inflation is the greatest single threat<br />
to jobs, to savings, to the young, to the ret * ired, to the poor.<br />
It is the greatest single threat to individual security.<br />
Until it is under control it will remain a threat to our<br />
national future.<br />
That is why, throughout this year, we have given top priority<br />
to the attack on inflation so many of the other objectives<br />
we all have for ourselves, and for Australia, depend on success<br />
in that.<br />
The successes so far achieved have been won through the<br />
restraint of all sections of the community. Government has<br />
lowered its demands so that resources can be freed to the productive<br />
private sector. I believe there has developed widespread<br />
appreciation among the great majority of wage and salary<br />
earners, and rank and file trade union members, that by<br />
restraining wage demands costs can be contained and more jobs<br />
createAI. Such restraint is frustrating in the short term but it is the<br />
best possible guarantee that real growth in production will<br />
take place so that real wages will start rising again.<br />
A new wages spiral such as the one provoked by the Labor<br />
Party during its term of office will ensure that inflation<br />
will revive and consequently unemployment will remain high,<br />
recovery will be delayed and uncertainty and insecurity will<br />
continue. / 12 </p>
<p>This restraint has made possible the introduction'* of full<br />
personal tax indexation.<br />
This year, the tax reduction under-indexation for a taxpayer<br />
with dependent spouse on average weekly earnings i * s $ 4.60 per week.<br />
Next year, tax indexation will mean a further reduction in tax<br />
compared to 1975/ 76 rates. Just how much will depend on the<br />
rate of inflation.<br />
At 12% inflation next year, the saving for this same taxpayer<br />
would be a further $ 3.96 per week compared with tis year, and<br />
$ 10.60 per week compared with the 1975/ 76 rates. At 6% inflation,<br />
the taxpayer with a dependent spouse on average weekly earnings,<br />
would be paying $ 7.50 per week less than if 1975/ 76 rates still<br />
applied.<br />
This year personal tax indexation is worth $ 990 million to<br />
Australian taxpayers. By next year taxation revenue will be<br />
some $ 2 billion less as a result of indexation adjustments.<br />
It is an important aspect of our total attack on inflation.<br />
In setting this year in perspective it is very import ant that<br />
we understand why Australia has suffered so high a rate of<br />
inflation and why unemployment is so high.<br />
The fundamental reason was a particular approach to the role of<br />
government in our society. The nation's leaders know or<br />
ought to know that at any * one time the wealth of Australians is<br />
liptited if more is spent in one direction, less is<br />
available to spend in another.<br />
What happened in the year 1972-1975 was that this basic reality<br />
was ignored. There was a-massive transfer of control over<br />
national production to the government. In one year federal<br />
government spending increased its share of gross domestic product from<br />
24 to 30 percent. At the same time the government encouraged<br />
massive wage claims among those organised into strong unions.<br />
The Whitlam Labor Party encouraged grossly exaggerated<br />
expectations about what government could do, failing to tell the<br />
country about all the hidden costs which have now become apparent.<br />
All that money the Labor Party collected in ever higher taxes<br />
had to come from somewhere all that money that went into<br />
excessi've wage claims had to come from somewhere. It came out<br />
of the savings of the retired; it came from those on fixed<br />
incomes, those not organised into strong unions; it came<br />
as the poverty report points out by depressing further the<br />
condition of the poor; and finally it -came from the earnings-of---<br />
private enterprise which were needed to provide jobs.<br />
At the end of Labor's term in office, despite large increases.. n<br />
the number of people looking for jobs, there were no more jobs<br />
in private enterprise than there had been three years before.<br />
Inflation, in part through the above mechanisms, had<br />
destroyed job opportunities.<br />
Perhaps the most shocking aspect of this experience is that there<br />
were not more vigorous protests about what was happening<br />
at the time. 3 </p>
<p>How could this happen? I suggest the reason was that -over<br />
the years we in Australia and people in other western<br />
countries as well had lost sight of some basic realities<br />
about government and our way of life. We began-to take it<br />
for granted that the-economy would keep on Producing<br />
more and more, regardless of what anyone did two decades<br />
of prosperity made it seem as if growth would go on forever.<br />
After years of slowly rising government spending too many<br />
began to assume that the way to solve all-problems was<br />
simply to increase government spending a bit more it<br />
didn't seem credible that more government spending could<br />
actually be counter productive. The further idea grew<br />
up that any worthwhile activity was enctitled to support out of<br />
public funds, and that public funds were so vast that it wasn't<br />
necessary any longer to set priorities.<br />
The result was a do ubling of the size of the federal budget in<br />
three years, a huge increase in the number of people employed<br />
by government, a tax burden which increased by 20% on t he<br />
person--on average earnings, an economy producing less rather<br />
than more, and an increase in unemployment of 180,00* 0 in one year.<br />
An economy which has historically coped better than av erage with<br />
inflation, turned in'one of the worst performances of any<br />
industrial country., Certainly there-was world wide inflation<br />
but since the Second World War the changing structure<br />
of the Australian economy had improved Australia's capacityto<br />
absorb overseas economic fluciuations without large domestic<br />
effects. Our export base had broadened; unlike most OECD countries<br />
we were spared any significant direct impact from the large<br />
rise in oil prices overseas.<br />
Inappropriate domestic policies were the princip al cause of<br />
the economic setback we suffered.* Moreover, it became very<br />
obvious' that government couldn't keep growing bigger without also<br />
becoming more powerful. Power became more and more centralised<br />
in Canberra. As government took an ever-increasing proportion<br />
of people's earnings, people began to realise th * ey were gradually<br />
losing control over their lives and becoming more and more<br />
dependent on what politicians chose to provide.<br />
Throughout the western world there has-been a fundamental<br />
reappraisal of the course that has been taken. The path of<br />
rising taxation, expanding bureaucracy growing regulation and<br />
centralisation of power is no longer seen as the path to a<br />
better life it is more clearly seen now for what it is: the path<br />
to a 1984 kind of society.<br />
it is widely recognised now that government spertding which<br />
becomes too high too rapidly, simply feeds inflation and unemploymentmore<br />
spending makes the problem worse, not better.<br />
Virtually all major countries have now proposed reductions in<br />
the rate of growth of central government spending between their<br />
last fiscal year and their present one. In the United Kingdom<br />
from 28 to 17%; in Canada from 19 to 13%; in Germany from 19 to 4%;<br />
in New Zealand from 29 to in the United States from 13 to 11%;<br />
and in Australia. . from 23 to 11%. As I said earlier there are now<br />
clear signs that this strategy iSworking. </p>
<p>But beyond the present crisis there are * some fund . am. ental<br />
questions we need to answer as a nation. We cannot<br />
simply take up once again, the attitudes we held * before<br />
this crisis.-because those attitudes the ones* I have<br />
mentioned were sf'gnificantly responsible for the problems<br />
we now face.<br />
Take the attitude I mentioned towards government spending.<br />
In recent years, government has been able to spend on many<br />
things because inflation brought a vast unlegislated windfall<br />
to revenue. Inflation produced hidden tax increases each<br />
year which ' helped supply the funds for these programmes.<br />
It is just not possible to keep increasing the tax burden<br />
without significantly affecting incentives and expectations<br />
and policies based on the assumption that taxes can be raised<br />
indefinitely must fail.<br />
The approach we have seen in recent years is not a viable approach<br />
for the longer term. Indeed, taken to the extremes of the last<br />
few years, it is not even a viable approach in the short term.<br />
It is the easiest thing in the world for a politicians to promise<br />
some great new scheme of-government spending.<br />
No such promise can be made which does not have to be paid for<br />
by the work and effort ' of the Australian people. It is time<br />
we looked with scorn at the politician who promises expensive<br />
panaceas for all our national,-problems who acts as if<br />
government revenue were manna from heaven rather than the product<br />
of labour and effort.<br />
Every promise to spend must be backed by the energy, the initiative,<br />
the capacity to create of the Australian people. The politician<br />
produces nothing himself he relies on the work, the product<br />
of others.<br />
In the end our standard of living as well as our capacity to<br />
introduce new government programmes, depends on how much., we<br />
produce ourselves, by our own efforts on how hard and how well<br />
we are prepared to work. Japan has few natural resources she<br />
imports her coal, her iron ore, much of her food. Yet<br />
the Japanese people have guild their nation into one of the most<br />
prosperous in the world.<br />
Australia has great natural resources massive reserves of<br />
coal,, iron and ' other minerals; huge areas of fertile land<br />
for primary production. We perhaps need to ask ourselves where<br />
we would be without these resources what our stand of living would<br />
be what our capacity to help poorer countries would be.<br />
The only way we can pay for major new social programmes, to<br />
help those in real need at home and abroad, is to produce more.<br />
Producing more doesn't necessarily mean working harder.<br />
It means working better, more effectively; it means<br />
improved organisation better relations, between-labour and management;<br />
it means better use of equipment, better training. </p>
<p>If our national production had grown in the last two years<br />
at the average rate of the previous decade, our G. D. P. would<br />
be $ 3,000 billion larger in real terms than it was-in that year.<br />
We would be that much more able to offer assistance than we are<br />
now. Since our wealth as a people tends to rise in real<br />
terms by an average of about 5% per year, this is the limit of<br />
viable average increases in Government spending-. If we want<br />
Government to spend more without inflation, we have to produce<br />
more. This requires a much more reasonable set of expectations than<br />
some have evidenced in recent times. It is not the Australian<br />
people who have been unreasonable, but politicians politicians<br />
who have either not understood the consequences of their own<br />
actions or have deliberately misled the Australian people about<br />
what they the politicians could provide.<br />
Moreover, we should certainly not take it for granted that in any<br />
year a real increase in government spending is desirable.<br />
There are clearly occasions when it is desirable to hold the<br />
real value of government spending constant, or even reduce it so<br />
that reductions in taxation can be made.<br />
We must not allow ourselves to get into the situation where<br />
taxes can only be increased never reduced.<br />
It will always be possible to point to problems where more<br />
government spending could help. What needs to be kept much more<br />
clearly in--view than in the past is that people tend to know<br />
their own needs much more clearly than government ever can.<br />
Proposals for more government spending have to be measures<br />
against their impact on the independent capacity of people to meet<br />
their own needs most effectively.<br />
A willingness to make vast promises is not a mark of social<br />
responsibility. It can be most irresponsible if the cost is<br />
a further erosion of people-Is capacity to meet their own needs<br />
in the way they think best.<br />
Personal independence or autonomy is not something to be taken<br />
lightly. It is one of the most-important foundations of selfrespect<br />
and at a social level, it ensures that people are able<br />
to give effect to their real priorities and not priorities which<br />
a few politicians determine for them.<br />
This point was made very strongly by the proverty report.<br />
It said: " An adequate income is fundamental to a person's security,<br />
/ well being and independence. It enables him to<br />
provide housing, education, food transport aid other<br />
essentials for himself and his family.<br />
An adequate income allows him freedom of choice and freedom<br />
to participate in activities of his choice."<br />
Government spending which is too high erodes freedom, independence<br />
and security. As we have seen only too clearly, people do not<br />
necessarily become or feel more secure simply because<br />
government is spending more. ./ 6 </p>
<p>Thatis why, for example, in the welfare area we are stressing<br />
reforms which are-aimed to help those in need with'the<br />
independence and opportunities those on higher incomes have long<br />
enjoyed. This is. in accordance with the principles of,<br />
the poverty report, but quite contrary to the Labor Party<br />
approach which emphasises vast costly universal schemes<br />
which inevitably mean'less for thos-e in real need.<br />
The radical family allowances scheme we introduced.<br />
earlier this year -:. one of the most important welfare reforms<br />
since federation shifted assistance to families towards those<br />
in most need..<br />
Over 300,000 families and 800,000 children who were debarred<br />
wholly or partly from benefiting from the rebate system, are<br />
now being assisted by the family allowance.'<br />
The family allowance scheme does not add to bureaucratic<br />
overheads, and it places money in the hands of people. It does<br />
not increase their dependence on the government, but lets<br />
people make their own chuices about what their needs are and<br />
how best to meet them. It is a scheme which both assists<br />
the disadvantaged and increases their independence'.<br />
The same approach underlies the housing allowance voucher<br />
experiment-we have initiated. As the Treasurer said in<br />
his budget speech: " Should the experiment prove successful,<br />
implementation of suchia programme would<br />
give low income families the financial means<br />
to select their own rental accommodation<br />
on the open market.<br />
It would provide a new mechanism to make<br />
welfare housing sensitive to the needs of the<br />
users. It takes into account the view of the Commission<br />
of Inquiry into Poverty.<br />
Protecting the security of individual income against ever<br />
rising government spending requires that we continue our<br />
concern with teh scope, structure, and efficiency of the<br />
government sector.<br />
This year we have set the course by a number of major measures.<br />
We have reduced the size of the Federal Public Service<br />
significantly, and will be continuing this policy through this<br />
next year. Under guidelines now established the Federal Public<br />
Service by June next year will be thousands lower still than the<br />
levels projected under the Labor guidelines for 1975-76.<br />
As you will be aware, we have also begun a major decentralisation<br />
of government power and functions through the Federalism reforms.<br />
Hobart, of course, has an-important place in these reforms as<br />
the location of the Advisory Council for Inter-Government<br />
Relations. 7 </p>
<p>. Working under the Premiers' Conference the Council-is<br />
expected to make through its studies a valuable contribution<br />
to the efficient operation of Government in Australia.<br />
The Federalism policy reflects'an entirely different attitude<br />
to the important reg'ions of Australia. It ' is an historic<br />
reversal of the trend towards centralism. A recognition<br />
that Australia cannot be a strong and prosperous country is<br />
its regions are neglected.<br />
Before the election last year, we made'a number of firm commitments<br />
to help the development of Tasmania.<br />
Those commitments have been honoured. We undertook to introduce<br />
full freight equilisation for Tasmania in the light of the<br />
Nimmo Report. The scheme we announced and which has been<br />
in operation since 1 July this year goes beyond the Nimmo<br />
recommendations. The-new federal financial arrangements will<br />
bring some $ 4.7 million more to Tasmania than the old scheme.<br />
We have been very much aware of the needs of Hobart following<br />
the bridge disaster. So far some $ 24 million has been spent by the<br />
Commonwealth as a result of the disaster. Very substantial<br />
assistance will be made available this year as well.<br />
The Commonwealth is also assisting in the establishment of the<br />
South West National Park through the provision of funds and<br />
through the Australian National Parks and Wildlife. Service.<br />
More important, our reforms will greatly assist Tasmania to<br />
meet its needs in the way Tasmanians think best. Australia<br />
this year, has set out on a new and exiting course.<br />
We have a remarkable opportunity in Australia to try a new<br />
approach to many problems. Austral-ia is a country with certain<br />
unique characteristics. Incomes are more equally distributed<br />
in Australia than in almost any country in the world.<br />
Australians, on the whole do deal with each other un a basis of<br />
mutual respect. Australia has never suf ' fered the exploitation<br />
of more unequal socieites. Australiansmare move educated, better<br />
informed than ever before.<br />
This is a nation pre-eminently suited to the ip. telligen . t exercise<br />
of freedom and individual choice.<br />
But restoring prosperity to Australia, enabling Australia to play<br />
the role in the world we would like her to. play, depends<br />
ultimately on what we as individuals are prepa.,-d to do.<br />
Our own efforts are going to be the main determinant of the kind of<br />
Australia we create. If we develop the attitude of trying to<br />
get is must as possible for as small a contribution as possible,<br />
Australia is never going to become the great country we<br />
know it can be. Such an attitude is neither socially responsible<br />
nor in our own interests as a people. We cannot evade our<br />
responsibilities by trying to leave it to the Government.<br />
Governments alone cannot promise security security for the<br />
elderly, the sick, the poor, those without jobs. Security must<br />
be backed by the productive wealth of the nation. Untimately<br />
the security of all Australians depends on what all of us do.<br />
Any Government, any political party which fails to make that </p>
<p>8.<br />
plain is misleading the nation and evading its responsibilites.<br />
Socially responsible action in these circumstances action<br />
which builds a strong basis for individuals security is<br />
action directed to helping us work more effectively.<br />
That is reality. We have to fact up to it.<br />
I am confident that most Australians are well aware of this.<br />
It will be their efforts, in the end, that will make Australia<br />
a stronger and more compassionate society than it has<br />
ever been before. 000oo00000 </p>
