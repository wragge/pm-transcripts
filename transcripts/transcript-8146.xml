TRANSCRIPT OF NEWS CONFERENCE, ILLAWARRA STEELERS CLUB,<br />
WOLLONGONG, 27 SEPTEMBER 1990<br />
E OE PROOF ONLY<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke can we get the Balance of Payments<br />
figures out of the way first? They've been described<br />
generally as being within market expectations. What do you<br />
have to say about it?<br />
PM: Well they seem to be in about the middle of the market<br />
expectations, 1.8 billion. There was over $ 300 million of<br />
Qantas imports in that and importantly the downward trend in<br />
imports which has been apparent for many months has<br />
continued. So we are on line with the Budget expectations<br />
and importantly the Government policies which have been<br />
aimed at two things. That's firstly dealing with the<br />
current account deficit and secondly with inflation. They<br />
are on target. Of course when I say that about inflation<br />
you have to have one question mark there which has been<br />
acknowledged as to what the impact of oil prices will be but<br />
as far as these figures are concerned on the important<br />
question of the current account deficit the Budget forecasts<br />
seem to be on track.<br />
JOURNALIST: Still, Prime Minister, a look at the breakdown<br />
in exports. The rural sector is still performing very<br />
badly. PM: Well wool of course is very bad. Now we see in this<br />
morning's paper an indication that perhaps the Soviet Union<br />
is going to come back into the market and of course if they<br />
do that that will be a good thing. But wool there ' s<br />
nothing Gove: cnment can do about that other than exhortation.<br />
We're sending Minister Kerin overseas with a mission to the<br />
Soviet Union and other countries to try and revive the<br />
overseas interest in the wool market. I think that will<br />
come. JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, any chance of ta:: relief as a<br />
result of the windfall from the oil price rise?<br />
PM: No. The question of t~ x relief is not on the agenda.<br />
You'll appreciate that in January there will be significant<br />
tax cuts coming up which have already been legislated for.<br />
JOURNALIST: rural lobby groups today called for<br />
some sort of crisis meeting with the Government about the </p>
<p>situation facing the rural sector. Is that something that's<br />
on the cards?<br />
PM: I'm always prepared to meet representatives of the<br />
rural industry in the 7 years we've been in Government I've<br />
frequently me~ t with them. Of course the basic problem of<br />
the rural industry is, as it's been in the past in times of<br />
crisis, is the fall in their commodity prices. The only<br />
thing basically that Government can do on the prices receive<br />
side is what I have been, myself and had my Ministers<br />
working hard on, and that is in the Uruguay Round to try and<br />
ensure that we get a reasonable outcome on agriculture out<br />
of the Uruguay Round. Because what's been an enormously<br />
devastating thing for Australian rural producers, who are<br />
the most efficient producers in the world, is that they are<br />
denied access; to the large markets. I mean in Europe, North<br />
America, but as bad as that is what's been even worse is the<br />
export subsid~ isation by those trading blocs of their rural<br />
producers which has meant that our more efficient producers<br />
have been losing markets or suffering significantly reduced<br />
prices in markets. Where if there were free competition we<br />
would be doing very very much better.<br />
JOURNALIST: South East forests. You've granted an extra<br />
week for discussions before any decisions are made.<br />
Obviously the people on the South coast are extremely<br />
concerned that this has been an ongoing problem. Will the<br />
Government have a final solution by October the 8th?<br />
PM: I hate -the phrase final solution. The Federal<br />
Government responded to a request from the New South Wales<br />
Government for more time but we've made it quite clear that<br />
the final decisions as far as we're concerned will be made<br />
by the 8th of October. This is an area where I want to get<br />
an outcome which will get the proper balance that is<br />
necessary for the community. That is the protection of jobs<br />
and the making available of adequate resources, the timber<br />
industry, getting that balance with the responsibility that<br />
we have for this and future generations of having<br />
ecologically sustainable development, as we put it. I hope<br />
and believe that we will get the balance right.<br />
JOURNALIST: Jervis Bay is another environmental issue.<br />
You ' ye ruled out the fleet base relocation what about<br />
disarmaments depot?<br />
PM: There is further consideration of that matter going on<br />
and-. again I. hope that we'll-be.. able to find a location which<br />
matches the needs of the navy with the proper consideration<br />
that we must give to the environment. There's further work<br />
going on on that. I hope we'll be able to come up with an<br />
acceptable solution.<br />
JOURNALIST: current account<br />
PM: Just a minute the Current Account I'm back on here. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Financial markets believe that there is scope<br />
with today's figure for an ease in interest rates by the<br />
middle of next month and that would also help the rural and<br />
the manufacturing sectors?<br />
PM: When you. say the financial markets believe, what's the<br />
financial markets. You mean certain people who purport to<br />
speak for the! financial markets express a view. Well that<br />
they express that view is not surprising.<br />
JOURNALIST: You don't think there's any room for an easing<br />
in interest rates?<br />
PM: I think that I have the responsibility as Prime<br />
Minister not to say anything which can influence the<br />
movements in the markets because that's to no-one's<br />
advantage. Let me say this, that in 1990 we've had four<br />
discreet reductions in interest rates, four percentage<br />
points in prime rates. That is proof of the fact that this<br />
Government in co-operation with the Reserve Bank authorities<br />
has been prepared to give effect to the commitment we made.<br />
That is that when circumstances were appropriate and we<br />
believe we could safely move to reductions in interest rate<br />
levels we would. Now we've given proof of our capacity and<br />
readiness to do that during this year and we will follow the<br />
same process, that if the circumstances are adjudged<br />
appropriate and that we can responsibly further reduce rates<br />
then they will be.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, you've just spoken to the local<br />
unions. Their concerns are mainly unemployment. Did you<br />
make any conmitment to them, especially on relocation<br />
the tax office<br />
PM: They've raised a number of matters, including that one.<br />
I have indicated, as I have before, that I have sympathy<br />
with them. That's not just of words. I have sympathy<br />
with them. I have more than that. I believe you know<br />
something may develop in this area but I'm not prepared to<br />
make a specific comment upon that now. Things are happening<br />
in that area.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, an immigration issue, some of<br />
the Cambodian boat people have been waiting up to nine<br />
months. Is a decision on them forthcoming<br />
PM: You say that some of the Cambodian people have been<br />
waiting for nine months. I can tell you my friend that<br />
there are people in the refugee camps in Asia who have been<br />
waiting years and years and years and years. So get your<br />
balance and priorities right.<br />
JOURNALITIST: Prime Minister, yet again holiday makers' air<br />
travel plans: have been interrupted through regrettable<br />
circumstancets. Do you think this country's becoming more<br />
sophisticate-d, is the union movement becoming more<br />
sophisticatetd in its response to the problems that arise and </p>
<p>4.<br />
seem to influence people like the airlines where it's<br />
directly not even their problem?<br />
PM: Well, obviously when you have a problem like this it is<br />
disturbing and I wish that it hadn't happened. But you ask<br />
whether the trade unions, plural, collectively are becoming<br />
more sophistiLcated and responsible. If you were listening<br />
to my brilliant address here today you would've heard one<br />
part of it indicating that in the steel industry in this<br />
region, in this year the level of industrial disputes is<br />
five per cent of what that level was at the beginning of the<br />
which would be proved positive I would suggest of the<br />
increasing sophistication and sense of responsibility of the<br />
trade union movement. If you want to reflect that on an<br />
aggregate level for the whole of Australia there has been a<br />
59% reduction in industrial disputes since 1983. So yes the<br />
evidence is overwhelming that the trade unions of this<br />
country have become both more sophisticated and more<br />

substantial increase in investment. Which will mean that in<br />
the longer term Australia is going to become more<br />
diversified and more economically able to insulate itself<br />
from the devastating effects of wide swings in commodity<br />
prices. Now having said all that you're still in a free<br />
democracy where there is the right of industrial action.<br />
You're going to have some exercises of that freedom which do<br />
appear to be irresponsible and I think in this case you can<br />
categorise the stoppage in that way. I think it's<br />
particularly unfortunate that it's occurred at a time which<br />
inflicts problems on kids and their holiday period. I don't<br />
like that and I hope that it's very quickly stopped.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, a year ago we had the pilots<br />
strike, the planes were down and the Government was quite<br />
vocal then about Yet the Government has been very very<br />
quiet about this latest round I mean I believe your<br />
comments just now are the first you've made.<br />
PM: Yes well, if you just sit down and think about and<br />
if you believe that there's an analogy between what the<br />
pilots were trying to do there and this dispute well I think<br />
you really do need to do a bit more thinking.<br />
JOURNALIST: In The Age this morning Mr Willis was quoted as<br />
saying that if oil prices remain high the Government must<br />
look at some! form of tax relief. Is he speaking out of<br />
turn? PM: Mr Willis never speaks out of turni.<br />
JOURNALIST: So there is no lik'eiihood-of tax relief?<br />
PM: That doesn't follow. You see, what you seem to forget,<br />
I don't knowr why, is that we've been in office for seven and<br />
a half years and we have shown in the whole of that period a<br />
preparedness and a capacity to deal with changing economic<br />
circumstance. s and make the decisions which are appropriate </p>
<p>to those chan~ ging circumstances. Nothing's new. If a<br />
position arises where you needed to look at the level of<br />
taxation because a new situation had arisen then the whole<br />
of our record of seven and a half years shows that we'd be<br />
prepared to do that. But I'm not going to speculate at this<br />
point that the circumstances as they exist now require that<br />
decision. JOURNALIST: Just to bring it down to a local level<br />
PM: You pay taxes here too don't you.<br />
JOURNALIST: You made a commitment today to look at the<br />
report. Do you think we might get another commitment of<br />
some dollars and cents in the short term?<br />
PM: I don't know about the short term but I think I'm<br />
entitled to look the citizens of Illawarra directly in the<br />
eye and say well you look at Bob Hawke's record, has he got<br />
a commitment to this region, does he take seriously the<br />
proposals that are put up? I think the answer is yes. I<br />
think this is a very good piece of work that has been done<br />
and I will not only look at it closely myself but I will see<br />
that it's examined by all relevant Ministers and<br />
departments. I say this, if there are ways that we believe<br />
that we can positively respond to proposals that have been<br />
put and that we can responsibly do that then that will<br />
happen. JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, have you made any commitment to the<br />
South Coast Labour Council on approaching the Greiner<br />
Government over building projects like Caloola Pass?<br />
PM: I think any discussions I've had with the Labour<br />
Council at least at this stage ought to remain confidential.<br />
But I have certainly listened to a range of matters that<br />
they've raised. I think that they have put up serious<br />
questions for consideration and I've given them an<br />
undertaking -that I will look at them. Obviously some of the<br />
things that -they've raised are more within the area of State<br />
Government responsibility. I'm prepared to raise them in<br />
that context too. But my first reaction will be to go back<br />
and talk with~ my Ministers who have a responsibility in the<br />
areas where -the issues have been raised.<br />
JOURNALIST: Millions and millions of dollars worth of<br />
projects. I mean there was one for example out at Brandon<br />
Park, they. said $ 600,000, way . too. much. You-haven't got<br />
that sort of money. I mean we're talking about millions of<br />
dollars here. Where's the money going to be coming from?<br />
PM: Well the money that governments provide comes out uofthe<br />
pockets of taxpayers. That's where the money comes<br />
from. I haven't got a mint that I just create money. State<br />
governments really haven't got it. Where the money comes<br />
from is out of the pockets of taxpayers. The responsibility<br />
of governments is to get a proper balance between what you<br />
expect the taxpayers will pay and what you understand </p>
<p>taxpayers want expenditures outlaid on. That's what<br />
government is about. You've got to try and get your<br />
priorities right. I think that at the Federal Government<br />
level we have. I'm not altogether sure as far as this<br />
region is concerned that the State Government has.<br />
JOURNALIST: So some of these would be pie in the sky?<br />
PM: Well I don't think any of the things that have been<br />
raised with me are pie in the sky.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, Bob Hogg said the other day<br />
that he thought that there should be more open forums and<br />
would like in one way to address the leadership crisis, the<br />
membership crisis<br />
PM: He said, Bob Hogg certainly thinks there's no<br />
leadership crisis. He's very happy with what he's got.<br />
JOURNALIST: Do you agree with the idea for more open<br />
forums?<br />
PM: I'm always in favour of open forums. But I think<br />
really that as far as the Labor Party is concerned if you<br />
look at the political parties in Australia we're the open<br />
forum party. I mean we couldn't be more open. We do it at<br />
length. I would always support Hogg or any other operative<br />
in the Party who was calling for more discussion. I don't<br />
think you can ever have too much of discussion of issues.<br />
This recent exercise that we've had was invigorating I think<br />
in that at the industrial and political level the discussion<br />
went on for a very considerable period. We refused to<br />
pre-empt the discussion at the early stages by having a<br />
Cabinet decision. We waited till the very end discharge<br />
the responsibility we had of saying what the Government<br />
position was. In the process I think the Party came through<br />
it well. The important thing on that particular issue is<br />
that we will go into the next election with an absolute<br />
dichotomy between Labor and the conservatives because Labor<br />
remains totally committed to a competitive<br />
telecommunications system within which there is a fully<br />
publicly-owned telecommunication facility operating<br />
internationally and domestically. The others want to<br />
dispose of that absolutely and to put it totally into the<br />
hands of the private sector as I've indicated. That's a<br />
debate. You talk about open forums. I'll be debating and<br />
arguing that at the Tories for all the time between now and<br />
the _ next. election.<br />
ends </p>
