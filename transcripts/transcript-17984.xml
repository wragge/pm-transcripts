Prime Minister Julia Gillard today acknowledged an important milestone in Australia's strong and vibrant democracy as the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet (PM&amp;C) celebrated 100 years of service.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister said that for 100 years the department has played a vital role in coordinating government business and in delivering the highest quality of advice and support to government.</p>
<p>Over this time, PM&amp;C has become recognised as one of the key departments of state within Australia's federal system, playing a key role in supporting the Prime Minister, Cabinet and Ministers.</p>
<p>PM&amp;C is at the centre of government and plays an important role in shaping the Australian Public Service (APS) as well as being a proven training ground for future leaders of the APS.</p>
<p>To mark this occasion, the book From postbox to powerhouse: A centenary history of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet by Professor Patrick Weller, Professor Joanne Scott and Bronwyn Stevens was launched by Senator John Faulkner on behalf of the Prime Minister. This book shows the evolution of the department and the evolving nature of government administration in Australia through photos, historical fact and anecdotes.</p>
<p>Senator Faulkner said that From postbox to powerhouse was a fitting record of the department's history and those who have served prime ministers for a century.</p>
<p>Both the Prime Minister and Senator Faulkner congratulated and thanked past and present PM&amp;C officers for their service to successive Australian governments and their important role in Australia's robust democracy.</p>
