BROADCAST BY THE PRIME MINISTER ( MR. MENZIES)<br />
for the<br />
OPENING OF WORLD REFUGEE YEAR IN AUSTRALIA<br />
1959 has been named World Refugee Year by the United Nations.<br />
In the resolution carried in November of last year, it was<br />
decided to focus interest in the refugee problem and to encourage<br />
additional financial contributions from Governments, voluntary agencies<br />
and the general public.<br />
An Appeal was made to all Member States to promote World<br />
Refugee Year. This humane resolution was carried against the votes<br />
of the Soviet Bloc. Australia has fully accepted and is participating<br />
in it. Since the war the problem of refugee has been both melancholy<br />
and acute. There are many thousands of refugees in Europe<br />
and these are added to every day. In the Middle East there are a<br />
million Arab refugees. From China have come thousands of refugees<br />
of European origin. In Hong Kong there are at least a million Chi-.<br />
nese refugees. We, in Australia, have in earlier years brought over<br />
200,000 refugees to our shores. Our country is, on a population basis<br />
the leading country of refugee settlement. Living unler good<br />
conditions and with complete freedom, we night have had little reason<br />
to understand the heart-breaking experience which has been undergone<br />
by so many people driven from their hones and occupations<br />
into strange countries, there to eke out a miserable and precarious<br />
living in completely unaccustomed circumstances. The refugee problem<br />
is in that sense one of social and eccnomic resettlement. In<br />
another sense it is a moral problem.<br />
It is to Australia's credit that she has, in fac,, understood<br />
such matters very well, In one sense this, of course, is a<br />
problem for Governments; in another, a problem for the Churches;<br />
but in the major sense it is a problem for pivate citizens who desire<br />
to make some humane contribution to its soluticn.<br />
The Commonwealth Government gives a lead. We have promised<br />
a cash contribution of Å“ 50,000. and also that ' public donations<br />
to this fund will be allowable deductions for income taxpurposeso<br />
The matter is non-party. The Right Honourable the Leader of the Opposition<br />
is supporting it. But bearing in mind the splendid tradition<br />
of generous giving in Australia for -ood causes, I e no<br />
doubt that the public response will be immediate and great,<br />
It has not been easy for organised world opinion in the<br />
United Nations or elsewhere to act directly in respect of some of<br />
the dreadful events which have driven so many people from their own<br />
hones and their own fatherland, but at least \ e can in the : most<br />
practical fashion show our sympathy for those less fortunate than<br />
ourselves who have been the innocent victims of conflicts and upheavals<br />
of which in our own land we have been happy enough to kn. w<br />
nothing. It is a good thing that Australia should have earned a<br />
reputation for a sensitive understanding of the problemsof people in<br />
other lands; that we should not come to be regarded as people who<br />
are detached from the miseries of the world. I know that we will<br />
not come to be so regarded, for I believe that there are no people<br />
anywhere with warner hearts and more generous imprl' ses, This aprea"<br />
therefore, is at one and the sane time a challenge and an opporlun--<br />
ity. I am confident that we shall make a contribution which<br />
will serve as one more proof of our instinctive national and individual<br />
understanding and genercsity.<br />
CANBERRA 27th September, 1959. </p>
