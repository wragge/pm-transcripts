PRIME MINISTER<br />
STATMET BY THE PRIME MINISTER. THE NON P. J. KURATING, MU'<br />
RESPONSE TO HEWSON POLICY STAT2Wf<br />
Dr Hewsan talked today about looking people in the eye<br />
and what he failed to do once again was look Australians<br />
in the eye and tell them bow a 15 per cent Goods and<br />
Services Tax will create jobs when it has taitled<br />
everywhere else.<br />
What he called today a tax reform is in fact a tax slug.<br />
Today's Liberal Policy launc -h did nothing but increase<br />
the speed with which Dr Hewson's credibility is fading.<br />
It was notable not for what was announced, but for what<br />
was kept secret or left unexplained.<br />
Hie failed to answer real concerns about the key question<br />
in this election campaign.<br />
He tailed to explain why Australia needs a Goods and<br />
Service. Tax.<br />
He failed to show how it would create one new job.<br />
He failed to release a list of the goods and services<br />
which will rise In price uinder a GST.<br />
He failed to explain why all small -businesses must become<br />
tax collectors and waste hours each week processing his<br />
complicated GST paperwork.<br />
Hie also failed to explain how he will fund his promises,<br />
given the $ 7-8 billion hole dug by his absurdly inflated<br />
Telecom figure.<br />
He also tailed to say why he wants to remove bulk-billing<br />
for 13 million Australian. and make people pay $ 32 up<br />
front for each visit to the doctor.<br />
He tailed to explain why he and John Howard will not<br />
release the Coalition's industrial relations legislation<br />
until after the election.<br />
He failed to explain why he wants to pay Australia's<br />
youth $ 3 an hour. while paying doctors $ 3 a minute. 6785 </p>
<p>2<br />
He failed to explain why he wants to restrict access to<br />
education by charging full fees for university more<br />
than $ 25,000 for an arts degree.<br />
He failed to explain why he wants to cut S53 million from<br />
th AR nd make others cuts to SBS. the Australia<br />
Council and the CSIRO.<br />
He failed to explain how, with his attacks on living<br />
standards, wages and working conditions, universal health<br />
care, education, social security, and our greatest<br />
cultural institutions, his GST package differs from those<br />
policies which have failed with a devastating social and<br />
economic impact in other countries.<br />
He failed to explain why Australia needs a failed model<br />
.1 with a debilitating and unjust flat tax-at the centre of<br />
It.<br />
And, perhaps most importantly, he failed to explain why Dr<br />
Howson's package of:<br />
a 15% consumption tax a 42% cnmpaLny rate a<br />
disruptive industrial relations model<br />
is likely to ' create more jobs than Labor's<br />
no consumption tax a 32% company rate<br />
cooperative industrial relations an investment<br />
allowance of. up to<br />
While Dr Hewson was pretending to look Australians in the<br />
eye, he should have also taken the chance to explain to<br />
them the policies he has failed to release or adequately<br />
explain such as the environment and industrial relations.<br />
