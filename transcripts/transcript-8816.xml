I I. ADDRESS BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON PJ. KEATING, MP<br />
BEST7 PRACTICE AND WORKPLACE BARGAINING, INTERNATIONAL<br />
BEST PRACTICE CONFERENCE, SYDNEY, 15 FEBRUARY 1993<br />
There are people who say this country is not performing, that we are not making progress,<br />
that if we keep going the way we're going we haven't a future.<br />
Those people are not here today.<br />
There are people who think that the way through the difficulties we still face lie in<br />
radically regressive labour market policies.<br />
There are people who think that the way to get the best out of your business is to knock<br />
the stuffing out of your workers.<br />
Those people are not here today.<br />
There are people who think that Australian companies can never compete with the best in<br />
the world.<br />
Those people are not here today. And, today, if they were, they would not take up much<br />
room. The people who are here today have proved that Australian companies can be as good as<br />
any in the world; that our business leaders and managers have the will and the<br />
wherewithal to compete with the best, that our workforce has the skills and the spirit to<br />
do it, and that our industrial relations culture has the capacity to encourage and support<br />
change while protecting everybody's interests.<br />
This is the heart of the argument about Australia. This is where we succeed or fail in the<br />
effort to be a great trading nation, a nation which can make and sell abroad the products<br />
6290 </p>
<p>2<br />
of our labour. our skills, and our imagination. This is where our ability to secure our<br />
future will be determined.<br />
Don't let anyone talk this country down. Australia is succeeding, and succeeding more<br />
rapidly than any of us ever imagined was possible.<br />
Let me start with a few numbers quite startling numbers. There are now more than 700<br />
enterprise agreements registered with the Industrial Relations Commission.<br />
These agreements now cover thirty per cent of all Australian employees under federal<br />
awards.<br />
That's in just 7 months since the Parliament passed the new legislation which encourages<br />
the making of these single enterprise agreements which improve flexibility and<br />
productivity. We have agreements in the construction industry, in banking, tourism, manufacturing and<br />
the public sector.<br />
Our industrial structure is rapidly changing, too. Australian manufacturing industry is<br />
coming alive.<br />
Manufacturing output is up by 25 per cent over the last decade.<br />
Manufacturing productivity has increased at twice the rate for the economy as a whole.<br />
In recent years our international competitiveness in manufacturing has increased more<br />
rapidly than all but two of twenty three countries surveyed by the OECD.<br />
We can see the results in the dramatic increase in manufacturing exports. They have<br />
tripled over the decade, and manufacturing exports now match rural exports.<br />
Over the last two or three years high technology manufacturing exports have been<br />
growing faster than any other an average increase of 20 per cent a year.<br />
For me, as no doubt for a lot of you, this is all tantalisingly suggestive of a dream come<br />
true. In the 1970s I remember only too clearly being told that Australia could not be both a<br />
successful exporter of raw materials and farm products, and a successful exporter of<br />
manufactures. It was the prevailing wisdom of the ruling Coalition parties. It had long been an<br />
Australian mind set. ( 3291 </p>
<p>3<br />
1 remember thinking, as I'm sure some of you did: if this is true, how do we account for<br />
the greatest manufacturing country on earth? How do we account for the United States?<br />
In fact, it soon became clear, to me, not only that we could become a modem<br />
manufacturing nation, and ani exporting nation, but that we had to. To preserve our way<br />
of life, to seize our chances in the world, we had to.<br />
More than anything else, that is what the last decade has been about. Changing the<br />
prevailing wisdom. Changing our goals and the way we do things. Changing the stature<br />
and identity of Australia in the world.<br />
We have proved we can be both. In fact, we've proved we can do even better that we<br />
can be a successful exporter of commodities and high tech manufactures and a successful<br />
exporter of services.<br />
Some of the numbers are so startling we've doubted they could be true but they are:<br />
exports of office machinery and data processing have increased forty fold over the last<br />
decade. exports of metal working machinery have increased 135 per cent over the last three<br />
years. electrical machinery exports by 100 per cent.<br />
motor vehicle exports by 73 per cent.<br />
We have the enterprise agreements, we have the birth of successful export manufacturing,<br />
and we have them both in an environment which allows us to get on with the job.<br />
We have the lowest levels of industrial disputes for thirty years.<br />
We have the lowest inflation we've seen for thirty years.<br />
Two of the biggest problems we have had over the last 30 years have been beaten.<br />
And both have gone because of the Accord.<br />
Professor Bluestone remarks in his book Negotiating the Future that " teamwork,<br />
co-operation and mutual trust are in; adversarialism is out" o.<br />
Professor, you're right: and in this neck of the woods it's been on its way out for some<br />
time. mean in both the wide industrial relations system and in the workplace. </p>
<p>We camne out of the early 1980s recession with inflation running at 11.5 per cent. We are<br />
coming out this time with inflation under 2 per cent. Industrial disputes today are<br />
running at less than half the level of the early eighties.<br />
We've emerged from the recession, with advantages we've never had before. But we'ye<br />
also emerged with unemployment which is far too high.<br />
All our efforts in the past year have been directed at curtailing unemployment. In the<br />
One Nation Statement just on a year ago, in the Youth Employment Statement, the<br />
Budget, and in the Statement last week, we introduced programs to assist the<br />
unemployed, and to get a level of growth in the economy which alone will substantially<br />
reduce the number of those out of work.<br />
We got growth last year. Not enough, but more than virtually any other OECD country,<br />
and the consensus of international forecasters in the Economist ast week was that we<br />
would grow faster than virtually any other in the next year.<br />
That is cause for hope. We're going to put all our efforts in the next three years to getting<br />
that number down: to creating employment, and training people for jobs.<br />
Unemployment is a matter of immense regret. But it won't be solved by mere<br />
incantations of sentiment, or by the recital of hollow promises and so called " plans".<br />
What the exports numbers, and the manufacturing output numbers, and the workplace<br />
reform numbers, and the disputes and inflation numbers are telling us is that we are<br />
heading the right way.<br />
If we can accelerate the growth we will beat unemployment. This is the only way we will<br />
do it: This, and by continuing attention to education and training to labour market<br />
programs and by a sure knowledge understanding of where we are going, and faith in<br />
our ability to get there.<br />
The last thing we need, and the last thing that is justified, is a counsel of despair.<br />
We are heading the right way, and if we keep going we can finish up with a country that<br />
is not only a wonderful place to live, not only a good place to bring up kids, not only a<br />
fair and decent and democratic society, but also one of the most dynamic and successful<br />
economies in the world.<br />
The Best Practice program run by Peter Cook and his Department provides outstanding<br />
examples of the progress we are making and the reason why Australians should believe in<br />
their capacity to succeed.<br />
The Best Practice program is a way of giving recognition to companies that are doing<br />
good things, so that other companies can learn by their example. 6293 </p>
<p>The program selects the best in management, industrial relations, and performance.<br />
There are some outstanding examples. In 1985, the Australian Newsprint Mills plant at<br />
Boyer was about to close. But management and the employees worked together on a plan<br />
to turn the mill around.<br />
Today productivity has improved by around 25 per cent and the mill is fast becoming<br />
internationally competitive.<br />
Then there is the paint maker, Dulux, at its Clayton in Victoria. Its reform program has<br />
included installing leading edge technology, a Total Quality Management program, selfmanaged<br />
work teams, extensive training and development programs and workplace<br />
agreements which also guarantee employee participation in raising productivity.<br />
As a result the proportion of orders delivered in full and on time has more than doubled<br />
from 43 per cent to 95 per cent over the last three years, process time per batch of paint<br />
has been cut by more than one third, and productivity is up by one quarter.<br />
Other companies have chosen international benchmarking comparing their plant's<br />
performance against the best plants in the world.<br />
Australia's largest manufacturer of prefabricated timber wall frames and roof trusses,<br />
Sterlands Pty Ud, benchmarked against Japanese standards.<br />
It has cut its re-work costs by one third at its Gosford plant, and improved productivity<br />
by 15 per cent. A few months ago they recorded their highest single months sales figure<br />
in the 74 year history of the company.<br />
Mobil's petroleum refinery in Adelaide was so successful in benchmarking it has now<br />
become a benchmark itself for plants in the US and France.<br />
Theme are countless examples throughout Australia of the quiet revolution that is<br />
transforming our workplaces, our industrial structure and our exports.<br />
A recent report of McKinsey and Company paints an extraordinary picture of 700<br />
brilliantly successful small to medium sized Australian businesses. 700 companies<br />
exporting to the tune of $ 8.6 billion per annum, and growing at a rate which will double<br />
that figure in five years.<br />
Of course there is always a close link between improving the industrial processes and<br />
improving industrial relations. In the end the employees have to be willing participants<br />
in reform or it just won't work.<br />
An example is Sheraton Pacific Hotels which reached a workplace agreement for its<br />
Sheraton Towers Southgate Hotel in Melbourne which is a model for the entire tourist<br />
G) 2 9I4 </p>
<p>industry. It showed you could have a flexibility and productivity improvements by<br />
employees and management working together to rearrange the award conditions.<br />
These companies are showing the way: employees and employers jointly seeking<br />
productivity improvements and sharing their value.<br />
It is no accident that the question of industrial relations will be crucial in the forthcoming<br />
election. It will be crucial in determining our future success and prosperity; because the quality of<br />
industrial relations is becoming much more important as the whole world shifts to new<br />
patterns of production and trade.<br />
Today competitiveness and the wealth of nations is not determined so much by the<br />
amount of capital or technology a country possesses, since they are both very easily<br />
transferred. It is not determined so much by the amount of raw resources a country possesses, since<br />
these are widely available and relatively cheap.<br />
It is determined more and more by the quality of the workforce by the basic education,<br />
the training, the skills, the flexibility and adaptability of employees, and the quality of the<br />
relationships between employers and employees.<br />
These are things we can't borrow, can't buy, can't import, can't dig up.<br />
We have to create wealth together, Government and the people.<br />
And this is an area in which we are becoming stronger.<br />
For a decade we have run an Accord with the ACTU which now has as its fundamental<br />
basis the idea that wages increases will be consistent with staying competitive against our<br />
trade partners.<br />
In the Accord we talk the issues through, so that we know the problems employees face,<br />
and union representatives know the problems of governments.<br />
There is now less reason for industrial disputes.<br />
There is more understanding that we are all better off as inflation comes down.<br />
There is more confidence that all Australians can benefit from change, and that one group<br />
won't be able to rip off the benefit for itself.<br />
Under the Accord enterprise bargaining is becoming the centrepiece of industrial<br />
relations. 6295 </p>
<p>Over 700 agreements is a good start, but it's only a start. In coming years we want all but<br />
a small fraction of the workforce covered by enterprise-related agreements.<br />
We want to see the agreements becoming more and more comprehensive.<br />
We want to see most decisions about wages and work arrangements made at the<br />
workplace level between employers, and employees and their representatives.<br />
We want to see a situation in which the Industrial Relations Commission continues with a<br />
valuable role in settling disputes in conciliating, in deciding housekeeping issues like<br />
union coverage, and in keeping in good repair the safety net of award minimums over<br />
which bargaining will take place but making few and fewer decisions about actual<br />
wages for most people.<br />
You notice that I mention a safety net of awards and a role for the Industrial Relations<br />
commission and a role for employees representatives unions.<br />
These make a very important distinction between the track we are on, and the track the<br />
Opposition wants to take.<br />
Their commitment is to the complete abolition of awards.<br />
But these awards are the safety net which assure employees that bargains can be made in<br />
good faith, and in the knowledge that they can't be ripped off.<br />
The Opposition not only wants to cancel awards.<br />
When the award is abolished they will declare that each and every employee formerly<br />
covered by an award is now covered by an individual contract.<br />
The employees won't have any say in that.<br />
They will wake up one morning, and they will no longer be on an award.<br />
Each individual will be on an individual contract with the boss. If they don't like the<br />
contract, or don't like any changes the boss wants to make in it, they can take the sack.<br />
Under these common law contracts there is no such thing as unjust dismissal.<br />
If you got a day's pay or a week's pay with your dismissal notice, that's it that's the<br />
beginning and end of an employer's obligation.<br />
I see today Dr Hewson saying that the system he proposes " provides workers with the<br />
opportunity to get higher wages, more job security and more flexibility. It replaces the<br />
' them' and ' us' features of the present system with a togetherness approach", he says.<br />
6296 </p>
<p>Well, one could take pleasure in this, I suppose: to have one's opponents at last see the<br />
light one has been shining for a decade.<br />
If only there was reason to think that they believe it.<br />
But, in fact, this willingness on the part of the Opposition to use language which<br />
completely contradicts the substance of their ideology and their policies really should be<br />
exposed for the shallow deceit that it is.<br />
As far as industrial relations is concerned, there is perhaps no more effective antidote than<br />
the simple memory of Jeff Kennett's pre-election cant in Victoria.<br />
The Opposition system is not set up to reach collective agreements between the employer<br />
and all the employees at a workplace, but to switch instead to individual contracts.<br />
It is not work place bargaining. It's all one way. And if it's all one way, we lose the<br />
participation the incentives to work together collectively which alone can transform<br />
the work place.<br />
I think that is the wrong track the low wage track, the track which belittles Australians<br />
in their working lives.<br />
But the best industrial relations in the world is not enough to guarantee our<br />
competitiveness and our success in coming decades.<br />
If we are to have the best trained and most competitive workforce in the most competitive<br />
region in the world we need to do a lot more.<br />
We also need strong, active and determined Government.<br />
We need to keep up the effort on education, training and retraining and that's what we<br />
are doing.<br />
WVe need assured and affordable child care so that we can fully use the accumulated skills<br />
and experience of women in the workforce and that's what we are providing.<br />
That's why we will introduce a 30 per cent rebate of child care fees for working parents,<br />
in addition to the fees we already pay for working parents on low incomes.<br />
We need strong basic science and research and development to continue enhancing our<br />
productivity and facilitating the change in our industrial structure.<br />
We are doing that too, and given that last year Australia recorded the highest growth rate<br />
in business research and development spending in the OECD over the last decade, so is<br />
Australian business. 6297 </p>
<p>We need to give companies the financial incentives to save, invest and innovate and we<br />
are doing that with our investment tax credits and the big cut in company tax we<br />
announced last week.<br />
This is the track which will strengthen our future as a high skill-high wage country.<br />
This is the track we want to be on over the next three years and the rest of the decade.<br />
There is no future in knocking down wages and conditions, or forcing employees to take<br />
the contract or take the sack; any more than there is a future in going into the drudge<br />
industries the rest of the world is leaving behind.<br />
And it doesn't make these policies any more desirable to couch them in the language of<br />
" togetherness"<br />
I do not believe that a fifteen per cent tax on water, gas, electricity and phone bills, a<br />
fifteen per cent tax on rail fares and bus fares and taxi fares, a fifteen per cent tax on<br />
motels and hotels and meals out, a fifteen per cent tax on swimming lessons for our<br />
children and on meals from their tuckshop, a fifteen per cent tax on shoes and clothes and<br />
haircuts, on books, pens and pencils, a fifteen per cent tax on paint and wallpaper and<br />
timber and building materials, a fifteen per cent tax on hamburgers and piza and<br />
milkshakes, a fifteen per cent tax on everything in the shops except food on<br />
toothbrushes, tissues, tampons, talcum powder, nappies I fail to see how this will bring<br />
us together at all.<br />
Dr Hewson's GST threatens our inflation performance. It is unfair. It won't help create<br />
jobs. The accounting nightmare it involves won't help small business either.<br />
Nor do I think wrecking Medicare will help bring us together.<br />
The Coalition Health Policy has been written by the doctors, for the doctors.<br />
If Dr Hewson were to be elected he would put us on the road to a US-style health system.<br />
We have a system where everyone is assured of high quality health care on the basis of<br />
medical need and where 70 per cent of visits to the doctor are free to the patient. The<br />
entire system costs 8 per cent of GDP.<br />
The US system has none of the universal benefits and costs 15 per cent of GDP.<br />
There was a New YorkTime story the Other day which described how a man went to jail<br />
for seven months in Louisiana because his friend falsely claimed he had private medical<br />
insurance to get him into casualty in hospital. His friend had a crushed vertebrae. He got<br />
a bill for S41,000 which the insurer wouldn't pay. His friend went to jail too, because he<br />
gave the injured man his insurance card.<br />
6298 </p>
<p>I don't think anyone wants to see a health system of this kind in Australia, and I think it is<br />
a very good thing that President Clinton is determined to adopt a different system one<br />
more like our own.<br />
I do not believe a US style health system will help togetherness one bit. don't believe it<br />
will make us stronger or give us a greater sense of common purpose.<br />
I don't believe scrapping our award system and putting every employee in this country on<br />
an individual contract will serve this purpose either.<br />
We are showing now with enterprise bargains that we can make the system extremely<br />
flexible; it can give us productivity gains, and give them along with most wages<br />
increases through negotiations workplace by workplace.<br />
Not only is there no economic gain in the Opposition alternative there is a great'social<br />
loss. There is a price which one day must be paid. When employees know that they either take<br />
the contract or take the sack, their dignity as well as their livelihood is threatened. They<br />
arc belittled.<br />
Far from the spirit of togetherness which Dr Hewson has recently begun to extol, we will<br />
have the rancour and Iconflict of a decade ago.<br />
Far from speeding the transformation of our workplaces, the process will be derailed.<br />
Far from advancing the cause of Australia, these policies will stall it. We Will go<br />
backwards. These policies were tried in other countries in the eighties and from that experience there<br />
can be no mistake: they will change the character of Australia in ways which are hostile<br />
to human dignity and entirely alien to our traditions of fairness and equity.<br />
These three things, these three promises of the Opposition a 15 per cent tax on goods<br />
and services, scrapping Medicare, and scrapping awards to put everyone on individual<br />
contracts, are their kapolicies.<br />
They are the solutions ( hey offer to our problems.<br />
The Opposition is saying: we don't have any brilliant ideas on how to help our trade<br />
performance or reduce unemployment and foreign debt, but, I'll tell you what, we'll give<br />
you a 15 per cent tax on goods and services, we'll scrap your awards, and we'll scrap your<br />
universal health system.<br />
These are their brilliant ideas to impose a GST, scrap awards and scrap Medicare. 6299 </p>
<p>11<br />
Thecn, they say, everything will be tine. These policies are not peripheral or additional to<br />
their so-called " plan". They are the " plan".<br />
[ f employees resist the impact of the 15 per cent goods and services tax on their wages,<br />
we stand to lose over the next decade all the increased competitiveness we have acquired<br />
over the last few years.<br />
If we eliminate Medicare and the award system and impose a 15 per cent tax on goods<br />
and services, what do we expect will happen to wages and inflation?<br />
Certainly, sonmc wages and benefits will be cut. Many women will be worse off. Service<br />
workers will be worse off. Young people will be worse off.<br />
But in the factories and mines and construction projects of this country you will see<br />
industrial war.<br />
I can't think of a worse mix, a more lethal combination for this economy and for our<br />
success in trade than to whack on a 15 per cent goods and services tax, cancel awards and<br />
scrap Medicare, and at the same time cut the Reserve Bank loose and tell it to forget<br />
everything else except keeping inflation under 2 per cent.<br />
But even more fundamentally, policies of this kind put at risk the whole basis of<br />
consensus and cooperation which has allowed us to successfully and radically restructure<br />
ourselves. It remains to say the most important thing of all: and that is congratulations<br />
congratulations to all of you who have been involved in the development of Best Practice<br />
in Australia, and particularly to those companies who have committed themselves to Best<br />
Practice. You are the pioneers of the new Australia. What you do is both the wellspring and the<br />
measure of our achievement and our hope.<br />
So I congratulate you all I know you will keep up the good work and please let no<br />
one halt our progress.<br />
Thank you.<br />
