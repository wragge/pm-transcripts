TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING, MP<br />
ADDRESS AT THE LAUNCH OF THE ENCYCLOPAEDIA OF ABORIGINAL<br />
AUSTRALIA, PARLIAMENT HOUSE, 20 JUNE 1994<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
Well, thank you very much, Robert ( Tickner), Dr Bill Jonas and David Horton,<br />
the Chair person of ATSIC, Lois O'Donoghue, and ladies and gentlemen.<br />
Well, I am very grateful for the opportunity to launch these volumes today, to<br />
be asked to launch this massive work, six years I am told in the collation and<br />
the writing. And I know it has been very eagerly awaited. It is very<br />
comprehensive work, covering a vast canvas of infinite complexity and I think<br />
it will provide all Australians, that is Aboriginal and non-aboriginal Australians<br />
alike, with an invaluable source of information and understanding. And it<br />
struck me looking through it, it will be particularly useful for young<br />
Australians, and for the teaching of Aboriginal history in Australian schools,<br />
for both teachers and pupils alike, to be able to refer to such a<br />
comprehensive work and define something useful there in such a readable,<br />
digestible way. It should play a useful role in helping future generations to<br />
comprehend the extraordinary history and culture of the oldest continuing<br />
civilisation on earth.<br />
It wasn't so many years ago that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people<br />
were specimens of great anthropological curiosity, but little more as human<br />
beings living in the modern world, they were until 1967, of course, in this<br />
country not even citizens of Australia. And that is not that long ago, that's<br />
only two years before I entered the national Parliament. This country did not<br />
recognise the descendants of the original Australians as citizens. This<br />
encyclopaedia examines that referendum. It should also be made<br />
compulsory reading for some politicians, current ones, so they can see how<br />
far they have wandered from the ideals of their predecessors. Maybe some<br />
extracts and photocopies spread around might be the order. I don't think they<br />
understand the vast majority of the Australian people gave the<br />
Commonwealth the power to make laws for indigenous Australians where<br />
they were deemed necessary. </p>
<p>But, it not only looks at the referendum, it looks at the struggle for recognition,<br />
and that which preceded it, the contribution that Aboriginal people have made<br />
in that field, as in so many others, It also has a lot of interesting names of<br />
Aboriginal people who have made a great contribution, and are well known to<br />
their compatriots and it gives them, I think, the recognition they deserve. And<br />
many of the references, are of course, in our epoch, in our time scale. And I<br />
was pleased to see Lois O'Donoghue mentioned there, and I read her<br />
reference, nothing in it could have said how much leadership she provided<br />
when it really mattered to one of the great leaps forward in the recognition of<br />
the rights of Aboriginal Australians and their right to land in this country.<br />
And while the encyclopaedia refers to the native title decision of the High<br />
Court it hasn't understandably yet referred to the Act because of the cut-off<br />
point for publication, but not only the change in the statutory basis on which<br />
such claims for land can be made came from all that, what came from it was,<br />
I think, also something that needs to be put into the encyclopaedia under T,<br />
and that's the word trust. Because I think a lot of trust, something very<br />
ephemeral, difficult to get your hands on, very hard to develop, easy to<br />
destroy, but terribly important to the way in which things are done. And what<br />
happened during 1993 was the development of a lot of trust. Firstly between<br />
Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people themselves, and the fact that<br />
there was something of great moment happening, brought them together,<br />
perhaps as never before, to sit down and negotiate with the Government of<br />
Australia. As I am sure in a negotiation, never had such a discussion of such<br />
significance taken place in the past. In one of the meetings I had with Lois I<br />
stung her by saying that Aboriginal people don't know how to negotiate. And<br />
I said it because I believed it to be true, hoping that they would involve<br />
themselves in the process of negotiation, where you understand what your<br />
core interests are, and you understand what the other persons core interests<br />
are, and you try and negotiate a position that settles both. And by taking up<br />
the leadership of this issue, and providing that the Aboriginal community Lois<br />
brought together, as you know, that group of people who probably never sat<br />
down quite in the same way before and discussed something of such moment<br />
as then.<br />
And a lot of people who are not mentioned in the encyclopaedia, but ought to<br />
be in the future, emerged in whom I have great faith about the future of<br />
Aboriginal people in this country and their leadership, Marcia Langton is one<br />
of them, she is here today. Young people, who really, really started to turn it<br />
before, with Noel Pearson another, David Ross another, and there are many,<br />
many examples. And these will have, I think, an interesting sprinkled position<br />
throughout the encyclopaedia for their contribution in ushering in a new order<br />
of trust between Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people themselves.<br />
And we saw this repeated again just last week in our discussions on the land<br />
fund, and certainly a new order of trust between the Aboriginal and Torres-<br />
Strait Islander people and the Government of Australia. Because I think<br />
when the Mabo battle really started to heat up Aboriginal people kept coming<br />
back to the Government, " is it still all right, are they still right". A couple of<br />
weeks later it got hotter, " still ok". " Still ok". And it went on to the point where </p>
<p>3<br />
as the problems became more stronger we saw these things being negotiated<br />
around so we could comprehend the problems.<br />
I am speaking, perhaps, inordinately long about this, because I think it is such<br />
an epic period between the relationship between Aboriginal and Torres Strait<br />
Islander people and non-aboriginal people in this country, in this very<br />
important epoch that just passed.<br />
So, we have seen periods of change in respect of the Aboriginal community<br />
and its relationship with the nation, if you like, and the Parliament run through<br />
high and low points, and we saw periods in the last, certainly since the<br />
referendum, when a lot of hope has been dissipated, and a lot of spirit has<br />
fallen away to see it come back and flourish again. I hope we can capture<br />
some of this in the encyclopaedia in later editions as it comes along.<br />
The important thing is in the reading of this anybody seeking out the<br />
references can start to pin point things and events and times and places of<br />
significance to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, that's not in any<br />
written history because no written history ever existed. And so they're little<br />
snapshots, pieces of the matrix that can let both Aboriginal and nonaboriginal<br />
people work out what the story is. That, I think, is its great value.<br />
And it is such a quick and handy reference, but across such a very large<br />
scale. It is a mighty piece of work, and David Horton deserves the greatest<br />
congratulations for the undertaking, he has also assembled an array of<br />
excellent contributors to match that vision with Ian Howie-Willis and Dallas<br />
De Brabander featuring most prominently, but of course there are many<br />
others. I would also like to congratulate the Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait<br />
Islander Studies headed by Marcia Langton and Bill Jonas for their<br />
commitment to this massive project. It is a great job of work, well done, and<br />
well undertaken, and I hope it becomes one of our long run best sellers. It is<br />
out there and people have it in our schools and at home and to make that<br />
when they have the thought, or they want to know something, that they go<br />
and they find a quick reference to it, but a comprehensive and readable one.<br />
Congratulations to all concerned, I look forward to this huge work in its later<br />
editions for some of the matters I mention, but I think all of us stand in some<br />
awe at the amount of time and effort that has gone into this, and appreciate<br />
ever so much the great initiative and the work which everyone has<br />
undertaken in bringing it to fruition. It is with very great pleasure that I launch<br />
this important publication, these two very special volumes.<br />
Thank you. </p>
