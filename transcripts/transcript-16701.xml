    <content><![CDATA[<p>PM:It's great to be back in Mackay, and great to be at this great Queensland state school. It's pretty interesting when you look at the foundation stones here that this school was opened by Forgan Smith in 1933, and if you look carefully at the school, you have to form the conclusion that not a lot's been added to it since.</p>
<p>We are about to make additions, and we are about to make a difference through the Building the Education Revolution investment. And this school here, which has nearly 200 young Queenslanders here attending the primary school, will now have an additional $1 million investment which is going to create a state-of-the-art resources centre  -  over there  -  and on top of that build a multipurpose hall so that the children of the school can gather together for their school activities.</p>
<p>This is an important enhancement to what this school is able to do for these precious, young Australian minds.</p>
<p>So we're proud of the fact that the investments of the Australian Government are making it possible for these kids, at this state school, to have greater education opportunities for the future.</p>
<p>Of course, I've just spoken now about Mackay Central Primary School. If you look across the Mackay region itself, the Australian Government is investing nearly $100 million in school modernisation now. We're investing $78.6 million in 67 school projects under our Primary Schools for the 21st Century program. On top of that, some $10 million for 176 refurbishment projects in 73 Mackay schools under the National School Pride Program, and on top of that again, $7 million for investment in science and language centres at five schools under the Science and Language Centres Program.</p>
<p>Put that together, that's nearly $100 million worth of investment in schools in this region. And when we look back in the years to come, I hope we'll all be able to conclude that these have been investments which have enhanced the education opportunities of all the kids, all the young people, all the young Queenslanders, the young Australians, who are attending these schools.</p>
<p>The other good thing is this  -  having just spoken to the workers on site, most of those workers out there are from Mackay. We've got an economic downturn at present across the nation, caused by the global economic recession. And by us stepping up to the plate with this $100 million investment we're finding that local jobs are being created for local tradesmen and local companies to help them through this difficult time.</p>
<p>The company I've just spoken to out here has got some four school projects underway as part of the overall program in this region. That company, I think, has nearly $8 million or $9 million worth of projects. Look at the number of tradesmen working on each project. The number of tradies every day on this project, I'm advised there'll be about 15 different sets of trades, 50 sets of trades all up being deployed in one school project like this. Put them all together, $100 million worth of investment, it does help the economy on the way through at a difficult time.</p>
<p>The last thing I'd say for the benefit of our local friends here in Mackay is a comment that I made yesterday about the Mackay Stadium project. The Mayor and I have been discussing it. I simply affirm today what I have already said to the Mayor  -  this Government honours its election commitments. This stadium project will proceed, it will be completed, and the $8 million we committed to prior to the election will be delivered. We intend to be with the Mayor when we turn the sod on this project towards the end of the year.</p>
<p>Do you want to add to that, Col? </p>
<p>MAYOR:No, I said - Prime Minister, thank-you very much, because it is great to know that this stadium is going - and we've talked last night  -  that it's full steam ahead. But MR Prime Minister, on behalf of all these young children over here, I'd like to thank you for visiting their school. Because the Year Sevens today, when you went into their room, that will be a treat that they'll never forget. And I think that it's special for them, it will be special for the rest of their lives. But on behalf of the Mackay region, thank-you very much for coming today. And on behalf of all your  -  this is probably the biggest press conference you've had for a while, Prime Minister, so thank-you very much for coming.</p>
<p>(Applause) </p>
<p>PM:This is the first press conference I've been where people have applauded, by the way. (Laughter) You ladies and gentlemen of the press should pay attention to that. Over to you, folks. Ask away. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST:Do you mind if I ask on some national issues? </p>
<p>PM:Yeah, sure. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST:When it comes to climate change (inaudible) in the opposition over what they want to do with the emissions trading scheme. Is it now inevitable that it won't get through the Senate come August? </p>
<p>PM:The Australian national economic interest and environment interest is for the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme to pass the Senate. It's part of us preparing for a new era for the future, which is being dictated by climate change. It's part of us doing our bit for the planet, so that other countries, other bigger emitting countries do their bit. It's also part of our acting so that we don't cop environmental tariffs against us in the future. These are the reasons why we're acting. </p>
<p>Secondly, the national interest dictates that all people of good will support the legislation which is in the Parliament. The Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme has been negotiated intensively with industry groups, environmental groups, right across the country over a long period of time. </p>
<p>The disappointing thing is this - we need national leadership to ensure that this legislation passes the Senate. Instead, what we have on the part of the Opposition is Senator Minchin speaking for Malcolm Turnbull. Today we have Tony Abbott speaking for Malcolm Turnbull. But we don't have Malcolm Turnbull speaking for Malcolm Turnbull. </p>
<p>It's time that we actually got fair dinkum about this, and found out exactly what Mr Turnbull plans to do. </p>
<p>Senator Minchin seems to be saying the “the Coalition will oppose this”. Mr Abbott today says “the Coalition will support this”. Mr Turnbull's position is, I don't really know. </p>
<p>But you know, this is not just a political game. It's serious stuff about what will happen in the Senate with the passage of this legislation, and it lies within the hands of the Liberal and National parties, that's why it's so serious.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:They seem petrified of a double dissolution, have you got them over a barrel? </p>
<p>PM:Look the national interest, the national economic and environmental interest, requires national leadership on difficult and hard questions like this. Governments around the world are wrestling with this, it's not easy, it's hard. But the alternative to national leadership is this almost terminal position which we see in the ranks of the Liberal and National parties where they are splitting every which way on climate change. </p>
<p>Australia deserves better than a fundamentally divided political party which can't make up its mind on climate change. </p>
<p>The science is in, it's happening. Responsible Governments around the world are responding. Australia must respond. The Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme is part of that response, but regrettably, in the Senate, we have a Coalition split right down the middle. </p>
<p>  JOURNALIST:Can I ask you on family law, have the arrangements for child custody, the emphasis on giving access to both parents as the highest priority, is that the wrong balance when it comes to child custody matters?</p>
<p>PM:Our responsibility as a Government is to do everything humanly and legally possible to protect children. To protect children. That's our first responsibility. Everything humanly, and physically, and legally possible to protect children from violence. We, therefore as a Government, will be taking every necessary decision to support that objective.</p>
<p>There's too much violence in our community. There's too much violence towards children. It's unacceptable. And therefore, the nation has to lift its game. The nation has to do better. </p>
<p>And I support therefore the initiatives being put forward by the Attorney-General. We'll need to take this debate through the community, and in consultation with the States and Territories. But our overriding mission is this: how do we do better as a country to protect children, to protect our kids, from violence? </p>
<p>JOURNALIST:Do you agree with the comments from Martin Ferguson that some Greens have been too focussed on unproven renewable technologies and there needs to be more support for resources such as liquid natural gas?</p>
<p>PM:As far as our energy policy for the future is concerned, Mr Ferguson is doing a great job, and particularly in developing an Energy White Paper for Australia, and a national energy security strategy for Australia. And that embraces a whole range of energy options.</p>
<p>The future of coal, we're acting in terms of carbon capture and storage. The future of the renewable energy sector, in solar, the Government will be supporting the single largest solar generation project in the world, 1000 megawatts, in the initiatives contained within the Budget, other renewable energy sources as well. </p>
<p>We believe we've got to proceed on all these fronts at once, and that is precisely what the Minister, Martin Ferguson has advocated through multiple policy statements to the Parliament and elsewhere. Okay folks, I've got to zip, got to go to the airport, got to go to Brisbane, got to go give a speech.</p>
