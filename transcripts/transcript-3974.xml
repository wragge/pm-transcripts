MR FRASER ON ' 4 CORNERS' SATURDAY, 15 NOVEMBER 1975.<br />
I QUESTION: Mr Fraser if Senator Milliner had been replaced by a<br />
Whitlam supporter would you be Caretaker Prime Minister today?<br />
MR FRASER: They would have had to then reject the Budget instead of<br />
just deferring it. Having one more number than the Labor Party could<br />
muster left us with an advantage because we could defer the Budget, and<br />
the reason we took that choice was because I was fearful that if it<br />
had been rejected Mr Whitlam would have left it rejected until after<br />
an election was over. And that would have caused a lot of hardship to<br />
a lot of individuals.<br />
QUESTION: At the risk of going through some boring mathematics, the<br />
figures would have been in the Senate 28 Labor-if Senator Milliner<br />
had been replaced with a Whitlam supporter, it would have been 28 Labor,<br />
2 independents and 30 Opposition Senators. It would<br />
have been deadlocked. Now would you've been able to reject Supply or<br />
defer Supply given thz~ se numbers?<br />
MR FRASER: With 30, which is half, we could reject it because a tied<br />
vote that way rejects it.<br />
QUESTION: But it was ; Tite clear a number of your Senators, of Oppositi<br />
Senators weren't prepared to take that step of rejection.<br />
MR FRASER: Well, we ne7er discussed it. Because it was a much<br />
preferable choice to defer it.<br />
QUESTION: But Senator Bessell, for example, made it quite clear he<br />
would never reject Supply. He felt that it was wrong in principle.<br />
MR FRASER: Oh, well a statement was made; he made another statenient<br />
later the same day or the next day. Now we never discussed it. Th i[<br />
Senator Bessell was seeking to do was say he supported the decison<br />
that we had taken. And that's what he said. -The deci,-t. ' i<br />
was to defer and it was a better decision because it left it in our<br />
hands to reinstate the Appropriation Bills once we knew there would<br />
be a House of Representatives election. i745I </p>
<p>QUESTION: ' To pursue the point though. If you had been unable to<br />
reject Supply because of splits within your own ranks,., then it is<br />
true to say that Senator Milliner'Is death has given rise to you being<br />
Caretaker Prime Minister?<br />
MR FRASER: Oh, but there's a great, great big ! if'there. Now one of<br />
the things that the Labor Party was banking on, over the last 3 or 4<br />
weeks, there'd be a split from this person, a split from that personO<br />
they were busy feeding out rumors out of Mr Whitlam's of fice. Now,.<br />
there was never anything in it; we were rock solid, from start to<br />
finish. QUESTION: In March of this year, you said that democracy rests much<br />
more on adherence to convention than to the rigid application of rules<br />
and laws. Now I wonder how you regard the Convention of replacing a<br />
dead Labor Senator with a man of the same political complexion?<br />
MR FRASER: Oh look, I've made my view on that quite plain. There's<br />
no secret ' about I believe that if somebody dies or retires from<br />
ill health he ought to be replaced by somebody from the same political<br />
Party. QUESTION: He wasn't in this case, was he?<br />
MR FRASER: If there is an appointment made of political purposes to<br />
an Ambassadorship or a High Court, then I think it might be a different<br />
Smatter. Look, I made my view about that known at the time, there's<br />
no secret of that.<br />
QUESTION: Could we take. another issue then of Convention. It seems to<br />
me that it's a fairly well known Convention that a Prime Minister<br />
resigns when he . no longer has the confidence of the House of Representatives.<br />
Why didn't you resign on Tuesday?<br />
MR FRASER: Well that's precisely what happened., because I reconmu'-n( 1nd<br />
to the Governor-General, a double dissol~ ution of the Parliament, and<br />
a double dissolution on the most favourable terms possible to the<br />
Australian Labor Party. Because I don't think that it is generally note<br />
that* the 21 Bills that were in a double dissolution position, most of<br />
which are anathema to us, we hate the thought of nearly all of them, </p>
<p>3<br />
are cited in the double dissolution document and if by some mischance<br />
Labor happens to win on December 13, all those Bills would be in a<br />
position to be put through, either if they controlled both Houses<br />
or through a Joint Sitting. And I think that was having a dissolution<br />
of the Parliament on the most favourable terms to the Labor Party.<br />
QUESTION: Could we go back to the timing of the events though.<br />
Mr Whitlam was dismissed-you were appointed Caretaker Prime Minister,<br />
a matter of minutes later there was a vote of no confidence in you in<br />
the House of Representatives. Wasn't it then your duty to go to the<br />
Governor-General and say," I must resign, I no longer have the confidence<br />
of the House."<br />
MR FRASER: I went to the Governor-General and recommended a double<br />
dissolution because the Appropriation Bills were through and that was<br />
O the appropriate course. Look) when a Prime Minister loses the<br />
confidence of the Parliament, or when a Prime Minister can't get a<br />
Money Bill,-his Appropriation through the Parliament, the tradition<br />
of all of our Parliaz. entary practice, and of hundreds of years in the<br />
United Kingdom, is that that Prime Minister then immediately goes and<br />
recommends an election. He fights that election as Prime Minister.<br />
If Mr Whitlam had done what he ought to have done as soon as the<br />
Appropriation Bills were deferred, he would have been fighting this<br />
O eleciton as Prime Minister. But he chose to take a course.<br />
QUESTION: Mr Whitlam claims that he was never told that he would be<br />
O dismissed. Sir John Kerr never made it clear to him that he would be<br />
dismissed. MR FRASER: Oh look, Lr WThitlam had said in public, I don't know how<br />
many times~ he'd said it in private to me in that meeting we'd had<br />
on Tuesday morning and if you read the substance of the letter that<br />
Sir John Kerr wrote to Mr Whitlam, he must have said it to Sir J6T: r Ycrx<br />
on a number of occasions.<br />
QUESTION: He must have said to Mr Whitlam on a number of occasions?<br />
MR FRASER: No, Mr ' Thitlam must have said it to Sir John Ferr. If you<br />
read the letter, that Sir John Kerr wrote to Mr Whitlam he must have </p>
<p>said on a number.., but he'd done it in public. Held done it to me'<br />
in private. But no matter what'happened in the Parliamrent he would never<br />
recommend an election for the House of Representatives. Now that's<br />
leaving the Governor-General with no choice except to do what Sir John<br />
Kerr did.<br />
QUESTION: When Sir John Kerr sacked Mr Whitlam did he know that you<br />
would accept a commission to become Prime Minister?<br />
MR FRASER: Urn, The normal course for a Queen or for the Queen's<br />
representatives is to go to somebody else and see, you know, can<br />
you form a Gover2ament.. In this case, could you get the Appropriation<br />
Bills through the Parliament?<br />
QUESTION: What I'm trying to get at is, when did he ask you whether<br />
in fact you could -form a Government? After he'd dismissed Mr Whitlem?<br />
MR FRASER: After he'd seen Mr Whitlam.<br />
QUESTION: So at that stage Australia was without a Prime Minister<br />
and he wasn't sure whe-ther you would accept the commission?<br />
MR FRASER: Well I : Laagine he would have thought that I would. I<br />
could get the Appropriation Bills through the Parliament, but I wou ld<br />
also imagine that he would have thought I would do as I did do and<br />
that's to recommend L--diately a double dissolution, an election.<br />
so that the people of Australia could decide. Because our whole<br />
fight right from the very beginning was not power for ourselves, it<br />
was to give the people of Australia the right to decide; the right<br />
to vote. And democracy is only under threat when you have a political<br />
leader determined to deny that right to the average people in the<br />
community.<br />
QUESTION: Was that not though, Mr Fraser, a vice-regal pune-. Tlv. re<br />
was a serious risk that you may not have accepted the new C0Trnnj.-ir-rn<br />
and that Australia would have been without a Prime Minister?<br />
MR FRASER: He had a duty to do and I would have thought that he'd<br />
regard it as my duty to do what in fact I did. I wouldn't have thought<br />
that was a punt at all. </p>
<p>' WUESTION: But he didn't discuss it with you in advance as to whelh<br />
you would accept the commission under those circumstances, until you<br />
actually went into his office after he dismissed Mr Whitlam?<br />
MR FRASER: Well he didn't know what Mr Whitlam was going to do.<br />
QUESTION: Do you think that you have gained an electoral advantage,<br />
perhaps an unfair electoral advantagejby being Prime Minister with the<br />
election coming up?<br />
MR FRASER: Maybe there is an advantage, but if there is it's<br />
Mr Whitlam's fault because if he'd done what he ought to have done<br />
he would have been fighting this election as Prime Minister.<br />
QUESTION: If you are then conscious that it is an advantage, are<br />
you taking steps to make sure you don't abuse that advantage?<br />
O MR FRASER: ! ost certainly. And when we were in Government ifn the<br />
past we always did that.'<br />
QUESTION: What do you make then of the complaint by senior Treasury<br />
men yesterday, that L'r Lynch is asking them for information which<br />
they think is most unfair that they should supply to a Caretaker<br />
Government?<br />
0 MR. FRASER: Let's just look at this. Senior Treasury men are not too<br />
sure how senior, because a union official earlier today...<br />
0 QUESTION: There were 68 of them according to press reports.<br />
MR FRASER: I know: 68 out of 2 or 3 thousand in the Treasury.<br />
QUESTION: They were senior men apparently.<br />
MR FRASER: No, I think that's doubtful. But my Departmentmy<br />
Department, not me-drafted a minute in accordance with the undcrtak. ic<br />
given to the Governor-General. I made one or two very minor alterations<br />
to that minute which had the full agreement of the Department that<br />
went to all other Departments. I issued a public statement, also<br />
drafted by the Department-one or two minor alterations to that, agreed<br />
by the Department as being fully in accordance with the guidelines, </p>
<p>the commitment to the Governor-General. Now if any Permanent Head,"<br />
has any doubt about any instruction or request from a Minister<br />
they'll try and sort it out between them. If there's a doubt it<br />
should go to the Chairman of the Public Service Board, or to<br />
Mr Menadue or to myself and I would be interpreting those guidelines2<br />
that commitment very very strictly indeed, scrupulously and absolutely.<br />
QUESTION: In view of that protest though by Treasury mendo you think<br />
you'll be asking for less advice, less detailed advice, than you have<br />
over recent days?<br />
MR FRASER: No, no not at all because I'm quite certain that Mr Lynch<br />
has not asked for advice that he ought not to have. Now look, the<br />
commitment is not to make statutory appointments or dismissals, things<br />
that involve the Executive Council; not to change Labor policy; not<br />
to initiate-new pclicies; but obviously in administering Australia,<br />
which we must do as a Caretaker Government for a month at least, and<br />
what happens after that depends on a great many other people.-to bo<br />
able to do that ad_-inistering job properly we do need the advice, we<br />
do need the information that is available from the Public Service.<br />
And that advice and infomation will be available to us.<br />
QUESTION: You could be, of course, in a difficult position in that<br />
administrative capacity couldn't you? For example, say Britain<br />
devalued what sort cf decisions would you have to make? If you had<br />
to make quick decisions as Prime Minister, how limited are your powers?<br />
MR FRASER: Well if there was a major decision of that kind~ one of<br />
the first things that I'd do would be to consult the most senior people<br />
in the Public Service and if a very serious decision was required<br />
urgently on Australia's behalf I'd also consult with the Governor-Cener-<br />
But I would not go outside the guidelines, the commitment I gave to<br />
the Governor-General at all.<br />
QUESTION: You said also though that you would continue the policies<br />
of the previous Goverrnent in the caretaker role.<br />
MR FRASER: Well, that's part of the commitment -up til 13 December. </p>
<p>7<br />
iwill be obviously over<br />
the election period, advocating different policies, the sorts of<br />
policies that we believe are necessary to get Australia out of the<br />
economic mismanagement and decay which we find about us at the moment.<br />
QUESTION: It's a small point, I know. But at the UN fairly soon<br />
there's going to be a decision taken about the role of South Korea.<br />
Now in the past Australian's have Astained on that vote, a Soviet<br />
sponsored motion. You'll have to make a decision, I think, by Tuesday<br />
of this week how Australia's going to vote. How will we vote?<br />
MR FRASER: Well that's going to be very easy. Because Mr Harry, one<br />
of our representatives, ambassadors, announced Australia's vote in<br />
opposition to that particular resolution. I understand that unilaterallyl<br />
Mr Whitlam reversed that and made it an abstension. And I think it<br />
would be perfectly appropriate for us to stick with the earlier<br />
S aInnHroaur nrcye, d decwihsiicohn , w aasn notuon coepdp oosne btehhaatl fp arotf ictuhle arf orrmeesro lGuotvieornn. ment, by<br />
QuESTIoN: What about mcre frightening events perhaps events say<br />
in Timor, if there was any blow-up there of military trouble, what<br />
sort of decisions would you have to make there? Who would you consult?<br />
Would you ever consult Mr Whitlam?<br />
MR FRASER: Well I don't think that Mr Whitlam is a very consultative<br />
mood at the moment. But if a matter of major crisis occurred which<br />
required consultation with the Opposition I'd do it; of course I<br />
would. But I don't see a major blow-up in that area and what I'm<br />
saying is, that in a Caretaker capacity Australia will be well administered<br />
until December 13. And I hope very much it will be well governed<br />
after that.<br />
QUESTION: In the forthcoming election campaign, how important do you<br />
think the issue will be of whether Mr Whitlam was improperly dismissed?<br />
MR FRASER: I think the major issues will be the economic issues, thve<br />
decay, the disenchantment of three years, of three dark years of Labor.<br />
Because.. QUESTION: It wouldn't be unfair to suggest that you'd like the issues<br />
to be that, but perhapsdo you thinksthe body politic will take very </p>
<p>Briously the issue of whether in fact Mr Whitlam was improperly<br />
dismissed? MR FRASER: Well some might but we ll see that when the time comes.<br />
I believe that most people are going to be looking to the economic<br />
issues that nearly a quarter of a million school leavers are going to<br />
find it hard to get jobs. People from universities finding it hard<br />
to get jobs, small businesses going bankrupt, retired people being<br />
destroyed. These are the real issues before Australia; and theseare<br />
the real issues. The scandals were other things, but it was the<br />
economic issues that really led us to take the decision we did and<br />
that decision was a decision only to allow every Australian, over 18<br />
obviously, to put a piece of ballot paper in a ballot box. </p>
