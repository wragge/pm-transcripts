PRIME MINISTER<br />
A NEW YEAR MES SAGE<br />
Tomorrow is the 75th annivers ary of the establishment<br />
of the Commonwealth. It begins a year which we all<br />
. know will be economically difficult.<br />
If we are prepared to plan and work together I<br />

the challenges we face.<br />
The Government is determined to work for all Australians,<br />
as the servant of the people.<br />
' We want to build a better and more just society, in<br />
which the-re is concern for the less well of-, and in<br />
Which: individual and family ambitions can be achieved.<br />
The Government intends to be-one which helps people in<br />
time of trouble, and which helps individuals to be independent.<br />
. E wish all Australians, wherever they live and wherever<br />
they work, a happy and a prosperous New Year.<br />
