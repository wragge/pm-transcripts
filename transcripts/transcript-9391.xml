PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P. J. KEATING MP<br />
DOORSTOP, SYDNEY TOWN HALL, WEDNESDAY, 26 OCTOBER 1994<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
PM: Today's inflation rate of .6 per cent for the quarter and 1.9 per cent for<br />
the year, I think, indicates that Australian inflation is broadly in check.<br />
That we again, in an underlying sense, have an inflation rate at 2 or<br />
around 2 or under 2, this squares with the point I have been making<br />
and the Treasurer has been making that this is a long way from the 5<br />
6 per centage points of inflation which the bond markets have now<br />
factored into rates. So, as the country keeps producing low inflation<br />
rates, I think, people have got to accept the fact that Australia has<br />
changed its form. That is, that it has broken the back of inflation and it<br />
is capable of a low inflationary performance, though of course, that<br />
inflationary performance will always need to be monitored and worked<br />
on in this country as in other countries. But, what we have here is<br />
what a lot of other countries don't have and that is relative price<br />
stability and strong employment growth. Now, a lot of countries which<br />
have a premium only on price stability don't have employment growth.<br />
This is true in Europe and it is true of other countries which focus only<br />
on price stability. The trick is to get both and by the mix of policy we<br />
have I am happy to say that Australia has both. It has got a relatively<br />
strong rate of economic growth, 4 per cent employment growth and<br />
around 2 per cent inflation. This is a very magic mix, but we have got<br />
to keep working on it, be vigilant about it.<br />
J: On those growth rates, Prime Minister there seems to be a bit of a<br />
difference between yourself and Mr Willis<br />
PM: None what so ever. This is just a beat up from The Financial Review.<br />
It is not in any other newspaper and why should I bother with it,<br />
frankly.<br />
J: ( inaudible) the drought </p>
<p>2<br />
PM: The drought will obviously knocka' bit out of our GDP probably about<br />
half a percentage point over the course of the year and depending on<br />
how long the drought goes, of course, it can have broader implications<br />
for the country as a whole. The good thing is that the non-farm<br />
economy is performing strongly and, of course, there's low inflation.<br />
ends </p>
