PRIME MINISTER TUESDAY, 26 FEBRUARY, 1980<br />
From the Press Office lggqp L/<br />
SUMMARY OF ABC'S<br />
There are more allegations of police harrassment of<br />
Aborigines at West Australian polling booths. A group of<br />
Aborigines were allegedly taken from the Gooda Gooda Aboriginal<br />
community and questioned about who they were going to vote for.<br />
One of the community advisers, Tom Stevens, interviewed.<br />
He says police gathered up seven members of the Aboriginal<br />
community and took them to the police station.<br />
Queensland's record on civil rights, particularly for Aborigines,<br />
was attached last night by Liberal Senator Alan Missen. Alan Missen<br />
is Chairman of the Senate Committee on Constitutional and Legal<br />
Affairs. Addressing a meeting of the Civil Liberties Council<br />
in Brisbane, Senator Missen claimed that Aborigines in<br />
Queensland were often denied rights set down by international<br />
convention and agreed to by the Federal Government. Senator Missen<br />
interviewed. Doctors at" 2Pambula and Bega on the south coast of N. S. W. are on<br />
strike. They are refusing to treat uninsured or public patients<br />
because the State Government has reduced the fee for service<br />
payable at hospitals from 85% to 75% of the scheduled fee.<br />
The State Health Minister, Mr. Stewart, has attacked the strike,<br />
saying the doctors in the area have stood over people for years,<br />
forcing them to join private health funds. One of the doctors<br />
in Bega, Gordon Hudson, interviewed. N. S. W Minister for Health,<br />
Kevin Stewart, interviewed.<br />
Australia's stock markets will be tested in the next few days<br />
following yesterday's sudden drop in share prices. That is the<br />
view of the Vice-Chairman of the Australian Associated Stock<br />
Exchanges.. He says ithe drop can be explained by uncertainty<br />
about interest rates and it is not likely to lead to a serious<br />
market fall. Interviewed.<br />
President Carter is trying to prevent-any American athlete from<br />
going to the Moscow Olympic Games, but at the White House today<br />
he played host to 150 Olympians, members of the-American Winter<br />
Olympics team.. President* Carter hailed the 150 athletes. as<br />
heroes. He thanked the athletes on behalf of al-Americans.<br />
But the Americans are now facing a national boycott of the<br />
much-larger Summer Olympics. There was silence as President<br />
Carter asked for the same kind of patriotic fervour to support<br />
his measure against the Soviet Union.<br />
President Carter<br />
The Soviet invasion of Afghanistan has violated peace and<br />
the principles of the Olympics. And it has caused us to<br />
make a motion that the Olympics be moved or postponed this<br />
summer.<br />
Some of America's Winter athletes said they were opposed to a<br />
Moscow boycott. Most nodded, rather sadly, that they would go<br />
along with whatever their President decided in the interests of<br />
the country and world stability. If America's good feeling over<br />
these Winter Games was indeed unprecedented, it is largely because<br />
it may be the only international competition they are in this year.<br />
The plans for alternative Games are to be formally proposed at<br />
the White House very soon, but to most Americans that/ 2is a stop-gap. </p>
<p>2-<br />
The British Prime Minister, Mrs. Thatcher, is taking steps<br />
to try and ensure unity within her Conservative Party. After<br />
only nine months in office, she is faced with the prospect<br />
of a wide rift within the Party. Report from Mark Colvin in<br />
London. The Prime Minister is understood to have told her<br />
Cabinet colleagues that they have a collective responsibility<br />
for Government decision. They can argue about proposals before<br />
they are decided on,. but once Cabinet agreement has been reached<br />
members of-the Conservative Government are now being told to tow<br />
the Party line. A backbencher, Julian Critchley, interviewed.<br />
Said there are a number who are-anxious about the style of<br />
the Government and its direction.<br />
. Report from New York that-the latest in a series of attacks<br />
on policeman has prompted the Mayor to renew his call for<br />
the reintroduction of capital punishment.<br />
This year's. Academy Award nominations have-* just been released<br />
in Hollywood. The actual awards will be given on April 14.<br />
