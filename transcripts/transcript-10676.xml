<p> ANNOUNCER:</p>
<p>First though to the Prime Minister, who said that while he was moved</p>
<p> by the Constitutional Convention the Government was now back dealing</p>
<p> with the issues that the public really cared about, tax, jobs and</p>
<p> industrial reform. And at the conclusion of the weekend meeting Mr</p>
<p> Howard told our chief political correspondent, Matt Peacock, the Government</p>
<p> would support an $8 a week pay rise for low paid workers at the National</p>
<p> Wage Case which begins tomorrow.</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>We will be arguing that there should be an $8 a week increase for</p>
<p> each of the next two years for the very low paid. That will represent</p>
<p> for them a real increase, given the current rate of inflation, of</p>
<p> 1.2 per cent. This fulfils the promise we made before the last election</p>
<p> that we would argue for reasonable and fair living wage increases</p>
<p> for the low paid. You have got to remember that we are now in a very</p>
<p> low inflationary environment and this represents a real increase for</p>
<p> the low paid. When you add to it the massive reductions in housing</p>
<p> interest rates worth around $250 a month for people with average loans,</p>
<p> together they are real, tangible dollars in the pocket gains for low</p>
<p> income earners. And it does keep our word to the battlers of Australia.</p>
<p> PEACOCK:</p>
<p>Course some companies have done better than that, some executives</p>
<p> have done better than that, should they be sharing around some of</p>
<p> their wealth?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>They, of course, are accountable to their shareholders and I do think</p>
<p> company executives have got community and moral responsibilities in</p>
<p> these matters. I am a believer in market forces, but I am also a believer</p>
<p> that people who preach restraint on the rest of the community should</p>
<p> be willing to apply it to themselves. Now we have got to be realistic</p>
<p> and recognise that if you want the best people in Australia to run</p>
<p> your company you have got to pay them otherwise they will go somewhere</p>
<p> else, and that applies to us as a nation. But some of those people</p>
<p> might occasionally look at the example they set and the impression</p>
<p> they create, particularly against the rhetoric that is sometimes used</p>
<p> by business organisations to berate people who want a bit of an increase</p>
<p> when they are further down the scale. It is a question of what is</p>
<p> fair and what is just and occasionally some of these executive salary</p>
<p> increases rub a little roughly against the sensitivities.</p>
<p> PEACOCK:</p>
<p>Well of course on that subject, a couple of weeks ago I asked you</p>
<p> about the situation of the workers at Cobar in the mine there and</p>
<p> you said you had some sympathy for companies trying to make ends meet.</p>
<p> But since then, of course, even your Minister Newman has indicated</p>
<p> that she thinks that workers who have been abandoned by a multi-national</p>
<p> mining company like this should have first call to get their back</p>
<p> pay, their redundancy pay, their sick pay, those kinds of things rather</p>
<p> than the secured creditors. How do you feel about that?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I think what Senator Newman had to say was right. What I said</p>
<p> a little while ago on that issue was that, you asked me against the</p>
<p> background of the Government's decision to help fund the redundancies</p>
<p> on the waterfront, the understanding there is that ultimately the</p>
<p> cost of those redundancies will be met by the industry and not by</p>
<p> the taxpayer. So therefore it wasn't an analogous situation.</p>
<p> But my office saw some representatives of the union last week and</p>
<p> we are looking at what is being put to us. We are in sympathy with</p>
<p> the position of people who are made redundant and they find themselves</p>
<p> ranked in order behind other claimants on the assets of the company</p>
<p> that has pulled out. And there is obviously a case for reviewing those</p>
<p> priorities, and we are doing that at the present time.</p>
<p> PEACOCK:</p>
<p>Is it possible to change the law in that regard do you think?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well it is always possible to change the law if you can get it through</p>
<p> the Parliament, it is a question of whether it is sensible to do so</p>
<p> and we are examining that right at the moment.</p>
<p> PEACOCK:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, the Treasurer at the weekend has unveiled a bit more of</p>
<p> the campaign for tax reform, the Â‘great adventure' as you</p>
<p> once called it and you have been gee-ing up the troops here at Thredbo,</p>
<p> just exactly how can you be so optimistic that you can get through</p>
<p> a scare campaign against the GST?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well in a sense that would be precisely what any opposition to tax</p>
<p> reform would be. It would be nothing other than a cheap scare campaign</p>
<p> utterly indifferent to the long-term interests of this country.</p>
<p> PEACOCK:</p>
<p>But it has worked politically in the past, hasn't it?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>In the past attempts at tax reform has failed. We are determined those</p>
<p> attempts will not have failed on this occasion, and the reasons we</p>
<p> are determined is that it is in Australia's interests, it is</p>
<p> for Australia's sake that we have embarked upon this adventure</p>
<p> of tax reform. We need a new, modern, up to date lower tax regime</p>
<p> for the 21st Century. We cannot have a situation where average wage</p>
<p> earners are paying 43, 47 cents in the dollar on every additional</p>
<p> dollar they earn. We cannot have a tax system which puts no tax on</p>
<p> caviar but taxes biscuits, we can't have a tax system that makes</p>
<p> us uncompetitive around the world. And what we are doing now is to</p>
<p> argue the case for tax reform by demonstrating the unfairness, the</p>
<p> old fashioned character and the irrelevance of the present tax system</p>
<p> which is, after all Labor's system. I mean Labor did nothing</p>
<p> for 13 years to fix the tax system and now they are pretending it</p>
<p> doesn't need repair.</p>
<p> PEACOCK:</p>
<p>Do you think you will be able to restrain yourself though from dipping</p>
<p> in to what looks like being a healthy surplus to fund some of these</p>
<p> income tax cuts?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Matt I can assure you that in contrast to the Labor Party whatever</p>
<p> we do in the area will be utterly sound and utterly responsible. After</p>
<p> all we are the people who inherited a $10.5 billion Beazley deficit</p>
<p> and will, in a few months, turn it into a more than $2 billion Howard</p>
<p> surplus.</p>
<p> PEACOCK:</p>
<p>Now here at Thredbo you have been hearing from a man who walked through</p>
<p> the snow to the Antarctic, is that an analogy, do you think, to the</p>
<p> next campaign in the election?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well Peter Tressider gave us a fascinating account on Saturday night</p>
<p> of his journey. It was a physical achievement of a different and a</p>
<p> higher order and we admire him greatly, and he demonstrated great</p>
<p> Australian grit and great Australian spirit.</p>
<p> PEACOCK:</p>
<p>And the mood amongst the back-bench?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Very optimistic. There was a mood that the last two or three months</p>
<p> had been months of solid achievement for the Government. There is</p>
<p> a greater recognition out there that if we hadn't been in charge</p>
<p> of the economy over the last two years with what has happened in Asia</p>
<p> we would now be in a real mess.</p>
<p> PEACOCK:</p>
<p>There is a lot of concern though about elderly people, nursing homes</p>
<p> is there anyway that you might be able to fine tune your policy a</p>
<p> bit more?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>We are always in the business of keeping policies under review and</p>
<p> keeping policies fine tuned. I have no doubt that when we go to the</p>
<p> next election that the retired people of Australia will feel that</p>
<p> their interests are best served in supporting the Government.</p>
<p> PEACOCK:</p>
<p>Now that sounds like these fees that are due to come in, despite the</p>
<p> fact that there has been a bit of a delay there still might be some</p>
<p> more changes?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Look I am not going to say anything other than what I have said before</p>
<p> on this. The proposal is that it comes in.</p>
<p> PEACOCK:</p>
<p>Now you really enjoyed the Constitutional Convention judging from</p>
<p> your comments afterwards, how emotional an experience was it as a</p>
<p> die hard monarchist such as yourself?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>It was a great experience, it did bring Australians of diverse backgrounds</p>
<p> and attitudes together and there was a unifying spirit despite the</p>
<p> differences of view. And it gave me a great source of hope and optimism</p>
<p> about the future national unity of this country. And I have no doubt</p>
<p> that when this debate comes, after the next election, and frankly</p>
<p> from now on it is back to what really matters in the immediate term</p>
<p> and that is jobs, taxation, industrial relations reform. They are</p>
<p> the things that people stop you in the street to talk about. Nobody</p>
<p> stops me in Pitt Street or Collins Street, grabs me by the arms and</p>
<p> saying we have got to be a republic or we have got to stay a monarchy,</p>
<p> but they do stop me and say thank God you are doing something about</p>
<p> the waterfront. They do stop me and say please will you fix the tax</p>
<p> system. They do stop me and say, thank heavens you are running economy</p>
<p> because with what is happening in Asia we would now be in a real mess</p>
<p> if the other mob was still there.</p>
<p> PEACOCK:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, thanks very much.</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Pleasure.</p>
<p>[Ends]</p>
