PRIME MINISTER 11/ 96<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
MR HOWARD OBFUSCATES WITH TELEVISION DEBATES<br />
Mr Howard is now obfuscating with my proposal for nationally televised<br />
debates. The Federal Director of the Liberal Party, Mr Robb, has told the ALP's National<br />
Secretary, Mr Gray, that Mr Howard will not debate me with the ABC's choice of<br />
moderator. I have told the ABC through Mr Gray that I am prepared to have two<br />
head-to-head debates with Mr Howard telecast by the ABC and moderated by a<br />
person nominated by the ABC.<br />
Mr Howard and Mr Robb are also backing away from debates between me, the<br />
Deputy Prime Minister, and the Treasurer with our opposite numbers in the<br />
Coalition and between me, the Deputy Prime Minister and the Foreign Minister<br />
and our opposite numbers.<br />
Mr Howard does not want to be seen on national television in the company of<br />
Mr Fischer, Mr Downer and Mr Costello because of what it would reveal about<br />
the weakness of any government led by him.<br />
If Mr Howard says he has the team to lead Australia he should not be afraid to<br />
be seen with them; to show them to the public with him.<br />
CANBERRA 28 January 1996 </p>
