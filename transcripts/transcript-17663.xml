This is a remarkable day for the people of Egypt. </p>
<p>In their millions, Egyptians have called for change - for an open, democratic society that offers greater opportunity for its people.</p>
<p>Through their courage and determination to have their voices heard, Egyptians have made an important step toward that goal.</p>
<p>All Australians will have been moved by the joy we saw last night in Cairo's Tahrir Square.</p>
<p>But the path ahead for Egypt is unclear and many challenges remain.</p>
<p>Together with many other concerned nations, Australia calls for fundamental reform that will ensure the opportunity and freedoms that ordinary Egyptians have been calling for. </p>
<p>Australia calls for constitutional reform and a clear timetable towards free and fair elections and a representative civilian government that will govern for all Egyptians.</p>
<p>This change must come without violence or intimidation against those who have been peacefully demanding reform.</p>
<p>Australia stands ready to help in this transition in any way we can. </p>
