PRESS; OFFICE TRANSCRIPT FRIDAY MARCH 14 1980<br />
DOORSTOP WOOL DISPUTE<br />
Question: We were told you were leavinq at 11.30.<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
Iwas.<br />
Question: Prime Minister, it has been a terribly long meeting. One can only<br />
draw the conclusion there must have been some problems in there today.<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
I don't think there were problems in terms of a difference between<br />
any of the parties. The meeting was a long one because the matters<br />
and the issues that are involved are of immense seriousness and<br />
concern to the Government, and to all the participants at the meeting.<br />
It is important from the point of view of the well being of wool growers,<br />
of the-brokers, important from the point of view of the well being<br />
of people in industry, the strikers themselves whose families are<br />
suffering and have probably lost what maybe $ 1,000, $ 1,500 over<br />
the last 10 weeks, and infinitely important in terms of Australia's<br />
trading reputation and capacity to supply markets overseas, And to<br />
keep a regular supply of wool onto the markets. All of these things<br />
of course, emphasise the importance of it.<br />
Now, a wide range of matters were discussed. A number of options<br />
were discussed, and we have come out of the meeting with a cdompletely<br />
unified position between all the brokers, all the grower organisations<br />
and the Government. There are a range of measures, which the brokers,<br />
because they are the specific employers running this part of the<br />
industry, will be ' implemeniting Some of them are pretty<br />
forthright and determined ' measures, There 2are one or two<br />
very major matters which were pi. qt to the Government and the<br />
Government has accepted.* Specificaiiy, we were asked to bring down<br />
export control regulations that would enable us to control the<br />
export of wool. The regulations will be drawn they should be<br />
ready by Tuesday -and they will apply to all raw wool, they will<br />
cover the export of raw wool because it is necessary to have a<br />
unified approach throughout the whole industry. It also needs to<br />
be stated that the sum of the decisions that are taken, and you<br />
will see the statement that is being dropped very shortly,. does<br />
mean that pending the resolution of the dispute, and hopefully<br />
that could happen tomorrow morning or over the weekend, but pending<br />
the resolution of the dispute, the collective decisions that have been<br />
taken and-~ to which all the parties have committed themselves, will<br />
bring the industry to a halt.<br />
Question: Are we any closer to an end to the dispute as a result of today's<br />
conference, do you think?<br />
1 -1-</p>
<p>2<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
That depends entirely on whether there are the beginnings of<br />
reasonableness in the union itself. But, what has been demonstrated.<br />
today with total and absolute commitment of all the parties present<br />
to uphold the allocations system, to uphold the principles of the<br />
Full Bench decision, and not to be pressed as a result of<br />
a. straight out defiance of that decision into a very foolish result,<br />
You will see the statement shortly, and I think you will realise<br />
that there are effective measures in it.<br />
The request put to the Government and the decision by the Government<br />
in relation to export controls is of course, fundamental to the<br />
whole a frngements. There are a-number-i~ ofvery. significant<br />
decisions that the brokers will be taking, but that, in a sense,.<br />
is the lihcihpin around-which the industry has prepared its case.<br />
Question: Are -you--basically saying sir, that you-have convinced the farmers<br />
now, not to march in and take their wool?-'<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
I am quite certain that the farmers now understand that very resolute<br />
action has been taken, and they are, therefore, content with that.<br />
And that is what they wanted. CQuestion inaudible,,,)<br />
I have'got no doubt that the union will learn of these new measures<br />
very, very quickly indeed. </p>
