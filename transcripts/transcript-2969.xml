A 1 1 PRESS STATEMENT NO, 111<br />
4 July 1973<br />
MOVEMENT OF AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT STAFF TO ALBURY-WODONGA<br />
The Prime Minister announced today that the Public<br />
Service Board would establish a Joint Consultative Committee<br />
on the movement of Australian Public Service staff to Albury-<br />
Wodonga. The Joint Consultative Committee would bring<br />
together representatives of staff organisations, departments<br />
and the Public Service Board to advise the Board on matters<br />
such as the detailed arrangement of a transfer program of<br />
Australian Public Service staff to Albury-Wodonga, conditions<br />
of employment for staff affected by the transfers and the<br />
sort of amenitites and community facilities that Australian<br />
Public Service staff would like to see developed in Albury-<br />
Wodonga. He said that the Chairman of the Public Service Board<br />
had written to all Australian Public Service staff to inform<br />
them of the consultative procedures that would be introduced<br />
and of progress on the studies that were being made with<br />
repsect to the movement of Australian Public Service staff<br />
to Albury-Wodonga.<br />
The acceptance by Australian Public Service staff of<br />
Albury-Wodonga as an attractive place to live and work was<br />
a key element in the success of Government plans for Albury-<br />
Wodonga, he said. The Government believed that the adoption<br />
of consultative procedures as outlined by the Public Service<br />
Board would be the best way to achieve this acceptance.<br />
The Joint Consultative Committee is to be established<br />
once the Government has made the hroad policy decision on which<br />
Australian Public Service departments are to be invo. lved in<br />
transfers to Albu:,' y-Wodonga.<br />
