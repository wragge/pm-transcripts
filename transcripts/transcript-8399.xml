PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING, MP,<br />
DOORSTOP, CANBERRA, 2 FEBRUARY 1992<br />
E OE PROOF' COPY<br />
J: Prime Minister, is it a body blow to Labor the<br />
overwhelming defeat of the Field Government?<br />
PM: I don't think that it is any more, to Federal Labor,<br />
any more than the near loss of the New South Wales<br />
election was a body blow to the Federal Liberal Party.<br />
We nearly Won the New South Wales election and that<br />
result was confirmed in a by-election two weekends ago<br />
and we won't at pains be drawing Federal implications<br />
from that. I don't think you can from this. I think<br />
the important thing to say about Tasmania is that, most<br />
Governments are defeated doing the wrong thing. This<br />
one's being defeated doing the right thing. If ever<br />
there was a Government which deserves, I think, to have<br />
its work recognised, it was the Field Government. He<br />
took on a State which was nearly bankrupt and radically<br />
altered its finances where the Gray Government just<br />
threw the fight for quite a long number of years and he<br />
was two thirds of the way through it. So I think<br />
history will judge Michael Field and his Government<br />
perhaps better than the Tasmania public. But Field<br />
accepts the result of the Tasmanian people as all<br />
democrats have to and do.<br />
J: But that doesn't say much about the maturity of the<br />
Australian voters, does it?<br />
PM: At least the Government did what it had to do. It did<br />
not shirk the fight. I don't know of any Premier in the<br />
years I was Treasurer who took on a more difficult<br />
financial landscape and actually made a very great<br />
headway through it.<br />
J: Had Michael Field been able to advertise on TV and<br />
radio, he would of had a better chance?<br />
PM: Well that's a matter for judgement, but I'm sure these<br />
things will be ragged over by the rest of you.<br />
r-</p>
<p>J: Are you worried about the threats by some MPs in South<br />
Australia to resign, and the fact that there could be<br />
an election there as well?<br />
PM: I have not heard of those.<br />
J: They are calling for Federal intervention in South<br />
Australia. Would you be interested?<br />
PM: Over what though?<br />
J: Faction brawling.<br />
PM: Well these things happen whenever pre-selections are<br />
on. You can't be a wide-eyed innocent about these<br />
things.<br />
J: unemployment had nothing to do with the result in<br />
Tasmania?<br />
PM: I think it has got a fair bit to do. I think it is<br />
very diLfficult for Governments in recessions to win<br />
elections. It is difficult and I think it has been<br />
part of the difficulty in Tasmania. The other part oil<br />
the difficulty, I think, for the Field Government was<br />
that there's a great polarity developed between the<br />
Liberals who have developed or say they would develop<br />
anything, and the Greens who won't develop nothing and<br />
the Labor Party is sort of sitting in between trying to<br />
get the right balance. Often getting the right balance<br />
is not appreciated, and I don't think it was on this<br />
occasion.<br />
J: Mr Keating have you any dates for your talks with the<br />
ACTU about wages and any further thinking on the<br />
wage/ tax trade-off issue?<br />
PM: No, we have not set any timetable as yet.<br />
J: What dco you think of the New South Wales Goverrnent's<br />
offer to Bob Hawke<br />
PM: I thought it might have been speculation. I don't know<br />
whether it is true or not.<br />
J: Well they have confirmed it.<br />
PM: Have they? Well I'm sure Bob will do a good job.<br />
J: Do you have any more detail as to his plans since<br />
you've spoken to him in the<br />
PM: None whatsoever. No. </p>
<p>J: Mr Keating there are a lot of reports at the moment of<br />
the po~ ssibility that Nissan might close its car<br />
manufa~ cturing plant in Australia. How keen is the<br />
Goverrnent to see Nissan stay here and what might it do<br />
by way of convincing them that they should stay here?<br />
PM: That's a matter for the company I think. I saw that<br />
report today, I don't know that it's correct. But it<br />
is a miatter for the company to decide, the Government's<br />
laid down a plan over a long period of years and made<br />
out that the downtown of the cycle for car<br />
manufacturing would not have helped any of the<br />
manufacturers, including Nissan, but in the end<br />
Nissan's future is basically up to Nissan.<br />
J: to adjusting the car<br />
PM: I don't think the company has been in touch with the<br />
Governent at this stage.<br />
J: But in general terms given the severity of the<br />
recessiLon difficulties they are having and the number<br />
of people they employ, are you giving any thought to<br />
altering the schedule for tariff cuts to the car<br />
industry?<br />
PM: No, we hadn't been. But again we have had put to us by<br />
a number of car manufacturers what they see as shorter<br />
term remedies for the current cyclical downturn. And<br />
we have been considering those.<br />
J: Is it possible that having fewer car makers in<br />
Australia will eventually leave an industry in better<br />
shape for the<br />
PM: Well, the aim of the plan in the ' 80s was to arrive at<br />
a number of competitive models in Australia. Time<br />
alone will tell if that's to be achieved.<br />
J: Mr Keating, resource security was one that you should<br />
talk about in Tasmania, you were very critical of the<br />
resource security legislation when you were still in<br />
the Cabinet as Treasurer. What's your view now and<br />
will any changes be made?<br />
PM: Well we have got a Bill in the Parliament and that's<br />
the fact of the matter and if that Bill passes, well<br />
then the legislation will be established.<br />
J: Would you think to be making any amendments to that as<br />
it goes through?<br />
PM: Not at this stage, no.<br />
J: If the Bill fails will you be seeking to put any </p>
<p>PM: Let's wait and see. I think the best thing is to wait<br />
and see.<br />
J: Does the Tasmanian result show that there is a need for<br />
you and your Government to redress the perception that:<br />
the Greens are against all development, and that<br />
Labor's been a supporter of them?<br />
PM: Well we won the election on our policies in 1990, and<br />
in 1987 Green issues were part and parcel of the<br />
campaign. So I think the balance we brought to the<br />
envirorunment in the context of growth has been an<br />
appropriate one. This is an election which has got<br />
many state complexions about it. I notice Dr Hewson<br />
who has; always marketed himself as a wide-eyed<br />
political innocent saying, well Government should just<br />
do the right thing and things will look after<br />
themselves. Well this Government did do the rights<br />
things and things didn't look after themselves, so I<br />
don't know if Dr Hewson can take any comfort from this<br />
result.<br />
ENDS </p>
