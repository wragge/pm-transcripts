TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING, MP<br />
INTERVIEW WITH JULIE FLYNN, RADIO 2UE, 5 MAY 1994<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
JF: Prime Minister, there has been a mixed reaction to yesterday's<br />
Statement. Can you understand why some people are sceptical that<br />
this will solve the unemployment problem?<br />
PM: Well, people are entitled to be sceptical, but I don't think they are<br />
entitled to be negative about it. This is a very large program. No<br />
Government in Australia has ever entertained this. But we know that<br />
unless we intensively case manage the long term unemployed, by the<br />
end of the century there will still b6, even witfh a lot of econ . omic growth<br />
and a lot of employment, about 300,000 people still long term<br />
unemployed. Now, what this program will mean is that every individual<br />
will be personally case managed. That means that their personality,<br />
their work experience, their education, their educational standards,<br />
their aptitude, their prospects for training, and their prospects for a job<br />
placement will be managed by one person, which gives them a real<br />
chance to break the cycle and get back into the labour market and<br />
enjoy the country as the rest of us has.<br />
JF: But you are going to need business to be part of this compact, aren't<br />
you? If they remain sceptical, how can you ensure that they will<br />
participate?<br />
PM: Well, I think we are setting up, in a very novel change here, a<br />
competitive case management and job placement market. That is, we<br />
are not simply leaving this to the CES, there will be the development of<br />
private case managers, and we will ee a much greater effectiveness<br />
in job placement. Therefore, I think, a better relationship with<br />
employers, and a willingness on the part of employers, therefore, to<br />
build a relationship with a case manager, or a case management firm,<br />
or the CES, and to take people up. As well as that, there are very<br />
strong job subsidy payments here. If employers take people up they're </p>
<p>will be $ 230.00 to $ 260.00 for the first 13 weeks, and it drops back<br />
after that, and if they keep them on we give them a bonus too. So, as<br />
well as that the Government will be introducing the feature of a training<br />
wage. So, for trainees, particularly young people and unemployed<br />
people, those people will take a discount on award wages for on-thejob<br />
training. So, I think the other thing that needs to be remembered<br />
here, from this recession to this recovery, in this recovery, there won't<br />
be resort to migration for a compliment to skills formation in the<br />
economy. This has got to be internally generated from the new<br />
entrants of the labour market and from the long term unemployed.<br />
JE: And if we don't train those people ourselves we end up with a problem<br />
at the other end of higher demands on wages because of skill<br />
shortages.<br />
PM: We end up with that, and you end up with this terrible problem of<br />
alienation. Where 300,000 to 400,000 people think that society<br />
doesn't care about them, that they are cast offs, that there is no role for<br />
them. And that leads, I think, in the end to social division and social<br />
decay. If you look at countries like the United States where you see it<br />
in a lot of the capital cities, it is because no Government at the time<br />
ever took this kind of interest.<br />
JF But, if you are going to say that you want to include employers,<br />
employers are saying that the new industrial relations Act, which<br />
makes it harder for them to sack people, is actually a disincentive to<br />
employ people.<br />
PM: Well, employers were quite bullish, I thought, yesterday in their<br />
reaction to the Statement. The Chamber of Manufactures of NSW<br />
said, the White Paper is a helping hand, the White Pa per is a helping<br />
hand, it is also in the best interests of industry. If sid th-e job compact<br />
will ensure that a person who needs to find a job will merge sweetly,<br />
sweetly, whether employers need to fill one. Now, those organisations<br />
represent the many smaller businesses, and medium sized<br />
businesses, and I think that was a very encouraging sign.<br />
JE: Do you think, perhaps, there should have been more incentive for<br />
business to invest, because isn't that in the end where the new jobs<br />
are going to come from?<br />
PM: Well, there can't be a greater incentive then the highest profit share in<br />
the countries history. Which is currently what business has: a 33 per<br />
cent corporate tax rate, massive acceleration depreciation, if that is not<br />
going to work, nothing is going to work.<br />
JF: Now, you have introduced a parenting allowance, and a partner<br />
allowance, and a youth training allowance, why isn't it fair to say that<br />
these are simply devices to get those people off the unemployment<br />
lists? </p>
<p>PM: Because what we have been doing in the past is jointly income testing<br />
couples where the bread winner has been unemployed. So, if then,<br />
let's say the husband, gets some extra income with a very savage<br />
taper on the pension, that is, for every dollar of income they earn they<br />
lose a dollar of unemployment benefits. That income to the family is<br />
also lost from the spouse caring for the children. So, in a very major<br />
reform in this White Paper, what the Government decided is to<br />
separately, rather then jointly, income test. And to separately pay to<br />
the couple, the individuals, half the married rate of unemployment<br />
benefit. So, you will find that a spouse would be paid $ 132.00 per<br />
week, let's say for a mother, into her bank account. And that is there,<br />
either, while she is being work tested for unemployment benefits, or<br />
she has children at home so accepts it as a parenting allowance.<br />
Now, she won't lose any of that money until the husband, if you like,<br />
until his income rises to about $ 380.00, $ 375.00 a week. So, in other<br />
words, as a result that couple now on unemployment benefits, or even<br />
where one is in full time low paid work, will be advantaged quite<br />
substantially. Probably, I think, about 120,000 low income families will<br />
find themselves about $ 60 a week better off. So, in other words let<br />
me try and put it simply again instead of jointly income testing a<br />
couple on unemployment benefits we pay the benefit separately to the<br />
husband and wife, or partner as the case may be, and we income test<br />
them both separately. But because the income test is more generous<br />
with a 70 per cent, what is called taper rate, rather than 100, that<br />
means that the husband can earn more and the wife still keeps the full<br />
amount, either as unemployment benefit or as a parenting allowance.<br />
JF: But it does mean that a lot of those people will disappear won't they,<br />
and the young people from the unemployment list as we see them<br />
now, because they won't be regarded as part of the labour force?<br />
PM: Well it is a matter of whether a woman 32 years of age with a couple of<br />
kids, 2 or 3 children, who can't really be work-tested should ever have<br />
been regarded as being in the labour force. I mean is that person<br />
really in the labour force? The answer is they are not.<br />
JF: Prime Minister, when you look at the package you say the underlying<br />
philosophy is employment and growth. But in fact the other argument<br />
is that you have got to get the growth first and the employment will<br />
come. Why not reduce the budget deficit further then was expected<br />
under the previous budget deficit reduction program?<br />
PM: Because I think we answered this in the White Paper. We say the<br />
judgement to be made is the marginally lower budget deficit and<br />
marginally lower financing effects. Vis a vis picking up the better part<br />
of half a million people and managing them back into work. The<br />
macro-economic effect of that is far greater than it is the marginally<br />
lower interest rate effect on financing a lower budget deficit. At any<br />
rate, the financial markets have gone crackers lately anyway. I mean, </p>
<p>here they are with long bonds up 2 per cent, on the short end up point<br />
7 for no good reason. So, they are saying to the Government; " you<br />
should produce a lower budget deficit", which they want. So, we leave<br />
the long term unemployed, half a million people in a hole, and we then<br />
say to you, well, in that case you will give us a lower interest rate when<br />
you have just demonstrated that you are going to give us a higher one<br />
for no good reason, even when you look at the low inflation numbers<br />
coming up.<br />
JF: Are you concerned that the current account deficit yesterday showed<br />
that there was a 2 per cent increase in the trend figure, suggesting that<br />
perhaps we are seeing a blow out in the current account again?<br />
PM: I don't think so. We have had such a great export performance over<br />
the last few years. The shift to export, the cultural change is just so<br />
strong now. I mean, there are business people all over South East<br />
Asia and North Asia. We are massively competitive on the exchange<br />
rate, inflation and wages, and that is why in the White Paper on<br />
industry policy we have got those changes running through again on<br />
export market development grants. We have said we will leave the<br />
scheme there for another five years, and we have improved it. On the<br />
ITES ( International trade enhancement scheme) another four years.<br />
All of these out-reach programs help business break into export<br />
markets. So, the whole Statement is one about national efficiency, as<br />
well as equity. We are saying it is not simply a matter of fairness, but<br />
it is a matter of efficiency; that you don't have a pool of half a million<br />
people long term unemployed. That skills formation in the recovery is<br />
not going to come from migration, even with the migration level, intake<br />
levels we have now. It is going to come from new entrants to the work<br />
force and retraining a large body of people who shouldn't be bearing<br />
the brunt of the recession by themselves.<br />
JF: Your White Paper was fairly comprehensively leaked, and Bronwyn<br />
Bishop appears to have got a leak of the outline of the Budget speech<br />
for next week. Are you concerned?<br />
PM: No, it is not a leak. It is a Paper asking a set of questions about things<br />
that might be considerations in the Budget. I mean, it must have been<br />
very early in the process, the Government has moved way beyond that<br />
now, and the Paper bears no resemblance to what the Budget will be<br />
in a week.<br />
JF: Are you aware of the allegations that were made in the Parliament<br />
today<br />
PM: I wasn't in Parliament today, other then to present the Paper.<br />
JF: Are you aware of an investigation by the CJC in Queensland, and are<br />
you aware if it involves any Labor Party figures? </p>
<p>PM: I have got no idea. I have been told about the claims made. I can only<br />
comment on the cowardice of this person, in the House of<br />
Representatives, abusing the privilege of the Parliament to make these<br />
sort of allegations. I mean, this is these days the stock in trade of the<br />
Coalition. I mean, they don't have any policies, they are devoid of<br />
policies, they must look at this Paper and just wonder. The Liberal<br />
Party and National Parties couldn't have conceived of this White<br />
Paper, let alone implement it. And if that is their form, if this is their<br />
parliamentary form for this session, in the face of this sort of quality,<br />
then the Australian people again, will, I think, judge them harshly.<br />
JF: Thank you Prime Minister.<br />
