    <content><![CDATA[<p>The United Nations Security Council has unanimously adopted a resolution calling on the armed separatist groups controlling the MH17 crash site to allow unfettered access to international investigators.</p>
<p>Australia played a lead role, authoring the resolution which was adopted in New York on July 21 (July 22 Australian time).</p>
<p>It calls on the separatists to ensure the bodies of the 298 victims â including 28 Australians and nine Australian permanent residents â are treated with the utmost dignity and respect and returned to their grieving families.</p>
<p>The resolution underlined the need for a full, thorough and independent international investigation into the crash and demanded all military activities in the area cease to allow immediate, safe, secure and unrestricted access to investigating authorities.</p>
<p>It asks all countries to cooperate in bringing the perpetrators of this crime to justice.</p>
<p>Todayâs resolution lends the full weight of the Security Council in condemning the attack and extending the international communityâs deepest sympathies and condolences to the families of all the victims of this tragic incident.</p>
<p>Australia welcomes the UN Secretary-Generalâs offer of assistance to the investigation. The United Nations will continue to have a crucial role in the aftermath of the MH17 tragedy.</p>
<p>Australia will continue to do everything in its power to ensure this barbaric act is thoroughly investigated and the perpetrators brought to justice.</p>
