TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P. J. KEATING MP<br />
DOORSTOP AT CONCLUSION OF LEADERS RETREAT, MADANG<br />
RESORT, 14 SEPTEMBER 1995<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
PM: I'll just give you a few remarks. We had a good but long meeting where<br />
we have adopted, I think, a good communique which is about<br />
advancing the theme of last year which was managing resources.<br />
Now, we are talking about securing development beyond 2000. We<br />
had a good discussion around those issues and the communique will<br />
be published for you very shortly. We also adopted the code of<br />
conduct the logging code of conduct which we have been working on<br />
since last year and we agreed unanimously to implement it with our<br />
national codes. So, in other words, as each country implements its<br />
national code of logging practices and conduct, it will give effect to the<br />
code of conduct principles which are there and which have been<br />
published to date.<br />
Could I just say there was a lengthy discussion about nuclear testing in<br />
the Pacific and you will find a very strong communique where the<br />
leaders say they express their extreme outrage at the resumption of<br />
French nuclear testing. Forum leaders again demand that France<br />
desist from any further tests in the region and call on other countries<br />
also to seek to persuade France to cease testing It goes on to say that<br />
should France continue its testing in the Pacific, the Forum will review<br />
France's status as a post-Forum dialogue partner and it goes on in that<br />
vein. So, there was a very strong, and again unanimous view about that. So.<br />
by and large, I think, one could report solid progress.<br />
J: Did any particular country object to the communique on France?<br />
PM: No, no. There was a discussion coming from Vanuatu, I thirnk, and<br />
some of the people in the Melanesian spearhead group that they want<br />
some sort of monitoring program there for the future. Because when<br />
this program ceases, they want to be able to evaluate the atoll<br />
environment and any attendant risk. So, there was a discussion about<br />
that, but by and large it was agreed unanimously. </p>
<p>J: Did any nations... break off the post-Forum relations with France?<br />
PM: There was some discussion about that but not much because. I think,<br />
that to most countries the Forum dialogue does provide an opportunity<br />
to have a discussion with France, but in the event, as the communique<br />
says, if it continues testing, the Forum will review its status as a post-<br />
Forum dialogue partner.<br />
J: So, does that mean that the French Minister due to attend the meeting<br />
from Saturday next week, that he may be told that he is not welcome?<br />
PM: No, no. the French Minister will definitely be Involved in the dialogue, at<br />
this time.<br />
J: until next year, by which time the testing will be over anyway.<br />
PM: The testing will be over, but will France have its dialogue status?<br />
J: Prime Minister, in relation to the logging code of practice, how do you<br />
understand that will apply to the Solomon Islands, as the Solomon<br />
Islands say it wont apply until they develop their own national code of<br />
practires.<br />
PM: For a start, it was unanimously endorsed and the Solomon Islands<br />
Minister endorsed the code of conduct along with the rest of us. The<br />
code of conduct though, is not a binding document which will apply to<br />
each country. It is a set of principles and guidelines which will then be<br />
subject to adoption as part of their national code of practice and code of<br />
conduct. So, in other words and I might just give an example, Vanuatu<br />
is just in the process now of adopting it, of ratifying and adopting it as<br />
part of its code of conduct before its ministerial council. As you know<br />
Australia at the moment is going through its own forestry practice<br />
regime PNG has indicated that they are within a few months of their<br />
being In a position to adopt their own xnde.<br />
J. Solomon Islands doesn't introduce its own national code. It will have<br />
not affect and practices will continue iin the Solomon Islands the same<br />
as they are now?<br />
PM: That is right, but again these codes are adopted here but the effect of<br />
them can only be given under national rules or national legislation.<br />
That has always been the case. In other words, what you are asking<br />
me is if a country wants to wilfully go along and damage through clear<br />
felling for instance its forest environment, does this stop it? No, but the<br />
Solomon's did endorse the code.<br />
J: What brought the code of conduct back into discussions today, we'd<br />
heard it was to be taken off... </p>
<p>PMV: No. it was never off the agenda, it waq cming back from last year. It<br />
was absolutely set on the agenda for this time beAuise it was. coming<br />
from last year.<br />
J: . Just going back to the nuclear testing issue again briefly, do you think<br />
cxtrorne outrage is good enough, hasn't France already got INe<br />
message that there is oxtreme outrage?<br />
PM: Well, would you like us to stand on our head and borrow a few garlands<br />
trom around here to make the show better for you. What else have wo<br />
got to say?<br />
J. Do you think France wiAll take any notice..<br />
PM: I think the French are veiy huit about all this. Now, they say in a<br />
melancholy and wounded way, this is about the rest of us trying to<br />
remove France from the Pacific. Well, of course we are noL. What it is<br />
about is a bad decision to test nuclear weapons. That is what it is<br />
about.<br />
J, United Nations Prime Minister, to condemn France over this?<br />
PM: That is still part of our processes and, of course, we also noted and<br />
endorsed New Zealand's taking of the case to the ICJ. So, we are<br />
going to continue our campaign.<br />
J: ( inaudible) [ French teriftories? J<br />
PM: No, only that it was said at the meeting that these are matters between<br />
France itself and the various national groupings and populations.<br />
J: Was there any discussin about how the Forum how France would<br />
react to this latest communique?<br />
PM: It is about getting a reaction It is designed to get a reaction and, I<br />
think, the language makes that clear.<br />
J: ( inaudible)...<br />
PM: Wall, it is about France's general attitude towards the Pacific area arid<br />
its obvious contempt in this decision. I think they are the things that will<br />
be assessed this time next year or between now and then,<br />
J: Sn, it can be between now and then?<br />
PM: Yes, sure.<br />
J: Was the general attitude of the region discussed?<br />
PM: No, not per se. </p>
<p>J-So, the next test going off..<br />
PM: Well, it will mean for a start we are continuing to express our outrage at<br />
what has happened. We repeat that. We again demand that France<br />
desist from those tests. Were it to explode another devise then it would<br />
be up to Forum leaders to decide whether that dialogue status with the<br />
Forum continues.<br />
J: A couple of weeks ago you referred to France as still being a colonial<br />
power in the South Pacific. In recent days you have made the point<br />
that the status of those temitones is a matter for people of those<br />
territories and France, yet in the past Australia has taken an active<br />
interest in the making of accords for example in New Caledonia. Do<br />
you believe that the testing issue will act as a catalyst for change and<br />
reconsideration of that territorial status by France, New Caledonia and<br />
French Polynesia.<br />
PMV: I don't now the answer to that, but when PNG was seen as a colonial<br />
territory of Australia that became a matter of debate and led, of: course,<br />
to the independence movement, the independence of Papua New<br />
Guinea which we celebrate with its twentieth anniversary this weekend.<br />
Certain things bring these things into the public debate and I have got<br />
no doubt that this weapons' testing program has brought into the public<br />
debate France's status in the Pacific. But as with Australia, the<br />
independence of PNG was a matter for Australia and the people of<br />
PNG. So similarly is independence in the Pacific a matter for France in<br />
the French territories for France and the members of those<br />
communities. It is not a matter for the Forum.<br />
J: Well Australia was influenced heavily by other countries in its say in its<br />
independence of PNG Prime Minister.<br />
PM: I think to be fair to ourselves I think we lead our own way out of our<br />
colonial arrangements in PNG, perhaps later than might of otherwise<br />
been, but still within 25 or 30 years of the war. It is for France to make<br />
its own mind up about what its status and standing is here and what its<br />
national objectives here and how people here relate to it.<br />
J: Sir Julius implied earlier this week that the code of conduct would be<br />
rejected, what has changed the situation?<br />
PM: I think essentially the difference is one of meaning rather than<br />
substance one of words rather than substance that is, it is always a<br />
matter for PNG, say, as with other countries to ratify their code of<br />
conduct. What they are saying is they couldn't do that before this<br />
meeting. They could do it later, but they were quite happy to endorse<br />
the code of conduct and accept that they are endorsing it for ratification<br />
which they will do, I think, in the second half of this year.<br />
J: Prime Minister, there was some recent tension between Australia and<br />
PNG over aid and other issues, you had bilateral talks with Sir Julius </p>
<p>1 Chan yesterday did you make any progress there in terms of the shift<br />
from budget aid to program aid?<br />
PM* It was never raised. We have now made a fairly heavy change over<br />
timne in the shift between budget aid and program aid. We hope that is<br />
going well, that is we are able to deliver decent services on the ground<br />
for the dollars we provide. It may be a matter in PNG politics, but it was<br />
not raised with me by the Prime Minister. So, as far as I am concerned<br />
and I would have told him this if it had been raised that the shift is going<br />
to continue under the agreement.<br />
J: Was Ok Tedi discussed?<br />
PM: No, not at all.<br />
J: ( inaudible)<br />
PM: You'll find something about that in the communique and I think that VAIl<br />
say succinctly what we are essentially saying is we are going to<br />
examine that over the course of the next year and report back.<br />
ends </p>
<p>FORUM LEADERS' STATEMENT ON NUCLEAR TESTING<br />
LEADERS EXPRESS THEIR EXTREME OUTRAGE AT THE RESUMPTION OF FRENCH<br />
NUCLEAR TESTING IN THE PACIFIC. FORUM LEADERS AGAIN DEMAND THAT FRANCE<br />
DESIST FROM ANY FURTHER TESTS IN THE REGION AND CALL ON OTHER COUNTRIES<br />
ALSO TO SEEK TO PERSUADE FRANCE TO CEASE TESTING.<br />
THE FORUM ALSO NOTE THAT THE PAINFUL MEMORIES RESULTING FROM NUCLEAR<br />
TESTING CONDUCTED IN THE REGION A HALF-CENTURY AGO STILL HAUNT MANY<br />
IA PEOPLE IN THE REGION.<br />
SHOULD FRANCE CONTINUE ITS TESTING IN THE PACIFIC, THE FORUM WILL REVIEW<br />
FRANCE'S STATUS AS A POST-FORUM DIALOGUE PARTNER.<br />
r A THE OUTRAGE OF THE FORUM MEMBER COUNTRIES IS SO MUCH THE GREATER<br />
BECAUSE OF THE INTRANSIGENCE OF FRANCE, TOGETHER WITH THE PEOPLE'S<br />
REPUBLIC OF CHINA, IN PERSISTING WITH THEIR NUCLEAR TESTS IN THE FACE OF<br />
NOT ONLY THE STRONG VIEWS OF THE PACIFIC REGION, BUT ALSO THE APPEAL OF<br />
THE ASEAN REGIONAL FORUM, AND THE WORLD-WIDE SENTIMENT AGAINST<br />
TESTING. THE DECISIONS BY THE GOVERNMENTS OF FRANCE AND THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF<br />
CHINA TO CONTINUE TESTING ARE COMPLETELY CONTRARY TO THE UNDERTAKING<br />
AT THE NUCLEAR NON-PROLIFERATION TREATY ( NPT) REVIEW AND EXTENSION<br />
CONFERENCE ON 11 MAY 1995 TO EXERCISE " UTMOST RESTRAINT" IN NUCLEAR<br />
TESTING PENDING THE COMPLETION OF NEGOTIATIONS ON A COMPREHENSIVE TEST<br />
BAN TREATY ( CTBT) THAT WOULD BAN NUCLEAR TESTS FOR ALL TIME.<br />
THE CONCLUSION OF A CTBT IS AN OBJECTIVE OF THE HIGHEST IMPORTANCE FOR<br />
r THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY. LEADERS THEREFORE WELCOME THE RECENT<br />
ANNOUNCEMENTS OF THE UNITED STATES AND FRANCE TO SUPPORT A TRULY<br />
coMPREHENSIVE CTBT. THEY CALL ON ALL MEMBERS OF THE INTERNATIONAL<br />
COMMUNrY, AND ESPECIALLY THE NUCLEAR WEAPON STATES, TO SPARE NO<br />
E TTiHNSURTiE CONCLUSION OF A CTBT NO LATERTHAN 1996.<br />
r </p>
<p>IN THE SPIRIT OF THIS RENEWED EMPHASIS ON GLOBAL DISARMAMENT, LEADERS<br />
CALL ON FRANCE TO SIGN AND RATIFY THE PROTOCOLS OF THE SOUTH PACIFIC<br />
NUCLEAR FREE ZONE ( SPNFZ) TREATY. THEY URGE THE UNITED STATES AND<br />
THE UNITED KINGDOM TO DO LIKEWISE, NOTING THAT THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF<br />
CHINA AND RUSSIA HAVE ALREADY SIGNED THE PROTOCOLS.<br />
THE DECISION OF THE GOVERNMENT OF VANUATU TO SIGN THE SPNFZ TREATY AT<br />
THE FORUM IS WARMLY WELCOMED.<br />
THE FORUM WILL CONTINUE TO OPPOSE NUCLEAR TESTING AT EVERY OPPORTUNITY<br />
INCLUDING AT THE UNITED NATIONS GENERAL ASSEMBLY.<br />
LEADERS COMMEND THE EFFORTS COMMENCED BY THE FORUM DELEGATION TO<br />
PARIS IN JUNE. THEY THANK THE FORUM REGIONAL ACTION COMMITTEE FOR ITS<br />
WORK IN SUPPORTING THE ACTrIVITIES OF FORUM GOVERNMENTS AND ENDORSE THE<br />
REPORT OF ITS ACTIVITIES PRESENTED TO THE FORUM.<br />
LEADERS WELCOME NEW ZEALAND'S ACTION TO RESUME ITS 1973 INTERNATIONAL<br />
COURT OF JUSTICE CASE AGAINST FRENCH NUCLEAR TESTING AND ITS<br />
ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS IN THE PACIFIC AND COMMEND THE ACTION OF FORUM<br />
MEMBERS SEEKING TO INTERVENE IN THE PROCEEDINGS TO SUPPORT NEW<br />
ZEALAND'S REQUEST TO THE COURT.<br />
LEADERS REITERATE THE CALL BY THE MELANESIAN SPEARHEAD GROUP LEADERS<br />
THROUGH THE LAKATORO DECLARATION AND BY THE SOUTH PACIFIC ENVIRONMErNT<br />
MINISTERS MEETING IN AUGUST 1995 FOR FRANCE TO CLOSE ITS NUCLEAR TESTING<br />
FACILITIES IN THE PACIFIC, EXCEPT AS REQUIRED FOR ENVIRONMENTAL<br />
MONITORING; TO ACCEPT FULL AND EXCLUSIVE RESPONSIBILrrITY FOR ANY ADVERSE<br />
IMPACTS FROM FRENCH TESTING ON THE PACIFIC ENVIRONMENT AND PEOPLE; AND<br />
TO PROVIDE ACCESS TO THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY TO ALL THE SCIENTIFIC<br />
DATA IT HOLDS AND TO THE TESTING SITES THEMSELVES TO ENABLE AN<br />
INDEPENDENT AND COMPREHENSIVE ASSESSMENT OF THE RISKS INVOLVED.<br />
FINALLY, FORUM LEADERS EXPRESS THEIR SINCERE APPRECIATION TO THE PEOPLE<br />
FROM THE REGION AND AROUND THE WORLD WHO HAVE OFFERED THEIR SUPPORT<br />
AND THEIR VOICE TO THE CAMPAIGN AGAINST NUCLEAR TESTING. THEY RENEW<br />
THEIR UNDERTAKING TO TAKE ALL POSSIBLE STEPS TO STOP NUCLEAR TESTING AND<br />
THE PROLIFERATION OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS.<br />
