NETWORK 10 MEET THE PRESS 1130 08-05-94<br />
Subject: INTV Prime Minister Keating<br />
Compere David Johnston: Good morning across Australia, and welcome to Meet The<br />
Press our guest today, the Prime Minister Paul Keating.<br />
Four days after the release of the Government's White<br />
Paper on employment, the dust is starting to settle.<br />
Promising subsidised employment or a training position for<br />
all of the three hundred and fifty thousand long term<br />
unemployed over the next four years, the ambitious six<br />
point five billion dollar jobs package has been described by<br />
the Prime Minister as Labor to its bootstraps.<br />
Immediately lampooned by Doctor Hewson as<br />
Whitlamesque in its excess, and criticised by some as an<br />
election strategy, financial markets endorsed the gloomy<br />
assessment by sending bond rates through the roof a<br />
reaction angrily described by the Prime Minister as<br />
lemming-like and irrational. </p>
<p>Prime Minister:<br />
Compere:<br />
Prime Minister: Dismissing claims of big spending excess, Mister Keating<br />
said the jobs compact will deliver a large bang for the<br />
buck. But just how many bucks will be revealed in<br />
Tuesday night's budget.<br />
Our panel today Paul Bongiorno from Network Ten;<br />
Michelle Grattan, The Canberra Times, and Geoffrey<br />
Barker from the Melbourne Age.<br />
Welcome Mister Keating to the programme.<br />
Thank you, David.<br />
Well now, the dust has had time to settle a little. Are you<br />
happy with the way the White Paper has been received, or<br />
are you still angry with the financial markets?<br />
Oh no. I think we've had probably as good a reception to<br />
this document as we've had to any of the budgets or most<br />
statements the Government's done over a decade. And, I<br />
mean, the last editorial I read was the Sydney Sunday<br />
Telegraph this morning, which said it was a bold step<br />
which deserves community support.<br />
I think that's pretty typical of the reaction, and I'm very<br />
happy about that, because I'm happy about the fact that the<br />
media and the community and the business community in<br />
particular has been very warm to the idea of including the<br />
unemployed in Australia's progress. </p>
<p>Paul Bongiorno:<br />
Prime Minister: Treasurer Paul Keating used to say that the deregulated<br />
financial markets would keep Governments honest. Has<br />
Prime Minister Paul Keating changed his tune?<br />
No, no. No Paul, no, no. I mean, what's happened I<br />
think people need to understand what's happened. First of<br />
all there's the business community, which is actually<br />
employing people, and they've been very supportive of<br />
this. Then there's the financial markets which are selling<br />
securities. So, in terms of the impact of this with the real economy,<br />
it's the business community's reaction that we look for,<br />
and that was a very positive one.<br />
What's happened with the financial markets is simply this.<br />
From about the end of 1989, early 1990, we had interest<br />
rates at eighteen percent, and they fell to four and three<br />
quarters in one percentage point falls from eighteen<br />
down to four and three quarters.<br />
Every point drop was an increase in the capital value of a<br />
bond. One point down, one up. So each way down it was<br />
a picnic for bond buyers and bond holders.<br />
They've now got a belly full of bonds, and they're at a<br />
point where now interest rates have bottomed and in some<br />
places in the world are going up. Where the world<br />
economy is picking up, where they think inflation over the </p>
<p>Compere: Prime Minister: longer run may pick up not in Australia necessarily, but<br />
the world. So they're saying well the party's over, the<br />
capital improvements are finished in bonds. We're now<br />
looking at a prospect of interest rates rising so the thing<br />
to do is get out of them.<br />
So what we're going to see is a lot of bond selling which<br />
has nought to do with the White Paper, nought to do with<br />
the budget simply the fact that the eighteen percent to<br />
four percent beano, which the bond market has had now,<br />
predictable profits for eighteen months to two years has<br />
finished. And bond holders are now saying well that<br />
picnic is over, let's get back now into equities and other<br />
things so they'll sell them.<br />
But wasn't their question over funding, over the funding<br />
of the plan?<br />
No, not really, no. Look, this sell off would have been on<br />
no matter whether there was a White Paper, a budget or<br />
no White Paper or a budget. Because it was sparked by<br />
the US Federal Reserve taking the rates from three percent<br />
to three seven five. And the US bond market is saying<br />
well look the big interest rate reductions in the US,<br />
they're over too. And what we're really seeing in the US<br />
is a pick up in the economy, so therefore we the bond<br />
holders believe we're going to be in a position of rising<br />
interest rates and therefore capital losses. So they try and<br />
get out. </p>
<p>Michelle Grattan:<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
Geoff Barker:<br />
Prime Minister: But there has been worry about funding. Are you<br />
convinced that Tuesday's budget will provide a convincing<br />
answer on the funding question, or do you have a big<br />
selling job ahead of you?<br />
No. Look, the government I don't think has any peer in<br />
the OECD in terms of fiscal consolidation. And one of<br />
the reasons why Australia is growing at four percent plus<br />
is the fact that fiscal policy was consolidated in the<br />
eighties, and we did have a chance to wind it out in the<br />
recession, and hence cushion on the shock and restart the<br />
economy. So we've had, I think, a great record as budget managers,<br />
and I think next week will simply confirm that.<br />
Prime Minister, with the economy in recovery, do you<br />
expect next Tuesday's budget to be a good news budget,<br />
or how do you think the community and the markets will<br />
react to Tuesday's budget?<br />
I think well. I think well, because the budget shows that<br />
we'll be well and truly within the target of one percent of<br />
GDP by ' 96/' 97, and Aust will go back into surplus in the<br />
balance of the nineties.<br />
Now, as far<br />
comparable advantageous as I know there'll be virtually no other<br />
country, or very few, in that very<br />
fiscal position. </p>
<p>We'll be back on that good news point after this break.<br />
commercial break So, will next Tuesday's budget be a good news budget<br />
Michelle.<br />
Michelle Grattan:<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
Michelle Grattan: Mister Keating, how would you characterise the thrust of<br />
this budget?<br />
I think the budget is principally a macro-economic<br />
document. There will still be substantial, some substantial<br />
policy in it, but of course a great block of the policy has<br />
been delivered last week, and the numbers for that will be<br />
consolidated in the budget.<br />
So instead of the budget being largely a policy document,<br />
as well as an accounting document, it'll be more of the<br />
latter, and less of the former by virtue of the fact that we<br />
separated the two statements.<br />
So, I think the budget will be seen as a positive step by the<br />
business community towards the target the Government has<br />
set for itself, and give Australia a quite advantageous<br />
position. And a good news budget? Can I press you on that?<br />
Compere:: </p>
<p>Prime Minister:<br />
Geoff Barker:<br />
Prime Minister: Well I think you'll probably have to wait on that. I<br />
certainly don't think it's going to be a budget which is<br />
going to be in any way gloomy.<br />
Given that you've separated out the jobs compact, will the<br />
budget have much more in it in terms of Labor's vision for<br />
social and economic reform? You said it would please the<br />
business community will it also please the people who<br />
have less in this society?<br />
Well I think yes, yes the answer to that's yes. But the<br />
bulk of what we wanted to do, in terms of unemployment,<br />
we did last week.<br />
Could I just say, in terms of the last election, the<br />
government said it would do the following things. It<br />
would provide cuts it's done so. First tranche is paid.<br />
It would legislate for Mabo it's done so after a very<br />
large debate. It's introduced a Home Child Care<br />
Allowance, the Generalised Child Care Rebate, and now<br />
in fulfilment of the commitment to the unemployed, we've<br />
introduced the White Paper. And we're also bringing the<br />
budget down as promised.<br />
So, I mean, Government's come in for criticism for not<br />
meeting election commitments. This government has met<br />
the major election commitments. </p>
<p>Paul Bongiorno:<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
Paul Bongiorno:<br />
Prime Minister: There's a lot of discussion over just how firm your<br />
forecasts are going to be in this budget. Some people say<br />
that already the figures in the jobs paper are a bit rubbery.<br />
I mean, what is your attitude to forecasts on inflation,<br />
employment, and growth? Do you see it as something that<br />
you should be more up about, rather than down?<br />
No, I think they're all just best estimates, but the<br />
important point is that on inflation, which is an important<br />
indice in this country, as in all countries. I think we're in<br />
a fairly good position.<br />
With that , CPI-that came out a couple of weeks ago, the<br />
CPI is now around two, or just under two percent point<br />
four percent for the quarter. The underlying rate is a little<br />
bit higher, but by and large, the portents there are very<br />
good. On the wages front, in terms of wages flexibility,<br />
in terms of prices, in terms of productivity you see the<br />
prospects for growth-<br />
But on Thursday you spoke in terms of growth at four and<br />
a half to five percent, and we've had two leading<br />
forecasters since then say that's two ambitious.<br />
Well the Australian economy grew on average at four and<br />
a half percent between 1983 and 1989. Over six years, six<br />
to seven years, it grew at an average rate of around four<br />
and a half percent.<br />
IF-. </p>
<p>Michelle Grattan:<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
Michelle Grattan:<br />
Prime Minister: Now, we've got now much more competitive product<br />
markets with low tariffs; we've got a much more flexible<br />
labour market than the rigid one we had then; we've<br />
already broken the back of inflation, that's down to low<br />
numbers; we've got the lowest interest rates in thirty<br />
years; we've got a very high profit share; a thirty three<br />
percent corporate tax rate. If all of that doesn't add up to<br />
doing as well as we did in that six years, well there's<br />
something wrong with all of those influences. And<br />
nothing can be wrong them.<br />
How tough are you going to be with the minor Parties<br />
after this budget? Do you take the attitude they've had<br />
their say during the consultative process, and that's it? Or<br />
will you give them further ground if you need to in the<br />
post budget period?<br />
Well I think we've got a good relationship with the minor<br />
Parties, and we have in this budget round I think done<br />
something new, and that is that we have consulted the,<br />
they've given us their views on what should be included in<br />
the budget this has never happened in Australian federal<br />
history-But what happens if their Oliver Twist like, calling for<br />
more when they see the document?<br />
Well that's got to be just weighed up. I think, I mean,<br />
this invariably happens, but I can't predict what the </p>
<p>Democrats or the Greens or any of the Independents in the<br />
Senate might say.<br />
Compere: Did you have compromise with them much?<br />
Prime Minister: I don't think so, but I think there's a lot that the<br />
Democrats and the Greens in particular, and Senator<br />
Harradine, would find to support in the White Paper, I<br />
mean generally. I mean, if you look at the Parenting<br />
Allowance, which will put a hundred and thirty three, up<br />
to a hundred and thirty three dollars a week in the hands<br />
of a supporting mother I would have thought for<br />
instance Senator Harradine would support a measure like<br />
that, as I think probably the Democrats and the Greens<br />
would. I mean, there are many things there. By and large I don't<br />
think anyone should assume there's some sort of<br />
adversarial situation there, because I think the policy<br />
outcomes are pretty much heading in the directions most<br />
of these Parties think they should be.<br />
Compere: We'll continue on Meet The Press after this break.<br />
commercial break So, if it's a good news budget, could it possibly be an<br />
election budget Paul.<br />
I </p>
<p>Paul Bongiorno:<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
Michelle Grattan:<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
Compere: Prime Minister: Well Prime Minister do you get the impression that neither<br />
the Opposition nor the minor Parties really want an<br />
election soon, and probably your budget will get through<br />
for that? But does that tempt you to perhaps go to the<br />
people sooner rather than later?<br />
No, I don't think so. No thinking about it certainly<br />
not. This is, Labor Governments residing over a growth<br />
economy with a prospect of doing a lot of important things<br />
like Mabo, like the White Paper these are opportunities<br />
that shouldn't be missed or lightly passed up.<br />
So are you committed to full term March ' 96?<br />
Well, I'm committed to seeing, sensibly seeing the balance<br />
of this term out. That's not a matter of cutting off any<br />
options the Prime Minister enjoys in this system, but<br />
certainly, I mean I'm not saying to day, to the month, day<br />
or week no-one ever does but by and large I don't<br />
believe that the Parliament should run half its course and<br />
have an election for what point-<br />
But this White Paper is electorally important the success<br />
or failure of it, isn't it, really?<br />
No, I think the White Paper is a very altruistic attempt to<br />
give Australia the kind of society that many other western<br />
countries have passed up, and that's an inclusive one-</p>
<p>Compere: Prime Minister:<br />
Geoff Barker: If it fails you don't think that's important I mean for<br />
your electoral chances at the next election?<br />
Well I don't think it'll fail. But I think it's important that<br />
there is a notion of inclusion, that people do not feel<br />
alienated, cast to one side, forgotten and in a callous<br />
way the rest of us move on and say well they carried the<br />
brunt of economic change.<br />
I think this is a statement about Australian values; about a<br />
fair go; about egalitarianism so that we move along as<br />
a society inclusively.<br />
That's what the White Paper's about it's done just after,<br />
a year after the election. This is not set up in the cycle<br />
of an election, it's not six months before an election, it's<br />
not there for all of that and I think it is because of that,<br />
its timing and its content, that the community has given it<br />
a warm reception.<br />
So this is a good thing, we feel better about the fact that<br />
these people are not going to be forgotten.<br />
Prime Minister, part of the funding for the jobs compact<br />
will involve the sale of some government business<br />
enterprises airports have been mentioned and<br />
certainly that seems to have left the Left of the Party fairly<br />
angry. Are you confident the Party's behind you on that<br />
sell-off and others that might be in mind? </p>
<p>Prime Minister:<br />
Michelle Grattan:<br />
Prime Minister: Well, I mean, the Labor Party in policy terms and<br />
ideological terms is more united now, Geoff, than I've<br />
ever seen it in my lifetime.<br />
When you look at the things that we've accomplished in<br />
the last few years, I mean getting back to growth we've<br />
had nearly a quarter of a million job growth in the last<br />
year; a huge piece of cultural and property law like Mabo,<br />
which is a great breakthrough for Australia as a society<br />
and for Aboriginal people, and something which the Left<br />
would feel that it was important they had a role in, and we<br />
did. The same is true on the White Paper on unemployment-<br />
But you are pre-empting the conference, aren't you-<br />
Can I just say, Michelle, now these are very Labor<br />
outcomes. I mean, these are very Australian, good<br />
Australian societal outcomes but they're very, of their<br />
essence, Labor outcomes and I should imagine people<br />
on the Left would feel as though they've been part of a<br />
process which has been significant and important.<br />
And therefore I think these other matters like asset sales,<br />
and we've had some big debates now, as you know, about<br />
QANTAS, TAA, Australian Airlines which is now<br />
incorporated into QANTAS these sorts of debates. I<br />
mean, the competitor to Telecom in 1990-</p>
<p>Michelle Grattan:<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
Paul Bongiorno:<br />
Prime Minister: But how do you answer the point, Mister Keating, that this<br />
sale of the airports will be approved by the Parliament<br />
before it goes to the ALP conference, which should<br />
approve it in terms of policy, which is required to<br />
approve-Well there's always, I think there's always these, you<br />
know, cart and horse things but by and large the<br />
directions are pretty right, and I don't think any wise<br />
Cabinet gets beyond Party or community opinion.<br />
Well the Left are meeting in Canberra today, and they're<br />
telling us that the factions are not all that happy, and<br />
they're going to try and fight this in the Caucus. What's<br />
your message to them today?<br />
Well I don't expect complete harmony on every issue of<br />
policy, but if you take the Left of the Australian Labor<br />
Party, and look at the Left of the British Labour Party or<br />
the political Left of Germany and these other countries<br />
who would do anything like the White Paper in western<br />
world terms? I mean, who would take on a matter like<br />
Mabo you know, such a huge issue as that?<br />
I think that the Left feel very comfortable, by and large,<br />
about the direction of policy. And yes, there'll be a little<br />
bit of chattering about this sort of stuff, but you've got to<br />
see it in the bigger context. </p>
<p>Comere: We'll continue with the Prime Minister in just a moment.<br />
commercial break Our guest on Meet the Press, Paul Keating.<br />
Geoff Barker:<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
Michelle Grattan:<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
Michelle Grattan: Prime Minister, two important issues at the Labor Party<br />
conference in September will be quotas for, specific quotas<br />
for women Labor MPs, and the Party's uranium policy.<br />
Will you support a motion for a specific number of women<br />
MPs within a specific time, or do you agree with those in<br />
the Labor Party who say that's sacrifices merit for gender<br />
equality? Well I think that's complex issue. The underlying thing is<br />
that there is not enough women in public life, and not<br />
enough on our side of public life, and we want to improve<br />
it. And we're only going to improve it by some<br />
affirmative programme, and it is that which the Party's<br />
now considering.<br />
So what about quotas, though? Are you willing to go<br />
down that path?<br />
Well this is an organisational matter that I can't simply<br />
embrace or dictate, but-<br />
But you can have a view.<br />
Compere: </p>
<p>Prime Minister:<br />
Compere: But I think that we will have to decide for an affirmative<br />
programme, to leave it other than to the vagaries of the<br />
selection systeme in each state-<br />
It would have to be fifty-fifty, wouldn't it?<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
Geoff Barker:<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
Michelle Grattan:<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
Michelle Grattan: Well, that will not happen quickly. But it's a matter of I<br />
think the Party getting focused up to the task, and women<br />
are being, as candidates, coming forward and being in a<br />
position to take the selections for House of<br />
Representatives-How about uranium policy, liberalisation of uranium<br />
policy? Do you think that's on, would you support further<br />
liberalisation? I haven't, Geoff to be frank with you, I haven't thought<br />
about this for years, and I didn't know, I mean other than<br />
the sort of protemps things that come on you probably<br />
know more than I do about this. But it's coming up at our<br />
conference. But it usually does.<br />
It usually does, and it usually goes-<br />
Isn't it time to liberalise the policy again? </p>
<p>Prime Minister:<br />
Michelle Grattan:<br />
Prime Minister:<br />
Paul Bongiorno: Well I don't know. There's been an oversupply of<br />
uranium in the world. I don't know that the big issue<br />
has always been whether you can develop the large mine<br />
in the flood plain of the East Alligator River of Kakadu.<br />
What's your feeling?<br />
Well I've always, frankly, had great reservations about it.<br />
That is, you know, how you handle a tailings problem<br />
from such a large deposit in a region like that.<br />
Now once we decided upon Roxby Downs years ago,<br />
effectively we opened up uranium mining in Australia<br />
because of the huge bulk and the sheer size and scale of it.<br />
So whether it's one big one in South Australia or some<br />
little ones somewhere else really in a sense doesn't matter.<br />
So to that extent I don't think an x number of mines policy<br />
is something that should be holy grail.<br />
But then it gets back to the Pan-Continental site Jabiru<br />
is it? Or Jabiluka? I can't remember which one it is now<br />
and I think that's just got big engineering and<br />
environmental problems.<br />
There is one issue that you haven't given a lot of thought<br />
to, and that's the republican one. It's now May we<br />
were expecting the response from the Cabinet to the<br />
Republican Paper earlier in the year. Has that been put on<br />
hold? </p>
<p>Prime Minister:<br />
Compere: Prime Minister:<br />
Compere: Only to the extent that the White Paper has been such a<br />
time consuming, Ministerially intensive process.<br />
Remember this, Paul, we're doing something novel this<br />
year we've never done before we're having a budget<br />
before the beginning of the financial year.<br />
So Ministers, and they're often the same Ministers, have<br />
been involved in the ad-hoc process of the White Paper<br />
and the budget. So from the last week of January we have<br />
done nothing but those things. And we really haven't been<br />
in a position to be considering the Turnbull Paper, or take<br />
opportunities to proselytise on the issue.<br />
Mister Keating, Robert Ray on this programme a few<br />
weeks ago spent some time talking about your successor.<br />
Was talk of your replacement a bit premature, do you<br />
think? Well I think it is. But again, I've always taken the view,<br />
I've said to people privately, I don't mind saying publicly,<br />
no-one will have to knock on my door to carry me away.<br />
And I think the life cycle of government should be more<br />
than the life cycle of the leader or Prime Minister or<br />
Premier as the case may be.<br />
So what do you have in your mind, after say the next<br />
election that you think you'll win, of course. How long<br />
after that do you think you'll stay? </p>
<p>Prime Minister:<br />
Compere: I think that from this point of view, I think you should<br />
take three years at a time. I mean, I like to have the next<br />
Parliament, and set the Labor Party up. I mean, the one<br />
thing I think, the thing that gives me great pleasure out of<br />
this is the zest and energy in the Cabinet room. I mean,<br />
everyone's jockeying for speaking positions, every view is<br />
contested. I mean, papers are well prepared, it's got so<br />
much energy.<br />
And that big change after the election in personnel has<br />
been a tremendous fillip to the Federal Parliamentary<br />
Labor Party, and I think it speaks volumes for turnover<br />
freshness. But it will take a while before they turn me<br />
over. And on that point we'll leave it. Thank you very much<br />
for your time this morning.<br />
Prime Minister: Good.<br />
Compere: Our guest today has been the Prime Minister Paul Keating.<br />
Thanks to our panel Paul Bongiomno, Michelle Grattan and<br />
Geoff Barker. Til next week, goodbye from Meet The<br />
