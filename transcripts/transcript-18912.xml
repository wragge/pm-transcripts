<p>Prime Minister Julia Gillard will travel to Cambodia from 19 to 20 November to attend the 7th East Asia Summit (EAS) in Phnom Penh.</p>
<p>East Asia is vital to Australia's political, economic and strategic interests.  Australia is a founding member of the EAS, whose membership represents half the world's population and over a third of its GDP.</p>
<p>The Summit is the region's key forum for discussion of political, security and economic issues of common concern with the aim of promoting stability and economic prosperity in the region.</p>
<p>During the Summit, the Prime Minister will join other leaders in launching negotiations for the Regional Economic Comprehensive Partnership, a proposal for a free trade area which includes the 10 ASEAN countries plus Australia, New Zealand, China, Japan, the Republic of Korea and India, and will hold a number of bilateral meetings with key regional leaders.</p>
