TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
INTERVIEW WITH JOHN MACKENZIE, RADIO 4CA, CAIRNS<br />
18 APRIL 1995<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
JM: With me in the studio today is the Prime Minister of Australia, Paul<br />
Keating. Good morning and welcome.<br />
PM: Good morning John good to be here.<br />
JM: You are up here frequently I would imagine 2 or 3 times a year there<br />
has got to be somethng about the place. I notice today front page of<br />
the Cairns Post we are considered to be the best place in Australia to<br />
live, as far as capital cities are concerned you have had the message<br />
for a couple of years now?<br />
PM. I have. And I think one of the reasons, of course, is the climate, and<br />
the easy-going nature of the place. But, whether you are wealthy or<br />
relatively poor, you can still enjoy the good weather and this is the<br />
difference between living In a really nice temperate place than a cold<br />
place. Here, nature Is available to everybody, and that Is the great<br />
strength of It. It is also a growth area, and there Is an excitement<br />
about Far North Queensland that there wasn't 6 or 8 or 10 years ago,<br />
and by and large, people are doing it well up here that is, they are<br />
developing the place well, sensibly and keeping the best things the<br />
rainforests, the core tourism assets, but at the same time developing a<br />
strong commercial hub. So, it's a good place to come, and I am quite<br />
sure It's a good place to live. I'm not surprised at that finding, at all.<br />
JM: You had a crack at the hill slopes last time you were up here, and<br />
when you left Tom Pyne reloindered by saying next time he's going to<br />
have a crack at the hill slopes, tell him to bring his wallet with him.<br />
PM: Tom's a good fellow, but it is all a matter of taste rather than wallets.<br />
Anyone who carves the side out or a hillside to put a brick veneer up<br />
there, ought to be severely rebuked. </p>
<p>18. Apr .95<br />

JM; I Well, Tom would like a buy back scheme.<br />
PM: In fact, we have got... . the largest buy back scheme we have got<br />
running was the money I put In the last Budget $ 24 million scheme<br />
to buy back the land in the Hole in the Heart of the Daintree: that subdivision<br />
In the Daintree, which Joh put through in the 70s, and that<br />
threatens, of course, one of the core tourism assets of Cairns and the<br />
surrounding area and that is the Daintree rainforest. If the power<br />
cable had crossed the river, you would have seen a town develop<br />
there and it would have made an absolute mess of the Daintree, so in<br />
terms of bringing your wallet with you, I brought a $ 24 million wallet to<br />
that one. By the way, the Queensland Government is supporting us<br />
here dollar for dollar on that Wayne Goss and I worked this out<br />
together to try and save the Daintree. But the Daintree is one of the<br />
great assets, and of course, that came on top of the $ 86 million that I<br />
provided as Treasurer to Graham Richardson when the thing was first<br />
declared. But Itis one of the great, great places of Australia as a<br />
consequence, so we have . and can I just say that I gave Mike<br />
Berwick $ 9 million for the road the sealed road up to the Daintree-so<br />
I had my wallet out again then.<br />
JMV: Have you had a drive along that yet?<br />
PM:-I have, and 1 think they have done a tremendous job on the road and<br />
the shoulders, and of course, they are putting the native species of<br />
trees back, and Peter Dodd who is with me In the studio we went up<br />
there last time I was here and had a look around, and the important<br />
thing is that when the heavy rains come, the shoulders don't run away<br />
you don't lose the road. I think It is a good quality road, and putting<br />
those native species of trees along it, really means it is going to give<br />
tourists the effect of a rainforest right through, instead of just a broad<br />
acre dusty place as itw as.<br />
JMV: Even though you spend a lot of time here and you are not actually on<br />
the job, you would get to talk to a lot of people in the tourism industry<br />
you would realise how crucial It is here, but I wonder from your own<br />
perspective how important you see the industry, you know, on the<br />
national scale is your Federal Government really conscious of the<br />
Importance of it?<br />
PM: Can I just say, on behalf of the Government, this is the industry we<br />
largely created before the dollar was floated in 1983, there was no<br />
tourism Industry to speak of, other than small motels etc. You ' look at<br />
Port Douglas for instance, or Cairns, before 1983. Financial<br />
deregulation, the capacity of businesses to acquire funds, the strength<br />
of the stock market through the period, plus the competitiveness of<br />
Australia Australia today Is 40% more competitive than 1983 that<br />
means that every time you sell a touiism place to a foreign person, you<br />
have got a 40% better chance of doing it today than in 1983. That<br />

created a new Industry In Australia International tourism. And I think<br />
It Is very Important to keep that the Labor Party takes a iot of pwld Im<br />
the fact that we created it, and that we have had the support of the<br />
main players In the Industry. And let me just tell you this John, that<br />
recently I had a meeting with Goh Chok Tong, the Prime Minister of<br />
Singapore, and he was saying that he would like his community to<br />
travel more outside of Singapore, and to come to Australia<br />
particularly young people, particularly during their holiday periods<br />
and he is going to be leading a tourism mission to Australia in the<br />
middle of the year. So In other words, I think and I said to him that<br />
Far North Queensland was a place which was accessible by plane<br />
from Singapore to Cairns Is a reasonable short flight and it has<br />
tremendous opportunity for, If you like, tieing a fair bit if you like,<br />
tieing traffic to this part of the country.<br />
JMV: It might all be very fine but we have got the accommodation problem<br />
we have got this problem here now that we are rapidly running out of<br />
beds, and this conjecture almost perpetual as it is about the<br />
prospects of a bed tax Isn't encouraging people to invest in that area.<br />
Can you give us anything definitive on the future of that bed tax.,<br />
PM: Well, John Hewson and the Liberal Party tried to put the bed tax in last<br />
election, with the consumption tax, which would have applied the<br />
to all goods and services, including beds. And we made the point at<br />
the time strongly -that this would be an impost on the tourism<br />
Industry. And given the fact that was emerging from a slow period, one<br />
it could do without. I can only reiterate the sentiment I made on that<br />
occasion.<br />
JMI: All right, I want to stick with local issues now, so we are going to go to<br />
local calls there Is a fair bit of pressure, as you can well Imagine, from<br />
the Southern media on the line this morning saying " can we find out<br />
more on the Carmen Lawrence Issue", but we will get back to that after<br />
some local calls. We have got a few minutes up the sleeve...<br />
PM: That's not even news.<br />
JM: All right. We will go to our first call go ahead.<br />
C: Hello.<br />
PM. How are you there?<br />
JM. You are talking to the Prime Minister.<br />
C: Oh, am I? This is Sandy Warren from the sub-contractor and suppliers<br />
association, Mr Prime Minister.<br />
PM: From the sub sorry?<br />
TEL </p>
<p>TEL: No8. R. p0 .0945 0P: 4.064 /.<br />
4<br />
C: The sub-contractors and suppliers association. We are very, very<br />
concerned at the Bankruptcy Act, and he 0eoDle go bankrupt<br />
and only come back shortly after to get back into business again, and<br />
then promptly go bankrupt again, and they are ripping our people off<br />
by millions and millions of dollars, and causing great hardship. We are<br />
also very concerned as how the Federal Government can give them<br />
half a cent In the dollar tax and say ' Well, you can be back in there<br />
soon and do It again"? 7<br />
PM. I We don't say that these arrangements are largely agreed between<br />
creditors. You have seen the more famous one recently with Mr Bond?<br />
C: Yeah.<br />
PM: It's nought to do with us -I mean, what's to do with us is the<br />
prosecution of wilful acts, or criminal acts, against the companies<br />
code. But where a set of creditors agree with somebody who owes<br />
them money they will accept 10 cents In the dollar, or a cent in the<br />
dollar that person then escapes the bankruptcy. So then that person<br />
he or she is not a bankrupt, and then can carry on.<br />
C-But surely the Government has some control over the Taxation<br />
Department? That's taxpayers money, and nobody asked me if I was<br />
happy with it.<br />
PM: I don't follow your point about the taxpayers?<br />
C: Well, that Taxation Department let him off on half a cent in the dollar,<br />
the other thing is that in many other countries in the world once they<br />
are bankrupt, they stay bankrupt until such time as they have paid all<br />
their bills off.<br />
PMV: Can I just say, Governments try to be sensible and friendly to people<br />
one of the great claims in the past has been the Tax Office has gone in<br />
to take Its claim first, leaving sub-contractors and other people like<br />
yourself out in the cold. Now, that's been changed over the years, so if<br />
the Tax Office if you like comes to a discussion amongst other<br />
creditors, and there is a scheme of arrangement which everybody<br />
agrees to, well then the person then escapes the bankruptcy. ft's a<br />
matter, really, of how hard cend how little if you like people will take<br />
from somebody who Is In this circumstance. I don't really think that the<br />
Government can go and say " now, this person will be a bankrupt<br />
forever"...<br />
JM: We will have to move on we have got a few other people....<br />
PMV: Mind you, there would be plenty of candidates for it, I can assure you.<br />
I appreciate'the call.<br />
JMV: Go ahead. TEL 18. Apr .95 </p>
<p>TELS:. Apr. 95 0: 46 No. 004 P. 05/ 1<br />
C: Hello?<br />
PM: How are you there?<br />
C: How are you? It's Steve here. I'm Ju st ringing up about the Oyster<br />
Point development do you know what's going on here, because I was<br />
born In Cairns and brought up In North Queensland and I think it's<br />
shocking that Keith Williams should be allowed to build that resort<br />
there. Do you know what is happening In the project with that?<br />
PM: Well, the Commonwealth because it's got heritage implications we<br />
are going out of our way to see that... . you know there was originally a<br />
clearing away of some of this area some years ago...<br />
C: Yeah.<br />
PM. . and it was left in a very unsatisfactory state, including the clearing<br />
away of the mangroves. Mr Williams is seeking to build this project,<br />
but he will build it with the only with the the clearing of these kelp<br />
beds and the rest will be done with scientific evaluation and monitoring<br />
under the Commonwealth responsibility. Now, John Faulkner the<br />
Environment Minister has made that abundantly clear. So, given the<br />
fact that the Queensland Government too doesn't want to see a repeat<br />
of the island development Hamilton Island or anything like it, which<br />
Joh permitted In the 70s, the weights are on Mr Williams to produce<br />
something which is far more environmentally pleasing, and does<br />
justice to this wonderful place Hinchinbrook Island. Now, the<br />
Queensland Government has taken principal responsibility for It but<br />
we are in there looking after our responsibilities .( tape failure)., world<br />
heritage areas.<br />
JM: We are going to move straight on go ahead.<br />
C: Hi John, its Kelly ( inaudible) here and I would like to speak to Mr<br />
Keating.<br />
PM. Yes how are you?<br />
C: Paul, look, I'm just wanting to ask a question about vertical integration<br />
could you explain to us what actually it is?<br />
PM: What do you mean vertical integration In respect of any one thing, or<br />
what does the concept mean?<br />
C: We are talking about the tourism Industry, you know, like you say for<br />
example, at Cairns Central School, a Singapore company bought the<br />
site, and they are going to build a hotel there, and perhaps Singapore<br />
Airlines Is going to fly people In a couple of years here to have<br />
holidays here like you just said about the students travelling?<br />
TEL </p>
<p>I: 16 . Ap r 0: 4o No Uu4<br />
PM. In relation to...<br />
C: Will they book their hol idays In Singapore, and pay for them there, or<br />
how will our economy benefit from the sale of Cairns Central School?<br />
PM: The economy benefits many people try to have what is called these<br />
vertically Integrated arrangements, where they own the tourism<br />
property, they own the buses, they own fth gift shops, they own if you<br />
like the whole kit and caboodle.<br />
C: Right.<br />
PM: But people do have to fly In, they fly in on all sorts of airlines<br />
Including Australian owned airlines...<br />
C: Right.<br />
P M. A hey use the passenger facilities, they do end up spending money<br />
outside the ( inaudible) resorts, so I think the whole notion of vertical<br />
Integration Is a bit overdone. It's like, for instance, if you look at the<br />
Shippan and Mitsui ownership of Mirage Port Douglas, many of those<br />
people who have come from Japan end up in the Daintree or end up<br />
out on the reef and lots of other places...<br />
C: So, ( inaudible) we are going to benefit?<br />
PM; Absolutely. I think....<br />
C: Well wouldn't you think then that a bed tax would probably be a good<br />
idea, so that the Government is gathering more money to compensate<br />
for what they have lost by t people buying their tickets overseas?<br />
PMV: I think the main benefit to Australia comes from the general Gross<br />
Domestic Product that comes from the provision of these services. So<br />
youj Add In n~ tinn:% I pmndur-by making thinge, you add to it by<br />
providing things and that's where the Commonwealth gets the benefit.<br />
It doesn't need a bed tax to get the benefit of tourism<br />
C: you're breaking up, I can hardly hear you.<br />
PM: I'm just saying it doesn't need to get a bed tax for the benefit of<br />
tourism. This Is the point I made to Dr Hewson in the last Federal<br />
election when he wanted to Impose one on the industry.<br />
C: How do you feel about the fact that public assets like Cairns Central<br />
School have been sold to overseas Investors?<br />
PM: Well, I wasn't aware of that but again it depends where the school<br />
populations are and where the assets need to be. It's like the closure<br />
7EL: </p>
<p>ILL-' 7<br />
of hospitals being sold public hospitals sold to private operators. The<br />
reason they have been sold Is because the usage of fth hospital has<br />
changed and the public need has shifted. This may be the case with<br />
the school, I don't know.<br />
J: We've got to move on now go ahead.<br />
C: Good morning, Mr Keating. My name's Angela.<br />
PM: Angela, how you're doing?<br />
C: Not too bad. According to the Cairns Post, this morning you're<br />
opening a JobSkills projec?<br />
PMV: That's true.<br />
C, Why is It that you're on the job creation band wagon up here in the<br />
north now, when previously we've been ignored. You know, Cairns<br />
and the far north region has had one of the highest unemployment<br />
rates in Australia.<br />
PM: No, you've never been ignored, never been ignored. I mean, the very<br />
things I was saying about the core tourism things which Is a very<br />
labour intensive Industry. You do admit that a lot of the jobs that have<br />
come In the last six or eight years have come from tourism as well as<br />
from some of the manufacturing* and agricultural businesses In the<br />
area. And 1 will just mention to you, just in the last year we have spent<br />
something like, we are spending something like about $ 15-20 million<br />
on some of the core tourism assets here, just simply on the<br />
Commonwealth's own account. But the main point is one of the core<br />
reasons for the Government's return to office in 1993 was to restart<br />
growth and employment. And we've done that, and we've had now<br />
560,000 jobs since the election, which is a phenomenal rate of<br />
employment growth that Is around 4 per cent employment growth<br />
since the election. And that's, of course, coming to Queensland as It Is<br />
to most other States. In fact, Queensland's unemployment rate overall<br />
Is lower than most States of Australia.<br />
C: I can't agree with you there, Mr Keating. In February, in the far north,<br />
we had 7,563 unemployed people but yet in March, we have 7,612<br />
unemployed people that's an increase. And you're talking about<br />
tourism ( inaudible).<br />
PM: Can I just say to you, I don't know if those numbers are right, but let<br />
me just make this clear to you. Let me tell you what is clear across the<br />
country. In the last year, 12 months, we've had just on 300,000 job<br />
growth in Australia. It's about three times the western world average.<br />
We've had 560,000 jobs since the last election. And you might<br />
remember at the election, I was saying our target was to get to<br />
500,000 jobs In three years. Our opponents were saying, " oh that's </p>
<p>ILL: I<br />
malarky, don't take any notice of that". Wefll, In fact, we got to 500,000<br />
jobs In two years. We got to 500,000 jobs In two-thirds of the time.<br />
That's spreading right around Australia and again, I think you've got to<br />
look at the seasonal adjustment of these things. If you take the raw<br />
data of any unemployment number like you just did, but not seasonally<br />
adjusted for the seasonal changes, you can always make an argument<br />
out of these statistics. But there's only one direction that<br />
unemployment has been going In Australia In the last two years and<br />
that's down, I'm very happy to say. And this JobSkills project today,<br />
which Peter Dodd and I are opening, Is a $ 1.5 million project to train<br />
135 unemployed North Queenslanders for jobs in the building Industry.<br />
And that comes on top of technical and further education In TAFE, In<br />
vocational education, on top of tertiary education In universities.<br />
That's the sort of things which the Commonwealth Government has<br />
done. I mean, the whole of the North Queensland economy has<br />
changed forever under a Labor Government.<br />
J: We're going to have to move on, I'm sorry, because we have got a<br />
heck of a queue up here. I've got to bring you back to an issue that's<br />
been bubbling on for years In North Queensland that's the future of<br />
the Tully Millstream Hydro-Electric Scheme. We've got a situation<br />
here where the Premier of the State, in exactly the seat you're In, has<br />
said on two occasions he can't see anything wrong with it. We've got<br />
a situation where the Labor Minister here, the Member for Mulgrave,<br />
also can't see anything wrong with It. He's a strong proponent of the<br />
scheme, yet we have this situation where State Government and<br />
Federal Government cannot agree. Wayne Goss' excuse is it's finally<br />
up to Mr Keating's Government In Canberra whether or not we have<br />
the scheme. What's going to happen with it?<br />
PM; I don't know what Wayne's said to you but Wayne and I get a lot of<br />
things done co-operatively. I just mentioned a couple the Daintree<br />
and last week, at the Council of Australian Governments, where he<br />
amongst others and I agreed on the Hilmer competitive changes which<br />
affec the electicity, water, gas systems right across the country. And<br />
we will have an east coast electricity grid as a consequence of all that.<br />
And that means that if there Is a surfeit of power in Victoria, or In New<br />
South Wales, that is piped Into Queensland. In other words, Instead of<br />
having this, if you like, uneconomic abundance of generating capacity<br />
going to waste In some of these States, It will actually be smoothed out<br />
across the grid running from Queensland through New South Wales,<br />
through Victoria to South Australia. That's the core matter and I think<br />
that's the reason why the Queensland Government has had second<br />
thoughts about the Tully Millstream. That Is, It's got World Heritage<br />
connotations about It. Any of these water storage and hydro-eectric<br />
power projects, their economics in the long run Is always subject to<br />
question and given the fact that we have now got the prospect of<br />
having an east coast electricity grid which we have never had before, I<br />
think Queensland, basically, has probably changed Its mind about it.<br />
But again, can I say, it is a matter. the Commonwealth is not the<br />
1 t HP F D U : 410 140 uo,, t' .06/. </p>
<p>9<br />
proponent here. The proponent of any such project would be the<br />
Queensland Government. But as I understand It, John, I think that<br />
Issue has gone off the boll. I mean, I don't have, Wayne Goss has not<br />
raised Tully Millstream with me, I don't think, ever.<br />
J: Yes, It may have gone off the boil down south, but it hasn't gone off the<br />
boil here.<br />
PM: I know, but It depends who's It on the boil with, though? If the<br />
requirement is to bring electricity Into North Queensland to meet the<br />
region's power needs, if that electricity can come more efficiently and<br />
cheaply from the coal deposits of central Queensland or New South<br />
Wales, why is anyone jumping up and down about the Tully<br />
Mill stream?<br />
J: Well, they're jumping up and down partially because they feel we're<br />
vulnerable to cyclones and the contact Is going to be lost. Well, you<br />
talk to people In those cyclones ( inaudible)<br />
PM: Yes, I know, cyclones are strong but I mean, there are lots of places<br />
that have cyclones but they don't lose their power systems and if they<br />
do, you are just as likely to lose the power cables from the Tully<br />
Millstream as you are the power cables from somewhere else.<br />
J: Now, the job scheme $ 1.5 million, 135 north Queenslanders to be<br />
given job opportunities can we have the details of that? We're<br />
running out of time. How It's going to work?<br />
PM: Basically, what we do, we give people six weeks of training at TAFE,<br />
followed by 20 weeks on-the-job training with local employers. So, the<br />
Department of Employment, Education and Training has put this<br />
scheme together with the assistance of the Queensland Master<br />
Builders' Association, the AWU, the Federated Ironworkers, TAFE and<br />
Queensland Construction Training. So, in other words, what we are<br />
trying to do, because we are running into skill shortages in the building<br />
Industry, we're trying to pick up 135 unemployed people to train them,<br />
give them skills, give a subsidy In support from the Commonwealth to<br />
the employers and as a way of moving longer-term unemployed<br />
people. And could I just say to you, John, the last year of those<br />
400,000-odd jobs that we created, a bit over 400,000 In the last year or<br />
so, a bit over a year, 100,000 have gone to the long-term unemployed.<br />
That Is, unemployed people, unemployed 12 months or more. So the<br />
description of a long-term unemployed person Is someone<br />
unemployed 12 months or more. A quarter of the jobs of the last 12<br />
months have gone to them. Now, In the 1980s, for Instance, only say,<br />
7 to 10 per cent of the jobs would have gone to them. So, these labour<br />
market programs such as JobSkiIls the one that I am opening today<br />
with Peter Is actually pulling up the long-term unemployed and giving<br />
them a place back Into the main labour market and getting the skill<br />
Hp r 0 U </p>
<p>complementation and skill formation we are going to need, you know,<br />
particularly In the building industry as the building Industry goes on.<br />
J: One final point because we are running out of time this Is on behalf of<br />
the southern media people, whom 1 know you love..<br />
PM: They're such a sweet bunch.<br />
J: The situation in Western Australia. Obviously pressure would be seen<br />
to be mounting on you here. It's now gone to an issue of the credibility<br />
of Dr Lawrence as against the credibility of Keith Wilson and the<br />
former Minister, Graham Edwards. Whore are you going to draw a line<br />
here? Because Wilson is not backing off, Edwards Is not backing off<br />
ultimately you have got to do something?<br />
PM: Well, no I don't because there's no news In this. There's no new<br />
matter here than there was a year ago, or two years ago. And since<br />
then, we've had a State election in Western Australia and we've had a<br />
Federal by-election. All this stuff came up, drifted up to the top again,<br />
all this material drifted to the top again, during the by-election In which<br />
Carmen Lawrence was elected to the House of Representatives. Now,<br />
the reason it's up this week, John, Is because the Liberal Party has<br />
now irrevocably divided In Western Australian. John Howard has just<br />
had two of his House of Representatives Members knocked off over<br />
there that's Paul Filing and Mr Rocher. They've just lost their seats In<br />
pre-selection battles and they neairly lost a third. So, they are<br />
completely and utterly divided. The Western Australian Liberal Party<br />
is at war with itself, so what they've done is drag this red herring<br />
across the trail and said, " oh here's Carmen Lawrence", and that<br />
happened because Mr Wilson came out and repeated what he said<br />
two years ago. But, what we find Is that a number of Ministers who<br />
were Ministers of the Government of Western Australia at the same<br />
period, support Carmen Lawrence's version of this and do not support<br />
Wilson's. So, the fact of the matter is, I'm afraid John Howard and<br />
here's John Howard talking about an inquiry. This Is the fellow who<br />
along with Ian McLachlan about a month ago, asked questions in<br />
Parliament which he knew to be false, he tried to suggest the Minister<br />
for Aboriginal Affairs had circulated documents from Aboriginal women<br />
when they themselves had circulated them. McLachlan resigned yet<br />
Howard approved the tactic and admitted approving the tactic at their<br />
tactics meeting but didn't resign himself. So, here's somebody calling<br />
for, sort of, higher standards when he should have tendered his<br />
resignation. I mean, if Howard wants any Inquiries, we can have an<br />
Inquiry into his behaviour In the McLachlan affair. I mean, that's a<br />
relevant matter. But the real story, I mean, what Is the story here?<br />
There's only one story the Western Australian Liberal Party Is shot to<br />
pieces. And they think they can smother the trail by talking about<br />
some old, hoary old matter raised two or three years ago with Carmen<br />
Lawrence. n r, -o i Cj vv-r iuj </p>

J: One final point The State Labor Party seems to be concerned about<br />
the high profile of the Mabo Issue and the Republic Issue. They feel<br />
that It's a liability electorally partially, I suppose, for them, bui directly,<br />
they say for you?<br />
PM: No, well, I don't agree with that. There's always people who lack<br />
vision, courage, foresight to understand that what the Government's<br />
doing at the moment Is engendering a steady recovery. And you<br />
notice those fixed Interest rates coming off last week. Westpac<br />
reduced its fixed interest rate by .3 of a per cent, and the National<br />
Australia Bank. We are getting the economy slowing, we are getting a<br />
steady growth. We've got 5 per cent economic growth at the moment<br />
and we've got around 1 to 2 per cent inflation and 4 per cent<br />
employment growth. They're the best conjunction of economic data<br />
perhaps in 30 years. But, life is not just about those things. It's also<br />
about justice for minorities, for disadvantaged people, the sick, the<br />
unemployed, the Aboriginal community, and It's also about holding<br />
your head up in Asia here. Here we are In Cairns, where you have got<br />
people pouring into the place with travel, with tourism, where you've<br />
got business in NQEA selling ships to China and all these other<br />
places, and apparently some people believe we ought to be going<br />
there saying, " oh, by the way, here we are an independent country,<br />
Australia, proud of ourselves, proud of what we achieve, proud of<br />
identity, but just by the way, we're borrowing the monarchy of another<br />
country as our Head of State". I mean, the Chinese and the Thals and<br />
the others say, " what? What are you doing down there? Are you<br />
people for real, or aren't you?" So, this Is not a side matter.<br />
Australia's Identity and our culture are as central to our economic<br />
success as any other economic variable. And the only people that<br />
don't understand are people that have never run a national<br />
government.<br />
J: Prime Minister of Australia, Paul Keating, thank you for your time.<br />
