PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR PPMS 9 DECEMBER, 1976.<br />
ECONOMIC STATEMENT<br />
Throughout this year, the Government has had one clear goal in front of it.<br />
That goal is a sustainable economic recovery a recovery whichwill lead<br />
Australia towards sustained economic growth, and increasing employment<br />
opportunities. A pre-requisite for achieving that goal is the c * ontrol<br />
of inflation. The dominant goal of our whole economic strategy has beenand<br />
remains directed to the control of inflation.<br />
In this statement, I want to set the measures of the last two weeks in<br />
the context of that strategy. A realistic assessment of the impact of<br />
those measures must take into account the effects of policies already<br />
implemented during the last year. These policies have already achieved.<br />
a slowdown in the rate of inflation and in the growth of wages and<br />
salaries.<br />
The increases in each of the last three quarters in the Consumer Price<br />
Index were lower than any increase for two years, leaving aside the<br />
effects of Medibank. In the September Quarter, the increase was 2.2%,<br />
t he lowest since the March Quarter 1973.<br />
Components of the Index show very encouraging trends other price<br />
indicators have also been encouraging. For example, the price index<br />
for materials used in house building rose by 0.5 percent, in Octoberthe<br />
lowest increase since November 1972. Similarly, the price index of<br />
materials used in building other than housing increased by 0.4 percent<br />
in October again the lowest increase since November 1972.<br />
Figures published recently show that Australia's rate of inflation is<br />
now broadly in line with the OECD average. In fact, the Consumer Price<br />
Index expressed as a compound monthly rate of is actually<br />
marginally better than the 0.8% for the OECD countries as a whole during<br />
September. While other indicators are mixed, there are encouraging<br />
signs.<br />
Among these the index of industrial production has firmed since July<br />
and in October was 9 percent above its low point in June ] 975.<br />
Recent figures show that investment spending on new buildings and<br />
structures in manufacturing industry is expected to increase by some<br />
31 percent in the half year to December. Some of the distortions inflicted<br />
on the economy during ] 974/ 75 are eginning to be corrected.<br />
For example, business profitability has grown; the savings ratio has<br />
declimed and the shake-out in stocks appears to have run its course.<br />
Despite this progress, we could not put off facing the problem posed<br />
by our loss of Reserves. </p>
<p>-2-<br />
On coming to off ice, the government faced an exchange rate which I<br />
already susceptible to speculation and uncertainty. In the weeks<br />
immediately following the election in December 1975, several hund--x-d<br />
million dollars of private capital flowed out of the country maK.,-ly<br />
due to a widespread belief that the Australian exchange rate was overvalued.<br />
In the three months to the end of November 1976, the decline escalated<br />
our Reserves fell by over $ 700 million, if official borrowings by the<br />
government in this period are left to one side. The decline in Reserves<br />
continued despite the additional monetary measures of 7 November.<br />
The continued outflow of reserves stemmed from the fact that most<br />
observers in Australia and overseas beli,: -ved that our currency was<br />
overvalued. The week before last, the government's official advisers jointly presented<br />
two options to the government: overseas borrowing of around $ 1,000 million<br />
or immediate devaluation. The Government looked at the se options with<br />
a number of facts in mind.<br />
One central fact was the uncompetitive position of<br />
Australia's export and import-competing industries. In the last six<br />
years wages in Australia's manufacturing industry increased by 130%<br />
compared with 53% in the United States, and 70% in West Germany.<br />
The Industries Assistance Commission estimated that the general<br />
competitiveness of the Australian import competing sector fell some<br />
17% between 1970/ 71 and 1975/ 76.<br />
One drastic consequence of this and related factors is that employment<br />
in Australiaimanufacturing industry fell by almost 100,000 between<br />
May 1974 and the end of June 1976. There has been a growing tendency<br />
for some sections of manufacturing industry to move off-shore to<br />
minimise cost disadvantages. This export of jobs had to cease.<br />
These facts were of deep concern to the Government. They could not<br />
be ignored. Further, uncertainty about the exchange rate was causing<br />
new projects involvi ng overseas investment to be'deferred.<br />
There was continuing and growing belief overseas about the<br />
inevitability of an Australian exchange rate adjustment.<br />
Increasingly, the overwhelming view in international circles was that<br />
the Australian exchange rate was overvalued, and that sooner or later an<br />
adjustment would have to be made.<br />
Throughout this year the Government has done everything possible to<br />
protect the exchange rate, as part of the fight against inflation.<br />
ultimately the point was reached where the rate was no longer<br />
sustainable. By the time this decision was unavoidable we had been<br />
able to bring each of the other major arms of policy to focus<br />
in the fight against inflation. Policies in these areas must now be<br />
tightened further.<br />
In all these circumstances the first option of borrowing around<br />
$ 1000 million, including funds from the IMF presented substantial risks.<br />
A borrowing of this magnitude would not have ended speculation against<br />
the downward movement of the dollar because people were looking as much<br />
at the underlying cost position than the balance of payments position.<br />
.3/ </p>
<p>3-<br />
T9i take just one example: as the chief international economist of<br />
Morgan Guaranty has said: " You simply lost competitiveness because<br />
of the amount of inflation". " This situation has been widely recognised<br />
over the last year"<br />
Since Australia only began in the battle against inflation in December last year,<br />
further borrowings in the situation which had arisen would not have<br />
provided the change in attitudes the government was determined to achieve.<br />
Were that the case the strengthening economic recovery would have been<br />
threatened and the eventual devaluation or further borrowing could well<br />
have been greater.<br />
In these circumstances it would have been nonsense for Australia to have<br />
gone to the I. M. F.<br />
The government was not prepared to put Australia in that position<br />
once we had made the inevitable decision to devalue there were a number<br />
of options ope ' n to us on the extent of devaluation and on the form, of<br />
the new exchange rate system.<br />
We could have moved to a new fixed rate which would, at some<br />
future time perhaps require a further significant alteration in<br />
the exchange rate. A move which, as the devaluation demonstrated,<br />
is. attended by mal-or public concern.<br />
We could have a market determined float which would make.<br />
fluctuations possible on a daily basis, or We-could have an<br />
administered and controlled managemenit of the exchange rate.<br />
A further question requiring very careful consideration was the<br />
magnitude of the initial change in the rate which would be made.<br />
The choice before us was to make a move which would decisively end<br />
further speculation against the downward movement of the dollar, or<br />
a move which would leave the way open for speculation about a<br />
further devaluation perhaps in the not too distant future.<br />
The government took the view that it was essential to end definitively<br />
further speculation against the dollar, and to establish a regime<br />
which would in future permit the exchange rate to adjust smoothly<br />
to changing circumstances.<br />
The decision to devalue by 17 was made after full consultation<br />
with the government's advisers and on the basis of a technical<br />
evaluation of the magnitude required to achieve that result.<br />
The magnitude of the devaluation indicates the seriousness of the<br />
cost disadvantages which had been weighing with increasing heaviness<br />
on Australian manufacturing industry.<br />
It should awaken all Australians to the serious weakness in our economic<br />
situation which will require a concerted national effort to overcome.<br />
It is important that there should be a much wider understanding than now<br />
exists, of the implications of adopting a managed regime<br />
In taking this decision, the government has brought Australia more into<br />
line with the system adopted by other major trading countries.<br />
It needs to be understood that most major countries have tended -to adopt exchange<br />
arrangements that permit more flexibility in rates in response to<br />
changes in economic circumstances. The experience of a number of<br />
countries ( including the United States, Germany, Japan and Canada)<br />
has clearly demonstrated the important role that a managed exchange<br />
.4/ </p>
<p>-4-<br />
r O-e can play in the pursuit of domestic policy objectives. And in<br />
context, it is interesting to note the comments of the I. M. F.<br />
ir. ; Its 1976 Annual Report: " Faced with substantial uncertainty<br />
cr':, rninq future balance of payments developments and exchange rate<br />
t nd aware of the persistence of marked differences among<br />
nt,. 4onal economics, in particular with respect to rates of inflation,<br />
i rest rates and levels of economic activity, as well as of<br />
_ ctural changes, the major industrial countries have continued<br />
to) permit their currencies to float. Indeed, as underlying economic<br />
conditions have continued to differ among countries whose currencies<br />
are floating, frequent exchange rate variations have been a major<br />
form of balance of payment adjustments".<br />
Some people haive expressed surprise that under the new system of a managed<br />
exchange rate the first change in the rate should have occurred so<br />
soon. I regret to say that -this indicates a lack of understanding<br />
of the nature of an administered exchange rate.<br />
Suppose that we had adopted a fully floating exchange rate, under which<br />
it is not unusual for rates to fluctuate daily. If under such a float<br />
the rate had moved upwards on the first day would anyone have suggested<br />
that it should not have done so? Of course not. Under the regime<br />
we have adopted not infrequent changes are likely to occur in the<br />
ordin'ary course of events. That is delibarate. The regime is designed<br />
to avoid the large jumps that have occurred in the past.<br />
That is, indeed, the purpose of adopting a managed exchange rate.<br />
The initial decision was taken in the context of the adoption of<br />
such a system. Critics of the two percent revaluation are tied<br />
to the past. They have not understood the nature of the change<br />
which has been made. For example, some critics have asked why<br />
all the criteria used by the bank in making decisions about the<br />
rate should not be made public.<br />
Such a course would only advance the cause of the speculator.<br />
There is no responsible bank in the world which would give the<br />
precise grounds on which decisions about changes in the rate would<br />
be made, or for those on floating rates, about daily interventions<br />
in the market.<br />
As understanding of the new system grows it will be fully accepted.<br />
Devaluation inevitably means that a number of other difficult<br />
decisions had to be taken. It is a decision with some -inflationary consequences<br />
which can only be countered by a tightening of policy in other areas.<br />
Devaluation makes it more necessary than ever that the anti-inflation<br />
strategy we have pursued throughout this year be persisted with.<br />
In the light of the seriousness of the situation made clear by the<br />
devaluation, that strategy will be pursued with renewed intensity.<br />
The government has already announced a number of measures designed<br />
to counteract to the inflationary impact of devaluation.<br />
On the fiscal side, a review of expenditures aimed at identifying<br />
scope for further savings through the deferment of expenditures has<br />
been put in hand, through the new Department of Finance.<br />
The Government is determined to hold government spending firmly in<br />
check. This is essential to reduce the pressure on monetary policy.<br />
Let me emnphasise that responsible further relief in income tax is<br />
dependent on success in this area.<br />
Further to this, in the preparation of forward estimates of<br />
expenditure for next year now under way Ministers have been<br />
asked to identify any increases in existing programmes so that these<br />
can be looked at separately in the same way as entirely new proposals. </p>
<p>Keeping a very tight grip on government spending continues one<br />
major line of the anti-inflation strategy we have been pursuing<br />
with success. It is an unpleasant reality<br />
that if we want to beat inflation and restore employment opportunities<br />
th-i pressure on na--ional resources from high government spending<br />
az.: i high deficits must be reduced.<br />
: e are widespread calls for further tax cuts, and the gov4rnirnt in<br />
p-nciple accepts this. But if thege tax cuts ar6 to be made<br />
rx. sponsibly, they must be matched by further restraint in government<br />
spending.<br />
This year we have shown that we are prepared to take the tough decisions<br />
required in this area. We intend to demonstrate that determination<br />
again in the coming months.<br />
On the monetary side, action has already been announced to help<br />
ensure that monetary conditions do not become accommodatinig to<br />
increased inflation, but at the same time providing adequate funds<br />
to underwrite economic recovery. Yields on Treasury notes were<br />
raised by 0.5% on 29 November. Subscriptions to the notes have been<br />
encouraging non official holdings are presently at $ 1,400 million.<br />
About half of which is held by the non-bank public.<br />
Subsequent action by the authorities has brought about an adjustment<br />
of similar magnitude-in yields on short-dated bonds, with consequential<br />
adjustment on a diminishing basis of yields on other securities.<br />
The long term bond rate has been increased by 0.3% to 10.5%.<br />
The yield on savings bonds has been increased to 10%. Bank lending<br />
will be monitored so as to prevent any increase in inflationary<br />
pressures. Normal financing requirements of business will be met.<br />
I should not need to emphasise that wages policy has assumed an<br />
even greater importance in the post-devaluation context. To allow<br />
the rate of increase in wage settlements to escalate as a result of<br />
devaluation would be to negate the beneficial effects which<br />
otherwise flow from devaluation for the competitive position of<br />
Australian industry and for employment.<br />
The government will therefore be doing everything within its power<br />
to ensure that any identifiable effects of devaluation on the C. P. I.<br />
do not flow through into wages and salaries.<br />
A number * of major measures adopted during this year have been designed<br />
to protect potentially disadvantaged groups from the costs of inflation<br />
These measures include: the automatic adjustment of pensions for<br />
inflation; the family allowance scheme; and full personal income<br />
tax indexation. These measures which are of continuing benefit<br />
should provide an important support to wage and salary restraint.<br />
There should be a recognition that the important fact to the wage<br />
and salary earner should not be gross income, but final real<br />
disposable income.<br />
The wagdes area is one where-as both the Treasurer and I have emphasised<br />
throughout the year, the government cannot achieve success on its<br />
own. In this area particularly, it will take a commitment by all<br />
sections of the coi:.--unity to take up the fight against inflation and<br />
to restore employme-, t opportunities.<br />
It is somewhat ironic to recall that we were attacked earlier in<br />
the year for arguing as strongly as we did in our first submission<br />
to the Arbitration Commission. Even then, there were those who<br />
predicted that if the government based its policies on economic<br />
commonsense, the result would be confrontation with the unions.<br />
Unfortunately, too much credence has been given to the threats of<br />
extremist union leaders to create further conflict. </p>
<p>6--<br />
In this area there has been a capitulation to threats instead of<br />
recognising economic commonsense. Not enough weight has been given to<br />
the great comnmonsense of the vast majority of rank and file trade union<br />
members who know full well the importance of restraint at this time.<br />
I believe most are fed up as Australians with the disruptive tactics<br />
of a few.<br />
This government will not allow an unreasonable burden in the fight<br />
against inflation to fall on any section of the community including<br />
wage and salary earners. The government has deliberately taken a<br />
number of major measures designed to encourage wage and salary<br />
restraint and to protect potentially disadvantages groups from<br />
the costs of inflation.<br />
These measures include: the automatic adjustment of pensions for<br />
inflation, the family allowance scheme, and full personal income<br />
tax indexation. These measures, which are of continuing benefit<br />
should provide an important support to wage and salary restraint.<br />
As well the government's submissions before the Arbitration Commission<br />
are designed to protect lower income earners. There should be a<br />
recognition that the important fact to the wage and salary earner<br />
should not be gross income, but final real disposable income.<br />
These measures provide a totally reasonable basis for wage and salary<br />
restraint. It is in this total context that the government intends to argue<br />
more strongly before the Commission for recognition of the absolute<br />
importance of wage and salary restraint. Beyond that we will be taking<br />
every step within our power to secure restraint. The Treasurer will,<br />
for example, be discussing the impact of wage levels on the State<br />
Loan programmes with the Premiers at the Loan Council next week.<br />
Quite clearly, with wage restraint, the States can achieve more<br />
effective loan programmes.<br />
This again is part of action to tighten the main lines of the strategy<br />
we have followed throughout this year. In addition to action on<br />
the Budgetary, Monetary and Wages front, action has also been taken<br />
on the prices front.<br />
The Prices Justification Tribunal has been asked to pay special<br />
attention to price increases consequent on devaluation. This will not<br />
be limited to companies technically covered by the Act. The purpose<br />
is to ensure that devaluation is not used as an excuse for unjustified<br />
price increases.<br />
The Government's legislation regarding the P. J. T. will in fact increase<br />
its surveillance capacity and its ability to investigate areas where<br />
there is evidence of price abuse. The P. J. T. will report progressively<br />
to the Minister, and at the end of three months, the Government will<br />
review its request.<br />
In the external area, as a result of the devaluation of the Australian<br />
dollar, the Government has examined the Australian tariff. We have<br />
not made across the board cuts in tariffs but have acted selectively<br />
to reduce inflationary effects arising from the devaluation<br />
without negating the improved competitive position that devaluation<br />
has brought to Australian industry.<br />
This improvement is greatly needed by Australian industry if jobs are<br />
to be created and industries are to be discouraged from going off-shore.<br />
Our decisions on tariffs have been the right decisions taken at the<br />
appropriate time. </p>
<p>-7-<br />
An across the board tariff cut would have been foolish. Selectivity<br />
was necessary and it was therefore imperative to take advice.<br />
In this case, advice could not be sought until after the devaluation<br />
was announced. To have done otherwise would have been imprudent<br />
to say the least it would have extended the circle of people who knew<br />
about the devaluation beyond responsible bounds. Accordingly, the<br />
decisions on tariffs had to be taken after the devaluation.<br />
We were fortunate to have before us, IAC recommendations and we acted<br />
on those recommendations. The government's decisions affect over 900<br />
of the 2,750 items covered by tariffs, the value of the trade in<br />
these items being around $ 2,000 million.<br />
The reason for the selectivity of the tariff reductions, for our<br />
refusal to engage in across the board cuts, is clear. Manufacturing<br />
industry has in recent years had its competitive position eroded by<br />
rising wage costs, a dollar which was until recently overvalued and the<br />
shocks imposed by the Labor Government's 25% across the board tariff cut.<br />
What needs to be understood is that the competitive position of<br />
Australian industry had to be restored. Devaluation will achieve<br />
that. At the same time, we have sought to reduce the inflationary<br />
impact of the decision. Thus following devaluation, the government<br />
has acted with respect to each of the major arms of policy.<br />
On monetary policy: adjustments to interest rates on Treasury notes,<br />
Australian Savings Bonds, and other government securities.<br />
On tariffs: a review of temporary assistance arrangements followed<br />
by measures announced to offset the inflationary impact in certain<br />
areas. On budgetary policy: a further review of government expenditure<br />
aimed at holding real expenditure levels. We will also maintain<br />
pressure on the wages front and we have acted to establish conditions<br />
in which restraint is possible. We intend to persist with our antiinflationary<br />
strategy in full measure.<br />
In the circumstances that Australia faces, it is disappointing to<br />
note that some people who should, by now, know better, continue to<br />
promote policies which only add to inflation. The vast majority of<br />
people realise that it is no longer possible to spend our way out<br />
of inflation and unemployment.<br />
One consistent feature of all the alternatives offered by Labor Party<br />
leaders has been the willingness some might say eagerness to vastly<br />
increase public spending once more, or to pump up the size of the<br />
Federal Budget deficit. The Leader of the Opposition some weeks<br />
ago urged the Government to adopt measures which would increase the<br />
budget deficit by some $ 1 billion. The Premier of Tasmania followed<br />
up with an extravagant 24-point plan. The Premier of N. S. W. outshone<br />
both of them with proposals for almost $ 2 billion more in federal<br />
spending. Others have urged, and continue to urge, tax cuts and<br />
inflationary spending.<br />
It would seem that these proposals are made in total disregard for<br />
their consequences. Each of these proposals, without exception,<br />
would be highly inflationary. The over-riding need of this country<br />
is to conquer inflation. What the Labor Party is proposing would<br />
create yet more inflation. Surely they understand that by now.<br />
Throughout its period in office the Labor Party failed to develop<br />
a credible anti-inflationary policy. All its essays in economic policy 8/ </p>
<p>-8-<br />
this year have been designed to give a further spur to inflation.<br />
Let me explain in plain terms the effects of increasing the government's<br />
deficit in the present context. Every new expenditure mreans a higher deficit<br />
and this must be paid for in some way. Let me explain in plain terms<br />
how this can happen. It can be done by the Reserve Bank printing money<br />
which adds further to inflationary pressures. Secondly, it can be paid<br />
for through higher interest rates, which can lead to a credit squeeze<br />
on business, and a loss of job opportunities. Thirdly, it can be met<br />
by increased taxes, and noone is proposing that. All these alternatives<br />
are inflationary. The clear consequences of further increases in<br />
spending are unacceptable. When people propose policies of this kind,<br />
they must be prepared to follow through the full consequences of these<br />
policies, Unfortunately, this is too often not done. The government reject,.<br />
these as desirable or viable alternatives. Higher government<br />
spending, larger deficits would do nothing whatever to correct the<br />
imbalances in the economy, such an approach would: further damage<br />
the private sector; increase further government's demands on the nation's<br />
resources; it would increase unemployment.<br />
Those who propose to solve our problems through yet higher<br />
government expenditures are in fact whether they know it or not<br />
perpetrating a cruel deception.<br />
Contrast the effects of devaluation. It does not add significantly<br />
to the deficit. It will reduce the burdens on thos sectors which<br />
have been hardest hit by inflation and which have not been protected<br />
by some form of indexed returns, which have not had guaranteed selling<br />
prices for their products. It will create conditions where more jobs<br />
can be created. It will reduce the reason for Australian companies<br />
to move off-shore. Overseas and domestic investment projects will<br />
start moving again.<br />
The real possibilities of increased production for dauestic industries<br />
constitute a substantial benefit from devaluation. Many manufacturing<br />
firms are able to expand their currently underutilised capacity.<br />
At present their fixed costs such as plant and equipment depreciation,<br />
capital costs, rent and salaries represent a high proportion of<br />
total costs. In this situation, increases in demand and production<br />
can produce quite significant reductions in unit costs.<br />
It is worth recalling the words of the 1975 Jackson Committee Report:<br />
" Australian manufacturing industry is in acute financial crisis.<br />
Unemployment is high. Factories are running below capacity Their<br />
profit record and prospects make it hard to raise equity".<br />
The Jackson Report also mentioned the damage caused ID manufacturing<br />
industry by recent adjustments in the exchange rate and the levels<br />
of protection. Our company tax measures have made a contribution<br />
to alleviating this situation, but beyond this, devaluation presents<br />
an opportunity for much needed relef in the problem areas identified<br />
by the Jackson Report. The alternatives to devaluation would have been<br />
massive subsidies or even higher tariffs.<br />
Those who criticise the decision to devalue, fail to appreciate the<br />
continued thrust for more and more tariff protection which carries<br />
its own inflationary impact. In the last two weeks, there has been<br />
a remarkable unwillingness on the part of some commentators<br />
to assess the decisions objectively in their full ramifications. 9/ </p>
<p>-9-<br />
One well known economic commentator writing on the devaluation of<br />
the Australian dollar has made the following points. He stated<br />
firstly: that " most spectators would have felt the devaluation would<br />
have been timed for some time next year. The government, by getting<br />
in early before speculative pressures built up, has avoided a<br />
haemorraging of Australia's international reserves through capital<br />
outflow". Again: " the extent of the devaluation will be<br />
sufficient to convince potential foreign investors in Australia that<br />
there is unlikely to be any further devaluations". Again: the devaluation<br />
" will give a breating space to some Australian industries now suffering<br />
from severe import competition". Again: " the economy is running below<br />
full capacity, so the extra stimulus to domestic demand and employment<br />
will hopefully take up some of the spare capacity....." And finally:<br />
" the devaluationwill give a fillup to business confidence".<br />
There could be no better description of the positive aspects of the<br />
1976 devaluation. But these comments were made about the 1974 devaluation,<br />
which was undertaken in an inflationary context and followed by a number<br />
of inflationary measures. The same commentator condemned the 1976 decision<br />
neglecting his own earlier arguments not to mention the complete<br />
different policy context within which the 1976 decision has been taken.<br />
Many of the statements being made in recent days about the devaluation<br />
are quite out of touch with reality. Wild assertions about interest<br />
rates, the availability of credit and exchange rate confusion are<br />
not based on a considered assessment of what has actually been occurring.<br />
The information available suggests the transformation to the new interest<br />
rate yield curve has been successful. The greater indications of support<br />
for the government treasury notes is encouraging.<br />
A cautious observation of the stock market indicates strengthening<br />
since devaluation. The government welcomes renewed interest from overseas<br />
in portfolio investment. The changes made in the exchange rate<br />
have halted speculation against the dollar and the haemorraging of our<br />
reserves. The massive inflow of capital that some people have predicted<br />
has not occurred.<br />
Much of the criticism failed to understand the changed nature of the<br />
regime. This week's adjustment reflects no more than the success of<br />
the initial move. Commodity markets have also shown continuing<br />
strength. The hysteria and humbug which certain people have tried<br />
to create in relation to the last two weeks is not supportable by<br />
the evidence to hand. The government condemns it.<br />
The government believes that the movements will be seen as responsible<br />
and appropriate.<br />
What a contrast has been provided by some more measured reactions<br />
overseas. In accordance with normal practice the executive board of<br />
the International Monetary Fund has considered Australia's decision<br />
to devalue. The board appreciated the factors behind the decision.<br />
All directors who spoke supported Australia's decision to devalue.<br />
In addition, the greater flexibility that would be permitted under<br />
the new exchange arrangements was welcomed. There was no suggestion<br />
that the devaluation could be regarded as a competitive devaluation.<br />
Most international reaction to our measures has recognised the soundness<br />
of the decisions which have already been taken. The New York Morgan<br />
Guaranty's Chief International Economist described the 17.5% devaluation<br />
as a very correct amount and noted the wide recognition of Australia's<br />
international uncompetitiveness. </p>
<p>Milton Friedman has observed post-devaluation that " Australia is<br />
very well regarded international because now and this is comparatively<br />
rare amongst Western nations at the moment it appears to be pursuing<br />
a mature and steaccourse".<br />
Our Ambassador to the U. S. has reported that our emphasis on the<br />
anti-inflationary objectives accompanying the devaluation is being<br />
applauded, and that the devaluation has been seen as removing a<br />
significant disincentive to investment in Australia.<br />
In balancing the arms of economic policy, the government considered<br />
inflation as the number one priority but we have never contended that it<br />
was the only priority. Nor has it ever been argued to my knowledge<br />
that it ought to be the only priority.<br />
In a number of decisions, such as the introduction of family<br />
allowances, full personal tax indexation, the investment allowance,<br />
and the allocation of monies to aboriginal and welfare programmes,<br />
the government has moved to help the sectors of the community hit<br />
hardest by inflation, and to encourage activity. If inflation had<br />
been the only priority then there would have bee no family allowances,<br />
no indexation, and no increases in money for social programmes.<br />
There would have been no budget deficit and much more extensive cut<br />
backs in government programmes. If inflation were our sole objective<br />
we should have had a balanced budget. I do not recall the government<br />
being urged to bring down a balanced budget. The reason is obvious.<br />
The hardship in the other areas would have been too great.<br />
The fight against inflation, although our dominant objective, cannot<br />
be conducted with an utter disregard for its effects on other areas<br />
of social policy. The fact that devaluation has taken place does not<br />
mean that combating inflation has lost its place as our first priority.<br />
The fact that the government has been forced to take a decision which<br />
has some inflationary consequences can no more be adduced as evidence<br />
that the anti-inflationary strategy has been abandoned, than the fact<br />
that the government did not plan for a balanced budget. </p>
<p>The reverse is the truth.<br />
The devaluation decision requires that we redouble our efforts<br />
to get on top of inflation that there be no let up that<br />
we press ahead with our announced strategy more strongly<br />
than ever before.<br />
Let me review the year's major economic decisions.<br />
In February, $ 360 million worth of savings resulting from an<br />
expenditure review were announced. In January, decisions<br />
were taken to soak in the financial system.<br />
In May, a package of fiscal policy decisions was introduced<br />
tax indexation, $ 2,600 savings to forward estimates, famil-y<br />
allowances. In the Budget, spending was held and the deficit<br />
contained, monetary guidelines were laid down and strategy for<br />
recovery was firmly implemented.<br />
Let me state the main elements of our strategy again. The most<br />
rigorous restraint on Government spending to rein in the bloated<br />
public sector and free resources to productive private enterprise,<br />
the provision of a wide range of incentives to industry to resume<br />
expansion and provide employment opportunities. We are seizing<br />
every opportunity to emphasise the importance of restraint in<br />
wage and salary demands; establishing, through a variety of<br />
measures a climate which will make wage and salary restraint<br />
possible. This is essential to keep costs down and create<br />
conditions in which employment opportunities can be expanded<br />
as rapidly as possible.<br />
We always said that this strategy would take time that it would<br />
be a full three year programme. It is the only strategy which<br />
is going to work.<br />
Let me state the Government's attitude to inflation so there can<br />
be no possible misunderstanding. Inflation is the enemy Australia<br />
must defeat. It undermines security, destroys the value of savings<br />
and incomes, hinders the expansion of job opportunities, erodes our<br />
position in the world, and in the end eats away at the vitality<br />
of our institutions and our way of life.<br />
Twelve months ago, Australia, we all know, was in economic disarray.<br />
When we came to office were were faced by the worst unemployment<br />
since the nineteen thirties, an actual decline in the gross domestic<br />
product, a depression in company profits, a decline in business<br />
investment to its lowest level in three years, a desperate<br />
situation in the farming sector and an inflation rate that was<br />
fourteen per cent higher than it had been a year before and<br />
showing no substantive indications of declining. </p>
<p>-12-<br />
In the past year, we have focussed the arms of policy on the problem<br />
of inflation and have achieved improvement in our position.<br />
The fact that it was not possible to avoid devaluation shows<br />
the magnitude of the problems which still fact the Australian<br />
economy and every one of us as Australians.<br />
Some people appear to believe that devaluation was a soft option.<br />
Nothing could be further from the truth it is the hardest. option<br />
of all.<br />
If we dno not take advantage of the opportunities that devaluation<br />
offers us, if we don't bring every weapon ofpolicy to bear on<br />
inflation then the future will be a grave one we may not get another<br />
opportunity. The present situation facing us all demands a concerted national<br />
effort. All Australians, all sectors of the community, have an<br />
overrinding national interest in achieving a soundly based economic<br />
recovery. We have made a beginning and we must not squander our national<br />
opportunities and our national strengths.<br />
The Government's measures have been the right ones but the<br />
Government cannot do it alone. In the battle against inflation,<br />
we need the support of all Australians.<br />
We need to find a national will and determination to overcome<br />
inflation. Too often our institutions seek to sharpen differences<br />
in the community to pursue an adversary relationship with each<br />
other for temporary advantage rather than emphasising the<br />
common interests we all share.<br />
This is a time when all our institutions, all Australians<br />
businesses, trade unions, all in positions of leadership in the<br />
community must seek to set aside narrow interests in favour<br />
of the overriding common interests we all share.<br />
Devaluation should underline for every Australian the seriousness<br />
of the problem that confronts us. It also gives us an opportunity<br />
that we as a nation cannot afford to lose.<br />
The fight against inflation is a fight we are going to win. </p>
