PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF NEWS CONFERENCE, BRISBANE SHERATON HOTEL,<br />
4 JUNE 1989<br />
E 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, can you give us your reaction<br />
to events in China?<br />
PM: Yes I can. I deeply deplore what has happened in<br />
China. I have said before these most recent events<br />
that we both welcome the democratic push for reform so<br />
that people would have the pleasure of expression in<br />
China and, on the other hand, welcomed also the restraint<br />
with which the authorities in China had dealt with those<br />
demonstrations. Now, of course, that situation has been<br />
reversed. The jse c4 violence and force by the authorities<br />
which has resulted in the deaths of at least 100, and<br />
perhaps many more, of the these people who have been<br />
exercising their rights peacefully cannot be accepted.<br />
I haive instructed the Ambassador of Australia in Beijing<br />
who shall transmit this attitude of the Australian Government,<br />
and I'm sure the Australian people, to the authorities.<br />
Let me also say that I have ordered that the HMAS Parramatta,<br />
which was to be visiting Shanghai next week, shall not<br />
at this stage make that visit. This is a tragedy because<br />
the world has welcomed the processes of economic reform<br />
and the gradual processes of social change that have<br />
been occurring in China, these have been developments<br />
which have been to the benefit, the obvious benefit.<br />
of the people of China and to the rest of the world as<br />
they have opened up policy of gradual reform and certainly<br />
opening to the rest of the world. We, in Australia,<br />
have been very closely associated with China and its<br />
developments because we welcomed those things, as I say,<br />
S a~ good for China and good for the rest of the<br />
world. We deeply regj1; 2A and deplore, as I say, what<br />
has happened and I hope that this will be a temporary<br />
aberration and that there will be a return to the processes<br />
which, as I say, we and the rest of the world have to<br />
this point welcomed.<br />
JOURNALIST: Are there trade implications for Australia?<br />
PM: It's too early to say that. One should be optimistic<br />
and hope that not merely the expression of view that </p>
<p>I put on behalf of Australia, but the views which I believe<br />
are being and will be expressed by the rest of the world<br />
will bring the leadership of China to a realisation of<br />
two things. One, that as far as China itself is concerned,<br />
this is not a viable situation for the future. The imposition<br />
of authority by force and by the killing of innocent<br />
people, you can't retain a credible authority in that<br />
way. Secondly, it is against their interests internationally.<br />
So one would hope that there will be change and a reversion<br />
to the previous paths of reform and the acceptance of<br />
the rights of individuals to express their views.<br />
JOURNALIST: Do you have any concern for Australian nationals?<br />
PM: No, I believe there is no reason to have any concern<br />
for Australian nationals. But let me say this, that<br />
I have been in contact with events up until the early<br />
hours of this morning and then was awake again early<br />
O this morning and understand that our Embassy in Beijing<br />
has been up right through the night, so they are monitoring<br />
the situation. To this point there is no indication<br />
that we need to have cause for concern. But we have<br />
a very efficient Ambassador and staff in Beijing who<br />
will be, as I say, watching developments in all their<br />
implications, but I have no reason to have concern for + 1ke sci. 9e+~<br />
6 Australian nationals there.<br />
JOURNALIST: Would you consider trade sanctiom of some<br />
kind if this continues?<br />
PM: It's too early to be talking about that sort of<br />
thing. The appropriate sensible course, both from the<br />
point of view of China and Australia and the rest of<br />
the world, is to make sure that the leaders in China<br />
know the unacceptability of this course of action. As<br />
I say, steps have already been taken to make that clear<br />
as far as we're concerned and I'm sure our friends around<br />
O the world will be doing the same thing.<br />
JOURNALIST: What about Hong Kong refugees? Are you<br />
concerned there may be a flood of refugees, people who<br />
want to immigrate from Hong Kong as a result and<br />
would Australia accept those people?<br />
PM: Australia's immigration program has clearly laid<br />
down. It's determined on the basis of the components<br />
which include a refugee component, but we will not be<br />
-changing that position. IWe stiiation, of course, of<br />
the refugees in Hong Kong is exacerbated at the moment<br />
by an enormous exodus of people from Vietnam to Hong<br />
Kong. It is quite clear that the great majority of those<br />
are not political refugees, but economic refugees. </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, Andrew Peacock said at the<br />
Liberal Party conference in Brisbane that he'd like another<br />
debate with you and he's written to Mr Barton to organise<br />
one for the last Monday of the next election campaign.<br />
Will you be in that?<br />
PM: Look we're dealing with a Leader of the Opposition<br />
who is devoid of policies and ideas, who is the epitome<br />
of grimmickry and emptiness. I won't be accommodating<br />
that sort of approach to politics.<br />
ends </p>
