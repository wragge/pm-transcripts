FOR MEDIA 29 March 1984<br />
The report in today's Australian that the head of my<br />
Department, Sir Geoffrey Yeend, is to be replacediis<br />
baseless. I also reject attempts to characterise my relations with<br />
Sir Geoffrey as " cool" and " indifferent".<br />
I have, since assuming office, enjoyed a good personal<br />
and working relationship with Sir Geoffrey. </p>
