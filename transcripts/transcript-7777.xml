    <content><![CDATA[<p>15 OctoberÂ 1989</p>
<p>I call on the Pharmacy Guild of Australia to negotiate onÂ the issue of Pharmacy remuneration on the basis agreed atÂ our meeting on 27 September.</p>
<p>Contrary to the agreement reached at that meeting that theÂ decision of the Pharmaceutical Benefits RemunerationÂ Tribunal was a fact and would be accepted as such, and thatÂ the integrity of the budget would be maintained the GuildÂ now seeks an increase in dispensing fees above the levelÂ determined by the Tribunal, fees paid out of taxpayersÂ money.</p>
<p>On the Guild's own figures pharmacists have achievedÂ substantial increases in recent years. The Tribunal, onÂ evidence presented, found they were over remunerated.</p>
<p>The ball is in the Guild's court. It should come back toÂ the negotiating table with proposals that are realistic.</p>
<p>The Government is open and available for a resumption ofÂ talks and has already offered a $ 41 million increase on topÂ of the Tribunal's decision to implement the Tribunal'sÂ recommendations on an essential pharmacy allowance, theÂ professional role of pharmacists and industry restructuring.</p>
<p>We are willing to listen to the Guild's views on theseÂ matters and involve the Guild in their implementation.Â </p>
<p>The Government will continue to counter misinformation onÂ the issue and ensure that the public has access to publiclyÂ subsidised medication. But we cannot and will not tolerate Â any group in the country being unaccountable for their useÂ of public money.</p>
<p>Over half a billion dollars will be paid to chemists thisÂ year and the mechanism of accountability for their fundingÂ is the Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal.</p>
