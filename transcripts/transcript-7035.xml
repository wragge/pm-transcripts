EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY CHEIA AINST DELIVERY<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINIS R<br />
JOHN CURTIN MEMORIAL BREA~ km ST<br />
FREMANTLE 16 NOVEMBER 1986<br />
Colleagues, Distinguished Visitors and Guests, Friends All:<br />
There is a quite superb combination of features associated<br />
with this occasion.<br />
We meet in this historic port-city of Fremantle the<br />
western gateway of Australia.<br />
For generations this was the landfall for hundreds of<br />
thousands of immigrants to Australia this nation of<br />
immigrants.<br />
And especially in the 40s and 50s the great years of the<br />
post-war immigration program which transformed modern<br />
Australia. it is a city linked for all time with the name and the<br />
memory og John Curtin.<br />
As such, it has a special place in the history of the<br />
Australian Labor Party. John Curtin our greatest Prime<br />
Minister, always acknowledged his debt to the people of<br />
Fremantle. They stood by him in his very difficult personal<br />
years before his war-time leadership of Australia. And he<br />
always refused offers of a safer seat in the East, even when<br />
his national burden would have given him every justification<br />
for doing so.<br />
So we are in a place rich in history, and particularly rich<br />
and meaningful in its historical Labor associations.<br />
But Fremantle today at this particular time is probably<br />
the last place in Australia to be preoccupied with its past<br />
its great past.<br />
Now it is the venue for this great international sporting<br />
event. I certainly won't say the Americas Cup has put Fremantle on<br />
the map. It's always been too important to Australia and<br />
indeed the region for that to be said. </p>
<p>But it is true that this remarkable event puts Fremantle in<br />
the world spotlight, in a way that we could hardly have<br />
anticipated three and a half years ago.<br />
And we are delighted to have with us today representatives<br />
of the syndicates which, by their skill and prowess and<br />
sportsmanship, are all making such a contribution to the<br />
success, interest and excitement of this unique<br />
international event.<br />
It would be hardly any use my saying that I am remotely<br />
impartial as to the final outcome.<br />
It is all very well to try to live up to certain standards<br />
of statesmanship and international diplomacy.<br />
But, as Billy Hughes said when asked why he had belonged to<br />
every Australian political party except the old Country<br />
Party, now the National Party: " Brother, you have to draw<br />
the line somewhere"<br />
But within that qualification, I do say to all of our<br />
visitors the best of luck and good sailing.<br />
of course the very greatest of John Curtin's achievements as<br />
war-time Prime minister was the forging of the<br />
American-Australian alliance. That was fundamental to our<br />
survival as a nation. It remains the sheet-anchor of our<br />
international and defence position.<br />
And I suppose it is a measure of the underlying strength of<br />
the friendship the partnership Curtin built more than<br />
years ago, that it has survived the pressures of recent<br />
times.<br />
And although the Member for Fremantle and the minister for<br />
Trade, John Dawkins, is, of course, here today, I am not<br />
talking about his area of concern some problems we have<br />
with certain of the trade policies of the United States.<br />
I mean the really serious problem we have in the smooth<br />
sailing of our relations.<br />
I mean the New York Yacht Club.<br />
But I am sure whatever takes place in the skirmishes before<br />
and even during the great battle of Fremantle itself in<br />
February and whoever ultimately has the honour to be the<br />
challenger the friendship will survive just as it has<br />
survived the battle of Newport three years ago.<br />
I wouldn't want our overseas visitors to get the impression<br />
that, as a nation, we are in some way obsessed or<br />
preoccupied with the Americas Cup.<br />
That would be a distortion.<br />
I </p>
<p>It is true that we are a great sporting nation. it is true<br />
that we are proud of our sporting tradition. And it is true<br />
that all Australians shared in Australia II's triumph at<br />
Newport. But we do have a mature sense of perspective about these<br />
things. Nevertheleso there is a reason why the Americas Cup<br />
Challenge talkes on a special significance a symbolic<br />
significance for Australia, at this critical juncture in<br />
our nationos affairs.<br />
There is no need for any of us to hide the fact that we are<br />
passing thirough times of great difficulty and unprecedonted<br />
complexity, in our economic affairs. These are facts.<br />
Given leadercship, Australians do not run away from the<br />
facts.<br />
we didn't under Curtin in war-time.<br />
And we are not running away now.<br />
Just a minute ago, I hinted, very lightly, on a major cause<br />
of our current problems the international trade situation,<br />
and specifically, the disastrous downturn in the terms of<br />
trade, the gall in prices for many of our major exports<br />
the commodities which particularly underpin the economy of<br />
this great state of Western Australia and make possible its<br />
tremendous contribution to the national economy and the<br />
standard of living of all Australians.<br />
But there is another aspect to our current difficulties,<br />
which the downturn in the terms of trade has brought into<br />
the sharpest possible focus.<br />
if the imimediate cause of the problems is the fall in<br />
commodity prices, this has simply pointed up a more<br />
fundamentaL. problem in Australia.<br />
That is a legacy of three decades of lost opportunities.<br />
We have to recover those lost opportunities. We have to<br />
have a fundamental reappraisal and a basic restructuring of<br />
the Australian economy.<br />
And what we, as a Government, are proposing to the people of<br />
this nation is a fundamental restructuring of the nation's<br />
economy, and the use of the nation's resources.<br />
That is the real challenge we face as a nation today.<br />
And, by fas the most valuable, by far the most important of<br />
the resoures of our nation are our human resources the<br />
intelligenca, skill, vigour and competitiveness of our<br />
people. </p>
<p>And these are all qualities which were demonstrated so<br />
vividly in the work the teamwork which brought the<br />
victory at Newport and brought the Cup Challenge to<br />
Fremantle.<br />
And it is in that sense I say that there is a special<br />
symbolism for Australia about the Challenge.<br />
I don't mean who wins. I mean something much more important<br />
the combination of Australian skills, initiative, drive,<br />
enthusiasm, determination and teamwork which brought the Cup<br />
to Fremantle in the first place.<br />
Because it is on the basis of these qualities these<br />
Australian qualities that we are going to win our way<br />
through our present economic difficulties.<br />
As I have said on previous occasions: in certain respects,<br />
the kind of difficulties we now face represent the same kind<br />
of challenge that we faced in the war the challenge John<br />
Curtin faced as leader of this nation during the war.<br />
And I haven't been saying that as some sort of rhetorical<br />
flourish or just because my admiration for John Curtin is<br />
boundless. I say it because the kind of response required from the<br />
Australian people, in these times, is parallel to the kind<br />
of steadiness and steadfastness which was required in the<br />
war. And I do believe that is especially true for those of us, as<br />
members and supporters who make up the Australian Labor<br />
Party and the Australian Labor Movement, which John Curtin<br />
led, and which I have the immense privilege to lead as his<br />
successor, 40 years on.<br />
There is one reason of commanding importance why the<br />
response of the Labor Party and the Labor Movement is<br />
crucial.<br />
And it relates directly to our wider goals and objectives,<br />
as a Party and a Movement our vision for Australia.<br />
Because the fundamental fact is this:<br />
Without the reforms in financial, fiscal, trade, industrial<br />
and technology policies upon which our Government has<br />
embarked, there could only be stagnation and decline in<br />
Australian living standards. There would inevitably be a<br />
crippling in our ability as a nation to pay for the great<br />
social programs and reforms which lie at the heart of our<br />
Labor aims and aspirations for our people. </p>
<p>in the years ahead, the success of these policies will<br />
require the same sort of co-operation between governments,<br />
business and unions and the whole community which has<br />
been the basis of recovery and success since 1983<br />
the creation of 670,000 new jobs;<br />
the achievement of economic growth of just under<br />
a year in the last three years, compared with minus<br />
growth in the final years of our predecessors;<br />
a restoration of business profitability to the<br />
levels of the 1960s;<br />
the halving of industrial disputation;<br />
and now, most important of all for the longer term<br />
future, the restoration of our international<br />
competitiveness.<br />
These are some of the achievements of three years of<br />
co-operation between governments, business and unions in<br />
this country.<br />
But I repeat: the work we have now embarked upon to<br />
restructure the Australian economy and to regenerate<br />
Australian industry is not only the most important and far<br />
reaching of all our reforms.<br />
It is the absolute condition, the indispensable condition<br />
for the achievement of all our other reforms and the fuller<br />
achievement of our vision of an even better life for all<br />
Aust ' ralians a more fruitful life, a more rewarding life, a<br />
more secure life for the individuals, families, groups and<br />
communities which make up the diverse and rich mosaic of<br />
Australia. And I make no apologies at all for invoking the spirit of<br />
John Curtin, as our guide, both in principles and in action,<br />
to the approach we bring to the task ahead, in our work for<br />
the welfare of the people of this great country.<br />
And I certainly make no apology for that, in this place, in<br />
this city, at this time, on this occasion here in the<br />
West, his adopted home, here in the city which by sending<br />
him to Parliament gave Australia its greatest Prime<br />
Minister, and here in this exciting place at this exciting<br />
time at this time of the Great Challenge indeed. </p>
