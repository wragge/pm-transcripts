PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR PRESS 20 FEBRUARY,' 1979<br />
NAMIBIA PEACEKEEPING FORCE<br />
The problem of Namibia is one of long-standing. It dates<br />
from South Africa's refusal, at the end of World War II,<br />
to enter into a trusteeship agreement over the old<br />
mandated territory of South West Africa and its claim<br />
to sovereignty over that territory. South Africa<br />
has continued to administer Namibia despite the United<br />
Nations' decision in 1966, that South Africa's mandate<br />
should be withdrawn.<br />
Concerted U. N. efforts towards achieving self-determination<br />
and independence for Namibia began in 1972. These efforts<br />
were un~ successful and, in 1974, the U. N. adopted measures<br />
seeking immediate and unconditional South African withdrawal.<br />
In 1975, South Africa officially recognised the<br />
international status of the territory and decided to initiate<br />
its-own discussions in Namibia towards a constitutional<br />
settlement. The Five Western members of the Security<br />
Council France., West Germany,* Canada) in<br />
1977 advised South Africa that its constitutional proposals<br />
arising out of these consultations would not gain<br />
international approval. Following this advice discussions<br />
were initiated between the " Five" arnd South Africa on how<br />
to achieve early and peaceful independence for Namibia<br />
through an internationally acceptable settlement.<br />
Discussions were also held with SWAPO the Souith West<br />
African People's Organisation. These talks led, early<br />
in 1978, to the formulation of the present plan now agreed<br />
to by both the South African Government and SWAPO. The<br />
plan envisaged, in essence, free elections for Namibia,<br />
under U. N. supervision and control for the purpose of<br />
electing a constituent assembly to draw up and adopt a<br />
constitution for an independent Namibia. The plan, and<br />
proposals by the U. N. Secretary-General for its<br />
implementation, were later accepted by the U. N. Security<br />
Council as a basis for an internationally acceptable<br />
settlement that would give Namibia independence.<br />
The establishment of UNTAG the United Nations Transitional<br />
Assistance Group is part of the plan. Elections are<br />
scheduled to be held some seven months after UNTAG's<br />
deployment, and independence following about five<br />
months later. / 2 </p>

Since 1977, Australia has received a number of informal<br />
soundings about a contribution to a peacekeeping force<br />
in Namibia. Representations were made to us, at<br />
different times, by the the Commonwealth-Secretariat,<br />
and by representatives of the British and American<br />
Governments. In July last year, the U. N. Secretariat made an approach<br />
enquiring whether Australia could provide elements<br />
for the UNTAG logistics force. In the light of recent<br />
indications that the U. N. would be seeking to establish<br />
UNTAG very shortly, the Government has been actively<br />
considering a contribution that would be consistent with<br />
Australia's international obligations, its support for an<br />
early settlement of the Namibia problem and support for<br />
the Western and U. N. proposals for achieving it.<br />
Southern Africa is a region of considerable strategic<br />
importance to Australia, indeed to the entire free world.<br />
In the Government's view we ought to do what we reasonably<br />
can to promote conditions there which will bring about<br />
stability and so contribute to security in the<br />
widest sense. The Western initiative on Namibia offers<br />
the opportunity for this and it is thus vital that it<br />
should be successful.<br />
There has been in the past great turmoil in Africa. Many<br />
African problems have been seen to be intractable. Now<br />
we have an opportunity to settle one of those problems<br />
peacefully and in a manner which will deal justly with<br />
all conflicting interests. Wie must not let this<br />
opportunity slip by.<br />
It has been no easy task for the United Nations to put<br />
together a peacekeeping force for Namibia acceptable to<br />
all concerned. Not all of its components have yet been<br />
settled. But it has been made entirely clear to us that an*<br />
Australian contribution would be widely welcomed and, in<br />
particular, would be acceptable both to the South African<br />
Government and to SWAPO. It has also been put to us that<br />
an Australian component would contribute significantly to<br />
the effectiveness of the force.<br />
The Government has considered this question on a number of<br />
occasions in the past. It has weighed carefully all the issues<br />
which are relevant to it. In coming to the judgement that<br />
Australia should offer to make a contribution to United<br />
Nations peacekeeping in Namibia we have regarded as paramount<br />
the importance of having this Western initiative succeed,<br />
the political significance of the area&gt;-, in which the force<br />
will operate and the firm belief that a successful outcome<br />
in Namibia will bring new hope for stability and progress<br />
in what has been a sorely troubled continent. A successful<br />
conclusion to the problem of Namibia should give r-enewed<br />
hope that other African problems can be resolved by reasonable<br />
means. / 3 </p>
<p>The Government has carefully weighed the international<br />
circumstances in which Australia finds itself at this<br />
time. It has especially taken into account present conflicts<br />
in South East Asia. It has concluded above all that now<br />
is a time for Australia fully to assume its international<br />
responsibilities. It is not a time for us to stand back<br />
and refuse to be involved because the problem to be settled<br />
lies in a distant continent and may appear to be of no<br />
immediate concern to us. We are fully aware that the conflict<br />
in Indo-China involves grave risks to the region and to<br />
the world as a whole. We have made this clear by our<br />
recent actions. Some would argue that at a time of<br />
danger and difficulty in Asia we should not participate<br />
in this international initiative. The Government<br />
argues to the contrary we are part of the wider world.<br />
We have a real capacity to contribute to the success of this<br />
United Nations initiative. We believe that this is above<br />
all a time when our sense of responsibility in international<br />
affairs and our commitment to the settlement of disputes by<br />
peaceful means needs to be firmly underlined. This is<br />
a time not for withdrawal but for participation, for the<br />
acceptance of a commitment which is within our capacity.<br />
If we are not prepared to participate in an initiative<br />
sponsored, amongst others, by the United States and<br />
Great Britain, adopted by the United Nations and accepted<br />
by the conflicting parties, how can we expect others to<br />
fulfil their obligations to act responsibly and cooperatively<br />
in efforts to settle disputes and restore stability<br />
in areas of conflict?<br />
The composition of the U. N. force Ãµ _-4in Namibia has.<br />
not yet as I said before, been finally determined. The<br />
United Kindgom. has already announced its proposed<br />
participation in UNTAG and it is expected that<br />
contributors will include a number of other western<br />
countries; there will also be African, Asian, Latin<br />
American and possibly east European contributions.<br />
The element which we will offer to the United Nations for<br />
inclusion in the force is an engineer contingent of 250 officers<br />
and men, together with a national headquarters and support<br />
element of 50. If accepted, this unit will have the<br />
responsibility of providing a variety of engineering services<br />
in. support of the operational battalions. This role will<br />
be vital to the success of the force.<br />
It is planned that the U. N. operation in Namibia will be<br />
for a peried of twelve months. It is intended that the<br />
deployment of the Australian contingent will be for that<br />
length of time. / 4 </p>
<p>4<br />
Our defence forces have been given instructions to pay<br />
the fullest regard to the safety of Australian personnel<br />
who may be deployed to Namibia. We cannot say they will<br />
not face any dangers. There are risks involved in any<br />
peacekeeping operation. But all aspects of the situation<br />
in which the force will operate have been given the most<br />
careful consideration and the risks our men will face<br />
are assessed by the National Assessments Board as low.<br />
Australia has played a part in a number of U. N. peacekeeping<br />
operations in the past. It is at present contributing<br />
to them in the Middle East in Cyprus, and in Kashmir.<br />
We cannot be expected nor will we be asked, to contribute<br />
to all future U. N. operations. But, we believe our<br />
decision to offer a contribution to the Namibia force is fully<br />
consistent with the policy adopted in the past by this<br />
and earlier governments. It is a contribution well within<br />
our capacity. It is the right decision. It has been<br />
taken in a conscious awareness of our international<br />
responsibilities at a time when such awareness, by<br />
ourselves and by others, is needed more than ever.<br />
