<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Will you do a deal with Mr Harradine on Wik? A new deal?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>If anybody in the Senate, be it the Labor Party, be it the Democrats,</p>
<p> be it Senator Harradine or anybody else, is concerned about the composition</p>
<p> of the Senate after any double dissolution then they should pass the</p>
<p> Government's Native Title Bill without delay.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>So you are not prepared to re-open negotiations?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>We have put in a very fair Bill, it's already a compromise. Talk</p>
<p> of further compromise fails to acknowledge the compromise that is</p>
<p> already there in the Government's Bill. So I just say very directly</p>
<p> to anybody in the Senate who is worried about what the result of a</p>
<p> double dissolution might be: the answer is in your hands. Pass the</p>
<p> Government's Native Title Bill. It should have been passed months</p>
<p> ago and the obstructive tactics of the Labor Party and others in the</p>
<p> Senate have caused much of the current difficulty. The solution is</p>
<p> in their hands, they should pass a fair, decent Bill that includes</p>
<p> a very honourable compromise in a very difficult situation. Thank</p>
<p> you.</p>
