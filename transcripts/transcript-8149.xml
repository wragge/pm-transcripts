A<br />
FOR MEDIA 2 October 1990<br />
A major figure in Australian literature for more than three<br />
decades, Patrick White, leaves behind him a legacy of novels<br />
and plays that have helped to define the modern Australian<br />
identity. It is no secret that as an uncompromising and frank<br />
commentator on a wide range of contemporary social issues,<br />
Patrick White was at times a sharp critic of this<br />
Government. Of course in this we were not Robinson Crusoe.<br />
He sought a more humane and thoughtful world a quest that<br />
led him to see serious flaws all around him, and not least<br />
in himself. But we can all take pride in the fact that his<br />
great talents as an author were recognised in 1973 when he<br />
became the first and only Australian to be awarded the Nobel<br />
Prize for Literature.<br />
With Patrick White, Australian writing expanded in scope, in<br />
depth and in richness, and his achievements must be an<br />
inspiration to younger Australian writers. </p>
