    <content><![CDATA[<p>117/ 92<br /><br />The Coalition's policy on road user charges is a hypocritical sop to the National Party.<br />It flies in the face of Dr Ilewson's Fightback rhetoric, exposing him as a bully who will<br />abuse and affront his legitimate critics in the community, but shrinks and fails to get his<br />way in his own Party Room.<br />The decision to fund roads through Consolidated Revenue in the first term of a Hewson<br />Government" is flagrantly at odds with Dr Hewson's Fightback manifesto.<br />According to Fightback: " The user pays approach to the provision ofpublic infrastructure<br />is however important in achieving a rational approach to microeconomic reform. A key<br />part of that reform process is getting the price signals right for transport. Fully funding<br />road costs out of general revenue does not achieve that objective."<br />Just one month ago, Dr Hewson expressed it this way: " Down the track, we want to see a<br />form of road user charge for commercial vehicles, especially heavy transport."<br />Obviously, " down the track" means sometime after July 1996. This is not only at odds<br />with Fightback and Dr Hewson's rhetoric, it's also bad policy and Dr Hcwson knows it.<br />The fact is the fuel excise costs Australian motorists about one third of the average level of<br />fuel tax in OECD countries. Our petrol prices are already the second lowest of the 24<br />. DECD countries.<br />In a press release on September 27, Dr Hewson said a road user charge, based on vehicle<br />weight and distance travelled would be used to fund roads, " frecing an amount of<br />consolidated revenue."<br />1</p>
<p>Clearly, on real ising that this would mean some heavy trucks would pay up to $ 1 7,000 a<br />year under a Hcwson Government, the Leader of the Opposition has allowed himself to be<br />talked into a cynical pre-election capitulation deferring the road user charge at the<br />expense of all taxpayers.<br />Dr I-ewson claims to have eschewed popularity, preferring to strive for what's<br />ideologically and economically right for the nation. But he didn't count on the<br />intransigence of his colleagues in the National Party. The result is a policy under which all<br />Australian taxpayers will subsidise road usage by commercial vehicles.<br />Dr Hewson's been rolled and, under his policy, the public will pay the price.<br />The reality within the coalition was dcscribed correctly by Dr Hcwson a few years ago<br />when he said the National Party laid claim to policy positions and the Liberal Party got<br />rolled. Nothing has changed. Mr Fischer has assumed the mantle of the " roller" and Dr<br />I-cwson has maintained the Liberal average as " rollee".<br />CANBERRA 29 October, IM9</p>
