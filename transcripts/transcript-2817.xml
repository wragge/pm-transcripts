PRESS STATEMENT NO. 54<br />

AUSTRALIAN COUNCIL FOR THE ARTS<br />
In my press statement of 26 January about the establishment of the<br />
Australian Council for the Arts, I mentioned that the basis of the work<br />
of the new Council would be seven autonomous Boards, each dealing with a<br />
different area of the Arts. The announcement contained the name of the<br />
Chairman of each of the Boards<br />
Aboriginal Arts Board Mr Dick Roughsey<br />
Crafts Board Mrs Marea Gazzard<br />
Literature Board Professor G. Elainey<br />
Mlusic Board Mr Donald Banks<br />
Visual and Plastic Arts Board Mr H. J. Bailey<br />
Theatre Board Hr Peter Hall<br />
Film and Television Board 1, r Phillip Adams<br />
I am anxious for the work of these Boards to proceed as soon as<br />
possible. They will be responsible for developing in each field<br />
important new national policies and initiatives. They will be<br />
responsible for their own affairs, and will be expected to plan a<br />
programme of future support in each area which will be of lastinq<br />
value to Australian artists and the public.<br />
I have received from the Chairmen of the Boards their suggestion<br />
for membership. The exception is the Aboriginal Arts Board, the<br />
membersnip of which will be announced shortly. The membership of<br />
the Boards contains a preponderance of practisinq professionals whose<br />
wide experience and knowledge will be invaluable.<br />
The Government is mindful that the arts are for audiences as<br />
well as performers. The membership of the Boards, therefore, provides<br />
for representation of what might be called the consumer. Since the<br />
Boards will have to deal with finance, the structure of companies and<br />
administering organizations, legal matters and a variety of concerns<br />
where skills and knowledge other than those of the practising artist<br />
will be required, people with a broad general knowledge in these fields<br />
have also been invited to join the Boards. In addition, the membership<br />
will include people whose work on previous advisory boards will be of<br />
value during the early stages.<br />
The invitations to new members provide for a regular inflow of<br />
new ideas. All the initial terms of members will be for one or two<br />
years. There will be provision for the Boards to co-opt one or two<br />
additional members if they require them for particular purposes.<br />
It is our hope over the coming years to involve in the public<br />
administration of the Arts a wide cross section of interested and<br />
knowledgeable people.<br />
The people who have accepted my invitations to join the Boards are:-</p>
