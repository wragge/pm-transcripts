    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Commonwealth Government will increase Australiaâs $18 million contribution to the response to Ebola in West Africa and strengthen preparations to detect and respond to a possible Ebola case in Australia.</p>
<p>A health service provider will be contracted to manage and run a 100-bed Ebola treatment facility in Sierra Leone, as part of the United Kingdom-led international efforts in that country.Â  Discussions are underway with Aspen Medical, an Australian company, in this regard.</p>
<p>The Ebola treatment facility will be staffed mainly by local health care workers, supported by a contingent of international staff, including some Australian volunteers.</p>
<p>The Government will contribute up to $20 million over the next eight months for this treatment facility.</p>
<p>The Government has said consistently that it would not deploy Australians to Ebola-affected countries without a credible plan for their treatment or medical evacuation.</p>
<p>In recent weeks, the Government has discussed the evolving situation, including measures to treat health workers, with the United Kingdom, the United States and others.</p>
<p>Australia has now received credible assurances for in-country treatment and medical evacuation for Australian volunteers who provide health care in West Africa.</p>
<p>It is only right that, as these measures become operational, we now make a further prudent and proportionate contribution.</p>
<p>In addition to this facility, Australia will provide $2 million to RedR Australia to fund the deployment of technical experts to non-frontline roles in the United Nations Ebola response.</p>
<p>Consistent with the Governmentâs long-standing priority to keep our country and our region safe from Ebola, we will also provide an initial package of up to $2 million to train health officials in Papua New Guinea, Timor-Leste and the Pacific Islands to prepare for a potential Ebola outbreak.</p>
<p>Australia will also contribute to the development of a World Health Organisation regional response plan and a study on the risks and possible impacts of an Ebola outbreak in the region.</p>
<p>The Government will further enhance our border procedures to ensure the public is protected against the arrival of a possible case of Ebola.</p>
<p>New measures will include:</p>
<ul><li>updating inflight public health announcements and providing Ebola-specific advice to all travellers to Australia;</li>
<li>requesting all travellers to Australia to provide 21-day traveller history declarations;</li>
<li>strengthening screening procedures at our borders, including additional questioning and reprogramming of Smartgates;</li>
<li>requiring passengers of concern to undertake new targeted temperature checking arrangements at the border; and</li>
<li>ensuring Human Quarantine Officers are on-call at all times to attend airports to assess any travellers who present with a raised temperature.</li>
</ul><p>The new domestic measures will be in place over the coming fortnight.</p>
<p>While Ebola is a serious disease, it is not highly contagious. The risk of an outbreak of Ebola in Australia remains low, including from returning aid workers.</p>
<p>The Commonwealth Government will continue to monitor the Ebola situation to ensure we are well prepared both overseas and at home.</p>
