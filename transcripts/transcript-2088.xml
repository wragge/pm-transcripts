FOR PRESS: CL 24 JUL 69<br />
P. M. No. 59/ 1969<br />
EXTENSION OF PERIOD OF OPERATION OF THE<br />
1962 COMMONWEALTH/ QUEENSLAND SUGAR AGREEMENT<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister, Mr. John Gorton<br />
The Commonwealth and Queensland Governments<br />
have agreed to extend until 31 August 1969 the period of operation<br />
of the 1962 Commonwealth/ Queensland Sugar Agreement which<br />
would otherwise have expired on 30 June 1969.<br />
The Sugar Agreement provides for the regulation<br />
of the Australian sugar industry and the marketing of sugar in<br />
Australia to the benefit of both producers and consumers.<br />
At the present time the two Governments are<br />
negotiating a new Sugar Agreement and this, when finalised, will<br />
have retrospective effect from 1 July 1969.<br />
The short-term extension is necessary in order<br />
to preserve the benefits of the 1962 Agreement until the arrangements<br />
for the new Agreement are finalised.<br />
