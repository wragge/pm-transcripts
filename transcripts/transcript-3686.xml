PRIP: MINISTER Press Statement No. 489<br />
7 April 1975<br />
INTER-STATE COMMISSION<br />
The Prime Minister, Mr Whitlam, said today<br />
that legislation would be introduced in the Australian<br />
Parliament soon to re-establish the Inter-State Commission.<br />
Mr Whitlam said the re-establishment of the<br />
Inter-State Commission would rectify " a major deficiency<br />
in the. structure of our Constitutional institutions"<br />
" It is one of the great anomalies of Australia's<br />
post-Federation history that the concept of the Inter-State<br />
Commission, for which the founders of our. Constitution<br />
obviously envisaged a major role in Federal relationships,<br />
has except for a brief period six decades ago been ignored<br />
by Australian Governments.<br />
" After more than two years of careful planning<br />
we have now reached a stage where we can decide upon a<br />
role and structure for the Commission which we believe<br />
will enable it to function in a way consistent with its<br />
original conception. " A clearly developed and defined role for the<br />
Commission will evolve over time and in the light of<br />
experience." Mr Whitlam. said the Australian Government<br />
intended the Commission to play a major role in the transport<br />
field in accordance with the intention of the Constitution.<br />
Mr Whitlam. said the Inter-State Commission,<br />
was first appointed in 1913 following an Act of Parliament<br />
introduced by the Fisher Labor Government of 1912. One of<br />
the first acts of the Menzies Government in 1950 was to<br />
repeal the Act. The restored Inter-State Commission will consist<br />
of a President and four other Members, all full-time. In<br />
accordance with Section 103 ( ii) of the Constitution, they<br />
will be appointed for terms of seven years.<br />
" Although the Commission will not be a judicial<br />
body it is considered appropriate that, in view of its<br />
important role and its unique Constitutional status and<br />
authority, the President should have the same rank, status<br />
and precedence as a Justice of the High Court and that other<br />
Members should have comparability with Judges of the Australian<br />
Industrial Court. / 2 </p>

" It will be apparent from this that we shall<br />
be seeking men of the highest calibre to fill positions on<br />
the Commission," Mr Whitlam said.<br />
