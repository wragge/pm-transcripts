We ealeb rat today a most iportant<br />
aniveisary. Rali a entury age with a ombimatioan<br />
of vision, born of a apiwited nationalim# and the<br />
labour of same three and a half thousuad inon, there<br />
began in Part Agusta the sonstruotoan of the<br />
Trans-Australian Railway.<br />
The decision to undertak this gat<br />
task was an indicatiou of the capacity of or<br />
forefathers to beyond their Imediate present,<br />
and a demonstration of the energ and sal of our<br />
young country. NOd mnua labour built this line<br />
and whder the most arduous and eacting condtions.<br />
Today, by contrast, we have groat<br />
neehanisal an toahnologoal advannts0-assoeiated<br />
with vast -lalth projeats which are oontributing<br />
so remarkably to the progress and prosperity of<br />
Australia. If we oatine to veld the foresight and<br />
datruination of the pionws with the facilities at<br />
our command today then we will help to build a nation<br />
capable of meting atir challenge.<br />
I offer vW beat wishes for a memorable<br />
re-enaoment of a notable event in our history.<br />
