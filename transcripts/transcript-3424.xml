Press Statement No. 346<br />
21 October 1974<br />
REPORT OF COMMITTEE APPOINTED BY CABINET ON TAXATION<br />
MATTERS<br />
The Prime Minister, Mr. Whitlam, today released the<br />
report of a committee appointed by Cabinet.<br />
The report is attached.<br />
CANBERRA, A. C. T. </p>
<p>TAXATION MATTERS<br />
REPORT OF COMMITTEE APPOINTED BY CABINET<br />
i. The Committee was asked to report on what may be<br />
done through the taxation system<br />
a. to restrain cost inflation, including the possibility<br />
of excluding wage and salary increases<br />
beyond an established norm from acceptable costs<br />
for the assessment of company income;<br />
b. to encourage saving and investment, including the<br />
possibility of imposing a tax on income for which<br />
a rebate is given for saving;<br />
c. to prepare for a possible balance of payments problem.<br />
2. We took these references to be concerned with particular<br />
modifications of the system of taxation and not with<br />
the structure of rates within the present system or with the<br />
outcome of the Budget as a whole. At the same time, we were<br />
aware that these more general matters were of great relevance<br />
to the Committee's work and accepted that the possibilities<br />
we were asked to examine were to be seen in a Budget context in<br />
which, we understand, the Government was seeking to limit the<br />
growth of its own expenditure.<br />
3. A detailed consideration of proposals to index tax<br />
schedules was outside the Committee's terms of reference, since<br />
such proposals relate more to desirable levels of rates than to<br />
the system of taxation itself. However, since informal </p>
<p>-2-<br />
representations were made to us on this matter, perhaps two<br />
specific comments on tax indexation might be made. First,<br />
such an approach eliminates the stabilising properties of a<br />
progressive tax system in an inflationary situation. Secondly,<br />
as most proposals for tax indexation envisage at most annual<br />
revision of rates, tax brackets and concessions in line with<br />
an approximate formula, whatever decisions need be made could<br />
be made consciously with the Budget, and in the light of the<br />
Government's own judgments, rather than automatically.<br />
4. We were also acutely aware of the limits to the<br />
Committee's considerations set by the time available. It has<br />
therefore been necessary to leave many issues for further<br />
investigation. The Committee met on August 19, 20, 21 and 22.<br />
6. For convenience, our comments appear in a different<br />
order from that set out in paragraph 1 above.<br />
SAVING AND INVESTMENT<br />
Saving<br />
7. From an overall viewpoint, the object of most taxes<br />
is to restrain private spending in general, whether on consumption<br />
or investment, so as to make room for Government claims on<br />
resources and for outlays on social services etc. At the same<br />
time considerations of equity point to placing the heaviest tax<br />
burdens on the relatively " rich", who do most of the private<br />
saving. Given the present income distribution, a tax system<br />
designed to encourage saving would tend to run counter to the </p>
<p>-3-<br />
equity objective ( even though in no particular case is it<br />
certain that a " rich" person, if relieved of tax burdens,<br />
would save more rather than spend more).<br />
8. Against this background, it has been suggested<br />
by some that there would be net advantage in replacing all<br />
income taxation by progressively graduated expenditure<br />
taxation. The Committee considered a less ambitious suggestion<br />
that there should be a special tax or surcharge on income, progressively<br />
graduated, but subject to rebate to the extent that<br />
a taxpayer could show by the net addition made to his assets<br />
( less debts) that he had saved in the course of the year. To<br />
the extent that the introduction of the special tax and rebate<br />
resulted in an increase in savings, it should permit other tax<br />
rates to be reduced below the levels otherwise necessary.<br />
9. The Committee agreed that<br />
the task of determining and policing the rebate<br />
would be a new administrative enterprise of great<br />
complexity; and<br />
( ii) personal incomes, as currently determined for<br />
income tax purposes, inadequately reflect " capacity<br />
to save" to such an extent that the introduction of<br />
a special tax related to saving would be likely to<br />
cause serious anomalies and widespread evasion,<br />
e. g. through intra-family gifts.<br />
The objection under ( ii) would remain even after<br />
the now-contemplated restructuring of tax rates and concessions,<br />
including the provisions to benefit low-income single-income<br />
families. </p>
<p>-4-<br />
11. Finally, it was acknowledged that the suggested<br />
special tax and rebate, although possibly important for<br />
long-run taxation policy, would not make a direct impact on<br />
the cost aspects of the present inflation. The Committee<br />
concluded that such a tax should not be introduced at the<br />
present time.<br />
Investment<br />
12. Measures to encourage private investment in the<br />
aggregate are inherently in conflict with the objective of<br />
restraining private spending and partly inconsistent with the<br />
idea that Government capital-formation should play an increasing<br />
role in the economy. The Committee noted that action against<br />
inflation might discourage private investment and that conventional<br />
accounting in a period of inflation might also work<br />
against investment.<br />
13. If it were desired to mitigate any possible<br />
reduction, provisions such as accelerated depreciation or<br />
investment allowances could be considered but they would<br />
reduce tax revenue and increase company profits without necessarily<br />
increasing investment. For directing investment towards<br />
particular avenues, the taxation system is not an appropriate<br />
instrument. 14. The Committee thought that the worst danger to<br />
investment levels was not in action against inflation, but<br />
in fear of what action the Government might take, and equally<br />
of the consequences if the Government failed to take action.<br />
If business men believed that effective action was<br />
being taken against inflation and were confident also that </p>
<p>demand generally would be sustained at adequate levels,<br />
private investment decisions would be made in the light of<br />
normal long-term considerations of economic advantage. There<br />
should then be little need for special measures to boost private<br />
investment generally.<br />
COST INFLATION<br />
16. The Committee agreed that a tax penalty on wage<br />
and salary increases beyond an established norm could, if<br />
practicable, be a valuable supplement to demand management<br />
in slowing down price increases as the pressure on capacity,<br />
labour, imports and other resources eases.<br />
17. Equally, such a penalty or other like device cannot<br />
work unless that pressure of demand is limited. The penalty<br />
can only stiffen the resistance of employers to excessive wage<br />
claims by increasing the cost of meeting those claims in the<br />
event that the employer is unable to pass on a cost increase<br />
in full. If an employer is confident that he can pass his costs<br />
on, then he could not care less what wages he is asked to pay,<br />
regardless of the tax penalties placed upon him if he pays.<br />
18. In a sellers' market, such as we have had in recent<br />
years and which for the most part we still have, all antiinflationary<br />
efforts will be frustrated. Similarly, the<br />
comfortable expectation that international competition would<br />
be eased by exchange depreciation and/ or controls on imports<br />
when domestic inflation makes that competition uncomfortable<br />
would be a green light for cost increases and would undermine<br />
measures to restrain inflation. </p>
<p>-6-<br />
19. With this background, the Committee considered<br />
a mechanism for excluding wage and salary increases beyond<br />
an established norm from acceptable costs for the assessment<br />
of company income, a possibility to which attention was<br />
directed in our terms of reference.<br />
It would be necessary for the Government to lay<br />
down a norm for permissible wage increases. The Committee<br />
carried on its discussions in terms of a norm which in any<br />
quarter would be the level of the Consumer Price Index in the<br />
preceding quarter related to a fixed base after adjustment<br />
for a predetermined " betterment factor" of, say, 0.5 or 0.6<br />
per cent per quarter. It would also be necessary, but more<br />
difficult, to arrive at a figure for an actual average wage<br />
being paid by an individual employer for comparison with the<br />
norm and so to provide a basis for the determination of tax<br />
penalty. 21. The Australian Bureau of Statistics estimates<br />
each month the Average Weekly Earnings per Employed Male Unit<br />
by States for Australia as a whole, largely on the basis of<br />
Pay-Roll Tax statistics. A similar method is used to establish<br />
Average Wage Earnings for application in the formula for<br />
Reimbursement Grants to the States.<br />
22. Greater difficulties arise in an attempt to produce<br />
a corresponding figure for individual firms which might be used<br />
to determine what are " excessive" wage and salary payments.<br />
The Committee agreed that, despite the difficulties, such a<br />
f igure could be produced for each firm concerned. However, if<br />
this figure were to be used as the basis for a penal tax, there </p>
<p>-7-<br />
would be many anomalies and the Government would be enforcing<br />
penalties which in many instances would clearly be unjust.<br />
23. It would be necessary to rely on an over-simple<br />
formula in considering whether individual firms are paying<br />
" excessive" wages and salaries because it is impossible, from<br />
award determinations or other sources, to determine how changes<br />
in pay rates, occupation by occupation, will affect pay-rolls,<br />
firm by firm, and quarter by quarter. No formula, even if valid<br />
statistically, will accurately represent the situation of any<br />
individual firm with a labour force the relationship of which<br />
to its average in the base period is changing as time goes on.<br />
Even if no wage rate increased, the average might rise because<br />
of a different mix of sexes, skills etc. and because of variation<br />
in overtime, holiday pay etc. Some of these changes could reflect<br />
developments planned earlier but only now Coming into effect. A<br />
firm in which such changes occur could be penalised for an average<br />
pay increase which did not arise from any change in rates to which<br />
it had agreed.<br />
24. Just as bad would be the plight of a firm affected<br />
by large award increases resulting from a meaningfully contested<br />
case before a statutory wage-fixing authority. An example is<br />
the progress of women towards equal pay which could heavily<br />
penalise employers with a large proportion of female staff.<br />
Similar problems would arise for firms which find it<br />
necessary to work an unusual amount of overtime after oil<br />
industry strikes). </p>
<p>-8-<br />
26. Accidental factors such as weather, strikes,<br />
shortages of material, components or power might also impair<br />
the validity of the formula for an individual firm and call<br />
in question the usefulness of the base period.<br />
27. For every firm disadvantaged by such factors<br />
there would probably be another firm receiving a positive<br />
advantage. But this may only increase the protests of the<br />
first set of firms without attracting fan mail from the second.<br />
28. No doubt some of these defects could be set right<br />
in the course of administration but it would be impossible to<br />
hope for more than the roughest of justice. It may be that<br />
rough and ready justice can be tolerated if it is the price of<br />
coping with the inflationary situation. But if the injustices<br />
were sufficiently common and glaring there would be widespread<br />
resentment against the scheme even if it would help keep prices<br />
down. There might also be industrial unrest and unexpected<br />
failures of businesses.<br />
29. Coming closer to home, the Australian Government<br />
must consider how best to deal with remuneration in its own<br />
employment. Much of this employment would not be subject to<br />
company income tax and therefore not subject to penalties in<br />
the course of the scheme. However, a Government which imposed<br />
the scheme and set the norm by which penalties were determined<br />
for other employers would presumably be obliged to conform. The<br />
same considerations apply to State Governments.<br />
We have been advised by the Commissioner of Taxation<br />
that it would be practicable to administer a penalty scheme<br />
along these lines within and through the assessment of companv </p>
<p>-9-<br />
incorte. Further, it is his opinion that, if such a plan is<br />
to be introduced, it would be preferable to give effect to it<br />
through the company income tax system rather than to use the<br />
State Pay-Roll Tax or a revived Australian Government Pay-Roll<br />
Tax. He emphasises that its administration would be costly, in<br />
money and in skilled personnel, even if the firms to be covered<br />
were confined to a few thousand large employers. To achieve<br />
this limitation it would be necessary to exempt a large proportion<br />
of the 80-90,000 firms at present subject to State<br />
Pay-Roll Tax. This would not exempt a corresponding proportion<br />
of employment. It would perhaps lead firms included to seek<br />
exemption by splitting their enterprise into separate smaller<br />
units. 31. Again, these difficulties could perhaps be dealt<br />
with in a rough and ready manner but not without protest..<br />
Furthermore, it seems desirable to repeat that there will be<br />
most serious anomalies and inequities that no tax law, if it is<br />
to retain community respect, should permit. These will exist<br />
as between firms to which the scheme applies and between those<br />
firms and firms outside the scheme. They cannot be eliminated<br />
legislatively and it is to be expected that some affected firms<br />
will try to take matters into their own hands as far as possible<br />
by manipulating pay-rolls and labour to avoid them.<br />
32. We have emphasised the anomalies and injustices<br />
because the Government would wish, in considering whether to<br />
set out on a new path, to do so with its eyes open. If these<br />
anomalies and injustices could be countenanced by the Government<br />
Ait would be Possible to give effect to the measure we have </p>
<p>outlined and if applied as part of a total program it could<br />
help contain cost inflation. It would, however, be impossible<br />
to sustain such a plan for any considerable period of time. If<br />
it is to be employed, it should be seen essentially as a shortterm<br />
measure.<br />
33. The Committee considered various suggestions,<br />
including those put forward by the Institute of Applied Economic<br />
Research and a group of Adelaide economists. These suggestions<br />
have included a tax similar in objective to that referred to in<br />
paragraphs 16 to 28 above and a suggested tax on profit margins<br />
in excess of those in a base period. We saw no reason to prefer<br />
their suggestion for taxes on excess wage and salary payments to<br />
that we have examined in detail. While the proposal for a tax<br />
on excess profit margins is seen by the Adelaide economists as<br />
a desirable complement to a tax on excess wage and salary payments<br />
we found it necessary to reject it both conceptually and because<br />
of acute administrative difficulties.<br />
THE BALANCE OF PAYMENTS<br />
34. Generally the Committee felt that the tax system<br />
was not an appropriate instrument for dealing with general<br />
balance of payments problems whether they exist currently or<br />
are anticipated. There may be a case for encouraging Australian<br />
industries to involve themselves to a greater extent in exports,<br />
for instance, to take advantage of previously unrealised opportunities,<br />
or of possible economies of scale, and to expose the<br />
industries concerned to the competitive and technological stimulus<br />
of international markets. Such encouragement should therefore be<br />
selective outside the tax system, and follow examination of the </p>
<p>circumstances of each case. Desirably, the form and extent<br />
of the encouragement should be subject to Government and<br />
parliamentary scrutiny. Experience with the previous Government's<br />
export incentives schemes suggests that the tax concessions<br />
involved tended to reduce revenue without necessarily achieving<br />
significant results. H. C. Coombs ( Chairman)<br />
