PRIME MINISTER<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER THlE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
CANADA ANDl THE GST: A WARNING TO AUSTRALIA<br />
Mr Mulroney has now resigned as Prime Minister leaving<br />
Canada deep in the grip of rece-ssi-on with unemployment<br />
around 12 per cent, non-existent growth and a current<br />
account def icit of 4 1/ 4 per cent of GDP. Mr Mulroney<br />
and his Party's standing with the electorate have<br />
plummeted since they introduced a 7 per cent GST in<br />
January 1991 to replace a federal manufacturing sales tax<br />
of 13 1/ 2 per cent.<br />
The parallels with Australia if Dr Hewson were to be<br />
elected are very worrying.<br />
In Canada, Mr Mulroney was forced to omit food from his<br />
OST and he was also forced to reduce the rate from 10 per<br />
cent to 7 per cent because of fears about the equity of<br />
the GST and the negative impact that such a tax Fwould<br />
have on the Canadian economy.<br />
Mr Mulroney claimed that because his GST would replace a<br />
sales tax and because his GST exempted food, the CPI<br />
effect would be small at only 1.2 per cent. The CPI<br />
effect turned out to be close to 3 per cent.<br />
Mr Mulroney refused to recognise that his GST was having<br />
such a big impact on inflation in Canada and the Bank of<br />
Canada tried to squeeze inflation out of the system by<br />
holding up interest rates af ter the GST was introduced.<br />
The result was worsening recession, higher unemployment,<br />
declining living standards, economic dislocation and a<br />
terrible compliance burden on small business.<br />
In an attempt to escape the burdens of the GST, small<br />
business have started to barter their products. People<br />
are bartering plumbing services for dental services just<br />
to escape the dreadful impact of the tax. The cash<br />
economy is booming.<br />
Consumers are forced to shop in the USA to escape.<br />
This is what Australia faces if Dr Howson is elected,<br />
except for Australian consumers there is-no escape and<br />
the tax is twice as large. </p>
<p>2<br />
Dr Howson says his GST will put the CPI up by 2.1 per<br />
cent. It will not.<br />
All the experience around the world says it will be much<br />
higher and around 4 to 5 per cent.<br />
Just like in Canada, Dr Howson in Government would refuse<br />
to recognise the awful consequences of his GST and the<br />
Reserve Bank would be instructed to squeeze the surge in<br />
inflation from the system.<br />
Already Dr Howson has told the Reserve Bank that it will<br />
have only one objective.<br />
Keep inflation at 0 to 2 per cent.<br />
If Dr Hewson is elected, Australia would live out the<br />
Pointless tragedy that has just engulfed Canada.<br />
The recovery would be aborted, unemployment would rise<br />
further, living standards would fall, the exchange rate<br />
would rise, our exports would suffer and our current<br />
account would worsen.<br />
