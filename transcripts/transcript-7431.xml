PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 15 NOVEMBER 1988<br />
The Chairman of the Australian Selectors, Mr Lawrie Sawle,<br />
and I have chosen the following team to play for the<br />
Prime minister's XI against the West Indies at IManuka Oval<br />
on Thursday, 8 December 1988:<br />
Allan Border ( Captain) Queensland<br />
David Boon Tasmania<br />
Peter Gladigau South Australia<br />
Paul Jackson Victoria<br />
Stuart Law Queensland<br />
Geoff Lawson New South Wales<br />
Tom Moody West Australia<br />
Simon O'Donnell Victoria<br />
Mark Waugh New South Wales<br />
Steve Waugh New South Wales<br />
Michael Williams ( Wicket-keeper) Queensland<br />
Michael Bevan ( 12th Man) A. C. T.<br />
The side has a good balance of experience and youth and I am<br />
confident that Allan Border and his players will provide<br />
top-class competition to Viv Richards and his splendid team,<br />
as well as offering attractive cricket to the Canberra<br />
public.<br />
As in previous years, every state in Australia is<br />
represented. The team includes a number of players who have<br />
played in earlier PM's XI's as well as some making their<br />
debuts. of those who have appeared before, it will be great-to see<br />
Simon O'Donnell playing again in Canberra after making such<br />
a wonderful recovery from his illness. I am sure also that<br />
Canberra cricket lovers will look forward to seeing David<br />
Boon bat here again, bearing in mind his brilliant century<br />
against Clive Lloyd's team in January 1984.<br />
of the newcomers, Stuart Law will be the first student of<br />
the Australian Cricket Academy in Adelaide to represent the<br />
Prime Minister's XI and I am looking forward to seeing him<br />
play after his big Shield hundred in Brisbane the other day.<br />
The match will also give an opportunity to Michael Williams,<br />
the wicket-keeper of the National Aboriginal Cricket team<br />
which toured England so successfully earlier this year.<br />
Michael gave a very good account of himself behind the<br />
stumps when he played against my team at Manly in January<br />
and I understand that his keeping came on by leaps and<br />
bounds during the English tour. </p>
