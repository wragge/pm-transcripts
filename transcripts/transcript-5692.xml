FOR MEDIA MONDAY, 16 NOVEMBER 1981<br />
OPENING OF NEW PREMISES FOR EASTERN SUBURBS NEWSPAPERS<br />
It is a pleasure to be here today to open these new premises<br />
which are symbolic of the success of Eastern Suburbs Newspapers<br />
, in the printing and publishing field.<br />
This firm has been involved in newspapers and printing since<br />
the Hannan family took over the local Randwick newspaper<br />
in the 1930s and, in fact, Francis Hannan first started<br />
business in Randwick in 1887, so the origins of the progressive<br />
enterprise which is . reflected by these splendid new premises<br />
can be traced back nearly a hundred years. Eastern Suburbs<br />
Newspapers as such was formed twenty years ago as a partnership<br />
with John Fairfax and Sons and the Australian Consolidated<br />
Press, but third generation Hannans remain at the helm of<br />
Eastern Suburbs Newspapers.<br />
The kind of development which these new premises represent,<br />
where an old established firm searches out opportunities for<br />
modernisation and expansion, shows not only a well-informed<br />
confidence in the future of this industry, but also the kind<br />
of drive and initiative which the Government seeks to encourage.<br />
Without question, the centrepiece of these new premises is the.<br />
new Harris M200 Press which has been installed, and which<br />
makes this company one of the most up-to-date printeries in<br />
Austkalia, and should provide a sound basis for future<br />
expansion of the firm's activities. This new press is<br />
capable of printing up to thirty thousand copies per hour<br />
in four colour high quality form and I am looking forw-ard<br />
to pressing the button shortly to set it rolling.<br />
The Press has been fully installed only in the last few weeks<br />
but I understand that the company has already received a numbE~ r<br />
of new publication contracts, including many for monthly<br />
magazines. But for this new Press, some of these contracts<br />
would almost certainly have gone to overseas firms, and it is<br />
a matter for congratulation that publishing work which would<br />
have been commissioned outside Australia can now be carried<br />
on competitively in this country. / 2 </p>
<p>-2-<br />
I understand that Eastern Suburbs Newspepers now produces more<br />
than two hundred hewspapers and magazines on behalf of a -wide<br />
range of clients. In addition, this firm publishes five free<br />
weekly suburban newspapers on its own account, and with the<br />
recent launching of the Macquarie Courier, I understand that the<br />
total circulation of these five newspapers is well over<br />
300,000. The introduction of the Macquarie Courier itself<br />
illustrates the company's willingness to move ahead, to<br />
perceive a need in the community and take action to meet it.<br />
Eastern Suburbs newspapers has long recognised the niche in<br />
the newspaper world of the free suburban weekly in the large<br />
cities of Australia. Free suburban newspapers have-their--ow<br />
distinctive objectives, in particular, to provide relevant<br />
local information to large suburban communities, and it is<br />
difficult to imagine that the needs which these newspapers<br />
meet could be satisfied in any other way. I believe that*<br />
people need to recognise such newspapers, even though they are<br />
distributed free of charge, do not rely on advertising alone,<br />
because suburban weeklies which fail to provide interesting<br />
and relevant local news seldom manage to survive. By providing<br />
information about local events and services, such newspapers<br />
can also make a contribution to the development of that*<br />
sense of local community which can so easily be absent in<br />
large cities, and Isuch information can also enable significant<br />
numbers of people to discover for themselves , opportunities<br />
and activities which they would not-otherwise have realised<br />
were available.<br />
I believe there is a good deal of evidence of a renewed sense<br />
of community in many of the suburbs of Australia's great<br />
metropolitan centres, a willingness to take part in community<br />
activities and to take pride in the community itself. Such<br />
renewal will give added strength, stability and confidence to<br />
our nation because there can be no substitute for an informed<br />
and interested community, and a community's political<br />
institutions tend to function more democratically and responsibly<br />
when-there is a genuine sense of community identity.<br />
Suburban newspapers have the special responsibility of<br />
keeping the activities of local councils before the public<br />
mind. I know that Eastern Suburbs Newspapers employs journalists<br />
specifically to cover discussions and decisions of the<br />
coun ' cils in the circulation areas of their ~ papers. The<br />
activities of local government are seldom likely to be<br />
reported by the metropolitan dailies or through the<br />
electronic media, and yet the decisions of local councils of te~ n<br />
affect people in very immediate and significant ways. There<br />
is a very real challenge and responsibility for suburban<br />
weeklies in this connection, for local government affairs<br />
very often receive far less attention than they should. / 3 </p>
<p>3<br />
The local community needs to know about'the decisions that<br />
local authorities are taking, and there can be little doubt<br />
that a significant indicator of the success and calibre of<br />
suburban weeklies is the quality of their reporting of the<br />
affairs of local government as well as the wider interests<br />
which they reflect. It is no doubt with some regrets that<br />
you move a few kilometres down the road from your more<br />
familiar premises but the challenges to keep performing<br />
a useful role in the community and to keep prospering in a<br />
highly competitive industry remain the same.<br />
These new premises are an indication that this firm has met<br />
these challenges in the past, and they also hold out t'he<br />
promise of further success in the future. I wish Eastern<br />
Suburbs Newspapers every good fortune in their future<br />
enterprises, and have much pleasu in declaring these<br />
' premises open. oOo---</p>
