    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Australian Government today announced eight housing development projects which will share in $50 million under Round Two of the Housing Affordability Fund.</p>
<p>The $50 million investment will save home buyers an average of $20,000 for 3214 new homes and housing lots, and will bring more than 7,000 lots forward between six and 14 months faster than would otherwise have been the case.</p>
<p>Forming part of the $512 million Housing Affordability Fund, the $50 million investment will provide infrastructure such water pipes, sewerage, roadwork, and community facilities in the developments.</p>
<p>Today's announcement will be welcome news for families across the country looking for a new home, and will help unlock housing supply and improve housing affordability.</p>
<p>The successful projects are:</p>
<p>- $2 million for Ballarat City Council to prepare a Precinct Structure Plan for the Ballarat West Growth Area, Victoria. This will fast track land supply in the area, bringing forward much needed construction by 330 days.</p>
<p>- $1.5 million for Salisbury City Council to develop infrastructure at Parafield Gardens and Salisbury North, South Australia. This will deliver around $12,000 in savings to more than 120 homebuyers.</p>
<p>- $7.5 million for the New South Wales Department of Planning to provide infrastructure for the Bungarribee Residential Estate, near Blacktown. This will deliver around $20,000 in savings for 450 homebuyers.</p>
<p>- $8 million for the New South Wales Land and Housing Corporation to provide infrastructure in Seven Hills. This will deliver around $67,000 in savings to Community Housing Providers who will purchase 120 properties to rent as affordable housing.</p>
<p>- $11.5 million for Sunshine Coast Regional Council to deliver infrastructure in Palmview, Queensland. This will deliver around $26,000 in savings to around 450 homebuyers.</p>
<p>- $7 million to the Western Australian Housing Authority to cover the upfront costs of sewerage, water, gas, electricity and road connections in Henley Brook. This will take around $19,625 off the cost of around 350 new homes.</p>
<p>- $7.5 million to the Australian Capital Territory Land Development Agency for a collector road and bus route to provide public transport services to the residents of Crace.</p>
<p>- $5 million to the Northern Territory Department of Lands to establish infrastructure to support the Palmerston Land Release.</p>
<p>Additional Round Two recipients will be announced shortly.</p>
<p>Thirty-seven projects shared in around $120 million under Round One of the Housing Affordability Fund and the savings generated are already being passed onto to homebuyers.</p>
