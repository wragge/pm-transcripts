CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY EMBARGOED AGAINST DELIVERY<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
AAP EDITORIAL CONFERENCE<br />
GOLD COAST 11 JUNE 1987<br />
This is the second time that AAP haG hosted a conference for<br />
editors and news directors of the nation's media.<br />
It is in fact only the second time that such a conference<br />
has been held in Australia. I remember with pleasure<br />
addressing your first conference in May 1985 AAP's<br />
anniversary. I must begin therefore by congratulating AAP and its chief<br />
executive Lee Casey for again displaying the initiative to<br />
provide such a valuable forum for the men and women who<br />
produce the nation's news.<br />
As Harry Go~ rdon observes in the notes which accompany the<br />
conference agenda, it's not a bad idea for AAP, which acts<br />
as a vehiclo to the media, to provide this means of<br />
communication Eetween them.<br />
So I trust the conference will become a regular major event<br />
in the media calendar.<br />
If anything, the role of the editor and news producer is<br />
becoming even more important.<br />
For you are the people who are responsible for ensuring tho<br />
maintenance of our standards of freedom, accuracy and<br />
fairness in the media.<br />
Australiz hnas no inbuilt constitutional guarantee of the<br />
Freedom cf the Press comparable to the First Amendment of<br />
the US Constitution.<br />
Instead, it is part of the reality of Australian public life<br />
that the Australian media must operate within a web of<br />
common law protections of, for example, privacy and national<br />
security. But it is not parliament, and it is not the courts, and it<br />
is not the proprietors, but you editors and news producers,<br />
who must ensure on a day to day basis how that web of<br />
regulation is to apply. </p>
<p>I would be less than honest if I said that as a Politician 1<br />
agreed with every one of your editorial decisions on the<br />
reporting of politics in this country.<br />
That great Australian, my predecessor Ben Chifley, expressed<br />
a little of the* irritation Prime Ministers feel for the<br />
press when he observed:<br />
" I do not pretend to gaze into the crystal ball and foresee<br />
all that will happen in the future. That divine right or<br />
gift is given only to the editors of newspapers."<br />
But that does not mean I lack respect for the complexity of<br />
your task. The contrary is true.<br />
Even more importantly, I have frequently reaffirmed as Prime<br />
minister my belief as to the fundamental importance of the<br />
free press in the definition of Australia as a tree country.<br />
Some of Australia's neighbours disagree, and sometimtes,<br />
regrettably, they express that disagreement by restricting<br />
the ability of your staff members to do their job.<br />
only recently, during the tragic events in Fiji, we saw a<br />
military government crack down on a free press the first<br />
time we have witnessed in the South Pacific the knee-jerk<br />
repression of the media which is the familiar hallmark of<br />
authoritzrian regimes aroundi the world.<br />
Desp ' ite that crack down, I was proud and gratified that<br />
Australian journalists kept at their job and provided a<br />
detailed coverage of the coup and its follow-up.<br />
I believe this is an appropriate audience for me to express<br />
my personal gratitude and respect to those Australian<br />
journalists responsible for what was, overall, a<br />
professional and informed coverage of a very difficult<br />
story. The next few weeks will provide all of you with another<br />
difficult story.<br />
Federal election campaigns provide unparalleled examples of<br />
what I described before as your responsibility to protect<br />
the standards of a free, accurate and fair media.<br />
At no time is the need for such a media greater than at<br />
federal elections.<br />
At a time when the rest of the community takes sides, and<br />
expresses its divisions through the medium of the ballot<br />
box, it is vital that you remain independent and impartial.<br />
I certainly am not going to provide any advice to you about<br />
how you should go about your task in the lead-up to 11 July<br />
if, for no other reason, that you would tell me what,<br />
rather uncomfortably, to do with such advice. </p>
<p>But I do believe there is room generally for more coverage,<br />
and more detailed coverage, of -the complex economic issues<br />
our nation faces.<br />
Better technology and increasingly high standards of<br />
journalism mean that public discussion of the economy has,<br />
happily, been liberated from its traditional preserve on the<br />
editorial pages of upmarket broadsheet newspapers.<br />
Even so, however, I believe some of you have missed out on a<br />
great story or at least not given it the attention it<br />
deserves. It is a story about nothing less than the nature and future<br />
of the Australian nation.<br />
It is a story about a massive transformation taking place in<br />
our factories, our boardrooms, our financial institutions<br />
a great awareness starting to permeate the Australian<br />
society a historic watershed in our national development.<br />
I refer to the dramatic and exciting restructuring of the<br />
Australian economy which is underway.<br />
At the turn of the 21st century, Australians will regard the<br />
mid-1980s as among the most crucial in our history akin to<br />
the years of post-war reconstruction or to the growth of the<br />
gold mining and pastoral industries in our colonial days.<br />
They may be puzzled at the relative lack of attention given<br />
this story by parts of the ntedia of the day.<br />
Because they will appreciate that vital decisions and<br />
essential sacrifices were made.<br />
They will appreciate that the nation turned away from the<br />
traditional way of doing things and started out on a now<br />
approach. I am proud~ that after decades of neglect by conservative<br />
governments, it has been my government which has started<br />
out on this new path on the task of restructuring the<br />
Australian economy.<br />
We have realised, and, more importantly, acted on the<br />
realisation, that Australia as a nation of 16 million people<br />
cannot hope to maintain our comfortable standards of living<br />
by hoping the world will continue to pay us good prices for<br />
what we shear off the sheep's back or dig out of the ground.<br />
To maintain and increase those standards, we must diversify<br />
and restructure our economy, building more internationally<br />
competitive manufacturing and service industries.<br />
To foster the growth of those industries or more<br />
precisely, to foster the jobs and income those industries<br />
will provide for Australia has been the rationale behind<br />
the profound changes my Government has made to the economic<br />
institutions in this country. </p>
<p>We flo~ tod the dollar with the result that Australian<br />
exporters are more competitive.<br />
we deregulated the financial markets with the result that<br />
capital c: in flow into Australia more easily to help build<br />
our economy.<br />
we sought the cooperation of the trade union movement to<br />
secure wage restraint with the result that our export<br />
industries can compete effectively on world markets.<br />
We are woll on the way to reducing the protection which had<br />
allowed our small manufacturing base to eschew the challenge<br />
of exporting and service instead the small domestic market.<br />
We are giving increasing emphasise to education and training<br />
and to ensuring that our workers have relevant and adaptablo<br />
skills.<br />
The Australian media industry, too, has undergone profound<br />
change, which will result in a more competitive structure<br />
which is nore capable of exploiting the opportunities<br />
offered by new technology.<br />
This hao been in part duo to the Government's new media<br />
legislation which was approved by Parliament in the final<br />
week of the autumn session.<br />
The five m. illion regional viewers who currently receive<br />
only one commercial service and who will now receive two<br />
extra survices will rapidly appreciate the benefits of the<br />
new structure.<br />
It is ou' intention that this legislation will bring to<br />
regional viewers the kind of broadcast services hitherto<br />
solely available to viewers in the capital cities, not leact<br />
by giving country viewers access to a third television<br />
station. The 30-17ear-old two station rule on ownership and control of<br />
commercial television was replaced with a 60% population<br />
reach rule.<br />
Together with the provision of increased regional serviceo<br />
this new rule will foster the development of more balanced<br />
and stronger commercial TV services.<br />
The new structure will also ensure that your viewers and<br />
readers have diversity in their sources of information, by<br />
ending cross-media ownership.<br />
The new legislation will also bring to city and country<br />
viewers alike significant networking capacity with all the<br />
advantages that will bring in cost saving and in the<br />
encourageiaent of greater Australian content.<br />
I am confident too that the changes will ensure the<br />
retention of the strong competitive streak which has<br />
characterised the Australian media since its early days. </p>
<p>Competition will flourish for the first time in regional<br />
television -vhere none now exists; and competition will<br />
continue to flourish in the newspaper industry where,<br />
alongside the giants of News Ltd and the Fairfax group, a<br />
number of second tier newspaper groups has sprung up.<br />
At the samie time the cross-media agglomerations, which have<br />
typified t10 Australian media industry since the newopaper<br />
proprietors saw the potential of radio in the 1920s, will be<br />
significantly broken down.<br />
Let me also briefly list some of the other innovations<br />
introduced by my Government in the interests of increasing<br />
the competition and quality of the Australian media.<br />
. the SBS network has grown substantially. Since M~ arch<br />
1983 SBS se:: vices have been extended to Canberra, Cooma,<br />
Goulburn, Nws~ castle, Adelaide, Brisbane, Wollongong, Perth,<br />
Hobart and the Gold Coast.<br />
* ABC's second regional radio network, to be opened in<br />
Duffy, on 213 June provides a second ABC service for those<br />
parts of tho country which currently receive only one ABC<br />
station.<br />
Some 80 transmitters are to be installed in Queensland,<br />
western Austrcalia and the Northern Territory this year, with<br />
about 300 cites to be included In the network over the next<br />
decade, ABC TV eiid radio services are also being extended to<br />
remote aree 5. The Remote or Underserved Commuunities Scheme<br />
will bring A3C services to 42 small communities in New South<br />
Wales, Victo:: ia and Western Australia which have never had<br />
them beforo. The Homestead and Community Broadcasting<br />
Satellite Scheme is enabling even smaller communities to<br />
receive ABC :' adio and TV for the first time via satellite.<br />
Australiz's regional residents will also benefit from the<br />
expansion oZ the commercial FR radio licences currently<br />
being plannzd. It is our intention where possible that<br />
these services will be provided by new operators.<br />
Twenty-seven markets will receive new markets by 1989 with<br />
the Gold CoF. st among the first batch.*<br />
. A third commercial television licence for Perth is<br />
expected to commence service on Australia Day 1988.<br />
. Community and special interest groups have not been left<br />
out. Twenty-six new public stations have been licensed<br />
since March 1983. Radio services for the print handicapped<br />
are in the process of moving onto the broadcast bands where<br />
they can be received by everyone.<br />
. In telecom~ munications, AUSSAT's first satellites have<br />
been launchecd and are operating; Telecom's national fibre<br />
optic link has been started; and Telecom has also introduced<br />
new services including Viatel and teletex. </p>
<p>Another recent innovation is the concept of Video and<br />
Audio Entertainnent and Information Services ( VAEIS) such<br />
as Sportoplay and Skychannel. These services provide sport<br />
and entertainment packages to Clubs, Hotels and other<br />
non-doametic users.<br />
The achicvements I believe are, by any standard, impressive.<br />
They will ensuro that your viewers and readers receive more<br />
of the high quality services they deserve and expect.<br />
The medii ic not, as I have already said, an area in which<br />
any Government intervention is desirable in terms of what<br />
you report day by day or how you report it.<br />
But we do have a role in attempting to create the framework<br />
particularly in the electronic media in which as many<br />
people an possible can gain access to a diverse range of<br />
your services.<br />
I bolivo wo have done that.<br />
We have welcomed, and will continue to welcome, new players<br />
in the media industry.<br />
Ultimately however your responsibility as the principal<br />
disseminatcrs of information in our society is the koy<br />
one. I wish you well in that task. _ I </p>
