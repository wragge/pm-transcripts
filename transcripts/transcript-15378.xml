    <content><![CDATA[<p>Since I announced the Commonwealth's $10 billion National Plan for Water Security both the Victorian and Queensland Premiers have asked me to convene a meeting of the Commonwealth and relevant state and territory leaders. </p>
<p>Given the importance of this issue and the need to proceed to implementation of the plan as soon as possible, I am more than happy to respond to the requests of both Mr Bracks and Mr Beattie </p>
<p>I therefore propose a meeting in the Cabinet room, Parliament House, at 10 am next Thursday, February 8. </p>
<p>If essential parliamentary or other business makes this date impractical for the states and territories, I suggest Friday the 9th or Monday the 12th of February, also at 10am, as alternatives. </p>
<p>The Murray-Darling Basin states and territories are New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland, South Australia and the Australian Capital Territory. </p>
<p>Given the national significance of the Commonwealth's plan, I shall also invite the other Premiers and the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory to attend if that is their wish. </p>
