<p>Itâs great to be here with you.</p>
<p>I should report that I have recently been speaking with Stephen Harper just to let him know how the Australian Parliament stands in solidarity with the Canadian Parliament at this time.</p>
<p>It was a shocking attack but it demonstrates that the threat to free peoples and free institutions is real and it is worldwide.</p>
<p>I should also note that this is the 70th anniversary of our great Party and for seven decades our Party has promoted economic security and national security â these are the things we have stood for.</p>
<p>I said constantly before the election, and I have said frequently since the election, that our plan was to build a strong and prosperous economy for a safe and secure Australia.</p>
<p>I have done more on a safe and secure Australia over the last few months but it is important that we never neglect that strong and prosperous economy which is the foundation of a secure country that we want and need.</p>
<p>I also said before the election that we would scrap the carbon tax, stop the boats, build the roads of the 21st century and get the Budget back under control. The carbon tax is gone, the boats have largely stopped, the roads are starting and, compromise by painful compromise, the Budget is coming back under control.</p>
<p>This is delivering benefits for the Australian people.</p>
<p>We discovered this week that power prices have fallen.</p>
<p>The biggest fall in history.</p>
<p>The biggest fall in power prices since records were kept.</p>
<p>So, this shows that if you get the economic fundamentals right there are benefits from the Australian people and we can deliver a strong and prosperous economy for a safe and secure Australia. Thatâs what we all want. Thatâs what we all deserve. That is what the Liberal Party has always been best at delivering.</p>
<p>Finally, I should say what an honour it is to be sitting next to my friend and colleague Richard Alston. We have had some great presidents. Richard has big shoes to fill, but I know he is ready, willing and able.</p>
