PRIME MINISTER<br />
-TRANSCRIPT OF GEORGE NEGUS SPEAKING TO MR HAWKr-2UE 2 JUNE 1986<br />
E .0 -PROOF ONLY<br />
-NEGUS: Are you there Mr. Haw3k?<br />
M1. AWKE; Good day George, how are you?<br />
NEGUS: Ifm well thatnkyou. We dragged you kicking and screaming out<br />
* of an important meeting I gather.<br />
HAWKE: I beg your pardon?<br />
NEGS: We dragged you kicking and scyeaming froM an important meeting<br />
Igather? M. IAWE; Oh Never kicking, never screaming, but always willing to<br />
have a yarn with you George.<br />
-NEGUS: A few things on your mind at the moment I'd say.<br />
MR. HIAWKE: Oh yes but I'm not unrelaxed George, just working away<br />
steadily at them and we will. get the right policy to deal with this<br />
* situation that has been imposed upon us by this drastic decline in<br />
permanent trade.<br />
N. EGUS;. Let's talk about that in a moment but before we do I was<br />
talking earlier to another old mate of yours Jim McC~ eAck-c about<br />
this whole question of minders which has become very much a public<br />
is√± sue for the first time that I can recall in politics. How in<br />
heayens name do people like yourself and Paul Keating allow the minders<br />
to become a public issue?<br />
Mr. HAWKE; Well 1 have'nt made them a public issue is the only<br />
-omment I can make about that.<br />
N EGLJS; Well Paul did.<br />
MR. HAWKE: Well he di~ l anid eh that's an end to it now and I'm not<br />
going to say anything that's going to fuel it. I simply would make<br />
::: the point that I did only reiterate the only public comment I made.<br />
This is as you know, you've been around the place, it's a hothouse<br />
atmosphere of politics in Canberra. and you've got to recognise<br />
that In that some tensions arise. But as far as I'm concerned my<br />
staff, as Paul's starf and rstaff of other Ministers' are loyal to<br />
their Ministers, loyal to their Government, and they are doing a<br />
fine job ad as far as I'm concerned they'r'e doing a f ine job, and<br />
as far as I'm concerned that's the end of the matter. </p>
<p>NZGrS. Could I put it to. you this way' One person said to me<br />
-ovrthe weekend " Paul Keating, pickingj on, if you like, Bob<br />
ff-. aw. ksminders is a way of telling him that he's not getting good<br />
adviCe, which is another way of telling him that he's not doing the<br />
rjght thing.<br />
* mD. IAWKE: Oh well, I say you can'do your speculation. As far as<br />
* I'm concerned the matter iu ended and I'm not going to engage in<br />
,4nfyf, in any,. sort of public discussion about it which would keep<br />
gigsomething which is miniscule, in it's significance.<br />
NSCS: C anI skyou this an hnwe'll get off the minC-ers.<br />
~ ecause there are more important things, I agree. How do you feel<br />
then, ow would you make people eel better about the fact that<br />
there would appear to be in Canberra, a group of blokes, working<br />
for you and for other ministers, who appear to have incre. dible<br />
: power, incre dible influence over elected politicians, and people<br />
* As important in the h-q as yourself. How cdn you make in a<br />
democratic: society as, weIqke to think we are, how can you make<br />
people feel better about those kind of. unelected people swinging<br />
herweight around behind the scenes?<br />
HAWKE: This is something which goes on in all democracies<br />
and haB gone in on this country Since we've been a parlimentary<br />
., democracy. Elective figures always have people on their staff and<br />
in this day and age I think there's more of it on both sides<br />
o6f politics and it's a good thing.<br />
IEGS; Do you think it'G possible they overstep the mark occasionally?<br />
M4R. HAWKE: Let me finish. I. think that in an increasingly<br />
complex worla any elected figures that have got responsibility<br />
. re foolish if they don't try and get as much good. profesaional<br />
. advceas they can and then be in a position of having heard<br />
hat people have to0 say, then you make up your own mind. And<br />
the way I operate and I know it's theway my Ministers<br />
operate. They try and get a~ s much as adviCe as they can, then<br />
* having got the advic-e they make the decisions, and that'G the<br />
. way in a Gensible democracy it ought to happen.<br />
UEGJS: How often would you say that you have your mind changed<br />
-by your minders?<br />
N;-.? R. HAWKE: I reject the word minders and i'm not going to accept<br />
the word minders.<br />
N4EGUS: How uhall we describe them then do<br />
you. reckon? Itow should we describke them?<br />
MR.: HAWKE: Staff I mean it'It.; a pretty simple w ell known and<br />
. accurate expression. So i suggest that it be used.<br />
i:' NENGUS, So from now on the word minders, we're going to strike<br />
itfrom the old political dictionary.<br />
HRHAWKE; I don't mind it being lasnad, it's inaccurate and if<br />
pcoplo want to be inaccuiatC Jr, the: ir lanrjua'Je then that's<br />
Ilr igh t. bu t I'm accurati-, iii my. u-' c of lanqu. Ige. </p>
<p>' 2NGt~.. Iguess, one of the reasons why people are concerned by<br />
the* use of. that, word, and this is wha't you would . p: 0bably like to<br />
try and stop, in that from that television seriese theM) inder/ is<br />
bloke who goes round thumping people on behalf * of someone else,<br />
nd maybe that's what people thought your minders have been doin . g,<br />
6O. Paul Keating has been suggesting that. they are leaning on people.<br />
MR.* HAWKEi None of them are built in that proportion George.<br />
NEGUS:. One of them at least is a fairly sturdy bloke as I recall.<br />
tA R. -HAWYE; Plumpish.<br />
: lNEGUS: Pluwpish, not to put too finer point on it. I thank,. o<br />
~' for'saying that because I realise that the minders thing is something<br />
;. O. that is not often talked about in Australian politics.<br />
MR. HAWKE: As I have moved around Australia in the last few days<br />
-no o) ne, but no one has raised it with me.<br />
Really? Well the newspapers have wriftc-*% about it at least<br />
we've all gota little tooclose to it do you think?<br />
' t4R. HAWKE I Yes, this. is often the case, I mean I'm constantly<br />
. mused, literally amused, by the fact the old scribes<br />
~ wri~ e away., and I move around the country and see thousands of<br />
~ eople and never get the issue raised with me.<br />
-NEGUS: Well, anyway, give, give<br />
-KR. HAWKE; The ordinary Australian people, your liste. c.. S and the<br />
oriaynesae reader is a little more astute often than the<br />
pe~ othat do the writ% 4-.<br />
Nt~ GUS-Er, anyway, give Peter and Geoff and Bob my regards.<br />
HAWKE: Yes, I'll pass it on to my staff.<br />
~ EGt1S: Urn, Mr. Hawke, You've said that you've drawn stumps on this<br />
; K; weoa, tein gis Vlsiukee. ly Butot raerseo ltvhee othbevmiosuesl vedsi ffine rethnce esn eabre twfeuetun rey, o u baencda usMer.<br />
*.. that seems to be almost the politicadl issue in the country today,<br />
* Can. Bob Hawke and Paul Keating get their economic act together?<br />
MR. IAK: wasn't aware of them, so, perhaps again this is<br />
acaso where those who arc removed from the acene know what<br />
* tceat the scene don't know. Would you tell me what the obvious<br />
differences are le ere<br />
N E GUS t Well, I'll tell you the differencesi that people have percieved<br />
I ian HAWKE.-<br />
0 E GU Si Pardon?<br />
SmR. HAWKE: What are they in your opinion? </p>
<p>4-<br />
N -E: G 1 It would seczr thAt niobody is certain at the moment who is<br />
i n tact calling-the economic. sho t 9?<br />
lhAaWtE ; ho dos tatmake a difference? Wh a t<br />
tdhf freceis there between Mr. Keating and myself<br />
24~ US: Well if you agree,<br />
-OR, .1AWKS: Sure about who's calling the shots, let me<br />
6~ iear that up for them. I'm in charge of this( government and I'm<br />
~ charge of ' it's directions, and very specifically at this<br />
Xnomdnt I'm chairing the meeting of Ministers';* which is dealing with<br />
. i-tke reconsideration of any policy decisions which we think are<br />
tiecessaryto deal with this current difficult, e* Xternal, economic,<br />
, s6it: uation, now those are the facts. Now where are the differences?<br />
~ ImG U S Dia it come as a great surprise to you? I' was out of the<br />
, c ou ntr. y myself, so I'm asking youa genuine question. Were you shocked<br />
an) d indeed angry as it has been suggested, when Paul Keating annouL* Cec<br />
to the world that we should probably have what's being called a<br />
miLni economic summit.<br />
HAWKE: To be fair to Paul he didn't announce that we should<br />
; have a mini economic summit. What happen was thct there was a<br />
meet~ ing of the back had to advise the committee on<br />
, pri. ccs and iricome6, and that it emerged that perhaps some people<br />
i" t hought it might be an idea to have an extended meeting. Now both<br />
* Pui and. RalIph, sa id wellI , i f you wa nt to ext end the mee t ing t hat ' s<br />
niot ' a bad idea, we'll agree to, that, / 4nd then out of that,<br />
and . I'ye seen the transcripts, the media buil+ up some of the<br />
c.. onc epts and they're quite inaccurate. It couldn't he_, gz had anything<br />
JCGtIS So you don't think that your friend Paul would try to<br />
' tthe jump on you?<br />
: MR. H9AWK?.: Vo.<br />
You definitely don't.<br />
SHAWKE. Tha t'sa f air cnouq. 1<br />
bfl. HAWKE: Listen the diffc~ t~ t, cet; between Mr. Keating and myself,<br />
efore this programme is over, If you don't mind, I woula like<br />
49ut toll me what the differences are.<br />
tEGt7S Well, what about. this then, _ ou ' ye announced now that<br />
-you r a going to make a statement, a statement to the nation if you<br />
, Jke or. economic matters. H-ad you planned, had you<br />
14 RHAWKE; George, that'a right.<br />
.14GUS: Sorry, that will be noxt week? </p>
<p>h. JAK: That will be next week. That's what I said and<br />
: t ats what Ivsidteahpint. I'm not telling you something<br />
tia t. I have'nt saiO new about six'times.<br />
: tEGIJS: Right. Well let me ask you this then?<br />
.; i4IR. HAWKEt Yep.<br />
EGJS: Had you planned to make that ecos'o;,' ic statem~ ent to the nation<br />
,,,:. before Paul keating suggested that tie wanted an eccor. omic summit?<br />
O* a fter.<br />
'. M. HAWKE. No, it was after, It had no relation to that meeting<br />
itiha a relation to was the emergence of not<br />
j3us t the balance of paymlents figure but then the ' national accounts<br />
jigu're which b ave put in a very dark form those national<br />
, accounfti gures came out last week. Put in a very stark fc-ras tahat<br />
ie tere aware was emerging and that is a losp of national<br />
xi' ncome as a result of the drastic fall in export ' prices compared with<br />
. m p o rt prices. I mean with throwing a whole lot of statistics<br />
a, you George Very simple one is this, in the last twelve months<br />
u p to the end of the March quarter, we've lost the equivalent of three<br />
per cent of our Gross Domestic Product as a result of the turn-around<br />
i. An the terms of trade. And no respondible Goverrnment confronted<br />
vihthose factual statistics, can say well alright we don't take<br />
L 4~ yc contof it. So what I said is right, we're going to have a<br />
' m eeting of the relevant Ministers and we'* re goingj to<br />
~ n~ ierwhat steps need to be taken to protect the interests<br />
6 t e Aue'tralian people in that situation. And in those<br />
_-,-orcumstances as part of thosfe dircussions with my Cabinet and my<br />
C' Jinisters. I said, well I will be bringing together that statement<br />
and. making a statement to the people of Australia-Now that, in<br />
: a quite uncomplicated and totall! emerged.<br />
-bkEGUS And Paul thinks that is a good idea? we'll go to a break<br />
-in a moment Mr. Hawke and come back and talk about just how bad<br />
,.. you reckon the economnic situation is.<br />
i-K. R.,, HAWKJE9 4tu ibreak, you'll come back and tell me<br />
t the differences are right.<br />
-OREGUS: .1* 11 try very<br />
tR.. HAWKE: ' Righto.<br />
,~ iNEGUS: Back in a moment.<br />
NEGUS; Back B~ ob Hawke, The Prime Mini-ttejr whose asking as<br />
MAo3y questions as I am at thetuomente which is fair enough, under<br />
the circumutalcetU You auked me what I thought the differences<br />
weebetweon you aricI Piit. I Kc-irxq<br />
Hl. AWKE: * Yes.<br />
l~ CS: Ithink it'n probably fair to niay 1. hat, on economic matters<br />
you probably have very few differenrces. You'd, agree with that? </p>
<p>' J~ KR. HAWI~ Thankyou.<br />
fl GJS~ Only a matter of uetail ]) eye and there.<br />
~ 4HAWKE; Yes, that's right George, I mean if Y~ ou look back over<br />
A*.' the ' three years, I think the formulation of econqmic policy has<br />
been very much a Hawke, Keating a c~ t i( n It's true at<br />
: pj articular point we might have had a slight difference then, but<br />
: very much a oprtov. ad ebelieve , effective effort.<br />
ltEGUSS Still, still mates, is he still a regular visitor at the<br />
' fHA4WRK E: Of course we're matvs. I mean politicians and<br />
*;', ooleyou know, as volatile ae both Paul and I, you'll have<br />
*.... moments when if you've got a bit of a difference ' about something<br />
-,-You % ron't express it in aciw/ all. y elegant, Victorian, drawing<br />
romlanguage,<br />
fj'J G US√± I can't imagine you or him doing that.<br />
R. HAWKE: That's right, but Welee_<br />
.,: NICGUS Could 1 put it-to you this way then? I ' d agree that<br />
youreprobably on the same path eccnomically, but politically,<br />
i~ aybe things have got a little bit astray?<br />
HMR. 1AWKE: Ncot I don't think that'-s<br />
:' lV EUS: What oddG would you give Paul Keatirg as Lbeing your successor?<br />
HjR HAWKE; Oh, I'm not goi. ng to enter into t ha t. Ivs 4'-<br />
Paul, nor to any other aspirant. I've said, and I'm woz-e<br />
' that' happy to repeat, Paul is a very 9, bvious candidate<br />
r, . to 8uccead me c \ vry obvious candidate, and as he has said, and I<br />
haesaid when I step down, it will be for the party to make<br />
choice.<br />
. NECaus: Do you think he would have been all that thrilled by<br />
. complimentary noises you were making about Kjv\ 4 Teazley the<br />
~ Defr~ ccminister recently.<br />
M A. HAWKE:' Of courge he would because Kiti. and Paul are the<br />
;, 6* osest of mates axnd friends they spend a lot of time together,<br />
i~ t'. they have-thtu utmost respect for one another.<br />
NE~ IS: Would you still rate Paul Keatingj aG the fin~ est<br />
' Finance Minister or Treasurer in the world the Way you did some<br />
le a r a..<br />
NHR. JAWKEt the hest Treasurer in the world, of course </p>
<p>EJGUS: Do youthink it'a possible, as somebody looking At Australia<br />
the moment and seeing what's going on with the economy and the<br />
.,:. Problems that you're facing, I") it possible that rather than you<br />
running the country, or Paul Xeating running the country or even*<br />
your. Mindars running td. co'untry, that the country is running you?<br />
ItHAWKE: well, in a sense it's true for any politician in the<br />
:, western world today that his own, his or her own economy and the<br />
economy runs them. And it's quite incisiveque stion<br />
. orge.<br />
-, NEGUS s I've got one.<br />
HAWKE: It is economic events that determine to a very I a rge*<br />
extent in western democracy's political outcome, and that's why<br />
from the day I became leader of this party in February, C-f<br />
83 I made it clear that economic matters that were central to<br />
task of political management and we came to office then<br />
. With the economy in the worst rec ession for fifty years,<br />
, s you know. And my central commit,-,-Paul's central' commit--J-.<br />
-~ and the Governments central comt~,~-was to turn that round and<br />
v. e ' ye done that, and had rates of growth the highest in the<br />
western world and employment growth's the highest in our history.<br />
Now, having done that in cooperation with the Australian public,<br />
-~ and I Bay to yourlistners I mean that, we just haver-' 1 made<br />
.4he right decisions here, the Australian people, the ordinary<br />
* Australian people ha'.' e cooperated and together we have done it.<br />
NEGLJS: Did you say that you hadn't made the right decisions?<br />
' fP id I get you right there?<br />
* MR. MAWKEt I beg you pardon?<br />
NEGUS; Did you say that on occaslcv you hadn't made the right<br />
ee' c is io n a<br />
M'R. HAWKE: I'm saying that I th~ ink we consistently have made<br />
the right decison, I'm saying that we Louldn't do it ourselves,<br />
* sitting in Canberra making decisions. e rceded the cooperation,<br />
of the Australian people, and we've had it. Now three years down<br />
the~ track. there's been a massive decline in the prices we get for<br />
Swhat we all. overseas. And our import prices are still rising so<br />
* that means an all in real capacity within Australia to<br />
, sustain atandards, and wev: got to deal with that. NIow what<br />
I'm doing with my flinisters is to fine tune cur strategy so that<br />
NEGUS√± Can I come in there, Can I come in there just for a moment.<br />
People probably accept the tact that you've got problems, we'vye<br />
all, got problems, and you are tryin, to fine tune, and obviously<br />
.,, there is no quick fiX, no overnight rc-for this sort of thing<br />
4z when your talking about Austrailia',, economy being affected by<br />
;...... international economic movements. Do you have any idea how long<br />
you. reckon it will take before you will be able to may to mec and to<br />
a nybody else, for that matte-:. Yecl\ we reckon we ' ve got th.;<br />
economy norted ., ut. </p>
<p>8g<br />
MR. HAWKE: Well, we've got the Australian ecomnfy is not un-sor ted<br />
out. With what's happening internally is basically ' correct<br />
What we've got to do. is to adjust to the fallen capacity Iin~ obed'<br />
upon us from outside.. Now you ask how lon~ g, we'll1 make the decis). ohV. Ij.<br />
and i'll announce them next week, the changes arid fine tunings that'<br />
a re necessary. Now,' of course George, in part, the anOUwOr av fo. 0<br />
. ng the sort of restraints will be necessary, relate to the<br />
basic question-How long are the terms of trade gcincj to M oi ng<br />
as adversely as this~? I hope, and particularly not just f-o thle<br />
sake of Australia ac a whole but for the sake of our farmers that''<br />
we start to get some lift in our price from rural exports because,*<br />
they are terribly low. I hope for our miners that we get an<br />
improvement, a further improvement in prices for min~ erals, p r d 4 6 t W<br />
I think the only honest thing one can say George is that' the,<br />
with the lift in international economic activity that'o go-in gq to bt:"<br />
associated with cheaper energy prices I think we can expect the'<br />
change to come somewhat sooner than perhaps we would have expected q<br />
NEGUS: We' re running out of time, you mentioned restr'ir, t~ s are yodi<br />
able to put your f inger on what kind of restraints peopl e can,<br />
lor forward to, or * not look forward to?<br />
MR. HAWKE: &gt; wish your new programme well, when I announde<br />
those decisions they will tE icot on your proartimme, I'm sorry about-%-≈ì t j<br />
that NEGUS: That's alright as long as they're not on someone elses.<br />
MR. HAWKE: I'll give you that undertaking it w. or.' t be<br />
on someone else.<br />
NEGUS: we're just. about out of time. How's the old soda w'ater<br />
drinking going?-<br />
mR. HAWKE: Oh, still as exciting as ever.<br />
NEGUS: You'd be just about a connoisseur by now wouldn't you?<br />
MR. HAWKE; Yep. well, authority.<br />
NEGUS: I was burprised to hear a couple of weeks ago you mumbling<br />
the word retirement, or people were using it. in reference to yoursel.--<br />
that came as a bit of a 3urprLSe to Me. J<br />
