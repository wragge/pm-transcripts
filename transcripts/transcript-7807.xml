SPREE BY " M MINSTE<br />
1969IP -13 NU 1989<br />
Last Wednesday I had the pleasure of presenting the<br />
Australian Quality Awards to a nuber of companies who have<br />
demonstrated their coitment and their capacity to improve<br />
the quality of Australian goods and services.<br />
Today I have the equal pleasure of participating in this<br />
presentation of the 1959 Australian Export Awards, in which<br />
we honour the achievement of those whto compete,, and succeed,<br />
in the world's markets.<br />
By themselves, these two Awards show that some companies, at<br />
least, have learned the funaena lesson of the Australian<br />
economy: that we need to compete efficiently on world<br />
sarkets if we are to achieve sustainable prosperity for<br />
ourselves and for our children.<br />
But taken in conjunction with reforms being implemented<br />
throughout the economy,, these Quality and Export Awards show<br />
that this manage is being understood and acted upon not<br />
just by a few companies that have won the Awards not just<br />
by he finalists in each of the Awards but very generally<br />
b~ qout the commity.<br />
Australia learning the lesson of economic survival.<br />
Australians Wre starting to implement the necessary changes<br />
to ensure we are a compeitive and successful economy.<br />
Over the year since I addressed the Bicentennial Export<br />
Award finalists,, much of the attention of economic<br />
cometators baa focused on the current account deficit and<br />
on the alleged inability or unillingness of Australian<br />
industry to compute. This alleged reluctance to whave a go"<br />
is attribuated to our lack of an export culture in other<br />
words, to our lack of confidence in ourselves and in<br />
Australia' a long term economic future. </p>
<p>Let me make it very clear today that the export pessimists<br />
who hold such views have got it wrong.<br />
We need look no further than the enormous success our<br />
primary producers have had over decades in winning markets<br />
overseas in developing products to meet new market<br />
opportunitiesi in competing with the best of their foreign<br />
rivals and consistently beating them in price and quality<br />
be it in wool, grains, meats, minerals or metals.<br />
You don't hear the allegations made against these primary<br />
producers that Australians don't have the nous or the guts<br />
to export.<br />
Importantly, those successful exporters are competing<br />
without the intervention or protection of Government. our<br />
primary comaodity exports are among the most efficient<br />
that is, the most unprotected in the world.<br />
Many of our manufacturers have not developed this export<br />
culture precisely because it has not, in decades past, been<br />
required of then.<br />
cocooned by protectionism, they were not only discouraged<br />
from seeking overseas markets, they were actually incapable<br />
of successful overseas competition because of the tariff<br />
component of their pricing.<br />
But you don't have to look only at primary producers at<br />
industries where we have been blessed by nature with<br />
magnificent resources, and where we have developed<br />
production expertise over generations to see that<br />
Australians can and do export.<br />
Look at some of our more recent industries in the services<br />
sector. Tourism, conaultancies and education services are<br />
all earning valuable foreign dollars by creating, offering<br />
and marketing services that are in demand overseas.<br />
I know tourist operators are going through difficult tines<br />
now. But I think we all know that Australia's attractions<br />
as a tourist destination are peranent ones, and our ability<br />
to provide foreign tourists with memorable and unique<br />
vacation experiences will survive the teporary, albeit<br />
significant, disruption operators are facing at present.<br />
So let's not lament our alleged lack of an export culture.<br />
we do have an export culture, we are good exporterst we only<br />
need to expand these attitudes and practices of<br />
competitiveness throughout the economy.<br />
The finalists and winners represented here know that. </p>
<p>i want to express my thanks to the sponsors and orqanisers<br />
of this year's Australian Export Awards and I want to<br />
congratulate all the finalists on their achievements.<br />
As a group, the finalists have contributed more than $ 1.7<br />
billion in export earnings for 1988-89 by selling goods and<br />
services ranging from artificial sno making equipment to<br />
ophthalmic lenses.<br />
The winners, when they are announced shortly, will know<br />
their victory puts then at the head of a very competitive<br />
list of companies. They really are the cream, and deserve<br />
our heartiest congratulations.<br />
But the basis for optiuism in Australia's export orientation<br />
lies, as I have said, not just in the treendous<br />
achievements of these individual companies.<br />
It is apparent throughout the economy.<br />
Over the past year we have seen a real increase in business<br />
investment of over 15 per cent. Business investment as a<br />
share of total national production is at its highest level<br />
since statistics were kept.<br />
In addition, Access Economics' recent survey, of large<br />
investment products with a potential to earn foreign<br />
exchanqe, istA projects worth $ 49 billion that are under<br />
construction or commtted.<br />
This survey is important in two ways. First, it highlights<br />
the sharp contrast between the current investment surge and<br />
the last " investment boonm of the early 1980s.<br />
The current surge is spread over a wide range of<br />
manufaoturers, including transport equipment, chemicals,<br />
paper and printing, steel and food processing, and tourist<br />
activities.<br />
This year's Export Awards reflect this trend, with finalists<br />
in comndities, consultanoies, high-tech manufacturing and<br />
tourism.<br />
And second, the Access Economics survey confirms the<br />
substantial export implications of this investment.<br />
Access Sconomics identifies 6 major investment projects<br />
either coming on stream or already under construction which<br />
in a few years are expected to generate close to $ 5 billion<br />
a year in foreign exchange. </p>
<p>This is equivalent to about 10 per cent of the value of<br />
goods and services exports in 1988-89# or, in term of our<br />
current account dot bit, about 30 per cent for the same<br />
period. of course, part of the argument of the export peshimists is<br />
that what investment we do see is largely replacement driven<br />
and not now investment for export.<br />
Preliminary survey work by the Bureau of Industry Economics<br />
suggests that this view, too, is misleading.<br />
Much of the so-called replacement investment involves<br />
substantial capital enhancement substituting competitive<br />
capacity for uncompetitiv, capacity, which in turn increases<br />
our ability to produce and compete on world and domestic<br />
arkets.<br />
Manufacturers surveyed by the Bureau did not see their<br />
investment as being purely for replacement: they envisage<br />
that capital upgrading will result in both capacity gains<br />
and unit costs reduction. both of which are vital if we<br />
are to gear up our export effort.<br />
Close to two thirds of this yearl's Export Award entrants<br />
report having invested in now equipment or facilities<br />
primarily geared for exporting.<br />
so contrary to the pessimistic view, we have made<br />
considerable progress and our self-image, our strategic<br />
vision, is changing from the inward-looking focus of the<br />
past. But I don't want in any of thi. to sound like Pangloss who<br />
pretended that all was for the best.<br />
I certainly don't believe we can be complacent about the<br />
task of extending the export culture throughout our economy.<br />
But I do argue and I argue it with pride and great<br />
conviction in this forum that we don't do ourselves any<br />
sort of justice by imagining we are incapable of making a<br />
very big impact, with all our products, in the world market.<br />
My Government is determined to do all it can to facilitate<br />
this crucial progress.<br />
I don't went, here, to give you a lecture on micro-economic<br />
reform, but I make the two point, that firfst, we are<br />
embarked on an unprecedented program of reform to lift the<br />
productivity of the nation and, second, we have made further<br />
big strides since I spoke at last year's Awards. </p>
<p>Financial deregulation, tariff reductions, company tax<br />
reform, ending the two airline agreement, bringing<br />
competition to areas of telecommunications such a. in<br />
customer premises equipment and value added services,<br />
reducing shipping manning levels to international levels and<br />
reducing excess waterfront manning are all playing a<br />
valuable role.<br />
only an c ony which faces competition both domestically<br />
and internationally can have an export culture.<br />
That is why our primary industry and services sectors have<br />
much a culture.* That is why our manufacturing industries<br />
are developing one.<br />
my Government's reform agenda is a continuing one. We still<br />
have far to go.* But the climate has changed. Everyone now<br />
wants an internationally competitive economy and in willing<br />
to make the necessary changes so VS can't relax our<br />
efforts. in our international diplomacy,. we've been pursuing the saee<br />
goals. We have been determined in our efforts to achieve a<br />
liberalisation of world trading rules in particular,<br />
through out efforts in the Cairns Group to achieve a<br />
successful outcome to the current Uruguay round of world<br />
trade talks.<br />
And we took the initiative to convene in Canberra the<br />
maeting last week of senior ministers of twelve Asia Pacific<br />
economies the APEC Conference seeking to build closer<br />
regional cooperation. I was delighted at the successful<br />
outcome of the conference not least at its decision to<br />
convene a meeting of Trade Ministers to exert further<br />
pressure for a successful outcome to the Uruguay process.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen,<br />
The Australian Export Awards pay tribute to those firms with<br />
the vision to persevere with the export challenge. The<br />
awards serve not only as en accolade to the endeavour. of<br />
this yearts finalists and winners but also provides<br />
practical. insight into how Australian exporters can succeed<br />
overseas. The finalists in these awards all of you here today play<br />
a vital role in Australia's move towards developing a mature<br />
export culture.<br />
I congratulate you all and thank you for providinq models of<br />
export success from which other Australian business can and<br />
must learn. </p>
