    <content><![CDATA[<p>I congratulate the Hon Mike Baird MP on receiving the endorsement of his colleagues to become NSW Premier.</p>
<p>There is no greater honour than to serve the people you are elected to represent at the very highest level, and Mike will be a fine leader for NSW.</p>
<p>I have known Mike for many years and I know he will discharge his responsibilities with integrity and honour.</p>
<p>Mike has served in the NSW Parliament since 2007 and as NSW Treasurer since 2011.</p>
<p>During his time as Treasurer, Mike has kept a firm hand on the NSW finances.</p>
<p>So, too, I congratulate the Hon Gladys Berejiklian MP on becoming the Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party in NSW.</p>
<p>Gladys has been a champion of better transport for Sydney residents in both Government and Opposition.</p>
<p>To be endorsed by your party colleagues is a privilege and a great responsibility.<br />
 </p>
<p>I would like to pay tribute to outgoing NSW Premier Barry O’Farrell.<br />
 </p>
<p>Barry returned order and good government to NSW after many turbulent years.<br />
 </p>
<p>He has served the constituents of NSW well; restoring integrity to the Budget, reducing the debt burden and investing in the infrastructure and services needed to get the state moving.<br />
 </p>
<p>Barry has acted with great honour.<br />
 </p>
<p>I wish Barry, his wife Rosemary and their family all the very best for what lies ahead.<br />
 </p>
<p>17 April 2014</p>
