FOR P2--". SS 269<br />
VISIT TO' 1 WVX, HILL L ASS<br />
( Sta tement by the Hon. 7' Wentworth, P.<br />
iF inister I'L charge of Aborigi nal Affairs)<br />
Latst 1' 1ondlay I visited Wa-ctie Creek, which is poirt of Wave Hill<br />
Lease in the Northern Territory. While I w-s the re I hnd _-n<br />
opportunity of imeeting repras~ jntntives of the Gurindji people,, some<br />
of them are camcped in the grea. Previous to mygoing th-re I hoad<br />
studied the reports of the Sessional Coilmittee of' the 1h. orthe: rn<br />
Ter-ritory Legislotive Council upon the situation.<br />
The Gurindji told me of their d6sire to hcld ' and devt. lo-p a sma-xll<br />
araof some eight s.-uire iles as their ai-home a-real nnd of their<br />
plans for iniprovingc, it. 7" ith -them I inspected the rrer) which they<br />
woante d. -lso told me thnt if -they ha d this hea-dqurte-rs, which<br />
would be availcble for the women nd child.-r(-n nndj *. hair e1lerly folk<br />
while they wzere awlay at worlh, they would be ? ble to org -nise contract<br />
foncing nC rauste.-rin--rand. t. o sup". o--t themselves. They saoid they<br />
plarn-ed' to develop their own fruit and veget'ble gardenif and that the<br />
site ii! s suitrble fo-2 this.<br />
In consaquence Iam now, as a tiatter of urgency, e:-xamining with<br />
jll the interested pa rties the im., plicitions and the methods of<br />
r*-sur., ing this aro,-fromi the . aive Hill Letis.-, and making it availrible<br />
for thc purp-) se f'or which it n-s been -eque. st._ d. This would, of<br />
course, require the pcyraent of equitable com-ipnsation to the present<br />
les sees. Should -this arabecome -vnila. ble, it i:., ould ba necessary to<br />
provide aissistalnce on aself-holp Osis vi~ th f_ ncing *~ dbuildfing<br />
mate riaql, so th.-t the &amp; uidican develop their home arcoein thc w~ ay<br />
which they hav-: said they would do.<br />
Ul those suggestions ar, inL. line w-, ith those ma7de by the<br />
