QUEENSLAND BROADCAST NO.<br />
THE ENVIRONMENT MAY 1975<br />
ON FRIDAY I ANNOUNCED A MOST IMPORTANT<br />
DECISION BY THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT FOR THE PROTECTION<br />
OF THE GREAT BARRIER REEF. THE GOVERNMENT HAD BEFORE IT<br />
THE REPORT OF ROYAL COMMISSIONS WHICH WERE APPOINTED,<br />
YOU'LL REMEMBER, IN 1970 TO CONSIDER THE PROBLEM<br />
OF OIL DRILLING ON THE REEF. THAT REPORT MADE IT CLEAR<br />
THAT WE ARE STILL VERY MUCH IN THE DARK SCIENTIFICALLY<br />
SPEAKING ABOUT THE LONG-TERM EFFECTS OF OIL ON<br />
THE REEF AND ITS ORGANISMS. I DON'T WANT TO OVERSIMPLIFY<br />
WHAT ARE REALLY COMPLEX MATTERS,, BUT IT'S FAIR TO SAY<br />
THAT THERE IS. STILL ROOM FOR DOUBT ABOUT THE DEGREE OF<br />
RISK WHICH OIL DRILLING WOULD POSE. Two OF THE THREE<br />
ROYAL COMMISSIONERS FELT THAT WITH CERTAIN SAFEGUARDS<br />
AND PRECAUTIONS, DRILLING COULD BE SAFELY PERMITTED IN<br />
CERTAIN AREAS AROUND THE REEF, THE CHAIRMAN OF THE INQUIRY,<br />
MR JUSTICE WALLACE, FELT THAT THIS WOULD BE TOO GREAT<br />
A RISK TO TAKE, HIs OPINION WAS THAT NO DRILLING AT ALL<br />
SHOULD BE ALLOWED NEAR THE REEF UNTIL WE DISCOVER MORE<br />
ABOUT ITS LONG-TERM SCIENTIFIC EFFECTS. THE GOVERNMENT<br />
CONSIDERED ALL THESE VIEWS, WE DECIDED ON FRIDAY THAT<br />
WITH A NATURAL ASSET AS PRICELESS AS THE REEF, WE WOULD<br />
NOT BE JUSTIFIED IN TAKING ANY CHANCES. WE ACCEPTED<br />
THE MORE STRINGENT VIEW. OF THE COMMISSION'S CHAIRMAN. WE<br />
HAVE THEREFORE DECIDED THAT THERE SHOULD BE NO DRILLING IN<br />
THE AREA OF THE REEF UNTIL MORE SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE IS<br />
1-41A </p>
<p>-2-<br />
FOR US, THE PRESERVATION OF THE REEF IS PARAMOUNT<br />
I HAVE ALREADY WRITTEN TO MR BJELKE-PETERSEN EXPLAINING<br />
OUR DECISION IT WAS CERTAINLY TIME FOR SUCH'DECISIVE<br />
ACTION. I DON'T NEED TO REMIND YOU OF THE LONG HISTORY<br />
OF WRANGLING BY OTHER GOVERNMENTS WHICH LED UP TO OUR<br />
DECISION. IT STARTED FIVE YEARS AGO, WHEN MR GORTON<br />
WAS PRIME MINISTERS HE TOO WAS CONCERNED ABOUT OIL<br />
DRILLING ON-THE REEF DRILLING PERMITTED AND<br />
ENCOURAGED BY THE QUEENSLAND GOVERNMENT. IT WAS MR<br />
GORTON'S AGITATION AND I GIVE HIM CREDIT FOR IT<br />
WHICH LED TO THE APPOINTMENT OF THE ROYAL COMMISSIONS<br />
BY THE QUEENSLAND AND AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENTS, BUT MR<br />
GORTON WASN'T JUST CONCERNED ABOUT THE REEF. HE TOOK THE<br />
WIDER-VIEW SUPPORTED BY MY PARTY THAT ALL OFF-SHORE<br />
AREAS, THE WHOLE CONTINENTAL SHELF AROUND AUSTRALIA, WAS<br />
THE PROPER RESPONSIBILITY OF THE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT,<br />
NOT THE STATES. e/ 3 </p>
<p>-3-<br />
THE REASONS FOR THIS ARE SIMPLE ENOUGH:<br />
THE OFF-SHORE AREAS LIE OUTSIDE OUR LAND BORDERS; THEIR<br />
DEFINITION INVOLVES QUESTIONS OF FOREIGN RELATIONS;<br />
AND MOST OFF-SHORE ACTIVITIES, SUCH AS MINING AND MINERAL<br />
EXPLORATION, AFFECT NOT ONLY THE ENVIRONMENT BUT OUR<br />
TRADE AS A NATIONS So THE GORTON GOVERNMENT IN<br />
APRIL 1970 BROUGHT IN LEGISLATION TO BRING THESE AREAS<br />
UNDER THE CONTROL OF THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT, WELL,<br />
THERE WAS A GREAT HOWL FROM THE MINING INTERESTS AND<br />
STATE-RiGHTERS, AND MR GORTON'S SENSIBLE MEASURE WAS PUT<br />
IN COLD STORAGE. THE LIBERALS IN CANBERRA. WENT TO WATER.<br />
WHEN WE CAME IN WE REINTRODUCED THE LEGISLATION; THE<br />
QUEENSLAND GOVERNMENT PROMPTLY CHALLENGED IT IN THE HIGH<br />
COURT, WE ARE STILL WAITING FOR THE COURT'S JUDGMENT. THAT'S<br />
FAIR ENOUGH; BUT MR BJELKE-PETERSEN HAS BEEN USING HIS<br />
COURT CHALLENGE TO TRY AND HOLD UP ANOTHER POSITIVE<br />
MEASURE TO PROTECT THE BARRIER REEF. WE WON'T GO ALONG<br />
WITH THOSE TACTICS. THIS WEEK, IN THE FEDERAL PARLIAMENT, WE<br />
INTRODUCED A BILL TO CREATE A GREAT BARRIER REEF MARINE<br />
PARK. IT'S A MAGNIFICENT SCHEME; IT WILL ENSURE THAT THIS<br />
SUPERB AREA,* THIS UNIQUE PART OF AUSTRALIA'S NATURAL<br />
HERITAGE, WILL BE SAFEGUARDED FOR ALL TIME. WE TOLD THE<br />
QUEENSLAND GOVERNMENT THAT WE WOULDN'T ALLOW THEIR COURT<br />
CHALLENGE TO DELAY THE BILL, WE SAID WE WOULD PREFER TO<br />
COOPERATE IN A JOINT AUTHORITY TO ADMINISTER THE MARINE<br />
PARK WITH QUEENSLAND, BUT IF THE QUEENSLAND GOVERNMENT<br />
WOULDN'T COOPERATE WE WOULD GO AHEAD ON OUR OWN, ONCE<br />
AGAIN, THE FUTURE OF THE REEF WAS PARAMOUNT TO US. </p>
<p>THOSE ARE JUST TWO OF THE INITIATIVES<br />
WE HAVE TAKEN TO SAFEGUARD THE ENVIRONMENTS THEY ARE<br />
AREAS IN WHICH WE HAVE CLEAR CONSTITUTIONAL POWERS, OR<br />
ARE CONVINCED OF OUR POWERS. WHERE WE HAVE THE POWER WE<br />
HAVE ACTED PROMPTLY1 WE HAVE POWER IN THE TERRITORIESAND<br />
IT'IS IN THE NORTHERN TERRITORY THAT MOST OF OUR<br />
URANIUM IS MINED. HERE WE HAVE IMPOSED STRICT<br />
ENVIRONMENTAL CONTROLS ON URANIUM MINING BEFORE IT<br />
STARTS1 AND HAVE APPROVED FULL LAND RIGHTS FOR THE<br />
ABORIGINAL PEOPLE. WE ALSO HAVE POWER OVER-THE<br />
EXPORT OF-MINERALS, WHEREVER THEY ARE MINED. THE PREVIOUS<br />
GOVERNMENT REALLY ONLY CONCERNED ITSELF WITH THE<br />
EXPORT OF. URANIUM AND IRON ORE. ONE OF OUR FIRST ACTS<br />
AS A GOVERNMENT WAS TO ASSUME-FULL CONTROL OVER THE<br />
EXPORT OF AU.. MINERALS. WE DID THIS FOR A NUMBER OF<br />
REASONS NOT JUST ENVIRONMENTAL ONES -AND ONE RESULTO<br />
THANKS LARGELY TO THE WORK OF REX CONNOR AND HIS<br />
DEPARTMENT, HAS BEEN TO QUADRUPLE THE EARNINGS FROM THE<br />
EXPORT OF QUEENSLAND COALS </p>
<p>WHEN IT COMES TO ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION<br />
WITHIN~ THE STATES, WE HAVE SOUGHT RESULTS BY AGREEMENT<br />
WITH THE STATES OR BY BRINGING IN LEGISLATION WHICH THE<br />
STATES AGREE TO SUPPORT. THAT'S NO EASY TASK. AWAY<br />
BACK IN APRIL 1973 MORE THAN TWO YEARS'AGOIFIRST<br />
WROTE TO THE PREMIERS SEEKING THEIR COOPERATION<br />
IN PROTECTING THE ENVIRONMENT WHENEVER THEY REQUESTED<br />
FEDERAL FUNDS FOR STATE GOVERNMENT PROJECTS. IN<br />
JANUARY LAST YEAR 16 MONTH -S AGO WWR OTE AGAIN TO THE<br />
PREMIERS$ I SUGGESTED A PREMIERS' CONFERENCE, WE<br />
WANTED SOME PROCEDURE FOR JOINT ENVIRONMENTAL INQUIRIES<br />
BY THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT AND THE STATES. IT'S<br />
SURELY ABSURD TO HAVE TWO INQUIRIES INTO THE ENVIRONMENTAL<br />
IMPACT OF A* PROJECT WHEN ONE WILL DO, THE RESPONSE FROM<br />
THE STATES WAS FRANKLY DISAPPOINTING1 BUT THAT DIDN'T<br />
STOP ME FROM ACTING ON AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT PROJECTS<br />
WHICH FALL WITHIN OUR OWN RESPONSIBILITY. ENVIRONMENTAL<br />
IMPACT INQUIRIES HAVE BEEN STANDARD PRACTICE FOR THE<br />
AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT SINCE THE BEGINNING OF LAST YEAR. S,<br />
LEGISLATION. TO MAKE THESE PROCEDURES COMPULSORY WAS<br />
PASSED IN DECEMBER, FROM NOW ON, EVERY PROJECT AFFECTING<br />
THE ENVIRONMENT WHETHER MINING1 BUILDING, OR<br />
DEVELOPMENT WILL BE SUBJECT TO THE MOST SEARCHING<br />
SCRUTINYS </p>
<p>-6-<br />
IT'S ONLY WHEN WE GET THESE MATTERS INTO<br />
PROPER PERSPECTIVE THAT WE CAN UNDERSTAND WHAT<br />
HAPPENED WITH FRASER ISLAND. LET ME BE QUITE CLEAR<br />
ABOUT THIS: NOTHING WE DO CAN STOP THE MINING ON<br />
FRASER ISLAND. THE MOST WE CAN HOPE TO DO IS PREVENT<br />
THE EXPORT OF MINERALS THAT ARE ALREADY MINED, THE<br />
QUESTION WAS WHETHER WE COULD DO THAT LEGALLYOR<br />
HONOURABLY. DON'T IMAGINE THAT THIS PROBLEM<br />
SUDDENLY TOOK THE GOVERNMENT BY SURPRISE A COUPLE<br />
OF WEEKS AGOi ALMOST A YEAR AGO, MY MINISTERS,<br />
wMR CONNOR AND DR CASS AGREED -AND I ACCEPTED THEIR<br />
ADVICE -THAT WHEREVER POSSIBLE THE GOVERNMENT<br />
SHOULD.-USE ITS POWERS OVER MINERAL EXPORTS TO<br />
DISCOURAGE MINING OPERATIONS WHICH COULD DAMA GE THE<br />
ENVIRONMENT. ONCE AGAIN IT WAS ON 9 JULY LAST<br />
YEAR -IWROTE TO THE PREMIERS POI NTIN G OUT OUR<br />
CONCERN, AND STRESSING THAT ENVIRONMENTAL SAFEGUARDS<br />
WOULD BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT WHEN FUTURE APPLICATIONS<br />
FOR MINERAL EXPORTS WERE CONSIDERED BY THE GOVERNMENT.<br />
MR BJELKE-PETERSEN TOOK SIX MONTHS TO REPLYo AND THERE<br />
IS STILL NO AGREED PROCEDURE ON THE NECESSARY.<br />
ENVIRONMENTAL INQUIRIES. a17 </p>
<p>-7-<br />
I ASK YOU TO REMEMBER THAT MINING HAS BEEN<br />
GOING ON ON FRASER ISLAND FOR YEARS, THE PRESENT<br />
MINING LEASES WEREN T APPROVED BY US THEY WERE<br />
APPROVED YEARS AGO BY MR BJELKE-PETERSEN HIMSELF.<br />
THAT'S ONE REASON WHY THERE HASN T BEEN A WORD OF<br />
CRITICISM BY THE LIBERALS OR THE COUNTRY PARTY OF THE<br />
MINING ON FRASER ISLAND. WHEN WE CAME TO OFFICE THE<br />
MINING COMPANIES ALREADY HAD THEIR LEASES; THEY HAD<br />
ENTERED INTO FIRM CONTRACTS, AND THEY HAD THE RESULTS<br />
OF AN ENVIRONMENTAL INQUIRY BY THE QUEENSLAND<br />
GOVERNMENT WHICH GAVE ITS BLESSING TO THE SCHEME, SUBJECT<br />
TO PRETTY STRINGENTSAFEGUARDS. THE WHOLEOPERATION WAS<br />
PERFECTLY LEGAL. SOME SAY WE COULD STOP THE EXPORT<br />
OF MINERALS NOW BY MAKING ' OUR LEGISLATION<br />
RETROSPECTIVE, BY SAYING " THIS RULE WON'T JUST APPLY<br />
IN FUTURE, WE RE GOING TO APPLY IT TO PAST CASES AS WELL$<br />
-WE'RE GOING TO KNOCK OUT MILLIONS OF DOLLARS WORTH<br />
OF MINERAL CONTRACTS ALREADY MADE IN GOOD FAITH."<br />
WE WEREN'T PREPARED TO DO IT$ WHAT WE ARE DOING IS<br />
MAKING. SURE THAT FROM NOW ON, ALL FUTURE MINING OPERATIONS<br />
WILL BE CAREFULLY STUDIED FOR THEIR EFFECT. ON THE<br />
ENVIRONMENT. DR CASS HAS ANNOUNCED A FULL ENVIRONMENTAL<br />
INQUIRY INTO THE WHOLE FUTURE OF FRASER ISLAND TO HOLD<br />
THE LINE AGAINST ANY FUTURE DAMAGE. </p>
<p>-8-<br />
WE HAVE ACHIEVED GREAT THINGS ON THE<br />
ENVIRONMENT AND YOU CAN BE SURE WE WILL PRESS ON<br />
WITH OUR PROGRAM AS VIGOROUSLY AS EVER. THAT<br />
PROGRAM WILL MOVE AHEAD MORE QUICKLY WITH A<br />
LITTLE LESS HYPOCRISY FROM THOSE WHO DID NOTHING,<br />
DURING 23 YEARS IN GOVERNMENT, TO PROTECT OUR<br />
NATURAL HERITAGE.<br />
