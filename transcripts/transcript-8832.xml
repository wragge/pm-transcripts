STATEMENT 13Y THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P. 3. KEATING, MP<br />
KE. ATING ACCEPTS HEWBON' S CHALLENGE<br />
I note with some amuseiment Dr Hewson's latest " formal<br />
challenge" to me to put aside " antics" for the remainder<br />
of the campaign.<br />
Dr Hewson's challenge, issued beneath a photograph of the<br />
Opposition Leader taking a dip at Cottesloe Beach after a<br />
4-kilometre " picture opportunity," is welcome.<br />
I will continue to direct my efforts in the campaign<br />
towards jobs and the impact of a GST.<br />
I take it from his latest challenge that Dr Hewson<br />
intends to desist from the following:<br />
Wearing funny hats.<br />
Jogging picfacs.<br />
Impersonating the President of the Uftiited States.<br />
Taking dips at Cottesloe, or any other beach.<br />
Pretending to be a lifesaver.<br />
Presenting himself to the nation's media hot, wet<br />
and half-dressed.<br />
Arranging Liberal stooges to impersonate the<br />
unemployed. Signing pledges to give up a year's salary.<br />
Walking on the beech ( with or without socks).<br />
Telling school kids in Brisbane there will be no tax<br />
on their tuckshop, lunches when his policy says there<br />
will be.<br />
Being force-fed at a McDonald's Restaurant.<br />
And the most outrageous antic of all:<br />
Pretending the Goods and Services Tax will create 2<br />
672[ million jobs.<br />
CANBERRA. 27 February 1993 </p>
