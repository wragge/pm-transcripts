<p>PRESENTER:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, thanks for being with us. Iraq is a long way from Australia.</p>
<p>   Why did you feel the need to send Australian troops, even in a support</p>
<p>   role?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Because the world wide implications of Saddam Hussein being allowed</p>
<p>   to get away with what he's doing, allowed to retain and have</p>
<p>   the capacity to use weapons of mass destruction against neighbours</p>
<p>   is not something that is isolated to the Middle East. If he is able</p>
<p>   to do that then others might think they can do it and those others</p>
<p>   can be anywhere else in the world. There is a world security issue</p>
<p>   involved in this and that is why Australia has indicated a willingness</p>
<p>   if diplomatic solutions and approaches fail to join the United States</p>
<p>   led effort.</p>
<p>PRESENTER:</p>
<p>You spoke with President Clinton on the weekend I believe. What</p>
<p>   did he ask of you specifically and was there any resistance to Australian</p>
<p>   involvement from within your own Government?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>President Clinton rang me on Saturday afternoon, Australian time,</p>
<p>   and he asked if Australia would make a contribution. He didn't</p>
<p>   specify what it should be, that was a matter for us and we are now</p>
<p>   discussing with the United States the possibility of a unit of our</p>
<p>   Special Services and some assistance with refuelling and in some</p>
<p>   other specialist areas. Now, that may or may not turn out to be</p>
<p>   the contribution we make. If something else of a light magnitude</p>
<p>   is more adaptable, well that could be the case. There has been very</p>
<p>   strong support within Australia. I have received in principle support</p>
<p>   from the Labor Party Opposition in Australia. Of course it was a</p>
<p>   Government of that complexion that was in power in Australia in</p>
<p>   1991 when Australia participated in Desert Storm, and on that occasion</p>
<p>   the Party that I now lead was in Opposition, also lent its support.</p>
<p>So there is a recognition across the political spectrum in Australia</p>
<p>   about the longer term implications of this particular issue.</p>
<p>PRESENTER:</p>
<p>If you are sending in the Special Air Services, Australia's</p>
<p>   most elite fighting and reconnaissance force, then presumably one</p>
<p>   accepts that a combat role is approved for those men if it becomes</p>
<p>   necessary. Are Australians ready for casualties over this?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I don't think anybody likes the prospect of any casualties.</p>
<p>   It has to always be recognised that they are possible in any theatre</p>
<p>   of war. The purpose of the deployment of this unit is essentially</p>
<p>   in the area of search and rescue. The detail of that and what is</p>
<p>   involved in that is not something that I can at this stage canvass</p>
<p>   for reasons I am sure you will understand.</p>
<p>PRESENTER:</p>
<p>Now there is a feeling in many parts of the world that the dispute</p>
<p>   over weapons inspections is very much a dispute between the United</p>
<p>   Nations and Iraq but that the United States is acting all but unilaterally</p>
<p>   when it comes to the notion of military strike. Shouldn't military</p>
<p>   action be a United Nations decision?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>At the end of the day, it is the member states of the United Nations</p>
<p>   that end up taking the action and if you look at the Security Council</p>
<p>   resolution that was passed way back in 1991, I think 678, it has,</p>
<p>   as they say in the parlance a very long tail, and that authorises</p>
<p>   in our advice the sort of action that might be necessary. Can I</p>
<p>   say again that I hope devoutly that the military action is not necessary</p>
<p>   and I do hope that Saddam Hussein and the Iraqi leadership is willing,</p>
<p>   even at this eleventh hour to cooperate with the United Nations.</p>
<p>   We have no desire to see Iraq bombed. We have no desire to see any</p>
<p>   suffering by the Iraqi people but we simply cannot, as a civilised</p>
<p>   world, allow these sorts of weapons to be available for use in an</p>
<p>   indiscriminate, punitive fashion.</p>
<p>PRESENTER:</p>
<p>Very briefly, Mr Howard, you have Muslim nations as neighbours.</p>
<p>   Muslim communities within Australia asked you not to get involved.</p>
<p>   Do you fear any kind of backlash if military action does take place,</p>
<p>   either in a trade sense or with the Olympics just around the corner?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No I don't expect so on either count. I have made it plain</p>
<p>   to the Arabic populations of Australia that they are part of the</p>
<p>   Australian community and they will be treated properly and respected</p>
<p>   as part of the Australian community. I mean, they are Australians</p>
<p>   first. We are all Australians together on something like this and</p>
<p>   I think the commonsense of what we're doing and the necessity</p>
<p>   of what we are committing ourselves to will be quite widely understood</p>
<p>   by the Australian community.</p>
<p>PRESENTER:</p>
<p>John Howard, the Australian Prime Minister in Canberra, thank you</p>
<p>   very much for your time today on a busy day in Canberra.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p> [ENDS]</p>
