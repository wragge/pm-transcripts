    <content><![CDATA[<p>E&amp;OE..............................................................................................</p>
<p>Thank you very much Wil. To Michael Osborne, the</p>
<p>   President of the New South Wales Division of the Liberal Party,</p>
<p>   to my Federal Ministerial colleagues of which there are a number</p>
<p>   here tonight; Richard Alston, John Moore, Judi Moylan, Bronwyn Bishop,</p>
<p>   John Herron - I don't think I have missed any of the Ministers.</p>
<p>   If I have, put your hand up. To my Federal Parliamentary colleagues</p>
<p>   other than Ministers, to Peter Collins and other state parliamentarians,</p>
<p>   Ian Armstrong, the Leader of the National Party in New South Wales,</p>
<p>   ladies and gentlemen.</p>
<p>Can I start by thanking all of you for being here</p>
<p>   tonight and to thank so many of you for the tremendous support that</p>
<p>   you have given to the Liberal Party in Sydney and New South Wales</p>
<p>   and therefore throughout Australia over the last couple of years.</p>
<p>   It is a tremendous sense of satisfaction that I have in marking</p>
<p>   the second anniversary here in Sydney of the election of the first</p>
<p>   Coalition Government in Australia for 13 years and I take the opportunity</p>
<p>   through this gathering tonight to thank all the members and supporters</p>
<p>   of the Liberal Party for the tremendous help that they have given</p>
<p>   to me and the tremendous understanding they have displayed and the</p>
<p>   loyalty they have demonstrated over the last couple of years.</p>
<p>I came into the Prime Ministership and my Government</p>
<p>   came into office with a number of quite basic guiding principles.</p>
<p>   I have always had a strong personal philosophy about the quality</p>
<p>   of government in this country that essentially says that the art</p>
<p>   of good statecraft as we come towards the end of this century and</p>
<p>   we approach the third Christian millennium, the art of good statecraft</p>
<p>   is really to strike a balance between preserving those values of</p>
<p>   our past and those values of our culture and our history that continue</p>
<p>   to serve us well and continue to remain relevant for our future,</p>
<p>   and to be willing to defend those values and those cultures with</p>
<p>   great tenacity. But by the same token, to be ready to challenge</p>
<p>   and to change, fundamentally if necessary, those practices and those</p>
<p>   attitudes that really have no place in the future Australia that</p>
<p>   we want to build into the 21st Century.</p>
<p>And I also believe that what you have to do is</p>
<p>   to strike a balance between those two. I have also brought to my</p>
<p>   view of the Prime Ministership of this country a fundamental belief</p>
<p>   that Australia occupies a quite unique intersection of history,</p>
<p>   geography, culture and economic circumstance. We are the only nation</p>
<p>   in the world that is geographically cast in Asia, has deep and enduring</p>
<p>   links with Britain and the rest of Europe and also profound historical</p>
<p>   and strategic ties with North America, particularly the United States.</p>
<p>   So far from that intersection being a liability or an encumbrance,</p>
<p>   it is of immense advantage to this country. </p>
<p>That has been demonstrated over the past few months</p>
<p>   as our neighbours in Asia have passed into great economic turmoil</p>
<p>   and Australia has been able to emerge from that as a nation fighting</p>
<p>   above, hitting above and punching above its own weight and a nation</p>
<p>   that is able to be a reliable friend and a good regional mate of</p>
<p>   those countries in their difficulties. In the years ahead, when</p>
<p>   those countries recover, as inevitably they will, they will remember</p>
<p>   that it was Australia occupying that unique intersection, with all</p>
<p>   of the influences that intersection can bring, that Australia was</p>
<p>   amongst the countries that was willing to help and to give them</p>
<p>   succour and comfort during their difficult times.</p>
<p>We do occupy that very special place in the world</p>
<p>   and it's a source of immense pride to me that my Government</p>
<p>   has been able to turn what was a, what I could only describe as</p>
<p>   an Asia-only focus of the former government into an Asia-first focus</p>
<p>   under my Government. Asia will forever be the most important area</p>
<p>   of our operations, both politically, economically and strategically.</p>
<p>   But as Wil said, we do have important and enduring economic, historical</p>
<p>   and cultural links with other parts of the world.</p>
<p>We came to office with many things that we wanted</p>
<p>   to do. We came to office believing that the social fundamentals</p>
<p>   of this country were srong, that we had a stable political system</p>
<p>   but there are aspects of our economic management that needed dramatic</p>
<p>   change, and as I look back over the last two years, I do so with</p>
<p>   some satisfaction but certainly no sense of complacency or smugness.</p>
<p>   We have turned a deficit of $10.5 billion into a prospective surplus</p>
<p>   in Peter Costello's third budget. We do have the lowest inflation</p>
<p>   rate in the OECD. We do have a very strong level of business investment.</p>
<p>   We have the lowest interest rate for 30 years and only this afternoon</p>
<p>   as a result of the competitive pressures that are now within the</p>
<p>   Australian financial system, some of them directly flowing from</p>
<p>   the implementation of the recommendations of the Wallis Committee,</p>
<p>   we have seen further reductions in business overdraft rates. And</p>
<p>   we have seen over the last week through the actions of the Westpac</p>
<p>   Bank, and this afternoon by the Commonwealth Bank, we have seen</p>
<p>   the first real interest rate breakthrough that the small business</p>
<p>   community of Australia has been hoping for and wanting for many</p>
<p>   long years. That represents extraordinarily good news for what remains</p>
<p>   the backbone of the Australian economy.</p>
<p>We have been able to reduce, even before the prospective</p>
<p>   privatisation of the remaining part of Telstra, we have been able</p>
<p>   to produce a situation that our debt to GDP ratio which was about</p>
<p>   20 per cent in 1995 is now prospectively only 10 per cent in the</p>
<p>   year 2000. By the one single decision to allow the men and women</p>
<p>   of Australia to buy the remaining two thirds of Telstra, we will</p>
<p>   be able, by that one single decision to eliminate almost 40 per</p>
<p>   cent of the total Federal Government debt of this country that existed</p>
<p>   when we came to office in March 1996.</p>
<p>So we have been able, in a quite fundamental way,</p>
<p>   to give to the Australian economy, the strongest economic foundations</p>
<p>   that it's had for 25 years. And I can, with some feeling, ask</p>
<p>   the rhetorical question, where do you imagine the Australian economy</p>
<p>   would have been? What do you imagine the impact of the Australian</p>
<p>   economy would have been from the turmoil in Asia if we had been</p>
<p>   running the loose fiscal policy that we inherited two years ago,</p>
<p>   if we were still struggling with a deficit of over $10 billion a</p>
<p>   year. It certainly would have left us weak, vulnerable and subject</p>
<p>   to very severe economic buffeting. Instead of that, we are seen</p>
<p>   as a stable, reliable, predictable country with which to do business</p>
<p>   and in which to invest.</p>
<p>But we've also, very importantly, undertaken</p>
<p>   some quite fundamental changes to Australia's industrial relations</p>
<p>   system and I guess of all the causes with which I have been strongly</p>
<p>   identified in my political time, on the economic front none has</p>
<p>   been more important than the need to reform Australia's outdated</p>
<p>   industrial relations system. Just as I believe that there are many</p>
<p>   things about Australia that have been part of our past, that we</p>
<p>   should fight with passion to defend as we go into the future, there</p>
<p>   are some things about our past that we should fight to get rid of</p>
<p>   because they are holding us back and one of those things is the</p>
<p>   industrial relations system which has its origins back in pre-World</p>
<p>   War One days, built on some rather unsound notions, coming out of</p>
<p>   the decision of the old Arbitration Commission in the now almost</p>
<p>   infamous Harvester Case. </p>
<p>And over the years, that award-driven system has</p>
<p>   weakened Australia economically and one of the things we resolved</p>
<p>   to do in 1996 was to change that forever. And at first some of the</p>
<p>   changes we made were seen with suspicion, even by some of our friends</p>
<p>   and supporters as perhaps not going far enough, as perhaps being</p>
<p>   weaker than the would have liked.</p>
<p>But those critics were wrong and those suspicions</p>
<p>   were misplaced because we have brought about fundamental change</p>
<p>   in the industrial relations area and we have been able to do it</p>
<p>   without industrial turmoil. We were told before the last election</p>
<p>   that if we tried to do what we had in mind there would be industrial</p>
<p>   strife. The reality has been completely the opposite. It may stagger</p>
<p>   some of you to know that in 1997 Australia recorded the lowest number</p>
<p>   of days lost to industrial disputes for 85 years. In other words,</p>
<p>   we had to go back to World War One days to find such an impeccable</p>
<p>   industrial record. </p>
<p>What we have done with those industrial relations</p>
<p>   changes is to build a framework and a basis for one of the most</p>
<p>   defining industrial challenges that this country has faced and that</p>
<p>   of course is fundamental reform of the industrial relations of Australia's</p>
<p>   waterfront. </p>
<p>We all know that Australia has an inefficient waterfront.</p>
<p>   We all know that the unproductive practices of the waterfront, and</p>
<p>   the activities of the Maritime Union of Australia and its predecessors,</p>
<p>   are almost legend in the industrial relations folklore of Australia.</p>
<p>   We all know that it's one of the things that stands between</p>
<p>   Australia and the full realisation of her potential as a modern,</p>
<p>   competitive, highly productive and highly successful nation. It's</p>
<p>   one of those things that continues to deny us the full realisation</p>
<p>   of the potential that the rest of the world has always seen in our</p>
<p>   country. And at long last we have that intersection of circumstances.</p>
<p>   We have a government which has had the courage to change the law</p>
<p>   of this country, to break the monopoly of the Maritime Union on</p>
<p>   the supply of labour. We have, in the National Farmers' Federation,</p>
<p>   we have a very courageous organisation of men and women who are</p>
<p>   seen as an integral part, not only of the history and the backbone</p>
<p>   of this country but also of its export capacity and it's export</p>
<p>   future. And we also see in the Patricks company and led by a person</p>
<p>   who I think has conducted himself with great courage and great commitment,</p>
<p>   Mr Chris Corrigan, we see a company, and we see in the National</p>
<p>   Farmers' Federation together, people who are prepared to use</p>
<p>   the tools provided by the changes to the law that my Government</p>
<p>   has made. </p>
<p>Now this is a defining moment. It is a defining</p>
<p>   dispute in the industrial relations history of Australia. We do</p>
<p>   not seek an argument with any union in this country. We have no</p>
<p>   enduring quarrels with any union. We do not wish to destroy unions,</p>
<p>   we do not wish to destroy unionists and we do not wish to destroy</p>
<p>   unionism. There is a place for both union and non-union labour on</p>
<p>   the waterfront of Australia just as there is a place for union and</p>
<p>   non -union labour on any factory floor and in any office in this</p>
<p>   country. </p>
<p>It is a question of personal choice. Over a period</p>
<p>   of time, union membership has declined and I guess that process</p>
<p>   will go on. But that is a matter of individual choice. But what</p>
<p>   we are determined to see changed because it is important for the</p>
<p>   generation of jobs and the earning of export income for this country,</p>
<p>   what we are determined to see changed are of course the practices</p>
<p>   on the waterfront that have damaged this country's interests</p>
<p>   over such a long period of time. </p>
<p>So it is an important dispute. It is a crucial</p>
<p>   issue. It is one of those defining moments in the industrial relations</p>
<p>   experience of any country and it will be important that those who</p>
<p>   want the goals that we have talked about for so long in this area</p>
<p>   to be achieved and realised over the months ahead. It will be important</p>
<p>   that you continue to give us and those involved in these events</p>
<p>   your wholehearted support because Australia's export income</p>
<p>   future is at stake. The potential jobs of thousands of Australians</p>
<p>   are involved and the economic reputation and the reliability of</p>
<p>   this country as seen by the rest of the world is very much involved.</p>
<p>The other area, my friends, of course which is</p>
<p>   extremely important to Australia's economic future is dealing</p>
<p>   with what I regard to be the great piece of unfinished economic</p>
<p>   reform business in Australia and that is the long-overdue reform</p>
<p>   of our taxation system. By any measure, we have a very old fashioned,</p>
<p>   increasingly unworkable, and in the eyes of many people, increasingly</p>
<p>   unfair taxation system. We have tried, and I speak collectively</p>
<p>   of us as a nation, we have tried to change it on a number of occasions</p>
<p>   over the years. I had a go when I was the Treasurer in the Fraser</p>
<p>   Government. Mr Keating had a go when he was the Treasurer in the</p>
<p>   Hawke Government. He had the rug pulled from under his feet by the</p>
<p>   ACTU and his Prime Minister. We courageously had a go under John</p>
<p>   Hewson's leadership in 1993 and through one of the most, I</p>
<p>   think, dishonest and destructive scare campaigns that I have ever</p>
<p>   seen run in Australian politics, that attempt was defeated in the</p>
<p>   1993 election.</p>
<p>We said in the 1996 election that we wouldn't</p>
<p>   introduce this kind of reform during our first term and we have</p>
<p>   remained true to our word. But I came to the conclusion in about</p>
<p>   August of last year that it wasn't real life for me to go to</p>
<p>   the next election and once again rule out taxation reform. You don't</p>
<p>   get more than one go at being Prime Minister of this country and</p>
<p>   none of us are either on this earth or in any of these positions</p>
<p>   of immense responsibility for indefinite periods of time. And that</p>
<p>   means that you've got to use the opportunities you have wisely.</p>
<p>   You've got to be, I guess, a faithful steward to the responsibilities</p>
<p>   that you have while you have them. And it seemed to me that when</p>
<p>   it came to the issue of taxation reform, I really had two alternatives.</p>
<p>   I could either sort of say look, it's all too hard, and fudge</p>
<p>   it and pretend that nothing needed to be done or alternatively,</p>
<p>   we would go to the next election full bloodedly committed to the</p>
<p>   fundamental reform of the taxation system. </p>
<p>And that we'd lay out in some detail the plans</p>
<p>   that we had in mind. Now there may be some of you and there may</p>
<p>   be some of our supporters elsewhere who question the wisdom of it.</p>
<p>   But I don't think I could have credibly got away with going</p>
<p>   to the next election campaign, saying we're going to put tax</p>
<p>   reform off for yet another three years. And I certainly wasn't</p>
<p>   going to stand in front of cameras at the next election campaign</p>
<p>   and say solemnly that of course we're not going to change the</p>
<p>   tax system, having all the time an intention if I won that election</p>
<p>   to do the exact opposite. I am not interested in that kind of duplicity.</p>
<p>So we have decided to reform the tax system. We</p>
<p>   have decided to go to the next election with a detailed proposal.</p>
<p>   I think there has been something of a mood change in the Australian</p>
<p>   community about the need for tax reform. I believe that increasing</p>
<p>   numbers of Australians believe our present system is outmoded, out</p>
<p>   of date and is in need of root and branch reform. There is a growing</p>
<p>   acceptance in the business community that reformed taxation in Australia</p>
<p>   will particularly boost our export capacity. There is a realisation</p>
<p>   that there is rorting of the present system at both ends and if</p>
<p>   it is to be made more fair, fundamental changes are needed. But</p>
<p>   whatever the arguments may be, we are committed and Peter Costello</p>
<p>   and I, in particular are working very hard at present to put together</p>
<p>   the details of a proposal which will be presented to the Australian</p>
<p>   people in enough time for them to analyse and understand it and</p>
<p>   digest it before the next election.</p>
<p>Now I don't underestimate for a moment the</p>
<p>   difficulty of the task. I know that we will fight, we will face</p>
<p>   a ferocious fear campaign from our Labor opponents, our Labor opponents</p>
<p>   who have offered no policy alternatives, who seem to have a growing</p>
<p>   capacity to muck rake and to make trivial personal attacks on individuals,</p>
<p>   who this week were busy making personal attacks on people, from</p>
<p>   myself down in the Government while my Government was busily getting</p>
<p>   on with the job of providing good government for the people of Australia.</p>
<p>We will face a very strong fear campaign. I have</p>
<p>   no doubt of that. But I also have a belief in the great maturity</p>
<p>   and the commonsense of the Australian people. I think as we come</p>
<p>   towards the end of this century, the expectations of the public</p>
<p>   are of their politicians and of their leaders, that they will endeavour</p>
<p>   to make an honest attempt and to have a go at fixing the fundamental</p>
<p>   problems, not only of the economy but of the nation generally. And</p>
<p>   I think we will earn respect and we will win support because we</p>
<p>   are prepared to tackle those fundamental problems. I think Australians</p>
<p>   want a different taxation system. I think they see the present one</p>
<p>   as failing and as being unfair and I think they will give us marks</p>
<p>   for tackling it. But I don't pretend it will be easy. We will</p>
<p>   need your support, we will need your understanding and we will need</p>
<p>   your advocacy in the weeks and months ahead.</p>
<p>Could I just say one or two other personal things</p>
<p>   about the Liberal Party and about what it has meant to me and what</p>
<p>   it continues to mean to me after my many years of membership and</p>
<p>   the enormous privilege I now have, not only of being its Federal</p>
<p>   Parliamentary Leader but also of being Prime Minister of Australia.</p>
<p>   I have never forgotten my organisational roots in the Liberal Party.</p>
<p>   I have never forgotten the long association that I have had with</p>
<p>   so many people in this room, the long association I have had with</p>
<p>   the Party organisation.</p>
<p>At the present time I am the fortunate beneficiary</p>
<p>   of, I suppose a collection of loyalties and a collection of committed</p>
<p>   people, the like of which has not been my experience before and</p>
<p>   the like of which comes for few people as an experience in their</p>
<p>   life and I am very conscious of that. And I am very grateful for</p>
<p>   all of the support that you have given to me. And I am very grateful</p>
<p>   that together, we have been able to achieve an enormous amount over</p>
<p>   the last two years. And I remember that night two years ago on the</p>
<p>   second of March when we had that wonderful win, and one of the greatest</p>
<p>   senses of satisfaction that I had on that occasion was the realisation</p>
<p>   that there were many people at the Wentworth Hotel that night who</p>
<p>   had literally spent years and years with us, trying to win, and</p>
<p>   time after time we kept losing. And we were told by our political</p>
<p>   opponents that we didn't have a decent Party organisation.</p>
<p>   We were told by our political opponents and by some of our critics</p>
<p>   in the media, of which there were many, that we of course were never</p>
<p>   going to win, that we weren't professionals and that we were</p>
<p>   political no-hopers. And it was a source of tremendous pride and</p>
<p>   satisfaction to me that together, we proved all of them wrong. </p>
<p>That is what an occasion like this reminds me of.</p>
<p>   This is what an occasion like this enthuses me to say to all of</p>
<p>   you, that we can win again and we can win well, provided we don't</p>
<p>   take the Australian people for granted, provided we continue to</p>
<p>   address those things that the Australian people want addressed.</p>
<p>   They want their governments to do things, to deal with problems,</p>
<p>   to tackle difficult issues, to have a go at reforming areas that</p>
<p>   need reforming. They don't want a Government that sits there</p>
<p>   and does nothing. They don't want a government that imagines</p>
<p>   it can sit on a large majority and automatically be re-elected on</p>
<p>   the assumption that they won't put back a government they threw</p>
<p>   out or a party they threw out so unceremoniously only three years</p>
<p>   earlier.</p>
<p>We do live in a more volatile political climate</p>
<p>   than ever before. The differences between the parties are narrower.</p>
<p>   We are less tribal, politically, than we used to be and the number</p>
<p>   of swinging voters is much greater than used to be the case and</p>
<p>   that puts an obligation all the time of good, innovative government</p>
<p>   on those who happen to be in power. It means that you can never</p>
<p>   rest on your laurels. You can never assume that having done a certain</p>
<p>   amount is enough. It means that you have to, having conquered one</p>
<p>   issue and dealt with one problem, that you have got to move very</p>
<p>   rapidly onto the next. And that is the philosophy and that is the</p>
<p>   approach that we have endeavoured to adopt and we will continue</p>
<p>   to adopt between now and the next election.</p>
<p>Can I thank all of you personally again for what</p>
<p>   you have done, for the support you have given us, and prospectively</p>
<p>   for the support I hope you continue to give us into the future.</p>
<p>   To you Michael, as President of the Patty in New South Wales and</p>
<p>   to our new State Director, Remo Nogarotto, I thank both of you for</p>
<p>   your commitment to the organisation. And there is one other person</p>
<p>   I would like to thank tonight and that is somebody who has helped</p>
<p>   and sustained me through all of my years in politics, and shared</p>
<p>   the ups and downs and the trials and tribulations as well as some</p>
<p>   of the more happy moments and that is my wife, Janette, who is with</p>
<p>   me tonight. If I can say to you, we celebrate our 27th wedding anniversary</p>
<p>   tomorrow and typically of course, not surprisingly, we are at a</p>
<p>   Liberal Party gathering and it has certainly been characteristic</p>
<p>   of our lives. Thanks a lot Janette, you have made it all possible.</p>
<p>Thanks a lot.</p>
