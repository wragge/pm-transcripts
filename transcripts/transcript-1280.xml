COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA<br />
SPEECH BY<br />
The Rt. Hon. HAROLD HOLT, M. P.,<br />
ON<br />
INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS<br />
[ From the " Parliamentary Debates," 31st March 1966]<br />
Mr. HAROLD HOLT ( Higgins-Prime<br />
Minister) Speaker, my colleague,<br />
the Minister for External Affairs<br />
( Mr. Hasluck), dealt comprehensively with<br />
the matters that the House has been debating.<br />
However, I believed that it would be<br />
convenient if I were to take the opportunity<br />
* provided by the motion that the<br />
House take note of his statement to deal<br />
with the three major matters that have<br />
relevance to the greater part of the debate<br />
that has taken place. Understandably, most<br />
speakers have concentrated a good deal of<br />
their attention on the issues that arise in<br />
South Vietnam and in South East Asia<br />
generally. I hope to discuss three particular<br />
matters in the limited time that I have<br />
available. First, in response -to remarks<br />
made by the honorable member for Fremantle<br />
( Mr. Beazley), who, in a thoughtful<br />
speech, urged that the Government state its<br />
aims in South Vietnam, I shall state those<br />
aimns. This -has been done on other occasions<br />
by -numbers of my colleagues, I<br />
believe, but I shall make a statement on<br />
the subject in response -to the honorable<br />
member's appeal. Secondly, I wish to establish<br />
beyond the doubt of any reasonable<br />
man that the Leader of the Opposition<br />
( Mr. Calwell) misled the House wilfully<br />
and seriously when he assured honorable<br />
members that at the 1965 Federal Conference<br />
of the Australian Labour Party there<br />
had been no change of substance in the<br />
Party's defence policy. Thirdly, as the<br />
Leader of the Opposition has referred to<br />
the demonstrations which occurred at my<br />
4409/ 66 public meeting on Monday night as being<br />
an expression of the pent up feelings of<br />
Australian youth and purporting to convey<br />
some atmosphere of spontaneity about that<br />
operation, I shall bring to the attention of<br />
the House a copy of the Newsletter from<br />
one of the principal organisations concerned,<br />
which will show how highly organised these<br />
demonstrations are at the present time.<br />
Turning to our war aims in South Vietnam,<br />
I shall list the objectives of our intervention<br />
there. Our first objective is to help<br />
the Government of the Republic of Vietnam,<br />
at its request and in the light of our own<br />
assessment of the nature of the conflict in<br />
Vietnam, to resist the armed aggression of<br />
Communist North Vietnam against the South<br />
-an aggression waged through the Communist<br />
agencies of the Vietcong and the<br />
National Liberation Front and by its own<br />
regular armed forces. It is aimed at taking<br />
over the South by a campaign of force,<br />
terror and subversion and thence reunifying<br />
the country under Communist administration.<br />
Our second objective is to free<br />
million people of South Vietnam from the<br />
threat of oppression and terror which would<br />
be their lot under the domination of the<br />
Communists 6f the N46rth, and help establish<br />
conditions under which they will be able<br />
to choose Anid develop fre6 from coercion<br />
of any kihd the forms of government and<br />
society which they themselves want. The<br />
third objective is to leave no one in doubt<br />
that ' we in Australia are prepared Iand<br />
fegolVed to hiofifr our treaty commitmeiits<br />
Anid our Alliances and to stand firm with </p>
<p>our allies in the face of aggression, whether<br />
direct or disguised as it is now in Vietnam<br />
under the label of a war of liberation<br />
or a people's war Fourthly, by denying<br />
victory to Hanoi and Peking in South Vietnam<br />
we will ensure that the spread of<br />
Communism in South East Asia is checked<br />
and we will give encouragement to those<br />
moderate elements in the various countries<br />
of the region whom we are already supporting<br />
in the work of modernisation and<br />
economic and social progress. Fifthly, we<br />
do not seek to overthrow the regime in<br />
North Vietnam or to destroy the livelihood<br />
of the North Vietnamese people. We simply<br />
want the North to stop its aggression. We<br />
seek no widening of the war. We seek a<br />
peaceful settlement of the conflict through<br />
negotiations. We think that a peaceful settlement<br />
can be negotiated on the basis of the<br />
Geneva Agreement.<br />
Our basic aims are not only clear and<br />
limited-they are sound. What, for example,<br />
would be the consequences of our abandoning<br />
these objectives and withdrawing, as<br />
honorable members opposite suggest, with<br />
our allies from the struggle and from the<br />
defence of the independence of South Vietnam?<br />
South Vietnam, a country of 15<br />
million people, would become a Communist<br />
state. This would not be ; because<br />
the people of South Vietnam want Communism.<br />
It would be because they were<br />
unable to resist the armed power of the<br />
Vietcong supported by North Vietnam.<br />
The lives of millions of people who have<br />
resisted Communism, the security of their<br />
families and their properties would be in<br />
jeopardy and opposition in South Vietnam<br />
would be wiped out. There would be a<br />
repetition of the liquidation of -the so<br />
called class enemies, which occurred when<br />
the Communists took over the North. The<br />
political and psychological -impact of our<br />
withdrawal would be felt, not only in the<br />
countries bordering Vietnam, but throughout<br />
the whole of South East Asia. The path<br />
of the aggressors would be smoother as the<br />
countries of the area lost their faith and<br />
confidence in the forces of the United States<br />
and of the free world to protect their independence<br />
and sovereignty. The American<br />
guarantee would come under challenge in<br />
other parts of Asia -and Communist China's<br />
long term aim of d-riving the United States<br />
out of Asia and the Pacific would have had<br />
a significant success. In those countries which have entered into a security partnership<br />
with the United States-Korea, Japan,<br />
Taiwan and the Philippines-the opponents<br />
of the American connection would gain<br />
new strength. Conversely, successful resistance<br />
in Vietnam will contribute to<br />
security and to peaceful co-existence in the<br />
region as a whole.<br />
Australia has a vital interest in the effective<br />
presence and active participation of<br />
the United States as a great power in the<br />
area of Asia and the Pacific. We have an<br />
obligation to support the United States in<br />
this role-an obligation arising from our<br />
treaty relationships, from our role as an<br />
ally in supporting the United States in<br />
international diplomacy and politics, and<br />
from the fact that our international interests<br />
are directly involved in preserving South<br />
East Asia from aggression and from Communist<br />
domination. Can anyone doubt that<br />
the South East Asia region under Comnmunism<br />
or Chinese domination would be<br />
a socially, morally and economically impoverished<br />
and degraded region?<br />
I hope -that that statement is a clear<br />
enough indication of where this Government<br />
stands. If the people of Australia support<br />
that kind of statement of objective,<br />
then they cannot hope to secure the support<br />
that they would seek from honorable<br />
members on the other side of the -House.<br />
I have made a study of -the resolutions and<br />
the policy discussions which, as the Leader<br />
of the Opposition said, were conducted in<br />
the full -light of publicity and which were<br />
reported, not only in the daily Press, but<br />
also in the Press of the Labour Party itself.<br />
They have subsequently been the occasion<br />
for discussion by members of the Party<br />
opposite. Honorable members will recall<br />
-that the Leader of the Opposition told us<br />
that there had been no change of substance.<br />
I shall give the precise language because I<br />
think it is important that I should. I have<br />
pointed out-<br />
Dr. J. F. Cairns.-Why does not the<br />
Prime Minister quote from a Labour Party<br />
document? Mr. HAROLD HOLT.-I have the documents<br />
-here if the honorable member wishes<br />
me to do that. I had them here yesterday<br />
when we were discussing this matter.<br />
Dr. J. F. Cairns.-If the Prime Minister<br />
is going to discuss the matter now, we would<br />
expect him to bring them in. </p>
<p>Mr. HAROLD HOLT.-I had it in<br />
" Hansard" and I . thought -that was<br />
authoritative enough. I quoted the precise<br />
words from the Federal Platform of the<br />
Labour Party, as reported at page 669 of<br />
Hansard of 29th March-<br />
Labour will honour and support Australia's<br />
treaties and defence alliances.<br />
Those words have been dropped from the<br />
defence section of the Labour Party's document.<br />
The Leader of the Opposition said<br />
that they had reappeared, at least in substance,<br />
in the same sense, in the foreign<br />
affairs section of the document.<br />
Dr. J. F. Cairns.-That is correct.<br />
Mr. HAROLD HOLT.-I am glad to<br />
hear the honorable member say that because<br />
the document states-<br />
Australia must periodically review its defence<br />
treaties and alliances to meet new circumstances<br />
as they arise.<br />
Does the honorable member claim, with<br />
the trained mind which he brings to bear on<br />
these matters, that the words " honour and<br />
support" are the same thing as " review"<br />
from time to time? That is what the honorable<br />
member is saying. That was not the<br />
view taken by members of the Labour<br />
Party at the time. I wish to refer now to<br />
the issue of the Labour Party journal<br />
" Fact" for Friday, 20th August 1965. The<br />
editorial states--<br />
Important, too, is the new look at defence and<br />
foreign affairs whereby, for instance, Australia<br />
can face her nearby neighbours on a friendly basis<br />
rather than as a warring opponent as has been<br />
caused by the Menzies Government intervention<br />
: n Vietnam's private affairs.<br />
Mr. Uren.-That is all right.<br />
Mr. HAROLD HOLT.-Yes, that is all<br />
right. These things accumulate. Just give<br />
me a little time. Then in the August 1965<br />
issue of Labour the official journal, the<br />
following appeared-<br />
Despite a strong Press campaign and threats<br />
from the Deputy Leader, Mr. Whitlam, and the<br />
the recently concluded 26th Federal<br />
Conference of the Australian Labour Party was<br />
highly successful.<br />
The Conference refused to be stampeded on<br />
foreign affairs and by an overwhelming vote of<br />
votes to 6 reaffirmed its support for Mr.<br />
Calwell's nuclear-free zone proposals which were<br />
originally adopted by the Labour Party two<br />
years ago.<br />
A number of recommendations from the<br />
Labour Party Foreign Affairs Committee were not accepted by the Conference who were<br />
obviously determined not to be intimidated by the<br />
Press to drop some of its more forward-looking<br />
peace policies.<br />
The Conference expressed concern for military<br />
aspects of S. E. A. T. O. and suggested that new<br />
security arrangements in South East Asia should<br />
be considered by Australia, under the auspices<br />
of the U. N.<br />
The Conference decided by a large majority,<br />
after hearing a speech by Mr. Calwell ( Victoria)<br />
who moved an amendment, to retain the nuclearfree<br />
zone policy. The Foreign Affairs Committee<br />
had recommended its deletion. Only the six New<br />
South Wales delegates voted against this policy.<br />
By so doing, they ignored the 1963 New South<br />
Wales Labour Party Conference decision supporting<br />
the nuclear free zone.<br />
It is quite obvious that there has been a<br />
very significant switch in the strength of the<br />
Australian Labour Party under its Federal<br />
Executive in relation to these matters of<br />
defence and foreign affairs. There was a<br />
rejection at several critical points-if I had<br />
the time I would deal with them-of<br />
proposals brought forward by the then<br />
Foreign Affairs Committee.<br />
The representatives who were displaced<br />
from the Foreign Affairs Committee recently<br />
were, as I think most honorable gentlemen<br />
know, the honorable member for<br />
Eden-Monaro ( Mr. Allan Fraser), a foimer<br />
member for Darebin, Mr. R. W. Holt, who<br />
later became State President of the Party<br />
in Victoria, and Mr. Dunstan, the Attorney-<br />
General in the Labour Government of<br />
South Australia. The three men appointed<br />
to the Foreign Affairs Committee of the<br />
Australian Labour Party by the Federal<br />
Executive-and these are the men who<br />
would be carrying out the proposed review<br />
of Australia's treaties and alliances-are the<br />
honorable member for Yarra ( Dr. J. F.<br />
Cairns), the honorable member for Reid<br />
( Mr. Uren) and Senator Cavanagh-and<br />
they threw in Senator Cohen for good luck.<br />
I intend no reflection on the honorable<br />
gentlemen I have named because I believe<br />
they hold their views as sincerely and<br />
earnestly as anybody else in this Parliament,<br />
but it is a matter of either public celebrity<br />
or public notoriety, according to one's<br />
viewpoint, that these men are to be found<br />
on the extreme left of thought on defence<br />
and foreign affairs within the ranks of the<br />
Labour Party. The Labour Press treated<br />
as a rebuff to the Deputy Leader of the<br />
Opposition and the Australian Workers </p>
<p>Union the proposals carried at the 1965<br />
defence conference. It was regarded by the<br />
Labour Press as a significant switch in<br />
attitude on these matters, and quite certainly<br />
it effected a reduction in the support<br />
that our allies, in particular the United<br />
States of America, might have expected<br />
from a Labour government.<br />
The Leader of the Labour Party has<br />
shown significantly the difference in attitude<br />
that he brings to this matter. Anybody who<br />
studies the foreign affairs statement put out<br />
by the Australian Labour Party's information<br />
release No. 2/ 1965 of February last<br />
year on " The Situation in Vietnam will<br />
notice a statement which, as to a great deal<br />
of it anyway, is very much in line with the<br />
general approach of this Government and<br />
its supporters.<br />
Mr. Allan Fraser.-What arrant nonsense.<br />
Mr. HAROLD HOLT.-Well, just give<br />
me 10 minutes more and I will establish to<br />
the honorable member's satisfaction that the<br />
situation is as I have put it. But from that the<br />
Leader of the Opposition has turned to a<br />
statement about the West, as he calls it, and<br />
the only country that fits that description is<br />
the United States of America. In the debate<br />
on Government policy the Leader of the<br />
Opposition used -these words:<br />
The West has no standards and apparently no<br />
scruples. The Americans have already supported<br />
eight so-called governments in Vietnam, and all<br />
of them have been military dictatorships, and all<br />
have been tyrannical and oppressive.<br />
Mr. Uren.-Answer that proposition.<br />
Mr. SPEAKER ( Hon. Sir John McLeay).<br />
-Order! The honorable member for Reid<br />
will come to order.<br />
Mr. HAROLD HOLT.-I have said<br />
enough, I think, to show that the substance<br />
of what I allege regarding honorable<br />
gentlemen opposite and their leader has<br />
been borne out by recent developments. Mr. Uren.-I want you to answer that<br />
proposition. Mr. SPEAKER.-Order! 1 will not warn<br />
the honorable member again. I will deal<br />
with him.<br />
Mr. HAROLD HOLT.-I have only three<br />
minutes left and I want to answer the statement<br />
made by the Leader of the Opposition<br />
that the events at my public meeting the<br />
other night resulted from an upsurge of the<br />
pentup feelings of Australian youth. I have<br />
in my hand a newsletter distributed by the<br />
Youth Campaign Against Conscription.<br />
It gives details of the names and addresses<br />
of the President and Secretary. I shall not<br />
read it in full, but if honorable members<br />
want to know some details of the demonstrations<br />
that have occurred they will find them<br />
set out here. More interestingly, I can give<br />
them advance notice of the demonstrations<br />
for Wednesday, 6th April, Friday,<br />
April, Friday, 22nd April and Friday, 29th<br />
April. But in relation to Monday, 28th<br />
March, the night of my meeting, the document<br />
says-<br />
7 Kew Gardens. Meet at the corner of<br />
Gellibrand Street and Cotham Road, Kew ( just<br />
inside the gaidens) prior to Liberal Kooyong Meeting'at<br />
Kew Civic Centre, Cotham Road. This time,<br />
some will protest silently by standing around the<br />
Hall with signs on a givei signal. Others will remain<br />
part of the audience and heckle and ask<br />
questions.<br />
This was the spontaneous upsurge of Australian<br />
youth to which the Leader of the<br />
Opposition referred. I say in conclusion that<br />
the foolish people who take part in these<br />
demonstrations will find that they are having<br />
exactly the reverse effect to that which they<br />
intend. There are in this country ways in<br />
which people may demonstrate a political<br />
opposition to Government policies or the<br />
views of members of Parliament. But no<br />
Australian who values democracy in this<br />
country will accept as a reasonable demonstration<br />
the methods that were adopted on<br />
this occasion.<br />
BY AUTHORITY: A. J. ARTHUR, COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT PRINTER, CANBERRA </p>
