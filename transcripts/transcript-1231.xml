FOR PRESS: ELECT. ED MINISTRY<br />
Statement by the Leader of the Parliamentary Liberal<br />
Party, th Rt. Hon. Harold Holt, M. P.<br />
The question of an elected Ministry was<br />
raised at the meeting of the Liberal Party this afternoon.<br />
There was no proposal that the elective process should apply<br />
to the Ministry about fo be formed. The proposal before the<br />
meeting was that a Committee of the Party be constituted to<br />
go more thoroughly into this question in all its aspects and<br />
to report back to the Party prior to the next Federal General<br />
Election. The view taken by the Party after discussion<br />
was to reject the setting up of a Committee of the Party,<br />
but to regard the matter as open to be raised at the first<br />
meeting held following the general elections, which are likely<br />
to be held towards the end of this year.<br />
CAkBERRA, January, 1966. </p>
