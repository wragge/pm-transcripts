N. S. W. CHAMBEROF MAN1IFACTLJRFRS DINNE R<br />
S YDNEV, N. S. W1 29 JULY 1971<br />
S p ee ch by the Prime Minister. Mr ' VilIIisn-1 McMahon<br />
Mr President, Ladies, and Gentlemen:<br />
I want to talk to you tonight about the partnership I beliee.<br />
exists between Government and industry in Australia today. And I want to<br />
indicate how important that is, not only to our material wellbeing, but to the<br />
preservation of those real values that belong to a free enterprise society.<br />
I believe that such a society is t uilt on the rights of the<br />
individual to a good education in a secure and healthy environment. It is<br />
built on the efforts we make collectively to use the great resources of our<br />
land to manufacture goods and services we need and those we can sell.<br />
It is based on initiative, encouragement and a sense of adventure.<br />
And it will be a successful society if Government helps<br />
to the best of its ability in national economic management, and if industry<br />
responds as innovators and developers in a climate of vigorous and<br />
healthy competition. I believe the problems of the day can be relatively<br />
short-term. If we get effective co-operation between government and<br />
private enterprise and a more mioderate and rational attitude by organised.<br />
labor to demands on resom-ces at large, then I believe we can prosper<br />
greatly. I don't think I need to remind you that we are now an<br />
industrialised society, and in many segments, a highly sophisticated one.<br />
All this has happened in the quarter of a century since the war. I take<br />
this opportunity, therefore, of acknowledging the contribution Australian<br />
manufacturing industry has made to this progress.<br />
You will know, as I do, that manufacturing industry<br />
employs 28 per cent of the Australian work force and contributes 28 per cent<br />
of the Gross National Product. And the total value of production from nearly<br />
39, 000 factories is getting on towards OOintiion. Its exports last year were<br />
worth $ 724 million which is 18 per cent of our total exports and rising.<br />
And it attracted about 30 per cent of the total direct private overseas<br />
investment in Australia. / 2 </p>
<p>So you represerst, Ge-. tlemea, a very significant part of the national effort,<br />
If you have any misgivings about your place in the scheme of things I urge you to forget<br />
them. A Government has many demands made upon it, and if we cannot always meet<br />
them, I ask you to understand that it is a matter of priorities and what is fair to ask<br />
the taxpayer to pay. For, after all, it is his money that keeps us going.<br />
At this point, Gentlemen, let me mention briefly the investment allowance.<br />
Its suspension by the Government earlier this year was one of a series of anti-inflationary<br />
measures which was designed to place a modest restraint on new private investment<br />
in plant and equipment.<br />
This action brought us quite a lot of criticism from many of you. This<br />
was natural, and this we understand, but it was only one of a number of restraints over<br />
the whole area of the economy.<br />
Manufacturers were not singled out to carry a special burden. Manufacturers'<br />
views on the matter were put very forcefully to us at our pre-Budget talks with<br />
industry early this month and we are giving these views careful consideration.<br />
The investment allowance, you will remember, was introduced in 1962 at<br />
a time of declining employment, slow economic activity and uncertainty as to the<br />
outlook for the balance of payments.<br />
It was particularly directed to encouraging expenditures on equipment and<br />
re-equipment of manufacturing industries which were then at a low ebb, and so to<br />
encourage industry to show more vitality and a keener awareness of the opportunities<br />
for growth in the Australian economy.<br />
The concession did, I believe, contribute to the end result we were<br />
seeking. But more recently, as you know serious inflationary pressures emerged in<br />
the economy, and some restraints became necessary.<br />
As I have indicated, the suspension of the investment allowance was just<br />
one of several measures taken by the Government. All I want to say * at this stage<br />
is that the Government's action was a suspension of the allowance, and I can assure you<br />
the matter. will be held under review. Beyond -hat it would be wrong for-me-to-go-at<br />
this time. Now let me say something about two aspects of economic matters which<br />
affect you. One is trade, and the other is tariffs.<br />
In recent years the pattern of our trade has been changing and its direction<br />
has been more to the markets of Asia and the Pacific than to the traditional markets<br />
of the Old World. I have said manufacturers are now providing 18 per cent of our total exports.<br />
In 1969/ 70 sixty per cent of this total went to Asia and the Pacific area and was worth<br />
$ 409 million. Seven out of our ten largest markets are in this area. They are, in<br />
order, New Zealand which has been our largest market for many years Papua-<br />
New Guinea, Japan, Singapore, Philippines, Malaysia and Hong Kong. o e / 3 </p>
<p>This, of course, is greatly to the credit of Australian manufacturers. But<br />
as part of the partnership which I mentioned at the beginning of this speech, the<br />
Australian Government has<br />
Negotiated trade treaties in the region;<br />
Has spent many millions of dollars on promotion of<br />
Australian products in those markets;<br />
Provided insurance guarantees and export incentives; and<br />
0 Is now maintaining seventeen Trade Commissioner posts<br />
there out of about fifty all over the world.<br />
And I am glad to see that Australian industry is now moving quite steadily<br />
into the area of joint ventures in the region where once it was just a case of buying and<br />
selling. Australian manufacturing companies are now involved in joint ventrues in places.<br />
like Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines.<br />
All this activity will assist us if and when Britain goes into the Common<br />
Market as we expect her to. Manufacturers will, as you know, be affected by this,<br />
although the principal impact will be on rural industries.<br />
Britain's entry could have adverse effects on your ability to compete with<br />
British manufacturers within Britain. It could also put you at a disadvantage in<br />
competing with the present E. E. C. market where B ritish exporters would enjoy an<br />
improved position. So, Gentlemen, there is a pretty healthy challenge ahead of us in our<br />
partnership. There is the challenge br . ought about by change; by the shifting<br />
patterns of world trade; and by our own developing interest in the Asian and Pacific<br />
region. There is the challenge at home to diversify still more our manufacturing<br />
industries and to support our great new mining industries with processing and<br />
muanufacturing activities.<br />
There are of course major problems of cost involved in these developments,<br />
but it is encouraging that nine of our mineral companies are already committed to<br />
begin or enlarge processing facilities associated with their operations in the seventies.<br />
There is also the challenge to find new markets and develop existing ones.<br />
To do this we must be able to compete effectively and this means a greater self-discipline<br />
6n costs and new levels of efficiency.<br />
I turn now to tariffs which are so closely bound up with the principle of<br />
competition to which I have referred. I have concentrated in my remarks on the<br />
tariff but there are many other ways in which the Government can assist industry<br />
to achieve our mutual objectives of growth and productivity.<br />
I am by no means leaving these out of account. On the contrary, in all<br />
of these elements, we wish to continue to work in partnership with private enterprise. / 4 </p>
<p>There are two considerations before us in any discussion of this subject.<br />
One is our responsibility as a Government to manufacturing industries which are of<br />
tremendous importance to Australia. The other is the benefit which comes to the<br />
Australian people from healthy and sustained competition.<br />
Competition keeps prices and quality where they ought to be. This stimulates<br />
the innovator to try new products and the manager to higher levels of efficiency. How<br />
can we ensure that the manufacturing sector continues to contribute to the growth of the<br />
Australian economy? The simple answer is by ensuring that it uses the resources it has as fully<br />
-and as efficiently as possible. This is, of course, the prescr-iption that would be given<br />
$ Dr any sector of the economy.<br />
It is accepted by all that a rising standard of living is a fundamental objective<br />
of economic policy, and that increasing productivity is a pre-requisite for this. But<br />
there is less willingness to accept the implications for the way we allocate our scarce<br />
national resources. It is in this context that I wish to raise briefly the question of tariff protection.<br />
You will all know of the statement that was made recently on tariff policy by my<br />
colleague, Mr. Anthony.<br />
And you will be aware that the Government recently sent to the Tariff<br />
Board the first ten references marking the beginning of a systematic review of the<br />
tariff. There are two aspects of tariff policy which seem to concern some<br />
manufacturers the more critical attitude which the Tariff Board had said it will adopt<br />
towards highly PrutCLed activities. -and the way this attitude will be implemented, in<br />
the review of the tariff.<br />
I have already commented, by implication, on the first matter. If we want<br />
a rising standard of living for a growing population, we must continuously increase<br />
the efficiency with which we use our national resources.<br />
If we want to increase the efficiency with which we use our resources, we<br />
cannot be indifferent to the way these resources are allocated. We cannot accept<br />
uncritically their use in activities which require high levels of protection because,<br />
prima facie, such a ctivities are less suited to the Australian environment.<br />
It has been estimated that the total value of private investment in the<br />
manufacturing sector during the next 20 years will be at least three times that which<br />
has occurred during the last 20 years. It seems probable that there will also be<br />
a substantial increase in the number of persons employed in manufacturing.<br />
We simply cannot afford to allow a significant proportion of these resources.<br />
to drift into activities for which our environment is less suited. It is the concern of<br />
the Government to ensure that this increasing investment of both human and capital<br />
resources will be applied where it promotes rather than retards the growth of<br />
Australia's future prosperity. </p>
<p>We must see to it that this future investment produces the greatest benefit<br />
to the community. To do otherwise would be to allow Australia to become a high-cost<br />
low-productivity economy, less and less able to compete in world markets.<br />
If our secondary industries are to export increasingly to the world's market.-<br />
in competition with other industrial nations, we must ensure that our protection systemn<br />
does nct discourage the development of Australian industry according to the principle<br />
of comparative advantage.<br />
There are several comments I would like to make about the review of the<br />
tariff, and the apprehension which some manufacturers still seem to feel about it. It<br />
has been suggested that entire industries are threatened with extinction.<br />
No Government would in fact accept a series of recommendations from the<br />
Tariff Board which had the intent or effect of dismantling large areas of secondary<br />
industry; and I don't for a moment believe the Tariff Board would ever make such<br />
recommendations. Those who predict the demise of whole industries fail to appreciate the<br />
distinction between an ' activity' and an ' industry', and fail to recognise, when studying<br />
data on average rates of protection for various industries, that an average is an<br />
average. The Tariff Board has said it will adopt a more critical approach towards<br />
highly protective activities namely those with effective protection over 50 per cent.<br />
Conclusions were erroneously drawn by critics that the future of all<br />
activities within highly protected industries was in jeopardy, when data were recently<br />
published by the Tariff Board on the struct ure of protection in Australia whnich showed<br />
the average rate of effective protection for industries. These erroneous conclusions<br />
were drawn despite information the Board published about the wide variation of rates<br />
within each of these industries.<br />
Those who regard the tariff review as essentially negative fail to appreciate,<br />
I believe, the complex network of inter -relationships between different manufacturing<br />
activities in the economy.<br />
It is only when one begins to explore the nature of these relationships that<br />
the positive effects which the tariff review will have become apparent. For example,<br />
a reduction in the duty on a particular product will increase the effective protection<br />
afforded those using the product concerned. Duty reductions are not therefore<br />
necessarily negative.<br />
Conversely, duty increases are not necessarily positive for those using<br />
protected products. In a nutshell, an increase in a duty does not necessarily result<br />
in an increase in protection. An important fact highlighted by the information the<br />
Tariff Board recently published on the structure of protection in Australia is that<br />
many manufacturing activities do not need all the protection which the tariff at present<br />
affords them. oes. ./ 6 </p>
<p>In other words, the costs of some activities using protected products are<br />
inflated in order to provide protection to other activities which do not need it.<br />
As your own organisation, Mr. President, has argued that high costs are<br />
the main cause of the present inflation, it would doubtless stjppr t-. c s'e-y removal<br />
of this excess protection. Consuming industries, for intanc2, i. I_: 2 c-. ly<br />
from reduction of protection on their inputs in cases where exiatL=; is ar( higher<br />
than necessary to sustain profitable local production of those inputs.<br />
In such cases, the removal of the unnecessary protection will reduce<br />
the costs of the consuming industries. This, in turn, will make trhe prices of their<br />
outputs more competitive. Removal of those tariffs which do not prcAt. any local<br />
production another purpose of the review will reduce the cos: zS of d inputs<br />
for manufacturing. In this connection, I remind you that between 60 and 70 per cent of all<br />
Australian imports in the main, those which are not in competition with local<br />
production are used in direct factory production by Australian mr'-rcturers.<br />
Removal of unnecessary protection and preferential margins on imports which<br />
are not in competition with local production will directly benefit manufacturers using<br />
such imports in their production. fi cases where existing preferertial margins are<br />
substantial, their removal may also be expected to give Austra-?--:,-nufact-. r.-_ rs<br />
access to new and cheaper sources of imported materials and eq i-ment.<br />
In all these cases, removal of unnecessary protection in the cour3 e of<br />
the tariff review will make the Australian manufacturing sector more competitive without<br />
detriment to any existing Australian industry.<br />
And the market for Australian manufactures will, as a result, tend to expand<br />
faster. This, in turn, will increase the employment opportunities for labour and<br />
capital in Australian manufacturing.<br />
The review will also bring some important indirect benefits for<br />
manufacturing industry. One such benefit, overlooked by some who are apprehensive<br />
about the review, is the additional information which it should provide about manufacturing<br />
activities in Australia.<br />
For example, it should provide for manufacturers more specific information<br />
than is at present available<br />
about the size of the domestic market for particular products;<br />
about production costs at different levels of output; and<br />
about the general structure of local industry.<br />
This is obviously basic information for any potential investor in a manufacturing<br />
activity. </p>
<p>The review should also provide individual manufactukers with a unique lIU*<br />
between their own activities and those of the industry to which they belong to the<br />
extent that statistics published by the Tariff Board can be compared with the more<br />
aggregated statistics published by the Bureau of Census and Statistics.<br />
Indeed, because of the immense volume of data already available from the<br />
Bureau, and the new information which will become available as a result of its<br />
in~ egrated economic censuses, links between statistics published by the Board and<br />
those published by the Bureau will add a new dimension to public understanding of the<br />
costs and benefits-of protection.<br />
This will be to the advantage of manufacturers, the Government and the<br />
community. In summary, I am confident we can expect quite positive -and beneficial<br />
effects for manufacturing industry and for the whole community to flow from the<br />
systematic review of the-tariff.<br />
I believe our policy is wholly constructive. It is not punitive. It is<br />
designed to help not hinder. It is part, I believe, of the new maturity which has come<br />
to Australian industry and will be for the good of all. I<br />
I do congratulate you all on the wonderful job manufacturing industry is doing<br />
to speed the growth of the nation and on the efforts it is making to increase productivity.<br />
This is a time when new products, new ideas and the application of new technologies are<br />
of tremendous importance and have a fertilising influence on the whole of the economy.<br />
Your horizons are getting wider every year and I wish you well in your<br />
great endeavours. </p>
