a:; d Resources, the Rt. 1ion. J. D. Anthony, M. P.)<br />
I wish to advise the House that the Government has approved<br />
a comprehensive package of new arrangements to govern trans-<br />
Tasman trade under a closer economic relationship between<br />
Australia and New Zealand. These arrangements cover the most<br />
far-reaching economic undertakings that Australia has yet made in<br />
a bilateral agreement.<br />
The Government's decision was taken following Cabinet<br />
consideration of a report on my meeting with the New Zealand<br />
Prime Minister, Mr. Muldoon, in Wellington on 28 October. At<br />
that meeting, Mr. Muldoon and I reached agreement on a number of<br />
variations to earlier proposals and agreed to put these to our<br />
respective Cabinets for endorsement.<br />
New Zealand's acceptance of the new arrangements was<br />
announced by Mr. Muldoon on 1 November.<br />
It is proposed that the formal signature of the Heads of<br />
Agreement for a new trade treaty will take place within the next<br />
few weeks, and the new arrangements will apply from 1 January<br />
1983. The decision by both governments to implement new trading<br />
arrangements completes a process of detailed study, consultation<br />
and negotiation which was formally launched after a meeting<br />
between the Prime Minister and Mr. Muldoon in Wellington in March<br />
1980. A joint communique, issued by the two Prime Ministers was<br />
tabled in this House by the Prime Minister on 25 March 1980. That<br />
communique referred to the close relationship which had developed<br />
between Australia and New Zealand across a wide front, and said<br />
that an appropriately structured closer economic relationship<br />
would bring benefits to both countries and improve living<br />
standards. The new arrangements give practical meaning to that view in<br />
respect of trade. They are a logical step forward in the series<br />
of trade agreements between our two countries which started with<br />
the preferential Trade Agreement of 1922, and led through to the<br />
New Zealand-Australia Free Trade Agreement of 1965 and the 1977<br />
Agreement on Tariffs and Tariff Preferences.<br />
The previous framework of agreements supported the<br />
development of a vigorous trade across the Tasman and recognised<br />
the fact that each country is the other's major export market for<br />
manufactures. By removing the remaining'trade barriers, the new<br />
arrangements are expected to further expand this trade, with<br />
positive effects on production and employment. v </p>
<p>Mr. S. peaer ; hcn he t;: ed Lje 15O0 joint co ;, uniq ue, the<br />
Prime Minister gave an assurance tihat tht-e would be full<br />
consultation with interested parties, and that the details of any<br />
proposed new arrangemen-ts would be made public before substantive<br />
decisions were taken. In keeping with that commitment, on 4 June<br />
this year the Australian and New Zealand Governments released a<br />
report containing draft Heads of Agreement for proposed new<br />
arrangements to govern trans-Tasman trade under a closer economic<br />
relationships. The main aim of these proposals was quite simply the gradual<br />
and progressive liberalisation of trade across the Tasman for all<br />
goods produced in either country. With this in view, there was<br />
provision for the phasing out of tariffs within five years of the<br />
commencement of an agreement. There was also provision for the<br />
progressive removal by New Zealand of import licensing and tariff<br />
quotas, by increasing access by 10 per cent a year in real terms,<br />
and completely eliminating these restrictions by 1995 at the<br />
latest. It was agreed that in the long term, there should not be<br />
export subsidies and incentives in trans-Tasman trade, and all<br />
performance-based export incentives were to be removed no later<br />
than 1987. The draft Heads of Agreement released in June gave full<br />
details of proposed arrangements, but it is important to note<br />
that the proposals envisaged modified arrangements for a small<br />
range of goods. Some of these arrangements, such as those for<br />
dairy products and wine, were based on agreements reached between<br />
the respective Australian and New Zealand industries.<br />
It is also important to note that the draft Heads of<br />
Agreement included provisions for consultations and safeguards to<br />
offset any unfair advantages which might arise from dumping,<br />
subsidisation or intermediate goods problems. There were also<br />
general safeguard provisions to cover any cases of severe<br />
material injury arising from the trade liberalisation process<br />
during the transition period of the agreement.<br />
In addition, the draft Heads of Agreement covered such<br />
matters as rationalisation, Government purchasing, agricultural<br />
stabilisation and standards, all of which are significant in a<br />
free trading relationship.<br />
After those draft proposals were released, Commonwealth<br />
Ministers and officials held extensive consultations with State<br />
Governments, national industry organisations and other interested<br />
parties throughout Australia.<br />
These consultations showed that there was widespread support<br />
in principle in Australia for the objectives of the proposed new<br />
arrangements, that is, bringing about equality in trading<br />
opportunities and fair competition in trans-Tasman trade. There<br />
was a wide recognition also that the proposed arrangement will<br />
result in an improvement, c-. er time, in the inequalities facing </p>
<p>Australian industry under NAr'A. At the same timr. e, h ver,<br />
here w'as criticism of certain spcts of tje draft pr-. Cols .<br />
' The st: rojg-e st criticism wa-s d i r~ t t? t t proposed lt s for<br />
the ultI imate eli inati on in t r ns-' T: is; an trade of perfrci: inccdbased<br />
export incentives and ir: port restrictions, by 1987 and 1995<br />
respectively. Taking account of reactions to the draft package, Mr.<br />
. uIildoon and I tried, in the final phase of negotiations, to<br />
explore the scope for mutually acceptable modifications and<br />
improvements in the arrangements, consistent with the guiding<br />
principles and objectives of the closer economic'relationship.<br />
While it did not prove possible to provide for earlier<br />
termination of export incentives and import restrictions, we<br />
reached agreement on the means by which certain measures would be<br />
modified to take account of Australian concerns.<br />
It has been agreed that performance-based incentives<br />
available to exporters in trans-Tasman trade will be halved in<br />
1985, with further reductions of 25 per cent in 1986 and 1987.<br />
This agreement does not preclude faster phase-down arrangements<br />
being established by the New Zealand Government as a result of<br />
its current review of future export assistance policy. Furthermore,<br />
I have been assured that Australia's concerns will be a<br />
major consideration of the New Zealand Government in their<br />
review. On import restrictions, it has been agreed to double the<br />
fninimium access levels applying under the liberalisation formula,<br />
from $ NZ200,000 to SNZ400,000 in each item code/ quota category.<br />
Further, it has been agreed that the 10 per cent a year real<br />
growth in access opportunities, generated under the standard<br />
liberalisation formula, will be increased to 15 per cent a year<br />
for all item codes/ quota categories where access opportunities<br />
are below $ NZ1 million. This higher rate will apply until such<br />
time as access opportunities reach or exceed $ NZl million; after<br />
that, a 10 per cent growth factor will apply.<br />
These modifications will result in a significant increase in<br />
access opportunities available to Australian exporters in the<br />
first year and will, of course, be compounded as New Zealand's<br />
import licensing regime is progressively liberalised under the<br />
new agreement. It is important to recognise that both countries do not<br />
enter the exercise from equal positions, in terms of the nature<br />
and extent of protective and assistance mechanisms available to<br />
their respective industries. The industrial bases in each<br />
country also differ in their breadth and composition. For these<br />
and other reasons, it was necessary in the negotiations to strike<br />
a balance between achieving equality of dpportunity and fair<br />
competition between the two countries as soon as possible and the<br />
need for gradualism in the trade liberalisation process to allow<br />
time for industries on both sides to adjust. </p>
<p>The Gov\ rn;; ent is 3Varie of su.; 1 sti. ons ; hat ' detailde st' ies<br />
:. re re; ii ir .: d to : ens're that te pnrc-': po d new arra . ngenciltcsa rry<br />
no adverse implications for particular States, regions or<br />
industries. There have also been suggestions that special<br />
adjustment assistance may be needed. The Government does<br />
recognise the concerns underlying such proposals. It does not,<br />
however, consider that such Teasures are necessary. It is also<br />
satisfied that the new arrangements do not carry any significant<br />
adverse implications, either short or long term, for employment<br />
or regional activity. On the contrary, the overall impact is<br />
expected to be positive.<br />
This is because the provisions of the new agreement, which<br />
will be the most comprehensive bilateral trade agreement ever<br />
negotiated by Australia, are designed to apply gradually, to<br />
minimise disruption and to provide for adequate safeguards. In<br />
addition special arrangements for modified programs have already<br />
been established, as I have stated, for industries which are<br />
regarded as particularly sensitive to increased trans-Tasman<br />
competition. It rust be recognised, however, that there are still<br />
sections of industry that feel concern over the possible impact<br />
of the proposed agree--ent on Closer Economic Relations. I<br />
believe thie great imajority of these fears can be clearly shown to<br />
be misplaced indeed, it can be shown that without Closer<br />
Economic Relations, it would not be possible to find solutions<br />
for several existing inequities in trans-Tasman trade.<br />
In the timber industry, for example, there are fears that<br />
the proposed agreement will lead to unfair competition from<br />
increased imports. The fact is under the proposed arrangements,<br />
there will be no change in duty and access provisions for trans-<br />
Tasman trade in sawn timber and plywood. Trade across the Tasman<br />
in these products has been duty-free and unrestricted since<br />
1966. Without the proposed new agreement, moreover, there would<br />
be no redress of inequities such as New Zealand's exports<br />
incentives and lack of free access for other forest products.<br />
This applies to other sensitive areas, such as horticultural<br />
products. Performance-based export incentives are probably the issue<br />
of greatest concern to the industry, and some people will<br />
probably be disappointed that it has not been possible to remove<br />
these even earlier. However, Australian industry will retain its<br />
existing right to take action against New Zealand imports where<br />
it can be shown that dumped or subsidised imports are causing or<br />
threatening material injury to an Australian industry. Some<br />
Australian industries, indeed, have already sought-anti-dumping<br />
or countervailing action.<br />
I do regret that such action has become necessary,<br />
particularly when it occurs in industry sectors where it had been<br />
hoped that industry-to-industry understandings could be </p>
<p>S reached. Unfortunately efforts to come to understandings on sawn<br />
timber and plywood have not yet produced positive results. It is<br />
to be hoped that in the very near future, satisfactory joint<br />
industry undertakings can be reached.<br />
I would hope that generally, any problems that might arise<br />
would be resolved through consultation, avoiding the need for<br />
resort to anti-dumping or countervailing action.<br />
A number of other improvements and modifications have been<br />
agreed, in respect of aspects of export incentives and import<br />
restrictions, allocation of exclusive access, transitional<br />
safeguards, intermediate goods, government purchasing and a<br />
number of specific product issues. Overall, I believe that this<br />
agreement represents an outcome with which both sides should be<br />
well pleased. The decision to proceed puts both countries on the<br />
threshold of a new and most comprehensive trading arrangement.<br />
Both Australia and New Zealand can look forward to growing trans-<br />
Tasman trade, to the benefit of both their peoples, and they can<br />
look forward also through this agreement to the security that<br />
will come from a strengthened ability to contribute to the<br />
development of the region.<br />
Around the world today, we see increasing trade restrictions<br />
threatening international economic growth, and inward-looking<br />
policies in many countries becoming the order of the day. It is<br />
timely, in these circumstances, to remind ourselves that the<br />
commitment we are making to trade and commercial expansion<br />
between Australia and New Zealand has the ability to add to<br />
wealth and employment for both our countries. If similar faith<br />
and vision can be displayed in forthcoming international forums<br />
where trading problems are to be dealt with, then we will be well<br />
on the way, I believe, to achieving the international economic<br />
recovery that we all seek so deeply. </p>
