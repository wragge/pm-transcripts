PRESS STATEMENT BY THE ACTING PRIME MINISTER<br />
NUCLEAR FALL-OUT ON AUSTRALIA<br />
The Acting Prime Minister Mr Barnard announced<br />
today that the first fall-out in Australia from this year's<br />
French nuclear testing programme had been detected at the<br />
Laverton Air Filter Sampling Station near Melbourne. Mr<br />
Barnard said that the detection of fall-out verified that recent<br />
French nuclear testing was a clear breach of the ruling<br />
of the world Court.<br />
The fall-out is currently at low levels of concentration<br />
detectable only by the more sensitive devices.<br />
Samples from five other air sampling stations are now<br />
being checked to see how widely the fall-out has been<br />
distributed. The people of Australia could be assured that the<br />
experts concerned with the Australian moni. toring programme<br />
are watching fall-out 32vels closely and that the Government<br />
would be kept fully informed.<br />
Fall-out data as it becomes available is being passed<br />
to the Australian Ionising Radiation Advisory Council, which<br />
will advise the Government concerning the effects of fall-out<br />
on the Australian population.<br />
Mr Barnard said the Government would issue prompt advice<br />
if it believed that any special dietary measures should be<br />
taken against the effects of fall-out in milk.<br />
Unless such advice is given, consumption of fresh milk<br />
should not be discontinued. </p>
