    <content><![CDATA[<p>On behalf of the Government and the people of Australia I convey my condolences on the death of former German Chancellor Helmut Kohl.</p>
<p>In Dr Kohl's 16 years as Chancellor of Germany he was central in shaping not only the Germany we see today, but modern Europe.</p>
<p>Chancellor Kohl, in overseeing reunification, laid the foundations for a strong and united Germany.</p>
<p>He was the driving force behind the adoption of a common European currency and cemented Germanyâ€™s partnership with France.</p>
<p>Chancellor Kohl never wavered in his commitment to his democratic principles and ideals and will forever be remembered for his leading role in promoting global peace and prosperity.</p>
<p>Chancellor Kohl was also a good friend to Australia and was committed to the partnership between Australia and Germany which continues to go from strength to strength.</p>
