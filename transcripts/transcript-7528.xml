FOR MEDIA 13 MARCH 1989<br />
Today is Commonwealth Day. Today, and every second Monday<br />
in March, the members of the Commonwealth celebrate this<br />
unique association of countries.<br />
The Commonwealth has developed into an important<br />
international forum, having taken the lead on political<br />
issues such as the Rhodesia settlement and South Africa, and<br />
standing as a testament to co-operation between developed<br />
and developing nations on practical matters as varied as<br />
environmental issues and telecommunications.<br />
In recent years the Commonwealth has pursued a constructive<br />
role in seeking to bring about an end to the apartheid<br />
system in South Africa. Australia is proud to have been<br />
deeply involved in developing Commonwealth initiatives in<br />
this area, particularly the establishment of the Eminent<br />
Persons Group and the Foreign Ministers' Committee on<br />
southern Africa. In July this year, Australia will be<br />
hosting the final meeting of this Committee, which will be<br />
discussing a number of new initiatives for the Commonwealth<br />
to consider.<br />
The next meeting of the forty-eight Commonwealth Heads of<br />
Government will take place in Kuala Lumpur in October. I am<br />
looking forward to attending the meeting. It will address<br />
directly these pressing issues, as well as others such as<br />
the condition of the global environment and Commonwealth<br />
co-operation against drug trafficking. </p>
