    <content><![CDATA[<p>FOR PRESS: No 99/1970Â </p>
<p>Every Premier asked the-Commonwealth to agree to their dropping completely the receipts duty as it now exists and to make good to the State Budgets the whole of the loss involved, for this financial year.</p>
<p>They were of the view that to continue imposing receipts duty, even where it was legal, would be inequitable in its incidence and administratively too complex to be at all feasible.</p>
<p>The Commonwealth has accepted the arguments of the States and has acceded to their request. Discussions on arrangements for future years are still continuing.</p>
<p>CANBERRA<br />8 October 1970</p>
