    <content><![CDATA[<p>MONTREAL WORLD EXHIBITION AUSTRALIAN ADVISORY COMMITTEE<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister, Sir Robert Menzies<br />
The Government has appointed an Advisory Committee to<br />
help develop plans for Australia's part in the World Exhibition<br />
to be held in Montreal in 1967.<br />
The twelve-man committee comprises prominent Australians,<br />
representing a wide cross-section of our community, ranging from<br />
industry and commerce to science and the arts. This committee,<br />
under the chairmanship of Sir Frederick White, Chairman of the<br />
will act as an advisory panel to Sir Hastings Harrington,<br />
whose appointment as Australian Commissioner-General for the<br />
Exhibition was announced last month ( September).<br />
Serving on the Committee with Sir Frederick White will<br />
be:-Mr. R. R. Campbell, OB. Eo, National Gallery, Adelaide.<br />
Judge Adrian H. Curlewis, District Court,<br />
Sydney.<br />
Mr. Warwick D. Fairfax, Chairman, John Fairfax Limited,<br />
( Sydney Morning Herald) Sydney.<br />
Sir William Hudson, Commissioner, Snowy<br />
Mountains Hydro-Electric Authority, Cooma.<br />
Professor J. A. La Nauze, Professor of History,<br />
University of Melbourne.<br />
Sir Maurice Mawby, Conzinc Riotinto of<br />
Australia Limited, Melbourne.<br />
Mr. J. W. Overall, Commissioner,<br />
National Capital Development Commission, Canberra.<br />
Mr. I. H. Seppelt, B. Seppelt sons, Adelaide.<br />
Mr. A. M. Simpson, Simpson Pope Holdings Ltd., Adelaide.<br />
Mr. K. Slessor, OB. E., Daily Telegraph, Sydney.<br />
Mr. H. J. Souter, A. C. ToU., Carlton, Victoria.<br />
Planning is now under way for Australia's contribution to<br />
the Exhibition. I am confident that Australia will acquit herself<br />
well at Montreal, particularly in view of the calibre of the men<br />
who have agreed to serve on the Advisory Committee. </p>
<p>2<br />
The Montreal Exhibition will be the centrepiece of<br />
celebrations to mark the centenary of Canadian Confederation.<br />
It is fitting that Australia should join with Canada in the marking<br />
of this occasion. The Exhibition will be educational, scientific and<br />
cultural in character, taking as its central theme, " Man and His<br />
World". This is the first such exhibition held in North America<br />
and will be one of the largest of its kind staged anywhere in the<br />
world. Some sixty nations will be participating as well as the<br />
Government of Canada, the Canadian Provinces, major Canadian<br />
instrumentalities and industries and certain international bodies.<br />
The Exhibition is expected to attract 30M to 50M visitors<br />
during the six months from April to October, 1967.<br />
