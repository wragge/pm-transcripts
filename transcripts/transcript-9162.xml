TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING, MP<br />
DOORSTOP, PARLIAMENT HOUSE<br />
CANBERRA, 20 MARCH 1994<br />
PM: The truth is, it is not a bad result. The one consistent thing about these tw o byelections<br />
is that the public won't have a bar of the Liberal Party. There was a<br />
swing to Labor in Fremantle and a swing to the Liberals of three and a bit per<br />
cent in Bonython, which means in a real election that we would clean them up<br />
as we have done in the past. So, I suppose, if I had to borrow a phrase from<br />
Les Patterson I would say about this result, " no worries". It is a pretty much in<br />
the groove by-election result and what really happens in these by-elections I<br />
think is that the public say we want you to stay sharp and we are not going to<br />
make it easy for you, particularly when you have a number of minor parties.<br />
But I want to thank the people for Bonython for returning another Labor<br />
member, a member of stature to the National Parliament for the Labor Party<br />
and I would like to make the point about the generational change which is<br />
occurring within the Government. If you look at the last three by-elections,<br />
replacing men who have given a great deal of public service over a decade of<br />
ministerial office, John Kerin, John Dawkins and Neal Blewett have been<br />
replaced by Mark Latham and Carmen Lawrence and now by Martyn Evans. I<br />
mean, three great ministers replaced by three great candidates. And that is<br />
really why the Labor Party is going to be the force it is now through the<br />
nineties. And look at the fogies on the other side. I notice Peter Robinson<br />
today described them appropriately as fogies. I mean Tony Abbott, Downer,<br />
Bishop, these people believe in things that the Liberal Party and others believed<br />
in in the 1940' s and 50O's and I said last week you wouldn't find a 3 5 year old in<br />
the country that holds Tony Abbotts views. In fact the members who are<br />
leaving Jim Carlton and Michael MacKellar were far more progressive than<br />
the, people they are being replaced with.<br />
J: What are your thoughts on the a-nti--immigration crowd ending up with<br />
PM: Oh, I think that just comes and goes. These things come and go I think Peter.<br />
I don't give that any particular weight. But I think I regard one of the<br />
important things for the government is having a generational change and as you<br />
know since the last election now about fourteen ministers, or thirteen I am not </p>
<p>sure thirteen or fourteen ministers, out of the stock of the government have<br />
been changed, are new ministers. And if you look at the quality we are getting<br />
in the by-elections.. I mean what used too happen to the Labor Party in the<br />
is all the crackerjack candidates were in marginal seats and when you<br />
would lose a seat you would lose them and the safe seats often went to people<br />
who were not going to make a great contribution. That's all being reversed.<br />
J: You say generally you would clean them up but on an 8 per cent two party<br />
swing they would clean you up surely?<br />
PM: Look, this is the sort of thing about these days by-elections.. well just have a<br />
look for a start, have a look in Fremantle which everyone is talking about<br />
Western Australia and Richard C ourt and what sort of mandate he has got and<br />
how he's going and here we are in the state where Mabo mattered most,<br />
picking up a swing to the government. Here we are in a state now in South<br />
Australia where there has just been a massive swing against the State Labor<br />
Party, basically with a 3 per cent swing to the Liberal Party and a bit flipping<br />
off to minor candidates. As I said it is a no worries result.<br />
J: Wern't there more revelant federal issues, was it a vote against the Medicare<br />
levy?<br />
PM: No, hardly hit the light of day. Look the other thing is you have got to<br />
understand this also about polls these days I am not talking about by-elections<br />
but just polls I mean what happens in polls these days, people go up and say<br />
what is your preference, are you going to vote for the Coalition or the Labor<br />
Party, they say " well I probably would vote for the Labor Party, but I will say<br />
the Coalition because I will just give the government a little needle." So they<br />
are giving little needles in the polls these days. They have worked all that out,<br />
but of course the pollsters haven't worked it out and generally the journo's<br />
haven't worked it out but I'm glad the camera man can see the humour in all<br />
this even if the journo's can't, but it is true.<br />
J: Prime Minister are you able to give any indication of what the ministerial<br />
changes might be announced next week?<br />
PM: Not at this stage, no. I told you I very much hope to see Carmen Lawrence<br />
take a place in the ministry and I think I would like to see her with a policy job.<br />
I don't know what that will be at this stage but it is going to be a very big week<br />
for the government, I mean getting two people of the calibre of Carmen<br />
Lawrence and Martyn Evans is a tremendous shot in the arm for the Federal<br />
Labor Pa rty, a huge shot in the arm.<br />
J: What does the 3 per cent swing or 3.5 per cent swing say about Dr Hewson's<br />
leadership?<br />
PM: I think, look what he's into now, I mean, poor fella, look six months ago he<br />
was into throwing people off the dole after 9 months. He was going to clean<br />
out the social wage, put people on individual wage contracts, now he is into re-</p>
<p>making himself, into product differentiation from all the other fogies. So now<br />
he's using the word inclusion, as I said, I take that as a compliment, he's got to<br />
borrow our phrases. He is now running around as a sort of person who is remaking<br />
himself into a softer gentler version of his dear old right-wing self of<br />
last year. Now what is the problem here? The problem here is the Li beral<br />
Party does not know where it stands with Australian society. It doesn't know<br />
what it wants to do with Australian siociety and Menzies was probably right<br />
when he told Bob Santamaria some what decade ago, fifteen years ago, that the<br />
Liberal Party had probably run its race then. Well it has more than run its race<br />
now.<br />
J: Some Labor MPs seem to think the Griffith's vacancy should be filled now<br />
PM: I mean, you know I think the Party, I said the other day I think the Party is<br />
pretty fair about these things. This matter has come up and the police have<br />
cleared Alan but there are residual matters to be determined, with Police<br />
enquiries, and that is for him inconvenient but I mean I think all of that doesn't<br />
matter whether there is a place there now for him or not, what matters I think<br />
is the government will always be, or caucus will always be, sympathetic to<br />
somebody who has been, you know, caught in these sort of circumstances.<br />
J: Does that mean they could accommodate him later down the track<br />
PM: Well, now or later on. I mean I don't ever think it is quite the mechanical thing<br />
of leaving a spot there and then saying well if that's not there that is the end of<br />
you. I don't think the Caucus works like that.<br />
J: Mr Keating does the government plan to abolish lump-sum super payments?<br />
PM: This is just a pre-budget story. They flow out every year, all this pre-budget<br />
speculation and the government has not considered it.<br />
J: Just going back to the Bonython by-election, how long do you think it might be<br />
before South Australian's actually forgive Labor rightly or wrongly for the<br />
State Bank<br />
PM: When they work out what a dreary government they have got. I think this<br />
government of all the State Governments, and our ministers run into their<br />
ministers in ministerial councils, the functional ministerial councils, by far the<br />
-dreariest government is the new Liberal government of South Australia. Now<br />
at the moment there is a bit of bonhomie about a new government a new<br />
Premier, but wait till they have a bit of time, they will see how absolutely dead<br />
ordinary this government is.<br />
Thanks </p>
