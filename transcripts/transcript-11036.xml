<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, ladies and gentleman, everybody ready to start the news conference?</p>
<p> Before inviting questions from you on anything you like, could I again</p>
<p> say how very pleased I am at the way in which this conference has</p>
<p> been organised. I'd like to particularly thank Peter Charlton and</p>
<p> Maurice Newman who really have been the two driving forces behind</p>
<p> this. They're not easy things to organise, fairly late notice in a</p>
<p> number of areas through the inevitable circumstances of arranging</p>
<p> visits to Washington and they really have done a sterling job. I want</p>
<p> to thank my two Ministerial colleagues, particularly Joe Hockey who</p>
<p> has specific responsibility for this and Senator Minchin and also</p>
<p> Ted Evans the Treasury Secretary who made a major and very well received</p>
<p> contribution to the conference this morning. It's a very important</p>
<p> collaborative effort. There has been good cooperation with the office</p>
<p> of the Premier of NSW and I was very pleased to have both Mr Carr</p>
<p> and Michael Egan the NSW Treasurer present because it is important</p>
<p> from our point of view, from Australia's point of view that we present</p>
<p> on things like this we present a united front. We are Australians</p>
<p> together overseas working in the long term national interest of our</p>
<p> country. Now, any questions?</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister in terms of the capital gains tax and neutralising</p>
<p> the advantage the US has, when you say neutralised does that mean</p>
<p> we need to bring our capital gains tax down to the same level that</p>
<p> operates here in the United States?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I was talking generically. I don't want at this stage to say</p>
<p> what is going to be our response to a report we haven't received but</p>
<p> what I was clearly indicating is that if you want capital to come</p>
<p> our country and it's more attractive for that capital to go somewhere</p>
<p> else, well you've got to ask yourself whether you ought not do something</p>
<p> about that and quite obviously aspects of our capital tax at the moment</p>
<p> don't represent an incentive for people to invest in Australia and</p>
<p> we do need to look as between specifically Australia in the United</p>
<p> States because the great bulk of the worlds capital is generated in</p>
<p> the United States. You've got to try and achieve as far as possible</p>
<p> a degree of neutrality. Now, that I'm not going to get into whether</p>
<p> that translates into this or that rate in relation to this or that</p>
<p> tax. But I'm stating the general principle and as you would have heard</p>
<p> from my speech we have an enormous number of the generics going for</p>
<p> us but there are some impediments as far as tax is concerned and we</p>
<p> just have to find out how far we can go in fixing them. And then I</p>
<p> think you have really a tremendous package.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, in signalling that you're looking at making the capital</p>
<p> gains tax resume more attractive for American investors in Australia,</p>
<p> is there a danger that Australian companies could find themselves</p>
<p> in a less competitive situation, discriminated against, or will you</p>
<p> ensure in whatever you do with Ralph that Australian companies get</p>
<p> the same advantages that foreign pension funds do in investing in</p>
<p> Australia.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well we won't be discriminating against Australian companies. If the</p>
<p> capital gains tax is reformed well that reform will flow to the benefit</p>
<p> of everybody. There's no way we'll discriminate against Australian</p>
<p> companies.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister you mentioned capital gains tax in your speech, you</p>
<p> didn't mention the corporate tax rate. Does that mean you put greater</p>
<p> emphasis on reducing capital gains tax as an investment incentive</p>
<p> rather than the corporate tax rate.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No not necessarily, Glenn. The purpose of my speech was to talk against</p>
<p> the background of knowing that other speakers had gone into a great</p>
<p> amount of detail regarding the micro and macro economic cast of the</p>
<p> Australian economy at the moment. The purpose of my speech was to</p>
<p> talk in more general terms. Look, the question of a lower corporate</p>
<p> tax rate is obviously a very key element and the debate's well known</p>
<p> and the arguments, some of the arguments for and against have been</p>
<p> quite well rehearsed already. I am just conscious that in relation</p>
<p> to the capital markets the operation of aspects of the capital gains</p>
<p> tax is probably more specifically and more narrowly relevant. It's</p>
<p> not that generally speaking it's more relevant than the corporate</p>
<p> tax rate.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, are you looking at removing the need for US pension</p>
<p> funds to use limited partnerships to get capital gains tax exemptions?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Oh I'd be amazed if that weren't one of the things that came up in</p>
<p> the consideration in the wake of Ralph. I mean I'm not.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Is it a good idea?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I'm not pre-empting anything. Let me make it clear, I quite deliberately</p>
<p> avoided today making any specific announcements because I think it</p>
<p> derails a rational handling of the Ralph process for me to do that.</p>
<p> But I clearly indicated areas that I as Prime Minister think need</p>
<p> attention. And I'd be very surprised if that issue didn't come up.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, I've got actually three quick questions, but the first</p>
<p> one is about the capital gains tax business. It would have been handy</p>
<p> if you'd been able to make your announcement on this visit. How much</p>
<p> have American CEO's mentioned this to you in your private discussions.</p>
<p> Is it an issue that is raised like it was this morning?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well a number of them have mentioned it but the question of whether</p>
<p> or not Sydney becomes a world financial centre is not going to be</p>
<p> governed by whether I make a specific announcement on this visit.</p>
<p> Rhetoric doesn't govern these things. People pay on outcomes. The</p>
<p> sort of people that I'm meeting here are quintessentially pay on outcomes</p>
<p> they don't pay on rhetoric. They're the last mob in the world that</p>
<p> pay on rhetoric.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>But so are they holding back before you do this?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No they just want to know what our policy changes are. They're not</p>
<p> particularly keen, I mean I could make all sorts of flowery remarks,</p>
<p> but in the end they pay on results which is good and fair enough by</p>
<p> me. We've delivered results and we'll deliver some results out of</p>
<p> Ralph too.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>And the two other quick questions, one is we now have a new Prime</p>
<p> Minister in Papua New Guinea, can you say what you think of this development</p>
<p> and the final question is, a more domestic one, there's a huge controversy</p>
<p> raging about the idea of...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well can we just sort - deal with Papua New Guinea a moment and then</p>
<p> we'll move onto whatever other question you want to ask me. I would</p>
<p> like to congratulate Sir Mekere Morauta on his appointment as</p>
<p> the new Prime Minister of Papua New Guinea. I particularly welcome</p>
<p> it. I think he's a person who brings a great deal of strength to the</p>
<p> position. He's a very straight forward man. His priority is to put</p>
<p> his country's economy on a sound footing and we would like on a proper</p>
<p> basis to help him in that respect but it has to be on the basis that</p>
<p> ongoing economic reform is essential. Cooperation with the International</p>
<p> Monetary Fund, to implement agreed programs of reform, that is essential.</p>
<p> Papua New Guinea does have a special relationship with Australia.</p>
<p> We want to give him all the help we can to carry out his reform program</p>
<p> and I hope that his election will bring a period of stability and</p>
<p> getting on with the job to his country because in recent times there</p>
<p> have been grounds for concern about the lack of predicability and</p>
<p> stability and the constant debate and speculation about the future</p>
<p> government of the country and I particularly welcome his election.</p>
<p>I would want to record that under Bill Skate's leadership the country</p>
<p> did make considerable progress in dealing with the difficult problem</p>
<p> of Bougainville. And I would not want his retiring as Prime Minister</p>
<p> to go unremarked in relation to that issues but to Sir Mekere Morauta</p>
<p> I wish him well, I congratulate him and I hope to be in touch with</p>
<p> him next week. I intend to speak to him next week when I return to</p>
<p> Australia and I look forward to a very close and productive relationship</p>
<p> with him.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>With your indulgence the quick final question was, there is a huge</p>
<p> controversy in Australia at the moment about talk show host John Laws</p>
<p> being paid over a million dollars to go easy on the banks so to speak.</p>
<p> Do you think that kind of transaction is acceptable?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I've heard about this and I've been briefed on it. I don't know</p>
<p> all of the details and I understand the station is conducting an inquiry.</p>
<p> I also understand that other authorities are talking about an inquiry,</p>
<p> I don't want to make a judgement at this stage on the detail of it</p>
<p> until I have more information. I must say I was surprised to hear</p>
<p> about it and disappointed. I don't know whether all the claims made</p>
<p> are correct. In fairness to the people involved they should be given</p>
<p> an opportunity to respond on that but I was surprised. Speaking generally,</p>
<p> speaking generically I had always understood it was a fundamental</p>
<p> of our system of public debate on issues in our country that people</p>
<p> expressed, the views that people expressed were their views on the</p>
<p> merits of individual issues and nothing else. And there's clearly</p>
<p> a difference between somebody who specifically endorses a product</p>
<p> in a commercial sense and somebody expressing a view as a consequence</p>
<p> of a commercial understanding of which the public is unaware, entered</p>
<p> into between that person and an organisation about which that view</p>
<p> or a group of organisations abut which is expressed. I mean that raises</p>
<p> a whole range of other considerations. Now as I say, I don't know</p>
<p> all of the detail of it but it will be plain from what I've said what</p>
<p> my view is.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>There's impediments. There's a story that you tell of Australia, the</p>
<p> true story, and in the United States which I can speak there is the</p>
<p> myth of Australia which often is very, at least in my experiences</p>
<p> is very false, the myth being a CEO who asks me isn't Australia where</p>
<p> the crocodile, isn't Australia the place where the crocodile guy is</p>
<p> and the home of Crocodile Dundee. So in America even among top business</p>
<p> executives there's a methodology about Australia the last frontier</p>
<p> as they used to say. What kind of marketing is the Government doing</p>
<p> to send the true story of Australia and its economic might to the</p>
<p> rest of the world?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I always find those sorts of questions very hard to answer in</p>
<p> that I don't mind some of that mythology because it's part of the</p>
<p> romance and the, you know use that awful clich the rich tapestry,</p>
<p> and it's not something that you really want to destroy or disabuse</p>
<p> people of, I'm quite certain that a lot of Americans have that mythology.</p>
<p> I think increasing numbers of Americans recognise that that's just</p>
<p> part and its mythology a nice part of it, just as the wild west and</p>
<p> Dodge City and everything is part of the American rich tapestry. I</p>
<p> don't think that is as deeply held by younger Americans. I don't think</p>
<p> that because their access to methods and modes of communication are</p>
<p> so extensive now. We don't have any particular programme to play down</p>
<p> Crocodile Dundee and promote Maurice Newman's outfit, much in all</p>
<p> as it's a noble part of that rich tapestry. We don't but I think that</p>
<p> over time people get a good balance.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Mr Howard I'm just wondering if there is anything to report from your</p>
<p> discussions with General Colin Powell and Ambassador designate Richard</p>
<p> Holbrooke, particularly on the question of Yugoslavia and the aid</p>
<p> workers?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I have talked about our aid workers with everybody I've met of</p>
<p> any influence in this country and the reaction I've had has been genuine</p>
<p> and uniform. There's a desire where they can to help and nobody has</p>
<p> the magic answer. There isn't a magic answer. We have to persuade</p>
<p> the Yugoslav Government to let them go and so far we've not been successful.</p>
<p> That doesn't mean to say we won't be successful but we've got to keep</p>
<p> trying and we are continuing to try in all sorts of ways. I understand</p>
<p> this morning His Holiness has taken up the cause and I appreciate</p>
<p> that very much. And it's consistent with the very strong stance he's</p>
<p> taken on human rights issues effecting the citizens of other countries.</p>
<p> We'll continue at every opportunity to raise it. I raised it with</p>
<p> President Clinton. I raised it with Madeleine Albright. I in fact</p>
<p> spent some quarter of an hour talking to Madeleine Albright about</p>
<p> it at Andrew Peacock's marvellous function last Sunday night. And</p>
<p> we'll just continue to persevere on every front at every occasion.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Mr Prime Minister, Lisa Dodson from Reuters Television. We understand</p>
<p> that Australia has endorsed China's membership to WTO coming alongside</p>
<p> a very contentious lamb ruling by the US. Are we seeing broader trade</p>
<p> tensions between the United States and Australia?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>A broader trade tension?</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>A broader trade tensions and what are the implications of the lamb</p>
<p> ruling for APEC initiatives and I have a follow-up question?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well the American's support China's accession to the WTO. The President</p>
<p> told me on Tuesday that he wanted China in the WTO and he's working</p>
<p> very hard to achieve that and he's made that very plain to the Chinese</p>
<p> administration so there's no difference of opinion on that particular</p>
<p> issue. The lamb ruling what will it do to APEC? The worry I have is</p>
<p> that maybe other countries that are less committed to a more open</p>
<p> trading system will use it as an excuse to be recalcitrant. No perhaps</p>
<p> I'll think of another word. Be difficult. I withdraw it immediately.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>My follow-up question is that historically there has been a parallel</p>
<p> between US Fed moving on interest rates and the RBA. Do you see an</p>
<p> interest rate hike in Australia in the near term?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I don't make comments about the level of interest rates either here,</p>
<p> in Australia or as the Australian Prime Minister here in the United</p>
<p> States.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>You agree with Ted Evans though Prime Minister that if the temporary</p>
<p> blip in inflation caused by the introduction of a GST gets out of</p>
<p> hand that monetary policy would be alive to that possibility.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Glenn, I hope you won't be offended if I invoke my, the question time</p>
<p> convention and that is I never when somebody asks me a question at</p>
<p> question time which quotes somebody else as a matter of precaution</p>
<p> I never accepted that that other person has been correctly quoted</p>
<p> so in other words well I'll. If you want to ask me a question unadorned</p>
<p> by reference to what somebody else has said then I'll be very happy</p>
<p> to answer it. But I'm quite certain that what Mr Evans said this morning</p>
<p> was sound.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>(inaudible).</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>What? You want to ask me an unadorned..</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Can I ask you an unadorned question?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>If there is an inflation blip as a result of the tax changes do you</p>
<p> think it would be appropriate and perhaps necessary at least in the</p>
<p> short term to use interest rates to (inaudible).</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Look Fran I don't talk about interest rates.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister you were high, full of praise for your Labor predecessors</p>
<p> both here and in Georgetown in terms of two issues.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>In relation to a couple of issues - two issues</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Financial deregulation and tariffs.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Where they had strong support from the then Coalition Opposition.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>And secondly you were also full of praise for, or you were pleased</p>
<p> to have Bob Carr here today, are there circumstances or what circumstances</p>
<p> could there be under which in that spirit of bipartisanship you could</p>
<p> have Kim Beazley here to sell a bipartisan message?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I guess the ball is in his court. But you've got to bear in mind</p>
<p> that Mr Beazley in relation to taxation reform, Mr Beazley has behaved</p>
<p> quite differently from how I behaved in relation to financial deregulation,</p>
<p> under the Hawke Government and tariff reform also under the Hawke</p>
<p> Government, although I wasn't Opposition Leader in 1991 when the tariff</p>
<p> reform statement was made but certainly the then opposition took a</p>
<p> very constructive approach under John Hewson's leadership and I was</p>
<p> part of the senior membership of the opposition that participated</p>
<p> in that and I was a very strong supporter I remember of the general</p>
<p> thrust of the tax reforms that Paul Keating was trying to put through</p>
<p> at the summit. Now I'm sure that Mr Beazley would like Australia to</p>
<p> become a world financial centre. Specifically Mr Carr was in New York,</p>
<p> I don't know whether he planned his visit around this or whether it</p>
<p> was a happy coincidence, but look I do hold very strongly to the believe</p>
<p> that as much as possible we should work together when we're abroad.</p>
<p> That doesn't mean to say we won't have our vigorous differences at</p>
<p> home but Mr Carr likes our tax reforms but I don't want to, don't</p>
<p> spoil a pleasant sort of, anything pleasant it's all gone very well</p>
<p> but Mr Beazley has chosen to be particularly negative at the moment</p>
<p> on our tax reforms. I hope he's constructive on capital gains tax</p>
<p> and corporate tax reform and he's got a great opportunity and let</p>
<p> me say Jim that if Mr Beazley wants to join us in the promotion of</p>
<p> Australia as a world financial centre, a way in which he can demonstrate</p>
<p> that commitment and join us is to be constructive and positive in</p>
<p> relation to business tax reform in contra distinction to his negativity</p>
<p> on general tax reform. So the ball is in his court. I mean he can</p>
<p> be part of the future on this or he can try and stop the future happening.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Mr Howard are you disappointed that there are moves within the New</p>
<p> South Wales Liberal Party to undermine Kerry Chikarovski and have</p>
<p> her replaced?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Oh look forget it Jim. I mean I'm not going to talk about a State</p>
<p> political issue. I generally don't talk about State political issues.</p>
<p> Certainly not here.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Mr Howard you've talked about establishing a task force for your push</p>
<p> to establish Sydney as the financial centre. Who's going to head that</p>
<p> taskforce?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well there's a process being gone through. I mean the Ministerial</p>
<p> head of it will be Joe Hockey. I mean he's the public face of it but</p>
<p> we have advertised for somebody to head it up in an executive capacity</p>
<p> and we're going through the selection process.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Mr Howard I was just wondering if you had any indications from CEOs</p>
<p> that you were talking to last night about whether they've got any</p>
<p> plans to locate in Australia?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Look, look it doesn't operate like that.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>I know it's a bit early.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>You don't have dinner with some of these</p>
