    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Commonwealth Government is investing in jobs, innovation and growth across the Geelong region to support its transition from traditional manufacturing to a centre of innovation.</p>
<p>Today, the Government announces that it will base its $14 million Advanced Manufacturing Growth Centre in Geelong.</p>
<p>The Centre will be integrated with a network of centres across the country.</p>
<p>The Centre will develop a sector competitiveness plan to link local businesses with global companies.</p>
<p>The Plan will identify jobs and skills needs, provide a pipeline of innovations ready to commercialise, and consider areas for reforming regulation, manufacturing transformation and growth.</p>
<p>To support skills for the future in the Geelong region, the Government today announces that Newcomb Secondary College will introduce an industry partnership to better prepare students to enter the workforce.</p>
<p>The Commonwealth has committed $500,000 towards establishing the Pathways in Technology Early College High School (P-TECH) model at the College in 2016.</p>
<p>The P-TECH school programme will focus on the jobs of the future in science, technology, engineering and mathematics, partnering with local industry, and providing vocational pathways.</p>
<p>To complement these announcements, a further $1.3 million has been allocated to extend the role of the Geelong Employment Facilitator.</p>
<p>The Government will also establish a new Job Connections Office and Geelong Region Future Jobs Taskforce.</p>
<p>The Geelong Employment Facilitator will continue to assist people affected by Geelongâs economic transition and work to identify and deliver new job opportunities across the Geelong region.</p>
<p>A new local Geelong Region Future Jobs Taskforce will be established to identify and promote job creation opportunities. It will be supported by the Employment Facilitator in a new Job Connections Office housed in the Advanced Manufacturing Growth Centre.</p>
<p>The Employment Facilitator and Geelong Region Future Jobs Taskforce will work closely with the Advanced Manufacturing Growth Centre to identify jobs and the skills needs for the region.</p>
<p>To build on the free trade agreements with China, Korea and Japan, access to Austradeâs export advisory service will be provided through a TradeStart Office in Geelong.</p>
<p>This will give local businesses in the Geelong region access to Austradeâs export advisory services across all sectors, enabling them to access these key export markets for future jobs and growth.</p>
<p>These new measures build on the $15 million investment in the Geelong Region Innovation and Investment Fund.</p>
<p>Geelong is a great city with a great future.</p>
<p>The Commonwealth Government is helping Geelong forge a stronger future.</p>
<p>Our announcements today are all part of our plan to build a strong and prosperous economy for the people of Geelong and Victoria.</p>
