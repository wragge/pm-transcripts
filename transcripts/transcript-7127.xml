TRANSCRIPT OF COMMENTS, PARLIAMENT HOUSE, 23 FEBRUARY 1987I<br />
E0 PROOF-ONLY<br />
JOURNALIST: treating Sir Joh as joke?<br />
PM: No, I don't think anyone treats Joh entirely as a joke.<br />
JOURNALIST: charnce-_ of becoming--Pr-imeMin-ister?<br />
PM: I don't think so but Mr McMullan was quite right in<br />
S looking at a vwhole range of scenarios some of them fanciful<br />
but that The job of the Secretary of the Party, to look<br />
at cevery conceivable scenario. He was quite, right in doing<br />
thac. But fis I said this morning or an earlier program the<br />
real test is will Sir Joh come down and face up to a real<br />
parliament. He doesn't operate in a real parliament there.<br />
He doesn't have any sort authorities within the public<br />
Saccounts type of system that willlook-over' what he says anddoes.<br />
He refuses to have any supervision of that sort which<br />
every other parliament has. I doubt that Joh has got the<br />
guts as I put it to come here and enter a real parliament<br />
where you have to be tested. But I. repeat Sir Joh is not<br />
the real issue at the moment. The real issue is the<br />
temporary Leader of the Opposition Mr Howard, and Mr<br />
Sinclair. And that is who we will be dealingwith while we get<br />
on with running the country.<br />
JOURNALIST: You said Sir Joh is the main game, Sir?<br />
PM: He is the main game in the Opposition side and<br />
ultimately he looks as though he may be the main game. But<br />
what I am saying is that I wish he would come here and play<br />
the game where he can be really tested. The way he is<br />
operating and the way certainly Mr Howard and Mr Sinclair are<br />
operating, they think he is the main game. If he is, let him<br />
come, let's play it.<br />
JOURNALIST: You are not underestimating him at all?*<br />
PM: I just go about the business that I am elected to do<br />
and that is governing the country. And you have this<br />
sideshow going on of what passes for an Opposition and all<br />
the fighting that is going on there. I-can't ignore that--I<br />
have got to have a look at it and try and take it seriously<br />
because it is the only Opposition that there is. Bu-t really<br />
we have got a terribly difficult job of running the country<br />
in the circumstances where, as I say, we have had so much of<br />
our national income wiped off it. _ Every Prime Minister would<br />
like to be in a position where you could be cutting taxes,<br />
where you could be handing out more goodies but that would<br />
be the most disastrous thing that could happen to this<br />
country. There has got to be restraint, pretty tough<br />
