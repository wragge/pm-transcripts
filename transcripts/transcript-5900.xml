PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA WEDNESDAY, 1 SEPTEMBER 1982<br />
ALP PLAN TO BUY UP TO 50% OF BHP STEEL<br />
The Labor Party's suggestion that they would solve<br />
the problems of BHP by putting taxpayers' funds into<br />
the company is an example of socialism at its worst.<br />
Many European steel industries have been destroyed by<br />
government money being put into the corporations. As<br />
a consequence, they have failed to take the decisions<br />
necessary to make the industry efficient and competitive.<br />
Billions of dollars of taxpayers' funds have been lost,<br />
and it is not only the steel industry that has<br />
been uncompetitive, it is other industries that have<br />
had to pay much higher prices for steel, leading to less<br />
employment in downstream industries.<br />
The suggestion that the injection of taxpayers' funds<br />
into BHP would solve the problems of Australia is a<br />
nonsense. It is for the BHP Board to set out the<br />
framework for the future. I have every confidence<br />
that they will be able to do so, and they will do much<br />
better if governments keep their sticky fingers out of<br />
it. Let the Board do its job without the kind of<br />
Government interference that would come from Government<br />
investment in the company.<br />
I hope we will never see the day when Australian boards<br />
and directors would have any inclination to want to<br />
co-operate with that kind of Government intrusion.<br />
Governments have rarely if ever managed business<br />
affairs with high distinction, and the record of<br />
involvement in steel industries overseas is one of<br />
pure and utter disaster. I do not believe any<br />
taxpayers want to see any government investing their<br />
funds in BHP or any other company. </p>
