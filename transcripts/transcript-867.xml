FOR PRESS P. M. No. 23Z196_ 3<br />
The Prime Minister, Sir Robert Menzies, made the<br />
final bid of his campaign at Geelong today when he addressed two<br />
lunch-hour meetings of employees of the Ford works at Geelong.<br />
These two meetings have been a feature of every<br />
election since 1949 when the Minister for Shipping and Transport<br />
won the Corio seat from Labour. He has held it ever since.<br />
Sir Robert Menzies' campaign has taken him into<br />
every State, including two trips each to Queensland and New South<br />
Wdales and four separate visits to Victoria. Accompanied by Dame<br />
Pattie Menzies he has travelled some 10,250 miles in nearly<br />
hours' flying time spread over three weeks.<br />
In that time he has addressed 17 public meetings:<br />
He has written and recorded six 5-minute national broadcasts and<br />
one 15-minute broadcast. He has written and tele-recorded his<br />
policy speech, which was itself a compressed version<br />
of the 7,000 word speech released to the newspapers.<br />
The Prime Minister also prepared personally and<br />
tele-recorded four 15-minute T. V. programmes and five<br />
programmes. Two of his public meetiniwere telecast live<br />
Oakleigh Hall ( Victoria) for 30 minutes and 1-iornsby ( New South<br />
Wales) for 45 minutes.<br />
Apart from his policy speech which was telecast and<br />
broadcast throughout Australia simultaneously in all States,<br />
local broadcasts have been made of a number of his addresses at<br />
public meetings. During the campaign the Prime Minister has also<br />
attended in his official capacity, five functions of a non.<br />
political character and has continued to attend daily to the<br />
urgent business of he Commonwealth Government, dealing with<br />
overseas Embassy reports and a large volume of correspondence.<br />
The Prime Minister will visit polling booths in his<br />
electorate of Kooyong throughout tomorrow. Tomorrow night he<br />
will preside over the St. Andrew's Day dinner of the Melbourne<br />
Scots. He will probably return to Canberra on Monday.<br />
