    <content><![CDATA[<p>McCUE:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, you've spoken to Shane Stone. You've obviously</p>
<p>   seen the television images. How gravely do you regard the situation</p>
<p>   in Katherine?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Very, very much so. I've been in regular touch with the Chief</p>
<p>   Minister. It's a flood the like of which Australia has not</p>
<p>   seen in my living memory. And the damage and the loss of property</p>
<p>   is massive. </p>
<p>I'm on my way to Katherine now because I want to see first-hand</p>
<p>   some of the devastation. I also want, by visiting the people of</p>
<p>   Katherine, to convey directly to them the concern of the rest of</p>
<p>   the Australian public so that they know that their fellow Australians</p>
<p>   are concerned about them, thinking about them and anxious that all</p>
<p>   that can be done will be done to help.</p>
<p>McCUE:</p>
<p>As I understand it, you arrive in Katherine around about 11.00am</p>
<p>   Territory time this morning. What are the plans after that?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I'll be inspecting the area to get a glimpse of the</p>
<p>   extent of the flooding, for myself, and the devastation. I'll</p>
<p>   then be going to a number of the relief centres to talk to people</p>
<p>   whose homes have been destroyed and who've had to be evacuated.</p>
<p>   I'll then take a helicopter journey over the Katherine area</p>
<p>   to get yet another view. And I'll get a detailed briefing from</p>
<p>   all of the relief organisations, the defence personnel, the police</p>
<p>   and so forth. And I want to take this opportunity, as I will in</p>
<p>   Katherine, to thank the defence forces of Australia, to thank the</p>
<p>   Northern Territory Police and all the other emergency services,</p>
<p>   the health workers. It's been a magnificent community effort</p>
<p>   and the Chief Minister has kept me fully informed of all the on-the-ground</p>
<p>   activity. And it's on occasions like this that the Australian</p>
<p>   spirit of mateship and working together to confront adversity really</p>
<p>   comes to the fore.</p>
<p>McCUE:</p>
<p>Given what's happened to Katherine and the people of Katherine</p>
<p>   and surrounds, I guess the one thing that they really need at the</p>
<p>   moment is something to hang on to, some kind of hope. Now, what</p>
<p>   can the Commonwealth promise the people of Katherine?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, the hope that I give them is that the resources of the Commonwealth</p>
<p>   be available to help. I mean, there are automatic provisions that</p>
<p>   have already been triggered concerning the disaster relief arrangements.</p>
<p>   There'll be a couple of other things that I'll be mentioning</p>
<p>   when I get to Katherine that will be of tangible benefit. And the</p>
<p>   Chief Minister and I are talking about what is needed. I just want</p>
<p>   them to understand that all the help that should be made available</p>
<p>   will be made available.</p>
<p>McCUE:</p>
<p>I don't want to be too crude about this, Prime Minister, but</p>
<p>   obviously the one thing that a lot of people, particularly people</p>
<p>   in small business, are going to need in the wake of this crisis</p>
<p>   is some kind of financial assistance to get their businesses back</p>
<p>   up and running. Can you promise anything in that area?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well look, I'll be talking to the Chief Minister and I'll</p>
<p>   be saying certain things when I get to Katherine. I think that's</p>
<p>   the right time for me to be dealing generally or dealing in more</p>
<p>   detail with the sort of things that we can do.</p>
<p>McCUE:</p>
<p>Obviously you'll be able to provide some kind of short-term</p>
<p>   assistance, but will there be longer term assistance for the town?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, as I say, I will be dealing with these things when I get</p>
<p>   to the Territory. I'm on my way to the airport in Adelaide</p>
<p>   and I think the right time for me to talk about those sorts of things</p>
<p>   is when I'm actually in the Territory and when I'm in</p>
<p>   Katherine.</p>
<p>McCUE:</p>
<p>Okay. I won't press the point too much but you've mentioned,</p>
<p>   of course, the defence forces and acknowledged what a fantastic</p>
<p>   job they've done. Is it possible, though, that the Commonwealth</p>
<p>   might be able to provide some kind of personnel, some people to</p>
<p>   actually come to Katherine?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>We will do whatever is necessary. I mean, please, let's not</p>
<p>   argue over something...</p>
<p>McCUE:</p>
<p>I don't want to argue about it, Mr Howard.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well no, let's not disagree when we don't disagree. I've</p>
<p>   already made it clear that the Commonwealth is prepared to provide</p>
<p>   all the help that should be provided in a situation like this and</p>
<p>   we'll do that. Now, I can't be any more explicit than</p>
<p>   that. As to some of the detail, there are certain things that I</p>
<p>   want to mention when I get to Katherine and there'll be other</p>
<p>   things that I'll be discussing with the Chief Minister and</p>
<p>   as a result of that I'll have further things to say. And that</p>
<p>   is the way it should be handled. And I just want your listeners</p>
<p>   to understand that we are absolutely determined to provide all the</p>
<p>   sort of help that ought to be provided in a disaster such as this.</p>
<p>at ought to be provided in a disaster such as this.</p>
