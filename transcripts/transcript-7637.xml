PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 1989-06-14<br />
JOINT STATEMENT FROM THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
AND THE WA ACTING PREMIER, MR PARKER<br />
The Federal and Western Australian Governments have signed an<br />
agreement guaranteeing Commonwealth funding for Western<br />
Australia's public hospital system for the next five years.<br />
For the first time, the Federal Government has agreed to<br />
index the grant not only to take account of general cost<br />
increases but also to reflect ageing and growth of the<br />
State's population.<br />
older people are major users of hospital services and the new<br />
funding arrangements will ensure the grant keeps pace with<br />
the general ageing of the population.<br />
This new formula will give State public hospitals more than<br />
$ 480 million in extra Federal funds over the next five years.<br />
Under the new Medicare hospital agreements, Western Australia<br />
will receive $ 268 million in 1988-89, including $ 775 000<br />
towards the cost of treating AIDS patients and $ 2.1 million<br />
to fund a range of incentives designed to improve further the<br />
efficiency of the public hospital system.<br />
The incentive money will enable the State to develop<br />
innovative approaches to increase the efficiency of public<br />
hospitals, including setting up of both hospital and<br />
community-based services to facilitate early discharge of<br />
post-acute patients and to provide palliative care to reduce<br />
the need for hospitalisation of chronically and terminally<br />
ill patients. Day surgery facilities at a number of public<br />
hospitals will be established or improved.<br />
The new agreement provides proof of Labor's continuing<br />
commitment to the principles of Medicare and reinforces the<br />
right of all patients to hospital treatment according to<br />
medical need.<br />
Both Governments are committed to ensuring that Medicare<br />
patients continue to receive comprehensive, high quality<br />
care. In addition to the already substantial funding<br />
provided by Western Australia, the new Commonwealth grant<br />
will assist the State to maintain the fine record of its<br />
public hospitals. </p>
