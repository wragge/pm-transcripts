21 April 1997 TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
THE HON JOHN HOWARD MP<br />
LAUNCH OF PROSTATE CANCER AWARENESS VIDEO<br />
OLD PARLIAMENT HOUSE, CANBERRA<br />
E O E<br />
Thank you very much Major-General Fittock, to my colleague, Bruce Scott, ladies and<br />
gentlemen. I would like to congratulate the Minister in the Department of Veterans' Affairs, Dr<br />
Andrew Killer and all of the others who've been associated with putting together this<br />
video about prostate health.<br />
It is true that traditionally one of the characteristics of men and Australian men in<br />
particular has been a reluctance to talk about intimate personal things and it's been, in<br />
a sense, a characteristic of the Australian psyche that that has been the case. There are<br />
signs, I believe very welcome signs, that in appropriate cases that attitude is changing.<br />
And the way in which this video which I had the opportunity... I viewed most of it a<br />
few days ago the way in which this video talks about a very important element of<br />
male health is very reassuring. It will be extremely beneficial, not only to the one in<br />
five Australian men over the age of 65 who are returned servicemen, but also to the<br />
rest of the male population of Australia of that particular age cohort and indeed even<br />
younger. Prostate health is something that should be talked about. And just as it has been the<br />
case in relation to particular health issues facing women, they have been the subject of<br />
direct, tasteful, but totally accurate, valuable public discussion without embarrassment<br />
but with enormous benefit and assistance to women in our community, so it is in<br />
relation to issues of particular significance to men within our community. And the<br />
most valuable message that comes out of this video is that the incidence of prostate<br />
disease, whilst a matter of concern, ought not to be something that is feared or not to<br />
be something that can't be encountered, dealt with, and that even in its most severe<br />
form, and that is prostate cancer as the video demonstrates, there is very much life and<br />
a very full life after that. </p>
<p>And I want to especially compliment those in the audience who participated in the<br />
video. Because they've really broken through a communication resistance and barrier<br />
and made an important contribution to an understanding of something which if fully<br />
understood and fully dealt with and openly dealt with is going to greatly improve the<br />
enjoyment of life of a large section of the Australian population. It is true that people<br />
are living longer. It is true that medical science is putting a happy, full, invigorating<br />
life within the reach of increasing numbers of people over the age of 60, 70 and 80 and<br />
so forth. And that process will go on. There's no reason why it shouldn't go on. But<br />
one of the things that will help it go on will be if sensitive issues of health, be it in<br />
relation to women or men in our community, those sensitive issues are addressed in a<br />
very open, frank, unembarrassed but tasteful way. And that is precisely what this<br />
video does. And it is the sort of thing that should occur in relation to all other<br />
incidence of particular health challenges and problems. And the insights, the day-today<br />
advice that the video contains, the personal stories in the video and the reassuring<br />
messages, and most importantly of all, the overwhelmingly reassuring message and that<br />
is that prostate health is just another aspect of the health, is another aspect of caring<br />
for the human body and another aspect of understanding symptoms when they occur,<br />
being sensible enough to do something about them straight away, getting the best<br />
medical advice, understanding as Tony Charlton said in the introduction of the video<br />
understanding that there are a range of treatments available. I think all of that is<br />
something that will benefit not only the returned servicemen within our community, but<br />
of course we're particularly conscious of them in the lead up to Anzac Day, but also<br />
the entire male population particularly, but not only, those over the age of 60 or<br />
So when I was invited by those associated with the video, when I was invited to<br />
participate in this launch, I very readily agreed to do so because I wanted to associate<br />
myself, I wanted to associate my Government with a cause on open, sensible,<br />
recognition of and discussion not only of health issues generally but also of particular<br />
health challenges that effect men in our community. It's a measure of the intelligence<br />
and the sophistication of our community that such issues can be talked about in a<br />
sensible, open, yet completely tasteful and acceptable fashion.<br />
I very genuinely congratulate those associated with the video. We invest as a<br />
community hundreds of millions, indeed, billions of dollars in treating illness, in<br />
treating ailments. We haven't in the past invested either enough resources or enough<br />
personal commitment to prevented health measures and this video makes some<br />
contribution to that. It also makes a contribution to relieving unnecessary anxiety in<br />
our community.<br />
And for all of those reasons I'm delighted to be associated with the launch. I formally<br />
launch it. I congratulate those who put it together. And I especially congratulate and<br />
compliment those men and women who participated in the video because the vivid<br />
examples and stories always make a video like this effective. I wish all of those who<br />
participated well and I congratulate the Department for putting it together.<br />
Thank you. </p>
