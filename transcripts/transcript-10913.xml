    <content><![CDATA[<p>E&amp;OE......................................................................................................................................</p>
<p>Thank you very much Mr Palmer, Mr Chairman, ladies and gentlemen.</p>
<p>   It is my pleasure to welcome the delegates who represent some 34</p>
<p>   different countries to this 15th Asian Regional Conference of Interpol.</p>
<p>   I particularly welcome your President Mr Kanemoto and your Secretary</p>
<p>   General Mr Kendall.</p>
<p>In this the 75th anniversary year of the formation of Interpol</p>
<p>   I record my own personal thanks and those of the Australian people</p>
<p>   for the work that Interpol has done in the cause of worldwide law</p>
<p>   enforcement over that 75 year period.</p>
<p>As you are aware Australia is a long-standing member of Interpol.</p>
<p>   We are very pleased to have played a constructive role in its extensive</p>
<p>   history as an assembly of police organisations promoting police</p>
<p>   co-operation throughout the world. Our support for Interpol remains</p>
<p>   strong and we look forward to its continued development as a first</p>
<p>   class international organisation.</p>
<p>Australia is very grateful for the opportunity of hosting this</p>
<p>   Asian Regional Conference which was last held in my country in 1991.</p>
<p>   In doing so, I pay particular tribute to the Commissioner of the</p>
<p>   Australian Federal Police, Mr Mick Palmer. It is a personal credit</p>
<p>   to you Mr Palmer that this conference is being staged here in Australia.</p>
<p>   It is also to your great credit that you were unanimously elected</p>
<p>   as a delegate for Asia on Interpol's Executive Committee for</p>
<p>   the next three years. Your election to this post is also a credit</p>
<p>   to your force, the Australian Federal Police, and the important</p>
<p>   role that the AFP plays in the fight against crime both in Australia</p>
<p>   and in the region.</p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen, this is an opportunity for me as Prime Minister</p>
<p>   of Australia to address some words of gratitude, very directly,</p>
<p>   to all serving police officers in Australia. I do so conscious of</p>
<p>   the fact that in recent times some police services in this country</p>
<p>   have come under some criticism. And I want, against that background,</p>
<p>   all of the police personnel in Australia to know that the great</p>
<p>   bulk of their fellow Australians deeply appreciate what they do</p>
<p>   to protect our lives and our property. A strong police force based</p>
<p>   on complete integrity is indispensable to the kind of civilised</p>
<p>   society we have here in Australia.</p>
<p>Despite the misdeeds of some who have brought undeserved opprobrium</p>
<p>   on the ranks of their colleagues I know that the overwhelming majority</p>
<p>   of men and women within police ranks in Australia are dedicated,</p>
<p>   hard working, honest Australians who are performing a splendid task</p>
<p>   in contributing to our community. And I take this opportunity on</p>
<p>   this platform, in opening this gathering, to express my personal</p>
<p>   thanks and that of my Government to them and to wish them well in</p>
<p>   their very important work for the goodwill and the benefit of all</p>
<p>   Australians.</p>
<p>By protecting individuals, families and businesses against crime</p>
<p>   police officers protect the national interest. But law enforcement</p>
<p>   agencies protect the national interest in other, perhaps less visible</p>
<p>   ways.</p>
<p>The desirability of a country like Australia as an economic destination</p>
<p>   depends not solely upon the strength of its economic foundations</p>
<p>   but also upon the security of those foundations. Organisations such</p>
<p>   as the Australian Federal Police, the Customs Service, the National</p>
<p>   Crime Authority and the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis</p>
<p>   Centre protect the integrity of data flows, banking infrastructure,</p>
<p>   financial and other telecommunications links. </p>
<p>When this is added to transparency in political decision making,</p>
<p>   law enforcement agencies can contribute to strong business confidence.</p>
<p>I noted in a recent issue of the Far Eastern Economic Review last</p>
<p>   month a survey of business investors which listed Australia as the</p>
<p>   best place to invest in in the region this year. The contribution</p>
<p>   of law enforcement agencies in securing the integrity of our economic</p>
<p>   foundations can only add to this perception. </p>
<p>I understand that at Interpol's 66th general assembly session</p>
<p>   last year your President identified some key areas of focus in the</p>
<p>   fight against transnational crime. He said that regional programmes</p>
<p>   were needed to complement this fight and that greater use of technology</p>
<p>   and telecommunications were also important.</p>
<p>The theme of your conference recognises the importance of regional</p>
<p>   arrangements to ensure the success of global activity. The failure</p>
<p>   to appreciate differences in culture and society often mean that</p>
<p>   some arrangements, while designed for global application, only succeed</p>
<p>   to reflect a regional disposition.</p>
<p>This conference will no doubt consider this issue.</p>
<p>Transnational crime is now a serious security issue which has been</p>
<p>   recognised by Interpol's new observer status at the United</p>
<p>   Nations. But there is only so much that governments can do either</p>
<p>   in isolation or collectively. Treaties may be important but all</p>
<p>   the agreements in the world cannot replace the indispensability</p>
<p>   of co-operation between law enforcement professionals. You, as individual</p>
<p>   police professionals, will always be the most important element</p>
<p>   in defeating international crime.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most tangible demonstration of this co-operation is</p>
<p>   of course your organisation, Interpol.</p>
<p>Crime does not recognise national let alone international boundaries.</p>
<p>   Worse still, criminal activity takes direct advantage of those boundaries.</p>
<p>   In Australia we have identified the need for formal co-operation</p>
<p>   of our law enforcement agencies to cope with this problem. We have</p>
<p>   developed several national organisations including the National</p>
<p>   Crime Authority and others based upon mutual assistance and an extended</p>
<p>   professional police relationship to help overcome difficulties.</p>
<p>The connection between our police agencies in Australia is a strong</p>
<p>   one, exemplified, if in no other way, by the composition of the</p>
<p>   Australian delegation here today.</p>
<p>Internationally the Australian Federal Police now has over 30 officers</p>
<p>   working full time overseas in liaison positions including one attached</p>
<p>   to Interpol.</p>
<p>My Government has a very keen eye to an Australian Federal Police</p>
<p>   force ready to tackle the crimes in an increasingly globalised world</p>
<p>   of the 21st century.</p>
<p>In that context and against that background my Government will</p>
<p>   shortly appoint an independent expert to assess the resourcing needs</p>
<p>   of the Australian Federal Police in the light of a strategic review</p>
<p>   of the challenges facing federal law enforcement.</p>
<p>That person will be required to report within three to four months,</p>
<p>   to ensure that longer term funding for the Australian Federal Police</p>
<p>   is given a sound foundation as soon as possible.</p>
<p>This will result in a new budget charter for the Australian Federal</p>
<p>   Police.</p>
<p>Australia deserves a Commonwealth law enforcement agency that is</p>
<p>   second to none in the world.</p>
<p>A reform process to enable the AFP to develop into such an agency</p>
<p>   is underway, but it will not succeed unless resourcing decisions</p>
<p>   are geared to the vision we have for the AFP.</p>
<p>Last year, my Government commissioned a study by the accountants</p>
<p>   Deloittes to look at AFP resource management practices. Their report</p>
<p>   makes clear that there is a need for additional funds in the short</p>
<p>   term, in particular for accruing superannuation liabilities which</p>
<p>   have been eating into operational funds and of that the Government</p>
<p>   will have more to say shortly. It is also apparent that, for the</p>
<p>   long term, a new process for better linking funding to the Government's</p>
<p>   law enforcement priorities is needed.</p>
<p>For the longer term we have to ensure that the resources we give</p>
<p>   to the AFP will equip it to fight the kind of crime we will face</p>
<p>   in the next century.</p>
<p>My Government will ensure that the AFP is adequately resourced</p>
<p>   to meet the challenges of the 21st century and looks forward to</p>
<p>   receiving the recommendations of the forthcoming strategic review.</p>
<p>I note, Mr Chairman, that the Conference will be discussing the</p>
<p>   scourge of drugs and the threat it presents to the citizens of the</p>
<p>   region and indeed the people of the world. All parents, let alone</p>
<p>   law enforcement officers, understand that the abuse of drugs is</p>
<p>   a very serious issue confronting us all, here in Australia, within</p>
<p>   our region and around the world.</p>
<p>The production and distribution of drugs is increasing across the</p>
<p>   globe. The illicit drug trade is now an international, multi-billion</p>
<p>   dollar enterprise with its undisclosed and untaxed profits rivalled</p>
<p>   by few industries. Estimates of the size of the illicit drug trade</p>
<p>   range from US $300-$500 billion of the United States per annum.</p>
<p>International criminal networks are becoming increasingly sophisticated</p>
<p>   with greater access to the latest technologies for both the concealment</p>
<p>   and smuggling of drugs as well as the proceeds of their crimes.</p>
<p>It should not be forgotten, however, that the drug problem is above</p>
<p>   all a very human one. In this country alone there were 634 heroin</p>
<p>   related deaths in 1996. Illicit drugs are associated with over 40,000</p>
<p>   hospital bed days each year in Australia and spending on illicit</p>
<p>   drugs now amounts to over $7 billion Australian dollars a year.</p>
<p>More than those statistics however, the drug problem is about real</p>
<p>   people with broken lives and broken homes. It's about families</p>
<p>   who want so much to care and face terrible odds in trying to do</p>
<p>   so. It's also about professionals in the field such as law</p>
<p>   enforcement agencies both here and abroad who have vital role to</p>
<p>   play in stemming the tide.</p>
<p>Last year my Government demonstrated its moral leadership on this</p>
<p>   issue by announcing its strategy "Tough on Drugs" - a</p>
<p>   plan which ensures that this very real social problem is one which</p>
<p>   we all have a stake in addressing.</p>
<p>The plan balanced efforts to intercept drug traffickers with fresh</p>
<p>   and additional resources for education, treatment and research.</p>
<p>We are committed to a rigorous school education campaign aimed</p>
<p>   at zero tolerance for drugs.</p>
<p>From young people who have been targeted by drug dealers to their</p>
<p>   families who have had to rebuild shattered lives - drugs have a</p>
<p>   devastating affect on them all.</p>
<p>Tough on Drugs is an integrated and comprehensive national effort.</p>
<p>   It combats the drug barons with $43 million additional resources</p>
<p>   to intercept illicit drugs at our borders and within Australia.</p>
<p>It provides an additional $14 million to warn our young people</p>
<p>   and the wider community about the extreme danger of illicit drugs.</p>
<p>And it responds to those with special needs - the drug users with</p>
<p>   almost $30 million to support front line professionals such as doctors</p>
<p>   and hospital staff, counsellors, researchers and new non-government</p>
<p>   treatment facilities.</p>
<p>Law enforcement against drug crimes must also respond to the challenges</p>
<p>   of the latest technologies. Our funding of a National Heroin Signature</p>
<p>   Programme to identify the trafficking patterns of heroin is therefore</p>
<p>   important as are funds to improve research into drug-crime links.</p>
<p>   We have also enhanced the Australians Transaction Reports and Analysis</p>
<p>   Centre's capacity to monitor suspicious financial transactions</p>
<p>   and add to a sophisticated armoury targeted against dug traffickers.</p>
<p>I know from my discussions with Mr Palmer that Interpol will play</p>
<p>   a vital role in the wider regional context is supporting our own</p>
<p>   police forces and other law enforcement agencies as we strengthen</p>
<p>   the fight against drug trafficking.</p>
<p>Just as the Government has acted upon the impact of drugs on the</p>
<p>   lives of Australians so too has it worked to reform gun laws in</p>
<p>   this country. I note that you will be discussing the subject of</p>
<p>   firearms regulations during the course of your deliberations.</p>
<p>This is a subject of which Australia is sadly now very familiar.</p>
<p>   Almost two years ago in an otherwise tranquil corner of Australia</p>
<p>   there was a tragic event where a lone gunman took the lives of 35</p>
<p>   innocent people at the barrel of a semi-automatic weapon. That our</p>
<p>   freedom from such an awful crime could be so cruelly shattered touched</p>
<p>   every Australian and reverberated throughout the world.</p>
<p>It also generated a timely, yet measured response which was supported</p>
<p>   by all major political parties across the Australian spectrum and</p>
<p>   by the overwhelming bulk of the Australian community. The agreement</p>
<p>   of Australian Police Ministers brought about national crime prevention</p>
<p>   legislation which outlawed semi-automatic weapons. </p>
<p>We acted in a lasting, effective and unified way after proper negotiations</p>
<p>   with all sections of the Australian community. </p>
<p>All Australian Parliaments successfully passed complementary legislation</p>
<p>   banning ownership of these weapons, except in the most limited and</p>
<p>   understandable of cases. Our year long national gun amnesty and</p>
<p>   buy back scheme saw over 640,000 firearms surrendered for their</p>
<p>   genuine value totalling almost $315 million. All of those firearms</p>
<p>   with the very few exceptions for museum and police use were then</p>
<p>   destroyed.</p>
<p>Taking such a strong stand was unpopular in some quarters but demonstrated</p>
<p>   the Government's determination to fight crime.</p>
<p>The protection and security of a nation's citizens is not</p>
<p>   only the first responsibility of government but also one of its</p>
<p>   most noble.</p>
<p>It is a duty which has become even more onerous as criminals benefit</p>
<p>   from the growth in the global economy, larger trading volumes, advances</p>
<p>   in technology and electronic commerce and easier international travel.</p>
<p>It is a duty which no doubt will motivate much of your deliberations</p>
<p>   this week. And I want you to know that your deliberations will take</p>
<p>   place against the background of an assurance from me as the Prime</p>
<p>   Minister of Australia, that the role of law enforcement agencies</p>
<p>   in this country, be it the police services or other agencies, is</p>
<p>   deeply admired, is gratefully acknowledged and will always have</p>
<p>   our warm and continuing support. With that in mind, I have great</p>
<p>   pleasure in declaring open this 15th Interpol Asian Regional Conference.</p>
<p>   Thank you.</p>
