    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Government will build on Australia's successful record as a knowledge-based and innovative society by drawing on the Australian Science Capability Review and the recommendations of the Innovation Summit Implementation Group.</p>
<p>Today's meeting of the Prime Minister's Science, Engineering and Innovation Council (PMSEIC) received an interim report on the Australian Science Capability Review from the Chief Scientist Dr Robin Batterham.</p>
<p>It outlined priority areas including increased private investment in innovation, training initiatives and improved public confidence in the benefits of science and technology.</p>
<p>In particular it emphasised the need to provide effective connections between new ideas and the commercial entities that can translate those ideas into improved products and processes.</p>
<p>In this year's Budget, the Government increased its already strong commitment to science and innovation by providing a record $4.5 billion for major science and innovation programmes in 2000/2001, an increase of $167 million or 1.1 per cent in real terms.</p>
<p>The Council was briefed by Dr Chris Nicol of Bell Lab Innovations on microelectronics research. Bell Labs is establishing a privately funded microelectronics research facility in Sydney worth about $25 million over five years.</p>
<p>In addition, two outstanding examples of practical application of Australian innovation were presented to the Council today. The Minister for Justice and Customs, Senator Amanda Vanstone, demonstrated rapid facial imaging technology, which will assist law enforcement agencies across Australia.</p>
<p>The Director of the Australian Film Television and Radio School, Mr Rod Bishop, outlined the film industry's use of on-line digital technologies for editing and special effects. These examples demonstrate the broad range of innovation under development in Australia and showcase Australia's ability to lead the way in new applications of technology.</p>
