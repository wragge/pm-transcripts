MAYORAL DINNER, KEW, VICTORIA<br />
O3TH MAY. 1964<br />
Speech by the Prime Minister, the Rt. Hon. Sir Robert Menzies<br />
Mr. Mayor, Councillor Ryan and Parliamentary Colleagues and<br />
Ladies and Gentlemen You know, these toasts to Parliament are always<br />
dubious affairs never more dubious than tonight. Here's this<br />
wretched fellow, O'Brien ( Laughter) who has masqueraded for many<br />
years as a friend of mine; he sandwiches me between himself and<br />
Arthur Rylah who speaks after me. This, I venture to say, is a<br />
dirty football trick ( Laughter), characteristic of the Tigers.<br />
( Laughter). Oh, you neednet be too perky about this. I've seen<br />
a few odd things done by Hawthorn, but still,. o.... You noticed,<br />
though didn't you, that in the middle of a good deal of propaganda<br />
against the Commonwealth, to which I am accustcmed, he came back,<br />
time after time, to his real grievance which is that Geelong were<br />
able to buy a player from West Australia and that now some other<br />
team I don't know which is subject to the Coulter Law, and<br />
is going to buy another player, but his team, the Tigers have<br />
fallen so far in public and footballing esteem they couldntt afford<br />
to buy half a rover, That this is the thing that works in his<br />
wain was quite obvious tonight because in the middle of a bit of<br />
high-falutin' about Western Australia and so on, he kept coming<br />
back to the real substance of his grievance. Now all I can tell<br />
you, Sir, is that my team this afternoon won its second match for<br />
the year by one point ( Laughter, applause) and this delighted me<br />
while at the same time faintly surprising me,<br />
Now I will resist this temptation to instruct<br />
my young friend there, OBrien.... I must interrupt myself. I have<br />
a Secretary who gives me a not-e when something is going to happen<br />
and when they referred to him they had in brackets after his<br />
name " solicitor". How right they were, ( Laughter) But I am<br />
accustomed to this. If I gc to the Melbourne Town Hall somebody<br />
gets up and makes a pcwerful speech about the injustice to Victoria<br />
and my only comfort is that when I am in Sydney which I am, not<br />
infrequently, earnest-looking men of high status in the community<br />
say, " You know, it's a terrible thing the way this Government of<br />
yours is run by the Victorians. Why dont we have more men from<br />
Sydney in the Government?" and I have to say to them, " Well, why<br />
don't you send them in?" so I am not unaccustomed to this.<br />
But I have been very interested tonight because<br />
here I am sitting with two people on my right who are members for<br />
the East Yarra province and nobody among you except the very<br />
venerable, like Bill Dickinson, will remember that I was once the<br />
member for East Yarra, and by Jove I know more about how I became<br />
the member for East Yarra than most of you will ever know because<br />
I stood for East Yarra in a frolicsome moment, being then a<br />
barrister with a good deal of business, and in those days nobody<br />
had a party nomination you just nominated yourself and you went<br />
around and you prayed that you might get a few supporters. Of<br />
course, rightly or wrongly the great men of the Victorian<br />
Government have now made, I believe, voting compulsory, but in<br />
those days it was voluntary. About 14,000 votes were cast in an<br />
electorate of 90 000 and therefore you had to go out and see<br />
whether you could pick up enough of them to win.<br />
Now, I an told there are no press here and<br />
therefore I can admit to the most brutal violation of the<br />
electoral laws because when I stood, I had to get somebody, a<br />
/ 2 </p>
<p>2-<br />
great friend of mine, to act as my secretary, and then we engaged<br />
one or two gentlemen in different corners of the electorate to go<br />
around and do a bit of canvassing. They were paid practically<br />
per capita. ( Laughter) I had 56 meetings, the largest of which<br />
at the Hawthorn Town Hall, was 56 people and the smallest of which,<br />
at Glen Iris, was four, two of whom were on my staff. ( Laughter)<br />
That little escapade quite unsuccessful as it turned out<br />
because a relative of his defeated me by 2 to 1, cost me œ 1,200.<br />
Oh, these were the days.<br />
Then, some months later, there was a byelection<br />
and I stood again, and being a little browned-off after 56<br />
meetings and four people including the staff, I decided I would<br />
have 8 meetings. My entire campaign cost me œ 90 and I won by<br />
2 to 1. Now there may be a lesson in this. I don't undertake<br />
to say what it is, but that's how it happened and that's how I<br />
became the member for East Yarra. Thirteen months later I left,<br />
voluntarily, and stood for the Lower House, After that, all my<br />
troubles began. Really, Dick, when I look back on the Upper House,<br />
my thirteen months there, it was wonderfulo Peace, perfect<br />
peace in this dark world of sin. ( Laughter) It was absolutely<br />
marvellous. It was only when I stepped across to King's Hall<br />
and had a look at my colleagues in the Lower House being battered<br />
from pillar to post, the conscience stirred in me, so I left the<br />
Upper House and went into the Lower House and ever sinco then,<br />
I have been in one kind of trouble or another, All except one.<br />
This I always think about when I come out into my own place and<br />
among my own people. You know, the electorate of Kooyong.....<br />
No doubt I have said this to you before, but I'll say it again.....<br />
the electorate of Kooyong is one of the few in the Federal<br />
Parliament that still retains its own nameo There has been a<br />
Kooyong seat since 1901 and in the whole of that time, they have<br />
had four members represent them,<br />
The first was Knox who was the memuer for Kooyong<br />
until about 1909 or something of that kind; the second was Sir<br />
Robert Best who was always, when his party,. my party, was in<br />
office, a Minister; the third was John Latham who represented<br />
Kooyong with immense distinction for twelve years and was a<br />
Minister at all relevant times and Deputy Prime Minister.<br />
In 1934, I went up to become Attorney-General, member for Kooyong,<br />
and I had a simple ambition at that time that I might be undetected<br />
long enough to he member for Kooyong for twelve years which seemed<br />
to be the ruling rate, and as you all now to your sorrow, I've been<br />
member for Kooyong now for thirty years. ( Applause)<br />
The one point I want to make is that in the case<br />
of Best, Latham, Menzies, Kooyong was always represented by a<br />
Minister, except when the other party was in power. In short,<br />
Kooyong has the greatest record of any electorate in Australia<br />
in insisting upon being represented by people who, rightly or<br />
wrongly, achieved some status in the political life of the country.<br />
All I want to say to you is I hope that will long continue.<br />
( Applause) I don't mean by that that I hope I will long continue.<br />
I have that philosophic state of mind now, that state of euphoria<br />
which proceeds from the certain knowledge that whatever else<br />
happens, I'm a certainty for a State funeral.( Laughter) I really<br />
don't want to have a State funeral while I am still in Parliament<br />
if that's the right way to put it I d rather like some day to<br />
have a few years of private life. Private life is a tremendously<br />
precious thing. A lot of you chaps don't realise that the<br />
greatest sacrifice that a man makes who is heavily and continually<br />
immersed in politics is that he loses his private life. It would<br />
be fun, wouldn't it, to have a bit some day, but in the meantime,<br />
0* a ao/ 3 </p>
<p>-3-<br />
what I want to say to Kcoyong and Kew is the very heart of itI is<br />
that I hope the standards will be kept high and that some successor<br />
of mine will someday be able to stand here and be spoken about by<br />
a successor of young O'Brien, if such a thing is conceivable<br />
( Laughter) and be attacked for being a better Australian than he<br />
is a Victorian. ( Laughter)<br />
Well, I ought to say no more about that, I'm sure, but<br />
before I sit duwn, I want to say this to you. It's quite true,<br />
all these arguments go on; it's quite true that in a Federal<br />
system there will always be the most intricate problems. You<br />
can't treat every State the same, if you are dealing with a<br />
country in which there ib an insistent demand for development<br />
here or there or there. Of course youean't and nobody really<br />
pretends that you can. Nobody from Victoria, no representative<br />
of the Government of Victoria ever pretends for a moment that there<br />
ought to be no more per capita spent in West Australia than<br />
there is in Victoria. I've never heard it said. There is, of<br />
course, an entirely inteliigible arguaent all the time as to<br />
whether this doesn't go too far, whether perhaps a little adjustment<br />
ought to be made, but what we must realise here is that we<br />
do live in a Federal commvonixy and thac we live in a very great<br />
continent, a tremendous continent, roughly the size of the United<br />
States of America, ai. d that if this is in due course, as I believe<br />
it will be, a great conntry and indeed a great power, then we<br />
must not be too loca. in our vision. We must see the continent<br />
as a whole ana do what we ui for the continent as a whole.<br />
This, I am perfectly ctrtain. xepresernts the views of most<br />
Australians who look outside CJhieir own bsckyard and who see this<br />
place from Sydney to Porth from Hobart to Daiwino It's a tremendous<br />
thing. Now, I'm going off once more, and it's no joyride,<br />
in a fortnight s time to attend. a Prire Ministers' Conference in<br />
London, but before I do that, I am going to the United States so<br />
that I may have some r3al taiks with the new President of the<br />
United States '* rhom I have met, of course, but whom I don't k1iow<br />
as well as I kneu the late PresidenG Kennedy, This is tremerdously<br />
important -chat we and the United States we, relatively small,<br />
the United States vastly great should undei. stand each cther<br />
not just with that after-dirner backø-slapping quality which is<br />
so easy, but in true terms, speaking to each other as man to man,<br />
country to country. This is ' f tremnendous significance. Indeed,<br />
Sir, it is of vital significance to Australia and to Australia's<br />
future. Therefore this is one of the number one tasks that I must<br />
undertake. Then we are going to have a Prime Ministers' Conference.<br />
Well, I first attended a Prime Ministers' Conference when I was<br />
not a Prime Minister. You may say that's rather characteristic of<br />
me, horning in, but the fact was that in 1935 there was a<br />
Conference, and Mr. Lyons was then Prime Minister and he was ill<br />
and he said to me, being also in London, would I go along and<br />
represent him. I'll never forget it, at No. 10 Downing Street,<br />
Ramsay MacDonald was the Prime Minister. George Forbes was the<br />
Prime Minister of New Zealand, or as Ramsay called him, Forrbis.<br />
Talk about Sassenachs. ( Laughter) Hertzog was there from South<br />
Africa. I think that year Bennett was theie fbr Canada. Five of<br />
us. We all spoke the same language, not only literally, but we<br />
all felt rather the same way about the world's problems. It was<br />
quite possible at that time to come out of a meeting adn say, " Here<br />
is a joint view that represents the view of the British Commonwealth."<br />
Now today, all this is gone. South Africa is out.<br />
We have about twelve or thirteen new countries in the Commonwealth,<br />
half a dozen of whom know nothing about democracy but have<br />
dictators of their own, 4 4, </p>
<p>It's no longer possible to sit there and talk as<br />
we could even ten years ago about all the great things that we<br />
have in common, the sense of democratic parliamentary existence,<br />
the sense of equality before the law, the impeccability of the<br />
law, these great traditions which still work I am happy to say,<br />
in what I choose to call the Crown members ol the Commonwealth.<br />
But today you have all sorts, an infinite variety from Makarios<br />
in Cyprus and N1k'umah in Ghana through Ababaka Bulewa in Nigeria,<br />
who is a great man who understands all thesa things to perfection,<br />
down to Tanganyika with a frightfully good man like Nyerere and<br />
Zanzibar which is, for all practical purposes, a communist<br />
protectorate, but which is now engaged in some rather tenuous<br />
alliance with Tanganyika,<br />
I don't need to go right through the list the fact<br />
is that we now present a group of people of almost infinite variety<br />
and the last time I attended one of these meetings at Marlborough<br />
House, no longer at No. 10 because it was too small, it was<br />
staggering to see what quarrels could emerge between two new<br />
members of the Commonwealth about matters which you and I would<br />
regard as the commonplaces of' political life. In other words,<br />
we now have a new and turbulant Commonwealth, quite diffferent; all<br />
the old unifying elements in the case of half a dozen of us have<br />
been weakened and th4. s Conference is going to determine, I believe,<br />
whether a structure so made can, long continue or whether, if it<br />
continues, it could continue except by laying down certain<br />
principles of life and of unde~ rstanding which will be the true'<br />
condition of membership,, Don't any o2 you envy me going to this Conference,<br />
This will be, as I am perfectly certain, one of the crucial<br />
conferences in the enti4-re history of the Commonweal. th. A:. 1 I can<br />
say is that I will do my best. I have lived long enough to have<br />
got over the habits of dogmatism. I know thai;' certaiii things<br />
that seem to re to be inevitably right will not be so regarded by<br />
other people and we must learn to live together., In fact, Mr.<br />
Mayor, the whc-. 1,3 essence of your delightful party tonighv' is that<br />
we are all here living togeth-r. W,, e don't need to learn to live<br />
tog~ ther but there are hundreds of millions cf people in the<br />
world with whom -we will have to learn to live together, and this is<br />
not easy. This calls for immenise tolerance, for great patience,<br />
for the most genuine attempts at understanding. Facing that kind<br />
of probhlem as I do i~ n the next six weeks, I beg of you to be<br />
excused from conducting an argument on another matter with a man<br />
who i~ s a close and valued friend of mine., He can save it until<br />
next yaar. </p>
