SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
THE HON. E. G. WHITLAM, M. P.,<br />
A DINNER OF THE AUSTRALIAN-FARMERS' FEDERATION<br />
HOTEL CANBERRA, TUESDAY 23 OCTOBER 1973<br />
I WELCOME THIS OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS ONE OF THE<br />
LARGEST, MOST REPRESENTATIVE AND MOST RESPECTED PRIMARY<br />
PRODUCERS'I ORGANISATIONS IN THIS COUNTRY.<br />
ONE OF THE SIGNAL FEATURES OF YOUR FEDERATION<br />
AND I FIND IT SPECIFIED IN YOUR CONSTITUTION IS YOUR<br />
POLICY OF POLITICAL NEUTRALITY. YOU ARE AFFILIATED WITH<br />
NO POLITICAL PARTY OR SECTIONAL INTEREST. I GIVE YOU CREDIT<br />
FOR RECOGNISING THAT THE TRUE INTFRESTS OF THE PRTMARY<br />
PRODUCER ARE NOT NECESSARILY SERVED BY THE POLITTCAL FORCES<br />
MOST VOCAL, MOST STRIDENT, IN YOUR SUPPORT. Yotj KNOW IT<br />
IS OFTEN SAID THAT WE IN THE LABOR PARTY ARE HOSTILE TO<br />
THE RURAL COMMUNITY: THAT LABOR IS A CITY-8AS~ F) PARTY<br />
DANCING TO THE TUNE OF POWER-HUNGRY UNIONS.<br />
THE FACT IS THAT LABOR IS NEITHER AN' URBAN NOR A RURAL<br />
PARTY, BUT A NATIONAL PARTY. WE ARE A NATITONAL GOVERNMENT,<br />
GUIDED BY NATIONAL CONSIDERATIONS, AND DETERMINED TO<br />
PRODUCE A MORE OPEN, MORE EQUAL, MORE TOLERANT AND MORE<br />
PROSPEROUS SOCIETv THAN WE INHERITED FROM OUR PR[ DFCESS: ORS.<br />
I WANT TO CONVINCE YOU THAT JUST AS THE GOVERNMENT'S INTERESTS<br />
ARE NATIONAL INTERESTS, SO YOUR INTERESTS, THE FARMERS'I INTERESTS,<br />
DEPEND IN THE ULTIMATE ON A BROAD PERCEPTION OF THE NATIONAL GOOD,<br />
.1./ 2 </p>
<p>-2AHAS<br />
ANY COUNTRY, ANY STATE, EVER PROSPERED THROUGH A<br />
CONCENTRATION ON ONLY ONE SECTOR OF ITS PEOPLE OR INDUSTRY?<br />
WE USED TO BE OVERWHELMINGLY A PASTORAL ECONOMY; WE ARE A<br />
GREATER NATION TODAY BECAUSE OUR ECONOMY IS MIXED AND DIVERSIFIED.<br />
AND YOU, THE FARMERS, LIKE ALL AUS! TRALIANS, HAVE BENEFITED FROM<br />
THIS GREATER STRENGTH AND DIVERSITYi YOU CAN SEE THIS BY LOOKING<br />
AT THE RURAL ECONOMY ITSELF. YOU ARE LESS DEPENDENT ON THE<br />
RANDOM FORTUNES OF ONE COMMODITY WOOL. MANY A PASTORALIST<br />
HAS BEEN SAVED BY THE BUOYANCY OF THE CATTLE MARKET OR ONE OF<br />
OUR GRAIN MARKETS. TO ADAPT A FAMILIAR PHASE, WHAT IS GOOD<br />
FOR PRIMARY INDUSTRY IS GOOD FOR THE COUNTRY.<br />
I CONFESS THAT NOTHING EXASPERATES ME MORE THAN THIS<br />
BASELESS ACCUSATION THAT LABOR IS AN ANTI-RURAL PARTY. THE<br />
LABOR GOVERNMENT RECONGISES THE GREAT CONTRIBUTION MADE BY THE<br />
RURAL SECTOR TO THE NATIONAL ECONOMY AS A PROVIDER OF FOOD<br />
FOR OUR GROWING POPULATION, AS A PROVIDER OF LARGE EXPORT<br />
SURPLUSES EARNING VALUABLE FOREIGN EXHANGE. RURAL EXPORTS<br />
LAST YEAR ACCOUNTED FOR MORE THAN 50% OF THE VALUE OF OUR EXPORT<br />
EARNINGS, DESPITE THE RISING CONTRIBUTION OF MANUFACTURED GOODS<br />
AND MINERALS TO * THE TRADE BALANCE. ALTHOUGH THE RURA[<br />
POPULATION HAS DECLINED SUBSTANTIALLY IN THE POST-WAR PERIOD$<br />
WITH A LARGE DROP IN THE FARM WORKFORCE, THE PRODUCTIVITY OF<br />
AUSTRALIAN FARMERS HAS EASILY OFFSET THIS TREND. THROUGH<br />
GREATER INVESTMENT IN MACHINERY AND FERTILISERS1 PRODUCTION HAS<br />
CONTINUED TO EXPAND EXCEPT IN YEARS OF DROUGHT, So AUSTRALIAN<br />
FARMERS ARE EFFICIENT FARMERS, AUSTRALIA'S REPUTATION~ ABROAD,<br />
AS A TRADER IN PRIMARY PRODUCTS, IS HIGH. DOES ANYONE SERIOUSLY<br />
BELIEVE THAT WE IN THE LABOR PARTY CAN BE INDIFFERENT OR HOSTILE<br />
TO AN INDUSTRY AS VAST, AS EFFICIENT, AS PRODUCTIVE, AS ESSENTIAL<br />
AS YOURS? </p>
<p>IF WE LOOK BACK ON THE HISTORY OF PRIMAR'. INDUST-T<br />
IN THIS COUNTRY, WE SEE ONE OUTSTANDING FEATURE. I PUT IT<br />
TO YOU THAT TI. CHIEF CHARACTERISTI OF YOUR INDLSTRY,<br />
WHATEVER GOVERNMENT IS IN POWER, IS. ITS VULNERABILITY, IORE<br />
THAN ANY OTHER SECTOR OF THE ECONOMY YOU ARE SUBJECT TO<br />
UNPREDICTABLE AND IMPONDERABLE CIRCUMSTANCES. YOU ARE AT<br />
THE MERCY OF THE SEASONS, AT THE MERCY OF WORLD CURRENCY<br />
REALIGNMENTS, OF FLUCTUATING INTFRI'ATIONAL MARKETS, GLUTS<br />
AND SHORTAGES. CAN YOU HONESTLY SAY THAT THE POLICIES<br />
PURSUED DURING 23 YEARS OF GOVERNMENT BY OUR OPPONENTS<br />
BY YOUR SELF-PROCLAIMED POLITICAL ALLIES HAVE REMOVED<br />
YOUR FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEMS OR GUARANTEED YOU ANY PERMANENT<br />
SECURITY AND PROSPERITY?<br />
JUST THREE YEARS AGO, YOU WILL REMEMBER, FARM INCOMES<br />
IN THIS COUNTRY WERE THE LOWEST IN TERMS OF PURCHASING POWER<br />
SINCE 1944, WHEN DROUGHT AND WAR-TIME CONDITIONS PRODUCED<br />
A QUITE DRASTIC RURAL RECESSION. No GOVERNMEN1, OF COURSE,<br />
AN GUARANTEE YOU IMMUNITY TO ACTS OF2 GoD OR TO INTERNATIONAL<br />
DEVELOPMENTS BEYOND OUR CONTROl.., I MERELY SIIGGEST " HAT<br />
PAST GOVERNMENT POLICIES TOWARDS RURAL INDUSTRY HAVE 4OT<br />
SOLVED YOUR UNDERLYING PROBLEMS, AND IN KANY CASES HAVE SERVED<br />
TO PERPETUATE THEM. 1 1/ 4 </p>
<p>-4-<br />
I GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE, IN THE LAST 30 YEARS,<br />
GOVERNMENTS HAVE POURED SOME $ 77 " MILLION INTO THE DAIRY<br />
INDUSTRY BY WAY OF BOUNTIES, -THESE BOUNTIES HAVE DONE<br />
NOTHING TO SOLVE THE INDUSTRY'S MAdOR PROBLEM THE ADJUSTMENT<br />
OF FARM PRODUCTION LEVELS TO REALISTIC LOCAL AND OVERSEAS<br />
DEMAND, BY FAVOURING THE WEALTHIER PRODUCER AND THE RICHER<br />
DAIRYING STATES, THEY HAVE DONE LITTLE TO IMPROVE THE LOT<br />
OF SMALL DAIRY FARMERS, MANY OF WHOM ARE REPRESENTED IN<br />
YOUR FEDERATION, THIRTEEN YEARS AGO, AN INDEPENDENT<br />
COMMITTEE APPOINTED BY OUR PREDECESSORS UNANIMOUSLY<br />
RECOMMENDED THE ABOLITION OF THE DAIRY SUBSIDY, THAT<br />
RECOMMENDATION WAS IGNORED, WHAT BETTER TIME TO PHASE OUT<br />
THIS SUBSIDY THAN NOW, WHEN RETURNS IN THE MAJOR ALTERNATIVE<br />
ENTERPRISE THAT OF BEEF PRODUCTION ARE AT RECORD LEVELS,<br />
AND WHEN THE LONG-TERM PROSPECTS IN THAT INDUSTRY ARE<br />
REGARDED AS HIGHLY PROMISING? DON'T FORGET THAT IN<br />
CONSULTATION WITH. THE INDUSTRY AND STATE AUTHORITIES, WE ARE<br />
EXAMINING THE BEST MEANS OF PROVIDING RE-ADJUSTMENT<br />
ASSISTANCE WHILE THE BOUNTIES ARE PHASED OUT,<br />
I GIVE YOU ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF UNFAIR AND<br />
SELF-DEFEATING CONCESSIONS TO THE RURAL SECTOR, IN THE<br />
BUDGET THIS YEAR WE LOOKED CRITICALLY AT A NUMBER OF TAX<br />
CONCESSIONS RECEIVED BY FARMERS, WE FOUND THAT THESE<br />
CONCESSIONS MADE LITTLE REAL SENSE FROM YOUR LONG-TERM<br />
POINT OF VIE1W, OR FROM THE COMMUNITY'S POINi: OF VIEW, </p>
<p>I REMIND YOU THAT A CONCESSION TO ONE GROUP OF 1AXPAYERS CAN<br />
BE MADE ONLY AT THE EXPENSE OF TAXPAYERS GENERALLY; IT IS<br />
GOOD GOVERNMENT PRACTICE TO LOOK AT THESE THINGS CRITICALLY<br />
t<br />
FROM TIME TO TIME, WE FOUND THAT SOME TAX CONCESSIONS<br />
FARMERS WERE RECEIVING WERE DESIGNED TO ENCOURAGE FARM<br />
INVESTMENT, THEY WERE INTRODUCED, IN THE MAIN, IN THE<br />
DECADE AFTER WORLD WAR II WHEN AUSTRALIA WAS CRITICALLY SHORT<br />
OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE RESERVES AND WHEN THERE WAS AN URGENT<br />
NATIONAL NEED TO EXPAND EXPORTS, CONDITIONS HAVE, OF COURSE,<br />
CHANGED DRAMATICALLY SINCE THEN, OUR EXPORT INCOMES ARE<br />
HIGH AND RISING; OUR INTERNATIONAL RESERVES ARE NEAR RECORD<br />
LEVELS LEVELS UNDREAMT OF 3 OR 4 YEARS AGO. IN THESE<br />
VASTLY ALTERED CIRCUMSTANCES, ARTIFICIAL BOOSTS TO FARM<br />
INVESTMENT AND EXPORT PRODUCTION MAKE, QUITE SIMPLY, LITTLE<br />
OR NO ECONOMIC SENSE, THIS DOES NOT MEAN THAT WE CAN IGNORE<br />
THE VITAL IMPORTANCE OF ECONOMICALLY HEALTHY AND EFFICIENT<br />
INDUSTRIES, IT SIMPLY MEANS THAT IT NO LONGER PAYS US AS<br />
A NATION TO DEVELOP FARMS MORE RAPIDLY THAN IT WOULD PAY YOU<br />
YOURSELVES TO DEVELOP THEM,<br />
IN THIS CONTEXT, IT IS IMPORTANT TO CONSIDER THE<br />
CURRENT HEALTH OF THE RURAL SECTOR, WORLD DEMAND HAS<br />
INCREASED SHARPLY FOR MOST OF AUSTRALIA'S EXPORT COMMODITIES,<br />
ESPECIALLY WOOL AND MEAT, THE BUREAU OF AGRICULTURAL<br />
ECONOMICS HAS ESTIMATED NET FARM INCOME IN 1972-73 AT A<br />
RECORD LEVEL OF $ 1,880 MILLION, A RISE OF $ 744 MILLION OVER<br />
THE YEAR BEFORE, PRELIMINARY ESTIMATES FOR 1973-74 SHOW A<br />
NET FARM INCOME OF $ 2,865 MILLION, UP 52% OF 1972-73, ,/ 6 </p>
<p>-6-<br />
THE BUREAU'S PRELIMINARY ESTIMATE OF THE GROSS VALUE OF<br />
RURAL PRODUCTION IN 1973-74 IS A" MASSIVE FIGURE OF $ 6,110<br />
MILLION MORE THAN $ 1,000 MILLION GREATER THAN THE PAST<br />
YEAR, AT THE SAME TIME THE RATE O'INCREASE IN RURAL DEBTS<br />
IS SLACKENING OFF, AND FARMERS ARE REPAYING THEIR EXISTING<br />
DEBTS MORE QUICKLY. HIGHER FARM INCOMES HAVE ENABLED MANY<br />
FARMERS TO REPAY THEIR DEBTS; AND THIS, COMBINED WITH<br />
BUOYANT AND RISING PRICES, HAS MADE THE FARMING COMMUNITY<br />
MORE PROSPEROUS TODAY THAN AT ANY TIME SINCE WORLD WAR II,<br />
Now I DON'T WANT TO MAKE TOO MUCH OF THIS. IN MANY<br />
WAYS IT IS FORTUITOUS, JUST AS YOUR RECENT RECESSION WAS<br />
FORTUITOUS; AND AS I HAVE ARGUED ALREADY, THE INHERENT<br />
CHARACTERISTIC OF YOUR INDUSTRY IS ITS PATTERN OF INSTABILITY,<br />
I SUGGEST, HOWEVER, THAT YOUR CURRENT OVERALL PROSPERITY<br />
PRESENTS A GOOD OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE FARMING MORE OF A<br />
COMMERCIAL ENTERPRISE, MORE VIABLE, MORE EFFICIENT, MORE<br />
SECURE, MORE FLEXIBLE AND RESPONSIVE TO MARKET TRENDS, WE<br />
ARE OPPOSED TO OPEN-ENDED COMMITMENTS WHICH PLACE NO LIMIT<br />
ON TREASURY ALLOCATIONS AND SUBSIDIES AND WHICH CAST ThE<br />
FARMERS, IN THE EYES OF THE COMMUNITY AT LARGE, AS A<br />
MENDICANT CLASS, HEEDLESS OF SOUND BUSINESS PRACTICE AND<br />
DEPENDENT ON THE TAXPAYERS' CHARITY$ I GIVE YOU MY ASSURANCE<br />
THAT THE GOVERNMENT WILL CONTINUE TO ASSIST PRIMARY INDUSTRY,<br />
BECAUSE YOUR CONTINUED PROSPERITY IS ESSENTIAL TO US ALL, . BUT<br />
OUR ASSISTANCE WILL BE GEARED TO NATIONAL INTERESTS AND NEEDS,<br />
,/ 7 </p>
<p>7-<br />
THE GREAT INSTRUMENT FOR DIRECTING GOVERNMENT<br />
ASSISTANCE TO RURAL INDUSTRY WILL BE-OUR INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE<br />
COMMISSION. As YOU KNOW, THIS IS BEING SET UP ON THE<br />
BASIS OF A REPORT FROM SIR JOHN CRAWFORD IN ORDER TO<br />
SUBJECT CALLS FOR ASSISTANCE TO ALL INDUSTRIES, INCLUDING<br />
RURAL INDUSTRY, TO REGULAR INDEPENDENT AND PUBLIC SCRUTINY.<br />
IN THIS CONNECTION, I COMMEND THE FULL AND GENEROUS SUPPORT<br />
I HAVE RECEIVED FROM YOUR ORGANISATION ON THIS ISSUE. YOU<br />
RECOGNISED QUITE FRANKLY THAT SUCH A COMMISSION MIGHT,<br />
ON OCCASIONS, WORK AGAINST THE SHORT-TERM INTEREST OF ONE<br />
OF YOUR INDUSTRILS, BUT THAT REGULAR, INDEPENDENT PUBLIC<br />
SCRUTINY OF ALL ASSISTANCE PROPOSALS WILL, IN THE LONG RUN,<br />
BENEFIT MOST ECONOMIC PRODUCERS AND ALL OF US AS CONSUMERS<br />
AND AS TAXPAYERS. THAT IS A. REALISTIC AND SENSIBLE APPRAOCH, BUT IT<br />
IS NOT, I GATHER, THE APPROACH TAKE' BY THE COUNTRY PARTY,<br />
THEY SEEM TO THINK THEY KNOW BETTER THAN YOU, THE FARMERSi<br />
WHAT IS GOOD FOR THE FARMING COMMUNIV. THIS MAY NOT BE THE<br />
PLACE TO SPECULATE ON THE COUNTRY PARTY'S MOTIVES,, BUT I MUST<br />
DISCOUNT THE SUGGESTION THAT THEIR APPROACH TO THIS MEASURE<br />
HAS ANYTHING TO DO WITH THEIR PLANS TO COINTEST CITY ELECTORATES.<br />
I CANNOT BELIEVE FOR A MOMENT THAT THEY ARE MORE INTERESTED IN<br />
WINNING SUPPORT AMONG CITY MANUFACTURERS ' TIAN IN FLIFTHERING THE<br />
INTERESTS OF COUNTRY PEOPLE. I LEAVE TIIOS ; F UESTIONS TO YOU)<br />
YOU KNOW THE COUNTRY PARTY BETTER THAN I DO. J NOTICE) HIOWEVER,<br />
MR. ANTHONY'S STATEMENT THAT THE COMMISSIOiJ WILL USLhZP THE<br />
GOVERNMENT'S AUTHORITY. I ,/ 8 </p>
<p>-8-<br />
HE SUGGESTS THAT THE COMMISSION WILL BE SO POWERFUL THAT NO<br />
GOVERNMENT WILL BE ABLE TO REJECT ITS ADVICE, COMING FROM<br />
A MEMBER OF GOVERNMENT THAT REJECTED ADVICE, AND CONCEALED<br />
ADVICE, ON INNUMERABLE OCCASIONS'-I FIND THAT HARD TO ACCEPT,<br />
IT IS, OF COURSE, A FANTASY, IT IS INTENDED TO CREATE<br />
DOUBT AND UNCERTAINTY ABOUT PROPOSAS-THAT ARE IN FACT<br />
QUITE CLEAR AND HAVE BEEN SPELT OUT-IN OUR LEGISLATION IN<br />
PRECISE DETAIL, THE HEART OF THE LEGISLATION IS THE SO-CALLED<br />
MANDATORY REFERENCE PROVISION. THIS REQUIRES THE GOVERNMENT<br />
TO REFER TO THE COMMISSION FOR INQUIRY AND REPORT ALL QUESTIONS<br />
OF ASSISTANCE TO A PARTICULAR PRIMARY OR SECONDARY INDUSTRY<br />
BEFORE TAKING ACTION TO PROVIDE SUCH ASSISTANCE. THE MANDATORY<br />
REFERENCE PROVISION PROVIDES A VITAL SAFEGUARD TO THE<br />
INTEGRITY OF THE GENERAL SYSTEM, WHEREBY THE GOVERNMENT<br />
DECIDES ON THE DIFFERENT AMOUNTS OF MONEY TO BE GIVEN TO<br />
PARTICULAR INDUSTRIES, IT ENSURES THAT THE SYSTEM FOR<br />
DISCRIMINATING BETWEEN DIFFERENT INDUSTRIES WILL BE OBJECTIVE<br />
AND IMPARTIAL. IN THE ABSENCE OF THIS PROVISION THERE WOULD<br />
BE VERY GREAT PRESSURE ON PARLIAMENTARIANS, AND IN PARTICULAR<br />
ON MINISTERS, TO HAVE LEVELS OF ASSISTANCE DECIDED BEHIND<br />
CLOSED DOORS WITHOUT PUBLIC INQUIRY, CONTRARY TO THE<br />
PRINCIPLES OF OPEN GOVERNMENT AND THE INTERESTS OF CONSUMERS, ,/ 9 </p>

<p>OUR LEGISLATION FOR THE INDUSTR, ASSISTANCE COMMISSION<br />
WILL NOT AFFECT OUR PLANS FOR RURAL RECONSTRUCTION. W4E WILL,<br />
HOWEVER, BE GUIDED BY ADVICE FROM THE COMMISSION. AFTER A<br />
REVIEW OF THE RURAL RECONSTRUCTION SCHEME THIS YEAR, THE<br />
GOVERNMENT DECIDED TO CONTINUE THE* SCH . EME UNTIL 1976, BUT WITH<br />
MORE EMPHASIS BEING PLACED ON THE BUILD-UP OF UNECONOMIC FARM<br />
UNITS. MORE THAN $ 47 MILLION WAS INCLUDED IN THE BUDGET FOR<br />
EXPENDITURE IN THE CURRENT FINANCIAL YEAR. AN IMPORTANT PART<br />
OF THE SCHEME IS THE REHABILITATION OF NEEDY FARMERS WHO WISH<br />
TO LEAVE THE LAND. THE DEPARTMENT OF PRIMARY INDUSTRY IS<br />
EXAMINING PROPOSALS FOR A MORE IMAGINATIVE AND CONSTRUCTIVE<br />
PROVISION IN THIS REGARD, SIMILARLY, THE FRUITGROWING<br />
RECONSTRUCTION SCHEME, WHICH IS DESIGNED TO HELP FRUITGROWERS<br />
IN FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES TO REMOVE SOME OR ALL OF THEIR TREES<br />
AND EITHER LEAVE THE INDUSTRY OR PUT THEIR LAND TO AN<br />
ALTERNATIVE USE, HAS BEEN EXTENDED FOR ANOTHER YEAR AT AN<br />
ESTIMATED COST OF $ 2 MILLION.<br />
IN THIS CONTEXT, THERE IS ONE PARTICULAR BUDGET MEASURE<br />
THAT I WANT TO EXPLAIN TO You. As YOU KNOW, WE DECIDED TO<br />
REMOVE THE EXEMPTION FROM SALES TAX ON CARBONATED SOFT-DR! NKS<br />
CONTAINING 5% OR MORE OF AUSTRALIAN FRUIT JUICE. THIS DECISION<br />
WAS TAKEN BECAUSE SUCH EXEMPTION WAS THE WRONG INSTRUMENT FOR<br />
ENLARGING THE FRUITGROWER'I S MARKET. ONLY A FRACTION OF THE $ 23<br />
MILLION A YEAR WHICH THE EXEMPTION COST THE GOVERNMENT WAS<br />
RETURNED TO THE GROWER. IASSURE YOU THAT WHILE ASOLISHING THE<br />
EXEMPTION THE GOVERNMENT IS READY TO PROVIDE FIJNDS TO ASSIST<br />
ANY SECTOR OF THE FRUITGROWING INDUSTRY THAT MAY BE ADVERSELY<br />
AFFECTED. THIS HELP WILL PROVIDE MORE LASTING BENEFIT THAN THE<br />
SALES-TAX EXEMPTION WHICH REQUIRES CONTINUING SUBVENTIONS BY<br />
THE TAXPAYER. ./ 11 </p>
<p>11<br />
WE. HAVE TAKEN OTHER MEASURES TO ASSIST RURAL<br />
INDUSTRIES. AN AMOUNT OF $ 20 MILLION WAS PROVIDED IN THE<br />
BUDGET TO FACILITATE LONG-TERM RURAL LENDING BY THE<br />
COMMONWEALTH DEVELOPMENT BANK FQR A WIDER. RANGE OF PURPOSES.<br />
THEY INCLUDE THE FINANCING OF FARM PORCHASES, REPAYMENT OF<br />
SHORT-TERM DEBTS IN APPROPRIATE CASES, AND ASSISTANCE IN CASES<br />
OF FINANCIAL DIFFICULTY ASSOCIATED WITH THE DEATH OF A FARM<br />
PROPRIETOR, OUTSIDE THE BUDGET ITSELF, THE GOVERNMENT HAS TAKEN<br />
A WHOLE SERIES. OF DECISIONS THAT WILL BENEFIT THE FARMER. IN<br />
OUR EARLY DAYS, WE SHOWED OURSELVES. READY TO RESPOND TO THE<br />
URGENT NEED TO ENCOURAGE WHEAT PRODUCTION. WE NOT ONLY<br />
ACCEPTED A DELIVERY QUOTA OF 514 MILLION BUSHELS THE HIGHEST<br />
OP RECORD.-BUT ADDED A " FLOATING POOL" OF 20 MILLION BUSHELS<br />
ON TOP OF THAT, READY FOR ANY STATE THAT.. EXCEEDED ITS PORTION<br />
OF THE NATIONAL QUOTA. WE INCREASED THE FIRST ADVANCE PAYMENT<br />
ON WHEAT FROM $ 1.10 TO $ 1.20 A BUSHEL FOR THE NEXT HARVEST.<br />
THIS WAS THE FIRST INCREASE IN THE ADVANCE FOR 15 YEARS.<br />
Wœ EHAVE ALSO AGREED TO AN IMMEDIATE PAYMENT OF A SECOND ADVANCE<br />
ON THE 1969-70 CROP. OUR INITIATIVESIN QUICKLY ESTABLISHING<br />
DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS-WITH CHINA HAVE BEEN WELCOMED BY THE<br />
. AUSTRALIAN WHEAT INDUSTRY. As YOU KNOW, THE MINISTER FOR<br />
OVERSEAS TRADE, DR. JIM CAIRNSj RECENTLY ANNOUNCED OUR FIRST<br />
LONG-TERM WHEAT CONTRACT WITH CHINA. THE DEPARTMENT OF<br />
PRIMARY INDUSTRY IS NOW WORKING ON A NEW WHEAT* STABILISATION<br />
PLAN TO REPLACE THE ONE-YEAR EXTENSION OF THE CURRENT PLAN.<br />
WE HOPE TO IMPROVE THE PROVISIONS FOR STABILISATION. </p>
<p>r"<br />
THEN 7tH-RE WERE OUR TARIFF CUTS, IN JULY 1973<br />
T* HVE GOVERNMENT REDUCED ALL TARIFF RATES By 257 TO ALLOW<br />
IMPORTS TO EN4TER AUSTRALIA MORE CHEAPLY. IBELIEVE<br />
PRIMARY PRODUCERS WILL REAP SIGNIFICANT BENEFITS FROM THE<br />
TARIFF CUT. IN PARTICULAR IT IS EXPECTED-TO REDUCE THE<br />
PRICE OF A WIDE RANGE OF FARM MACHINERY. ' IT WILL REDUCE<br />
TO SOME EXTENT THE NEED FOR AN ADDITIONAL REVALUATION<br />
OF THE DOLLAR, AND WILL HELP PRIMARY PRODUCERS BY RESTRAINING<br />
THE RATE OF INFLATION AND HENCE THE COST OF LABOUR EMPLOYED<br />
IN PRIMARY INDUSTRY.<br />
IASK YOU TO REMEMBER THAT ItN ANY PERIOD OF INFLATION<br />
THERE ARE DIFFICULT PROBLEMS FOR ALL DEMOCRATICALLY ELECTED<br />
GOVERNMENTS. IT IS NO ACCIDENT THAT THOSE IN CHARGE OF<br />
NATIONAL AFFAIRS DURING INFLATIONARY PERIODS OFTEN BECOME<br />
SOMEWHAT UNPOPULAR. TO ACT RESPONSIBLY THEY MUST REDUCE<br />
THE COMMUNITY'IS LEVEL OF SPENDING IN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER.<br />
THEY MUST BRING IT CLOSER TO THE COMMUNITY'S CAPACITY TO<br />
PRODUCE OR IMPORT GOODS AND SERVICES. REDUCING ANYONE'S<br />
SPa NDING IS NOT THE BEST WAY TO COURT POPULARITY YET IT<br />
MUST BE DONE IN THE INTERESTS OF RESPONSIBLE ECONOMIC<br />
MANAGEMENT. THE PRESENT INFLATIONARY PERIOD IS IN MANY WAYS<br />
REMINISCENT OF THE WOOL BOOM IN THE EARLY 1950O'S, AT THAT<br />
TIME SIR ARTHUR FADDEN THEN LEADER OF THE AIJSTRALIAN<br />
COUNTRY PARTY AND TREASURER FOUND IT NECESSARY TO INTRODUCE<br />
THE WOOL SALES DEDUCTION TAX, UNDER WHICH WAS DEDUCTED<br />
FROM EACH GRAZIER I'S WOO&amp;~ CHEQUE. </p>
<p>13<br />
A; YOU MIGHT EXPECT, THIS DIDN'T MAKE ARTIE FADDEN THE MOST<br />
POPULAR MAN IN THE BUSH. I QUOTE FROM HIS AUTOBIOGRAPHY:<br />
" CRITICISM OF THIS DECISION ROLLED IN LIKE A TIDAL WAVE,<br />
BACKED BY HOSTILE RESOLUTIONS FROM BRANCHES,. CANCELLED<br />
MEMBERSHIP SUBSCRIPTIONS AND DEMANDS FOR MY EXPULSION."<br />
I AM SOMETIMES RELIEVED THAT I BELONG TO SUCH A GENTLEMANLY<br />
BODY AS THE AUSTRALIAN LABOR PARTY.<br />
I MENTION THESE MATTERS TO ILLUSTRATE MY POINT THAT<br />
DEMOCRATICALLY ELECTED GOVERNMENTS ARE SOMETIMES FORCED BY<br />
CIRCUMSTANCES TO TAKE UNPOPULAR DECISIONS DECISIONS WHICH.<br />
THEY BELIEVETO BE IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF THE NATION. IT<br />
IS EASY, AT THE PRESENT TIME, TO DEPICT US AS AN ANTI-RURAL<br />
PARTY, TO CONCENTRATE ON THE UNPOPULAR DECISIONS WHICH WE<br />
AVE FELT IT NECESSARY TO TAKE IN THE GENERAL INTEREST, AND<br />
CONVENIENTLY IGNORE THOSE THINGS WE HAVE DONE WHICH<br />
HAVE HELPED THE COUNTRYMAN.<br />
AS A GOVERNMENT WE STAND READY TO HELP AUSTRALIANS<br />
' IV ARE SUFFERING MISFORTUNES WHERE EVERI THEY MAY LIVE ON<br />
FAAINS, IN COUNTRY TOWNS OR IN THE CITIES. IF THE FARMING<br />
COMMUNITY IS AGAIN EXPOSED TO ECONOMIC HARDSHIPS WE WILL R"<br />
PREPARED TO PLAY OUR PART IN HELPING-INDIVIDUALS TO MAKE<br />
THE BEST AND MOST RATIONAL CHOICES AND, IF NECESSARY, CUSHION<br />
THEM AGAINST ECONOMIC ADVERSITY, WE HAVE qLWAYS VOTED FOR<br />
SUCH POLICIES WHEN WE WERE IN OPPOSITION; WE WILL ADOPT 1&amp; EM<br />
IF NECESSARY NOW THAT WE FORM THE GOVERNMENT. IN FEBRUARY TH( S<br />
YEAR WE ANNOUNCED PROPOSALS COSTING $ 10 MILLION TO HELP CHILPA E<br />
IN ISOLATED RURAL AREAS UNDERTAKE PRIMARY AND SECONDARY SCHOOLING.<br />
/ 14 </p>
<p>-14-<br />
PERHAPS I CAN SUM UP MY GOVERNMENT'S BROAD INTENTIONS<br />
BY QUOTING A STATEMENT BY THE AUSTRALIAN WOOLGROWERS' AND<br />
GRAZIERS' COUNCIL, THE COUNCIL HAP THIS TO SAY: " THE MOST<br />
IMPORTANT LONG-TERM STEP THE GOVERNMENT CAN TAKE IS TO<br />
IMPROVE THE EFFICIENCY OF NATIONAL RESOURCE ALLOCATION BY<br />
ENCOURAGING THE EXPANSION OF LESS PROTECTED INDUSTRIES IN THE<br />
ECONOMY ( WHETHER PRIMARY OR SECONDARY) AND DISCOURAGING THE<br />
GROWTH OF THOSE INDUSTRIES WHICH CAN ONLY PRODUCE WITH THE<br />
HELP OF MASSIVE LEVELS OF ASSISTANCE EITHER SUBSIDY OR<br />
TARIFF. THIS WILL INCREASE THE LEVEL OF REAL ECONOMIC GROWTH<br />
FOR THE BETTERMENT OF THE WHOLE COMMUNITY,"<br />
I SUGGEST THAT THE GOVERNMENT, IN THE INTERESTS<br />
OF THE COMMUNITY AS A WHOLE, IS DOING JUST WHAT THE WOOLGROWERS'<br />
AND GRAZIERS' COUNCIL SUGGESTED. I BELIEVE THAT OUR POLICIES<br />
WILL BENEFIT, NOT ONLY THE GREAT FARMING COMMUNITY OF THIS<br />
NATION, BUT THE AUSTRALIAN PEOPLE AS A WHOLE.<br />
