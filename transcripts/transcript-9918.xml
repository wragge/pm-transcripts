PRIME MINISTER 4/ 96<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MNISTER, THE HON PJ KEATING MP<br />
JANET HOLMES a COURT TO CHAIR CENTENARY OF FEDERATION COUNCIL<br />
I am delighted to announce that Janet Holmes a Court has agreed to chair the<br />
Centenary of Federation Council.<br />
The Council will coordinate centenary-related planning across the nation in the years<br />
leading up to and including the centenary of federation in 2001, and administer grants to<br />
community activities and projects commemorating and celebrating the first hundred<br />
years of the federation of the Australian States in 1901.<br />
The Council is being established as a result of consideration by the Council of Australian<br />
Governments of the report of the Centenary of Federation Advisory Committee, chaired<br />
by Joan Kirner. It will comprise a nominee from each State and Territory and up to six<br />
Commonwealth nominees, including a local government representative. The<br />
membership will be announced shortly.<br />
The Council will be pivotal in the lead up to the celebration and commemoration of a<br />
great democratic achievement.<br />
Janet Holmes a Court is a very distinguished Australian. Her wide experience in<br />
cultural, business and community activities will be of great value to the Centenary of<br />
Federation Council as it begins its task. It will direct activities that include all<br />
Australians, are community focussed and, wherever possible, are of lasting significance<br />
into the next millennium.<br />
( Janet Holmes a Court is Chair of Heytesbury Holdings and all companies in the<br />
Heytesbury Group including the John Holland Group and Heytesbury Pastoral Group; a<br />
member of the Reserve Bank Board; Chair of the Australian Children's Television<br />
Foundation; and Chair of the Black Swan Theatre Company.)<br />
