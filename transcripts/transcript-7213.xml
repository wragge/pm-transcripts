    <content><![CDATA[<p> 2 SEPTEMBER 1987</p>
<p>It was with the deepest regret that I learned of the death of Alan Reid after a prolonged illness.</p>
<p>Alan Reid was one of Australia's most respected political journalists and the doyen of the Canberra Press Gallery for many years.</p>
<p>His trademarks were his professionalism, his perception, the accuracy and clarity of his reporting, and his personal Integrity.</p>
<p>Alan enjoyed the respect of his journalistic colleagues and politicians of all persuasions, and took considerable interest In imparting his deep knowledge and wide experience to younger members of his profession.</p>
<p>It is with some pride that I recall Alan as a personal friend over many years. Hazel and I extend our deepest sympathies to his wife Joan and his family.</p>
