PRIME MINISTER<br />
CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY<br />
OPENING ADDRESS, ST MARY'S VILLA, CONCORD, 7 JULY 1985<br />
YOUR GRACE, ARCHBISHOP CLANCY, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN<br />
IT GIVES ME GREAT PLEASUtCE TO BE HERE TODAY TO SHARE THE<br />
SATISFACTION AND JOY YOU MUST ALL BE FEELING IN SEEING<br />
ST MARY'S VILLA NOW A REALITYI<br />
REALISE THAT OVER THE LAST 10 YEARS A GREAT NUMBER OF<br />
PEOPLE HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN THIS PROJECT, AND THEIR<br />
GENEROSITY HAS BEEN REMARKABLE.<br />
BY GIVING SO GENEROUSLY OF YOUR TIME, EFFORT AND MONEY<br />
YOU HAVE EXPR~ ESSED YOUR CONCERN FOR THE AGED IN YOUR<br />
COMMU14ITY IN A VERY PRACTICAL WAYIN<br />
THIS REGARD i WAS QUITE STRUCK BY THE PERSPECTIVE OF<br />
A PARISHIONEK WHO RECENTLY WROTE OF ST MARY'S VILLA:<br />
' FIRSTLY IT HAS TO BE RECOGNISEDJ AS THE CULMINATION<br />
OF ONcE MAN' 0S IDEALS AND) PtRSI. kVERANCE. I'M SURE<br />
THERE WERE TIMES WHE1N FINANCIALLY IT SEEMED AN<br />
IMPOSSIBILITY OUR FATHER DELANEY HAS NEVER BEEN<br />
KNOWN TO GIVE IN NOR GIVE UP EASILYjp<br />
at 11<br />
jimm<br />
if 3w / T </p>
<p>' SOMEHOW OR OTHER HE HAS ALWAYS BEEN ABLE TO RING<br />
THAT LAST CENT, THAT LAST GRANT FROM SOME<br />
GOVERNMENT BODY. NEEDLESS TO SAY HIS PARISHIONERS<br />
WERE NOT OVERLOOKED AND MANY FOUND THEIR POCKETS<br />
WERE MUCH DEEPER THAN THEY REALISED<br />
' SECONDLY ( THE PARISHIONER CONTINUED) THIS BUILDING<br />
MEANS LOVE, CARING AND SHARING-SO MANY PEOPLE<br />
HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN SO MANY WAYS, SOME LARGE,<br />
SOME SMALL-SOME HAVE GIVEN CASH DONATIONS, OTHERS<br />
HAVE ORGANISED FUNCTIONS TO RAISE MONEY, WHILE<br />
OTHERS HAVE HELPED IN THE PLANNING OF THE PROJECT.<br />
A COMMITTEE HAS BEEN ORGANISED TO HELP THE ELDERLY<br />
PEOPLE AFTER THEY HAVE SETTLED IN. ALL THESE<br />
ACTIONS, CONCLUDED THE PARISHIONER, ATTO ME<br />
SYMBOLISE-LOVE AND CARING-i<br />
IT HAS INDEED BEEN4 A PHENOMENAL, DEDICATED, CO-OPERATIVE<br />
EFFORT ON THE PAr
FATHER DELANEY, I SHOULD LIKE TO SINGLE OUT OTHER SUCH<br />
AS SISTER M1. THELCA WHOSE YEARS OF DEVOTED EFFORT AS<br />
ADMINISTRATOR OF THE COMMUNITY CENTRE FOR THE AGED HAVE<br />
BEEN CONSPICUOUS. THE SUPPORT PROVIDED BY THE PARISHES<br />
OF STRATHF1ELD, FIVE-DOCK, HABERFIELD, EASTWOOD,<br />
ENFIELD, HOMEBUSH AND BY THE CATHOLIC WOMEN'S LEAGUE HAS<br />
ALSO BEEN A VITAL INGREDIENT IN THE SUCCESS OF THIS<br />
PROJECT-</p>
<p>THERE IS ALSO HOW THE CONTRIBUTION BEING MADE BY THE<br />
SISTERS OF THE GOOD SAMARITAN AND THE BAND OF DEDICATED<br />
STAFF WHO TOGETHER WILL ENSURE A GENEROUS, CARING<br />
ENVIRONMENT FOR THE AGED AND ELDERLY IN THEIR CHARGE.<br />
AND LAST, BUT NOT LEAST, THERE IS A MICHAEL MAHER YOUR<br />
LOCAL MEMBER. HE IS WELL KNOWN, INDEED RENOWNED FOR HIS<br />
DETERMINED, PERSISTENT AND CERTAINLY IRREPRESSIBLE<br />
PURSUIT OF HIS CONSTITUTENTS INTERESTS. HIS SUPPORT FOR<br />
THE DEVELOPMENT OF ST MARY'S VILLA IS NO EXCEPTION.<br />
BUILDING A FACILITY SUCH AS THIS IS A VERY VISIBLE<br />
RESPONSE TO THE NEEDS OF THE AGED IN OUR COMMUNITY.<br />
BY NEXT CENTURY THE AGED WILL REPRESENT A LARGER AND A<br />
GROWING PROPORTION OF AUSTRALIA'S POPULATION. THEIR<br />
NEEDS WILL DEMAND INCREASINGLY CLOSE ATTENTION FROM THE<br />
GOVERNMENTYOU WOULD ALL APPRECIATE THAT THE AGED ARE A VERY<br />
DIVERSE GROUP OF PEOPLE WITH VERY DIFFERENT NEEDS; AND<br />
THOSE NEEDS ARE LIKELY TO CHANGE OVER TIME.<br />
HERE AT ST MARY'S VILLA YOU NOW HAVE A DAY CARE CENTRE,<br />
A HOSTEL AND A NURSING HOME, ALL OF WHICH ARE VITALLY<br />
NEEDED BY DIFFERENT SECTIONS OF YOUR AGED COMMUNITY. </p>
<p>AND I AM VEikY PLEASED THAT THE COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT<br />
HAS BEEN ABLE TO ASSIST YOUR UNDERTAKINGS WITH CAPITAL<br />
ASSISTANCE OF SOME $ 1~. 27 MILLION FOR THE NURSING HOME<br />
AND HOSTEL-IN ADDITION, WE WILL BE PROVIDING ONGOING<br />
ASSISTANCE TO THE NURSING HOME IN THE ORDER~ OF<br />
PER YEAR.<br />
THROUGHOUT AUSTRALIA, IN THE 1984-85 FINANCIAL YEAR JUST<br />
COMPLETED, COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT EXPENDITURE ON<br />
NURSING HOME ARRANGEMENTS WAS ALMOST $ 1000 MILLION,<br />
INCLUDING ABOUT $ 280 MILLION FUR DEFICIT FUNDED NURSING<br />
HOMES.<br />
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S RECENT ANNOUNCEMENT OF A NEW<br />
HOME-AND COMMUNITY CARE PROGRAM IS A PARTICULAR<br />
MANIFESTATION OF OUR WISH TO -TAIL~ ii GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS<br />
FOR THE ELDERLY AS CLOSELY AS POSSIBLE TO THEIR NEEDSSOME<br />
MILLION HAS BEEN DEDICATtD TO THIS PROGkAM FOR<br />
THE NEXT THREE YEARS.<br />
AT PRESENT THE BULK OF COMMONWEALTH ASSISTANCE IS<br />
DIRECTED TO ONE SEGMENT OF THE AGED POPULATION THOSE<br />
LIVING IN NURSING HOMES. WE SEE A VERY REAL NEED ALSO<br />
TO PROVIDE VARIOUS OTHER FORMS OF ASSISTANCE TO THE<br />
GREAT NUMBER OF AGED PEOPLE LIVINIG IN THE COMMUNITY-</p>
<p>IN l9&amp; Uo A SURVEY SHOWED THAT, OF THE PEOPLE AGED<br />
YEARS AND OVER WHO WERE MODERATELY OR SEVERLY<br />
HANDICAPPED, NEARLY THREL QUARTERS LIVED IN THE<br />
COMMUNITY COMPARED WITH ONLY ONE QUARTER IN<br />
INSTITUTIONSFOR AGED~ PEOPLE LIVING IN THE COMMUNITY, WE, AS A<br />
GOVERNMENTo AIM TO ENSURE THAT THEIR NEEDS AR( E MET IN A<br />
WAY WHICH IS AFFORDABLE BY THE AGED THEMSELVES AND BY<br />
THE REST OF THE COMMUNITY-WE AIM TO ENSURE THAT EVERY<br />
AGED PeRSUN IS ABLE TO SELECT, WITH HIS OH HEk<br />
RELATIVES, THE COMBINATION OF SERVICES MOST APPROPRIATE<br />
TO HIS OR HER MEDICAL, SOCIAL AND EMOTIONAL NEcDS.<br />
WE AS A GOVER~ NMENT ARE COMMITTED TO PROVIDING A RANGE OF<br />
SERVICES FOR THE AGED WHICH ARE-EQUITABLE,<br />
* COMPREHENS-IVE, BALANCED AND COST EFFECTIVE-IN LINE<br />
Wi TH THIS APPROACH I CAN ASSURE YOU HEALTH SERVICIES WILL<br />
BE EXEMPT FROM THE CONSUMPTION TAX ON SERVICES NUW BEING<br />
COMMITTED BY THE GOVERNMENT. THE SAME COMMITMENT IS<br />
APPARE14T IN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT' S DECISION TO SET<br />
UP AN OFFICE FOR THE AGED. THIS OFFICE, ALONG WITH THE<br />
OFFICE FOR DISABILITY, WILL ENSURE THAT THE NEEDS OF THE<br />
AGED AND THE ELDERLY WILL HAVE A PkOMINENT PLACE IN THE<br />
DEVELOPMENT OF GOVERNMENT POLICIES-</p>
<p>THE NEW OFFICE FOk THE AGED WILL PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE<br />
IN ASSESSING CLIEN1 NEEDS. QUALITY OF CARE AND THE<br />
CONCERNS OF SERVICE PROVIDERS. THE CLOSE L-INKS IT HILL<br />
BUILD WITH INDIVIDUALS iiD SERVICE PROVIDERS WILL BE OF<br />
PARTICULAR VALUE T'O ALL THOSE CO1CERNED WITH ENSURING<br />
ADEQUATE ATTENTION TO THE NEEDS TO THE ELDERLYAM<br />
CONFIDENT THAT WE AkE MEETING THE CHALLENGE OF<br />
PROVIDING BETTER ASSISTANCE FOR AGED PEOPLE IN OUx<br />
SOCIETY. IN THIS WE DEPEND HEAVILY ON THE ENORMOUS CONTRIBUTOI<br />
MADE BY NUMEROUS ORGANISATIONS DEDICATED TO THE WELFARE<br />
OF AGED PEOPLE. THE TYPE OF ENTHUSIASM AND COMMITMENT<br />

VILLA IS VITAL TO THE AUSTRALIAN COMMUNITY'S EFFORTS TO<br />
-SATISFY THE NEEDS. OF OUR GROWING NUMBER OF OLD PEOPLELADIES<br />
