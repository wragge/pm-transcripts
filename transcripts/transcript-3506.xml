NOTES FOR THE PRIME MINISTER OPENING OF THE ARTHUR DIBDIN COMPLEX<br />
BRISBANE CRICKET GROUND 1 DECEMBER 1974<br />
1. Whenever I perform functions of this kind a few<br />
unkind people accuse me of grandstanding. No one can say I<br />
have neglected sport during my visits to Queensland. Only<br />
yesterday I was at the Australian hardcourt tennis championships<br />
in Gympie. Two weeks ago I visited an Australian Rules Club<br />
in Brisbane. This is one of the biggest crowds I have drawn<br />
during my election campaign. Of course it's a completely nonpolitical<br />
occasion. If it was as lively as some of the meetings<br />
I've addressed, your Premier would be declaring a State of<br />
Emergency. 2. I was delighted to accept the invitation from Clem<br />
Jones. He has revealed some unusual talents lately. Last May<br />
I asked him to run for the Federal Parliament but the people<br />
of Brisbane preferred him to play on his home ground. I always<br />
accept the umpire's decision.<br />
3. Unfortunately I don't get to cricket matches as<br />
often as I should. My distinguished predecessor Sir Robert<br />
Menzies was a great lover of the game. I don't know whether he<br />
ever actually played cricket, but he used to watch it at<br />
Lords whenever he went to London, which was quite often.<br />
He had a longer innings in politics than anyone, so perhaps<br />
there is a lesson somewhere. A Prime Minister should either<br />
follow cricket or go overseas. If he does both it is very hard<br />
to get him out.<br />
4. This ground was the scene of a test match that has<br />
come to be known as the greatest game of cricket ever played.<br />
It was the tied test between Australia and the West Indies in<br />
1960. I wish we had such close results in Queensland elections.<br />
At all events, there is not a cricketer or a lover of the game<br />
in the world who has not heard of the Brisbane Cricket Ground.<br />
Such a ground deserves the very best facilities for players and<br />
spectators. You are getting such facilities in this Arthur Dibdin<br />
complex. They will be a lot better than those at many other<br />
leading grounds in Australia, including the S. C. G. where conditions<br />
are still appalling. My Government has done a lot for sport. We are the<br />
first Federal Government to assume a responsibility in this area<br />
and make direct and regular grants to sporting bodies. We<br />
have given more than $ 500,000 in Queensland for sporting projects.<br />
We have at last dragged sport into politics, or politics into<br />
sport, and I am proud that we have.<br />
6. Brisbane City Council is campaigning strongly to make<br />
Brisbane the venue of the 1982 Commonwealth Games. That will be<br />
decided at Monreal in 1976. Brisbane is already planning the<br />
facilities which could allow it to stage the Games. Sites have<br />
been chosen and work has started * on the athletics complex. I am<br />
glad to announce that the Australian Government through the<br />
Department of Tourism and Recreation, will contribute $ 250,000 to<br />
the cost of the running track. That is in addition to the<br />
$ 500,000 we have given.<br />
7. I hav e pleasure in declaring open the Arthur Dibdin<br />
complex at the Brisbane Cricket Ground. </p>
