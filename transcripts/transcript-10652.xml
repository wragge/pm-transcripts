<p>(TAPE BREAK)</p>
<p>It was a very constructive meeting and despite the fact that the Labor</p>
<p> States registered their in-principle objection to the GST there was</p>
<p> no evidence that any of them wanted to be excluded from the mechanism</p>
<p> to implement the plan. Queensland has some reservations about one</p>
<p> aspect of the transitional arrangements, New South Wales is against</p>
<p> horizontal fiscal equalisation but I am sure will be happy to participate.</p>
<p> Because under the plan after the transitional arrangements all States</p>
<p> will be better off, that is the bottom line and I hope a dropped copy</p>
<p> of this document is delivered to every Senator in Australia because</p>
<p> the Senate is meant to be the States' house isn't it, and</p>
<p> you have now got a document where the principles of the new arrangement</p>
<p> have been endorsed by the State Premiers and the two Chief Ministers</p>
<p> of the States.</p>
<p>So, the Treasurer and I regard this as an outstandingly successful</p>
<p> meeting, a meeting which is an important milestone along the path</p>
<p> towards a new and better and fairer and modern taxation system for</p>
<p> the next century. And we say again to those in the Senate who are</p>
<p> deaf to the wishes of the Australian people, you should heed the verdict</p>
<p> of the Australian people and participate in passing this legislation</p>
<p> into law as soon as possible.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, ....(inaudible)...reservations, Premier Beattie</p>
<p> says he is very unhappy and unhappy to the tune of$465 million?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, any suggestions that Queensland is losing $465 million is utterly</p>
<p> and completely wrong. We have delivered in full on our promise that</p>
<p> no State would be worse off during the transitional period. And according</p>
<p> to our figures, in the fourth year after introduction of the plan</p>
<p> Queensland is better off to the tune of over $400 million. Queensland</p>
<p> does extraordinary well after the transitional period. I don't</p>
<p> think any... any suggestion by Mr Beattie...I understand States</p>
<p> have got to go in hard for their constituents, I understand that and</p>
<p> I, you know, I have watched the advertisements. And the Treasurer</p>
<p> and I had the rare pleasure of sitting back today and watching exchanges</p>
<p> going like that rather than like that. It was quite an experience.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Isn't the political reality that Mr Beattie will talk to Senator</p>
<p> Colston and Senator Colston seems to be indicating that he'll</p>
<p> side on that issue which means you can't get your tax through?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I am not going to start anticipating debate in the Senate, I am just</p>
<p> responding to any suggestion that the people of Queensland have been</p>
<p> short-changed. The people of Queensland will benefit enormously from</p>
<p> this plan. On top of the very significant increase that they will</p>
<p> get after the transitional period the cuts in fuel tax are more, the</p>
<p> cost of fuel, are more beneficial to the people of Queensland than</p>
<p> the people of any other State because of the huge distances of that</p>
<p> State and the cost of transporting fuel....of goods and services.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>So as a low taxing State now, it's not the case that with the</p>
<p> introduction of a GST, taxes paid by Queenslanders would go to other</p>
<p> States?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Look, what seems to be forgotten is that as well as a GST being introduced</p>
<p> is income taxes are getting cut, and Australians living in Queensland</p>
<p> will get the same benefit from that tax cut as Australians living</p>
<p> in New South Wales or Victoria.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, could you explain how the transitional changes today have</p>
<p> changed and also the conveyancing taxes that the States were going</p>
<p> to abolish  has that now been delayed or has that tax not been</p>
<p> abolished?</p>
<p> PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, what we have said in the agreement is that from the 1st</p>
<p> of July 2001 the stamp duty on business conveyancing other than on</p>
<p> real property will be abolished, the timing of the abolition of the</p>
<p> tax on real property can be determined after we have more solid information</p>
<p> on the numbers involved in tax on real property. One of the difficulties,</p>
<p> it's not a difficulty but one of the inevitable elements of a</p>
<p> negotiation such as this is it's very hard to get precise figures</p>
<p> on many of these things. We did some calculations based on the data</p>
<p> that the States published, there's been further discussion about</p>
<p> the amount of money involved in each element of each of the individual</p>
<p> State taxes and we are going to have some further work done and we'll</p>
<p> have a much clearer picture when we come back to the Premiers conference</p>
<p> which will be held in, probably in April of next year.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Were those initial calculations wrong Prime Minister?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, they weren't wrong because they were done on the basis of</p>
<p> the information the States had supplied.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Was that also a problem with gambling taxes?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, there won't be any difficulty with gambling. We had a discussion</p>
<p> today which, I think, will resolve all of that.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>And what was the conclusion of that discussion, what have you decided?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, we are going to have an arrangement that is mutually satisfactory</p>
<p> to both sides and there will be something further said about it later.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Treasurer Costello, how much extra did it cost you to get the States</p>
<p> on side?</p>
<p>TREASURER:</p>
<p>Well, as the Prime Minister said, there were calculations in relation</p>
<p> to gambling and we have a proposal which ensures the punter payouts</p>
<p> will be the same and that the State taxes will be reduced to the extent</p>
<p> that the GST operates and that the Commonwealth will make up the difference.</p>
<p> In relation to the business conveyance material, as the Prime Minister</p>
<p> said, it will take some work by the States to disaggregate what relates</p>
<p> to real property and what relates to business intangibles. And once</p>
<p> that work is done then the States themselves agree that there will</p>
<p> be phased withdrawal. Because one of the reasons for the phased withdrawal,</p>
<p> the second reason was that the States want to ensure that they do</p>
<p> it in some kind of sync so that they maintain competitive positions</p>
<p> as amongst themselves.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>So, Mr Costello, that would seem to indicate that the States did have</p>
<p> a point after all in their objections to the impact on the gambling</p>
<p> tax by your concession?</p>
<p>TREASURER:</p>
<p>No. In relation to both of these issues what it indicates is that</p>
<p> more detailed data is required. In relation to the stamp duties on</p>
<p> business conveyances, of course, the Commonwealth doesn't know</p>
<p> how to disaggregate those between intangibles and tangibles and the</p>
<p> Commonwealth worked off figures which were supplied by one of the</p>
<p> States and the other States don't believe that they are necessarily</p>
<p> right. So, they are all going to do their own calculations in relation</p>
<p> to that and hopefully get to an agreed position. In relation to gambling</p>
<p> it's rather a circular transaction, once you apply GST and reduce</p>
<p> transactional taxes the money goes around the circle because the GST</p>
<p> comes back to the States in any event.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, what's the sticking point in trying to agree with</p>
<p> the Senate on the shape of an inquiry?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, there's no sticking point. We just want a situation where</p>
<p> there is adequate time for the issue to be debated and voted on before</p>
<p> the 30th of June. And I am, sort of, I have a sneaking</p>
<p> suspicion there are one or two Senators who don't want that to</p>
<p> happen and I can't understand why. But I think there are a few</p>
<p> who have that, sort of, wicked thought in mind and we are trying to</p>
<p> ensure that the votes of the Senate, the Senate has a cast on this</p>
<p> important legislation as soon as possible in accordance with the wishes</p>
<p> of the Australian people.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>So, what's the latest date that you'll accept ...?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I am not going to, sort of, lay down final dates, I am simply</p>
<p> saying the general principle, Michelle, is that we have said we would</p>
<p> have an inquiry, it should be a sensible inquiry but it should not</p>
<p> be an inquiry that burns up so much time that you don't have</p>
<p> proper time left for sensible debate and a vote to be taken before</p>
<p> the 30th of June.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>But you'd be willing to compromise on the wide terms of reference?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I have laid down the principle, I am not getting into dates or precise</p>
<p> terms of reference. There are discussions to be held, there have been</p>
<p> discussions held, the Treasurer's been conducting those in conjunction</p>
<p> with the acting Leader of the Government in the Senate and the Manager</p>
<p> of Government Business in the Senate. I have full confidence in their</p>
<p> conduct of those negotiations. Our objective remains to get a situation</p>
<p> where we can have a sensible debate, an adequate debate but a vote</p>
<p> before the 30th of June. Now, there are some in the Senate</p>
<p> who want to frustrate that because they thumb their nose at the wishes</p>
<p> of the Australian people. We want a vote taken before the 30th</p>
<p> of June.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, certainly Senator Harradine wouldn't be amongst</p>
<p> those Senators who....</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, I wouldn't put Senator Harradine in that category at all.</p>
<p> I think Senator Harradine is an admirable and a constructive and co-operative</p>
<p> Senator. I have always found my dealings with him to be of a highly</p>
<p> positive kind and I am thinking more of people who belong to larger</p>
<p> aggregations, people who belong to the Labor Party, for example, and</p>
<p> people who belong to the Australian Democrats. I think they have this,</p>
<p> sort of, wicked notion that the whole thing should be delayed. I think</p>
<p> once you have had an election and the people have said yes you ought</p>
<p> to get on with the job and that's what the Australian public</p>
<p> wants.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Senator Harradine is still talking about not just food and education</p>
<p> but also what he calls the necessities of life, like shelter. Would</p>
<p> you be prepared to engage him on that?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>When the....if and when the time comes for me to have a discussion</p>
<p> with Senator Harradine about this issue I will as always that matches</p>
<p> my courtesy to him, conduct it in private on a personal basis and</p>
<p> without the glare of publicity.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Mr Costello, did you receive the Foss report today and what does it</p>
<p> say?</p>
<p>TREASURER:</p>
<p>I haven't actually physically received it today but I believe</p>
<p> I will receive it today, so I am told. But I am sitting in my office</p>
<p> waiting for it. I'll be putting out a statement, I think, once</p>
<p> I do receive it just acknowledging its receipt.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Will you release the report?</p>
<p>TREASURER:</p>
<p>Well, I am going to read it first. But let me see what's in it</p>
<p> before I answer that question.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, you are going to Malaysia on Sunday, how confident are</p>
<p> you that the APEC meeting will achieve the kind of results that you</p>
<p> hope from it?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, it's going to take place in a difficult environment, that's</p>
<p> true. It's not as propitious as the environment in which the</p>
<p> last APEC meeting took place but there are a lot of people going to</p>
<p> that meeting, such as myself, who are committed to making it work.</p>
<p> And I am hopeful that it will be a successful meeting, we'll</p>
<p> certainly be trying very hard to keep APEC true to the principles</p>
<p> on which it was established and for the meeting to try and send some</p>
<p> kind of signal to the region that, despite recent difficulties, it</p>
<p> ought to plough ahead. I mean, one of the great strengths that I will</p>
<p> take to that meeting is that I will go as the Prime Minister of the</p>
<p> country whose economy has performed outstandingly well in very difficult</p>
<p> circumstances. And I don't think that one can, you know, be reluctant</p>
<p> in emphasising just how strong the Australian economy is in very difficult</p>
<p> times. The statements made by the Reserve Bank and the Treasury recently,</p>
<p> the job numbers yesterday, although they are only one month's</p>
<p> figure and I don't engage in any phoney triumphalism about them</p>
<p> but they are nonetheless very good figures, the very solid growth,</p>
<p> the very solid business investment, the rise in consumer confidence.</p>
<p> All of these things speak of an economy that is still going ahead</p>
<p> very, very powerfully and is obviously weathering the Asian storm</p>
<p> better than most thought and our critics dared to imagine. So that</p>
<p> will give Australia a lot of strength and a lot of clout and a lot</p>
<p> of authority but we need others to agree with us and co-operate with</p>
<p> us and I hope that we can get that co-operation.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Have you had any communication with President Clinton about the Iraq</p>
<p> situation?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>We've had some communication at a minister  Defence Minister</p>
<p> level. I've not personally spoken to President Clinton but my</p>
<p> office has been in quite regular contact with the White House and</p>
<p> I'll no doubt discuss the matter with him in Kuala Lumpur but</p>
<p> I understand that the Defence Secretary has been in contact with Mr</p>
<p> Moore...</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>But you're sure he'll go - that he'll be there?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>My latest information is that he'll be there but that can always</p>
<p> change. I've got no indication that it will change, but circumstances</p>
<p> can always arise. I think I was due to play a bilateral visit to Malaysia</p>
<p> earlier this year and at the last moment I had to cancel that because</p>
<p> of the imminence of the decision that the Australian government took</p>
<p> on Australian forces going to the Gulf. I know on that subject probably</p>
<p> no more than you do. I expect to see President Clinton there, but</p>
<p> the question of whether some event intervenes to prevent his going,</p>
<p> well, we'll just have to wait and see.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Are you confident the RAAF jet will get you there?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, let me assure you that according to the best advice I have from</p>
<p> the Defence department, your Prime Minister is safe and of equal importance,</p>
<p> your Press Gallery will be safe too.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister you've made some complimentary remarks about Senator</p>
<p> Harradine a few minutes ago. Would you extend the same sort of compliments</p>
<p> to Senator Colston and his new role?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, my relationship with Senator Colston is different from my relationship</p>
<p> with Senator Harradine, but more interestingly is the relationship</p>
<p> of the most recently, or one of the most recently elected Labor Premiers.</p>
<p> I mean, I suppose you would have to say that the second most powerful</p>
<p> Labor politician in Australia thinks it is perfectly legitimate to</p>
<p> deal directly with Senator Colston, to speak of his long 25 year friendship</p>
<p> with Senator Colston and to seek the support of the Senator to advance</p>
<p> the interests of the State that they have in common. In other words,</p>
<p> Peter Beattie doesn't mind dealing with Mal Colston, it really</p>
<p> does make Kim Beazley's attitude and the unnecessarily acrimonious</p>
<p> and vituperative language that continues to be used against Senator</p>
<p> Colston by Senator Faulkner and others look very poor and rather tawdry.</p>
<p> I mean to read that language again in the cold light of day it really</p>
<p> is completely over the top. It is belittling of the men who utter</p>
<p> the language and I just don't think anybody deserves that kind</p>
<p> of calumny. He's been charged with certain offences. That's</p>
<p> a matter for the processes of the courts and I have got nothing more</p>
<p> to say about that.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, do you think that you'll meet Anwar's wife</p>
<p> in Kuala Lumpur. There was a report today that she was interested</p>
<p> in meeting you. Do you think that would be overly provocative or do</p>
<p> you think it might be informative about some of the legal machinations</p>
<p> behind Anwar's arrest...?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I don't at this stage have any intention, any plan to meet</p>
<p> her, but it's not impossible that she may meet some other Australian</p>
<p> or some other Australian representative. I don't know, that's</p>
<p> a matter to be looked at. I will, of course, have a large number of</p>
<p> bilateral meetings. She has written to me, I have responded to that</p>
<p> letter, well, I have acknowledged receipt of that letter. It's</p>
<p> a difficult issue, you are aware of the concerns that I have expressed</p>
<p> and I don't retreat from those concerns. On the other hand, there</p>
<p> is a bilateral relationship to be looked after and it's important</p>
<p> that the state of that bilateral relationship be uppermost in people's</p>
<p> minds because that will survive and the need for it will survive way</p>
<p> beyond the occupancy of current offices by current leaders. That's</p>
<p> in the nature of political leadership and I just think that it is</p>
<p> very important that we understand that Australia does have a special</p>
<p> relationship with Malaysia and what might be appropriate in the dealings</p>
<p> between an American President or a Canadian Prime Minister and a Malaysian</p>
<p> Prime Minister don't automatically apply in relations...to</p>
<p> relations between an Australian Prime Minister and a Malaysian Prime</p>
<p> Minister.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Is that meeting bedded down now, Mr Howard?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Which one?</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>The one with Dr Mahathir?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I am so advised. As far as I am concerned I will be making time available.</p>
<p> JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>But in terms of....?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes, we have an arrangement, yes. Have you heard something else? You</p>
<p> never know, I like to check! Now, I think we have just about exhausted</p>
<p> it have we? Thank you very much. I'll see you on the plane, those</p>
<p> of you who are coming.</p>
