PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA SUNDAY, 8 JULY 1979<br />
ETHNIC LIAISON OFFICER SCHEME<br />
The Prime Minister announced today that a report from the<br />
Public Service Board on the overall effectiveness of the<br />
Ethnic Liaison officer Scheme had concluded that the Scheme<br />
was proving useful and the Government had therefore decided<br />
that the Scheme should continue.<br />
The Scheme is a reflection of the Government's concern for the<br />
ethnic communities and its obligation to ensure that migrants<br />
enjoy their full rights and benefits. It was introduced in March<br />
1978 following an undertaking made in my Election Policy Speech<br />
of 21 November 1977 that Ethnic Liaison Officers would be<br />
appointed to Departments and statutory authorities.<br />
The Report from the Public Service Board concluded that the<br />
Scheme is more relevant to some Commonwealth organisations<br />
than others. Accordingly, the emphasis now will be to develop<br />
the Scheme in those organisation where that relevance is<br />
greatest. The Government has also established an Interdepartmental<br />
Working Group ( drawn from Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, the<br />
Public Service Board and Prime Minister and Cabinet) to monitor<br />
the further development of the Scheme and provide a report<br />
towards the end of 1980.<br />
Mr. Fraser announced that future responsibility for the<br />
Scheme's management and development had been placed under<br />
the Immigration and Ethnic Affairs portfolio.*<br />
