Fax from 18 October 1996 TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIMEF MINISTER<br />
THE HON JOHN HOWARD MP<br />
PRJESS CONFERENCE WREST POINT HOTEL CASINO<br />
E&amp; OE<br />
PRIME MINISTER:-<br />
Well ladies and gentlemen I'm delighted in the presence of the Tasmanian Pemier, Mr Tony Rundle and<br />
the Minister for [ Idustr1y, Sciea and Touism, John Moore, to announce * hat Peter Nixon, the former<br />
Minister in the Fraser Government and senior mnember of the Rational Party has agreed to undertake, what<br />
I thinkc can fairly be described as the 1996 version of the tndblazing inqu~ iry into the Tz-manian economy<br />
by Sir Bede Callaghan back in 1977.<br />
In 1977 the Fraser Government recognising some of the paricular competitive die advantages of Tasmania<br />
established an inquiry into ways in which particular measures could be taken to respond to that competitive<br />
disadvantage. And out of that inquiry came a number of measures that over The years have helped to<br />
remove the disadvantage suffered by Tasynanianz through no fault of Their owi, but because of the<br />
geographic isolation of Tasmartia from the mainland and so-ne of the other characieristics of the Tasmanian<br />
economy. Peter Nixon has agreed to chair this inquiry and with the ntws release Fin putting out now the terms of<br />
reference are amaehc&amp; The inquiry will report to the Govcrnmcnts, thie two Government,-by June of nex<br />
y~ ear. The Secretariat for the inquiry will be located here in Hobart within the Premier's Dep== rnr In<br />
securing the services of Peter Nixon for this inquiry we have a person who not only has a wealth of<br />
experience in politics but he also has a wealth of experience in business. And he'll bring to that inquiry' a<br />
ver deep understaniding I think of what's possible to be done but equally the limits on Governmnt<br />
intervention in areas of this nature and the purpose of the inquiry will be to revicw the economic and<br />
compet ivt: positian of the State. 18/ 10/ 96 16: 51 Pg: </p>

The detision to conduct the inquiry follows representation by Tasmanian Coalition members during thc<br />
election campaign and funding of it was announced by thie Treasurer in the recent Budget. Arnd the study<br />
will provide advicc to both Tasmanian uad the redetal1 Governmuent on how Tasmania can best use its<br />
reswiTCes. And the study is particularly enjoined to0 inquire into and report om industry development and<br />
employment in Tasmania. it will be asked to draw on and update the pre~ ious study amiongst other things it<br />
will identify' areas or sectrs in which the Tasmanian economy has or can develop a 3ustainable,<br />
compedhive advantage and the resultant oportunities for an impetus tD sustainable employment growth.<br />
There's little doubi that for some time Tasmanian has faced a particular challenge in the area of<br />
employment especially amongst its young and the desire of the present Government of Tasminaa to address<br />
some of those problems is another reason why the Federal Government has decided to announce this<br />
inquiry. I believe that Peter Nixon will do an excellent job and I and L know the Premier will look forward<br />
very warmly to the results of that inquiry.<br />
JOURNALSTWhat will it cost Prime Minister<br />
PIME MWISTER;<br />
Well there's bee a sum of 5 150 000 allocated out of the reviews being fumnded from the Budget allocation<br />
of $ 150 000. Obviously if it ends up costing more than that then we'll make additional funds available.<br />
JOURNALIST: Could it lead to the reduction of any zxlsting subsidies of cqualisation schemes?<br />
PRIE MiNISTER.<br />
Well we're not into the business of = aking them away. But look I don't want to pre-empt I mean the<br />
purpose of the inquiry I me= n it's not a Trojan horse to take something away I mean let me make that<br />
very clear certainly nOt. We're in the business of trying to help but help within reasonable and proper<br />
constraitts. Beyond saying that don't really want to pre-emrpt wha Nixon is going to have to say. I<br />
unders ad that he's coming down here next week and there will be an opportunity for somo of you who<br />
are hart today, based here in Ilobart. to have anoter talk to him about some of thim details of the inquiry.<br />
JOURNALLST: Prime Minimte the AGE McNair Poll has Jackie Kelly well in the lead in Lindsay. You can't really keep<br />
claiming to be the underdogs now can you?<br />
PPLM MINISTER:<br />
Well Russell I draw your attention to the history of by-ectinns. They normally comprise swings on<br />
averge of four to five per cent against the incumbent Government Lindsay traditionally has been a Labor<br />
seat. It was the third most spectacular victory an the 2nd of March; the swing there was exceeded only by<br />
the swing in the neighbouring seat of Macaiur anid in tho seat of Bowman in Queenland.<br />
I sin concerned That the Labor candidate will sneak back through courtey of the preferences of minor<br />
parties such as the AAF1 and the Shooters ? mry. And I'd say to the people of Lindsay if you don't wat to<br />
bring back the bloke you rejcted seven months ao, the most effective way of doing that is to vot duety<br />
for Jackie Kelly and don't waste your votes through an independent otherwise your goal In denying the<br />
reurn of N&amp; Free will not be achieved&amp; </p>

I've seen the polls but I also know the history of by-eleetions and I always back my own instinc= a lizzl bit<br />
in these things. I'm coneemcd that the desire of a lot of people t0 give Jackie Kelly a tbi go and that's<br />
what I think ought to happen. T mean she's only had seven months and she was knocked out on a<br />
technicality. A lot of people fnd it rather strange that that exists, but it exist, It's the law, 3nd I think it has<br />
affonted the fair go sensitivities of a lot of people and I just ask the people of Lindsay to Sive the lady a<br />
fair go and put her backt, she's worked had and I hope they do. But I'm concerned abou those minor pary<br />
preftrences. JOURNALTST<br />
You're not suggestng Wr Howard that your private pollig is showing something different ftom % whts in<br />
the published polls.<br />
PRIME MMNSTER:<br />
Well I think it's lI mean, my unzderstanding I haven't refrshed myself in the lagt couple of days but<br />
tink our private polling shows a tighter result than what's in McNair. Look, I'm not saying that our<br />
privatc polling shows the Labor Party is a mile in front, but my recollection is that the private polling<br />
shows a xighrc situation, yes. I mean, I am saying that, yes a righter situation.<br />
= o JOUR. NALTST:<br />
Not a witnmn situation?<br />
PRIM INISTER.<br />
No. very, very close. Very close when you have a proper distribution of preferences see, you can't<br />
allocate preferences fifty-fifty when you've got the anti-immigration p'oup saying give your prafmrnca to<br />
Labor ahead of Liberal.<br />
JOURNALIST: What impact, if any, do you expect after The week you've had in Parliament this, week over the ininistarial<br />
shares to have on Lindsay,<br />
PRIM MLSTER:<br />
Well I suppose I could wnwer that ini a more educated fashion on Sunday morning. I don't know. I do<br />
know that a lot of people have been ringing up my office in Sydne~ y mrd saying :" what's it all about, they<br />
haven't done anything wrong, they haven't stolen any money, they haven't been dishonest, they haven't<br />
been improper.-why can't you own a few share?" I mean, that is a bit of a reaction that's dcveloping in<br />
theecommnity. Aridcan say on d ubject hat I fidiqute rzing thtthismoring the Leader of<br />
the Opposition has made this rermarkble s= tceazn on radio. He said:-" you are not obliged to get out. of'<br />
* your businesses or Set out of your shareholdings or whatever-" I repeat that " you arc not obliged to get<br />
out of your buisinesses or get out of your shiarcholdings or whatever, wbat you're obliged to do is be carefi<br />
when there is an apparent likelihood of a conflict of interest" I mean, if you're not obliged to get out of'<br />
your shareholding3, you're not obliged to get out of your business, all you're obliged to do Is To worry<br />
about potential conficts of ufltere^ t and if two days earlier he ackntowledges there's no evidence of<br />
* impropriety, I me= n what's the fellow been going on about for the past few days. I Tnen, why did he<br />
attack Timn Fiscer, why did he attack John Moore if he believes you're not obliged to get out of shares or<br />
get our of businesses if it looked to conflict of' interet situations? Because every time ther was a<br />
possibility of a conflict of interest t c= n toll you because I was there I mean, Thm Fischer just kept<br />
saying BWT shares, I've got some.* I mean. it's a ridiculous situation. I mean, thin really is quite an<br />
SWe've had four days of this and now you've got the Leader of the Opposition the chief<br />
a : 7 =! 7 </p>
<p>Fax from : 18/ 10/ 96 16: 51 Pg: 4<br />
.4.<br />
prosecutor saying in successive days, firstly, no improprity is being alleged and secondly, you are not<br />
obliged to 0-etoeur of your businesses or get out of your shareholdings or whatever. What you're obliged to<br />
do is be careful % hcn there is an apparent 11ikelihood of a conflict. Well, in those cfrcurnstnnces I say to Wr<br />
Beazley, why did you attack the Deputy Prime Mintister? 0 Why did you attack the Minister for Tndustry?<br />
Why havc you wasted so much time on this Issue? I mean, this man can't be taken seriously and I think<br />
increasingly that may well filter through to the rest of the Australian community. But David, the answer to<br />
your question will well we may or may not have it on Sunday but it's always very hard to make a<br />
jadgcrnenL. I still thiink out there people are they're looking for thc substace and they don't see any<br />
evidence of chicanery or impropriety, they don' 1 see anybody having becn dishontest, and they even have<br />
the Leader of the Opposirion saying that thcy haven't been dishones and now that they shouldn't b~ ve got<br />
rid ofthbeir businesses or their shame.<br />
JOURNALIST: Andrew Robb says that it's been a bad week, and there seems to be a concession there at least that it could<br />
make things mome difficult for the coalition in Lindsay. Would you concede that that this wyeek does<br />
make PRIME MINISTER:<br />
I say what I've said.<br />
JO) URNALIST:<br />
Prime Minister, do you in any sense though accept the by-election is a litmus test of bow your<br />
Oovernment's going?<br />
PIM MINISTER:<br />
Ask me tha oii Sunday mrning~.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Roward would you be nurrised ifthe reasons the voters of Lindsay tossed Labor our have dissipated so<br />
quickly over six months and they're prepared toput Labor back into the seat?<br />
PRIM MI1NISTER:<br />
Nothing ever surprises me completely in politIcs. I will be very disappointed if Jackie doesn't win because<br />
she deserves a fair go.<br />
JOURNAIST; Prime Minister, in the context of the debame over race, if the Labor Party wins on Saturday on AAEI<br />
prcfthres, what would be your view about the quality of that win?<br />
PRIM MINISTER6.<br />
Well, I have said what I've said about their deal with the AAFI and however they try and walk away from<br />
it, theme was a I think It is a touch hypocritical to allege that we're not robust enough in condemning<br />
those Australians who might have racist tendencies, which incidentally I don't think there are a large<br />
nunbabut them re soueand thnin the ixttbreath do adeal with theAAF. 7 think Iwould rather<br />
ith ; et into posailble responses to hypothetical outcomes. I'l wait and see what the result is and then [' ll<br />
make a comment on the result. r can only again expmes the hope that people who don't warn m put back a </p>
<p>Fax from failed candidae of only seven months ago, that they don't waste their vote on an Independent and they<br />
vote directly for the Liberal candidate.<br />
JOURNALIST: Would you describe the Australians Against Further mmigration Party as a racist group?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well, I've secen somec of the material that the organisation's put out. I thInk it appeared in an article written<br />
by one of my interrogators here and if that is a fair representation of its material, it's a pretty distasteful<br />
organisatlon. JOURNALIST: But Prune Minister. Grueme Campbell says it was he who brokered the deal on preferences and not the<br />
Labor Party, what do you say to that?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well you can't have a deal unless two people are in agreement.<br />
JOURNALIST: Well he says it was he and the AAFI that organised...<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Yes, but hang on, they're not the two parties to the agreement.<br />
JOURNALIST:<br />
No. but he says he...<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well who was he acting for? He knows a few people in the Labor Parry doesn't he?<br />
JOURNALIST: Yes, he used to be a member of the Labor Party...<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Thaz's right and he has close associations with another member of the Labor Paty from his ow State<br />
doesn't he?<br />
JOURNALIST: And Pauline Hanson used to be a member of the Liberal Party. 18/ 10/ 96 16: 51 Pg: </p>
<p>Fax from -6.<br />
PRLME MD'fSTER.<br />
Well exactly I'm not denyin that, we're open about that, but we Backed her in three hours, he lasted 13<br />
years. JOURNALISTOua the shares issue, hAve your previous actions and the actionls of this week made it practically impossible<br />
for Ministers to hold shmue?<br />
PRZZ~ i MINISTER:<br />
Well I wvoold trust. not and I don't believe so. And now that I have the endorsement of the Leader of the<br />
Opposition that it is not wrong to own sharm and you don't have to get rid of them or your business. I<br />
mean, what he said here is you can bang on to your business and you cmn hang on to your shares, all you<br />
have to worry about is a potential conflict of tnterest. I would have thought we've got the basis of a<br />
bipartisan understanding.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister. the words you just read out from Mr Betizley, didn't you say all you have to do is 6e<br />
careful and isn't that your charge that you made the other day is that you were apologising to the<br />
Australian people because some of your Ministers had been careless, is that the issue?<br />
PUM MINISTER:<br />
Look, obviously I would have rather -rie or two people read the guidelines marm closely but those people<br />
have paid fairly dearly. But that hasn't altered the fact that you now have, at the end of the week in which<br />
he spent time talking about nothing else, you've got the Leader of the Opposition sayingr two things: firstly,<br />
&amp; noim propriety by my min~ sers or former minist= s' and that of coums is the case; Qn secondly, he's not<br />
saying you've got to got rid of your business or get out of your sh =. holdings or whatever, what you're<br />
obliged to do is be careful when there is an apparent likeliood of a conflict. Now, I don't disagree with<br />
that, I agree with that and tat's the whole thing, you've got to be, but I uin= I can say in relation to<br />
peple like Tim Fischer, even in the rumotcst situation Tirn would say, ' look, you should understand I've<br />
got some BHP shares, I may have a conflict of interest,' anid that is precisely what I'm tailking about.<br />
JOURNALISTH-ow does his declaring that to Cabinet negate any potential conflict of interest?<br />
PRIME MINSTER:<br />
Well it's not wrong to have a conflict of inmeest, you've just got to make certain that people know about it<br />
and that your behaviour in the light of that declaz'ation is judged against the background of that conflict of<br />
interst In some circumnstaces you~ would excJso yourself from: malcinS the decision, or if you arm in n<br />
Cabinet meeting people would rakc a decision in the full knowledge of your interest I mean, I can<br />
remeiihber circumstances where I've heard Ministers in very remote situations say. ' look, I such and<br />
such and that may involve a conflict of interest.' I mean, none of us can avoid some potentis conflict of<br />
interetm, the Important tbing is to declare them and In appropriate circumstances niot to involve yourself in<br />
the decision-making process. And in every caue that I can reca In the cuse certinly in relation to Mr<br />
Fischer, he, if anything, he erred on the side of caution as you should, in declaig the interest and rm<br />
absIutly certain that, in doing so, he complied in every partcular with thr. roquirvtontns.<br />
AM Fa om18/ 10/ 96 16: 51 Pg: 6 </p>
<p>Fax from Labor Prime Ministers stated coming to this very building some years ago and they never got struck by<br />
lighbting on the way. What does that say about your visit?<br />
PR MINISTER;<br />
Well, I suppose you could say I was destined to finally get here, If my memory of Australian politics<br />
serves me well, a not incredibly fortane Labor Opposition Leader once came to Hobart and attended a<br />
Natioral Conference of the Australian Labor Party that lead to the great split. I think, in fact, it was in<br />
1955 the Labor Party had its conference here which lead, a few months laWer, to the formation of the Anti.<br />
Comnnunist Labor Parry that ultimately became the Democratic Labor Party. If you're asking me about<br />
last night, it was what you might say a jolting end to the week.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, ean I just ask you about the damaSge to Parliament House? 7 Jcnn'e. Oeorge said today that<br />
she believes the Federal Government has put the ACT up to this damages bill of S89,000 chat ' s gone to the<br />
unions. Is there anything in that and what should happen?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Well I pay my bills and so should the ACTU.<br />
ends 18/ 18/ 96 16: 51 Pg: 7<br />
* 7-<br />
JOURNALIST: Has he ever followed that declaration with excusing himself from a vote?<br />
PRIME MINISTER:<br />
TIn some cases he may have. took, I'd have to go back and look at the record. I don't carry... you know. I<br />
haven't got a photog aphic memory, but I do know he makes a regular habit whenever something comes<br />
up, no matter how remotc the connection. So I mean, the law isn't the practice isn't that you mustn't ever<br />
have a potential conflict of interest You must be mindful of it, you must declare it and you must take steps<br />
to ensure that your conduct can't be criticised as having put private interesm ahead of public duty. Now<br />
Kim Beazley), has endorsed that principle. I thank him for it warmly and we now have the bipartisan basis<br />
for an intelligent approach To this matter. Thank you very much.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister before you go.<br />
PRTM MINISTER:<br />
Yes Peter.<br />
JOURNALIST: </p>
