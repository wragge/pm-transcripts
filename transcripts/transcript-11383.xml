    <content><![CDATA[<p>E&amp;OE....................</p>
<p>  Well, thank you very much, Janet; to my colleague, Senator Jocelyn Newman;</p>
<p>   to Kerry Chikarovski, the Leader of the New South Wales Opposition, Mr and</p>
<p>   Mrs Paul Batchelor, Sara O'Hare, other distinguished guests, ladies and</p>
<p>   gentlemen.</p>
<p>  Can I say, I'm sure on behalf of everybody, how impressive is this gathering</p>
<p>   and it's an opportunity for me to congratulate all of those responsible</p>
<p>   for organising this breakfast. Janet McDonald brings an indefatigable degree</p>
<p>   of energy to any of the activities in which she's involved and her commitment</p>
<p>   to the cause of raising support for and greater awareness of the threat</p>
<p>   posed to women's health by breast cancer is well known and widely appreciated.</p>
<p>  I just want to say two things to you this morning. Firstly, to emphasise</p>
<p>   to all of you how the Federal Government shares the concern of the many</p>
<p>   organisations represented here today in the fight against breast cancer</p>
<p>   within the Australian community. It is the biggest single threat to women's</p>
<p>   health in the area of cancer. It is the leading cause of cancer related</p>
<p>   deaths amongst Australian women and one in twelve Australian women will</p>
<p>   develop breast cancer at some stage in their lifetime. And by promoting</p>
<p>   awareness of it and by speaking openly of the ways in which it can be guarded</p>
<p>   against and detected and successfully treated all of us are engaged in a</p>
<p>   very commendable community service.</p>
<p>  There are many things that I would like the Government to be seen to be</p>
<p>   doing in a positive light. And one of the most important is our commitment</p>
<p>   to health and medical research. In the last budget the Treasurer announced</p>
<p>   that over the next four years we will double the amount of Federal Government</p>
<p>   money going into health and medical research throughout Australia. And it</p>
<p>   followed the recommendations of the committee chaired by Peter Wills, a</p>
<p>   well known Sydney businessman, and virtually all of his recommendations</p>
<p>   were adopted so that over the next four years it will be an exact doubling</p>
<p>   of the amount of Federal Government money going to all forms of health and</p>
<p>   medical research.</p>
<p>  Coming a little closer to home many will be aware that I announced some</p>
<p>   seven or eight months ago the Federal Government would contribute $3 million</p>
<p>   to the integrated cancer programme which is a joint initiative between the</p>
<p>   Sydney Cancer Centre and the Centenary Institute. And when it became apparent</p>
<p>   recently that the New South Wales Government was unable to match that $3</p>
<p>   million I indicated to the centre that the Federal Government would provide</p>
<p>   the entire amount of $6 million.</p>
<p>  We have honoured our election commitment to provide a $4.1 million initiative</p>
<p>   to specialised health care for women diagnosed with breast cancer. And this</p>
<p>   initiative will provide support services for women diagnosed with breast</p>
<p>   cancer including specialised health care. And it will be focussed particularly</p>
<p>   on women living in regional and rural areas.</p>
<p>  And, of course, Professor Redman's already referred to the Commonwealth</p>
<p>   and State programme of breast screening, breast cancer screening throughout</p>
<p>   Australia. And this is a breast cancer screening programme providing free</p>
<p>   screening mammograms at two year intervals targeted at women aged 50 to</p>
<p>   69 through a network of dedicated accredited screening and assessment services.</p>
<p>  The other thing I wanted to say, and it brings me very much to the point</p>
<p>   of an announcement, and that is that I have in the time that I've been Prime</p>
<p>   Minister endeavoured to foster within the Australian community the notion</p>
<p>   of a social coalition to tackle the challenges and the problems of our community.</p>
<p>   And that's built on the belief that the Government can't do everything acting</p>
<p>   alone. Individuals acting alone can't do everything. Business acting alone</p>
<p>   can't do everything and nor can the great volunteer organisations for which</p>
<p>   Australia is renowned acting alone can they do everything. And what we need</p>
<p>   is to harness the resources of those four sections of our community - the</p>
<p>   Government, individuals, the business community and volunteer organisations</p>
<p>   each contributing those resources and talents they can best contribute towards</p>
<p>   tackling social and other problems.</p>
<p>  And I have been very keen to promote a greater level of philanthropy within</p>
<p>   the Australian community. It's not a question so much of business giving</p>
<p>   more but it's really a question of more businesses giving. There are some</p>
<p>   wonderful examples and many of them are represented here today. The sponsorship</p>
<p>   of this breakfast, the wonderful examples of companies such as Estee Lauder</p>
<p>   and many others that are so supportive of great causes within our community.</p>
<p>   So I am not suggesting for a moment that many businesses don't already give</p>
<p>   and give very generously but we'd naturally like more of them to do so.</p>
<p>  And it's in that spirit that I am absolutely delighted to announce this</p>
<p>   morning that an important partnership in relation to breast cancer has been</p>
<p>   facilitated by a generous donation of $1.1 million by the AMP Society. And</p>
<p>   the AMP foundation has confirmed a $1.1 million partnership with the National</p>
<p>   Health and Medical Research National Breast Cancer Centre. So I want to</p>
<p>   congratulate Mr Batchelor. And this partnership reflects the very spirit</p>
<p>   of a social coalition of which I spoke. And the partnership will fund key</p>
<p>   projects of direct and lasting benefits to the community. The projects comprise</p>
<p>   a public information program about breast cancer symptoms, a communications</p>
<p>   skills training program, a breast health survey for 2000, and partial funding</p>
<p>   for printing costs of consumer resources.</p>
<p>  May I just conclude, ladies and gentlemen, by saying that at a personal</p>
<p>   level and at a Government level I am very committed to the cause which is</p>
<p>   being supported here this morning. The cause of tackling and identifying</p>
<p>   the fundamental health challenges for women within the Australian community</p>
<p>   is now widely recognised and supported within our community. It has the</p>
<p>   total support of the Government, it had the support might I acknowledge,</p>
<p>   of the former government because it is one of those things which is above</p>
<p>   party politics. And I think it is very important at a gathering such as</p>
<p>   this we acknowledge the need for an open assessment of the particular health</p>
<p>   risks that women face, the need for open and informed dialogue and discussion</p>
<p>   and information within our community. A willingness of governments at both</p>
<p>   the State and federal level to support a community involvement, active screening</p>
<p>   programmes to identify women at risk and, of course, a determined commitment</p>
<p>   of resources to the cause of research.</p>
<p>  The last 25 years have seen astonishing advances in the area of health and</p>
<p>   medical research as there have been astonishing advances in the area of</p>
<p>   information technology. As we throw towards the first part of the next millennium</p>
<p>   we can all hope, and I think with a degree of confidence, to predict that</p>
<p>   one of the distinguishing features of the first 25 years of the new millennium</p>
<p>   will be a further inroad into the great health challenges that beset the</p>
<p>   modern world. And tackling through dedicated and committed resources to</p>
<p>   research the scourge of cancer within our community, whether it be breast</p>
<p>   cancer or any other form of cancer, will be at the forefront of that effort.</p>
<p>  And the focus on that this morning is therefore very appropriate, very timely</p>
<p>   and very well targeted and I thank you all particularly the AMP who is represented</p>
<p>   here this morning by its new Managing Director, Mr Batchelor. I particularly</p>
<p>   thank the AMP and many others for their great generosity towards this very</p>
<p>   worthy cause.</p>
