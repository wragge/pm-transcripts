I warmly welcome President Clinton's announcement that Mr John H Dalton, Secretary of the Navy in the Government of the United States of America, Mrs Margaret Dalton and Ambassador Edward Perkins Will be his personal representatives for Australia-America Friendship Week. </p>
<p>Mr and Mrs Dalton will visit Australia from 7 to 12 May. They will participate in various Friendship Week activities and attend a number of Battle of the Coral Sea commemorative events in both Canberra and Adelaide. Mr Dalton Lfety will also hold discussions on Australia-United States relations with senior members of the Government. </p>
<p>The Battle of the Coral Sea, fought in May 1942, was a turning point of the war in the South Pacific and laid the foundation for the Australian-American he alliance. Over fifty years later, this friendship has grown deeper and stronger based on our shared democratic ideals. </p>
