PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR P) RESS 19 M 1% y 197<br />
ADDREISS TO A~ USTRA~ LIAN IBERJAL. STtJJBNTS FF-DEIATICIN, SYDNEY<br />
I have been following with intere&amp; t and enthusiasm the growing streng<br />
of your Federation in recent years. It has come a lon way &amp; ince it<br />
format-ion by my friena the late Ivor Greenwood and others some<br />
years ago. ItS recent extension to nearly all terti ary e. d11ctionul1<br />
institutions has heralded a new era of activity, v. axyirn from meat<br />
pi ep for the men of the U. S. S. TrmiXt~ n, to your camptignP to bring<br />
responsible leadership to the Australian Union of Stud-3, nts. your<br />
Pederation has built up a strong tradition of maintaiiinh; liberal<br />
ideasi amn Jt 8tudents.<br />
Liberal ideas and ideals, which originally emerged ini opy-osition to<br />
autooratic power and entrenched privilceje, are of the qrcates-t<br />
relevtince to the issues and problems fauincj contemporalcy soci ety;<br />
to the problems of human freedom; to the problems of the xelatioyslti<br />
bet-ween the inavidval and the l. arge ortjanisatio~ ns thoti domninate our<br />
society; to the problems of inequality and disadvantagej arid to the<br />
problems of achieving meaningful change and refoym.<br />
in the last 18 months since being elected, this Guvex1nmr! 7it has acted<br />
to bring about reforms which implement Liberal princ~ tj. Qes, which<br />
translate lberal~ ism into reality. We have acted to Increfi-e<br />
individual freedomi and choice, to provide effective assistance<br />
to-p-eople whki are dIsadvantaqcd or in yiejed, to provid eLq 1 i y co<br />
the law, to preserve fundamental civil liberties and ti--envourage<br />
inaiviadual initiativeo in the Bocial welfare area, for i-n. stance,<br />
the cornerstone of our approach has been to aivc: pr~ iority of<br />
assistance to those most in need, and mak-e-sure that aid -sprovided<br />
to people in wayfi that increase their independenc: in ways wi ch<br />
allow them to choose how they will use-the; aid to rrc s; t enit<br />
tbemHelves. Need and disadvantage is not. mere-ty a Iprcblcem of ntria<br />
It is also a matt-er of .1im-ted cho: ice,. brte3o-tu'tv An v<br />

particul arly beneficial to suich groupS' as. snqlv parentg, igirants,~<br />

it is sometimnes difficult to clotlrmine in -advance Whether a ncw programme<br />
which proiniseg to increase p'eoptD ' s choice will actually do, no. Thu E<br />
* where nece&amp; sary we hav'e been prepa. Mred to devise experimental programmes<br />
to test their effectiven ss. We-: ate, at the mroment preparing to launch<br />
1 the Housing I) Issist; Aiice r Uher Zxperiinent. This progromme<br />
will assist low income earnor's -b-.&gt; ay~ Ing to them, in cavdi, subsidies<br />
towardb the cost of their family'AJ accommodation. It is uip to them<br />
how they use such subsiaieS. They may rent housing commiasion flats or<br />
they may prefer private accommodation. The choice, and the responsibility<br />
is left to the recipient.<br />
Another experimental programme ik; our milgrant roncurcez centxe in<br />
Melbourne. Instead of the Government bureaucracy runnincj the centre,<br />
we have conitra~ ted out this responsibility to a voluntary organisation,<br />
the Greek welfare Society. Early indication&amp; are thaIt the centre is;<br />
working well and that somne other ethnic groups see the centre as a<br />
possible model for their own operations.<br />
The Government has recognised that there are many act. ivitie&amp; which<br />
public servants cannot conduct. as ef fectively as voluntary organi sati ODA,<br />
particularly the personal warmth and perfsonal assistance that many people<br />
in need or dist-ress really need. Voluntary organisation" also provide<br />
opportunities for participation and involvement tbat public bureaucracieA,<br />
because of their very structure, find it almost impossible to provide.<br />
our policy of placing greater emphasis on voluntary oxrganisations is<br />
designed to stren( gthen the capacity of voluntaryorganiisations to provide<br />
the die~ advantaqod with such opportunities. In all age in which Government<br />
hais grown considerably, notmetimes appearing to dwarf the individual<br />
citizen, suibstantial reforms have been requi red to counteract the<br />
power) esznaso that citizens feel iii thke face of thc size and power of<br />
the-Commoinwealth's bureaucracy.<br />
We have acted to ensure that people. dealing with the Government are<br />
treated fairly, promptly and accoraing to the l. aw. That adequate redres<br />
is avail; Able for those who have cjenuine grievances, and to incerease the<br />
oitizens access to infoxmittion. The first Ombudsman haS6 bL'uis ti: puisite( I<br />
and the AdminintratiVe Appebls TriI7unal has comnmencod operation. We have<br />
reformed our Court system b-y intr oducin1t h Ie new 1Federal Court, and we<br />
4re moving to simplify Court procedures and certain archaic forms of<br />
writs. We shall this year introduce freedom of informnation legjislation t~ o<br />
provide, as of rig~ ht, access to cextair, categories of infornjatinheld<br />
by Goveranent affecting individualt;. The (; ovornment has also introduced<br />
various law reforms to enhance, civil liberties. Unfortunately, they are<br />
too often taken for frantec d i n AuIPt r ali a. -Contitant vigilance AA required<br />
to isec how they Can be. ijmproved, aind itdarated as our sioiety changes.<br />
We have introduced legisilationi on criminal investigation which is-an<br />
important advance in civil i: ete. / we have </p>
<p>we have extendecl legjal aid, by reticetinq it towardts the mos[. t Li<br />
n eqt constraints in Government spending, our-a l~ ocation<br />
to leg~ al aid this year was increased We have ilnstituted land<br />
rights legislation for aboriginese Jrt the. Nvrthern Territory, We hiave<br />
undetaken to cstabli sb a Human Rights Commission to enfixrce compliance<br />
of Federal liaw with the UN nt eynati onal Covenant On ci vil and<br />
po: it i cal rights.<br />
R~ eferences have been made to the Law Reform Commission on a nuinher<br />
of iRsxeA, for eyample -proteution of pxivacy, reform of thie law of<br />
defamation, investigation of the possibility of applyin( aboriginal<br />
customary law In criminal mattekR to aboriginem~ livingq in the tradition<br />
manner. This is an iinpresiveQ list, an($ amply dleinoitratus the depth of our<br />
commni tnmenit to maintaining civil: liberties-and increasing Goveyiment ' s<br />
reg~ olsiveness to the people. Pe'rhaps even more iinporta ntly it<br />
illustrates oux ocipacity to translate that corraitrnent into reality.<br />
The GovernMent has also institxited historic political reforms.<br />
We have commencea a prograinme of pxrogrers. vely handing, over powers to<br />
the legislative territories of the Northern Territory and the hCT.<br />
We aiM to ensure full statehood for the Northern Territory by 981.<br />
We propose to strengthen the power of Parliament to scruitinise pXIIlic,<br />
expenditure. A~ s a firrt step, we have establisheed a pi~ bliu expenditure<br />
committee which has already iontone tatsk of carefully vetting;<br />
particular areas of publ ic eypenditure. And of courFee we aire<br />
committed to con % t i txtional reform.<br />
Nex: t Saturday, Australiians will vote on four propofials tie. amend the<br />
constitutio". If all four succeedl, we will at one stroke have almost<br />
doubled the number of succefiiful amnmnsto our ccrnstixtution.<br />
I Elm confident that they will succeed because the pxoposals are<br />
patently sensible, fair and just. The princ~ iples oif the four1. pxopoeials<br />
wiere supported at the Holbart Constitutionial Convetion. They are<br />
supported by all r'edvriil political parties, anel they will imp: rovc<br />
the operation of the constitution. The fo-or propos: als may be bimnply<br />
6tated and justified.<br />
Thefistproposal is that the Hourie of Representatives an Senate<br />
elections be held simultacneously. it is Simply common Psenve that<br />
these elections always 13e held at the same time; that Aiistralians<br />
should onlIy have to vote in a-)? eaeral eClCtetiJri WIIC) I Australia's<br />
Government is at stake. Unlessv thie confstitut-ion is changed, the only<br />
way to bring the elections togethey would be repeatedly to ,-ut short<br />
the term of the Hjouse of Rupresentatives. Tihe three, yeor tcrlp is<br />
howevlerxc atively short on-e of theh Mote st Parli amen) tary termst<br />
in the democratic world Puither re-duciine it would damage loc-d<br />
Uovernment. This pro-posal1 does not in any way affect the! po. w( errs c0<br />
the Senate, It In fact in) CreaSCes the auh'rYitv Of Uhe SeY. acc0 ec<br />
a bad Government for i~ t w. i. rnic ange possibl-c, to clair thtat only<br />
the lower House xieflects Ithe 1latest. w. ith) the people Vuirtnc'r, if<br />
the Senate should ever aq: 0-ukl se itS(-' all flnite wICEapon of forcli rq the L<br />
Government to the aol,. t lceaIst half the 8ernatoxs i-i thecmse: lves<br />
have to) facoe the voters to have thei4r acti onL :' fdried at the Polls,<br />
and it is only faix tHiat thiis should ocour. 1 /' PIh ue. L n a </p>
<p>Thescon re di proiJosp-l isthat whenever a Senator dies or<br />
rasigns, hie will be replaced .,_ for tile remainder of his term of office,-<br />
by a member of the Ham(-party. It wjll guarantee that your choicet<br />
of parties for the Senate cannot healt~ ered by avvident or design.<br />
U) de-r the constitution ap, it~ srd,_ Senate vacancy can completely<br />
change the party balionce. But ly
balance of the parties in the Siena b nce this propor,; a is accJepted,<br />
the peoples choice will he preerve u'li they hlave anl opportunity to<br />
make another choice at the nexI el~ in:<br />
The third referendum pr-op osal i to gi Ve Voters; in Australian<br />
Capital Territory an( I Northiern7 x itor y the basic right to vote in afll.<br />
flitlie xeferendvins. This is a-nnta right all other Australians<br />
Ita ve. I know of no rational. or7reasbliable argument for denying it to<br />
Territorial voters. They have, the . ae obliglations as other Australians..<br />
They pay taXeS; they are obliged to observe the laws of the Commonwealth;<br />
they vote for Members of Parliament; and the outcome of referendums<br />
affect themn ac4 niucli afs they do other Australians. IReStoring thi6<br />
right will strengthen Australian democracy.<br />
The fourth and final referendum proposal is to set a retiring age for<br />
Federal justices. High Cotirt Justices would retire at 70 and the<br />
retiremnent age for other Vederal Court judge3 woul. ' De dvterinined by<br />
Pairliamnent. The proposal does not affect the terma of Jiudges already<br />
appointed to the bench. Moot jobs have retirement ages, and for good<br />
reason. JvidqeG are as affected by old age as the rest of xis. This<br />
principle has long been recognisedI by the States, all of which have<br />
compulsory retiring ageR for tbeir own Jiudges. It is only fair that<br />
after the age of 70 responsibility shiould be handed over to youinger<br />
people. That is even more important, now that the new system of<br />
Federal Family Courts han been Vot up, Placing a premium-on juidges<br />
abilIity to k~ eep up with changing community.<br />
All four referendum proposals are fair, j-ost and reasonable. Trhey have<br />
been extensively cohaidezed. They have the support of all major Feaeral<br />
parties. They do not involve further power for Canberra. Thley will<br />
istrengthen the Senate and ensure that it can better look after the<br />
interests of the States, They will make the constitution work better.<br />
on Saturday, I amn sure that a clear majority of Austritliant; in is clear<br />
majority of the states will vote Yeii in theoe four referendums. But<br />
those of yoti who think the referendum propositions should be paFIsed,<br />
vannot afford to be complacent. The referendums will not pass thL-iselve~<br />
All people who care about vonstitutional and political reform in this<br />
country have a responsibility to work for the referendums. If we all<br />
do this, then the referendumu will be pass; ed, and we will have a constituition<br />
which mervets Australia's needs more effectively.<br />
The process bf change and reform in our society is a continuing one, and<br />
in thio procesg we are constantly seeliing innovative ideas which effectively<br />
translate our id~ ealB into reality.<br />
The Austrailian Students Liberal P.-eceration has a .4i( nificant role to<br />
contribute in making Australia a better and more equal society. I<br />
believe that our soci et. y has unique advantages because of the wealth<br />
of ou~ r natural regources, our history of egalitarianism and clemocratic<br />
tradition&amp;, and the general level of equxality ani. oppOrtun-ity which<br />
prevail s </p>
<p>4-4<br />
prev~ ails III AU1Stralia U I e V e I eqt lty that is unmatched in<br />
almost any other society. But our advan ages shoulid not be a cause<br />
for complacency. Rather, they. s) ti d--be a challenqe.<br />
Against this baiekgyound of coi~ rr ~,-wealth and equality, the<br />
social problern which do pers~ st in~ Aust. ialia stand out all the<br />
more sharply. We sbouuld have the ingenuity, the resources and<br />
the determination rcquir ccl to come to g; rip6 With them effectively.<br />
in our early history, Asrl ~ re aoeo h ol'<br />
motst advanced and enlightened-, em o s we have the chjancp to<br />
recapture that position by dev! f6-i ne solutions to the problems<br />
of our Bociety which put peolces wishes aind aelf-respect firnt.<br />
This is a tas~ k in whichi we need your help the help of all Australians </p>
