PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR PRESS 23 SEPTEMBER 1977<br />
BEEF, SUGAR TALKS<br />
The Prime Minister talked today to the Japanese Ambassador<br />
Mr Okawara about export of Australian beef to Japan and<br />
about the sugar agreement.<br />
Australian and Japanese officials will be meeting in Tokyo<br />
next week about future levels of Australian beef exports to<br />
Japan. These talks stem from his discussions in Kuala Lumpur<br />
last month with the Prime Minister of Japan Mr Fukuda. It had<br />
been agreed. at--tha-t meeting that officials of both countries<br />
should work closely together to devise a system which would<br />
better serve the needs for stability in trade between Japan<br />
and Australia.<br />
Mr Fraser emphasised to Mr Okawara the very great importance<br />
which Australia placed on this issue. It was essential that<br />
predictable and stable access shofild be avaialable for Australian<br />
exports of primary products. Beef production was not something<br />
which could be changed quickly. It required considerable<br />
long term investment. Sudden and dramatic restraints on<br />
Australia's capacity for export imposed by other governments<br />
were unsettling and damaging.<br />
If beef producers were to be given the necessary stability<br />
in their export markets they must know what the future market<br />
situation would be, some considerable time in advance. Six<br />
month quotas were not satisfactory.<br />
In talking with Mr Fukuda the Prime Minister had suggested that<br />
an appropriate solution might be a fixed quota plus a growth<br />
factor that might be related to beef consumption in Japan. He<br />
believed that such a quota should be considerably above the present<br />
quota. Imports in the year immediately preceding the import<br />
embargo in 1974 were 127,000 tonnes. The import quota now<br />
stands at 80,000 tonnes.<br />
The Prime Minister had been very pleased with the readiness<br />
of the Japanese Prime Minister to agree to the pursuit of<br />
greater stability, and access for Australian beef in a realistic<br />
and constructive manner by Australian and Japanese officials.<br />
He expected that with goodwill on both sides it would be possible<br />
to obtain a more secure arrangements than the one now prevailing </p>
<p>and one which would apply for the future. If that outcome<br />
was not achieved it would effect Australia's whole trading relationship<br />
with Japan.<br />
The Prime Minister also discussed the current unsatisfactory<br />
position in relation to the sugar negotiations.<br />
He strongly supported Mr Anthony's statements in Parliament<br />
this week. The Australian government endorsed the generality<br />
of CSR's case and would wish to see the matter resolved<br />
commercially if possible.<br />
However, time was running out and wider issues concerning<br />
the reliability of long term contracts as bankable documents<br />
were also significantly involved.<br />
On this issue in Kuala Lumpur the Prime Minister and Mr Fukuda<br />
had agreed that an early solution between the parties was<br />
important to both countries. </p>
