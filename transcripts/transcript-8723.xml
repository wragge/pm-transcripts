STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HOW P J KEATING, MP<br />
LEBANON; AUSTRALIAN OFFICIAL REPRESENTATION<br />
I met yesterday a delegation of Australian-Lebanese<br />
community leaders to discuss the issue of Australian<br />
official representation in Beirut and related questions<br />
concerning immigration and consular services. The<br />
delegation presented a petition urging the Government to reopen<br />
the Australian Embassy in Beirut.<br />
in response, I said that the Australian Government welcomed<br />
the improved situation in the * Lebanon, but explained there<br />
were still concerns about the s afety of diplomatic._ personnel<br />
in Beirut. In current circumstances, the cost of providing<br />
adequate protection for Australian diplomatic personnel<br />
would be prohibitive.<br />
I assured the community leaders that the Australian<br />
Government would continue to monitor the Situation<br />
carefully, and would re-establish an E mbAssy in Beirut as<br />
soon as conditions allowed. As demonstration of the<br />
Government's intention, a holding lease was being maintained<br />
on the original Embassy premises.<br />
In the meantime, the Government was making efforts to meet<br />
the concerns of the Australian-Lebanese community for better<br />
access in Lebanon to Australian immigration and consular<br />
services. Following his visit to Lebanon in September 1992, the<br />
Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic<br />
Affairs, Mr Hand, had announced that the Government would<br />
establish in Beirut a locally-staffed special office to<br />
facilitate Immigration and consular services, The purpose<br />
was to reduce the need for applicants to travel outside<br />
Lebanon to nearby Australian diplomatic missions to obtain<br />
these services. </p>

I explained to the delegation that, as part of the process<br />
of establishing the special office in Beirut, the Government<br />
was giving high priority to the selection of a panel of<br />
local doctors to remove the need for travel outside Lebanon<br />
for medical examinations.<br />
The Government expects the new arrangements will be in place<br />
in the near future. Taken together, they will mean that the<br />
ov erall need for travel outside Lebanon for immigration<br />
services will be dramatically reduced.<br />
The new arrangements will remove the need for travel outside<br />
Lebanon for routine visa applications. In cases where an<br />
interview with an Australian immigration officer is<br />
required, travel outside Lebanon will still be necessary.<br />
I assured the delegation that the new arrangements should be<br />
regarded as interim measures pending the restoration of<br />
resident Australian representation in Beirut. The<br />
Governent very much hopes that conditions In Lebanon will<br />
soon permit the re-opening of the Australian Embassy.<br />
