    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Government is pleased to launch the Anzac Centenary Public Fund with Mr Lindsay Fox AC.</p>
<p>This Fund will enable all Australians to contribute to important projects such as the national travelling exhibition, as well as major state and territory initiatives which will take place between 2014 and 2018.</p>
<p>Mr Lindsay Fox has led the fundraising efforts and we thank him for his dedication to ensuring this important period of national commemoration is appropriately marked.</p>
<p>The Government thanks the confirmed corporate donors and calls on Australia’s other corporate leaders to follow their lead and get behind this important national project.</p>
<p>Contributions to the Public Fund will ensure the Centenary of Anzac is properly commemorated, honouring the almost two million servicemen and women who have served our nation.</p>
<p>The Centenary of Anzac will be a very important period of national commemoration.</p>
<p>It will be a time to remember those who left our shores to serve their young nation abroad – those whose bravery on the beaches of Gallipoli created the Anzac legend and those who fought on the Western Front and now rest beneath its fields.</p>
<p>It will be a time to commemorate those Australians who have fought in all conflicts since.</p>
<p>The Australian Government committed $150 million to support Anzac Centenary commemorations and the Anzac Centenary Public Fund has been granted Deductible Gift Recipient Status.</p>
