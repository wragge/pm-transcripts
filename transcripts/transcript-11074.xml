    <content><![CDATA[<p>E&amp;OE.............................................................................................</p>
<p>FAINE:</p>
<p>Good morning to you Prime Minister.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Good morning John.</p>
<p>FAINE:</p>
<p>Thank you very much for coming in. The drug debate has been raging</p>
<p> now for a good six or so months. Like every other media outlet we</p>
<p> have been running endless numbers of stories and hearing from parents</p>
<p> going through agonising times. I understand you have recently been</p>
<p> talking more to parents instead of just to policy makers and people</p>
<p> who are working in the field, the professionals.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes, well yesterday one of the good things about the venue for the</p>
<p> announcement, which was the Anglicare headquarters here in Melbourne,</p>
<p> was that there were a lot of parents and addicts, or former addicts,</p>
<p> who were actually there and I talked to them for some time afterwards</p>
<p> and they detailed their experiences. And some parents still struggling</p>
<p> with the problem because their children are still on drugs and they</p>
<p> are trying to get them off them. Others who had gone through the programme</p>
<p> offered by Anglicare very successfully. One really quite inspiring</p>
<p> story of a woman and her young son and the boy had lost his father</p>
<p> through a heroin overdose some years ago and his mother had had a</p>
<p> problem as well but she was now rid of it and the boy was doing spectacularly</p>
<p> well at school. And to talk to him and to hear that story is very</p>
<p> encouraging because you do tend to get all the dismal stories and</p>
<p> there are a lot of dismal stories. I talk to a lot of parents in my....I</p>
<p> have talked to parents in my electorate office in Sydney who grapple</p>
<p> with this problem and there is as much division as to what you ought</p>
<p> to do from the parents of drug victims as there is within the general</p>
<p> community. Some of them say we should be even tougher. Others say</p>
<p> we should be very liberal. There is no one single message that comes</p>
<p> out of those discussions except the need for more treatment facilities.</p>
<p> And what was good about yesterday was that it was a total emphasis</p>
<p> on treatment facilities. Now, yesterday wasn't the beginning</p>
<p> and the end of our response it was just but an element. However, the</p>
<p> good thing about yesterday is that we have helped about 50 treatment</p>
<p> facilities around Australia. These are organisations that actually</p>
<p> help people who want to break the habit and it is just inexcusable</p>
<p> for us to have a situation where people who want to break the habit</p>
<p> can't get help pretty quickly because as one person said to me</p>
<p> yesterday if your child makes the decision that they want to break</p>
<p> the habit it is critically important that there be help available</p>
<p> as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>FAINE:</p>
<p>And one thing you could do straight away is make Naltrexone and other</p>
<p> similar drugs cheaper by subsidising them.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, we are perfectly happy to fast track that and I have made that</p>
<p> clear before. There is a procedure, the thing has to be checked by</p>
<p> the I think it's the NHMRC. There is an established procedure,</p>
<p> you can't have prime ministers saying in a random unscientific</p>
<p> way because I am not a doctor as to what should or should not be on</p>
<p> the list. But as far as the Government is concerned we will fast track</p>
<p> that to the maximum extent we can. We do need the cooperation of the</p>
<p> manufacturer and I just want to make it very clear that if it passes</p>
<p> the clinical hurdles that any drug seeking a subsidy or manufacturer</p>
<p> seeks a subsidy must do then we will be only too happy to make it</p>
<p> available.</p>
<p>FAINE:</p>
<p>Not that Naltrexone is a magic bullet.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, there is no magic bullet in this whole thing.</p>
<p>FAINE:</p>
<p>And that's what we are all learning.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>We are. And it is a war of attrition and you have to try treatment,</p>
<p> you have got to try education, you must, of course, put more resources</p>
<p> into enforcement. It's a three-pronged attack and perhaps in</p>
<p> recent weeks there hasn't been enough focus on the treatment</p>
<p> side of it. And that is an area where everybody agrees whether you</p>
<p> are for or against a heroin trial, you are for treatment. Whether</p>
<p> you are for or against something else you are for treatment and the</p>
<p> more treatment facilities that are available the better.</p>
<p>FAINE:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, the $20 million allocated yesterday does not seem</p>
<p> to be uniformly distributed around the country. An analysis that's</p>
<p> been done of allocation of the money shows that Victoria got only</p>
<p> about 13 per cent, 13.5 per cent, of the grant money even though with</p>
<p> usual health funding we get about 25 per cent and, of course, we are</p>
<p> about that proportion of the population. So I think.....</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>...well, there were previous allocations. There was about $30 million</p>
<p> announced in September of last year. So you have now had announcements</p>
<p> of about $50 million and I would imagine that when you aggregate two</p>
<p> of them together you have a reasonable distribution. But I will have</p>
<p> a look at that. That's the first time that has been raised with</p>
<p> me but I would ask those who may be concerned about that to factor</p>
<p> in the $30 million that was announced last year.</p>
<p>FAINE:</p>
<p>We actually got less money than Queensland. Of course we have a much</p>
<p> larger population.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>But you are just talking about yesterday....</p>
<p>FAINE:</p>
<p>Yesterday's announcement.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>But I am just saying to get a fair picture you have got to factor</p>
<p> in the $30 million last year as well. So there's a total now</p>
<p> of $50 million that has been allocated. So before people make pejorative</p>
<p> judgements about distribution then let's do the calculation involving</p>
<p> the money that was allocated last year.</p>
<p>FAINE:</p>
<p>The amount allocated across the board seems to be either $237,000</p>
<p> to an individual organisation, or a multiple of that, the vast majority</p>
<p> of the grants having looked through the 40 or so pages of the details.</p>
<p> A lot of organisations got $237,000. Now, we had a chance yesterday</p>
<p> to talk to two organisations and they said that they didn't actually</p>
<p> submit for $237,000 or any other sum and it seems as if someone has</p>
<p> decided that that's how much they'll get without looking</p>
<p> at any submission from them, so what was the process that was used</p>
<p> to allocate this money?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, the process involved reference groups at each State level. It</p>
<p> involved people who are on the Drugs Council and it also involved</p>
<p> the Âexperts' in the field and also had to be approved in</p>
<p> the end by the Council, and by the Government, by Dr Wooldridge and</p>
<p> myself. I am not aware that we set out to have an average of 237.</p>
<p> I looked at a lot of the grants, I looked at most of them, and they</p>
<p> were for different amounts, I mean, some as high as $1.5 million.</p>
<p>FAINE:</p>
<p>Certainly there are multiples of that sum but we were wondering if</p>
<p> it was the old Ros Kelly whiteboard technique and saying, look we</p>
<p> have decided to allocate $20 million and we'd now have to find</p>
<p> as many organisations that are ready to receive it as we can.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No because there were many more organisations who wanted funds who</p>
<p> missed out. I mean, there was one organisation that came along to</p>
<p> the launch yesterday that said they'd put in and they missed</p>
<p> out and they hoped they would be considered in a future application.</p>
<p> I don't think there's any whiteboard element because one</p>
<p> of the very supportive phone calls that my office got yesterday was</p>
<p> from a Labor frontbencher representing a seat in the Hunter Valley.</p>
<p> We made money available to a programme in Cessnock which is in a Federal</p>
<p> Labor seat and the federal member for that electorate rang my office</p>
<p> and spoke to the adviser on my staff who deals with this issue and</p>
<p> wanted to express his gratitude for the fact that a group in his electorate</p>
<p> had received a grant and generally expressed support for yesterday's</p>
<p> announcement which I think is a good thing because I am not seeking</p>
<p> to politicise this issue in any way. He is a Labor member, he is a</p>
<p> Labor frontbencher, a Labor federal member and he expressed a lot</p>
<p> of satisfaction. So we clearly haven't sought in any way to politicise</p>
<p> the grants which was a criticism that could legitimately be made of</p>
<p> Ros Kelly's whiteboard. I mean, most of the money went to Labor</p>
<p> electorates, I don't think you'll find any substantial allegation</p>
<p> that this money has gone to the friends of the Liberal Party, heavens</p>
<p> above no.</p>
<p>FAINE:</p>
<p>I am sure you have seen the front page of today's Age</p>
<p> newspaper and The Financial Review also, pictures of the jewellery</p>
<p> that the Australian Olympic representative, Phil Coles, says he hasn't</p>
<p> got and has never seen and has never seen his wife wearing. There</p>
<p> was a picture on the front page of the Age of Mr Coles and</p>
<p> his wife together at a function and she is wearing the jewellery that</p>
<p> Mr Coles says he knows nothing about. For how long do we sit by as</p>
<p> the Australian people and do you as the Prime Minister sit by and</p>
<p> watch the Sydney Olympics being dragged through the mud like this?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, it's a difficult question to answer in just a few words</p>
<p> because I can't presume without having heard all sides of the</p>
<p> story to make judgements which reflect on somebody's character</p>
<p> and reputation. It's very easy for people in a different position</p>
<p> from me to make those judgements. I do carry the responsibility that</p>
<p> if I say something that is highly critical of a person's character</p>
<p> it carries the weight of being words spoken by the Prime Minister</p>
<p> of the country and I don't think that should be...that authority</p>
<p> should be used lightly.</p>
<p>FAINE:</p>
<p>But even overnight from Lausanne, Dick Pound the investigator brought</p>
<p> in by the Olympic movement says it's a new fact that we will</p>
<p> have to investigate....</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>However, I mean, having made the comment I did, however, everybody</p>
<p> recognises that the last few months have been extremely negative for</p>
<p> the whole Olympic Games process. It is very regrettable and it has</p>
<p> done damage and I think everybody involved, everybody involved with</p>
<p> responsibility for organising the Games has to examine what has happened.</p>
<p> It is not just the responsibility of one person and I can't issue</p>
<p> instructions to do this or do that....</p>
<p>FAINE:</p>
<p>But you have a lot of influence.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I have influence but you would understand that the best way to use</p>
<p> that influence is not by making random public comments.</p>
<p>FAINE:</p>
<p>But aren't you getting to the stage now where surely you want</p>
<p> to see this scuttlebutt put to rest, you want to see the Sydney Olympics</p>
<p> getting on with the main game which is putting on a fabulous carnival....</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>And I believe that will happen. I certainly do believe that will happen.</p>
<p>FAINE:</p>
<p>Well, while all this is distracting them I am sure it's a hindrance</p>
<p> they'd rather do without.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, of course they would rather do without it but, John, bear in</p>
<p> mind that it's downtime at the moment and although these are</p>
<p> very negative happenings and they have detracted from the reputation</p>
<p> of the Olympic movement very seriously, not might I say at an Australian</p>
<p> level so much as perhaps at an international level, the reading I</p>
<p> get from the Australian community is that it's the international</p>
<p> the more world-wide body that is more heavily criticised rather than</p>
<p> the Australian one.</p>
<p>FAINE:</p>
<p>Why do we need Phil Coles?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, John, you are asking me to make a judgement as to whether he</p>
<p> should or should not go and I am just not prepared to do that in a</p>
<p> random way, I don't think that's an appropriate thing for</p>
<p> a Prime Minister who can't in any event affect the membership</p>
<p> of SOCOG. I don't control SOCOG, I have two representatives on</p>
<p> it. I do think the legal arrangements that were entered into at the</p>
<p> time it was established gave extraordinary power to the Australian</p>
<p> Olympic Committee, I don't think there is any doubt about that,</p>
<p> quite extraordinary power. But I was not in any way, I was not responsible</p>
<p> for that nor, indeed, was the Federal Government. It was an arrangement</p>
<p> concluded by the New South Wales Government.</p>
<p>FAINE:</p>
<p>Although now with hindsight can we say that it's never a good</p>
<p> idea for any government to give a body that much power?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I don't think it's ever a good idea to give anybody</p>
<p> the power of veto over something which involves the public interest</p>
<p> to the extent that the successful staging of these Games do involve.</p>
<p> There is a public interest, there's an Australian national interest</p>
<p> in these Games, not just a Sydney interest. This is an Australian</p>
<p> event more than it's a Sydney event. It's being held in</p>
<p> Sydney but it goes to the reputation of our whole country and there</p>
<p> is a public interest in the process and, I think, with the benefit</p>
<p> of hindsight that was an error.</p>
<p>FAINE:</p>
<p>You'd like them to clean it up?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I want the Games to be very successful. Of course I want the</p>
<p> thing to be done well. Of course I want the focus to be on what an</p>
<p> incredible opportunity to showcase our country these Games will be.</p>
<p>FAINE:</p>
<p>And our highest ethical standards.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, we all want high ethical standards. There are very high ethical</p>
<p> standards demanded of people in public life. There are levels of accountability.</p>
<p> I mean, politicians lose their positions if they breach certain rules.</p>
<p>FAINE:</p>
<p>If Phil Coles was a member of your Cabinet would you remove him?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, he's not and that's a hypothetical question, good</p>
<p> try.</p>
<p>FAINE:</p>
<p>All right. Moving on to the announcement yesterday also that it seems</p>
<p> Australia is to get another uranium mine. Now, on my count this will</p>
<p> be our fourth mine, we've gone from two to four in the space</p>
<p> of a short period of time. This is an odd business decision from what</p>
<p> I understand and what I read in the business pages. The price of uranium</p>
<p> is at a bit of a low point at the moment so why are we opening up</p>
<p> another uranium mine when uranium sells for only $10 a tonne when</p>
<p> it used to sell for $30 a tonne.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>But, John, it's not the role of the Government to decide whether</p>
<p> a company is making a wise business decision. It's the role of</p>
<p> the Government to agree to something going ahead.....</p>
<p>FAINE:</p>
<p>I should say that's a pound rather than a tonne....</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>...It's the role of the Government to agree to something going</p>
<p> ahead if the rules have been observed. It's not, it's not</p>
<p> for me to say as Prime Minister whether you are making a wise business</p>
<p> decision in opening a shop or buying a piece of real estate or investing</p>
<p> in a holiday home, that's not for me to decide. It is for me</p>
<p> to decide, or Premier or Prime Minister, to decide whether or not</p>
<p> you have complied with the law relating to the opening of shops or</p>
<p> buildings or buying holiday homes. So the fact that the market may</p>
<p> not be beckoning at present is a risk that the entrepreneur is taking,</p>
<p> it is not something that the Government should take into account.</p>
<p> We should take into account environmental safeguard and all other</p>
<p> regulatory requirements.</p>
<p>FAINE:</p>
<p>And indeed you also need to take into account the political realities</p>
<p> of it which we'll come to in a moment. But we've also got</p>
<p> the situation where we've got apparently a consortium in the</p>
<p> States wanting to declare Australia to be the world's uranium</p>
<p> waste dump. So if we're opening new mines now where do we go</p>
<p> in arguing that we don't want any responsibility for nuclear</p>
<p> waste? If the world identifies us as the site for a dump.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well they're two quite separate issues. Just as we can decide</p>
<p> to allow a new uranium mine to open we can decide whether or not waste</p>
<p> is dumped in this country. And we have done that. We have made it</p>
<p> absolutely clear that that will not be allowed.</p>
<p>FAINE:</p>
<p>And opening a new mine doesn't in any way influence world opinion</p>
<p> on that?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>It doesn't. World opinion doesn't matter. It's the</p>
<p> decision of the Australian people that matters and the Australian</p>
<p> people through their government have said we won't be a nuclear</p>
<p> waste dump full stop.</p>
<p>FAINE:</p>
<p>Alright but at the same time the Democrats leader Senator Meg Lees</p>
<p> said the decision to approve the mine is absolutely stupid and the</p>
<p> assessment process she describes as shoddy and this is the same Meg</p>
<p> Lees, leader of the Democrats, with whom you'll have to do some</p>
<p> intense negotiation when she holds the balance of power in the Senate</p>
<p> in a couple of months time.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>John, good government is about making the right decision according</p>
<p> to the merits of an issue and if we are to make decisions based on</p>
<p> how people in the Senate holding the balance of power will vote on</p>
<p> other issues we won't make good decisions.</p>
<p>FAINE:</p>
<p>The Senate and the role of the Senate is going to be absolutely critical</p>
<p> in the next phase of your Government's life. You want to get</p>
<p> through your business, GST tax reforms. You want to get through industrial</p>
<p> relations reforms. You've got a very short period of time to</p>
<p> get anything through between now and the end of June and then you've</p>
<p> got to deal with the Democrats.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes. I'm very much aware of that. Very much aware of that.</p>
<p>FAINE:</p>
<p>Well it's not the time to go around antagonising them is my point.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>But come. Are we going to have a situation where you just trim your</p>
<p> sails on good policy in the hope that the Democrats or anybody else</p>
<p> will look favourably upon you? The Democrats have made it very clear</p>
<p> that they are not going to support the tax package in its present</p>
<p> form. Their position on uranium mining is well known. So is ours.</p>
<p> We went to the last election with the policy on uranium mining that</p>
<p> we are now implementing. Everybody knew that we were against three</p>
<p> mines policy for uranium. Everybody knew that our attitude was that</p>
<p> subject to environmental safeguards and safety standards and all the</p>
<p> other things that have to be applied we would allow further uranium</p>
<p> mines to open. Now that is what we are doing. We are implementing</p>
<p> our policy and it's just not acceptable to trim that policy,</p>
<p> which is good policy in the resource sector in our view, in the rather</p>
<p> vague hope that in some way that might influence the Democrats in</p>
<p> re</p>
