    <content><![CDATA[<p>I will travel to India and Malaysia from 4 to 6 September.</p>
<p>On my first visit to India as Prime Minister, I will visit New Delhi and Indiaâs financial capital, Mumbai, to strengthen the strategic partnership between our two countries.</p>
<p>Australia and India have strong and growing economic and trade ties. India is Australia's fifth largest export market, with total exports of $11.4 billion, and there is potential for further cooperation in resources, science, technology and education.</p>
<p>My visit will be an opportunity to engage with Prime Minister Modi early in the term of his government to increase bilateral cooperation to advance our mutual interests.</p>
<p>I will also meet other senior political leaders, including the President.</p>
<p>The visit will be an opportunity to promote trade and investment and promote our G20 objectives ahead of the Brisbane summit in November.</p>
<p>I will be accompanied on my visit to India by a group of senior business leaders. The delegation reflects the breadth of Australian commercial interests in India and showcases opportunities for further business partnerships.</p>
<p>Following my visit to India, I will travel to Malaysia for talks with Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak. Â </p>
<p>Australiaâs defence ties with Malaysia are amongst our closest in South East Asia and we feel a deep connection to Malaysia given shared experiences arising from the MH370 and MH17 disasters.</p>
<p>Our trade has grown year-on-year, with two-way trade last year worth almost $18 billion.</p>
<p>Hundreds of thousands of Malaysians have studied in Australia and we will soon see more Australians travelling the other way when Malaysia joins the New Colombo Plan in 2015.</p>
<p>I will return to Australia on September 7.</p>
<p>29 August 2014</p>
