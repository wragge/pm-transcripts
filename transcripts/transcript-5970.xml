MEDIA RELEASE PROPOSED WAGES PAUSE DISCUSSIONS WITH THE CAI<br />
( Statement by the Acting Prime Minister, the Rt. Hon. J. D.<br />
Anthony, M. P.)<br />
Together with a number of my senior colleagues, I today<br />
discussed with representatives of the Confederation of Australian<br />
Industry the proposal for a 12-month wage pause that the<br />
Commonwealth Government will be putting to the States next week.<br />
We were very pleased at the response from the CAI.<br />
Members of the CAI indicated their support for the approach<br />
which the Commonwealth was taking, and in particular, the<br />
initiative it was taking in the wages area.<br />
The CAI delegation emphasised the need for industry to have<br />
a reprieve from rising costs, particularly wage costs, if<br />
employment was to be maintained. The proposed wages pause will<br />
be a significant step in this direction.<br />
The CAI expressed the hope that the States would join the<br />
Commonwealth in implementing the proposed wages pause.<br />
