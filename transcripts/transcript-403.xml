RURAL POLICY<br />
I have been at pains to point out, in various speeches,<br />
the great importance of expanding our production and export of<br />
manufactured and processed goods so as to strengthen our balance<br />
of payments position and reduce the risks of special or emergency<br />
mcasures, designed to reduce imports at times when export incomo<br />
falls. But two things still remain true. The first is that<br />
for many years to come our major exports, supporting our<br />
inte,. nationa: solvency, will be of primary products. The second<br />
is that no true and responsible national policy will disregard<br />
the necessity of encouraging the productivity, efficiency, and<br />
economic soundness of ou~ r rural industries,<br />
It is of these industries that I now wish to speak.<br />
'. Je have three great tasks affecting our rural<br />
industries-1. To help cheapen production<br />
2. To increase the quantity of production<br />
3. To protect and expand our markets.<br />
In a short broadcast, I can say just a few sentences about each.<br />
1. COSTS. These always have a tendency to be pished up by<br />
competitive wages and the cost level in the cities. But<br />
the tendency can be resisted by scientific research (] ik3<br />
that done in C. S. I. R. O) and extension services, When<br />
we look back at the work done by the wheat-breeders, from<br />
Farrer on; at the work of the researchers into the<br />
nature and application of fertilisers; at the transformation<br />
of hundreds of thousands of acres of almost<br />
useless land by the trace-element discoveries; at what<br />
myxamatosis has done -to put down the rabbit and put up<br />
wool production; we realise that the best and most<br />
enduring answer to rising costs is increasing efficiency0<br />
As a Government we have never lost sight of this, and<br />
have done much to assist it. Ole will continue to do so.<br />
When our opponents were in office in 1949, the vote for<br />
C. S. I. R. 0. was œ l. 7m. This year it is Over the<br />
last 10 years, largely because of great scientific<br />
investigation into soil deficiencies and animal<br />
nutrition the area of scientifically improved pastures<br />
in Australia lias increased from 20m. acres to 32r-n. acres.<br />
I again remind you that of all the Members of the House<br />
Of Representatives who represent and understand country<br />
electorates, over three-quarters sit in or behind my own<br />
Government, T11hey are not likely to overlook the -vital<br />
importance of Australian primary production.<br />
2. INCRE~ ASED PRODUCTION, Wdhat I have already said has a<br />
direct bearing upon production. But we believe that<br />
increased production of primary products is directly<br />
related to maintaining a stable rural population enjoying<br />
proper standards of living0 Our financial and taxation<br />
policies have for many years been directed to this end,<br />
and with advantage. I just have time to mention two<br />
particular matters which will interest you particularly<br />
at this time. </p>
<p>My own government introduced a special<br />
provision for a depreciation allowance ( for taxation<br />
purposes) of 20% per arinum on moneys laid out on farm<br />
employees' housing. 4hen this legislation ends in<br />
June 1962, we will ronev; it for a further period of<br />
five years. '-de want to see the complete end of those'<br />
old days when, because of inadequate housing, it was<br />
difficult to attract and retain competent farm labour.<br />
Again, in the Banking Legislation ofl959, we<br />
gave a special position and charter to the Commonwealth<br />
Development Bank. This does not compete with the<br />
ordina'. j Trading, Banks for vhat i will call crdinary<br />
l~ arking t-siness. It was established ( and I now<br />
speak of rural finance) to encourage rural development<br />
by dealing with cases in which ordinary bank finance<br />
would not commonly be available. Take an example<br />
A farmer wants to improve his property and increase<br />
his production. His personal security is good; he is<br />
a competent and responsible man. But his cash<br />
resources ar,: small;, lie wants a long-term borrowing<br />
which doRs not fit into the overdraft system; his<br />
actual assets are not adequate to provide a normal<br />
overdraft security. Financial accommodation for such<br />
a man is essential. For such cases, the Commonwealth<br />
Development Bank was created, and furnished with a<br />
limited amount of capital. In our recent Budget we<br />
provided it with an additional œ Cm. of capital. In<br />
future, we will take steps to examine its work and<br />
review its capital position so that it may have<br />
adequate funds for its non-competitive but very special<br />
and important Pfnnctions.<br />
3. MABKcETS. You know that both here and abroad we are<br />
working hard on the problems presented to * Australia by<br />
the negotiations for the entry of Great Britain into<br />
the European Cormon Market. As you know, if Great<br />
Britain were to accede to the Treaty of Rome<br />
unconditionally ( which I don't for one moment think<br />
she will) we would lose our preferential entry for<br />
many of our primary exports into the British Market,<br />
while similar products from Europe which now pay<br />
duty would enter Great Britain duty-free. The<br />
British Government has agreed to do its best to<br />
protect the Commonwealth interests. We, in our turn,<br />
will bend every effort towards protecting our vital<br />
export trade. As my own Ministers have great<br />
experience and not a little influence, we hope to be<br />
able to achieve satisfactory results, We have been<br />
at particular pains to establish one most important<br />
point. It is this. We cannot take our primary<br />
exports as a whole and feel pleased if we preserve a<br />
certain percentage of trade over-all. For the truth<br />
is that, in a large continent like ours, many<br />
individual industries have a special local<br />
significance, and are not to be lumped in with the<br />
mass. Let me illustrate, by a single example, what I<br />
mean, In Australia, dried vine fruits are produced<br />
in limited irrigated areas. Whole communities<br />
largely depend upon them. Their prosperity, indeed<br />
their very existence, would be directly affected if<br />
they lost the British market. Larger and more<br />
widespread industries, with more widiespread markets<br />
could, though wounded, survive. I want to make it<br />
clear that we will fight the battles of all. ' Je are<br />
a young and growing nation, and we must therefore<br />
have bigger and better markets. In our negotiation,<br />
no Australian industry is to be regarded as expendabe<br />
NO rural industry, great or small, will be let tmnbyus. </p>
<p>The negotiations are of historic importance. I<br />
feel sure that you will wish them to be in the hiands<br />
of people of experience, close knowledge, and<br />
seasoned judgment.<br />
We are a joint and united Government containing<br />
Ministers from both the Liberal Party and the Country Party. We<br />
have worked in complete harmony. Our policies are by our<br />
common consent, joint policies. Undistracted by internal feuds,<br />
personal differences, with no need to reconcile factions, we<br />
have been able to present a common front to the problems of the<br />
nation. a. rural matters we have worked in close<br />
consultation with representative bodies. Our record in<br />
stabilisation and extension schemes is clear,<br />
A. e -ou going to vote for our opponents, who can claim<br />
none of these things? </p>
