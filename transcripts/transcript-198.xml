P. M. No. 22/ 1960<br />
BENDIGO BY-ELECTION<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister the Rt. Hon. R. G. Menzies<br />
Once more Mr. Calwell's prophecies have been<br />
falsified. The result in Bendigo is, I think, quite remarkable.<br />
Sixty-eight votes changed would have led to a Labour defeat.<br />
, hen one considers that in the middle year of a Parliament the<br />
stocks of the Government arc never at their highest because<br />
inevitably many criticisms " ariso, it is, I think, very<br />
encouraging to find that in a seat like Bendigo, with now a<br />
considerable Labour tradition, the Government has actually<br />
improved its position since the last general election.<br />
I recognise that this is in no srall measure<br />
attributable to the high quality of the Liberal candidate and<br />
the vigorous work that was put into the campaign. I hope and<br />
believe that Mr. Snell, so far from being discouraged, though<br />
on such a close finish . he will undoubtedly be disappointed,<br />
will determine to continue his political activities which should<br />
undoubtedly bring him victory when a Goneral Election comes<br />
around. CANBERRA, 22nd July, 1960. </p>
