    <content><![CDATA[<p>  I am pleased to announce today that the Australian Government is providing $269,000 over two years to the Warnervale Family and Community Centre to extend its community welcoming initiative in Wyong.  This initiative aims to prevent social stress and isolation in the community by building a social network for new and existing residents.  The current population of the area is 5,000 but is expected to grow to around 50,000 residents in the next 25 years.</p>
<p>This initiative will assist the community in the growing Warnervale/Wadalba region to identify community concerns and to develop practical measures to deal with them.  The Warnervale Family and Community Centre will provide a range of services and resources including information, referral, support groups, playgroups and outreach community events.</p>
<p>I commend UnitingCare Burnside, the Uniting Church and the Wyong Shire Council for their vision in establishing this Centre.  Together with active local resident volunteers, the Centre has worked to strengthen this community since 1998.</p>
<p>This is just one way in which the Australian Government';s Stronger Families and Communities Strategy is helping to forge partnerships and build stronger communities across Australia.</p>
