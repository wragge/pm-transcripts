VISIT TO LAOS Q18RAg"<br />
ARRIVAL PRESS STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
OF AUSTRALIA, THE RT. HON. HAROLD HOLT, MP'.<br />
I welcome the opportunity to make personal contact and<br />
discuss mutual problems and interests with the Prime Minister, His<br />
Highness Prince Souvanna Phouma, and the members of the Royal Lao<br />
Government, and to see what I can in the time available of the Lao people<br />
and their country. I am grateful for the invitation of the Royal Lao Government<br />
to visit Laos which enables me to do these things.<br />
I am also most grateful, as well as honoured, that His<br />
Majesty the King has seen fit to accord me an audience and a luncheon<br />
tomorrow at Luang Prabang.<br />
We were glad to receive His Majesty's son, the Crown<br />
Prince, in Australia on a State visit in 1965.<br />
His Majesty's brother, as Charge d'Affaires in Canberra<br />
has, of course, kept me and my government informed of developments in<br />
Laos and I might add, has told me of the beauties of Luang Prabang.<br />
My visit to Laos fits into the pattern of visits which, as<br />
you may know, I am paying to Australia's neighbours. We have come to<br />
realise how clesely and inextricably our fortunes are bound up with those<br />
of our neighbours, and we are now making further efforts to come to<br />
understand these neighbours better. In recent years, Laos and Australia<br />
have developed close and continuing contacts with each other through our<br />
Embassies in each other's capitals, as well as through our co-operative<br />
ventures under the Colombo Plan, in ECAFE and the Mekong Committee,<br />
and in the Asian Development Bank, to mention only a few organisations.<br />
I believe it essential for Australia and its neighbours such<br />
as Laos to maintain and improve their contact and mutual comprehension,<br />
and jointly to tackle the problem of more rapid development in the area.<br />
On the basis of the experience we have had and the skills we have acquired<br />
in Australia, we have tried to assist within our resources to help Laos'<br />
efforts to develop as quickly as possible.<br />
Our aid under the Colombo Plan has been varied.<br />
Communications are, of course, a basic problem in<br />
Australia, and it was fitting that our first project immediately after the<br />
independence of Laos was the provision of substantial quantities of roadmaking<br />
equipment designed to assist in the re-opening of the road systems.<br />
More recently, we have continued this interest in communications with<br />
the provision of radio receivers and of material for the Lao National<br />
Radio and the two transmitters and mast for the Luang Prabang station<br />
which will be arriving shortly. / 2 </p>

For the rest, our aid, which last year was in the vicinity<br />
of $ US 1, 300, 000, comprises especially our participation in the<br />
financial-stabilisation programme, including the Foreign. Exchange<br />
Operations Fund and our Commodihy Tmport Programme, the development<br />
of our livestock improvemaent project at Na Pheng, tlhe provision of the<br />
bulk of the school supplies required by the Lao primary schools, our<br />
financial contribution to the construction of the Nam Ngum Dam, and the<br />
provision of some 35 scholarships a year in Australia and of some experts<br />
here. We are also acutely aware of the military problems of the<br />
area, including those of Laos.<br />
In 1962, the proud, free, peaceful peaple of Laos accepted<br />
neutrality internationally through the Geneva Accords. Though we<br />
ourselves were not a party to those Accords, we nevertheless accepted<br />
them and have respected them. We respect fully the neutral status of<br />
Laos. We shared the Lao disappointment, not long after the Accords<br />
had been signed, to find that one signatory, North Viet Nam, had not withdrawn<br />
its troops but, on the contrary, and particularly as its aggression against<br />
South Viet Nam increased, was violating Laotian territory both in order to<br />
infiltrate thousands of troops through Laos to South Viet Nam and in order<br />
to dominate certain areas of Laos,<br />
We hatve watched with admiration the response of the Lao<br />
people to this Invasion.<br />
We are aware of the burden which the maintenance of its<br />
defence forces imposes on Laos in terms of manpower and finance.<br />
We are aware of the toll of soldiers and civilians, and the<br />
suffering of the wounded soldiers and injured or dispossessed civilians.<br />
We have admired the progress which the Lao Army has made<br />
over the past two years or more in clearing out the enemy from Governmentheld<br />
areas and creating a protective screen behind which the economic<br />
development of Laos can proceed.<br />
Mrs. Holt and I are looking forward very much to our visit.<br />
We shall meet again at the press conference arranged<br />
towards the end of my visit when I shall be glad to deal with the questions<br />
you may wish to put to me.<br />
APRIL 1st. 1967 </p>
