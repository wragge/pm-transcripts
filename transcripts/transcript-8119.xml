CHECK AGAINST DELIVEFRY EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY<br />
SPEECH BY PRIME MINISTER<br />
MELBOURNE OLYMPIC COMMITTEE<br />
FAREWELL DINNER<br />
MELBOURNE 8 SEPTEMBER 1990<br />
If Australians tend to like their sport, then the people of<br />
Melbourne are positively and passionately in love with it<br />
and at no time more than in spring.<br />
The annual bout of September fever brought on by football<br />
finals followed by the first Tuesday in November when the<br />
whole nation stops for the running of the Melbourne Cup<br />
followed in its turn by the Australian Tennis Open feed<br />
Melbourne's hunger for great sport and make Melbourne an<br />
experienced and qualified host of top quality sporting<br />
events. This year the springtime passion is even more powerful.<br />
On September 18 in ten days time Melbourne and Australia<br />
will stop once more, for the final event of another great<br />
contest in which Melbourne is involved.<br />
There will be parties in the streets, in homes, all over the<br />
city, at the Arts Centre, at the Town Hall, waiting for the<br />
answer to the urgent question: has Melbourne won the bid to<br />
host the 1996 Olympic Games?<br />
And for those of us in Tokyo, it will be a night to remember<br />
and, we hope and believe, to celebrate.<br />
If Melbourne Is successful, the Games will return to the<br />
Southern Hemisphere for only the second time in the hundredyear<br />
history of the modern Olympic movement.<br />
To win that high honour to be host to the centenary Games<br />
Melbourne will have to satisfy the International Olympic<br />
Committee on a vast range of practical criteria.<br />
We will have to show the close links that exist between the<br />
Olympic Committee and the Australian Government. We will<br />
have to demonstrate that the bid has the full support of the<br />
community. We will have to show that we have the ability to<br />
stage the Games with all the advance planning and the<br />
infrastructure that this implies. </p>
<p>It's not my job to detail our whole case tonight on each of<br />
these criteria.<br />
That can wait for the hard-sell in Tokyo.<br />
But I do want to underline one of them by pointing to the<br />
depth of my Government's commitment to the bid and the<br />
breadth of the political support it has drawn from<br />
throughout Australia.<br />
It is a great strength of the Australian community, that<br />
this bid will be suported in Tokyo not only by political<br />
office-holders myself as Prime Minister, the Premier of<br />
Victoria and the Lord Mayor of Melbourne but also by<br />
Federal and Victorian Opposition leaders, and by the three<br />
previous Lords Mayor.<br />
We are united in our support for Melbourne's bid to host the<br />
Games and we are working fully with the Australian Olympic<br />
Committee to make it a success.<br />
Tonight we are farewelling the team that will travel to<br />
Tokyo to put Melbourne's case.<br />
Just like a team sport, where victory requires the<br />
coordinated efforts of many individuals, so our team is<br />
working together to ensure the best possible presentation is<br />
made to the IOC on September 18.<br />
In its composition, our team reflects the broad political<br />
support for the bid and the even broader community support<br />
for it. Business, trade unions, community groups will all<br />
play a part in Tokyo.<br />
Not least, the team shows the enormous support for the bid<br />
from our sporting community, from Olympic heroes to younger<br />
stars of the future to ordinary folk who have taken part in<br />
the Darwin to Melbourne relay run that, like sparks from the<br />
Olympic torch, has touched of f Olympic enthusiasm wherever<br />
the runners have been seen.<br />
And there is a larger team of people who can't come with us,<br />
the volunteers and supporters, whose hard work and<br />
dedication to Melbourne's Candidature has been the backbone<br />
of our bid.<br />
We thank you all.<br />
The degree of support and cooperation that the bid has<br />
received from throughout this city, this State and this<br />
nation gives the greatest source of confidence for success.<br />
I outlined earlier some of the formal criteria that<br />
Melbourne needs to succeed. But you know there is one extra<br />
ingredient in any successful Olympic Games.<br />
It's called character that intangible quality of spirit<br />
that sets a city apart as a special place. </p>
<p>3.<br />
And Melbourne has it by the tonne.<br />
With each host city it chooses, the Olympic Movement<br />
incorporates a new spectacle, a new culture, a new people<br />
into the fabric of the Games.<br />
Those differences create the character of each Olympiad and<br />
help retain the magic of the Olympics for the entire world.<br />
And the athletes who star at a Games become loved and<br />
honoured in the place of their achievement as well as by the<br />
citizens of their own nation and the world.<br />
Place and performance become linked in memory:<br />
* Jesse Owens in Berlin<br />
Emil Zatopek in Helsinki<br />
Vladimir Kutz hand upraised in victory in Melbourne<br />
Herb Elliott in Rome<br />
Dawn Fraser in Tokyo<br />
Mark Spitz with 7 gold in Munich<br />
Nadia Comaneci in Montreal<br />
Carl Lewis in Los Angeles<br />
Flo-Jo in Seoul.<br />
What an incredible collection of memories are conjured up by<br />
those names and places memories of individual achievement<br />
in a global context shared global memories of our shared<br />
global heroes.<br />
Anybody who doubts Melbourne's capacity in 1996 to add to<br />
that superb record of triumph has forgotten the special<br />
qualities of this great sporting city.<br />
The contribution of the Olympics to this century has been<br />
quite extraordinary and, as John Ralph said earlier, it is<br />
due to the power of the Olympic ideals.<br />
Few global institutions survive 100 years. Even fewer<br />
survive and thrive like the OIC has.<br />
It is certainly thriving in Australia.<br />
Australia has been a part of the Olympic Movement's past.<br />
Our commitment has taken us to every Games. We have been<br />
fervent supporters of the ideals and the practice of the<br />
Olympic spirit.<br />
For the future, we believe Australia can provide an<br />
unparalleled stage for the launch of a new century of the<br />
Olympic Movement.<br />
We respect and in many ways embody the traditions of the<br />
past, while being youthful and flexcible and outward-looking<br />
in the structure and nature of our society.<br />
our very population represents an exciting amalgam of the<br />
peoples of the world. </p>
<p>4.<br />
In every respect we echo and reinforce the Olympic ideals;<br />
in every capacity we are qualified for the high honour of<br />
hosting the 1996 Olympic Games.<br />
That is our mission in Tokyo. On behalf of all Australians<br />
I wish success to the Melbourne bid; and as a member of the<br />
team that will be in Tokyo presenting that bid, I can assure<br />
you all we will be doing our darndest to come home winners.<br />
