TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING, MP<br />
INTERVIEW WITH RADIO 21-M, GOONELLABAH, 17 MARCH 1994<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
J: Welcome, Mr Paul Keating.<br />
PM: Hello Jenny.<br />
J: I believe you have Irish ancestry.<br />
PM: Yes, I do actually and I went back there last year to the village of my<br />
ancestors and they could actually show you the block of land they<br />
worked on.<br />
J: And did it have an impact on you going back?<br />
PM: Yes, it was wonderful. A village of 250 and 6,000 turned up.<br />
J: Fantastic.<br />
PM: It was wonderful, the warmth of Ireland. I guarantee half the worlds<br />
warmth must reside in that little country.<br />
J: I heard an Irish woman today say that she thought St Patrick's Day<br />
trivialises the problems over there. What do you think about that?<br />
PM: I don't think so, no. It is a great national occasion, a great national day<br />
for a country with enormous spirit and which has made an enormous<br />
contribution to the culture of the world and we keep the celebrations<br />
going here. Harry Woods is with me, I don't whether Harry..<br />
J: He is in green.<br />
PMV: Harry has got the colours on, he has got a bit of the Irish.<br />
HW: I have ancestors from Glare. </p>
<p>PM: From Clare. I am from eastern Galway. Harry is from Clare. You see,<br />
black Irish we've both got the black hair.<br />
J: All right, still talking about overseas on two more serious matters. We<br />
are having trouble competing successfully in the international arena<br />
because our major competitor Asia pays such low wages, our<br />
corporations are starting to go -off -Shore to manufacture and even<br />
some of local industries now are setting up factories overseas. How<br />
can we compete successfully internationally?<br />
PM: We are already doing that. Our manufacturing production has doubled<br />
since 1983; our exports have trebled. Let me just explain this to you<br />
ten years ago we exported 13 per cent of all we produce, this year that<br />
is 21 per cent. So, we have seen a huge growth in exports and in the<br />
national accounts which came out yesterday which showed the<br />
economy growing so strongly at 4 per cent, a big contribution to that<br />
was exports. So, what I am saying to you Jenny is not a claim, it is<br />
simply a fact: that Australia is exporting its head off and we are hugely<br />
competitive via wages, via the inflation rate, via the exchange rate<br />
all of these elements of our competitiveness have turned around<br />
Australian manufacturing. We don't want to be in the business of<br />
competing with low wage countries. We want a society here which has<br />
much higher incomes than that. If our future was only a dismal one, in<br />
other words we would have to have the same wages as China or<br />
Malaysia or somewhere else, then Australians would be very much the<br />
poorer. So, what we would need to do is to do innovative and clever<br />
things and that is why the government has put so much emphasis on<br />
our education system that now we have got eight kids in ten<br />
completing secondary school and most of them going into universities<br />
and into vocational education, into TAFE. The kind of society we will<br />
have and the kind of products we will produce will be a measure of<br />
their creativity. So, the money is in selling innovation. There is no<br />
money selling simple things.<br />
J: A lot of those kids though are staying on because it is programmed<br />
that way, because they are keeping them at school longer because<br />
there is not enough jobs for them. Can you see that changing though?<br />
PMV: If you look at the 1980s, we are starting to get strong employment<br />
growth back again now. If you look at the time when we did have it,<br />
say from 1983 to 1990, those kids instantly went into jobs. I was<br />
talking to somebody the other day at an secondary educational<br />
institution, a tertiary institution, they were saying that every single<br />
person who graduated found a job. I think that won't be generally true,<br />
but people who are qualified for interesting work will be taken up. That<br />
is why the emphasis has to be on education and training. In other<br />
words, we don6' T want to be an untra ned, -lowwage society. We want<br />
to be a highly trained, much higher wage society where we are selling<br />
services and services growth has just blossomed where we are<br />
sefling manufactures and where we are really reaching out into the </p>
<p>world. All that has shown up yesterday again in those National<br />
Accounts.<br />
J: You obviously must have been pleased with them, but I understand<br />
there has been very little new business investment shown in those<br />
figures. Have you got any plans to make it more attractive for small<br />
and big businesses to increase their investment?<br />
PM: In yesterday's Accounts the profit share of the economy that is the<br />
share of national product going to profits if you take national income,<br />
le~ t ' s talk about some of these terms, and you come to the fork in the<br />
road: one part goes down to profits and the other part goes down to<br />
wages, at the fork in this road the profit share of national income in<br />
yesterday's National Accounts is the highest in Australian history. So,<br />
business has now got very, very booming profits and what it will now<br />
do is invest them. But this is a phenomenon of the last year and it<br />
takes a while to get started. We are now seeing quite strong<br />
investment coming through; we are seeing very strong housing<br />
investment; we are seeing strong retail spending and the tax cuts the<br />
Government promised in the election and delivered were responsible<br />
for kicking along retail sales in the December quarter and that has<br />
been part of the power of the 4 per cent growth we are seeing. So,<br />
yes, business investment has been slow since 1989-90, but we are<br />
now starting to see the pace and if you look at the expectations data,<br />
this is the surveys of business to see what they think they will be<br />
doing, they are saying they will be doing much more in the coming<br />
year.<br />
J: So, you are saying the don't need any more incentives offered then?<br />
PM: They don't need any more profits, no. Let me just make this very clear.<br />
If business doesn't start investing the work force will claim some of the<br />
profits back to wages. Can I make this point: the Government since<br />
the election, has reduced the company rate from 39 per cent to 33 per<br />
cent we have got a company rate the same as Singapore we have<br />
introduced an investment allowance 2 in fact where we add 10 per<br />
cent value to any proposal for right-offs; accelerated depreciation; no<br />
double tax on dividends. The Government can't do any more on that<br />
front. What business has got to do now is basically get off their tails<br />
and start investing.<br />
J: We are all looking forward to seeing how Carmen Lawrence. will do,<br />
but she seems to the be exception and not the rule. There doesn't<br />
seem to be that many women in the top jobs, why are there so few<br />
women in your Ministry?<br />
PM: Let me just make a point, there is not one women in the National party<br />
in Canberra. Not one. Now, of course there are many in the Labor<br />
party. </p>
<p>J: Quite a few in the Liberal party too.<br />
PM: Yes, there are quite a few in the Liberal party, none in the National<br />
party; we are going to have many more in the Labor party and we have<br />
got a number now in the Ministry<br />
J: Two isn't it?<br />
PM: No, we have had three, and Ros Kelly resigned, but as you know I<br />
have argued quite firmly that I think Dr Lawrence should join the<br />
Ministry and were that to happen we would go back to three and that, I<br />
hope, is the start of a greater level of representation amongst<br />
Australian women in the higher echelons of national politics in the<br />
executive area.<br />
J: Has your party got a policy on equal. representation?<br />
PM: Our party is now debating this question about how we move towards a<br />
higher level of representation, indeed, equal representation by women<br />
towards the end of the century and each state branch is now seeking<br />
to deal with that. My experience, if you take Dr Lawrence as an<br />
example, she has been a Premier; a person who can develop policies<br />
and articulate them and will play, I think, a very strong role in the<br />
national government.<br />
J: Can you imagine a woman Prime Minister in the next five or ten years?<br />
PM: We have had women Premiers Joan Kirner was recently the Premier<br />
of Victoria; Carmen herself was the Premier of Western Australia it is<br />
entirely possible as it ought to be.<br />
J: This is a big retirement area and many elderly people feel a bit angry<br />
and frustrated about being -taxed on the interest of their investments.<br />
They feel, I suppose, they have worked hard for their money, they<br />
have paid their tax through the years, a lot of them have put a bit aside<br />
for their retirement thinking they can survive on it without being on the<br />
pension and so forth. Can you see any answer to that, do they have to<br />
be taxed on the interest, can you see why they might be angry?<br />
PM: There are a few things that people should realise about what the<br />
Government has done with pensions. When we became the<br />
Government pensions were just under 21 per cent of average weekly<br />
earnings. Now, I think, they are nearly 26 per cent of average weekly<br />
earnings because pensions are always adjusted with the CPI, where in<br />
the more leaner times wages were not. If you look at 1990 and 1991<br />
and 1992 what has happened is that at the bottom end of the work<br />
force wages have dropped, but the pensions continue to rise because<br />
they have been inflation adjusted. Now as well as that, the<br />
Government has said we will increase the free area of earnings under<br />
the pension so that a single pensioner or a couple can earn much </p>
<p>more without losing a dollar of pension. But we did one additional<br />
thing: we said that money you earned was formerly taxed, it is now<br />
removed completely from the tax system so a pensioner person or<br />
couple can go out and earn that money, not lose a dollar of income,<br />
but also not pay tax on it. Now, once they get over that free area, they<br />
start to pay tax on it. But again, if you earn income in this country you<br />
are taxed, if you are on a full rate pension you can earn within the free<br />
area I can't exactly remember the figure at the moment, but it is now<br />
quite generous and not lose a dollar of pension.<br />
J: But how about these people who are not even on the pension. They<br />
are finding it really hard.<br />
PM: The pension is available on the basis of means and income. It is a<br />
very fair test, I think. So, if people have assets which take them<br />
outside the pension range, the pension system doesn't need to serve<br />
them or, if they have income if you like, outside the income ranges.<br />
But for most people who have got a bit of superannuation or a bit of<br />
something else they end up being a part-rate pensioner. Therefore<br />
they then pick up the medical benefits support, they pick up the<br />
pensioner concessions.<br />
J: I just thought it might be good to encourage the people that aren't on<br />
the pensions to stay off the pensions, it might be a little of the lighter<br />
load.<br />
PM: The way people stay off pensions is to have income above the income<br />
test ranges. The pension is not a national right for everyone who is<br />
elderly. The pension is there to support those whose income levels<br />
drop below certain levels and whose assets fall within certain ranges.<br />
But you see the other thing about the Government, in terms of the<br />
aged, it is not just very good income support through the pension and<br />
adjusting it and seeing its proportion of average weekly earnings rise<br />
and increasing the free area and removing it from the tax system, but<br />
the government has also invested very heavily in support for aged<br />
people in the home and community care program; in geriatric<br />
assessment; in hostel and nursing home programs. These things, I<br />
thfilik, -matter tremendously to people and, of course, they have the<br />
general protections of Medicare.<br />
J: Given that the Pacific Highway is the main route north from Sydney,<br />
why is it still-a state -responsibility and are there any plans for the<br />
Commonwealth to take it over?<br />
PM: No, there is now a very clear delineation between the national highway<br />
system and the highway system under the management of the states.<br />
The highway in NSW which is part of that national system is the New<br />
England highway. Now, were the Commonwealth to take over<br />
responsibility for the Pacific highway it would mean that NSW -would<br />
have to take responsibility over for the New England highway, the </p>
<p>Commonwealth wouldn't have responsibility for both highways and, of<br />
course, there would need to be substantial financial adjustments to<br />
Commonwealth payments to NSW in respect of responsibilities the<br />
Commonwealth would pick up for the Pacific highway. At the moment<br />
this rests with NSW. We have spent $ 170 million on the Pacific<br />
highway before this change in responsibilities or the delineation in<br />
responsibilities and Harry Woods was telling me this morning we have<br />
spent about $ 25 million, I think, in this area on the highway and<br />
including another $ 4-5 million on the black spots areas of the highway.<br />
So, I wouldn't say we are the only people putting money into it at this<br />
stage, but we have certainly put fairly heavy money into it, but it really<br />
is a long run program and one that has to be resolved by NSW<br />
principally. Can I also say the other thing we are doing is upgrading the main<br />
Brisbane-Sydney railway line left undone for 25 years. This -is a7stIat<br />
responsibility essentially. We are now putting money into it under the<br />
' One Nation' program I announced a couple of years ago which will<br />
see less trucks on the road; a better rail service down to Sydney; we<br />
are building a new viaduct in this part of NSW. There is a viaduct at<br />
Grafton and we are building a number of new steel and concrete<br />
bridges and upgrading the permanent way in tracks. This is going to<br />
speed up the trains and make them more regular which will mean they<br />
will be a better freight service between Brisbane and Sydney and<br />
points along the way which will mean fewer trucks on the roads et<br />
cetera.<br />
J: So, will you be listening to your taskforce, the Labor party taskforce,<br />
that are campaigning to have it become a Commonwealth<br />
responsibility?<br />
PM: We are listening, but again we are not about to just take NSWs<br />
responsibilities willy nilly and put them onto the Commonwealth<br />
government. There is a notion around the country today if there is a<br />
problem go and see the federal government because they have got the<br />
money and they can fix it. Well, so too has NSW got the money and<br />
they have got to be required to fix more of their own responsibilities. It<br />
has taken the national government initiative to pick up the national rail<br />
highway system from this rickety old state rail system to remodinize it<br />
and do something with it so we can have a freight service which runs<br />
from Queensland all the way to Perth on a proper national highway<br />
system. We have put a lot of money into that. We are putting a lot of<br />
money into the national road highway system, and we have until<br />
recently, until the states said let's free up road funding, we've put into<br />
arterial roads in the states and black spots, and it's the black spots, of<br />
course, where people are killed, where there are a lot of accidents.<br />
J: In the paper recently Jim Bolger was saying that he suggest that New<br />
Zealand might become a republic by the year 2000. Have you got any<br />
comments on that? </p>
<p>PM: Jim is picking up my lines, I am very flattered. I think I have converted<br />
the Leader of the New Zealand Conservative party to this thinking, but<br />
I haven't had as much luck here with Dr Hewson and the obscurantists<br />
in Canberra. So, they are still fighting for Queen and country and John<br />
Howard is flat out winding the clock back, he is now back to about<br />
1961 and still winding, and no doubt, if he keeps going he will find<br />
himself back where he really feels most comfortable, about 1951.<br />
J: Just to finish up, personally your predecessor is a self proclaimed<br />
agnostic, what do you believe?<br />
PM: I am a self confessed Christian and I think most people know that.<br />
Everybo-dy has-their own views about these things. I don't go around<br />
parading my religious views or requiring people to take note of them. I<br />
actually think that Christian teaching and dogma has been a wellspring<br />
of the recognition of human dignity and human endeavour and this has<br />
been very telling in the politics and policies of western civilisation. It is<br />
no less true here and it has always been very true of the Labor party in<br />
particular which always says that the dignity of the human person is<br />
paramount that is, we do things because of the innate importance of<br />
each particular person rather than they belong to a particular<br />
economic class or socio-economic group.<br />
J: All right, when you go home, what do you do, how do you relax and<br />
what to you read just to finish up.<br />
PM: When I go home my principal interest is, of course, with my wife and<br />
family and my kids keep me more than amused I can assure you. I<br />
enjoy them immensely and I have got home interests. I like music<br />
which Annita, my wife, does too. We had a nice little jam session on<br />
late on Sunday afternoon and we went through about three or four<br />
hours of Maria Callas and some of the great tenors of the ' 60s and<br />
sopranos and various others, we got into choral music and then we<br />
finished off with a big Mahler symphony. Or occasionally if the mood<br />
takes it, I hop into the pop stuff, get a bit of Tom Jones on. I have got<br />
these generally home r elated inte rests I read a fair bit of biography.<br />
One of my passionate interests in architecture and furniture, I read a<br />
lot about that. I am d-oi-ng my fourth degree in architecture, that is<br />
privately. When I'm not doing thiose -things I'm-talking to my<br />
colleagues like Harry about various problems. You have got to have a<br />
mix of the two though bit of work and pleasure.<br />
J: You mustn't have much time for pleasure.<br />
PM: It's mostly work, but there we are. That's why we signed ourselves up<br />
and that is why we are basically pleased to be doing what we are<br />
doing in the service of the public of this country.<br />
ends </p>
