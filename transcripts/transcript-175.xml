HOBART FLOOD RELIEF<br />
Statement by the Acting Prime Minister. Mr. McEwen<br />
The Acting Prime Minister, Mr. McEwen, today sent the<br />
following message to the Tasmanian Premier, the Hon. E. E. Reece:<br />
" On behalf Commonwealth Government I wish to express our<br />
sincere regret at serious damage occasioned by floods in<br />
Tasmania and deep sympathy for all who have suffered so greviously.<br />
Mr. Townley has impressed the Government with the seriousness<br />
of the disaster and raised the question of Commonwealth<br />
assistance and I also have your telegram of today's date.<br />
Consistent with the approach in other major disasters the<br />
Commonwealth will contribute pound for pound with State finance<br />
for relief personal hardship and distress on usual conditions.<br />
Also in line with assistance xiven in other major disasters<br />
Commonwealth is willing to make a contribution on a pound for<br />
pound basis towards restorations necessary as a result of damage<br />
to public roads, bridges, etc., and our officials would wish to<br />
consult as soon as convenient with your officials on needs under<br />
these headings uith view to an eaiy advance by Commonwealth."<br />
The Minister for Defence, Mr. Townley, said in<br />
Canberra tonight that he was encouraged by the sympathetic<br />
attention-xiven by the Commonwealth to Tasmania's problems. He<br />
was also pleased at the prompt reaction. He said: " The<br />
Tasmanian Premier, Mr. Reece, has been informed by the Acting<br />
Prime Minister, Mr. McEwen, of the details of the Commonwealth<br />
assistance". Briefly the Commonwealth will share equally all<br />
amounts expended by the State Government for immediate relief of<br />
personal distress and hards-hip. Seca-) Jly the Commonwealth on the<br />
same basis will share the cost of restoring bridges, roads etc.<br />
This is in line with practices adopted by the Commonwealth<br />
in all major disasters and will undoubtedly ease the<br />
burden on the State especially as planning can now proceed<br />
~ uithout delay.<br />
CAN'BERRA, 26thi April 1960. </p>
