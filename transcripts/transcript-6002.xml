EMBARGO: FOR RELEASE AT 8: OOPM AUSTRALIAN EASTER" N<br />
SUMMER TIME 28/ 1/ 83<br />
PRIME MINISTER FRIDAY, JANUARY 28 1983<br />
The President of the United States, Mr Ronald Reagan, has<br />
invited me to make an official working visit to the United<br />
State. I have accepted that invitation and will meet with<br />
the President in San Francisco on 5 March 1983. Following<br />
the meeting and a working lunch, the President has invited<br />
me to fly with him to Washington for meetings with other<br />
members of his administration.<br />
The President had earlier indicated that he would seek an<br />
opportunity before the next Sumrmit Conference in may in<br />
Williamsburg to have discussions on matters of mutual<br />
interest. There are many international issues vitally<br />
affecting the Australian economy, and therefore the<br />
opportunity to exchange views with Mr Reagan at this time<br />
will be particularly valuable for the Australian Government.<br />
I shall be accompanied on the visit by the Foreign<br />
Minister, Mr Street.<br />
The visit will be brief. After engagements in Washington<br />
and New York, I shall be returning immediately to Australia.<br />
