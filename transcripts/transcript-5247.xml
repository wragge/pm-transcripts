PRESS OFFICE TRANSCRIPT OF PRIME MINISTER INTERVIEWED ON KNBC<br />
CHANNEL 4, LOS ANGELES 29 JANUARY 1980<br />
Rejo r t<br />
Some of the U. S. allies most vocal in condemning the Soviet move<br />
in Afghanistan have been Britain, Canada and Australia. As a<br />
guest on News Centre 4 tonight is the Prime Minister, of Australia,<br />
Malcolm Fraser. Prime Minister Fraser will be meeting with<br />
President Carter on Thursday to talk about the situation in<br />
Afghanistan. After that he goes to Britain for talks with Prime<br />
Minister Margaret Thatcher. We have asked him to join us tonight<br />
to talk about his Government's positions in those areas.<br />
Question Mr. Prime Minister, welcome. Not only did you respond agreeably<br />
to U. S. positions where Iran, Afghanistan are concerned, but you<br />
responded perhaps more quickly than any other nation, almost in<br />
concert with the United States. Was there any pre-arrangement<br />
on these issues?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
We keep fairly closely in touch on a large number of important<br />
issues. But we believe that the United States was right. We also<br />
believe that if there is a free world job to be done, that<br />
obviously the United States is the most significant country in that,<br />
but there is a role for other countries as well.<br />
Question Which should be what?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Well, if we think the United States is right, to be supportive<br />
and to do what we can in what is after all a common cause.<br />
Question You agreed with the grain embargo, you agreed with Olympic boycott,<br />
as I recall-<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Yes I do.<br />
Question But you have also suggested that your nation might even provide<br />
some naval support should the United States choose to make some<br />
move. Would that include a blockade? Would you participate in<br />
a blockade?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
That is not quite what we have said. We have a defence relationship<br />
with the United States that goes back to being on the same side in<br />
the last World War and there is a formal alliance. Wqhat we have<br />
said is that if -there looks like being increasing responsibilities<br />
in the Indian Ocean, not just in the short term, just not for the </p>
<p>Prime minister ( continued)<br />
time of the crisis in Iran and Afghanistan, but over a much<br />
longer haul, then we are prepared to take a larger share of<br />
that load. Therefore, we will be discussing with the United<br />
States our capacity to contribute some-thing more to the general<br />
patrolling and surveillance responsibilities in the Indian Ocean.<br />
Question Do you see the Soviet move into Afghanistan as being a significant<br />
change in Soviet attitude. Does it mark the end of detente?<br />
Does it mark the return of the Cold War?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
It is not the return of the Cold War, because circumstances are<br />
different. That does not mean to say it will be any easier or<br />
more comfortable than the Cold War was. It will be different.<br />
I think that sort of term does not really describe the circumstance.<br />
In the years since the Cold War, the Soviet Union has been churning<br />
12, 13, 14 per cent of her gross domestic product into defence<br />
every year, year after year. So they are well armed and they are<br />
very well equipped. The end of detente? Well, the West had one<br />
interpretation of detente, the Soviet Union had another.<br />
Question So none really existed?<br />
Prime MInister<br />
I doubt if it ever really existed. I think that really, what<br />
Afghanistan has enabled many people to do is to see the real<br />
intentions of the Soviet Union more clearly, more starkly, than<br />
they have been able to in recent times.<br />
Question You speak of the Soviet defence build-up, and as you are undoubtedly<br />
aware in this nation President Carter's new budget has proposed<br />
major increases in defence spending. You were once Defence Minister<br />
of your nation. Is your nation also beefing up its defences,<br />
spending more of its resources on defence?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
We have asked our own defence people to put options in froit of us.<br />
I would believe that our own defence expenditure will be increased<br />
as a result of what has happened. We have been increasing in real<br />
terms our expenditure in the last three or four years, but our<br />
expenditure has been modest.<br />
Question In the Middle East you haven't quite as much at stake as we. you<br />
are virtually energy independent, are you not?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
In many fields, yes. We are a major energy exporter in coal, and<br />
natural gas, and a little later in uranium. We are not selfsufficient<br />
in oil about 70 per cent self-sufficient, the rest<br />
from imports. But if, through further disruptions to Middle East </p>
<p>Prime Minister ( continued)<br />
oil supplies, advanced industrial economies were grievously<br />
damaged, as they could be, then that would obviously affect<br />
Australia and will affect all nations.<br />
Question You not only export energy, you also are a major exporter of food.<br />
Is it your judgement, it is the judgement of your Government,<br />
that food is an appropriate weapon to be used in a political<br />
skirmish? Could you withhold food from the Middle East the way<br />
the Arabs withhold oil from the rest of the world in times of<br />
political crisis.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
I think it would be very difficult to do that. I believe it<br />
would be counter-productive. It might lose support for the cause<br />
which we believe is important.<br />
Question Do you also suggest it might be immoral?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
I think many people would suggest that, yes. </p>
