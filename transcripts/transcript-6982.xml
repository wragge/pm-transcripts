PRIME MINISTER<br />
EMBARGOZD UNTIL DELIVERY CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY<br />
PRESENTATION OF THE NATIONAL AWARDS FOR INNOVATION4<br />
IN LOCAL GOVERNMENT<br />
ADELAIDE 13 AUGUST 1986<br />
It gives me great pleasure to be with you on this occasion,<br />
the presentation of the National Awards for Innovation in<br />
Local Government.<br />
This is ' zhe first time the awards have been presented.<br />
They r~ p1 resent a further recognition of Local Government at<br />
the nat: ional level and I would like to congratulate Tom Uren<br />
for having the foresight to introduce them.<br />
In the years ahead I am certain the awards will come to be<br />
seen as prized indicators of achievement in Local<br />
Gove rrnent.<br />
The at-ards have three purposes.<br />
First, they are designed to recognise the achievements of<br />
Local Government. Those of you in Local Government know<br />
that these achievements are many. But it is important that<br />
they be~ recognised by those outside Local Government and be<br />
used to present a more balanced picture of Local Government<br />
than sometimes comes forward.<br />
The second purpose is to encourage innovative practices. In<br />
today's difficult economic circumstances -the introduction of<br />
innovative techniques and approaches is essential if we are<br />
to adapt to meet the challenges that confront us. This must<br />
be done in the Local Government sector as elsewhere.<br />
The third purpose of the Awards is perhaps the most<br />
important. It is to promote the sharing of ideas and<br />
experiences and to disseminate the benefits of innovation.<br />
It is something that can be done with maximum effectiveness<br />
at the national level.<br />
The Awards were launched in March. They instantly attracted<br />
the attention of Local Government throughout the country and<br />
some 250 applications were received. </p>
<p>2<br />
I am told that a panel of experts, principally drawn from<br />
major national Local Government bodies, pondered long and<br />
hard before selecting what it considered to be the<br />
outstanding entries.<br />
with so many worthy efforts the panel found that it could<br />
not confine itself to eight awards. it therefore<br />
recommended, in addition, some 16 commendations for<br />
outstanding innovation achievement.<br />
To all those councils who have won an award or a<br />
commendation I offer my congratulations. You have by your<br />
efforts denionstrated your leadership in your industry and<br />
you are providing a fine example for others, including other<br />
public sector managers, to follow.<br />
I also congratulate all those other councils who submitted<br />
entries. Their interest in this award has helped make it a<br />
real success. Many of the innovations submitted by these<br />
councils were of the highest quality and because of this, a<br />
booklet will be produced detailing every application. in<br />
this way we hope to ensure that maximum advantage is taken<br />
by councils of the experiments, proposals and developments<br />
of other councils.<br />
The National Awards for Innovation in Local Government are<br />
an integral part of my Government's commitment to strengthen<br />
Local Government and to raise its status and capacity. For<br />
too long too little recognition has been given to the<br />
important, indeed vital, role that Local Government plays<br />
both in the administration and welfare of this country.<br />
Other level. s of government, have been too ready to treat<br />
Local Government as a distant relative. I believe that as a<br />
result, too often we have failed to appreciate, learn from<br />
and build upon the impressive strengths of Local Government.<br />
When we took office in 1983 we took steps to correct this<br />
situation.<br />
We established the first Ministry for Local Government and<br />
appointed one of our most experienced ministers to lead it.<br />
Subsequent events have proved how correct was the choice of<br />
Tom Uren as Local Government Minister. Nobody has fought<br />
harder for your cause. I can tell you that from personal<br />
experience. Nobody could have achieved more than Tom has,<br />
given the circumstances that have prevailed.<br />
We have expanded and developed the Commonwealth office of<br />
Local Government. In contrast to its pitiable state before<br />
1983, it now has the resources and expertise to advise the<br />
Government effectively on local government matters and to<br />
fight the Local Government cause within the Commonwealth<br />
bureaucracy.<br />
we have backed our words of support for Local Government<br />
with funds. In the year just completed, 1985-86, the<br />
Government provided over $ 1 billion to Local Government a<br />
level 50 per cent higher than in the last year of the Fraser<br />
Government. </p>
<p>3<br />
The $ 1 billion being provided by the Commonwealth is<br />
significant in terms of Commonwealth expenditure. It<br />
reflects the importance we attach to the role of Local<br />
Government in the economic and social development of this<br />
nation. For this coming financial year we have taken steps to ensure<br />
that the key part of local Government's funding from the<br />
Commonwealth the untied general purpose assistance<br />
grants is maintained in real terms. It will mean that for<br />
this year the level of these grants could increase to some<br />
$ 580 million.<br />
This has again placed Local Government in a better position<br />
than the States. This year the States will suffer a decline<br />
in real terms in the assistance they receive from the<br />
Commonwealth. When the Budget is delivered next Tuesday and<br />
you can see its effects on Commonwealth Departments and<br />
Authorities you will realise what a good deal Local<br />
Government has received.<br />
In these times of economic difficulty and constraint, the<br />
new general purpose funding arrangements for Local<br />
Government are a significant achievement for your sphere of<br />
Government. They, in fact, represent a vote of confidence<br />
by my Government in Local Government.<br />
I am tol6 that the successful negotiation of these new<br />
arrangements for Local Government was in no small part due<br />
to the ability of Local Government's national and state<br />
representatives to perceive the key issues and to quickly<br />
establish a common position. I congratulate Local<br />
Government on its efforts in this area.<br />
There is 3ne aspect of the new general purpose financial<br />
assistance arrangements for Local Government that I would<br />
like to emiphasise. That is the increased emphasis the new<br />
arrangements will place on providing assistance to the more<br />
disadvantaged councils.<br />
Under the new arrangements such councils whether they be<br />
in rural areas, provincial towns or the cities will<br />
receive a better deal than they have in the past.<br />
This, of course, is consistent with my Government's concern<br />
to protect the less well off sections of our society and to<br />
ensure that our limited resources are distributed in the<br />
fairest way possible.<br />
This consideration is even more important in the difficult<br />
times we are now in. With the current emphasis on restraint<br />
all levels of Government must re-double their efforts to<br />
ensure expenditure is directed to the most worthy areas.<br />
A pleasing feature of the new financial assistance<br />
arrangements for Local Government is the manner in which<br />
co-operation between the three spheres of government is<br />
strengthened. </p>
<p>Under the new arrangements provision is made for all three<br />
spheres Local Government, the States and the<br />
Commonwealth to be involved in drawing up the principles<br />
that will determine the distribution of funds between<br />
councils in each State.<br />
This change reflects our commitment to strengthen<br />
co-operation between Governments in the Local Governmaent<br />
area. It is evident in the Local Government Ministers Conference<br />
where we have upgraded the role of that Conference in<br />
co-operation with the States and Local Government. That<br />
conference is now playing a leading part in assessing local<br />
Government's irole in economic development and in the0<br />
provision of community services matters that will be at<br />
the forefront of Local Government concern in the years<br />
ahead. This strengthened co-operation has also been evident in the<br />
employment area where the Commonwealth's Community<br />
Employment Program has achieved considerable success. Much<br />
of the credit for that success rests with Local Government<br />
which has responded magnificently in the provision of<br />
projects, supervision and resources.<br />
I am looking forward to an equally impressive response from<br />
Local Governnc. 3nt as we press ahead with providing a wider<br />
range of employment opportunities for young people.<br />
A major factor in our success in encouraging greater<br />
co-operation between Governments has been the introduction<br />
of the Local Government development program.<br />
Under this program we have spent over $ 11 million since 1983<br />
funding, in total, some 430 projects, directly involving 327<br />
councils, in all States and the Northern Territory.<br />
Not only has the program encouraged greatly increased<br />
co-operation between the three spheres of government but it<br />
has enhanced co-operation between councils as well.<br />
However, increasingly, the major thrust of the program has<br />
been to spread the use of more effective and efficient<br />
practices throughout Local Government. It is an even more<br />
timely program in the present economic climate when we all<br />
need to become more productive and effective.<br />
All aspects of Local Government activity; management,<br />
training, accounting, infrastructure planning, environmental<br />
improvement, service delivery, and employment initiatives,<br />
to name but a few, have been embraced by this program.<br />
The results of these projects are now becoming available and<br />
action is underway to disseminate the experiences throughout<br />
the Local Government industry. Priority will be given to<br />
this task in the year ahead. </p>
<p>There is no doubt that the Local Government development<br />
program will prove to be of major importance for Local<br />
Government. Equally, there can be no doubt that it has been a successful<br />
initiative of this-Government.<br />
In recognition of this I am pleased to announce that the<br />
Government will continue the program in 1986-87, although at<br />
a reduced funding level, commensurate with the budgetary<br />
restraints that now face us all.<br />
Some of you will be disappointed that funding for this small<br />
but important program will be reduced. I too am<br />
disappointed that we have been unable to maintain funding,<br />
levels, but for this year, at least, economies must be<br />
achieved.<br />
The challenge you now have in this year of restraint is to<br />
make the very best use of these funds. I am sure that, for<br />
his part, Torn will be making every dollar count.<br />
There are othler areas in which we have taken steps to<br />
strengthen a~ nd improve local Government's position.<br />
In last year's budget we introduced new arrangements to<br />
permit the deductibility for income tax purposes of expenses<br />
incurred in Local Government elections. This was a reform<br />
long overdue and brought the Local Government situation more<br />
into line w~ lth that applying to State and Commonwealth<br />
elections. We have also moved to ensure that Local Government is<br />
represented at key national economic forums. The Australian<br />
Council of Local Government As~ sociations is represented, for<br />
instance, on the Economic Planning Advisory Council and<br />
makes a valuable contribution to its work.<br />
In placing Local Government on EPAC we have recognised that<br />
Local Government is an important part of the economic<br />
process at the local level. It is a significant employer,<br />
provider of facilities, services and infrastructure and<br />
consumer of good and services. It serves as an important<br />
catalyst in many instances in developing community resources<br />
and capacities. It has many economic functions.<br />
We have also encouraged and assisted Local Government in its<br />
rightful claim to be included in the Australian<br />
Constitution, supporting your representatives at the<br />
Brisbane meeting last year and ensuring that Local<br />
Government is adequately represented on the Constitutional<br />
Commission we established recently.<br />
We were heartened by the outcome for Local Government of the<br />
Brisbane convention. I am hopeful that firm recommendations<br />
will now come from the Constitutional Commission, enabling<br />
us to proceed to changes in the constitution which will give<br />
Local Government proper recognition. There is no doubt in<br />
my mind that such recognition is long overdue. </p>
<p>I have referred, several times, to the economic difficulties<br />
we face as a nation.<br />
For us to pull out of this situation and we willrequires<br />
the efforts of all parts of our society. It is<br />
simply not Ea case of our manufacturers producing more, or<br />
our farmers producing more efficiently.<br />
we have called upon the private sector to sharpen its<br />
performance, to become more outward looking, to adopt more<br />
innovative management and work practices, to modernise plant<br />
and equipment, to give greater attention to marketing and to<br />
invest more readily in research and development.<br />
we have also encouraged the public sector to become leaneg<br />
and more efficient, to develop improved management practices<br />
geared to achieving better results and to be more responsive<br />
and accountable in its activities.<br />
A range of Public Service reforms have been introduced to<br />
modernise the Australian Public Service. We have said quite<br />
clearly to the Federal bureaucracy, do more, do it more<br />
effectively and do it with fewer resources.<br />
Local Governm~ ent, as part of the public sector of the<br />
nation, needs also to respond to these imperatives. many<br />
councils aze already doing that and have developed<br />
approaches from which other Government bodies Federal,<br />
State and Local can learn.<br />
But, of course, there remains much to be done and that is<br />
our collective challenge to work together to develop a<br />
more flexible, responsive and innovative public sector for<br />
the future.<br />
I am confident that local Government will be able to rise to<br />
meet that challenge.<br />
The National Awards for innovation in 4ocal Government<br />
provide ample evidence of its progressiveness and its<br />
strength.<br />
They enew my optimism about Local Government's future and<br />
my Government's belief in its ability to play a. significant<br />
part in strengthening our nation. </p>
