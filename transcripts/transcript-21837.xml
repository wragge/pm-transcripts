    <content><![CDATA[<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p> After two bombings in as many weeks does the government not face huge difficulties now and what kind of support are you asking from the international community?</p>
<p>JOHN REID:</p>
<p>What we ought to do is let the security services, the police get on with their job and we have got to remain vigilant but get on with our lives that is the best thing and the main thing to do. To do anything other than that is to give in to the terrorists so let the security services do their job, get on with it and let us get on with our lives.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Mr Howard what kind of support are you offering Britain now in the wake of these bombings?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p> All the support that we can make available. Mind you the emergency services in this country are very impressive. It seems to me a miracle that the loss of life on the 7th of July was not greater and the speed with which people were taken to hospital, evacuated and so forth is amazing. There is probably a number of things that we in Australia can learn from that experience but Britain can now that she has no stauncher supporter and understanding friends in Australia and that is a view I now that is shared around the world. This is a common enemy we are fighting. Anybody who thinks you can sort of subdivide the target and go away and curl up in a corner and not be noticed doesn't understand the approach that terrorists take.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>There seems to be reports that you might be taking over or offering extra support in Iraq?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p> Well our position is that we have provided additional forces and we think the current level of commitment by Australia in Iraq is right. We admire the work that the British have done, the southern part of Iraq has been the area of British operation. We are working together with each other and |I think we all want to see a situation where the Iraqi security forces are improved and gradually take over from all of us. I mean that is the goal but we have to help them along the way and we have to make sure that there is no premature withdrawal because that would result in victory for those who don't deserve victory.</p>
<p>JOHN REID:</p>
<p> I am delighted to welcome John Howard the Australian Prime Minister because I believe that our two nations who have never been closer together. Both of us have suffered and know the loss and tragedy which can be caused by terrorism and the Australians at home and abroad have stood solid against it and I think we can learn from each other and certainly the solidarity which the Australian and the British people now have is as close and as strong as it has ever been in our history and probably more so and I am delighted to welcome the Australian Prime Minister this morning. Thank you</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p> Thank you, thanks a lot.</p>
