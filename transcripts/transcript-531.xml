TEXT OF PRESS CONFERENCE GIVEN BY THE PRIME<br />
MINISTER RT. HON. R. G AiENZIES, AT THE<br />
AUSTRALIAN EM3ASSY, UASHII'GTON, DoC.. U. SoA,<br />
ON 20H JUNE, 1932,<br />
QUESTION: PRIME MINISTER:<br />
Qe P. iM. What can you tell. us, Prime Minister, of<br />
your visit to the President?<br />
Well, there's a communique out, isn't there?<br />
That says what we both find ourselves able to say,<br />
Personally, I thought the discussions were very,<br />
very helpful. They were conducted in a very<br />
helpful spirit. There has been a belief, I think,<br />
perhaps in some parts of my own country, that there<br />
is some very powerful opposition between the position<br />
of the United States in relation to the Common<br />
Market and the position of Australia, I think you<br />
could sum it all up, after the discussions I've had,<br />
by saying that the central feature was that if<br />
Great Britain goes into the Common Market, and that<br />
would be for Groat Britain to determine, both<br />
Australia and the United States, or in order of<br />
magnitude, the United States and Australia, will<br />
be outside the Common Market and will therefore<br />
have some interests in common, very considerable<br />
ones; because each of us would Isire to maintain<br />
our competitive status as a non-member of the<br />
Common Market of the European Economic Community,<br />
and that became common ground between us in the<br />
course of these talks. In order to give effect to<br />
some practical considerations you may have noticed<br />
in the communique that we said that the problems<br />
arising out of Britain's proposed entry should be<br />
approached not on any basis of theory or the use of<br />
particular word-s, but on a practical basis, examining<br />
commodities one by one, and in order to enable that<br />
examination to proceed in a practical fashion I<br />
have arranged for the Head of the Australian Trade<br />
Department, Dr. Westerman, now in London, to come<br />
across and have further discussions with'the experts<br />
ac this end√∏ I think that fact will demonstrate to<br />
you that we are not just up against a closed door,<br />
but there is a feeling that if we can get to a<br />
discussion of commodities one by one then it ought<br />
to be possible to evolve proposals in regard to<br />
commodities which would be acceptable to the United<br />
States and acceptable to us, and much more importantly,<br />
of course, acceptable to the Six, So that the<br />
position is to be regarded as a flexible one, Dr.<br />
Westermann, might explain, is our expert who put<br />
a full presentation of our case to the delegates at<br />
Brussels quite recently and he is, on the official<br />
side, our principal expert in thee negotiations.<br />
I haven't been negotiating, of course; I don't<br />
regard myself as qualified to be negotiating about<br />
a whole series of commodities, He's our expert when<br />
it gets down to the retail business; I have merely<br />
directed my mind to a few wholesale considerations.<br />
Can you tell us, Sir, what the main commodities<br />
involved are?<br />
Oh, well, there are a great number of commodities<br />
that fall into this fr-om our point of viewr There<br />
are certain base metals, particularly lead, sugar,<br />
wheat, meat of various -inds, fruit in various o./ 2 </p>
<p>PoM. forms and so on, There are probably scores and scores<br />
( Contd.) of items, but these are among the major ones that are<br />
under consideration. So far as some of them are<br />
concerned of course, we w-ould like to see world arrangements,<br />
and there is a glancing reference to that in the<br />
communique. We would like very much to see a resumption<br />
of discussions for a world whea-agreement because the<br />
wheat problem wcn! t be easily solved in the absence of a<br />
world arrangemento Similarly with metals. We think<br />
that international commodity arrangements on a world basis<br />
are very important.<br />
Qo Sir, would you put a wheat arrangement ahead of<br />
British membership or can it wait?<br />
P. M. I think the negotiations ought to go on right<br />
away, but if those negotiations succeeded, and you've<br />
got a world wheat agreement, it would take that topic<br />
out of the Common Market discussions, brt knowing something<br />
about the long distance durability of negotiations about<br />
wheat, I would think that the negotiations with the Six<br />
will have finished before the negotiations about wheat,<br />
go They don't seem to be very happy to talk about<br />
wheat while they're negotiating.<br />
P. M. That's a matter for their own judgment,<br />
Qo In that connection, Sir, there's a paragraph in<br />
the communique which says the Prime Minister offered<br />
the view that it would be a grave misunderstanding if,<br />
after the negotiations it turned out that the conditions<br />
laid down for Britain's entry were unacceptable to<br />
Commonwealth count-' ies.<br />
P, M, " Grave misfortune". That's an error, There's<br />
a misprint here. You've directed my attention to it<br />
" The Prime Minister offered the view that it would be<br />
a grave misfortune". " Misfortune" was the word<br />
" misunderstanding" doesn't make any sense<br />
" grave misfortune, if after the negotiations it turned<br />
out that the conditions laid down for Britain's entry<br />
were unacceptable to Commonwealth countries." Do you<br />
want me to explain that?<br />
Q, Did the President agree with that?<br />
P M. This is a statement of the view that I was<br />
putting. The President is not to be treated as offering<br />
a view on that matter. Very naturally, because though<br />
he has an interest in the Commonwealth, he wouldn't want<br />
to buy into a discussion of that kind, I am sureo But<br />
the point that I've been putting here is this: Let's<br />
illustrate it. Suppose as a result of the negotiations<br />
between Great Britain and the Six the best that could be<br />
obtained was that by 1970 all our present trade advantages<br />
should disappear, Suppose that happened. Great Britain<br />
would then have to choose whether to go in on those terms,<br />
terms which would involve bringing to an end the special<br />
Commonwealth pattern of trade or to stay out, Now, that's<br />
a pretty grave dilema because to stay out would be to<br />
forego, what I believe is regarded in Great Britain and<br />
here, as the matorial advantage of Great Britain being in<br />
the European Economic Community and yet to go in, to<br />
get those advantages on terms , which involves the termination<br />
of what I ve called the Com. monwealth pattorn by 1970 would,<br />
I am perfectly certaLin, be unaccoptable to the Commronwealth<br />
countries, And therefore this classical choice that's<br />
0 6 * 0@ S o/ 3 </p>
<p>PCM.<br />
( Contd0 been talked about a good deal Europe or the Commonwealth<br />
would present itself in a singularly naked formr That,<br />
I think, must be avoided, and one of my objects has been<br />
to emphasise here, in Washington, the nature of that<br />
choice and I must say that I've been quite pleased with<br />
the understanding of that point that I've encountered<br />
and a willingness to sit down ar. d discuss, commodity<br />
by commodity, ways and means which might be put forward<br />
for preserving the competitive status of Australia, for<br />
example, and, at the same time, the competitive status<br />
of the United States much larger interests in some<br />
things but as I said earlier, both of us outside the<br />
Common Market and both of us anxious that the Common<br />
Market should not be established in such a fashion as<br />
to inflict damage on us or to prevent us either the<br />
United States Or Australia from proper economic growth.<br />
These are wide, general words, of course0 They have<br />
to be, but the thing I attach great importance to is<br />
the co-operative spirit behind them,<br />
Is ome year other than 1970 acceptable to you?<br />
What do you mean later? Well, that can't be answered<br />
simply yes or no. There are some commodities on which<br />
we would hope to have a world agreement made and under<br />
those circumstances, special a: rangements made at this<br />
stage would need to be permanent. They would be merged<br />
into a world agreement when it was arrived at. There<br />
are other cases in which, where we now have tariff<br />
preferences in our favour, these preferences would<br />
become negotiable as they say, in GATT, because that<br />
is the machinery that is provided for negotiating about<br />
these matters. You give up a right in order to obtain<br />
one, You do a bit of horse trading. But the machinery<br />
of C! ATT has always beon available for that purpose and<br />
if negotiations of that kind occur, then the existing<br />
state of affairs would terminate. But you can't put<br />
a date to either of those things, they merely exhibit<br />
two possible avenues by which one procedure will be<br />
taken up and merged in another.<br />
In paragraph 2, on page 2, you said it was<br />
agreed that the problems should be approached not on<br />
any basis of theory or the use of particular words<br />
does this refer to 2Astralia's insistence on comparable<br />
outlets. There have been, I think, two words or phrases<br />
that have had a good deal of currency. One is the<br />
great word " preference" on which almost theological<br />
arguments have been going on, to my knowledge, for<br />
thirty years, and w. e agree to disagree, but on this<br />
occasion, I said, " Well, let's forget about the words,"<br />
because words don't matter very much; and, similarly,<br />
we have boon putting forward alternative proposals to<br />
the Six and through Great Britain, for what's been<br />
called ' comparcble outlets", Well if that is a<br />
phrase that excites opposition, lots forget about the<br />
phrase, In other words, it may be that we can evolve<br />
some comparable outlets, without calling them such, and<br />
maintain some of the benefits that we have had in the<br />
past without putting a particular label on them. This<br />
is a purely pragmatic approach, and I t. hink we both<br />
agree that we ought to move away from the world of dogma<br />
and become pragmatic on those matters, And that's the<br />
drill. O tcaone/<br />
P. M.<br />
P. M. </p>
<p>Q. P<br />
S P. 140<br />
0o P .21 Mr. Prime Minister, Soviet Premier Khrushchev<br />
offered a proposal for a world-wide trade organization,<br />
would you have any comment on that? And there was<br />
another related question What is Australiats position<br />
on trade with the Communist countries? Do you favour<br />
more restrictions or less restrictions on that trade?<br />
A world-wide trade organization, did you<br />
say? I wouldn't have thought that was practical<br />
politics, so stated. You can deal with a commodity,<br />
or commodities, on a world basis, There are one or<br />
two now which are the subject of world arrangement, but<br />
when you say, " Let's have a world wide trade organization''<br />
well, frankly, I don't know what it means. It will<br />
become so general in its description as to be ineffective.<br />
As far as we are concerned, we trade with Communist<br />
countries, yes. We export substantial quantities of<br />
wool and wheat. Recently, the Australian wheat farmers<br />
have sold quite large parcels of wheat to Communist<br />
China and the volume of trade is not big, but in the<br />
case of wheat it has recently been fairly substantial<br />
because of the shortages of foodstuffs in Communist<br />
China. We have certain rules that we apply about<br />
strategic materials. If the External Affairs Department<br />
regards any particular material as of strategic<br />
significance, then we won't export it to Communist<br />
Chinr, but that's a limited list. Again, I think you<br />
could take it that our attitude is not a doctrinaire<br />
one. If Jones won't buy our wheat, then somebody<br />
will have to stop growing wheat unless Brown buys it<br />
instead. This is purely a practical approach to the<br />
matter, It is generally assumed that Australia is very<br />
interested in a peaceful settlement of the West New<br />
Guinea dispute. Did you soo some kind of role, either<br />
direct or indirect, on the part of Australia in trying<br />
to get this peaceful settlement through the Bunker<br />
proposals? I would have thought the first condition for<br />
a peaceful settlement of the West New Guinea problem<br />
was for Indonesia to stop making war. I mean, that's<br />
very simple. Then there would be an atmosphere of<br />
peace and I think, myself, there'd be great hope of<br />
getting a peaceful settlement, The two parties don't<br />
appear to be all that distance apart over the Bunker<br />
proposals, There are differences of emphasis and<br />
differences of timetable but, really, in principle, I<br />
would have thought it was negotiable. But the atmosphere<br />
is clouded because of this quite extraordinary maintenance<br />
of armod hostilities by one of the parties while the<br />
talks are about to be resumed. I don't profess to<br />
understand it, I, myself, have twice received<br />
categorical assurances that arms would not be resorted<br />
to in support of the clains once by President Sookarno<br />
himself; on the other occasion by Dr. Subandrio, the<br />
Foreign Ministero It is a very unhappy affair, but<br />
I am sure that if a peaceful settlenont is desired it<br />
would be mnuch quicker if the hostilities so initiated<br />
were dropped, Mr. Prime Minister, do you favour the French<br />
idea of a high price for wheat and a limited market?<br />
Don't ask no to go into the details of the<br />
matter because, first of all, they are very complex<br />
and, secondly, it's not my business on this visit to<br />
discuss thoem CPojo </p>
<p>Qo Mr, Prime Minister, from what Mr. Heath has<br />
said in London, it looks as if " he draft agreerent for<br />
Britain's entry into the Common Market will be ready<br />
by July. Have you any comment on that?<br />
PM. Well, Mr. Heath is in the best position to know,<br />
I grant you. We are having a conference of Prime<br />
Ministers in September. In August, as you know,<br />
official London is not a hive of activity, and therefore,<br />
if the comprehensive series of proposals are to be put<br />
to the Commonwealth Prime Ministers, they will need to<br />
have been formulated by the end of July. As a mtter<br />
of pure reason, that's right. But when I left London,<br />
some of the senior people were somewhat doubtful as to<br />
whether there would be such a comprehensive list by<br />
that time, brt what they did hope was that some of the<br />
major matters might have been negotiated so that the<br />
Prime Ministers could see, in the broau, the shape of<br />
things to come. Indeed they must get to that point<br />
because they meet on September 10th and it's no use<br />
going over there just to speculate about what might<br />
happen. It's much better to argue abcut what will<br />
Shappen, or what will probably happen or what can happen.<br />
Qo Sir, would the enactment of the Trade Bill in<br />
Congress here be a workable alternative to the accommodation<br />
you are seeking with the<br />
PoM. In itself, I wouldn't think so. No, It will<br />
facilitate negotiations, yes,<br />
Q. Mr. Prime Minister, would you comment on the<br />
situation in South East Asia, and more particularly<br />
on the role of SEATO? Do you think it's finished, or<br />
is it a going concern?<br />
P. M. I don't think that SEATO is by any means finished.<br />
So far as Laos is concerned, well, we are all looking<br />
forward now hoping, and I think not unreasonably, that<br />
the now government arrangements that have been made will<br />
work and that Laos will be able to take her position as<br />
a free and independent and neutral country. If that<br />
happens, the position of Thailand becomes more stable, less<br />
threatened. Of course the actively troubling spot at<br />
the moment is South Vietnam, but I think there is reason<br />
to believe that the position there is improving and I,<br />
myself, am pretty optimistic about it; in the absence,<br />
of course, of interventions by people not at present<br />
engaged. By and large, I think SEiTO, although its<br />
means are not v'ry extensive, has been a very useful<br />
instrument and it has maintained.. and attracted, the<br />
support of its members United States, Great Britain,<br />
ourselves, for example, have all come to the party, both<br />
economically and otherwise. I think that as a result<br />
of all these things, there is a strungthening of morale<br />
in South East Asia, and a growing disposition to resist<br />
being overrun by other people. And anything that can<br />
be done to strengthen that patriotic, sensible view,<br />
ought to be done, I know that it's rather popular<br />
from time to time to say that SEATO doesn't matter,<br />
I think it does. </p>
