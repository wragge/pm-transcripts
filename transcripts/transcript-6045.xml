PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR XEFDIA -SNAj6MRH1983<br />
A FIN4AL MSAETO AUSTRALIANS<br />
I congratulate Mr Hawke and the Auetxralian* Labor Party on*<br />
winning the election.<br />
Mr H~ awks has set a nutiber of high goals for Australia in a<br />
time of great economic difficulty around the world. If he and<br />
his party can fulfil the expectations presented to the<br />
electorate then Australia will be advantaged.<br />
Whatever our problems, Australia has been handed to Mr Hawke's<br />
new government in a condition that is equal to or better than<br />
ary other Western country.<br />
Las t night T resigne'd. from the le adership of the Parliamentary<br />
Liberal Party. I r'eaffirm that I will not contest the leadership<br />
of the Party,<br />
I have taken complete responsibility for the timing and conduct'<br />
of the election, and therefore have taken complete responsibility<br />
for the defeat of the Coalition Government.<br />
After a little over seven years as Prime Minister there are many<br />
people I would wish to thank. t cannot name them all here. But.<br />
1 wish to place on rec9rd my deep appreciation for the conitmeit<br />
and effort by Doug Anthony,-my Cabinet, my ministry and the<br />
entire Parliamentary Party to the government of Australia.<br />
I wish to place on record also m anko to my personal staff,*<br />
my Department, and party members i , oughout Australia for their<br />
unceasing support. To the electo..
for their loyalty and overwhelm' 4 ort,<br />
It has been a great honour-and 1. ege to have been Prime<br />
Minister of Australia.<br />
Duri. ng the election T said that what happened to Malcolm Fraser<br />
as an individual was cf no account. T meant that. But what<br />
happenF to Australia, to our way of life and to the kind of<br />
country we leatve our c1; f~ r~ ren is of great an4; 1lasting significance.<br />
The values and principler by which we live, the human relationships<br />
which quide us, and thce values to which we aspire as Liberals will1<br />
not chaage.<br />
