Prime Minister Julia Gillard today welcomed the announcement by President Karzai of the first seven provinces and districts to begin the transition to Afghan security responsibility from July of this year.</p>
<p>President Karzai's decision is a significant step toward the Afghan Government's goal of assuming lead responsibility for security across Afghanistan by the end of 2014. </p>
<p>The Prime Minister also welcomed President Karzai's call for reconciliation and constructive regional engagement.</p>
<p>The decision to begin the transition in these seven areas was based on an assessment of the security, governance and development conditions on the ground. </p>
<p>Transition is a process, not an event, and Australia and its International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) partners will continue to support Afghanistan as the mission progresses.</p>
<p>The transition process was agreed at the Lisbon Summit in November 2010 by the 48 nations of ISAF.</p>
<p>The key challenge for the Afghan Government and ISAF is to ensure that transition is sustainable and irreversible.</p>
<p>Australia will continue to train and mentor the Fourth Brigade of the Afghan National Army in Uruzgan as well as train police and support the Provincial Government to improve the delivery of basic services to the people of the province. </p>
<p>We expect the transition in Uruzgan province and its districts will begin in the next one to three years.</p>
<p>Australia is working towards this transition with the Afghan National Security Forces and our partners in Combined Team  -  Uruzgan; the United States, New Zealand, Singapore and Slovakia.  </p>
