TRANSCRIPT OF SPEECH AND QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS FROM JAPAN<br />
NATIONAL PRESS CLUB TOKYO 16 MAY 1986<br />
Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen we should like to<br />
start this press conf~ erence given by Hon. Prime Minister<br />
of Australia, The Hon. Robert Hawke. As manyof you<br />
know already Mr Hawke became the Prime MInister of Australia<br />
in March 1983 and his visit to Japan this time is his secondI<br />
visit to Japan and last time when he was in Japan was in<br />
1984 and at that time on the 2nd February he was so kind<br />
as to come to our Japan National Press Club and give<br />
us a press conference that time as well. And I am led<br />
to understand that he has wide ranging recreations and<br />
hobbies which include reading, cricket and<br />
and also he has started playing and enjoying golf recently<br />
but his handicap is a state secret so we should not<br />
inquire about it.<br />
One more addition is that as again it is very well known<br />
his high popularity among ladies and ladies d gtr<br />
is a pronounced phenomenon and also in-' the past! xee rde<br />
himself on his large capacity for alcoholic intake. Howevzer<br />
nowadays because he is busy in his official duties and<br />
his utter devotion to his work. he has stopped drinking,<br />
About the proceedings of this press conference today at<br />
the outset the Hon. Prime Minister will give us a short<br />
remark-for about a few minutes and then I understand<br />
he is so kind as to entertain as many questions as time<br />
and the interpreter for you today is<br />
and your Master of Ceremonies is...<br />
and I hope you will cooperate with my inexperience aof<br />
ceremonies. </p>
<p>PM: Well, Mr D I had to come along way to find<br />
some of the secrets of the past unfold by you. Thank you<br />
very much indeed. As you have indicated, I will take a little<br />
time in beginning making a statement and I apologise to my<br />
Australian colleagues because a fair bit of what I will needto<br />
say to our Japanese friends I have already conveyed to them.<br />
I have had the opportunity of very cordial and constructive<br />
discussions with PM Nakasone and with Foreign Minister Abe<br />
Finance Minister Takeshita, MITI Minister Watanabe and<br />
Agriculture Minister Hata and a number of parliamentarians<br />
concerned with agricultural issues.<br />
The major topic of our discussions was of course the Tokyo<br />
Summit and I appreciated the willingness of Japan to put<br />
as they did at the Summit that Agriculture should have a common<br />
place inthe new MTN round, that it was expected that there should<br />
be decisive progress made at the September Ministerial meetiqg<br />
to launch the new round and that in the meantime the work<br />
to be done in the OECD context will serve as prepantion<br />
for negotiating process and I also in this context<br />
expressed our satisfaction at the cooperation extended by<br />
Japan with our regional trade initiative. </p>
<p>I noted the reassurance of Mr Nakasone that the<br />
participants of the Summit have been prepared to take into<br />
account the interetts of non-summit agricultural producers<br />
and thanked him for taking our concerns and putting them<br />
before the Summit participants.<br />
Another major issue that was discussed was the restructuring<br />
of the Australian and Japanese economies. In the case of<br />
Japan the important backdrop is the Maekawa report, market<br />
opening measures and the realignment of currencies involving<br />
the substantial appreciation of the yen.<br />
I welcomed the opportunities which ! these presented<br />
to Australia. I expressed regret that so little had been<br />
achieved so far in respect of agricultural products. I noted<br />
that the Maekawa report was the most postiive step in recent<br />
times and I can say that Prime Minister Nakasone responded<br />
that the Japanese leadership is pledged to promote implementation<br />
of the report and that this process hff now only just begun.<br />
I suggested to PM Nakasone that it was a propitious time<br />
to agree to an exchange between Japan and Australia of<br />
investment missions and the Prime Minister agreed to this<br />
proposal in principle with the details and timings to be<br />
worked out now in discussions between government and private<br />
sector people.<br />
We both noted with pleasure that our trading relationship<br />
is already broadening as a result firstly of the Australia<br />
Japan Market Strategy, secondly it was a very significant<br />
increases in tourism and also in the area of finance and<br />
banking particularly as a result of significant deregulation<br />
of financial sector and the introduction of a number of<br />
foreign banks including three from Japan.<br />
I emphasised to the Japanese leadership the Japanese market<br />
for our traditional exports remain vital and I stressed<br />
to them Australian reliability and i ' nternational competitiveness<br />
in both minerals and agricultural products.<br />
I pointed to the 5 advantages to Japan for a more liberalised<br />
regime of agricultural imports. Those 5 advan-tages are:<br />
reduced food costs and prices for Japanese consumers;<br />
release of resources in this country for more productive<br />
uses; lowering of your trade surplus and alleviation or<br />
assistance in alleviating the international agricultural<br />
crises, and a increased stability of supplies at lower cott.<br />
I discussed several issues relating to our mineral exports<br />
and in relation to coal where a review of Japanese policies<br />
in regard to coal industry may open up new opportunities.<br />
I stressed that Australia would have a very strong interest<br />
in competing on a commercial basis for any additional tonnages.<br />
I said that we would not be seeking any special advantages but </p>
<p>would be relying on our competitiveness and reliability<br />
as a supplier to the Japanese market and I received<br />
reassurances from Mr Nakasone and other leaders that<br />
Japan would not be proceeding in this area with any bilateral.<br />
arrangements at Australia's expense.<br />
I laid particular stress on all this area about discussions<br />
on the outstanding record that's been achieved under<br />
my government in the area of industrial relations. I pointed<br />
out that the level of industrial disputes in Australia is<br />
now down to the lon st level in two decades and that was<br />
in the context of/ us tral ia which is I would suggest is in<br />
amongst the most politically stable countries in the world<br />
and that this concept of new industrial stability and political<br />
stability is something which ought sensibly to be taken into<br />
account by Japan in making decisions as to its source of<br />
supplies. Then may I we also had a useful exchange of views, the<br />
Prime Minister and myself on other major matters that arose<br />
at the Summit included terrorism, the US/ Soviet talks on<br />
arms control, the Chernobyl incident and the need to strengthen<br />
the International Atomic Energy Agency machinery. I indicated<br />
on the latter point that we have recently written to Mr Gorbachev<br />
calling for his support for an Australian initiative for<br />
a meeting of the IAEA authorities with a view to creating<br />
a new international convention to establish the basis for<br />
exchanges of information in the event of any nuclear incidents<br />
or accidents.<br />
And finally, we also discussed a number of issues that are<br />
important to both our countries including recent developments<br />
in the Philippines, ANZUS, Japan's relations with China<br />
and also the involvement of Japan in the bi-centennial celebrations<br />
in Australia in 1988 which I expressed the extreme gratitude of<br />
the Australian government and people for the 4egree of involvement<br />
by Japan. I expressed this gratitude to both Mr Nakasone and<br />
to the Committee which is involved in mobilising<br />
private sector support.<br />
JOURNALIST: ACcording to the information TI have just received<br />
from the US, DOD of the US made an ann * ouncement that in the<br />
RIMPAC 86 scheduled to start onfie 18 inthe Pacific Oceanin<br />
that connection US has made a decision not to invite<br />
New Zealand -to take part in the RIMPAC 86 First of all<br />
I should like to confirm this information if it is true or<br />
not and if this is true then I should like to invite your<br />
comment and views on this particular US decision and I<br />
understand that its one question eabh but a related question<br />
if I may I should like to ask you the following. That after<br />
the Prime Minister Lange's regime came into power in New<br />
Zealand the ANZUS treaty has been in a state of de facto<br />
holding and whereas Australia consistently expressed a wish<br />
to normalise the ANZUS treaty situation does this mean that<br />
you wish to see the change in the New Zealand non-nuclear<br />
policy and in this connection do you see any possiblity for<br />
the New Zealand nuclear policy to change. </p>
<p>PM: Let me take that point by point. In regard to<br />
participation by NZ in RIMPAC 86 for the US to adopt<br />
that attitude would be a logical extension of thep position<br />
that they ahve adopted since the announcement of the NZ<br />
position a considerable period of time ago. They have hrot<br />
continued the military cooperation which had characterised<br />
the previcus position. To go to the next part of your<br />
question, let me say this. That we in Australia since<br />
the Lange government came to power and made their position<br />
known in regard to the non availability of their ports<br />
for ships of the US which I-nuclear armed or<br />
powered that it is'for New Zealand to make up<br />
its own mind about its policy. We've aaid we don't agree<br />
with it but we have not sought to force change upon them<br />
nor have we acted as an intermediary for the US.<br />
We have taken the view that that is a matter for resolution<br />
between the US and NZ. You asked me whether I believe<br />
there is likely to be any change in the policy of NZ. I<br />
must say that on-ithe best information available to me<br />
I would think. not. Now, our position is that if NZ goes ahead<br />
with policy and ek-~ sthat in legislation and the<br />
US in those circumstances announces an end to its commitment<br />
to NZ under ANZUS we have said that our relationship<br />
commitments, rights and obligations under ANZUS would remain<br />
operative, that we would believe that the most appropriate way<br />
of recognising that would be by exchange of letters between<br />
President Reagan and myself, that the normal treaty should<br />
be left in existance so that should at some later stage<br />
NZ wish to resume its position under the treaty it would<br />
be able to do so. The final point I make is this. That<br />
we have made it clear and this is accepted and understood<br />
and agreed by the US that Australia will maintain a bilateral<br />
defence cooperation arrangement with NZ because of the<br />
obvious need for us to be able to maintain approprite capacity<br />
and operative capacity within our immedaite region.<br />
JOURNALIST: Japan National Press Club:<br />
Prime Minister Hawke I understand you will be visiting the<br />
People's Republic of China after your stay in Japan and<br />
now I think some interest is shown towards China in Australia<br />
with the prospect that China may be intaking more of<br />
the Australian iron ore and coal and I understand that there.<br />
is now a takeover shall I say of Chinese fever over the<br />
very strong interest with China in Australia and so in thisconnection<br />
Mr Prime Minister how do you view the state<br />
of Chinese economy and the Chinese economy per se and also<br />
would you be placing more emphasis on Australia and Chinese<br />
relationship in the future compared to the Australian/ Japanese<br />
relationship? </p>
<p>PM This question opens up very broad issues. Let me try<br />
briefly to make these relevant points. Yes, the relationship<br />
between Australia and China is developing rapidly. There<br />
has in the last couple of years been a doubling in trade between<br />
us. You refer to iron ore and coal. That is an important<br />
area but we also have agreements with China umbrella type<br />
agreements not only in iron and steel but in nonferreus<br />
metals and in wool and textiles and in the area of transport.<br />
We see a significant future for development of trade between<br />
our two countries. You asked me what is our perception<br />
of what is happening in China. I make no secret of the fact<br />
that I believe the single most important event that is occuring<br />
in the world today is the revolution that is taking place<br />
in China. It is important for the people of China, it is<br />
important for the region, I believe it is important for the<br />
world and we will do all that we can to assist in the<br />
opening up of the eonomic system in China and the opening<br />
up of the Chinese economy to the rest of the world. We<br />
regard this as a matter not simply of possible benefit<br />
to Australia itself but of significance as I say for the<br />
entire global community. You asked Wether the<br />
development of that relationship would be at the expense<br />
of the relationship with Japan. The answer is no. We are<br />
a country of vast resources, we've got a lot of resources<br />
that you won't buy, that we wish you would if other will<br />
buy them we will welcome that but there will still be enough<br />
there to meet any expansion in demand that Japan may wish to<br />
call upon us. It is not a question of setting Cfina off against<br />
Japan. We regard both relationships as currently important<br />
and of continuing importance in the forseeable future. </p>
<p>t JOURNALIST: David Gee, ABC NEWS. Mr Hawke, can you clarify the<br />
position of the conference on the economy, the committee summit<br />
or whatever it is being called, that Mr Keating announced today<br />
who will be there, what will be discussed, is the Accord on the<br />
table to be discussed or renegotiated, will the promised tax<br />
cuts be given as planned and when did you discuss this with<br />
Mr Keating?<br />
PM: Could I say to my Japanese friends I thought I had just<br />
done a quick negotiation with the Australian contingent to<br />
deal with these esoteric matters separately. But that's not<br />
done so I want-. to assure you my friends that while it may<br />
sound very esoteric to you, it is a matter of significant<br />
importance to our friends and to myself..-. So if you will<br />
excuse me I will address myself to this important question.<br />
The regular meeting of the advisory council on prices and<br />
incomes was held Melbourne this morning and as I am informed<br />
a discussion developed there in regard to the question of<br />
balance of payments and current account considerations. It<br />
was put by the business representatives there that they<br />
weren't in the same position as the ACTU to discuss these<br />
matters with the Government. My colleagues who were there,<br />
Mr Keating and Mr Willis, responded that they should feel<br />
themselves free to be just as much involved in such a discussion<br />
and it was in no circumstances that a discussion, a quite<br />
detailed discussion developed about these issues. Out of those<br />
discussions it was agreed that there should be a special<br />
meeting called which ACTU, the business organisations, the<br />
States and the Government and perhaps some others should be<br />
called hopefully within the next couple of weeks to discuss<br />
matters relevant to these issues of balance of payments and<br />
current account problems. As I understand there is I agreement<br />
which I welcome that nothing should be excluded from these<br />
discussions which are regarded by participants as relevant.<br />
I believe that this development out of this morning meeting<br />
is to be welcomed and I hope that the meeting can be held<br />
very soon after my return to Australia.<br />
JOURNALIST: SANKEI NEWSPAPER: I should like to ask the following<br />
two questions as regards the South Pacific region. Australia<br />
has put forth the idea of a South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone<br />
Treaty and would you not think that such a treaty may exert<br />
annegativt7impact to the security of the western nations or the<br />
security of the west in the future in the sense that the<br />
security of the west based on the . centreing around the<br />
-nuclear element or the nuclear partition that is my first. point.<br />
My other point is that the Soviet Union concluded a fisheries<br />
treaty with Kiribati ( section inaudible) </p>
<p>What do you think of the background of the Soviet move<br />
as such and what do you think of the motivation and<br />
objectives behind the Soviet move and if in case the<br />
Soviet Union may make further inroads into the South<br />
Pacific in this way what sort of measures or countermeasures<br />
will Australia be taking?<br />
PM: Firstly the South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone treaty<br />
we would not have initiatctc the move for the South<br />
Pacific Nuclear Free Zone treaty as I did on becoming<br />
Prime Minister in 1983 at the first meeting of the South<br />
Pacific forum in Canberra that year if we had believed<br />
that the conclusion of such a treaty would prejudice<br />
our existing security arrangements and we fully informed<br />
the US of the moves that we were taking and indicated that<br />
with the conclusion of this treaty there would be no<br />
interference at all with the existing treaty rights and<br />
obligations and commitments. The treaty covers the question<br />
of nuclear testing in the region, the actual position and<br />
storage of nuclear weapons and the questionof Hmping<br />
of the nuclear waste. We believe that this is/ extremely<br />
worthwhile advance in our region and it is our judgement<br />
and I think in the understanding of the US entirely<br />
consistent with our pre-obligations so therefore we don't<br />
accept that it will havei na nv ovuardverse impact on western<br />
security as you raised/ question. Secondly in regards to the<br />
extension of Soviet influence. Let me make these Points.<br />
As we have made it clear to the US we believe that there was<br />
a degree of neglect in the conduct of the US relations with<br />
some of the island countries in the South Pacific that<br />
toomuch of the American interests in that area have been<br />
left to the American Tuna Boat Association and the activities<br />
of that Association have in our judgement not been conducive<br />
to the establishment of good relations as far as the US and<br />
countries of that region are concerned. It was within that<br />
environment thiat the Soviet Union was able in fact to conclude<br />
a fisheries agreement with Kiribati and they are<br />
currently negotiating with Vanuatu. We have not welcomed<br />
those developments but I believe it should not be an over<br />
exaggeration of them. It is significant that the US has<br />
been now some time engaged in meaningful constructive negotiations<br />
with the countries of the South Pacific under the forum<br />
fisheries arraijgement in an attempt * to achieve a multilateral<br />
fishing agreement. Very considerable progress, has now been<br />
made on that and if that is finalised then I think much of<br />
the context within which the Soviet Union has been able to<br />
make these limited advances will be neutralised. We, Australia<br />
maintian a very effective defence cooperationprogram with the<br />
countries of the region, we will continue that. One particular<br />
aspect of it is the provision of patrol boats which will be<br />
manufactured in Australia and provided to other countries in<br />
the South Pacific who request them. So in tbtal in answer<br />
to your second question I say we don't welcome developments<br />
but we don't exaggerate the concerns attached to them'~ and<br />
we are possibly doing those things which we believe will<br />
strengthen the relationship of our country and our allies<br />
with the countries of the region. 7 </p>
<p>JANET SLATE FROM UPI: you were talking about trade<br />
bilateral trade arrangements at Australia's expense. Australia<br />
has long expressed -satisfaction with the beef quota situation<br />
here in Japan which does lean heavily toward imports of US<br />
beef. What sort of contrary proposals did you make in your<br />
discussions here in Tokyo to enlarge the Austrlian pke of the<br />
pie should we say?<br />
PM: I perhaps should say the beef stew. The two fings.<br />
Firstly, I madethe point that as a -sult of the very significant<br />
appreciation of the yen it should be possible to have at least<br />
a significant reduction inprices for the beef which I believe<br />
should therefore allow an increase in imports and in that<br />
context I suggested that it be approprite that Australia<br />
should have a reasonable opportunity to take advantage of<br />
any such increase which would mean benefit to us and at the<br />
same time considerable benefits to the Japanese consumer.<br />
The second point I contented myself with was to point out<br />
that the agreement expires in 1988 and I hope that the<br />
Japanese can agree to an early start on the negotiations<br />
so that new situation to arise out of the negotiations<br />
between inaudible...... </p>
<p>JOURNALIST: David Gee, ABC NEWS. Mr Hawke, can you clarify the<br />
position of the conference on the economy, the committee summit<br />
or whatever it is being called, that Mr Keating announced today<br />
who will be there, what will be discussed, is the Accord on the<br />

deal with these esoteric matters separately. But that's not<br />
done so I want to assure you my friends that while it may<br />
sound very esoteric to you, it is a matter of significant<br />
importance to our friends and to myself.:. So if you will<br />
excuse me I will address myself to this important question.<br />
