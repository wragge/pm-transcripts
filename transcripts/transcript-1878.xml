' 09 1~ a, VISIT TO SOUTH EAST ASIA 1968<br />
MALAYSIA<br />
ARRIVAL STATEMENT MADE BY THE PRIME MINISTER,<br />
MR. JOHN GORTON 11 JUNE 1968<br />
I am glad to have this opportunity to visit Malaysia soon after<br />
taking office as Prime Minister of Australia. Our two countries have long<br />
been in warm and friendly association. I look forward with pleasure to once<br />
again meeting'and talking with your revered Prime Minister and his colleagues,<br />
so many of whom are well known to us in Australia.<br />
It is a pleasant experience to fly into K,, uala Lumpur and see<br />
this beautiful and well laid out city and the attractive, prosperous countryside<br />
which surrounds it. Over the years, peaceful suburbs and rural development<br />
have transformed areas which were once the scenes of bitter conflict. The<br />
peace and harmony in Malaysia is the more noticeable because I have recently<br />
been in South Vietnam. a country and people still suffering the ravages of<br />
war. Yet one can take heart from what Malaysia has succeeded in<br />
doing. For Malaysia too has had its trial by fire. You were ableto overcome<br />
the challenge of insurrection, long continued, and having overcome go on to<br />
develop a progressive nation. This must encourage all small countries subject<br />
to aggression or externally-inspired subversion.<br />
Malaysia is a living example of what can be achieved in the<br />
Asian region by a Government dedicated to national development and to<br />
expanding opportunities for its peoples. We in Australia admire the increasing<br />
part that Malaysia is playing in regional affairs, both in its direct contacts<br />
with neighbouring countries and through its membership of the regional<br />
organisations and groupings that are being established to promote the sense<br />
of community and the common purpose of the region. And we look to close<br />
co-operation with Malaysia in these endeavours.<br />
These are among the matters I shall be discussing during my<br />
stay in Kuala Lumpur. I hope, too, to give your Government an account of my<br />
visit to Vietnam. Although my visit is not directly connected with the Five-<br />
Power talks, I shall hope to hear Malaysian views on the progress of the talks.<br />
While in Malaysia, I will visit Australian forces at Terendak and at Butterworth. </p>
