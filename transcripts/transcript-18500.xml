Australia condemns North Korea's decision today to launch a satellite on a long-range missile.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Julia Gillard said she understood the launch failed.</p>
<p>Regardless of its outcome, this launch was provocative and dangerous.</p>
<p>It directly contradicted the most recent assurances received from North Korea and was in open defiance of unanimously adopted United Nations Security Council resolutions.</p>
<p>We urge the Security Council to meet urgently to consider a robust response.</p>
<p>North Korea's nuclear and long-range missile programs and its proliferation of sensitive technologies present a real and credible threat to the security of Australia and our region.</p>
<p>Senator Carr said Australia was disappointed by North Korea's provocative gesture in launching the missile after recent positive discussions with the United States and South Korea.</p>
<p>As recently as February, North Korea had agreed to implement a moratorium on long-range missile launches.</p>
<p>âSince July last year, South Korean and United States discussions with North Korea have raised hopes for progress on denuclearisation,â Senator Carr said.</p>
<p>âBut today's launch, in contravention of North Korea's own assurance, is a provocative act that will set back negotiations.â</p>
<p>Australia will be expressing its concerns to the North Koreans directly and working constructively with our allies and partners in the region to support the stability of the Korean peninsula and the security of the Republic of Korea and the broader region. </p>
