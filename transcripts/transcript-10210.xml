Fax from Native Title Issues<br />
Arrangements have been made today for a meeting in Sydney on<br />
Wednesday morning with State Premiers and the Chief Minister of the<br />
Northern. Territory to discuss native title issues in the wake of the High<br />
Court decision in the Wik case.<br />
At my request, the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander<br />
Affairs, Senator Herron,, has spoken to ATSIC Chairman Gatjil Djerrkura<br />
with a view to arranging a meeting between myself and a representative<br />
group of Aboriginal leaders so that I can obtain their views on the same<br />
issue. Representatives of the mining and pastoral industries will also be asked to<br />
participate in discussions with me in the days ahead.<br />
The views obtained in all these discussions will be taken into account by<br />
the Government. This is a complex issue which requires a conmnonsense<br />
response in the national interest.<br />
