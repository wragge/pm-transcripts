PRIME MINISTER<br />
22 October 1996 TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
THE HON. JOHN HOWARD MP<br />
ADDRESS TO THE FEDERAL CABINET LUNCHEON<br />
HILTON INTERNATIONAL, ADELAIDE<br />
E&amp; OE<br />
Thank you very much Dean Brown, the Premnier of South Australia, to Mrs Roslyn<br />
Brown, to Tim Fischer, the Deputy Prime Minister of Australia, my other Cabinet<br />
colleagues, Members of Parliament, ladies and gentlemen.<br />
It's a delight to be back again in Adelaide. I've been a frequent visitor as the Leader of<br />
the Liberal Party to this State since I resumed that job in January of last year. And today's<br />
meeting of the Federal Cabinet here in Adelaide is part of a deliberate pattern of Cabinet<br />
meetings which I promised would be followed in the lead up to the election whereby<br />
instead of always meeting in Canberra, plus occasionally meeting in Sydney and<br />
Melbourne, we would as well visit all of the other State capitals and over a period of three<br />
years some of the major provincial centres of Australia. There is more to Australia than<br />
the Melbourne-Sydney-Canberra triangle admirable though that part of the world may<br />
be. And it is very important having seen our predecessors receive a rousing send off from<br />
the less popular states in the regional areas of Australia it's very important that we don't<br />
forget that lesson and we don't intend, and we intend to have our meetings around<br />
Australia early and not late in our term, thereby giving the impression that we're just<br />
trying to play a bit of catch up politics before the election.<br />
I mnight also say that I speak to a South Australian audience conscious of the fact that I<br />
don't believe, since the war, the Liberal Party representation in the Federal Cabinet has<br />
been as high and at such a senior level as it is in my Government. There are no fewer than<br />
four out of the 15 Cabinet Ministers, I stress Cabinet Ministers, who come from South<br />
Australia. That is a tribute to their ability. When putting these things together one has to<br />
pay some regard to geography, but you're not a slave to geography, and it's a tribute to<br />
the quality of the representation that this State has sent. And of course, I'm warmed by </p>
<p>the fact that at the last Federal election you only returned two Labor Members in the<br />
House of Representatives and I think that's a remarkable strike rate.<br />
Can I say on a frankly political note what an extraordinary win the Liberal Party did have<br />
in the Lindsay by-election on Saturday. In 1993 the Labor Party primary vote in the seat<br />
of Lindsay was 58.5%. Last Saturday it was 33.5%, which is an astonishing decline. And<br />
it is a seat, despite all the attempts of some of the spin doctors since to say it was really a<br />
safe Labor seat, I mean it had never been held by other than the Labor Party after the last<br />
election, so you know, if it looks like a safe Labor seat and it quacks like a safe Labor seat<br />
and votes like a safe Labor seat I reckon it must be a safe Labor seat. So it was a terrific<br />
result and it's an enormous tribute to a very young, energetic candidate in Jackie Kelly,<br />
who I can assure you will get a really warm reception when she comes back to Federal<br />
Parliament next Monday to be sworn in as the Member for Lindsay. It's a reminder that<br />
when the Australian public, after having had a government of one political persuasion in<br />
power for a long time, makes up its mind to change it, doesn't really like people trying to<br />
question that decision for a period of time. There is a view in the Australian community<br />
that new Governments ought to be given a fair go. They shouldn't be given a blank<br />
cheque or license but they should be given a fair go. And there is a sense in the<br />
Australian community which says, well we threw the other crowd out, we put this new lot<br />
in, let's give them a couple of years and we'll see what they're like and if at the end of that<br />
period we're not too happy well we might start sending a few rebukes.<br />
I think that is the mood of the Australian community. I don't take anything for granted in<br />
politics, I've been in it long enough to know that you can have changes. There's a<br />
volatility, there's a lack of tribal commitment in Australian politics now compared with<br />
or 30 years ago.<br />
Nobody in my team is being the least bit smug or complacent as a result of what happened<br />
on Saturday. But we do read a very clear signal when you increase your vote in such a<br />
dramatic way in a by-election in such a seat seven or eight months after a general election<br />
has got to mean something. And what it means to us is a lot more positive than it means<br />
to our political opponents. What it really means to us is that the Australian public wants<br />
us to get on with the main game. They want us to get on with the job that we were<br />
elected to do. They want the Parliament to pass the legislation that we promised the<br />
Australian people before the last election. They want the Parliament to pass our Industrial<br />
Relations legislation for example, something that I have been committed to for 10 or<br />
years and I hope as a result of the very skilful way in which Peter Reith has handled that<br />
legislation it can go through the Parliament in essentially the formn that we want. Now it<br />
can't go through in exactly the form we want because we don't have the numbers. I wish<br />
we did, but the realities of the mathematics of the Australian Parliament are that we will in<br />
the foreseeable future no government of this country if the present voting system of the<br />
Senate remains and I'm not proposing any change let me say, in parenthesis immediately<br />
so that stories don't start spinning out of this luncheon that I am. I wouldn't want that to<br />
happen. I just want to make it clear that we are stuck with that situation and no matter<br />
how large our majority may be in the House of Representatives, no matter how emphatic </p>
<p>may have been the result on Saturday, we have to deal with the reality of needing 39 votes<br />
in the Senate to get legislation through and there are 37 Liberals and Nationals so we<br />
need two more to get our legislation through. That's the reality we have to deal with.<br />
The reality that those on the other side have to deal with is that the Australian people have<br />
spoken I think very loudly. They spoke very loudly last March and those who live in the<br />
seat of Lindsay spoke very loudly last weekend. But it is our responsibility to get on with<br />
that legislation because passing that is about the single most important contribution we can<br />
make to a more competitive and a more internationally robust Australian economy.<br />
Because if you can fix industrial relations in this country so many other things will fall into<br />
place. Industrial relations is the thing that can transform bad industrial relations can<br />
transform an efficient rural producer who is a winner when his product goes out of the<br />
farm gate into a loser when it reaches the end of the production and the distribution and<br />
the sale chain. Bad industrial relations over the years has made it prohibitively expensive<br />
for many people to export from Australia.<br />
Bad industrial relations has meant that people have been focused on a " them and us"<br />
demarcation rather than coming together in a common cause. We've seen around the<br />
states examples of where sensible changes to industrial relations legislation can bring about<br />
a better climate. But there's a limit to what can be done at a State level, we need a<br />
national liberation of Australia's industrial relations system and that is what we're offering.<br />
I mean, a very simple thing such as those ridiculous unfair dismissal laws that Laurie<br />
Brereton didn't tell you about in the 1993 election campaign and yet they were passed into<br />
law. They're still preventing many small businesses in this country taking on more staff<br />
and passage of the industrial relations legislation will sweep Brereton's laws away and<br />
replace them with laws that are fair to both employers and employees because the present<br />
laws are manifestly unfair to employers. They are obsessed with procedural accuracy<br />
rather than the merits of each individual case and as employers many of you, and as<br />
employees, you will know how absolutely ridiculous that really is. Our job is to work on<br />
getting that legislation through and I can assure you that we are. It would have been<br />
passed months ago if we controlled the Senate and I hope that within the next few weeks<br />
when the debate has resumed that we will see solid progress on it.<br />
Getting on with the job also means, of course, achieving our commitment to sell one third<br />
of Telstra thus enabling the establishment of the Natural Heritage Trust of Australia and<br />
cleaning up the Murray-Darling basin which is about the most valuable environmental<br />
project that any group of governments in this country can commit themselves to will be<br />
one of the major beneficiaries of that Natural Heritage Trust. I just have to say again that<br />
it will be upon the heads of those who oppose that legislation in the Senate if this country<br />
is denied the biggest-ever capital investment in cleaning up its environment that we've<br />
seen in modem history. Because establishing that fund will make it possible to do<br />
practical things to improve the environment. What we have in mind is not so much the<br />
stuff on excited environmental demonstrations, rather it is the stuff of looking to the long<br />
term repair of this country's environment. The polluted river systems, the degraded soil,<br />
the high levels of salinity, the ocean outfall all of those things which if they can be </p>
<p>addressed over a period of time will not only repair Australia's environment, will also<br />
strengthen the image this country has around the world, the clean green image, which is so<br />
important to our primary producers and so important to our export success in fresh and<br />
processed foods in the Asian Pacific Region.<br />
Now they are the sort of things that the public want us to get on with. They also want us<br />
to get on with reducing the paperwork burden on small business. We've already done a<br />
number of things in that area. We promised that we'd do something about the provisional<br />
tax uplift factor and that's been done and it will inject $ 160 million extra cash flow into<br />
small business this year. I established a task force chaired by Charlie Bell, the Managing<br />
Director of McDonalds, to tell us how in a period of three years we might reduce the<br />
paperwork burden on small business by 50%. He's going to hand me a report in eight<br />
days, I'll be fascinated to read it and I think the small business community will be<br />
fascinated to know what's in it.<br />
It will be a very, very important document because we really do have to reduce the<br />
regulatory burden on small business. It is not only ridiculously expensive but it's also a<br />
complete waste of time in many cases because many of the forms that are filled out are<br />
filled out by people who recently complied with things that make no practical contribution<br />
to the day to day running of their business and the accuracy of the sort of statistical<br />
information collected under those circumstances ought to be regarded as at least<br />
reasonably imprecise. It's hardly any wonder that it is. I think, sometimes when laws are<br />
designed that might be capable of compliance by large companies that have big human<br />
resource departments and have big accounting and corporate affairs departments, that the<br />
people who devise those laws have no appreciation that the average one or two man or<br />
woman business doesn't really have the time, the resources, the inclination or the desire to<br />
comply to that kind of regulatory system. But we do need a new order in that area and<br />
I'm very optimistic that out of this committee's work some practical suggestions will be<br />
made to reduce that paperwork burden.<br />
Another very important area, of course, and an area of overwhelming importance to any<br />
government is the area of employment. Last night I announced the establishment of a new<br />
Cabinet committee, an employment committee which will subsume the economic<br />
committee of Cabinet I had originally intended to establish. The whole purpose of this<br />
committee, which I will Chair and will include the Deputy Prime Minister and the<br />
Treasurer and the Minister for Industrial Relations and a number of other Ministers the<br />
whole purpose of this committee will be to pull together all of the policy work of the<br />
Government and direct it towards job creation. Economic theory is never an end in itself<br />
You never follow an economic theory out of some blind, ideological commitment. You<br />
don't have micro-economic reform because it's a nice thing to have. You do all of those<br />
things because at the end of the day the responsibility of a government is to follow policies<br />
that increase economic growth and through that generate more jobs for Australians. And<br />
that should always be the test will this policy increase economic growth and thereby<br />
increase jobs for Australians? And if we can ask that question of every economic policy<br />
decision we take, in my view, we will get the right answers. </p>
<p>The question shouldn't be will this achieve a particular benchmark of economic change?<br />
The question has simply got to be will this decision contribute to cause of greater<br />
economic growth and through it an increase in the number of jobs that are generated to us<br />
for Australians? And if we can run that test, that benchmark, across all of our decisions<br />
then I believe we will have a far more sharply focused outcome and far more sharply<br />
focused policy making decision process. Because getting our level of unemployment<br />
down and it won't be easy and I'm not pretending to anybody it is. When we took over<br />
the Australian economy in March there were some parts of it that were going well. Our<br />
rate of inflation was low and in some areas economic growth was reasonable. But there<br />
are a lot of features of the economy that were going very badly and one of them was that<br />
we still had far too high a rate of unemployment particularly amongst the young. Now I<br />
don't pretend that you can turn that around quickly and anybody who understands the<br />
cause and effect in economics will know that the current rate of unemployment is the<br />
product of policy processes that have been in train for a long period of time. It is a lagged<br />
indicator and it's going to take a period of time but at least we are going to focus all of the<br />
policy making mechanisms of the Government in the economic area on that great central<br />
objective of generating jobs.<br />
Our industrial relations system changes will help the employment situation over time.<br />
Proposals we had for change in other areas in reducing the regulatory burden on small<br />
business will help. Proposals we have in mind to improve and reform the waterfront will<br />
also make a significant contribution. I am very mindful of the importance of different<br />
industries to regional areas of the Australian economy. Can I say I think the idea that<br />
Australia would never have a car industry is quite unthinkable I think it's very, very<br />
important that that be said. I don't think to pre-empt the outcome of the Productivity<br />
Commission inquiry. I believe that that inquiry will be far reaching, I think that inquiry<br />
will be balanced and I want to say to you on behalf of the Government that it's not in our<br />
scheme of things that this country will ever lose the car manufacturing capacity of<br />
significance. I think it's very important that that be said.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen the message coming to me loudly and clearly as I go around our<br />
country is that people voted for change, they voted for a new government. They don't<br />
necessarily agree with everything that we've done but they're certainly, at present and I<br />
hope for a period of time well into the future, they feel well rid of the people that we<br />
replaced and they're not really inclined to go back to them for quite a long period of time.<br />
But that can change and we have to keep working hard to keep faith with the high hopes<br />
that we established for the Australian people when we were elected on the second of<br />
March. Part of the process of doing that is keeping in touch with people like those in this<br />
room. The Liberal Party is not owned by any section of the Australian community. It's one of its<br />
great boasts that nobody owns us. We're not owned by big business, we're not owned<br />
by small business, we're not owned by this or that section. One of the things that I've<br />
really campaigned on very hard was to try and end the politics of bending to the noise or<br />
listening to the noise of the rowdiest interest groups in the Australian community and </p>
<p>resuming governing for the mainstream. Although we're not owned by anybody we do, of<br />
course, have a bias towards free enterprise, we have a bias towards investment, we have a<br />
bias towards risk taking, we have a bias towards essentially a freer market economy. We<br />
won't always agree with the business community, you won't always agree with us. One<br />
businessman in this town said to me a few weeks ago he said I had a look at the Budget,<br />
he said, I didn't like this, I didn't like that, he listed about four things he didn't like in it,<br />
but he said, I've written you a letter congratulating you because it was the right Budget<br />
for Australia.<br />
I thought that was a pretty fair and a pretty responsible attitude to take. But I can tell you<br />
that we value our links with the business community very highly and all of my colleagues,<br />
particularly those who have links into economic portfolios, know that one of the important<br />
ingredients of staying in touch and one of the important ingredients of continuing to have<br />
the confidence of the Australian community is to listen to the business community. Not<br />
just the business community of Sydney and Melbourne, but the business community of all<br />
of the capital cities of Australia. And luncheons and gatherings such as this are a very,<br />
very important element of that.<br />
So I want to thank you because I know that over the years many of you have given<br />
tremendous support to the Liberal Party here in South Australia. You've given great<br />
support to Dean Brown who's doing a terrific job for his State and you've given<br />
tremendous support to us federally. No State did better for the Liberal Party than South<br />
Australia in the last Federal election. I'm very conscious of that and I'm very grateful for<br />
it. And it's a very, very pleasing thing for me to look around our side of the Chamber in<br />
the House of Representatives and to see so many of those faces and we want to keep it<br />
that way, but it won't get easier. I suppose over a period of time it inevitably is going to<br />
get harder. But we did see a huge change in Australian political opinion on the second of<br />
March. I understood that, my colleagues understood that, I'm sure you understood that.<br />
I think some of our opponents still some how or other believe it was an abhorrent mistake.<br />
Changes after 13 years are not abhorrent mistakes, they are deliberate, decisive decisions<br />
to change the direction of a country and it's our job and our responsibility and with your<br />
help we will achieve precisely that change of direction. Thank you.<br />
