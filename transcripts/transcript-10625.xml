<p>  MILNE:</p>
<p>  Prime Minister, welcome. Mr Howard, how does it feel to be sending</p>
<p>   young Australians to war?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  A very difficult decision. I am conscious of the enormous responsibility</p>
<p>   but I have got a responsibility to the longer term security of this</p>
<p>   country and we owe it to that security to make a contribution to</p>
<p>   deny to Saddam Hussein the capacity to deliver weapons of mass destruction</p>
<p>   against neighbouring countries in the Middle East and also to say</p>
<p>   to other countries that might want to do the same thing, that you</p>
<p>   won't be able to do it. And unless we do that the world in</p>
<p>   the 21st Century is going to be a far unsafer place, not only for</p>
<p>   the people of the Middle East, but also for the people of Australia.</p>
<p>   So that is why we have taken the decision, but in doing so, I am</p>
<p>   desperately conscious that the ultimate burden and the ultimate</p>
<p>   responsibility is carried by those young men who will go overseas</p>
<p>   as part of that force.</p>
<p>  MILNE:</p>
<p>  Well there will be many mothers and fathers of servicemen out there</p>
<p>   tonight who will be worried. As a father, how would you feel if</p>
<p>   it was your son that had to go?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  I would feel all of the pain and the anguish. I would understand</p>
<p>   all of the anxiety and I identify with them but you have a responsibility,</p>
<p>   in my position, to address an issue like this and to take the right</p>
<p>   decision. And the people we contemplate sending are highly trained,</p>
<p>   the most superbly, professionally trained and ready part of our</p>
<p>   fighting force and whose whole training right up to now has been</p>
<p>   towards, perhaps, this kind of activity. And, in that sense, their</p>
<p>   exposure is less than poorly trained people.</p>
<p>  MILNE:</p>
<p>  You spoke to President Clinton this afternoon, what did he say to</p>
<p>   you?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well he expressed his great gratitude to Australia. He expressed</p>
<p>   the hope that this issue could still be settled by peaceful means.</p>
<p>   We both hold that, we both claim that it is still possible for Saddam</p>
<p>   to be persuaded into backing down so that we are spared the necessity</p>
<p>   of a military strike.</p>
<p>  MILNE:</p>
<p>  This international alliance has far fewer countries than in the</p>
<p>   Gulf War in 1991. Are we sticking our neck out?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  No we are not and it is to early to belittle the number of countries.</p>
<p>   The number participating will grow, I'm sure of that. You have</p>
<p>   got to bear in mind that in 1991 there was a much longer lead time.</p>
<p>   So there was greater opportunities.</p>
<p>  MILNE:</p>
<p>  Canada is now on board?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well, it is a matter for Canada to decide but I am hopeful Canada</p>
<p>   will be on board.</p>
<p>  MILNE:</p>
<p>  Who will command our men over there?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  They'll have a national commander, national officer in charge</p>
<p>   and Australia will be in direct charge of our forces base. They</p>
<p>   will be part of the overall theatre command of the Americans. That</p>
<p>   is always the case in something like this but they will operate</p>
<p>   under Australian rules of engagement and it will be part of the</p>
<p>   understanding that those rules of engagement must be respected and</p>
<p>   observed at all times by the American theatre commander.</p>
<p>  MILNE:</p>
<p>  And we'll have ultimate control over those rules of engagement?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well we determine the rules of engagement. When Australian forces</p>
<p>   go abroad there are rules of engagement agreed to by the Government.</p>
<p>  MILNE:</p>
<p>  The SAS, their real expertise is fighting behind enemy lines, will</p>
<p>   they be on the ground in Iraq?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well the purpose of deploying them is, if that's what ultimately</p>
<p>   happens and it's the sort of option that we are discussing</p>
<p>   at the present time, is for search and rescue purposes.</p>
<p>  MILNE:</p>
<p>  On the ground in Iraq?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well search and rescue purposes can mean a number of things. I don't</p>
<p>   want to start speculating as to precisely what they all mean but</p>
<p>   they are highly trained personnel. They have a great reputation.</p>
<p>   And the purpose is for search and rescue.</p>
<p>  MILNE:</p>
<p>  Prime Minister, thank you.</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Thank you.</p>
<p>  [Ends]</p>
