EMBARGOED AGAINST DELIVERY: 5 October 1977-<br />
EXPECTED ABOUT 8. 00 p~~ tm. A DRJ I3' JR<br />
Statement by the Prime Iviinister<br />
I am pleased to be able -to inform the House that the<br />
Government has decided to establish a National Royal Comnmission<br />
into Drugs. The Royal Commission will be constituted by<br />
Mr Justice E. S. Williams of the Queensland Supreme Court and<br />
will commence its hearings as soon as possible.<br />
Since the Commonwealth first announced the proposal<br />
to establish a National Drug Inquiry,, there have been a series<br />
of meetings between the Commonwealth and the States at officer<br />
and ministerial level to settle the terms of reference and mode<br />
of operation o f the Inquiry and to discuss co-operation and<br />
co-ordination with the two existing Drug Inquiries in New South<br />
Wales and South Australia.<br />
Victoria, Tasmania, Western Australia and Queensland<br />
have agreed to the establishment of a National Royal Commission<br />
and to the terms of reference of' such a Commission. . These<br />
States have also indicated their willingness to give any legal<br />
support necessary for the establishment and operation of the<br />
National Royal Commission. Negotiations are still proceeding<br />
with New South Wales and South Australia. The procedure will<br />
be that the Commonwealth will establish a Commonwealth Royal<br />
Commission and those States agreeing to support the National<br />
Royal Commission will take steps to appoint the Commonwealth<br />
Royal Commissioner to head identical inquiries under State<br />
legislation. </p>
<p>The Government believres -this -to be a most important<br />
step as it is clear from all accounts that the drug problem<br />
extends right across Australia and is not confined to any one<br />
particular State. Because of this, the Government believes<br />
that a National Royal Commission is needed to investigate the'<br />
total position." After the National Royal Commission has been<br />
established I feel sure that a workable relationship will be<br />
arrived at with the New South Wales and South Australian Royal<br />
Commissions. The Government has beeh very conscious of the need to<br />
minimise as much as possible any overlapping or duplication<br />
between the roles of the various Commissions. To this end the<br />
terms of reference of the National Royal Commission have been<br />
adjusted to minimise any such overlapping particularly with<br />
. the South Australian Inquiry.<br />
I now table the proposed terms of reference which Ibelieve<br />
represent a satisfactory and comprehensive basis for a<br />
national inquiry. </p>
