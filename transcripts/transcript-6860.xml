PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 6 March 1986<br />
The Prime Minister of the Republic of Singapore, Mr Lee Kuan Yew,<br />
GCMG, CHi, will visit Australia from 11-20 April at the invitation<br />
of the Australian Government.<br />
Mr Lee will be accompanied by Mrs Lee and senior Government<br />
officials. Australia has important and close links with Singapore. We are<br />
regional neighbours, fellow members of the Commonwealth, partners<br />
under the Five Power Defence Arrangement and have an important<br />
bilateral relationship. Australia and Singapore share<br />
fundamental interests in the stability, security and prosperity<br />
of the Asia-Pacific region.<br />
Prime Minister Lee has visited Australia on several occasions.<br />
He welcomed me most warmly on my visit to Singapore in February<br />
1984. 1 particularly look forward to reciprocating this welcome<br />
in Australia and to continuing our dialogue on major world and<br />
regional issues.<br />
on the economic side, I expect our discussions to cover the state<br />
of and prospects for the world economy and the economy of our<br />
region, as well as the bilateral relationship between Australia<br />
and Singapore. On the political side, I expect to exchange views<br />
on topics of major world concern, including East-West relations,<br />
and the current situation in the Asia-Pacific region.<br />
As well as Canberra, Mr Lee will visit South Australia, Western<br />
Australia and Queensland. </p>
