<p>The Prime Minister and Agriculture Minister today announced $2.5 million in funding for the next Beef Australia expo in Rockhampton to showcase Australia’s cattle industry, to support jobs and to secure new markets.</p>
<p>The expo is the largest and most significant cattle industry event in the country and will benefit many of the 184,000 Australians employed in agriculture and meat processing by promoting our cattle and industry technology on the international stage.</p>
<p>The Rudd Government is committed to securing jobs in the cattle industry and recently announced a $60 million funding package to build the meat supply chain and improve long-term trade and investment opportunities between Australia and Indonesia.</p>
<p>Australia is the world’s second largest exporter of beef and showcasing our first-class industry to international markets will help promote trade and ensure jobs into the future.</p>
<p>Beef Australia 2012 attracted 85,000 people including delegates from more than 35 countries.</p>
<p>With the value of production of Australia’s cattle industry estimated to be worth $7.4 billion in 2012-13 and beef and live cattle exports estimated to be worth $5.2 billion in 2012–13, events like Beef Australia are integral for the future of our economy.</p>
<p>Beef Australia 2015 will be held in Rockhampton, Queensland from 4–9 May 2015. </p>
