    <content><![CDATA[<p>E&amp;OE...................</p>
<p>Thank you very much Mr Arthur Toon, to Mrs Georgina Hammersley, Mr</p>
<p> John Wyndham, to Rhonda Parker, Brian Watters, the Chairman of the</p>
<p> Prime Minister's Taskforce on Drugs, other distinguished guests, ladies</p>
<p> and gentlemen.</p>
<p>I feel it a particular honour to be here this morning to really do</p>
<p> two things. To rename this complex the Rick Hammersley Centre and</p>
<p> also to launch the Saranna Women's Project and the Indigenous Peoples</p>
<p> Programme which have been granted $528,000 in funding under the Government's</p>
<p> Tough on Drugs programme and both of which are based here.</p>
<p>It is true, as Arthur Toon said in his words of introduction, that</p>
<p> public responses at both the Government and a community level to the</p>
<p> problem of illicit drugs has changed enormously over the last 20 years.</p>
<p> It's one of those issues that unless you had a great deal of patience</p>
<p> and application would drive the public policy maker completely mad</p>
<p> because so much of the media and other focus is on the high profile</p>
<p> differences of emphasis rather than on those areas where most people</p>
<p> who have a conscientious commitment to trying to reduce the damage</p>
<p> done by illicit drugs and to prevent young people starting to use</p>
<p> those drugs in the first place that the points of agreement far outweigh</p>
<p> the points of disagreement.</p>
<p>Over the last two years it is true that the Federal Government and</p>
<p> I in particular have taken a very special interest. We have done so</p>
<p> because we understand it's a huge community problem. That it does</p>
<p> cause immense pain and suffering and visit tragedy on many Australian</p>
<p> families. What we are trying to do is to tackle it at three levels.</p>
<p> We are trying first and foremost to recognise that prevention is always</p>
<p> better than cure. That if you can persuade young people of the ill-wisdom</p>
<p> and the danger of starting drug taking in the first place then you</p>
<p> can prevent a great deal of tragedy.</p>
<p>And I am frequently moved to say that it always surprises me a little</p>
<p> bit when living in an age where tobacco smoking has grown from being</p>
<p> something that was socially acceptable, when I was 21 or 25 and you</p>
<p> all know just about what age I turned last weekend, that it's gone</p>
<p> from being socially acceptable to being something that is socially</p>
<p> unacceptable. And that cigarette smokers have now become, and I abandoned</p>
<p> the terrible habit 20 years ago myself, have become almost social</p>
<p> outcasts yet some of the people who are the most zealous advocates</p>
<p> of a no smoking policy find themselves in disagreement with some of</p>
<p> us who adopt very, very strong attitudes towards anything other than</p>
<p> a completely intolerant approach to the use of illicit drugs.</p>
<p>So the first responsibility is to educate young people about the dangers</p>
<p> of starting. The second area of responsibility, not necessarily less</p>
<p> important, is to make certain that the law enforcement authorities</p>
<p> of Australia have enough resources at their disposal to tackle people</p>
<p> who peddle death and human misery and peddle drugs.</p>
<p>And the third area of responsibility, and this is where this wonderful</p>
<p> establishment Cyrenian House comes into play, the third area of responsibility</p>
<p> is to provide help and assistance for people who want to stop using</p>
<p> illicit drugs and want to rehabilitate themselves and to restore their</p>
<p> health and to rebuild their lives.</p>
<p>[Inaudible] of all of the areas the third one over the years has probably</p>
<p> been more neglected than the other two because there was always, I</p>
<p> guess, a strong body of opinion in the community that you shouldn't</p>
<p> start using illicit drugs. And there was always a community detestation</p>
<p> of the criminals who are involved in peddling drugs to people in our</p>
<p> community. But over the years the facilities for rehabilitation have</p>
<p> not been adequate and it is one of the areas where more resources</p>
<p> have been needed for a long time. And it's been an emphasis of our</p>
<p> programme. And over the last two years the Federal Government has</p>
<p> committed about $500 million to its Tough on Drugs strategy. And we</p>
<p> have given extra support in those three areas.</p>
<p>Unlike what some of our critics say, we haven't put all of the money</p>
<p> into law enforcement although we have put a lot more into law enforcement.</p>
<p> We have also put a lot of resources in education and I am particularly</p>
<p> pleased to say that we have put a lot of resources into rehabilitation.</p>
<p> Recently at a meeting I had with the Premiers and Chief Ministers</p>
<p> of the States and Territories we decided on a programme of what we</p>
<p> call adopting a diversion strategy whereby within effect giving to</p>
<p> people who are having their first contact with the criminal justice</p>
<p> system as a result of illicit drug use. We are giving them the option</p>
<p> of undergoing treatment rather than being caught up in the criminal</p>
<p> justice system. It's their choice as to whether they get caught up</p>
<p> or not but they do have the option and the option is, I think, in</p>
<p> most cases one that's going to appeal to them and appeal to the community.</p>
<p> And we are getting a lot of cooperation from the State governments</p>
<p> and the consultations that are taking place between the Federal Government</p>
<p> which is going to provide a lot more money to fund rehabilitation</p>
<p> programmes. And the State authorities which, of course, are responsible</p>
<p> for the criminal justice system, the cooperation so far has been terrific.</p>
<p>And that's the background from which we come and that is why I have</p>
<p> a special interest in being here today because today we are honouring</p>
<p> the contribution of the late Rick Hammersley to this centre. And his</p>
<p> contribution, of course, was related to the tragic loss of a child</p>
<p> more than 20 years ago and he from that time on he devoted his time</p>
<p> and his energy and his great skill and his great sense of community</p>
<p> responsibility to providing an assistance mechanism, a support mechanism.</p>
<p> His own experience had been that he had to go to Sydney to obtain</p>
<p> treatment for his child and he recognised the paucity of resources</p>
<p> and facilities here in Western Australia that he quite correctly resolved</p>
<p> to try and do something about it. And his story and the story of this</p>
<p> centre is a magnificent reminder of the value of what I describe as</p>
<p> the social coalition in our community. And that is where you get people</p>
<p> working together, each with their own expertise, providing an input</p>
<p> to achieve a community goal. In building this centre he got a great</p>
<p> deal of support from various organisations. He got support from Rotary,</p>
<p> he got support, I understand, from the Lotteries Commission, he got</p>
<p> support from different sporting organisations, from various community</p>
<p> organisations, he got support from individuals who were concerned</p>
<p> and, of course, he got, and this centre has received very generous</p>
<p> support from the Western Australian Government I think in the order</p>
<p> of at least $500,000 or $600,000 a year to keep this centre going.</p>
<p>So it is a great example of how somebody turned and converted an immense</p>
<p> personal tragedy of his own and his family's to a noble community</p>
<p> purpose. He saw a need in the community and he set about doing something</p>
<p> about it. And as a result you have a centre here which I am delighted</p>
<p> to have the privilege of re-naming the Rick Hammersley Centre today,</p>
<p> which has provided a source of hope and encouragement to a large number</p>
<p> of people who are dealing with a drug problem. Its facilities, which</p>
<p> I'm going to have an opportunity of having a look at after this opening</p>
<p> ceremony has completed, are very high quality facilities. And they</p>
<p> do provide residential facilities for something in the order of 200</p>
<p> people and that is a very large number by any measure. And this is</p>
<p> exactly the sort of facility that we should be encouraging. It provides</p>
<p> people with some hope for the future. It recognises that different</p>
<p> personalities grapple with a personal and emotional challenge and</p>
<p> a physical addiction in different ways. Some find it harder than others.</p>
<p> Some find it easier than others. Some people need different measures</p>
<p> of support and different levels of assistance than others. And the</p>
<p> challenge for all of us, without in any way weakening our resolve</p>
<p> to educate the young from the very early years against the evil of</p>
<p> drug taking, we do have a particular responsibility to provide help</p>
<p> for those who want to get off it.</p>
<p>And I've taken part in a lot of media interviews on this issue, particularly</p>
<p> over the last year where it's been something very much in the public</p>
<p> eye and in the news. But I don't think I've had more unsettling, distressing</p>
<p> phone calls than I've had from people in different parts of Australia</p>
<p> who ring in to talkback radio stations and say, I have a daughter</p>
<p> who's got a drug problem and she wants to do something about it and</p>
<p> I've got to wait two or three weeks before I can get some kind of</p>
<p> treatment for her. The reality is, and I'm not a doctor, I'm not a</p>
<p> clinical psychologist, I'm just another human being trying to understand</p>
<p> the sense of despair and distress that people have. I would imagine</p>
<p> that if you have a drug addiction and you've finally resolved in your</p>
<p> own mind and heart that you want to do something about it, it's pretty</p>
<p> important that you get help straight away and that you're not told</p>
<p> that there isn't any treatment facility available for two or three</p>
<p> weeks. Now, that's a gap that has to be filled. It's a need that has</p>
<p> to be met. And Cyrenian House, soon to be re-named the Rick Hammersley</p>
<p> Centre, is providing that kind of assistance. And it's the responsibility</p>
<p> of governments at all levels on both sides of politics without the</p>
<p> encumbrance and burden of political point scoring to do something</p>
<p> about this immense social problem.</p>
<p>We do have a capacity in Australia to find an Australian solution</p>
<p> to the particular dimension of a problem in our society. We are not</p>
<p> like any other country, although we have similar experiences, each</p>
<p> country has its own particular experience and it has its own particular</p>
<p> responses and its own particular challenges.</p>
<p>So can I say to all of you that I'm especially privileged to be here</p>
<p> today. I know that Mrs Georgina Hammersley, Rick's widow, and a number</p>
<p> of members of their family are also present. I do want, on behalf</p>
<p> of the Federal Government and, I believe, on behalf of the entire</p>
<p> community, to pay tribute to the work that he did, to thank him for</p>
<p> what he did for this community, to thank him for the humanitarian</p>
<p> gesture involved in 20 years of work to tackle a dreadful scourge</p>
<p> within our community. Our society is the better for what he contributed</p>
<p> and it is a nobler and better place as a result of the contribution</p>
<p> that he made. And for that reason, in particular, I am delighted -</p>
<p> if I can be directed towards what I have to pull - I am delighted</p>
<p> to re-name this facility, I re-name it the Rick Hammersley Centre.</p>
