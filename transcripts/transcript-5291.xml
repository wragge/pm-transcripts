PRIME MINISTER WEDNESDAY 12 MARCH 1980<br />
From the Press Office SUMMARY OF 12.30 NEWS<br />
The NSW petrol dispute has spread to Victoria where service stations<br />
are to close this afternoon and reopen with rationing tomorrow.<br />
The action follows a vote by tanker drivers in Melbourne this<br />
morning to go on strike for 48 hours in support of their colleagues<br />
in NSW. The men decided that aircraft refuellers in Melbourne<br />
would stay on the job. I~ n Canberra talks aimed at ending the<br />
dispute have been continuing but there's been no word of any<br />
progress. There was another brief session before Sir John Moore<br />
before the parties broke for private talks. Duncan Fairweather<br />
reports on this morning's developments. As happened last night<br />
the special conference before Sir John Moore lasted barely half an<br />
hour. Sir John had to sit on another case. oil company and union<br />
representatives then shifted to a conference room in the Canberra<br />
Workers Club where they spent the morning trying to thrash out a<br />
solution.' Again both sides are refusing to comment on what<br />
proposals are before them. The parties are expected to report back<br />
to Sir John Moore after 1 pm but delegates to the conference expect<br />
that negotiations may continue on into the afternoon.<br />
In South Australia the State Government has introduced a motor fuel<br />
rationing bill at a special parliamentary sitting today. The bill<br />
provides fines of up to $ 10,000 for people failing to comply with<br />
regulations for the supply or distribution of rationed motor fuel.<br />
Gaol fines are also provided for profiteering in rationed fuel.<br />
Mr. Tonkin said the bill had been introduced because there was a<br />
possibility of motor fuel being disrupted by an industrial dispute.<br />
It could be late this afternoon before any decision is made on<br />
extending the NSW petrol dispute in Queensland. A spokesman for the<br />
State Branch of the TWU said the union was waiting to hear the<br />
results of the conference iti Canberra.<br />
The National Farmers Federation says it is prepared to operate<br />
outside the law if necessary to honour Australia's wool export<br />
commitments. At the same time the Federation has condemned the<br />
Federal Government for what it calls its spineless and timid<br />
attitude to the wave of industrial disputes sweeping Australia.<br />
Mr. Eckersley said the Labor Opposition was just as weak and its<br />
excuses for trade union actions, conducted under the guise of<br />
unsatisfactory industrial legislation were despicable. He said<br />
wool g rowers did not want physical confrontation with union but they<br />
would not stand by and see their industry destroyed. He said every<br />
effort would be made to operate within the law but if the Government<br />
could not give the necessary backing then consideration would have<br />
to be given to operating outside the law something which was<br />
constantly being done by the trade unions.<br />
The head of a leading Italian fashion house says world demand for<br />
Australian wool will decline if supplies are disrupted by<br />
industrial action such as the present Storemen and Packers dispute.<br />
The Italian manufacturer said Australia was in danger of losing<br />
some of its overseas markets because of the continuing shortages<br />
of supply.<br />
In the Queensland Mr. Tom Burns has announced he'll accept the<br />
position of President of the Interim Administrative Committee<br />
being set up by the National Executive of the Labor Party. Mr.<br />
Burns has indicated that the State Opposition leader Mr. Casey </p>
<p>will also accept a position on the committee. Mr. Burns said.<br />
today his decision had been made after discussions with Queensland<br />
Caucus members. He had earlier refused the job. Mr. Burns said<br />
everyone had to accept that federal intervention had happened.<br />
Papua New Guinea's interim cabinet is having its first meeting in<br />
Port Moresby today. The full cabinet of 20 or so ministers will<br />
be sworn in tomorrow. Sean Dorney reports from Port Moresby.<br />
Mr. Peacock said today he did not expect the change of government<br />
in Port Moresby to affect Australia. Mr. Peacock said Mr. Somare<br />
and Sir Julius Chan had similar views on the special relationship<br />
between Australia and Papua New Guinea. ABC reporter Kevin Balkan<br />
asked Mr. Peacock if he expected to see any significant change in<br />
Papua New Guinea's foreign relations and the administration of<br />
Sir Julius Chan.<br />
Mr. Peacock<br />
I know because I've heard already that he believes the relationship<br />
with Australia is so important there will be no change in the<br />
immediate sense at all and tliat's what I would expect.<br />
Question<br />
Where do you think these changes will take place?<br />
Mr. Peacock<br />
Well now that will be for Sir Julius to determine. It's not for<br />
us to impose our views on him early in the peace. Papua New<br />
Guinea is independent in the real sense of the word and Sir Julius<br />
Chan will be giving leadership as he sees it.<br />
Mr. Peacock said he did not think the change of government would<br />
effect Australian investment in Papua New Guinea.<br />
The deposed Shah of Iran is said to be seriously ill again. A New<br />
York physician who examined him in Panama last week said he was<br />
suffering from an inflamed spleen and required what he described as<br />
a hazardous operation to have it removed. He was also suffering<br />
from anaemia and other blood problems. A statement released by<br />
the Shah's spokesman in New York said arrangements were being made<br />
for the operation but he declined to say where it would take place.<br />
American newspapers have reported that the Carter administration<br />
officials have been informed of the Shah's condition but would not<br />
permit him to come back to the US for the operation.<br />
Following the withdrdfal of t-he UN Commission from Iran, Mr. Vance<br />
is to meet Mr. Waldheim in New York to discuss what should be done<br />
next to try to free the hostages. Geoff McMullen reports from<br />
Washington. The people of Queensland have been assured that gold mining in the<br />
streets can be prevented. The Minister for Nines has power under<br />
the Mining Act to ban projects in the public interests.<br />
Reports of an attempted coup in Pakistan last week have been denied<br />
by the Government of President Zia. 000---</p>
