<p>E&amp;OE…………………………………………………………………………………</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, what do you make of the latest developments in Fiji?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>They’re very significant developments.  I’m very pleased indeed, and the Australian government welcomes the assertion of the rule of law again in Fiji.  We have been greatly concerned that the rule of law appears to have been put aside in recent weeks, and anything that involves the re-assertion of the rule of law, the application of the ordinary criminal law of the country is something that we very warmly welcome.  I also welcome the fact that an interim budget has been brought down by the caretaker Prime Minister.  Fiji’s economy has been very severely damaged by what’s happened over the past couple of months and early action to get the Fijian economy back on course is very welcome.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Are you nevertheless discouraged that there appears that democratic elections may not happen in Fiji for another three years Prime Minister?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>We are always discouraged when democracy is put aside, and it’s too early to make any long term judgement.  Far too early about whether what is now happening represents any fundamental change of attitude but at least you are seeing people brought to account for criminal behaviour, at least you are seeing the assertion of the importance of the rule of law, and a determination apparently by the President, the Acting Prime Minister and the military to impose the rule of law on George Speight and others of his supporters.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>The Acting Prime Minister has accused Australia and New Zealand of adopting an aggressive and a threatening stance towards Fiji.  What’s your response to that?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER: </p>
<p>I haven’t heard that but if that remark has been made it’s wrong</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Has Australia been asked to be involved or help in any way?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Australia had no knowledge of the action that has occurred in the last 24 hours.  We have not been asked to be involved and I would not expect us to be asked to be involved.  Ultimately it is a matter for the people of Fiji to resolve, and we encourage the people of Fiji to return to democratic government, we encourage the restoration of the elected Prime Minister Mr Chaudrey.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>What’s it mean for our diplomatic relations?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>There’s no change.  We brought our High Commissioner back for consultations as part of the measures that were introduced, and that was the right thing to do.  But it is a very significant development and one that the government welcomes because it is a step back along the road towards a more constitutional form of government because it invokes and asserts the rule of law and that’s fundamental to a democracy.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>The interim Prime Minster’s also asked for a bit of breathing space from Australia.  What are the possibilities of lifting sanctions in the immediate future?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well the measures we have imposed are not damaging economic sanctions.  We have said that there could be further action taken if there is not a return to democratic rule.  I think it’s a question of the people of Fiji assessing the implications of the application of those measures.  The measures we’ve taken to date are appropriate in the circumstances.  They won’t severely damage the Fijian economy but they will send a very strong message that we can’t countenance putting aside democratically elected governments.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>The New Zealand Foreign Minister Phillip Goff has said that civil war could be a possibility in  Fiji.  Do you share his view?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Look, on an occasion like this you make measured comments.  Thank you.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, if I can just ask you about mandatory sentencing.  The agreement reached today, should that ease the international pressure on the issue?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I don’t think you’ll ever ease the activity on the international stage no matter what you do.  I fully expect there to be further international activity in relation to this issue.  But my view is a very simple one – that these matters are for Australia to resolve in Australia according to the laws of Australia and that’s how we handle these things.  We don’t need advice from other people about human rights.  The human rights record of this country is second to none.  We have been great defenders of human rights and it doesn’t serve the interests of Australia for these matters to be dealt with other than by Australians.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Does it represent the best possible outcome do you think?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well the agreement announced today fulfills the in principle agreement reached between the Northern Territory Chief Minister and myself, and it does therefore represents the best possible outcome consistent with our belief that these sorts of matters are best dealt with by local parliaments, be they the Western Australian Parliament or the Northern Territory Parliament.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Very quickly on another issue on the home front.  Meg Lees today has put out five policy suggestions for the ALP for their national conference on a range of issues from education to health and so on saying they’ll make these recommendations, they’ll support them in the Senate.  Are you aware of that and…..?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I’m not aware of it but I am aware of the fact that Saturday and…..well the conference of the ALP will be a marvelous opportunity for the first time in four-and-a-half years for Mr Beazley to tell the Australian people what he stands for.  He’s now been Opposition Leader for longer than Paul Keating was Prime Minister and it’s about time he told the Australian people what he stood for.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Are you concerned about a possible alliance there between the Democrats and the ALP, potential for an alliance?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No.</p>
