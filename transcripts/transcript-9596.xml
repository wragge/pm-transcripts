PRIME MINISTER<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIE MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MIP<br />
HOWARD'S POLICY VACUUM<br />
Mr Howard's declaration after the Liberal Party's federal executive meeting on Friday that<br />
he would not release any policies before the next election campaign was a declaration of<br />
contempt for the Australian electorate.<br />
He will not tell Australians what he thinks or intends to do,. or what if anything he stands<br />
for. He tries to deny them by arguing that he will not respond to my agenda a lame<br />
excuse for having no agenda himself.<br />
This is the same tactic adopted by his most immediate predecessor, Mr Downer. It did not<br />
wash for Mr Downer, and it won'&amp; w ash for Mr Howard.<br />
The Australian people may now conclude that Mr Howard has no policies. Alternatively,<br />
they may suspect that Mr Howard is attempting to invoke a policy " fifth amendment" he<br />
will not say what he will do on the grounds that it might incriminate him. His recent GST<br />
slip made this clear.<br />
His call over the weekend for an inquiry into the Hindmarsh Island bridge controversy<br />
firther illustrates his cynicism. This is nothing more than a transparent attempt to<br />
rehabilitate Ian McLachlan, when the unalterable truth is that McLachlan had to resign<br />
because he misled the Australian people and the Parliament. Whether the confidential<br />
parcel contained sacred documents, or somebody's gas bill the fact remains it was not his<br />
property, and he should not have tampered with it and tried to misuse it in Parliament. In<br />
the circumstances, John Howard's call for an inquiry is merely the latest refuge of a policy<br />
flake. In the meantime, the Coalition last week made more explicit how the it intends to<br />
camouflage its giant policy hole. Apparently, they think it is clever to campaign<br />
principally on a " get rid of Keating" platform. </p>
<p>What they are trying to do is assume legitimacy for a campaign of personality politics with<br />
no policy content at all. In other words, to the incessant talking down of the economy, the<br />
Coalition will add the abandonment of policy.<br />
The Liberal Party believes that from now until the next election they can survive on a hate<br />
campaign. This means that after 12 years in Opposition, they are not only bereft of<br />
policies for Australia, they have learned nothing about the political values of Australians.<br />
