PRIME MINISTER 114/ 92<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER THE HON PJ. ] KEATING MP,<br />
GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO HIGH COURT DECISION ON NATIVE Trl'L&amp;;<br />
I am pleased to announce the first step in the Commonwealth Government response to the<br />
High Court's decision on native title, known as the Mabo decision.<br />
The Government has today initiated consultations with State and Territory governments,<br />
key Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander organisations and the mining and pastoral<br />
industres on teificTifons of the High Court's decision. The consultations will be<br />
directed by a committee of Ministers, chaired by me, and will be led at officials level by a<br />
senior officer in my Department.<br />
The first round of consultations will be completed before the end of the y= a. A progress<br />
report will be considered by the Government before March, 1993 and a final report by<br />
September, 1993. The Government will also encourage negotiation between partics as a<br />
way of resolving differences. Where it seems the Government could usefully facilitate<br />
such negotiation, it will do so.<br />
The High Court's historic decision is a threshold and positive one for the nation. By<br />
rejecting the doctrine of terra nullius, the Court has providcd a new basis for relations<br />
between indigenous and other Australians and given impetus to the process of<br />
reconciliation. It providcs both an opportunity and a challenge.<br />
The nation now has thc opportunity to address the fundamental issue of the place of<br />
Aboriginal traditional land ownershp and indeed the place of Aboriginal and Torres Strait<br />
Islander peoples in contemporary Australia. There is also the challenge to get it right, for<br />
the benefit of all Australians, including the generations of the future.<br />
It is important to rccognige that existing legal rights in relation to property continue, and it<br />
is wrong to see the High Court's decision In terms of existing land holders losing their<br />
land. However, the decision introduces a new element into Australian land tenure, in the<br />
form of native title, and thereby creates a need for clarity in the definition and application<br />
of native title rights, especially in relation to other interests in land. </p>
<p>The Court's judgement is complex, and its implications are equally complex. We need to<br />
consider the implications carefully, but as quickly as possible. Before deciding on the<br />
right long term approach it is essential that we first consult all the governments. of<br />
Australia, key Aboriginal and Torrcs Strait Islander representatives, especially through the<br />
Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission, and industry groups, in order to discuss<br />
possible policy responses. This is the most sensible and constructive national approach.<br />
The Commonwealth Government seeks a balance which protects Aboriginal and Torres<br />
Strait Islander rights and gives benefits to all Australians. Both indigenous groups and the<br />
pastoral and resource sectors are seeking clarity, certainty and a constructive resolution.<br />
Consultation is the first step in that process.<br />
