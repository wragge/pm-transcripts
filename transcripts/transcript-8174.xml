    <content><![CDATA[<p>TRANSCRIPT OF NEWS CONFERENCE, PARLIAMENT HOUSE<br />29 OCTOBER 1990<br />E OE PROOF ONLY<br />JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, do you think it's appropriate if<br />States raise their taxes and the Commonwealth reduces<br />their taxes accordingly?<br />PM: Well we want to get a situation where there's not<br />going to be an overall net increase in the impost on the<br />citizens of this country. The important thing is, as far<br />as the conference is concerned, that we recognise that<br />from the States' point of view that this is a centrally<br />important issue. There is a significant fiscal imbalance<br />and we're quite prepared to examine that and we seem to<br />have the principles of such an investigation agreed.<br />That is, on our part, a recognition of their concern<br />about this imbalance. On their part a recognition of the<br />fact that the national Government has to have<br />responsibility for the macro-economic health of the<br />country. Now what we will do I hope, and I don't want to<br />pre-empt the discussion that will start tonight in<br />Brisbane and go on tomorrow, but I think we'll get the<br />agreement on the principles as to which this matter<br />should now be investigated. I would like to make the<br />point which I think nearly all of you in your<br />commentaries have been fair enough to note, that this is<br />not a conference which itself is going to make all the<br />decisions. I mean the historic importance of this<br />conference is the recognition on the part of the States<br />and the Commonwealth that the time has come to try and<br />get a more efficient and co-operative system of<br />government in this country. We've identified with a very<br />considerable degree of agreement what the agenda should<br />be, what the areas are that we need to look at.<br />Essentially what will come out of today is the beginning<br />of a concentrated work process which will go on into at<br />least I think two more special Premiers' conferences next<br />year. But the areas of agreement are the one that you<br />mentioned in your question, that is the financial<br />relationships, then we've got the area of duplication of<br />services, micro-economic reform. Those three broad<br />areas, including within micro-economic reform the<br />question of looking at trying to eliminate the<br />duplication of regulations that exist in this country and<br />then the two more specific issues of the environment and<br />industrial relations. Now there'll be some areas where</p>
<p>we'll be ablE! to have some immediate decisions. But they<br />will be important in themselves. But the most important<br />thing will be-the agreement as to processes and<br />priorities that will now be pursued through.<br />JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, what mechanisms do you<br />envisage for ensuring that national control of the macroeconomic<br />agenda is maintained if the States are to get<br />back some taxing powers?<br />PM: Well tha~ t's not something that we'll have an answer<br />to today. I mean I believe that what we will get is an<br />agreement to have a detailed co-operative inquiry into<br />what's a very complex issue. There will be an acceptance<br />on the part cof the States of our concern about the need<br />for effective macro-economic control. There'll be an<br />acceptance on our part of the need to try and find ways<br />in which we can give them more access to revenue of their<br />own. Now you just have to state the issues to see that<br />they are complex. But we'll go into this, as I believe<br />the States will, with good intent and good will. I am<br />hopeful then that out of that process next year will come<br />some answers that will meet the requirements of both the<br />States and the Commonwealth.<br />JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, does it concern you that, on<br />a wider economic issue, that consumer confidence is now<br />at its lowest ebb for some years, lower in fact than<br />during the ' 182 recession?<br />PM: Well you say does it concern me? I would expect<br />that as a result of the policies that we've had in place<br />to lower the level of activity, level of demand, that<br />there would be a lowering of confidence. That's an<br />inevitable concomitant of the policies that had to be<br />followed to rceduce the level of demand in this country.<br />But if the comparisons are being made with 1982 then I<br />would be much more concerned if in fact the things that<br />really mattered in that respect, that is employment,<br />growth and investment, if they were all worse, they are<br />not, they aria all better. Now I don't say that with any<br />sense of complacency but we've had to try and walk the<br />very difficult line of reducing demand, reducing<br />activity, but not doing it in a way which was going to<br />plunge us in-to the sort of depths of lowered activity<br />which was a characteristic of 1982-83.<br />JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, Dr Hewson says the<br />Opposition and him in particular should be at the Special<br />Premiers' Conference.<br />PM: Well there's one simple answer to that Dr Hewson.<br />You've got to become head of government before you attend<br />heads of governments' meetings.<br />JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, what specific areas would you look<br />for outcomes from this meeting?</p>
<p>PM: Geoff, : 1 think there'll be, in certain areas of<br />micro-economLc reform I think we'll get some agreement<br />there. I'm very hopeful that we'll be able to sign a<br />heads of agreement to establish a national rail-freight<br />corporation which will be a very significant advance.<br />There might be a couple of other areas in the regulatory<br />area. But obviously the other issues are of such<br />complexity that what we've got to do at this meeting is<br />to get the agreement as to working parties and the<br />principles ofE investigation. Like in the area of<br />duplication of services. I think there's one area there,<br />I hope, in regard to disabilities, the delivery of<br />services there, there may be a possibility of getting<br />agreement at this conference in that area. But in the<br />others I think we'll get agreement on principles and<br />priorities and processes of investigation with a report<br />back to special conferences next year.<br />JOURNALIST: What about mutual recognition of<br />regulations? PM: That concept is certainly going to be advanced at<br />this meeting. I would think that that will be accepted.<br />But that will still require then further work on it, but<br />the principle will be accepted I would think.<br />JOURNALIST: Are you expecting much antagonism or is<br />everyone going to be very friendly?<br />PM: I think it will generally be a very friendly and<br />cooperative : meeting. Now that the Chief Minister of the<br />Northern Territory has had his election, got that out of<br />the way, I hope he'll come along prepared to work hard<br />and constructively.<br />JOURNALIST: Can I just ask you about the election<br />results in New Zealand and the Northern Territory. Do<br />they show dissatisfaction with Labor that could have any<br />relevance to your case?<br />PM: No, we've got an election in 1993. It's a long time<br />away. I wouldn't like to face an election at the moment.<br />But I'm not going to.<br />JOURNALIST: What difference will a change of government<br />in New Zealand mean for Australia?<br />PM: Well I can't tell exactly. But I did ring Mr Bolger<br />on Saturday night. I've known him back to the 1970s when<br />I used to attend the International Labour Organisation<br />regularly as head of the Australian trade union movement.<br />He was then the New Zealand Minister of Labour. So I<br />know the fellow well. He agreed with me that things<br />would, the relationship would go on constructively and I<br />believe from. our point of view it will. As to any<br />differences that will emerge from changes in policy<br />that's a bit hard'to tell because following the campaign<br />from afar it: was hard to see a lot of differences in</p>
<p>economic policies that were being put forward by the<br />Nationals. JOURNALIST: Is there some comfort that the frigates<br />project will still go ahead?<br />PM: You may have noticed that I deliberately refrained<br />when this matter arose during last week from saying<br />anything about it because it didn't seem to me that it<br />would in any way be useful for me to be attempting to<br />intrude in that matter. But I'm certainly pleased to<br />have got the assurance from the Prime Minister elect that<br />they will adhere to the contract. It would have been a<br />difficulty if they hadn't adhered to their contract, not<br />only in regard to the specific issue but in regard to the<br />whole environment of our relationship.<br />JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, do you welcome the visit of a<br />private Australian envoy to Iraq to try and release our,<br />get our hostages released?<br />PM: Well the question of private envoys going there is a<br />very vexed one and we believe that there are a lot of<br />downsides in that. Our official representatives have<br />been unceasing in their representations to the<br />authorities in Iraq and I pay full tribute to them for<br />their commitment and their dedication and their unceasing<br />work. We will continue to try and do all that we can to<br />protect the interests of our citizens there and to get<br />their retrieval as it were from Iraq as soon as that's<br />humanly possible.<br />ends</p>
