    <content><![CDATA[<p>PRIME MINISTER ABBOTT:</p>
<p>Mr President, it’s terrific to have you back here in Australia for your second visit as President. </p>
<p>Tanzania and Australia have a strong and growing relationship.</p>
<p>Obviously we’re particularly interested in the commercial possibilities.</p>
<p>I know that there are some 18 significant Australian mining companies, which have over 100 separate mining operations, one way or another, in Tanzania. </p>
<p>So, while we are separated by a great ocean, we are reaching out our hand across the ocean and I would like to think that as a result of Your Excellency’s visit that the commercial and also the people-to-people links could strengthen over time.</p>
<p>We also have a common interest in the fight against violent extremism which I know afflicts your country, as well as ours. </p>
<p>It’s a problem for the whole world right now and obviously I’m keen to hear your insights on what are the best ways forward in tackling this urgent global problem.</p>
<p>But, welcome – it’s good to see you and thank you for visiting Australia. </p>
<p>PRESIDENT KIKWETE:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, I entirely agree with you that we – Australian and Tanzania – have a long history of cooperation, dates back from the time of our independence in 1961 to date.</p>
<p>We work closely together in international forums. We support each other – United Nations and the Commonwealth and of course now we work together in the Indian Ocean Rim.</p>
<p>We appreciate the support in the fight against narcotics; this year alone, I think, to apprehend over 800 kilograms of narcotics which were destined for Tanzania.</p>
<p>As you said, our investment and commercial relations have also been growing. </p>
<p>I was minister for mines when the gas and oil industry [inaudible] in Sydney. We’re now discussing cooperation in the natural gas developments. We have made some substantial discoveries there since 2010. We’re now at 55 trillion cubic feet. We have had eight companies come and develop the LNG – make use of the natural gas to produce other products.</p>
<p>So, our relationship at the political level which I think is there but we need to intensify ways of how we can work together to protect investments and commence trade and investment protection.</p>
<p>But otherwise we are happy to be here again, Prime Minister. </p>
