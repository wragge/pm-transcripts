    <content><![CDATA[<p>PRIME MINISTER ABBOTT:</p>
<p>Mr President, itâs terrific to have you back here in Australia for your second visit as President. </p>
<p>Tanzania and Australia have a strong and growing relationship.</p>
<p>Obviously weâre particularly interested in the commercial possibilities.</p>
<p>I know that there are some 18 significant Australian mining companies, which have over 100 separate mining operations, one way or another, in Tanzania. </p>
<p>So, while we are separated by a great ocean, we are reaching out our hand across the ocean and I would like to think that as a result of Your Excellencyâs visit that the commercial and also the people-to-people links could strengthen over time.</p>
<p>We also have a common interest in the fight against violent extremism which I know afflicts your country, as well as ours. </p>
<p>Itâs a problem for the whole world right now and obviously Iâm keen to hear your insights on what are the best ways forward in tackling this urgent global problem.</p>
<p>But, welcome â itâs good to see you and thank you for visiting Australia. </p>
<p>PRESIDENT KIKWETE:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, I entirely agree with you that we â Australian and Tanzania â have a long history of cooperation, dates back from the time of our independence in 1961 to date.</p>
<p>We work closely together in international forums. We support each other â United Nations and the Commonwealth and of course now we work together in the Indian Ocean Rim.</p>
<p>We appreciate the support in the fight against narcotics; this year alone, I think, to apprehend over 800 kilograms of narcotics which were destined for Tanzania.</p>
<p>As you said, our investment and commercial relations have also been growing. </p>
<p>I was minister for mines when the gas and oil industry [inaudible] in Sydney. Weâre now discussing cooperation in the natural gas developments. We have made some substantial discoveries there since 2010. Weâre now at 55 trillion cubic feet. We have had eight companies come and develop the LNG â make use of the natural gas to produce other products.</p>
<p>So, our relationship at the political level which I think is there but we need to intensify ways of how we can work together to protect investments and commence trade and investment protection.</p>
<p>But otherwise we are happy to be here again, Prime Minister. </p>
