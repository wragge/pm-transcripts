PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 28 JUNE 1988<br />
The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Mrs Margaret<br />
Thatcher, will be visiting Australia as a guest of the<br />
Government for the Bicentenary from 1 to 6 August. Mrs<br />
Thatcher will be having official discussions in Canberra,<br />
and visiting Perth, Melbourne and Sydney and Expo 88 for the<br />
British National Day.<br />
Mrs Thatcher's visit, in this Bicentennial year, will serve<br />
to underline the warmth and friendliness of the relations<br />
between Britain and Australia and to remind us of the<br />
enormous contribution to our country made by people from<br />
Britain since the beginning of European settlement.<br />
The British gave us, most importantly, our language and the<br />
basis for the institutions of our free society:<br />
parliamentary democracy, the law, and our system of liberal<br />
education. Australian traditions and values strongly<br />
reflect our British origins.<br />
The British influence has helped make Australia a country<br />
which has attracted other peoples from all over the world,<br />
and people from Britain continue to make a major<br />
contribution as valued immigrants.<br />
I am delighted that the British Prime Minister is able to<br />
visit in the year we commemorate two hundred years of<br />
Australian achievement. 17510 </p>
