OPENING OF THE AUSR A IAN-NEV ZEALP. IA<br />
ECTION C' 1N A L" FIC<br />
C'LE AT SYDN TJULY1 2<br />
Speech by the Prime Minister. the Rt. Ho nzi<br />
Sir, Parliamentary colleagues, Your Excellencies and Gentlemen:<br />
You may have been tempted to wonder that my<br />
colleague, being a politician, sat down on the tick of the<br />
clock. This is not a common disease among us. The explanation<br />
is that in front of me, as in front of him, as in front<br />
of somebody else here, there's a flashing light that begins to<br />
operate when you have fifteen seconds to go, and so if I finish<br />
up in the middle of a sentence, you won't put it down to mental<br />
decrepitude ( Laughter) with advancing years, you'll just understand<br />
that the clock has struck and that's all you can do about<br />
it. Sir, every time I hear the Postmaster-General<br />
talk about something being Phase 2 and that Phase 3 is coming<br />
along, I've learnt from long experience that Phase 4 is just<br />
around the corner and Phase 5 The Treasury, particularly,<br />
is always interested in those later developments, But I an<br />
bound to say that when I attended this Conference in 1959 it<br />
doesn't seem as long ago as that I little thought that the<br />
practical work of getting on with this job would have proceeded<br />
with such speed and such obvious skill, because this is a very<br />
remarkable occurrence. There's a good deal of rhetoric spoken about<br />
Australia and New Zealand getting closer together. I've heard<br />
one or two people say that we ought to take New Zealand over,<br />
I heard the Prime Minister of New Zealand say very witt. ly that<br />
if the takeover business was in the air, he was quite prepared<br />
to make an offer. ( Laughter) But, here we have something which,<br />
in actual physical terrns joins Australia to New Zealand this<br />
submarine cable, There s some dramatic significance about it,<br />
And, of course, its great significance is in the field of communications.<br />
Like some of you here today, I was born in the<br />
nineteenth century. Some of my political opponents, one of<br />
whom is here today, think that I was born in the seventeenth<br />
century ( Laughter). Anyhow, it was the nineteenth century, and<br />
the nineteenth century was a century in which communications were<br />
slow and difficult. People wrote letters a great art which<br />
has perhaps now passed into docay-c They travelled by stagecoaches<br />
for a great part of the century. Steam began and the first steam<br />
vessels began to emerge to take people from one country to another,<br />
But if you were to look back on the nineteenth and make a sort<br />
of comprehensive, sweeping statement, you would say that it was<br />
the century of slow comUunications.<br />
And if you look at our century the twentieth,<br />
I: n sure you will agree with me that the groa revolution in<br />
this century has been in the speed and variety of co. iM. unication.<br />
Voice to voice around the world. Because of jet aircraft and<br />
the like person to person around the world0 Because of the<br />
miracle of cable and other services writing to writing around<br />
the world. This is a tromendous revolution.<br />
If you leave Sydney in a jet aircraft, as I have<br />
repeatedly discovered you arrive in Honolulu before you leave<br />
Sydny. You got to San Fr: ncisc3 an hour or two later,<br />
Theres something about the Interoinational D&amp; to Line which<br />
explains this miracle, but I dcrnt understand the International<br />
03# 000 / 2 </p>
<p>Date Line and therefore I insist on saying that you arrive before<br />
you leave. And if the jolly things get any faster, you'll arrive<br />
anywhere in the world travelling in that direction before you<br />
leave. But it is the most remarkable thing that, actually in<br />
physical contact, this century should have put us in a position<br />
where we are no more than a few hours away from many of the<br />
people we would like to discuss things with.<br />
And, of course, the miracle of the international<br />
telephone, radio telephone, cable telephone, has I think been<br />
simply incredible. Now, this is a wonderful thing. I is a<br />
wonderful thing if we take advantage of it. I've never been one<br />
of those who believed that if we all spoke the same language right<br />
round the world we would be better friends. I don't think it<br />
follows, because it's very difficult to quarrel with a man in a<br />
language you don't understand. But it's very easy to quarrel<br />
with him in a language that you do. And, therefore, that's not<br />
the complete answer. But I believe, myself, that underneath it<br />
all, this speed of communications, this growing knowledge that<br />
people have of the other man's country and of other people, the<br />
growing means they have of direct conversation all these<br />
things -properly used, as I hope they will be, are going to<br />
revolutionise the face of the world and, I think, have a profound<br />
effect on international politics,<br />
It was one thing some few years back, to say,<br />
" Well, I'd like to find out what the Primo Minister of New<br />
Zealand is thinking about this matter. Or the External Affairs<br />
Minister might say, " I'd like to know what the External Affairs<br />
Minister ( who is the same person) is thinking aoout it in New<br />
Zealand. But with this, today, I think we've reached the<br />
absolute ultimate with no interruption. If I want to talk to<br />
the Prime Minister of New Zealand as I expect to in a few<br />
minutes' time, you pick up the telephone, you rely on the Post<br />
Office or whoever it may be, to give you a quick " through" and<br />
there you are. You have a discussion about things which, if<br />
they had to be put into other terms and sent in cespatches and<br />
what not, would mean a delay of quite a long time.<br />
So that I believe that we are, today, witnessing<br />
or taking part in a quite historic event and, of course, when<br />
the other phases are complete, when it's not only to New<br />
Zealand, but to Honolulu to Vancouver, across Canada to Great<br />
Britain, you'll have a ring through British Commonwealth<br />
countries and, in particular, through those Commonwealth<br />
countries which are within the direct allegiance to the throne<br />
Great Britain, Canada, New Zealand, Australia You know,<br />
together, we're not insignificant in this world. There are new<br />
fashions, there are new organizations, there are new ideas, but<br />
in the long run, it is on the cohesion of countries like those<br />
I've mentioned that a good deal of the sanity of the world will<br />
depend. And his will bring us closer together.<br />
I frequently say that it is one of the oddities<br />
of life -it is, too, that if one of my Ministers wants to go<br />
to Perth, well, he goes to Perthe He goes aboard a plano and<br />
goes there. It's not my business it's his. But if he wants<br />
to go a much shorter distance, to Auckland, that . s an overseas<br />
journey. That is written down in the book .( Laughter) It is<br />
the subject of questions in the House. Now, of course, this is<br />
all too silly. New Zealand is just as close to the great centres<br />
of population in Australia as is the West Coast of Austra√± ia<br />
itself. And this significant fact, this fact which ought to<br />
have made us much closer than we are, is being underlined by<br />
what happens today, Because this cable brings us, through this<br />
mediui, closer and clearer to the Dominion of New Zealand. / 3 </p>
<p>Ar. n' thiix is wiy a Prime Minister of Australia and<br />
a Prime linister of New Zoaland can feel tremendously pleased<br />
at the event that is being celebrated.<br />
I said, Sir, that there were many ways and means<br />
that had boon uvolvod in the twont: ioth cen tury for improving<br />
communications. I'd just like to repeat before I conclude<br />
that these are the mechanics of international relations,<br />
They still leave the substance of international relations as<br />
a matter of profound, human responsibility, The scientists,<br />
the technologists, have given us to our hands and to our ears,<br />
all the mechanical aids that we need and, of course, others<br />
are still undreamed of. All the mechanical aids that we need<br />
today to be in touch with people, to hear what they have to<br />
say, to tell them what we have to say. And I believe that as<br />
the scientists and the technologists have done this so it will<br />
be the task of statesmanship around the world to see that these<br />
things are applied in the highest possible fashion to produce<br />
the greatest possible areas of understanding and of peace,<br />
Now, Sir, in a couple of minutes' time I've been<br />
given my instructions something happens and I pick up the<br />
telephone and I have a conversation with Mr. Holyoake, You<br />
will all listen in to it. I remember when I was at Canberra,<br />
helping to open the coaxial cable, the Lord Mayor of Sydney<br />
had a talk with the Lord Mayor of Melbourne and I thought he<br />
beat him right off the track ( Laughter) and before we came down<br />
here, I said to my colleagues up above, " You know, it's just<br />
a gamble as to who gets in first, Mr. Holyoake or myself;<br />
because whoever gets in first is likely to drive the other<br />
man off the course ( Laughter). So, if you find that I have<br />
too little to say, you will please credit that fact partly to<br />
the superiority and attainments of my opposite number in New<br />
Zealand and partly to my innate and well-known modesty,<br />
( Laughter) Now, Sir that hasntt rung for me yet. They said<br />
to me " Pick up the phone with your right hand" and I said,<br />
" How do you know that I'm not a bit deaf in the right ear"<br />
( Laughter). That's what they take for granted. I have misread<br />
the clock, (' Phone rings)<br />
Voice: Mr, Menzies, Mr, Holyoake is on the line.<br />
Mr. Holyoake Hello, Bob.<br />
Mr. Menzies: Hello, Keith, how are you?<br />
Mr, Holyoake I'n just one hundred percent.<br />
Mr. Monzios Where are you? In the Auckland Town Hall?<br />
Mro Holyoake I'm in the Auckland Town Hall and obviously<br />
you're here too, Bob, by the sound of your voice.<br />
Mr. Menzies It; s pretty good servico, isn't it?<br />
Mr, Holyoake Yes it's tcrrifi3<br />
Mr, Menzies We must advertise it ( Laughter)<br />
Mr. Holyoake It's cetting a pretty good kickoff today.<br />

Mr.<br />
Mr. Mr. Holyoake Menzies Holyoake<br />
Mr. Menzies Yes, Well I'm in the head offi. ce here, with<br />
a couple o' hundred tired businessmen locking<br />
on and listening in. Have you got the same<br />
kind of thing?<br />
I think just a little more than a couple of<br />
hundred. I must always just top Australia,<br />
musn't I?<br />
That's quite right.<br />
Little more than two hundred. A very, very<br />
representative gathering.<br />
Well it's quality rather than quantity that<br />
counts. ( Laughter) How's Jack Marshall, is he<br />
in good form?<br />
Jack's very well, and highly appreciative of your<br />
assistance, of course, over in London.<br />
Are you taking him with you in September?<br />
Most likely. I would think almost certainly.<br />
I think he's frightfully good.<br />
John McZoen going with you?<br />
Yes.<br />
We will look forward to forgathering with you.<br />
That's right. Will you be going just at the<br />
last moment, or a few days earlier?<br />
It will depend on my House a bit. Will yours<br />
be meeting at that time?<br />
4oll, by a brilliant arrangement, heartily<br />
concurred in on both sides, my House is not<br />
sitting in Septomber, so that whoever is Prime<br />
Minister at the end of August, will continue to<br />
be Prime Minister until the end of September.<br />
( Laughter)<br />
I'm just a little more fortunate, Bob. I haven't<br />
got quite the anxiety from the House that you have.<br />
That's quite right. ( Laughter) And you even<br />
improved your position at a by-election.<br />
Well, we didn't win the seat, but it was<br />
improved, yes.<br />
Well I hope that there's an easterly wind blowing<br />
and the habit comes over the Tasman ( Laughter)<br />
I couldn't wish you more than that, of course.<br />
Wo .11 do our best anyhow.,<br />
I say, it's an extraordinary thing being hitched<br />
up like this,<br />
Tt's wonderful. It's a most historic affair, this<br />
We've j. ust ben talking a out it here, 0 0 Ot@ </p>

Mr. Holyoako t<br />
Mr. Menzies<br />
Mr. Holyoake Another close link,<br />
You know what this means instead of sending<br />
letters to you in future, i' 1 ring you up,<br />
My goodness. Don't forget New Zealand is<br />
ahead of Australia again, Bob,<br />
I know that. Two hours ahead, in point of<br />
time. Oh yes9 we've always conceded that.<br />
Just another thought. This links us so much<br />
more closely together, You remember when was<br />
in Canberra five or six weeks ago, I made our<br />
position quite cluar, didn't I, on the question<br />
of the seventh State of the Commonwealth?<br />
That's right. I was telling the audience here<br />
about it, Vhat you said was, that if there was<br />
any takeover talk in the air, you were prepared<br />
to make a bid. Does that still stand?<br />
Yes, that still stands.<br />
i'll discuss the details with you when we meet<br />
next, When you think, too, not of just Australia but a<br />
link up through Canada and Britain. We are<br />
going to talk just in this fashion. Perhaps we<br />
won't have any more Commonwealth Prime Ministers'<br />
Conferences,<br />
Well, that's well on the cards. How does that<br />
strike you?<br />
W0ll1 I think that had better go on the Order<br />
Paper. ( Laughter)<br />
Yes, I think so.<br />
Toc many people listening in.<br />
Look, Keith, I think all the gentlemen who are<br />
hero today would like me to ask you to convey<br />
to your audience in the Auckland Town Hall the<br />
warm good wishes that Australia. entertains<br />
for your country. Would you do that?<br />
Thank you very much, Bob. They've all heard<br />
it over the loudsoeaker system, and can I on<br />
behalf of everybody here, everybody assoclated<br />
with this venture and, indeed, everybody in<br />
New Zealand warmly reciprocate your good wishes<br />
in that respect.<br />
Thank you very much.<br />
1 think, Bob, it's a tremendous experience for<br />
us both, for me at least, it's a tremendous<br />
experience to share this unique occasion with<br />
youo a o@ e ** 04u3 ./ 6 </p>
<p>Mr. Menz ie-<br />
Mr. Holyoake<br />
Mr. Menzies<br />
Mr. Holyoake Thank you very much and I have exactly the<br />
same feeling. As a matter of fact, I don't<br />
need to tell you, we and your New Zealanders<br />
like to have a chip at each other, You know,<br />
it's rather the vogue, but down underneata it<br />
all, there are those things between us, aren't<br />
there, that can't be destroycd.<br />
The closest and the deepest ties.<br />
That's it, Perhaps, at this stage, I should<br />
say the appropriate word, and you'll do yours<br />
at your end, will you? I have the great honour<br />
of declaring, on behalf of Australia, and at the<br />
Australianmend, this cable open.<br />
And I join with you, and on behalf of all the<br />
people of New Zealand at this end, I join warmly<br />
in declaring the cable officially open from the<br />
New Zealand end. </p>
