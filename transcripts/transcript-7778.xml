TRANSCRIPT OF DOORSTOP, FAIRBAIRN RAAF BASE, CANBERRA<br />
16 OCTOBER 1989<br />
E OE PROOF ONLY<br />
JOURNALIST: Is Mr Fraser's nomination locked away in Kuala<br />
Lumpur? Are you confident?<br />
PM: It's very close. We think we're in front. But it's a<br />
bit too close to call.<br />
JOURNALIST: Are you encouraged by developments in South<br />
Africa over the weekend. You'll be discussing sanctions.<br />
Is the de Klerk government moving fast enough for you?<br />
PM: Not fast enough but there are signs of positive change.<br />
We'll be discussing these there and particularly I'll be<br />
wanting to get an assessment from those who are closest to<br />
the action in Southern Africa.<br />
JOURNALIST: Is South Africa likely to dominate the<br />
conference at all?<br />
PM: No I don't think it will dominate in the same sense as<br />
it has before. That doesn't mean it has any lesser sense of<br />
urgency. But much of the decision making has been done.<br />
We'll be wanting to hear reports from those who have been<br />
fairly close, including Mrs Thatcher who has had the<br />
opportunity of talking with the South African leadership.<br />
JOURNALIST: Are you in any way concerned that there may be<br />
aflow-on effect from Black Friday on Wall Street to our<br />
stock exchanges today?<br />
PM: we'll wait and see. The indications are that it<br />
shouldn't have the same sort of repercussions that it had<br />
last time either within the United States or elsewhere. So<br />
we'll wait and see on that.<br />
JOURNALIST: Are you concerned it may have an adverse effect<br />
on interest rates?<br />
PM: ( inaudible)<br />
JOURNALIST: considering an election over the weekend.<br />
What did you decide?<br />
PM: You're trying desperately. Have a good time fellas and<br />
ladies. ends </p>
