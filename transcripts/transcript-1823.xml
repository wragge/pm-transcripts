COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA<br />
SPEECH BY<br />
The Rt Hon. J. G. GORTON, M. P.<br />
ON<br />
VIETNAM: STATEMENT BY PRESIDENT OF<br />
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA<br />
Ministerial Statement<br />
[ From the ' Parliamentary Debates', 2 April 1968]<br />
Mr GORTON ( Higgins-Prime Minister)<br />
-by leave-Yesterday at noon, Australian<br />
eastern time, the President of the United<br />
States announced-decisions lately taken concerning<br />
the war in Vietnam. Those decisions<br />
were, firstly, to build up the South Vietnamese<br />
armed forces to a planned target of<br />
800,000 men-an increase of 135,000-and<br />
to re-equip those augmented forces with<br />
more modern equipment from the United<br />
States; secondly, to maintain the United<br />
States forces at the level of approximately<br />
525,000 men, which is the level of the<br />
United States forces in South Vietnam now,<br />
and to dispatch some ancillary troops to<br />
service troops which ' had recently been flown<br />
to South Vietnam; thirdly, to renew a resolve<br />
to continue the military struggle in South<br />
Vietnam until such time as a just and lasting<br />
peace could be worked out in that country;<br />
and, fourthly, to cease or halt aerial and<br />
naval bombardment over a major part of<br />
North Vietnam in the hope that such cessation<br />
might lead to the beginning of talks<br />
designed to secure such a just peace. I made<br />
a public statement on that matter, but I feel<br />
that I should repeat it ' here in the House<br />
before expanding upon it. The statement that<br />
I made is as follows:<br />
t4886/ 68 The statement-<br />
I am referring, of course, to the statement<br />
made by President Johnson:<br />
re-emphasises two important aspects of the<br />
approach of the United States.<br />
One is that the United States is firmly resolved<br />
to continue the military struggle to the point where<br />
it becomes recognised that talks designed to secure<br />
a just and lasting peace must take place.<br />
The other is that the United States is prepared<br />
now, as it has been prepared in the past, to enter<br />
into such talks at once, and is prepared to make<br />
concessions in an effort to bring about such talks.<br />
The ' Australian Government has repeatedly indicated<br />
that it would support peace negotiations<br />
provided they held promise of leading to a<br />
just and lasting peace which effectively safeguards<br />
the security and freedom of choice of the people<br />
of South Vietnam.<br />
The Australian Government regards this initiative<br />
by the American President as a further and<br />
significant exhibition of willingness on the part of<br />
the United States of America to engage in talks<br />
aimed at that end. The halting of bombing over<br />
most of North Vietnam, without insistence on an<br />
indication from Hanoi of a willingness to negotiate<br />
or of a reciprocal cessation of military build-up<br />
by North Vietnam. will test the willingness of<br />
Hanoi to enter into discussions aimed at a peaceful<br />
settlement of a genuine kind. We must all bope<br />
that this response by Hanoi is forthcoming quickly.<br />
At the same time, the continuation of bombing<br />
in the area to the north of the battlefields will </p>
<p>continue to hamper the flow of troops and war<br />
material from north to south and will not leave<br />
allied troops at too great a military disadvantage.<br />
I now propose to expand somewhat Upon<br />
that statement of the Government's attitude.<br />
The decision by the President to halt<br />
the bombing of the larger part of North<br />
Vietnam-a part where 90% of the population<br />
lives and works--naturally has<br />
attracted world attention. I say ' naturally'<br />
because of the recent suggestions made in<br />
many quarters, and supported, I understand,<br />
by U Thant, that if the United States halted<br />
its bombing of controlled and selected targets<br />
in that area, the North Vietnamese<br />
would be prepared to enter into discussions<br />
aimed at securing a just, lasting and genuine<br />
peace for the South Vietnamese. I say<br />
, naturally' also because against that background<br />
this gesture by the United States,<br />
giving up as it does a military advantage,<br />
is the most significant and generous gesture<br />
yet made in the hope of starting such<br />
negotiations. It is, Mr Speaker, an extension of the<br />
offer made by the President of the United<br />
States at San Antonio last September when<br />
he publicly offered to halt* the bombing<br />
of North Vietnam as soon as the North<br />
Vietnamese had indicated that such a halt<br />
would lead promptly to productive discussions.<br />
That offer was rejected by Hanoi.<br />
Now, the President has gone the second<br />
mile. Instead of saying: ' Give us an indication<br />
that you will begin peace talks and<br />
we will then halt bombing', the President<br />
is saying: ' We will now halt the bombing<br />
and ask you in return to respond by beginning<br />
negotiations'. This will provide, I<br />
think, an acid test of whether Hanoi has<br />
any genuine wish to enter into peaceful<br />
negotiations or not. We -all hope they will<br />
and that Britain and the Soviet Union, to<br />
whom my Government has sent messages<br />
supporting President Johnson's appeal, will<br />
use their best efforts to see that they do.<br />
At the same time it is important to realise<br />
that not all bombing has been halted. In<br />
those areas contiguous to the battlefields in<br />
North and South Vietnam, those areas<br />
where North Vietnamese troops and munitions<br />
of war gather and flow towards the<br />
south, the continuation of bombardment to<br />
hamper, -hinder and reduce this flow will<br />
continue. Reinforcement of men and supplies<br />
will not be stopped by this. But if even<br />
a ouarter of the troops destined for the South are disabled, if even a quarter<br />
of the mortar bombs, missiles and<br />
artillery shells are destroyed before they<br />
can wreak their destruction in the South, if<br />
the time taken to transport supplies is<br />
doubled, then great assistance will have<br />
been given to Allied troops in the South and<br />
casualties among Allied troops which otherwise<br />
would have been incurred will not be<br />
incurred. That is why the President said:<br />
I cannot in conscience stop all bombing<br />
so long as to do so would immediately and<br />
directly endanger the lives of our men and ouallies.<br />
I imagine there would be few Australians<br />
who would not agree with him. We for our<br />
part have consistently made it clear that we<br />
believe that there is a military advantage in<br />
the bombing of controlled and selected targets<br />
of military significance in North Vietnam.<br />
We have as consistently made it clear<br />
that we supported the concept of -halting<br />
such bombing when the North Vietnamese<br />
were prepared to enter into peace talks, subject<br />
to the military build-up in -the South<br />
by the North Vietnamese not continuing<br />
because of the bombing halt. These latest<br />
proposals which continue to offer protection<br />
and support to Allied troops in the<br />
northern battlefields but which deliberately<br />
forgo the military advantage of more widespread<br />
bombing in the hope of securing the<br />
beginning of peace talks, also have our<br />
support and we hope they will be successful,<br />
for we in Australia seek, as was stated in<br />
the Governor-General's Speech at the beginnipg<br />
of this Parliament:<br />
neither the destruction of North Vietnam,<br />
nor the overthrow of the Government of North<br />
Vietnam but merely the cessation of aggression<br />
against the people of South Vietnam so that those<br />
people may, by the exercise of a franchise they<br />
have shown they know how to exercise even under<br />
the most difficult and dangerous circumstances,<br />
choose their own form of Government. We seek<br />
a just and lasting peace based on these objectives.<br />
We have supported and will support every effort<br />
for negotiation of such a peace.<br />
This latest initiative is an effort to begin<br />
such negotiations for such a peace. We<br />
hope, and I think all Australians hope, that<br />
this objective will be attained. It is now<br />
for Hanoi to respond and to show whether<br />
this peace initiative will or will not be<br />
rebuffed, whether this significant concession<br />
will or will not be ignored, whether the war<br />
will continue at its present tempo or<br />
whether, if progress is made in peace talks.<br />
it may abate. But we should not lose sight </p>
<p>in discussing this phase of the President's<br />
statement of that reiteration in it of a firm<br />
resolve, should peace initiatives of this kind<br />
be rebuffed, to continue the struggle until it<br />
is clear to those who are aggressors that<br />
there will have to be talks which will lead<br />
to a true peace and not to something which<br />
the President described as a fake peace.<br />
We for our part are ready to stand with<br />
our allies, as we have in the war's prosecution.<br />
We are ready to support our allies<br />
as we have in actions designed to seek talks to secure a true peace. It is our hope that<br />
this latest initiative may be accepted and<br />
that those people in South Vietnam may,<br />
through it, gain those rights of self determination<br />
for the preservation of which this<br />
war began and for the restoration and<br />
preservation of which the President's statement<br />
indicates that this war will, if necessary,<br />
be continued, but which, as a result<br />
of the initiative he has . taken, offers a hope<br />
of peace talks attaining this objective without<br />
further loss of life.<br />
