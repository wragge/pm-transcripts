FLOODAID FOR NEW OUTH WALES<br />
Statement I y the Prime Minister, Mr. lohn Gorton<br />
The Prime Minister announced today that, following discusscions held<br />
between Commonwealth and State officials at the request of the New South Wales<br />
Premier, the Commonwealth Government stood ready to provide additional assistance<br />
to the New South Wales Government in financing relief measures required as a result<br />
of the major flooding in the State.<br />
The Commonwealth Government has already made available the services<br />
of the Defence Forces to help with rescue operations and it has announced a grant<br />
of $ 50, 000 as a contribution to the cost of providing, on a for basis, with the State,<br />
relief of personal hardship and distress to those affected by the flood.<br />
The Commonwealth would, the Prime Minister said, provide further funds<br />
as required for this purpose.<br />
Apart from immediate relief of distress, such assistance is available for<br />
meeting essential repairs to houses and for repairing and replacing essential items<br />
of furniture and personal effects to the extent required to provide reasonable living<br />
conditions for those in necessitous circumstances.<br />
The Prime Minister said that, in addition to sharing the cost of relief of<br />
personal hardship and distress, the Commonwealth would assist in financing certain<br />
other fLood relief measures where the cost of this would impose an undue burden on<br />
the State's finances. The Premier of New South V/ ales has indicated that, as the State was already<br />
committed to expenditure of arou ' nd $ 4 million on other natural disaster relief measures,<br />
it would have difficulty in n-eeting additional ex-penditure in 1973-71 for flood relief. In<br />
these circumstances, the Commonwealth Government had agreed to meet all expenditure<br />
in 1970-71 on natural disaster relief in excess of $ 5 million. In practical terms, this<br />
means. that the State's contribution to flood relief other than the relief a! personal<br />
hardship and distress would be limited to about $ 1 million in the currenit financial year.<br />
Under this arrangement agreed between the Commonwealth and the State,<br />
assistance will be provided in addition to relief of personal hardship and distress, for<br />
Carry-on loans at concessional interest rates to farmers<br />
affected by the floods who are in necessitous circumstances<br />
and who are unable to obtain additional credit through normal<br />
commercial channels. / 2 </p>

Restoration of certain State and. Local Government<br />
assets damaged-by-theifloods.<br />
The New South Wales Premier, Mrz. Askin, had pointed out that it was difficult<br />
-to-be-precise as to the amounts required at this stage simply because Ouch a large part<br />
of the floo-d iffccted areas worc still1 under water..-However, flooding i both the northwestern<br />
areas of the State and the south coast o! the State had been most severe and<br />
quite clearly substantial amounts would be needed to remedy the chaos which the floods<br />
had created and to assist those in real need. Preliminary estimates suggested that an<br />
amount in excess of $ 10 million could be involved. This would, of course, be additional<br />
to the substantial expenditure on restoring flood damage that would be financed through<br />
private insurance. Details of the terms of Commonwealth assistance to the State were still being<br />
worked out. However, the New South Wales Premier had indicated that relief forms had<br />
been issued to-all Police Stations and Councils in the flood affected areas while farmers<br />
needing carry-on assistance should make application through the nearest Branch of the<br />
Rural Bank.<br />
