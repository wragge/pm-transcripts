PRIME MINISTER<br />
EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY<br />
DEPARTURE OF POPE JOHN PAUL 11<br />
PERTH INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT 1 DECEMBER 1986<br />
Your Holiness,<br />
It is with some regret that I undertake the task of<br />
farewelling you from our country. For it has been a great<br />
honour to have you as our guest over the last week; more<br />
than that, it has been a great pleasure.<br />
You have visited every Australian State and mainland<br />
Territory. You have made contact with hundreds of thousands<br />
of Australians in all walks of life the young, the old,<br />
the sick, the unemployed; in hospitals and in our homes;<br />
at work in the country, in industries and in universities.<br />
For people of all faiths, and most especially Australia's<br />
large Roman Catholic community, your visit has been an<br />
inspiration and a cause for great joy.<br />
it has been an experience which all of us have found<br />
stimulating and inspiring and which you yourself, we are<br />
pleased to see, have evidently found rewarding.<br />
Your schedule has been an extremely demanding one. Yet you<br />
have retained throughout your freshness and enthusiasm and<br />
your genuine interest in Australian people and their<br />
problems. Your Holiness,<br />
When you arrived in Canberra last Monday you said that you<br />
came to us as a pilgrim, as one who journeys as an act of<br />
religious devotion.<br />
While you have been here you preached a message of peace, of<br />
hope, and of justice. You reminded us of the dignity and<br />
importance of human work. You drew attention to the tragedy<br />
of unemployment. You issued a message of hope to the<br />
Aboriginal people. And you have caught the imagination and<br />
tapped the idealism of our young people who seek peace and<br />
justice in the world. </p>
<p>Australians who have seen you, whether at first hand or<br />
through the media, have been reminded that despite<br />
differences in religious beliefs, political opinions and<br />
material circumstances, we are united as one nation,<br />
basically sharing a common core of ideals, a responsibility<br />
towards each other and an aspiration to live in peace and<br />
harmony. On behalf of all Australians I thank you for the efforts you<br />
have made so willingly and unstintingly to remind us of<br />
those great values.<br />
I hope you leave our shores with a strong conviction that<br />
this is a country prepared to support the cause of peace and<br />
justice.<br />
You leave behind you the impression of a leader committed to<br />
those universal values of peace and justice, and of a man<br />
with an abiding compassion for all people.<br />
Your Holiness,<br />
On behalf of all Australians I wish you a safe return to<br />
Rome and every success in your continuing endeavours for<br />
peace and for the betterment of mankind. -i </p>
