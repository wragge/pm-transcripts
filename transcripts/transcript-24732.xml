    <content><![CDATA[<p>It is a tremendous honour for me to be here at the final resting place of Eddie Koiki Mabo.</p>
<p>He was a giant of your island and of your people.</p>
<p>He was a warrior who fought for justice and now he rests amongst the other warriors of your people.</p>
<p>He was your father, your brother, your kinsman and he’s our citizen.</p>
<p>All Australians now embrace Eddie Koiki Mabo.</p>
<p>Yes, at the time there was much contention.</p>
<p>He fought for justice. For many years justice was denied.</p>
<p>Eventually – too late perhaps – but nevertheless, eventually justice was granted and now we are a people on the path to reconciliation in large measure because of what Eddie Koiki Mabo and his brothers and sisters fought for.</p>
<p>The struggle for justice, justice sought, justice granted and people moving forward together as Australians – that is what we must all seek and thanks to Eddie Koiki Mabo, that is something to which we are closer to today than we have ever been in our history.</p>
