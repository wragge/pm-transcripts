NOTES FOR THE PRIME MINISTER, MR, E. G. WHITLAM, M. P.,<br />
AT THE OPENING OF THE HENTY ELECTORATE OFFICE OF MRS, JOAN<br />
CHILD, OAKLEIGH, MELBOURNE, VIC.<br />
FRIDAY, 16 AUGUST 1974<br />
1. THE PEOPLE OF HENTY MADE HISTORY THIS YEAR BY ELECTING<br />
MRS, JOAN CHILD AS THE FIRST WOMEN TO REPRESENT THE AUSTRALIAN<br />
LABOR PARTY IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,<br />
IT WAS THE FIRST TIME HENTY HAD ELECTED A WOMEN TO THE<br />
PARLIAMENT. THE 1968 RE-DISTRIBUTION CHANGED THE ELECTORATE<br />
IN A WAY WHICH STRENGTHENED THE LIBERAL PARTY'S PROSPECTS<br />
OF HOLDING THE SEAT, BUT AT HER SECOND ATTEMPT, MRS. CHILD<br />
WON IT. IT IS SOMETHING OF A LABOR OASIS IN A LIBERAL DESERT.<br />
AS IT IS SURROUNDED BY FIVE LIBERAL SEATS HOTHAM, BRUCE,<br />
CHISiHOLM, BALACLAVA AND HIGGINS.<br />
2. MRS, CHILD DELIVERED HER MAIDEN SPEECH IN THE HOUSE OF<br />
REPRESENTATIVES ON 16 JULY, SHE DEVOTED MOST OF HER SPEECH<br />
TO ARGUING THE NEED FOR THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT TO DO MORE<br />
FOR HANDICAPPED PEOPLE. THIS IS AN AREA IN WHICH THE<br />
AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT HAS DONE MUCH. IN THE LAST 20 MONTHS.<br />
WE ARE DETERMINED TO ENSURE ADEQUATE HELP FOR THE HANDICAPPED,<br />
BOTH YOUNG AND OLD. IN LAST '' EAR'S BUDGET THE HANDICAPPED<br />
CHILDRENS BENEFIT WAS DOUBLED FROM $ 1.50 A DAY TO $ 3,00 A DAY,<br />
THIS BENEFIT, WHICH IS PAID UNDER THE NATIONAL HEALTH ACT,<br />
WAS INTRODUCED IN 1969. IT HAS TWO PURPOSES: </p>
<p>-2-<br />
TO ASSIST PARENTS OF HANDICAPPED CHILDREN AND TO HELP<br />
ORGANISATIONS MEET THE RUNNING COSTS OF HOMES. THE BUDGET<br />
CONTAINED FOUR SPECIFIC BENEFITS FOR THE REHABILITATION OF<br />
HANDICAPPED PEOPLE. IT REMOVED THE THREE-YEAR LIMIT FOR<br />
ASSISTANCE THROUGH THE WELFARE REHABILITATION SERVICE.<br />
PREVIOUSLY PEOPLE WERE ACCEPTED FOR REHABILITATION ONLY<br />
IF THEY WERE CONSIDERED TO HAVE REASONABLE PROSPECTS OF BEING<br />
ENGAGED IN A SUITABLE VOCATION WITHIN THREE YEARS. THE<br />
TRAINING ALLOWANCE FOR PEOPLE UNDERGOING FULL-TIME VOCATIONAL<br />
TRAINING THROUGH THE WELFARE REHABILITATION SERVICE WAS<br />
INCREASED FROM $ 4,00 A WEEK TO $ 8.00 A WEEK, THE LIVINGAWAY-<br />
FROM-HOME ALLOWANCE WAS DOUBLED AND SET AT $ 10.00 A WEEK<br />
FOR UNMARRIED TRAINEES UNDERGOING FULL-TIME TRAINING THROUGH<br />
THE REHABILITATION TRAINING SCHEME AND AT $ 16.00 A WEEK FOR<br />
MARRIED TRAINEES. THESE ALLOWANCES ARE DESIGNED TO ASSIST<br />
HANDICAPPED PEOPLE WHO MUST LIVE AWAY FROM THEIR USUAL PLACE<br />
OF RESIDENCE IN ORDER TO UNDERGO VOCATIONAL TRAINING. IN<br />
ADDITION THE BUDGET PROVIDED A $ 2 FOR $ 1 GOVERNMENT SUBSIDY<br />
ON MONEY BORROWED BY LOCAL GOVERNMENT BODIES FOR PROJECTS<br />
UNDER THE SHELTERED EMPLOYMENT ( ASSISTANCE) ACT AND THE<br />
HANDICAPPED CHILDREN ( ASSISTANCE) ACT. THIS MEASURE IS<br />
AIMED AT ENCOURAGING LOCAL GOVERNMENT BODIES TO SPONSOR<br />
SHELTERED WORKSHOPS, TRAINING CENTRES AND HOSTELS FOR HANDICAPPED.<br />
ADULTS AND CHILDREN. PREVIOUSLY, LEGISLATION HAD PREVENTED<br />
THESE FUNDS FROM ATTRACTING A SUBSIDY. </p>

3. DRAMATIC ADVANCES HAVE ALSO BEEN MADE BY OTHER AUSTRALIAN<br />
GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS CONCERNED WITH HANDICAPPED PEOPLE,<br />
SUCH AS THE DEPARTMENTS OF EDUCATION AND HEALTH, FOLLOWING<br />
THE REPORT OF THE INTERIM COMMITTEE FOR THE AUSTRALIAN SCHOOLS<br />
COMMISSION, THE GOVERNMENT IS MOUNTING A MAJOR ATTACK ON THE<br />
PRESENT DEFICIENCIES IN THE EDUCATION OF MENTALLY AND PHYSICALLY<br />
HANDICAPPED CHILDREN, IN 1974 AND 1975 THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT<br />
WILL PROVIDE THE STATES WITH A GRANT OF $ 435 MILLION FOR SPECIAL<br />
AND REMEDIAL EDUCATION. THIS WILL ENABLE THE IMPLEMENTATION OF<br />
A PROGRAM CONSISTING OF CONSTRUCTION OF NEW SCHOOLS AND THE<br />
REPLACEMENT AND UPGRADING OF EXISTING SUB-STANDARD ONES, THE<br />
PROVISION OF ADDITIONAL MATERIALS, AN INCREASE IN SUPPORT AND<br />
SPECIALIST STAFF AND A REDUCTION IN CLASS SIZES, IN THE SAME<br />
PERIOD WE WILL PROVIDE A TOTAL OF $ 3,63 MILLION FOR THE TRAINING<br />
OF TEACHERS OF HANDICAPPED CHILDREN, THEFUNDS WE ARE PROVIDING<br />
WILL REPRESENT THE FIRST SUBSTANTIAL RECOGNITION BY THE<br />
AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT OF THE NEED OF STATE EDUCATION AUTHORITIES<br />
FOR SPECIAL ASSISTANCE FOR THE EDUCATION OF HANDICAPPED CHILDREN,<br />
PROVISION HAS ALSO BEEN MADE FOR HANDICAPPED PEOPLE IN OUR<br />
COMMUNITY HEALTH PROGRAM, WHICH HAS BEEN INITIATED BY THE<br />
AUSTRALIAN MINISTER FOR HEALTH, DR. EVERINGHAM, AND THE NEWLY<br />
ESTABLISHED HOSPITALS AND HEALTH SERVICE COMMISSION, </p>
<p>4, THE GOVERNMENT'S OVERALL AIM IS TO REPLACE THE PREVIOUS<br />
AD HOC APPROACH TO WELFARE WITH A SYSTEMATIC APPROACH WHICH<br />
TAKES INTO ACCOUNT THE NEEDS OF PHYSICALLY, MENTALLY AND<br />
FINANCIALLY DISADVANTAGED PEOPLE ACROSS THE NATION, WE WANT<br />
TO SEE THE NATION'S WELFARE RESOURCES CO-ORDINATED FOR THE<br />
FIRST TIME, THE MAJOR EFFORT DIRECTED TO THIS END IS IN THE<br />
HANDS OF THE SOCIAL WELFARE COMMISSION, IT WAS ESTABLISHED<br />
BY THE GOVERNMENT LAST YEAR TO MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS ON COMMUNITY<br />
NEEDS IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF WELFARE PROGRAMS, TO DETERMINE<br />
PRIORITIES AND EVALUATE PROGRAMS, TO ESTIMATE COSTS AND TO<br />
ENCOURAGE THE CO-ORDINATTON AND INTEGRATION OF ALL WELFARE<br />
SERVICES, THE COMMISSION HAS THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR INITIATING<br />
THE AUSTRALIAN ASSISTANCE PLAN AS THE VEHICLE FOR CO-ORDINATING<br />
AND INTEGRATING ALL WELFARE RESOURCES IN'A WAY THAT WILL BEST<br />
MEET THE NEEDS OF AUSTRALIAN COMMUNITIES, THE ASSISTANCE PLAN<br />
HAS AS ITS MAIN PURPOSE THE ESTABLISHMENT OF AUTONOMOUS COMMUNITYBASED<br />
SOCIAL PLANNING UNITS, THEIR JOB IS TO INCREASE LOCAL<br />
INVOLVEMENT IN SOCIAL WELFARE ACTIVITY, ALTHOUGH THE PLAN HAS<br />
BEEN IN OPERATION FOR ONLY A FEW MONTHS, THE FIRST OF THESE<br />
PLANNING UNITS KNOWN AS REGIONAL COUNCILS FOR SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT<br />
ARE TAKING SHAPE,<br />
I </p>
<p>IN HER MAIDEN SPEECH JOAN CHILD SAID:<br />
" A NATION'S WEALTH IS MEASURED BY THE CARE AND COMPASSION<br />
IT IS PREPARED TO EXTEND TO THE OLD AND LONELY, THE DEPENDENT,<br />
THE DISABLED AND THE YOUNG WHO ARE IN THE SCHOOLS."<br />
THAT VERY PRINCIPLE HAS GUIDED MUCH OF OUR ENDEAVOURS IN THE<br />
LAST 20 MONTHS. I HAVE ALREADY OUTLINED WHAT WE HAVE DONE FOR<br />
THE DISABLED AND FOR OTHERS IN NEED OF WELFARE SERVICES.<br />
IN THE CASE OF THE OLD, WE HAVE RECENTLY ANNOUNCED THE BIGGEST<br />
PENSION INCREASE EVER GIVEN TO PENSIONERS. WE HAVE<br />
SUBSTANTIALLY IMPROVED COMMONWEALTH ASSISTANCE FOR A WIDE RANGE<br />
OF SERVICES FOR THE AGFn. ' ICH AS AGFn PERSONS HOUSING A<br />
DOMICILIARY CARE AND SENIOR CITIZENS CENTRES. FOR THE YOUNG<br />
WE HAVE. INTRODUCED A NEW CHARTER FOR THEIR EDUCATION. WE HAVE<br />
ALMOST DOUBLED COMMONWEALTH EXPENDITURE ON EDUCATION; WE HAVE<br />
ESTABLISHED A PERMANENT SCHOOLS COMMISSION TO GIVE AID TO ALL<br />
SCHOOLS, WITHOUT DISTINCTION, ON A ' NEEDS' BASIS; WE HAVE<br />
ASSUMED FULL FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITY FOk IERTIARY EDUCATION,<br />
AND HAVE ABOLISHED FEES; FOR THE FIRST TIME WE ARE GIVING<br />
ASSISTANCE TO TEACHERS' COLLEGES AND PRE-SCHOOL TEACHERS'<br />
COLLEGES ON THE SAME BASIS AS UNIVERSITIES AND COLLFGES OF<br />
ADVANCED EDUCATION; WE ARE GIVING MUCH MOF GiF'ROUS AI. OWANCES<br />
TO STUDENTS AND HAVE MORE THAN TREBLED THE NUM1BER OF TEA-HINC,<br />
SCHOLARSHIPS. </p>
<p>-6-<br />
6. THE GOVERNMENT RECOGNISES THAT MORE NEEDS TO BE DONE TO<br />
HELP THE DISADVANTAGED, THE GOVERNOR-GENERAL, IN HIS SPEECH<br />
AT THE OPENING OF THE PARLIAMENT ON 9 JULY, SAID THE<br />
GOVERNMENT WOULD PROVIDE " FOR INCREASED ASSISTANCE FOR THE<br />
HANDICAPPED AND DISABLED, FURTHER ASSISTANCE FOR ORGANISATIONS<br />
CONDUCTING AGED PERSONS' HOMES AND NURSING HOMES AND HELP FOR<br />
THE HOMELESS,"<br />
