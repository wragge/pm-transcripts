  I welcome the announcement that agreement has been reached on a peace</p>
<p> settlement for Northern Ireland.</p>
<p>This historic achievement holds out the prospect for an end to the</p>
<p> bitter sectarian strife which has divided and afflicted the people</p>
<p> of Northern Ireland for so many decades.</p>
<p>I congratulate the two Prime Ministers, Mr Blair and Mr Ahern, and</p>
<p> the chairman of the peace talks, Mr George Mitchell, for their vision</p>
<p> and determination in encouraging the parties to make the compromises</p>
<p> necessary to reach a principled and fair outcome.</p>
<p>The Australian government urges all the parties and the people of</p>
<p> Northern Ireland and Ireland to seize this opportunity to ensure a</p>
<p> just and lasting settlement, to put behind them the years of violence</p>
<p> and despair and to build a future of peace and tolerance for their</p>
<p> children.</p>
<p> 11 April 1998</p>
