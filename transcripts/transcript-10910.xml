    <content><![CDATA[<p>E&amp;OE..........................................................................................................................</p>
<p>Thank you, thank you very much Bob Baldwin. To the Administrator,</p>
<p> Mr Ron Eagle, to Senator John Tierney, Mr Peter Blackmore, other distinguished</p>
<p> guests, ladies and gentlemen. And certainly, most importantly of all,</p>
<p> the people of the Hunter Valley.</p>
<p>I am delighted to have this first opportunity as Prime Minister to</p>
<p> be at the Maitland Town Hall. I thank the Administrator and the people</p>
<p> of Maitland for the civic reception that you have honoured me with</p>
<p> today. I regard gatherings, such as this, as being the ultimate in</p>
<p> grass roots politics. It is the ultimate way in which a Prime Minister,</p>
<p> or any senior figure in political life in Australia, can meet a cross-section</p>
<p> of the community, can meet men and women in business, the people who</p>
<p> run the hospitals, the people who run the caring charities, the people</p>
<p> who work on the land, the people who are retired citizens, the people</p>
<p> who run the ambulance service, the people who run the fire service</p>
<p> and the police service. All of those groups in the community come</p>
<p> together on an occasion like this, and it is a great reminder to me</p>
<p> as Prime Minister, of the tremendous community spirit which binds</p>
<p> the Australian nation together.</p>
<p>I am also delighted to be in the electorate of Paterson which my friend</p>
<p> and colleague, Bob Baldwin, has held in the Federal Parliament since</p>
<p> March of 1996. Although this is certainly not an overt political occasion,</p>
<p> it's a civic gathering, I don't think I'll be offending</p>
<p> any sensitivities to say very emphatically that Bob Baldwin has been</p>
<p> an outstandingly active and energetic representative for the electorate</p>
<p> of Paterson.</p>
<p>He's a consistent advocate of Paterson's causes, he persistently</p>
<p> lobbies for the interest of the people of Paterson and he has persistently</p>
<p> lobbied me on a number of issues which have been of particular concern</p>
<p> to people in his electorate. Because it is a very diverse area and</p>
<p> as the Administrator said in his introductory remarks, we've</p>
<p> had the opportunity since some of the unfortunate events which overtook</p>
<p> the city of Newcastle and the Hunter Region generally. We've</p>
<p> had the opportunity of seeing how different sections of the Australian</p>
<p> community can work together in a time of difficulty. Nobody welcomes</p>
<p> the decision that was taken by BHP. The important thing though was</p>
<p> that the city and the area didn't look back. They didn't</p>
<p> wallow in self pity, they looked for new alternatives and new hopes</p>
<p> and new opportunities. And to a cooperative effort involving the Federal</p>
<p> Government, the State Government, the Newcastle City Council, the</p>
<p> business interest of the city and the region, the representatives</p>
<p> of the trade union movement and also the representatives of the business</p>
<p> community it was possible, amongst other things, to put together a</p>
<p> Prime Minister's task force for dealing with the problems thrown</p>
<p> up by the BHP announcement on Newcastle. And interestingly enough,</p>
<p> that task force was jointly chaired by a former BHP official and the</p>
<p> then Secretary of the Newcastle branch of the Australian Workers'</p>
<p> Union. And at all stages in my contact with that group and with the</p>
<p> people of the district following those events in Newcastle, there's</p>
<p> been a total absence of politics and there's been a total commitment</p>
<p> on the part of everybody to try and come up with sensible solutions</p>
<p> for the future of the region.</p>
<p>And can I take the opportunity of saying here today that a few months</p>
<p> ago my Government committed millions of dollars to support the establishment</p>
<p> of the Redbank Power Station and that project, if it can go ahead,</p>
<p> will generate 1,000 jobs in the construction phase and several hundred</p>
<p> additional jobs over and above the construction phase. And it is being</p>
<p> held up at the moment because Energy Australia won't connect</p>
<p> the power station to the New South Wales electricity grid and I do</p>
<p> hope that the owner of Energy Australia, which is the New South Wales</p>
<p> Government, will exercise the rights and powers of ownership and ensure</p>
<p> that Energy Australia does what is necessary to get that project going.</p>
<p> My Government has committed millions of dollars to it. My Government</p>
<p> wants the jobs that it will generate. We now need the electricity</p>
<p> generated in order to get the project going and I hope that the common</p>
<p> sense that that situation commends itself to the New South Wales Government</p>
<p> over the weeks and the months ahead, and I think it's very important,</p>
<p> when there is a legitimate interest in the creation of new jobs in</p>
<p> this region, I think it's only important that every effort be</p>
<p> made, every effort be taken, every opportunity seized to support a</p>
<p> project that will generate new jobs.</p>
<p>The Hunter Valley has a tremendous sense of community spirit as the</p>
<p> Administrator and Bob have both said, I am no stranger to this part</p>
<p> of the world. My wife has very long family connections, not only with</p>
<p> Newcastle, but also with Singleton. And my family have holidayed in</p>
<p> this part of the world for close on 20 years, and we do it because</p>
<p> it is a very pleasant place to come to. We've grown very fond</p>
<p> of the area, it brings together an extraordinary cross-section of</p>
<p> the Australian community, and it does represent the coastal areas</p>
<p> of Australia. It does, of course, in Newcastle contain one of the</p>
<p> oldest and the best known of the industrial centres of Australia.</p>
<p> It does, of course, in the wine growing area manifest one of the great</p>
<p> burgeoning export industries of this country and it does, of course,</p>
<p> contain many very attractive rural parts of Australia.</p>
<p>And this morning at Tocal I had the opportunity of sampling the delights</p>
<p> of that beautiful college which is the most respected agricultural</p>
<p> college in Australia. And the New South Wales Department of Agriculture</p>
<p> is doing a splendid job in administering that college for the Alexandra</p>
<p> Trust and about 400 or 500 young Australians a year pass through that</p>
<p> college. And what it does is to bring together all that is good about</p>
<p> Australia's agricultural past, but at the same time impart to</p>
<p> those who pass through the college modern, contemporary understanding</p>
<p> of the demands of farming and agricultural life.</p>
<p>Agriculture is still a very important part of the fabric of the Australian</p>
<p> nation. It is not only the rural way of life that's important</p>
<p> but the export income that we earn from farmers is tremendously important.</p>
<p> Without that export income, the people who live in the cities of Australia</p>
<p> would be a lot worse off. Without that export income, which is often</p>
<p> not as great as the effort of the farmers who generate the income</p>
<p> deserved, without that income Australia would be a much poorer nation.</p>
<p>And I want to take the opportunity as I have on other occasions when</p>
<p> I've visited non-metropolitan areas of Australia, to say that</p>
<p> one of the greatest and continuing goals of my Government is to ensure</p>
<p> that our rural producers receive a fairer go on international markets.</p>
<p> Now that means, not only tough negotiating in the world trade fora,</p>
<p> like people like Tim Fischer and John Anderson, but it also means</p>
<p> that we have a taxation system that encourages exporters. It also</p>
<p> means that we have an efficient, productive waterfront. It also means</p>
<p> that we have low inflation and low interest rates. And I am very happy</p>
<p> to say that although many areas of rural Australia have been gripped</p>
<p> by drought in recent years, and some continue to be gripped by drought,</p>
<p> and I saw them myself first hand despite the deceptive appearance</p>
<p> of some green on the top, that there is still a lot of drought affliction</p>
<p> in this part of the world. But despite those setbacks there have been</p>
<p> some good pieces of news for rural Australia in recent times.</p>
<p>To start with, we are making a huge commitment to landcare and bushcare</p>
<p> through the Natural Heritage Trust of Australia. The Natural Heritage</p>
<p> Trust of Australia will spend $1.25 billion on capital projects designed</p>
<p> to repair Australia's environment. And these projects, and I</p>
<p> made some announcements yesterday in Far North Queensland, will include</p>
<p> some further investments in relation to river systems in both the</p>
<p> Hunter area and also the northern part of New South Wales. But the</p>
<p> great advantage of the Natural Heritage Trust is that we are going</p>
<p> to spend the money on practical environmental challenges. We are spending</p>
<p> a lot of money on cleaning up the Murray Darling Basin which is the</p>
<p> underpinning of a large part of Australia's agricultural base.</p>
<p> We are spending a lot of money on tackling the horrific salinity problems</p>
<p> in Western Australia. And you only have to fly over Western Australia</p>
<p> to get an idea of how difficult the salinity problem is. We are spending</p>
<p> money on landcare. There are now 4,000 landcare groups in Australia.</p>
<p> I went to the Annual Presentation of the Prime Minister's Landcare</p>
<p> awards in Canberra a few weeks ago and it was a marvellous reminder</p>
<p> to me of a cooperative effort between farmers, environmentalists,</p>
<p> townspeople, everybody who is interested and comes together with a</p>
<p> common cause of preserving and re-enriching the soil and the land</p>
<p> of Australia. So this Natural Heritage Trust is not going to be spent</p>
<p> on what I might call high-profile politically correct, peripheral</p>
<p> environmental issues. It is going to be spent on grass roots, down</p>
<p> to earth, ongoing, far sided environmental regeneration. Cleaning</p>
<p> up our rivers, preventing ocean outfalls, removing salinity, caring</p>
<p> for the land, caring for bush. All of those things are the way in</p>
<p> which we can make a lasting contribution to the rehabilitation and</p>
<p> the regeneration of the Australian environment.</p>
<p>The other thing that I am happy to say has come the way of the bush</p>
<p> and come the way of small business over the last few months is, of</p>
<p> course, that as a result of the policies we've followed. We've</p>
<p> seen a very significant fall in interest rates. And I have been travelling</p>
<p> around rural Australia and regional Australia for a long time now</p>
<p> in various disguises, and the last couple of years I've been</p>
<p> touring around as Prime Minister and in the last few months I am happy</p>
<p> to say for the first time I am able to look at rural people, I am</p>
<p> able to look small business men and women in regional towns in the</p>
<p> face and say: your interest rates are coming down. Because for so</p>
<p> long our interest rates have been at Himalayan levels. Only a few</p>
<p> years ago we had interest rates at 17, 18, 19, 20 per cent and we</p>
<p> now, as a result of the announcements made by the Commonwealth and</p>
<p> Westpac, and I apologise for the representative of any other bank</p>
<p> present for mentioning those two, but they happen to be the ones that</p>
<p> have made the announcements. As a result of that we are now looking</p>
<p> forward to a situation where on an overdraft of $100,000 you can achieve</p>
<p> an interest rate reduction of about $4,000 a year because those banks</p>
<p> have announced packages that will have their base lending rates at</p>
<p> about seven and a quarter per cent.</p>
<p>And when you compare that with the levels obtained only a few years</p>
<p> ago it is indeed extremely good news. And that is something that is</p>
<p> unalterably one of the best pieces of news that farmers and small</p>
<p> business people can have because the burden, the crushing burden of</p>
<p> high interest rates has been the most perennial, repeated, constant</p>
<p> complaint which has been made to me over the last 10 or 15 years when</p>
<p> I have been to many a civic reception, been to many a homestead, been</p>
<p> to many a small business in many a main street of many a country town</p>
<p> in Australia. And the constant complaint I've had more than anything</p>
<p> else is the level of interest rates, and at long last we are starting</p>
<p> to see the breaking of that particular drought and we hope, of course,</p>
<p> that the breaking of some other natural drought will come very, very</p>
<p> freely and very, very soon to those parts of Australia that need it</p>
<p> very badly.</p>
<p>I am often asked ladies and gentlemen what is the best thing about</p>
<p> being the Prime Minister of Australia, and the best thing without</p>
<p> question about being the Prime Minister of Australia is the opportunity</p>
<p> to come to gatherings like this to meet so many different parts of</p>
<p> the Australian community, to be reminded as I have today of the enormous</p>
<p> part of our heritage which is owed to the rural community. To speak</p>
<p> to people who's families for generations have owned land, who</p>
<p> for generations have been rural people. To have the opportunity of</p>
<p> meeting people who have made this country their home from Europe or</p>
<p> from Asia. To meet, as I have at this civic reception, people from</p>
<p> countries as far apart as Thailand and Greece and Italy. To have the</p>
<p> opportunity of being reminded of the contribution to the Australian</p>
<p> culture of the 1990s of our Indigenous heritage and to understand</p>
<p> that respecting everybody's right to fully identify according</p>
<p> to their own culture is part of the modern Australia and is part of</p>
<p> what it is to be an Australian in the 1990s.</p>
<p>So visiting gatherings such as this, having the opportunity of getting</p>
<p> out of Sydney, Melbourne and Canberra, not that I have anything against</p>
<p> any of the people who live in those wonderful areas having myself</p>
<p> grown up and spent all my life in Sydney, it is part of the tonic,</p>
<p> the regeneration, I suppose of the political being to meet so many</p>
<p> people and to understand and to listen a little more and perhaps understand</p>
<p> and realise a little better some of the particular challenges that</p>
<p> you have in these parts of Australia.</p>
<p>I want to thank all of you for the contribution that you make to your</p>
<p> community. I want to salute again the great Australian volunteer spirit.</p>
<p> We are one of the great volunteer nations of the world. We are a nation</p>
<p> that better than most have grasped the fact that Governments can't</p>
<p> do it on their own. Individuals can't do it on their own and</p>
<p> community groups like the churches and the great charitable organisations</p>
<p> can't do it on their own either. But we can only build the kind</p>
<p> of society we all want, a good and a fair society, a good, fair and</p>
<p> strong society as we move towards the 21st Century if we enlist the</p>
<p> cooperation of the Government, the community groups and the individual,</p>
<p> with each playing their own part. Recognising that when people need</p>
<p> help, they should be helped but in accordance with the principle of</p>
<p> mutual obligation, if we help people who can afford to give something</p>
<p> back to the community in return for that assistance then that is not</p>
<p> unreasonable to ask for. And that principle of mutual obligation underpins</p>
<p> our approach to such projects as the work for the dole.</p>
<p>But ladies and gentlemen, I thank you very warmly for the civic reception</p>
<p> that has been tended to me by the Administrator and by the people</p>
<p> of the city of Maitland. I wish you all well, I thank you for the</p>
<p> contribution that you are making to our country, to your community</p>
<p> and it's been a great delight to have been amongst you today.</p>
<p> Thank you.</p>
