    <content><![CDATA[<p>Today I completed Australia's ratification of the International Tropical Timber Agreement (ITTA), a key UN treaty for sustainable management of tropical timber.</p>
<p>The ITTA is the principal global agreement designed to achieve the sustainable management of tropical forests.</p>
<p>The ratification of this agreement is also vital in our effort to mitigate climate change, with mechanisms to reduce greenhouse emissions by eliminating unsustainable forest practices.</p>
<p>With 47 per cent of the global forest estate in tropical regions, Australia has significant interests in the sustainable management of these forests.</p>
<p>Within International Tropical Timber Organisation member countries only 4.5 per cent of tropical forests are currently being sustainably managed, according to the definition used by the Organisation.</p>
<p>Good forest management is critical to tackling climate change, as deforestation contributes 20 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
<p>The completion of the ratification of the ITTA will mean Australia is better positioned to play a leadership role in combating illegal logging activities, and working in partnership with the international community to ensure that forests around the world are properly managed.</p>
<p>The ITTA enables Australia to continue to extend our expertise in forest management to neighbouring countries, through greater collaboration on forest law enforcement and governance.</p>
<p>This year Australia signed forest carbon partnership agreements with Indonesia and Papua New Guinea.</p>
<p>Ratification of this agreement reinforces Australia's other initiatives in forest management, such as Australian objectives to assist Asia-Pacific countries build capacity to sustainably manage their forests.</p>
