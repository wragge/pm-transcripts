PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF NEWS CONFERENCE SHERATON HOTELP DRISBANK<br />
9 MARCH 1990<br />
A 05 PROOF ONLY<br />
JO~ MALST Wr Hawkesp do you endorse the comments made<br />
by Mr Kelty the other day calling for workers to<br />
retalliate by displaying hatred to the coalition and<br />
employes?<br />
PK: Hatred is not, as I think you probably know from my<br />
background, something which is part of my makeup. I<br />
don't like the concept of hatred and I attempt not to<br />
practice it. I understand what Kr xiety van saying, he<br />
was relating the present proposdd policies of the<br />
Opposition to what has happend in the past. He<br />
recognise. so that it in the workers of Autralia and their<br />
tamlies# those dependant upon them, who ' ye paid a heavy<br />
price in the past, Paul. And what Kr Keity fear. and<br />
properly fears in a revisiting upon the ordinary people<br />
of Australia of the tragedy of the past. I don't want to<br />
take a great deal of time in revisiting the statistics<br />
upon you but they are ver firmly in your mind as to what<br />
happened when those polices were imposed before. The<br />
worst recession in the 50 years and that meant in the 12<br />
months before we came to office another quarter of a<br />
million Australians thrown out on to the unemployment<br />
bcrapheap. And Kr iKelty knows from excpeience, he also<br />
knows from the fact that hes spent so much of his time<br />
in the last two years knocking back wage increases that<br />
employers have wanted to imnpose because he knows that<br />
that would destroy the economy. so he's saying the<br />
sufferers from the policies, industrial relations wages<br />
policiets, of the opposition would be ordinary working men<br />
and wn and their kids. And he says that in hateful.-<br />
Now I wouldn't ask the workers of this country to indulge<br />
in hatred because it is not part of my makeup and I don't<br />
think it real. ly is part of Mr Kelty's, but I think he is<br />
asking them to detest those policies and what they must<br />
mean JOUPJIALITz will you talk to him and ask him to tone<br />
down his language?<br />
PK2 I don't know about asking his to tone down his<br />
language. If I had any discussion with him, quite </p>
<p>any rate, that I have a different view of langage On<br />
this issue, but I totally understand the concern that he<br />
has and I totally understand, Paul, the concern that<br />
Australian workers ought to have.<br />
JOURNALIST&amp;. Prime Minister, on the child care<br />
PM: Sol I think that's not accurate because, firstly if<br />
you take those, that part of the assessment that deals<br />
with the word as co-operation vith the States, they have<br />
up to this point co-operated and I have no reason to<br />
assume that they would not. We have had no indication<br />
that they wouldn't co-operate in the future an they have<br />
in the past. And let ne SKy I'm sure that the Labor<br />
Premier. would have commitment to cooperation in this<br />
regard and It would be very strange if I&amp; r Greinier should<br />
not. Kr Greiner has been remarkably silento I must say,<br />
in regard to what it means for NWW if his Federal<br />
colleagues were to come in it would mean $ 120X of<br />
funds to NOW. There is no doubt that from the point of<br />
view of SS8W which side their bread is buttered on as far<br />
as this election is concerned. On the 28,000, all I can<br />
say is that those are the best estimates of what the<br />
response would be given the significant increase in<br />
effective demand which is associated with our policies.<br />
What you have got to understand in that in term of the<br />
supply of places it is a function in part of the level of<br />
effective demand. And what we are doing in the area of<br />
improved fee relief, which is very substantial and which<br />
I think You don't question, will mean that there will be<br />
a significant increase in effective demd. And that's#<br />
all I am say, in the best estimate made by responsible<br />
people on the sort of response there will be.<br />
JOURNALIST: Xr Hawks, operational subsidies your<br />
package, do you guarantee now to maintain at the<br />
level they are at the moment?<br />
PH: Vll, the proposals that have been drawn up have<br />
been drawn up on the basis of continuation of the<br />
existing arrangements.<br />
JOURNALIST: Does that mean they will continue for the<br />
@@ a<br />
PM: That is the position that has been put, but the<br />
costing. that have been arrived at have been clearly put,<br />
they come to the best part of some 400 million and the<br />
basis of operation in the future will, as I understand<br />
it, be on the smem situation as it has been in the past.<br />
JOURNALIST: Mr Hawke, the Labor policy previously has<br />
not beew in support of commercial centres, why do you<br />
change and do you think In retrospect that that policy<br />
was wrong?<br />
PH: Wlle I think we needed to concentrate our resources<br />
in the first Instance on increasing the support for </p>
<p>community-based care, but then as we have gone on and we<br />
have done that, and remember what these sort of figures<br />
are, we will under the additions we have already been<br />
made and under the committed program in ' 92 as t is<br />
there'll be a more than trebling of those places. On the<br />
analysis which has now been undertaken it seems<br />
appropriate that assistance should also be given in the<br />
commroial sector and this is now a well-rounded program<br />
with a very very significant increase in expenditure on<br />
the part of the Commonwealth. We'd certainly justify the<br />
description that I have made, that this has been the<br />
greatest expansion in child care facilities in the<br />
history of this country. Let ae make the point that this<br />
was an agreed position. There has been some attempt to<br />
suggest that there may have been some basic division<br />
amongst my Ministers but let me say that this is a<br />
rounded and balanced approach which has met with the<br />
approval of the Cabinet as a whole.<br />
JOURNALIST: But do you concede it's a major shift in<br />
S policy area?<br />
PMl Well, it is a development, it is a development in<br />
policy. If we operated on the basis that we would have<br />
exactly the same policy stance in year 10 of this<br />
Government, in the fourth Government, as we had in year<br />
one it would be a very peculiar sort of Government. You<br />
deal with the first immediate priorities and then you<br />
expand your program. I mean, for instance, let's look at<br />
the broader thrust of macro-economic policy. It was<br />
appropriate, as soon as we came to Government, to give<br />
the economy a and then you have the, that is by<br />
Government's policy in its decisions, because you had as<br />
I say the worst recession in 50 years. It was<br />
appropriate in those circumstances to give the economy a<br />
lift. But as the economy got going we then moved in to<br />
very substantial cut-backs in real terms in Government<br />
outlays. Now that is the mark of intelligent and sound<br />
government, that you develop your policies according to<br />
the needs and the developing needs of the society. Now<br />
in regard to child care we committed ourselves at the<br />
beginning for using relatively limited resources,<br />
expansion in the community-based centres and now we<br />
believe that with a combination of our additional<br />
expenditures there and the to effective demand that<br />
was associated with fee relief that there will also be an<br />
expansion of places in the commercial sector.<br />
JOURNALIST: ( inaudible)<br />
PN: I think that there is a sufficient flexibility in,<br />
both in the platform and in the attitudes of the Party,<br />
to enable this to be done. I think it will be welcomed<br />
generally within the Party and within the community.<br />
JOURIALIST: Prime Minister, how do you respond to<br />
criticism this morning that the policy speech </p>
<p>PM: I must say that I was anuaed by those observations,<br />
Peter, amused beoause for reasons best known to the<br />
coentators who have mad those observations, they seea<br />
to think that the Prime Minister and his Ministers have<br />
only exposed the Government's proposed policies for the<br />
next tern yesterday here in my policy speech. They<br />
conveniently overlooked two things. Firstly, that on 22<br />
February I delivered in Sydney a most detailed set of<br />
proposals for micro-economic reform in the fourth term.<br />
Now for some of these oommentators we may as well not<br />
have spoken, we may as well not have delivered that<br />
address. The program for nicro-economic reform for the<br />
fourth term wasn't delivered because I didn't do it<br />
yesterday. I mean, what short memories some people have.<br />
And let as make the point about that delivery on 22<br />
February, two points. Firstly, I put it against the<br />
background of the still unanswered challenge, and I<br />
repeat it, I am still waiting to hear from Mr Peacock or<br />
any spokesperson for the Conservatives, an answer to the<br />
challenge I made in Deceaber at the National Press Club<br />
and repated elsewhere, where I said that there has been<br />
no period in Australia's peacetime history to match, to<br />
come within a bull's roar of the record of massive microeconomic<br />
reform that has been initiated under my<br />
Governmnt. And we still have a thundering silence from<br />
the conservatives to that challenge. Answer, why,<br />
because they know it is impossible to answer. In the<br />
of the 33 years since ' 49 when I caae to office, for<br />
of those 33 years of Conservatives were in office. They<br />
did nothing in terms of aicro-economic reform of any<br />
significance. And in seven years we have very<br />
significantly turned round the structure, the attitudes<br />
in the institutions of this country, but we have not been<br />
satisfied in this election campaign to rest upon that<br />
performance, a performance unMatched in the 30 years of<br />
Conservative Government. As I say, on 22 February I laid<br />
down the ten point program. I remind you of it, it went<br />
to aviation, telecommunications, industry policy,<br />
shipping, the waterfront, electricity generation,<br />
railways, export of services, international trade,<br />
education and the labour market. Nov each one of those<br />
areas detailed our program and our policies for the next<br />
tera. Now secondly, in answer to the question that was<br />
22nd February in regards to macro-economic policy it<br />
was quite clearly laid down by my friend and colleague,<br />
Paul leating, in his statement at the beginning of the<br />
campaign where he laid out our wages, tax, superannuation<br />
proposals for the fourth term. There you had a<br />
continuation of the basic macro-economic framework of the<br />
past. And what has that produced? You know what it has<br />
produced. It has produced a 12.2% reduction in real nonfara<br />
unit labour costs, it has produced a rate, an<br />
average annual rate of employment growth of 3.5% which is<br />
precisely five times the 0.7% employment growth of our<br />
predecessors. It has given an indication of the<br />
continuation of our fiscal responsibility which has seen<br />
as I have said a $ 30 billion turnaround in demand by the<br />
public sector upon the resources of the community, and<br />
I </p>
<p>importantly, importantly, particularly for those<br />
cc~ mntaorswho nothing, Xr ] iawke said nothing<br />
yesterday about our debt probim. Importantly it laid<br />
out the superannuation pol icy for the future, a policy<br />
Which is going to mean a direct attack upon the question<br />
of mavings, a reduction of reliance on overseas eband<br />
a policy which is directly relevant to dealing with the<br />
probls of inflation. So that in what I may to those<br />
woC say Mr Hawks yesterday didn't deal with the problems<br />
of mioro-econonic refoarm and macro-econanic policy. For<br />
God's, maer let the analysts and the commentators just<br />
4remember that there isn,' t only one day of the campaign<br />
an good a day as it warn.<br />
JOG3ALI! PzJust on that 22 February speeche Mr Hawks<br />
MI: Yes.<br />
JOURNALIST: *. the major criticism the Governmen<br />
made by* economic adjustment in the next term if the<br />
Governments re-elected compared to the last term.* Can<br />
you say whether the pace of adjustment in the next team<br />
will be the ameo, faster or slower?<br />
IN: I think it would be faster, I say it Paul not<br />
because it's the easy answer and perhaps the me~ t<br />
convenient and the most politically advantageous. But<br />
there is a simple truth about change and that is it's the<br />
hardest thing about change is the first step, to get<br />
people to face up to the realities of a new, more<br />
challenging environment.* Of course, let me for instance<br />
give you an example of that Paul.' I can recall that<br />
when, in the earlier parts of our Government, we started<br />
to talkC about the need for award restructuring. There<br />
VUS enormous hesitation. Indeed I think it dosen' 4t<br />
overetate the came to say antagonism in certain areas of<br />
the trade union movement. And it took us a good deal of<br />
time because we believe in consultation and not<br />
confrontation to get the concept accepted in the trade<br />
union movemt, that if they were really going to<br />
discharge their obligations to their members they had to<br />
bree predtodiscard outdated work practices and<br />
attitue= s trganisation in the workplace. That took<br />
time. But now those processes, as you know, are strongly<br />
underway, and indeed, if I had to nominate one of the<br />
sources Of excitement of the Prime Ministership, it has<br />
been now for instance to go into wrklacesn and one the<br />
enthusiasm with which workes and their organisations are<br />
embracing these changes. To be precise, one of the most<br />
exciting experience. I've had in the last few months is<br />
to gio into the steelworkcs in Newcatle and to have<br />
management confessing its sins of the past and workers<br />
doing it. Management saying to Me, the exact phrase that<br />
management used to me, You know Mr Hawke, until. these<br />
changes cam. about under your ovurnment, our attitude<br />
warn that we asked workers to leave their brains at the<br />
gate. He said that was absurd. And unionists were there<br />
working with management saying we've got to change these </p>
<p>practices, we've got to do ths more effectively. SO<br />
that's the reason Paul why 1 that it'. a going to be<br />
faster in these next three years becaus e vs have Overcome<br />
to much a onsiderable extent soeof the attitudinial<br />
barriers of change.<br />
-JOURN&amp; IAIW$ VT utt how can you be so confident,<br />
prtcuIlarly about award restructuring when, this morn ing<br />
IN: Year love read it.<br />
JOALIS~ s The Netal Trades Federation<br />
PH: I could, it we had time and I know we haven't, I<br />
could take you Paul -and you would be amongst them I<br />
could take you to the doommaying statements of the last<br />
seVen years. The Accord was dead, the whole thing was<br />
going to blow up. I could give you a list including<br />
se by Paul Kel, sateet We'd need a pole vault<br />
to get over the pile of what was going to happen to the<br />
Accord. N ow many times ha. the Accord been dead..., the<br />
burial services conducted with appropriate solemnity by<br />
the oa eru in the media. But let me say this. The<br />
Accord in vibrantly alive, well and operating. it<br />
Operates in an env ironment of people who are going to try<br />
and doc the best they can for the people. They will make<br />
threats, they ' 11 make statements, but I'll tell you this,<br />
the Accord wvill live. it's again going to survive the<br />
doomsaYers. I believe that the discussions will go on in<br />
the days ahead and Itu confident that the Accord In<br />
general and in the metal trades in particular will<br />
Survive. You know, I'm a, I'm a punter I haven't got<br />
much time to do it -but could I give you this advice.<br />
When you're punting, it's a good idea to look at the form<br />
of the runners and &amp; lno, if you're inclined to take<br />
account of tipsters, to have a look at their record too.<br />
And I'll tell you what in the race that's on for<br />
Australia's future, the horse called the Accord has got<br />
an outstanding record of achievement. I've told you<br />
about it in part but let me just add a bit to it. Rate<br />
Of employment growth five time faster than before: a<br />
reduction in the level of industrial disputes; business<br />
intvestment, the highest level on recordl profits the<br />
profit shAe picked up from the 11.2% in ' 82 to the<br />
highest points on record. go the horse called the Accord<br />
has got good form and the tipsers who've tipped against<br />
the Accord have done their dough.<br />
JOWRNALIST: ( inaudible)<br />
PH: I don't think it will be necessary for ae to get<br />
invo3lved. It May be that I would have a discussion with<br />
Ur Kelty if You know, if love got the tim. it may<br />
happen. If I regarded it as desirable or necessary I<br />
would do it. Because one of the great things, one of the<br />
great features about th~ is Government of course has been<br />
that we treat the representatives Of working men and </p>
<p>wamen in this country as people who should be talked with<br />
and not confronted. And if I believed that it was<br />
helpful to have a discussion, if I thought that things<br />
were going a bit off the rails, I'd be prepared to do it.<br />
JOURNALIST: no frills launch Andrew Peacock?<br />
PH: Well, I mean what I say when I have said from the<br />
beginning and indeed really before we got into this<br />
election campaign that I regard it as the most important<br />
electionl sine 1949. It's not rhetoric. I deeply<br />
believe it because I think it will shape the sort of<br />
country that we take into the 21st century. And<br />
believing that and the seriousness of this matter I, with<br />
my colleagues,, felt that we should have a very serious<br />
launch.* The introduction, were not extriagentg but I<br />
think they were appropriate, a magnificent singing of the<br />
national anthem by Claire and two introductions by the<br />
Sheffield Shield contenders and then the speech. Now it<br />
seemed to me that that warn the appropriate way of doing<br />
it. It will be for the people to judge, Bob, as to<br />
whether they want more razzamataz But I believe that in<br />
that simple uncomplicated presentation I was best able to<br />
put before the people of Australia the starkness of the<br />
choice they've got to make. I wouldn't have wanted to do<br />
it any other way.<br />
JOURNALIST: ( inaudible)<br />
PM: In regard to the first question I have got an<br />
idea but I don't think it's fair to all my colleagues to<br />
start flagging who would take Lionel Bowen's position.<br />
Let me simply say that it will be filled by a person of<br />
competence and commitment and proven track record.* Nov<br />
you can all start guessing.<br />
JOURNALIST: Nichael Duffy.<br />
PH: But I have no comment. An to the second, I believe<br />
that with the Australian business community that what we<br />
need in a system where businesses wherever they are in<br />
Australia arm going to know what the law is and what the<br />
practices are. I personally would prefer a situation<br />
where the, if there in Constitutional doubt that all the<br />
States would the relevant powers to the Commonwealth.<br />
And this in obviously an area we've got to have some<br />
serious of discussions vith the States. But it just<br />
se ems; to so that we do pay a fairly high price in this<br />
country for the fact of federation. I'm not trying to<br />
undo that, that is a fact of life. it does soom to so<br />
that it's fairly intelligent that wherever the facts of<br />
the federal system pose manifest probl s, then if we<br />
politicians are really concerned about the best interests<br />
of the country we could tackle them. For example, that's<br />
what's mtivated se in the area of roads. I mean, that's<br />
why I've tried to use $ 120 million to fix that in the<br />
blackspot program. I've tried to use that as a basis for<br />
getting accession of agreement from the States to uniforn </p>
<p>standards.* That's wh~ we got lamt year the famous Hobart<br />
declaration on eduenyon where, great credit to John<br />
Dawkcins for then initiative and for the State Minister who<br />
responded 1positively It's a very interesting statistic<br />
that,'. buried away in the material which was distributed<br />
yesterdays that some# each year, I think, there's some<br />
70,000 Australian children moved interstate. Now it just<br />
is a tragedy inamy judgmnt that you can have a problem<br />
for all those famlies because of different educational<br />
standards and criteria and curricula in the States. So<br />
that's what we're trying to do in every area.<br />
JOURNALIST: ( inaudible)<br />
PM: I would want that to happen. We obviously had to<br />
look at, in part, at the implications of the Nigh Court<br />
decision and then that goes to one part of the area which<br />
is, am you'll appreciate, the actual process of<br />
incorporation. But I would hope that as soon an we are<br />
re-elected that the new Attorney-General will enter into<br />
O discussions with the relevant ministers of the States to<br />
and see if we can get a mature Australian answer to<br />
JOURNALIST: z ( inaudible)<br />
PK: I don't believe that I run a risk of losing that<br />
because that involves the unstated premise that the<br />
Australian electors are there waiting to be played as a<br />
bunch of suckers. The fundamental truth of this<br />
election, as we now get to the point where we're just<br />
about a fortnight away from polling day, is this, that my<br />
opponents have treated the Australian electorate as<br />
people lacking in intelligence, that they can make a<br />
series of unfunded promises, including in the area that<br />
you're talking about,, about three quarters of a billion<br />
dollars and say we'll give you this# we'll spend this<br />
money, but say nothing, nothing, refuse to answer<br />
questions, dodge your questions as to how they're going<br />
tpay for it. Now if you believe that, and I were to<br />
believe that, then perhaps the people perhaps if I<br />
were that desperate to hold onto office, and my I say to<br />
ruin this country, perhaps I should say wall what was the<br />
their offer? Billion? Yes, . better up that I'll1 make<br />
it because the mugs will buy that, they'll like a<br />
billion unfunded promise better than they'll like the $ 1<br />
billion dollar unfunded promise. And so the difference<br />
is I and my colleagues have a different view of the<br />
Australian electorate. I recognise that roads are an<br />
issue of concern. we've addressed it, but we've<br />
addressed in a funded way. What I = m offering are two<br />
things, two things. The blackipots program which is<br />
already there and in the campaign this additional $ 100<br />
million a year funded and directed to identifiable areas<br />
of need. That', the difference. I an not in this next<br />
fortnight going to change my judgement about the<br />
Australian electorate, because I would need to share the<br />
Judgement of the Liberals. That is that you can make </p>
<p>promise after promise after promise, totalling UP to<br />
something&amp;' like $ 6 billion, unfunded, and that they'll cop<br />
a leader or a potential leader standing in front of theme<br />
when asked by me and by you where'ua the money coming from<br />
Mr Peacock, and say, well I'm not going to tell you. Do<br />
you have a list Mr Peacock of slashing cuts in<br />
ox pen diture in the area of social welfare I don't know,<br />
I haven'Ft thought about it. But I'll have too but I<br />
really haven't thought about it. if you think, like Mr<br />
Peacock, that the Australian electorate will buy that,<br />
ok, I don't. I believe that what the Australimn<br />
electorate is about and what it wants is a Prime Minister<br />
who is going to say yen if there are identified areas of<br />
concern, including roads, what can you do about it, well<br />
I can do a bit more. on to; of what I might say is the<br />
184 real increase in expenditure on roads under my<br />
Government compared with my predecessors $ 335 million a<br />
year more that we've spent a reater proportion of the<br />
oil revenue being spent in this last year then was spent<br />
in their last year 19.6 against 19.5 against 19-06.<br />
We've got the record of doing more but I'm not going to<br />
jump in to this auction based upon some assumption about<br />
the lack of intelligence of the Australian electorate.<br />
Wes not on in regard to roads or anything else. One<br />
more question then i've lot to-<br />
JOURNALIST: ( inaudible)<br />
FX: Well, there was no reason for not mentioning it<br />
other than this.* There was a limit to the amount of time<br />
that I had and I have made it clear, Michelle, in answer<br />
to questions during this campaign that I am still<br />
comitted. to the Treaty,* Now let me take this<br />
opportunity of making the point clear again. I mentioned<br />
the concept of a Treaty fairly early in the last<br />
Parliament and expressed hope that it may com to<br />
fruition. As you know, all of you know, wholve followed<br />
events in the Parliament in the last three years or sa,<br />
the time of my Minister, Gerry Hand, has been<br />
overwhelmingly taken up really with two things. Meeting<br />
the unjustified attacks that have been mado upon him and<br />
his administration and secondly, upon getting the ATSIC<br />
legislation through the House. That has meant that he<br />
hasn't had the time that he would've liked to have had an<br />
this matter. I have discussed the issue with him and we<br />
believe that now ATSIC is in place, or being put in<br />
place, that that is going to provide a basis for now<br />
getting in an organised way the view of the Aboriginal<br />
people around Australia on this question of the Treaty<br />
and also to try and start to get a process of discuss ion<br />
within the non-Aboriginal community. I am still<br />
comitted to the concept of a Treaty and I hope that now<br />
that we have got behind usn, thos. two issues that I<br />
referred to, that we will be able to process it in the<br />
life of this Parli ame nt.<br />
JOURNALIS?: John Cain, Prim Minister, why wasn't he<br />
invited yesterday? </p>
<p>PR. I don't believe he vasn't invited. I think Mr Cain<br />
had his Parliament sitting yesterday. Im not aware that<br />
he wan't invited.<br />
JOURNIALIST:( inaudible)<br />
PH: Mhat a long bow that one in. What a long bow. An<br />
far as the comparison between the Government and the<br />
Opposition if that" s what you're implicitly trying to do,<br />
let me put it this way. Graeme Campbell is no John<br />
Howard.<br />
JOUNNAST. be necessary Ir Havke, how long do you think it will<br />
to hold national standards<br />
