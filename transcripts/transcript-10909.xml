    <content><![CDATA[<p>E&amp;OE................................................................................................</p>
<p>Thank you very much Mr Mayor. To my colleague, Susan Jeanes, ladies</p>
<p>   and gentlemen. Of course, as a very young boy I learnt the word</p>
<p>   ÂOnkaparinga' and as a student at the Sydney University</p>
<p>   law school I came across the word ÂNoarlunga'. It was</p>
<p>   the name of a very well known - in those days - case on the operation</p>
<p>   of Section 92 of the Constitution of the Commonwealth. That of course</p>
<p>   is not directly relevant to my visit here, but the conjunction of</p>
<p>   the two words struck me as interesting.</p>
<p>I enjoy gatherings of this kind which in an informal way bring</p>
<p>   together people who are involved in the hundreds of thousands, indeed,</p>
<p>   millions of local communities around Australia. If you want to get</p>
<p>   a cross-section of Australians, if you want to get a grass roots</p>
<p>   view of what Australians are thinking, whether it be in the cities</p>
<p>   or the provincial centres or in the bush, you get together a gathering</p>
<p>   such as this in an informal fashion, you say a few words and then</p>
<p>   you mingle and talk to people and hear what they have to say. You</p>
<p>   receive quite a lot of advice, you try and answer some questions</p>
<p>   and you try and impart a little wisdom perhaps on some subjects.</p>
<p>   I do want to join the Mayor in complimenting Susan on the very hard</p>
<p>   work that she does for this electorate. </p>
<p>Like so many electorates in Australia it is very diverse. It has</p>
<p>   its pockets of great tranquillity and prosperity and stability.</p>
<p>   It has other areas of difficulty where social challenges for our</p>
<p>   fellow Australians are quite real and I was delighted to hear what</p>
<p>   the Mayor had to say about your success through various things including</p>
<p>   the partnership of which you spoke in reducing the level of youth</p>
<p>   unemployment. As just about has been the case with every period</p>
<p>   of government in recent times in Australia, this country faces at</p>
<p>   present a number of challenges. In many ways our economic foundations</p>
<p>   are stronger now than they have been for a quarter of a century.</p>
<p>   We have withstood the worst impact of the Asian economic downturn</p>
<p>   in a way that has surprised many of our critics and has impressed</p>
<p>   many objective observers.</p>
<p>We have in fact done very well despite Asia having done very badly.</p>
<p>   And the Asian economic downturn shows no sign of ending quickly,</p>
<p>   and it is therefore very important that the steps that have been</p>
<p>   taken to strengthen our economy against the impact of that downturn</p>
<p>   be maintained. Now is not a time to throw away the things that have</p>
<p>   been done over the past two and a bit years to strengthen the Australian</p>
<p>   economy against the worst effects of the Asian economic downturn.</p>
<p>   And equally now is not a time to turn our backs on those further</p>
<p>   economic reforms that are needed in order to further strengthen</p>
<p>   the Australian economy against the impact of the Asian downturn.</p>
<p>And one change and reform that I have very much in mind, of course,</p>
<p>   is reforming Australia's taxation system. There has been a</p>
<p>   lot of talk in recent weeks and months about our plans for reform.</p>
<p>   Those plans will go ahead and they will go ahead because reforming</p>
<p>   the taxation system is the next essential step in order to further</p>
<p>   strengthen the Australian economy against the impact of the Asian</p>
<p>   downturn. If we can replace our existing indirect tax system with</p>
<p>   a better indirect tax system, if we can give Australians relief</p>
<p>   in the personal tax area, if we can build a tax system that encourages</p>
<p>   rather than penalises our exporters then we will do even better</p>
<p>   relative to the countries of the Asia-Pacific region than we have</p>
<p>   done over the last few years.</p>
<p>So my message to you today is that tax reform is the essential</p>
<p>   next step to further strengthen and protect the Australian economy</p>
<p>   against the worst effects of the Asian economic downturn. Now is</p>
<p>   not a time to take fright in relation to that reform, now is not</p>
<p>   a time to turn our back on that. Indeed the challenge of the Asian</p>
<p>   economic downturn adds to the urgency of reforming Australia's</p>
<p>   taxation system.</p>
<p>It won't be a system that Australians will find as revolutionary.</p>
<p>   It will be a logical next reform step and it will deliver to all</p>
<p>   Australians a fairer system, a system where it is harder to cheat</p>
<p>   on your fellow Australians and a system that will give particular</p>
<p>   relief to those with family responsibilities and will pay particular</p>
<p>   regard to the significance to Australia of the rural sector and</p>
<p>   of our export industries.</p>
<p>And I've just enjoyed the hospitality, only at lunchtime today,</p>
<p>   of one of the great export industries of Australia for which of</p>
<p>   course South Australia is famous. And it really is a wonderful success</p>
<p>   story to be told that in 1985 Australia was exporting to the United</p>
<p>   Kingdom 540,000 litres of wine and we're now exporting to the</p>
<p>   United Kingdom 85 million litres of wine. You can't get it</p>
<p>   any better than that and it's been a great example of Australian</p>
<p>   ingenuity, Australian skill, Australian salesmanship, and I was</p>
<p>   very pleased to hear from the people involved in the local industry</p>
<p>   over lunch that the economic climate, the investment climate via</p>
<p>   lower interest rates and low inflation and a generally benign climate</p>
<p>   for investment that that climate is better than those men and women</p>
<p>   in that industry have experienced for a very long period of time.</p>
<p>Good government, my friends, is not only about good economic management.</p>
<p>   It is also about building strong communities, it is about promoting</p>
<p>   and defending the fundamental values of the Australian community.</p>
<p>   And those fundamental values include the great importance that we</p>
<p>   place as a community on family life, the great importance that we</p>
<p>   place as a community on voluntary effort. Australians are renowned</p>
<p>   for their willingness to help each other, particularly in times</p>
<p>   of crisis and distress, and those fundamental values also include</p>
<p>   of course tolerance to each other, a recognition of, and respect</p>
<p>   for, the differences we might have as well as those things that</p>
<p>   we have in common and those similarities that we share as Australians.</p>
<p>This country in the last 40 years has welcomed millions of people</p>
<p>   from all around the world. And Australia has been an object lesson</p>
<p>   to the rest of the world in the harmony and the tolerance and the</p>
<p>   acceptance that we have extended to those people. And one of the</p>
<p>   great strengths of Australia as we move towards the 21st</p>
<p>   century is the way in which our nation has been further built and</p>
<p>   diversified by the injection and the contribution of those millions</p>
<p>   of people who have come from other parts of the world. And it's</p>
<p>   a mark of our civility, it's a mark of our decency and it's</p>
<p>   a mark of our tolerance as a community that we have been able to</p>
<p>   accept and to build out of the blending of those who've come</p>
<p>   and those who were here when they came, a very united, coherent,</p>
<p>   harmonious nation which is, because of its harmony and tranquillity,</p>
<p>   earns not only the envy but also the respect of the rest of the</p>
<p>   world.</p>
<p>Government in this country can only be effective if it works in</p>
<p>   partnership with individuals and with community organisations. We</p>
<p>   all want a fair society, we all want a good society, we all want</p>
<p>   a strong society. The Government can't do it on its on. Individuals</p>
<p>   can not do it on their own, and the great community and welfare</p>
<p>   organisations of our nation can't do it on their own either.</p>
<p>   It is only through a shared endeavour between the Government, the</p>
<p>   individual and community organisations that the sort of goals we</p>
<p>   want for that fair and strong and good society can be achieved.</p>
<p>Today's gathering brings together people involved in that</p>
<p>   shared endeavour here in the electorate of Kingston. It brings together</p>
<p>   people who are committed in the welfare sector, in the local government</p>
<p>   sector, in the business community, your parliamentary representative,</p>
<p>   your Mayor, and on this occasion I have the privilege of being here</p>
<p>   as Prime Minister. And it's that joint shared endeavour which</p>
<p>   is so tremendously important to the future of our country.</p>
<p>So to you, Mr Mayor, thank you very, very warmly for your welcome.</p>
<p>   To you Susan thank you very much for having me, congratulation again</p>
<p>   on the very active role that you play as the Member for this electorate.</p>
<p>   You are not just a faithful echo of what this electorate says, you</p>
<p>   are both somebody who reports on what the electorate says, interprets</p>
<p>   what it feels and someone who presses the cause of this electorate</p>
<p>   in a very fearless and energetic way. And that is how your representatives</p>
<p>   should be, whatever party he or she belongs to and whatever may</p>
<p>   be the particular problems of the electorate.</p>
<p>So ladies and gentleman, thank you most warmly for being here today,</p>
<p>   its been a great privilege to address you for a few moments. Thank</p>
<p>   you.</p>
