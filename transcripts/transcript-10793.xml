    <content><![CDATA[<p>E&amp;OE....................................................</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  It was very clear from Mr Evans' interview this morning that</p>
<p>   we are setting up for a rerun of 1993 when the Labor Party had no</p>
<p>   stomach for tax reform, campaigned against our reform package and</p>
<p>   when it scrambled back into office it introduced a GST of its own</p>
<p>   which was a massive increase in wholesale sales tax without compensation</p>
<p>   for lower income earners.</p>
<p>  Mr Evans and Mr Beazley are adopting the negative frightened approach</p>
<p>   to reforming Australia's taxation system. They have no stomach</p>
<p>   for tax reform, and Gareth Evans gave the game away this morning</p>
<p>   when he admitted some wholesale sales taxes could rise under a Labor</p>
<p>   Government, and that is exactly what happened in 1993.</p>
<p>  Australia badly needs a new tax system. The present one is unfair,</p>
<p>   it's broken, it's ailing and it needs to be renovated,</p>
<p>   and only the Coalition has the stomach to do that. Labor clearly</p>
<p>   does not.</p>
<p>  JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>  Is that all you are expecting of Labor, a negative campaign?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  I think the Labor Party will run a negative, backward-looking, frightened</p>
<p>   campaign. They will try and frighten people. They will pretend that</p>
<p>   you can tinker with Bandaid solutions to a system that is badly</p>
<p>   ailing and in need of fundamental renovation. They don't have</p>
<p>   any stomach for reform. For the good of Australia, we need a better</p>
<p>   taxation system. And that is why the Coalition will pursue it.</p>
<p>  JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>  When will you be releasing the policy?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  We will be releasing it quite soon. The work is very well advanced.</p>
<p>   But there are a few more details to be completed. We're pursuing</p>
<p>   tax reform because we think it's good for Australia. We are</p>
<p>   pursuing tax reform because the present system is ailing and unfair,</p>
<p>   and we're pursuing taxation reform because it will make a more</p>
<p>   competitive Australia. It is for the good of Australia and for no</p>
<p>   other reason we are pursuing taxation reform.</p>
<p>  JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>  Is it going to be for the good of low income earners?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Low income earners will benefit from this package. Low income earners</p>
<p>   were kicked around by Labor's 1993 tax changes when they introduced</p>
<p>   a GST of their own without any compensation.</p>
<p>  JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>  (Inaudible)</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  I assure you that when the package comes out there will be adequate</p>
<p>   protection for low income earners. We will not introduce a tax package</p>
<p>   that unfairly hurts low income earners.</p>
<p>  JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>  When you say soon, does that mean this month, Mr Howard?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  It will be brought down quite soon, I am not going to be tied down</p>
<p>   to weeks or months. I have been saying that now in answer to those</p>
<p>   questions before and there is no variation on that.</p>
<p>  JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>  Will wealth taxes form part of the package?</p>
<p>   PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  I'm not going to speculate on individual things about it certainly</p>
<p>   not in that direction.</p>
<p>  JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>  Senator Colston says that he has no major concerns with the Wik</p>
<p>   legislation. Does that make you confident that the bill will be</p>
<p>   passed?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well I hope the Bill will pass. For the good of Australia, I hope</p>
<p>   the Senate passes this Bill. Australians want this issue resolved.</p>
<p>   Australians want the Wik issue off the political agenda, and I hope</p>
<p>   all members of the Senate keep that in mind when they vote, including</p>
<p>   members of the Labor Party, who have played a very negative, divisive</p>
<p>   game on this. If they are listening to Australians, they themselves</p>
<p>   will support the agreement that I have reached with Senator Harradine.</p>
<p>  JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>  Mr Howard how did (inaudible)</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  I beg your pardon?</p>
<p>  JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>  He does have some concerns for the Telstra Bill. Will you be having</p>
<p>   discussions with him about that?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well the arrangement with Senator Colston is that if he wants any</p>
<p>   information on any of our legislation like any other Senator, he</p>
<p>   talks to the relevant Minister, who is Senator Alston.</p>
<p>  JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>  On the issue of Wik, have you spoken to Mr Colston at all?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well, I don't have anything to add to what has already been</p>
<p>   said. But normally it would be Senator Minchin who handles the legislation</p>
<p>   in the Senate, who would speak to Senators about it. I negotiated</p>
<p>   with Senator Harradine because of the special circumstances.</p>
<p>   JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>  ... do you have any idea about what his concerns are?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well he has spoken today. I think you should speak to him. I don't</p>
<p>   presume to speak for an independent Senator. That is a matter for</p>
<p>   him.</p>
<p>  JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>  He has concerns for Telstra workers. Will you have discussions with</p>
<p>   him about that?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well he would normally talk to Senator Alston about that, not me.</p>
<p>   Senator Alston is handling that matter with great skill and great</p>
<p>   flair and I have every confidence in Senator Alston.</p>
<p>  JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>  Mr Howard, if Senator Colston does vote with Labor, though doesn't</p>
<p>   it force a double dissolution?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well, I think you are dealing in a hypothetical situation. Just</p>
<p>   let the matter unfold. He is entitled to have a look at the legislation.</p>
<p>   He has made some comments. I am not going to put words into his</p>
<p>   mouth. He can speak for himself. I am not going to try and speak</p>
<p>   for him.</p>
<p>  JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>  But you are confident at the moment?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  I am simply repeating what I have said before. It is a matter for</p>
<p>   him to decide how he votes, not for me.</p>
<p>  JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>  You had very close relations with Senator Harradine. Are you going</p>
<p>   to take up the matter with Senator Colston?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  I think those questions have reached their use by date.</p>
<p>  JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>  Are you happy to take Senator Harradine's vote?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Senator Harradine's vote? Certainly.</p>
<p>  JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>  Senator Colston has said that he has no major problems with the</p>
<p>   Wik Bill.</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  I think with all of these things, you're never absolutely certain</p>
<p>   in the Senate until the final vote is taken.</p>
<p>  JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>  (Inaudible) the issue of Senator Harradine (inaudible).</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  It's a beautiful afternoon.</p>
<p>  JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>  Sir you seem very relaxed. You've gone to this length to discuss</p>
<p>   the matter with Senator Harradine, but now you say Senator Colston</p>
<p>   could take (inaudible).</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  I'm not taking any more questions on that. We have gone up</p>
<p>   hill and down dale on that and it is getting a bit boring.</p>
<p>  JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>  But it is certainly a point on which you are having problems, Prime</p>
<p>   Minister, with due respect.</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  (laughs)</p>
<p>  JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>  On tax, the Labor Party quite successfully ran a negative campaign</p>
<p>   in '93. Would you expect them to do it again?</p>
<p>   PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well I suppose that if you don't care about Australians, yes.</p>
<p>   But if you really cared about having a better tax system, a fairer</p>
<p>   tax system for Australia, if you were worried about having a more</p>
<p>   competitive tax system for the country, you would worry. But if</p>
<p>   you don't care about the national interest, if all you are</p>
<p>   worried about is winning votes, point scoring, then of course you</p>
<p>   would run a negative campaign. But if you are really worried about</p>
<p>   the long term interests of the country you would fight for tax reform.</p>
<p>   And the reason that I am committed to tax reform and the government</p>
<p>   is committed to tax reform is that I know it is good for Australia,</p>
<p>   and I don't intend to be diverted from it, because what is</p>
<p>   good for Australia is something the Government should pursue. If</p>
<p>   Mr Beazley cared about he national interest instead of the Labor</p>
<p>   interest I am sure he would also pursue it.</p>
<p>  JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>  There are some ads running tonight (inaudible)?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Well those ads are not run by us, but I certainly agree that the</p>
<p>   tax system is badly in need of change and repair. How you present</p>
<p>   that is a matter for different individuals. But from my point of</p>
<p>   view we have an unfair, ailing tax system. We're prepared to</p>
<p>   do something about it for the good of Australia. Mr Beazley is adopting</p>
<p>   a negative, frightened, backward-looking, point scoring approach</p>
<p>   which I think over time Australia will come to condemn.</p>
<p>  JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>  (Inaudible)</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  The tax burden will certainly not rise under us. Thank you.</p>
<p>  JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>  How seriously do you take Jackie Kelly's concerns?</p>
<p>  PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>  Jackie Kelly will win her seat at the next election. Thank you.</p>
<p>  ends</p>
