    <content><![CDATA[<p>I am pleased to announce that Victorian company RightShip is the winner of the Prime Ministerâs Australian Exporter of the Year award.</p>
<p>RightShip provides the worldâs most comprehensive online marine and environmental risk management system and exports its ship vetting services to the global maritime industry.</p>
<p>Vetting identifies and analyses a ship, enabling customers to remove substandard ships from their supply chain, minimising the risk of marine incidents, loss of lives, cargo and environmental damage.</p>
<p>The company has customers in 40 countries, undertakes ship inspections in 114 countries and generates 84 per cent of its revenue outside Australia.</p>
<p>RightShip is a terrific example of the ingenuity, innovation and international business success for which Australian companies are renowned.</p>
<p>The Australian Export Awards programme is co-presented by Austrade and the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry.</p>
<p>The Awards are run in collaboration with the organisers of state and territory export awards programmes.</p>
<p>Winners were selected using several criteria, including innovation in marketing strategy, the degree of export growth and the creation of competitive advantage.</p>
<p>Importantly, these awards are a way of recognising and rewarding international business success.</p>
<p>The Coalition Government recognises the importance of Australiaâs economic diplomacy by actively pursuing trade agreements to improve market access for our exporters.</p>
<p>Trade and foreign investment adds to economic growth and the improvement of living standards for all Australians.</p>
<p>I congratulate all involved in this yearâs Australian Export Awards.</p>
