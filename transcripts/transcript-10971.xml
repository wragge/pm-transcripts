    <content><![CDATA[<p>E&amp;OE......................................................................................................................</p>
<p>Thank you very much to Kerry Stokes and Brian Kennedy, Mr Olsen of</p>
<p> Esso, to Mrs Kate Carnell, the Chief Minister of the Australian Capital</p>
<p> Territory, to my two predecessors, John Gorton and Gough Whitlam,</p>
<p> both of whose governments made immense and important contributions</p>
<p> to the enduring place of the arts in the Australian community, to</p>
<p> my Ministerial colleague Richard Alston, who I agree with the Chairman</p>
<p> is an outstanding Arts Minister, you say that he doesn't always</p>
<p> get everything that you ask, that's not the view of the Finance</p>
<p> Minister and the Treasurer, but he is a very committed person of the</p>
<p> arts in Australia, and also I acknowledge the presence of the Chief</p>
<p> Justice of Australia, Sir Gerard and Lady Brennan.</p>
<p>It is a special occasion for Canberra, it is a special occasion for</p>
<p> the National Gallery, and it's a very special occasion for the</p>
<p> place of the arts in the Australian community.</p>
<p>I remember attending, with Janette, fifteen years ago the opening</p>
<p> of this building by Malcolm Fraser. And over the last fifteen years,</p>
<p> through various governments, the arts in their different forms have</p>
<p> flourished in quite a remarkable fashion. And these extensions and</p>
<p> the place of the arts in the Australian community of course have been</p>
<p> contributed to by many people. And I join Brian Kennedy and others</p>
<p> in paying tribute to the work of Betty Churcher, the former Director</p>
<p> of the Gallery, who did play such a significant role in getting so</p>
<p> much of it into place.</p>
<p>I would like to also on behalf of the government, thank Esso, and</p>
<p> through Esso thank all the other companies in Australia, and all the</p>
<p> other individuals in the private sector who make such a contribution</p>
<p> to financing and supporting the arts in its various forms all around</p>
<p> our country. We have developed the habit of philanthropy to a much</p>
<p> greater extent over the last ten or twenty years. But we still have</p>
<p> a distance to go. But there are many similarities that are celebrated</p>
<p> in the exhibition that I am about to open between the experience of</p>
<p> Australia and the experience of the United States. The similarities</p>
<p> in the landscape productions of the two countries are very marked</p>
<p> as you have a look at the exhibition. And of course there are some</p>
<p> very marked differences. One similarity that I would like to see emerge</p>
<p> in greater form is the habit of corporate philanthropy in Australia.</p>
<p> If we could perhaps duplicate what is done in the United States, particularly</p>
<p> in the area of arts, I think it would be something of the United States</p>
<p> well borrowed by the Australian community. But in saying that its</p>
<p> all the more reason why I should emphasis the contribution that is</p>
<p> made by companies such as Esso and AMCOR and many others that have</p>
<p> helped over the years.</p>
<p>This evening I have got the pleasure of launching three things not</p>
<p> one. The exhibition Esso Presents New Worlds from Old, the new exhibition</p>
<p> wing designed by Andrew Andersons, arguably now Australia's finest</p>
<p> temporary exhibition space and of course Fiona Hall's Garden</p>
<p> Sculpture and Water Feature.</p>
<p>It will add enormously to the attraction of Canberra as a tourist</p>
<p> destination. And it will add enormously to the sense of our national</p>
<p> capital as the greatest repository of great national institutions.</p>
<p> And Kate is right when she says it's not only an important occasion</p>
<p> for Canberrans, but it's also an important occasion for all Australians.</p>
<p>It's an opportunity for me on behalf of the government to not</p>
<p> only affirm in the strongest possible language, our ongoing support</p>
<p> for the role not only of the Gallery but of the arts in the life of</p>
<p> Australia and in the activities of our community, but it's also</p>
<p> an opportunity for me to congratulate Kerry Stokes and Brian Kennedy</p>
<p> and all the other members of the board of the Gallery for the way</p>
<p> in which they have acted as good stewards of the resources that have</p>
<p> been given to them by my government and by the government of the ACT.</p>
<p>This exhibition which Janette and I had the privilege of looking at</p>
<p> briefly before coming here, this exhibition celebrates the similarities</p>
<p> in the heritage of our two countries, but it also is a very sharp</p>
<p> reminder of the distinctive qualities of our two societies. And it</p>
<p> is a reminder to any proud Australian, and that of course embraces</p>
<p> all of us here tonight, of the skill and the dexterity and the talent</p>
<p> of our own artists. And it fills me with a great deal of pride to</p>
<p> know that this exhibition, which will put on display so many of the</p>
<p> finest Australian artists will go to many parts of the United States.</p>
<p>Last week I had the opportunity of visiting North East Arnhem Land</p>
<p> and viewing some of the artwork of the indigenous people living in</p>
<p> that part of Australia. And I am therefor particularly pleased to</p>
<p> hear the news about the St Petersburg Exhibition of Australian Indigenous</p>
<p> Art.</p>
<p>In so many ways art does express what we are. Art should not shout</p>
<p> at us, it should speak of us as we are. It should allow us to express</p>
<p> ourselves and it should at all times be a representation to the world</p>
<p> of what Australia is and what Australia has achieved. And as every</p>
<p> year goes by we draw more strength as a community from our artists,</p>
<p> we draw more strength from the reservoir of talent in so many of the</p>
<p> art forms that which is Australia's great good fortune.</p>
<p>The National Gallery has played a very important role in the life</p>
<p> of our society over the past fifteen years. These extensions will</p>
<p> enhance the appeal of the Gallery, they will make it more available</p>
<p> to the Australian community, and all of us who care about the role</p>
<p> of the arts in Australian society must take great heart from the ever</p>
<p> increasing patronage of the arts by average Australians. The way in</p>
<p> which in perhaps a generation and a half the arts have gone from appearing</p>
<p> to be just a possession of a select few or an elite to something that</p>
<p> is accessible to and loved by and favoured by all sections of the</p>
<p> Australian community, is something that I know must bring enormous</p>
<p> pleasure to those people who have devoted their entire lives to promoting</p>
<p> and patronising the arts in Australia.</p>
<p>So ladies and gentlemen, I again congratulate the Gallery on what</p>
<p> it has done. I salute the memory of the artists who have contributed</p>
<p> both as landscape painters in the United States and also in Australia</p>
<p> I thank Esso for its contribution, I particularly congratulate Kerry</p>
<p> and Brian and those that put the exhibition together. And I have enormous</p>
<p> pleasure in declaring open Esso Presents New Worlds from Old, the</p>
<p> new exhibition wing and of course Fiona Hall's Garden Sculpture</p>
<p> and Water Feature.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
