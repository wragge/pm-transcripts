    <content><![CDATA[<p>Australia condemns North Korea’s latest Inter-Continental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) test in the strongest possible terms.</p>
<p>This test is North Korea’s second ICBM test this month.</p>
<p>The ballistic missile tests and North Korea’s ongoing reckless and menacing behaviour, are in violation of multiple UN Security Council resolutions, is a threat to regional and global security and stability and is in violation of the rules based order we seek to promote and advance.</p>
<p>Australia urges strong UN Security Council action in response to these tests. We call on all countries to implement existing UN Security Council resolutions against North Korea as a matter of urgency.</p>
<p>Australia also urges China to use its considerable leverage to dissuade North Korea from continuing to conduct these tests in order to develop its illegal nuclear and ballistic missile programs.</p>
<p>In addition to our actions in the United Nations, Australia continues to implement a strong autonomous sanctions regime that targets individuals and entities supporting North Korea’s illegal nuclear and ballistic missile programs. Australia’s sanctions also add to international pressure on North Korea and limit commercial activities that could finance weapons programs.</p>
<p>Australia supports defensive measures under way in the region which are a necessary response to the threat posed by North Korea’s behaviour and policies. The escalation of regional tension is entirely the responsibility of the North Korean regime.</p>
<p>We will continue to work with our partners, including the United States, Japan, the Republic of Korea and China, to impose costs on the regime in order to stop its threatening and destabilising behavior. </p>
