PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
INTERVIEW WITH ANDREW DENTON " PAUL KEATING UNPLUGGED',<br />
SEVEN NETWORK, 1 NOVEMBER 1995<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
AD: That's a good start. Now I have seen you work a room before. You<br />
are very, very good at it. Does working a room come naturally to you?<br />
When you were a kid did you go to other kids birthday parties and walk<br />
out an hour later knowing you had the numbers?<br />
PM: No, but I always had a sixth sense of who liked me and who didn't.<br />
AD: Yes.<br />
PM: I could always tell.<br />
AD: How can you tell?<br />
PM: Well it is just a, you know, maybe an aura, an idea you have. But you<br />
need it in public life. You need to be able to assess people quickly<br />
and also to enjoy them.<br />
AD: When someone doesn't like you, how do you deal with that?<br />
PM: Oh, well I try and do the best I can with them. Put them out of their<br />
misery.<br />
AD: What, you kneecap them?<br />
PM: No, make them feel more comfortable.<br />
AD: Is power sexy? Is it a sexy thing?<br />
PM: Well, I don't think so. It wouldn't interest a sexy fellow like you.<br />
AD: Sure. </p>
<p>PM: But it is uplifting and exciting. It is uplifting and it is exciting, partly<br />
because it is a high wire act, It is always big issues with a lot of<br />
moment, always done mostly under difficult circumstances. So it is the<br />
ultimate high wire business and you can't be on the high wire and not<br />
be excited, or elated.<br />
AD: I have a quote here from Neville Wran former New South Wales<br />
Premier, Federal President of the ALP, as you know...<br />
PM: A great fellow.<br />
AD: about what it takes to get to the top in politics. " To get there in the<br />
first place takes an enormous amount of tenacity and courage, the<br />
capacity to snap out of depression because it is a lonely life stepping<br />
over the bodies to get to the top. To get there you finish up covered in<br />
blood and shit up to your elbows. It doesn't vary anywhere. It is never<br />
easy. It is all hard." Does that ring a bell with you?<br />
PM: Yes, it does. It is like an endurance test. It is like a marathon. I think<br />
the better analogy. It is like a marathon. But you can't keep running<br />
unless you have got something to run for. You know, you can't keep<br />
going unless you have something to run for. And, therefore, I don't<br />
really think you have to crawl over people, or in some way respond to<br />
that sort of frame of reference providing you keep running. But you<br />
can't keep running if you don't believe. If you are not a believer, you<br />
run out of puff.<br />
AD: Is it as brutal as Neville Wran makes it sound though?<br />
PM: It is perhaps during the mezzanine phase. You know what I mean?<br />
AD: The mezzanine phase?<br />
PM: That is before you have got to the first floor. That is where all the<br />
sorting gets, I think, brought on in earnest. Once you are at the first<br />
floor, it is a bit like coming to the top of the mountain. As you get<br />
towards the apex there are fewer places to go, fewer places to hide<br />
and it is all more obvious. So the selection becomes more automatic.<br />
But down at the base it is harder.<br />
AD: So basically the higher up you go, the easier it is to clean the blood<br />
away because it just..<br />
PM: Yes, but it is not blood. It is, what should I say, easier to fill the<br />
intellectual vacuums.<br />
AD: What does that mean?<br />
PM: Well if there is a void there somewhere, you can fill it with somebody<br />
and move on. </p>
<p>AD: Are you often in touch with intellectual voids?<br />
PM: I have got a whole range of them sitting opposite me every day.<br />
AD: First one. This will be an interesting exercise in statesmanship tonight.<br />
PM: You are a bad influence.<br />
AD: I said nothing. I was actually wondering more about your own Caucus.<br />
Actually speaking of your fellow Ministers, when Barry Jones is on the<br />
line how do you get him off the phone?<br />
PM: Don't get him on.<br />
AD: Is that Labor Party policy now, don't get him on?<br />
PM: Oh, no, Barry is okay.<br />
AD: When he rings do you sort of scribble a note going " not here, not<br />
here"?<br />
PM: I have done that, but not very often.<br />
AD: What about Kim? Do you worry about his weight?<br />
PM: Oh you were unkind to him a week or two ago.<br />
AD: I think everyone is unkind to Kim at least once in their life. It is just<br />
part of the political cycle. Neville Wran describes it as you have to<br />
deal with depression because it is lonely getting to the top.<br />
Is depression ever anything that you have had to deal with?<br />
PM: I have had bad times, but you have always, I think, got to believe you<br />
can slog it out.<br />
AD: What is your idea of a harrowing experience that you have been<br />
through, moments where you realise oh don't touch that fence it is<br />
electrified?<br />
PM: Well you have got to make judgements. For instance, one I made<br />
if you like, the turning point in the last Parliament was I said in the<br />
Parliament if Labor loses the election, we will pass the GST in the<br />
Senate and our mob went " ahh". And I thought oh they'll be right in a<br />
couple of minutes. But they weren't. They weren't right. They all had<br />
a Bex and a good lie down after it. The whole lot of them. I mean<br />
seeing a full Caucus having a Bex and a good lie down it is a moving<br />
sight.<br />
AD: Yes. I just thought of Kim Beazley and Robert Ray lying down. </p>
<p>PM: Well you can always pick them out. And I thought did I call this<br />
wrong? But I was sure I didn't, you see? So the public thought this is<br />
getting serious, we are going to get a GST because if this other joker<br />
wins, this one will pass it and from that moment it became real that<br />
discussion.<br />
AD: Yes.<br />
PM: And the moment that became real, the pressure came on Hewson and<br />
then the cracks started running through the stratas, you see what<br />
I mean? Whereas before I couldn't get the weight on him. But then<br />
the cracks started appearing in the stratas. So, you said what was<br />
harrowing, living through the little period until everyone decided it was<br />
a masterstroke and not a mistake that is the definition of harrowing.<br />
AD: You didn't consult with them at all before you said this? The first time<br />
they heard it was when you stood up?<br />
PM: Oh, yes. But if it is not spontaneous, it has no effect.<br />
AD: Eisenhower used to say that a sense of humour is a part of the art of<br />
leadership. Do you ever tell jokes against yourself?<br />
PM: Oh, yes, all the time.<br />
AD: Oh do share.<br />
PM: Well they don't come to mind.<br />
AD: Well, no, I'll tell you what<br />
PM: They are situation jokes.<br />
AD: no, I will give you some thinking music.<br />
PM: We will give you some tonight.<br />
AD: [ Denton humming " God Save the Queen"]. No, in what situation then?<br />
I mean, yes, it is hard to come up with jokes off the top of your head.<br />
In what situation?<br />
PM: Oh, often with my staff I will say things which are self deprecatory.<br />
AD: Well what would you self deprecate about?<br />
PM: Well that is a hard question. I mean, again, they come up on the spur<br />
of the moment.<br />
AD: You used to be a larrikin. You say this. You used to leap off the back<br />
of ferries and arrange for a mate to pick you up just when everyone </p>
<p>thought you were drowning. Which, in fact, could also be a political<br />
metaphor when you think about it.<br />
PM: There is always someone there to pick you up.<br />
AD: Always someone there to pick you up. Especially a mate in the<br />
New South Wales Right too.<br />
PM: It is laden with mates.<br />
AD: Absolutely.<br />
PM: Wall to wall mates.<br />
AD: I would presume in your job you don't get the opportunity to be a<br />
larrikin. I mean Malcolm Fraser apparently used to slip ice cubes into<br />
the pockets of people as a joke and well we loved him for that.<br />
PM: Oh, yes, I wondered what it was actually.<br />
AD: Because he didn't have pockets sometimes. I am just trying to get at<br />
what is the Prime Ministerial sense of humour.<br />
PM: Oh, I have a great sense of humour. I am always a sucker for a laugh.<br />
AD: Yes.<br />
PM: Any friend of mine that makes me laugh is a friend of mine for life,<br />
basically.<br />
AD: Really? Even if they are on the other side of the House?<br />
PM: Oh, yes. You're in there with a chance, pal.<br />
AD: Hey, hey, hey. We have said no body contact. Absolutely no body<br />
contact. I think he is trying to crack on to me. You have got to be<br />
careful.<br />
PM: You're getting value out of those boots, aren't you?<br />
AD: Yes.<br />
PM: They will be with you in five years time.<br />
AD: You're getting value out of those too.<br />
PM: Yes, but these will wear out in 18 months.<br />
AD: Well it depends whose head you have been kicking with them, really.<br />
If you pick soft heads or hard heads. </p>
<p>PM: Where did you get those, at the sort of army surplus, is it?<br />
AD: We haven't found out much about your sense of humour, but we have<br />
discovered you are a foot fetishist. You like passionate people don't<br />
you?<br />
PM: I do. I love stars. I like people who are good at what they do.<br />
AD: What about passionate Liberals?<br />
PM: Well how can you be a Liberal and be passionate? It is a contradiction<br />
in terms to say I am a Conservative but I am passionate about it.<br />
AD: How has this happened though? How have we ended up with such an<br />
apparently tragic situation where all the people with ideas are on one<br />
side of politics and a bunch of people totally bereft of ideas are on the<br />
other?<br />
PM: Well it happens. I mean look at the Labor Party in the 50s and<br />
it was nowhere. Philosophically, it was nowhere. Now it is not that the<br />
individuals didn't have ideas then, or that individuals of the Liberal<br />
Party don't have ideas now. But, philosophically, in the 50s and<br />
we were all over the place. They are now in that position.<br />
AD: Could I put to you your worst nightmare? John Howard dies tomorrow,<br />
you have to go to his funeral and say something nice about him.<br />
What would you say?<br />
PM: Well, no, I would say that he stuck by the ideology and the philosophy<br />
that he believed in. But, of course, I think that is all wrong for<br />
Australia...<br />
AD: Yes, we know that.<br />
PM: at the end of the 20th century.<br />
AD: He has stuck by it passionately, would you say?<br />
PM: Dogmatically. There is a difference.<br />
AD: There is a difference. You can't mention John Howard without talking<br />
about the Parliamentary bear-pit and we have some examples of your<br />
work here. First of all, a couple of examples of you in full flight.<br />
( video rolls)<br />
AD: It seems to me that you really enjoy the theatre of Parliament.<br />
PM: I do because I like to think that all the incoming balls are coming in<br />
slow motion. So you say, is this one going into the Queen Elizabeth<br />
Stand? Is this one going into, you know, the such and such stand? </p>
<p>In other words, if you have got the mosaic right, every question is<br />
going to have a slot. Whereas if you don't have a mosaic it is just all<br />
happening rapidly around you. So, even though you don't have much<br />
time to prepare, you know what the argument is and where it fits and if<br />
they come particularly slow, you can get the rhetoric ready as well.<br />
A theatre, you know, a nice little touch.<br />
AD: Where abouts in the mosaic then does this particular performance fit.<br />
( video rolls)<br />
AD: Was that adlib or was that written. Was it like blgh, blgh, blgh?<br />
PM: No I learnt that one in primary school. Everybody was out of step bar<br />
him. That was the point I was trying to make.<br />
AD: In public perception, the word most thrown around about you is<br />
arrogance.<br />
PM: I know that, yes.<br />
AD: Does that surprise you?<br />
PM: Well, I think they confuse pride in ones craft and getting the job done<br />
with arrogance. I mean, letting a good thing be knocked over is not<br />
humility. What has happened in our political system in most of the<br />
post war years is that politicians threw the pass. They threw the pass<br />
on all the big changes. Australia had become by the very early 1980s<br />
quite a relatively poor country in terms of its national income.<br />
AD: I'm going to stop you there for one second. I don't want to go into that<br />
speech.<br />
PM: No, no, but I just want to say this, that it became a poor country and<br />
people had thrown the pass on big policy changes. Therefore to get<br />
them through you have really got to have a big run at it and you have<br />
got to push hard. I think they confuse the pushing with arrogance<br />
rather than with pride in one's craft and getting it done.<br />
AD: There may be some truth in that, but I think they also see a man who is<br />
verbally very brutal.<br />
PM: Orally very brutal.<br />
AD: Yes, orally and, of course, extremely linguistically pedantic. Let's not<br />
forget that, but also a winner, a man who desperately loves to be a<br />
winner which isn't a bad trait for most Australians, but you have<br />
pushed that through so forcefully, I think that is what they see as<br />
arrogance. Somebody that will never, ever, ever, ever back down no<br />
matter what the situation. </p>
<p>PM: Well, there is no prize for coming second is there?<br />
AD: There is a second prize.<br />
PM: That is the one we gave John Hewson at the last election. I think what<br />
the public need to know is when I do those things I am doing it for<br />
them.<br />
AD: This will hurt you more than it will hurt them.<br />
PM: No, when I push one past the system I am doing it for them because so<br />
many have not done it for years, who don't I think, have not had the<br />
conscientious regard for them that I hope I have. That I won't sponge<br />
on them or kid them. And if the price of all that is that some of the<br />
imagery gets scratched up along the way well, I don't mind that.<br />
AD: How is it possible as Prime Minister to keep in touch with the battler?<br />
Is it a sort of remote sensing thing where members of your Caucus tell<br />
you about people they know who know real people or do you go<br />
straight to the source and have lunch with John Laws, how do you do<br />
it?<br />
PM: He knows them!<br />
AD: He does.<br />
PM: He is one himself. Well, for a start, I lived for 40 years in Bankstown in<br />
Western Sydney. I grew up there and worked there, lived there and<br />
you end up with all of the frame of reference, mores, values of that<br />
community. I am a westie.<br />
AD: You are a westie?<br />
PM: I am a westie.<br />
AD: Well, where are your ugh boots? Come on.<br />
PM: I have got them on can't you see.<br />
( video rolls)<br />
AD: Do you sometimes feel awkward about the positions you are put in as<br />
Prime Minister?<br />
PM: What happened was, we were standing there with this very interesting<br />
group of young people who were going off to the Skill Olympics and<br />
then there was this very strong beat of this song coming through and<br />
we were all standing there. Well, of course, I can't resist a beat so I<br />
had the feet going and I thought well, I might as well throw the lot in<br />
and then I brought them in. </p>
<p>AD: So, old good time Paul was leading..<br />
PM: A sing-a-long.<br />
AD: Yes, all right. Maybe it is just me, but you didn't look totally<br />
comfortable in that situation.<br />
PM: Have a look at the people next to me. I look more comfortable than<br />
them.<br />
AD: You have always championed Australian culture. Not since Gough<br />
Whitlam have we had a Prime Minister so allied to that sense of<br />
culture. And, you have championed the information super highway<br />
and we have seen the first three gleaming lanes of that open recently<br />
courtesy of pay television Foxtel, Optus and Galaxy which is<br />
essentially wall to wall American broadcasting with a token Australian<br />
representation. What benefit is that to Australian culture?<br />
PM: It may be at this point of its development, it may not be a development<br />
of Australian culture, but it will be a development to Australian services<br />
and information. The pay television is paying for the fibre optic cable.<br />
When Telecom slips the fibre optic cable under the door, which is<br />
going to bring with it all the interactive services, all the on-line services<br />
so when people have got their personal computers and they are really<br />
into creativity and interactivity, the thing that is going to facilitate that<br />
happening as a pay television service which pays the freight for putting<br />
the cable there in the first place.<br />
AD: I guess the reason I am puzzled and frankly depressed about the<br />
future prospects of Australia as an individual entity is that yours is the<br />
party and you are the man that is rapt in the flag. You actually have<br />
the flag as your logo and you have always been on the public record<br />
as being deeply committed to Australia and I don't think anybody could<br />
doubt your emotional commitment, yet on the other hand I see in a big<br />
picture sense national assets being sold off, American television<br />
swamping our own culture thanks to this new pay television and 1,<br />
frankly, find it hypocritical.<br />
PM: No, we fought them. No, don't be too pessimistic. We fought the<br />
Americans in the Uruguay Round the GATT and the reason we did<br />
is so we would have the right to have our film industry. We would<br />
have the right to put content provisions. into our free to air<br />
broadcasting. That we would have the right to have a somewhat<br />
protected film industry. Now, we have done those things, but<br />
Australian culture is not going to be decided by what comes down the<br />
pay tv channel. It is going to be decided by the sort of society we are,<br />
the faith we have in ourselves one to the other in our capacities and<br />
what we can do together and the belief that we have in the country.<br />
AD: I hope you are right Prime Minister. I hope that Australian children<br />
don't eventually see Australian history through American eyes. I don't </p>
<p>know if you saw how your office was portrayed on The Simpsons<br />
recently. Here is a sample.<br />
( video rolls)<br />
PM: Well, they have got some of it there haven't they?<br />
AD: Would you like to move on from here maybe and lead a larger<br />
country?<br />
PM: No, Menzies had that in mind you know. He thought the British<br />
Conservative Party might choose him over Churchill.<br />
AD: Your wife has described you as a daydreamer. Do you get a chance to<br />
do that at all in your position.<br />
PM: Yes, and that is a fair description because show me a good<br />
government and I'll show you a group of good ministers with good<br />
ideas. That sort of creativity can only come from putting the stuff<br />
together yourself so you have got to think.<br />
AD: But, daydreaming?<br />
PM: So, often I'll find myself at something and I'm thinking about something<br />
completely different. Annita will say to me, are you with us? Like, click,<br />
click, click, are you with us? I'll say yep, yep, but I wasn't. I wasn't. I<br />
was fibbing.<br />
AD: Prime Minister, we are out of time. When you go home tonight, tuck<br />
yourself into bed in the jammies, are you going to sleep well?<br />
PM: Not as well as I used to.<br />
AD: What's the problem?<br />
PM: Late night television programs perhaps. No I'll go home and do a bit of<br />
reading, have a look in on the kids, turn out the lights and hope we<br />
wake up to a good set of newspapers in the morning.<br />
AD: Prime Minister, thanks very much.<br />
PM: Thanks very much.<br />
