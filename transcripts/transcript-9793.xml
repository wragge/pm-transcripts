    <content><![CDATA[<p>PRIME MINISTER<br />SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />TENTH ANNIVERSARY DINNER OF THE AUSTRALIAN CHINESE FORUM OF<br />NSW, SYDNEY, 12 OCTOBER 1995<br />I'm delighted to be here for the tenth annual dinner of the Australian Chinese Forum<br />of NSW.<br />I know that many Labor leaders have participated in the activities of the Forum, and<br />it's a tradition that I'm pleased to continue.<br />The Forum's activities in raising the profile of Australian Chinese and encouraging<br />them to participate fully in our national life are very worthwhile.<br />Can I also commend the Forum's efforts in raising the political awareness of the<br />Chinese community. I think it's vital that all elements of society engage in the<br />democratic life of Australia.<br />Your Forum is playing a valuable role within the Chinese community.<br />That the Forum is one of several similar organisations in Sydney is a mark of the<br />community's health and maturity.<br />Australian Chinese are one of our oldest and most respected communities.<br />By some accounts the first Chinese mariners made landfall on our northern coasts<br />centuries before European settlement. Since the gold rushes of the mid nineteenth<br />century you have lived the Australian story with us.<br />You have brought your ambition and energy. The lives you have built for yourselves<br />have also built Australia.<br />You have built some of Australia's most successful businesses and provided the<br />labour and acumen on which many others were built. You have played key roles in<br />Australia's public life, and continued the admirable Chinese philanthropic tradition.<br />You have enriched the culture in myriad ways.</p>
<p>I think it should also be said that you were trail blazers of modern Australian<br />multicultural ism. You saw through that long era of xenophobia and prejudice you<br />survived discrimination and violence. You have undergone traumas in our history<br />which other groups have never known.<br />I think it is safe to say that Australia is now a much more tolerant and worldly place.<br />If this is so then in no small way we have the Chinese to thank for it and no group<br />of Australians is more entitled to enjoy its benefits.<br />At the same time we all continue to benefit from Chinese culture and Chinese<br />enterprise. We are now very much aware that cultural diversity is a major national<br />asset, especially coupled with the social cohesion we enjoy.<br />We are a more enterprising people, equipped with more languages and talents and<br />international, and especially regional, contacts.<br />Australian Chinese are succeeding brilliantly in an extraordinary range of activity in<br />business and industry, in medicine and science, in academia, in music and the arts,<br />in sport. When a Chee Quee is scoring runs for New South Wales, you know you're<br />making progress.<br />Societies are generally less than perfect but Australia's way of living and working<br />together works better than most.<br />No government decree makes it work. I think the success of multicultural ism derives<br />principally from the country's democratic ethos coupled to a fundamental<br />pragmatism. The last two generations of Australians have seen the necessity of<br />immigration and learning to live with cultural difference and in due course the<br />experience has taught us to see the great advantages.<br />Governments can't legislate for a cohesive society. But there are some things<br />governments can do.<br />Rather than requiring newcomers to Australia to shed their cultural identity, we have<br />encouraged them to retain their links with their parent cultures. We have asked only<br />that immigrants respect our basic democratic values and traditions, and that all<br />Australians reserve their primary loyalty for Australia.<br />We have set ourselves the task of creating an inclusive society: we try to draw in all<br />those who drift to the margins: we maintain a sophisticated social safety net to<br />protect the low paid and those who fall on hard times; we provide health care, social<br />security, education and community services. We take the view that the most<br />successful countries in the world in the last half of this century are those which have<br />adopted this kind of social democratic model.<br />We think that a country like Australia can run a dynamic globally integrated economy<br />maintaining high rates of growth, without the creation of an economic underclass.</p>
<p>We take the view that such an underclass whether it is based on economic, ethnic<br />or any other factor is ultimately damaging to the social fabric, to the way of life we<br />aspire to and to our national ambitions.<br />This attitude has much in common, I think, with the decision taken a quarter of a<br />century ago to finally reject the notion that ethnic origin should ever be a criterion for<br />the selection of immigrants to Australia.<br />It is of a kind with the bill brought before the Commonwealth Parliament to<br />unreservedly declare that racism is wrong and that racial vilification and incitement<br />to racial violence is illegal.<br />I have said in the past that I look forward to the day when Australians will<br />instinctively count among the great advantages of being an Australian the<br />democracy and tolerance we enjoy here: who also recognise these things as being<br />essential to our social cohesion and our national identity and who see them as<br />inviolable tenets of Australian life.<br />I believe we are coming rapidly to this conclusion. And I also believe that as a<br />people we have come a long way very quickly towards recognising both the reality<br />and the great potential of our engagement with Asia.<br />These days, most people are believers. But the story still needs telling.<br />Around two-thirds of all Australia's exports already go to East Asia.<br />Our merchandise exports to East Asia grew by more than seven per cent last year<br />and are now worth $ 41 billion.<br />And more than one million Australian jobs have been created by those exports.<br />By as soon as next year when our exports to Indonesia and Malaysia will each<br />exceed our exports to the United Kingdom Australia's top ten export markets will all<br />be APEC members.<br />At current rates, our exports to the region will almost double in value by 2000. All the<br />signs are that our economic links with Asia will continue to strengthen.<br />But I want to emphasise as strongly as I can that this Government's commitment to<br />closer relations with Asia is not the result of some crude economic determinism. It is<br />not simply a matter of following the markets.<br />Asia is not a target of convenience for us. It is no fad, fashion or political gimmick.<br />The Leader of the Opposition may " blow hot and cold on Asia" as a commentator in<br />the Singapore Business Times described it this week.<br />I</p>
<p>I do not think it was Mr Howard's intention, as the same article observed, to " stoke<br />up a little paranoia about Australia's immediate northern neighbours", because Mr<br />Howard would know better than anyone how dangerous and unpopular this ploy is.<br />What worries me is that the defence speech which inspired these comments in<br />Singapore seemed to reflect a continuing ambivalence about Australia in the region.<br />Often with Mr Howard one gets the feeling that while the words are there, the<br />commitment is not.<br />Yet Asia is emphatically where this country's security and prosperity lie.<br />It is where an increasing number of our people come from.<br />And unambiguously and wholeheartedly it is where we want to be.<br />In an increasing globalised world it is true, of course, that Australia has important<br />interests outside Asia.<br />It is also true that Australia has been involved in Asia over many years.<br />For the most part, our record of engagement is long and honourable, from our<br />support for Indonesian independence, through the establishment of the Colombo<br />Plan, to the development of our great trading links with Japan and Korea.<br />But it is also true, in a quite different way from the past a deeper, more urgent and<br />more intense way that Australia's economic, strategic and political interests now<br />coalesce in the region around us.<br />As I have said before, the simple fact is, if we do not succeed in the Asia-Pacific, we<br />succeed nowhere.<br />In recent years, Australia has taken great strides into our own region. Our regional<br />relationships have developed new depth and weight.<br />These advances haven't occurred by themselves. Our progress has required the<br />efforts of this government and many other Australians.<br />It's a result of the choices we have made.<br />During the 1960s, Australia came perilously close to marginalising ourselves in the<br />world. The White Australia policy and the protective and regulatory barriers behind which<br />our industry and financial institutions slumbered were all of a piece. They were all<br />the product of a defensive and inward-looking cast of mind.<br />Just in time, we saw the need to open ourselves out to the world and to break<br />through the protective walls which held our economy and our minds in check.</p>
<p>Just in time, we reformed our economy and faced it towards our own region.<br />We have transformed both the way we live and the way we relate to the outside<br />world. Foreign and domestic policy have come together driven by the same imperatives,<br />and towards the same ends.<br />Success at home and abroad are inextricably linked each dependent on the other.<br />Australia's domestic prosperity in part relies on our management of our external<br />relations. And international success requires we implement domestic policies which<br />increase Australia's competitiveness and ensure that we make the best use of all our<br />people. Our efforts on regional free trade, multicultural ism and education and training are all<br />part of the same strategy.<br />It's a strategy to cope with and capitalise on change profound and unrelenting<br />change. The international system which has been our lot since the European<br />settlement of Australia is being remade by technological revolutions and the global<br />economy.<br />This transition provides Australia and its political and business leaders with<br />unprecedented opportunities and heavy responsibilities.<br />And more choices.<br />We now have a chance to take part in crafting the new institutions and frameworks<br />which will take the world into the next century. But opportunities like this are never<br />around for long. Very quickly, new organisations will emerge and new patterns of<br />international contact will fall into place and, once that happens, further change<br />becomes very difficult to achieve.<br />I want to ensure that Australia helps to shape the new regional framework and that<br />the changes which are introduced serve our interests as well as those of the wider<br />region. That is why I have been working hard at building institutions like APEC which will<br />help cement Australia's integration into the region over the long term. My opponents<br />have recently taken to saying that I have laid claim to founding APEC. Of course I<br />have done no such thing. What we have done over the past four years is lift APEC<br />to a new plane through the institution of Leaders' Meetings. This is what has given<br />APEC its recent impetus.<br />In recent years Australia has been one of the moving forces behind the ASEAN<br />Regional Forum which deals with security issues. We are building linkages between<br />the ASEAN Free Trade Area and the Australia/ New Zealand CER arrangement.</p>
<p>We have also matched our efforts to build regional institutions with new bilateral<br />structures established over the past four years. Bodies like the Austral ia-I ndonesia<br />Ministerial Forum, the Australia-Korea Joint Economic Committee, the Thailand-<br />Australia Ministerial Commission and the Singapore-Australia Business Alliance<br />Forum are playing their part in multiplying and diversifying the strands of contact<br />between Australia and the region.<br />And we are developing new areas of co-operation with countries like Vietnam, which<br />has joined ASEAN and is beginning to participate fully in regional affairs.<br />China, of course, remains a very significant country for us. It is our sixth largest<br />trading partner, and China has more foreign investment in Australia than in any other<br />country a mark of the deep complementarity in our relationship.<br />The growing weight of China in the region and the world is obvious and inevitable.<br />Australia has nothing to fear from this. We have been a firm supporter of China's full<br />integration into world and regional institutions. We regard it as essential to engage<br />China productively in the global economy.<br />That is one reason why we think APEC offers such promise.<br />It has taken time for people in the region to accept how greatly Australia has<br />changed. But over the past twelve months or so, I believe we have begun to see a<br />significant change in regional perceptions of Australia which matches the changes in<br />Australian views of Asia.<br />In a way which has never been true in the past, our friends and neighbours have<br />recognised that Australia with our talented people, our rich continent, our secure<br />democracy and strong diverse society represents a substantial asset to the region<br />as a whole. A substantial asset and a valuable partner.<br />This fresh view of Australia is well summarised in the joint statement about the<br />Australia-Japan relationship which Prime Minister Murayama and I issued in May.<br />Japan, it said, " welcomes Australia's decision to create its future in the region and<br />reaffirms that Australia is an indispensable partner in regional affairs."<br />That same acceptance of Australia's position as a regional partner is widely reflected<br />throughout the region.<br />One of the reasons behind this, I am sure, is the recognition by our neighbours that<br />this Government has committed itself to the cause of engagement with Asia like no<br />other government before.<br />Asia is not a rather exotic optional extra on top of our foreign policies. Asia stands<br />at the very core.<br />This Government has chosen to engage the region and not to shrink from it.</p>
<p>We look for the promise and not only the dangers.<br />We work at our relationships with our neighbours and not just our old and powerful<br />friends as important as those old friends remain to us.<br />And, might I say, I choose to meet my responsibility and meet those regional leaders<br />who visit Australia.<br />I'm confident this is the right mindset to bring to the formulation of foreign policies<br />the right mindset for Australia.<br />It's a departure from the approach which characterised Australia's external<br />relationships for most of our history and which still dominates the view of a few<br />Australians. According to that school, Australia is a European enclave in an alien part of the<br />world. It assumes that we are only uneasy occupants of this continent that we have<br />never really been at home here and that our survival depends on great and<br />powerful friends from outside the region.<br />It is an approach which regards our region, at base, as a threat to be resisted.<br />I can understand this attitude. In the past it made sense. The European population<br />of this continent was isolated. Threats, like that we faced from Japan during the<br />Second World War, wer genuine and it did require assistance from a great ally,<br />whose security links with the region are unambiguously good.<br />But the world has changed a great deal in the past fifty years. What is needed now<br />as our region develops and changes and as Australia becomes more integrated into<br />the region economically and politically is a second approach strategic<br />relationships which will give us security in Asia rather than security from Asia.<br />That was why the defence policy which the Opposition Leader announced last week<br />was so deeply disappointing. It levelled one clear criticism of Government policy: in<br />Mr Howard's words, Australia's " security policy needs rebalancing to see if we have<br />got the mix right between defence of Australia's concerns and the need to enhance<br />regional engagement."<br />Mr Howard said there were " unresolved tensions between the Government's focus<br />on defence partnership with the region versus the region as the potential source of<br />threats." This is code for Mr Howard's defining belief: that the threat to Australia is from our<br />neighbours, that the big red arrows on the maps from the 1960s are still pointing<br />south.<br />That what we need are better, closer, cosier relations with a distant paternal<br />protector so that we can put off forever the task of coming to a full engagement with<br />our region.</p>
<p>This is not what Australia needs. And I am convinced it is not what Australia wants.<br />By the turn of the century, by the centenary of our nationhood, I hope that Australia<br />will be a country:<br />in which our business people are a familiar and a valued part of the<br />commercial landscape of the Asia-Pacific<br />in which our defence and strategic links with the countries around us are<br />deeper than ever<br />in which more and more Australians speak the languages of our neighbours<br />in which we are making full use of the great resource of the growing number<br />of Australians of Asian background especially Australian Chinese<br />in which our national identity is clearer to us and our neighbours through the<br />appointment of an Australian as our head of state<br />in which our national culture is shaped by, and helps to shape, the cultures<br />around us<br />We cannot go back to the old ways of dealing with our region. We cannot let the<br />pressure die. We cannot let the momentum wane.<br />It is vital that Australians and especially Australian political leaders be at ease<br />with our geography.<br />But that's an injunction I needn't deliver to this audience.<br />I don't have to lecture Australian Chinese about having a proper sense of place.<br />You have been in this country for a very long time. While you continue to draw<br />strength from two cultures from two wells your efforts continue to be part of<br />Australia's national story and an increasingly major element of the national<br />enterprise. Australia welcomes all your efforts in business, politics, the arts and sport. They<br />add up to a great part of the national enterprise.<br />Thank you.</p>
