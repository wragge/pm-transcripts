Prime Minister Julia Gillard today welcomed the participation of students from Perth high schools in a combined choir that will perform during the Opening Ceremony of the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting 2011. </p>
<p>The full 100-piece student choir will be drawn from Public, Catholic and Independent high schools throughout metropolitan Perth.   </p>
<p>Some of the students met for their very first rehearsal today at Perth Modern School in Subiaco, where they tested their vocal chords in front of the Prime Minister.  </p>
<p>The Opening Ceremony for CHOGM 2011 is an integral part of the meeting and will be held in the Riverside Theatre at the Perth Convention and Exhibition Centre on Friday 28 October 2011.</p>
<p>Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, as Head of the Commonwealth, will officially open the 2011 Meeting during the Opening Ceremony.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister joined Terry Crane, Head of the CHOGM 2011 Taskforce, Lois Joll, Perth Modern School Principal, and representatives from Western Australia's education sector in thanking the students for taking part in the Opening Ceremony.</p>
<p>The Opening Ceremony is a unique opportunity to showcase Western Australian talent, youth and also celebrate music as a shared activity in Commonwealth countries. </p>
<p>As a committed and active member of the Commonwealth, Australia takes enormous pride in being the first nation to host CHOGM three times.</p>
<p>On a recent visit to Australia, the Commonwealth Secretary-General Kamalesh Sharma advised Prime Minister Gillard that that not only was this CHOGM the best prepared, it was also the most anticipated.</p>
<p>CHOGM 2011 will be the largest gathering of world leaders in Australia, with as many as 3,000 delegates and 1,000 media representatives expected to attend.</p>
