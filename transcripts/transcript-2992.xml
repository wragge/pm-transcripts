Protection legislation, being prepared by the Attorney-General.<br />
EXPORT BANK On the recommendation of the Economic Committee,<br />
Cabinet has agreed to the establishment of an Export Bank.<br />

about this visit, about Mr. Renouf's appointment and about<br />
the motor industry.<br />
/ 4 CANBERRA, A. C. T. </p>
<p>QUESTION: Do you believe that your new policy on the automotive<br />
industry will produce a cheaper car and a better car?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Both.<br />
QU.' STION: What effect do you think the decision to allow the<br />
J3.) anese to enter the market will have? Do you think we can<br />
sui-port another car manufacturer or another two car<br />
maniifacturers? Å P : KE : IINISTER: I would think that Japanese types of cars<br />
l i cei: tainly be desirable because of their size, their<br />
economy, their safety. There is reason to hope that the<br />
Japane-se companies would be more flexible in terms of<br />
location and Australian participation.<br />
QUESTION: Will you table or release the Consultants report on<br />
which tne second airport decision in Sydney was based?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: When this one is received, I expect so. I<br />
won't give an undertaking but I would expect we will release<br />
it. QUESTION: Supplementary to a matter you mentioned a moment ago,<br />
you said you had reason to hope that Japanese manufacturers<br />
would be more amenable towards location and Australian equity.<br />
Have they given some indication in this regard?<br />
PRI1. E MINISTER: There have been discussions between the<br />
Department of Secondary Industry and the Japanese companies in<br />
the last eight weeks.<br />
QUESTION: Have they indicated what level of Australian<br />
participation or equity they would agree to?<br />
PRIE MINISTER: I haven't been party to the discussions.<br />
You had better get them from Dr Cairns.<br />
QUESTION: Is there any desire to influence the Japanese<br />
manufacturers to move into the growth centres like Albury-Wodonga?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: That would be a very welcome initiative by<br />
them. Borg-Warner, as you know, already operates in Aibury/<br />
Wodonga. There is, therefore, a very considerable component<br />
industry already in that location. I would imagine that any<br />
further automotive industries in Albury/ Wodonga would be very<br />
well situated indeed. Albury/ Wodonga is an excellent<br />
distribution centre.<br />
QUESTION: The Coombs Report said that the tax deductibility of<br />
life assurance and superannuation premiums was both unfair and<br />
also pretty pointless. We now find that the A. I. D. C. scheme<br />
is to be fairly closely nailed into these tax deductibility<br />
provisions. Does this mean that we will be locked into the<br />
life assurance deductions for quite some time? PRIME MINISTER: You read the Policy Speech and you will see<br />
that that was forecast.<br />
QUESTION: Is the Government going to change the composition<br />
of the Board of the D. C.?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: It nasn't been considered. I don't believe<br />
that the amendments that we are proposing provides for an<br />
amendment to the Board, but you had better ask Dr Cairns or<br />
Mr Crean for the details there.<br />
QUESTION: Could you tell me whether t. e are any cihanges<br />
planned for the provisions made for audi' the A. I. D. C.' s<br />
accounts? PRIME MINISTER: I don't think this was considered but ask<br />
them for the details. I don't remember tat.<br />
QUESTION: In view of the confirmation by the Attor.. ey-General<br />
of the existence of the Melbourne Minute Men or Secret Seventy<br />
or Black Friday Movement or whatever, howe\ er you describe<br />
the vigilante force which has set itself . p in Melbourne, can<br />
you tell us whether this disturbes you at all; can you tell<br />
us if you intend to do anything about it; and, in particular,<br />
can you tell us if in view of ASIO's apparent participation<br />
in the early stages of this group if you are quite hanpy that<br />
ASIO can, if you like, be trusted to -cep t-em uror<br />
surveillance and to report honestly to tin Gvernment on their<br />
activities? PRIME MINISTER: I think ASIO has made improvements but<br />
I am considering the general situation o' Australian<br />
Government's intelligence services. As yj,. realise, it is not<br />
the practice to go into any details on tLcese matters, and I<br />
have had to tell you that beforehand, al. predecessors have<br />
told you, so I don't have to repeat it.<br />
QUESTION: Mr Prime Minister, since Ott-a a ave you had any<br />
messages of goodwill from Mr Lee Kuan Ye:" c: Mr Heath and,<br />
furthermore, would you regard your inter-hmnges with them at<br />
Ottawa as tart and unfriendly or would you rather thinh, as<br />
they have been described, or would you rzther think ti. . t they<br />
were directed straight at Mr Heath on multi-nationals<br />
particularly? PRIME MINISTER: I have got no more to say on this at all, and<br />
it is quite false to give any impression that the Commonwealth<br />
Conference was at all engaged for any length of time of such<br />
bilateral matters.<br />
QUESTION: You said that the existence of this private spy<br />
force in Melbourne disturbes you<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I won't say any more on it. I don't answer<br />
questions on security matters </p>
<p>-4-<br />
QUESTION: But I don't want to ask you about that in particular,<br />
Prime Minister, I want to ask you whether or not you saw any<br />
parallel between that and the Secret Government which<br />
Dr Jonn Burton says existed in that intelligence sort of system<br />
under the last Labor Government?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I don't want to say any more about this.<br />
QUESTION: In is policy speech on the Budget, Mr Crean said<br />
that interest on home loans would become deductible from the<br />
Ist July next year but he didn't give details. Can we presume<br />
from that that the rate of deductibility and the scale of wages<br />
that it applies to will be the same as that pledged by you<br />
during the campaign?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: There might be some adjustments because of<br />
changes in average incomes since then but there will be a<br />
graduated scale of deductions.<br />
QUESTION: Sir, pollution from these nuclear tests. Can you<br />
tell us which has been the worst, the Chinese or the French,<br />
and, in fact, has there been any substantial evidence of<br />
fall-out at all from either?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: At this stage, there is evidence of fall-out<br />
from the French tests and not from the Chinese tests. I haven't<br />
looked into this for a few days, maybe a week, but at last<br />
inquiry that was the position.<br />
QUESTION: Anything to worry about?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I believe all fall-out is something to worry<br />
about. QUESTION: Can you tell us why you are not prepared to discuss<br />
ASIO with the representatives of the Australian media when<br />
you will talk about it at length with a visiting Pom?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Mr Forst didn't ask questions as to what we<br />
would be doing in future or that sort of thing. I adhere to<br />
what I believe is the proper policy of not discussing what is<br />
to be done about security services.<br />
QUESTION: I think this comes within the area that Mr Frost<br />
raised. There is an obvious conflict of reporting between what<br />
Mr Darbour says occurred at the Lodge on March 17 and your own<br />
repudiation, a repudiation which Mr Barbour confirms. In the<br />
light of the fact that Mr Barbour's reports must have considerable<br />
effect on the career of public servants, have you taken any<br />
steps to see that the reporting of ASIO is improved?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: There was an earlier instance of an ASIO report<br />
which was inaccurate concerning other public servants. This<br />
was a specific instance and you know how I acted. QUESTION: Does this mean you will act in the same way in<br />
this case?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: If there are any specific instances there<br />
was no involved in any of the reports which I saw on this<br />
subject. QUESTIOI: I thought you were involved, Sir?<br />
PRIKE !..' irTTRER: Yes, well that's been disposed of hasn't it?<br />
QUESTI',:: . ay I ask why you do not regard this incident as<br />
speci f:<br />
PRI. lE M,!' I-STER: I will not pursue questions and answers on<br />
tni. Thctr is still a Senate Committee enquiring into<br />
these r., ice rs.<br />
QUESTIC:;.: Sir, you refer to multi-nationals. Do you see any<br />
connection between the steady decline in the Stock Exchanges<br />
of Australia and the multi-nationals and their investors in<br />
Australia? PRIME M: INISTER: I'm not an expert on the Stock Exchange movements<br />
and I don't have a comment to offer on t. iat.<br />
QUESTION: You were asked a question earlier on the Goiston<br />
Gorge. PRIME MINISTER: No, the Galston sub-region.<br />
QUESTIONER: Yes, well that's right. What you said was that you<br />
were going to get a report on the Galston sub-region. Now,<br />
Mr Edwards asked, and if he didn't, what I would like to ask<br />
is will you release the feasibility study which says Sydney needs<br />
a second airport, not the one w. hich is going to come about<br />
after they have looked at Galston, but why we have to go out<br />
of Mascot to Galston?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: The only report which has<br />
been about Mascot. As we all know, Mascot<br />
to anybody within range of it, so there is<br />
that. been made so far has<br />
is not acceptable<br />
no point in pursuing<br />
QUESTION: Prime Minister, can I ask you what happens as far<br />
as our post in Paris is concerned now that you are appointing<br />
Mr Renouf as the Secretary of the Department. Do you plan to<br />
replace Australia's ambassador to Paris and, if so, when?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I'm not sure when, but it will be fairly soon.<br />
QUESTION: The post is vacant at the moment though, isn't it? </p>
<p>PRI. ME MINISTER: No, I think he hasn't left there yet. But<br />
clearly there are approaches to be made to the French Government<br />
about any new ambassador and those approaches have not yet<br />
been made.<br />
QUESTION: Mr Whitlam, could I just return to the question<br />
on lascot. You said that it is not acceptable to anyone there.<br />
PRIE MINISTER: Yes. I think it is obvious that no Australian<br />
Government will increase the air movements at Mascot.<br />
QUESTION: The size of the Government investment you are<br />
prepared to write off at this stage because of the social<br />
costs involved.<br />
PRIE !-iINISTER: No, there is no suggestion to write off<br />
the investment in Mascot, but it would not be acceptable to<br />
increase the investment in Mascot in such a way as to make for<br />
more aircraft movements there.<br />
QUESTION: Wdsn't that what Mr Jones suggested, however, Sir?<br />
PRIME ? INISTER: A report wanted a decision on that question<br />
befor: th committee wanted a decision on that question,<br />
about ilascot, before it went on to consider alternative sites.<br />
The decision not. to have Mascot has been made, and we have<br />
asked t. ve committee to consider the site which the Department<br />
uf Urban and regional Development regards as the best.<br />
QUESTION: 1r Whitlam, does that mean that the other sites<br />
whic: h-, are intended to be considered by the Consultants earlier<br />
this year won't now be considered?<br />
PRIt2 1INISTER: They certainly won't be considered until the<br />
repar: on the Galston sub-region is received. If that report<br />
snous that Galston sub-region is satisfactory, then it is<br />
quite like&gt;.' that the other sites will not be considered. There<br />
are three g-. neral objections to other sites. There's the<br />
double ! 4ascot or to install a ncw airport at Tara Point or at<br />
Watta: rolla. Wo all know that the people in the area of those<br />
three airports would not tolerate new airports or a larqcr<br />
airport. Then in general, there are some nites suggested to<br />
the north-west of Sydney. Any of those sites would preclude<br />
the developrient of Sydney as proposed along that north-west<br />
corriclar. Similarly, along the south-west corridor, and this<br />
reall. leaves Galston or maybe Duffy's Forest. But Duffy's Forest<br />
would be too small. If you had a second airport there, before<br />
long you would have to have a third airport. Then there were<br />
some other ones which are surely precluded by distance; like<br />
Somersby or Wyong.<br />
QUESTION: But there are people at Galston as well as Wattamolla,<br />
bu they are Liberal voters? PRIME MINISTER: There are fewer people in the Galston area<br />
than in any other area and Galston doesn't lend itself to the<br />
development such as is proposed by both Australian Government<br />
and State Government authorities in the north-west and the<br />
south-west corridor.<br />
QUESTION: The public are rather perplexed about tie issue of<br />
the costs and benefits of foreign ownership of Australian<br />
resources. The only public document that sets out the case<br />
in any detail was by the Treasury last year which says that<br />
foreign ownership wasn't such a bad thing. Now, in view of<br />
the fact that the Government is going to spend really massive<br />
amounts of money raising Australian control of Australian<br />
resources, is it possible that we could'have a statement setting<br />
out why foreign control is a bad thing?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I think the increasing proportion of foreign<br />
control is a bad thing. I would think everybody in the Government<br />
accepts that and most of the people in the Opposition too.<br />
There is no doubt that Sir John McEwen and Mr Gorton and, as<br />
well as the Labor Party, would agree that it is undesirable<br />
to have the increase in foreign control that has taken place in<br />
manufacturing industry every since the war particularly, of<br />
course, in automobiles and petrol and chemicals and base<br />
metal and, also which has taken place in the sixties in our<br />
mineral resources.<br />
QUESTION: Can you tell me from what date does Mr Hawke take<br />
up his position on the Reserve Bank Board, whom does he replace,<br />
and whether you can see any areas where conflict of interest<br />
could arise or where, in reverse, he can be of benefit?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I don't know the date. I would think that<br />
there will be fewer conflicts of interest as far as Mr Hawke<br />
is concerned than as far as any of the other members of the<br />
Board. Mr Hawke, clearly, has economic qualifications superior<br />
to those of pretty well any other non-official member of the<br />
Board except perhaps Professor Bruce Williams.<br />
QUESTION: Are you concerned about the rate of growth of the<br />
Commonwealth Public Service?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: No, I'm told it will be kept to 5 per cent.<br />
This financial year it will be a bit tight but it will be hept<br />
to 5 per cent, so I am advised. There will be some departments<br />
where clearly there will be a drop as in the Defence departments<br />
and some where there will be a smaller increase than 5 per cent<br />
such as Taxation or Customs and Excise. The increases are<br />
mainly in new departments. We are, however, pressing on with<br />
the amalgamation of several departments. </p>
<p>-7-<br />
QUESTION: Have you any comment on Mr Cameron' s view that all<br />
Se-cond Division jobs should be advertised outside the<br />
Public Service?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: It's an interesting thought. I don't preclude<br />
the fact that positions in the Second Division should be open<br />
to outsiders. There are arguments both ways.<br />
QUESTION: You mentioned a series of Bills on off-shore<br />
pol_ 1lution. Is this likely to strengthen your hand on the<br />
Constitutional position in the off-shore resources legislation?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I would think so.<br />
QUESTION: Will the new Organisation set up under the A. I. D. C.<br />
umbrella place directors on the boards of companies in which<br />
i~ t takes an interest, and will these directors be under the<br />
control of the Australian Parliament or the Cabinet?<br />
PRIME _ MINIFTMR: I think it would be better if you go to Mr Crean<br />
or Dr Cairns for details like this. I don't think this was<br />
discussed. There can be various conditions laid down for<br />
A. I. D. C. participation on buying an existing enterprise or<br />
setting up a new one. To have nominees on the board would seen<br />
a very reasonable proposition, but I don't think this was<br />
-spelt out inl the submission to us or in the decision.<br />
QUESTION: Are you planning a reshuffle or a limited reshuffle<br />
of tne Government.<br />
PR~ IME MINISTER: I'm not sure when. I'll tell you when or if.<br />
QUESTION: Has the Government received the Wool Marketing<br />
Report from the Wool Corporation yet?<br />
PRI. ME MINISTER: No. The Cabinet hasn't considered it.<br />
QUESTION: Some of the new Bills that you have foreshadowedtnere<br />
are some c uite inrportant ones seem-to be based quite<br />
explicitly on the use of the foreign affairs power under our<br />
Constitution to ratify a international agreement or convention.<br />
Do you see any limits to that type of process or would you be<br />
prepared to express a degree of confidence about how the High<br />
Court might treat it under challenge?<br />
PRIME 14INISTER: I would be confident that the Australian<br />
Parliament's constitutional powers in respect'. to external<br />
affairs enable this parliament to pass laws on many more subjects<br />
than it has hitherto. very obviously, matters such as I have<br />
mentioned this afternoon in the maritime field are such matters.<br />
It's one way of overcoming the absurd situation where the<br />
Australian Parliament can't pass laws about shipping in the<br />
course of voyages between a port and another port in the same<br />
State and where the State Parliament concerned can't pass laws<br />
on that subject either except with the approval of the British<br />
Government. Now, there are, increasingly, international<br />
conventions dealing with all these matters, and international conventions can Only be drafted by Australian Government<br />
representatives on behalf of Australia and can only be ratified<br />
by Australian Government representatives on behalf of<br />
Australia. Clearly this is a field where if Australia is to<br />
ensure proper standards as regards navigation or pollution<br />
or, in a related matter, off-shore resources, there -dill be<br />
many more Conventions; there will be many more lawspassed<br />
by the Australian Parliament.<br />
QUESTION: Will you just give us some idea, at this stage,<br />
wiiat you hope can be achieved at the Constitutional Convention<br />
next week?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: I think you ought to wait until next Monday<br />
when I have been asked to address the Convention. I suppose<br />
I can say now, that the matters which I would hope the<br />
Convention would give consideration to next week, are those which<br />
can be done promptly. There are some matters which wouldI<br />
require a referendun. This Parliament can pass a bill for a<br />
referendum and that bill can be put to the people at the next<br />
general election. Secondly, there are many matters upon which<br />
the State Parliaments which they can refer to this Parliament.<br />
And thirdly, there is the very important question of amending<br />
the Financial Agreement of 1927. The Government is committed to<br />
securing a voice and a vote for local government representatives<br />
from each State on the Loan Council. This is a matter which<br />
the Hfeads of Government at next week's Convention couldl agree<br />
to do straight away. I hope they do.<br />
QUESTION: Do you see it very much as a working Convention?<br />
PRIME MINISTER: Yes, I would wan*, something practical to come<br />
out of the Convention. And there would be some matters which<br />
I would be very happy to put to a referendum at the next general<br />
election which must take place before the end of next June.<br />
Secondly, I would be very happy for the State Parliaments,<br />
particularly the big ones, New South Wales and Victoria, to<br />
refer scme matters to the Australian Parliament. And thirdly,<br />
