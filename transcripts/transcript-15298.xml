<p>Well CDF, Colonel Rawlins, ladies and gentlemen I've come here to do a very simple thing and that is to say on behalf of all Australians whatever their views are on different issues that they admire very much the dedicated job that you are doing here in Iraq.  Personally, can I say I am so impressed with the way in which Australian soldiers all around the world and particularly here in Iraq have been able to balance a capacity to throw a military punch with an ability to help the local people realise their future hopes and aspirations. Our mission here in Iraq is to create a situation where the Iraqis can look after themselves.  </p>
<p>No nation wants foreign soldiers on its soil indefinitely.  No nation wants to be in a foreign country indefinitely, but we have a job to do, we have a job to create a situation where the Iraqis can grab hold of a reasonably democratic future and our mission is to create the situation where we see in the future an Iraq that can provide its own security; can provide its own governance infrastructure and the way in which you ladies and gentlemen are doing that, the way in which you are relating to the locals, winning their confidence, demonstrating that Australia has a particular brand.  I mean there is an Australian brand here in Iraq which is different from the brand of any other coalition nation.  I don't say that critically of our friends the United States and Britain and the coalition partners, but as we all know there is an Australian way of doing things.  We think, just quietly, it's the best way of doing things and I think you are demonstrating that very, very effectively.  </p>
<p>I wanted to say as the head of the Government, as the person who in the end was responsible for sending you here, and in the process perhaps making life uncomfortable, life is even dangerous on occasions for you.  I do greatly respect the professionalism of the men and women of the Australian Defence Forces and I respect not only their military skill which is world renowned, but I also respect the capacity you have to win the confidence of people, because it's a brand which is respected, and it's a brand that is very distinctive, and it's a brand that is composed of goodwill and a decency and a respect for the customs of others, but it's also a brand that where necessary carries a wallop and you need the two.  </p>
<p>My fellow Australians you do it better than any others and I am very proud of you and the nation respects you enormously and I wanted to say that to you personally.  We are doing our best to look after your families and your loved ones back home, and if there is anything extra you need, please tell me.  I always do that when I come to these places, and I mean, I think my good friend the Treasurer sometimes blanches when I go on these operations because he can see the defence budget getting bigger but if it needs to get bigger it will get bigger because there is nothing more important than making sure that the men and women we send abroad in our name are given all the support that they reasonably require and I don't want to say anymore except again, thank you.  I want to get around and meet as many of you as I possibly can, but I respect you, I respect your commanding officers and you are doing a great job in the name of our country and you have my gratitude for that.  Thank you. </p>
