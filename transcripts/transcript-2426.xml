PRESS, RADIO AND TV CONFERENCE GIVEN'-BY<br />
THETPIVIMI fNYTE-M W[ IEAI McNAHO<br />
AT PARLTA METFH-OUSE, CANBERRA 27 MAY 1971<br />
PRIME MINISTER : Before I ask you to ask questions, I would like to make three<br />
announcements to you, and they all relate to Government policy. The first one<br />
is that Mr. Peter Howson will be appointed the Minister in charge of the new<br />
portfolio. Yesterday afternoon, I had an audience with His Excellency the<br />
Governor-General and he agreed to commission Mr. Howson on Monday, probably<br />
at three o'clock. I have already stated the functions of the portfolio in the House, but if<br />
you want to get complete details so that you can use them tomorrow morning, they<br />
will be available from Mr. MacDonald, my Press Secretary. The name of the<br />
Department will be the Environment, Aborigines and the Arts, and I hope that<br />
Mr. Howson will be able to take up the appointment quickly and come to grips<br />
with many of the problems that are so urgently in need of being answered and<br />
solved. The second one relates to our Repatriation system. For some time<br />
now, many organisations, many reputable ones, and particularly the Returned<br />
Servicemen's League, have asked for an independent enquiry into the repatriation<br />
system its objectives and its rationale and we have agreed to the independent<br />
enquiry. Later on today, I will be issuing a press statement about it and all<br />
the details relating to principle will be contained in that press statement.<br />
Subsequently, of course, we will have to appoint the independent authority and<br />
then draft the terms of reference. These will be announced as soon as we can<br />
by the Minister for Repatriation himself.<br />
. And the third one relates to our contribution to the East Pakistan<br />
refugees that is those who are going into India. The Government has agreed this<br />
morning that we will contribute $ 500, 000 to the East Pakistan refugee organisation<br />
in Calcutta, of which $ 200, 000 will be made available immediately, and after<br />
discussion with the Calcutta authorities, the other $ 30-0, 000 will be made available<br />
as and when it is needed. The initial $ 200, 000 will be a cash grant to the Red<br />
Cross, a certain amount of money for medical supplies that are desperately<br />
needed, and the third amount will be for temporary accommodation such as tents<br />
which have been asked for by the refugee authorities themselves. This is, as you<br />
know, a tremendously serious affair with over three million refugees moving from<br />
the North-East of Pakistan into India. We have expressed our great sorrow at<br />
what has happened and we hope by this means that we will be able to make some<br />
contribution to the assistance of the refugees themselves.<br />
Now having said all that, may I ask those who want to ask questions<br />
either to please stand up or put up their hands and I will call them in turn.<br />
Q. In announcing the appointment of Mr. Howson, you made no reference<br />
to the appointment of the Assistant Ministers whom the Parliament also approved<br />
the appointment of. When will you be appointing these? / 2 </p>
<p>PM I can't finalise the decision relating to the Assistant Ministers until<br />
Mr. Anthony returns. I had discussions with him a few days before he left but<br />
he wasn't in a position to announce those Assistant Ministers whom he wanted to<br />
appoint, and so I will have to leave it for the time being. But I have decided that<br />
Ministers to assist other Ministers will be appointed in two cases. The first one<br />
Is that the Minister in Charge of the House, that is Mr. Swartz, Minister for<br />
National Development will have a Minister assisting him. And Mr. Snedden will<br />
have a Minister assisting him as well. In the first case it will be Mr. Chipp, who<br />
will also be the Deputy Leader in the House, and in the case of Mr. Snedden, it will<br />
be Mr. Andrew Peacock. These are the only appointments I can announce at the<br />
moment. In Mr. Snedden' s case, I think you will agree that it has to be done so that<br />
the Minister assisting him will be able to go right through the Budget papers and<br />
help him not only in the preparation but in the presentation of the papers to the<br />
Cabinet.<br />
Q. So we will have another six Assistant Ministers on top of these two<br />
assisting Ministers....<br />
PM. Well one is Assistant Minister and that is an official title. The other<br />
is a Minister of State who will be assisting another Minister.<br />
Q. Well Assistant Ministers, how many of those are we going to get?<br />
PM. Well I don't know yet. I haven't made up my mind, but I will be<br />
discussing this when Mr. Anthony returns.<br />
Q. Does Mr. Peacock's appointment in this role, Sir, mean that you will<br />
not have a Minister of State assisting you?<br />
PM. At the moment. I want to give him greater experience. He is an able<br />
bloke and I think it is wise to put him into different portfolios to get the experience,<br />
and in particular I think he vwill do well in the Treasury with Mr. Snedden.<br />
Q. In the context of the appointment of the Minister will it mean an<br />
increase in the Public Service?<br />
PM No.<br />
Q. I can recall Mr. Gorton said there would be no further recruitment.<br />
PM I haven't yet approved off any increases in the Public Service because<br />
of the action taken.<br />
Q. Sir, reverting to your first announcement does the change in title and<br />
your description of its functions mean that the Executive Council Secretariat will<br />
not now be moved from Prime Minister's Department as originally planned?<br />
PM I think you can take it that the probability is that the Secretariat of<br />
the Executive Council will remain with the Prime Minister's Department. But it<br />
is not of great importance or significance, and in deference to the wishes of the<br />
Governor-General the probabilities are I will leave it with the Prime Minister's<br />
I haven't made up my mind about it. / 3 </p>
<p>Q. That means that Mr. Howson will be Vice-President of the Executive<br />
Council?<br />
PM No.<br />
Q. Sir, will he be No. 27 in the order of priority?<br />
PM Yes.<br />
Q. Can I open up another topic, Prime Minister? On May 11 you<br />
announced the Federal Government had decided to try to initiate dialogue with<br />
the People's Republic of China. What steps have you taken since then to initiate<br />
this dialogue?<br />
PM We have taken steps to open up the dialogue, but this is one occasion<br />
where quiet diplomacy is essential. If we were to divulge the source that we<br />
have approached in order to open up the dialogue, we think it could do harm.<br />
And as I have said, and I want to repeat this we want to do this carefully. We<br />
want to measure every step we have taken, and to consider the gains for this<br />
country. And every step taken will be in terms of a profit and loss account and<br />
we want to see that that turns out for the benefit of Australia. So I have got to<br />
handle this with the maximum of subtlety and caution, and I am unable at the<br />
moment, anyhow, to mention the area where we have opened up the initiative.<br />
Q. Again on China, Sir, doesn't the sale by BHP of $ 6-1 million worth<br />
of pig iron represent a cut across the Strategic List?<br />
PM No it does not. And I have made that plain already. It does not cut<br />
across the Strategic List in any way. Every part of the supply by the BHP to<br />
Mainland China can be provided from other sources. And if we don't do it, someone<br />
else will.<br />
Q. Sir, can you say whether you have had anything that you can consider<br />
a response at all to your announcements for the Government's desire for<br />
dialogue?<br />
PM Yes, we have had a response. VWe have had at least two responses.<br />
Q. Mr. Prime Minister, you have stated quite secret sources and<br />
careful and quiet diplomacy...<br />
PM I didn't say " secret sources" I didn't use those words. " Quiet<br />
diplomacy" I said.<br />
Q. Any chance that this same quiet diplomacy can be used in trying<br />
to get access to new information about the Australian journalist Francis James?<br />
PM In time, perhaps, but we had already approached other sources ' who<br />
had immediate contacts with the Peking Government and asked if they would make<br />
further enquiries for us about Francis James. They informed us, after some<br />
delay, that they thought it was better that we went elsewhere to try and get the<br />
information. / 4 </p>
<p>Q. Sir, are you considering Government, as distinct from private trade<br />
missions to China, to deal with commodities other than wheat?<br />
PM Not at the moment. I can't answer that question in fact, but we are,<br />
as I said in the statement I made in the H ouse, giving visas to private<br />
interests to go and over one hundred Australians went to the Canton Trade Fair,<br />
and we can at least account for $ 12 to $ 15 million worth of contracts from this<br />
source.<br />
Q. Sir, you have said you have had at least two responses from China.<br />
Have they been positive ones? Do you feel that the Chinese are interested in<br />
dialogue with us<br />
PM I can't tell you that. They have been probing enquiries.<br />
Q. Sir, are the responses from China or from a third party that we are<br />
dealing with?<br />
PM I won't go any further than I have gone at the moment, because as I<br />
said, if ever there is a case where we need quiet diplomacy, if we want to be<br />
successful, this is the occasion.<br />
Q. Can you take it this far, Sir? Can you say whether they are at a<br />
significantly high level?<br />
PM No, I will go no further, Mir. Reid.<br />
Q. Mr. Snedden was reported earlier this week as saying it would be a<br />
tough Budget. You are reported in this month's issue of the " Australian Liberal"<br />
as having said the same thing either to the State Council or the N. S. W. State<br />
Liberal Party. Have you discussed this with Mr. Snedden2<br />
PM First, I never used the words " a tough Budget" anywhere. I certainly<br />
didn't use it at 8-private meeting of Liberal Party members. Secondly, Mr. Snedden<br />
is in control of the Budget, and it is up to him to use the descriptions that he thinks<br />
are best. After all, I believe in Ministerial responsibility, subject, of course, to<br />
overall control by the Prime Minister and by the Cabinet. But it is his Ministerial<br />
responsibility to conduct the public relations associated with the Budget and I want<br />
to make no comment about it whatsoever.<br />
Q. Mr. Prime Minister, following this, do you think it is wise to have your<br />
Treasurer making comments on the nature of the Budget so far ahead? In this case,<br />
one has to think of the concern this has caused the business community.<br />
PM I think Mr. Snedden was wise in making the statement he did at the<br />
time he made it. Equally, too, did he make a statement today or tonight I am<br />
not quite sure when he is making it to the manufacturers. I approved of it, and<br />
those who have good memories should compare it. with the statement I made in<br />
the House of March of this year. You would think we were both making the same<br />
speech.<br />
Q. Does this mean then, that the nature of the Budget is going to be divulged<br />
in advance... </p>
<p>PM No it does not. I don't think Mr. Snedden will be making any more<br />
speeches about this. What you have got to remember is that up until the present<br />
moment, we have no papers whatsoever in frort of the Cabinet or the Cabinet<br />
Secretariat.<br />
Q. You have said that the rate of inflation in Australia is now running at<br />
over 5% per year and this is an increase that is almost double of what it was about<br />
two years ago. Is this Government now prepared to live with this rate of inflation<br />
or does it want to cut back on inflation.<br />
PM Of course we want to cut back on inflation. In a country like ours that<br />
is a very big exporter, and has to compete in the international markets against<br />
the international giants, and particularly, too, in the case of a country that has<br />
so many primary producers dependent upon their income for the export of their<br />
own products, the lower we can get inflation, the better it is for them. Now our<br />
position is different to any other country, and it is no use saying that relatively<br />
our position is better than others. That is not the answer in our circumstances<br />
and we have got to do everything we can to get dovn the rate of inflation to<br />
something that is lower than increases in prcoductivity.<br />
Q. In January or February this year, the G. vernment, as it was,<br />
announced decisions which wver: e ainiad at redkucinrg Is the C vcmrnmeit<br />
now satisfied that thesc h . d some effect or does it sc; il believe that further<br />
measures will be necessary?<br />
PM I think your words are the best description that I can give of it<br />
" satisfied that they are having their effect"... I can't better those words.<br />
That is the best I can say about it. But of course we coulddo better and if we could<br />
get inflationary pressures down, and we could have the consumer index reduced,<br />
we would want it. This is the biggest problem we face at the moment in the<br />
economic field, and we must do everything we can in order to see that the<br />
pressures are reduced. But I do not believe that any measures, any other measures<br />
will be needed until the Budget. And if I can say this in one area that is<br />
monetary policy and interest rate policy I believe we have been pretty successful<br />
because now we find we will have a Budget surplus, an internal Budget surplus of<br />
$ 450 million we thought a few months ago it would be ever so mu. h lower. We<br />
think that the interest rate structure now, subject to movement of anomalies from<br />
time to time, is just about right. And thefact that we had $ 193 million contribution<br />
to the recent Loan and a large number of subsc. rptions to the Loan that has just<br />
ended is, I think, a remarkably successful res:-it from the Governmnts point<br />
of view. I could say more about this problem of monetary control because I think<br />
it is acting well, but I think oiiher questions have got to be asked before we get<br />
into that.<br />
Q. Sir, well on that very point, on the Loan result, when he announced it,<br />
Mr. Snedden did say there was some evidence, not precise evidence, he said, that<br />
the result was not a matter of foreign money chasing high interest rates it was<br />
the first indicaticn, in fact, of the new measurement of capital inflow. Can you<br />
actually say where the foreign money is coming from? / 6 </p>
<p>PM I think we can, but Mr. Snedden's description was the best one. From<br />
a Treasury point of view, and from a detailed economic analysis point of view, the<br />
word " precise" is the accurate word to use. But I remember the time when I was<br />
in the Treasury, I instructed the Reserve Bank to devise better means of<br />
determining both the origins and the components of capital inflows. And we<br />
strengthened what was called the ticket system, that is the system used by the<br />
private trading banks and the Commonwealth Bank under which they ticked off<br />
various entries in tickets, and when money was received in Australia and sent<br />
them to the Reserve Bank. And that was an indication but only an indication<br />
of both source and component. At the same time, we asked additional questions<br />
when approval was required for the moment of funds into Australia. And I think<br />
you can take it that of the components, and no more than the components, that<br />
a large amount of the money was in terms of private investment. A large amount<br />
was because of the maturity of the Australian money market system and Australian<br />
corporations have been able to borrow large sums particularly in the United<br />
States. This is called iustitutional loans. It is obvious, too, that there isn ' t a<br />
great deal in portfolio investment because if there was the Stock Exchange would<br />
be rising and not falling. Other amounts, too, are what are called lags. We do<br />
find that, wisely, Australian importers are now delaying payment for the goods<br />
that they have purchased and this is another reason why the capital inflow is<br />
somewha,-t bigger than you would have otherwise expected. In other words, while<br />
we can't get the figures accurately enough for statistical purposes, at least we<br />
have got a pretty good idea that there isn't very much hot money involved.<br />
Q. Bearing in mind your recent statement that the Government wanted<br />
the South African rugby and cricket tours to go ahead as planned, and that<br />
Mr. Whitlam has been rather silent on this in the last few weeks, and some trade<br />
unions in recent days have said they would not ban the tours, do you expect there<br />
will now be little difficulty with the South Africans touring this country and staying<br />
at the hotels, and if there are some bans by the unions that affect the tours, has<br />
the Government promised to make Government air transport available to get the<br />
tours around the country?<br />
PM I have made one statement and that is that we want the tour to go on<br />
and we will do nothing which is likely to obstruct it. If it so happens that an<br />
attempt is made by Mr. Hawke to obstruct it, then, of course, we will look at<br />
the position and decide whether the Government is to take action. But that is<br />
hypothetical. But can I now that you have opened up this subject, state the<br />
Government's policy clearly to you. First of all, we don't believe in the<br />
interference in the affairs of other countries as we resent other countries<br />
interfering in our affairs. Secondly, we b~ ilieve that politics ought to be divorced<br />
from your sporting and recreational, artistic and other cultural types of activity.<br />
I don't believe, and no-one in my Government believes, that an ACTU or any<br />
political party should interfere in what are purely domestic matters. For this<br />
reason, we feel the tour should go on, and I believe this is the wish of the great<br />
majority of the Australian people. A Gallup Poll was decisive in saying that the<br />
people wanted it. The Queenslander view was more than decisive, and<br />
consequently, I believe the tour should continue. And I will continue, too, in<br />
this way. We don't like apartheid, and I made this clear and the Australian<br />
people's feelings clear to the South African Government. But we don't think that<br />
clumsy methods, methods that depend upon intimidation are every likely to be<br />
successful. On the contrary, they are likely to be counter -productive. And I </p>
<p>think the-attitude taken by so many African States now Malawi, Sierra Leone,<br />
Lesotho is the right course to follow they are but a few of the countries I can<br />
mention. They believe the proper way to handle this problem is by dialogue and<br />
by co-operation. Those are phrases I heard used by the President of Malawi<br />
myself, and I think if we want to get a solution to this problem, we had better leave<br />
it in their hands rather than the clumsy methods that I mentioned just a few moments<br />
ago.<br />
Q. Do you think Mr. Hawke should have corresponded direct with<br />
Mr. Vorster?<br />
PM That is Mr. Haweke's business. I don't want to make any comment<br />
about him. But if the previous implication can be implied as aimned at Mr. Hawke,<br />
then you are entitled to make the implication.<br />
Q. Qantas was held to-ransom for half a million dollars yesterday. It is<br />
a Federal Government airline the Federal Government is in charge of Civil<br />
Aviation. The New South Wiales Government has today offered a reward and your<br />
Government hasn't. Do you have any plans along these lines?<br />
PM Yes. We have decided to offer in addition to the New South Wales<br />
Government a reward of $ 30, 000D.<br />
Q. On that subject, are you involved otherwise than in the offering of<br />
a reward. As you ultimately, through the Treasury, will be the donor of the<br />
$ 500, 000 that was paid, have you any views on the course of action that Qantas<br />
adopted in this?<br />
PM No, I haven't. When I was telephoned by my Press Officer at the<br />
Governor-General's residence yesterday, at round about 5. 40, my first thought<br />
was for the safety of the passengers and the crew. And I consequently felt I<br />
should get the senior civil servants into my office immediately and as many<br />
Ministers as I could who were in Canberra, and I contemplated getting Billy<br />
Snedden back from the Treasurer back from Melbourne, so that we could<br />
discuss it. But then I find in my first telephone conversation with Sir Donald<br />
Anderson of Civil Aviation that the decision had been made.<br />
Q. Have you got any viewis or, the....<br />
PM No, I have got no viewis. i will leave that for Mr. Cotton to handle<br />
with the Treasurer and they will have to put up any thoughts they wish to me.<br />
Q. Prime Minister, to get back to the China dialogue for a minute. In<br />
viewi of the Government' s initiatives, do you think they could receive any setback<br />
by the Labor Party mission which is to visit there next month?<br />
PM I don't think so. The Chi nese are calm and collected people in making<br />
these decisions. Increasingly the power in the hierarchy seems to be shifting to<br />
the professional officials and away from those engaged in the Cultural Revolution.<br />
And if the power structure is altering, we feel that the Foreign Office, and<br />
particularly the Premiership, will be handled in a much more subtle way than was<br />
done previously. I don't think they can do very much harm. They may perhaps<br />
be able to do some good. 0 0 0 / 8 </p>
<p>Q. Back on the domestic political scene. There is a group called the<br />
Businessmen for Democratic Government. who apparently doesn't like your reign.<br />
What can you tell us about this group? Do you regard them as a serious threat to<br />
you?<br />
PM No I don't. As you know this is pretty old hat stuff because they tried<br />
it when Mr. Gorton became the Prime Minister and wanted to run my colleague<br />
Alan Fairhall against himn. It petered out fairly quickly.<br />
Q. You don't say who it was...<br />
PM Mr. Pat Sayers. But if you have read the National Times on Sunday,<br />
they had an interview with him and he then stated that his fundamental objective<br />
was to destroy the L~ beral and Country Parties and it wasn't an attack on me<br />
personally. Now he hao disclosed that he is a front for the Labor Party, a front<br />
probably for left wing socialists. And he refuses to deny that of the so-called<br />
Liberals who he says are supporting him, or to confirm whether they are<br />
American concerns, and it is these American concerns that will be providing some<br />
of the funds.<br />
Q. Apropos the Treasurer speaking to the manufacturers, there has been<br />
some suggestion the 20 per cent investment allowa-ce might be restored the<br />
per cent investment allowance that was suspended last February. There was<br />
one report, I think in the " Financial Review" about that. Have you been thinking<br />
along those lines for the Budget?<br />
PM What do you mean? ' That it might be reinstated?<br />
Q. Yes.<br />
PM No, it won' t.<br />
Q. Sir, we have all read " Time Any comment?<br />
PM The " Time" article?<br />
Q. Yes.<br />
PM No, I don't want to comment about it. Personally I wasn't very much<br />
affected by the article. There were some quite complimentary things and others<br />
that were untrue. But my Press-Officer, who is very much like you he belongs<br />
to your group, and to your clan he felt that there was a matter here of<br />
professional ethics involved when there were two statements that were not correct.<br />
On his own initiative, he wrote a letter to " Time" stating what the two mistakes<br />
were. He was right, and frankly, getting to know him better and better every<br />
day, I think the attitude he adopted was the correct one. i other words, he said<br />
he had put some questions to me. He had not done so. Secondly he said that<br />
he asked me a question on Australia in the 1970s. He didn't do so at the formal<br />
discussions, but as he got to the door., and I was moving out to get a plane, he<br />
then asked me the question. I said, " Look, wouldn't it -be better if I got a few<br />
notes for you and you had a word to one of my officials my Private Secretary,<br />
Kim Jones". He said, " Well, perhaps I may". But the " perhaps" was the right<br />
words. He didn't.' / 9 </p>
<p>Q. Prime-Minister, what are your thoughts on the future of Australia?<br />
PM On which?<br />
Q. On the future of Australia.<br />
PM I live here. I am proud of it. I wouldn't want to go anywhere else and<br />
if I was anywhere else, I would want to come here.<br />
Q. Mr. Prime Minister, in the uproar of the last week of the Session of<br />
the House of Representatives, it was the view that this was partly caused by the<br />
bank-up of legislation towards the end of the Session and that you had instituted a<br />
Departmental enquiry into how this could be avoided. How is that enquiry going?<br />
PM We have moved a long way. The first action that has been taken is to<br />
reform our Legislation Committee. Previously the Legislation Committee only<br />
acted to ensure bills brought before the H ouse conformed to the decisions made<br />
by Cabinet. We have now widened its jurisdiction to provide for continuous<br />
programming of bills during the whole of the session of the House. And we want to<br />
ensure that instead of coming in in a rush in the last days of the House, they are<br />
systematically and progressively introduced as the House proceeds. Now you know<br />
just as well as I do that this has been a problem every since Federation and<br />
that we can't completely overcome the problem, but I think by this method we will<br />
be able to go a long way to get bills introduced in the early and middle parts of<br />
the Session and we will be able to reduce the tensions and the rush right at the end.<br />
The Departmental officials are also looking at the problem of this committee and<br />
what other methods can be taken, and I think you k now that a Party Committee<br />
under Malcolm Fraser has been appointed to I ook at the whole procedures of the<br />
House. We are proceeding steadily. I hope that by the time the House meets we<br />
will be able to say what we think ought to be done. But I have already mentioned<br />
to you the major steps.<br />
Q. Sir, there was a fairly simple way of overcoming the problem created<br />
by the rush of legislation on this creation and that was to have extended the Sittings<br />
of the House by an extra week or two as in fact the Senate finished up doing. Could<br />
you tell us why this wasn't done?<br />
PM Look, that would take me all day. But I will give you three explanations<br />
if you like. The first one was no doubt due to the fact that we had a change in the<br />
leadership of the Liberal-Party and of the Government, and consequently in the<br />
personnel of the Attorney-General and of the Leader of the House. The second<br />
one was that if you look at the bills, you will see that six of them were surrounding<br />
one substantive bill and five of them were a matter of consequential amendments<br />
to other bills. Now the main bill itself, Commonwealth Employees' Compensation<br />
Bill, I put the original elements of the bill on the table of the House when I was<br />
the Treasurer. That is how long ago they have had it, and the Labor Party wanted<br />
it and didn't want any amendments to it, so you count out that six. That left<br />
eleven. We then had three more one on the science blocks which we could very<br />
easily have left, and that reduces it to ten, and thc othtur two were two normnal<br />
orthodox Treasury Bills that are necessary always brought in at this time and<br />
didn't introduce any novel features whatsoever. So we had eight. We had one other<br />
real difficulty. -~ And I don't think we would have struck any real problems but for<br />
this diff iculty. </p>
<p>Normally in a guillotine, it runs on from a particular hour to another particular<br />
hour from 3 o'clock on one day to five o'clock the next day am or pm whichever<br />
you like. On this occasion, we introduced it in the form of so many minutes or<br />
hours for each particular bill and that gave the Opposition a glorious opportunity<br />
in order to exploit the Standing Orders of the House in order to frustrate the<br />
passage of the Government's legislation. But that is past history. That won't<br />
happen again, particularly that type of guillotine. I can assure You of that. What<br />
is important, and it is critically important, is that I do everything in my power to<br />
see that in f uture, there is adequate time and that we schedule the bills<br />
so that we give the important ones plenty of time for discussion and we put them<br />
through the House in accordance with the programme that can be approved of by<br />
the Legislation Committee.<br />
Q. A related question You elaborated your new China policy first in a<br />
press statement after the invitation arrived for the Labor delegation, and then at a<br />
dinner which was originally going to be a private dinner. Why didn't you explain<br />
the Government's China policy to the House of Representatives which rose only a<br />
few days earlier? And don't you think that is what Sir Robert Menzies and possibly<br />
the late Mr. Holt would have done?<br />
PM I don't think he would have done it. I don't think Mr Holt would have done<br />
it and I have heard no comment whatsoever from the Labor Party about it or asked<br />
that it should have been done there. So that is the point. The second point is it was<br />
an enormously important meetLIg of businessmen and commercial people in New<br />
South Wales and I thought it was a suitable opportunity to do it. I wanted it to<br />
receive wide publicity and it did. But above all, I feel that this was a matter of<br />
such.... I wanted to get the widest publicity for it and it did. And I believe that the<br />
overseas reaction to that speech has been as great as any overseas reaction I have<br />
known, certainly known, during the course of the last five years. And it did a lot<br />
of good.<br />
Q. The Senate Committee on Securities and Exchange has been very much in<br />
the news, particularly with this decision calling for brokers' accounts for the last<br />
five years. Are you quite satisfied that the Committee acted properly in doing this?<br />
And if the Committee, in your opinion, overstepped the line, would you initiate<br />
some action?<br />
PM This is a S enate matter and I would not interfere in any -way.<br />
Q. You took a personal hand in negotiations with the Australian Medical<br />
Association over doctors' fees. Last week, the Health Minister announced that<br />
more than 20 per cent of Australian doctors were chargi ng more than the common<br />
fee. Do you not believe that this indicates a breakdown in the Government's<br />
Health Service?<br />
PM I don't think so. But if I can tell you the facts. When I first saw the<br />
bill that would have to be paid for the increase in doctors' fees, it was more than<br />
million, and after negotiations with them, we got it cut down to 3 million<br />
which our own Health authorities thought was reasonable and fair. So if that isn't<br />
an achievement, I don't know what is. Secondly the AMA itself said it would try<br />
and persuade doctors to accept the common fee and they are doing their best to<br />
achieve that objective. Third, in the case of the specialist fees, they will not have<br />
.00/ 11 </p>
<p>an across-the-board increase. Butrwhat they-will do is look at an anomalies and if<br />
they want to get an increase, they have agreed to discuss the facts with us before<br />
they make a decision. All in all, I thii it is a remarkable achievement on the<br />
part of a new Minister and I personally would like to give him a pat on the back here<br />
and now for his achievement. If I could add this to you, I am proud of the three of<br />
them.<br />
Q. The question of the Securities and Exchange Commission apart, do you<br />
believe that with the risc in the influence . and wo-r of ParL-mTentary Committees,<br />
there should be some guidelines set down for the protection of witnesses?<br />
PM I have submitted this to the Attorney-Gneral. He is giving me a report<br />
with the Leader of the House, Mr. Svwart, the Parliament:-y Committee systcm,<br />
particularly as it r-igh,:. te co tihe Hous. Re-:: r sentativp., tieo Constitutional<br />
position and guidelines as well. And also some guidelines relating to protection<br />
of the individual, but I haven't got the report yet and I won't receive it for some<br />
time.<br />
Q. Do you intend to widen the Committee system in the House of<br />
Representatives?<br />
PM Wait until I get the report, please.<br />
Q. The investment allowance, Prime Minister. You said the Government<br />
would not restore it. Various eiements in the business community have been very<br />
anxious that it should be restored, and I would like to know when and why the<br />
Government mace . dee cision not to retore it. What effect do you think this will<br />
have on the Armco steelworks at Jervis Bay?<br />
PM One, we have not made any decision not to restore it. It is suspended.<br />
That is the first point I want to make. The second point the first question I<br />
received was from you, David, David Solomon, relating to inflation. This is one<br />
of tahen ti-in: ion measures that we've gct. And if you look at the latest statistics<br />
relating to invtmn in plant and equiprr. . t from private sources, you will see that<br />
the rise is a littl. bit alarming. And I just add this now, too, the increase<br />
in commercial building and industrial buaii'ng is at boom levels and this has got to<br />
taper off soon or we will have to be asking the indus try why they can't live up to<br />
their promises to us.<br />
Q. I thought you said in answer to an earlier question it would not be<br />
restored.<br />
PM Well I didn't mean permanently. I said perhaps. If I can explain it,<br />
it is suspended. We have made no decision whatsoever with regard to ending the<br />
suspension.<br />
Q. Regarding the Common Market, and Britain's entry. Any opinions or<br />
comment?<br />
PM No, I can't. As you know, in one way or another over $ 360 million<br />
worth of Australian exports into Continental countries EEC countries will be<br />
involved. And it is Mr. Anthony's intention or objective in his present visit to see<br />
what arrangemerts he can make with British and EEC countries to try and get a<br />
better transi.'-nal period as well as making arrangements for our raw materials.<br />
I can't add anything to that. / 12 </p>
<p>Q. Do you accept it as inevitable that Britain will go into the Common Market?<br />
Do you accept that?<br />
PM I would never say that anything is inevitable, but knowing Mr. Heath<br />
as I know him, and I know him very well I know he has got his heart set on it<br />
and he wil be difficult to divert from getting into the EEC.<br />
Q. While you made the point quite effectively that the agreement with the<br />
doctors was very satisfactory from both the Government and the doctors' viewpoint,<br />
can you view it as satisfactory when your own Minister for Health says that<br />
per cent are being charged more than the common fee? Isn't there some deg. ree<br />
of satisfaction needed for the patient as well as for the Government and the doctors?<br />
PM Yes, but there is a lot to be said, Mr. Reid, before you get to that<br />
point of view. I don't like this 20 per cent and if I knew how to handle it, I would<br />
do so. At the moment I have got oo recommendation before me, so I can't give you<br />
a precise answer to your question. But there are two factors to be remembered.<br />
The first one is that we have decided that the direct cost to the patient, him or<br />
herself, will not be more than 80 cents in the case of a surgery visit, $ 1.20 in the<br />
case of a home visit, or $ 5 in the case of any procedure that is the total procedure.<br />
So to that extent, the patient is protected. The second important point is that we<br />
want the best m-edical service that we can get for all people including the<br />
pensioners. And so far as I know, there will be no drop whatsoever, and perhaps<br />
even an improvement, in the care and the attention given to the individual himself<br />
or herself.<br />
Q. Recently in a glorious display of the operations of democracy in this<br />
country, two of our colleagues were hauled before the bar of the Senate and publicly<br />
rebuked for breach of privilege. You will recall that after the Frank Brownie scandal,<br />
Sir, Sir Robert Menzies undertook to review the privileges situation. Would you<br />
be prepared to revive this tired promise?<br />
PM I have done it already.<br />
Q. In what way, Sir?<br />
PM I have now asked again I have got to refer, I am sorry, to the Attorney<br />
but I have asked the Attorney to prepare a Cabinet submission and to co-operate with<br />
others of my colleagues so that I can take it to Cabinet.<br />
Q. Sir, Australia's international reserves are currently at record levels.<br />
It has been argued that this is a bit like stuffing a mattress full of money. Do you<br />
intend to allow them to increase much further, or adopt any new policy with regard<br />
to our reserves?<br />
PM So far as I am concerned, as a former Treasurer and one who likes<br />
to see this country develop, I welcome this money coming into the place. You can<br />
never tell when adverse conditions might occur and it is pretty good to have<br />
reserves of the kind that we have got at the moment. But it must be obvious that<br />
I didn't make clear what I said in answer to a previous question off the probable<br />
size, but not necessarily a detailed and precise size of the component. When<br />
you look at those components, to a large extent they are building up the greatness<br />
of this country. And if they build up the greatness of this country, then we should<br />
welcome them. </p>
<p>Q. Continuing with the doctors. You term it a. remarkable achievement<br />
that the doctors asked for $ 30-odd million and got $ 9 million...<br />
PM $ 35 million.<br />
Q. Is it not standard negotiating practice to ask for more than you expect<br />
to get? Is that not just what the doctors have done?<br />
PM I don't think so. They had their own formulas. They had statistics<br />
presented. But if you don't mind me putting this to you, I don't want to come here<br />
and make this a debating society. It will ruin these discussions if I do. I am telling<br />
you the facts. Everyone can make up their own mind whether they agree with<br />
my conclusions or they don't.<br />
Q. When Mr. Malcolm Fraser resigned as Defence Minister, you revealed<br />
that he had recommended, and his recommendation agreed with that of the<br />
Administrator of Papua and New Guinea, that the call-out order for the Pacific<br />
Island Regiment should be revoked. I think we went so far as to suggest that it had<br />
an element of illegality about it. Has in fact that order been revoked?<br />
PM As to the first part of your question I was not aware that Mr. Malcolm<br />
Fraser had made that statement or that it might have had an element of illegality<br />
about it. But I did discuss this matter with....<br />
( iterjection) He said it in the House.<br />
PM Did he? Oh, well, I don't always hear everything and I don't remember<br />
that. But I did discuss this with the Minister for Defence, Mr. Gorton, sometime<br />
ago, and instructions were then issued to revoke the order.<br />
Q. It has been revoked?<br />
PM Yes.<br />
Q. Prime Minister, in Townsville on Sunday, ABSCHOL, the National<br />
Conference of Aboriginal Education, accused you of selling out the Queensland<br />
aborigines in your arrangements with Mr. Bjelke-Petersen. Will Mr. Howson be<br />
asked to look at those arrangements before they are initialled or agreed to by the<br />
Commonwealth?<br />
PM May I put the position to you as accurately as I can? Mr. Wentworth<br />
put 11 recommendations to me that came from the Council of Aborigines in<br />
Australia, that is, each of the Local Reserve Councils combining together to put<br />
their recommendations to us. I thought these were authoritative, and the best<br />
group that we could get recommendations from. And I was anxious that their<br />
opinions and their recommendations should be put into effect. I took them up with<br />
the Queensland Premier and his officials, and nine of them were agreed to such<br />
things as their right to leave the reserves if they wanted to, who should control<br />
access again, and that was to be in the hands of the Reserve Councils vagrancy,<br />
the separate rights of the Torres Strait Islanders, control over their own assets.<br />
and the supply of liquor and matters of this kind. In every case, with the<br />
exception of two, we agreed with the requests of the Aboriginal Councils themselves.<br />
In two cases, we had variations. In the case of alcohol, we thought they should </p>
<p>have the right of local option, and the aborigines on the Mission or the Reserveitself<br />
should have the right to decide whether they wanted alcohol.-and. under what<br />
conditions. I think that is fair. We have local conditions, even in Melbourne,<br />
that staid city. Secondly, we had one other problem that I felt the recommendations,<br />
made by the Queensland Government were right. And they thought that special<br />
legislation should be introduced to protect aborigines who were given control over<br />
their own assets and who were exploited by undesirable elements. In these cases,<br />
special provision would be made to protect them. This is not discrimination. This<br />
is protection in their favour. As to ABSCHOL, I am a little amazed that they<br />
could make a comment at this stage, because as yet, they don't know the exact<br />
details of what the Queensland Government is doing. They should wait until they<br />
know and until we are told. And if we are not satisfied, I will immediately<br />
approach Mr. Bjelke-Petersen again.<br />
Q. It is not closed then, Sir?<br />
PM No, of course it is not. But they couldn't be making a rational comment<br />
about it because they don't know, I don't know, and the Queensland Government<br />
itself doesn't know today the exact terms of the bill1 they intend to introduce into<br />
the House.<br />
Q. Sir, the Institute of Aboriginal Studies expects that as a result of<br />
financial hardship it might have to cut back its research programmes. Do you<br />
feel this is something of an anomaly with regard to Government aboriginal policy?<br />
PM You would have to say that again, I don't quite follow what you are<br />
driving at.<br />
Q. The Institute of Aboriginal Studies is also being crimped by the general<br />
cutbacks in Public Service spending, and may have to reduce its research programme.<br />
Do you feel this is somewhat anomalous in view of the current concern with<br />
aboriginal advancement and welfare?<br />
PM It is not a justified concern of theirs. I don't think there is any<br />
prospect of it happening.<br />
Q. Sir, we have just had the first Member of Parliament, an aboriginal,<br />
elected here he is on the verge of being elected. Do you foresee the time,<br />
possibly, when an aborigine might even sit in the chair you occupy now?<br />
PM I had not thought of it, but it certainly is not out of the question.<br />
Q. Prime Minister, you indicated earlier that you agreed with Mr Snedden<br />
that the Budget would be a tough one. Without..<br />
PM I didn't say tbat. I didn't make that comment about it. With great<br />
respect to you, I said I had not used the phrase myself, Mr. Snedden had used.<br />
I believed it was up to Mr. Snedden to carry out his own public relations operations<br />
himself and I thinik he is doing it well.<br />
Q. In view of that, do you disagree with Mr. Sn edden that the Budget<br />
won't be a tough one? </p>
<p>PM I don't make any comment about it. Implicit in what I said is that I<br />
will make no comment about his Budget. Look, could I put this to you. I don't<br />
like people interfering with the Minister who is responsible not only for the<br />
production of the Budget under my supervision, of course, and with Cabinet<br />
approval. I don't believe in people expressing their own personal views about it.<br />
I have lived there for twenty-one years and this will be my twenty-first succesfive<br />
Budget, and I want to give him a fair go to be able to explain it in his own te":. ils.<br />
And when the Budget is delivered, to be able to assure the Australian people wt<br />
the best support that I could give him, that it is in the interests, of the -nation-and<br />
the interests of the individual as well.<br />
Q. Sir, did you always get-a fair go with your Budgets?<br />
PM Who was that now?<br />
Q. It was suggested in your recent term as Treasurer that you yourself<br />
were anticipating a tough Budget. This didn't come to pass. This gives rise to<br />
my question. Did you always get a fair go as Treasurer yourself with your<br />
Budgets?<br />
PM You know I wouldn't make a comment on a question of that kind.<br />
Q. On the question of the Budget, do you still hold hopes of giving a pension<br />
increase?<br />
PM I will make no comment whatsoever about the Budget, other than you<br />
can take it if I have made a statement in the past, I will be carefully watching to<br />
see that what I said then was not forgotten.<br />
Q. You are committed towards a pension increase aren't you, Sir?<br />
PM Yes.<br />
Q. Sir, what are your reactions to suggestions that public servants should<br />
have greater freedom to make public statements, particularly in areas which are<br />
not directly concerned with their own Department's work?<br />
PM Here we. -get into an extremely difficult area because I don't know how<br />
strong the movement is that increased rights should be given to civil and public<br />
servants. Certainly they should not have a right to make public comment on any<br />
matter at all with which they have been associated in policy or administrative<br />
decisions. Secondly, there is another very big area that they previously imcntioned<br />
themselves that they feel they would like to be able to make statements about.<br />
Now, I don't feel they should make statements about people's incomes or their<br />
private lives or what is likely to happen or the way in which they think Budget<br />
changes or other social changes should be made. But this has been referred to the<br />
Public Service Board for a recommendation to us. And the Council itself was asked<br />
if it would make recommendations. So far they haven't made recommendations or<br />
proposals to the Public Service Board, When they do and when the Public Service<br />
Board let us know the facts, and what they recommend, we can have a detailed<br />
look at it. Until then, we can't. But I do say this that the Public Service is in a<br />
position where it must not be permitted to interfere with the rights of the individual </p>
<p>or discuss individual rights and privileges when they might have access. to information,<br />
that other people-outside the public service might rot have access to.<br />
Q. What is the reason for thesix months' delay in finalising the nuclear<br />
power station contract?<br />
PM In anticipation of this question, thinking it might be raised, I discussed<br />
it with Mr. Swartz yesterday, and he has assured me that he has had negotiations<br />
with the interested parties and that he will shortly be submitting -either a letter<br />
to me or some recommendations to me which I will probably hawre to take to<br />
Cabinet.<br />
Q. The submission has been ready to go before Cabinet for over a month,<br />
hasn't it?<br />
PM That is not correct. No.<br />
Q. Prime Minister, the Labor Party's Federal Conference in Launceston<br />
next month is to be open to the Press. The Liberal Party's Federal Council<br />
Meeting in Canberra next week is not to be open to the Press. Is there any reason<br />
in your mind why the workings of the Liberal machine fshould not be open to<br />
public scrutiny as those of the Labor machine now are?<br />
PM There are two immense differences between the two parties. Despite<br />
what might have been said, the first one is that you well know that in a Labor Party<br />
Conference everything is arranged beforehand, and ( laughter) I know you<br />
laugh and you should and so you should it makes a farce of the whole<br />
business but as you know at one, I think, probably two years ago decisions<br />
were made on a " yes" or " no" immediately the conference resumed. We don't<br />
do that. We in fact go in and discuss them at length. And the second critically<br />
important point and this is the critical one that our own organisation, while<br />
the custodian of principles, and a group that can make recoiinmidations for thern,<br />
cannot enforce those recommendations. The third point is we regard ourselves<br />
as a national government. And consequently while we examine in the closest<br />
detail and as sympathetically as we can recommendations and reports that come<br />
from the Liberal and the Country Parties, we don't regard them as decisive. We<br />
make up our minds in the national interest. But nonetheless, as Prime Minister, I<br />
will have a look next time we have an Executive Meeting after we have a Council<br />
Meeting on Monday or Tuesday, I will raise this question myself.<br />
Q. It is a fact also, Sir, that the New South Wales Liberal Conference<br />
is conducted in the same way as the ALP2 conference and does not seem to attract<br />
the disabilities that you suggest might be attracted in the Federal field.<br />
PM Did you say New South Wales?<br />
Qt Yes.<br />
PM Victoria is. Not New South Wales. </p>
<p>Q. The wool industry seems to be in a worse shape than every, despite the<br />
establishment of the Wool Commission and emergency aid grants the government<br />
gave last year. Can you say what action the Government proposes to take now,<br />
particularly in the light of decisions by many woolgrower organisations that the<br />
industry needs a price of 40 cents a pound to survive? And will this mean more<br />
Government money for the Wool Commission to allow to lift its reserve prices?<br />
PM First of all, I think I should make it clear what Mr. Anthony did say.<br />
He made two statements. The first one was that he believed woolgrowers'<br />
organisattons should get together and should themselves say what kind of action<br />
they want the Government to take. But he equally made it plain that he didn't<br />
believe in subsidies. Thirdly he made it clear that he felt that the big woolbuyers<br />
of the world would accommodate a rise in the floor price of wool if it were raised<br />
by the Commission. It is not a matter I feel that I can enter into a debate about<br />
at this time, but it is a matter uriJW the closest scrutiny by officials and by<br />
the Government and when the approMte time comes, I will be able to make a<br />
statement about it.<br />
Mr. Reid, you look a little puzzled about the answer to my question.<br />
Now, in New South Wales the Liberal Party Council is not open to the public. I<br />
have been at the last two, I think, and they were not open.<br />
Q. Your speeches were reported, Sir, and so also was that of Mr. Askin.<br />
I took it on that so also was much of the dialogue either that or someone was<br />
leaking like a sieve...<br />
PM They were, too, you were quite right. Well they might just as well<br />
have been open. A better way of putting it. Perhaps that is the way I should have<br />
put it, too.<br />
Q. Sir, Mr. Anthony's new-found abhorrence of subsidies... Does<br />
this mean there will be no more subsidies to the wool industry?<br />
PM No, it doesn't.<br />
Q. Next month, you will be facing up to the Premiers again, and as you<br />
know, the Commonwealth hand-outs to the States constitute about one-third of<br />
the Budget outlays. Now in the cort ext of Mr. Snedden's statement that we will<br />
have a tough Budget, does this mean it will be less likely that you will be able<br />
to make some sort of supplementary allowance as has been made in the last few<br />
years and to the Premiers this year?<br />
PM I think you would know just as well as I do that I would not make<br />
any statement about what is likely to happen or proposals that are likely to be put<br />
by the Commonwealth to the State Governments at the Premiers' Conference.<br />
There is no greater source of irritation than to be giving indications of what you<br />
are likely to do at Premiers' Conferences. And as I want their goodwill and<br />
co-operation, I am not going to irritate them at this stage. They are the first<br />
ones to hear what our proposals are. And the se cond point is, rather like the<br />
Budget, I think you should hold your confidence until the last moment because you<br />
can never anticipate what is likely to happen in this mobile country of oura.<br />
Conditions can change so quickly. </p>
<p>Q. PM<br />
Q. PM Q. don't ask<br />
moment. When you add the other words that Mir. Nixon used... " in his lifetime"...<br />
me to be saying what kind of a mission I am likely to play at the<br />
I find I have got my hands full.<br />
WNould you like to visit China?<br />
Yes, I would.<br />
Any plans on that, Sir?<br />
No, none.<br />
Is Mr. Nixon coming here this year?<br />
Not that I know.<br />
States for Have you made any advance with your study of a growth tax for the<br />
submission at the next Premiers' Conference?<br />
Yes. I think that draft papers will be submitted to me by the<br />
Treasurer Mr. Snedden in the first week of next month.<br />
Can you give us any indication of what it will be?<br />
No.<br />
Has Taiwan reacted to our initiatives on China, Sir?<br />
Yes. In what way?<br />
I am sorry I can't tell you. 0. / 19<br />
Does that mean then that Mr. Snedden's statement was perhaps a<br />
little premature? No. It wasn't, and I read carefully Mr. Snedden's statement that he<br />
made today. I think it is excellent.<br />
On China, Sir. You said the announcement had a greater effect<br />
overseas than anything for five years. Gould you tell us what sort of effect they<br />
had particularly? No, I can't. I'm sorry. But I have watched the cables very<br />
carefully and I have been informed of the various kinds of discussions that<br />
have taken place and I can assure you that the statement that I made or, the<br />
Thursday has been the subject of questions, that it has caused a great deal of<br />
discussion overseas. Much of it, I think, very successful.<br />
PreBident Nixon said about a month ago that he hoped to visit China.<br />
Would you be in the same position?*<br />
PM<br />
PM PM PM<br />
Q. PM PM PM </p>
<p>Q. I was wondering how you reconcile your statement earlier this year on<br />
Omega that it was not sufficiently accurate to be used by ballistic missile<br />
submarines. hn Admiral Zummalt's statement this week, he said theoretically it<br />
could be used.<br />
PM Well Admiral Zummalt has said that. I got the text of what he said<br />
today, but there are so many gaps in the tape recording of it that frankly I can't<br />
quite make out what he did say. W1hat he meant, anyhow. But can I put two<br />
proposals to you which are authoritative and come from the Americans in very,<br />
very recent days. The first one is there is no receiver now known that can be<br />
put into a ballistic missile type of submarine that can receive the Omega.<br />
Secondly we have been assured by the United States Government that it has no<br />
intention of putting Omega in any of its ballistic missile submarines and that is<br />
h as no plans whatsoever to do so. And thirdly you can take it as absolutely positive<br />
that there are so many better systems, far far better systems than th e Omega<br />
that there would be no reason wvhy it ought to be included. Now to me there is a<br />
lot of nonsense about this debate. I would like to know whether those who are<br />
creating the debate want us to stop the Omega system in Australian waters for the<br />
use of surface transp~ ort? It is a remarkably good system for merchant marine<br />
and for that matter for naval purposes. And I have not heard anyone yet who has<br />
said they want to see it abandoned for these purposes. It has a lot of advantages,<br />
and as I say, at the moment while it is theoretically possible in anti-ballistic<br />
missile submarines, there is no intention of putting them in, and no receiver yet<br />
capable of receiving the messages.<br />
Q. Sir, when you became Leader of the Liberal Party you spoke of the<br />
desire for a greater flow of information from -the Government to the people and at<br />
a National Press Club interview about six weeks ago, you spoike of an open door<br />
policy. To some journalists it seems that in fact there hasn't been an increase<br />
in the amount of flow of information, that it seems a long time between press<br />
conferences. Is there any reason why you can't follow the precedure which<br />
State Premiers have of hay ing Press Conferences, perhaps even daily, I am not<br />
suggesting they should be daily, that you would find it possible to have them<br />
daily perhaps weekly. Or of briefing the press, I mean the Press Gallery,<br />
on what happens after Cabinet meetings on decisions. which have been firmly<br />
taken?<br />
PM As to the second part of your question, I think it is worthwhile studying<br />
and I will put it to immediate study and make up my mind what ought to 2be done.<br />
As to the substance of your question it is time. I can't fit in anything more. I<br />
would like you to have a look at my diary and see if you can get a better set of<br />
priorities than my staff give.<br />
Mr. Barnes Thank you very much Prime Minister. We hope it is not too long<br />
before we see you again.<br />
At the end of the press conference, the Prime Minister said he regretted there<br />
had not been a question about Mrs. Burns. o. </p>

Omega that it was not sufficiently accurate to be used by ballistic missile<br />
submarines. h3 Admiral Zummalt's statement this week, he said theoretically it<br />

proposals to you which are authoritative and come from the Americans in very,<br />
very recent days. The first one is there is no receiver now known that can be<br />
put into a ballistic missile type of submarine that can receive the Omega.<br />
Secondly we have been assured by the United States Government that it has no<br />
intention of putting Omnega in any of its ballistic missile submarines and that is<br />
has no plans whatsoever to do so. And thirdly you can take it as absolutely positive<br />
that there are so many better systems, far far better systems than the Omega<br />
that there would be no reason why it ought to be included. Now to me there is a<br />
lot of nonsense about this debate. I would like to know whether those who are<br />
creating the debate want us to stop the Omega system in Australian waters for the<br />
use of surface transport? It is a remarkably good system for merchant marine<br />
and for that matter for naval purposes. And 1. have not heard anyone yet who has<br />
said they want to see it abandoned for these purposes. It has a lot of advantages,<br />
and as I say, at the moment while it is theoretically possible in anti-ballistic<br />
missile submarines, there is no intention of putting them in, and no receiver yet<br />
capable of receiving the messages.<br />
Q. Sir, when you became Leader of the Liberal Party you spoke of the<br />
desire for a greater flow of information from -the Government to the people and at<br />
a National Press Club interview about six weeks ago, you spoke of an open door<br />
policy. To some journalists it seems that in fact there hasn't been an increase<br />
in the amount of flow of information, that it seems a long time between press<br />
conferences. Is there any reason why you can't follow the precedure which<br />
State Premiers have of hay ing Press Conferences, perhaps even daily, I am not<br />
suggesting they should be daily, that you would find it possible to have them<br />
daily perhaps weekly. Or of briefing the press, I mean the Press Gallery,<br />
on what happens after Cabinet meetings on decisions which have been firmly<br />
taken?<br />
PM As to the second part of your question, I think it is worthwhile studying<br />
and I will put it to immediate study and make up my mind what ought to be done.<br />
As to the substance of your question it is time. I can't fit in anything more. I<br />
would like you to have a look at my diary and see if you Can get a better set of<br />
priorities than my staff give.<br />
Mr. Barnes Thank you very much Prime Minister. We hope it is not too long<br />
before we see you again.<br />
At the end of the press conference, the Prime Minister said he regretted there<br />
had not been a question about Mrs. Burns. o. </p>
<p>Q. What were you going to say about Mrs. Burns?<br />
This is the lady that owes the 003?<br />
PM Well the answer is this. I can put it to you in two different components.<br />
First of all, she has a right of appeal to a court iA' she wishes to exercise that right.<br />
If she does we will pay her costs. We don't at the moment knmow whether she wants<br />
to or not. Secondly, as to the amount she owes. W-hen. I was the Treasurer, I made<br />
a decision that if a person has been overpaid, and car, establish good faith in the<br />
receipt of those moneys, that we will onl y insist upon the repayment of the amount<br />
that was paid to them during the course of the last year. In her case, it would be<br />
something of the order of 4C2, off which she has paid $ 5383, leaving a residue<br />
of $ 944. So to that extent we ara~ prepared to negotiate with her, and we certainly<br />
will not ask that our costs be paid by her. I thought I would get this question. I<br />
was sure I would. And if I can say so, .1 am rather glad because it shows how<br />
human you are because it is the first time I have know-n you to have been off the<br />
mark. </p>
