MINISTER FOR INDUSTRY AND COMMERCE<br />
PAR~ LIAMENT HOUSE<br />
CANBERRA. A. CT 26W0<br />
11 October, 1982<br />
My dear Prime Minister,<br />
I wish to advise you of certain decisions that I have<br />
taken concerning my future involvement in public life.<br />
May I first of all thank you for the consideration you<br />
have extended to me during my recent illness and absence<br />
from Ministerial duties; I have appreciated the regular<br />
personal contact you have maintained with me during<br />
this period. Although I am continuing to make good<br />
progress, it will be somne weeks yet before my<br />
convalescence is complete.<br />
As you know, I have discussed with you on a number of<br />
occasions in recent years my desire to conclude my*<br />
Parliamentary career in view of the strains imposed on<br />
my family by the pressures of senior Cabinet office.<br />
This was the principal reason for relinquishing my position<br />
as Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party earlier this year.<br />
I took the view, in coming to that decision, that I should<br />
remain for a time as a Minister having regard to the<br />
obligations I felt to the Government and to my electorate.<br />
The circumstances have now changed and I am no longer able<br />
to compromise my family and personal responsibilities<br />
by contemplating continued Parliamentary office. My<br />
medical advisers have indicated that, while I can look<br />
forward to complete recovery, it would be unwise to<br />
carry the burden imposed by Ministerial and Parliamentary<br />
life. * I do not believe that I can properly disregard<br />
this advice.<br />
It is therefore my intention to resign from the Parliament<br />
within the next few weeks. Having regard to our previous<br />
conversations, and to the medical advice to which X have<br />
adverted in this letter, I am confident that this course<br />
of action will have your concurrence and support. -It is<br />
appropriate, then, that I should now formally submit my<br />
resignation as Minister for Industry and Commerce with<br />
immediate effect. It is in the best interests of the<br />
Government that you should have the opportunity to fill my<br />
position in Cabinet as soon as practicable. </p>
<p>2<br />
I have had the honour and privilege to have served as<br />
a Minister for twelve of the past fifteen years and, for<br />
ten of those years, as Deputy Leader of the Liberal<br />
Party. My participation in coalition Governments over<br />
this period has given me a substantial measure of fulfilment,<br />
and I draw satisfaction from the knowledge that I have<br />
played a part in securing a number of policy objectives<br />
essential to the advancement of our national welfare.<br />
I would like to record at this time my admiration for the<br />
leadership you have provided to the Government since 1975.<br />
As * must be expected in politics we have had our differences.<br />
We have nevertheless worked well together and you will<br />
continue to have my unqualified support as Leader of the,<br />
Party. Having represented the Electorate of Flinders for a record<br />
term of sixteen years, I shall retire from the Parliament<br />
with considerable regret. I am, however, confident that<br />
the seat will be retained by the Liberal Party and I will be<br />
doing everything I can to support our candidate.<br />
I wish you and our colleagues every success for the future<br />
arnd I look forward to playing a continuing role in the<br />
Liberal Party of Australia during the years to come.<br />
with kindest regards, Yours sincerely,<br />
PHILLIP LYNCH<br />
The Rt Rion. Malcolm Fraser, M. P.,<br />
Prime Minister,<br />
Parliament House,<br />
CANBERRA, A. C. T. 2600 </p>

to the Government to learn of your decision to step<br />
down from the Cabinet and retire from the Parliament.<br />
Needless to say, I fully respect and understand the<br />
position as outlined in your letter of today's date.<br />
After your sixteen years in the Parliament twelve of<br />
them as a Minister I can well understand how difficult<br />
a decision this must have been. As has been the case<br />
throughout your political career, you are acting in<br />
what you see as the best interests of the Government<br />
and your colleagues. it is with much reluctance that<br />
I accept your resignation and note your intention to<br />
retire from the Parliament.<br />
Since you won the seat of Flinders in 1966, you have<br />
made an exceptionally distinguished contribution to<br />
the Liberal Party and to the Government. Over the<br />
years you have done an outstanding job in six different<br />
Ministerial portfolios.<br />
I am particularly grateful for the support that you<br />
have given me, both as Deputy Party Leader and as a<br />
senior member of the Cabinet. I am extremely sorry<br />
to lose your services and I know these sentiments will<br />
be shared not only by your Ministerial colleagues but by<br />
all members of the Coalition Parties in Canberra.<br />
I hope you will soon be fully recovered from your recent<br />
illness and much appreciate your offer to continue your<br />
support. / 12 ' S </p>
<p>-2-<br />
My personal thanks for your great service to the Government<br />
and to Australia. It has been a very distinguished<br />
Parliamentary career, during which time you have made<br />
many friends on both sides of the Parliament.<br />
Again, it is with reluctance that I accept your<br />
resignation. I wish you every success and happiness<br />
for the future. 2&gt;<br />
The Rt Hon. Sir Phillip Lynch, KCMd, MP,<br />
Minister for industry and Commerce,<br />
