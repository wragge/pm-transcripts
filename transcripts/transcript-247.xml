( AUST.) PTY. LTD. AT GRANVILLE ON FhIDAYI<br />
NOVEMBEa 1i96o.<br />
I am constantly reminded by the highest authorities<br />
that I don't know much about anything. But I could certainly<br />
tell you all I knewi about aluminium quite briefly.<br />
I know, for example, that vie call it " aluminium" and<br />
that in the United States and in Canada, they call it<br />
" aluminium". But ith that happy instinct for compromise which<br />
characterises us, they go one step further back in the process<br />
of manufacture, and they have all agreed that one is " alumina".<br />
I also know that aluminium is a subject about w. hich<br />
my colleague, Senator Spooner, constantly talks to me. If I<br />
were to meet him at midnight on some remote airport, he would<br />
say to me " I'd like a few words with you about aluminium".<br />
( Laughter 3 So by a happy association of ideas, when I was<br />
invited to come to open this factory I said, " Yes, I'll come;<br />
I'll convert this from the iorld of theory into the w-iorld of<br />
practice: I'll have a look at it".<br />
Then I read, by kind courtesy of those who have<br />
already spoken to you, a rough idea of what they were going to<br />
say. I read that little bit about using this foil for<br />
wrapping up the joint. Do you remember it? I mean the joint<br />
you eat. ( Laughter) I've seen other joints wrapped up in it,<br />
but they tell me that that was some '. nsulating purpose. But<br />
any rate the good old roast beef can be urapped up in this<br />
commodity, and we've been told that it will preserve the flavor,<br />
and that it will keep the pan clean. I don't understand that.<br />
I thought you had to put things on beef in the process of<br />
cooking it. What I really uant to know, in pursuance of my quest<br />
for knowledge, is this: Do you wrap it up tightly, and when the<br />
meat is cooked, do you eat the aluminium with it? ( Laughter)<br />
Because this would open up a new universe to me edible<br />
aluminium. I wouldn't be surprised; they'll ome to that.<br />
They will find that there is some strange medicinal<br />
quality about aluminium taken orally. And no doubt some<br />
ingenious fallow will invent ways and means of giving it a<br />
flavour, ( Laughter) which, of course, wvould greatly add to the<br />
results of unsatisfactory roast beef.<br />
But all that is a mere by the -uay. The fact is that<br />
this is really a splendid event and a splendid venture. I'm<br />
a great believer I think we all are in the development in<br />
Australia of industries, more and more industries, of greater<br />
and greater quality in their production, because we know that<br />
we have a destiny in the world which won't be determined by the<br />
events of this year or next year, but which will steadily grow,<br />
and expand over the course of the decades, and, indeed, I hope,<br />
over the course of the centuries.<br />
Many of you will recall some of our vicissitu(', s of<br />
the past: the great depression of 1929, 1309 ' 31, ' 32 hit<br />
Australia it wasn't peculiar to Australia although some<br />
people thought it was. It happened in the United States of<br />
America; it happened, indeed, all round the world. But in the<br />
case of Australia we uero hit by two things.<br />
One was the export prices for our export </p>
<p>2.<br />
commodities, notably wool and wheat, which went down to such<br />
fantastic depths that they amounted to wiping out a considerable<br />
section of our export income.<br />
At the same time, and perhaps because of that, and<br />
because of the impact of the depression all round the world,<br />
our capacity to raise money outside Australia dried up. The<br />
loan markets closed against us, and at that time, in<br />
consequence, we had an experience in Australia which produced<br />
at its peak, I remind you, something over 30% of unemployment.<br />
That is not going to happen again. Having regard to<br />
our developments it can't happen again. At that time<br />
Australian manufacturing was, although substantial, small<br />
compared with That it is today. It was, indeed, after that,<br />
that you had the major accelerations in manufacturing. Since<br />
the second world war, we have seen miracles of development in<br />
the manufacturing field. lie are looking at one of the latest<br />
of them here today.<br />
The result is that we now, economically speaking,<br />
stand not just on one foot, but on two. Kie are not exposed to<br />
anything like the same degree, to the wind and the weather of<br />
world markets, as we woere then because we have a vastly<br />
developing population largely engaged in this enormous<br />
development ofManufacture, and in supplying the needs of our<br />
own country. So I haven't the faintest doubt that economically we<br />
are infinitely stronger, infinitely more capable of resisting<br />
what I! ve just called the " wind and the weather".<br />
There is another aspect of that matter that i just<br />
want to say a word about.<br />
Jo, from4dme to time, have tremendous arguments in<br />
Australia I've evcn heard one or two of them myself of late<br />
about economic problems. QJe are constantly reminded of the<br />
profound, and inescapable truth that all economists who advise<br />
governments are incompetent; and that all economists who<br />
advise newspapers are invariably correct. ( Laughter) This is<br />
one of the great facts of life and I don't mind it, not at<br />
all. But do let me say this to you, just as a matter of<br />
pure commonsense. We will always have a tendency to balance of<br />
payment problems. These problems will tend to recur as your<br />
balances go up, and as they come down, if we depend almost<br />
essentially on primary production for our export income.<br />
If our expo. rt income is primarily made up of great<br />
staples like wool, and wheat and meat, and so on, then,<br />
inevitably, as their prices fluctuate, our overseas income will<br />
fluctuate, with all the repurcussions that it has, and would<br />
havo if there were no government at all, on the intornal<br />
credit structure. These are, as I say, the elements of the problem.<br />
Therefore I believe, and my colleagues believe, that the<br />
ultimate insurance against these fluctuations having these<br />
rather severe results, is to introduce more and more into our<br />
export earnings manufactured and processed commodities.<br />
Because, more and more, to the extent to which we can do that,<br />
we will, externally be standing on two feet, as we do now<br />
stand, internally, domestically, on two feet.<br />
Now how you arc going to develop export, how you are<br />
going to improve your balance of payment problem, is a matter<br />
which again lends itself to two considera -q </p>
<p>One of them is, what commodities are there that you<br />
are importing into Australia, that you are paying for out of<br />
your earnings, that you could make here, effectively,<br />
economically? And if you can discover some of those, then you<br />
will reduce your demand for imports in that field, and satisfy<br />
the requirement at home. 3y saving Å“ 5 million on some item of<br />
that kind, we are, in terms of our balances of payments, just<br />
as well off as if we had increased our export income by<br />
million. That is why I am very attracted, Sir, by the figures<br />
that you gave about what the importation has been in your own<br />
field. And therefore to the extent to which you replace that<br />
by a commodity which has such quality that nobody can deny its<br />
presence, or its right to be present on the market, then, if<br />
you do that, you are, in effect, adding to our export position<br />
by reducing the volume of our imports.<br />
Of course, on the other hand, we would be poor<br />
Australians, we would have a very, very small confidence in<br />
ourselves if we didn't believe that with this growing<br />
population of ours, growing at an enormous rate, growing at a<br />
percentage rate greater than that of Japan at the present time,<br />
if we didn't believe that with this greatly increased<br />
population with the vision that we have of more millions of<br />
people in the future, , rith ou:: usual and proper confidence in<br />
our own capacity to do things in Australia our sil, our<br />
resourcefulness, our free-mindodness we would have very little<br />
faith in ourselves if we didn't believe that this country is<br />
going to be a ve:: y substantial exporter of the products of its<br />
factories. I have been discussing this matter only in the last<br />
few days with representatives of industry. The problem is a<br />
complex one. It has to be approached not with a collection of<br />
old fashioned or conservative ideas that is not for a<br />
government to do, or that is for a government to do.. how can we<br />
break into the markets in such and such a place because we have<br />
a relatively high cost structure.<br />
If woe are going to achieve entry into new markets,<br />
strategically placed, as we are in this corner of the world,<br />
if we are going to expand the markets that we already have,<br />
then we will have to do two things,.<br />
First, in co-operation between industry and government<br />
we must seek out every pos'ible means of increasing export,<br />
rthodox or unorthodox. Some matters may have to be done<br />
overseas; some matters may have to be attended to inside<br />
Australia. But unless we have a go at this, unless wo can<br />
get out of the old idea that our costs of manufacture are so<br />
great that we can't possibly sell to the rest of the world,<br />
unless we get away from that, then I just want to say to you<br />
that we will go on essentially depending upon a large export<br />
earning, because we essentially depend, and so does manufacturing<br />
industry, to a large extent, on largo imports of materials,<br />
and plant and skills from the rest of the world.<br />
But if we are t have all those things, these<br />
hundreds and hundreds of millions of pounds worth of things<br />
that come in across our exports, our imports, for the use and<br />
benefit of manufacturing, must be paid for.<br />
And if we are g'ing to pay for them, and pay f'-r<br />
them steadily and increasingly, then our export income nust be<br />
steady and increasing. 3ecause if it isn't, and it<br />
fluctuates wildly, according to whether wool is 70d. or<br />
then we will inevitably have problems of balances of pay! ments,<br />
problems of imports, problems of international finance which<br />
we could all well acfford to be vithout. </p>
<p>96 V to So, I am all for the development of those industries<br />
in Australia which I am certain will find beforu they are very<br />
much older, that they have markets open to them, not necessarily<br />
in Canada or the United States, if one talks about your own<br />
commoi-dity, but in South-East Asia.<br />
There are other countries around the world. Don't<br />
let us forget that one of the purposes of the Colombo Plan<br />
under which great aid has been given, and is being given, to<br />
South and South-East Asian countries, is to lift the standard<br />
of living. There is no quicker way of lifting the standard of<br />
living in those countries than by giving them some industrial<br />
development; and as they develop in that way, so their demands<br />
will grow. The more industrialised Australia has become, the<br />
more we have imported; and that is going to be their experience<br />
in due course. The result will be that particularly if we keep<br />
our sights up, and our quality high, there will be a very<br />
remarkable prospect and a growing prospect of doing export<br />
business. olea re working very hard on this; the work has been<br />
done for years, or for some years now, in the Department of<br />
Trade with great energy, as I think everybody will concede. Wo<br />
are intensifying our search for these ways and means of<br />
increasing our exports, because it is in these two aspects of<br />
saving imports, and of increasing overseas earnings that the<br />
future of Australia is so intimately wrapped up , with the future<br />
of Australian manufacturing production.<br />
That is a rather long-uinded kind of serm. in. But<br />
seeing that I am in the presence of the usual collection of<br />
highly responsible business men all of whom, occasionally, have<br />
reason to doubt whether I ever think about anything, I thought<br />
I would just offer you these few observations for your<br />
assistance and for mine.<br />
But before I conclude I want to say one personal thing<br />
I ias delighted when I read, and today when I heard, that my old<br />
friend Tim Clapp was to be here. I see he's over there,<br />
( Applause) I think I am right in saying, Tim, that in may first<br />
manifestation as a Prime Minister you and I had something to do<br />
with buying some aluminium in the United States of America during<br />
the early year or two of the war.<br />
But that is not his greatest claim, although he is a<br />
great citizen. I want to tell you that in my earlier Land more<br />
reputable days when I ras Attorney-General and I came over to<br />
Sydney and was so unimportant that no pressman wanted to interview<br />
me at the railway station, or on the airport, if there had<br />
been one, iir. Clapp used to take me out on the harbour, heavily<br />
disguised as a yachtsman ( Laughter) and my functions were very<br />
simple. i'hen we got into a quiet stretch of the harbour, with<br />
no obvious obstructions to traffic in sight, he allowed me to<br />
take the helm, telling me precisely how I should just steer about<br />
half a point off the wind wonderful political training it was<br />
for me. Then he went down below and he always produced, ultimately,<br />
for lunch you don't mind me going into these intimate<br />
details do you steamed sausages for which I've always had a<br />
great and sneaking regard ever since, surrounded by some kind of<br />
spaghetti. But the whole point was this: before that<br />
happened his hand would come up through the hatchway, not holding<br />
a sword like Excalibur but holding a large glass of some<br />
exotic liquid which really set me up for the day. ( Laughter)<br />
Ladies and : entlemenc now that I have mentioned that<br />
to you, your mind wilt be. in t run so much on those liquid refreshrents<br />
that were delicatoly_ hinted at by the last speaker,<br />
that I'll conclude. But beforo i concludo I'll doclare this<br />
factory Open e. nd wish it the greatest success. ( Applause) </p>
