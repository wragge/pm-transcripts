COMMONEAITT1 HEADS OF GOVERNMENT MEETING, OTTAWA<br />
Attached is the text of the final communique issued<br />
at the conclusion of the Commonwealth Heads of Government<br />
Meeting, Ottawa, 2 10 August, 1973. </p>
<p>FINAL COMMUNIOUE Commonwealth Heads of Government met in Ottawa from<br />
2 10 August. All Commonwealth countries were reoresented, five<br />
by their Presidents or their Heads of State, eighteen by their<br />
Prime Ministers, three by their Vice-Presidents and six by senior<br />
Ministers. The Prime Minister of Canada was in the chair.<br />
Heads of Government warmly welcomed the Prime Ministers<br />
of Bangladesh and the Commonwealth of the Bahamas whose countries<br />
have become members of the Commonwealth since the last meeting<br />
in 1971. They expressed gratitude to the Prime Minister of<br />
Canada for the hospitality provided by his Government.<br />
Oh'n August 3rd the meeting was informed by the Prime<br />
Minister of Malaysia of the sudden death of the Deputy Prime<br />
Minister of Malaysia, Tun Dr Ismail Bin Dato Abdul Rahman,<br />
suspended its proceedings in tribute, and conveyed sincere<br />
condolences to the Government and people of Malaysia and to the<br />
bereaved family. The meeting was positive in tone and constructive in<br />
its approach. Having agreed to new procedures designed to ensure<br />
informality and free discussion, the leaders put aside set-pieve<br />
speeches and addressed themselves directly both to each other<br />
and to the pressing questions before the meeting. When unanimous<br />
agreement was not possible, mutual understanding of conflicting<br />
viewpoints was achieved. It was agreed that in this regard the<br />
meeting established a most useful precedent for future Commonwealth<br />
consultations. The Commonwealth had been greatly strengthened / 2 </p>
<p>by the event and Heads of Government were heartened by this.<br />
Heads of Government were convinced that the association<br />
had once again demonstrated its vitality and flexibility. They<br />
intend to make maximum use of the Commonwealth machinery to put<br />
the principles of the Commonwealth Declaration into practice and<br />
to accelerate the pace of social and economic development among<br />
the less affluent members.<br />
Statement on Nuclear Weapon Tests<br />
Heads of Government issued a statement, on the occasion<br />
of the tenth anniversary of the signing of the treaty banning<br />
nuclear weapon tests in the atmosphere, in outer space, and under<br />
water.<br />
World and Commonwealth Trends<br />
In a frank and informal review of world trends Heads of<br />
Government examined changing power relationships and their political<br />
and economic consequences with particular reference to Commonwealth<br />
countries. Views were exchanged on: changing relationships among<br />
the United States, the Soviet Union and China; problems of security<br />
in various regions; the emergence of new centres of economic<br />
power; the continued atmospheric testing of nuclear weapons,<br />
and the need for a comprehensive test ban treaty and for general<br />
and complete disarmament under effective international control;<br />
the situation in the Middle East and South East Asia; the<br />
establishment of a peace zone in the Indian Ocean; and the<br />
situation in Southern Africa with particular reference to Rhodesia. / 3 </p>
<p>-3-<br />
While welcoming the general relaxation in international<br />
tension, they nevertheless noted those areas of tension which<br />
continue to threaten international peace and security as well as<br />
the widening gap between the rich and poor nations and recongised<br />
the need for the spirit of detente in all international relations.<br />
Acknowledging the potential for progressive change arising from<br />
shifting power relations Heads of Government recognised that<br />
economic and monetary instability continue to pose urgent problems<br />
for the world's community. As the search for solutions to these<br />
political and economic problems was pursued in the context of the<br />
changing power relationships new opportunities arose for states<br />
other than the major powers to influence world developments, to<br />
contribute to the achievement of peace and security, to ensure the<br />
avoidance of spheres of influence and to secure a regime of social<br />
justice9 economic progress and racial harmony throughout an<br />
increasingly interdeoendent world.<br />
Consultation and co-operation in the Commonwealth, an<br />
informal worldwide association, which included no super power,<br />
could make a special contribution to greater international<br />
understanding as well as to the search for solutions to economic<br />
problems. Heads of Government, therefore, stressed the value of<br />
strengthening practical co-operation between member countries,<br />
both internationally and on a regional basis, and working within<br />
other international organisations ardgroupings in order to give<br />
the medium and small countries a more effective voice in internationa<br />
relations to raise living standards and to improve the quality of<br />
life for all their peoples. / 4 </p>
<p>-4-<br />
Heads of Government noted the progress made with regard to<br />
the proposal for a peace zone in the Indian Ocean since the last<br />
conference in Singapore, where they agreed on the desirability of<br />
ensuring that it remains an area of peace and stability. They noted<br />
that the proposal was under study by an ad hoc committee which had<br />
been established by the United Nations and they expressed the hope<br />
that its deliberations would receive the support and co-operation<br />
of all states concerned,<br />
The Heads of Government were greatly concerned about the<br />
deteriorating situation in the Middle East which now presents a<br />
most serious threat to world peace. The deterioration was directly<br />
attributable to the lack of progress in the implementation of the<br />
Security Council Resolution 242 of 1967. They considered that ways<br />
and means should now be urgently sought by all states to give<br />
substance to the Security Council Resolution.<br />
Heads of Government also noted that since the last<br />
conference in Singapore, the Foreign Ministers of the countries<br />
of the Association of South East Asian Nations ( ASEAN) have adopted<br />
a declaration to make South East Asia a zone of peace, freedom and<br />
neutrality. They regarded this initiative as a positive contribution<br />
towards peace and stability in that region.<br />
Trade Heads of Government had a wide-ranging and substantive<br />
discussion on economic issues against the background of widespread<br />
inflation, Particular attention was devoted to problems of<br />
international trade. Heads of Government considered the prospects </p>
<p>for the imnlementation of the generalised system of preferences by<br />
all the developed countries, and for improvements where schemes had<br />
already been introduced or were due to be harmonised. They hoped<br />
that the forthcoming multilateral trade negotiations under the<br />
auspices of GATT would secure world-wide expansion of' trade and<br />
take particular account of the needs of developing countries.<br />
Heads of Government exchanged views on the orospects for<br />
the forthcoming negotiations between the enlarged European Economic<br />
Community and the developing countries of Africa, the Caribbean,<br />
and the Pacific, and exnressed the hope that they would lead to<br />
the conclusion of just, enlightened, and effective arrangements.<br />
The developing Commonwealth countries reiterated their previously<br />
expressed views that the notion of reciprocity could not be a basis<br />
for equitable and enduring relations between them and the EEC, In<br />
the case of the countries to which the joint declaration of intent<br />
in the Tr'eaty of Eqlargement applies, it was urged that the community<br />
should Gake a Dos-Ltive attitude to approaches that have already been<br />
made or might be made, and work out suitable arrangements taking<br />
their trade interests into account before the common external<br />
tariff is applied to British imports from them in accordance with<br />
that treaty. It was recognised that the system of Commonwealth<br />
preferences has provided and continues to provide important<br />
advantages for Commonwealth countries, and the hope was expressed<br />
that the existing favourable arrangements for developing<br />
Commonwealth countries in markets of developed Commonwealth<br />
countries other than Britain should wherever possible be maintained, / 16 </p>
<p>-6-<br />
Heads of Government considered the special problems of<br />
countries highly dependent on cxports of agricultural products in<br />
primary, semi-processed, and processed forms, and noted the<br />
desirability of achieving substantial liberalization of trade in<br />
these products in the course of the forthcoming GATT multilateral<br />
negotiations. They underlined the urgent need for deliberate measure<br />
to be taken by the international community to secure equitable and<br />
remunerative returns for such products. To this end, they considered<br />
it essential that new international commodity arrangements be<br />
devised which would deal with this serious problem and Drotect the<br />
foreign exchange earnings of developing countries against excessive<br />
Drnce fluctuations and inroads from synthetics, thereby increasing<br />
their capacity to buy needed imports. There was need also to<br />
increase the export earnings of developing countries from Drimary<br />
products, especially agricultural products, as prices of industrial<br />
goods continue to rise; and to study methods to introduce a<br />
realistic relationship between the Prices of the two categories of<br />
goods. Commonwealth countries should play an active role in the<br />
search for new international commodity arrangements. It was felt<br />
that it was eaually necessary to explore measures to minimise<br />
fluctuations in the prices of mineral products.<br />
Monetary Issues Heads of Government reviewed the work of the Committee<br />
of Twenty and recognized the urg , ent need to work towards the<br />
achievement as quickly as possible of a new and stable international<br />
monetary order, which would take into account the special concerns<br />
of developing countries, particularly as regards the creation of<br />
a link between special drawing rights and development finance. </p>
<p>-7-<br />
Development Assistance<br />
The meeting examined various aspects of development<br />
assistince, including the disadvantages of tied aid, the need for<br />
a more flexible apnroach by aid donors and the importance of<br />
achieving mutually satisfactory relationships between the donors<br />
and recipients of aid, as well as measures for reducing the onerous<br />
debt burdens of developing countries.<br />
Private Foreign Investment<br />
Heads of Government had a lively discussion of the problems<br />
and opportunities involved in private foreign investment. Special<br />
reference was made to the role of multi-national corporations in<br />
a number of Commonwealth countries. Views were exchanged on possible<br />
techniques for ensuring that the operations of investing companies<br />
are compatible with the national goals of host countries, on the<br />
possibility of promoting the exchange of information on this<br />
subject among Commonwealth countries, and on the desirability of<br />
drawing up a code of conduct for international corporations,<br />
International Transport<br />
Heads of Government exchanged views on a number of<br />
important aspects of international transport problems and their<br />
implications, including rising freight rates, dependence on<br />
foreign-owned shipping, and conflicts of interest created by<br />
differences in labour costs and trade union action among member<br />
countries. </p>
<p>-8-<br />
Food Shortages Heads of Government expressed their concern at the growing<br />
shortages and rising prices of food and their hope that these<br />
problems might be considered without undue delay in appropriate<br />
international forums such as the Food and Agriculture Organization<br />
of the United Nations.<br />
It was noted that the facilities of the Commonwealth<br />
Secretariat were available to examine a number of subjects mentioned<br />
in paragraphs 13 to 22. Such an examination might provide the basis<br />
for further action by Commonwealth countries.<br />
Southern Africa Heads of Government had a full and frank exchange of views<br />
on changes and developments in Southern Africa. The meeting also<br />
gave special consideration to the Droblems faced by countries in<br />
Southern Africa which border on territories and countries still<br />
under minority rule. While recognising that there were complex<br />
and difficult problems involved, Heads of Government were agreed<br />
in their opnosition to apartheid and minority rule in Southern<br />
Africa, They therefore recognised the legitimacy of the struggle<br />
to win full human rights and self-determination.<br />
In discussing conditions in South Africa, Namibia and<br />
the Portuguese colonies, it was agreed that Commonwealth members<br />
in a position to do so should seek to use their influence to<br />
persuade Portugal to grant a negotiated indenendence to its<br />
African colonies. The advisory opinion of the International<br />
Court of Justice and Security Council Resolutions on Namibia / 9 </p>
<p>-9-<br />
were recalled and emnhasis placed on international responsibility<br />
for that territory. There was discussion on how Commonwealth<br />
countries, especially those with economic interests in South Africa<br />
and Namibia, might best bring influence to bear to oromote change.<br />
Heads of Government reviewed the efforts of the indigenous people<br />
of the territories in Southern Africa to achieve self-determination<br />
and independence and agreed on the need to give every humanitarian<br />
assistance to all those engaged in such efforts. The British<br />
Government reserved its position in relation to the last proposal<br />
in circumstances in which assistance might be converted into<br />
military purposes. Heads of Government expressed their intense concern for the<br />
situation in Rhodesia and the damaging consequences of a continued<br />
absence of a settlement. They appreciated the efforts made by the<br />
British Government with whom the responsibility lay and were united<br />
in their willingness to contribute towards a solution. All were<br />
agreed on seeking a peaceful settlement and that the objective<br />
was majority rule. They took note of the meeting between Ian Smith<br />
and Bishop Muzorewa and associated themselves with the British<br />
Government's wish for the discussions to be broadened and the<br />
necessary steps taken to remove restrictions so as to enable all<br />
groups representative of Hhodesian opinion to take part. The<br />
British Prime Minister welcomed the constructive suggestions made<br />
and undertook to take them into account as the situation developed.<br />
Heads of Government considered the report of the<br />
Commonwealth Sanctions Committee and authorised the Committee to<br />
continue its work. It was agreed that in the light of the<br />
recommendations contained in that renort further efforts should </p>
<p>be made to render sanctions more effective pending an acceptable<br />
settlement. Heads of Government also took note of the development<br />
of the Special Commonwealth Programme for assisting the education<br />
of Rhodesian Africans and supported its continuation. The Zambian<br />
Foreign Minister expressed his Government's appreciation of<br />
Commonwealth assistance to Zambia.<br />
Heads of Government welcomed the opportunity to exchange<br />
views on comparative techniques of Government. They had a lively<br />
and useful discussion which included consideration of such subjects<br />
as: the determination of national priorities; the problem of<br />
ensuring effective implementation of Government decisions;<br />
fostering communication between Government and people; the redress<br />
of economic disparities; and the problem of correcting economic<br />
imbalances as between urban and rural areas. Heads of Government<br />
agreed that the question of comparative techniques of Government<br />
should be the subject of further discussion at future Heads' of<br />
Government meetings and that, in the interim the Commonwealth<br />
Secretariat should undertake appropriate preliminary studies<br />
to facilitate such discussion.<br />
Commonwealth Functional Co-operation<br />
Heads of Government agreed that functional co-operation<br />
was an important and dynamic aspect of the Commonwealth. They<br />
expressed warm appreciation of the way in which the Commonwealth<br />
Fund for Technical Co-operation ( CFTC) was developing in meeting<br />
the priority needs of member countries, and commented favourably<br />
on its flexibility and speedy response. They agreed that activities<br />
undertaken through the fund should be intensified and commended<br />
for further study various pronosals for their extension. / 11 </p>
<p>-11-<br />
Heads of Government noted with appreciation the generous<br />
contributions being made by several governments, and especially<br />
by Canada, and hoped that further contributions on a voluntary<br />
basis would be provided by other participating countries.<br />
Heads of Government noted the Secretary-General's<br />
proposal for a target of between one per cent and two per cent<br />
of total Commonwealth aid flows through Commonwealth multilateral<br />
channels. They agreed that further consideration should<br />
be given at the next Finance Ministers Meeting to the means by<br />
which an increased flow could be brought about.<br />
Heads of Government agreed to refer the proposal for<br />
the establishment of a Commonwealth Development Bank and a report<br />
on export credit financing in Commonwealth developing countries<br />
to Commonwealth Finance Ministers for consideration.<br />
Heads of Government gave preliminary consideration to<br />
a proposal for a Commonwealth Centre for Applied Studies in<br />

centre should be studied and a report prepared for consideration,<br />
if possible, by senior Commonwealth officials in 1974.<br />
Commonwealth Youth Programme<br />
Heads of Government endorsed the Commonwealth Youth<br />
Programme which was approved by Ministers concerned with youth<br />
matters. They agreed that the scope of the programme should take<br />
into account the particular needs of individual countries and / 12 </p>
