    <content><![CDATA[<p>FLINDERS ELECTORATE LIBERAL PARTY LUNCHEON<br />MORNINGTON, VIC.<br />" IA 14 OCTOBER 1968<br />Speech by the Prime Minister, Mr. John Gorton<br />Mr. President, Mr. Minister, Councillors and Members and Workers<br />for the Liberal Party:-<br />I think perhaps the first thing I should say is that it is<br />more than pleasant for me to be here in an electorate represented by<br />Phil Lynch. I suppose it is not inappropriate for a Minister of the<br />Army to have begun his tasks by having to undergo a certain baptism<br />of fire, not only from the matters which happened in the Army, not<br />only from difficulties with the Opposition, but with various other<br />difficulties which many of you here will understand as well as I do.<br />He has overcome them all and he is accepted completely and thoroughly<br />as a hard-working and dedicated local Member and as a Minister<br />somebody who has met and overcome the problems so far inherent<br />in his portfolio, and who seems to me to be avoiding new problems<br />with great skill. I suppose before I say anything else, Sir, people here<br />would expect me to make one or two general comments, because I<br />have gathered from random remarks appearing here and there in the<br />newspapers over the last few weeks that there appears to be some<br />discussion or some speculation as to whether there is likely to be an<br />election before the due time at which an election has to take place.<br />Now, the one thing that I really want to say about that is that it is<br />quite fascinating that I have never said a word about it, one way or<br />the other, up until this point of time. And I don't propose to say<br />anything about it at this point of time:' But I will let you into this<br />secret. I made my mind up about it some time ago and I will be<br />informing my Party about it tomorrow. I think that is the proper way<br />for this information to be conveyed to a party meeting.<br />It has been quite fascinating to me to discover how people<br />can suggest and build on things, speculate about things without really<br />getting any indication whatsoever from people who have to decide them.<br />But we will find out about that all in good time.<br />What I do want to say to you, so many of whom I have<br />met before, so many of whom I have known over such a long period of<br />time, is this. Nearly two decades ago, you got tired of a government<br />which seemed to regard five per cent of unemployment as a reasonable<br />amount of unemployment, which seemed to regard controls as a substitute<br />for progress, which soemed to ra-rd stagiaatian as a substitute for<br />expansion. You suddenly got tirW-of that and you changed it. There were<br />people who came out and asked you to help them to-change it, and I was one<br />of them, but it waat you, ind people like you. throughout the whole of Australia<br />who made that change. I think you can take some satisfaction from the results of<br />that change, and in saying this I am speaking of the results under Sir<br />Robert Menzies and under the late Harold Halt, indeed under the<br />administration which you substituted in 1950 for the previous Administration. o / 2</p>
<p>2-<br />It is true to say that beginning then and progressing ever more and<br />more quickly, those old concepts have been discarded. So that now<br />we have, to all intents and purposes, every employable person in<br />Australia gainfully employed, so that now we have as this shire<br />indicates an upsurge of growth, an upsurge of development, throughout<br />the length and breadth of this, our nation; so that we have an<br />abandonment of oppressive control; so that we have more than was<br />ever possible then, an opportunity for that individual initiative of<br />which Phil Lynch spoke, the opportunity of people to take risks and<br />reap rewards if they are successful, take risks and reap the<br />consequences if they are not successful, but at least use their own<br />judgment and advance the nation in so doing.<br />And for nearly two decades this progress continued.<br />It continued without a great deal of basic change in Australia's posit ion<br />in the world or in the problems Australia had internally to face.<br />Things have changed now. We have come to a watershed in Australian<br />affairs. No longer can we, as we have done for I suppose two centuries<br />say, " We are Australian. We are protected by the British Navy. We<br />do not need to protect ourselves. We are available when a First War<br />or a Second War or a Korean War breaks out. We send our contingents.<br />We make what sacrifices are needed, but in the meantime, we are<br />protected by one of the great powers of the world."<br />Now that has gone, gradually at first, and then suddenly<br />and quickly with the decision by Great Britain to withdraw from East<br />of Suez altogether. So that now, besides the efforts we ourselves can<br />make, we are, for our own security, dependent more than ever before<br />on the United States Government providing the protection understood to<br />be provided under the ANZUS Pact. This is a change, a basic change<br />in the history of this nation, and it means, among other things, that<br />we must devote more and more, not of our gross national product,<br />but more and more towards building up our own defences, so that we<br />can, should the time ever arise when it is needed, meet any first.<br />shock of attack upon ourselves or the territories for which we are<br />responsible, meet it, hold it, perhaps beat it back by ourselves, but<br />if not at least meet it, hold it, until further assistance can come.<br />That is why the vote for the defences of this country has<br />risen from what for so long was about $ 400 million, to 250 million<br />this year. It is not something which can bring joy to the heart of any<br />of us because there are so many other requirements for this money,<br />and for what this money could provide. But while it cannot bring joy,<br />it is an -inescapable obligation. I do not propose to provide as much<br />as some of our opponents or some of our I don't know what they are<br />some of the people who stand between us and our opponents, would<br />require to be provided for defence because I believe we need to build<br />up the nation as well. But there is this requirement we are meeting<br />and there is this change in Australia's position in the world and what<br />it has to do. We have another change, I think, a change in social<br />conscience. Up until recently, even during Liberal administration,<br />we took the view that those who are old or ill or invalided or in some<br />other way the subject of the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune<br />should be helped, yes, but should be helped only to a certain degree.</p>
<p>-3<br />We expected that the families of those persons, the charities outside,<br />should contribute to what a government, a people was prepared to do,<br />and that therefore a government and a people were only prepared to<br />make some gestures of help towards those who were so handicapped,<br />towards those who were aged. I don't believe that any longer this is<br />a tenable philosophy. I have abandoned it myself and I have abandoned<br />it on behalf of the Liberal Party. I feel it is necessary to see that<br />people such as this are -provided with enough to live on without having<br />to depend on outside assistance, enough to live on in a simple, frugal<br />way, because after all, we do want savings to continue as well, and<br />self-reliance to continue as well, but at least enough to see there is<br />sufficient to eat, and that there is no requirement to donate blankets<br />in order to keep people warm. This is one of the things this Government<br />will seek to do, is seeking to do. It is a change in approach from what<br />was previously that of the Liberal Party.<br />We have another change. We have suddenly discovered<br />that it is possible to develop this nation far more quickly than ever<br />was thought possible before. I speak not only of the enormous mineral<br />discoveries which have been made, though they are of great significance<br />in the development of areas which previously had nobody living in them<br />at all, enormous significance in adding to our overseas earnings. I<br />speak also of the development of new industries. I speak of the increase<br />in production from each acre of farm land in Australia. I speak of what<br />new technology can contribute and is contributing. This is progressing<br />geometrically. It is not going slowly. It is bounding ahead, and this<br />requires enormous amounts of capital, and enormous amounts of<br />enthusiasm and energy and understanding from the Australian people.<br />This takes me, particularly at this Liberal gathering,<br />to a need to examine some of the basic tenets which, since 1949, have<br />not been examined at all. I speak of a need to stand and quite<br />dispassionately survey the relationships between the various levels<br />of government in Australia the Australian Government, the State<br />Government, the Municipal Government. There was a time, when<br />this party was formed, when it was believed, and when it was a dogma<br />and when it was unquestionable that all an Australian Government ought<br />to do was to hand out particular sums of money to Queensland, or to<br />Western Australia, or to whoever it may be and say, " Spend these in<br />the way in which you think best. I do not think that those conditions<br />prevail any longer. Is it or is it not necessary that an Australian<br />Government should be charged with the responsibility of seeing that<br />the economy of Australia as a whole is managed as a whole so that<br />inflation is kept under control, so that deflation is met by an infusion<br />of credit, so that overseas investment keeps coming in?<br />These are things that need to be examined and argued and<br />discussed. Is it necessary now and here I am going to put my own<br />views and say that I think it is to see that an Australian child, in<br />whatever part of Australia he is born, is offered uniform facilities for<br />education? Is it necessary to see that somebody who falls ill in any<br />division of Australia has the sam e opportunity for treatment in hospital,<br />has the same opportunity for care as he would have in any other part of<br />Australia? / 4</p>
<p>-4<br />It is my belief that the Australian people believe that<br />it is necessary to see that this should happen. But how it is to be<br />brought about is something for discussion by an Australian Government,<br />by State Governments, by Liberal Members and by workers for Liberal<br />parties. Because I do believe that while it is necessary to see that theie<br />things happen, it is also necessary to see that centralist administration<br />from Canberra should not take place, but rather the goal having been<br />set, the achievement of the goal is left to those governments closer to<br />the people than is the central government. This is not to be taken as<br />an abdication of the responsibility of setting the goal:<br />There is something else beyond that, something I have<br />been preaching and something I will continue to preach. That is I thin~ k<br />the time has come, indeed perhaps it is past time when we, wherever<br />we may live in this nation of ours, should begin to feel a real sense of<br />Australianism. We should begin to feel a pride in the nation to which.<br />we belong, begin to look ahead to what this nation should achieve in the<br />way of helping other nations abroad, in the way of compassion inside its<br />own boundaries, in the way of social justice between its people, f eel<br />a belief that whatever we may be we belong to an exciting country. We<br />belong to a nation which in a mere blink of an eye by the end of this<br />century will be 28 million, and then we will go on and on and begin to<br />think with a sense, not of chauvinism, but of national humility how we<br />in this lucky country, as Liberals and as Australians, can best use the<br />opportunities presented to us. We must see that when' we grow to that<br />size, we will not only have mighty industrial muscles, we will not only<br />have vastly increased defence potential, we will not only have, as I hope,<br />an internal compassion for our ill and sick which might not have been<br />seen in any nation before, but we will have also as we go abroad a light<br />in our eye, a fire in our heart, as we hold up our heads and say, we<br />are Australians. And this, in a sense, is a watershed. This in a sense is<br />a goal, and this is something with which you, as you have helped in the<br />past, can help immensely in the future.<br />What is it that Australians want? What is it that<br />individual human beings ought to want? Not only though this is<br />important the opportunity for material well-being, not only the<br />chance to improve the farm on which they live or expand the business<br />which they run or do better work in the factory in which they work and<br />receive more wages; not only that but also a belief which we must instil<br />in them and which we must make real a belief that in improving a<br />farm, in expanding a business, in working harder and getting more wages,<br />they are not only materially improving their position but they are<br />contributing to the sort of thing that I have tried to outline for you.<br />That they are contributing to that kind of country in which their children<br />can grow up, and in their turn contribute for their children. These are<br />the things, the tasks before us some easy, some hard, some specific,<br />some not easy to spell out because they are matters more of feeling than<br />of direct figures. These are what we are after. These are what I think you<br />are after, and judging by the success that you have so far had, if you<br />continue the help you have so far given, I will try to see in the short<br />time I am here that your expectations are fulfilled. They won't be</p>
<p>fulfilled without mistakes being made from time to time because all<br />people make mistakes. Indeed, one would need to be a superman not<br />to. But the attempt that will be made will be honest and I believe that<br />the team we've got will advance along that road which I've tried to<br />point out. I come now, Sir, to a remembrance of something my<br />wife always says to me before I make a speech. She says, " Always<br />remember that those people who are sitting in the room would thoroughly<br />endorse these four lines of poetry:-<br />" I love a finished speaker<br />I really truly do,<br />I don't mean one who's polished<br />I just mean one who's through.<br />I'm through</p>
