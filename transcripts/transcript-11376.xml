    <content><![CDATA[<p>E&amp;OE...................</p>
<p>Well, thank you very much Senator Newman. To you the Attorney-General</p>
<p> and my other Cabinet ministerial and parliamentary colleagues, ladies</p>
<p> and gentlemen.</p>
<p>It is with considerable pride that I have the opportunity of launching</p>
<p> the Government's response to an excellent report of a parliamentary</p>
<p> committee chaired by Kevin Andrews. This committee and the cause of</p>
<p> strengthening and broadening a strategic approach to family policy</p>
<p> has been a very strong personal interest and personal crusade of Kevin</p>
<p> during the time that he has been in the Federal Parliament as the</p>
<p> member for Menzies. And he's made a special contribution to policy</p>
<p> developments in this area. He brings not only a deep personal commitment</p>
<p> but also to his background an understanding of the importance of family</p>
<p> life, the essential role of family life, within the Australian community.</p>
<p> And today's launch and the policies that are behind it would not be</p>
<p> possible without the very creative work of Kevin's committee and the</p>
<p> personal contribution that he has made to it. And I wanted to record</p>
<p> that at the commencement of my remarks.</p>
<p>I also want to thank my ministerial colleagues, Jocelyn and Daryl,</p>
<p> in particular but also a number of others who are here today for the</p>
<p> very positive role that their policy work has played in developing</p>
<p> what I think is a very integrated approach to family policy by the</p>
<p> Government. I think particularly of the contribution of industrial</p>
<p> relations reform. To providing men and women in the workforce with</p>
<p> greater choice and I'll come to that in a moment. I also want to thank</p>
<p> John Herron who's brought to the broader understanding of family life</p>
<p> in Australia the particular challenges and needs of family life within</p>
<p> our indigenous communities. And it's a reminder to us of what a key</p>
<p> role family associations and family links have always played within</p>
<p> the indigenous communities of Australia.</p>
<p>I also thank Richard Alston for his practical recognition of the genuine</p>
<p> alarm of Australian parents about some of the material that is transmitted</p>
<p> in times when it is viewed by Australian children. And can I say at</p>
<p> the outset that I make absolutely no apologies for the fact that the</p>
<p> Government I lead has been willing to take action in relation to that</p>
<p> material. It does not represent a new censorship rather it represents</p>
<p> a recognition of the reality of the genuine concern that Australian</p>
<p> parents have and if governments are not prepared to identify with</p>
<p> that concern then governments are failing in one of the most fundamental</p>
<p> of their responsibilities.</p>
<p>I think we all understand the role and importance of families in the</p>
<p> Australian community. And I guess there's a bit of a dilemma when</p>
<p> you come to examine the Government's role. On the one hand, we all</p>
<p> know that happy family life comes out of personal relationships and</p>
<p> if there is love and security and respect in a home then you have</p>
<p> a stable family and that is the best environment in which to raise</p>
<p> children. We also know that no government can legislate to make people</p>
<p> nice to each other and we all know that governments can't legislate</p>
<p> to make people loving and faithful to each other and no governments</p>
<p> can legislate to dictate or compel a particular pattern of human behaviour.</p>
<p>So in between those two realities you have to strike a balance. On</p>
<p> the one hand you don't want a government running a 'nanny State' telling</p>
<p> you how to behave, heaven forbid. On the other hand you don't want</p>
<p> a government that is utterly disinterested either in providing the</p>
<p> symbols of commitment to family life or indeed the practical policy</p>
<p> measures that help people achieve more satisfactory outcomes in their</p>
<p> families and in their personal relationships.</p>
<p>But what we have tried to do over the last three years is to recognise</p>
<p> that the Government has a limited but a strategic role in developing</p>
<p> family policy. And we have tried to develop a strategy that pays regard</p>
<p> to the fact that in the end it is human behaviour that dictates the</p>
<p> stability of families. And such basic concepts of loyalty and commitment</p>
<p> and personal affection but equally that the way in which Government's</p>
<p> policy impacts on individuals can either increase or decrease the</p>
<p> capacity of individuals to sustain a relationship. Everyone knows</p>
<p> from their experience in dealing with marriage breakdown whether it</p>
<p> be through counselling or giving legal advice or otherwise that financial</p>
<p> pressures are one of the principal reasons why relationships come</p>
<p> apart. And the inability of some people to cope with financial pressure</p>
<p> and to organise simple things such as the household budget are often</p>
<p> at the heart of the breakdown of a relationship between two people</p>
<p> in a family. And therefore you can't ignore the importance of a strong</p>
<p> economy and that's why we have argued very strongly to getting our</p>
<p> economy right and taking $330 a month - you have heard that figure</p>
<p> before but I'll repeat it again - off the average Australian mortgage,</p>
<p> does make an enormous contribution of the capacity of the average</p>
<p> family to, sort of, get over that problem and move onto the next challenge.</p>
<p>I think we also know that for years we have had a taxation system</p>
<p> that has been progressively less accommodating towards the cost of</p>
<p> raising children than it used to be. If you go back 30 or 40 years</p>
<p> you'll find that, relatively speaking, a family was better treated</p>
<p> under the tax system than it is now. And that's one of the reasons</p>
<p> why when we came to office just over three years ago we brought in</p>
<p> the family tax benefit which reversed that trend. And I am delighted</p>
<p> that some of the analysis of our taxation package has indicated that</p>
<p> the largest benefits have gone to many of the low to middle income</p>
<p> families in proportionate terms. And I make no apology for the fact</p>
<p> that we have reversed to some extent the trend over the last 15 to</p>
<p> 20 years against a sole income family. Not because I think the sole</p>
<p> income family is the ideal it's just that I believe in choice and</p>
<p> I believe that people should have the right to organise their family</p>
<p> affairs and the decisions they make about the caring of their children</p>
<p> when they are young according to their own personal preferences and</p>
<p> not according to a model dictated either by a government or the sheer</p>
<p> force of economic circumstance.</p>
<p>And I am very proud of the fact that when the, how should I put it,</p>
<p> when the dust settles and when the clouds move away from the focus</p>
<p> on the detail of what food is in or out of the GST and we start focussing</p>
<p> on the longer term benefits of taxation reform you will that there</p>
<p> are very significant benefits for the generality of Australian families</p>
<p> with a far greater focus on recognising something which all parents</p>
<p> know and that is raising children is quite expensive. And it doesn't</p>
<p> get any less expensive when the children get older, it, of course,</p>
<p> gets increasingly expensive as we all know too. So you can't talk</p>
<p> about family strategies in the context of structures and so forth</p>
<p> without first acknowledging the centrality of the general economic</p>
<p> and social condition in which people live. And if there is a sense</p>
<p> of hope and optimism and stability and security in the community more</p>
<p> families are going to stay together because the pressures on them</p>
<p> are reduced and their capacity to deal with challenges of life are</p>
<p> also reduced.</p>
<p>It is true that bringing together all of these responsibilities within</p>
<p> Jocelyn's portfolio was a major administrative step forward and a</p>
<p> major recognition of the importance of having a unified approach to</p>
<p> family policy. Under, once again, the taxation reform plan we are</p>
<p> going to simplify the payment of family benefits, we are going to</p>
<p> make them more generous and we are going to have a families' assistance</p>
<p> office which is designed to, sort of, look after all of those family</p>
<p> payments. And the whole system from the 1st of July next</p>
<p> year is going to be not only more generous to middle income families</p>
<p> but also dramatically simplified.</p>
<p>So there are a lot of benefits for families in a very tangible form</p>
<p> that are coming out of taxation reform. But in trying to strike that</p>
<p> balance between on the one hand recognising that it's the human personality</p>
<p> that shapes human behaviour and relationships but also recognising</p>
<p> the Government does have a strategic but limited role to provide not</p>
<p> only symbols but also practical support and practical guidance. But</p>
<p> I very much see the approach that we adopt towards family policy in</p>
<p> the context of what I have increasingly described as the social coalition</p>
<p> that this Government is trying to build within our community. And</p>
<p> that is a recognition that acting on its own no one section of the</p>
<p> community can solve all of the problems. And if you leave people completely</p>
<p> to their own devices some are going to suffer and they are going to</p>
<p> fall between the cracks and they are not going to get any assistance</p>
<p> and there is going to be a lot more misery particularly to children</p>
<p> who would otherwise be the case. Equally though if you allow the Government</p>
<p> to be too heavy-handed and prescriptive and interventionist and give</p>
<p> any government the opportunity to do so and it will and it will start</p>
<p> telling people how to behave and how they ought to organise their</p>
<p> family life and how they ought to organise the caring of their children</p>
<p> and how many hours a week some of them should be at work and not at</p>
<p> work - that's also not the solution.</p>
<p>We have great organisations within our community and they do great</p>
<p> work and many of them are represented here today. They also acting</p>
<p> alone can't pick up all of the pieces or provide all of the preventative</p>
<p> education. And, therefore, I talk increasingly about drawing on all</p>
<p> of those resources in a collective sense and recognising that we all</p>
<p> have to work together in what I call a social coalition to tackle</p>
<p> these problems. And you will find dotted through all of our policies</p>
<p> that social coalition. You'll find that increasingly under this Government</p>
<p> we have brought forward the policy role as well as the caring role</p>
<p> of organisations like the Salvation Army and the society of St Vincent</p>
<p> de Paul, to mention but two. We don't just see them as providing a</p>
<p> caring role, although it is tremendously important, we also see them</p>
<p> as providing a policy role because they have a better understanding</p>
<p> of human frailty and of human need than most of us because they're</p>
<p> dealing with it all the time.</p>
<p>We're not, as a government, seeking to withdraw our support. I want</p>
<p> to make it clear, particularly to an audience like this, that when</p>
<p> I talk about the social coalition I do not see that as an excuse for</p>
<p> the Government winding back its support. I see rather it as a device</p>
<p> whereby we can maximise the commitment and the resources that are</p>
<p> available in the community to respond to particular human need and</p>
<p> particular challenges.</p>
<p>One of the first things I did as Prime Minister was to convene the</p>
<p> group that formed the Youth Homelessness Taskforce after I was elected</p>
<p> in 1996. And it was a meeting that took place in my then Opposition</p>
<p> Leader's committee room or meeting room in Chifley Square in Sydney</p>
<p> and to - the other building rather in Sydney - to talk about a commitment</p>
<p> I'd made when I addressed ACOSS in October of 1995 as Opposition Leader</p>
<p> to have a taskforce to look at different ways of responding to youth</p>
<p> homelessness, recognising that youth homelessness was an expression,</p>
<p> a rather brutal expression of family breakdown and family failure</p>
<p> in many cases. And I had as Chairman of that committee Captain David</p>
<p> Eldridge of the Salvation Army in Victoria. And that committee, over</p>
<p> a period of three years, that taskforce developed a new approach,</p>
<p> a new strategy to bring about reconciliation where that was possible</p>
<p> between homeless children and their parents. And I was very pleased</p>
<p> after the last election to be able to announce a significant four-year</p>
<p> extension of the pilot programmes that have been established and which</p>
<p> is going to assist something in the order of 7,000 children and 5,000</p>
<p> parents over a 12 month period.</p>
<p>Now, it's not curing all the problem. Some would say a lot more needs</p>
<p> to be done. The answer to that is, yes it does. But what that approach</p>
<p> did was to recognise the fact that it wasn't just a question of the</p>
<p> Government saying, yes we'll provide support if people declare themselves</p>
<p> to be homeless. It was a question of the Government marshalling the</p>
<p> resources of these agencies, getting beside the young people, finding</p>
<p> out if there were a possibility of reconciliation and if there were,</p>
<p> bringing that about but if there wasn't, ensuring that there was proper</p>
<p> opportunity for those young people to find some hope and some possibility</p>
<p> of betterment in life as time went by.</p>
<p>The social coalition is also very evident in our approach to drugs,</p>
<p> an issue that's never often off the front pages of Australia at the</p>
<p> present time and something that destroys families. In common with</p>
<p> every other member of Parliament in this auditorium this morning some</p>
<p> of the more difficult conversations I've had and the more heartrending</p>
<p> conversations I've had with constituents, some as recently as over</p>
<p> the past few months, of those whose children have died of heroin overdoses</p>
<p> and they ask themselves and they ask me and they ask the community</p>
<p> very difficult questions. And there's no simple answer to that. And</p>
<p> you won't cure the problem of drug addiction in this community unless</p>
<p> you recognise the need to get the Government, to get welfare organisations,</p>
<p> to get individual families and the business community all working</p>
<p> together. And our approach is very much an expression of that social</p>
<p> coalition.</p>
<p>One of the initiatives in the budget of which I was particularly proud</p>
<p> was our implementation of our election undertaking to provide $48</p>
<p> million over five years for a youth suicide strategy. Youth suicide,</p>
<p> particularly amongst males in regional areas of Australia, is one</p>
<p> of the highest in the western world. And when that is occurring inside</p>
<p> a nation that, in general terms, is experiencing a good deal of economic</p>
<p> prosperity and social optimism, it's a particular challenge and one</p>
<p> that we should all endeavour as best we can to respond to.</p>
<p>And I mention those things by way of background, ladies and gentlemen,</p>
<p> to make the point that a sensible family strategy from a government</p>
<p> has got to recognise that in the end you can't, as I said, legislate</p>
<p> human behaviour. But you can put up signposts, you can commit yourself</p>
<p> to symbols and you can provide an economic framework which is conducive</p>
<p> to social and personal stability. You can provide specific incentives.</p>
<p> You can emphasise the importance you attach as a government to stable</p>
<p> families and stable relationships. You can be bold enough to recognise</p>
<p> that perhaps the course of the character of our society and the unwillingness</p>
<p> over many generations, particularly of Australian men but I think</p>
<p> also of men and women but particularly of men, to talk in an open</p>
<p> fashion about their feelings and about their relationships, that over</p>
<p> the years as a society I think because of, I suppose, our make up</p>
<p> we've been a little coy and a little reluctant to recognise that from</p>
<p> time to time all of us need a bit of advice in relation to our relationships</p>
<p> and in relation to our families. I think it's fair to say that until</p>
<p> fairly recently a lot of Australian men would have found it particularly</p>
<p> difficult to even acknowledge the fact that they might need to get</p>
<p> a bit of advice about their relationships and a bit of advice about</p>
<p> how they might keep their families or their relationships together.</p>
<p> Now, I think we're changing. I think we are becoming a lot more able</p>
<p> to verbalise and talk about these things and I think that's a highly</p>
<p> beneficial development.</p>
<p>I think the changed attitude over the last 10 or 20 years towards</p>
<p> domestic violence within our community is a manifestation of that</p>
<p> changed attitude, the recognition that it is a huge social problem</p>
<p> for some people, a recognition that it is the ultimate expression</p>
<p> not of manliness but the ultimate expression of unmanliness, domestic</p>
<p> violence. And it's something as a community we should be more willing</p>
<p> to discuss and to recognise the need to do something about it. And</p>
<p> I think we are a community now that can perhaps talk about the need</p>
<p> to provide people with marriage and relationship education. And that's</p>
<p> a reason why one of the specific announcements I make today is to</p>
<p> trial a voucher scheme in various areas of Australia to provide people</p>
<p> who have indicated their intention of marrying a voucher to defray</p>
<p> the cost of receiving marriage guidance and education. We're going</p>
<p> to trial that on a basis in a number of regions throughout Australia</p>
<p> and if it proves to be successful it's a programme that is going to</p>
<p> be further expanded as time goes by.</p>
<p>We talk a lot about preventative education in relation to drugs. We</p>
<p> talk a lot about preventative health measures. I think we should talk</p>
<p> more about preventative relationship and marriage guidance measures.</p>
<p> And to recognise that for all the resources that we pour into our</p>
<p> schools and our education system there is precious little taught about</p>
<p> the basic realities of parenting, the basic importance of certain</p>
<p> practical things so far as relationships are concerned. In the past</p>
<p> we made the invalid assumption that that was always catered for at</p>
<p> home. Now, in many cases it is and the education that many children</p>
<p> receive from their parents in relation to these matters is infinitely</p>
<p> superior than they will ever receive from anybody else. But that is</p>
<p> not always the case. And some mothers and fathers who are devoted</p>
<p> and loving find it more difficult to provide that kind of support</p>
<p> and advice than others do. And I think we have to be more willing</p>
<p> to recognise in our education processes that that kind of assistance</p>
<p> should be made available.</p>
<p>We are going to establish a marriage and family council which is one</p>
<p> of the recommendations that was made by Kevin Andrews' report and</p>
<p> the details of that are contained in the material that is being made</p>
<p> available to you.</p>
<p>One of the emphasis' within our strategy will, of course, continue</p>
<p> to be the need to provide the best possible environment for parents</p>
<p> to balance their work and their family responsibilities. I've often</p>
<p> spoken of the fact that over the years, although the importance of</p>
<p> family life in our community has not altered but most people still</p>
<p> regard having a secure family life is the most important thing they</p>
<p> can achieve throughout life, the needs and the activities of modern</p>
<p> Australian families are different from what they were a generation</p>
<p> ago. The much higher participation of married women within the Australian</p>
<p> workforce and the growing desire of both men and women to have the</p>
<p> optimum choice regarding the blending of their work and their family</p>
<p> responsibilities is a very important policy challenge. And I think</p>
<p> it really is very much at the heart of an effective family strategy.</p>
<p> Not an approach which says that the desirable model is this or the</p>
<p> desirable model is that but rather an approach which says to the parents</p>
<p> of young Australian children, it is for you to decide what combination</p>
<p> of full-time parental care or paid childcare, at what stage in your</p>
<p> working life, it is you for you to decide what is best for your children.</p>
<p> It is not for the Government to say which is best. But having decided</p>
<p> your desirable arrangement for your family that no one choice is a</p>
<p> lesser or an inferior choice to the other and the idea perhaps a generation</p>
<p> ago that the place of one or other parent is at home, just as that</p>
<p> was wrong, it is equally wrong to embrace the nostrums of some who</p>
<p> suggest that those who choose to have one parent at home full time</p>
<p> while children are young, that in some way that is an inferior choice</p>
<p> and indicative of an unwillingness to embrace the realities of modern</p>
<p> life. I think we have moved to a situation where people look at these</p>
<p> things now more maturely and without the prejudices of a particular</p>
<p> standpoint from which we come.</p>
<p>I'm particularly pleased that the Attorney-General is here today because</p>
<p> the responsibility that he has as the person responsible, in a legal</p>
<p> sense, for the Family Law Act is integral to any comprehensive family</p>
<p> strategy. We have put more resources into marriage guidance. We have,</p>
<p> over the years, recognised the growing importance of that and, in</p>
<p> a sense, what I'm announcing today in relation to providing support</p>
<p> for relationship counselling before marriage is an extension of the</p>
<p> importance that we attach to that.</p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen, in conclusion can I say that the whole purpose</p>
<p> of launching this strategy today is really three-fold. It is to underline</p>
<p> our very strong commitment to the importance of families within the</p>
<p> Australian community, to recognise that whatever changes may have</p>
<p> occurred in Australian society it is still overwhelmingly the case</p>
<p> that most Australians draw not only their maximum emotional strength</p>
<p> and support from their families but also overwhelmingly a great degree</p>
<p> of their physical and material support from those families. It's also</p>
<p> to recognise that family breakdown carries not only financial and</p>
<p> economic costs but also severe emotional costs. And without imposing</p>
<p> in any way a utilitarian definition on it I'm bound to repeat what</p>
<p> I've frequently said before, that apart from its enormous emotional</p>
<p> and personal advantages, a stable functioning family still represents</p>
<p> the best social welfare system that any community has devised and</p>
<p> certainly the least expensive. And an aggregation of stable functioning</p>
<p> families represents, at a national level, the best social welfare</p>
<p> system that any community has devised. But it's also the reality that</p>
<p> not every family functions and it's the role and the responsibility</p>
<p> of governments to help those people whose families have fallen apart.</p>
<p> Firstly to try and prevent the ruptures occurring. But if those attempts</p>
<p> fail to provide a compassionate, sensitive, non-judgemental understanding</p>
<p> of the people who are the victims of family breakdown particularly</p>
<p> children.</p>
<p>Now, no strategy will be total in its provision for these needs. No</p>
<p> strategy will strike completely the right balance between the inevitable</p>
<p> acceptable of the fact that human behaviour is beyond the writ of</p>
<p> any government but by the same token governments have ongoing responsibilities.</p>
<p> But what we have tried to do over the last three years is to strike</p>
<p> a right balance and this strategy that I launch today in response</p>
<p> to Kevin's report recognises those three principles. I think it's</p>
<p> an important milestone in the Government's long policy march towards</p>
<p> a better family policy. I thank Kevin. I thank Jocelyn and Daryl and</p>
<p> all of my other colleagues for the contribution they have made. And</p>
<p> I particularly thank all of you for coming along today to this very</p>
<p> important launch. Thanks a lot.</p>
