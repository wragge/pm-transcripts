    <content><![CDATA[<p>I look forward to welcoming Her Excellency Ms Kolinda Grabar-Kitarović, President of Croatia, to Australia from 12 to 18 August.</p>
<p>Australia strongly values its warm relationship with Croatia. This year marks the 25th anniversary of diplomatic relations between our two nations.</p>
<p>The President’s visit is an opportunity to celebrate the significant contribution of the Australian-Croatian community to Australia’s multicultural society. Over 43,000 Croatia-born people live in Australia and over 133,000 claim Croatian ancestry.</p>
<p>President Grabar-Kitarović’s state visit to Australia is the first by a Croatian head of state since 1995. It follows Foreign Minister Bishop’s successful trip to Croatia last month.</p>
<p>The President and I will discuss opportunities to strengthen commercial and other links between our two countries.</p>
<p>President Grabar-Kitarović will travel to Canberra, Sydney, Melbourne, Port Lincoln and Adelaide during her visit.</p>
