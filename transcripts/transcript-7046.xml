PRIME MINISTER<br />
E OE PROOF ONLY<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW WITH THE PRIME MINISTER BY HAYDN<br />
SARGENT ( RADIO 4BC BRISBANE) -1/ 12/ 86.<br />
H-S: ( missed the beginning of' the question but it went<br />
along tile lines-)<br />
How has your position on uranium and other things affected<br />
your Government's performance and standing In the<br />
Community? And the call f or restraint?<br />
PM Sure as we come to the end of 1986 there's been an<br />
acceptance and appreciation by those people and others<br />
that they have a government, that's prepared to take<br />
tough decisions, not for the sake of being maco and<br />
saying look how tough I am, Out when you lose $ 6 billion<br />
of* national income as we did then adjustments have to be<br />
made, Therets got to be restraint all around and we've<br />
been prepared to stand up and do that, to make tough<br />
tax decisions, to withstand a lot of dishonest advertising'<br />
misrepresentation and I think in the end the people,<br />
including the ones you talk about, will say well I'd<br />
rather have that than the deception and opportunism of<br />
our opponents,<br />
HS If you had known the furors that the FB? was going to<br />
create would you have handled it differently?<br />
PM. Well it's clear from the fact that we made some changes<br />
that we didn't get it right the first time. That's<br />
almost Inevitable because because the whole maze of<br />
contrivances that Come under the category of' trilige<br />
benefits were so extended that It was I guess almost<br />
impossible we were going to pick it all up exactly right<br />
first go. If we could have known what the uninte~ nded<br />
consequences were well we wouldn't have done It obviouslythe<br />
way it was done. but again I think r know the<br />
general public-pretty well and I think in the end the<br />
majority approves of a government that says well all right*<br />
we didn't get it exactly right, the principle is unshakeable<br />
we'll make adjustments in line with that principle-and<br />
get it right the second time. I think they approve or<br />
thait. </p>
<p>-2<br />
Do you think Mr and Mrs Average understands what the<br />
fringe benefits tax is trying to do?<br />
Yes I think they do now, They know, Mr and Mrs Average,<br />
that they pay their tax on their full income every'<br />
week on their PAYE system. I think they are becoming<br />
increasingly aware that there is a minority of their<br />
rellow Australians who don't get their full. remuneration<br />
in their pay packet in the way Mr and Mrs Average do<br />
and that that had meant that minority has been avoiding<br />
paying the full tax obligation and-the fringe benefits tax'<br />
is calculated so that Mr and Mrs Average is not put at<br />
a disadvantage and I think they Increasingly understand<br />
tht. is.<br />
Talking about the economy and you mentioned the<br />
disappointment during the year as far as the economy's<br />
concerned, As I understand it by 1988 our Bicentenary<br />
we could be up around about $ 100 billion In national<br />
debt compared to $ 3.5 billion in 1970...<br />
Well I wouldn't say whiat the figure would be now, what<br />
I am concerned about is will we as we go into 1987 be<br />
seeing the turn-around in that growing monthl y deficit<br />
in current account rigures, and I believe that we will.<br />
That will be happening for two reasons firstly the<br />
volume of Imports will continue to be falling As the<br />
impact of' the depreciation bits and our own manufacturers<br />
become more competitive, arnd on the export side we will<br />
be exporting more, so that on the two sides that deficit<br />
will be coming down provided that not only we but the<br />
international markets sees that that approach is workin.-'::<br />
and that we are not going on accumulating debts in an<br />
accelerating fashion arnd that we're~ restructuring our<br />
economy in a way that is relevant to the changed<br />
circumstances* theb the-Australian economy will be in<br />
good shape not just because we will be doing the<br />
restructuring but because the judgemenit about the<br />
Australian dollar by the market will be one of stability<br />
and we won't. therefore, be under those pressures to<br />
maintain a high interest rate to protect the dollar, the<br />
dollar will be stable, and that menas you will be able<br />
in that circumstance to relax monetary policy to have a<br />
downward movement through 1987 in interest rates and the<br />
Inflation rate coming down in 1987. Those are the<br />
important things.<br />
But that'sa fairly slow process really, isn't It?<br />
Sure. You don't overnight change the accumulated<br />
problems of decades. I mean the Liberals were in for<br />
seven and a half years, they kept our dollar over-valued,'<br />
they ruined the structure of our manufacturing industry<br />
meaning it wasn't competitive, and in those circumStances'j;<br />
what you've got to do is gradually make the changes in<br />
restructuring the manufacturing industry so that we can<br />
retain competitiveness that's now been brought about<br />
by the fall in the value of the dollar, and that's what<br />
we'll do. </p>
<p>HS John Leard Who published the book " The Worst is<br />
Yet to uome" made an Interesting sentence, and I<br />
don! t apply it just to your government but to the<br />
previous governments including the Fraser government,<br />
the Whitlam government and maybe even before that,<br />
he made a sentence " This generation has mortgaged<br />
Australia and future generations will have to pay",<br />
do you think that's true?<br />
PM It's a matter of definition that If any generationhas<br />
a situation where it Is undertaking significant<br />
borrowings let me remind you there is an overwhelming<br />
proportion of the overseas borrowings which we have now<br />
which has not been done by governments, it's been done<br />
by the private sector like Mr John Leard, and I'm not<br />
saying John Leard I don't know what's he's borrowingbut<br />
I'm saying it's the private sector who borrow Overseas,<br />
they have borrowed overseas on the basis of a<br />
commercial judgment that they can invest money that<br />
they have borrowed in enterprises which they judge will<br />
be economic, so that over that longer period they will<br />
be able to generate income which will meet the service<br />
costs of that capital that they borrowed. So in that<br />
sense borrowing of itself should not be seen as something*<br />
which is negative as long as the country has the economic<br />
capacity to service that debt out of future income.<br />
HS We're servicing some of our debts out of borrowed money,<br />
aren't we?<br />
PM Well that of course happens to some extent and we-could<br />
not go on as a country where at the government leyel<br />
you were having budget deficits which I remind you when<br />
we came to office, the upcoming deficit which we inherited<br />
from Mr Howard as Treasurer amounted to 5 percent of<br />
our gross domestic product, and you can't go on doing that,<br />
you can't go on maintaining standards by way of public<br />
expenditure.<br />
HS What is it now?<br />
PM We have brought it down to 1.4 percent.<br />
HS individuals and companies suing unions for<br />
losses experienced as a result of unauthorised strikes.<br />
What's your reaction to that?<br />
PM Our response to this whole question of industrial<br />
relations and sanctions will be delivered in the Parliamei<br />
in the Autumn session when. we resume In 1987 and our<br />
consideration in this matter will come out of a process<br />
of considering the Hancock Report which consisted of<br />
representatives of employers and trade unions from with<br />
an independent chairman, Professor Hancock. They've<br />
made recommendations to the government on how the whole<br />
system of industrial relations should be reviewed and<br />
changes which go also into the question of sanctions and<br />
obviously I'm not going to announce in advance Haydn, I * s<br />
1 A<br />
k. </p>
<p>4<br />
can say this that I believe when you see the decisions<br />
we'll be making in that area of sanctions that you will<br />
approve of what we do and importantly I think there will<br />
be a widespread community approval of the way we go about<br />
this.<br />
HS What do you think of the achievements of your government<br />
in 1986?<br />
PM Oh there's no questions that the main achievement if the<br />
bringing into place the most far-reaching reforms in<br />
the taxation system of this country ever, without going<br />
into it in all its detail what we inherited was a tax<br />
system which waw virtually on. the point of collapse.<br />
and the most outstanding feature of that collapse was<br />
that an increasing burden was placed upon the ordinary<br />
) honest taxpayers of this country who are PAYE taxpayers<br />
and they can't avoid their taxation obligations, and in<br />
the event the marginal rate of tax comes far too high.<br />
Mr Howard's legacy to this country when he walked out of<br />
his office of Treasurer in March 1983 was a top marginal<br />
rate of 60 cents in the dollar. Now I have already now<br />
as a matter of law changed that, the first element of the<br />
tax cuts in this program coming in today and by legislatiot<br />
the second lot coming in on 1 July 1987 that will reduce<br />
that top rate from 60 down to 49 and corresponding<br />
reductions from 46 to 40 and that will mean the avrager<br />
tax will be cut in the order of $ 10 to $ 12 a week and.<br />
that will restore incentive. You can't have incentive<br />
when the top rate if 00 cents. in the dollar so we've<br />
brought that down to 49 cents, Now we've financed that<br />
by ending the rorts the entertainments allowances, the<br />
fringe benefits so that there's been a whole<br />
restructuring of the burden and those that have avoided<br />
their obligation now have to pay it. and as we get<br />
contributions from those who have avoided it in the past<br />
it means we can lift part of the burden on the ordinary<br />
honest taxpayers. That will restore incentive and it<br />
will also make for more efficient economy. because<br />
resources will now be going into productive areas rather<br />
than into concocted schemes using resources.<br />
HS I raise the question of your defence of Paul Keating who<br />
has embarrassed you on two occasions one was on this<br />
question of living away from home allowances,. the other<br />
was on the tax return that he failed to lodge.,...<br />
PM Let's take the two points first the travelling allowance,<br />
Paul Keating has acted absolutely within the rules<br />
relating to travelling allowance laid dewn by the<br />
independent Remuneration Tribunal as have those people<br />
sitting on the front bench of the Opposition who are<br />
acting in exactly the same way. Neither Keating nor the<br />
leading members of the front bench of the Opposition who </p>
<p>are drawing that allowance are acting other than within<br />
the rules of the independent Remuneration Trubunal as<br />
Paul Keating's also acting within the strict guidelines<br />
laid down by the Cabinet.<br />
The tax return thing must have been a bit of an<br />
embarrassment though?<br />
I'm glad that Paul Keating has, without equivocation<br />
acknowledged that he is at fault and he has unequivocably<br />
expressed his regret for that fault. There* s no excuse<br />
and he doesn't attempt essentially to excuse himself<br />
for that fault. Let us have this fact clear there has<br />
been no impropriety the loser as a result of Paul.<br />
Keating's fault is Paul Keating because he will be getting<br />
a refund in respect or that return which he hadn't put In..<br />
and again correspondingly therefore has been the'<br />
Commonwealth revenue. That doesn't excuse his fault<br />
nor do I condone it but there is no question of<br />
impropriety. I, of course, wished he hadn't made that<br />
mistake, but if I nave to draw up a balance sheet about<br />
. Mr Paul Keating and what his activities have meant t0 the..-.<br />
welfare of ordinary Australians then I say that his<br />
unsurpassed achievements in bringing in a fairer tax<br />
sysLem, in seeing that there's going to be an end to<br />
the rorting and that those honest taxpayers are going to<br />
be able to get a fairer go, you can put all that against<br />
this mistake which has cost. him money, then at the bottom<br />
of the balance sheet I have a remarkable man.<br />
Prime Minister on a personal note you had a fairly<br />
meteoric rise to the job of Prime Minister, few other<br />
people have come into the House and spent as little time<br />
on the backbench of the Uppositlon and then into Prime<br />
Ministership what are your thoughts about politics In<br />
Australia? Are you disappointed with what you rind, are.:,<br />
you disillusioned, is it as you expected?<br />
No I'm not disappointed, what you've got to remember is<br />
that politicians in any country are not really going to be*.;<br />
any different to the people of that country itself and<br />
politicians, therefore, of Australia reflects the trengths<br />
and weaknesses of the Australian people.<br />
So we get what we deserve?<br />
Yes and in some respects you get good things and in some<br />
respects you get bad things because Australians are a<br />
mixture. Let me say because I love Australians and.<br />
because without any bullshit if I can use that which is<br />
not offensive but which really picks up what I mean,-<br />
Australians are great people but in their makeup they<br />
have excesses, they have rough spots, they have a toughnesd"<br />
about them and that is rerlected in our politicians,<br />
Australians also have a sense or a falr go. they do I<br />
think have an underlying sense of concern for the under dQI,Å<br />
they do have an underlying compassion and I think all<br />
that's in our politicians, so when you say Austral. lans<br />
S. </p>
<p>-6<br />
get the politicians they deserve or however you want<br />
to express it, we as a group of politicians are In a<br />
sense a microcosm of our fellow Australians.<br />
HS What happens to Bob Hawke after the next election if he<br />
wins. Will he stay on for a full term<br />
PM When we win the next election we will go the full<br />
distance*.*,,<br />
HS You won't call an early election?<br />
PM No.<br />
HS You'll go the full distance?<br />
PM Yes.<br />
HS In spite of whatever may come?<br />
PM My position is that we go the full term amd I can't*<br />
see any reason to qualify that,<br />
HS So if you win you stay on for another full term<br />
PM Oh I would be looking at that full term. I mean I<br />
don't want to stay in politics forever, if I get another<br />
term I would have to take It and at the beginning of. the".<br />
1990s I would have been there seven or eight years..<br />
HS You could become an emmlnent person then...,<br />
PM Well our people might describe me so Haydn but er...<br />
I believe by then I will have put my mark on this<br />
country I<br />
HS Is that a fairly good feeling?<br />
PM Yes I hope it will be a good mark I'm trying my best<br />
to make sure it's a good mark not so I can sit back and<br />
say ' look what a good Job I've done' but I do really<br />
believe this period the latter part of the eighties. is<br />
a critical turning point for the future of this country'*<br />
and let me frame very quickly why I mean that, itts<br />
just at this period that Australians I think have come<br />
to be able to be persuaded and to understand that great<br />
changes have to occur, we've had it luckly I'<br />
fundamental respects we've had our meat and our wool<br />
and our dairy products, and the world wanted them, then<br />
we had our iron ore and our coal and the world wanted them'o<br />
but now suddenly, rather than by a gradual process, the<br />
world has marked down massively the prices of those things*<br />
which cost us about 3 percent of our export income. They<br />
said we're not going to pay you your prices for those<br />
things. Now if we're going to prosper we have to change'<br />
and restructure our industry and the more competitive<br />
. J .54 7<br />
. m </p>
<p>-7-<br />
manufacturing sector, have a more competitive<br />
services sector, and so if we're going to be<br />
competitive In the world we've got to be prepared<br />
to change our practices and our habits, we've<br />
got to derer our expectations somewhat. So it's<br />
hard but it's also a glorious opportunity because<br />
we've got so many great resources, both politically<br />
and naturally, we're prepared to make those decisions<br />
now we, this generation. this time in Australia and the<br />
people in it, can make an enormous contribution to the<br />
future welfare of the coming generations of Australians.<br />
I'm not being dramatic that is factual that to be put in<br />
a position where you've got the opportunity of leading<br />
the country to make those changes is a privilege<br />
and an opportunity something that hasn't been given<br />
to anyone before. I'm excited about it but more<br />
importantly I'm optimistic about it.<br />
And if at that next election you happen to lose, would<br />
you sit in Opposition?<br />
No I wouldn't think that would be appropriate, if y<br />
party pressed me to I would consider it if there was a<br />
suggestion that that wasthe way forward but I know that<br />
by the time we go to the next election the people will<br />
know we've had enormous achievements and for that reason<br />
I-believe we will win,<br />
Prime Minister, thank you.<br />
Pleasure Haydn, always to talk to you.<br />
