<p>The Prime Minister, Mr Whitlam, announced today thatÂ his foreshadowed visit to China this year would take place fromÂ 31 October to 3 November.</p>
<p>The visit will be the first official visit to ChinaÂ by an Australian Prime Minister, but it will be Mr Whitlam'sÂ second visit. He first visited China in July 1971 when Leader Â of the Opposition.</p>
<p>Mr Whitlam said that his visit would urovide a valuableÂ opportunity to exchange views with the Chinese leadership on aÂ wide range of international i sues as well as bilateral questions.Â Mr Whitlam commented that the visit would be particularly usefulÂ in reviewing the development of Australia's relations with ChinaÂ since the Government recognised the People's Republic inÂ December 1972.</p>
<p>Mr Whitlam will be accompanied by the TreasurerÂ ( Mr Crean), the Minister for Northern Development ( Dr Patterson)Â and the Minister for Minerals and Energy ( Mr Connor) who willÂ hold discussions with their Chinese counterparts.</p>
<p>Mr Whitlam said that the participation of these MinistersÂ would both broaden the exchanges and enable the participants toÂ focus in depth on specific areas of mutual interest. He commentedÂ that he was pleased with the urogress made in Australia's relationsÂ with China to date, particularly in view of the long period ofÂ isolation between the two countries. He said he hoped his visitÂ would make a significant contribution towards the development ofÂ a broader and more balanced relationship with China.</p>
<p>Mr Whitlam will be accompanied by Mrs Whitlam and aÂ number of senior officials.</p>
