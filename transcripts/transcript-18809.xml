    <content><![CDATA[<p>Parliament House, Canberra</p>
<p>In 2012 the process of post-war migration reached 'retirement' age - 65 - the full span of a working life.</p>
<p>Sixty-five years since the first post-war migrants landed on our shores and began the greatest change to our country's texture and fortunes since European settlement.</p>
<p>Those first migrants in January 1947 were British tradesmen, who'd left the bombed out cities of their old land to help build the newest city of their new nation.</p>
<p>When one of the new migrants saw the empty fields of this capital, he asked jokingly where's Canberra?</p>
<p>And one of the locals replied, with greater meaning than they probably intended, you're here to build the place.</p>
<p>They weren't just here to build offices and houses.          </p>
<p>They came to help build a nation.</p>
<p>That's what migration is: an act of nation-building. And multiculturalism is how we make it work.</p>
<p>Multiculturalism is not just the ability to maintain our diverse backgrounds and cultures.</p>
<p>It is the meeting place of rights and responsibilities. </p>
<p>Where the right to maintain one's customs, language and religion is a balanced by an equal responsibility to learn English, find work, respect our culture and heritage, and accept women as full equals.</p>
<p>Where there is non-negotiable respect for our foundational values of democracy and the rule of law, and any differences we hold are expressed peacefully.</p>
<p>Where old hatreds are left behind, and we find shared identity on the common ground of mateship and the Aussie spirit of a fair go. </p>
<p>What we saw in Sydney on the weekend wasn't multiculturalism but extremism.</p>
<p>True multiculturalism has a very different face.</p>
<p>It is the face of a new migrant studying hard in an English language class.</p>
<p>Working two jobs to put their kids through school.</p>
<p>Or lining up to vote for the very first time.</p>
<p>True multiculturalism includes, not divides.</p>
<p>It adds more than it takes.</p>
<p>In the end, multiculturalism amounts to a civic virtue since it provides us with a way to share the public space.</p>
<p>A common ground of inclusion and belonging for all who are willing to toil with hearts and hands.</p>
<p>And because it always summons us toward a better future, multiculturalism is an expression of progressive patriotism in which all Australians, old and new, can find meaning.</p>
<p>Those first post-war migrants understood these things in times much tougher than our own.</p>
<p>This generation must understand them as well because our multicultural achievement is too precious to be brought into question by the reckless actions of a few.</p>
<p>Remember, migration and multiculturalism aren't just another set of policies than come and go with the tide of politics and events.</p>
<p>They are nation-building commitments which transcend partisanship and politics, to stand at the core of our identity as Australians.</p>
<p>My predecessor Ben Chifley understood that when the first migrants came here to Canberra.</p>
<p>Chifley and our founding Immigration Minister, Arthur Calwell, met these young migrants outside what is now Old Parliament House.</p>
<p>Chifley also went out to the camp where they lived - anonymously and without a secretary or guard - to see how the men were being looked after.</p>
<p>There's a striking symbolism in those young brickies and carpenters being welcomed by the nation's Prime Minister in the heart of our democracy.</p>
<p>These gestures were not accidental.</p>
<p>They were the deliberate actions of leaders who understood what they had done by bringing those 200 tradesmen to Australia.</p>
<p>They knew they had begun a journey that would transform our nation forever.</p>
<p>A journey we must continue in the spirit it was begun.</p>
<p>Friends,</p>
<p>I am part of that journey.</p>
<p>I am one of the migrants who has made Australia's story their own, and I told my story at the Council's launch a year ago.</p>
<p>I told of the brave decision my parents made to leave everything that was close and familiar to venture upon a new and unknown land.</p>
<p>I told of how we arrived to be welcomed by a warm and generous people.</p>
<p>I told of how my parents taught me and my sister the value of hard work to earn our keep and do our best.</p>
<p>So I stand here before you today as the very proud daughter of John and Moira Gillard.</p>
<p>Migrants.</p>
<p>My late father spoke of the modest aspiration he brought to our prospects in Australia.</p>
<p>But in his long life, he came to learn that remarkable things can happen in a remarkable country.</p>
<p>Millions of other migrants know it too.</p>
<p>Years and decades of hard work, and suddenly your son is a doctor.</p>
<p>Your grandson is a judge.</p>
<p>Your daughter is Prime Minister.</p>
<p>It's what happens when you seize and shape the future rather than shrinking in fear of it.</p>
<p>If there is one Australian who understands these things only too deeply, it is Frank Lowy.</p>
<p>Frank's pathway was indescribably hard.</p>
<p>From Czechoslovakia and the perilous streets of occupied Hungary to France, Cyprus and Mandate Palestine.</p>
<p>Surviving the horrors of the Holocaust that claimed his own father's life.</p>
<p>Facing years of uncertainty in the aftermath of war.</p>
<p>And finally coming to Australia to begin the longest and greatest chapter of his incredible life.</p>
<p>Frank, you are, indeed, an extraordinary Australian.</p>
<p>And your family's life tells a great Australian story.</p>
<p>You couldn't get the education you deserved.</p>
<p>All your boys went to university.</p>
<p>You couldn't always find enough food or clothing as a child.</p>
<p>Now you enjoy prosperity beyond any childhood dreams.</p>
<p>Your father was a humble travelling salesman who did it tough during the Depression and wartime years.</p>
<p>Now you own the greatest retail network on earth.</p>
<p>You couldn't enjoy Europe's cultural riches because of the Nazis.</p>
<p>Now your son is President of the NSW Art Gallery.</p>
<p>All this because of that single decision you took to emigrate six decades ago.</p>
<p>This is the point upon which our whole multicultural experience turns: decisions and choices.</p>
<p>From those epic decisions like Chifley and Calwell's first big call around the Cabinet table.</p>
<p>To our millions of individual decisions as migrants to undertake the journey.</p>
<p>And our countless choices as Australians to extend our hands and share our home.</p>
<p>They are the brave decisions that start as a glimpse through a keyhole and end up swinging open a wide and welcoming door.</p>
<p>Together they form one of our nation's greatest stories, and to explore it further, I am proud to introduce the inaugural AMC lecturer: a distinguished Australian.</p>
<p>The wise and generous Frank Lowy.</p>
