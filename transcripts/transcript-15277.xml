<p>Good morning,</p>
<p>Providing jobs for as many people as possible is one of the most important challenges for any government; and governments should be judged on their capacity to create the right economic environment for job creation.</p>
<p>Yesterday's unemployment rate - a 33 year low at 4.2 per cent - is hard evidence that my government is doing just that.</p>
<p>2.2 million jobs have been created since 1996 and more than 430,000 people have found work since our workplace reforms were introduced last year.</p>
<p>There are more Australians working than ever before and their wages after inflation are also rising. Working families and individuals are enjoying the stability and confidence that comes with employment.</p>
<p>It's good news, but more can be done. My goal is for Australia to become a full employment economy where anyone who wants a job and is able to work, has a meaningful career.</p>
<p>When last in government, the Labor Party had a shameful record on unemployment that included one million Australians out of work. </p>
<p>The Coalition has a plan to maintain Australia's prosperity, keep producing more jobs and preserve the current low unemployment rate. Labor has no plan to keep the economy strong.</p>
