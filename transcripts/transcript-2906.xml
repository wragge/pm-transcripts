Press Statement No. 81<br />
2 May 1973<br />
SOUTH AU STRALIAN RAILWAYS<br />
( Joint Statement by the Prime Minister, the Honourable<br />
E. G. Whitlam, M. and the Premier of South<br />
Australia, the Honourable D. Dunstan, M. L. A.)<br />
Talks are about to begin on the transfer to<br />
the Australian Government of responsibility for the<br />
South Australian Railways, excluding suburban services.<br />
This was announced today in a joint statement<br />
by the Prime Minister, Mr. Whitlam and the Premier of<br />
South Australia, Mr. Dunstan.<br />
Their statement said:<br />
" Our two Governments have today agreed to begin<br />
discussions with a view to devising a mutually<br />
satisfactory basis for the transfer.<br />
Agreement has been reached on the composition<br />
of a joint Federal/ State committee to begin immediate<br />
investigation on this matter.<br />
At the same time the Governments have agreed<br />
that the present employees of South Australian<br />
Railways be given an unequivocal guarantee that,<br />
irrespective of the final decision on the<br />
responsibilities to be transferred, they will be<br />
employed in either the State or Commonwealth services.<br />
We consider this to be a matter of basic<br />
principle fundamental to the negotiations."<br />
The Commonwealth/ State committee which has been<br />
appointed will report jointly to the Federal minister<br />
for Transport, Mr. C. K. Jones, and the S. A. Minister of<br />
Transport, Mr. G. Virgo. It will be supported, as<br />
necessary, by specialist sub-committees. A standing<br />
sub-committee will be established to report on Conditions<br />
of Employment for South Australian Railways employees.<br />
This sub-committee will include a senior officer of the<br />
South Australian Trades and Labour Council.<br />
CANBERRA, A. C. T. </p>
