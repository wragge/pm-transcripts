PRESS STATEMENT NO. 511<br />
9 June 1975<br />
MESSAGE OF SYMPATHY TO BURMA<br />
The Prime Minister, Mr Whitlam, said today<br />
that the Government has expressed its sympathy to the<br />
people of Burma for the loss of life and damage caused<br />
by the recent cyclone in the Irrawaddy Division of<br />
Burma. He said that in the light of Australia's<br />
recent Darwin experiences the Government appreciated<br />
the difficulties and challenges the Burmese Government<br />
faced in the task of reconstruction.<br />
The Australian Government has decided to make<br />
an allocation of $ A10,000 to the Burmese Government for<br />
relief purposes. Mr Whitlam said that he hoped that<br />
this would go some way to assist Burma with the<br />
purchase of essential itmes for cyclone relief.<br />
