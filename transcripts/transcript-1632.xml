FOR PRESS IIBR AVW4<br />
PM. No. 78/ 1967<br />
VISIT OF U. S. MISSION<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister, Mr Harold Holt<br />
President Johnson's special representatives, General Maxwell<br />
Taylor and Mr Clark Clifford, arrive in Canberra tomorrow morning.<br />
Accompanied by Ambassador Clark, they are to commence talks with me<br />
and some of my senior colleagues at the Lodge at noon. We will have a<br />
working lunch and continue our talks through the afternoon.<br />
If necessary we shall meet again in the course of Sunday.<br />
Other Ministers present will be the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister<br />
for Trade and Industry, Mr McEwen, the Treasurer, Mr McMahon, the<br />
Minister for External Affairs, Mr Hasluck, and the Minister for Defence,<br />
Mr Fairhall. This visit will be part of the series General Taylor and Mr<br />
Clifford are making at the request of President Johnson to the group of<br />
countries represented at the Manila Summit Conference of October last<br />
year. One of their purposes will be to canvass the desirability, time and<br />
place of another such meeting. Wie had agreed at Manila that it was<br />
desirable we should confer again. The question of another meeting has<br />
been discussed informally by me with four of the national leaders who<br />
attended the Manila Conference with whom I have come into direct personal<br />
contact in the course of the year Prime Minister Ky, Mr Holyoake,<br />
President Park and President Johnson. We feel that it would be useful to<br />
meet again, but it has been my own view that this meetiffg should occur<br />
after the Presidential election has been held in South Vietnam.<br />
Tomorrow's meeting comes within a sequence of exchanges,<br />
not only between Austr alia and the United States, but in various forms between<br />
the countries represented at Manila. The Foreign Ministers of all the<br />
countries met in Washington in April and there have been subsequent<br />
discussions between Ambassadors, in addition to extensive diplomatic<br />
communication. Australian/ American consultations are continuous at the<br />
diplomatic level, supplemented from time to time by visits of Government<br />
leaders or representatives to the United States or to Australia. The present<br />
visit falls in this latter category.<br />
As President Johnson has publicly indicated, the purpose of<br />
this particular visit is to follow up the assessment made by Secretary<br />
McNamara from his recent mission to Vietnam, and to discuss fully with<br />
the Manila Conference group of nations all aspects of the situation there.<br />
We welcome it as a practical and further expression of the known desire of<br />
the United States Government to conduct its policies in relation to Vietnam in<br />
full consultation with its allies.<br />
The visit will be most valuable in sustaining at the top levels of<br />
government of the participating countries a close exchange of views about the<br />
conduct of our comibined effort to bring an end to communist aggression and to<br />
/ 2 </p>
<p>-2-<br />
promote peace and progress in Vietnam.<br />
Mr Clifford and General Taylor have a high place in the<br />
confidence of the United States Administration and of the allied governments.<br />
WVe give them a warm welcome to Australia as friends and partners in the<br />
tasks we share with their country and our other allies.<br />
CANBERRA, 28th July, 1967. </p>
