    <content><![CDATA[<p>I am pleased to announce that I will visit the United States to meet President Obama on 24 March.</p>
<p>I will be discussing with him a coordinated international response to the global economic crisis and how we can work together in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>We will also discuss how we can have even closer cooperation between our two countries on the great shared challenges of climate change, nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation, and the future shape of the Asia-Pacific region.</p>
<p>Our alliance with the United States is the bedrock of our foreign and security policy. A strong relationship with the United States is critical for Australia's future.</p>
<p>I look forward to using my meetings in Washington to build on the strong ties that already exist between our nations.</p>
