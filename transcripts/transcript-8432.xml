TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP,<br />
ADDRESS TO ELECTORATE OFFICE STAFF, WORKERS CLUB, CANBERRA<br />
MARCH 3 1992<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
Thanks very much for that very nice welcome and thank you<br />
Bob ( McMullanr) for the introduction and for warming up the<br />
crowd. It is always important, I think, for people at the coal face<br />
of the Labor Party and its representation to know what the<br />
Government is doing and to be aware of the general direction<br />
and detail of the policy, and so therefore I thank you for<br />
coming today and I thank the National Secretariat for<br />
organising it.<br />
It is important that when people, phone your offices and<br />
enquire about details of the various policy changes that you<br />
are in a position to know about the details and fit them<br />
into a bill of context. And so it is very useful, I think,<br />
for you to bother to come and to get that perspective and<br />
get the perspective right.<br />
The interesting thing about the ' 80s and early ' 90s was that<br />
it was Labor that taught Australia change. It was not the<br />
Liberal Party. The Liberal Party put Australia to sleep, in<br />
policy terms, for a generation. And when we became the<br />
Government, -the public of Australia were not used to change<br />
and they never had change. The fact is we taught them<br />
change, we taught the media change, we taught the whole<br />
political system change. And the thing about it is, the<br />
public now wants ' change. It's now become a driver in<br />
change. So instead of the Government tugging along with the<br />
community, the Opposition and everyone else, what's happened<br />
now is that -the public are actually interested in change and<br />
they are forcing' change and they're requiring change. And<br />
when they thought in the last year or so that we were not<br />
introducing change as quickly, they looked elsewhere for<br />
change. And whenever anyone else proposed something which<br />
was solid, then they lifted their eyebrows and looked. And<br />
when of course the Opposition came with its GST camouflaged<br />
as a policy change, they even looked at that. 7. </p>
<p>-2<br />
But the fact is, it is we who have made the great changes.<br />
We are the people who have decided that we can no longer<br />
live shearing sheep and growing wheat, that would no longer<br />
pay for our imports, and it would no longer produce jobs<br />
where we needed-them in the capital cities, that would<br />
consign a generation of Australians to the unemployment<br />
scrap heap. These were the problems we faced when we came<br />
to office in the early period of the 1980s.<br />
We decided -that we had to re-modernise the Australian<br />
economy, revitalise it, and we had to start investing in our<br />
people. Anti we started investing in our school children by<br />
keeping them on at school by putting them through<br />
universities, investing in the aged as well as young peoplE.<br />
and middle aged people. So we covered the spectrum, decided<br />
to invest in our community, to talk to it, to operate a<br />
policy of consensus, to get a better national resul~ t which<br />
has totally changed the way in which Australia now operates.<br />
That is, we have now become an international country. For<br />
the first tiLme ever in the last twelve months the value of<br />
manufactured exports exceeded rural exports. The big<br />
service sect~ ors we developed in the ' 80s, like tourism and<br />
financial services, are new to Australia and providing jobs<br />
all over the country.<br />
And so we have had this very big change running through the<br />
1980s interrupted by the boon of 1988-89 and the recession<br />
which followed. But, nevertheless, with a clear direction<br />
out the other side to a low inflationary prosperous future.<br />
Now the chal~ lenge to us was to keep those changes going, to<br />
show that we were the people that stood back and said now<br />
what should we do now, what changes are best from this point<br />
on? And we had ' a process of consensus, we talked to people<br />
in the business community and in professions and across the<br />
community generally, the trade unions, the welfare<br />
organisations and said we think we have a fair idea where<br />
we're going, giv e us your views about where you think we are<br />
now and we'l~ l see where that fits into our scheme of things.<br />
And we produced ' One Nation'. And One Nation is the policy<br />
of Labor from the ' 80s in the continuum. It's taking it<br />
down into those areas of the micro-economy after the great<br />
policy changes of the macro-economy have been left behind.<br />
That is, as we now have the challenges to make Australia<br />
more efficient and more competitive it matters greatly then<br />
that we dea. with the States, particularly in these<br />
instrumental. ities which have such a great impact on the way<br />
in which the! country functions.<br />
So we have said these things. How do we make Australia more<br />
efficient? How do we make the rail system more efficient?<br />
How do we get a container through a port more quickly? How<br />
do we have FU competitive airline system? How can we supply<br />
power at competitive prices? How can we train our kids? how<br />
can we give capital support to do more in terms of<br />
investment which is the sole generator of employment? These </p>
<p>3<br />
are the things we did. We sat down and said what can we now<br />
do for Australia which is best?<br />
And what marks us out different to the Liberal Party, when<br />
John Hewson had to sit down as Opposition leader and say<br />
what can I now do as leader of the Opposition, what should I<br />
now do for Australia, what is best for Australia? He sat<br />
down, rather, and said what can I do that makes me different<br />
to Labor? Not what's best for Australia or how do I keep<br />
these great policy changes going or how do I make the place<br />
more efficient, but how can I be different? And then, of<br />
course, he then decided on his goods and services tax, the<br />
Hewson Consumption Tax. And he camouflaged it in all of his<br />
other changes so that the nastiness of the tax wouldn't<br />
become immediately apparent.<br />
But the contrast is that's not what we did. We sat down and<br />
said what is the next thing we should do, and we decided on<br />
these things. We decided at a time when private investment<br />
was down to lift public investment, not a leap of logic, not<br />
a change of policy, though we have had some commentators<br />
saying that the change of policy is an entirely reasonable<br />
thing. When the economy was booming in the ' 80s we withdrew<br />
all, or as much as we could, of the public stimulus by<br />
producing budget surpluses. And now that private investment<br />
is weak we've decided to lift public investment, and we've<br />
lifted it where it matters. It matters entirely whether the<br />
port of Brisbane is connected to the railway line to Sydney,<br />
it matters entirely whether the travelling time between<br />
Sydney and Melbourne on the railway train can take trucks<br />
off the road and deliver us an efficient, competitive,<br />
relatively cheap freight service. It matters. It matters<br />
that Melbourne can ship freight north to Brisbane and beyond<br />
and west via Adelaide to Perth. It matters, it matters to<br />
Australia. It matters that a ship can dock in Adelaide,<br />
load cargo and deliver it within a day to a factory in<br />
Sydney or Melbourne. It matters that a ship can come into<br />
Fremantle and land bridge freight across the continent to<br />
Adelaide, Melbourne, Sydney, Brisbane as the case may be.<br />
These things are the basic machinery of trade, let go by two<br />
generations of Liberal politicians. Two generations of them<br />
decided to invest nothing in rail, two generations decided<br />
to let that thing go, two generations decided simply to<br />
respond to Country Party pressure for roads and to not think<br />
about the way in which our highway system was developing.<br />
To not plan for trucks mauling the domestic roads of our<br />
capital cities, to not put the ring roads in, to not do the<br />
things which even were part and parcel of their own<br />
strategy. So these things matter. It will matter that a<br />
business looking for electrical power can ask for bids and<br />
have a bid from a Queensland power station, a New South<br />
Wales power station, a Victorian power station and have that<br />
power station fund the grid and supply that power. And that<br />
power price might make all the difference to whether that<br />
investment is undertaken, whether that business succeeds and<br />
whether the product of that business in internationally<br />
competitive. </p>
<p>4<br />
We have a great natural advantage. Countries should play to<br />
their competitive strengths. One of our competitive<br />
advantages is a coal seam right down the east coast of<br />
Australia. One of things we should be able to produce<br />
cheaply, very cheaply, is electricity. But while ever we<br />
run these state-bound systems with over-capacity, undercapacity<br />
all these other problems, we will never actually<br />
realise that potential.<br />
Now is this going to happen by taxing your Kelloggs<br />
Cornflakes? Is the railway line going to improve itself?<br />
Are the bridges going to be lifted? Are the roads going to<br />
be straightened? Are the dedicated freight lines out of<br />
Sydney going to be created? Are the electricity grids going<br />
to be created? by taxing the old Weet-Bix or the socks and<br />
shirts and shoes or the dry cleaning or the other services<br />
which make up part of daily life. And, of course, the<br />
answer is it won't. It won't, and what we've found now with<br />
this Treasury study is that the Treasury has blown even the<br />
distributional features of the so called Fightback<br />
Fightbackwards is a better name for it, Fightbackwards, the<br />
Fightbackwards program, the backward program of the Liberal<br />
Party, the distributional features of it actually make most<br />
Australian families worse off, most Australian tax payers<br />
worse off.<br />
So not only do they not tackle the big things which are now<br />
the next phase in our changes, cracking all of these<br />
problems in the micro-economy, railroads, ports etc. Not<br />
only do they not tackle those, but as well as that they<br />
actually retard the economy with a tax which lifts the<br />
inflation rate, slows down domestic product and lifts<br />
unemployment so says the chief modeller associated with<br />
the Hewson Fightback package.<br />
Now, that's what it's all about. I mean, again here is<br />
Labor sitting down, taking its breath, thinking, talking,<br />
deciding and getting another great raft of changes going,<br />
including a big tax break for capital, with a new<br />
depreciation rate. I never minded giving capital a tax<br />
break in this country. We're the people that brought the<br />
corporate rate from 49 to 39 per cent. We're the people<br />
that gave them dividend imputation. We're the people now,<br />
giving a world ranking, competitive depreciation schedule.<br />
Because it's capital that creates the jobs. It's capital<br />
that puts that basic investment in. But if you look at the<br />
Fightbackwards program, they have got the company rate going<br />
backwards, from 39 to 42 per cent, nothing for depreciation,.<br />
nothing that will actually change the way in which<br />
investment operates. And with the inflation rate rising,<br />
the inflation rate doubling on Dr Hewson's own submission<br />
and with it a consequent rise in interest rates.<br />
So just as a Government is providing a very low cost of<br />
capital regime, via interest rates and depreciation, just as<br />
we are really setting the place so the investment can really<br />
start rolling again, here is the Liberal party saying, no, </p>
<p>no, no, what we ' think we are is higher inflation and higher<br />
interest rates. The Coalition will actually stick the<br />
company tax right up. And just while we are at that, we'll<br />
have a confrontation with labour, we'll try and wipe the<br />
unions out, we'll knock out national wage cases, there will<br />
be no concensus under us, and if there is any inflation<br />
moving I will just say to the central bank, stick the<br />
interest rates up further, so says Dr Hewson. And we just<br />
slipped back into a low growth mode. Not the 4 per cent in<br />
our program that will deliver 800,000 jobs in 4 years, none<br />
of that, but much lower rates of growth as they hit the<br />
monetary brakes.<br />
Now, in ' One Nation', we've tried to bring the community<br />
together. To bring the unions together with business, a<br />
partnership between government and business. We're trying<br />
to get Australia going. No ideological approach, simply<br />
looking at the problems and trying to get a result. And the<br />
business community basically took the same view when they<br />
were meeting us. There was no ideology. People said, look<br />
forget all that, we are not here to say we want this, we<br />
want that, we just want to get cracking again. We want you<br />
to do this and do that, if you can do it. And we have<br />
undertaken those, things.<br />
As well as that we've done a couple of other very<br />
interesting things. We're going to take the TAFE system,<br />
the weak breed of Australian education, and make it a strand<br />
of equal strength with the universities. We are going to<br />
take that system closest to the community, beyond school,<br />
TAFE, where people train themselves for the first time, and<br />
retrain themselves and give it a status and a place in the<br />
Australian education system of substance and importance. In<br />
other words, we said its just not good enough to be A clever<br />
country, one has also got to be a capable country. And that<br />
means getting that capability up across our workforce, and<br />
so we will see a revolution in TAFE and we will do for it<br />
what the Commonwealth was able to do for universities.<br />
Now John Hewson says, its irresponsible and its<br />
unaf fordable. It's irresponsible, the package is<br />
irresponsible and it's unaf fordable. He does not want to<br />
invest in those children. when we came to office 4 children<br />
in 10 only completed secondary school. They weren't worried<br />
about the other 6 in 10 that were left to wander off and try<br />
and find their way around, untrained, uneducated around the<br />
labour market, drifting into all the problems that young<br />
people drift intb in that sort of state. They were never<br />
ever interested in lifting the retention rates in secondary<br />
school after we did it. And at the same time we lifted the<br />
intake in the universities creating the equivalent of a<br />
dozen universities' since the middle ' 80s, 120,000 places<br />
in higher education. They will embeace that, but their<br />
feeble policy to that is, it should be freedom to achieve,<br />
so that if you have $ 12,000 or $ 13,000 to send your child to<br />
university, -that's as it should be. Places provided if you<br />
pay for them. But to earn $ 12,000 or $ 13,000 after tax, you<br />
have got to earn $ 20,000 or $ 25,000 pre tax, and for even a I </p>
<p>6<br />
two income familys it's half their income to send one child<br />
to university. That's what they call ' equal opportunity',<br />
that's what they call ' freedom to achieve'.<br />
And so, they're quite happy to embrace our reforms... out of<br />
the universities, having done nothing about themselves about<br />
it themselves, but criticise it. But on the outside we'll<br />
take the rest of those kids who can't find a place in<br />
university because of their marks, or the available places,<br />
or the inavailability of places, but who can have<br />
interesting and fulfilling lives in a myriad of places in<br />
the economy. They are now saying that it's irresponsible<br />
and it's unaffordable, but they won't invest in our children<br />
in this respect. And this is unbelievable, unbelievable for<br />
a party which claims of itself to be interested in the<br />
freedom to achieve and the right to excel and all the rest<br />
of it.<br />
The fact is, as always, it's only Labor that's ever really<br />
interested in the great body of the Australian population.<br />
They are about basically a tax break for the wealthy, and<br />
what the Treasury study will show you, is the Liberal party<br />
policy at its usual, that is, Fightback is not a package of<br />
reform and change, it's an excuse for a tax. It's simply an<br />
excuse for a tax. And a tax which shifts income from the<br />
low paid to the high paid. And on the way through, make<br />
sure that all the things that are worth doing, like giving<br />
kids the technical education, like lifting the capacity for<br />
capital investment in Australia, like fixing up the<br />
industrial archaeology of the railways, like making certain<br />
that the power system operates for Australia competitively.<br />
No, no it is: all subsumed in the barren ideology, the barren<br />
accountancy of the ons and offs of the so called ' Fightback'<br />
package. And that's why we are different and we're better. We've<br />
always been better, and we're still better, because we are<br />
the people who have decided what the change for Australia<br />
was when Mr Howard and his then adviser, Dr Hewson, left in<br />
despair in 1983. And Dr Hewson waddled off into private<br />
life, and Mr Howard sat mute and chastened on the frontbench<br />
looking at his handy work all around him. And we<br />
said, this is the way forward, let's remove exchange<br />
controls and float the exchange rate, let's open Australia<br />
up, let's internationalise the place, let's cut the tariffs,<br />
let's get the deficit down, let's produce a surplus, let's<br />
get the tax system tidied up, make it fair, let's put our<br />
kids through school, let's get to the point where we train<br />
people, let's change the labour market, let's do all these<br />
things.<br />
Then we move onto the later phase, let's fix<br />
telecommunications, let's fix the motor industry, now the<br />
railways, ports, railways. I mean we are the people that<br />
have the big vista, the big vision. And what's his big<br />
vision? What his big vision is basically to go and tax your<br />
Weet-Bix and your Cornflakes, and the shirt on your back and<br />
your shoes, and to call this reform. And of course, in </p>
<p>7<br />
there the sleight of hand, he pretended to people that he<br />
was going to give them a big tax cut, we will give you this<br />
consumption tax, we will tax your expenditure but we will<br />
give you a big tax cut.<br />
And what we found was, that the GST was not going to give a<br />
tax cut at all. The GST simply paid for a removal of pay<br />
roll tax, cuts in petrol excise, and customs duty. In other<br />
words, here we have this tax which is going to attack the<br />
way of life of every Australian family which is going to<br />
assault the low paid and the middle incomes, which is going<br />
to totally change the way in which commerce is conducted in<br />
Australia, which is going to lift our inflation rate, and<br />
ought to remove pay-roll tax, cut the excise of petrol, and<br />
reduce customs duty because the personal income tax cuts are<br />
funded by what's called, fiscal drag, the impact of<br />
inflation on the tax system. And so he says, aren't we<br />
making big fellows of ourselves, we are going to give you a<br />
per cent tax rate at 20,700 onwards through the middle<br />
income ranges and that will give you an incentive to work,<br />
but of course you pay a 50 per cent consumption tax. And we<br />
said, hang on there is nothing remarkable about that, we can<br />
give back the fiscal drag too. We always have. We have<br />
more than given back fiscal drag from the period that the<br />
Government came to office in 1983, with those vast tax cuts<br />
through the 1980' s.<br />
So we have done the same. A 30 per cent tax rate from<br />
$ 20,700 but no consumption tax, no 15 per cent string<br />
attached, no 15 per cent sting in the tail. A 30 per cent<br />
tax rate by virtue of the fact that Labor can use its hard<br />
won fiscal inheritance from all those years of producing a<br />
structural Budget surplus and doing it with the Budget<br />
whirling back in to surplus in 1995-96. In other words,<br />
having produced $ 18 billion of surpluses, Labor can adopt<br />
the ' One Nation' package and yet despite that and the<br />
recession, and the costs of ' One Nation', seeing the Budget<br />
come back into surplus in 1995-96.<br />
So that's what we stand on. We stand on a package which is<br />
about Australians working together, which is about<br />
restarting growth and producing employment, 800,000 jobs<br />
over a 4 year period. About breaking through other log Jams<br />
in the economy in the micro area, underiding further<br />
investment in our children, giving lower middle income tax<br />
payers a tax break without a consumption tax and bringing<br />
business back into that partnership by giving Australian<br />
business one of the lowest costs of capital regimes in the<br />
world. Now that's what we are for. And if that is not a<br />
big view, if that is not the view that Australia needs to<br />
continue to take it into the trading world, particularly the<br />
Asia-Pacific, which is the fastest growing area of the<br />
world, where you have got 6 and 7 and 8 per cent growth<br />
rates where we can sell our produce into those markets, if<br />
that's not the way forward, compared to this miserable<br />
approach of taxing people the basic necessities of life and<br />
then taking the proceeds of it and tipping it into the </p>
<p>8<br />
highest tax payers in the land, that's what he is about, but<br />
that's what they have always been about.<br />
I repeat, Fightback was never a package of reform, it was an<br />
excuse for a tax and in Australian terms, it is simply a<br />
backward step. ' Fightbackwards' is the right way to view<br />
it, it is the right mind set in looking at their policies.<br />
So, I will be happy to take some questions from you, but be<br />
assured about this, that this Government has been the<br />
motivator of change in Australia, it's been the agent of<br />
change, the party which has taught the Australian people<br />
change, has now encouraged them in change and it is the one<br />
continuing still to make the changes, still with the big<br />
view, the big vista, the big builders of Australia, is still<br />
the Labor party, still this Government. And that's why we<br />
are better, we always were better, and we will always be<br />
better than this sort of Opposition which we now face.<br />
Thank you. </p>
<p>QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS<br />
PM: Now don't be shy, who wants to be first? Now you can't<br />
have read the documents that well.<br />
Q: I was just wondering if you could comment on Dr<br />
Hewson' s solution to what he sees as no progress in<br />
waterfront reform and his proposal to send in the<br />
troops.<br />
PM: By Christmas this year waterfront employment will have<br />
fallen by 50 per cent over the last two years. That<br />
is, the same task being produced half as many people, a<br />
per cent improvement in productivity. On the coast<br />
our ships now have crew levels below OECD crew manning<br />
sizes. And we have got to a point now where we have<br />
got to wait for a pooled labour on the waterfront, to<br />
waterfront employment by the stevedorian and companies.<br />
In other words, with all the changes they could have<br />
done in their years of sloth, in the Rip Van Wrinkle<br />
years of Menzies, and the years which followed, we<br />
never heard from Mr Howard or Dr Hewson when they were<br />
running the place for seven years saying, oh look we<br />
have really got to get into this waterfront it's a<br />
problem, I mean low efficiency levels on the waterfront<br />
are going to retard our national growth, going to<br />
impede our competitiveness, never heard any of that.<br />
The only response, and the first response we got from<br />
him is the one you identified, we'll put the troops in.<br />
Isn't this a classic view from somebody who does not<br />
know about this sector of the workforce, does not know<br />
about the change, does not know about society. As I<br />
said, Dr Hewson would require a military map to find<br />
his way west of the Sydney Harbour Bridge. Once you<br />
take him ou t of the comfort station of the inner<br />
Eastern Suburbs to where the people mostly live,<br />
whether it be on the waterfront or in the suburbs<br />
around it, or to the west where all the problems of<br />
housing, pollution, educational opportunities and<br />
health, and all those other things are, this is a<br />
matter of which he is not conscious. That is, out of<br />
sight and ou't of mind.<br />
So waterfront reform has been a great triumph for the<br />
Government and is now reaching its mature point of that<br />
change. And it will improve, as a result of these<br />
changes, by making the rail and port interface all<br />
around the country, more efficient. So it won't be<br />
just a matter of having an efficient waterfront, but<br />
having an efficient interface with the rail system so<br />
we can actually shift. Afterall, most of our<br />
merchandise trade now comes up in bulk commodities by<br />
containers and they're bulky, and every 1 1/ 2<br />
containers you see on a train is one truck off the main<br />
highways. It's a transport system which makes sense. </p>
<p>Basically rail carrying a greater proportion of<br />
containers between cities and then the trucks doing<br />
their distributional role in the cities. And this is<br />
the way it should be, rather than the trucks racing the<br />
trains up and down the highways.<br />
Waterfront reform will be something basically the<br />
Government has made enormous changes in, and where the<br />
sterile, I mean, he is still on about the criticism, he<br />
probably doesn't know that by Christmas waterfront<br />
employment will have fallen by half. He probably<br />
doesn't know. He still talks about it like he did<br />
three years ago, before these reforms were undertaken.<br />
So the fact is, they don't know what to do and wouldn't<br />
know where to start, and they just take the changes<br />
we've got, put it in their pockets and say oh yes we<br />
will do better. I was making that point a year or two<br />
ago, when they were talking microeconomic reform, I<br />
said it was like building the Empire State Building,<br />
and then having someone race up in the lift to put a<br />
brick on top and say, ours is bigger. And that's the<br />
Liberal Party they adopt all of our things and say we<br />
will go one centimetre further, but never having the<br />
wit or the courage to build the edifice in the first<br />
place.<br />
Q: Could you explain the reason for taking the 50 per cent<br />
ownership controls off foreign investment in the coal<br />
mining industry?<br />
PM: One of the great concerns in the ' 70s was that we<br />
wouldn't be able to reap appropriate national rewards<br />
from the ex tractive industries in the hands of<br />
foreigners without a substantial level of Australian<br />
ownership. That's now, I think changed. There's been<br />
a substantial change in the way in which some of these<br />
industries are configured, we have had great change in<br />
the ownership of the coal industry, and we now believe<br />
that the 50 per cent rule was an impediment to further<br />
investment in coal mining. In other words, we weren't<br />
able to get new mines up while ever there was this<br />
requirement that there had to be 50 per cent Australian<br />
equity when the Australian equity paths were not really<br />
available. And given the fact that we have now got a<br />
much tighter income tax system, and we have got foreign<br />
source legislation and all other sorts or capacities to<br />
audit companies and to look at transfer pricing and the<br />
rest, and given the fact that our big bulk commodities<br />
have traded' into an international trading system, and<br />
are not really in vertically-integrated companies where<br />
you can transfer price, we thought the transfer price<br />
risk was down, but the risk in terms of investment was<br />
greater to us by having that rule there, so we removed<br />
it. Which will make Australia freer for investment,<br />
more attractive for foreigners to invest, and the more<br />
equity and the less debt we get the better that debt<br />
and current account scene is. </p>
<p>0: Does this also apply to the tourist industry?<br />
PM: Foreign~ ers always could invest 100 per cent in a<br />
tourist: related investment, that is the case now. It<br />
was onl~ y ever in mining that this 50 per cent rule<br />
applied. But we have done a lot for tourism in the<br />
packagE!. As I said in the Statement, tourism was one<br />
of the great performers of the 1980s and one of the<br />
stars I~ n 1990s. It provides a tremendous amount of<br />
work and particularly for women, particularly and<br />
especiEll1y for women. So for the industry we have<br />
increased promotional budget of the Australian Tourist<br />
Commission for simply advertising Australia abroad, we<br />
have dramatically increased the depreciation rates for<br />
structures, hotels, integrated tourist developments<br />
etc, fo'r investment. And we've changed the<br />
depreciation rates for all the things that go inside,<br />
like carpets, kitchens and bedroom furniture and all<br />
the other things, it is a much faster acceleration. As<br />
is often the case, hotels are refurbished every seven<br />
or eight years, it will mean a faster write off for<br />
them, a. greater capacity, better cash flows, and a<br />
greater capacity to do it. And the tax rule supporting<br />
the development of a bigger level of tourist<br />
accommo'dation in Australia, which will be our need. As<br />
Australia becomes a more popular inbound tourist<br />
destination, we will need more capacity and<br />
accommodation then we have got now. And these rules<br />
will greatly enhance the ability of people to add to<br />
that capacity.<br />
Q: I was wondering if you could explain the reasons and<br />
timing of the tax cut.<br />
PM: The Government has always given back more than fiscal<br />
drag. Because it lowered the size of the public sector<br />
from 30 per cent GDP to 23 1/ 2, it cut the public<br />
sector back before the recession by 7 per cent of GDP<br />
which is 30,000 million a year smaller. It meant we<br />
didn't need a revenue share as large as we had, So<br />
therefore we were able to finance the Australian public<br />
sector with a smaller tax base. Therefore we were able<br />
to give real income tax cuts in the ' 80s. So not only<br />
do we give back the effects of inflation on a tax<br />
system, but as well as that we're able to actually give<br />
back some of the real level of taxation which was<br />
formally holding a bigger public sector together,<br />
financing a bigger public sector. Now, what we are<br />
proposing here is because there is a cyclical effect<br />
from the recession which has turned the Budget from a<br />
surplus to a deficit, and because we now wish to add to<br />
that deficit, to provide a stimulus to growth, recovery<br />
and employment, we don't want to be making the deficit<br />
larger by tax cuts now. But as a cycle turns and the<br />
Budget comes back towards surplus, where those tax cuts<br />
* become affordable, we're going to pay them at the<br />
earliest opportunity in 1994-' 95 and ' 95-' 96, and they<br />
will be paid from $ 20,700 upwards. So I make two </p>
<p>points to you, that in the 1980s the area of employment<br />
that we concentrated those tax cuts in most was below<br />
$ 20,000, to the low paid. Where I lifted the tax free<br />
threshold from $ 4,900 to $ 5,400 and cut the first rate,<br />
the rate from $ 5,400 to $ 20,000, from 30 per cent to<br />
per cent, providing enormous tax cuts to those people<br />
down the bottom, and of course we introduced the family<br />
allowance supplement, which we added to substantially<br />
in this Statement with another $ 250 million. And it<br />
will remain again that low paid families will get<br />
targeted and valuable support from the family allowance<br />
supplement and from these changes. So the tax cuts are<br />
being paid when the Government can afford it, when the<br />
Budget can afford it, and even paying them, the Budget<br />
will stiLll come back to surplus. I might just take one<br />
more, then I have got to go back to a Caucus meeting.<br />
Q: How soon will the job creation aspects of ' One Nation'<br />
lock in'?<br />
PM: They will start quickly I think, particularly the road<br />
programs which can be built up quickly, the rail<br />
programs will take sometime to start. But one of the<br />
things we wanted to do was to inject some funds into<br />
the economy to get spending going in the retail areas<br />
and through, business generally, and that's why we've<br />
made the one-off payment to families of between $ 125<br />
and $ 250) so that families would spend it, and that<br />
would generate activity and start to get business<br />
going. So there is that happening in April. And as<br />
that happens we will have the build-up from the<br />
infrastructure program. And no doubt the depreciation<br />
changes will bring forward investment and cause<br />
investment to occur which otherwise wouldn't occur with<br />
slower rates of depreciation. And of course we have<br />
got the stimulatory effects of the low interest rates<br />
which I reduced first in January 1992, over two years<br />
ago, as they become an 11 per centage point reduction<br />
interest rates, starting to really have their impact<br />
inside the economy. So those things, that is the<br />
general stimulus coming from lower interest rates, the<br />
stimulus coming from the change from the Budget from a<br />
surplus to a deficit, the one-off payment to families<br />
and the build-up of the infrastructure program and<br />
depreciation from investment, should start to get the<br />
economy cradking again, and we will start to see those<br />
growth numbers come through 4 3/ 4 per cent through<br />
the year in 1992-3 which will get Australia back to<br />
growth. Employment and growth are so tied together.<br />
If you look back right to the 1960s every time you see<br />
a lift in GDP you see a lift in employment. Where it<br />
trails of f you see one following the other. If we get<br />
activity up and GDP moving we will get it employment<br />
moving and I believe we will. </p>
