PARLIAMENTARY STATEMENT BY THE<br />
PRIME MINISTER, HR BOB HAWKE,<br />
" BUILDING A COMPETITIVE AUSTRALIA"<br />
12 MARCH 1991.<br />
Mr Speaker<br />
Early this year I determined that I should deliver a major<br />
statement about what we must do together to meet the<br />
economic challenges facing this country.<br />
Today I want; to speak with my f ellow Australians, not in the<br />
jargon of economists, but in terms we can all understand. I<br />
do this because, while I will be announcing decisions of<br />
fundamental economic importance for the future of this<br />
country, the securing of that future is in the hands of each<br />
one of us.<br />
Government has the responsibility to lead the community by<br />
getting the right policy framework we will do that. But<br />
it is only -with the understanding, the commitment, of all<br />
Australians as individuals, and through their<br />
representative organisations that our nation will best<br />
meet the challenges ahead.<br />
What are those challenges?<br />
The f irst is for us all to realise that this tough,<br />
increasingly competitive world of f ive and a half billion<br />
people does not owe, and will not give, seventeen million<br />
Australians~ an easy prosperity. The days of our being able<br />
to hitch a free. ride in a world clamouring, and prepared to<br />
pay high prices, f or our rural and mineral products, are<br />
behind us.<br />
From this fact flows everything else.<br />
The Ctall for the foreseeable future, is to produce more<br />
than we spend. The rest of the world will not allow us to<br />
continue indefinitely to live beyond our means by borrowing<br />
from them.<br />
Our rural and mineral products will remain important into<br />
the future. But the nhJ. JRnnDA is to add to them. That is,<br />
we must excport more manufactured goods and services and<br />
substitute more quality Australian production for imports.<br />
The nhllanff is therefore to make the decisions and adopt<br />
the practices and attitudes which will enable this and<br />
succeeding generations to achieve those basic goals.<br />
Those are the challenges. How we are prepared together to<br />
meet them will determine the standards we can enjoy and the<br />
kind of Australia we will pass on to our children. </p>
<p>I will today announce a package of substantial new measures<br />
directed to the fundamental task facing this nation:<br />
improving the productive capacity of an economy that will be<br />
more internaitionally competitive.<br />
Highlights of the package are: tariff cuts, reduced<br />
wholesale sailes taxes for business, substantial business<br />
savings through simpler depreciation, retraining assistance,<br />
new support for apprentices and further initiatives in<br />
education and research to build the ' clever country'.<br />
The Treasurer and the Minister for Industry, Technology and<br />
Commerce will today be making more detailed statements<br />
covering the announcements in their portfolio areas.<br />
All these measures continue and intensify the far-reaching<br />
reforms my Government has initiated over the past eight<br />
years. Ultimately, they sharpen our ability to reduce the<br />
current account deficit and stabilise foreign debt.<br />
I emphasiset that they share one overriding objective:<br />
building a competitive Australia.<br />
In this statement I will reaffirm for the Australian people<br />
the longer.-term economic goals to which we aspire, and<br />
identify the progress we are making towards them.<br />
And I want all my fellow Australians to understand where the<br />
nation is -moving and to understand how all of us workers,<br />
employers and Government have complementary roles to play<br />
in achieving our common goals. I say it again: in the<br />
final analysis the challenges ahead demand the involvement<br />
of all Australians.<br />
Mr Speaker<br />
The Australian economy is currently at or near the bottom of<br />
a downturn that has been sharper, deeper and more prolonged<br />
then we anticipated.<br />
I acknowledge the recession has hurt many people and cost<br />
many jobs, and that is something I regret deeply.<br />
Higher unemployment is likely in coming months. Rural<br />
Australia in particular is experiencing a very tough period.<br />
There are some important global factors at work. But I<br />
don't walk away from my Government's ultimate responsibility<br />
to manage, the national economy.<br />
And we certainly do not resile from having taken the<br />
necessary decision to squeeze demand by high interest rates.<br />
Policy makers and commentators, in Australia and around the<br />
world, underestimated the strength of resurgent demand in<br />
the wake of the 1.987 sharemarket crash. </p>
<p>But with the benefit of hindsight, it is clear that had we<br />
acted sooner to dampen that surge, some of the current<br />
hardship could have been avoided.<br />
The question facing us now is not: wil we emerge from the<br />
recession? For the decisions necessary to end the recession have<br />
already been taken: official interest rates have been<br />
brought down by 6 percentage points over the last fourteen<br />
months; and tax cuts paid on 1 January will also stimulate<br />
demand. Business will begin to rebuild stocks, and international<br />
confidence will be helped by the successful end of the Gulf<br />
war. There are testing months immediately ahead. But the best<br />
estimate is that we will be coming out of the recession in<br />
the second half of this year.<br />
So the real question, and the real challenge, facing us is:<br />
how can we ensure that when we emerge from the recession, we<br />
will be best: equipped to take up the opportunities for<br />
sustained growth?<br />
In particular we have the opportunity to secure econoinic<br />
recovery: with low inflation<br />
a nd hence lower interest rates<br />
in an increasingly competitive and productive<br />
eiconomy.<br />
And this Government is determined to seize that opportunity.<br />
That is what this Statement is really about today. It is<br />
not about short term palliatives, but longer term structural<br />
change to imake us a more competitive nation.<br />
That was whiat my Government set out, eight years ago, to<br />
achieve through fundamental reform of long established<br />
economic institutions and of deeply entrenched attitudes.<br />
We still have a long way to go but today we can certainly<br />
say that, together, we have made substantial progress: we<br />
are more copen to the world and we are more ef ficient at<br />
home. We are becoming more competitive.<br />
1. TM9J! f-nA A= Qtre-14n'q I-rejeinc future<br />
Mr Speaker, the most powerful spur to greater<br />
competitiveness is further tariff reduction. </p>
<p>Tariffs have been one of the abiding features of the<br />
Australian economy since Federation. Tariffs protected<br />
Australian industry by making foreign goods more expensive<br />
here; and the supposed virtues of this protection became<br />
deeply embedded in the psyche of the nation.<br />
But what in fact was the resul. t?<br />
inefficient industries that could not comp ete overseas;<br />
and higher prices for consumers and higher costs for our<br />
efficiant primary producers.<br />
worse still, tariffs are a regressive burden that is, the<br />
poorest Australians are hurt more than the richest. The<br />
Industry Commission estimates that the burden tariffs impose<br />
on lowest income Australians is three times heavier than<br />
that imposed on those with the highest incomes.<br />
Right from th * e start, this Government deliberately and<br />
determinedly set about pulling down the tariff walls. By<br />
1992 our existing programs will have slashed the nominal<br />
rate of assistance to the manufacturing sector by over<br />
one-third, from 13 to 8 per cent, and the effective rate<br />
from 22 to 12 per cent.<br />
The results, the benefits, have been dramatic.<br />
Since 1985, manufacturing output, employment and exports<br />
have all expanded at rates faster than the OECD average.<br />
For the Australian consumer and business, prices for many<br />
goods are lower than they would otherwise have been.<br />
Tariff cut~ s presented Australian manufacturers with a major<br />
challenge. To their credit, many of them are meeting that<br />
challenge. Their endeavours are too rarely appreciated and<br />
their success too often underestimated.<br />
Mr Speaker, this Government will continue to open up the<br />
manufacturing sector and Australian industry generally<br />
through lower protection. I now announce:<br />
the general level of assistance will be reduced from<br />
and 15%. in 1992 to a general rate of by 1996;<br />
tariffs on passenger motor vehicles will be phased down<br />
from 35% in 1992 in annual steps of 2.5 per cent to<br />
in 2000;<br />
This change can be expected to result in an average real<br />
reduction of $ 2,000 to $ 3,000 in the price of a $ 20,000 car,<br />
in today's dollars, over the next decade. </p>
<p>1. also announce:<br />
tariff reductions on textile, clothing and footwear<br />
will be accelerated so that the maximum tariff will be<br />
by the year 2000 and the termination of quotas will<br />
be brought forward two years to 1 March 1993; and<br />
general agricultural assistance will be reduced in line<br />
with the pace of tariff reform in manufacturing.<br />
The dimension of what we have achieved is demonstrated by<br />
the fact that these changes will bring the average nominal<br />
rate of assiñ stance down to 3 per cent, and the average<br />
effective rate down to 5 per cent, by the end of the decadea.<br />
All these changes will help keep inflation, and therefore<br />
interest rates, down.<br />
They will also make our exporters and our import competing<br />
sector more competitive by lowering the cost of their<br />
inputs. The overall impact of the reforms will be a net gain in<br />
employment, although-jobs will be lost in declining<br />
industriesl.<br />
Throughout: my public life it has been my firm conviction<br />
that if the community believes that change is necessary in<br />
the interests of the community as a whole, then that belief<br />
carries with it a necessary corollary that the community<br />
must not leave those individuals or groups who are adversely<br />
affected to bear the whole burden of change. It must itself<br />
be prepared to share that burden of change, as well as<br />
reaping the benefits of change.<br />
Accordingly, we will establish labour adjustment programs to<br />
assist displaced workers in our car and textiles, clothing<br />
and footwear industries with relocation, training, and wages<br />
subsidies for redeployment to other jobs. This will cost at<br />
least $ 90 million over the life of the programs.<br />
Mr Speaker, with these tariff cuts, we demonstrate once<br />
again our commitment to liberalising international trade.<br />
The Gove: xnment has been fortified in this approach by a<br />
number ofC recent reports, not least Dr. Ross Garnaut's<br />
report &amp; 1At~ ra1ñ a mnd thp Npnrtha~ s ARIAn Agqcenny.<br />
We have rejected the views of the so-called " now<br />
protectionists" because they are simply proposing, in<br />
effect, the same discredited policies that had isolated our<br />
national economy from the rest of the world and caused the<br />
great damage we are all working to repair.<br />
However much our competitors might bend or break the<br />
principl. es of fair trade, our own self-interest is served by<br />
a steadfast refusal to return to the days of protectionism. </p>
<p>But I don'It for a minute seek to excuse those nations who do<br />
flout the rules of international trade, especially those who<br />
have caused so much damage to our farm trade.<br />
The problem lies in the inadequacy of the rules on<br />
agriculture under the General Agreement on Tariffs and<br />
Trade. GAT]' has been an outstanding success in<br />
substantially reducing manufacturing protection around the<br />
world. As a result, world trade in manufactures has boomed.<br />
BUt at the same time, agricultural trade has been absolutely<br />
corrupted particularly by the European Community and to a<br />
lesser extent by the United States and Japan.<br />
Recently, their combined farm subsidies have averaged more<br />
than $ 300 billion a year! And this for a sector which<br />
produces only about 3 per cent of their GDP.<br />
This has imposed a heavy burden on our farmers: despite<br />
consistent large productivity gains, they exported the same<br />
volume of groods in 1989-90 as they did ten years earlier.<br />
While world trade thrived, agriculture, one of our most<br />
competitive and significant sectors, has marked time.<br />
So what furcther steps can we take to improve our trading<br />
position? First, we will maintain our vigorous international campaigrn<br />
to achieve equal treatment for agriculture under the GATT<br />
umbrella. The Europeans already accept, due in no small way<br />
to the efforts of the Cairns Group, led by Australia, that<br />
there can be no result in the Uruguay Round negotiations<br />
without substantial reform of agricultural trade. We will<br />
keep pushing them hard.<br />
Members of' both sides of this Parliament have recently<br />
visited Washington, and will travel to Europe in coming<br />
months, to urge both sides to avoid the chaos and insanity<br />
of a trade war.<br />
This international campaign by Australia depends for its<br />
credibility and impact on one thing: on our general<br />
willingness to practice at home what we preach abroad.<br />
Second, the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy will<br />
announce a rural adjustment package in April to ensure that<br />
those farmers most in need during the current rural crisis<br />
receive appropriate assistance.<br />
Third, we: will help our farmers and manufacturers take<br />
effective action against foreign producers who seek to dump<br />
their products on the Australian market at unfair prices.<br />
We will strengthen anti-dumping procedures, including by<br />
cutting 40 days off the time taken to process complaints. </p>
<p>Fourth, the preferential tariff arrangements for Singapore,<br />
Taiwan, Hong ' Kong and the Republic of Korea will be phased<br />
out from I July 1992.<br />
Fifth, we will provide $ 2 million to continue the Australian<br />
Made Campaign, since reducing our reliance on imports is<br />
totally complementary, in economic terms, to expanding our<br />
performance in exports.<br />
Sixth, we will upgrade the services available to Australian<br />
exporters. In particular:<br />
We will boost the capital base and range of services<br />
provided by the Export Finance Insurance Corporation by<br />
making available a $ 200 million callable capital base<br />
to supplement EFIC's existing reserves.<br />
A new $ 50 million facility will be made available by<br />
EFIC, to enable Australian exporters to meet demands<br />
for performance bonds without using their own reserves.<br />
we will create a new program of fellowships so that<br />
Australian business men and women, and recent<br />
graduates, can get direct working experience in the<br />
Asia-Pdxcif ic region.<br />
We will implement the McKinsey report recommendations<br />
including refocusing Austrade's efforts on the<br />
Asia-Pacific region.<br />
we will transfer responsibility f or AUSTRADE to the<br />
Minister for Trade and Overseas Development from<br />
I September.<br />
2. GrZmt-Pffinigmrny andi Camptitn withlin A I rralia<br />
Mr Speaker, with further tariff cuts, we are dismantling the<br />
barriers to competitiveness and efficiency that stand at the<br />
borders of Australia.<br />
This Government is also set on dismantling the barriers that<br />
exist witñ hin Australia.<br />
We have pioneered the concept, and the delivery, of<br />
microeconcomic reform seen by industry, rightly, as an<br />
essential means towards higher productivity and efficiency.<br />
We are freeing up our transport systems; we have<br />
revolutionised our taxation system; we are creating more<br />
efficient workplaces; we are injecting competition where for<br />
too long Australian firms and public sector enterprises have<br />
been content with the quiet life.<br />
And we aria reforming the processes of Governmnent itself<br />
through the Special Premiers Conferences.<br />
in all this, perhaps no issue has achieved the prominence of<br />
the waterfront essential to our export performance. </p>
<p>It Is particularly satisfying to be able to report to the<br />
House on the achievement, just last week, of a new agreement<br />
that will deliver breakthroughs in waterfront productivity.<br />
The agreement between the Waterside Workers' Federation and<br />
Conaust Ltd,, following an earlier agreement with National<br />
Terminals ( Australia) Ltd, now means waterfront employees<br />
and the two largest waterfront employers are committed to a<br />
total restructuring of their industry.<br />
In describiLng the significance of this latest agreement,<br />
Mr Speaker,, I can do no better than to quote the words of<br />
Mr Richard Setchell, the Chairman of Conaust, who said it<br />
was " a win f or the economy and the international<br />
competitiveness of Australia".<br />
By year's end, the national waterfront labour force will<br />
have been cut by over 1500 in anyone's language, a major<br />
gain in efficiency.<br />
in all, th~ e agreements provide for productivity gains Of Up<br />
to 60 per cent; in smaller ports and in grain handling,<br />
per cent.<br />
What appeared an ambitious program when we commenced these<br />
reforms, is now proceeding on schedule, and without major<br />
industrial disputes.<br />
In shipping, we are ahead of schedule in delivering smaller,<br />
more efficient crews on existing vessels and the<br />
introduction of new ships crewed at manning levels equal to<br />
or better than those of our major trading partners.<br />
In telecommunications, in aviation, in road and rail<br />
transport, in removing through national uniform regulations<br />
the requirement for business to meet six or seven different<br />
standards, we are achieving fundamental gains in efficiency.<br />
Mr Speaker, this activity amounts to the most ambitious<br />
plan, the most rapid pace, and the most comprehensive sweep<br />
of micro-. economic reform this country has ever seen.<br />
Productivity is increasing, and new investment is taking<br />
place till without industrial disruption.<br />
And here we are witness to a paradox. Those who for more<br />
than a generation in office entrenched the inadequacies of<br />
the past and themselves effected no change whatsoever, now<br />
with an hypocrisy that is truly breathtaking, clamour for<br />
even faster change.<br />
They bear an anus, which they simply cannot discharge, of<br />
showing how in a practical way this could be achieved<br />
without poisoning the better industrial relations and<br />
investment environment we have created without, in short,<br />
bringing the whole reform process to a grinding halt.<br />
It is a matter of our results versus their rhetoric. </p>
<p>i i, i r -i-i i iqi z i L r, u t-r iL-r -9.<br />
We will press ahead with further reform, to increase<br />
competition and efficiency within Australia.<br />
For the consumer, competition means lower prices and a<br />
broader range of better quality goods and services; for<br />
producers it; provides the spur to better performance at<br />
home and abroad.<br />
We want to s~ es the whole domestic economy opened up to this<br />
kind of positive structural change.<br />
lAnd we have established a sub-committee of Cabinet's<br />
Structural Adjustment Committee to examine systematically<br />
the whole economy for opportunities to promote this process.<br />
The Trade Practices Act is our principal legislative weapon<br />
to. ensure consumers get the best deal from competition.<br />
But there are many areas of the Australian economy today<br />
that are immune from that Act: some Commonwealth<br />
enterprises, State public sector businesses, and significant<br />
areas of the private sector, including the professions.<br />
This patchwork coverage reflects historical and<br />
constitutional factors, not economic efficiencies; it is<br />
another important instance of the way we operate as six<br />
economies, rather than one.<br />
The benefit"-s for the consumer of expanding the scope of the<br />
Trade Practices Act could be immense: potentially lower<br />
professional fees, cheaper road and rail fares, cheaper<br />
electricity. This has tro be done and I have initiated the process, by<br />
today writing to the Premiers urging a positive examination<br />
of all we can do, at the May Special Premiers Conference, to<br />
widen the ambit of the Trade Practices PAct to bring such<br />
excluded areas within the scope of a national framework of<br />
competition policy and law.<br />
3. Tna ltnt for thA 199_ Oa<br />
Mr Speaker, to secure sustainable economic growth and the<br />
living standards to which we aspire, we need to ensure that<br />
there is Et fertile environment for investment.<br />
Our efforts to repair the macroeconomic fundamentals<br />
underpinned rapid investment growth in the late 1980sa<br />
through the Accord, through floating the dollar, and through<br />
cutting Government spending.<br />
There is, however, one other fundamental which is crucial to<br />
investment: inflation.<br />
It is vital that Australians understand the debilitating<br />
nature of the inflation disease.<br />
I C-L No C. L flu. t'j. Q~ r~,-uu~ j I </p>
<p>High inflation has brought high interest rates and a higher<br />
cost of capital than in our trading partners. This, in<br />
turn, undermined investment and made it harder for<br />
Australian firms to compete overseas.<br />
It has also discouraged productive investment in areas that<br />
would generate jobs arnd exports in favour of speculation in<br />
real estate.<br />
But today we have the opportunity, as I have said, of<br />
putting Australia on a low inflation path.<br />
Australia's inflation is now below the OECD average: ours is<br />
6.9 per cent and just 5.4 per cent in underlying terms and<br />
theirs is 7.2 per cent.<br />
A continued lowering of inflation is, without doubt, the<br />
major contribution this Government can make to the climate<br />
f or investment in the 1.990s.<br />
of course new investment, combined with lower tariffs, has<br />
meant, and will mean for a time, higher imports and a higher<br />
current account deficit.<br />
This becomes even more obvious at times when commodity<br />
prices are falling, as they are now due to the slowdown in<br />
world economic growth.<br />
But this is a short-term cost we must bear if we are to wind<br />
back the current account deficit in a sustainable way and<br />
thereby reduce our foreign indebtedness permanently. We are<br />
taking the essential steps to build an economy that is<br />
stronger in the long term.<br />
' And there are other important areas where we can take action<br />
to foster productive investment.<br />
The Government is very concerned at the difficulty which<br />
small and medium-sized Australian companies face in raising<br />
long term funds.<br />
We are pursuing discussions with major financial<br />
institutions aimed at overcoming this difficulty by ensuring<br />
a readier flow of such funds.<br />
The development of new industry and the rejuvenation of the<br />
old depends on ready access to appropriately skilled labour<br />
access which is increasingly difficult in our sprawling<br />
cities, with their often inefficient transport systems.<br />
These factors also reduce the quality of life for the<br />
residents affected. We are cooperating with State and local<br />
government: to develop effective approaches to these issues.<br />
Mr Speaker, this Government has done more than any other to<br />
reform the taxation system so that, as far as possible, tax<br />
considerations do not distort investment decisions.<br />
Today I announce: </p>
<p>11<br />
a substantial widening of exemptions from sales tax f or<br />
business inputs used by manufacturers, primary<br />
producers and miners. The cost to revenue of this<br />
measure will amount in 1992-93 to $ 375 million. But<br />
the cost benefits to producers, allowing for the<br />
effects of mark-ups as goods pass along the production<br />
chain, will in that year total around $ 700 million.<br />
we have radically overhauled depreciation provisions to<br />
bring -them more in line with business realities. The<br />
reforms provide, for the first time, a definition in<br />
the Act of effective life. And it will allow<br />
self-assessment by the taxpayer. This will result in<br />
savings to business of the order of $ 100 million in<br />
1992-93.<br />
expenditure on environmental impact statements will be<br />
fully tax deductible over ten years.<br />
An industry which will benefit from these new tax provisions<br />
is tourism, which has generated over 100,000 new jobs during<br />
the 1980s and has the potential for substantial further<br />
expansion. One sector of the Australian economy is unique in terms of<br />
the investment environment in which it operates the forest<br />
industries. This Government's consistent commitment is to the proper<br />
protection~ of our precious native forests. This has been,<br />
and remains, fundamental to our approach to Government.<br />
But we recognise that in part due to this commitment<br />
there has been a contraction of the forest resource<br />
allocated to existing operations in the industry. Concern<br />
about future access to the resource has made new investment<br />
uncertain. Accordingly, the Government has decided to provide resource<br />
security for major new wood processing projects<br />
-where the project involves a capital-intensive<br />
value-adding investment of $ 100 million or more and is<br />
directed to export or to import replacement;<br />
where the proponent of the project makes a commitment<br />
to adhere to environment, heritage and Aboriginal<br />
policy requirements; and<br />
where the State Government agrees to enact parallel<br />
resource security legislation. </p>
<p>I I -DI C. 7 Qz Ur r 11-r I LL NU. Z ' iu L<br />
12.<br />
Resource secur~ ity will involve undertakings, backed by<br />
legislation, guaranteeing an agreed volume of timber supply<br />
from an identified catchment area. There will also be<br />
provision in the legislation to establish plantations to<br />
provide for long-term timber supply. The objective is to<br />
phase out woodchip exports by the year 2000 or soon after,<br />
and replace them with value-added products. This new<br />
emphasis on plantations will also, over time, take pressure<br />
off our native forests.<br />
Mr Speaker, the Government decided on resource security<br />
legislation only after receiving unqualified legal advice<br />
that it was the sole way the Commonwealth could provide a<br />
binding undertaking of the kind necessary to get major<br />
projects started which will provide new exports and new<br />
jobs. Government has a duty to listen to and understand all<br />
legitimate community interests. It has a responsibility<br />
then to seek as far as possible to balance those interests<br />
where they compete. It should, where appropriate, establish<br />
processes aimed to achieve that purpose. In the end,<br />
Government must do what it was elected to do and make the<br />
necessary decisions. This will mean facing up to tough<br />
issues and i~ t will rarely entail universal approbation.<br />
So it is in this case where, I believe, my Government has<br />
struck the correct balance between environmental concerns<br />
to which our commitment remains vital and unambiguous and<br />
the interests of one of Australia's largest industries.<br />
4. n~ nmn a Moer Country<br />
Mr Speaker, I said at the outset that securing the future of<br />
the country is in the hands of each one of us. To achieve<br />
change, we must mobilise our most valuable resource: the<br />
talents of the Australian people.<br />
This does not necessarily mean working harder; in Germany<br />
and Japan, both highly successful competitive countries,<br />
working hours are actually falling.<br />
But it does mean working smarter working more effectively,<br />
using new materials, new production technologies and new<br />
management methods. It means being, like Germany and Japan,<br />
a clever country.<br />
During the last election campaign I said Australia needed to<br />
become a clever country. The centrepiece of my commitment<br />
to that goal was the creation of a network of Cooperative<br />
Research Cantres. I said that these Centres would draw<br />
together outstanding research groups to provide new drive to<br />
our national research effort.<br />
Today I announce that the Government has selected the first<br />
fifteen Cooperative Research Centres. These Centres will<br />
focus their research effort on projects in the following key<br />
areas: </p>
<p>resource based industries;<br />
manufacturing and information industries;<br />
the environment; and<br />
ime diLcal research.<br />
My colleague -the Minister for Science and Technology will<br />
provide details of successful projects this week.<br />
The Government has also decided to continue i. ndefinitely the<br />
tax deduction for spending on research and development at<br />
125 per caent.<br />
Cooperation writh our talented neighbours in the region is<br />
important if we are to remain at the frontiers of<br />
technology. The Multifunction Polis provides an opportunity<br />
to do this. Next month the Government will receive the<br />
report of the MFP-Adelaide Management Group which was set up<br />
to assess thea economic and social viability of the MFP.<br />
Cleverness is not confined to our universities and ' hi-tech'<br />
firms. Cleverness is something that should permeate the<br />
entire society and especially our workplaces. And the<br />
foundation of a clever country is its education system.<br />
I have repeatedly stated my pride in our achievements in<br />
virtually doubling the school retention rate, and expanding<br />
the number of tertiary places.<br />
Quite simply-, unless we give our young people the motivation<br />
and the opportunity to bring out the best in themselves<br />
through education, we shall never be able to bring out the<br />
best in ouEevsas ek nation.<br />
Today I announce<br />
an increase in the number and average value of<br />
Austra: lian Postgraduate Research Awards;<br />
extra funding of $ 15 million over three years f or the<br />
Countr y Areas Program to focus on greater rural school<br />
retention; and<br />
SI81 million over three years in a community project to<br />
identify the key elements of good schooling.<br />
Ours is a dynamic region, in a world of ceaseless<br />
technological innovation and burgeoning knowledge-based<br />
industries. In a clever country, all of us, as workers and<br />
managers, need to upgrade our job skills regularly.<br />
A recession can savagely damage the job skills of a nation.<br />
Apprentices have been hit particularly hard in the past<br />
young Austr: alians seeking to acquire and improve their job<br />
skills have been laid off with their training incomplete. </p>
<p>.14.<br />
Accordingly, I announce a new program of assistance so that<br />
employers can retain and Improve the skills of apprentices<br />
and other workers who would otherwise be working reduced<br />
hours or have been retrenched.<br />
We will also spend $ 74 million over two years to provide<br />
work experience opportunities for people unemployed for more<br />
than six months.<br />
And we will commit $ 50 million over the next fifteen months<br />
to provide additional pre-vocational training places, and we<br />
will seek State cooperation in this.<br />
We will provide $ 6 million over three years to strengthen<br />
management skills.<br />
Education it; clearly a vital preparation for the workforce<br />
in a clever country, but It is in the workplace itself that<br />
the skills must be developed if they are to yield the<br />
productivity dividend we so desperately need in our<br />
enterprises. Our trade union movement has made an enormous contribution<br />
to the creation of a more efficient Australia.<br />
Union amalgamations involving workers in metals, the publIc<br />
service, health, textiles, timber products and<br />
telecommunications have already been concluded. There are<br />
some fifty other amalgamations currently underway. The<br />
Government will commit a further $ 1.45 million to assist<br />
this process in 1991-92.<br />
I also pay tribute to those employers who, in partnership<br />
with the tzcade unions, have secured major gains through<br />
award restructuring and workplace reform.<br />
My Government has provided financial assistance to this<br />
process and we will virtually double our financial support<br />
over the next few years.<br />
The Business Council of Australia has proposed a major<br />
research project on international performance benchmarks of<br />
business Input services.<br />
We have directed the Bureau of Industry Economics, with the<br />
cooperation of the BCA, to undertake this project at a cost<br />
of $ 1.8 miLllion over four years.<br />
The Pappas Carter Report commissioned by the Australian<br />
Manufacturing Council, and recent publications by EPAC, have<br />
placed particular emphasis on the importance of changing the<br />
workplace culture. In cooperation with the AMC, we will<br />
develop a program to raise the efficiency of Australian<br />
enterprises to world standards. we will draw on the<br />
experience of our own world class companies together with<br />
the best practice that can be found anywhere in the world in<br />
thin endeiavour. </p>
<p>In am particularly pleased to announce that John Prescott,<br />
managing director of BliP and chairman of the AMC, has agreed<br />
to chair the board that will oversee the new program.<br />
We have earmarked $ 25 million over two years for the<br />
program. Mr Speaker, the measures I have announced today are<br />
absolutely vital for the continued transformation of the<br />
Australian economy. At the same time, they compromise<br />
neither our demonstrated commitment to fiscal restraint nor<br />
our medium -term objective to maintain the structural<br />
integrity of the Budget. Their total costs in outlays and<br />
foregone revenue are $ 33 million in 1990-91, $ 446 million in<br />
1991-92 and $ 854 million in 1992-93.<br />
Mr Speaker, this Government has never been in doubt about<br />
the kind at' Australia we wish to build a modern, growing,<br />
prosperous and competitive economy, within a tolerant and<br />
fair society; a nation where quality of life counts for as<br />
much as quaintity of output; an outward-looking community,<br />
enmeshed w: Lth the dynamism of the Asia Pacific region, and<br />
capable of taking on the best the world has to offer and<br />
winning. These are not short-term goals; they are not transitory<br />
values. They are deeply embedded in the character of this Government<br />
and of the Party I have the honour of leading.<br />
This process of modernisation, of adaptation to the changing<br />
world ecortomy, is not something that has some future cut-off<br />
point. 11t must be a continuing process.<br />
There is no point at which we can say, reform is finishedbecause<br />
there is no point at which the world will stop<br />
changing.<br />
And this is the essential point, Mr Speaker. We live in a<br />
world of -unprecedented, indeed breathtaking, change. Our<br />
own region is a crucible for change.<br />
We can no longer afford the'easy simplicities, the costly<br />
complacencies of the fifties and sixties and seventies.<br />
I say " costly" because we are now paying the price for the<br />
neglect of those decades.<br />
Our task now is to make sure that future generations are not<br />
called upon to pay a similar price for any neglect or<br />
complacency on our part, in this make-or-break decade.<br />
We need the hmb.ñ z of adaptation because the lesson of<br />
international competitiveness must be constantly learned and<br />
re-learned. </p>
<p>16.<br />
if we get the basics right in these critical years we need<br />
not set limit; on our prospects.<br />
I do not avoid the f act that I hold these prospects out to<br />
you at 8 time of recession. But we should understand that<br />
Australia comes to this task with two great advantages<br />
enduring advantages that transcend the temporary, but real,<br />
difficulties of the recession.<br />
First, we bring to the task our great natural and acquired<br />
endowments as a nation our vast material resources, our<br />
vibrant multicultural community, our strengths as a free and<br />
prosperous people, our proximity to the f astest growing<br />
regional economy in the world.<br />
Second, in meeting these tremendous challenges that lie<br />
ahead, we are, not, in 1991, starting out f rom scratch. We<br />
are not, in this decade, coming to the task cold.<br />
We have already taken many of the essential decisions, we<br />
have already learned many of the vital lessons, we are<br />
already enmeshing ourselves with our region, we have already<br />
mastered many of the skills that we will need, to enter the<br />
next century with well-founded confidence that we will reach<br />
our goals.<br />
But we must face the fact unflinchingly that we need as a<br />
nation to equip ourselves, further, to meet the challenges<br />
of exposure to international competition.<br />
That has been central to the endeavour of this Government.<br />
It Is central1 to the themel of this statement. It is the<br />
central purpose of the measures I have announced today. It<br />
must remain the central challenge of this great nation for<br />
decades to come.<br />
I restate my belief with which I began: the involvement,<br />
the commitment of all Australians is the vital ingredient to<br />
success in -the challenge ahead. it is a challenge that,<br />
together, we can face and meet with confidence. </p>
