    <content><![CDATA[<p>~ J3, AUSTRALIA.<br />PRIME MINISTER<br />NOTE FOR MEDIA 6 November 1986<br />The following can be attributed to a spokesman for the Prime<br />minister: Attached are transcripts of two interviews the Prime minister<br />gave in Melbourne this morning, mainly on the subject of<br />logging in Tasmania. Also attached is a copy of a letter the<br />Prime Minister has sent today, Thursday, 6 November, to the<br />Premier of Tasmania on the subject of the logging activities<br />which commenced in the Jackey's Marsh area yesterday,<br />Wednesday, 5 November. The letter follows the two<br />communications which the Prime minister sent the Premier<br />yesterday.<br />As will be seen, today's message is in response to the<br />Premier's statement that the logging activities are in<br />accordance with the Memorandum of Understanding which seeks to<br />control exploitation of forest areas in Tasmania.<br />while the Memorandum of Understanding does canvass<br />exploitation of Jackey's Marsh in accordance with<br />environmental impact studies -the clause upon which the<br />Premier appears to be relying -it also provides for a series<br />of consultative measures in the case of areas listed as part<br />of the National Estate, and in the event of disagreement<br />between the two governments over the future of those areas.<br />In the Jackey's Marsh case, those consultative measures,<br />outlined in Clauses 23, 24 and 27 of the Memorandum of<br />Understanding, must be brought into play. In the event of a<br />failure of those measures, Clause 30 then provides for matters<br />which cannot be reconciled at officer level to be then<br />reconciled at ministerial level.<br />The Government has asked for legal advice from the Attorney<br />General on its powers and possible courses of action with<br />regard to protecting the National Estate values of the<br />Jackey's Marsh area.</p>
<p>TEXT OF LETTER SENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER TO THE PREMIER OF<br />TASMANIA TODAY, 6 NOVEMBER 1986.<br />Following my letter of 5 November 1986 on forestry<br />operations at Warner's Sugar Loaf in the Jackey's Marsh<br />Quamby Bluff area, I have noted public comments by you that<br />logging is proceeding in the area in accordance with the<br />provisions of the Memorandum of Understanding on Tasmanian<br />Woodchip Exports.<br />I draw your attention once again to Clauses 23, 24 and 27 of<br />the Memorandum of Understanding which outline the<br />consultation process " for places listed on the register of<br />the National Estate". You will be aware that on 21 October<br />1986 the Australian Heritage Commission publicly advised its<br />decision to list Jackey's Marsh Quamby Bluff on the<br />register of the National Estate. National Estate values<br />identified by the Australian Heritage Commission in the<br />Jackey's Marsh Quamby Bluff area include rare/ threatened<br />plant species, outstanding aesthetic value, archaeological<br />sites and rainforest.<br />In authorising forestry operations in the Jockey's Marsh<br />Quamby Bluff area, the Tasmanian Government has not followed<br />the process of consultation on the manner in which these<br />National Estate values would be protected.<br />The Advisory Committee on Tasmanian Forestry Operations has<br />been asked to report to the Commonwealth on the Lemonthyme<br />State Forest and Jackey's Marsh Quamby Bluff as a matter<br />of urgency. The Committee has indicated that it will make<br />every effort to provide that advice by the end of the month.<br />Meanwhile, the Deportment of Primary Industry has requested<br />from the Australian Heritage Commission detailed information<br />on the National Estate values of Jockey's Marsh Quamby<br />Bluff, to be forwarded to the Tasmanian Forestry Commission<br />as part of the formal consultation process.<br />Clearly there is disagreement between the Commonwealth and<br />Tasmanian Governments over this issue. Accordingly, I draw<br />your attention to Clause 30 of the Memorandum of<br />Understanding which states that:<br />" In the event that any dispute arises over matters<br />concerning Forest Operations and other export-related<br />matters which cannot be reconciled at officer level, the<br />two relevant Ministers will meet and will discuss the<br />problem with the intent of reaching a mutually<br />acceptable solution. The MPI and the MEF agree that<br />every endeavour will be made to implement and administer<br />the matters the subject of this understanding through<br />mutual co-operation rather than by resort to the<br />coercive use of Commonwealth or State powers and<br />prerogatives."</p>
<p>2.<br />I now call on you to agree to the activation of that clause<br />so that the Commonwealth Minister for Primary Industry and<br />the Tasmanian Minister of State Forests can discuss the<br />matter as soon as possible. Meanwhile, I am sure you will<br />agree that in the spirit of consultation and co-operation<br />forestry operations in the Jackey's Marsh Quamby Bluff<br />area should cease immediately. I trust you will take the<br />appropriate action.</p>
