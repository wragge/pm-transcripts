FOR MEDIA 23 APRIL 1984<br />
AUSTRALIA-CHINA IRON AND STEEL<br />
I have been surprised by the negative speculation over the<br />
holiday period about the prospects for co-operation between<br />
the iron and steel industries of Australia and China.<br />
The reality is that there has been rapid progress on the<br />
China iron and steel initiative, with commitment and<br />
enthusiasm in China matching that in Australia.<br />
The negative speculation has arisen from the interaction of<br />
widespread misunderstanding of the initiative, with<br />
interpretations of statements last Thursday by Mr Brian Loton<br />
of BHP.<br />
I do not propose to address the weekend. speculation or<br />
Mr Loton' s remarks. I understand that Mr Loton has put<br />
out his own statement.<br />
Given the grotesque distortions that have entered public<br />
discussion of these matters, there is clearly a need to<br />
restate the objectives of the initiative and the steps that<br />
are being taken to implement it.<br />
On 9 February I put to Premier Zhao in Beijing that Australia<br />
wished to become a significant supplier of raw materials to<br />
China's developing iron and steel industry. I also suggested<br />
that, in addition to being such a supplier of raw materials,<br />
we ought to examine the possibility of Australia supplying<br />
raw materials at a more developed stage, to be finally<br />
processed into the required final product in China. I suggested<br />
some apparent mutual economic advantages in looking at<br />
processed iron as well as raw materials.<br />
As I told the press travelling with me, I was very pleased<br />
that Premier Zhao responded positively to the proposal. we<br />
agreed to explore the prospects for multi-faceted co-operation<br />
in iron and steel within a Joint Study Group.<br />
In my public comments, I emphasised that the proposal should<br />
be seen not merely in terms of adding to trade between our<br />
two countries, but also very importantly as adding to the<br />
complementarity of our economic development programs. </p>
<p>I made it clear to the travelling press that Premier Zhao<br />
and I had in mind cooperation in a wide range of activities<br />
in the iron and steel industries: trade in steel-making<br />
raw materials; trade in processed iron; mutual technical.<br />
assistance; and investment in each other' s industries.<br />
In briefing the press, in relation to processed iron, I<br />
referred both to short-term prospects from existing capacity<br />
in Australia, and to very long-term prospects.<br />
On the former, I mentioned the possibility of the proposals<br />
having implications for the moth-balled iron making facilities<br />
at Kwinana. I had had this possibility canvassed explicitl<br />
with BHP's Chief Executive, Mr Brian Loton, prior to my.<br />
discussions with Premier Zhao. On the latter, it is obvious<br />
that long lead times would be involved, requiring new patterns<br />
of investment for Australia and China. My tentative comments<br />
on these matters indicated the long time scales involved. In<br />
my only quantitative reference to long term prospects for<br />
processed iron sales, I said: " I do not want to put figures<br />
on it at this stage except to say that if we only got a<br />
relatively small proportion of the growth in the Chinese<br />
industry, towards the end of this century it could represent<br />
something like a doubling of our capacity of industry in<br />
Australia." I have gone over this old ground at-some length to correct<br />
the grotesque view that seems to have developed in public<br />
discussion, and which reached it~ s most exaggerated heights<br />
in the last few days, that the Flawke-Zhao iron and steel<br />
initiative was all about immediately investing to produce<br />
six million tonnes of processed iron and steel for China.<br />
Progress on the initiative so far lines up well against<br />
what was promised at the time. The mutual efforts of China<br />
and Australia can only be judged an outstanding success.<br />
Soon after my return to Canberra, I met: senior union,<br />
business and State Government representatives to brief<br />
them on the initiative and to discuss coordination of our<br />
efforts in Australia. A parallel meeting at the working<br />
level agreed on administrative arrangements..<br />
At all points the Government made it clear that while the<br />
Joint Study Group had to be Government-to--Government, any<br />
commercial decisions on trade and investment would be left<br />
entirely to the judgment of the private parties. Australian<br />
officials were back in Beijing within a few weeks of my<br />
visit to discuss progress in establishing the Joint Study<br />
Group. </p>
<p>The Joint Study Group met formally in B~ eijing a couple of<br />
weeks ago. The officials involved in t: hat meeting reported<br />
strong Chinese commitment to all aspects of the matters<br />
discussed by Premier Zhao and myself. Some concrete<br />
possibilities were identified and discussed in each of five<br />
areas covered by the Zhao-Hawke understanding: Australian<br />
exports of iron and other steel-making raw materials; Chinese<br />
investment in Australian iron ore mining; mutual technical<br />
assistance; Australian investmetnt in Chinese steel-making;<br />
and Australian provision of iron and crude steel for furthe:--<br />
processing in China.<br />
As I indicated in Beijing, the work of the Joint Study Groupj<br />
is complex, and will take a considerable while to complete.<br />
But simultaneously with the Joint Study Group, Australia's<br />
private corporations are engaged in detailed discussions of<br />
immediate commercial opportunities.<br />
Australia and China have both made it clear that co-operation<br />
will proceed on the basis of equality and mutual benefit.<br />
Under the umbrella of my agreement with Premier Zhao, the CPAI<br />
group under Sir Roderick Carnegie has already discussed<br />
a range of concrete proposals for co-operation in iron and<br />
steel.<br />
More recently, one delegation from BHP's Minerals Division<br />
and one from the Steel Division visited. China, and were<br />
invited to discuss a number of substantial proposals.<br />
The Chinese Minister for Metallurgy will visit Australia<br />
for two weeks from 10 May, to familiarise himself with the<br />
Australian iron and steel industry, to advance discussions<br />
with Australian companies, and to hold further discussions<br />
with the Australian Government.<br />
I am completely satisfied with the progress that is being<br />
made. Nothing that we have learned in discussions over the past<br />
couple of months diminishes our view that there are immense<br />
potential advantages to both countries from co-operation in<br />
the iron and steel industries.<br />
China has successfully embarked on a process of rapid<br />
modernisation. Already this is being reflected in<br />
substantial increases in China's demand for iron and steel,<br />
including imports, after a temporary reduction following<br />
economic policy adjustments a few years ago. </p>
<p>China is not well endowed with high quality iron ore, and<br />
perceives potential economic advantages in supplying this<br />
and other steel-making materials to some locations in<br />
China. Australia's exceptional endowments of steel-making raw<br />
materials are well known. We have some technical capacities<br />
which appear to be useful to China's iron and steel industry.<br />
It has long been understood in Australia that, as part of<br />
a move to a more internationally-oriented manufacturing<br />
sector and economy, Australia has special advantages in the,<br />
export of processed minerals.<br />
Australia and its trading partners in the past have sometimes<br />
missed opportunities for expanded co-operation in minerals<br />
and metals on the basis of mutual benefit.<br />
The Governments of Australia and China are making the most<br />
of opportunities for co-operation in iron and steel. </p>
