PRIMEMINISTER'S VISIT TO BURMA<br />
The following is the text of an address given by the<br />
Prime M'inister, Mr Whitlam, at a dinner given in his honour by the<br />
Chalirman of the Revolutionary Council o~ f the Socialist Republic of<br />
the Union of Burma, U Ne Win, in Rangoon on 5 February 1974.<br />
" Although this is not my first-visit to the Socialist Republic<br />
of the Union of B-. rma, I come here on this occasion as the first<br />
Australian Prime Minister to visit your country. In so doing, I<br />
acknowledge with gratitude -the warm arid generous welcome accorded<br />
to my -wife and me, and to our party.<br />
We look forward, Mr Chairman, to welcoming you and your<br />
gracious wife to Australia. I hope these visits will serve as the<br />
basis for further fruitful development in the range and nature<br />
of the relationship between our two countries. I believe there are<br />
grounds for confidence that, because we now share more common<br />
interest than we did before, there will emerge a more intimate and<br />
substantial relationship between Australia and Burma.<br />
For our part, we are seeking to chart a new course for<br />
Australia in its relations with the countries of Asia. By adopting<br />
a more independent Australian stance in international affairs, by<br />
striving to turn Australia away from a military orientation in its<br />
relations with South-East Asia and by trying to remove the stain of<br />
racialism from our policies, we hope to achieve for Australia a new<br />
standing as a distinctive, tolerant and co-operative nation9 not<br />
only in Asia but in the world.<br />
In support of these objectives we have shifted the emphasis<br />
of our continuiLng involvement in Asia, and especially in South-East<br />
Asia, from one dominated by 7ideological distinctions and military<br />
alliances to one based more on encouraging security through regional<br />
co-operation, on facilitating trade with our near neighbours on a<br />
mutually benef-icial basis, and on promoting economic development </p>
<p>2.<br />
through constructive aid programs where these are wanted and where<br />
our own resources and skills can be usefully applied. Wae see a<br />
greater range of contacts through tourism9 education and culture.<br />
Such contacts, we believe, will contribute significantly to<br />
furthering our understanding of one another. I also believe that<br />
ministerial and parliamentary visits, like those exchanged recently<br />
between Australia and Burma, are of grea t value to both of us, an~ d I<br />
would hope to see such v isits extended.<br />
I stress that we do not seek to impose any unwanted culture<br />
or alien forms upon our friends. Nor do we seek to provide economic<br />
assistance where this is not welcome or useful. While we desire<br />
to live more intimately with Asia than. we have in the past, we accept<br />
that in many ways the extent and nature of this new relationship is<br />
not ours alone to determine, because we seek to retain our own<br />
freedom of choice and to develop our own in~ depen~ dence and<br />
distinctiveness, we appreciate the aspirations of others to do the<br />
same. In coming to Burma at this time I apprerolate that you are in<br />
the middle of an election an historic election consequent upon the<br />
introduction of a new cons titut ion,-. I am aware that the introductian'<br />
of the constitutioni and the consultations with The people in the<br />
course of the drafting process represent the culmination of your<br />
long-held aspirations for the evolution of a form of government -i<br />
Burma suited to the needs of the country and its people and that for<br />
more than two years it'has imposed a heavy ' burden on you and yo-ui'<br />
ministers. I congratulite you on the successful outcome of the<br />
national referend= u on the constitution held last December. Irn<br />
the same month there was a referendum in Australia on constitutional<br />
changes. I may say, sir, that I envy you in the success you achie-vedi<br />
in your referendum0<br />
Australians have long admired the way Burma has maintained itsi<br />
independence by its owni efforts and by the skill, determination and<br />
spirit of stu-rdy self-reliance which have enabled you to negotiate<br />
your w! ay through so many difficulties created by the interference ofI<br />
outside countries in the affairs of the region. We have not~ lced<br />
that in the United Nations, and in other councils, Burma has sic'Ken.<br />
eloquently of its opposition to imperialism, colonialism, nuclear<br />
weapons testing, racial discrimination. and apartheid. You-have<br />
stressed the fundatentaL importance and here I quote Your<br />
I I I<br />
A<br />
* 1<br />
1, </p>
<p>distinguished Foreign Minister " of promoting the progressive<br />
establishment of and a universal respect for the role of law".<br />
These are all matters on which my Government, too, has deep<br />
convictions. They are matters in which my Government has taken<br />
important policy initiatives in the past year.<br />
I believe Australia and Burma share a number of common<br />
objectives in our immediate region. We seek to avoid destructive<br />
confrontations and to bring about constructive co-operation. We<br />
hope to see evolve, in time, a truly regional ccmmunity without<br />
ideological overtcnes and free of great power rivalries. We seek<br />
a durable peace in South-East Asia in partnership with other nations<br />
of the region. I understand the name " Rangoon" is derived from<br />
Burmese words meaning " end of strife". Our goal, indeed, is a<br />
South-East Asia free from strife. It will no doubt take time to<br />
achieve that goal and the rest of'our common objectives in the<br />
region and elsewhere. In the meantime, however, I look to tne<br />
consolidation of our bilateral relat. ons, believing that such<br />
consolidation will bring us closer to the realisation of our wider<br />
goals and aspirations.<br />
I am happy to have your assurances of the usefulness of the<br />
Australian aid program in Burma. There will be an annual inrcrease<br />
in the size of that program. The Australian Government has pledged<br />
itself to increase the level of its financial development assistance<br />
to .7 per cent of gross domestic product by the end of the decade.<br />
We also intend to increase the percentage of our aid given through<br />
multilateral programs. Burma's developing relationship with the<br />
World Bank and the Asian Development Bank means that in this area<br />
also we will be able increasingly to contribute to Burma's prcGrras<br />
for economic development.<br />
I give these assurances in the full awareness that t" Cre ; il<br />
be new claims on Australia, especially from the emerging cc:.' r:-s<br />
of the South Pacific area, and that shortages of energy ar.<br />
will raise uncertainties about the economic and financia-<br />
Australia and Burma are both rich in natural resources, n<br />
the happy position of having full national control over<br />
My Government faces the urgent task of progressively<br />
over the development of Australia's mineral resources </p>
<p>of' which are now owned by foreign companies. At the same time we<br />
are developing policies for the balanced development of our resources<br />
and to control their sale in accordance with our national interests<br />
in a world where energy is scarce.<br />
Mr Chairman, I have deeply appreciated the frank and fruitful<br />
discussions we have had during my visit. I believe we have<br />
established that there are opportunities for growth and development<br />
in many aspects of our relationship. Especially I would hope to see<br />
positive development in the areas of trade, aid and cultural<br />
contacts. Australians have much to learn from the rich cultural and<br />
philosophical heritage that belongs to our near neighbours, by<br />
learning mor e about this heritage we will be better placed to gain<br />
from it, so that our perception of the needs and interests of these<br />
countries will be deepened and enlarged. My Government will do all<br />
it can to promote the flow of ideas and experience from the ancient<br />
civilisations of our neighbourhood. My visit to Burma o brief,<br />
yet so memorable will equip us better for that task. I have, had<br />
the opportunity to hear your views and to explain our own J shall<br />
leave with a better understanding of your policies, your -culture and<br />
your people, confident that on the basis of this new'understanding<br />
we will forge a rich, valuable and enduring friendship between our<br />
two countries. </p>
