PRIME MINSTER<br />

THURSDAY 21 APRIL FOR MEDIA<br />
SPEAKING NOTES FOR WANNON BY-ELECTION CAMPZIGN OPENING<br />
I DOUBT IF IT HAS HAPPENED BEFORE IN FELERAL<br />
HISTORY, THAT A NEWLY ELECTED GOVERNMENT HAS HAD THE<br />
OPPORTUNITY TO TEST ITS STANDING WITH THE ELECTORATE<br />
SO SOON AFTER THE ELECTION,<br />
BUT THEN, SO MANY UNPRECEDENTED THINGS HAVE<br />
HAPPENED SINCE THE FORMER MEMBER FOR WANNON ANNOUNCED<br />
THE ELECTION LESS THAN TWO MONTHS AGO, I SUPPOSE WE<br />
SHOULD NOT BE SURPRISED BY THIS.<br />
WITHOUT COMMENTING ON THE FORMER MEMBER'S<br />
RESIGNATION THREE WEEKS AFTER THE ELECTORS OF WANNON<br />
RETURNED HIM, I ONLY WANT TO SAY AT THE OUTSET THAT<br />
I WELCOME THIS EARLY OPPORTUNITY TO REPORT TO THE PEOPLE<br />
OF AUSTRALIA ON THE STEPS THEIR NEW GOVERNMENT HAS TAKEN<br />
TO SET AUSTRALIA ON THE ROAD TO NATIONAL RECOVERY, NATIONAL<br />
RECONCILIATION AND NATIONAL RECONSTRUCTION; AND THROUGH<br />
THE ELECTORS OF WANNON, TO SUBMIT OUR PERFORMANCE AND<br />
OUR PLANS TO THEIR. JUDGMENT, 1 ./ 2 </p>
<p>-2-<br />
AND I AM DELIGHTED THAT THIS OPPORTUNITY SHOULD<br />
ARISE IN AN ELECTORATE LIKE ' ANI-. ON,<br />
NOTHING COULD BE FURTHER FROM THE 11ARK THAN<br />
ANY SUGGESTION THAT THIS GOVERNMENT ITS GOIN4G TO LIMIT ITS<br />
CONCERN TO THE METROPOLITAN AND INDUSTRIAL AREAS,<br />
THE WHOLE THEME OF OUR CAMPAIGN WAS BRINGING<br />
AUSTRALIA TOGETHER, ITS WHOLE BASIS WAS THAT FOR MOST OF THE PAST<br />
DECADE, THERE HAD BEEN TOO MUCH OF THE SETTING OF<br />
AUSTRALIAN AGAINST AUSTRALIAN, GROUP AGAINST GROUP AND<br />
REGION AGAINST REGION.<br />
AND THAT PROCESS OF NATIONAL DIVISION INCLUDED<br />
AN ONGOING ATTEMPT TO SET CITY PEOPLE AGAINST COUNTRY<br />
PEOPLE. THERE WERE TOO MANY MISUNDERSTANDINGS BY CITY<br />
PEOPLE OF THE PROBLEMS AND NEEDS OF COUNTRY PEOPLE AND<br />
THE VITAL CONTRIBUTION THEY MAKE TO OUR NATIONAL ECONOMY.<br />
AND AS A PARTY, AND NOW AS A GOVERNMENT, WE<br />
REJECT COMPLETELY THE CONCEPT OF CONFLICT BETWEEN CITY<br />
AND COUNTRY. WE DEPEND ON EACH OTHER AND WE NEED EACH OTHER. </p>
<p>_ 7_<br />
AND JUST AS IN RECENT WEEKS WE HAVE BEGUN THE<br />
PROCESS OF GETTING BUSINESS AID UNIONS TO UNDERSTAND EACH<br />
OTHER BETTER, TO UNDERSTAND EACH OTHER'S PROBLEMS AND<br />
VIEWPOINT, AND TO WORK TOGETHER TO PROMOTE THEIR MUTUAL<br />
SELF-INTEREST, SO THE PROCESS OF ENDING THE ARTIFICIAL<br />
CONFLICT OF INTEREST BETWEEN CITY AND COUNTRY WILL BE<br />
PART OF OUR ONGOING TASK OVER THE YEARS TO COME.<br />
IT IS ONLY FIVE WEEKS TOMORROW SINCE WE WERE<br />
SWORN IN AS A GOVERNMENT. I BELIEVE I CAN REPORT TO YOU<br />
AND THROUGH YOU, TO THE PEOPLE OF AUSTRALIA, THAT A<br />
GREAT DEAL HAS BEEN ACCOMPLISHED.<br />
THE MAJOR TASK HAS BEEN TO CLEAR THE GROUND<br />
SO THAT WE CAN MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE MAKING THE RIGHT<br />
DECISIONS. THIS HAS INVOLVED A GREAT DEAL OF INFORMATIONACQUISITION<br />
AND INFORMATION-SHARING.<br />
THE NATIONAL ECONOMIC SUMMIT CONFERENCE ITSELF<br />
WAS AN IMPORTANT PART OF THAT PROCESS; AND IT WILL BE<br />
A CONTINUING PROCESS. / 4 </p>
<p>-4-<br />
THE FIRST THING WE HAD TO DO W'AS OF COURSE<br />
TO PROVIDE THE INFORtiATION TO THE PEOPLE OF AUSTRALIA<br />
TO MAKE THEM FULLY AVARE OF THE SERIOUSNIESS OF THE<br />
PRESENT ECONO,. IC CRISIS AND THE EXTENT OF THE PROBLEN. S<br />
WE HAVE INHERITED FROM THE PREVIOUS GOVERINMENT,<br />
INDEED WE HAD TO TAKE FIRMI AND PROM. PT ACTION<br />
EVEN BEFORE WE WERE SWORN IN.<br />
As SOON AS WE WERE ELECTED WE WERE FACED WITH<br />
AN URGENT NEED TO END THE DAMAGING AND DESTABILISING EFFECTS<br />
OF SPECULATION AGAINST THE AUSTRALIAN DOLLAR WHICH HAD BEEN<br />
DELIBERATELY AND IRRESPONSIBLY CREATED BY LEADING ME', BERS<br />
OF THE OUTGOING GOVERNMENT.<br />
MR ANTHONY, FOR EXAMPLE, MADE REPEATED STATEMENTS<br />
ALLEGING THAT THE ELECTION OF A LABOR GOVERNMENT WOULD RESULT<br />
IN A DEVALUATION OF THE DOLLAR,<br />
THE NEW LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION WENT TO THE<br />
EXTREMES OF IRRESPONSIBILITY BY PUTTING AN ACTUAL FIGURE<br />
OF 15 PERCENT ON A LABOR DEVALUATION.<br />
Now OF COURSE THESE IRRESPONSIBLE STATEMENTS<br />
BECAME SELF-FULFILLING PROPHECY, BY CREATING FURIOUS<br />
SPECULATION ON THE DOLLAR. -" fl-</p>
<p>&gt; 1/ SO WE HAD TO ACT FIRMLY; AND WE DID.<br />
AND THE 10 PERCENT DEVALUATION HAS MORE THAN<br />
REVERSED THE DAMAGE DONE BY THE SPECULATION SO IRRESPONSIBLY<br />
FUELLED BY OUR OPPONENT. S DURING THE CAMPAIGN.<br />
THE MONEY HAS FLOWED BACK. THE BALANCE OF<br />
PAYMENTS HAS BEEN STRENGTHENED, STABILITY HAS BEEN<br />
RESTORED TO THE DOLLAR.<br />
THAT WAS AN IMMEDIATE AND TEMPORARY PROBLEM<br />
WE INHERITED FROM THE DELIBERATE ACTIONS OF OUR PREDECESSORS,<br />
BUT THE ONGOING PROBLEMS WE HAVE INHERITED<br />
ARE OF A MUCH MORE DIFFICULT AND INTRACTABLE KIND.<br />
IN THE TWO WEEKS AFTER "' IR PEACOCK'S DEVALUATION<br />
STATEt-IENT, AUSTRALIA'S CASH RESERVES FELL BY NEARLY<br />
$ 3 BILLION.<br />
I op9mm W. F. </p>
<p>I IN THE TWELVE MONTHS FROM J'iARCH 1982, UNEMPLOYt-ENT<br />
GREW FROM 6.6 PERCENT TO 10.4 PERCENT OF THE WORKFORCE.<br />
UNEMP'LOYMtENT AMONG FIFTEEN TO NINETEEN YEAR OLDS IN THE<br />
WORKFORCE ROSE ABOVE 29 PERCENT.<br />
So IT MEANS THAT AMONG CERTAIN GROUPS OF OUR<br />
SOCIETY AMONG THE YOUNG PEOPLE., AMONG WOMEN IN THE<br />
WORKFORCE., AMONG MISRANTS UNEMPLOYMENT LEVELS MATCH<br />
0 THOSE EXPERIENCED IN THE DEPTHS OF THE GREAT DEPRESSION<br />
ITSELF. LAST YEAR, AUSTRALIA'S DOMESTIC PRODUCT FELL<br />
BY 1.6 PERCENT. THAT'S THE FIRST TIME SINCE 1961 THAT<br />
OUTPUT HAS FALLEN.<br />
So THE BASIC TASK AHEAD IS VERY CLEAR. WE HAVE<br />
GOT TO GET GROWTH BACK INTO THE AUSTRALIAN ECONOMY,<br />
0WE HAVE GOT TO GET THIS ECONOMY MOVING.<br />
WE HAVE GOT TO ARREST THE EXPLOSION IN<br />
UNEMPLOYMENT. 9 7 </p>
<p>-7-<br />
AND EVERYTHING WE HAVE BEEN DOING IN THE PAST<br />
FIVE WEEKS HAS BEEN DESIGNED TO ADDRESS OURSELVES TO THIS<br />
GIGANTIC TASK. TODAY, THE GOVERNOR-GENERAL OPENED THE<br />
PARLIAMENT IN CANBERRA. AND IN HIS SPEECH, HE OUTLINED<br />
THE MEASURES WE PROPOSE TO SET IN TRAIN.<br />
AND WHILE OUR GOVERNMENT'S ECONOMIC MEASURES<br />
DOMINATED THE SPEECH, REFLECTING THE SERIOUSNESS OF<br />
AUSTRALIA'S ECONOMIC SITUATION, IT IS NONE THE LESS<br />
A COMPREHENSIVE PROGRAM FOR REFORM.<br />
AND LET IT NEVER BE FORGOTTEN WHILE GETTING<br />
AUSTRALIA OUT OF THE ECONOMIC MESS WE INHERITED., THIS<br />
IS A REFORMING LABOR GOVERNMENT, COMMITTED TO THE GOAL OF<br />
CREATING A MORE EQUAL., AND A MORE JUST, AUSTRALIAN SOCIETY. </p>
