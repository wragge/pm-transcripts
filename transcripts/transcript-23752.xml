    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Commonwealth and South Australian Governments are getting on with building the infrastructure for the 21st century with early works on the North-South Corridor Torrens Road to River Torrens project beginning today at Ashwin Parade.</p>
<p>This is the first instalment of the $1.5 billion upgrade of the North-South Corridor which will slash travel times, boost freight efficiency and create hundreds of new local jobs.</p>
<p>The early works include widening South Road at the Ashwin Parade and West Thebarton Road intersection and additional through and turning lanes on South Road and Ashwin Parade.</p>
<p>It will also incorporate the construction of a new roundabout on Ashwin Parade at the entrance to the new Woolworths development.</p>
<p>Earthmoving machinery and workers will be on site from today following the awarding of a $6.8 million contract to South Australian civil engineering contractor Bardavcol Pty Ltd.</p>
<p>This package of works will support 39 South Australian jobs with the overall Torrens Road to River Torrens Project expected to support at least 480 new jobs during each year of construction.</p>
<p>Weather permitting, works are expected to be completed by April 2015.</p>
<p>Upon completion, these upgrades will improve capacity and reduce delays for the thousands of motorists that use this section of South Road every day.</p>
<p>This is another example of the Commonwealth and State Government delivering on our shared plan to create new jobs and grow the South Australian economy so everyone can prosper.</p>
<p>The beginning of early works follows the recent release of Expressions of Interest for the major construction component of the Torrens Road to River Torrens Project which is set to commence in mid 2015.</p>
<p>The Torrens-to-Torrens project will fix one of the worst sections on South Road replacing it with a fully upgraded 3.7 kilometre six-lane motorway, including 2.5 kilometres of non-stop travel.</p>
