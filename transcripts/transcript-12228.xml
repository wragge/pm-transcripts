    <content><![CDATA[<p>The claim made by the Leader of the Opposition, Kim Beazley, that the Coalition Government is the highest spending, highest taxing government in living memory is plainly wrong.</p>
<p>In making any such comparison over time, account must be taken of growth in the overall economy.  The truest measure, therefore, is government spending and taxation as a proportion of GDP.  </p>
<p>While acknowledging the difficulties in creating a consistent series across years, the 2001-02 Budget Papers show that Commonwealth tax revenues and outlays, on a cash basis, have fallen as a proportion of GDP in recent years.  </p>
<p>Commonwealth cash taxation revenues have fallen from 22.8 per cent of GDP in 1995-96 to an estimated 21.5 per cent of GDP in 2000-01.  Commonwealth Government cash outlays have likewise fallen, from 25.9 per cent of GDP in 1995 96 to an estimated 23.3 per cent in 2000-01.</p>
<p>These figures are also well below the peaks recorded by the previous Labor Government in the 1980s.</p>
<p>Importantly, the 2001-02 Budget also projects lower taxation and spending as a proportion of GDP over the forward estimates period.</p>
