    <content><![CDATA[<p>Canberra</p>
<p>JOURNALIST: (Inaudible) Craig Thomson's vote and Peter Slipper's vote or is there a difference?</p>
<p>PM: Mr Abbott has said consistently that he wouldn't accept Craig Thomson's vote and then he's got his team out there canvassing for it. It's a clear example of double standards.</p>
<p>I started the week calling out the Liberal Party on double standards and here we are at the end of the parliamentary week with double standards back on display.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST: (Inaudible) thousands of letters. Do you accept that this is just a mistake from Mathias Cormann and it was just a bit of an oversight on his part?</p>
<p>PM: It's for him to explain.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Very briefly have you had an update on Bali at all of the terrorism threat? Are you any more concerned today than you were yesterday?</p>
<p>PM: For all the obvious common sense reasons we don't comment on security matters or security arrangements. But I am intending to go to Bali. I want to be in Bali.</p>
<p>This is a moment of real significance for our nation. Ten years ago I think we would all remember where we were and how we felt, how shocked we were.</p>
<p>I want to spend some time with the families who have really had to absorb such grief. But also for the nation, speak about the journey over the ten years since, and everything that we've done to counter the threat of terrorism in Australia and beyond our shores.</p>
<p>It's what took us to Afghanistan, and of course we are still there making sure Afghanistan doesn't become a safe haven again for the training of terrorists who take Australian lives.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST: So what do you make of some publications like The New Yorker picking up events in the parliament on Tuesday and saying perhaps Obama could learn a few things from you and your speech?</p>
<p>PM: The motivation for my speech on Monday was; I'm just going to call out sexism and misogyny where I see it. And I made that point very clearly in the parliament on Monday, as for the reaction that's a matter for the people who have reacted. That was my purpose.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Do you really believe that Tony Abbott hates women, because that is the meaning of the word â€˜misogyny'.</p>
<p>PM: I believe Mr Abbott should be held to account for the things he said in public life. What I referred to on Tuesday actually, when the House first sat. What I referred to in the House on Tuesday weren't ancient statements. They weren't statements that he's made at private events.</p>
<p>They are statements he has made since he's been in this parliament and indeed been a responsible office holder in this parliament as a minister in the Howard Government, and now as Leader of the Opposition.</p>
<p>People in public life should be held to account for their statements. I am. I absolutely expect that, I should be. And Mr Abbott shouldn't be held to a different standard.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST: Australians in Bali who have seen the site of the bombings say that it's being used as a public urinal and it's actually in quite a disgraceful state. Does that disturb you?</p>
<p>PM: It does disturb me and we've worked alongside representatives of the families to try and secure this parcel of land. Unfortunately there have been some difficulties with the purchaser and with the price being asked. So that I think is to be deeply regretted and I can understand why it distresses people when they see it.</p>
<p>Thank you very much.</p>
