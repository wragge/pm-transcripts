FOR PRESS P. M. No2. / 19Q<br />
BUSH FIRES<br />
tatement by the Drmter the RtHon. Se rt Menzies<br />
I deeply regret to learn of the disastrous bush<br />
fires which are now sweeping the southern area of Australia<br />
and of the great personal hardship which has fallen on so<br />
many people in consequence of these terrible fires.<br />
I extend my warm sympathy to those who are suffering,<br />
and to those particularly who have suffered the loss of loved<br />
ones, I extend my deepest personal sympathy.<br />
The Commonwealth Government is doing all possible<br />
to assist in the emergency. The Army has 520 troops in the<br />
Bairnsdale area of Victoria and approximately 85 in the<br />
Bundanoon and Camden areas of New South W4ales. These troops<br />
are equipped with vehicles, radio and fire-fighting equipment<br />
and medical orderlies are standing by.<br />
As usual the Commonwealth Government stands ready<br />
to join with the State Governments in financing schemes for<br />
the relief of personal hardship and distress on a pound for<br />
pound basis with the States.<br />
CANBEIA, 7th March, 1965. </p>
