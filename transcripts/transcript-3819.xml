PRIME MINISTER'S SPEECH<br />
AT OPENING OF NOW, COBURG, VICTORIA,*<br />
11 JULY, 1975.<br />
IN A WEEK MOMENTOUS IN THE HISTORY OF THIS<br />
NATION,* A WEEK IN WHICH PARLIAMENT WAS RECALLED FOR A<br />
SPECIAL SESSION, A WEEK IN WHICH THE OPPOSITION SHOWED<br />
ITS FAMILIARITY WITH INTERNATIONAL F INANCE AND INTERSTATE<br />
INTRIGUE IT IS APPROPRIATE TO COM~ E BACK TO EARTH TO THE<br />
GRASS ROOTS LEVEL OF COMMUNITY INVOLVEMENT IN THE STATE<br />
WHERE I WAS BORN 59 YEARS AGO TODAY.<br />
IWAS INVITED HERE BY A GREAT AUSTRALIAN, A GREAT<br />
SERVANT OF AUSTRALIA, A GREAT FRIEND,. DR COOMBS, A. C.,<br />
THE MAN ENTRUSTED WITH THE CONDUCT OF THE ROYAL COMMISSION<br />
INTO AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT ADMINISTRATION WHICH MY GOVERNMENT<br />
ESTABLISHED JUST A YEAR AGO, ' I F I </p>
<p>I IT IS WORTH REMEMBERING THAT FACT, BECAUSE IN ALL<br />
THE WELTER OF WORDS ABOUT THE PUBLIC SERVICE AND ITS<br />
OBLIGATIONS IN RECENT WEEKS, FEW HAVE BOTHERED TO RECALL<br />
THE FACT THAT THE ROYAL COMMISSION HAS BEEN CONTINUING<br />
ITS INVESTIGATION INTO THE PUBLIC SERVICE AT ALL LEVELS<br />
AND FROM ALL ANGLES, FOR A WHOLE YEAR. AND THAT FACT IS<br />
TOO READILY FORGOTTEN BY OUR DETRACTORS. SURE, IT HAS<br />
HAD A GOOD DEAL OF PUBLICITY AT TIMES, SUCH AS WHEN<br />
PERMANENT HEADS HAVEPRESENTED SUBMISSIONS AND SPOKEN<br />
TO THEM, BUT NOT NEARLY SO MUCH WHEN ORDINARY MORTALS<br />
HAVE BOTHERED TO PRESENT THEIR VIEWS.<br />
IT IS, HOWEVER, TO THE VERY REAL CREDIT OF THIS<br />
ROYAL COMMISSION, UNDER DR COOMBS, THAT ITS OFFICERS HAVE<br />
DELIBERATELY SOUGHT OUT AND ENCOURAGED PEOPLE ON THE<br />
RECEIVING END OF THE PUBLIC SERVICE TO COMMENT ON THE<br />
QUALITY AND COMPETENCE OF. THAT SERVICE AT THE POINT WHERE<br />
* D IT REACHES THE PUBLIC,<br />
THAT, OF COURSE, IS WHERE NOW COMES IN, BECAUSE IT<br />
IS THE CREATION, THE BRAINCHILD, OF THE ROYAL COMMISSION,<br />
AND A VERY PARTICULAR EXTENSION OF ITS RESEARCH PROGRAM.<br />
IT IS AN ATTEMPT TO SEE HOW MUCH BETTER SERVED PEOPLE COULD<br />
BE, GIVEN A MORE FLEXIBLE, IMAGINATIVE APPROACH TO THEIR<br />
NEEDS AS CONSUMERS OF THE PUBLIC SERVICE PRODUCT. ITS A<br />
SWING AWAY FROM THE SPECIALIST BOUTIQUE, AND BACK TO THE<br />
ANYTHING AND EVERYTHING STORES OF AUSTRALIA'S CHILDHOOD<br />
COUNTRY TOWNS. i as /. 3 </p>
<p>3,<br />
THE ROYAL COMMISSION ON AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT<br />
ADMINISTRATION TO USE ITS FORMAL T ITLE HAS BEEN TOLD<br />
REPEATEDLY, ALL OVER AUSTRALIA, THAT THE DELIVERY OF<br />
WELFARE SERVICES, ALL OVER AUSTRALIA, IS CONFUSED AND<br />
CONFUSING. IT IS A SAD COMMENT ON THE WAY THINGS HAVE<br />
DEVELOPED IN OUR SOCIETY-THAT THOSE VERY SERVICES DESIGNED<br />
TO HELP PEOPLE FREQUENTLY ADD TO THEIR SENSE OF BEWILDERMENT<br />
AND ALIENATION AT THE VERY TIME WHEN THEY NEED THE MOST<br />
SUPPORT. EVEN AT. THE BEST OF TIMES,_ PEOPLE OFT . EN HAVE<br />
DIFFICULTY KNOWING WHICH LEVEL OF GOVERNMENT, LET ALONE<br />
WHICH DEPARTM'ENT, OR WHICH SECTION OF WHICH DEPARTMENT,-.<br />
CAN HELP THEM. AND IT'S ALL VERY WELL SAYING THAT YOU CAN LOOK<br />
IT UP IN A PHONEBOOK, BECAUSE -QUITE APART FROM. WHETHER<br />
YOU CAN READ ENGLISH TO START WITH -, IT'S ANYONE'S GUESS<br />
WHERE YOU MIGHT FIND A PARTICULAR SERVICE LISTED.<br />
SO, NO0W I S AN EXPERIMENT DEVISED BY THE ROYAL<br />
COMMISSION OFFICERS TO SEE WHETHER LOCATING* AUSTRALIAN,<br />
STATE, LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND VOLUNTARY WELFARE AGENCIES<br />
IN THE ONE PLACE WILL HELP PEOPLE TO. FIND THE PARTICULAR<br />
SERVICE THEY NEED, s es/ </p>
<p>NOIS ALSO AN EXPERIMENT IN WORKER PARTICIPATION<br />
IN THE SENSE THAT IT WILL GIVE OFFICERS OF THESE VARIOUS<br />
ORGANISATIONS THE OPPORTUNITY TO WORK TOGETHER ON WORKING<br />
OUT HOW TO IMPROVE THE SERVICE THEY GIVE THE PUBLIC.<br />
AT A TIME WHEN MORE PUBLICITY IS GIVEN TO THOSE<br />
THINGS WHICH DIVIDE THAN THOSE THINGS WHICH UNITE BRANCHES<br />
OF GOVERNMENT IN THIS COUNTRY, IT IS REFRESHING AND<br />
COMMENDABLE THAT THE VICTORIAN GOVERNMENT HAS AGREED TO<br />
JOIN THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT IN CONDUCTING A TRIAL RUN<br />
OF THE NOW SHOP FOR A TWO YEAR PERIOD. DURING THIS TIME<br />
THE EXPERIEMNT WILL BE EVALUATED FROM THE POINT OF VIEW<br />
OF THE-PEOPLE WHO USE ITS SERVICES AS WELL AS THE PUBLIC<br />
SERVANTS WORKING-IN THE SHOP,<br />
INITIALLY THE NOW SHOP WILL INVOLVE OVER TWENTY<br />
PEOPLE IN EITHER FULL OR PART-TIME POSITIONS, AND IT WILL<br />
BE OF PARTICULAR BENEFIT TO THOSE WHO LIVE AND WORK IN THE<br />
NORTH WEST REGION -THAT is. BRUNSWICK. COBURG, FAWKNER AND<br />
CAMPBELLFI ELD1 </p>
<p>THERE WILL BE TEN STAFF MEMBERS OF THE AUSTRALIAN<br />
DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SECURITY AND THE VICTORIAN DEPARTMENT<br />
r<br />
OF SOCIAL WELFARE TWO SIMILAR DEPARTMENTS WHOSE SHORTENED<br />
NAMES, " SECURITY" AND " WELFARE", ARE EASY FOR THE BUREAUCRATS<br />
TO DISTINGUISH, BUT IT'S A DISTINCTION THAT MANY PEOPLE MAY<br />
NOT READILY APPRECIATE$<br />
NOW AT COBURG WILL RECEIVE APPLICATIONS FOR<br />
PENSIONS AND BENEFITS, ADVISE ON ELIGIBILITY FOR PENSIONS<br />
AND BENEFITS AND FORWARD APPLICATIONS RECEIVED TO STATE<br />
HEADQUARTERS FOR PROCESSING AND PAYMENT. A SOCIAL WORKER<br />
WILL BE STATIONED IN THE OFFICE AND WILL UNDERTAKE SOME<br />
CASE WORK ACTIVITIES AS WELL AS LIAISE WITH OTHER WELFARE<br />
BODIES WITHIN THE COBURG/ BRUNSWICK AREA TO HELP PLAN AND<br />
IMPLEMENT COMMUNITY WELFARE PROGRAMS, A FULL INFORMATION<br />
SERVICE ON SOCIAL SECURITY MATTERS WILL BE PROVIDED IN AN<br />
EFFORT TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE IN THE AREA BECOME PROPERLY<br />
AWARE OF WHAT ASSISTANCE THEY CAN EXPECT THROUGH THE<br />
AUSTRALIAN DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SECURITY, NOW REALLY WILL<br />
BE A ONE-STOP-SHOP,<br />
THE NORTH WEST REGIONAL COUNCIL-FOR SOCIAL<br />
DEVELOPMENT HAS BROUGHT TOGETHER VOLUNTARY AGENCIES IN THE<br />
NORTH WEST AREA TO WORK IN WITH NOW, AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT IS<br />
ALSO BEING INVOLVED THROUGH THE REGIONAL ORGANISATION OF<br />
COUNCILS, / 6 </p>
<p>61<br />
SO, IN A VERY REAL SENSE, NOW WILL BE A ONE-STOP-SHOP<br />
WITH NOT ONLY AN ABUNDANCE OF CUSTOMERS, BUT ALSO AN EXISTING<br />
AND DEVELOPING GOODWILL.*<br />
IT IS, AFTER ALL, A PARTICULAR KIND OF GOOD-NATUR ED<br />
TAKEOVER OF SOMETHING THAT DIDN IT REALLY EXIST BEFORE, IT<br />
REPRESENTS A MERGING OF TALENT/ A BURYING OF REAL AND IMAGINED<br />
RIVALRIES, AND A GREAT CHALLENGE TO ALL THOSE WHO WILL HAVE<br />
THE HEADACHE AND HEARTACHE OF MAKING IT WORK, BELIEVE IT<br />
CAN BE MADE TO WORK$' I HOPE IT DOES.<br />
NOW IS THE HOUR. IT'S TIME TO CUT THE RED TAPE, </p>
