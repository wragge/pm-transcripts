PRESS OFFICE TRANSCRIPT TUESDAY, 20-JANUARY, 1981<br />
PRIME MINISTER INTERVIEWED BY BARRY CASSIDY, ABC TV<br />
CANBERRA Cassidy<br />
Prime Minister, how would it benefit 16 and 17 year olds to have,<br />
the unemployment benefit denied to them?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
I think a lot of -the publicity of the last few days has<br />
completely missed the point; missed the point that there is a<br />
realproblem. and What we try and do about it. The Schools<br />
Commission Report on the schooling for 15 and 16 year olds and.<br />
I have a copy of this Report here indicates very plainly that<br />
many of our secondary schools are concentrating on academic<br />
training for that small proportion of young* Australians who are<br />
going to go direct to a&amp;-tertiary institution.. They point out<br />
that is about 15 per cent of the kids at school. Now, this<br />
Schools Commission Report is saying in very plain terms that<br />
many of Australia's schools and maybe all I think they say<br />
of Australia's schools are failing a proportion of young Australians.<br />
Now, quite plainly, the 50,000 young'Australians under 18' who are'<br />
on the dole, they have left school early, they have not been able<br />
to get a job, must be heavily amongst those whom the Schools<br />
Commission says Australia's schools are failing. We want to<br />
establish the circumstances in which schools or-training<br />
institutions will offer courses which suit the talents and<br />
capacities of these young Australians, so they will not feel school<br />
feeling disillusioned with school and they will not have to feel<br />
disillusioned with the whole society by having the only thing that<br />
society can offer them under present circumstances and that<br />
is the dole.. Now, none of this is a substitute for expanding<br />
the number of jobs for a growing economy. We are working at that<br />
( 9 and will continue to do so, but there are many young Australians<br />
at risk. They are the ones that th school system is failing<br />
We want to try and establish with the States the kind of courses<br />
that will enable them to develop their own talents, their own<br />
aptitudes, in a constructive way. If you could establish the<br />
circumstance in which for every young Australian man and woman<br />
in the 16 and 17 year old age bracket, you can say " but there is<br />
a course available that would suit them, that will enable them<br />
to get a useful -job after they -have Left school or after they<br />
have finished formal -training at some sort of technical college"_..<br />
If there is a course available for them that will enable them to<br />
do that, and if that helps them to get a job afterwards, is that<br />
not much better than having them leave school at the age of<br />
and just getting unemployment benefits? There is another question<br />
here also, because we recognise that people keeping people in<br />
full time education a bit longer might put hardship on some low<br />
income families. There is already a secondary allowance scheme<br />
that is designed to encourage or to help low income families<br />
with their children in the last two years of secondary schooling.<br />
I in fact was the Education Minister who introduced that allowance<br />
first, 10 or so years ago. / 2 </p>
<p>2<br />
Prime Minister ( continued)<br />
But we are looking at the relevance of that and what else<br />
might need to be done if people are going to stay in full time<br />
education or training longer, and if that is going to involve<br />
increased hardship to low income families. We are looking at<br />
that as part of this overall question. Surely what we are<br />
seeking to do is much better for young Australian men and women<br />
than leaving school at the age of 15 and going on the dole.<br />
Cassidy These;..:' courses though, presumably can be provided without<br />
taking away the dole from some<br />
Prime Minister<br />
Yes, but if the courses are there, and if that leads to work,<br />
the unemployment benefit ceases to be necessary in its own right.<br />
But, that is way down the track. The debate has concentrated on<br />
the unemployment benefit issue when really the debate should have<br />
concentrated on;' why do these people leave school early' why do<br />
they find it difficult to get a job above all, and what ought<br />
society and Governments do about it.<br />
Cassidy<br />
Are you surprised though that it has become an emotive subject?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
I was very disappointed with the way some people have just<br />
spoken about unemployment benefits as though there were a decisi. on<br />
to knock off unemployment benefits and as though that was the<br />
only decision had in fact been made, because when you have a<br />
Schools Commission Report saying quite plainly that today's schools<br />
are failing the majority of young Australians because the<br />
schools are orientated towards academic tertiary training and<br />
that is n-t--wVat is going'to happen to most young Au-straliansfthen<br />
surely Governments should be expected to do something about it.<br />
Cassidy It won't mean, Prime Minister will it, that we will simplyhave<br />
a better educated unemployed?<br />
Prime Minister<br />
No I do not believe so, because and I am not trying to<br />
underestimate the difficulty of people getting work but a lot<br />
of young people leave school and do move smoothly into a'job, we<br />
know that. We also know there are 50,000 or a bit more under-18:<br />
who are on unemployment benefits. i can think of nothing more<br />
disillusioning for a young Australian. Let us just go through<br />
what has happened to him or ' to her for a moment. / 3 </p>
<p>-3<br />
Prime Minister( continued)<br />
The sort of person being described by the-Schools Commission<br />
Report has not done well at school, and the Schools Commission<br />
Report is making the point that I think I* did about a ' year a . go<br />
somewhere; ' that it is the school really that has failed the<br />
student because there are not courses that suit that particular<br />
student's capacities. So, the person has not fitted in too well<br />
at school, has not been particularly excited, has not been able<br />
to develop his or her talents at school, leaves school and because<br />
his talents and inclinations have not been properly developed<br />
and trained in the-kind of courses that would have suited thatperson,<br />
finds it harder than many others to.-get-a-job, and then<br />
becomes doubly disillusioned because he or she is riot able to<br />
get a job. That is the sort of circumstance that must be<br />
occurring to a lot of these people in the 15 to 16, 17 year old<br />
age bracket. -I do not underestimate the role-of the economy,.<br />
of the need for an expanding economy, of more jobs overall.<br />
of course that is the other side of the coin. But if these<br />
young Australians are to be given a fair chance in whatever<br />
economy we are able to establish, surely we owe them something<br />
better than a school system that, the Schools Commission says has<br />
failed them and then the dole. Now, that-is what the Government<br />
is after,. doing something about.<br />
Cassidy So Prime Minister, you are' speaking in terms that it could be<br />
a reality then, that in fact you may. be taking away the dole<br />
from the 16 and 17 year olds.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
No. Look, again, one of the very real questions not just<br />
before Governments because we have thrown this whole position<br />
out into the open for debate, and I think we were right to expect<br />
that it will be debated calmly and on its merits and on the basis3<br />
of what is in fact best for young Australians in the 16 to 17<br />
year old age group. If you have got the circumstances where<br />
they-have got adequate training at school or at a technical college,<br />
one or the other, we have a completely open mind about it, but.<br />
at least training that is suited to their needs so that they will<br />
be better equipped to move into the workforce and.! get a job that<br />
will be constructive and rewarding to them.. Now, let us take<br />
a 16 year old. He cannot get an immediate job. The option of<br />
training is available to him, training which the best vocational<br />
guidance indicates is suited to his talents and to his inclinations,<br />
if that training is available would you, as a member of society,<br />
want to leave him the option of just getting unemployment benefits?<br />
I am not asking you to come to a conclusion. I am asking you to,.<br />
with an open mind, to examine the question. If you said, well<br />
for low income families that extra money might have been quite<br />
important, all right, we have also said we are looking at the<br />
system of allowances that is available to low income families<br />
so that kids do not have to be penalised because of that. ./ 4 </p>
<p>-4<br />
Cassidy if there was a guarantee though that he could be provided<br />
with work at the end of that extra two years education, perhaps<br />
then it might be more acceptable.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
But at -the end of that extra two years he would be 18,<br />
wouldn't he.<br />
That's right.<br />
Prime Minister<br />
At the end of that extra two years he would be 18, and that<br />
is not up for examination, it is the under 18s. The matter is<br />
for examination, and all I would ask is that everyone, when th ' ey<br />
are coming to look at this particular question, really what<br />
is in the best interests of young Australians; the school<br />
system that,. not. Malcolm Fraser but the Schools Commission is<br />
not meeting the needs of a great majority of young Australians..<br />
Do something about that. They have better training, better<br />
education, so that the talents of these Australians who are in a<br />
sense pushed aside by the system can be given a fair chance in<br />
this society. Now if we can do that and achieve that in<br />
co-operation with the States, if you can have an adequate system<br />
of allowances to help low income families so that they are not<br />
put to greater hardship over those extra couple of years of<br />
schooling, then it is a real question: should the option of<br />
unemployment benefits still be available. And we have not made<br />
conclusions. We want a healthy, sensible debate about it and<br />
I would only ask people to have one thought in their minds when<br />
they are trying to come to a conclusion: what really is the<br />
best thing for young 16 and 17 year old men and women in Australia.<br />
What is the best thing for them? What do we owe them?<br />
