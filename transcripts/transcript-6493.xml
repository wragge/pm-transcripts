PRIME MINISTER CAN BERRA<br />
His Excellency the Right Honourable<br />
Sir Ninian Stephen, AK, GCMG, GCVO, KE<br />
Governor-General of the Commonwealth<br />
of Australia<br />
Government House<br />
CANBERRA ACT 2600 -8 OCT W94<br />
Your Excellency<br />
I write to advise you that the House of Representatives be<br />
dissolved and the necessary action for Senate elections be<br />
taken in time for elections for both Houses to be held on<br />
1 December 1984. 1 also advise that referendums on the<br />
Constitution Alteration ( Terms of Senators) Bill 1984 and<br />
the Constitution Alteration ( Interchange of Powers) Bill<br />
1984 recently passed by the Parliamentbe held on that date<br />
( copies of the bills are attached).<br />
The details of the election and referendum timetable I<br />
propose are:<br />
Issue of writs 26 October 1984<br />
Close of electoral rolls 2 November 1984<br />
Close of nominations 6 November 1984<br />
Polling day 1 December 1984<br />
Return of writs ( latest date) 24 January 1985<br />
The term of the current House of Representatives expires on<br />
April 1986. Section 28 of the Constitution, however,<br />
provides you with the discretion to dissolve the House of<br />
Representatives before that date.<br />
The double dissolution of February 1983 meant that this<br />
Government was faced with choosing between:<br />
bringing forward the House of Representatives election<br />
to coincide with the half-Senate election required to ' be<br />
held in time for new Senators to take their places by 1<br />
July 1985; or </p>
<p>having two national elections a half Senate election<br />
and a House of Representatives election in a period of<br />
a year or a little more, with the prospect of further<br />
unnecessary elections in the future.<br />
The timing considerations for the half Senate election<br />
caused by the 1983 double dissolution are governed by<br />
section 13 of the Constitution which allows an election to<br />
fill Senate places to be held within one year before they<br />
become vacant on 30 June 1985 and by the realities of<br />
carrying out a Senate election. The Australian Electoral<br />
Commission has advised that in order for the count to be<br />
completed in time for the new Senators to take their seats<br />
on 1 July 1985, the election needs to be held by April 198: 5.<br />
It has been the pattern over many years for elections for<br />
half the Senate to be held in the latter months of the<br />
preceding calendar year. Since 1949, and leaving aside<br />
double dissolution elections, 8 out of 10 such elections<br />
have been held in November or December and one was held in<br />
October. The Government has always advocated simultaneous elections,<br />
and it has made clear to the electorate on a number of<br />
occasions since* March 1983 why it was likely that the<br />
present Parliament would not run its full term. Separate<br />
Senate elections increase the total number of elections,<br />
disrupt the orderly processes of administration and<br />
generally are not in the public interest.<br />
A measure of the consequences for the community of not<br />
having the simultaneous election the Government has now<br />
determined upon is the cost of separate elections. The<br />
Australian Electoral Commission estimates that holding a<br />
simultaneous election will cost $ 30m as compared with $ 49m<br />
if separate Senate and House elections were held as they<br />
became due.<br />
It is notable that early elections have been held after<br />
double dissolutions in the past albeit after one round of<br />
separate elections following the 1951 Menzies double<br />
dissolution. The most recent example, is, of course, the<br />
December 1977 election obtained by Mr Fraser after the<br />
double dissolution of 1975.<br />
Another determinant of timing is the concern of the businE! ss<br />
community that if there is an election in the offing, it<br />
should be held as early as possible.<br />
Finally, legislation has been passed to increase the size of<br />
the Parliament. The extra two Senators for each State will<br />
take their seats at the first meeting of the next House of' </p>
<p>Representatives. if the elections are held together now,<br />
the first meeting will be next February. However, if the<br />
elections are not held together, it will be unclear when<br />
the first meeting will be it could be anything up to 16<br />
months after their election and it is undesirable that the<br />
voters should be asked to elect Senators without it being<br />
made clear when their term will commence.<br />
In accordance with past practice the Governors of the States<br />
issue writs for the election of Senators-for the States,<br />
pursuant to section 12 of the Constitution. State<br />
legislation provides for proclamations fixing the election<br />
dates to be published in the State Gazettes. In the case of<br />
Western Australia, 7 days notice is required for the issue!<br />
of writs. Accordingly I invite you to suggest to the<br />
Governor of each State that the dates proposed earlier in<br />
this letter be adopted for the purpose of the election of<br />
Senators in the States and that the writs be issued on<br />
26 October 1984.<br />
You might remind the Governors that, as mentioned above,<br />
these elections will be the first for the enlarged<br />
Parliament. Under the Representation Act 1983 the number of<br />
Senators to be elected on this occasion is 7 an additional<br />
2 Senators for each State. Although 5 of those elected will<br />
assume office on 1 July 1985 as usual, the first two nonsitting<br />
Senators elected will take their seats on the first<br />
day of meeting of the House of Representatives.<br />
I shall be writing to you again proposing a date for<br />
dissolving the House of Representatives but I currently hikve<br />
it in mind to advise 26 October 1984. I fully expect that<br />
by that date the Parliament will have appropriated<br />
sufficient funds to enable the work of the administration to<br />
be carried on through the election period.<br />
I would propose to make a statement to the Parliament latE~ r<br />
today, subject to your agreement with what I have proposed,<br />
announcing the election.<br />
If you agree I propose to table this letter and your reply<br />
in the Parliament at an appropriate time.<br />
Yours sincerely<br />
BOB HAWKE<br />
R. J. L. Hawke </p>
<p>REC 11 q : 5 Government House,<br />
OCTB8 1-Canberra 2600.<br />
4LtH 0* 8 October 1984<br />
I refer to your letter of today's date which you<br />
handed to me when you called on me earlier this afternoon.<br />
I now confirm my oral acceptance of the advice<br />
contained in your letter that, for the reasons you advanced<br />
in that letter, the House of Representatives should be<br />
dissolved and that I should invite State Governors to take the<br />
action necessary for the holding of Senate elections, so<br />
that elections for both Houses may be held on 1 December<br />
1984; and that in addition referendums on two measures for<br />
alteration of the Constitution be also held on that date.<br />
I note that you at present contemplate that you<br />
will be advising a dissolution of the House on 26 October,<br />
it being your expectation that by that: date Parliament will<br />
have appropriated sufficient funds to enable the work of<br />
the administration to be carried on through the election<br />
period. The Honourable R. J. L. Hawke, AC, MP,<br />
Prime Minister,<br />
Parliament House,<br />
CANBERRA. A. C. T. 2600 </p>
<p>STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
TO THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 8 OCTOBER 1984<br />
Mr Speaker<br />
I wish to advise the House that today I called upon His<br />
Excellency the Governor-General and recommended to him that<br />
the House of Representatives be dissolved, and that a<br />
general election for the Members of the House of<br />
Representatives be held on Saturday, the first of December<br />
1984. His excellency has accepted my recommendation.<br />
I have also asked the Governor-General to take the necessary<br />
action to enable an election to be held for half the Senate<br />
conjointly with the election for the House of<br />
Representatives. His Excellency has agreed to take this<br />
actLion. The details of the election timetable are:<br />
issue of writs 206 Octobcr 1984<br />
close of electoral rolls 2 November 1984<br />
close of nominations 6 November 1984<br />
polling day 1 December 1984<br />
return of writs 24 January 1985<br />
Referendums on the Constitution Alteration ( Terms of<br />
Senators) Bill 1984 and the Constitution Alteration<br />
( Interchange of Powers) Bill 1984 will als~ o be held on the<br />
first of December.<br />
The Parliament still has significant and essential<br />
Government legislation before it. The Government wishes<br />
this legislation to pass the House by the 11th October to<br />
enable it to rise then. The Senate will clearly need to sit<br />
at least an extra week to deal with the essential<br />
legislation before it. I then propose to advise the<br />
Governor-General to dissolve the House of Representatives,<br />
probably on 26 October.<br />
Mr Speaker<br />
When my predecessor as Prime Minister advised the double<br />
dissolution of the 32nd Parliament on the ever memorable 3rd<br />
of February 1983, he set in train a certain inevitability OT<br />
events. The chief of those was, of course, the election of my<br />
Government on the 5th of March 1983.<br />
But his decision to advise a double dissolution also<br />
significantly affected the electoral timetable of this, the<br />
33rd parliament of the Commonwealth. </p>
<p>As a result of that decision, the timetable for simultaneous<br />
elections f3r the House of Representatives and half the<br />
Senate which had been temporcrily restored by the<br />
premature election of 1977 was once agpin disrupted.<br />
The consequence is that under the Constitution, there must<br />
be an election for half the Senate in time to enable the<br />
newly elected Senators to take their places on the 1st of<br />
July 1985. In practical terms involving considerations of<br />
the time required by the Australian Electoral Commission to<br />
complete the counting of votes this means that the half<br />
Senate election could be held no later than April next year.<br />
It has, however, been the pattern over many years for<br />
elections for half the Senate to be held in the latter<br />
months of the preceding calendar year. Since 1949 leaving<br />
aside the three double dissolution elections eight out of<br />
ten such elections have been held in November or December<br />
and one other was held in October. The three separate half<br />
Senate elections, of 1964, 1967 and 1970, were all held in<br />
November or December.<br />
It is therefore absolutely clear, Mr Speaker, that the<br />
decision to hold the election for half the Senate on the<br />
first of December conforms entirely with well-established<br />
custom, proper procedure and clear precedents.<br />
Mr Speaker<br />
Virtually from the outset of my Prime Ministership, I have<br />
made it very clear to the Parliament and public that I<br />
intended, if possible, and if consistent with the higher<br />
national interest, to re-align the elections for the two<br />
Houses that is to say, that there would be an election for<br />
the House of Representatives on the same day as the<br />
constitutionally inevitable election for half the Senate.<br />
Mr Speaker<br />
That is now possible. It is highly desirable. And it is<br />
certainly in the best interests of Australia.<br />
I do not believe that the wisdom and propriety of this<br />
course my publicly declared intention has been seriously<br />
questioned over the past eighteen months.<br />
It was of course, the reason my predecessor gave for the<br />
early election of 1977.<br />
But Mr Speaker, there is one very significant difference<br />
between 1977 and now and that is that unlike 1977, the<br />
course we are now taking has been publicly canvassed and I<br />
believe generally accepted as proper and correct, virtually<br />
throughout the lifetime of this present Parliament. </p>
<p>Indeed Mr Speaker, in no quarter has it been more generally<br />
acknowledged ns in3vitable than on the part of our opponents<br />
opposi'e who have al~ ready committed and spent literally<br />
millions of dollars on an advertising campaign targetted on<br />
a November or December general election.<br />
And speaking of dollars, I should point out, Mr Speaker,<br />
that I am informed that the cost of two separate elections<br />
would be of the order of $ 49 million, against $ 30 million<br />
for simultaneous elections.<br />
There are, I believe, two other reasons of considerable<br />
importance why the elections for the two Houses should be<br />
held simultaneously and why the simultaneous election should<br />
be sooner rather than later in December rather than March<br />
or April.<br />
Firstly, the business community, upon whom rests so much of<br />
the effort for national economic recovery, has widely urged<br />
the need for a prompt end to the electioneering atmosphere,<br />
as a means of sustaining the confidence which together we<br />
have been able to generate. They also share our concern<br />
over the frequency of election campaigns in Australia, as a<br />
factor militating against confidence and stability. In<br />
particular, the retail trade is anxious to have the election<br />
over as long as possible before Christmas.<br />
Secondly, Mi: Speaker, by the decision of bothi Houses, the<br />
next Parliament is to be enlarged by 23 Members in the House<br />
of Representatives; and consequent upon the Constitution, by<br />
two additional Senators from each State.<br />
But those additional Senators could not take their places<br />
until after the new and enlarged House of Representatives<br />
had been elected and had met.<br />
Accordingly, Mr Speaker, if an election were to be held for<br />
half the Senate alone, the additional Senators would be, as<br />
it were, in a state of limbo for a period of anything up to<br />
sixteen months after their election.<br />
Clearly Mr Speaker, for this and every other reason, if the<br />
will and mandate of the people is to be as fresh and<br />
contemporary as possible under the Constitution, then the<br />
elections for the two Houses should be held simultaneously.<br />
That of course, is one of the reasons why we &amp; re<br />
resubmitting to the people, by way of referendum, the<br />
proposal to alter the terms of Senators so that they are<br />
linked to the term for the House of Representatives to<br />
enshrine into the Constitution itself the principle of<br />
simultaneous elections. Its passage is necessary to restore<br />
stability and electoral predictability to our Parliament-ary<br />
system. </p>
<p>Mr Speaker<br />
The decision I have announced today restores that stabi'ity,<br />
simultaneity and contemporaneity for the next Parliament.<br />
By adopting the referendum proposal, tLhe people of Australia<br />
can establish it for all future par'i2ments and for all<br />
time.<br />
Mr Speaker<br />
I have set out in some detail the more specific reasons for<br />
my recommendation today to the Goveirnor-General the<br />
technical, the practical, the legal and constitutional<br />
reasons.<br />
But Mr Speaker, over and above these, there are reasons of<br />
profound national importance why the people of Australia<br />
should now have the opportunity to pass their judgement upon<br />
their Government and to renew its mandate.<br />
Mr Speaker<br />
This Government was elected to revive and revitalise an<br />
economy which was in the grip of the worst recession<br />
Australia had known for fi~ fty years.<br />
We have done that.<br />
We were elected to restore economic growth.<br />
We have achieved that to the extent that Australia now has<br />
the fastest-growing economy of any of the OECD countries.<br />
We were elected to do what our predecessors had notoriously<br />
failed to do in their seven years to fight unemployment<br />
and inflation simultaneously.<br />
We have created a quarter of a million new jobs in eighteen<br />
months against the loss of almost a quarter of a million<br />
jobs under our predecessors.<br />
We were elected to implement 2 wide-ranging but highly<br />
responsible program of social reform.<br />
That we have done.<br />
Above all-the very foundation of all that we have been able<br />
to achieve so far we were elected to undertake our pledge<br />
to bring about a national reconcilia2tion, as the path to<br />
national recovery and national reconstruction.<br />
We have ended at last the needless confrontation and<br />
division which disfigured Australian society for a decade. </p>
<p>But Mr Speaker, if all the great gaIns and achievements of<br />
the past twenty months are to be maintained4 and built upon,<br />
then it is absolutely essential that there should be a<br />
period a long period of consolid1. tion, co-operation and<br />
creativity creativity not just in Goverameit, but in<br />
business and industry and in the Australian community as a<br />
whole. The foundation o. f all this must be a period of political and<br />
economic stability and predictability which only this<br />
Government can provide, and which this Government can best<br />
provide if it is granted, at the earliest possible<br />
opportunity, a new and re-invigorated mandate from the<br />
people of Australia.<br />
We are now at the very crucial stage of the national<br />
recovery. Even more than in the past twenty months, the<br />
need now is for firm, effective Government to carry through<br />
and consolidate the gains made so far.<br />
The Prices and Incomes Accord the basis of<br />
non-inflationary recovery has been~ spectacularly<br />
successful, and its continued acceptance and success is<br />
absolutely vital.<br />
Yet we know our opponents are pledged to the destruction of<br />
the Accord, the dismantling of all the machinery which<br />
underpin's it, and the dissipation of the spirit of<br />
co-operation an~ d consensus which binds it together and<br />
indeed, Mr Speaker, in a very real and profound sense, the<br />
spirit which now binds this nation together in a way we have<br />
not experienced before in peacetime.<br />
Here then, Mr Speaker, is the overwhelming reason why we<br />
believe we are not merely entitled, but indeed bound, to<br />
seek a new mandate at the earliest opportunity.<br />
Yet, for all that has been achieved so far, there are still<br />
pressing problems facing the Government and the nation.<br />
There is for this Government at least the totally<br />
unacceptable level of unemployment and particularly youth<br />
unemployment. This we will continue to make one of our most<br />
urgent challenges.<br />
There is the urgent need in human terms, nothing could be<br />
more urgent to end the needless and absolutely groundless<br />
anxiety which has been created amongst our pensioners by an<br />
irresponsible and indeed, thoroughly wicked and cruel<br />
campaign of fear and misrepresentation by our opponents.<br />
That alone would constitute an irrefutable justification for<br />
this election.<br />
There is the need for people once again to declare their<br />
determination that Medicare should endure. </p>
<p>There is the need to deal the f inal blov-. s to the tax<br />
avoidance industry in this country.<br />
Theri is the neee, n( 1. only to strengthen the unrelenting<br />
fight against organised crime, not . Just by laws and<br />
machinery as we are doing but to fight it in the only<br />
way by which it can ultimately by won by a nation and a<br />
Parliament genuinely united in that fight.<br />
Here then Mr Speaker, are constituted overriding reasons of<br />
the highest national importance, why we today are asking the<br />
people of Australia for a renewal of our mandate on the<br />
first of December.<br />
A new spirit of confidence and self-confidence has emerged<br />
in this nation. In the final analysis, everything we hope<br />
for in this great country of ours depends upon maintaining<br />
and fostering that spirit.<br />
Yet Mr Speaker, we have seen in recent months that there are<br />
persons in Australia -and I regret to say, there are<br />
persons in this House -who believe, however misguidedly,<br />
that they have some kind of vested interest in undermining<br />
that new spirit of national confidence and self-confidence.<br />
I believe the people of Austraia have already realised the<br />
nature and purpose of this campaign of denigration. I<br />
believe they will not easily or quickly forgive its<br />
perpetrators. Mr Speaker<br />
On the first of December, I shall not be merely seeking from<br />
the people of Australia a verdict of faith and confidence in<br />
this Government.<br />
Much more importantly, I shall be asking the people of<br />
Australia to proclaim once again their faith and confidencz<br />
in themselves, their faith and confidence in the future of<br />
this great nation. </p>
