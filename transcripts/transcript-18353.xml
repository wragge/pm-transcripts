It gives me immense pride to bring to realisation the commitment I made one year ago to institute a National Emergency Medal.</p>
<p>And there could be no better occasion to do so than on the day when we pause to reflect on what it means to be Australian  -  January 26; Australia Day.</p>
<p>In a diverse country, this day necessarily means different things to different people.</p>
<p>But if there is one common trait that we can unite in respecting above all others, it is courage and resilience in times of trouble; when everything we express in our poems and songs is put to the test and the Australian spirit shines most brightly.</p>
<p>Today we award these Medals to a group of Australians who inspired us with their courage and service during two of the most devastating summers of natural disaster Australia has ever witnessed: the Victorian bushfires of 2009 and the Queensland floods and cyclone of December 2010 and January 2011.</p>
<p>Some of our darkest days that were followed by some of our finest hours.</p>
<p>The long hours without rest or sleep.</p>
<p>The stories of men and women who went to work to help others not knowing whether their own homes would be standing when they returned.</p>
<p>Of those who risked injury or even death to help others.</p>
<p>Or brought comfort to those who had lost everything they owned.</p>
<p>I've been speaking a lot to survivors as we recover and rebuild.</p>
<p>Their talk is never of how much compensation they received or how much they appreciate their new house.</p>
<p>Without fail, they speak of the people who reached out to them in their time of need: family, friends, neighbours and so often strangers, whose assistance extended far beyond the bounds of convention or obligation.</p>
<p>In other words, they speak of you.</p>
<p>Ordinary Australians who in difficult times did extraordinary things.</p>
<p>Of course, those who are worthy of honour never seek it.</p>
<p>And medals are only ever tokens of inner values and qualities that can never fully be measured or even understood by those who were not there.</p>
<p>Alone, they are pieces of cloth and metal worth only a few dollars.</p>
<p>But what they symbolise is beyond price.</p>
<p>These medals obtain their value from you who receive them.</p>
<p>From who you are, what you have done and the things you represent.</p>
<p>Today's recipients were nominated by the heads of major non-government and government organisations which deployed staff and volunteers in response to the natural disasters.</p>
<p>I thank the National Emergency Medal Committee for crafting a set of eligibility criteria that are both appropriate and credible but also generous.</p>
<p>And to any Australian who feels a friend or a colleague merits this award, I strongly urge them to lodge a nomination because this is an award for the many, not the few.</p>
<p>An award that springs from a nation's gratitude.</p>
<p>But also from our very real sense that your actions displayed the depth of your love for this country and its people.</p>
<p>That is why the decoration of this medal is itself so eloquent  -  a green and gold ribbon, with the image of our national flower, the wattle, on its face.</p>
<p>Because heroism and community service are an expression of citizenship and what it means to be Australian.</p>
<p>This medal is therefore a message from your country that what you did was more than just a job well done.</p>
<p>You carried the hopes and goodwill of the nation with you.</p>
<p>You reminded us why we are proud to be Australian and how we are a people who never fear adversity whether from the vastness of our continent, the fury of our climate or the uncertainty of what the future may bring.</p>
<p>That story is written across every page of our history.</p>
<p>As long as our nation has men and women like this, it will never cease being written.</p>
<p>And your names now have an indelible place in those pages.</p>
<p>So please accept the National Emergency Medal as a symbol of our thanks.</p>
<p>We are a brave and resilient nation.</p>
<p>But we are grateful nation too. </p>
