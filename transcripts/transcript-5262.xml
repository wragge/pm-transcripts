FOR PRESS FRIDAY, 15 FEBRUARY, 1980<br />
JOINT PRESS STATEMENT<br />
The Prime Minister, the Minister for Home Affairs, and the<br />
members of the National Executive of the Australian Olympic<br />
Federation, met today to discuss the question of Australia's<br />
participation in the Olympic Gamnes, and to create an<br />
opportunity for an exchange of views in relation to the<br />
Prime Minister's statement that the Government will remain<br />
strongly opposed to the participation of an Australian team<br />
in the Olympic Games in Moscow.<br />
The Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs explained<br />
that the Government had given further consideration to the<br />
Government's attitude to the holding of the Olympic Games<br />
in Moscow in the light of the views expressed and discussions<br />
held by the Prime Minister in the course of his recent visit<br />
to the United States and Europe. The Government's position<br />
that it would be inappropriate for the Games to be held in<br />
Msocow was conveyed both in the discussions this morning<br />
and in a letter to the Federation, a copy of which is attached<br />
to this release.<br />
The Prime Miinister and Minister for Home Affairs expressed<br />
the view that, as a matter . of principle, an Australian team<br />
should not participate, for reasons that were discussed very<br />
fully at the meeting.<br />
The Australian Olympic Federation explained that they were<br />
concerned as to whether a withdrawal by Australia or a<br />
number of nations would constitute an effective boycott,<br />
and the President of the Olympic Federation did not feel<br />
that Australia should withdraw unless it was established<br />
beyond reasonable doubt that an effective boycott would<br />
take place.<br />
The members of the Australian Olympic Federation Executive<br />
explained to the Prime Minister that any decision for the<br />
withdrawal of the Australian team could only be made by a<br />
full conference of the Federation, the members of which<br />
would comprise representatives of all the national controlling<br />
Unions of sports printed in the Games Programme, and the<br />
State Olympic Councils. The next scheduled conference, which<br />
takes into account team nominations, and other factors, is to<br />
be held on 19 April. and, because of the rules, it could<br />
not be held before that time. / 2 </p>
<p>-2<br />
All participants found the discussions this morning<br />
constructive and useful. The Government has taken note of the<br />
points made by the Federation. For its part, the Federation<br />
has indicated that it will be watching future developments<br />
very closely and will be giving serious consideration to the<br />
views that the Government has put.<br />

oear mr. cranrje,<br />
I refer to imy letter of 22 Jaliary lart anld to Mr. Sta eyla-.<br />
letter of 5 February regarding the holdinfg Of tbL-XXII<br />
Olympic Gmnies in Moscow.<br />
You will be aware that. since 22 January, I have had<br />
discussions in the 11nited States kind Europe with the<br />
leadexs of thle United Stcltes, United IYintgdom, Wst Of~ anY<br />
arid France rcgarding the Scvict invasion of Afghanislta~ n<br />
and its serious cffccta on world peace. In part, those<br />
discussions havecovered the boycott-Tif-the Olympic Games.<br />
in Moscow.<br />
* On my return, Tr-eported to Cabinct 01i-tia rest. j t of those<br />
discussions' and3 Cabinet gave forther consideration to its<br />
attitude to holding the Ganxis in Moscow.<br />
The Governirent has strongly reaffirncd the viCw expre ssed<br />
in my lettcr of 22 January that if Soviet troops do Dot<br />
withdraw from Afthanistaiiex~ proposed b~ y Prcen√±. arte-r..*<br />
1Moscow will be an tu-suit. able site for the Gamies. The<br />
Goverment is also strongly of the view that it would not<br />
be in the-zi-tional intexest of Aus tralia for Australianls<br />
to participate in Gwinen held in lmoscow and therefore asks.<br />
that, In the event Of tIhe Suviet not Withdrawing from<br />
Afghanistan, no Australian team he sent to Moscow.<br />
For if an Australian team viere to they-would be used<br />
volitically by the Soviet Union whatever our athletes<br />
dlid or said in Moscow, The Soviet Covernrnent would represent<br />
the participation of Australian and othier athlotes as a<br />
political triumph for the Soviet Union--. -lndced, the Soviet'<br />
Union has now been describing the -holding; of th~ h~ irC<br />
Moscow as " convincing proof of the universal recognition<br />
of the historical importance and correctness of thle course<br />
of out country's foreign -policy' 7, t he vast cc'ntrtilnition of<br />
the Soviet Union to the struggile for peace"-It is thus the<br />
Soviet Union whichs is Insisting, n) ol$ t just on mixing sport<br />
and politics, but that sport Is-yolitics. Austrata and--<br />
Australians should not be parfy to this violation of the.-<br />
Olympic ideal. 2<br />
