<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Will it change the relationship between the two countries?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER CLARK</p>
<p>I think it will improve it. We'll be talking more on Monday. I'm very happy with the outcome.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>...(inaudible) more details?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER CLARK:</p>
<p>You'll hear it all on Monday. But from the New Zealand point of view it's a good deal.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Mr Howard, are you pleased to finally see this issue put to rest?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER HOWARD:</p>
<p>Oh look, I think it's been a very positive process on both sides. We've still got a few bits of fine tuning to do but it's a win win for both countries. It's not a question of one country being advantaged. I believe it will strengthen the relationship between our two societies and that's very important to me and it's very important to the Australian people.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>In terms of the dole issue it's not going to leave any disaffected New Zealanders working and paying taxes in Australia?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER HOWARD:</p>
<p>We'll talk a bit more on Monday. But it's been carefully constructed so that it's a fair outcome for both countries and the people of both countries.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Does this undermine the Anzac spirit cutting back on payments?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER HOWARD:</p>
<p>Heavens no. Nothing will ever undermine the Anzac spirit.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Why's it taken so long to sort it out?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER CLARK:</p>
<p>It's been an irritant going back to the middle of the 1980s. So this government decided to come to grips with it and I think we've got an arrangement that is durable and I think it's fair.</p>
