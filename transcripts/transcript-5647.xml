    <content><![CDATA[<p>I am greatly saddened by the death of Sir Robert Askin.</p>
<p>He was a man of determination, integrity and compassion. Sir Robert Askin knew when to be tough in times of adversity, yet this strength was tempered with a deep understanding of the human condition.</p>
<p>Sir Robert was a politician with few peers. He became Premier of New South Wales in 1965, ending 24 years of Labor administration. With Sir Robert as leader, the Liberal Party in New South Wales did not lose an election.</p>
<p>If Sir Robert was vigorous in his approach to politics, he was sensitive in dealing with those who needed help.</p>
<p>Sir Robert Askin presided over the resurgence of New South Wales as an economic power. He paved the way for the development of the State's resources, with a consequent boost in the living standards of the people of New South Wales.</p>
<p>The Sir Robert Askin I knew had courage and vision. That courage was never demonstrated more than in the fortitude he displayed during his last illness.</p>
<p>Sir Robert set an example to us all and my deepest sympathy goes to his widow, Lady Askin.</p>
<p> 9 September, 1981 </p>
