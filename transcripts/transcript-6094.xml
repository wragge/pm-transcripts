FOR MEDIA 27 April 1983<br />
The Commonwealth Government has provided South Australia with<br />
&amp; n interest free $ 11 million loan for three years to enable<br />
the salvage of some of the timber burnt in the disastrous<br />
February bushfires.<br />
Trhe bushfires destroyed 19,000 hectares of pine plantations<br />
containing a substantial proportion of the State's supply<br />
of prime saw logs.<br />
This; meant that the long-term supply of timb~ er to spwmills<br />
would be drastically reduced.<br />
The South Australian Government has estimated that it would<br />
take 15 year4 to get log uupplies back to pre-fire levels.<br />
To help alleviate the impact on employment in the timber<br />
industry South Australia proposes to harvest as much as<br />
possible to the better quality fire-damaged logs.<br />
These are to be stored under water and progressively released<br />
to mills to help maintain normal production over the next<br />
three or four years.<br />
it is essential for the logs to be harvested quickly and<br />
Gtored in water to avoid insect and fungal attack which would<br />
downgrade and ultimately cause the fire damaged timber to be<br />
useless.<br />
The Commonwealth Government appreciates the devastating impact<br />
which this unprecedented fire will continue to have on the<br />
State's timber industry.<br />
we have therefore decided to accede to South Australia's<br />
request to provide loan money to assist in meeting the<br />
very large abnormal costs of the proposed salvage operation.<br />
The salvage and storage will serve two purposes.<br />
It will help to defer loss of employment in the timber industry<br />
as a result of the fires.<br />
The controlled release of logs from storage will also avoid<br />
disruption of the national market whi~ h might ensue if log<br />
salvage was accompanied by an uncontrolled millingj programt.<br />
The South Australian Government has given an assurance that there<br />
wil~ l be no extraordinary release of sawn timber onto the market<br />
in such a way as to cause disruption. </p>
