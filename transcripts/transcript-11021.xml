<p>E&amp;OE....................................................................................................</p>
<p>GRIMSHAW:</p>
<p>Prime Minister, good morning.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Good morning, how are you, Tracey?</p>
<p>GRIMSHAW:</p>
<p>Very well, thank you. Any surprises for you in the response to the</p>
<p> budget today?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, I think the responses have been reasonable. It is a good budget</p>
<p> for the long-term future of Australia. It's very responsible.</p>
<p> It pays off a lot of debt. That's very important because if you</p>
<p> really want to set up our children for a strong 21st Century</p>
<p> we want to deliver them a government debt free 21st Century</p>
<p> and that's a very important element of the budget. We do have</p>
<p> a strong economy. We have performed a lot better than most people</p>
<p> expected but we're not complacent. And we've found room</p>
<p> for some very important initiatives in areas like health and medical</p>
<p> research, which is going to get a doubling of funding over the next</p>
<p> six years. We've put more resources into education. We've</p>
<p> put more resources into the bush. And we've introduced some very</p>
<p> good reforms in the private health insurance area that will provide</p>
<p> people with a greater incentive to enter private health insurance.</p>
<p>GRIMSHAW:</p>
<p>You have had, as you say, a reasonable response overall but there</p>
<p> are, of course, some voices raised in protest. One of the key points</p>
<p> of consternation is unemployment, that you are not doing enough if</p>
<p> you're prepared to have unemployment hover at around seven-and-a-half</p>
<p> per cent for the rest of the year.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, that's the lowest it's been for a decade. And we can</p>
<p> make further progress on the unemployment front if the Senate will</p>
<p> pass legislation to reform the unfair dismissal laws and if the Senate</p>
<p> will agree to further changes to the labour market to make it more</p>
<p> flexible. We have come a long way. We've generated 400,000 jobs</p>
<p> in three years. We've got it down to its lowest level in 10 years.</p>
<p> We want to go further. We've set up the conditions for strong</p>
<p> economic growth but we need to make some more changes to the rules</p>
<p> that govern the employment of people so it's easier to take on</p>
<p> more staff without fear of facing expensive unfair dismissal suits.</p>
<p>GRIMSHAW:</p>
<p>You also want the Senate to pass a GST and you might have expected</p>
<p> to get Senator Harradine on side with some of the measures that you've</p>
<p> made in the budget: porn crackdown, Tasmanian schemes and expanding</p>
<p> the youth allowance. But, in fact, you seem to have irritated him</p>
<p> more by pinning the expansion of the youth allowance to the passage</p>
<p> of the GST.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I don't make a habit of giving a running commentary on</p>
<p> Senator Harradine's reactions. Senator Harradine and I have discussions</p>
<p> from time to time about matters of mutual interest and of concern</p>
<p> to the Government and of concern to him. I never believe in communicating</p>
<p> with him over the airwaves.</p>
<p>GRIMSHAW:</p>
<p>But you need Senator Harradine on side, don't you? You're</p>
<p> not going to get a GST unless you get Senator Harradine on side.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Everyone knows that we need a majority in the Senate to get the GST</p>
<p> through. And everyone knows that we're coming to the decision</p>
<p> day, I guess, on that issue and it really doesn't achieve anything</p>
<p> for me to be endlessly speculating about this or that nuance of somebody's</p>
<p> reaction. If I want to say something to Senator Harradine or to Senator</p>
<p> Colston or to the Australian Democrats I'd prefer to say it first</p>
<p> in private to their faces.</p>
<p>GRIMSHAW:</p>
<p>All right, but does it alarm you when he makes comments that what</p>
<p> you've offered is too little, too late and you've improperly</p>
<p> pinned it to a GST? He's almost saying that you've tried</p>
<p> to blackmail him into voting for the GST.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, I didn't hear him say that but beyond that I've got</p>
<p> nothing else to say.</p>
<p>GRIMSHAW:</p>
<p>Okay. The Opposition says that you're relying too much in this</p>
<p> budget on the sale of the rest of Telstra and the passage of the GST,</p>
<p> is that a fair point?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, it is true that we want to sell the rest of Telstra in two stages</p>
<p>  16 per cent first, then a review to satisfy us that all the</p>
<p> community service obligations are being met. That's true but</p>
<p> we went to the public saying that. That's our policy. That's</p>
<p> what we were elected to do. Governments normally go to the public,</p>
<p> they say this, if you re-elect us, we'll do this.'</p>
<p> And what we've done is, we went to the public last October. We've</p>
<p> said, if you re-elect us we'll do this,' and last</p>
<p> night we delivered on every single promise that we made in October</p>
<p> of last year. We produced a booklet saying, Keeping Our Promises</p>
<p> for a Stronger Australia.' Of course we want to go through with</p>
<p> our programme. Of course we want tax reform but we want it because</p>
<p> the country needs it. And if we can get our plans on Telstra through</p>
<p> the Parliament we can have, by 2003, that's in three-and-a-half</p>
<p> years time, we can have no net Federal Government debt and it will</p>
<p> be the first time for almost 100 years. Now, think what that means</p>
<p> to the future prosperity of Australia. Think what that allows future</p>
<p> governments to do by way of additional spending on schools, on research,</p>
<p> on all the sorts of things that you would like to spend money on but</p>
<p> you can't because you don't have enough of it. I mean, I</p>
<p> can't believe the resistance that this is meeting in the Senate.</p>
<p> I mean, here is a heaven sent, once in a generation, opportunity to</p>
<p> free this country from the shackles of government debt and these characters</p>
<p> are against it even though the Australian people voted for us.</p>
<p>GRIMSHAW:</p>
<p>It's a fine claim to say that we'll be debt free in 2003</p>
<p> if the remainder of Telstra is allowed to be sold and if the GST passes</p>
<p> but they are two huge ifs.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, well, the GST is not related. I'm sorry, the GST, Tracey,</p>
<p> is not so related to debt. The GST is related more to lower personal</p>
<p> income tax cuts and us being a more competitive nation.</p>
<p>GRIMSHAW:</p>
<p>You talk about the promises that you've delivered on in the budget.</p>
<p> Analysts are making the point this morning that many of your rural</p>
<p> promises rely on the further sell-off of Telstra and that's not</p>
<p> looking likely.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, that was said last October. I mean, we didn't say last</p>
<p> October they were unconditional and now, seven months later, we're</p>
<p> hitching them to Telstra. What we said were unconditional last October</p>
<p> have been delivered unconditionally in this budget. Those that were</p>
<p> subject to the sale of 16 per cent are still subject to the sale of</p>
<p> 16 per cent. We haven't changed our position. We've kept</p>
<p> our faith. We've delivered on our promises in full, on time,</p>
<p> without exception.</p>
<p>GRIMSHAW:</p>
<p>You said you weren't going to offer any more compensation to</p>
<p> families and to low-income earners who are adversely affected by a</p>
<p> GST and you haven't but will some of that $5 billion surplus</p>
<p> end up going in that direction inevitably, do you think?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, there's always, there's already been a very big provision</p>
<p> for families in the tax package. Our position on the GST, Tracey,</p>
<p> is that we're not going to put and take the essential principles</p>
<p> of it. I've always said that we would be willing for some fine-tuning,</p>
<p> as I've put it, but it is already a very significantly </p>
<p> it's a generous package. There are $13 billion of personal tax</p>
<p> cuts, 80 per cent of the Australian community will be on a top marginal</p>
<p> rate of 30 cents in the dollar. You'll be able to go through</p>
<p> about $20,000 to $30,000 of increases in income without passing into</p>
<p> a higher tax bracket. Now, that will really be a ripper incentive</p>
<p> for middle Australia. And that, in many ways, is the nugget of gold</p>
<p> in our taxation policy.</p>
<p>GRIMSHAW:</p>
<p>Can we talk about education? State schools are screaming about the</p>
<p> education measures announced in the budget. Sharon Burrows from the</p>
<p> Australian Education Union quoted some figures last night. She said</p>
<p> that private school students will get between $76 and $220 each out</p>
<p> of the budget measures while 70 per cent of Australian children who</p>
<p> attend State schools will get just $10.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, that's a very dishonest comparison. You know why? Because</p>
<p> in our country, State governments are the principle sources of funding</p>
<p> of government schools. That's the arrangement. And it is quite</p>
<p> dishonest, absolutely dishonest of anybody just to look at the direct</p>
<p> Commonwealth payments to independent schools and the direct Commonwealth</p>
<p> payments to government schools. Because it has traditionally been</p>
<p> the responsibility of the Federal Government to provide the great</p>
<p> bulk of direct government funding for independent schools and it will</p>
<p> always, on a per capita basis, look bigger. I mean, the States are</p>
<p> getting a five per cent increase in the general tax revenue from the</p>
<p> Federal Government this year. And the major call on State government</p>
<p> budgets and, therefore, the major call on that money is government</p>
<p> education. It has always been the case in this country that State</p>
<p> governments provide the lion share of funding for government schools</p>
<p> and the funding that is provided from governments to private schools</p>
<p> comes from the Federal Government. Now, that's the system obtained</p>
<p> under my Government and obtained under the Hawke and Keating governments.</p>
<p> And these statistical comparisons which always occur on a per capita</p>
<p> basis between government schools and private schools according to</p>
<p> the Federal Government sourcing, they're quite dishonest and</p>
<p> they ignore the fact that the great bulk of funding going to government</p>
<p> schools is at a State government level. I mean, we have helped the</p>
<p> needy independent schools significantly. The poorer systemic Catholic</p>
<p> schools and some of the poorer country schools and newer schools whose</p>
<p> parent population are only able to pay annual fees of $2000 or $3000</p>
<p> a year, we've helped them significantly but in the process we</p>
<p> haven't disadvantaged any of the others.</p>
<p>GRIMSHAW:</p>
<p>I guess the main argument, though, is that you haven't really</p>
<p> advantaged the others in as much as private schools seemingly enjoy</p>
<p> a greater  I mean, private schools have a revenue stream, for</p>
<p> example, from fees that State schools can't access.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, that's the nature but nobody has to go to a private school.</p>
<p> But, hang on, that's the principle of our society that you have</p>
<p> free education, well, it's not totally free, nothing's totally</p>
<p> free, but it's more or less free for everybody. If you choose</p>
<p> to go to a private school then you have to carry a financial burden.</p>
<p> I mean, the purpose of this is to provide parental choice. That's</p>
<p> the principle. That is the goal to be achieved. That is the interest</p>
<p> to be served. Not the ideological views of people who support a private</p>
<p> or a government system. Why we support independent schools and government</p>
<p> schools is that we believe in freedom of choice. We think that parents</p>
<p> should have the right to decide where they send their children. Now,</p>
<p> if you are paying very high fees at a so-called very well off school,</p>
<p> you don't get much help from the Government and you have very</p>
<p> high fees. Now, I think that is probably fair enough, although perhaps</p>
<p> some of the parents in that situation wouldn't agree with me.</p>
<p> But we provide a lot of help to the poor parish schools because they</p>
<p> need it and the State government support government schools that are</p>
<p> available to everybody. And over and above their support we provide</p>
<p> literacy and numeracy support. I mean, we're putting almost </p>
<p> this budget will provide an additional, I think, $300 million of additional</p>
<p> support to government schools over and above the money that is typically</p>
<p> provided by State governments.</p>
<p>GRIMSHAW:</p>
<p>Okay. Let's talk about health insurance. The consensus is that</p>
<p> you have indeed provided an incentive for membership but the gap will</p>
<p> still encourage people into public hospitals despite the fact that</p>
<p> they have private health insurance.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, Tracey, we're working on that. One of the understandings</p>
<p> we essentially reached with the medical profession when the private</p>
<p> health insurance rebate was brought in earlier this year was the progressive</p>
<p> elimination of the gap. And for a lot of procedures in some parts</p>
<p> of Australia the gap has now been all but eliminated and we continue</p>
<p> to work on that. It is true that what we announced last night will</p>
<p> provide an additional incentive for people to go into private health</p>
<p> insurance and that is good. And the message out of it last night to</p>
<p> young people is join now while you are fit and healthy and not likely</p>
<p> to make any claims so that when that changes at some stage in the</p>
<p> future it won't be as expensive for you. A great incentive for</p>
<p> 30 year olds to join.</p>
<p>GRIMSHAW:</p>
<p>Would you agree, though, that you're not going to ease the burden</p>
<p> on public hospitals until you fix the gap problem?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I wouldn't agree that that is the only thing that constitutes</p>
<p> a burden on public hospitals. The fall in membership of private health</p>
<p> insurance funds is a problem for private hospitals. That's why</p>
<p> we brought in the 30 per cent rebate. All of these things play a part</p>
<p> and no one thing dominates the others.</p>
<p>GRIMSHAW:</p>
<p>All right. We'll leave it there. Thanks for your time this morning,</p>
<p> Prime Minister.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>A pleasure.</p>
