PRIME MINISTER<br />
PRIME MINISTER'S AUSTRALIA DAY MESSAGE<br />
JANUARY 26, 1990<br />
Today we are celebrating the first Australia Day of the<br />
1990s. It is a day for looking forward to the challenges of an<br />
exciting new decade for reaffirming our fundamental goals<br />
for Australia as we approach the 21st century.<br />
My goals for Australia are that we should build a modern,<br />
growing economy; become a more self-confident and vigorous<br />
participant in the dynamism of our region; create a<br />
community dedicated more fully not just to the quantity of<br />
our economic output but also to our quality of life to<br />
social justice, to environmental protection, to<br />
multicultural tolerance.<br />
And in a world of profound and remarkable change, I want<br />
Australia to continue to be seen as a constructive,<br />
independent and clear-sighted contributor to the emergence<br />
of peace and freedom throughout the world.<br />
That is all certainly a tall order but a nation such as<br />
Australia, with all our wealth of human and natural<br />
resources, should set ambitious goals.<br />
Indeed, as we look around this great nation, it's clear that<br />
such goals are well within our grasp.<br />
Of course difficulties lie ahead. This is no time for<br />
complacency. But I think we can, on this Australia Day,<br />
look with pride on our achievements as a community, and with<br />
confidence on our capacity, working together, to tackle our<br />
problems. There is no doubt: we have turned the national tide, from<br />
ebb to flow. The 1990s do look bright for an Australia<br />
prepared to continue the hard but rewarding work of creating<br />
prosperity, genuinely earned and fairly shared. </p>
