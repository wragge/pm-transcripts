CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVZRY<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
ADELAIDE BY-ELECTION CAMPAIGN LAUNCH<br />
ADELAIDE 18 JANUARY œ 988<br />
Friends, Six months ago, the Australian people made an historic<br />
choice. In the Federal election campign last winter, the Australian<br />
people were asked to determine the direction in which the<br />
Australian nation would travel for the final years of this<br />
century and beyond.<br />
They were presented with a choice between the starkest<br />
possible aternatives.<br />
it was a choice about whether the real issues facing the<br />
country would be addressed or whether they would be ignored.<br />
it was a choice between the continued capacity of a Labor<br />
Government to steer the economy through difficult times, and<br />
the equally obvious but diametrically opposite capacity of<br />
the conservative opposition to Jeopardise our economic<br />
recovery, and to throw away all the hard work and all the<br />
sacrifices that you the community had made to achieve that<br />
recovery. The campaign was a choice between the continued capacity of<br />
the Labor Government to spread the burden of adjustment<br />
fairly and help protect the least well off members of our<br />
community, and the proven unfairness and myopic lack of<br />
compassion of the conservatives.<br />
So when the Australi an people delivered their verdict in the<br />
ballot box on 11 July they delivered it in the most<br />
forthright of terms.<br />
They renounced the Alice in wonderland arithmetic of our<br />
conservative opponents.<br />
They refused the illusory bribe of tax cuts. 003911 </p>
<p>They repudiated the politics of division and weakness and<br />
instability which then and now hold sway in today's<br />
conservative parties.<br />
it Is scarcely possible to overestimate the significance of<br />
that decision on 11 July.<br />
For by calling on the Labor Party to continue in office, by<br />
giving us our historic Third Term, the Australian people,<br />
quite simply, rewrote the nation's political and economic<br />
agenda. Never again, I believe, will a poli tical party be able, with<br />
any credible hope of success, to go to the Australian people<br />
with voodoo economic promises that neither add up nor<br />
address the realities of the economic challenges facing our<br />
country. my friends,<br />
I remind you of all this today because we are here to launch<br />
a new campaign a campaign to elect a person who can<br />
continue to give the people of Adelaide a strong voice in<br />
Government in Canberra.<br />
There are many local issues of importance in this campaign<br />
and I know Don Farrell and his team of campaign staff are<br />
dealing with them day by day in their campaign activities.<br />
But the Adelaide by-election is also important from the<br />
national point of view.<br />
For the stark contrast which the Government and Opposition<br />
are presenting to Adelaide voters today is the same stark<br />
contrast confronting the nation last July.<br />
And the questions which the Australian people as a whole<br />
decided so decisively on 11 July are the same questions<br />
facing the voters of Adelaide on 6 February.<br />
Those questions are: which political party is best equipped<br />
to manage the economy fairly and with compassion in these<br />
times of economic difficulty; and which political leadership<br />
can win the necessary cooperation in the community to meet<br />
those challenges?<br />
Those questions were decided decisively in our favour last<br />
July and since then nothing has happened to disprove or<br />
question the accuracy of the verdict the Australian people<br />
made at the ballot box.<br />
indeed, events since the election have only confirmed their<br />
judgement. 0039) 12 </p>
<p>91<br />
Since the election the Labor Government has brought down the<br />
balanced Budget.<br />
We have kept our promise to introduce a flew program of<br />
assistance to Australia's low income families.<br />
we argued for a $ 6.50 wage increase at the National Wage<br />
Case a vital step in the maintenance of the Acco rd and a<br />
stark contrast to the miserable performance of the Liberals<br />
who in 19 of the last 21 wage cases have argued for no wage<br />
rise at all for Australian workers.<br />
we have maintained our commitment to the environment. we<br />
have nominated the tropical rainforests of North-East<br />
Queensland for world Heritage Listing. And I was delighted<br />
that late last year the World Heritage Committee accepted<br />
our nominations of uluru and Kakadu stage ii for world<br />
Listing. The Liberals, you remember, were so concerned for the<br />
environment during the election campaign that they wanted to<br />
abolish the commonwealth's departmental responsibilities for<br />
the environment.<br />
As for the economic policies the Liberals advocated in the<br />
election campaign policies which we described at the time<br />
as dangerous and shortsighted they have indeed been<br />
exposed as such by events since 11 July.<br />
Could it be seriously argued that an experiment of the<br />
magnitude the Liberals were proposing an unprecedented<br />
upheaval in fiscal policy and a massive trauma to the social<br />
fabric of the nation could have been conducted in the<br />
uncertain world economic conditions represented by the stock<br />
market crash?<br />
Could John Howard's extraordinary plan to rotate his front<br />
bench with his back bench have provided the stability and<br />
certainty which government must provide?<br />
And could the spectacular collapse of the Federal<br />
pretensions of Joh BJelke-Petersen have added to that<br />
stability? You will not find me quoting Senator John Stone very<br />
frequently at least, not quoting him approvingly but I<br />
can only support his recent verdict that the conservatives<br />
had shown in the July campaign that they were not ready for<br />
government. i would add: they are still not ready for Government.<br />
Let me take you to the clearest recent demonstration of that<br />
a demonstration provided by John Howard himself. 003913 </p>
<p>4.<br />
I refer to the speech John Howard delivered earlier this<br />
month to a convention of Young Liberals in Sydney.<br />
it was a speech which bore the portentous title " The Liberal<br />
vision 1988" a title which suggests that the 1988<br />
version of the opposition's polii ves might at least have<br />
been improved in the light of the failures of their 1987<br />
model. But the policies of folly with which the Liberals entered<br />
the campaign the policies which the Australian people,<br />
repudiated on 11 july are still basically on their policy<br />
books. Mr Howard's speech explicitly endorsed those failed policies<br />
of the last campaign.<br />
Let me quote him. He said " The theme of providing greater<br />
incentives through the tax system, through the industrial<br />
relations system and in other areas was the dominant theme<br />
of the Liberal Party's ca mpaign in the July election. I do<br />
not resile from it. Ido not apologise for it."<br />
in other words he does not resile from the illusory tax<br />
bribe which he offerd in July with all its faulty<br />
arithmetic. Nor does he resile from the necessarycimplications of the<br />
tax bribe the devastation of the socia programs which he<br />
would have slashed to finance the tax cuts.<br />
As usual he has not specified what programs he would cut or<br />
what recipients of Government assistance would be<br />
Ifict iml s ed.<br />
But it has become clear since 11 July that the Liberals<br />
would seek to cut Government spending by a massive total of<br />
some $ 11 billion.<br />
To cap off his speech Mr Howard said the Liberals would not<br />
release their new policies until they have concluded their<br />
policy review process in August.<br />
which means in the meantime they want Adelaide voters to<br />
take them on trust to forget the $ 11 billion in proposed<br />
cuts to ignore the voodoo element of his economic<br />
policies. All Mr Howard offered are what he called * the four great<br />
Liberal values:" freedom, fairness, incentive and<br />
excellence. Those are the values by which he said he will judge new<br />
policies.<br />
Where-does that leave the voters of Adelaide? 003914 </p>
<p>It leaves them with -a rhetorical reiteration of Vague<br />
goals". And that is not my conclusion but a comment from the<br />
Financial Review's editorial on the speech.<br />
The editorial continued that the speech was " a rerun of the<br />
p Iast two election campaigns during which the difficulty of a<br />
timely translation of grand phrases intotpractical policies<br />
roved to be beyond the capabilities of te Liberal<br />
ea ership."<br />
The simple tact is that Mr Howard still has no new policy to<br />
flesh out those bare bones of meaningless rhetoric.<br />
At heart john Howard still has no answer to the real issue<br />
of the economic challenge confronting Australia.<br />
This Government has told the truth about our economic<br />
difficulties. We have not sought to hide the scale of the<br />
sacrifices which were and are needed to solve those<br />
difficulties. We said that no society could sustain the assault on its<br />
national income that Australia has suffered through the<br />
collapse in the terms of trade without making real and<br />
difficult domestic adjustments.<br />
What the Labor Government has done is take the right<br />
decisions which equip Australia to cope with the<br />
international trading problems and take advantage of what<br />
new opportunities will arise.<br />
And we have done that with the cooperation and understanding<br />
of the whole community and not least with the men and<br />
women who make up Australia's trade union movement.<br />
But Mr Howard resorted to bluster. and deception when he<br />
describes Australia's economic situation.<br />
He suggested every Ir ed blooded Australian nationalist<br />
should seethe with rage" at what he claims is Australia's<br />
" financial enslavement to the rest of the world" as<br />
though he, or anyone else, could ensure Australian economic<br />
prosperity in isolation from the opportunities and<br />
challenges presented by the world's markets.<br />
Nowhere in Mr Howard's speech was there any acknowledgement<br />
of Labor's achievements in winding back the Budget deficit<br />
from the scandalous $ 10 billion which was in prospect when<br />
the Liberals left office in 1983.<br />
We have progressively and responsibly cut back that deficit<br />
to the point where, in the September Budget, Paul Keatin?<br />
was able to announce the Budget had been restored virtua ly<br />
to balance. And it is already clear that we will exceed<br />
this the current Budget will be in surplus. 003915 </p>
<p>interest rates are falling. Bank mortgage rates have now<br />
fallen to around 14 per cent.<br />
But mr Howard did not acknowledge that nor did he mention<br />
that industrial disputation has been more than halved In our<br />
time in office.<br />
Nowhere in Mr Howard's speech was there any acknowledgement<br />
of Labor's job creation achievement which has created<br />
900,000 new jobs since 1983.<br />
Nowhere did he recognise that under Labor, Australia is at<br />
last facing up to the massive task of economic<br />
reconstruction which was evaded and neglected for so many<br />
years by Liberal Governments.<br />
As I said during the election campaign, the task of<br />
structural adjustment is one of our highest priorities for<br />
our Third Term, bringing reforms to our domestic<br />
infrastructure and putting strate ies in place for the<br />
export-earning industries of the future.<br />
when Labor came to office our schools were retaining to<br />
Year 12 just over a third of the nation's school children.<br />
As a result of our policies, children are staying longer at<br />
school, acquiring the skills and abilities which will fit<br />
them better to find satisfying and constructive employment<br />
In adult life.<br />
More than half our children are now staying on to Year 12<br />
and by the early 1990s we aim to have that proportion up to<br />
two thirds.<br />
This is a major social reform but it had no place in<br />
Mr Howard's Liberal " Vision" of 1988.<br />
And nowhere in that " Vision" is there a recognition of the<br />
steadily improving position of elderly pensioners.<br />
When Labor came to office, the pension was 22.7 per cent of<br />
Average weekly Earnings now it is 24.8 per cent.<br />
The standard rate of pension has increased by 8.2 per cent<br />
in real terms under Labor compared with a fall of 2.5 per<br />
cent over the 7 years of the previous Government.<br />
I put the question to the Liberals campaigning in Adelaidehow<br />
does your leader's empty talk about freedom and fairness<br />
compare with that tangible, delivered, paid for proof of my<br />
Government's concern for the elderly members of our<br />
community? My friends,<br />
Perhaps the most glaring omission of all in his speech,<br />
devoted as it was in part to the theme of fairness, was<br />
Mr Howard's failure to mention the great revolution which is<br />
taking place in Government assistance to families. 003916 </p>
<p>i promised during the election campaign that my Government<br />
would implement a family Assistance prog ram which would mean<br />
that by 1990 no Australian child need lie in poverty.<br />
Since our re-election we have acted speedily to implement<br />
that promise.<br />
Low income Australian families are now eligible for up to<br />
$ 22 per child per week and more in the case of younger<br />
teenage rs.<br />
This Family Package is doing more to help make Australia a<br />
fairer society and a more compassionate society than any<br />
amount of rhetoric from Mlr Howard about the Liberals,<br />
" Vision" for the future.<br />
it is direct assistance, clearly targeted, and it io already*<br />
paid for within the disciplines of Labor's balanced Budget.<br />
Not as many families in Adelaide have yet applied for the<br />
new Family Assistance as we believe are entitled to.<br />
So let me take this opportunity to encourage those of you<br />
who may be eligible for this assistance to apply for it<br />
and to pass the word on to friends or work colleagues who<br />
may be eligible.<br />
The new family program is an achievement of which I am proud<br />
indeed it is an achievement of which all Labor supporters<br />
can be proud.<br />
Because it has been put in place in fulfilment of our<br />
Party's deepest aspirations to help those members of the<br />
community who are in need.<br />
Those aspirations have guided our work since 1983.<br />
They will continue to guide our work throughout our Third<br />
Term. They will continue to be our guiding 1ñ ghta through the<br />
diflicult task of managing the economy in the years ahead.<br />
wie should not delude ourselves that Australia's economic<br />
Eproblems are all solved or that all the tough decisions are<br />
behind us.<br />
But that is why we should demand that whoever represents us<br />
in Parliament formulates and is prepared to implement<br />
policies to solve those problems.<br />
And that is why I want Don Farrell to be the new member for<br />
Adelaide. 0 0 39) 17 </p>
<p>It's not just that he has a capacity for hard work. It's<br />
not just that he has a close knowledge of living and working<br />
in Adelaide to take up where Chris Hucford left off in<br />
ensuring that Adelaide's interests are fully represented in<br />
caucus and in the Federal Parliament.<br />
it is fundamentally that as a member of the Labor team in<br />
Government Donl Farrell will be able to contribute to the<br />
great * task of ensuring that Australia equips itself for the<br />
challenges and opportunities of the future.<br />
My friends,<br />
Last month, the President of the United States,<br />
Ronald Reagan and the Soviet Leader, M'ikhail Gorbachev,<br />
signed an historic treaty in Washington.<br />
it was a treaty to eliminate the entire class of<br />
intermediate nuclear weapons based in Europe and Asia the<br />
first time in the history of nuclear arms control that a<br />
treaty had been signed which mentioned the word<br />
" elimination" in its title.<br />
The conclusion of this treaty in a spirit of constructive<br />
frankness between the superpowers is a good omen for the<br />
whole world.<br />
Considerable further work is being done as the basis for<br />
future agreements on further cuts in the arsenals, bringing<br />
the world closer to the goal of the abolition of nuclear<br />
weapons. You will all know the recognised role which Australia has<br />
played in urging the superpowers to reach this agreement and<br />
in creating a climate conducive to arms control.<br />
we are only a medium sized nation but we have used all the<br />
forums available to us to advance this goal.<br />
I refer with pride to the comment of the Secretary-General<br />
of the UN Committee on Disarmament, Mr Komatina, who praised<br />
Australia's work and said that the goal of nuclear<br />
disarmament would be further advanced if more countries had<br />
tollowed Australia's lead.<br />
what role would John Howard have been able to play if he had<br />
been Prime Minister during this period?<br />
John Howard is an uncritical supporter of the US Star War$<br />
program. He has Jingoistically refused to see anything but<br />
danger in the changes currently underway in the Soviet<br />
Union. He has made it clear he prefers to operate in the<br />
black and white colors of the Cold war rather than the more<br />
subtle tones of this new era of superpower cooperation.<br />
Like Liberals of the past, John Howard sees foreign policy<br />
purely as a screen for the projection of his conservative<br />
domestic political concerns. 003918 </p>
<p>Australia cannot afford such an attitude.<br />
Friends, Some commentators say that this is only a by-election and<br />
that therefore it provides an opportunity to cast a<br />
" protest" vote.<br />
They are right this by-election does give the voters of<br />
Adelaide the opportunity toiprotest to protest against the<br />
continuing fai lure of the Li berals to fulfill their<br />
democratic role of providing a viable alternative<br />
government. it gives them the chance to protest at the continuing<br />
f ~ l r of. tho Libergilc -to -n pla wt to . atr1 . rbea<br />
facing this country. W<br />
it gives them a chance to compare those opposition failures<br />
with the continuing progress of steady reform, which we<br />
promised during the July campaign and which we have pursued<br />
since our re-el ecti on.<br />
A majority of Liberal voters doesn't support John Howard.<br />
His Federal President, john Elliott, doesn't support him.<br />
His economic spokesman, Andrew Peacock, doesn't support him.<br />
Now can the voters of Adelaide support him?<br />
So the election of Von Farrell as the Member for Adelaide<br />
will not only inject new talent into the Labor ranks.<br />
It will also remind the Liberals that they will never make<br />
political headway in this nation while they operate in a<br />
policy vacuum without specifying what they would do if they<br />
were elected to office.<br />
It will remind them they will never win the trust of the<br />
Australian people while they offer only weakness and<br />
instability at the leadership level.<br />
And it will remind them that they can never convince the<br />
Australian people that talking about fairness is a<br />
substitute for doing something about it.<br />
Meanwhile, my friends, we in the Labor Government will<br />
continue to provide the united, strong, stable and<br />
far-sighted 1leadership of this great country which the<br />
Australian people expect of us and which they fully deserve<br />
from us. 003919 </p>
