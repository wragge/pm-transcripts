TRANSCRIPT: FOREIGN CORRESPONDENTS' PRESS CONFERENCE<br />
DATE: FRIDAY 18 MARCH 1983<br />
GORDON DRAKE ( RADIO LONDON).<br />
Is there any change of truth to the start of the Royal Tour in<br />
viewi of the floods at Alice Springs?<br />
PM. Not as I am informed.<br />
GORDON DRAKE<br />
Can I ask you another question about the Constitution?<br />
There is a Constitutional Conference going on in Adelaide next<br />
month as I understand it. I saw the reconstruction of the events<br />
of 1975 last night on television I just felt what you feel on<br />
how a Governor-General at the end of the day on that fail over,<br />
should feel. What is your feeling about what can happen at the<br />
end of the day? Do you feel there is going to be a Governor-<br />
General in Canberra?<br />
r) PM<br />
At the end of the Adelaide Conference, of course.<br />
GORDON DRAKE<br />
At the end of the Parliament?<br />
PM Yes, I made it quite clear in the campaign that the question of<br />
a Republic which you seem in a rather, if I may sa~ y in a rather<br />
circuitous way, trying to get to that question, the question of<br />
a Republic, is something which I think is a longj way down the<br />
path. I have made it clear that I think Australia will come to<br />
that position, something to which they~ will come gradually, as<br />
a result of discussions conducted within our country. I have<br />
made it clear that I thought that if there were a 1epublic<br />
tomorrow it wouldn' t do one thing to improve the condi tions of<br />
people in this country who need help and that is what. I am<br />
concerned about. 1 have a very acute sense of priorities in<br />
these matters. </p>
<p>NEW ZEALAND PRESS ASSOCIATION<br />
Last year with uhemplo yment rising was pressure mounting to<br />
restrict the flow of New Zealanders coming to Australia, does<br />
your government plan any extra cutbacks on New Zealanders?<br />
PM The question of the relationship between our two<br />
countries in terms of immigration is covered by the firm<br />
agreements and nothing would be done precipitately by my<br />
government to try and change that situation. I think that we<br />
will be having discussions in a number of areas and the question<br />
of the movement yf eo le between our countries would obviously<br />
be 1s oedh ng-j ould want to discuss as much as we<br />
would. MayJ~ ttdg IuR Nswer that as you know I spoke to<br />
Mr Muldoon on Wednesday evening to convey to him the decision of<br />
our Cabinet to endorse the CER agreement and I would believe<br />
that at a reasonably early opportunity we would be having<br />
discussions and I think this matter would be one of the items<br />
that we would talk about, but there is nothing precipitate going<br />
to be done in that area.<br />
NEW ZEALAND PRESS<br />
Is that something that you would like to see happen.<br />
PM I regard our relations with New Zealand as so important that I<br />
wouldn't want to be seeing something happen in any immediate<br />
sense which could damage those relations. I repeat, it's one of<br />
the issues that I think both sides would want to talk about.<br />
Q: Your Government covers the United States bases in Australia and<br />
indeed the ANZUS treaty.<br />
PM<br />
Well we made it quite clear that in respect of the bases that<br />
they will stay*. There is some suggestion that we could be looking<br />
at the stationing of some person or persons in the United States<br />
to give more substance perhaps to the concept of full knowledge<br />
and we will be discussing that matter with our United States friends.<br />
In respect of the alliance I made quite clear during the campaign,<br />
as does our party platform, that our alliance with the United States<br />
is fundamental to our stance in the area of international relations<br />
and the security and defence of this country. I also made it clear<br />
as in fact spokespersons in this country and in the United States<br />
going back to the time of the forging of ANZUS that circumstances<br />
would change through time. Leading administration and defence<br />
spokesmen in the United States have made it clear over the year-s<br />
that it would make sense to look ait the alliance and the treaty<br />
arrangements to make sure that dit. t terms were most appropriate to<br />
the circumstances of the tim~ fld 0the foreseeable future. Our<br />
friends, in the United States understand our position absolutely<br />
and without equivocation and without any criticism on this point. </p>
<p>Indeed I understand that they share our view that at some<br />
appropriate time i,. t uture it would mak11e sense for us to sit<br />
down constructively and see, do the provisions of the treaty as<br />
they stand serve our mutual interests as most effectively as they<br />
can in current circumstances. As I have tried to make clear in<br />
previous answers on this point, this is a characteristic which<br />
will be evident in the approach of my government, not merely in<br />
international relations but in respect of the way in which we<br />
handle the Australia domestic economy. The silliest mistake<br />
that any government can make here or elsewhere is to assume that<br />
the formalised arrangements of the past are necessarily entirely<br />
appropriate to the world of today-We've never lived in a time<br />
of more dramatic change than we are involved in now and we have<br />
shown in the areas of technology, the way we produce gjoods and<br />
services that we have to be prepared to change. Now we have got<br />
to have the same intelligent flexibility in all that we do in<br />
domestic politics and external politics. Having said all that I<br />
reiterate what I said at the beginning, our relationship with the<br />
United States is foundational as far as my government is concerned.<br />
CARL ROBINSON ( NEWSWEEK ? MACAZ INE)<br />
The Labor Party and your governm-) ent are committed to resuming aid<br />
to Vietnam. Do you foresee any problems in implementing this<br />
policy as far as the United States and the ASEAN countries are<br />
coh~ cerned.<br />
PM<br />
No. I have already had talks with one of the Ambassadors from the<br />
ASEAN countries, the Indonesian Ambassador, and I have got the<br />
clear impression from him and of course I am never going to breach<br />
the confidentiality of discussions that I have with Ambassadors and<br />
representatives of other countries but I think I can broadly say<br />
that there is an understanding of our position and I would remind<br />
you as you would know yourself from the reading of the reports in<br />
the last two or three days that arrangements are in train for<br />
discussions between the ASEAN countries and the Government of<br />
Vietnam without the presence at those talks by the Heng-Sarnrin<br />
Government of Kampuchea or the alternative if we can put it that<br />
way which is being sponsored by the ASEAN countries. In other words<br />
the point I am making is there looks as though thereare going to<br />
be direct discussions , between ASEAN, and the Government of Vietnam.<br />
Now I ani simply say i n: ith that development we do seem to see a<br />
position where it may be possible to see the Australian Government<br />
moving towards the sort of things you raised in your question<br />
without there being any difficulties as far as the ASEAN countries<br />
are concerned. I make the point that we will not be unilaterally<br />
moving in that area without full discussions with the ASEAN countries<br />
and similarly with our allies in the United States. So I conclude by<br />
saying that I believe that if we move in that direction then it<br />
will be on a basis whdre we have the understanding of the ASEAN<br />
countries anc~ the United States. I make the concluding point,<br />
which is probably not necessary but it ought to be on the record,<br />
that we as a government see no merit for the ASEAN countries, for<br />
Australia, or for the United Statesl, the situation where the only<br />
relationship which the Government of Vietnam is likely to be<br />
able to have is with the Soviet Union.<br />
PETER O'LOGILEN ( ASSOCIATED PRESS)<br />
The previous government had indicated that it would issue some<br />
banking licences to foreign banks in the future. What's Your<br />
government's position on the entry of foreign banks to Australia? </p>
<p>PM We do not favour it at the present timne.<br />
BORIS BEIISRING ( DEUTSCHE PRESSE AGENTUR)<br />
Could you in general. outline how you envisage Australia's and your<br />
own rolE in world politics?<br />
PM These points are to be made at the outset. I have a clear<br />
understanding of Australia's dimension in the international scene.<br />
We are a small country in terms of population and we will be walking<br />
a line, if you like, between the absurdity of trying to strut the<br />
stage in stature which is not commensurate with the reality of our<br />
size and importance and on the other hand the stupidity of isolationism<br />
which ignores the fact that we are part of the global community.<br />
Within that framework we obviously will be giving an emphasis, a<br />
priority, to our relations with the area of which we are immediately a<br />
part. We wj. ll be trying to strengthen our relations, our economic,<br />
politicalan% ultural relations with the ASEAN countries. we will<br />
certainly be paying particular attention to our relations with Japan<br />
which is far and away our major trading partner and graduall~ y a<br />
k67 country which is assuming more significance in the political, military<br />
relationships with our part of the world. We will be giving more<br />
attention to our relations with the Peoples Republic of China, and<br />
in that respect I am very pleased that the Chinese Premier will be<br />
visiting with us next month and we will be having detailed talks<br />
with him here in Canberra. I have already pointed out the<br />
foundational aspect of the relationship with the United States. Now<br />
those are obviously the areas if you like of primary importance.<br />
One area I have excluded. We obviously have a very real concern with<br />
the whole area of the South Pacific and I will be ensuring that I<br />
and my relevant Ministers develop the embryonic bases of consultation<br />
and co-operation which already exist in the South Pacific Forum and<br />
so on. I ought to of course, also acknowledge the particular relevance<br />
to us of Papua New Guinea because Australia is absolutely unique in<br />
the world in having contiguous to it what in the terms of the past<br />
would be called an ex-colonial area. Now that poses for us<br />
strategic economic, political and social responsibilities, that will<br />
be an important part of our consideration of our international<br />
relationships. I am very pleased to say that I have a close<br />
personal relationship with Michael Somare who was in fact a witness<br />
for me in the case which I conducted, the Local Government officers'<br />
case, in New Guinea in 1966-67. No-w I have given the areas, the priority<br />
and emphasis, thi's does not of course exclude our concern with<br />
the rest of the world. IfI may refer to the Middle East. We as a<br />
government will have a real concern and intention to play whatever<br />
limited role we may be able to in moving towards a peaceful and<br />
honourable resolution of an area of problems which has been tragic<br />
for the people in the area itself and continuously an area of potential<br />
disaster for the rest of the world. Of course we have our relations<br />
with the Commonwealth and we will continue to play a meaningful role<br />
in the affairs of the Commonwealth. We will be attending the<br />
C. H. O. G. M. Conference in New Delhi in Nove7rrbcr of this year. our trading<br />
relationships with Wqestern Europe have been an area of concern<br />
particularly for our rural industries where we have residually<br />
suffered from the implementation of their agricultural policies and<br />
so we will resolutely be continuing discussions with the E. E. C.*<br />
to try and ensure as far as we are able to that Australian interests<br />
are not adversely affected.<br />
In what is necessarily, and I don't apologise for it, a rallier lengthy<br />
answer because you asked an omnibus question, in a sense that has </p>
<p>left out the eastern block countries. Let me make it clear in<br />
respect of our relatiorns with that part of the world that as I said<br />
during the campa ign, ours . will be an approa-ch which is at the same<br />
time constructive and cuatious. 1 havc had enough personal dealings<br />
with the Soviet Union to know that it would be unw., ise to think that<br />
simply to approach the Soviet on the assumption that all is sweet.<br />
reasonableness, is just not realistic. But at thiesame time I have<br />
througjhout my public life and we will in this government, accept<br />
and understand the reality of the position of the Soviet Union. I<br />
don't embrace and never would, the philosophy which is enshrined within<br />
that system but they are in place and the peace of the world, which<br />
is a fundamental concern of my government, cannot be talked about<br />
in any meaningful way in terms of not attempting to have sensible<br />
and constructive relationships with that area. And on that basis we<br />
will so attempt to conduct ourselvesr.. iw as i say I make no apology<br />
for the length of this answer because if you are going to ask a<br />
question like that I have got to try and address myself to every<br />
part of the world.<br />
Q. ( inaudible) What the attitude of the government is to Latin America. Is<br />
your government likely to place more significance on Latin American<br />
refugees-as did the previous Labor government?<br />
PM Let me go to the general part of your question and then the specific.<br />
In respect of our relations generally with Latin America, I would be<br />
asking my Ministers to adopt an approach of trying to improve the<br />
relations we have in that area. Quite clearly there are regimes in<br />
that area, the nature of which we don't welcome. I put my answer<br />
in terms of what I said at the beginning of the previous answer to<br />
that longer question. I don't assume, nor will my government be<br />
assuming, that it is our role or within our capacity to change the<br />
characters of regimes, either in that part of the world or elsewhere.<br />
Wle will try and conduct decent relationships with the governments<br />
of that area because our concern is with the people of the countries<br />
of Latin America. In respect of the latter specific part of your<br />
question refugees I simply say that our immigration program will<br />
have as a component part of it an acceptance of our obligation as<br />
a country to accept refugees and the normal tests and criteria<br />
applying in the area of immigration to refugees, that is that people<br />
have legitimate status as refugees as internationally accepted,<br />
will be applied..<br />
FISHER ( AP DOW-JONES)<br />
The 10% devaluation was blamed on capital output. Do you have<br />
any plans to ( inaudible)<br />
PM We've already done it. We've got back more than was lost, and<br />
that's because the international as well as the domestic community<br />
realised and accepted the correctness, firmness and the decisiveness<br />
of our action and, as I anticipated, what has happened is that the<br />
exchange under the mechanism which I kept in place, of the crawling<br />
peg which always fascinates me as description of an economic<br />
mechanism has operated to bring back devaluation to the order-of<br />
about 71 which is what I anticipated would happen..<br />
NIHlON KEIZAI SiIIMBUN ( MR MIKIO OSAWA)<br />
Will your government make any different capproach to Japan, compared<br />
with the former Fraser government. Japanese business and industry,<br />
for example, some of them are very anxious about whether Your </p>
<p>government would take various strict policies especially in resource<br />
development and export. Hay I ask your view of that?<br />
P1M<br />
Well, the foundational elemoent to the answer to that auestion is that<br />
which I have already given and that is that Japan is our major<br />
trading partner, both in terms of the proportion of our exp orts<br />
w-, hich it takes and in terms of the source of imports. Figures being<br />
relatively I think about 28 and 20%. Now that means that we have<br />
to give a special attention to the relationship with Japan and<br />
therefore the change of government will not mean any difference in<br />
terms of the importance that we attach to the relationship. I think<br />
I may say two or three things however which will characterise my<br />
government as in some measure different from the approach of the<br />
previous government. We will be prepared as a government to give all<br />
assistance that we can to our exporters of our major elements of<br />
export which are clearly in the iron and coal area, to try and ensure<br />
that we get the best possible deal. I say with great respect arid<br />
admiration for the Japanese Government that they have always regarded<br />
as important for government to be involved in the way in which your<br />
Cg economy develops. You may have noticed that during the campaign<br />
I often called upon the example of Japan to indicate the way in<br />
which governments do have a responsibility to try and ensure optimnal<br />
economic and social development. In Japan your government has<br />
involved itself with Industry and the Trade Unions and with academics<br />
in trying to work out what is the best way of using the limited<br />
material resources and the vast potential you have in terms of your<br />
capacity of your labour force, and that has paid off. It has been a<br />
remarkable economic performance in the whole of the post-war period.<br />
Now it is not surprising, given that philosophy, that the government<br />
has applied it in terms of the way in which it conducts trading<br />
relationships. You don't leave your trading relations simply to the<br />
unco-ordinated activities of your enterprises in Japan, and you're<br />
very sinsible not to success you have achieved. I think we wi] ll<br />
be somewhat more assiduous than the previous government in performing<br />
in to Japan. We will also be trying to make Japanese importers<br />
and your government understand it is always sensible in trade<br />
negotiations to have a longer view. At the moment we are in a<br />
depressed local economic context and there will be, i imagine, some<br />
temptation on the part of Japanese importers to seek to take as<br />
much advantage as they can in negotiations in the circumstances.<br />
our government will be gently suggesting it is wise to have a<br />
longer term view in these matters but we will be moving into a<br />
period of economic upturn and that it will be in all our interests<br />
that we have these long term receptions. May I go to one specific<br />
matter which our government would be different from the previous<br />
one, in the way it would be very much to the advantage of Japan, and<br />
that is that while as I said publicly speeches I think representatives<br />
of your country have overstated for trading purposes their percepftions<br />
of industrial relations problems in the country, and that's a fair<br />
enough bargain I guess. Nevertheless there has been a reality of<br />
problems anid difficulties in trade between our two countries<br />
resulting from industrial disputation on the waterfront and in the<br />
maritime industry. Now I just say two things about that. Firstly<br />
that it is certain that as a result of the constructive co-operative<br />
approach which our government is adopting and which is already.<br />
receiving the co--operation of the people's community and trade unions<br />
that there will be a better industrial relations environment in<br />
this country in general and that will be to our mutual benefit.<br />
Most specifically I will be looking, and asking my Ministers to<br />
look at the question of whether in ' the area of the maritimc industry<br />
we may not be able to get a better system of industrial relations </p>
<p>in that area so that trade between our country and other countries<br />
doesn't suffer the degree of disruption as the past resultingj from<br />
that would.<br />
Q: ( inaudible)<br />
PM Yes, there will be a greater degree of consistency between what we<br />
say and do on the world stage and what we in fact do internally.<br />
I don' t think in the past it has been remarkably edifying for<br />
Australia to be seen as the spokesman for lowering of protective<br />
barriers around the world and then not acting in precisel. y that way<br />
when we get back to the nuts and bolts here. There will be a<br />
consistency between what we say and what we do. In respect of the<br />
position in this country, my government really if you like, takes<br />
the view of the Crawford Committee of Inquiry, which is rnot<br />
altogether surprising seeing as I was a member of that Committee of<br />
Inquiry. Now it was a very lengthy inquiry into voluminous reports<br />
but if I can reduce the essence of the Crawford Report down in these<br />
terms it was along these lines: We concluded that through time the<br />
( 6 welfare of this country and the criterion of our relations with<br />
other countries were at one in requiring a gradual reduction in the<br />
levels of protection. Secondly we said that it was politically and<br />
economically unreal to talk about moving towards that goal in periods<br />
when your human and material resources were significantly underemployed<br />
and in which there was no clear indication that further<br />
resources released by lowering protection would simply be added to<br />
the economic scrap heap of current recess situation. Therefore what<br />
we said was that you couldn't in general terms sensibly move towards<br />
lowering protection levels until you had succeeded in reducing levels<br />
of unemployment and getting the economy moving upwards. Now that was<br />
Crawford, i~ f you like, and that is essentially the position of my<br />
government and indeed, in the current circumstances of very high and<br />
unacceptable levels of unemployment, we would not be moving to<br />
further reduce levels of protection but we would have the commitment<br />
to getting our economy moving to reducing the levels of employment<br />
because that is intrinsically what's necessary and it also is what<br />
is required to create the environment within which the desirable<br />
goal of moving towards reduced protection can be achieved.<br />
Given that answer, why then did you agree to sign the CER agreement<br />
which lowers protection?<br />
PM<br />
As there is a special relationship between New Zealand and Australia<br />
and because the processes involved in that were precisely the sorts<br />
of processes which we had talked about in Crawford, and far from it<br />
being inconsistent with the Crawford approach, it was totally<br />
consistent with it, because what we said in Crawford was that if you<br />
are going to have changes then they should come as a result of full<br />
co-operation and consultation with those who may be effected. Now in<br />
the Closer Economic Relations negotiations with Australian industry,<br />
the Australian trade union movement was involved. The ACTU accepted<br />
the heads of agreement. They have been involved in the discussions<br />
and it wa~ s because the conceptual approach of Crawford was reflected<br />
in what had happened there that my government had no difficulty, and<br />
saw virtue at our first Cabinet meeting this week in endorsing the<br />
agreement without change. </p>
<p>8.<br />
Prime minister, will there be a peace treaty with the Aborigines<br />
and what are your views on suggestions that there should be an<br />
Aboriginal sort of state v; ithin Australia?<br />
PM In regard to the latter part of your question, I personall. y reject<br />
the concept of an Aboriginal state and I don't believe that the<br />
Aboriginal people round Australia want that or regjard it as in any<br />
way feasible. I have a total commitment personally, and so does<br />
my government, to acting responsibly and consultatively in a way<br />
which is going to improve the condition, the quality of life of<br />
our Aboriginal people. It still remains, in my judgment a<br />
disgrace to our nation that as we come towards the end of the<br />
twentieth century, our Aboriginal people are still living in<br />
conditions in so many areas which neither do nustice to them, nor<br />
enable us, I believe, to hold our heads up with price while those<br />
conditions exist. The Australian people were asked in the 1960' s<br />
in a referendum to say whether the Australian Parliament, the<br />
Australian Government, should have responsibility in regard to the<br />
Aboriginal people. By an overwhelming majority they answered in<br />
the affirmative. I think it unfortunate that not all States have<br />
responded to, nor have there been sufficient pressures from this<br />
last government in this area. My government will first follow the<br />
processes of constructive consultation with the State governments<br />
to try and ensure that basic standards are reached in this area.<br />
I made it clear during the campaign, and I make it clear now, that<br />
I hope that those processes will produce positive results. If they<br />
do not the powers of the Australian people deliberately go to the<br />
Australian government will be invoked to ensure that the intention<br />
of the Australian people in this regard is achieved.<br />
Q: ( inaudible)<br />
PM I say in regard to the peace treaty that that is somothing I will<br />
be asking Mr Holding, the Minister, to look at and discuss. I have<br />
an open mind about it, it seems to me that it may be one of the<br />
implements if you like of reaching decent decisions in respect<br />
( 9 of the Aboriginal people. I am one who tends to believe that in<br />
these areas not just when you are talking about the aboriginal people<br />
but when you are talking about the conditions of people generally,<br />
that more important than words are actions. But I say that if<br />
nevertheless there is a feeling that the concept of the treaty is<br />
something which will provide a framework for more constructive action<br />
then it is something that should be looked at. But as I said before<br />
I am more interested in action than words.<br />
Could you give us your views on what Australia's relations with<br />
South Africa will be? Whether you support totally the previous<br />
government's position, particularly the decision not to issue visas<br />
to cricketers if they desire?<br />
PM<br />
Well. I really do wish you would get your time perspectives bett * er<br />
in place when you're talking about what has happened in the past.<br />
There is an assumption in your question that Australia's position<br />
in regard to South Africa arose out of the decisions of the Fraser<br />
government. ( inaudible commnent fromn questioner.) Well, there is a </p>
<p>9<br />
tendency if you look at you] r question, to come to that conclusion.<br />
Now of course the realities are that it was the Whitlam Labor<br />
Government between 1972-75 who reshaped Australia's attitude towards<br />
South Africa. Now I can say with great authority that that is the<br />
case because in my capacity as President of the ACTU before the<br />
Whitlam Labor Government came to power I pleaded with the previous<br />
government, McMahon Government, to adopt sensible attitudes in regard<br />
to visits of sporting teams from South Africa. They refused to do so<br />
and we were told that this was ridiculous and that you had to allow<br />
completely open doors in this matter. I was reviled for the lead<br />
which I took in this matter by the previous conservative government.<br />
Of course we were right and the position that I espoused then on<br />
behalf of the total Labor Movement when they were in opposition<br />
came to be the conventional wisdom from the conservatives after<br />
1975, so I go to that point so that the whole time scale in<br />
perspective can be put right. When my government acts now in<br />
respect of South Africa it will not be simply continuing what<br />
Mr Fraser did, we will be picking up what Labor did as far as it<br />
could in industrial opposition in pre-1972 and what we did in<br />
government during 1972-75. And therefore against that background I<br />
applaud the fact that Mr Fraser did come to realise that we were<br />
right and continued our policies, and we will essentially be<br />
continuing what we started and what he embraced. And we will be<br />
doing that as far as Australia is concerned and in the international<br />
forums of the world we will be co-operating with all decent-minded<br />
governments and doing what we can do co-operatively with other<br />
nations to see that the obscenity of apartheid is brought as quickly<br />
and as peaceably to an end as is possible.<br />
PHIL BRADSHAW ( REUTER)<br />
There is a report in the Sydney Morning Herald suggesting you might<br />
be embarrassed by the ALP stance on East Timor. Is that the case?<br />
SPM It may as well be understood now that I will not be commenting in<br />
any detail upon discussions that I have with the representatives of<br />
other countries, discussions which as far as I am concerned are<br />
conducted in confidence, and I will not be going to those details.<br />
But let me say this in broad terms because I talked about this<br />
\ Q issue during the campaign, that I believe that Australia has got to<br />
have constructive and friendly relations with its immediate neighbours.<br />
It is just out of the question that Australia can move into a<br />
position of not having good relations with a country on its immediate<br />
doorstep, a country of vast population, economically significant,<br />
strategically significant. And what we will be doing will be moving<br />
to try and place our relations with Indonesia on such a friendly<br />
and constructive basis. I have made it clear that the events of the<br />
past cannot be obliterated. It's an exercise in futility to say<br />
that an incoming government can command the Australian people to<br />
forget what's happened. You can't do that. What we have got to try<br />
and do is to recognise what has happened and in our negotiations with<br />
Indonesia try and move to a position where we can have relations<br />
which they will respect, and that we will respect, and I simply<br />
want to say that without going into any further detail at this stage,<br />
Bill Hayden and I, I believe, are at one in the views that I have<br />
expressed. We will be undertaking measures to try and bring about<br />
the sort of relationship in the context of our remembrance of the<br />
past that I have talked about. I hope that in the relatively near<br />
future in those terms Mr Hayden will be able to visit Indonesia<br />
and I would also hope that I would be able to do the same thing some<br />
time later this year. I have also, I may say, extended an<br />
invitation to President Suharto to visit this country. </p>
<p>L<br />
Q:<br />
Following the Russian invasion of Afghanistan your predecessor took<br />
quite a hard line out front of everyone else, sort of line on that<br />
issue which included banning visits by Russian cruise ships and<br />
cancelling visas and so on. Do you plan to move away from that<br />
policy and allow in normal cultural exchange groups and so on?<br />
PM For an allegedly strong and determined and inflexible Prime Minister<br />
in government there was an almost incalculable flexibility, in fact,<br />
in what they did, in lack of consistency in what they did. While<br />
they banned athletes they didn't in fact ban their own wool and wool<br />
products from going. But I don't want to create any more problems<br />
for Mr Fraser than he has at the moment. I am the soul of charity<br />
in these matters, but your question demands that I just referred to<br />
the maleability that they had in these matters and indeed there has<br />
since that time been some relaxation in regard to the visits of<br />
Soviet scientists and so on. No, our position will be clear and it<br />
will not be hypocritical. We will be speciferous in our condemnation<br />
of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. It cannot be justified on<br />
grounds of strategic considerations, morality, economics or any<br />
other ground. It was an invasion of the sovereign territory of<br />
another country, which is totally unacceptable. In respect of our<br />
relations with the Soviet Union on that matter, my government will<br />
make it quite clear to the Soviet Union what we think of their<br />
intervention and our belief that they should withdraw. We will not<br />
use it for confected political purposes, as did the previous<br />
government, and we will not put ourselves into the hypocritical<br />
position as I say, of baring athletes, some scientists, some<br />
cultural relationships that trade away as busily as you can. Trade<br />
will go on but so will other relations. We will convey our disturbanc<br />
at what has happened in what are sensibl. e diplomatic terms and not<br />
expost ourselves as the previous government inevitably did to the<br />
charges of blatant hypocrisy.<br />
Q: You made it clear earlier that becoming a Republic was not a<br />
priority of the government.<br />
PM Yes. Q: Could you foresee a referendum being introduced on the issue in<br />
this term of Parliament?<br />
PM Certainly not.<br />
Q: Are you cautious about the future Japanese ( inaudible)?<br />
PM I wrote about the question of the likelihood of Japan increasing<br />
its military role several years ago. I thought it was inevitable<br />
as a result of three factors. the attitude of European nations<br />
that Japan has had a relevantly free ride economica. lly because of<br />
the small amount of its resources which it devotes to its defence;<br />
the same attitude in the United States; and what I perceive<br />
would be some growing pressures within Japan for moves in this area<br />
as the economies of other countries developed and put more pressures </p>
<p>upon some of the developed Japanese industries. And that a<br />
combination of these three factors, and I wrote this in 1979, was<br />
likely to produce a situation where there was a gradual increase<br />
in the proportion of the resources of your country which were<br />
devoted to military purposes. I wrote that not in terms of enormous<br />
apprehension but it just seemed to me that it was appropriate that<br />
Australia and countries of this area should bear in mind that on<br />
any rational analysis of events that that was likely to happen.<br />
Certainly what I wrote in 1979 has proved to be accurate. Now I<br />
don't have a feeling that we will have to suddenly get terribly<br />
apprehensive but it seems to me sensible that there should be an<br />
understanding of the move that has taken place and the fact that<br />
it is possible for reasons that I have referred to that it will<br />
increase somewhat. What becomes important then is that Australia<br />
in its discussions with Japan and the United States and other<br />
countries in this region have that element taken into account in<br />
the discussions which we have and the conclusions to which we come,<br />
and certainly that in our discussions with the Japanese Government<br />
we should seek from them complete frankness as to what their<br />
intentions are in this area. I don't think it is necessary to say<br />
more than that. In respect of the second part of the question, the<br />
visits of American ships, nuclear-powered ships and so on, Japan<br />
will handle that in its way, we will handle it in ours, and we will<br />
handle it in a way which won't endanger our relationship with the<br />
United States.<br />
P: I am told you don't think very much of Mrs Thatcher's Economic<br />
Policies, but aren't you in some sort of sense in an economic<br />
situation with a spending deficit you inherited? Now how are you<br />
going to make the economy move?<br />
PM I made it quite clear that while in a campaign I would make<br />
observations about what you may be pleased to call Thatcherism or<br />
Reagonomics or whatever you like, once I had been elected Prime<br />
Minister of this country I take it as quite improper for me to make<br />
comments about the internal affairs of those countries, unless of<br />
course you are in a position of fundamental principle as we are in<br />
regard to apartheid in South Africa. And I am not as Prime Minister<br />
of this country going to intrude my observations in regard to what<br />
is being done or not done either in the United Kingdom or the<br />
United States or. anywhere else. The problems that I have inherited<br />
are the problems of Fraserism not of Thatcherism, and I will deal<br />
with them accordingly.<br />
Q: ( inaudible)<br />
PM<br />
That is for others to determine.<br />
Q: ( Japan)<br />
Are you going to Japan on your way back from the United States?<br />
PM<br />
No I am not. There is no plan to do that. But as I say I am<br />
hoping that Mr Na. sone will visit Australia. I have indeed issued<br />
an invitation to him and as I understand it, in addition to what I<br />
would hope would be his normal desires to visit Australia, he has<br />
vested interests of having a daughter living in Melbourne. So I<br />
hope that a combination of these factors will bring him here. </p>
<p>12.<br />
Your attitudes towards American invesLrient-in this country. Are<br />
you planning on further controls, or to remove control?<br />
PM<br />
No. Our position, Peter, as you know, is that we believe that<br />
Australia needs foreign investment. I've made it quite clear, the<br />
Party makes that quite clear. We will. attempt to ensure that such<br />
investment meets the guidelines that there be a majority of Australian<br />
equity and control. I will be going to the United States, I think,<br />
in June. The details have to be finalised but I have made it clear<br />
before that that is likely to happen, and when I am there I will be<br />
having discuszsions not only with the administration but with<br />
business leaders, and I have total confidence that they will not<br />
only understand but will welcome the clarity of the position of our<br />
government. I think that they will see that as our economy is going<br />
to get moving there is a place for foreign investment, but investment<br />
which, will be, as I repeat,. in circumstances where the control of<br />
our economic destiny is overwhelmingly going to be in the hands of<br />
Australians. But we welcome the assistance in getting this country<br />
going. It will be available from a number of countries including<br />
the United States.<br />
