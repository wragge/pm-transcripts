BROADCAST BY PRIME MINISTER AND ACTING<br />
TREASURER, THE RT. HON. R. G. MENZIES, C. H.,<br />
ON TUESDAY. 6TH SEPTEMBER. l96<br />
Good Evening! Tomorrow, 7th September, the Commonwealth will offer<br />
to the public three separate loans.<br />
In one, we will be seeking to raise Å 30 million in<br />
cash towards the Loan Council borrowing programme for this<br />
financial year. Under this loan, there will be a choice of<br />
three securities. Next, a new series of Special Bonds will be offered.<br />
The rates of return on this series will be somewhat higher than<br />
those of the earlier series and, as in them, the new Bonds will<br />
have the attractive features that, after the first interest<br />
date, the bonds can be cashed on one month's notice and the<br />
amount to be obtained on encashment will increase at intervals<br />
through the life of the bond.<br />
Thirdly, we are offering for conversion two earlier<br />
loans which mature on 15th September and 15th October respectively;-.<br />
TIke-securities can be converted either into the new<br />
securities offered in the general cash loan, or into the new<br />
series of Special Bonds.<br />
Perhaps I should say a word or two as to why we are<br />
again this year seeking to raise l'rge amounts of loan money for<br />
public works. In the last financial year, the total expenditure<br />
on pub] ic works in Australia was Å 584 million, which was about<br />
million greater than expenditure on uorks in the previous<br />
year. The total must continue to grow for the simple reason<br />
that our country is growing. Let me remind you of some facts<br />
that show how the need for public facilities and services is<br />
continually on the increase.<br />
* During the current five years to the end of 1960/ 61<br />
we will probably have added 1,100, CO0 people to our numbers.<br />
0Within that total there will have been an increase of<br />
some 450,0) 0 children under the age of 16 the school population<br />
in other words. I look at the schedule of public works<br />
and see that capital expenditure on schools and other educational<br />
public buildings was last year Å 40 million, an increase of<br />
just 100 per cent over the five years.<br />
I look at another item the provision for supply of<br />
electricity. The total spent last year was fÅ 123 million. The<br />
demand for electricity for domestic purposes, industry and<br />
transport is growing at something like 9 per cent per year.<br />
I see that expenditure on roads and streets was<br />
something over Å 120 million. But then I also see that the<br />
number of motor vehicles registered in Australia has increased<br />
over five years by 580,0OO or 27 per cent. Small wonder that<br />
there is a great and increasing demand for money to spend on<br />
roads and streets. And so it is with almost every item in the<br />
long list post office, railways, water supply and sewerage,<br />
ports and harbours and so on.<br />
We cannot raise all the funds we require for these<br />
capital works by loans either here or overseas, but -e raise as<br />
much as we can and it is entirely sound policy that we should<br />
do so, because the benefits that will accrue to the community<br />
will be spread over many years. </p>
<p>-4k 2.<br />
On the other hand, thn loans we float offer to the<br />
public good, sound secure and quite remunerative investment.<br />
Equally, it helps the Government, and the community,<br />
if people convert maturing bonds into new securities. The<br />
more bonds converted, the less cash the Government has to find<br />
for redemptions, and that means loss out of Revenue.<br />
May I therefore commend these loans to you and ask<br />
your support for them whether as cash subscribers or as<br />
holders of the securities put before you for conversion.<br />
Goodnight to you all.<br />
CANBERRA,<br />
6th September, 1960. </p>
