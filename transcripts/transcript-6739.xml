PRIME MINISTER<br />
CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY<br />
THE OPENING OF COM4MONWEALTH GOVERNMENT CENTRE,<br />
TOWNSVILJLE, 24 SEPTEMBER 1985<br />
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN<br />
IT IS A GREAT PLEASURE TO BE WITH YOU TODAY.<br />
I HAVE ALWAYS ENJOYED COMING TO QUEENSLAND, AND<br />
PARTICULARLY TO TOWNSVILLJE.<br />
IT WAS NEARLY TWO YEARS AGO THAT I TURNED THE FIRST SOD<br />
OF THIS NEW BUILDING A PHYSICAL TESTAMENTr TO THE<br />
COMMONWEALTH'S INTEREST IN AND INVOLVEMENT WITH THIS<br />
REGION. THIS NEW CENTRE WILL MAKE A SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTION TO<br />
PZOPLE LIVING IN THE TOWNSVILLJE AREA. PERHAPS MOST<br />
IMPORTANTLY IT WILL IMPROVE THE CONVENIENCE AND<br />
EFFECTIVENESS OF THE SERVICES PROVIDED BY THE 18<br />
COMMONWEALTH DEPARTMENTS PREVIOUSLY SCATTERED THROUGHOUT<br />
THE TOWNSVILLE AREA BY PROVIDING A SINGLE CONTACT POINT.<br />
OF PARTICULAR CONVENIENCE ARE THE SHOPFRONT FACILITIES<br />
LOCATED AT STREET AREA LEVEL WHERE THEY WOULD BE EASILY<br />
ACCESSIBLE TO THE PUBLIC PARTICULARLY THE AGED AND<br />
HANDICAPPED. BEYOND THAT, THE $ 11 MILLION SPENT ON BUILDING AND<br />
FURBISHING THIS CENTRE HAS BEEN A SOURCE OF EMPLOYMENT<br />
OPPORTUNITIES FOR MANY PERSONS IN TOWNSVILLE.<br />
NOW COMPLETED, THIS CENTRE WILL PROVIDE A MODERN AND<br />
WELL-DESIGNED WORKING ENVIRONMENT. I NOTE TH-AT THE NEW<br />
CENTRE FEATURES SEVERAL ENERGY CONSERVATION MEASURES<br />
INCLUDING THE USE OF TINTED GLASS AND SUNSCREENS ON ALL<br />
WINDOWS, ROOF INSULATION, SOLAR HOT WATER SYSTEMS WITH<br />
ELECTRIC BOOSTERS AND THE AUTOMATIC REDUCTION OF<br />
ARTIFICIAL LIGHTING LEVELS IN OFFICES AFTER HOURS OR<br />
WHEN NATURAL LIGHTING LEVELS ARE ADEQUATE.<br />
MY GOVERNMENT IS PROUD TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH THIS CENTRE<br />
AND PROUD OF THE MAJOR CONTRIBUTION THAT OUR PUBLIC<br />
WORKS PROGRAM MAKES TO THE QUEENSLAND ECONOMY. WE WILL<br />
1 01,11,85 12: 32 P. 02 </p>
<p>i i r m o u r t Q U I Z Z -j 14U 2.<br />
BE SPENDING AN ESTIM4ATED $ 133 MILLION ON OUR PUBLIC<br />
WORKS PROGRAM IN QUEENSLAND IN THIS YEAR.<br />
THAT PROGRAM WILL~, OF COURSE, INCLUDE WORK ON THE<br />
TOWNSVILLE AIRPORT WHICH IS ESTIMATED TO COST IN EXCESS<br />
OF $ 15 MILLION WHEN COMPLETED. I EXPECT THAT THE<br />
BENEFITS TO THE PEOPLE OF TOWNSVILLE OF THAT PROJECT<br />
WILL BE SUBSTANTIAL, PROVIDING IMPROVED COMMUNICATIONS<br />
AND ACCESS TO AND FROM THE REST OF AUSTRALIA.<br />
OUR PUBLIC WORKS PROGRAM IS MERELY ONE SMALL PART OF M4Y<br />
GOVERNMENT'S OVERALL ECONOMIC STRATEGY BASED ON THE<br />
PRICES AND INCOMES ACCORD. WE HAVE BEEN CONCERNED To<br />
RESTORE PROSPERITY TO THE ECONOMY THROUGH SUSTAINED NONINFLATIONARY<br />
GROWTH AT RATES NECESSARY TO REDUCE THE<br />
UNACCEPTABLY HIGH LEVELS OF UNEMPLOYMENT.<br />
MY GOVERNMENT'S CREDENTIALS AS EFFECTIVE ECONOMIC<br />
MANAGERS HAVE BEEN CLEARLY ESTABLISHED. DURING OUR<br />
PERIOD IN OFFICE* THERE HAVE BEEN 430), 700 NEW JOBS<br />
CREATED, AND UNEMPLOYMENT HAS FALLEN TO 8.3 PER CENT<br />
AUSTRALIA-WIDE.<br />
I AM PLEASED THAT TOWNSVILLE HAS PARTICIPATED IN THIS<br />
RECOVERY AND HAS IN FACT FARED SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER THAN<br />
QUEENSLAND AS A WHOLE DURING THE RECOVERY. THE<br />
UNEMPLOYMENT RATE IN TOWNSVILLE IN DECEMBER 1984 WAS 9.2<br />
PER CENT. WHILE STILL UNACCEPTABLY HIGH* THAT FIGURE<br />
COMPARES FAVOURABLY WITH A RATE OF 10.9 PER CENT IN<br />
DECEMBER 1984 FOR THE NORTH AND FAR NORTH QUEENSLAND AREA<br />
AS A WHOLE AND A RATE OF 10 PER CENT FOR QUEENSLAND.<br />
I NOTE THAT THE GROWTH IN EMPLOYMENT GENERATED BY THE<br />
EXPANDING TOURIST INDUSTRY IS EXPECTED TO CONTINUE AND<br />
THAT THE OPENING OF THE BREAKWATER ISLAND CASINO IN 1986<br />
IS FORECAST TO EMPLOY OVER 400 PEOPLE.<br />
WITH ITS DIVERSIFIED ECONOMY, YOUR CITY IS WELL PLACED<br />
TO SHARE IN THE ECONOMIC GROWTH THAT MY GOVERNMENT" S<br />
POLICIES HAVE BROUGHT TO THE ECONOMY.<br />
IT IS AGAINST THIS BACKGROUND THAT I BELIEVE THIS LATEST<br />
COMMONWEALTH COMMITMENT TO TOWNSVILLE TAKES ON A<br />
PARTICULAR SIGNIFICANCE.<br />
THERE WOULD BE SOME WHO WOULD PARTICULARLY APPRECIATE<br />
THIS DEVELOPMENT. AMONG OUR GUESTS TODAY IS LIONEL<br />
SAMPFORD THE DIRECTOR OF OPERATIONS OF THE AUSTRALIAN<br />
ELECTORAL COMMISSION IN BRISBANE. HE WAS, I BELIEVE<br />
AS THE THEN ELECTORAL RETURNING OFFICER FOR ' HE DIVISION<br />
OF HERBERT A GUEST AT THE OPENING BY SIR REGINALD<br />
SCHWARTZ IN 1963 OF THE FIRST COMMONWEALTH B3UILDING IN<br />
TOWNSVILLE. HE WOULD UNDERSTAND AS MUCH AS ANYONE THE PARTICULAR<br />
PLEASURE I NOW HAVE IN FORMALLY DECLARING THIS NEW<br />
COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT CENTRE OPEN. .1 Q 1L w -LJS </p>
