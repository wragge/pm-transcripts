ADDRJ7SS AT THE OPENING OF THE ANNUAL CONFERENCE OF THE<br />
AUSTRZALIAN PETROLEUM4 EXPLORATION ASSOCIATION, SYDNEY OPERA HOUSE<br />
It is a great pleasure to address this confer~ ence of thEi Australian<br />
Petroleum Exploration Association. When I first saw the! title of<br />
this conference " Risk and Reward" it struck me how much<br />
politicians and petroleum. explorers have in common. In both cases<br />
it often seems the risks are legion, and the rewards all too<br />
infrequent. But-so far-no one has found an adequate substitute<br />
for either of us. The main advantage of our product over yours<br />
is that our-ideas are capable-of being constantly recycled.<br />
The question of " risk and reward" 1ns great relevance to the problems<br />
that have beset the Australian economy in recent years, and to the<br />
policy strategy the Government has been pursuing to overcome those<br />
problems. The Australian economy's ability to function effectively<br />
depends on investors' willingness to take business risks, and on<br />
the existence of an economic environment that provides rewards to<br />
the successful risk takers. Between 1972 and 1975, the economy<br />
suffered from a combination of high inflation, frequent shifts of<br />
Government policy, and psychological discouragement of the private<br />
sector by Government. The result was that profi * tability declined,<br />
while uncertainty and instability reigned. Economic activity and<br />
busirness investment was drastically affected..<br />
This Government's policies are designed to reduce inflation, and by<br />
reducing inflation ensure a return to profitability and sustained<br />
economic growth, and aninprovement in the employment situation. To<br />
do this, we have brought Government spending under control. We have<br />
pursued-a responsible monetary-policy. We now have an appropriate,<br />
external policy, and we have consistently argued for wage restraint<br />
before the Arbitration Commission. There can be no doubt that we<br />
have had considerable success in pursuing our goals. The most<br />
reliable indicators show that there has been a steady reduction<br />
in the rate of inflation. Taking the deflator for major components<br />
of G. N. E. over the year to the December quarter, the rise was<br />
10.7%, much more modest than the rise of 15.6% recorded in 1975<br />
and 20.7% in 1974.<br />
This has been a more accurate reflection of gerneral price increases<br />
in re: cent times than the Consumer Price Index which has been<br />
distorted by changes in health insurance, and which only applies<br />
to prices for a limited basket of goods. The national accounts<br />
published a month ago show that in 1976 there was a return to<br />
econcmic. growth. There were significant increases in: gross non-farm<br />
/ product, </p>
<p>2-<br />
product, personal consumption, dwelling investment, business investment<br />
in plant and equipment, and exports. While unemployment is still too<br />
high, the broadest measure of employment we have, the Labour Force Survey<br />
conducted by the Commonwealth Statistician, shows that the number of<br />
employed persons has increased by 62,600 in the twelve months to February<br />
1977.<br />
To sustain the economic recovery and build on this progress, we must<br />
further reduce inflation,. and all the arms of economic policy. under the<br />
Government' s control are being brought to bear on this task. This<br />
Government is acting to establish an economic environment in which the<br />
rewards offered to business are fully commensurate with the risks they take.,<br />
Lask week, a major contribution was made to the fight against inflation and<br />
unemployment. At the Premiers Conference, the heads of the Commonwealth<br />
and State Governments unanimously called fo ' r a three month halt in price<br />
and income increases. This is one of those rare times in our history<br />
when all seven governments representing all major political parties, have<br />
reached a consensus that a major initiative is required. This is a<br />
genuinely workable plan to achieve the vital goals of reducing inflation<br />
and providing employment for all those who want to work. I welcome the<br />
many public statements by retailers and major companies that they will<br />
hold their prices for the three month period.<br />
There is a-commitment amongst Australians to defeating the twin problems<br />
of inflation and unemployment. The agreement of Government leaders at<br />
the Premiers Conference that there should be a three m. onth halt in price<br />
and income increase was a concrete expression of that commitment. if<br />
the commitment is carried through and all Government leaders are<br />
resolved to use all their moral force and authority to support it we<br />
have a unique opportunity to break the back of inflation. All the other<br />
arms of economic policy are in position to sustain the beneficial effects<br />
of a prices-incomes halt, and economic circumstances are such that excess<br />
demand is not a problem. Tax indexation and the wage increase which wage<br />
earners have just received from the Arbitmation Commission make it<br />
reasonable to ask for an incomes halt, and if we are to ask for an<br />
incomes pause, it is essential that we ask for a prices halt. I<br />
All Australians have much to gain from breaking expectations of continuing<br />
inflation. The more rapidly inflation is reduced, the faster will be the<br />
recovery in consumer demand, the greater will be the prospects of<br />
productivity increases, the sooner profit ratios will be restored to<br />
normal levels, unemployment will be reduced more rapidly. Everyone<br />
will be better off if we can halt the incessant spiral of wage and price<br />
rises. The mining industry has an important part to play in economic recovery,<br />
and this seems an opportune moment for me to make one point quite clear.<br />
The Government utterly rejects the views expressed recently by certain<br />
prominent members of the Opposition that the growth of the mining industry<br />
should be deliberately retarded. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition for<br />
instance argues that rapid development of mining is undesirable because<br />
it is highly capital intensive and drains capital away from other sectors.<br />
The reality is, as most members of this audience will be well aware, ' chat<br />
large scale mining ventures in Australia bring much of their capital<br />
from overseas. This is capital that would not otherwise be available<br />
to-Australia. The Labor Government deliberately held back mineral<br />
exploration </p>
<p>-3<br />
exploration and development. By the time they went out of office,<br />
investment in the industry had practically stopped. This Government<br />
is deter-mined to revive it. We will not penalise the mineral industries<br />
in which Australia has a comparative advantage.<br />
Since coming to office, we have removed unnecessary barriers hindering<br />
exploration companies, and where necessary, we have provided positive<br />
incentives to encourage exploration and mining activity. We have<br />
actively co-operated with the states to ensure that further exploration<br />
permits are granted over vacant prospective areas. During 1976<br />
applications were considered in respect of extensive areas iLn offshore<br />
Western Australia. Six new permits have been granted and applications<br />
in respect of three areas are currently under consideration. The<br />
Government has alopted a new approach to export controls which respects<br />
the role of private enterprise.<br />
The investment allowance introduced in the last budget has significantly<br />
encouraged new investment in the mining industry. Following the TAG<br />
report on the petroleum and mining industries, the whole taxation<br />
structure of the industry was reviewed. As a result, in recognition<br />
of the special circumstances of the minerals industry provision has been<br />
made to allow petroleum exploration expenditure to be immediately<br />
deductible against income from any source; allowable capital. expenditure<br />
on development is now deductible by a reference to a life of' a mine of<br />
not more than five years, instead of twenty five years, and all such<br />
expenditure on a petroleum field is deductible from any inccome.<br />
Allowable capital expenditure on transpoittion facilities is deductible<br />
over either twenty years or ten years at the taxpayers option. Allowable<br />
capital expenditure now includes port development not previously deductible.<br />
Crude oil from new discoveries has been freed from the $ 2 per barrel<br />
production excise, thus removing a deterrent to petroleum exploration.<br />
I understand that your industry wishes to make further submissions to<br />
the Government in relation to some of these matters. The ccal export<br />
duty is to be phased out within three years, and as a first step duty<br />
on non-coking coal has been removed and rates on coking coal reduced.<br />
The Government welcomes foreign investment because it contributes<br />
significantly to Australia's development and prosperity, and we have<br />
significantly revised the guidelines for foreign investment. Our<br />
Foreign Investment Review Board examines each foreign investment<br />
proposal to ensure that it is not contrary to the national interest.<br />
The guidelines relating to exploration are designed to give explorers<br />
maximum freedom without unnecessary Government restrictions. At the<br />
exploration stage, foreign companies are not required to obtain Australian<br />
Participation. We recognise that Australian risk capital is<br />
limited, and that requiring foreign investors to obtain Australian<br />
participation at the exploration stage could needlessly inhibit<br />
exploration. At the development stage of new mineral projects ( except<br />
uranium) involving investment of one million dollars or more our<br />
objective! is 50% Australian equity, and 50% Australian voting strength<br />
on the board. If 50% Australian equity cannot be obtained immediately,<br />
the Government may seek to increase the Australian equity to 50% within<br />
an agreed period of time. / The guidelines </p>
<p>4-<br />
The guidelines are designed to encourage working partnerships<br />
between Australian and overseas investors, with all the benefits this<br />
brings from the pooling of knowledge, capital and technology. The<br />
guidelines are being administered in a flexible manner to meet the<br />
circumstances of individual cases. Proposals which do not meet our<br />
objectives may still proceed if appropriate levels of Australian<br />
equity are simply not available. No foreign investor should feel<br />
inhib. 4.' ed from proceeding forthwith with the evaluation of investment<br />
proj ec'ts.<br />
I believe that the Foreign Investment Review Board has now set a<br />
favourable climate for increased investment in Australia. I have<br />
heard no complaints from investors about the Board's activities, and<br />
given Sir Bede Callaghan's knowledge and expertise, this is not<br />
surprising. This Government programme of reducing inflation, adopting a more<br />
liberal approach to export controls, providing taxation incentives,<br />
and welcoming foreign investment, is designed to encourage mineral<br />
exploration and development in this country, and clearly petroleum<br />
exploration needed encouragement and incentive. There are forty six<br />
offshore and seventy one onshore permits presently in force, but<br />
exploration activity remains far below that experienced prior to<br />
1973. There are however signs of improvement, and clear indications<br />
that the Government's policies are having an impact. I believe a new<br />
spirit of confidence and renewed interest in the Australian mining<br />
industry is developing. I understand your association has predicted<br />
that exploration activity will increase sharply7 in the near future.<br />
From public statements made by companies, firm intentions to invest<br />
nearly $ 2,000 million in the mining and oil field have resulted from<br />
the decisions of the past fifteen months or so. The Government is<br />
keen to see other projects such w the north-west shelf proceed, and<br />
these could well lead to the sum being more than trebled.<br />
No one knows better than yourselves the risks of petroleum exploration.<br />
No significant oil discoveries have been made since 1970, during which<br />
time 335 exploration wells have been drilled. No commercial oil<br />
discoveries have been made in the last 450 wells drilled; and the<br />
costs of drilling, seismic studies and related activity are very<br />
great indeed.<br />
Explorers also have to cope with the problems of very long lead times<br />
between exploration and receipt of income; risks in estimating reserves<br />
at the time when large capital commitments must be made; and exploration<br />
areas which are often in isolated locations, distant from both<br />
support services and potential markets. Investors and mining companies<br />
naturally look for higher than normal returns on their capital and<br />
an early return of funds invested to offset the great risks which<br />
they undertake. Those people who think that this is unreasonable<br />
should look at the facts and the figures on the risks involved in<br />
exploration.<br />
The Government recognises, and I believe the community in general<br />
realises, that when petroleum exploration is successful, the rewards<br />
must be higher than normal. The incentives the Government has provided<br />
to your industry in part reflect this recognition. They also reflect<br />
the high priority we attach to finding further significant reserves<br />
of oil and gas. / Australia has </p>
<p>Australia has greatly benefitted from a 70% self sufficiency in<br />
petroleu~ m products. But our position will soon deteriorate unless<br />
further discoveries are quickly made. I am advised that in the<br />
absence of further discoveries, the ratio of indigenous to imported<br />
crude oil supplies will be completely reversed. Some estimates<br />
indicate that the radio will be 30: 70 by around 1985.<br />
There is a clear need considerably to increase our petroleum resources<br />
to protect our balance of payments, and I would add, on strategic<br />
grounds. Unless further significant discoveries are made, our import<br />
bill for petroleum products could, at last year's prices, be in excess<br />
of two billion dollars by 1985.<br />
The rewards for successful exploration are greatly influenced by<br />
Government taxation policy and the other measures to which I have<br />
referred. But of course, the prime factor is the price received<br />
for the product. Even without any price increases for indigenous<br />
crude oil production, as we increasingly come to depend on imported<br />
supplies, the price paid by Australian refinery companies for crude<br />
oil will ineitably approach world parity over the next decade. This<br />
fact has been very much in our minds in considering the TAC report on<br />
crude oil pricing, presented on 30 September 1976. That report<br />
examined the current situation under which the prices of crude oil<br />
produced from fields discovered before 14 September 1975 are<br />
substantially below import parity prices. These prices were<br />
determined by past Governments on economic and technical considerations<br />
applying to each field. An excise levy of $ 2.00 per barrel<br />
currently applies to all crude oil produced from these fiel~ ds.<br />
Crude oil produced from fields discovered after 17 September 1975<br />
( which was not under reference to the IAC) attracts import parity prices.<br />
Crude oil produced from fields discovered after August 1976 is not<br />
subject to the excise levy. The IAG report recommended that the price<br />
for existing oil from Gippsland fields currently producing or being<br />
developed, be progressively increased towards import parity by 1980.<br />
And it :--ecomended that oil from the Barrow Island and Mooriie Fields,<br />
expansions and extensions and most known fields not yet in productionbe<br />
at import parity less the $ 2.00 per barrel levy.<br />
The IAG recommendations were generally in accord with industry<br />
submissions. The major Gippsland producers had requested that their<br />
prices be phased upward in a manner similar to that recommetnded by<br />
the Commission, and the Barrow Island and Moonie producers had<br />
requested an immediate and substantial price increase.<br />
The Government has considered the TAC report with the benefit of<br />
consultation with the Australian oil producers. As yet, no final<br />
decision has been made.<br />
The Government must have full regard for all the ramifications of<br />
its decisions on crude oil pricing. This has necessarily involved<br />
a more wide ranging analysis than was requested of the TAC, and the<br />
conside: c-ation of issues outside the TAC's charter.<br />
Broadly, we see the principal objectives of new pricing arrangements<br />
as: ensuring the economic exploitation of known reserves; encouraging<br />
new exp~ loration; minimising inflationary consequences; providing<br />
/ reasonable </p>
<p>6<br />
reasonable certainty to the industry; and minimising Government<br />
interventions in the petroleum industry. This is a substantial<br />
undertaking. Underlying it is the need to promote a vigorous exploration effort<br />
in the hope of achieving new discoveries.<br />
There will be no decision on crude oil pricing before the effects of<br />
the three month halt on wage and price increases announced on 13 April<br />
have been reviewed. When the decision is made, it will be with full<br />
regard for the impact on the consumer and on the economy generally.<br />
The risks and rewards of Australian petroleumni exploration are great.<br />
They involve not just your industry, they concern the whole country.<br />
Petroleum exploration companies have every reason to face the future<br />
confident in the knowledge that, if discoveries are made, proper rewards<br />
will not be denied to them. </p>
