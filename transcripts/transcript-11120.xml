<p>E&amp;OE………………………………………………………………………………</p>
<p><b>BARTRAM:</b></p>
<p>Joining us now we've got our Prime Minister, Mr John Howard. Thanks for joining us Mr Howard.</p>
<p><b>PRIME MINISTER:</b></p>
<p>Hello Tracey.</p>
<p><b>BARTRAM:</b></p>
<p>Good morning.</p>
<p><b>PRIME MINISTER:</b></p>
<p>How are you?</p>
<p><b>BARTRAM:</b></p>
<p>Oh very emotional I think, it's a departure for us to do a show like this but Matt and I are very passionate about the plight of the East Timorese people.</p>
<p><b>PRIME MINISTER:</b></p>
<p>Well you ought to be commended for doing the program. All Australians are concerned about this, they feel sorry for a weak, vulnerable people who looked as though they were going to have their opportunity of freedom taken away and that's the main reason why there's been such a strong response in Australia and I'm very proud of the effort of our forces. They're not only there to enforce peace and protect the UN mission but they're also there to facilitate humanitarian help, which is very important for the people of East Timor.</p>
<p><b>TILLEY:</b></p>
<p>Mr Howard there's talk this morning of like troops building up on the West Timor border. Could it get worse do you think, like it could to a war situation?</p>
<p><b>PRIME MINISTER:</b></p>
<p>Well I think we should be careful about talking of war, it's not in that situation at all. But it is a dangerous mission. I said that last Sunday when the troops went and they, when I saw them off, were quite aware of the dangers involved and we all hope and pray that they don't come to any harm. But like any operation of this kind there's lot of risk and there are a lot of rumours and counter rumours and it doesn't help for me to try and deal with each every one of them, particularly those that are best commented upon by the military commander on the ground. In fairness to him I try and avoid giving running commentaries on what's actually happening on the ground, that's his job.</p>
<p><b>BARTRAM:</b></p>
<p>Well he's a got a terribly tough job hasn't he?</p>
<p><b>PRIME MINISTER:</b></p>
<p>He's got a very tough job. He's doing it very well. I saw him on television last night, I was very proud of him and I think all Australians would have been. He answered the questions very carefully and intelligently and he shows an appreciation that he's not only got a military role but he's also got a human role and the purpose is to try and get that aid going through and to try and bring a bit of confidence back to the local population and at the same time cooperate with the Indonesian forces that are still there because some of them have been involved in what's gone on, some haven't, and in the long run it's important that this country to try and keep a relationship with the Indonesian people.</p>
<p><b>BARTRAM:</b></p>
<p>Well Mr Howard can I say that as an Australian I'm really proud that our Government, your Government has finally stepped in to do something to help the East Timorese people after 25 years.</p>
<p><b>PRIME MINISTER:</b></p>
<p>Well I appreciate that. I'm sure it was the right policy decision.</p>
<p><b>BARTRAM:</b></p>
<p>[Inaudible]</p>
<p><b>TILLEY:</b></p>
<p>It seems that everyone supports it across the board too, which is nice I guess.</p>
<p><b>PRIME MINISTER:</b></p>
<p>It is very nice.</p>
<p><b>BARTRAM:</b></p>
<p>Well Mr Howard thank you so much for talking to us this morning. Have you got anything you'd like to say to the troops, we are recording this show for our boys?</p>
<p><b>PRIME MINISTER:</b></p>
<p>Well we're very proud of you. Good luck, be careful and stick with your mates.</p>
<p><b>BARTRAM:</b></p>
<p>Thank you Mr Howard.</p>
<p><b>TILLEY:</b></p>
<p>Thanks Mr Howard.</p>
<p><b>PRIME MINISTER:</b></p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p><b>BARTRAM:</b> </p>
<p>Bye bye.</p>
<p>[ENDS]</p>
