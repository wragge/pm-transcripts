    <content><![CDATA[<p>Canberra</p>
<p>I pay tribute to my parliamentary colleague and friend, Kirsten Livermore MP, who has announced her retirement from politics after 15 years as Member for Capricornia.</p>
<p>Kirsten and I came into Parliament at the same time and have forged a strong friendship.</p>
<p>Kirsten has been a fantastic local representative and a great mate.</p>
<p>I attended Kirsten's wedding and have watched on as she has raised her two young children while her husband has been the primary carer with mum away so much of the time.</p>
<p>Kirsten has chosen to devote more time to her family and we can all understand and respect that.</p>
<p>Kirsten will continue to serve the people of Capricornia with distinction until the next election and leaves this place with the affection and respect of her colleagues.</p>
