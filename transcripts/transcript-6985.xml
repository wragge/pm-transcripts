PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 14 AUGUST 1986<br />
The Government has decided to abolish the Advisory Council for<br />
Inter-government Relations. Legislation to repeal the Act<br />
establishing ACIR will be introduced into Parliament duri'ng the<br />
Budget Sittings and the Council will be winding up its affairs in<br />
the near future.<br />
ACIR was gormed in 1976 with the object of improving co-operation<br />
between the federal, state and local levels of government through<br />
specialisod research. It was recently reviewed by a Task Group of<br />
Commonwealth officials established in September 1985. Following<br />
extensive consultations with the contributing parties to ACIR and<br />
submissions from the public, the Task Group reported in January<br />
1986 recommrending the abolition of ACIR. The Task Group found<br />
that ACIR had had limited success in improving inter-governmental<br />
relations, particularly Commonwealth/ State relations.<br />
The Government has consulted with the States, the Northern<br />
Territory and the Australian Council of Local Government<br />
Associationls on the Review and its recommendations and there is<br />
broad support for its abolition.<br />
The Governaent has under examination, in consultation with the<br />
States ard the Northern Territory, other possible means of<br />
funding research in this area. </p>
