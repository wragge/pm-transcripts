    <content><![CDATA[<p>I want to give you a brief update on the siege in Sydney.</p>
<p>I have just chaired a meeting of the National Security Committee of the Cabinet, which was briefed by Premier Baird and Andrew Scipione, the New South Wales Police Commissioner, on the unfolding situation.</p>
<p>This is a very disturbing incident.</p>
<p>It is profoundly shocking that innocent people should be held hostage by an armed person claiming political motivation.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I can say that New South Wales Police and other agencies have responded to this incident with great professionalism.</p>
<p>Throughout the day, there has been nothing but complete and total cooperation between different Governments and different agencies.</p>
<p>You can be proud of the way your police and security bodies have responded to the events of this day.</p>
<p>I think I can also commend the people of Sydney for the calmness with which they have reacted to this disturbing incident.</p>
<p>We are a free, open and generous people and today we have responded to this in character.</p>
<p>Obviously, images have been beamed around our country and around the world.</p>
<p>I have received messages of support from a number of international leaders and I thank them for their encouragement on this difficult day.</p>
<p>Yes, it has been a difficult day. Yes, it is a day which has tested us, but, so far, like Australians in all sorts of situations, we have risen to the challenge.</p>
