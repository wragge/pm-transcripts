PRIINMISET E<br />
ADDRESS BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP,<br />
LAUNCH OF NETTFORCE SYDNEY, THURSDAY, 1 SEPTEMBER<br />
1994. 1 am very glad to be here.<br />
And giad to see so many Australian companies represented here.<br />
The CEOs outnumber the trainees and, in a way, that is appropriate, because<br />
the driving force In vocational training is going to be private industry.<br />
Government can provide Initiative, funds, strategies and structures.<br />
The ommunity at large has a responsibility as I have said many times, as<br />
the Government Employment White Paper says every Australian has a<br />
responsibility, every Australian has an Interest In the outcome of the national<br />
effort. But for all that government and communities and unions must do, the engine of<br />
success will be the private sector of the economy.<br />
For once at least, the acronym is appropriate NEiTT~ FOCE.<br />
When we created It In Working Nation, we had force In mind.<br />
Not brute force.<br />
We had in a mind a body with enough skill and finesse and worldliness about it<br />
to get results.<br />
I think that is what we have.<br />
The National Employment and Training Taskforce is designed for effect.<br />
For practice rather than theory. </p>
<p>In the White Paper we decided in advance of all but a very few comparable<br />
countries that we could not leave the long-term unemployed behind.<br />
We couldn't leave them behind and still keep faith with our human and social<br />
values our national values.<br />
And we couldn't leave them behind and still claim that we observed principles<br />
of rudimentary common sense.<br />
If for rio other reason than the waste of human energy, ambition and potential, it<br />
make-s no economic or social sense to leave the long term unemployed behind.<br />
In the White Paper we also recognised somewhat in advance of many<br />
comparable countries, somewhat behind others that vocational training Is not<br />
an oprtIon for a nation In the nineties, but an Imperative.<br />
Not a might do, or a should do but a must do.<br />
We have set out to build a vocational training system to rank with the best in<br />
the world.<br />
Quite simply, we don't have a future, and the next generation will not have a<br />
future without a first class system of vocational education not, at least, the<br />
sort of future we want, the sort of future we have it In our power to earn.<br />
The people who make up NETTFOROE Bert Evans, Bill Kelty, Lindsay Fox,<br />
Ivan Deveson, Ted Wright, Joan Kimer are nothing if not practical people<br />
with practical experience.<br />
They are not people one associates with bureaucratic bottlenecks, or<br />
ideological strait-jackets.<br />
They have that In common and I know they also share a passion for their<br />
country and faith in its future.<br />
Bill Kelty and Lindsay Fox, of course, have recently re-affirmed that in their<br />
extensive study of Australia's regions a landmark study whose influence can<br />
be seen in the Regional Development policy in the White Paper.<br />
Ted Wright, of course is the Director and General Manager of the Regent Hotel<br />
which in part explains why this launch Is occurring in what otherwise might be<br />
considered a somewhat incongruous place.<br />
But the venue might be considered appropriate for another symbolic<br />
reason. </p>
<p>The Regent Is an element a very successful element in the vast mosaic of<br />
Australia's most successful growth industry.<br />
Tourism and hospitality.<br />
Tourism now employs nearly half a million Australians.<br />
No industry of the last decade has grown on such a scale. None has more<br />
potential for further growth.<br />
And none provides more dramatic evidence of the fact that in a highly<br />
competitive environment success depends on the quality of our human<br />
resources on trained, skilled r~ oil<br />
It is one of my duties today to announce the formation of a number of new<br />
industry training companies under the umbrella of NEiTTFORCE and Tourism<br />
Training Australia will be among the first of these.<br />
To some extent tourism is a model of the direction Australian industry is going<br />
towards the exploitation of our natural advantages, towards International<br />
markets, towards ever greater levels of service and efficiency, and, I am<br />
pleased to say, towards vocational training.<br />
Today I think it Is worth reminding people of the size of the task we have set<br />
ourselves. No one should underestimate the dimensions of the White Paper it is the<br />
princi pal vehicle by which the Govemment intends to reform and invigorate the<br />
Australian labour market.<br />
It is the principal means by which we intend to make this an economic recovery<br />
which reaches all Australians.<br />
I doubt if any other country has yet produced a program as comprehensive and<br />
ambitious as Working Nation.<br />
Whle a number of other countries have introduced, or are considering<br />
introducing, reforms to their labour market and training programs similar to<br />
those in the White Paper, none has integrated them into a major reform<br />
strategy. In thol plainest terms, the White Paper announced that the Government would<br />
provide funding to create 50,000 new entry level training positions by 1995-96,<br />
and find jobs under the Job Compact for over 160,000 long term unemployed<br />
people a year. </p>
<p>When they do, it would be as well to understand that training is not a welfare<br />
issue. It Is not a particularly selfless or charitable enterprise though if employers<br />
come to it with these motives no one will complain.<br />
Nor will anyone complain if they engage with this national effort out of a sense<br />
of national duty or concern for the future of our children.<br />
Success will serve those interests admirably.<br />
But the essential truth about it Is that vocational training Is a mainstream<br />
econoi issue.<br />
And it is in the interests of all us government, business, unions, communities<br />
to ongage with it.<br />
We do know that employers' reservations about hiring the long term<br />
unemployed can be overcome.<br />
Last year, of the 150,000 people who gained lobs under the JobStart program,<br />
around 70 per cent were long term unemployed.<br />
Through the JobStart program the Government is picking up a substantial<br />
proportion of an employer's wage bill while new employees prove themselves.<br />
Of NETTFORCE's various roles, the most important relates to the training<br />
wage. The training wage aims at giving the unemployed opportunities to break the<br />
cycle of their unemployment.<br />
The wiage has been set at between $ 125 and $ 333, depending on the workers<br />
experience and the skill level of the job.<br />
And we will reduce the cost to the employer further through subsidies.<br />
For employers the training wage offers labour paid at a rate which genuinely<br />
reflects productivity levels.<br />
For employees, it means avoiding being trapped in low-paid jobs forever.<br />
I cannot let pass this opportunity to urge employers to get behind the scheme.<br />
No less, I call on the unions to recognise that our intention is not the creation of<br />
a pool of cheap labour, but a pool of opportunities a vast and lasting pool<br />
for their fellow Australians. </p>
<p>Unions and employers alike must recognise that what we are doing must be<br />
done in a modem economy.<br />
If we don't do it, we will fail not just ourselves but the next generation.<br />
I know Undsay Fox and Bill Kelty have been passing on this message to their<br />
respective constituencies.<br />
I hope everyone else here today will follow suit.<br />
NElTIFORCE has been created to ensure that the training system is<br />
respornsive to industry demands and that industry is mobilised in support of this<br />
training initiative.<br />
NETTFORCE Is promoting the speedy recognition of training and will give<br />
interim authorisation of training packages to underpin the new award where<br />
there are delays.<br />
For thea vocational training to succeed, there needs to be industry involvement<br />
at all levels.<br />
NETTFORCE's new training companies can help make this happen.<br />
For those who have not heard the term before, a training company is an<br />
" Industry company", meaning it is drawn primarily from employers and employer<br />
groups and unions in various industries.<br />
Each of these training companies will meet the specific needs of their industry.<br />
They -will develop new traineeships and adapt existing traineeships to meet the<br />
NETTFORCE requirements for implementation under the National Training<br />
Wage. They will provide employers with one-stop shops to put together training and<br />
industrial packages.<br />
Among others, these companies will be established in the automotive industry,<br />
in building and construction, manufacturing and engineering, the timber<br />
Industry, retail, warehousing, electrical and electronic, media, arts and<br />
enterltainment and of course tourism and hospitality.<br />
Obviously, there are a great many people here who deserve our<br />
congratulations for the progress that has been made so far.<br />
From the Governments viewpoint, it is very gratifying. The indications are that<br />
the confidence in Australian employers and unions on which these programs<br />
have been built will be vindicated. </p>
<p>But none of us should be in any doubt that the story has just begun.<br />
As I said at the beginning, so much depends on employers.<br />
In a sense, the programs now in place provide a measure of compensation for<br />
this. But in any event, it is in employers' own interests to take steps now to avoid<br />
skill shortages which will Increase their costs and hold back their growth.<br />
Equally, as a nation, if we are to improve our standard of living and maintain<br />
our economic growth without inflation, we need to continually improve<br />
productivity and pivotal to that is an investment in skills.<br />
All of us here today have taken up that challenge the members of<br />
NETTFORCE, the employers, the union representatives and not least the<br />
young trainees.<br />
For that I want to thank you all.<br />
You have engaged with a great national undertaking and future generations of<br />
Australians will have reason to thank you for it.<br />
So It is with great pleasure and pride that I now officially launch NETTFORCE.<br />
ENDS </p>
