FOR PRESS. ( Statement by the Minister for Trade, Mr. John McEwen, M. P.)<br />
Mr. MoEwen said today that he had a sympathetic<br />
understanding of the serious problem revealed in President Kennedy's<br />
message to the United States Congress proposing curtailment of the<br />
production of food and other agricultural products. The President<br />
indicated that this curtailment would need to be either through an<br />
arbitrary reduction in production or, indirectly, through reduced<br />
governmental price supports.<br />
Mr. McEwen said that the United States dilemma was<br />
the production of many commodities, through from wheat to cotton,<br />
much in excess of the home demand and in excess of commercial export<br />
opportunities. This has come about through governmental price support.<br />
Not only was this a financial problem for the United<br />
States Administration, but the great surpluses remaining unsold<br />
represented a serious factor overlying international commercial trade<br />
in these commodities.<br />
0 ~ Mr. McElwen said that, while understanding the United<br />
States dilemma, he thought it would be a matter of even greater<br />
concern if the richer, highly developed countries had to<br />
deliberately curtail agricultural production when so many in<br />
underdeveloped countries had insufficient food or clothing.<br />
Mr. McEiwen said he believed the Western World could<br />
make a vital contribution to the needs of great masses of people in<br />
underdeveloped countries by making foodstuffs and some other<br />
essential commodities available on less than commercial terms to the<br />
hungry people and the needy nations, This would be a factor in<br />
sustaining political stability ond offsetting the blandishments of<br />
Communist countries in the underdeveloped countries.<br />
Mr. Mc1lwen said he had always advocated a solution<br />
of commodity problems on a world-wide basis. In cases where </p>
<p>a .2.<br />
surpluses in the wealthy agricultural countries went side by side<br />
with need in underdeveloped countries, it should be possible to make a<br />
further significant contribution towards meeting this need, while<br />
farmers still received overall a satisfactory price for their produce.<br />
Mr. McEwen said that he believed that this could be<br />
achieved if farmers receiLved a more realistic price for what they sold<br />
for consumption within the areas of high living standards. If in<br />
such countries, ranging from Australia, Argentina, United States,<br />
France and the United Kingdom, which are all great food producers,<br />
the Governments were relieved of the great burden of price support<br />
of their farmers, these Governments could devote the same funds<br />
towards supply of food and materials at less than commercial prices.<br />
Further, he belie-\ ed that if farmers in these producing<br />
6countries received, for wihat they exported to Europe and the United<br />
StaZtes and high living standard countries, the same price as was<br />
received by their local producers for the same products the<br />
exporting farmers could, and he bIelieved would be prepared to sell<br />
Wo underdeveloped countries at something less than the price received<br />
from high standard of living countries.<br />
Such an arrangement would establish a most enduring<br />
basis of help for the needy people, and overall, be in the interests<br />
of the farmers. The whole Western World would gain a moral and diplomatic<br />
diplomatic uplift and the costs would be more equitably borne<br />
among the Western Powers than had been the case in recent years.<br />
Mr, McEwen said that he thought the greatest<br />
opportunity to examine such thinking could come about when the<br />
special meeting of certain G. A. T. T. countries, including Australia,<br />
~ occurred in Geneva in a couple of weeks' time to consider grains,<br />
particularly wheat, on the initiative of a French proposal.<br />
