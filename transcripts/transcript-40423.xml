    <content><![CDATA[<p>This week I will join Leaders of the world’s largest advanced and emerging economies in Hangzhou, China for the 2016 G20 Leaders’ Summit (4-5 September 2016).</p>
<p>I am travelling with a clear and simple objective: to advance reforms that will help the Australian economy grow and create more jobs.</p>
<p>Our Summit takes place at a time of sluggish global growth and heightened uncertainty, including many people feeling left behind by globalisation.</p>
<p>In Hangzhou, G20 Leaders will be determined to deliver actions that will lift growth and create jobs, as well as ensuring the benefits of economic growth are broadly shared.</p>
<p>I welcome the Hangzhou agenda for spurring innovation, trade and other structural reforms to boost global growth. Australia stands ready to play our part supporting new sources of growth, including harnessing the opportunities of the digital economy in the 21st century.</p>
<p>Strengthening global economic integrity is also at the forefront of our efforts, particularly enhancing tax transparency, which Australia initiated in Brisbane. Australia is taking a leading role in efforts to end corruption and stop dishonest finance flows.</p>
<p>I am pleased Senator the Hon Mathias Cormann, Minister for Finance, will accompany me to the premier forum for global economic cooperation and prosperity.</p>
