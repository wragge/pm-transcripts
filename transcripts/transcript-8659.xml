TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON PJ KEATING MP,<br />
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS, NATIONAL PRESS CLUB,<br />
SEPTEMBER 1992<br />
E OE PROOF COPY<br />
Q: Don Woolford Prime Minister. According to figures released on Friday by<br />
the Japanese Embassy, Australian direct investment in Japan amounts to<br />
only 0.8 per cent of Australia's total overseas investment. I'd like to ask if<br />
you arc happy about thcse figures and if you believe that to any extent at all<br />
they are attributable to constraints thc Japanese put on our investment and if<br />
so, will you be taking that up in Tokyo next week?<br />
PM: Don, it's not on the theme of ' Fighthack' and I'd prefer the question was, but<br />
I'm happy to answer it. The issue is that Australia runs a huge trade surplus,<br />
with Japan and thank God it does because onc wouldn't know where our<br />
balance of paymecnts would be without it, and as well as that they've been a<br />
source of savings in capital to fund our currcnt account deficit and to take<br />
large slabs of equity in Australia. And if Australiani businesses want market<br />
acccss in Japan they've got to do the hard grinding work in a culture which<br />
is somewhat diffcrcnt to Australia to create that market access.<br />
But Australians don't want their leadcrs needlessly putting off our major<br />
trading partner. I notice Dr Hewson saying yesterday, I'll stick up for<br />
Australia. It's not sticking up for Australia, punching in the nose the country<br />
with which we enjoy the largest trade surplus, that's not being good to<br />
Australia, that's not bcing loyal to Australian interests, it's being absurd, it's<br />
being immature. And I think Australians understand that we've developed<br />
an important basis of trade with Japan and that they want that -trad ' e<br />
relationship treated properly. That's not to say you don't argue for market<br />
access. Tlhis Govermecnt has beeni arguing for it and getting it for a long </p>
<p>time in minerals, in agricultural products, in meat, but Dr H-ewson has<br />
been saying we've been letting the Japanese into Australia for investment<br />
indeed we have. Who else is going to provide the capital? But would he<br />
now say that we've done the Japanese a favour taking hotels off our hands at<br />
$ 600 million which today are worth $ 400 million? Docs he regard that as<br />
the sort of favour thcy should thank us for? These are all the comments of<br />
someone who has basically wanted to be noticed, to get himself out of a<br />
terrible problem with the National Party, that is, he has a zero tariff on sugar<br />
and he'll wipe out the north Queensland sugar industry. And in the middle<br />
of pressure on that, he decided to divert the attention by attacking the<br />
Japanese. You notice the Japanese Embassy has stood its ground now over<br />
the weekend and for a couple of days, and they're entitled not to have their<br />
position misrepresented. It's doing Australia no favour behaving<br />
immaturely, stamping your foot when you've got a very mature relationship,<br />
and I hope to develop that relationship further when I go to Japan. I'm not<br />
going for any particular purpose, for any particular initiative, but simply to<br />
advance our understanding as trading economies and societies further.<br />
0: Maxine McKew, ABC Radio current affairs. On a similar theme, in the<br />
same way that President Bush is drawing international condemnation for<br />
decisions such as extending the Export Enhancement Program and the sale<br />
of F15 Fighters to Taiwan, at home thc same decisions are drawing<br />
domestic applause. Do you not think then that perhaps similarly ! Dr Hewson<br />
might be touching a domestic nerve with his comments about acccss to<br />
Japan?<br />
PM: You mean in the United States or in Japan?<br />
MM: No, here.<br />
PM: In Australia?<br />
MM Yes.<br />
PM: I don't think so, I think Australians are quite wise about these things, they<br />
know that Australia has had to trade its way in the world, they know it's<br />
been difficult for us, they know wc've now made a very large transition.<br />
This year for thc first year in our history we exported more manufactures<br />
than we did agricultural exports or mineral exports. They know that this<br />
Government has made this transition. That is, we've taken Australia from<br />
the Stone Age, without making a pun, to the age that is a Hlew. sonfloward<br />
stone age where we basically went backwards in manufactured exports to </p>
<p>a stage where we're now seeing manufactured exports being greater than<br />
rural and mining exports. They know that's all hard tack, they've watched<br />
those balance of payment figures now at least for six or seven years, at least<br />
since the terms of trade crisis of 1986, and I don't think they take lightly to<br />
silly people doing silly things, and Dr Hewson going on as he did,<br />
needlesly attacking the one market where we enjoy a huge trade surplus, is<br />
no good for him, no good for us, no good for Australia and I don't think it<br />
rings any chords anywhere.<br />
Q: Dennis Grant, Prime Minister, from the Seven Network, pay television if I<br />
might.<br />
PM: You guys have given the GST a sleigh ride for now nearly a year, there ' s<br />
becn no real critical analysis of it by the press gallery and even when the<br />
Government gets up to critically attack it, we're on to pay television.<br />
DG: Thanks Prime Minister, pay television, pay television then.<br />
PM: It takes some dexterity to shift subjects, I know that.<br />
DG: What is your view of a mandated role for the ABC in pay television, what of<br />
your previous position that the ABC should bc in the queue likc everyone<br />
else?<br />
PM: This question is not encouraging me to put Channel Seven in the queue, I<br />
can tell you that. These arc matters for discussion, the Govermecnt came up<br />
with a good model for pay television. In the big sweep of events, in the big<br />
sweep of subjects this is not again like a GST, a first order subject, certainly<br />
a subordinate order subject. But that said, we'rc hetter to get it right than<br />
wrong. And I don't want to see Australia's pay television system shanghaied<br />
to an inferior technology: that is I don't want to sce the satellite being the<br />
sole delivery system of pay television. Not when we'rc seeing your sponsor,<br />
Telecom, extending its fibre optic network across the country in a mile<br />
stone investment decision in the ' 80s, which gives you the capacity to speak<br />
back as well as to be spokcn to, that's for interactive services, I don't want to<br />
see us simply relying on the satellite alone. As far as the ABC is concerned,<br />
I think the ABC has a real question to ask itself whether, if it's sidelined a%<br />
a pay TV operator, it doesn't see its frcc to air charter diminish. I think that<br />
is a very great possibility and the ABC needs to think about that, and the<br />
ABC Board needs to think about that. </p>
<p>Q: Stephen Spencer, Macquarie News, Prime Minister with, thankfully, a<br />
question about ' Fighiback'. -Many of your back benchers would like to see<br />
you announce a 12-18 month tariff pause to further underline the<br />
differences between you and the Opposition you've been making known in<br />
re~ nt months. Is that somcthing you're likely to adopt before the ncxt<br />
election or are you determined to stick to your previously announced tariff<br />
policy?<br />
PM: We've been the only government that has reduced tariffs in Australia.<br />
Tariffs actually went up when Dr Hewson was advising Mr Howard. Under<br />
the Fraser governmient tariffs rose, protection rose. The only governments<br />
that have reduced tariff protection in Australia have been Labor<br />
Governments; the Whitlam government in 1973-74 reduced tariffs by<br />
per cent, they then rose under the Frascr government, under the advice of Dr<br />
Hewson when he was advising them. This Government has studiously and<br />
carefully put into place a discussion with Australian business and unions on<br />
a phased reduction in tariffs. The big program ' 88-' 92 was completed on<br />
July I this year where everything above 15 per cent went to 15, that's every<br />
tariff above 15, that's the ones in the 50 and 60 per cents, went to 15 and<br />
everything between 15 and 10 wcnt to 10. We're now phasing the 15 and<br />
to 5 by 1996 and 2000. And for the plant areas we've got 15 per cent for<br />
cars and 25 per cent for certain areas of textile, clothing and footwear. We<br />
think we've got it about right, and, being serious ahout it, we're not about to<br />
be buffeted by again the theoretical prescriptions of Dr Hewson, who did<br />
not seek to join the consensus with thc Government and adopt the<br />
Government's tariff policies, its phasedowns and endpoints, and say this<br />
Government has done what we would never have done, it's done something<br />
good for Australia, it's taken on a sensible thing that will actually stick, we<br />
will maintain thc consensus, adopt the Government's phase downs and end<br />
points. No, no he has a cheap onc up, we'll all go to zero. And we're<br />
supposed to say, my God isn't that tough, isn't that strong where in truth it's<br />
just silly and it is disruptive and that's why the motor vehicle industry and<br />
other industries arc now so put out about it. And well they might be, the<br />
whole city of Adelaide is put at risk by Dr Hewson's policy, a large part of<br />
the state of Victoria is put at risk by Dr Hcwson's policies. So we've made<br />
careful judgements about it in the 1980s and again in 1991 when we<br />
announced the ' 92, ' 96, 2000 phasedowns. So they are all there and we think<br />
wc'vc got the judgements pretty right.<br />
Q: Keiren McLconard, Network Radio, Prime Minister, you spent a lot of your<br />
speech bucketing ' Fightback' though you do admit it will be alive at least<br />
until the next election. The Coalition admits that they haven't yct sold </p>
<p>' Fightback' that it is still causing concern and trepidation in the community.<br />
Given that they're not the underdog going into the election and you are, isn't<br />
it quite possible that Australians want to take anything except a Keating<br />
Government for three years and is it also possible that you won't be looking<br />
to try selling anything positive to the community until the economy picks<br />
up, that's your only strategy on positives?<br />
PM: Kieren it's only that colour co-ordination of yours and that wonderful hairdo<br />
that encourages me into giving you a very nice reply because you always<br />
put the most charming questions, and that is that I can't see the Australian<br />
public being at all attracted to a policy which says we will take $ 27 billion<br />
off you and we'll give $ 26 billion back, but it will be largely going to<br />
removing other taxes and replacing them. And the result of that is to add 6-<br />
7 percentage points to inflation and for all of that they then go and pay for<br />
private health insurance, they have their tariffs cut to zcro and thcy have<br />
industrial confrontation. That's basically what ' Fightback' is it's a crude<br />
tax switch which taxes expenditure rather than income and which basically<br />
cuts tariffs to zero which makes people pay for their private health insurance<br />
and is generally socially upsetting. Now, contrast that with the<br />
Government's change over the ' 80s to a more competitive country, contrast<br />
that with our evolutionary though radical changes to the labour market, with<br />
low inflation, with exports rocketing along, with a strong trade surplus and<br />
growing, contrast all that with low inflation in the ' 90s and say give all that<br />
up, see the social net destroyed, see Medicare destroyed, see people tipped<br />
off unemployment benefits after nine months as Dr T-rcwson proposes, see<br />
the social security program knocked about, see all these things occur, but.<br />
we're so enamoured of Fightback with its consumption tax that we take that.<br />
I don't think thcy will Keiren, and that's the point. And that's why I think<br />
that upon mature reflection that won't happen. Now, I saw your Mother and<br />
Father over the weekend in Bathurst and they told mc that you would ask<br />
me a nice question and I wanted to thank you for it.<br />
Q: Lyndal Curtis, radio 2UE ' and 3AW Mr Keating, from thc consumption tax<br />
onto Labor's taxes, was the report in today's Australian correct that you and<br />
John Dawkins pulled out details of your tax increases from thc Budget? If<br />
so was it a bad move considering the scare campaign the Opposition has<br />
been running against it?<br />
PM: No, the story is not correct. At any rate it is a bit academic because<br />
tomorrow the Treasurer will be making a statcment and introducing<br />
legislation on this very topic. The fact is not only was thc story not<br />
withdrawn, but they werc left. explicitly in the Budget papers. That is, the </p>
<p>measures that the Government might consider were actually announced in<br />
the Budget papers,. but the notion that details had been considered by the<br />
revenue committee and adopted to be then withdrawn was wrong, and I<br />
don't know whether Laura is here, but shc was told it was wrong but she still<br />
wrote it. One little chinik of it is right, but the general thread of the story is<br />
not right. That is, the Government did announce that it was looking at these<br />
things, the revenue committee never considered the prescribed payments<br />
system or the WST, never. It did consider the FB3T but no decision was<br />
taken as to its introduction leaving, that if it were desirable, to the Prime<br />
Minister, myself, and the Treasurer. So wc then put in the appropriate text<br />
saying we would consider some of these measures and if we thought it<br />
necessary at a later stage adopt them or otherwise and wc have stayed true<br />
to form. But you compare that with Dr H-ewson, the sleight of hand, here he<br />
is the other day saying we'll consider in office what is the nature of the<br />
charges for motor vehicles. In other words, he has a $ 4.5 billion set of<br />
charges for roads which he is politely saying he will consider in office. And<br />
he has also said on the record in Septcmber that charges ought to bc levied<br />
on thc basis of mass of distance. So it is either going to come as a<br />
registration fcc or as a tachymeter charge on trucks and on cars, and it is<br />
huge. The fact of the matter is that hc has to he as accountable as we have,<br />
but as always we are always thc accountable ones. As I have made the point<br />
to you before it was Novcmber last since any of you insisted him doing a<br />
press conference in Canberra, and as a result he is quite happy to deal with<br />
the fire engine chasers and the rest where he knows there is going to be no<br />
follow up questions. And on this qucstion there had ought to be follow up<br />
questions, that is who and how, how will the $ 4.5 billion be levied and who<br />
will pay for it?<br />
0: Bruce Juddery, freelance, Prime Minister. You deplore Dr Hcwson's<br />
penchant for experimentation of proposals. As I recall, as Treasurer and<br />
now as Prime Minister, you committed yourself to an accord with the<br />
Unions which effectively has emasculated the Government's capacity for<br />
intelligently using fiscal policy to manage the economy, you have got<br />
yourself locked into a situation, up until a year ago or so, where all you had<br />
going for you was control of interest rates and wc seem to be in a pretty<br />
pickle as a result of all that. When did you develop this abhorrence for<br />
experimentation, Prime Minister?<br />
PM: Bruce, occasionally you ask one that goes right over the shoulder, this one is<br />
one of those. The fact is the Government has had total flexibility in policy.<br />
Let me explain to you you write for a business magazine, this will be of<br />
interest to your editor these arc the points; the first is that fiscal policy was </p>
<p>so tight in the 1980s we produced $ 20 odd billion worth of surpluses. That<br />
gave us the freedom to produce deficit-, is we needed to, which thc United<br />
States does not have, in US Budget deficit% now sitting at about 6 per cent<br />
of GDP and the Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, Mr Greenspan,<br />
told an audience in Wyoming three weeks ago fiscal policy in America can<br />
not be used to stimulate the economy, it has run its race.<br />
In this country it can be used, it is heing used now. Why? Because of what<br />
we did in the 1980s. Total flexibility on fiscal policy.<br />
On monetary policy we have had 13 reductions in interest rates since 1990,<br />
total flexibility there.<br />
And on wages, flexibility there, we are talking again about another wages<br />
system where three quarters of the people adjusted are not going to be in the<br />
centralised system, and yet we are seeing enterprise deals been done with<br />
very low costs and low inflation portents about them.<br />
So on wages, fiscal and monetary policy we have flexibility and we are<br />
using it. What would Dr Hewson have? He wants no conversation with the<br />
unions, no Accord, no flexibility on wages.<br />
On monetary policy he would only stick intcrcst rates up because the<br />
consumption tax would add to inflation and therefore the inflation effect<br />
would obviously climb into interest rates.<br />
And on fiscal policy he would be left with the same starting points we arc<br />
left with. That is wc are contemplating changes to deal with the starting<br />
point deficit in ' 94-' 95 and ' 95-' 96 so the samc problem would apply to him<br />
werc he to be the Government. That is, because revenue declined by $ S<br />
billion between June and August this year, that $ 5 billion dccl ines at the<br />
starting point out therc at ' 94-' 95 and ' 95-' 96. If it is a problem for us it is a<br />
similar problem for Dr H-cwson. What's hc going to do about it? Tomorrow<br />
we are going to announce measures which will improve that in ' 95-96.<br />
What is he going to announce? Or does hc get let off again, does he get let<br />
off again, the no explainer? This reply you get from him and Mr Rcith ' it<br />
is in Fightback read it' as if those of you are deficient and you have not<br />
been able to read the thing. The truth is it is not in Fightback, and this guy<br />
is not accountable and the starting point problems of ' 94-' 95, t95-'. 96 would<br />
be just as much his as ours wcre he to bc the Government but he wouldn't<br />
have the flexibility on monetary policy and on wages policy that we have<br />
because he has no truck with an Accord and no agreement with the unions. </p>
<p>So the confrontation is simply him saying we will kick you off awards,<br />
your holiday pay, your rates of pay and conditions will all go, you will fall<br />
out of the system, you have got to make a contract with your employer. So<br />
the employee gets a phone call from the managers office come in you<br />
have got to make a contract with us and the person says, I am not making a<br />
contract with you, I have got an award. You make a contract or you are out.<br />
Now that is going to produce a lot of confrontation. That's exactly what<br />
some of the senior executives of this country have been saying the last three<br />
week-, we don't want this confrontation.<br />
We are now moving to a harmonious change in our industrial relations<br />
systemn, a productive change to enterprise bargaining, we don't want<br />
confrontation now and that's why Dr Hcwson's policies arc so out of kelta<br />
with what is happening in Australia and thc mood of this country and its<br />
needs.<br />
Q: Glenn Milne from the Australian, Prime Minister. Two points; onc, the first<br />
a clarification. Your previous answer on tariff policy, was that a yes or a<br />
no? Are you ruling out any change to either the timetabling of tariff<br />
reductions under your Government or the pause<br />
PM: Glenn, we have made that clear in the past where we stand. We didn't think<br />
about these things quickly or in an opportunist way, they were put together<br />
carefully and we announced them carefully, and when a lot of people were<br />
not awarc of all these issues the Government was doing a lot of careful,<br />
consultative work with industry in putting those endpoints together. I was<br />
one of them, John Button, myself, others making sure that the 15 per ccnt<br />
end point for cars could be lived with. We belicve they can.<br />
Q: And the second question, you raise doubts in the presentation of Fightback<br />
in your speech about the economic value ot' incomc tax cuts. Why then did<br />
you offer your own income tax cuts as part of the One Nation statement?<br />
PM: No I didn't. What I am saying is all of this is supposedly to provide income<br />
tax cuts, this whole nasty bag of tricks in Fightback, thc joy is supposed to<br />
be a 30 per cent rate at $ 20, 700. All I am making clear is that the<br />
Government will be doing a 30 per cent ratc at $ 20,700 with no<br />
consiumption tax.<br />
That is, we will be able to put into place, becausc of the fiscal policy we<br />
have put there, tax cuts without a consumption tax and, in macroeconomic </p>
<p>9<br />
terms, an inflationary, disruptive change to the economy. That was always a<br />
possibility, and why is it a possibility? Because of the strength of Labor's<br />
fiscal policy in the ' 80s, because of the underlying strength of the outlays.<br />
That is, because the outlays were reined in in the ' 80s we have the fiscal<br />
flexibility to do these things. But what then is the point of having a very<br />
costly and complicated tax switch which is going to hurt many Australians,<br />
a socially disruptive change to provide the tax cuts which the Government<br />
itself will provide with no consumption tax.<br />
Thank you very much.<br />
