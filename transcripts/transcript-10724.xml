    <content><![CDATA[<p>FAINE: </p>
<p>John Howard, the Prime Minister of Australia good morning to you</p>
<p>   and welcome to 3LO.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER: </p>
<p>Good morning, how are you, very good to be here.</p>
<p>FAINE: </p>
<p>I am exceptionally well. US President, Bill Clinton, has interrupted</p>
<p>   his holidays to report to the nation on a military strike against</p>
<p>   terrorist bases in Afghanistan and Sudan. You would support the</p>
<p>   American action 100% Prime Minister I presume?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>My advice is that the strike was based upon very strong, I think</p>
<p>   he may have used the expression overwhelmingly or highly persuasive,</p>
<p>   evidence that the targets against which the strikes were made were,</p>
<p>   in fact, operational bases or headquarters of the people responsible</p>
<p>   for the embassy outrages in Kenya and Tanzania. Now, if that is</p>
<p>   the case then the Americans are quite justified in doing what they</p>
<p>   have done. Now, I don't, at this stage, have a separate intelligence</p>
<p>   briefing but if that is the case then the American action is justified.</p>
<p>   Any country is entitled to act in self-defence and to embark upon</p>
<p>   a retaliatory strike where there is a clear attack upon its own</p>
<p>   citizens. And the bomb outrages in those two African countries,</p>
<p>   more than a week ago, were indiscriminate acts of murder and terrorism.</p>
<p>   They were clearly directed against United States citizens. Tragically</p>
<p>   also they involved the lives of Kenyan and Tanzanian citizens, so</p>
<p>   it wasn't only the Americans who suffered. In those circumstances</p>
<p>   I think any country is entitled to take retaliatory action and that</p>
<p>   is what the Americans have done. </p>
<p>FAINE:</p>
<p>There is a risk of escalation, of course, and a constant [inaudible].</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, there is always a risk if you do anything, but the alternative</p>
<p>   to doing nothing is to allow terrorism to succeed and no self-respecting</p>
<p>   country, whether it is the most powerful military country in the</p>
<p>   world, the United States, or indeed any other country can send a</p>
<p>   signal to the murderers and the terrorists of the world that they</p>
<p>   can bomb and maim and murder at will. Now it is difficult, we all</p>
<p>   wish that strikes of this kind were not necessary. I don't</p>
<p>   enjoy it, I don't think anybody does. Inevitably other people</p>
<p>   can be killed and injured and maimed. I think the whole circumstance</p>
<p>   is appalling but you have got to remember where it started and the</p>
<p>   Americans have been subjected to a large number of indiscriminate</p>
<p>   attacks and they have a perfect right to defend themselves and if</p>
<p>   they don't defend themselves, if they don't send a signal</p>
<p>   to terrorists around the world, if they are not prepared to lie</p>
<p>   down and cop it then they are inviting not only a loss of face in</p>
<p>   their world leadership but they are also inviting a repetition of</p>
<p>   the appalling deeds that were committed 10 days ago. The response</p>
<p>   to terrorism is never to facilitate the objectives of the terrorists.</p>
<p>   The same thing applies in Northern Ireland where the first real</p>
<p>   hope of peace for 30 years has obviously been subjected to the most</p>
<p>   violent sabotage attempt by the bomb that was detonated in Omagh.</p>
<p>   Now, that was an appalling deed. The best response to that, of course,</p>
<p>   is not only to catch the criminals responsible for it but also for</p>
<p>   those men and women of goodwill on both the Catholic and the Protestant</p>
<p>   side in Northern Ireland to press ahead with the peace process.</p>
<p>   And the most encouraging thing to me out of what has happened in</p>
<p>   Northern Ireland in a terrible event - dreadful - is that both sides</p>
<p>   of the debate in Northern Ireland are saying we have to still go</p>
<p>   ahead with the peace process. And I applaud both the British and</p>
<p>   the Irish Prime Ministers for having done that.</p>
<p>FAINE:</p>
<p>Proof that the terrorists are wrong. On the domestic front Prime</p>
<p>   Minister, on the selling of the Goods and Services tax and at the</p>
<p>   moment it seems it's a bit like wrestling with an octopus.</p>
<p>   You nail one arm down and suddenly another tentacle curls up and</p>
<p>   grabs you by the throat.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well look, can I just say a couple of things about the explanation</p>
<p>   of the tax plan. I think it has gone very well. This is a gutsy,</p>
<p>   fair plan to fix the tax system that everybody knows needs fixing.</p>
<p>   I mean everybody knows we need tax reform and everybody knows that</p>
<p>   you can't have tax relief without tax reform. You can't</p>
<p>   say to people: we'll give you a tax cut but we won't do</p>
<p>   anything to try and fix the tax system. Now what we have had the</p>
<p>   courage to do is to say to the Australian public: we are going to</p>
<p>   put forward a comprehensive plan to fix the taxation system. Now,</p>
<p>   you are gong to have people out there trying, not in the name of</p>
<p>   fairness, really in the name of political advantage, like the ACTU</p>
<p>   and sections of the Labor Party and some people in other sectors</p>
<p>   who have personal political axes to grind.....</p>
<p>FAINE:</p>
<p>The church?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, no, well I am glad you said the churches because buried away</p>
<p>   on page four, astonishingly page four of The Australian at the bottom</p>
<p>   of an article on the attitude of the churches and the welfare sector</p>
<p>   to the GST is the following statement. "There is no one Catholic</p>
<p>   position on an issue as complex as taxation", he said. "Tax</p>
<p>   reform is needed, the system is inequitable and my personal point</p>
<p>   is somehow the tax base has got to be broadened if we are going</p>
<p>   to have enough money to provide the welfare services that are needed</p>
<p>   in a modern, civilised society." Now they were the words of</p>
<p>   Archbishop George Pell the Catholic Archbishop of Melbourne and</p>
<p>   I think they are a very accurate statement. Of course there is no</p>
<p>   one Catholic position. There's no one Christian position, people</p>
<p>   of goodwill will have different views. And what George Pell has</p>
<p>   done, what his grace has done is to nail, with his great authority</p>
<p>   as the senior Catholic prelate of this city, nail with his authority</p>
<p>   the idea that there is a single Catholic position in opposition</p>
<p>   or indeed in support of the Government's tax reform plan. And</p>
<p>   I'll go further, the Reverend Tim Costello of the Baptist church</p>
<p>   last night on the 7:30 Report widely praised the Government's</p>
<p>   plan. There are sections of the Salvation Army apparently and there</p>
<p>   is no organisation in Australia more admired for the work it does</p>
<p>   for the downtrodden and the poor in this country. I mean what they</p>
<p>   are saying, they are questioning the capacity of ACOSS in the statement</p>
<p>   it made a couple of days ago to speak for all sections of the welfare</p>
<p>   sector. Now, the point I am simply making is that there is no one</p>
<p>   single church position. Some church men and women are against the</p>
<p>   Government's plan. Some church men and women are in favour</p>
<p>   of it but it is absolutely wrong, as the Catholic Archbishop of</p>
<p>   Melbourne has made quite clear, for people to run around representing</p>
<p>   one position as the one true Catholic or Christian position. There</p>
<p>   is none, and I think as this debate goes on you will have men and</p>
<p>   women of goodwill from the churches arguing the toss and that is</p>
<p>   as it should be. I do not want to see a situation, I don't</p>
<p>   think anybody does, where the Catholic church or the Anglican church</p>
<p>   or the Uniting church is seen as sort of saying: well this is the</p>
<p>   churches point of view and unless you support it you are disobeying</p>
<p>   the church. I'm sure nobody wants that.</p>
<p>FAINE:</p>
<p>But it's not just the welfare lobby and the churches, business</p>
<p>   representatives also are now starting to say they are not sure the</p>
<p>   package offers them everything that they were promised. The Australian</p>
<p>   Business Chamber and the Heavy Engineering Manufacturers' Association</p>
<p>   have said they don't accept that business will be better off</p>
<p>   with a lower business tax rate. </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>But we are not in the business, John, of placating business on</p>
<p>   everything.</p>
<p>FAINE:</p>
<p>But you can end up with no one happy.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>No, no, no, you will end up with the national interest served.</p>
<p>   And the purpose of this tax plan is to strengthen Australia. And</p>
<p>   the biggest feature of this tax plan, the most commendable feature</p>
<p>   of this tax reform plan, is that it is good overall for the Australian</p>
<p>   economy. And why it is good is that it reduces the costs of producing</p>
<p>   things in this country. Now, it may not suit in all its particularity</p>
<p>   one section of the business community. One section of the business</p>
<p>   community thinks that the best way to have taxation arrangements</p>
<p>   is to have, say, depreciation. Another section of the business community,</p>
<p>   which is not in manufacturing but which is in service industries,</p>
<p>   says that it would rather have in lieu of depreciation allowances,</p>
<p>   which they can't utilise, they'd rather have a lower tax</p>
<p>   rate. So what we have said is that we will get the business community</p>
<p>   together under the chairmanship of John Ralph, the former Chairman</p>
<p>   of CRA, to work together over the next 18 months to determine what</p>
<p>   is the best outcome. Now, we have got 18 months or more to do that.</p>
<p>   Now, we made this clear, we made this clear last Thursday, we said</p>
<p>   last Thursday that we would announce a number of decisions affecting</p>
<p>   the business community. As to the rest there would be a process</p>
<p>   of review and consultation shared by Mr Ralph.....</p>
<p>FAINE:</p>
<p>You don't have 18 months before you go to the people though,</p>
<p>   you have got a matter of weeks or months before......</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well we are going to the people with a plan that involves a $13</p>
<p>   billion reduction in personal income tax, a plan that will reduce</p>
<p>   business operating cost by $10.5 billion. It will provide the most</p>
<p>   effective far-reaching reform of the fuel tax system in this country,</p>
<p>   which will be of enormous benefit to the rural sector because this</p>
<p>   is a big country. And we are also going to take $4.5 billion of</p>
<p>   costs off the backs of the export sector. The most compellingly</p>
<p>   attractive feature of this package is that it reduces the cost of</p>
<p>   doing business in this country and will, therefore, generate more</p>
<p>   jobs and is, therefore, very good overall for the Australian economy.</p>
<p>   So, I don't express any surprise at all that individual sections</p>
<p>   are saying: well look, from our personal point of view we would</p>
<p>   have rather you had gone further here or not so far here. But what</p>
<p>   really matters is out there the Australian community is getting</p>
<p>   the tax reform it's desperately needed for 20 years. </p>
<p>FAINE:</p>
<p>You'll listen to what the business community say, you'll</p>
<p>   listen to what the welfare and church groups have to say, you'll</p>
<p>   listen to what the aged care people have to say, you'll take</p>
<p>   all their needs into account? Because if you do John Hewson in the</p>
<p>   Financial Review today says that your tax reform package is as good</p>
<p>   as dead.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well look leave John Hewson out of it. I think....we'll just</p>
<p>   leave....I don't intend to comment on his views. We have....</p>
<p>FAINE:</p>
<p>But his advice is if you tinker with it then you end up having</p>
<p>   a message that you can't sell.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>.....Just let me finish please. We have laid down a plan. We said</p>
<p>   in that plan that in relation to certain things we would consult</p>
<p>   people. For example, the structure of the business tax system, we</p>
<p>   said we would consult about that and we will do that. Obviously</p>
<p>   there are areas in a plan like this where, from the very beginning,</p>
<p>   you say you are prepared to engage in fine tuning. But that doesn't</p>
<p>   mean that you are going to make major changes. I mean the whole</p>
<p>   question, for example, of the GST on drugs, medicines, we made it</p>
<p>   perfectly clear that prescription ones were GST free. We said in</p>
<p>   relation to the non-prescription ones that there was obviously a</p>
<p>   disposition to have a process of consultation over the next couple</p>
<p>   of years and I think that is a very sensible thing to do. I mean</p>
<p>   it seems that you are dammed if you do and you are dammed if you</p>
<p>   don't. I mean people want tax reform, they want the Government</p>
<p>   to say: this is how it is going to be but they also want the Government</p>
<p>   to consult. And when you try and be faithful to both of those things</p>
<p>   they say that you are backing down. I mean this nonsense this morning</p>
<p>   about the backdown in relation to nursing homes, there's no</p>
<p>   backdown. Position that was stated yesterday by Mr Costello and</p>
<p>   Mr Smith was always the position. The same principle applies in</p>
<p>   relation to the drugs. I mean we said in the document that there'd</p>
<p>   be a certain procedure followed.....</p>
<p>FAINE:</p>
<p>For pharmaceuticals?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Yes, and then we said we would have a consultative process but</p>
<p>   I hear somebody on AM this morning saying: oh well that's not</p>
<p>   good enough, we've got to know now. Well if you have got to</p>
<p>   know now, don't ask for consultation. I mean you can't</p>
<p>   simultaneously say to the Government: will you talk to us but we</p>
<p>   want to know now what your position is. I mean that makes a mockery</p>
<p>   of the whole process of consultation. I mean let's have a little</p>
<p>   bit of sense and balance. I mean let's not trivialise something</p>
<p>   that is in the long-term interests of this country. Everybody knows</p>
<p>   the present tax system needs to be changed. We have made the gutsiest,</p>
<p>   thorough-going, comprehensive, fair attempt to fix that tax system</p>
<p>   of any side of politics in Australia since World War II. And I think</p>
<p>   it's too important to be trivialised by point scoring. If people</p>
<p>   want information about how a complex change like this operates,</p>
<p>   the Government will provide it. In areas we have designated we will</p>
<p>   only be too happy to have consultation. </p>
<p>FAINE:</p>
<p>The Labor Party are proposing to release their version of tax reform</p>
<p>   some time in the next week. It's all very delicate, the timing</p>
<p>   of it, it's all very strategic of course. It's quite possible</p>
<p>   and conceivable and I ask you to respond on this, we can speculate,</p>
<p>   that the Labor Party can offer personal tax cuts without a GST because</p>
<p>   your GST is almost separate fiscally from the tax cuts.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, John, there is no doubt in my mind that what the Labor Party</p>
<p>   will do is promise to cut personal income tax and say you can have</p>
<p>   it without a GST. I am sure they will do that. That's what</p>
<p>   they did in 1993. That's what Mr Keating and Mr Beazley did</p>
<p>   in 1993.</p>
<p>FAINE:</p>
<p>It's a pretty big promise.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>They got re-elected didn't they and do you know what happened?</p>
<p>   The tax cuts disappeared and the indirect taxes went up without</p>
<p>   compensation. There was no compensation to the nursing home residents</p>
<p>   in 1993 when Mr Keating and Mr Beazley put up the indirect taxes.</p>
<p>   There was no compensation to the pensioners. There was no thought</p>
<p>   for the battlers then, there was no outcry from some people who</p>
<p>   are now complaining about what we're doing back then. I mean</p>
<p>   I am certain that the Labor Party will promise personal tax cuts</p>
<p>   without tax reform. The Labor Party will try and do it the easy,</p>
<p>   lazy way. They will say: look, you can have tax cuts, you can have</p>
<p>   tax relief, you can have a few dollars in your pocket, but we won't</p>
<p>   change the system.</p>
<p>FAINE:</p>
<p>Well it worked last time, why wouldn't they try it again?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Perhaps in the end, of course, that will be decided by the Australian</p>
<p>   public. But I will be saying to the Australian public that we are</p>
<p>   not trying to fool you. We don't believe you can have lasting</p>
<p>   tax relief without tax reform. Because in the end if you don't</p>
<p>   repair the indirect tax base you are going to run out of resources</p>
<p>   to support those things that need support. I mean what is happening</p>
<p>   at the moment is that the system is crumbling and unless the foundations</p>
<p>   are reinforced, unless there's fundamental change, then the</p>
<p>   system will break down. And if the system breaks down the poor and</p>
<p>   the needy will suffer more than the wealthy and the affluent. That</p>
<p>   always happens. And the Labor Party, I am certain, will try the</p>
<p>   old tax bribe technique - here you are, here's some dollars</p>
<p>   but don't worry about the reform that can wait to another day.</p>
<p>   Now they did that in Â93, it worked in Â93, they fooled</p>
<p>   the Australian people in Â93. The Australian people paid very</p>
<p>   dearly for it, particularly the poor immediately after the election</p>
<p>   in 1993. So I'll certainly await the Beazley promises with</p>
<p>   great interest. But my guess is that in 1998 you are going to get</p>
<p>   a re-run of 1993 with the same consequences if Labor wins the next</p>
<p>   election.</p>
<p>FAINE:</p>
<p>So the election will be this year?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>The election may be this year. But the promise of Mr Beazley will</p>
<p>   be made this year and that's what I was referring to when I</p>
<p>   said 1998. </p>
<p>FAINE:</p>
<p>Do you think the media have given you a fair run on your tax reform</p>
<p>   package?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I think it varies. I think there is an obsessive sniping in relation</p>
<p>   to issues and a play on words. I mean this talk of backdown when</p>
<p>   you are merely confirming something that is already there, it's</p>
<p>   all intended to try and create an impression of things going wrong.</p>
<p>   I think we have done remarkably well. I mean this is a huge, complex</p>
<p>   package and I defy anybody to say that, you know, overnight you</p>
<p>   can absorb every single detail. Of course it takes explanation but</p>
<p>   if people don't want reform, if they don't want a complex</p>
<p>   package, then they can't have reform. I mean go back to what</p>
<p>   I said earlier, you are dammed if you do and you are dammed if you</p>
<p>   don't. If you attempt to reform the system people say: oh you</p>
<p>   are politically crazy, you are attempting the impossible, look it's</p>
<p>   unravelling already.....</p>
<p>FAINE:</p>
<p>And surely Prime Minister, politics is the art of achieving?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well it is also the art of leading, it's both. I mean if we</p>
<p>   are always pragmatic. If we always say: well I won't do that</p>
<p>   because it is too difficult that breeds the cynicism. You really</p>
<p>   do occasionally have to have a go even if there are personal political</p>
<p>   risks, and that's what I am doing. There may be personal political</p>
<p>   risks for me but I believe in my heart that this plan is good long-term</p>
<p>   for all Australians and that is why I am so dedicated to it.</p>
<p>FAINE:</p>
<p>Since last Thursday afternoon when you released the package, I've</p>
<p>   spoken to every small business operator with whom I've conducted</p>
<p>   a transaction, whether it's the newsagent or the man who repaired</p>
<p>   my car or the little Malaysian restaurant where we went for dinner</p>
<p>   the other night. Everyone of those small business operators I've</p>
<p>   spoken to have had the same response and they are your core constituency</p>
<p>   and they all say I don't want to become the government's</p>
<p>   tax collector.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well that's interesting you should say that. I don't</p>
<p>   for a moment doubt that that has been your anecdotal experience.</p>
<p>   The reaction that I'm getting from small business has been</p>
<p>   terrific. I was in Townsville two days ago and I addressed a meeting</p>
<p>   of the Townsville Chamber of Commerce, there were 620 people at</p>
<p>   that meeting, that function. Now Townsville is a quintessential</p>
<p>   small to medium size business city, it's a very thriving city.</p>
<p>   Small business is the backbone of North Queensland and the Chamber</p>
<p>   of Commerce people said it was the biggest crowd they have ever</p>
<p>   had at a Chamber of Commerce gathering in that town. They were overwhelming</p>
<p>   supportive and this included restaurateurs, chiropractors, tour</p>
<p>   operators, solicitors, people running other kinds of retail shops,</p>
<p>   people running service stations, it was the whole gamut. That's</p>
<p>   what you get in a large provincial centre such as Townsville and</p>
<p>   the overwhelming message I got and it was in the preamble to some</p>
<p>   of their questions was well we personally would rather you have</p>
<p>   done this or that but we do recognise that this is good for the</p>
<p>   country. If we are to have some kind of long term reform then we</p>
<p>   have to accept that we can't personally get everything that</p>
<p>   we would like and I was very, very heartened by that response. I</p>
<p>   regarded that as a marvellous bell whether of the attitude of the</p>
<p>   small business community of Australia as I moved around.</p>
<p>Now can I just say that for small businesses generally this system</p>
<p>   will be much better than the present one. Now so many small business</p>
<p>   men complain to me about the fact that the wholesales tax system</p>
<p>   drives them crazy in that some things are in and some things are</p>
<p>   out. I mean, how crazy it is that you can have a taxation, a wholesale</p>
<p>   tax system, for example, tax on pet food and toothpaste and shampoo</p>
<p>   and soap and other soap powders, wheel barrows, lawn mowers, ladders,</p>
<p>   garden equipment, children's toys, umbrellas, handbags and</p>
<p>   luggage at 22%. Yet it taxes at 32% clocks, watches, TV sets, video</p>
<p>   recorders. It taxes at 12% such things as Cadbury family blocks,</p>
<p>   Peter's natural ice-cream, Berri orange juice and Berri cordial</p>
<p>   and yet it doesn't....</p>
<p>FAINE:</p>
<p>No adds please....</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well no ads. But it doesn't tax caviar. You can buy a family</p>
<p>   car providing you pay the 22% wholesale sales tax but if you're</p>
<p>   wealthy enough like three or four people in Australia to buy a Lear</p>
<p>   jet you don't have to pay any wholesale sales tax. Now you,</p>
<p>   you translate that into the daily, monthly, quarterly experience</p>
<p>   of your average businessman and it drives him mad.</p>
<p>Now the other beauty for business of the new system is that they</p>
<p>   will be able to get back all of the taxes they pay on their business</p>
<p>   inputs. Now a lot of manufactures for example don't understand</p>
<p>   how good this is for them because at the moment they say, "Look</p>
<p>   we've got a wholesale tax exemption for manufacturing inputs",</p>
<p>   but you don't have it in relation to say a computer which carries</p>
<p>   a wholesales tax of I think 22%. But under this plan every single</p>
<p>   dollar of tax paid on a business input will be fully refundable.</p>
<p>   And something else I don't think business understands is that because</p>
<p>   of the new arrangements with the GST, every litre of petrol you</p>
<p>   buy for your business purposes will be 7 cents cheaper because under</p>
<p>   the plan we're reducing the excise to the extent necessary</p>
<p>   to let in the GST at 10% and because you can get a refund of your</p>
<p>   GST on a business input, and petrol in a business input, per go</p>
<p>   your petrol is 7 cents a litre cheaper.</p>
<p>FAINE:</p>
<p>All right. Prime Minister the other main complaint people have</p>
<p>   is they fear the rate at which the GST is pegged can eventually</p>
<p>   rise. You've built in a mechanism that you assure us is fail</p>
<p>   safe which is that both Houses of Parliament and all the States</p>
<p>   have to agree to rise before it can go through. But you've</p>
<p>   also built in a mechanism where the GST revenue gathered goes back</p>
<p>   to the States, so in a way it could be in the States interests to</p>
<p>   agree to a rise rather than the other way around.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, two things about that John. Firstly,....</p>
<p>FAINE:</p>
<p>They'd get more money</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>But firstly, they won't need it because under this plan within</p>
<p>   10 years of its operation, the States will be $25 billion better</p>
<p>   off than they are under the existing revenue sharing arrangements.</p>
<p>   That's the first reason.</p>
<p>The second reason is that you know as well as I do that trying</p>
<p>   to get agreement amongst all of the States on anything, let alone</p>
<p>   a tax rise, is extremely difficult.</p>
<p>FAINE:</p>
<p>Well, that's my point, they might not find it difficult to</p>
<p>   reach agreement when they're getting more money ...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Oh no, no, no, no, no, no, no ...</p>
<p>FAINE:</p>
<p>That's the one thing they'll all agree on.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>My point is the reverse. I mean they'll never agree on it.</p>
<p>   The political pressure against that occurring is enormous. I mean,</p>
<p>   John, I've been to more Premiers' Conferences than I think</p>
<p>   anybody left alive, as a Treasurer. Well I have. I mean, I went</p>
<p>   to six of them when I was Treasurer and I've been to four or</p>
<p>   five of them as Prime Minister, I don't know whether anybody</p>
<p>   else around has been to more than that. But anyway, I have been</p>
<p>   to a lot of them and can I tell you the hardest thing in the world</p>
<p>   is to get unanimous agreement on something. And anything as politically</p>
<p>   charged as some suggestion from a remote part of the country that</p>
<p>   you ought to have a tax rise I would think the Premiers would be</p>
<p>   falling over themselves to be the first to say no, I'm against</p>
<p>   it.</p>
<p>FAINE:</p>
<p>Four minutes to nine, a couple of other quick things beyond the</p>
<p>   GST and tax reform if we can in the time that's remaining.</p>
<p>   Opinion polls released overnight show that support for the One Nation</p>
<p>   Party in Western Australia has plummeted from 22% to 8% and the</p>
<p>   One Nation Party at the Northcote by-election in the State poll</p>
<p>   in Victoria last weekend scored 6% including the Donkey Vote. Are</p>
<p>   they on the decline?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well I don't count any chickens, I don't make wild claims.</p>
<p>   I was pleased with the result in Northcote. I'm glad One Nation</p>
<p>   did poorly in that by-election and if they're are signs that</p>
<p>   One Nation is losing support than it is because we are doing what</p>
<p>   I said in Western Australia three weeks ago we should do. And that</p>
<p>   is that the best way to fight you political opponents is to offer</p>
<p>   the Australian public something better and that is what as a government</p>
<p>   we are doing. Rather than get into rhetorical exchanges with One</p>
<p>   Nation or indeed anybody else, we are offering the Australian public</p>
<p>   leadership and a plan, we're talking about the 21st century.</p>
<p>   We're willing to say to the public, honestly you can't</p>
<p>   have tax relief without taxation reform, so I'm hopeful that</p>
<p>   we are being seen in a more positive light and that we are being</p>
<p>   seen as a government that is trying to do things in the long term</p>
<p>   interest of Australia. But I don't make any wild claims about</p>
<p>   what might happen to One Nation or indeed anybody else. I operate</p>
<p>   on the principle that I've always got to work hard to earn</p>
<p>   the support and the votes of the Australian public, I'd never</p>
<p>   take them for granted, never ever.</p>
<p>FAINE:</p>
<p>And finally John Howard we can't really pin you down on when</p>
<p>   the election will be, it's your prerogative and you'll</p>
<p>   tell us when you're good and ready to. Last time when you went</p>
<p>   to the people you promised that you would reduce unemployment in</p>
<p>   Australia. If anything it's where it was when you were elected.</p>
<p>   We've made some increases in the number of people with a job</p>
<p>   but the number of people without a job remains pretty static.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well John there's about 300,000 new jobs, more jobs than when</p>
<p>   we were elected, yes. The rate is a little lower, it's not</p>
<p>   dramatically lower. This tax plan will help because it will reduce</p>
<p>   the cost of doing business.</p>
<p>FAINE:</p>
<p>But you must be disappointed you haven't been able ...</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, well John, John I would like to see unemployment lower. If</p>
<p>   we had have been able to get the unfair dismissal law through the</p>
<p>   Senate then I think that would've helped small business a lot</p>
<p>   because there is still a lot of small businesses out there who are</p>
<p>   intimidated by the current unfair dismissal laws against taking</p>
<p>   on more staff. And this is something that is now just blithely overlooked.</p>
<p>   It was one of the major things we campaigned on at the last election</p>
<p>   for small business.</p>
<p>FAINE:</p>
<p>You'll have another go?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well we will continue to try and reform the unfair dismissal laws.</p>
<p>   Yes we will, we'll try again, absolutely. But I say to every</p>
<p>   small business man and woman who's listening, you know as well</p>
<p>   as I do that if you had better unfair dismissal laws you'd</p>
<p>   take on more staff and it's the Labor Party and the Democrats</p>
<p>   and the Greens and others in the Senate who repeatedly have blocked</p>
<p>   our attempts. And if we had have got the legislation through a couple</p>
<p>   of years ago then I believe in the small business sector there would</p>
<p>   have been a larger number of people taken on. But we're going</p>
<p>   to try that again but it is the Labor Party and the Democrats and</p>
<p>   the Greens and others who are blocking that in the Senate.</p>
<p>FAINE:</p>
<p>What's in your diary for October the 17th?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Oh, a normal day at home.</p>
<p>FAINE:</p>
<p>Kicking a footy with the kids?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, a normal day at home perhaps doing some reading, perhaps</p>
<p>   even playing a game of golf.</p>
<p>even playing a game of golf.</p>
<p>FAINE:</p>
<p>Well I hope you find the time to at some stage John Howard, you</p>
<p>   certainly haven't got time at the moment you're on the</p>
<p>   road doing the hard sell on the tax reform package. Thank you for</p>
<p>   joining us here at 3LO this morning.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
