IPSWICH COAL MINING DISASTER<br />
Statem ent by tehe Prime Minister, the Rt.<br />
Hon. William McMahon, M. P.<br />
I and my colleagues were deep.-ly distressed to hear<br />
today of the tragic loss of life which resulted from the<br />
coal mine explosions at Ipswich.<br />
I extend my own and the Commonwealth Government's<br />
sympathy to the relatives of those who lost their lives.<br />
I have been in touch with the Premier of Queensland<br />
and have asked him to let me know whether there is any<br />
way in which the Commonwealth Government can help.<br />
I feel I can speak on behalf of all Australians in<br />
expressing sympathy at this time of tragedy.<br />
CANBERRA, 31 July, 1972. </p>
