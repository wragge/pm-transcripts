D'ARCY AND POWER: IN OS SSION<br />
Monday 12th May 1.9/ 5<br />
FULL TRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW BETWEEN THE PRIME MINISTER AND BILL D'ARCY<br />
FILMED IN TAHITI AT TBE CONCLUSION OF THE PRIME MINISTER'S OVERSEAS TRIP<br />
D'ARCY: Prime Minister, you've been away from Australia for 19 days<br />
now. You've visited Peru, you've been to the Commonwealth<br />
Heads of Government Conference in Kingston, and you've seen<br />
President Ford in Washington. What do you see as. thepositive<br />
achievement of the, trip, what's the most important thing that<br />
has come out of it?<br />
MR. WHITLAM: There are two particular matters. One is the regular<br />
opportunity which occurs every two years to confer with<br />
members of the Community of Nations, the old British Commonwealth.<br />
There were nearly three dozen of us there, and there is no<br />
organisation where there can be such a frank and natural<br />
exchange of views as takes place in the context of the<br />
Commonwealth, and for Australia, this is particularly important,<br />
because there are about 15 Commonwealth nations which are<br />
island or coastal orhinterland states round the Indian Ocean.<br />
There's no gathering place in the world for nationsround the<br />
Indian Ocean to compare with the Commonwealth. Furthermore,<br />
of course, there are several countries which will be entering<br />
the Commonwealth in the South Pacific, Papua-New Guinea being<br />
the conspicuous example. Now the other great.. thing. is that..-,,<br />
I had the opportunity to speak with the American. . a4ministration<br />
and the American Congress, and there have been a great number of<br />
matters where it was interesting for them and.. for us . to exchange<br />
views. There've been some big movements in the world in the<br />
last few weeks and we were able to discuss them. *' 1 </p>

MR. WHITLAM:<br />
ARCY:<br />
MR. WHITLAM: Prime Minister, it's known that your relations<br />
with President Nixon were less than warm. It's the second<br />
time now that you've seen President Ford in seven months.<br />
What sort of/ HpoR have you been able to establish with him?<br />
What are the relations between you both?<br />
You slipped in a reference to President Nixon, so I don't<br />
want to respond to what you say, I think you may be exaggerating<br />
it. At any rate, about President Ford, whom I've met twice<br />
in the last seven months, it would be obvious that he is a very<br />
wholesome, decent person, and he is doing a good job in very<br />
difficult circumstances. We have been able to get on very well<br />
on the two good meetings that we've had.<br />
Did you notice, Prime Minister, whether the President has been<br />
able to establish himself a lot during the seven months<br />
between when you saw him last.<br />
He is respected by everyone in Congress as far as I could see.<br />
I thought that this would be the case after what I was told by the<br />
leaders of the two parties in the two houses of the Congress<br />
seven months ago. Now on this occasion I saw-them again and<br />
I saw more members of the Senate and the Congress than on the<br />
previous time actually, and they all respect the President as<br />
a man. They don't always support him,' of. course, and this would<br />
be particularly the case on many domestic issues, but.: the point is,<br />
on those matters where Australia and America are concerned<br />
with eachother, there is total support for the relations which </p>
<p>we've establiuhed, support by tho Administration, tho<br />
President, the Vice PreSident, the Cabinet, particularly<br />
the Secretary of State, Dr. Kissinger, and the other people<br />
in the State Department, the Deputy, the Assistant Secretaries<br />
and so on, all of whom we met, and it's also the case that<br />
the Congress on both sides, both houses, supports the relationship<br />
which my Government has been able to establish with the United<br />
States.<br />
D'ARCY: A statement issued by the White House after your meeting with<br />
President Ford said that the President has reassured you that<br />
the United States would honour its obligations towards<br />
Australia as far as defence. Did you seek that assurance<br />
or was it<br />
WHITLAM; No, no, this was volunteered, there was no prompting by us<br />
at all, but I hasten to say it came as no surprise to me<br />
because I have kept in touch with successive administrations,<br />
Johnson, Nixon, Ford administrations, and also with Congress<br />
under those administrations. I first started the practice, I think p.<br />
I was the first political leader in Australia to do so, to<br />
confer with Congressional leaders back in June 1967, and I've<br />
never seen any objection or any queries about the relationship<br />
between the U. S. and Australia in that time from Presidentsor<br />
from leaders of Congress.<br />
D'ARCY: Prime Plinister, one of the matters that was raised was the<br />
question of the Vietnam refugees, and you've spoken of the need<br />
to internationalise the refugee programme. Are you disappointed<br />
Sir that Asian countries in general and Singapore in particular<br />
have not joined in that programme? </p>
<p>MD, WILIAA1sYes, mind you I don't want Australians to got any impression<br />
that there is some obession or confrontation in the United<br />
States on this issue of the refugees. It was mentioned<br />
relatively briefly in the conversation with the President,<br />
and one member of the House of Representatives International<br />
Relations Committee asked a question about it, and one member<br />
of the Senate Foreign Relations Comnittee asked a question about<br />
it, but all the other members on both occasions were interested<br />
in other issues. This is not as big an issue in the U. S.<br />
as many of the press reports have said. Congress, I believe, will<br />
be supporting the administration in placing those refugees who've<br />
got to the U. S. or have been taken to the U. S. You mentioned<br />
the position in Asia in particular. I suppose it is disappointing<br />
that all of us who subscribed back in 1951 to the United Nations<br />
Convention on Refugees, -and then in 1967 to the protocol on refugee.<br />
none of us really, and I suppose Australia must accept some<br />
responsibility in this respect also, have ever put it to the Asian<br />
nations that they should subscribe to the Convention and the Protocol<br />
In the whole of our region, the only nations that have subscribed<br />
to it are Australia, New Zealand and Fiji, and then I suppose it's<br />
relevant to point out, Britain and France have, because they have<br />
colonies in this area. The United States has, of course, Canada<br />
has, but the Philippines, Thailand, Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia,<br />
and the countries further west didn't, they haven't. Now this is a<br />
gap.<br />
' A S. </p>

D IAIICY:<br />
MR. WHITLAN:<br />
D'A ROY:<br />
MR. WHITLAMI: Do you find it ironic, PrJ) i M/ in ister, that the Prime Minister<br />
of Singapore, Mr. Lee Quan Yew, should attack you at the<br />
Commxonwealth Heads of Government Conference, on the question<br />
of students from Singapore in Australia, yet he will not allow<br />
some 3,500 Vietnam refugees who are on ships in the Singapore<br />
harbour to land in Singapore.<br />
You're putting propositions to me for which I have no direct<br />
knowledge. I saw Mr. Lee on several occasions during the nine<br />
days we were in Jamaica together, and I also saw the other<br />
heads of Government, Tuin Razak from Malaysia, Wal Rowling finn)<br />
New Zealand, and Harold Wilson and Pierre Trudeau. We discussed<br />
these matters of refugees among other matters. Now on this<br />
occasion, whatever might have been the situation at the last<br />
Commonwealth meeting in Ottawa in October 1975, Mr. Lee was quite<br />
relaxed and subdued. He wasn't taking a shot at us about<br />
students. He's realised that if unpopular decisions are to be<br />
made about students, he's got to share in those decisions at<br />
least. IBut this was no longer an issue this time.<br />
Prime Minister, can I ask you how many refugees Australia<br />
will take.<br />
No, of course you can't. This has been asked of Dr. Cairns<br />
at home, and he's given you the same answer. No one knows<br />
at this stage. All one can say is that it's clearly a different<br />
situation from the one when we left home where there was<br />
still a Government in Saigon, and what one did about people who<br />
were to leave that country had to be done with the consent of that<br />
Government, and on the other hand there's the situation now where<br />
tens of thousands have left the country, got away from it, so </p>
<p>D'I AllOY:<br />
Mi. WvJITILM:<br />
D AROY:<br />
MR. WHITLAMs<br />
Dl'AROY: rTphoro in a roal opportunity, I would think, that the country<br />
will now, at last, be abi( e to be reconstructed and conciliated<br />
in peace.<br />
Do you think that some of those displaced persona, some of<br />
those, for example, in Guam, do you think it's possible<br />
for them to go back.<br />
I don't know how soon, but you remember when there were so<br />
many thousanqds who came to Australia after Budapest in 1956,<br />
many thousands in fact went back, and as we now know, there are<br />
a great number of Hungarians settled in Australia, some of them<br />
millionaires, who now quite freely and happily make return visits<br />
to Hungary. Now this is what will happen before many years have<br />
passed in respect of Vietnam.<br />
Prime Minister, one final question. Do you think it's ever going<br />
to be possible for you to make an overseas trip without<br />
Opposition demands for your return home because of some<br />
domestic issue.<br />
Oh, I don't know, I suppose every successive Liberal leader<br />
has to cut his teeth some way or another, they haven't done it<br />
very successfully, I'm now on my fifth. Well I dare say I will<br />
digest him in due course.<br />
Thank you very much. -000--<br />
