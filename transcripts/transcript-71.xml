    <content><![CDATA[<p>PRESS CONFERENCE GIVEN BY THE ACTING PUITME MT NISTER, THE RT. HON.<br />J. McEWEN, AT CANBERRA ON THURSDAY, 14) TH NAY, 1959, AT 5 P. M.<br />QUESTION:<br />MR. McEi-EN:<br />QUESTION:<br />MR. McEJEN:<br />L1ESTION:<br />MR. McETO. EN:<br />QUESTION:<br />MR. McEIVEN:<br />QUESTION:<br />MR. McETJEN:<br />QUESTION:<br />MR. McEWEN: Mr, McEwen, have you had any communication from the<br />British Government yet on the use of Woomera for<br />space research for launching satellites?<br />Yes. I think we can say that we know of the British<br />Government's plans, which have not reached the point<br />of planning projection yet planning the instrumentcarrying<br />device. W~ ell, we are in Woomera in<br />partnership with the U. K. G overnment. I don't think<br />the point has been reached at which there is any<br />necessity, I believe, to decide where this operation<br />would take place. But if, for this instrumentcarrying<br />device, Woomera were judged to be the right<br />place, of course, I have no doubt we would be<br />completely co-operative.<br />i~ ell, anyway, it has been made clear to the British<br />Government that if they wish to use Woomera for this,<br />they can do so?<br />I think it is clear i it does not have to be made<br />clear if that isnt too Irish.<br />The Americans put up a proposal some time ago that<br />they might be allowed to increase the tracking<br />facilities at Woomera. Has anything happened on that?<br />I can't answer with detailed precision, but, to the<br />extent that the Americans want to establish tracking<br />facilities here, there would be complete co-operation<br />here. Following the visit last week of the Lockheed and<br />Nor'throp people to speak to our Defence people, can<br />you say whether the Government is looking to making a<br />decision about these various matters on aircraft<br />replacement, say, within any specific time? Have<br />they got any time period that they are thinking of<br />in which they are looking to come to a point on it4<br />I don't think it can be said that they have a precise<br />date decided. But these things, clearly, take so long<br />to mature that I think it can be said that the<br />appropriate defence authorities are studying what type<br />of aircraft will replace the current type.<br />You would not say that they were looking to being<br />ready to be clear in their own minds, say, in two<br />months or three months or any period such as that?<br />I would think not so in so narrow a bracket of time<br />as that; no.<br />Mr. McEwen, this week in the last few days the<br />Minister for Civil Aviation introduced a Bill, which<br />has now been shelved, about airport controls and<br />drinking liquor and so on. Can you give us any<br />guidance about the Government's intentions about<br />that matter?<br />Well, I think that the frank answer is that the<br />Government believed particularly in respect of<br />international travel, that it was desirable that we<br />should have facilities that are common in today's<br />world for international travellers. And the legislation<br />that was introduced conforms to that general</p>
<p>QUESTION:<br />MR. McE'dEN:<br />COIMENT:<br />MR. McEWIEN:<br />QUESTION:<br />MR. McE-dEN:<br />QUESTION:<br />MR. McEdEN:<br />QUESTION:<br />MR. McEWEN:<br />QUESTION:<br />MR. McEWEN:<br />QUESTION:<br />MR. McEWEN:<br />QUESTION:<br />MR. McEWEN: objective. Well, it is common knowledge that it did<br />not find favour in its existing form in the Senate,<br />and the Government has withdrawn it in deference to<br />the Senate and will re-study the situation.<br />It is abandoned?<br />No. It would be wrong to s-: y that it is abandoned.<br />It is not legislation if I may remind you that is<br />exclusively confined to alcoholic liquor, although the<br />searchlight was turned on alcoholic liquor in the<br />facilities and services.<br />The business concessions.<br />W4ell, business concessions se;--rns to be a business<br />enterprise. But, a packet of cigarettes a whole<br />variety of things that a travcller may need.<br />In shelving it, has the Government been infl'. uenced by<br />any temperance protests any Rechabite movement or<br />anything like that?<br />Well, that really has not arisen. I think it has been<br />influenced by the Senators.<br />As I understood it, Sir, the basic idea behind the<br />Bill was that it should help to make airports pay,<br />and the Government is still holding to that principle<br />and wants to go al~ 1ead to make airports pay by<br />establishing franchises there in the future. Is that<br />r ight?<br />I would not have thought that making airports pay was<br />a primary objective of the legislation. I think it<br />was a service to the travelling public that was the<br />primary thing in mind.<br />When do you hope to re-introduce it -in the Budget<br />session? I would not put a point of time on something that<br />was unacceptable in its existing form; clearly, it<br />must become a matter of discussions. When you engage<br />in those kind of discussions, who can put a time on it?<br />Do you mean discussions with the nine" 6 o'clock closing<br />hours" Senators?<br />No. Is that their objection Sir, the time factor?<br />No; I don't think it can be quite narrowed down to<br />that. I think it is a broader objection that I don't<br />find myself able to completely describe, but<br />sufficient to justify some negotiations.<br />These negotiations, will they involve talks with the<br />States? Is there any attempt, in other words, to<br />reconcile Federal and State laws on liquor?<br />Well, I think the discussions will be ;. iith the<br />Senators. If the Senators have views on the interests<br />of the Stizt--es, that clearly would bring the whole<br />thing into the field.</p>
<p>QUESTION:<br />MR. McEWEN:<br />QUESTION:<br />MR. McEWEN:<br />QUESTION: In other words, you intend, if necessary, to override<br />the States.<br />Oh no; I am not saying that. The legislation, in<br />the form introduced, would have established on<br />Commonwealth property as I comprehend it hours<br />of trading that may, in circumstances, have been<br />broader than the hours of the States. Although in<br />respect of alcoholic liquor it could have been through<br />the operation of bona fide laws in the State, it would<br />not necessarily have meant that the concessionaire on<br />the Commonwealth property would be operating wider<br />than a hotel in the State could have.<br />Mr. McEwen, is it not also true that no State<br />Government could license any lqiuor sales on<br />Commonwealth airports without the permission of the<br />Commonwealth?<br />Yes. Well, you have the qualification without well,<br />I think that is true without the permission of the<br />Commonwealth. On another airline matter: It was reported that<br />Cabinet this week discussed the proposal for reorganizing<br />the routes to New Guinea. Could you tell<br />us anything about what was proposed or what was done<br />there?<br />MR. McEWEN:<br />QUESTION:<br />MR. McEWEN:<br />QUESTION:<br />MR. McEWEN:<br />QUESTION: MR. McEWEN:<br />QUESTION: I think my memory has let me right down.( Laughter.)<br />Is there anything you can say yet, Sir, on the Dairying<br />Committee?<br />No; I am sorry. We are not in a position to make an<br />announcement on the Dairying Committee. But Mr.<br />Adermann and myself and some colleagues are really<br />vigorously at work trying to put together the kind of<br />committee that the Government believes to be acceptable.<br />I think as soon as the House has gone into recess? we<br />will have rather more time. But we have been actively<br />at work over the last couple of weeks. The calibre of<br />the people we want consequent upon the importance<br />that we attach to this committee, is not easy to pick<br />up if you really want good people.<br />Have you decided Sir, how many people you will have<br />on the committee4<br />The thinking is that we would have five people on the<br />committee. That is our present objective. It is<br />subject to gaining five people who would be<br />sufficiently representative.<br />From the various States?<br />Well, when I say " representative", I don't mean<br />representatives of States or of interests. But I<br />would like it to be clear representative out of<br />their experience and knowledge. And, clearly, this<br />problem is so geographically wide-spread, we would<br />want a pretty wide-spread representation to bring<br />the actual practical knowledge to the committee.<br />Mr. McEwen going back to the question of defence<br />aircraft, f got the impression that both Northrop<br />and the other group Lockheed would be interested<br />in investing money in the Australian industry, to<br />make planes in Australia and also to use this as a<br />service area to service SEATO. Has that proposition<br />been put to the Government?</p>
<p>MR. McEWEN:<br />QUESTION:<br />MR. McEWEN:<br />COMMENT: MR. McEWEN:<br />QUESTION:<br />MR. McEWEN:<br />QUESTION: MR. McEWEN:<br />QUESTION:<br />MR. McEWEN: ' dell, it has not been put to the Government qua<br />government. It may and I don't know it may have<br />been put to some level of government; it has not,<br />certainly, been put to the Cabinet.<br />What would the reaction be to that, as a Government?<br />I think the Governi-nent's rel, ctl'on would ho~ ve to await flie<br />particular proposition. It would, on the one hand,<br />have its own substantive merits, as against which,<br />we have existing aircraft manufacturing establishments<br />here, which we would not forget exist, of course.<br />This proposal was that they would invest money in<br />the existing aircraft.<br />Ohl, yes. Well, then that clearly introduces the<br />ownership of the other aircraft interests, as well<br />as the concern of the Government.<br />Mr. McEwen, has the Government's deliberation on the<br />QANTAS hotel project reached any conclusions?<br />No. The position is as I broadly described it last<br />time. We have received intimations from private<br />interests more than one that they would be<br />prepared to build a hotel to enter into an<br />arrangement with QANTAS, etc. As QANTAS are the<br />people who need the hotel accommodation, we have, in<br />the fLirst place, asked QANTAS to go into discussion<br />with these various people. But that I make it<br />clear does not mean that we have farmed the decision<br />out to QANTAS.<br />There have been reports, following developments such<br />as the possibly large wheat carry-over or the much<br />obviously large wheat carry-over this year, and the<br />fact that the world wheat prices, Ii think, as of now<br />are somewhat below our domestic support price, that<br />the WJheat Stabilisation Pool could run out of money<br />in the first year of this current wheat stabilisation<br />plan. Is that speculation on the r~ ight track. Does<br />it look like running out of money?<br />Frankly, I think it is a little too early to speculate<br />to that extent. I have seen some evidence that in<br />the last few weeks export wheat prices have slightly<br />hardened, as a matter of fact. And I really think<br />that before the Northern Hemisphere crop really comes<br />in to sight, it is too early to speculate on values<br />or the actualities of disposals.<br />What would be the position if it did run out of money?<br />Would the Government then have to find the money out<br />of its own resources to meet its commitments under<br />the 100 million bushels?<br />That's right. That is the provision of the Wheat<br />Stabilisation legislation. The wheatgrowers have to<br />put up to a certain formula their own money. When<br />that runs out, or if that runs out, the Treasury<br />stands behind the guarantee. The quid pro quo, of<br />course, has been that the wheat industry has agreed<br />to sell to the Australian public at cost of production<br />during the last what is is? more than ten years.<br />In fact, the selling price to the Australian public<br />would be much more than Å 100O million less than the<br />selling price would have been during that period if<br />it had been export parity.</p>
<p>QUESTION:<br />MR. McEWEN:<br />QUESTION: MR. McEVJEN:<br />QUESTION:<br />MR. McEWEN:<br />QUESTION:<br />MR. McEWEN:<br />QUESTION:<br />MR. McEWJEN:<br />QUESTION:<br />MR. McEtWEN:<br />COMMENT: QUESTION:<br />MR. McEWEN:<br />QUESTION:<br />MR. McE WEN:<br />QUESTION:<br />MR. McEWEN: Mr. McEwen, coming back to the QANTAS hotel: Are<br />these groups that you mentioned Sydney groups?<br />Not only Sydney groups.<br />Could you give an indication from where they do come?<br />I was just thinking of ethics. If you will let me<br />pause for a moment. I think I can say frankly<br />no, I won't identify them. People who write to me<br />and make a proposition no, I won't reveal them.<br />Mr. McEwen, will there be any further re-examination<br />of the New Guinea tax proposals as a result of the<br />deputation that saw you today?<br />Yes. Mr. Holt, Mr. Hasluck and I met the deputation.<br />Vie have heard in considerable length and detail<br />certain criticisms. We have undertaken to consult our<br />colleagues, which may not involve a full and formal<br />meeting of the Cabinet, but an effective consultation<br />on what has been said. It broadly involves two<br />considerations, I think: First, a request that there<br />be a deferment of the introduction, or, alternatively<br />that there be some modifications in detail of the Bill<br />before the House. And those are the two things that<br />the Government will have to the Ministers will have<br />to consider.<br />No suggestion to drop it altogether from the<br />deputation. I think it would be an exaggeration to say it was<br />suggested to drop it altogether. I think that the<br />most extreme suggestion was that we should hold it up,<br />pending a public enquiry; that was the most extreme<br />suggestion. Is there any possibility of a public enquiry, Sir?<br />Well, that would be to pre-judge the consultations<br />with my colleagues to say so.<br />Mr. McEwen, have you a date in mind for the resumption<br />of Parliament?<br />I think Mr. Holt has announced something of the<br />Budget, hasn't he?<br />Not a firm date that I am aware of.<br />For the Premiers' Conference, Sir?<br />I'm sorry. I thought you said " the resumption of<br />Parliament". No, not a firm date, no.<br />Mr. Holt, this morning, appeared to have some hope<br />of income tax cuts in the next Budget. Do you share<br />that hope?<br />Well, I find hope is cheap and encouraging. ( Laughter.)<br />But I could not be more explicit than that.<br />Can you say when Cabinet will have its first meeting<br />on the Budget?<br />No, I can't say precisely; but I think we have to<br />get the Premniers' Conference and the Loan Council<br />behind us before we can fix the date of that,<br />2"<br />a</p>
<p>QUESTION:<br />MR. McEWEN:<br />QUESTION:<br />MR. McEWEN:<br />QUESTION:<br />MR. McEW" EN:.<br />QUESTION:<br />MR. McEI4EN:<br />QUESTION:<br />MR. McEWEN:<br />QUESTION: MR. McEWEN:<br />QUESTION:<br />MR. McEWEN:<br />QUESTION:<br />MR. McEWEN:<br />QUESTION:<br />MR. McEWEN:<br />QUESTION:<br />MR. McEWEN: The Premiers, Conference and the Loan Council how<br />soon?<br />Well in a month to six weeks, I think.<br />Is there any Cabinet thinking at this stage on the<br />Budget? I wouldn't be surprised.<br />On that, Sir, is it true that you are all quite happy<br />about the prospects of revenue increasing in the coming<br />financial year on the existing rates. In other words,<br />there was a period, I gather when it looked as though<br />revenue might fall again, bu~ now, because of the<br />increase in wool prices and so on, it looks as though<br />revenue will be increasing.<br />I think I would be correct in saying that the thinking<br />is that the level of economic activity is pretty<br />stable now and it is that which indicates the revenue<br />that current rates<br />Would it be up higher in the 59/ 60 than they are now?<br />Well, the trend at the same level of activity with<br />a growing population and so on, it tends always to<br />increase proportionately.<br />That alone could be encouraging, couldn't it?<br />The liabilities tend to increase commensurately, you<br />know. A rather more domestic question: I understand there<br />was a luncheon between the Cabinet and the Liberal<br />backbenchers. Was that your idea?<br />Oh no, it was not; and your fact really is not right.<br />Isn't it?<br />No. The Liberal Ministers gave a luncheon to the<br />Liberal Party. The Country Party was not so liberal as<br />the Liberal Party; the Country Party gave a dinner to<br />the Country Party the other evening.<br />A sort of end-of-session party, was it?<br />Just that, yes. We had a get-together; we had a<br />buffet dinner on Tuesday evening; and the Liberals<br />had a luncheon today.<br />Do you know whether you will be tabling this Economic<br />Survey thing to-night?<br />It will be tabled to-night.<br />Mr. McEwen, with reference to the Foreign Ministers'<br />Conference taking place at Geneva, can you say whether<br />the Government, at this stage, hopes or believes that<br />it will lead to a Summit Conference?<br />I think that the Government has always hoped that a<br />foundation wou) A be established which would justify<br />a Summit Conference.<br />With the compliments of:<br />HUGH DASH,<br />PRESS SECRETARY TO THE PRIME MINISTER.</p>
