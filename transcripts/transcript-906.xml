ADDRESS BY THE PRIME SISi._ IR % CITG. Ma( ZIEs. 14. 16.<br />
OFICIA. OPZN: N(; OF " GEQEGE ? 4CtRIEPF BARRCH WbIEilAL., OCEAN BEACH. MINLY.<br />
Mr. Chai man, Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlement<br />
Just so I won't miss the bus, I declare this building open.<br />
just so that you won't fall into a state of despair I see that somebody has<br />
very kindly nut uP over there a notice next to my namsake, the sergeant, w~ ich says<br />
" Four-hour Parking", I take it that that's the dead limit, four hours.<br />
Now I won't go on for more than another three.*<br />
Now you may complain about It raining, but I do not my one regret about this<br />
rain Is this, I wish it were falling in Canberra-you don't need it, having enjoyed a<br />
typical suuvaqr, but we do. But there is one reason I like to see it falling here,<br />
you know, for years and years, shil" Yarsp I've put up with the unkind remarks of my<br />
colleagues at Canberra, the ones who come from Sydney, making uniformly rude remiarks<br />
about the Melbourne climate particularly the Mlbourne suarer -I had to come here<br />
to discover It.<br />
Now this is really a great occasion, I am not going to speak at any length<br />
to you, you have just had an admirable summary of the history of this great Scheme<br />
and the work that it does. But I'm here very largely because this work, this great<br />
Scheme Is, I think, one of the most exciting thingsim Auitplial V will allow.<br />
me to make just one broad remark or* this ' atter we have rather got Into the habit,,<br />
haven't we, of looking to gonziiaents for .11 the 9eod things-that we thinkr out to<br />
4be done. We have a very great disposition to say, well, wt pay our taxes, there<br />
are governments, we elect them, we don't think such of thopi still thety're the best<br />
we can get and we mst leave it to them until we get the opportunity of tossing<br />
them out. All this, of course, Is highly Intelligible to me, but don't let's fall Into<br />
the error of thinking that In this hummn Ilfeg, full of humaan beings, we can leave<br />
everything to a govenment department, because as I once took the liberty of saying an<br />
another occasion, there or# many departiments iWall gov~ m. entsp but I don't know a<br />
single department of * loving kindness*, and If we're to have loving kindness not<br />
parcelled out according to the Toles of the statute or the 2egVlatiena made under a<br />
statute then It still remains for human beings to provide It* And the Interesting<br />
thing in Australia is that so many human beings, relatively speaking, have seen this<br />
challenge and have wonderful things for all of us. They my at some stage be<br />
a ssisted by 3 qoYrr-. mht or by a depatet or by sme officials of It, but they<br />
themselves have the vision, the imegination, the kindness In their hearts to start<br />
the work. Now there are two great names as we all know9 In the Inland of Australap<br />
one is the ' Pam of Drumond because of this Schee and the other is the name </p>
<p>, j04lynn of the lnland, with the Flyingq Doctor SeTvice, with a1l these things that<br />
-: have been done, ( do you think I requiret this-) ( If I take this ( umbrella) I'll speak<br />
long I think-you'd better take it back). Flynn of the Inland, now all sorts of<br />
things happen In the centre of Australia. But you sea it was one mang with<br />
imagination,, with devotion, wh~ o started all thee* things in the inland, and that's<br />
whiy the name of Flynn Is imortal* And In this case It was 9oe man, quickly<br />
accompanied by another, Drummond, and then Barron,-uho thought of this, v" e created<br />
this, vdico provived the fire and the inspiration and the generosity to make it go on.<br />
Really, I dare say that not all of you read the Bible as regularly as<br />
you should, but there is one line in-. it that we ought to remember on an occasion like,<br />
this and It Is " Let us now praise famous am and our fathers % bich begat us".<br />
Let us'praise famous motn, We are praising one to-day -we are commemorating one<br />
to-day in the n3me of this building -but really every night we ought to thank heaven<br />
we hdve been able to produce in this country, people, of unselfishness, of skill,<br />
of devotion, of Imagination, who have enabled these great things to be done.<br />
When I was a very small boy In a very primitive section of-the bush<br />
in Victoria there was a doctor here, another doctor 25 miles awayp that's true, but<br />
what happened to little children who had some physical defect, some kind of complaint?<br />
Without diagncsis, I wouldn't Mnow. When you think that in this very place,<br />
hundreds and now thousands of children have been rmeolved and twated and given a<br />
* vision of a new life, when you th. l*. of that, then this wouldn't have happened If<br />
we, hadn't had people with Imagination, aided in this case, of course, by that<br />
remarkable woan, Airs. Hill*<br />
This Is a great tiuavirete, a great triuvirsea and although their<br />
names may be personally unknown to a great number of peoplo in Australia, I can<br />
assure you indeed that this great Scheme is increasingly well-knove to the people<br />
of Australia and that they have a proper pride in Ito Now I call on you to have<br />
pride in It, I call on you to'have a feeling of something like inspiration vwen<br />
we think about. it. I call upon you to reember that what can be done by three<br />
people, initially, can be d* 6* by three thousand or thre millions, so be it that<br />
they have imagination and goneros~ ty In their mind* and hearts.<br />
So, Sir, this Is a great hmian occasion* You are getting wetter<br />
and wetter, and I, like all public speakers, an performing the remarkable feat of<br />
getting drier and drier, at the same time. Therefore, to repeat myslf, 9 I went to<br />
thank you for your patience under these conditions and to repeat, that I have a<br />
aiinal honour inl declaring this building open. </p>
