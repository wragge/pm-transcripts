    <content><![CDATA[<p>I propose recommending to His Excellency the Governor-General that he</p>
<p> appoints Mr Mal Brough, MP, the Member for Longman, as Parliamentary Secretary</p>
<p> to the Minister for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business.</p>
<p>Mr Brough will have particular responsibility for small business issues.</p>
<p>After a military career, Mr Brough was elected to the House of Representatives</p>
<p> in March 1996 as the first member for the newly-created Queensland seat</p>
<p> of Longman.</p>
<p>I am sure he will bring great energy to this new responsibility.</p>
<p>The duties of Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs,</p>
<p> previously discharged by The Hon. Kathy Sullivan, MP, will now be undertaken</p>
<p> by Senator the Hon. Kay Patterson, currently Parliamentary Secretary to</p>
<p> the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs. She will also</p>
<p> retain that position.</p>
