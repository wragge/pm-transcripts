FOR PRESS: 7 Y 19 PM. No. 54/ 1968<br />
PARIS AS SITE FOR VIET NAM TALKS<br />
Comment by the Prime Minister, Mr John Gorton<br />
The Australian Government welcomes the fact that a<br />
site for talks has now been agreed between the United States and Hanoi,<br />
and that a date for beginning the talks has been set.<br />
The selection of the sit accords with the views of the<br />
Australian Government which has been kept constantly informed over<br />
the past few weeks by the United States Government as to suggestions<br />
for a site, and which has publicly and privately expressed the view that<br />
we thought it preferable for the site to be one which was neutral.<br />
Our views on this matter have also been exchanged in<br />
communications with the Government of the Republic of Viet Nam and<br />
with other countries contributing forces to Viet Nam.<br />
We believe that what has been agreed is a step forward.<br />
But it is only one step and it is likely that long and hard negotiations<br />
lie ahead before we will know whether those negotiations will in fact<br />
lead to the hoped for just and lasting peace.<br />
CANBERRA, 4 May 1968 </p>
