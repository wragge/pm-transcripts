NOISE MANAGEMENT INITIATWES AT SYDNEY AIRPORT<br />
Sydney residents worst affected by aircraft noise will have immediate access to<br />
compensation measures under the Federal Government's $ 183.4 million noise<br />
amelioration package.<br />
The package, announced on 1 November, was originally intended to be spread over ten<br />
years with the voluntary acquisition of 112 houses within the 3 0 to 40 Australian Noise<br />
Exposure Forecast ( ANEF) contours and the insulation of 3,500 houses above the<br />
ANEF contour.<br />
Prime Minister, Paul Keating, and the Minister f6r Transport, Laurie Brereton, said<br />
Cabinet had agreed to bring forward the package so that the acquisitions and insulation<br />
will be completed within three years at a cost of around $ 60 million each year.<br />
" Residents in the most noise-affected areas, in the 40-plus ANEF contour, will be<br />
contacted immediately about acquisition of their properties under the Government's<br />
voluntary acquisition program," they said.<br />
The Department of Administrative Services will assist in the early start to the program<br />
to soundproof schools and colleges down to the 25 ANEF with the aim of completing<br />
the necessary works by the end of the first term of the 1995 school year.<br />
" The noise treatment program will be the subject of continuous evaluation to ensure<br />
that its objectives are being met."<br />
Mr Brereton said the cost of the program will be met by a tax on the jet aircraft using<br />
Sydney airport. Legislation to implement the tax will be introduced early in 1995 and<br />
the tax will apply from 1 July, 1995.<br />
Cabinet also approved a number of other measures aimed at tackling the noise<br />
problems" at Sydney Airport. The measures include designated flight paths, penalties<br />
for flight path violation, increased penalties for curfew violation, and a proposal to<br />
introduce slot times for peak periods. </p>
<p>In future, jets taking off to the north will be required to taxi to the southernmost end of<br />
the runway and attain as much height as possible prior to reaching residential areas.<br />
The following attachment, with maps, details the measures approved today.<br />

<p>NOISE MANAGEMENT INITIATIVES AT SYDNEY AIRPORT<br />
OPERATIONAL MEASURES AT SYDNEY AIRPORT<br />
The Government proposes a number of steps to minimise the number of people<br />
affected by aircraft noise in Sydney.<br />
1. Establishment of designated flight paths<br />
The Civil Aviation Authority ( CAA) has developed new flight paths associated with<br />
instrument approach and departure procedures designed to international standards.<br />
These are designed to confine overflights to the narrowest flight paths in order to<br />
minimise the number of people affected by aircraft noise.<br />
These paths will apply to all jet take-offs and landings given that:<br />
jets produce the most noise; and<br />
to constrain propeller aircraft to the same flight paths would significantly<br />
slow throughput of traffic and constrain airport capacity.<br />
Copies of the new approach and departure paths are attached.<br />
2. Penalties for flight path violation.<br />
The experience since the opening of the parallel runway at Sydney Airport<br />
demonstrates that the previous flight paths allowed aircraft to spread out over wide<br />
areas of Sydney's most densely populated suburbs.<br />
Adherence to the new flight-paths will be closely monitored. New Regulations<br />
under the Air Navigation Act will be introduced to provide a legislative basis for jet<br />
aircraft, which operate outside the tolerances set for the flight paths, to be liable for<br />
prosecution under the Act. The Regulations will provide for substantial financial<br />
penalties for offenders. Corporate operators will face a maximum penalty of<br />
$ 25,000 for each violation. The Regulations will be introduced this year and take<br />
effect as soon as aircraft navigational systems can be programmed to fly the new<br />
flight paths.<br />
3. Requirement for jet aircraft to depart from the southern end of the<br />
main north-south runway ( northerly takeoffs on 34L) and attain as<br />
much height as possible over residential areas<br />
When prevailing winds make it necessary for jet aircraft to take off to the north on<br />
the main north-south runway ( 34L) they will be required to depart from the farthest<br />
point of the southern end of the runway. This will ensure that aircraft are at a<br />
greater height above residential areas on take-off. </p>
<p>Jets will be required to attain as much height as soon as possible after take-off prior<br />
to reaching residential areas.<br />
4. Curfew enforcement<br />
There is to be a stringent enforcement of the curfew arrangements.<br />
The Curfew Regulations under the Air Navigation Act will be amended to provide<br />
for financial penalties for unauthorised operations, rather than the present<br />
administrative penalty whereby the operator can be prevented from using the airport<br />
for a specified period of up to 12 months. This administrative penalty was never<br />
applied. The Regulations will provide for substantial financial penalties for<br />
breaches. Corporate operators will face a maximum penalty of $ 25,000 for each<br />
breach. The Regulations will be in place by Christmas.<br />
Demand management at Sydney Airport<br />
In order to ensure that demand on Sydney Airport matches the capacity of the<br />
airport during peak hours of operation the Government will propose the introduction<br />
of a system of slots for aircraft movements to and from the airport during certain<br />
peak periods of the day. The appropriate mechanism for allocating slots will be<br />
developed in consultation with the airline industry.<br />
6. Reaffirmation of Government Policy on operational noise controls<br />
The Government reaffirms the strict enforcement of the following operational<br />
controls at Sydney Airport:<br />
unless otherwise required on safety or weather grounds all take-offs must be<br />
to the south of the airport over Botany Bay;<br />
no take-offs to the north from the new runway;<br />
the east-west runway will remain available for use when weather conditions<br />
preclude take-offs and landings on the parallel runways for safety reasons;<br />
existing controls on times and locations of ground running operations to be<br />
retained<br />
NOISE TREATMIENT MEASURES<br />
On 1 November 1994 the Government announced a $ 183.4 million package of<br />
measures over 10 years to reduce the impact of aircraft noise on residents around<br />
Sydney Airport. The package includes the voluntary acquisition of homes within the<br />
Australian Noise Exposure Forecast contour ( ANEF) and the insulation of homes<br />
between the 30 and 40 ANEF contour. Schools, colleges, hospitals, child and health<br />
care facilities will be eligible for insulation down to the 25 ANEF contour.<br />
It is now proposed to accelerate this program and have it completed within 3 years<br />
at a cost of around $ 60 million each year. The voluntary acquisition program and </p>
<p>the insulation program for schools and colleges will commence immediately. It is<br />
expected that the school and college insulation program will be completed by the<br />
end of the first term of the new school year.<br />
The Department of Administrative Services will assist in the early commencement<br />
of the noise treatment program.<br />
The cost of the program will be met by a tax on the jet aircraft using Sydney<br />
Airport. Legislation to implement the tax will be introduced in early 1995 and the<br />
tax will apply from 1 July 1995.<br />
MONITORING AND COMMUNITY CONSULTATION<br />
To improve monitoring, information and consultation with residents affected by<br />
aircraft noise the Government will establish a new community consultative<br />
committee to monitor noise abatement and amelioration measures.<br />
SYDNEY WEST AIRPORT<br />
The Government has reaffirmed its commitment to the construction of a major<br />
runway at Sydney West Airport and the construction of road linkages between<br />
Sydney West Airport and Sydney Airport ( KSA) by 1998/ 99.<br />
To date the Government has:<br />
expended $ 150 million to acquire the* airport site, purchase forecast noise<br />
affected properties, build local access roads and undertaken preliminary<br />
concept design<br />
committed a further $ 120 million for the building of a 2900 metre runway<br />
which will be capable of accommodating medium haul operations by B747<br />
and B767<br />
commenced an EIS on options for the National Highway between Prestons<br />
and Cecil Park. Construction of the road link will be undertaken at an<br />
approximate cost of $ 200 million to coincide with the opening of the 2900m<br />
runway. commenced a joint Commonwealth/ State engineering study to secure a rail<br />
corridor as a basis for effective rail links between Sydney West Airport,<br />
KSA and the city.<br />
A project team is currently preparing detailed submissions for the Government on<br />
how the airport can be developed to an integrated master plan to provide for<br />
modular development and expansion to meet demand. </p>
