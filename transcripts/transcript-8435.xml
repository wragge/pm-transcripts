PRIME MINISTER22/ 92<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON. P. J. KEATING, MP<br />
HEWSON HIDES FROM QUESTION TIME<br />
Today Dr Hewson revealed his new strategy for Parliament<br />
he intends to ask me no questions and have his deputy move<br />
frivolous censure motions.<br />
He is under pressure and cannot handle the Parliamentary<br />
forum.<br />
Dr Hewson should appreciate that the Government is not bound<br />
to accept frivolous censure motions sooner or later he<br />
will have to front.<br />
When he does he will be subjected to the same scrutiny I<br />
have subjected him to over the past two weeks.<br />
When he accepted the job of Opposition Leader he said he<br />
would restore Question Time to its rightful place.<br />
Suddenly, the man who used to ask the questions doesn't like<br />
the answers.<br />
