TRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW/ TALKBACK WITH VINCENT SMITH, RADIO SAA<br />
MARCH 1990<br />
E&amp; G0H PROOF ONLY<br />
SMITH: Are you feeling a bit of pressure.<br />
PM&amp; No, I don't feel pressure, I realise that I've got to<br />
work right up until Friday night, and I'll do that.<br />
SMITHs Do you feel that things like this MFP row place<br />
0 pressure on you, indeed diversions from the issues.<br />
PM: I think it's a very unfortunate diversion, I think<br />
however that the electorate will slot that into their overall<br />
assessment of which side has addressed the issues and addressed<br />
the real challenges of Australia's future I think we've ( lone<br />
that, I don't think the other side has.<br />
SMITHs You've had a very relaxed campaign it strikes ae, that<br />
you've been taking it almost easy.<br />
PM: No, I haven't taken it easy. I wouldn't insult the<br />
Australian people by taking an election easy. I've put<br />
everything I've got into it. What is true is that the actual<br />
schedule has been not quite as demanding as in the past in one<br />
important respect. We haven't scheduled so many fund-raising<br />
dinners at night, and they can be, while a lot of fun, and I<br />
enjoy them in one sense, they also take an enormous amount out; of<br />
you, and the relative absence of those night dinners has made! it<br />
V. somewhat easier.<br />
SMITH: Have you been getting early nights?<br />
PM: I've been getting a lot earlier nights than I normally<br />
do in an election campaign, yes. I feel good.<br />
SFIMS You're staying actually, you're staying in the Hyatt<br />
Hotel,. next door to the casino, have you been across to have a<br />
flutter, are you thinking of doing that.<br />
PM: No, I haven't been to the casino, no.<br />
SMITHiSDMiIdTH : y ou stay at Wrest Point </p>
<p>PM: No no.<br />
SMITH: You're not having a flutter?<br />
PM: No.<br />
SMITH: I wondered whether you've been putting a price, some<br />
odds, on yourself<br />
PM: No, I believe others are doing that Vincent, bUt I<br />
wouldn't degrade the process by doing that.<br />
SMITH: Not long odds on.<br />
PM: No, I just take the view that this is a tight election<br />
and I've got to do as much as I can to really I've got two<br />
things to do; to sell my own policies, the present and for the<br />
future, that I've tried to do; I also have an obligation to<br />
expose the inadequacies of the other side, the dangers in their<br />
policies for the future of this couintry# I've tried to do that.<br />
M~ ore than that I can't do.<br />
SMITH: Do you think the odds may have changed with the<br />
emergence of this MFP issue, this week.<br />
PM: I don't think so. What that has meant of course is<br />
that there's been, deliberately on the part of the Opposition,<br />
from the end of last week, a diversion from the major issUes.<br />
They chose to do that and that would seem to me to be unwise from<br />
their point of view, but interestingly what it's done again is to<br />
allow to emerge in the highest of relief the great internal<br />
divisions within the Opposition. Let's look at it. You have Mr<br />
Peacock, sometime on the Thursday, talking to some small elentent<br />
of the leadership group, not including 14r Howard who is the<br />
Minister responsible, and the word went out on Thursday night<br />
that they had made their decision, to go against what they had<br />
said just a matter of days before. Just last week, this is the<br />
of ficial Opposition response in the Sydney Morning Herald, on the<br />
question of the policy, I quote, this one short sentences " The<br />
proposal is unique for Australia and deserves extensive<br />
consideration". Nov that's the week before, that's what their<br />
position was, then Mr Peacock gets together with two or three of<br />
the leadership on a Thursday night, and they make up their minds<br />
on the basis of some material before them, that they'll say no,<br />
wfie it completely including the proposition that this has been<br />
an enclave. Didn'* t consult Mr Howard. So what have you got<br />
That rushed up little decision on the Thursday night, the Federal<br />
President of the Party, Mr John Elliott, an ardent, vigorous,<br />
enthusiastic supporter of it, Mr Greiner pushing like hell to get<br />
the concept for NSW, now the National Party bloke in Queensland<br />
damning Mr Peacock for what he's done. I mean you've got here<br />
again, the successful Mr Peacock, successful in the sense of </p>
<p>PM ( cont'd) s putting up in neon lights, " I lead a massively<br />
divided Liberal Party and Coalition". Some achievement.<br />
SMITH Okay. Everybody seems to know better than the PM of<br />
the country, don't they. The Opposition Leader knows better,<br />
everybody out there in the electorate knows better, everybody<br />
wants to run the country, don't they, but no one wants to be PM.<br />
Why do you want to be PM again after 3 terms.<br />
PMs Well let me say, give you a reason why, which is not<br />
driving me. I can honestly say that it's not a question now of<br />
marking up personal milestones, this country has given me the<br />
immeasurable honor and pride and privilege of being its PM for<br />
seven years and to be PM of what I clearly regard as the best<br />
country in the world is something that's just enormous, and I<br />
thank them for that. But I am striving harder in this election<br />
to win than I ever have before I think, because I truly believe<br />
that the policies that are being put by the Opposition are a<br />
recipe for disaster for this country, domestically and<br />
internationally. And I love this country that much, I mean the<br />
whole of my public life and the whole of my adult working life,<br />
has been public life, has been to try and advance the interests<br />
of Australia, and I am as sure as I am of anything, Vincent, that<br />
if the Opposition were to be able to come in and do the things<br />
which they are promising, it would set this country back<br />
immeasurably. I mean what do I mean by that.<br />
SMITH3 We'd be on the road to a banana republic.<br />
PM; Well you would. I mean you would certainly go into<br />
recession because you look now four days from the election, they<br />
have their hinge words, their linch-pin words if I can put it<br />
that way. And what are they? Productivity, increased<br />
productivity. But their policies are a recipe for negative<br />
growth, growth productivity movements. A wages explosion,<br />
there must be a wages explosion. Capital gains tax, they would<br />
in shovelling billions of dollars into the pockets of the<br />
wealthiest one per cent, that's not only a recipe for social<br />
divisiveness, but it's a recipe for economic backwardness because<br />
instead of investment decisions being made as they are now, on<br />
the basis of productivity considerations what's the best economic<br />
return, investment decisions would once again become how do you<br />
increase the paper value of particular assets so that you can<br />
flog that tax free. And this is the reverse of what productivity<br />
dedision-making is about. These sorts of things in the area of<br />
tax and the economy are a recipe for sending Australia back into<br />
economic backwardness, social divisiveness and we've done too<br />
much in the country together to come together, to become<br />
competitive again. We're now exporting manufactured goods all<br />
over the world. I mean if I can just go one point, which comes<br />
out of Adelaide. One of the most exciting things that's happened<br />
to me as PM. Just go to this enterprise here, in Adelaide, which </p>
<p>PK ( cont'd: s is a manufacturer of optic lenses.<br />
SMITHi Sola Optical.<br />
PM: Yes, Sola Optical, I wasn't going in for advertisiinrg.<br />
Now I Just can't describe to you<br />
SMITHs I'm just getting used to sorne.<br />

market, and this Adelaide enterprise has over 50% of the United<br />
States market.<br />
SMITHS Do you think that's the beginning of this investment,<br />
this capital investment in plant and equipment that's supposed to<br />
increase our productive capacity.<br />
PM1 I don't think it, I know it. I mean we've got ' the<br />
situation now where under the Accord the Trade Union Movement h. 1as<br />
allowed a movement to profits which has moved into investment.<br />
We now have investment at the highest proportion of production<br />

efficient producers and exporters of steel in the world, and in<br />

steel industry, in co-operation with the workforce. The second,<br />
vell, an equally almost exciting thing of that here, Sola<br />
Optical, was going to the BHP steel works in Newcastle at the end<br />
of the last year, and there I met the management and workers<br />
together, enthusiastic, excited about what they were doing<br />
together. Management saying to me, look before this new periLod<br />

of export income for us. </p>
<p>SMITH: You may it's happening now. How long will it taike<br />
before we can say, good times are back here again. Is it going<br />
to be the turn of the century. I miean a lot of people are saying<br />
and writing that really this is a bit of a phoney campaign. Both<br />
sides are saying things are going to get better very, very<br />
quickly. PM: But let me when you say things are going to Slet<br />
better, sure there've been hard times with high interest rates<br />
over the recent period.<br />
SMITH: Are you saying they will come down.<br />
PM1 Even more importantly than I'm saying it# or that Paul<br />
Keating is saying it, the banking industry itself is saying thiat<br />
they will come down after the election. We've had to have high<br />
interest rates because we were growing that fast, and importing<br />
that much, that we couldn't sustain that level of imports but the<br />
banking industry has said, okay what you've done was right, it'Is<br />
working, and now the mortgage rates will come down.<br />
SMITH: 2%.<br />
PM: That's a decision which the banking sector has got to<br />
make, but the important thing is that we've got the policies in<br />
place, which are going to enable that to happen whereas if the<br />
Opposition were to get in with a wages explosion, and with<br />
blowing the budget surplus. See I've done what's never been done<br />
before with my colleagues. In the last three years a 17 billion<br />
dollar surplus. The Conservatives never got a surplus. Kow<br />
that's important in terms of economic policy and interest rates<br />
because that means we are reducing the goverrnent claim upon<br />
savings and that opens up a greater savings pool for the private<br />
sector so that reduces pressure on interest rates. But they're<br />
going to blow the budget surplus. 7 billion dollars. I mean<br />
S tfhroemy ' reth es ayeilnegc titoon , y ouorh ldisetaern elriss, t eannedr sw eo'rfe Voninlyc enfotu r Smdaiytsh aawnady<br />
electors of Australia generally, please you know, buy us on<br />
trust, we've 7 billion dollars of promises, which we haven't<br />
funded, we either blow the surplus or cut your benefits<br />
massively.* Now they must blow the surplus by increasing the<br />
outlays and also by giving billions of dollars back from the<br />
public revenue and shovelling billions of dollars into the<br />
po'aets of the wealthiest 1 per cent. Now that's a recipe for<br />
economic disaster.<br />
SMITH: But on the other hand you're also asking people to take<br />
you on trust, on your record-<br />
PM: On the contrary, on the contrary. I said with Keating<br />
last year, I said, look I'm neither a masochist nor a sadist, I </p>
<p>PM ( cont'd) i certainly don't want to hurt myself, 1 much more I<br />
don't want to hurt Australians. I mean I haven't spent 30 years<br />
in public life and now wanting to hurt Australians unnecessarily.<br />
But we had the simple fact that in the last year we increased our<br />
consumption by 8% and our production by 4% and we just brought<br />
the rest in by imports so we had to slow things down. And I s'aid<br />
to the people of Australia last year, this is why I've got toi do<br />
its I've got to do it to slow things down somewhat, but I said I<br />
guarantee you that that will work, we'll slow things down and. we<br />
can bring interest rates down. Before this election started, the<br />
Reserve Bank brought the prime rates down and now the banking<br />
industry is saying yes, the policies are working and mortgage<br />
rates will come down after the election. They're saying it.<br />
SMITH: 2%?<br />
PM: Well, it would be unfair for me to say it will be 2%.<br />
1 believe that the forces are there, that is the reduction in<br />
demand, and the lowering in the cost of money to the banks, that<br />
means they must bring it down, now the amount that they bring<br />
mortgage rates down by will be determined within the ' banking<br />
industry. But I think it will be a significant figure and it<br />
will be sustainable.<br />
SMITU: When money gets cheaper, doesn't that increase demand<br />
beyon'd our production level-<br />
PM: No, no, no. The important thing is that we are having<br />
restraint in wages, restraint in wages, we're not going to be<br />
having a great boost, an enormous boost, in real disposab,) le<br />
income, it's going to be an increase in real terms, but what<br />
we're going to be doing, our efforts, our activity, will be more<br />
and more going into net exports. I mean this is what's happening<br />
now that Australia's productive activity, the increase in our<br />
productive capacity which comes from having more people in work,<br />
and higher investment, it means that we've got more Australians,<br />
better trained and better equipped at wo,' rk and that productive<br />
activity is going to be more and more channeled into exports.<br />
SMITH: Our first caller.<br />
CALLER. I'm waiting on a thing from the Taxation Dept answering<br />
my accountant, and it's taking a hell of a long while to go<br />
thxpugh, waiting on the ruling and<br />
PM: Clare, could I just interrupt you# there's no way just<br />
on air like this that we'd be able to settle this, but could I<br />
give you this undertaking. If you'd send the details of your<br />
concern into Vincent, and I'll have it sent on, I'll give you my<br />
personal undertaking. </p>
<p>CALLER: Well we're still waiting and I'll tell you in a couple<br />
of minutes why should you have to pay Medicare levy back to 1978<br />
when it didn't come in until the 1 of February 1984 on your<br />
retiring allowance.<br />
SMITH: You shouldn't.<br />
PM: And you're not being asked to.<br />
CALLER: I've great respect for yourself and I don't wish to<br />
belittle you but I say to you, would it be possible for you to<br />
answer my question without all the statistics. I appreciate your<br />
skills in the economic division. I'm asking you if you could<br />
help small business. ' What are you going to do when the election<br />
is over to stop this high interest rates of banks, so that we can<br />
continue to employ our staff. In Adelaide we ate forced to put<br />
off staff at the moment. Small business with a staff of three,<br />
and having to reduce our part-time labor. If you continue to<br />
allow these high interest rates that permeate through the small<br />
business section to continue, it will go too far.<br />
PM: That's right Arthur, and that's why it'. not going to<br />
go further. I hope you were listening before and I won't throw<br />
statistics at you, Arthur, I do that when I think they're<br />
relevant to a question, but let me say this to you; that we had<br />
to have a high interest rates during last year, the reasonsi I<br />
put, I won't repeat the statistics, but we were simply consuming<br />
more than we were producing and that meant we were pulling in<br />
more imports than we could sustain, so I've had to have hiLgh<br />
interest rates to slow the economy down somewhat, but<br />
importantly, Arthur, that's been achieved nov and the banks are<br />
saying that they will be lowering interest rates, as you kftow<br />
already the commercial rates that are relevant to the bank's<br />
decisions, they have come down in this year, over 2 percentage<br />
points, and they have made it quite clear to the people of<br />
Australia that rates generally will be coming down, because we've<br />
got in place the policies which will enable that to happen. I<br />
can assure you, Arthur, that we are going to continue to grow,<br />
the economy is going to continue to grov, but as I was sayinq a<br />
little while ago to Vincent, what we've all got to do and I<br />
appreciate very much the role that small business plays in thiLswe've<br />
got to more and more direct our activities in a way which<br />
is going to enable us to substitute our own production for<br />
im~ prts and also increase our exports because that's what's viltal<br />
to-dealinq with our external problem. I can assure you, Arthur,<br />
that the rates will be coming down after the election.<br />
CALLER: Can I come back to you Mr Prime Minister. Well, what<br />
about a tip for Sandown races today, you're an expert in that<br />
field too.<br />
SMITHtSWMaIrTwHi: c k Farm, Peacock is scratched in the second race. </p>
<p>PM: If I had a paper in front of me, I'd give you a ' tip<br />
mate, I'm sorry I haven't got one in front of me.<br />
CALLER a I want to speak to you in relation to your Immigration<br />
policy. In Adelaide we've been fairly quiet backward sort of<br />
country, sort of State, with the introduction of the<br />
SMITHt Michael turn your radio off.<br />
CALLER# We're getting a lot of drug problems now in Adelaide<br />
now that we've opened up the state a lot, obviously it's coming<br />
from overseas, could you tighten your policy up with immigration.<br />
SMITH: Do you think we're not screening immigrants.<br />
PM: Michael, you're not on the ball there mate. And I must<br />
say while that there's been a lot of disagreement between Andrew<br />
Peacock and myself on basic issues in this campaign, as I<br />
understand it Mr Peacock's position is no different from ours on<br />
immigration and I applaud him for that in that I think he agrees<br />
with the level of immigration that we've got now, and if anything<br />
he'd want to increase it somewhat. We have tightened all our<br />
procedures in regard to ensuring that the people who come here<br />
are going to be appropriate citizens and they are proving to be<br />
that. You may be interested to know something I've Just<br />
announced today, Michael. What we've done is to announce the<br />
establishment of a statutory criminal asset trust fund and that<br />
to put it in simple terms, all the proceeds from crime that we<br />
get on convictions of criminal and under the drug-trafficking<br />
provisions of the Customs Act, we're going to turn those, mll<br />
that we get back from criminals will be divided up, 50% going<br />
into the law enforcement agencies, and 50% going to programs for<br />
the rehabilitation of drug users so that in increasing our fight<br />
against crime in general and drug related of fences in particular,<br />
we're going to make the criminals cough-up their ill-gotten gains<br />
out of that, and that will go into the trust fund so that we can<br />
even further strengthen our law enforcement agencies and the<br />
pro 7, rams to help the rehabilitation of drug users. So I hope<br />
you d agree with that.<br />
CALLE. R: Yeah, I do, I think that's one of the best things thiat<br />
come out, it's excellent.<br />
CAJ. XLER t I've just been a bit concerned recently about all the<br />
tafl about health policy. This is perhaps not as much in regard<br />
to your own party but particularly the Coalition's policies or<br />
lack thereof, as the case may be, they've talked a lot about the<br />
problems that we've had with Medicare, I still think it's better<br />
to have it than not, I was just wondering if you could tell me<br />
what you're planning to do I heard Dr Blewett speak, he said<br />
that there will be improvements made if you could just outline<br />
some of them. </p>
<p>PM: Well basically, what we'll continue to do Jo. is what<br />
we've done in the and that is to keep the basics of Medicare<br />
in place and the basic is that there be equity and universality.<br />
Equity that means Jo, that I because I get a relatively high<br />
salary, will pay more than I guess you do, I'm sure my salary<br />
would be higher than yours, I don't know what It is but I should<br />
pay more, and we'll keep that principle that those like PM's and<br />
business executive. and so on who have got higher salaries, by<br />
paying our 1. 25% we will pay more and so we should so that will<br />
mean that everyone in the community will continue to be covered<br />
and we will never have it returned to that situation thalt I<br />
inherited as PM, where 2 million Australians simply weren't<br />
covered for hospital, medical bills, so it will be equitable and<br />
it will be universal. The other thing of course that we wiLll<br />
continue to do, Jo, is what we've done over 7 years we'll<br />
Continue to consult with the States and with the people who are<br />
actually involved in the medical system doctors, nurses and so<br />
on, so that where there can be points of refinement, improvement,<br />
that will be done.<br />
CALLERt That sounds great, better than the other lot.<br />
CALLMR I haven't been unemployed for very long, about a monith,<br />
and I've listened to your speeches about training programs, they<br />
sound very interesting and I would like to know, are you going to<br />
put a lot on because I'm looking f or a job as hard as I can,<br />
and these training programs are they going to be good enough to<br />
get you a job sort of thing.<br />
SMITHs Will they give you a ticket, is that what you're<br />
asking. PM: What we've tried to do mate is to have a range of<br />
programs because there's a range of people that need to be dealt<br />
with. There will be some who come with sort of no experience of<br />
S wthoerkm waet' vael lg, o ta npdr ogsormame s wwihtihc hn oa rtee cchanliccualla teqdu atloi fgiicvaet iothnoss e spoe opfloer<br />
some sort of sense of confidence in themselves and the beginning<br />
of understanding of what's involved in various types of work.<br />
One of the programs that, one of the newer programs that we've<br />
developed is SkillShare which I've seen around Australia now,<br />
it's remarkable because what happens there is that people are<br />
brought in who for one reason or another, haven't had much<br />
ex~ erience of work, who might have some sort of disability, and<br />
pebtle in the community who have themselves been tradesmen or wpho<br />
know how to deal with people, and they are, these community<br />
organisations are working with people to give them confidence and<br />
experience. There's a range, in other words of programs, to<br />
fit the needs of particular individuals. And I think that you<br />
will find can I give you this specific recommendation how old<br />
are you by the way? </p>
<p>CALLER: I'm 21.<br />
PM: What you ought to do is go to the Commonwealth<br />
Employment Service and ask them, just tell them exactly what<br />
you're background is and you lot them know what your interests<br />
are and I can guarantee you that out of the range of programs<br />
that are available there, they will be able to point you to<br />
something which will be of assistance to you.<br />
CALLERs It seems like the opposition's not really<br />
SMITH: Come back to us if -he doesn't.<br />
PM: Yes he can. Well the Opposition want to scrap most of<br />
these programs.<br />
CALLER: They want nothing to do with the unemployment.<br />
PM: What they're saying is I mean there's is heartless, I<br />
mean after 9 months they just throw people out of the scheme,<br />
what we say is yes, people haven't got an automatic right to a<br />
dole, and that's going to be ended. But what they have a right<br />
to from the community, is access to training programs, and that's<br />
what we'll give them.<br />
SMITH: That's about all we have time for, for calls. PM just<br />
one question I wanted to ask you while you're going through the<br />
Bandown form.<br />
PM. a No, no, it's only because it's been put in f ront of me<br />
and I've been asked to give a tip. Look this is done without<br />
prejudice, and on the basis that I haven't really had a chance<br />
to study it closely, but I don'It know what price this one<br />
is. Have a little bit each way on Rave Report in the last at<br />
Warwick Farm, just a little bit. I haven't been able to study it<br />
closely, or at all. It's got a bit of a it" a way over Ithe<br />
odds I think probably.<br />
SMITHs As I said, Peacock is a scratching at Warwick Faim.<br />
But I wanted to ask how you feel asking people for a second<br />
preference vote, not for a primary vote, given the strength of<br />
the alternatives.<br />
PKI Well I feel this way. What's happening in Australia is<br />
hajpening all around the world, particularly in regard to the<br />
environment; that people are saying that's the issue that<br />
concerns them most of all, and so, more people than before aire<br />
casting their first preference for the party or parties which<br />
they think are very, very much environment oriented. Now that<br />
may be the Democrats, it may be actual direct Green candidates.<br />
What I say to them is this. A, I share your concern about. the<br />
environment; and B, if that is your overwhelming concern then you </p>
<p>PM ( cont'd) i must cast your second preference for the one of the<br />
two parties that's going to form govtF which has got the best<br />
environment record. And there's simply no doubt about that, the<br />
Australian Conservation Foundation, the wilderness Society, have<br />
made it clear, that to use their words, ' Labor is head arid<br />
shoulders above the Coalition', and well may they make that<br />
judgement because look at<br />
SMITH: But why aren't you then saying well cast your firift<br />
votes PM: Well I would prefer it, I'd prefer it. I mean I wou: ld<br />
ask them to cast your first vote, but if they are saying we just<br />
want to register our real concern about environment by casting a<br />
Green vote 1, or Democrats, then, and this is a free society,, if<br />
that's they want to do, okay, I prefer they voted for me 1, but<br />
I'm saying to them, according to their own criteria then, if the<br />
environment is the most important consideration, remember, that<br />
it was Hawke and Labor, who saved the Franklin against the<br />
Opposition of the Liberals anid National Party. It was Hawke and<br />
Labor who saved the Daintree from logging against the opposition<br />
of the Liberals and the National Party. it was Hawks and Labor<br />
who saved the Kakadu from mining against the Liberals and the<br />
National Party. It was Hawks and Labor, who saved the tall<br />
forests of Tasmania against the opposition of the Liberals and<br />
the National Party. So I'm saying to them okay, if you insist on<br />
casting your first vote on environmental grounds for someone<br />
else, make sure that your effective preference is for Labor,<br />
because the AC?, the Wilderness Society, they all say, properly,<br />
that we are head and shoulders, head and shoulders above the<br />
Opposition. SMITH: Just very, very quickly, how importantly do you ralte<br />
newspaper support, one way or the other. A couple of Murdoch<br />
papers have come out in support<br />
4 PM: Frankly I don't think editorials I think they<br />
hardly change your vote. What's much miore important as far as<br />
newspapers are concerned is that they give you a fair coverage<br />
during the campaign. That's the important thing. If you get a<br />
fair coverage from the newspapers during the campaign, that's<br />
what counts, and if I mean I would rather have them saying vote<br />
Labor in their editorial, than not, I'd prefer that, but I don't<br />
think it really affects many votes.<br />
SMITHt Thank you.<br />
