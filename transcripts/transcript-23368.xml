    <content><![CDATA[<p>I pay tribute to our Governor General, for serving this country with grace, dignity and style.</p>
<p>Your Excellency, you came to the highest office in our land after a long and distinguished career as a legal academic, as the federal sex discrimination commissioner, as the principal of womenâs college at Sydney University and as the Governor of Queensland.</p>
<p>Still, you were no stuffy or aloof viceroy. During one of your visits to Afghanistan you met a young soldier who was celebrating his 21st birthday. You leant over, kissed him on the cheek and said, âHappy Birthday, thatâs on behalf of your mother.â In a way only a military man could, he smiled and replied, âBut Maâam, I miss my grandmother too.â So, the two kisses that he received made this young soldierâs day as he was serving our nation thousands of kilometres from home.</p>
<p>Your Excellency, you have supported a vast range of good causes and community organisations. Indeed, all of the 318 bodies of which you are Patron have recorded a message for this evening. We are not going to play all of them, but we will play a selection.</p>
<p>Your passion nevertheless has been for the advancement of women, young people and education. On one occasion you invited Girls for Oz â a performing arts group from remote communities â to what they called a âsleep-overâ at Admiralty House and the joy was so complete that they promptly danced on the harbour side lawns for the benefit of the passing sailors.</p>
<p>Many years ago, it is said, the then Governor-General Sir William Slim and the then Deputy Prime Minister Sir Arthur Fadden were on a tour in outback Queensland. It was a hot day so they stopped at a pub and were soon talking with a local.</p>
<p>When the Deputy Prime Minister at some stage excused himself the local asked Sir William Slim who exactly was their companion. âOh,â he said. âThatâs Sir Arthur Fadden, Deputy Prime Minister of Australia.â</p>
<p>âWell, blow me down,â said the local to the Governor-General. âWhat a country we live in. Here is the Deputy Prime Minister having a beer with two ordinary blokes like us.â</p>
<p>Your Excellency, on the only recorded occasion when you have entered a pub you were much better recognised than your predecessor. It was Australia Day 2011 in the Lockyer Valley â a sombre celebration for the survivors of the inland tsunami and the local Mayor said you were âa tower of strength to our community and to me personally.â</p>
<p>For five years you have been with Australia in good times and bad â in our joy and in our grief. On four occasions you have held in your hands the Victoria Cross before presenting it to an Australian hero â in one case to the family of a fallen hero.</p>
<p>When asked what you have most enjoyed about your role you have typically answered, âtoday, because every day has brought me into contact with wonderful people.â</p>
<p>Well, Your Excellency, Australians may have inspired you but you have certainly inspired us.</p>
<p>Your presence and your example has helped us to come closer to being our best selves.</p>
<p>Last year, particularly, your year of three Prime Ministers, I suspect that Australians may have fixed their gaze on Yarralumla and thought âthank God there is at least one adult left in our system of Government.â</p>
<p>Your Excellency, you have been magnificently supported by Michael, one of our countryâs finest architects and the principal design adviser to the Sydney Olympics. But with the family instinct for duty and service, indeed, I understand that on some Vice Regal occasions in Brisbane Michael could be found directing traffic in the uniform of the State Emergency Services.</p>
<p>Your Excellency, you have had a life of exemplary public service.</p>
<p>Your new office at the Queensland University of Technology suggests more teaching and more encouragement for young Australians.</p>
<p>It is typical, entirely typical, that you requested support for the Clontarf Foundation rather than a farewell gift.</p>
<p>Ladies and gentleman, Australiaâs first female Governor-General has added mightily to the lustre of this great office.</p>
<p>Dame Quentin Bryce, I salute you.</p>
