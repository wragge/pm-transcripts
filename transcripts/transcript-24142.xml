    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Commonwealth Government extends its deepest condolences to the Government and people of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia on the death of King Abdullah bin Abdulaziz al-Saud.</p>
<p>King Abdullah was a key architect of Saudi Arabiaâs economic and political development. Amongst his many achievements, he oversaw the transformation of the Kingdomâs economy, presided over the first municipal elections, and supported an expanded role for the consultative Shura Council, including the appointment of women.</p>
<p>The King also placed a major emphasis on education, particularly as patron of the visionary King Abdullah Scholarship Programme. Many of the recipients of the scholarship programme have studied at Australian education institutions.</p>
<p>The King was also a strong proponent of international interfaith dialogue.</p>
<p>May he rest in peace.</p>
