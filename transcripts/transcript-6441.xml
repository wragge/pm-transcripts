PRIME MINISTER CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
LAUNCHING OF IRON ORE INDUSTRY CONSULTATIVE COUNCIL<br />
KARRATHA 11 AUGUST 1984<br />
Today we are formally launchi-ng a new mechanism for<br />
consultation amongst unions, business and Governments<br />
involved in the Pilbara region's great iron ore industry.<br />
We are doing this at a time when the iron ore industry is<br />
facing the opportunity of a return to strong growth after a<br />
decade of stagnation and several years of decline.<br />
These new opportunities for growth will be fully realised<br />
only if all of us involved in the industry's future work<br />
together. The new Consultative Council will help us to work together<br />
effectively. It will help us to achieve for this industry and this region<br />
what Australians are seeking to achieve throughout our<br />
economy and society.<br />
And our success here depends on the same considerations as<br />
those which will determine our success in lifting our<br />
national economic performance on the effective employment<br />
of our human and natural resources in their most productive<br />
uses; on our application of the world's best technology,<br />
sometimes by developing new technology ourselves, and<br />
sometimes by absorbing it from abroad; on high levels of<br />
investment from home and abroad; on our making effective use<br />
of opportunities for profitable international trade,<br />
expecially in our Western Pacific region where economies are<br />
expanding more rapidly than any in the world; and above all<br />
on our working together Commonwealth and State<br />
Governments, unions, and business working together to find<br />
solutions to the problems which inevitably arise in the<br />
pursuit of growth. </p>
<p>In our free society, we cannot expect people to accept the<br />
strains and costs of change and growth unless the benefits<br />
of growth are Bhared equitably. This requires fair taxation<br />
and social security arrangements and strong growth in<br />
employment. The approach to these issues that emerged from the Summit,<br />
built around the Prices snd Incomes Accord between the<br />
Australian Labor Party and the Australian trade union<br />
movement, has been bearing impressive fruit for the national<br />
economy. During the financial year that has just ended, we have seen<br />
the fastest growth in total production since national<br />
accounts have been compiled in Australia; the greatest<br />
growth in employment in our history, with 234,000 new jobs<br />
being created within the year; and the lowest rate of<br />
consumer price increases for over a decade, even after the<br />
exclusion of the effects of Medicare.<br />
The successful operation of the Prices and Incomes Accord<br />
promises continued strong growth in output and employment<br />
and continued progress in reducing inflation in the year<br />
ahead. Our coming Budget has been framed with a view to<br />
making the most of these possibilities.<br />
These national efforts must be supported by special efforts<br />
in every region and industry.<br />
And from the iron ore industry in the Pilbara we look for an<br />
especially important contribution.<br />
Your industry was hit even more severely than others by the<br />
recession which dragged Australia down in the early 1980' s.<br />
The industry was damaged by the combination of adverse<br />
international market conditions with conflict and<br />
underperformance at home. Over a number of years the result<br />
was a declining share of static or declining markets.<br />
Inevitably this led to declining and increasingly insecure<br />
employment, inadequate profitability, low investment and<br />
pessimism in the Australian industry.<br />
Already this outlook is changing, partly as a result of what<br />
we have been able to do together.<br />
The steel industry in the world, in our region and in<br />
Australia is recovering more rapidly than anyone expected a<br />
year ago. A more co-operative industrial relations<br />
environment over the last ten months has improved our<br />
competitiveness and enhanced our reputation as a reliable<br />
supplier. After years of stagnation and decline, it is possible that<br />
we will achieve higher levels of production and export in<br />
1984 than ever before. </p>
<p>At home, the outlook for the domestic steel industry for<br />
production, investment, security of employment and<br />
profitability has improved dramatically within the<br />
framework of the steel industry plan which we announced a<br />
year ago. This plan, asgenerously recognised in B. H. P.' a<br />
national advertising a couple of weeks ago, demonstrates<br />
what can be achieved by co-operation amongst unions,<br />
management, and State and Commonwealth Governments.<br />
Abroad, the outlook is still dominated by conditions in our<br />
major market, Japan. Economic recovery in Japan is being<br />
accompanied by increased steel production, from last year's<br />
depressed 97 million tonnes, possibly to around 105 million<br />
tonnes this year.<br />
Just as importantly for us, recently we ha've been securing a<br />
higher share of the Japanese market in the June quarter a<br />
little over 50 per cent, the highest for many years.<br />
When I was in Japan early this year, Prime Minister Nakasone<br />
assured me that Australia's position as a supplier to the<br />
Japanese market would be maintained so long as we remained a<br />
competitive and reliable supplier. In Japan, to Mr Nakasone<br />
and his Ministers as well as to business, I stressed the<br />
increased efforts that Australians were making to resolve<br />
conflict through co-operation rather than confrontation and<br />
the effect that this would have on our competitiveness and<br />
our reliability as a supplier. My own representations have<br />
been supported by the greatly improved state of industrial<br />
relations in the nation, where the statistics have been<br />
showing consistently the lowest proportions of time lost in<br />
industrial disputes since monthly data were first collected<br />
in 1970, and by an improved industrial relations environment<br />
in this region.<br />
Similarly, we have done well from the strong recent growth<br />
in South Korean production of steel and use of iron ore. It<br />
became clear in my visit to South Korea in February, . that<br />
perceptions of Australia as an unreliable supplier had been<br />
severely damaging our interests. Our improved performance<br />
over the last ten months has been having its effects, but we<br />
must build on this over long periods if we are to realise<br />
fully the potential of this market.<br />
There has been impressive progress in our trade with China<br />
since February, when Premier Zhao and I established the<br />
Australia-Chins Iron and Steel Industry Joint Study Group.<br />
Already contracts have been signed for increased sales of<br />
iron ore from the Pilbara. Yesterday the Deputy Prime<br />
Minister and Minister for Trade, Lionel Bowen, signed on<br />
behalf of Australia an agreement with China for technical<br />
cooperation on iron and steel. </p>
<p>This treaty will provide a framework for close co-operation<br />
across a wide range of activities in the iron and steel<br />
industries trade in steel-making raw materials, including<br />
iron ore; joint ventures between Australian and Chinese<br />
interests in iron ore making and steel production; trade in<br />
processed iron and steel; and mutual technical assistance in<br />
iron and steel production.<br />
Lost night's agreement between the CRA group and China on<br />
the feasibility study for the Channar deposit, could lead to<br />
the first new mine development in the Pilbara since the<br />
first decade of export-oriented expansion that ended in the<br />
early 19701s. The co-operation between China and Australia<br />
at Channar, which would create large numbers of jobs both in<br />
the construction and production phases, symbolises the new<br />
opportunities open to us if we work together to strengthen<br />
our competitive position.<br />
The continuation of strong economic growth in the ASEAN<br />
countries and the beginnings of recovery in Europe are also<br />
opening new opportunities.. . The Australian industry has done<br />
particularly well recently in sales* to the Federal Republic<br />
of Germany. In these new, and in the case of Europe<br />
distant, markets, it is even more crucial that we strengthen<br />
our competitive position.<br />
The impressive early development of our mines was on a large<br />
scale and this coupled with our high grade ore were factors<br />
which initially enabled us to enter the Japanese market so<br />
successfully. The industry was responsible for the creation of large<br />
modern social and industrial infrastructure, which helped to<br />
attract the workforce of 8000 into the Pilbara.<br />
To maintain its present competitive position the industry is<br />
conscious that it needs to concentrate on quality control<br />
and reduction-in operating costs including the entrenchment<br />
of the present good industrial relations. The recent<br />
deepening of the ports at Dampier and Cape Lambert and the<br />
letting of contracts for deepening at Port Hedland will<br />
allow ships up to 270,000 DWT capacity to load, thus<br />
significantly upgrading all three ports and leading to<br />
further efficiency gains.<br />
The benefits of increased sales of iron ore are already<br />
being felt by people in the Pilbara. After a period of job<br />
insecurity, in which there was no confidence even that<br />
apprentices trained in the industry would find secure<br />
employment, new jobs have been appearing. Since the<br />
beginning of the year, major producers have increased<br />
employment up to 5 per cent. </p>
<p>While we are undoubtedly facing exciting new prospects for<br />
expansion, we should be under no illusions about the highly<br />
competitive environment in which we are working.<br />
Prospective growth in Asian markets is as attractive to our<br />
largest competitors, particularly Brazil and India, as it is<br />
to us.<br />
Brazil is developing enormous new reserves of iron ore at<br />
Carajas in the Amazon basin. These reserves are being<br />
developed particularly for the Japanese market. When ore<br />
shipments commence around this time next year they will<br />
greatly increase the total supply of iron ore available to<br />
the Japanese.<br />
India is also making determined efforts to regain some of<br />
the market share they have lost in Japan over the last<br />
years. The Indian Government is reported to be willing to<br />
undertake the investment necessary to make India a<br />
competitive and dependable supplier of iron ore.<br />
The benefits of strong growth in the industry to all its<br />
participants cannot be over-stated.<br />
Only an expanding, profitable industry can provide secure<br />
employment. Only an expanding, profitable industry can provide<br />
employment within the region for the children of the<br />
industry's workers. These are becoming more important with<br />
increases in the proportion of the population of these towns<br />
that has lived here long enough for their children to be<br />
seeking work in the Pilbara.<br />
Only an expanding, profitable industry can support the<br />
improvements in conditions over time to which workers<br />
aspire. The achievement of increased investment and production in<br />
the iron ore industry, as in the national economy as a<br />
whole, requires successful action on many fronts.<br />
Underpinning the whole effort must be co-operative<br />
industrial relations, based on shared perspectives about the<br />
industry and its prospects.<br />
For several years now I have felt a sense of tragedy that we<br />
have too often dissipated our great opportunities as a<br />
nation in fruitless, counter-productive disputation between<br />
the great elements of our industrial structure. </p>
<p>This feeling on my part has not been associated with the<br />
equally fruitless process of bl ame-al location; but rather a<br />
sense of frustration that these great elements have not<br />
grasped an essential truth i. e. that their legitimate<br />
aspirations on the one hand for improved standards and on<br />
the other for improved profitability should not be seen as<br />
mutually antagonistic, but more likely of mutual achievement<br />
through co-operation rather than confrontation.<br />
I emphasise that in the iron ore industry, as in the<br />
national economy, co-operative industrial relations does not<br />
mean that any party must abandon its essential interests.<br />
Indeed, as I have said, the workers' essential interests in<br />
secure and expanding employment, at high standards which<br />
improve over time, and investors' legitimate interests in<br />
earning satisfactory profits, can be realised efficiently<br />
only through such co-operation.<br />
I believe that when all parties have a clear understanding<br />
of the economic constraints under which they are operating,<br />
many disputes can be avoided at the same time as both<br />
workers and management realise more of their own aims.<br />
No-one pretends that the unhappy history of industrial<br />
relations in this region will be corrected overnight with<br />
the establishment of this Council.<br />
Problems will arise, and some will be difficult to solve.<br />
But they can be fewer and less damaging than in the past.<br />
Some earlier Australian Governments have seen narrow<br />
political advantage in blaming one side in industrial<br />
relations problems, and in exaggerating the impact of these<br />
problems on our nation's reliability as a supplier.<br />
This exaggeration for narrow political purposes has in<br />
itself damaged the iron ore industry and the Australian<br />
national interest.<br />
But while deploring these distortions of the past, our eyes<br />
should be open to the real damage that has been done by<br />
industrial instability. An improved capacity to resolve<br />
conflict without disruption of production would have a large<br />
and positive impact on the growth of production and<br />
employment. We should not limit our ambitions in this industry to<br />
expansion of our traditional role as a supplier of<br />
unprocessed raw materials to international markets. There<br />
is substantial growth potential some of it in the Pilbara<br />
in further processing. </p>
<p>We have unique natural advantages in the processing of iron<br />
ore, through the presence here of exceptionally high quality<br />
deposits of the energy resources which are complementary to<br />
our iron ore in steel-making.<br />
There are good long-term prospects for us to establish a<br />
major place for ourselves in international markets for<br />
processed iron and crude steel.<br />
But here, even more than in iron ore production, there is a<br />
premium on high productivity, competitiveness and supply<br />
reliability. Unlike mining, iron processing can be located either at the<br />
market or at the source of the raw material, depending on<br />
relative costs of production at the two locations, as well<br />
as transport costs.<br />
The strong productivity gains in Australian steel-making so<br />
far under the Steel Industry Plan are an important first<br />
step towards improving the competitive position of iron and<br />
steel making in Australia.<br />
But we must not confine ourselves to thinking about<br />
traditional iron and steel-making technologies.<br />
It may be that the proximity here in the Pilbara of<br />
exceptionally rich deposits of natural gas and iron ore will<br />
provide an avenue into internationally competitive iron<br />
processing using direct reduction techniques.<br />
It may be that the best possibilities will emerge at the<br />
frontier of steel-making technology, for example through the<br />
techniques of direct reduction from coal which have been a<br />
focus of research and development investment by one<br />
Australian company, CRA.<br />
Superior natural resources, application of the world's best<br />
technology, co-operative relations between unions,<br />
management and Governments, and an effective trade policy<br />
linked productively to domestic industry policy, are the<br />
keys to future expansion of iron processing, as they are to<br />
expanded sales of iron ore.<br />
We have given high priority to the trade policy requirements<br />
of expansion in processing and other manufacturing<br />
industries. The building of confidence in bilateral<br />
economic realtionships is of great importance, and an<br />
important part of my visit to Northeast and Southeast Asia<br />
earlier this year was directed to this end.<br />
Australia's efforts to promote regional co-operation in a<br />
new round of multilateral trade negotiations seek to<br />
establish international trading rules which allow our most<br />
productive industries to compete on equal terms with those<br />
of other countries. </p>
<p>The domestic industry policy requirements are varied and<br />
complex. Much depends on our maintaining a general<br />
environment of interest rates, exchange rates and costs that<br />
is conducive to high levels of investment. But successful<br />
macro-economic management which will be advanced<br />
significantly in the coming Budget is not enough on its<br />
own. Taxation policy must be conducive to the encouragement of<br />
productive investment. Aspects of this for example<br />
questions of depreciation provisions within the corporate<br />
income tax have been the subject of discussions within the<br />
Economic Planning Advisory Council and the Manufacturing<br />
Industry Council in recent months.<br />
Community discussion and analysis of these issues has not<br />
yet proceeded far enough for clear positions on what is<br />
required to emerge, but these are clearly major issues on<br />
the agenda of industry policy. Expansion of our own<br />
internationally competitive production obviously requires<br />
acceptance in Australia of expansion of other countries'<br />
most productive industries and willingness to accept gradual<br />
structural adjustment at home.<br />
As is clear from our approach to the steel and motor vehicle<br />
industries, the Government sees policy in these areas as<br />
properly requiring close consultation and co-operation<br />
amongst interested parties.<br />
In all of these areas, we as a nation must have clear<br />
long-term objectives. We must seek to overcome the<br />
impediments to internationally competitive processing in<br />
Australia in time to take advantage of opportunities for<br />
investment that will arise as growth and structural change<br />
removes the current over-hang of world processing capacity<br />
later in this decade.<br />
Let me say that I believe that the fundamental elements<br />
already exist in the iron ore industry, and potentially in<br />
the processing industries, for the strong expansion of<br />
production and employment based on this region's rich iron<br />
ore resources. It is in the cultivation and enhancement of<br />
these essential elements that the Iron Ore Consultative<br />
Council will prove to be most beneficial.<br />
In providing a forum for wide ranging discussions of matters<br />
affecting the iron ore industry, the workings of the Council<br />
should contribute to improved understanding between the<br />
parties of their respective problems and aspirations,<br />
thereby fostering the continuation of a good industrial<br />
relations climate in the industry. It will take some time<br />
to develop the full potential of this process, and success<br />
will depend a great deal upon the members establishing<br />
mutual respect for each others points of view. </p>
<p>9.<br />
Whilst it is not intended that the Council will displace the<br />
traditional rights of the parties to the industrial<br />
relations system, it is anticipated that improved<br />
communication between those involved in the industry will<br />
bring about a more co-operative approach to solving<br />
problems. The establishment of the Council has been the result of<br />
considerable efforts by many individuals and groups. It is<br />
a credit to those individuals that we are here today in a<br />
spirit of goodwill to witness the commencement of the<br />
Council. I would particularly like to thank Senator Cook,<br />
as my personal representative, for his consistent work on my<br />
behalf in working to establish the Council.<br />
I wish it every success for the future, for the sake of<br />
people working in the iron ore industry, of the people<br />
living in the Pilbara, and of the whole Australian<br />
community. </p>
