    <content><![CDATA[<p>Prime Minister: Now we're here at the Lodge today and I'd like to welcome members of the Wallace family, the Kennett family, the Fowler family, and family and friends of donors and donor recipients.</p>
<p>On average, people on the transplant list wait between six months and four years. Two people die each week waiting for a transplant. So far this year 189 generous Australians became organ donors resulting in a new chance at life for 608 Australians.</p>
<p>To those Australian families who said yes to donation, we thank you for making the decision to give others a special and deeply personal gift.</p>
<p>It's people like Liz, people like Lachie and people like the Kennetts who have inspired the Government's $151 million organ donation reform package. This national reform program is spearheaded by the Australian Organ and Tissue Authority.</p>
<p>Now when people ask Lachie how's he feeling he replies "I've never felt better" and he's having swimming lessons three times a week, and he's trying to gain enough strength and weight to get back on the footy field. We wish you luck mate and hope to see you flying down the wing very, very soon.</p>
<p>The Donate Life network is central to our efforts to increase Australia's rate of organ donation for transplantation. But improving our donation rate doesn't fall on the shoulders of these dedicated medical professionals alone. The burden also falls on us - each and every Australian family.</p>
<p>Discover the facts about organ and tissue donation, make an informed choice and decide to become an organ donor, and discuss with family and friends so that each of you know the other's wishes.</p>
<p>We can increase the family consent rates by ensuring that our family know our wishes and we know theirs. Talking is the key to this, that's why we're gathered here today. Therese and the kids and I have had that chat as a family and we've decided to become a Donate Life family.</p>
<p>As a Donate Life family we've committed to discussing and upholding each other's wishes. And our invitation today to all families in Australia is come and join us. This is good for your neighbours, it's good for your friends, it's good for all Australians.</p>
