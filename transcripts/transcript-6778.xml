PRIME MINISTER<br />
CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY<br />
TO THE ROTARY CONFERENCE<br />
SYDNEY -9 NOVEMBER 1985.<br />
DISTINGUISHED GUESTS<br />
ROTARIANS I AM INDEED PLEASED TO BE HERE TODAY AT THE ANNUAL<br />
CONFERENCE OF ROTARY DISTRICT 975. I UNDERSTAND THAT YOUR<br />
DISTRICT COVERS A GOOD STRETCH OF THE MAGNIFICENT NEW SOUTH<br />
WALES COASTLINE, FROM SOUTH OF THE HARBOUR TO KIAMA.<br />
COVERING SUCH AN AREA, I CAN APPRECIATE THAT ANNUAL<br />
CONFERENCES REPRESENT ONE OF THE FEW OPPORTUNITIES FOR SOME.<br />
OF YOUR TWO AND A HALF THOUSAND MEMBERS, REPRESENTING OVER<br />
CLUBS, TO MEET AND EXCHANGE IDEAS.<br />
ON THIS OCCASION YOUR CHOICE OF THEME, THE CHALLENGE OF<br />
CHANGE, IS AN IMMENSE AND DIVERSE TOPIC. BUT IT IS ONE<br />
WHICH IS OF GREAT IMPORTANCE TO OUR SOCIETY AND IS CERTAINLY<br />
AN ISSUE WHICH IS OF GREAT INTEREST TO THE GOVERNMENT AND TO<br />
MYSELF. IN 1979, WHEN PRESENTING THE BOYER LECTURES, I ARGUED THAT<br />
OUR SOCIETY HAS BEEN, AND STILL IS BEING, OVERWHELMED BY<br />
CHANGES OF DIMENSIONS ALMOST BEYOND OUR COMPREHENSION. IN<br />
THOSE LECTURES-I QUOTED THE CONTEMPORARY AMERICAN THINKER<br />
KENNETH BOULDING, WHO STATED:<br />
" THE. WORLD OF TODAY IS AS DIFFERENT FROM THE WORLD IN<br />
WHICH I WSBORN AS THAT WORLD WAS FROM JULIUS CAESAR'S.<br />
ALMOST AS MUCH HAS HAPPENED SINCE I WAS BORN AS HAPPENED<br />
BEFORE."'<br />
THIS OBSERVATION IS EVEN MORE RELEVANT TODAY THAN IT WA~ S<br />
SOME 6 YEARS AGO, IN 1979.<br />
NEEDLESS TO SAY, WE ARE ALL AWARE THAT THE WORLD WE LIVE IN<br />
IS ONE OF RAPID CHANGE.<br />
AND THE PROBLEMS THAT THIS CHANGE PRESENTS ARE NOT SOMETHING<br />
THAT CAN BE FIXED OVERNIGHT.<br />
NOT TODAY, NOT TOMORROW. </p>
<p>AND TODAY I WOULD LIKE TO OVERVIEW MY GOVERNMENT'S<br />
INTEGRATED POLICIES ON THE PEOPLE WHO ARE GOING TO PLAY A<br />
MAJOR ROLE IN COMING TO GRIPS WITH THE CHALLENGES OF CHANGE.<br />
THE YOUNG PEOPLE OF OUR COUNTRY. YOUNG AUSTRALIA.<br />
IT'S THIS GENERATION OF YOUNG AUSTRALIANS THAT'S NOW COMING<br />
INTO THE WORKFORCE THEIR BRAINS, THEIR ENERGY, THEIR<br />
ENTHUSIASM THAT WILL LIFT THIS COUNTRY TO THE FRONT LINE<br />
OF THE WORLD'S INDUSTRIAL POWERS. WE MUST SETTLE FOR<br />
NOTHING LESS.<br />
WE CAN NURTURE THE TALENT, THE ENERGY, THE VIGOR, THE<br />
CREATIVITY OF YOUNG AUSTRALIA OR WE CAN LET IT WITHER ON<br />
THE VINE.<br />
AND I DO NOTBELIEVE THAT THERE IS ANYONE HERE TODAY WHO<br />
WOULD CONTEMPLATE THE LATTER. FOR MANY OF YOU IN ROTARY<br />
HAVE BEEN AND ARE SO ACTIVE WITHIN YOUR COMMUNITIES AT<br />
ADDRESSING CHANGE AND YOUTH ISSUES AT THE LOCAL LEVEL.<br />
THE GOVERNMENT CONSIDERS THAT COMMUNITY INVOLVEMENT IN YOUTH<br />
PROGRAMS ARE VITAL. I HEARTILY SUPPORT THE EFFORTS THAT YOU<br />
ARE MAKING IN THE GENERAL AREA OF ASSISTING YOUNG<br />
AUSTRALIANS, AND I UNDERSTAND THAT IN THIS DISTRICT LAST<br />
YEAR YOUR CLUBS SUPPORTED ABOUT 34 PROJECTS WHICH WERE<br />
EITHER EDUCATION RELATED, OR SPECIFICALLY AIMED AT YOUTH. I<br />
COMMEND YOUR EFFORTS.<br />
MY GOVERNMENT ALSO BELIEVES THAT YOUNG PEOPLE MUST BE<br />
SUPPORTED, AND MUST BE GIVEN EVERY OPPORTUNITY TO LEARN<br />
ABOUT THE EMPLOYMENT POSSIBILITIES THAT EXIST IN THE LABOUR<br />
MARKET. IN SHORT THEY MUST BE GIVEN ASSISTANCE TO COME TO<br />
GRIPS WITH THE MONUMENTAL CHANGES WHICH ARE OCCURRING IN OUR<br />
SOCIETY. THE CHANGES THAT HAVE OCCURRED IN THE ECONOMY, THE LABOUR<br />
M4ARKET AND SOCIETY AT LARGE OVER THE LAST DECADE HAVE HAD A<br />
CONSIDERABLE IMPACT-ON THOSEYOUNG PEOPLE-WHO ARE'SEEKING<br />
EITHER FULL OR PART-TIME WORK AND ON THOSE WHO ARE PURSUING<br />
FULL-TIME EDUCATION.<br />
THERE HAS BEEN A RAPID DECLINE SINCE THE MID 19601S IN<br />
ACCESS BY YOUNG PEOPLE TO FULL-TIME EMPLOYMENT. BETWEEN<br />
1966 AND 1983, THERE WAS A DECLINE OF ALMOST A THIRD IN THE<br />
NUMBER OF FULL-TIME JOBS HELD BY TEENAGERS, WITH MORE--<br />
EXPERIENCED, BETTER-TRAINED ADULT WORKERS TAKING AN<br />
INCREASING SHARE OF AVAILABLE JOBS IN A COMPETITIVE LABOUR.<br />
MARKET. THE INCREASED AVAILABILITY OF PART-TIME WORK OVER THIS<br />
PERIOD HAS NOT OFFERED ANY REAL COMPENSATION, SINCE IT HAS<br />
LARGELY BEEN TAKEN UP BY YOUNG PEOPLE STILL IN EDUCATION.<br />
CURRENTLY, FOR EXAMPLE, TEENAGE SCHOOL STUDENTS ACCOUNT FOR<br />
BETWEEN 50 AND 60 PER CENT OF ALL PART-TIME JOBS HELD BY<br />
TEENAGERS. </p>
<p>THESE TRENDS HAVE BEEN EXACERBATED BY THE LACK OF<br />
OPPORTUNITIES FOR STRUCTURED VOCATIONAL TRAINING AVAILABLE<br />
FOR SCHOOL LEAVERS ONCE THEY ARE IN THE LABOUR MARKET.<br />
THOSE YOUNG SCHOOL LEAVERS WHO ARE ABLE TO OBTAIN JOBS ARE<br />
INCREASINGLY FINDING THEMSELVES IN WHAT IS COMMONLY KNOWN AS<br />
THE " SECONDARY" LABOUR MARKET THAT IS, IN LOW-PAID,<br />
UNSKILLED, OFTEN CASUAL WORK, OFFERING FEW PROSPECTS FOR<br />
SKILL ACQUISITION OR LONG-TERM CAREER ADVANCEMENT.<br />
AT THE PRESENT TIME THERE ARE IN AUSTRALIA JUST OVER 2.6<br />
MILLION YOUNG PEOPLE BETWEEN THE AGES OF 15 AND 24 YEARS OF.<br />
AGE. CLOSE TO 60 PER CENT OR 1.5 MILLION OF THEM ARE EMPLOYED.<br />
MORE THAN HALF A MILLION YOUNG PEOPLE ARE NOT IN THE LABOUR<br />
FORCE AND ARE PURSUING FULL-TIME EDUCATION. THAT LEFT, AT<br />
JUNE THIS YEAR, ANOTHER-135,000 YOUNG MEN AND 95,000 YOUNG<br />
WOMEN UNEMPLOYED AND SEEKING FULL-TIME WORK ACCORDING TO THE<br />
OFFICIAL RECORDS, AND 40,000 YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN WERE<br />
UNEMPLOYED AND LOOKING FOR PART-TIME WORK.<br />
THESE RAW FIGURES AND LABOUR MARKET CHANGES DO NOT REVEAL<br />
WHAT YOUTH UNEMPLOYMENT MEANS IN TERMS OF THE LOSS OF HUMAN<br />
DIGNITY AND SELF RESPECT OR WHAT IT MEANS IN TERMS OF THE<br />
BREAKUP OF FAMILIES AND SOCIAL ALIENATION OF A LARGE NUMBER<br />
OF THE BEST AND PROUDEST GENERATION WE HAVE EVER PRODUCED<br />
OR WHAT IT MEANS IN TERMS OF THE DEFEAT OF HUMAN HOPE AND<br />
THE DEFEAT OF HUMAN SPIRIT. YOUTH UNEMPLOYMENT IS THE NEW<br />
POVERTY WITHIN OUR MIDST AND WE AS YOUR GOVERNMENT ARE<br />
DETERMINED TO REDRESS THIS LAMENTABLE SITUATION.<br />
GIVEN THE CHANGES AND THE PROBLEMS CONFRONTING YOUTH THE<br />
GOVERNMENT DECIDED ON AN INTEGRATED APPROACH PRIORITY ONE.<br />
THE GOVERNMENT IS ACUTELY AWARE THAT THE RATE OF<br />
UNEMPLOYMENT AMONGST PEOPLE WHO HAVE NOT COMPLETED SECONDARY<br />
SCHOOL OR GAINED ANY POST-SCHOOL QUALIFICATION IS TWICE AS<br />
HIGH AS THAT AMONGST THOSE WHO HAVE BETTER EDUCATIONAL<br />
ACHIEVEMENTS. WE BELIEVE THAT EDUCATION AND TRAINING ARE<br />
THE KEYS TO BROADENING LABOUR MARKET PROSPECTS AND<br />
INCREASING THE EARNING CAPACITY OF INDIVIDUALS, AND ARE THE<br />
SUREST WAY OF PROVIDING IMPROVED ACCESS TO EMPLOYMENT<br />
OPPORTUNITIES. AS I ASSUME YOU ALL KNOW BY NOW, THE GOVERNMENT'S PRIORITY<br />
ONE YOUNG AUSTRALIA RESPONSE IS BASED ON THE ARGUMENT THAT:<br />
EDUCATION MUST CONTINUE AS A WORTHWHILE AND USEFUL<br />
OPTION FOR YOUNG PEOPLE. IT MUST ALSO BE MADE MORE<br />
RELEVANT TO THE LARGE NUMBER OF YOUNG PEOPLE WHO WILL<br />
NOT BE GOING INTO ACADEMIA BUT WILL NEED TO BE HIGHLY<br />
SKILLED AND CAPABLE OF PLAYING VITAL ROLES IN OUR<br />
DEVELOPING AND CHANGING ECONOMY.<br />
EMPLOYMENT AND TRAINING MUST BE STRUCTURALLY COMBINED SO<br />
THAT YOUNG PEOPLE CAN ADEQUATELY MAKE OR BEGIN TO MAKE A<br />
SMOOTH TRANSITION INTO THE WORLD OF WORK AND M4AKE<br />
SENSIBLE CHOICES FOR THEIR SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM<br />
CAREERS. </p>
<p>INCOME SUPPORT SCHEMES SHOULD BE IMPROVED AND<br />
RATIONALISED SO THAT THOSE YOUNG PEOPLE WHO ARE<br />
DISADVANTAGED AND, AS A RESULT, HAVE THEIR RANGE OF<br />
OPTIONS CONSTRAINED, SHOULD HAVE MORE EQUITABLE<br />
OPPORTUNITIES, AND<br />
SINCE ALMOST INEVITABLY THERE WILL BE YOUNG PEOPLE WHO<br />
ARE LEFT UNEMPLOYED, UNSUPPORTED AND LACKING IN LIFE<br />
SKILLS, THERE SHOULD BE PROVISIONS WHICH ASSIST LOCAL<br />
COMMUNITY EFFORT TO HELP THESE YOUNG PEOPLE TO THE POINT<br />
WHERE THEY TOO CAN REALISE THEIR POTENTIAL.<br />
I AlM SURE THAT YOU ARE AWARE OF OUR COMMITMENT TO DEVELOPING<br />
AN AUSTRALIAN TRAINEESHIP SYSTEM AS A MAJOR FORM OF<br />
VOCATIONAL TRAINING FOR YOUNG PEOPLE, WHO, FOR WHATEVER<br />
REASON, HAVE NOT COMPLETED THEIR SECONDARY SCHOOLING, OR<br />
PROCEEDED TO HIGHER EDUCATION, OR GONE INTO A TECHNICAL OR<br />
TRADE TRAINING POSITION.-<br />
THE OBJECTIVE FOR THIS FINANCIAL YEAR IS TO GENERATE 10,000<br />
TRAINEESHIPS, WITH PLANS FOR A PROGRESSIVE EXPANSION TO<br />
REACHING AN INTAKE LEVEL OF 75,000 IN THE YEAR 1988-89. WE<br />
WILL BE LOOKING TO DEVELOP UP TO 20 PER CENT OF INITIAL<br />
TRAINEESHIP POSITIONS IN OUR OWN FIELDS OF EMPLOYMENT.<br />
TRAINEESHIPS ARE A SUBSTANTIAL GOVERNMENT COMMITMENT TO<br />
NOTHING LESS THAN A RADICAL TRANSFORMATION OF THE EXISTING<br />
AVENUES OF TRANSITION FROM SCHOOL TO WORK.<br />
THE GOVERNMENT ALSO RECENTLY ANNOUNCED ITS INTENTION TO<br />
SUBSTANITALLY UPGRADE THE COMMUNITY YOUTH SUPPORT SCHEME<br />
( CYSS) A SCHEME IN WHICH MANY ROTARIANS HAVE M4ADE SUCH AN<br />
INVALUABLE CONTRIBUTION. WE WILL SPEND $ 32 MILLION ON THIS<br />
SCHEME IN 1985-86, AN INCREASE OF 23 PER CENT OVER 1984-85.<br />
IT IS ESTIMATED THAT 85,000 UNEMPLOYED YOUNG PEOPLE WILL BE<br />
ASSISTED UNDER THE PROGRAM IN 1985-86. THIS UPGRADING OF<br />
CYSS REPRESENTS AN IMPORTANT COMPONENT OF THE GOVERNMENT'S<br />
" PRIORITY ONE" POLICY STRATEGY, WHICH IS DIRECTED AT<br />
IMPROVING THE LABOUR MARKET PROSPECTS OF-YOUNG'PEOPLE. IN<br />
ADDITION THE GOVERNMENT WILL INCREASE FUNDING FOR YOUTH<br />
EMPLOYMENT PROJECTS UNDER ITS COMMUNITY YOUTH SPECIAL<br />
PROJECTS PROGRAM ( CYSP) BY 58 PER CENT DURING 1985-86.<br />
THE SUCCESS OF THESE PROJECTS IN GETTING YOUNG PEOPLE BACK<br />
INTO EMPLOYMENT OR FURTHER EDUCATION AND TRAINING IS A<br />
TRIBUTE TO THE DEDICATION OF THEIR SPONSOR ORGANISATIONS AND<br />
LOCAL COMMUNITIES, INCLUDING LOCAL EMPLOYERS, MANY OF WHOM<br />
ARE ACTIVE IN ROTARY CLUBS THROUGHOUT AUSTRLIA.<br />
HOWEVER THE MAGNITUDE OF THE YOUTH UNEMPLOYMENT PROBLEM AND<br />
THE CHANGES CONFRONTING YOUNG AUSTRALIANS ARE SUCH THAT THEY<br />
WILL NOT BE FULLY OVERCOME UNLESS EMPLOYERS, UNIONS,<br />
GOVERNMENTS, TRAINING ORGANISATIONS AND THE COMMUNITY, ALL<br />
CONTINUE TO WORK TOGETHER IN A CONSTRUCTIVE MANNER. IN<br />
THESE TIMES OF RAPID CHANGE, WE MUST ALL SHARE THE<br />
RESPONSIBILITY TO GENERATE OPPORTUNITIES FOR YOUTH. I<br />
BELIEVE THAT ROTARY HAS ALWAYS DEMONSTRATED A COMMITMENT TO<br />
YOUTH AS PART OF ITS BROADER COMMITMENT TO COMMUNITY<br />
SERVICE, AND IN THIS RESPECT I BELIEVE THAT ROTARY IS " AHEAD<br />
OF THE FIELD" IN TERMS OF RESPONDING TO THIS CHALLENGE OF<br />
CHANGE. </p>
<p>THANK YOU FOR INVITING ME TO ADDRESS YOUR COUNCIL<br />
CONFERENCE, AND FOR YOUR HOSPITALITY. I CONGRATULATE YOUR<br />
ORGANISATION FOR THE GOOD WORK SO MANY OF YOU ARE DOING<br />
WITHIN YOUR SPHERE OF INFLUENCE, AND I WISH YOU WELL WITH<br />
THE REMAINDER OF YOUR CONFERENCE AND IN YOUR FUTURE<br />
ENDEAVOURS. </p>
