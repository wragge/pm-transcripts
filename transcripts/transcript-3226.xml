EMBARGO:. 8.00 P.! fi.<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER, MR E. G. WHITLAM, QC, MP, FOR THE<br />
OPENING OF THE ANNUAL ART EXHIBITION AT ST PATRICK' S COLLEGE,<br />
STRATHFIE. LD, FRIDAY, 26 APRIL 1974<br />
I was assured when I accepted your invitation to open this<br />
exhibition that I could make my speech " as political as you like".<br />
Since we are about to start an election campaign I am happy to<br />
accept your assurance and take you at your word. The question is:<br />
should I make a political speech about art or a political speech<br />
about education? Like St. Patrick's College, we have an excellent<br />
record in both. We have almost doubled Australian Government<br />
assistance to the arts and we have almost doubled Australian<br />
Government assistance to education. Some of the schools we have<br />
assisted are famous schools; some of the paintings we have bought<br />
are famous paintings. At least one of them is very famous. A year<br />
ago everyone had heard of St. Patrick's College but not everyone had<br />
heard of Jackson Pollock. Perhaps there are more votes in education.<br />
Solet me make a " political speech". Let me make this<br />
statement wihout qualification: Education is the greatest single<br />
achievement of the Labor Government. The prospects for education,<br />
the prospects for our children, have been utterly transformed. Look<br />
back to the situation before we came to office. There were vast<br />
deficiencies in the States' education budgets; inequalities between<br />
pupils, inequalities between schools, inequalities between States and<br />
regions, were deeply and hopelessly entrenched. Working-class parents<br />
were taxed so that money could be poured into wealthy schools that<br />
needed assistance least. The Australian Government was giving nothing<br />
not one cent to the recurrent costs of government schools. Whole<br />
areas of education were neglected. Primary schools were downgraded in<br />
favour of secondary schools. Needy secondary schools were downgraded<br />
in favour of prosperous secondary schools. University fees were<br />
restricting tertiary education to those who could afford it, Teachers'<br />
colleges were ignored. Pre-schooling as a right of every Australian<br />
child was practically unheard of. Technical education was the<br />
Cinderella of the system.<br />
On top of that on top of that gross pattern of neglect and<br />
impoverishment education was bedevilled by a futile controversy<br />
over " State aid". The Liberals' twin shibboleths of State aid and<br />
State rights embittered and delayed every rational attempt to give<br />
a new deal to Australian children. We have given that new deal. In<br />
17 months we have scrapped the accumulated deadwood of ad-hoc grants,<br />
patch-up subsidies and makeshift aid programs initiated by our<br />
predecessors. We have given a new charter to the children of<br />
Australia. The old obsession with State aid has been buried for good.<br />
And remember this: State aid was as much an obsession of the right<br />
as it was of the left, as much a preoccupation of government school<br />
supporters as non-government school supporters. Where are the DOGS<br />
now? I have not heard a word from them in this election. The DOGS<br />
have had their day! The prejudice and negativism they promoted and<br />
represented the bitterness they shared with their opponents at the<br />
opposite extreme have disappeared. We have lifted the whole debate<br />
on education out of a miasma of irrelevance and sectarianism. The<br />
beneficiaries are the children of Australia and the generations of<br />
children to come. / 2 </p>
<p>-2-<br />
What must strike any impartial observer of this debate is<br />
the cynical opportunism of the Liberals. For years they decried any<br />
attempt to improve the condition of our schools as an interference<br />
with the rights of States. How often they told us that education<br />
was a " State responsibility". When our programs for increased grants<br />
to schools the Karmel funds came before Parliament last December,<br />
the Liberals voted against them. They opposed the legislation. They<br />
opposed the whole concept cf needs by insisting that we make extra<br />
funds available to A-category schools that needed the money least.<br />
Because of their doctrinaire attachment to the wealthiest schools<br />
they threatened to block our entire program of reform, to prevent<br />
promised funds going to the States even Liberal States for their<br />
education programs, and to hold up the Australian Schools Commission<br />
unless we agreed to stack it with their friends and supporters.<br />
The Country Party and I give credit for this saw the folly of the<br />
Liberals' ways. They voted for our measures while the Liberals<br />
opposed them. I am not sure whether these events were more important<br />
as a commentary on the Liberal attitude to our children's future or<br />
as a commentary on Opposition unity.<br />
I ask you to look at the attitudes of the Liberals now and<br />
contrast it with what they were saying only five short months ago.<br />
Five months ago they voted against our proposals. Today they say<br />
they would match them! Now that an election is coming on, the Liberals<br />
have discovered the value of our reforms. They promise to keep the<br />
Australian Schools Commission if returned to power. They promise to<br />
make the same funds available to schools. Of course, they also<br />
promise to cut back or reduce the growth of Government spending.<br />
The people will have to decide which promise they believe. I simply<br />
ask whether anyone can believe a party or trust a party that within<br />
the space of five months can change its mind completely on an issue<br />
of such radical importance as the education of our children.<br />
So here is the Liberal record on education; 23 years of<br />
neglect, one year of obstruction, six months of silence, and two weeks<br />
of contrition. For a generation they did nothing for the schooling of<br />
the majority of Australian children. Their indifference and contempt<br />
blighted the education of thousands of Australians. They condemned<br />
Australian children to overcrowded classes, ill-equipped and understaffed<br />
schools. They neglected the needs of disadvantaged schools<br />
and isolated children. They neglected the needs of teachers' colleges.<br />
Every other area of tertiary education received some support often<br />
tardy and grudging support but teachers' colleges got nothing.<br />
They particularly neglected the needs of the Catholic sector in both<br />
primary and secondary education. Their aid to Catholic schools failed<br />
to recognise the areas of greatest need and acknowledge the genuine<br />
difficulties of the Catholic system. / 3 </p>
<p>All that has been changed by our legislation. As a result<br />
of our legislation Catholic schools, both primary and secondary,<br />
whether systemic or not, receive recurrent assistance in direct<br />
relation to their needs.<br />
Our program of funding schools according to their needs.<br />
replaces the old system of across the board per capita grants. The<br />
introduction of the new program means that Catholic schools throughout<br />
Australia will receive a total of $ 123 million for the years 1974 and<br />
1975 instead of the estimated $ 76.4 million which would have been<br />
available had the old per capita grants been maintained at the rate<br />
which applied in 1973. New South Wales Catholic schools will receive<br />
$ 47 million under this arrangement. These schools would have received<br />
approximately $ 29 million under the per capita scheme operated by<br />
the previous Government. It has been particularly unfair that some<br />
Catholic school principals have criticised the Labor Government, which<br />
has increased its grants for secondary schools, while making no<br />
criticism of the N. S. W. Liberal Government whose grants for secondary<br />
schools are much lower than those of the State Governments of<br />
Queensland and Victoria.<br />
In the case of non-systemic non-government schools like<br />
St Patrick's College, the Karmel Committee made individual estimates<br />
of the needs of each school, classifying them into eight categories,<br />
ranking from H to A, in ascending order according to the level of<br />
recurrent resources available to pupils at these schools.<br />
St Patrick's was classified as Category G, indicating that the school<br />
should receive recurrent grants at the rate of $ 85 per primary pupil<br />
and $ 130 per secondary pupil in 1974 and $ 120 per primary pupil and<br />
$ 190 per secondary pupil in 1975. As a result of these grants it<br />
is estimated that your school will receive approximately $ 140,000 in<br />
1974 and $ 203,000 in 1975 a total of $ 343,000 for the two years.<br />
Had the previous government' s policy continued, and had the rate of<br />
per capita grants remained unchanged, the school would have received<br />
an estimated $ 220,000 for the two years. In effect, the operation of<br />
the present scheme has resulted in an increase of 56% in recurrent<br />
funds available from the Australian Government to St. Patrick's College.<br />
Let me say a word about the treatment of disadvantaged<br />
schools. We have recognised that certain schools are so deprived<br />
and needy that they are entitled to assistance of a special kind,<br />
apart from the normal criteria of need applied to other schools.<br />
Catholic disadvantaged schools throughout Australia will receive an<br />
additional $ 2.45 million during the 1974/ 75 biennium. Of this,<br />
$ 890.000 will be provided for Catholic schools in New South Wales.<br />
In addition, the Australian Government will make available $ 3.76 million<br />
to disadvantaged schools to undertake building projects in 1974 and 1975.<br />
Of this amount $ 1.3 million will be allocated to New South Wales.<br />
This program was introduced by the present Government. There was no<br />
comparable program of assistance to disadvantaged schools under the<br />
previous Government. ./ 4 </p>
<p>Finally, a word about Catholic and other non-government<br />
teachers' colleges. Because of the neglect of these colleges in<br />
the past, the Commission on Advanced Education has conducted an inquiry<br />
into their needs and recommended support for them. The recommendations<br />
are designed to give assistance by way of recurrent funds for 1974<br />
and 1975. They are in two parts. Firstly, there is a basic provision<br />
for each college which will enable it to meet in reasonable measure<br />
the planned growth for 1974 and 1975, on the assumption that the<br />
proportion of religious in the total staff remains as indicated in<br />
the college submissions. Secondly, the Commission has recommended<br />
an additional sum, over and above that allowed for in the basic<br />
provision, to finance the replacement of religious by lay staff where<br />
necessary. In New South Wales, the Commission has recommended support<br />
for the Catholic College of Education on condition that by the end<br />
of 1975 it has its completed plans for amalgamation with the Good<br />
Samaritan Teachers College and a new institution is set up on a<br />
suitable site. The Commission has also recommended support for<br />
other teaching institutions, including the Catholic Teachers College<br />
at Worth Sydney, the Guild Teachers' College and the Good Samaritan<br />
Teachers College at Glebe Point.<br />
Two weeks ago I wrote to Archbishop Carroll in these terms:<br />
" As part of its education policy, I indicated that my<br />
Government would support teachers' colleges in the same way as all<br />
other tertiary institutions.<br />
" The necessary measures have already been taken to include<br />
government teachers' colleges fully under advanced education<br />
arrangements, and in response to the request made to it last year the<br />
Commission on Advanced Education has recently submitted a report on<br />
financial provision for approved " private" teachers' colleges. The<br />
Government is in the process of dealing with this report which<br />
recommends that approved private teachers' colleges should receive<br />
assistance with recurrent costs from 1 January 1974.<br />
" I am writing to assure you that support will be provided<br />
as soon as the normal parliamentary processes allow. The conditions<br />
of support will be along the lines discussed with the colleges by the<br />
Commission during its investigations and will be directed towards<br />
the rational development of the institutions within the overall<br />
tertiary program." I commend the great contribution of the Catholic system to<br />
the education of Australia's children. For the first time, under this<br />
Government, their true needs and just entitlements have been recognised.<br />
As a result of our policies, Catholic education can look forward to a<br />
secure and prosperous future within a secure and prosperous educational<br />
system. The Christian Brothers have done much to raise the standards<br />
of teaching in our schools and set a proud example of selfless<br />
dedication to the interests of our children. This fine school, with<br />
its fine traditions, exemplifies the best in Catholic education. Your<br />
annual art exhibition is evidence of a lively concern for the cultural,<br />
intellectual and spiritual health of your pupils and the community you<br />
serve. I wish your exhibition every success. I have great pleasure<br />
in declaring it open. </p>
