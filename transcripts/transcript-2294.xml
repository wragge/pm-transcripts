" THIS WEEK" PROGRAMME_<br />
TV ITERVIEW GIVEN BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
MR J1O H qG~ OLRT?<br />
Interviewer: John Boland<br />
Recorded on Saturday236 September for screening on Sunday 27 Sjptmr .1970<br />
Q. Prime Minister, the last time that I spoke to you on " This Weec, Labor<br />
looked to be a lot more formidable. You appear since then to have toughened ywur<br />
own mind more away from a liberal ideologicai attitude which you were thought to<br />
have in view of the Prime Ministers we have had in the past. Sir Robert Menzies<br />
was more or less a hard-line Liberal and Mr Holt virtually followed on in the<br />
same sort of pattern. But you cut defence spending and you gave Billy Wentworth<br />
carte blanche on social services and things like this. But now all of a sudden, you<br />
have really got down to hard politics almost as though, " Well, I'm Prime Minister<br />
and I am going to get stuck into being Prime Minister and this is going to be hard<br />
politics from here on in. Now I mention this because two big issues have<br />
occurred within recent weeks :-The law and order legislation and of course the<br />
very hard ine and the way in which you have grappled with Mr Whitlam this<br />
week over his statement on the Vietnam issue, particularly in relation to<br />
conscripts not wanting to go to Vietnam and what they should do about it.<br />
PM You mean telling them to disobey orders?<br />
Q. Yes. Now is this a pretty fair assessment df a change in John Grey<br />
Gorton?<br />
PM I don't think it is at all. In fact I can't see any evidence of moving<br />
away from a liberal ( with a small attitude. Perhaps you would explain<br />
why you think there was?<br />
Q. Well, those two points alone.....<br />
PM All right. Let's take those two points. One question you called law<br />
and order. My approach to that is this, that people have a right to dissent,<br />
people have a right to criticise, people have a right to object to what a governnrent<br />
is doing and to try and change it or to make a government do something else and<br />
they have a right to congregate for that purpose. There Is no question of that.<br />
In fact I believe that that kind of right of dissent is the sort of right which<br />
Liberals, more than anybody else, would want to sustain and wo uld fight to<br />
sustain. There is no question of that. But we also believe that there are civil<br />
rights for the majority of people in Australia, and that those civil rights should<br />
not be infringed by demonstrators preventing the majority from using the<br />
streets if they want to use them, or intimidating individuals amongst them-1, or<br />
in any other way violating the civil rights. /' 2 </p>
<p>2.<br />
Q. Is this law. and -order legisLitton that you have in mind, is it pretty<br />
tough and a little undemocratic in certain areas?<br />
PM<br />
Q. Do we need this in Australia that's the point I'm getting at'!<br />
PM Well let's examine whether we think we need it or not. First of all,<br />
of course, the Commonwealth's writ in relation to the making and enforcement<br />
of laws does not run in most of the areas tn the States. But we had a situation<br />
arising where small numbers of people would go into a National Service Office<br />
and tear up the records, pour ox blood on the floor, terrorise the public Servants<br />
working there. We had a time when a group of people walked into Mr Snedden,)<br />
office and lccked the door and sat there and abused him and played the camera<br />
on him so that if he answered them at all, they could say that he was abu.-ing them.<br />
We had instances of stink bombs being let off in post offices which people have<br />
a right to use. I think we do need to have sufficient penalties for that kin~ d of action<br />
to make that kind of action really punishable.<br />
Q. Now you want this punishable under Com--monwealth law rather than<br />
under State laws. Don't you feel that our laws which e xist at the moment are<br />
strong enough?<br />
PM No, I don't because I think you will find that people doing this k-ind of<br />
thing could be had up perhaps for trespass, possibly for trespass, under<br />
State law, possibly fined perhaps $ 2 or $ 3 for obstructing the footpath<br />
or for invading somebody's house. I don't think that is suff icient. Now, of course,<br />
we can only apply laws to our own Commonwealth property or in the A. C. T. or<br />
the Northern Territory.<br />
Q. Well fair enough. Now what do you think should be a more stringent<br />
policy. Yoi are looking at bigger fines? Or do you feel they ought to be shoved<br />
in clink for a couple of days for deing this sort of thing? or what"'<br />
PM Well let's just say there should be, I believe, after conviction<br />
accordingjto law, and only after conviction according to law, of course, there<br />
_ Should be geater penalties for those kinds of actions which I have just<br />
described.<br />
Q. Now the other very intere. sting thing is the trapping of Mr Whitlam<br />
this week into the mutiny by conscientious objectors to Vietnam. This is<br />
something which has created a tremendous impact on the Australian scene. Labor<br />
looked to be at perhaps its most formidable best, particularly after cleaning<br />
up Victoria<br />
PM Well. I'll discuss that separately with </p>
<p>PM I enter a-cayeat-onithat:'<br />
Q. The point I want to make here is just how mony votes do you thnk there<br />
is in Vietnam now in Australia? What sort of an issue is. Vietnam, as far as<br />
getting votes is concerned now?<br />
PM I don't think I could make-an esti mate which would be worth very<br />
much. Ilam sure that most people would wish that the war in Vietnam were<br />
finished. Ther is no question of that. But I am also sure that very large numbers<br />
of people feel that we were right to go there and we should stay until the<br />
invaders have been beaten, that is, made to withdraw. But however much of an<br />
issue that is, I don't know but this isn't really the issue that arose...<br />
Q. No, the mutiny issue.....<br />
PM Yes, the offering of advice to young men to go into the Army arid then<br />
to refuse to obey orders. That's the issue that is really significant.<br />
Q. Do you feel that this whole Vietnam question you've got<br />
conscientious objectors, you yourself say, " Yes, Australia is a country which<br />
should have the right to dissent". I think that most Australians would agree<br />
with you on this mutiny aspect, but are there enough areas if someone doesn't<br />
want to go and fight in Vietnam? Now the gaoling of Brian Ross has created a<br />
tremendous impact on the Australian scene. Is that too harsh a thing',<br />
PM No, look, there are these opportunities for people who either diSlike<br />
bearing arms at all or dislike a particular theatre of war. Let's take the<br />
people who dislike bearing arms, who have conscientious objections to going to<br />
war at all in any circumstances. Now provision to is made for them to claim<br />
these conscientious objections, to go before a court, to have them investigated<br />
and if they are upheld, then those people are excused from all service arid their<br />
conscientious beliefs are respected. Then you have another group of people<br />
and these are the people Mr Whitlam is talkbngabout, who do not have<br />
conscientious objections to bearing arms, who do not have conscientious objections<br />
to war, but who are worried about going to in this case Vietnam. In another<br />
case, it might be some other theatre. They are worried about going to some<br />
particular theatre, they don't want to go there. Now they haven't got to do<br />
that either because if they feel that that is likely to happen, then provision is<br />
made for them to join the CMF, in which case, they are exempt from call-up.<br />
And that is a proper and legal way for a young man who is prepared to bear arms<br />
but doesn't want to go to a particular area to see that he dcesn't go to that<br />
particular area. But when you go beyond that and say that in spite of the fact<br />
that you have got this legal way of avoiding this service, I advise you to join<br />
the Army and to refuse to obey an order to go to a particular place, that is<br />
saying to a young man, " Although you have a legal redress, I advise you to take<br />
an illegal method which will land you in a lot of trouble. </p>
<p>-Q N x Ã±, Vqssues look to me-like election issues, with a<br />
Senato. eleS. tion. comlng up. Now November 29 has been nominated. Are you still<br />
very keen S ould I say November 29 has been speculated upon.....<br />
PM I rather think November 29 is a Sunday, but....<br />
Q. Well it might be 28, Prime Minister,...... I think you might be right:<br />
Anyhow, in that area. Are we pretty close to the mark here? You know, these<br />
are two good big election issues and you have got to have a Senate election.<br />
PM We have got to have a Senate election, yes.<br />
Q. Well<br />
PM Aad we will be having a Senate election this year.<br />
Q. So it is in November some time?<br />
PM Well you said that, I didn't.<br />
Q. Well we are going to have one this year and that we know. Now this<br />
raises anozher interesting thing because last week the Labor Party appeared to<br />
clear up their problems in Victoria. In other words, they placed a 12-man<br />
Executive and sacked the entire Labor organisation in Victoria. The DL?<br />
said that if you can sack the Victorian Executive, in fact Senator McMarius, I<br />
think it was, held out an olive branch and said " Well, we might be able to<br />
talk turkey", and their State Aid policy became general once they had decided,<br />
right, the Victorian Branch goes and they are replaced by this 12-man Executive<br />
until such time as we fix the whole thing up, and State Aid is right, and this<br />
Trade Union Defence Council is out. These are the two big DLP problems. Now<br />
the DLP has sort of been like a monkey on your back because they have knocked<br />
you around on this States Tax Receipts thing<br />
PM I wouldn't say they've been like a monkey on our back. In many, many<br />
fields we have precisely the same beliefs. We believe, both believe that ustralia<br />
needs proper defence forces. The DLP goes further than we do. But we both are<br />
in line on many foreign affairs and defence policies.<br />
Q. But do you think there is an endeavour here would you like, for<br />
instance, to have a straight-out fight with Labor in the Senate election, rather<br />
than be worrying whether the DLP are going to win, because there is not a great<br />
deal of difference now between their policies?<br />
PM Between the DLP and the Labor Party policies?<br />
Q. Well, if, o 0 4 </p>
<p>PM I draw youattention nu to my reriarks, I'm not going to speak<br />
for the-DLU-. butto-some of the remarks that Senator Gair made yesterday,<br />
for example,_ on this latest call for mutiny.<br />
Q. Yes, I agree....<br />
PM Mutiny, incidentally, mans two people or more, I understand. Let's<br />
say the call for soldiers to disobey orders.<br />
Q. But he won't play ball with you on you're in trouble on<br />
this one, rren't you?<br />
PM On?<br />
Q. On collecting the Receipts Tax for the States?<br />
PM Well we will have to see what happens, won't we?<br />
Q. Do you think you can get them on side, or do you think if you call a<br />
Senate election on these issues, that the DLP could lose eut because they are<br />
not so far behind or they are not so far in front of Labor policy now in many<br />
respects, except on defence as you just mentioned.<br />
PM I think there is more similarity between Liberal policies and DLP<br />
policies than there is between Labor policies. And after all, we are talking as<br />
if the Labor Party branches were all cleaned up and they weren't af-fected, any<br />
of them, in the way that the Victorian Executive was affected.. Now the<br />
Victorian Labor Party Executive has been defended in the past by Mr Whtlam.<br />
When we said it was run by faceless men, that it was undemocratic, we didn't<br />
get agreement. But now he calls it something which has been an authoritarian<br />
and undemocratic junta, as undoubtedly it has been. But we don't know what is<br />
going to go in place of it yet. Certainly there is a 12-man committee that has been<br />
put up to suggest new rules, but a number of those people en that Committee are<br />
from the old undemocratic junta, so described, and I notice, for example, that<br />
the man leading their Senate team, Senator Brown, was one of the strong Left-<br />
Wing supporters of this undemocratic, authoritarian junta. Now let's wait and<br />
see what does come up. I think, you will remember at the<br />
Q. You sound almost as though you are pleased that Senator Brown is<br />
leading the Victorian Labor Senate team.<br />
PM Well, I think it is a pretty clear indication oi what is likely to be an<br />
attempted facelift rather than a change. I don't know this field as well, for<br />
example, as a suppoorter of the DLP, Mr Santamaria does, but I notice he came<br />
out saying that all that happened was they had stcpped being Maoist communist<br />
controlled in the Victorian Executive and are now controlled by Moscow<br />
communists. This was an article in the " Herald". But I don't know the details<br />
of this, the ins and outs of this, but after all, that came into my mind because<br />
you were saying about the DLP and ,6 </p>
<p>Q. Well,. the reasonLhrng-thi up.. is you have now said, " Right the<br />
Senate.-electun will be this year" and I am tipping November, and so are a lot<br />
of other journalists. There is nothing unique in miy saying this. The situation<br />
now arises that there are a lot of Labor voters I mean the Labor Deience<br />
policy itself, other than Mr Whitlam' s recent statements which have become<br />
quite a political thing looking at it in cold hard politics, the Goverimient<br />
have trapped him beautifully, haven't they? Let's be political about this.<br />
PM Look, we didn't set nut to trap him at all. We didn't lecad him to say<br />
this. He just came out and said this was what he was doing for some reason<br />
that I don't know. We found out, in fact, by accident the sort of advice he was<br />
giving and the sort of approach he was taking. In one sense, yes this, i think,<br />
must be very -politically damaging to him, and certainly it would prevent the use<br />
of armed forces containing National Servicemen. Somebody could say, " I don't<br />
want to go to Vietnam", somebody else could say, " I don't want to go to Malaysia"<br />
and the whole thing breaks down. But nevertheless., believe it or not, I a-m rather<br />
strry that it has happened because I think it is a very grave thing for a leader<br />
of a political party of the size of the Labor Party to give this kind of advice and<br />
to take this kind df an approach. I think it is something that I don't believe<br />
could happen in any other democratic country.<br />
Q. You would like to be out of Vietnam. I think the Americans would like<br />
to be out of Vietnam. I think that goes without saying. Is there any chance<br />
that before the Senate election, that you could announce further Australianr<br />
troop withdrawals',,<br />
OM The first battalion to come back that we have already announced is due<br />
back some time in November, as I understand, but any future action would be<br />
purely speculative and would depend upon the success of the Vietramisation<br />
campaign.<br />
Q. You are up to date with this. You know.. you are in conotant touch<br />
with this, more so, probably than anyone else. Do you feel that the Vietriamisation<br />
programme is going along sufficiently successfully enough-to~ announce again<br />
this year, or to have the possibility of announcing again this year that we would<br />
withdraw a further battalion of troops?<br />
PM That is far too iffy and speculative, I a m afraid for me to comment<br />
on that.<br />
Q. Well, now, there is another thing that comes to mind. With these<br />
two issues that you have got going now law and order and Mr Vthitlam's<br />
dilemma on mutiny, would it be possible for' John Grey Gorton to say, " Niow<br />
I may be able to hold a double dissolution on these two issues, and one or two<br />
other issues". Is that a possibility? 0. 0 a / 7 </p>
<p>PM WelLthere-iala~ ys-a-pos ibhility, I suppose, but this again is far too<br />
speculative a thing and I would think on the whole it was fairly unlikely that a<br />
government with over two years to run would call a double dissolution unless it<br />
was absolutely necessary. I would like to use my own phrasing again for what<br />
you call law and order, because I think it is more accurate, . and that is what<br />
we are out to do is to protect the civil rights of people against their being<br />
interfered with by demonstrators. There again, there is a big difference<br />
between us and the Labor Party.<br />
Q. What else do you think could become an election issue for the Senate<br />
election, other than these two matters that we have discussed pretty fully?<br />
What else do you feel strongly about? I have got something in mind that I would<br />
like to ask you but I would like to know whether you have the same idea before<br />
I perhaps telegraph my punch here.<br />
PM What do I feel strongly about that we should<br />
Q. Yes, what do you feel should be another election issue'! I mean, you<br />
are going to set the terms on this.<br />
PM Yes, well, it depends. I mean, you can have an election issue where<br />
you say; " We, the Government, believe this should happen, and this is the goal<br />
we are working towards" and you can have the Opposition promising anything at<br />
all and trying to make that an election issue. And indeed it is not altogether easy<br />
to have real issues, significant, far-reaching issues at a Senate election because<br />
we have just had an election at which a policy for three years was set out. But<br />
I believe one of the most important things we have got to do is to contain<br />
inflation, is to stop inflation growing. Now we have given clear evidence of eur<br />
approach to this, of our concern with it. The promises, high, wide and handsome<br />
and unlimited that have been made on behalf of the Opposition would undoubtedly<br />
cause inflation and damage to all those on fixed incomes least able to look after<br />
themselves and to those in the country who are in the rural industries having a<br />
very, very hard time indeed.<br />
Q. Now there is a point here and I think we should both acknowledge it. Ycu<br />
mentioned hardship. The pensioners, their 50 cent raise from the Federal<br />
Treasurer.... is them likely to be some sort of help to them before the next<br />
Budget? Now, I just want to point this out. In Victoria, for instance, the<br />
Hcusing Commission, for the pensioners, put up all the pensioners' rents by<br />
cents and so the 50 cents the Government gave them went nowhere. It was<br />
spent before they got it. You have been acknowledged as probably the most<br />
social-service Liberal Prime Minister that we have ever had. This was quite a<br />
shock this 50 cents. o n<br />
/ U </p>
<p>8.<br />
PM I suppose It was and yet t,. ere has never been as much done in the<br />
field of social services as has been done in the three Budgets that we have<br />
brought in. This operation this year because of the inflation of which I have<br />
spoken was a holding Budget as far as the pensioners were concerned; riot as<br />
far as social services were concerned because the health scheme coming in this<br />
year should, I believe, give great benefit to people. But merely looking at the<br />
rate of pension for base pensioners in the last three Budgets, the rates have been<br />
raised including the 50 cents far nD re than has the cost of living increased in<br />
that time. There have been two big increases arid this small holding one. All I<br />
can say is that we have not changed our approach towards social servicec. We<br />
have giver full evidence of that in the tapered means test, in the whole variety<br />
of smaller things, with assistance to handicapped children, with paying pension<br />
at single rates to people who are separated, with the rates of the pension.<br />
themselves, and ths is an approach we propose to continue.<br />
Q. Prime Minister, I think time is running out on us now, unfortunately,<br />
but do you think that it is possible to increase the pension before the n=~<br />
Budget another 590 cents, a dollar or something like that?<br />
PM You are asking me for Budget information kind of stuff<br />
Q. Well I am asking something which could be pretty important with<br />
the Senate election coming up.<br />
PM I would not believe that bribery should enter into a Senate election,<br />
and inherert in what you are saying since you hitch the two together, t hrt is<br />
why I make that comment.<br />
Q. But you do think that perhaps they could be helped soorner or later?<br />
PM I think that we as a government will continue the same approaches<br />
that we have had in the past and that the pensioners' lot will continue to get<br />
better.<br />
Q. We haven't got very far on that one: Thanks very much Prime Minister. </p>
