    <content><![CDATA[<p>It's a great pleasure to be back home in Nambour.</p>
<p>And it's a great pleasure to be here at the QUOTA Memorial Park with the Wall of Remembrance.</p>
<p>We are here to celebrate the 90th anniversary of the Nambour RSL.</p>
<p>It is, I am told, probably the oldest RSL in existence.</p>
<p>A reminder of how even this little corner of Australia 90 years ago was so affected by war.</p>
<p>And how the community then came together and formed an organisation for returned soldiers.</p>
<p>If the war touched Nambour, it shook Australia greatly.</p>
<p>Over 400,000 Australian enlisted.</p>
<p>Over 300,000 served overseas.</p>
<p>Over 60,000 died.</p>
<p>And this was out of a population of only four million.</p>
<p>It was an extraordinary sacrifice for a country so young.</p>
<p>And one that we must surely remember.</p>
<p>So congratulations to all Nambour RSL members for laying the foundation for the RSL tradition and keeping it going for so long.</p>
<p>Today, to celebrate the 90th anniversary we are here to dedicate this Wall of Remembrance.</p>
<p>The RSL has worked hard to with the local community to commemorate all those men and women from Nambour and the surrounding area who have served with our armed forces.</p>
<p>There are already 280 names on the wall.</p>
<p>They are the names of men and women that have been a part of the great traditions established by the ANZACs.</p>
<p>The traditions of dedication to duty and proud service in the name of their country.</p>
<p>There is no higher calling than to wear the uniform of this country.</p>
<p>And on this wall is the name of people that have answered that calling.</p>
<p>I am proud that my father's name is there on the wall.</p>
<p>He served with the 2/15th Australian Field Company of Royal Australian Engineers.</p>
<p>He served in the Middle East, back in Australia and in the South West Pacific.</p>
<p>After the war, he came here  -  to Nambour.</p>
<p>And I am still proud to call myself a Nambour boy.</p>
<p>I want to thank the Nambour RSL, QUOTA International and the local community for coming together on this project.</p>
<p>Honouring those who have served is part of who we are as Australians.</p>
<p>It is right to honour them.</p>
<p>Because they served to protect us.</p>
<p>They have protected Australia and have stood for what we believe in.</p>
<p>The stories that our fathers, brothers, sisters and mothers tell us about their experiences are the story of our nation.</p>
<p>Like the stories of the battles in the South West Pacific in 1941 and 1942 when we fighting for the future of this great country.</p>
<p>Australia, with our ally the United States, was fighting for its survival.</p>
<p>Armies manoeuvred, fleets sailed and air forces roamed the skies.</p>
<p>But these military units were all made up of individuals with stories to tell.</p>
<p>People from Nambour and countless other towns around Australia.</p>
<p>People whose stories we should hold dear.</p>
<p>The Memorial Wall will help make sure that our memories do not fade.</p>
<p>The Next Generation</p>
<p>But we need to do more than that to keep the memories alive.</p>
<p>We have to make sure that the stories are passed on to younger generations.</p>
<p>And we hope and pray that it will not be necessary to add the names of future generations to the list of those who gave their lives in war.</p>
<p>I want to thank all the young people here today who are taking part in this event.</p>
<p>The Suncoast Christian College Choir ...</p>
<p>The ADF cadets ...</p>
<p>And the students from Burnside High School, Nambour Christian College, Nambour High School, St John's College and Suncoast Christian College.</p>
<p>I see the values of ANZAC running deep in the veins of young Australians.</p>
<p>So I am confident that the memory of those who have served and the memory of their deeds will live on.</p>
<p>They will live on and will remain a part of the fabric of who and what we are.</p>
<p>Gallipoli, Tobruk, the Kokoda Track and the modern day theatres of the Middle East are an important part of the story of our nation.</p>
<p>Young men and women continue to serve with distinction with our forces at home and overseas.</p>
<p>They follow in the tradition of ANZAC and they build on its name.</p>
<p>Whether as peacekeepers, combat troops or working in any one of a number of support roles, our troops do us proud.</p>
<p>Today we also recognise the role played by the families of those who served.</p>
<p>When they serve, soldiers need the support of families and friends back home.</p>
<p>And when they return home they also need support.</p>
<p>They need the support of their families and they need the support of the wider community.</p>
<p>The RSL does a great job in this.</p>
<p>It helps people make the transition back to civilian life.</p>
<p>And it helps veterans stay in touch with one another  -  to maintain the ties that were often forged under fire.</p>
<p>So today I would like to congratulate the RSL not only for building the Wall of Remembrance, but for its work over the past 90 years in supporting veterans.</p>
<p>I want to congratulate QUOTA International on the initiative it took more than 10 years ago to establish the Memorial Park.</p>
<p>This event and this memorial are a fitting and dignified tribute to the members of the RSL who have served their nation with distinction.</p>
