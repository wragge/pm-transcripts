    <content><![CDATA[<p>I am pleased to announce an additional $1 million for the Commonwealth Trade and Investment Access Facility (TIAF), bringing Australia';s support for the Facility to $3.5 million since 1997.</p>
<p>The benefits of trade and investment liberalisation to developing countries are clear. Integration in the global economy is essential for developing countries to achieve sustainable economic growth and poverty reduction.</p>
<p>The TIAF is playing an important role in helping Commonwealth developing countries identify, manage and benefit from the economic and social impacts of increasing world trade and investment liberalisation.</p>
<p>Key activities include the provision of technical advice through workshops and an  on-line briefing service for trade officials.  On-the-spot assistance is also provided to Commonwealth Ambassadors in Geneva attending trade related meetings and negotiations.</p>
<p>The TIAF helps developing countries participate in international trade agreements such as the World Trade Organisation (WTO), including legal drafting assistance and detailed briefings on WTO issues.</p>
<p>These activities are improving Commonwealth developing countries'; trade policy capacity and engagement with regional bodies such as the Pacific Island Forum.</p>
<p>This new contribution is part of the Australian Government's broader $31 million package of trade-related assistance in 2003-04.  Australia';s trade assistance has increased by more than 70 per cent since 1996-97 and has responded quickly and positively to the needs of developing countries.</p>
