PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW WITH ANNETTE MARNER, ABC ADELAIDE<br />
21 SEPTEMB3ER 1989<br />
E 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
MARNER: Well your itinerary includes such places as The Whyalla<br />
Workers' Club, the BHP Long Products Division and so forth. Many<br />
people would Bay that that's really the hub of ALP support in<br />
regional Sth Australia and yet many of your critics would argue<br />
they're the very people that have been alienated from the govt<br />
through your tough economic policies. Do you agree?<br />
P14; No I don't know where many of the critics are that<br />
you're talking about. -I think it's an historical exercise as far<br />
as the govt is concerned. We are receiving the clear endorsement<br />
of these people for two basic reasons. one, we have ensured the<br />
creation of an enormous amount of jobs more than one and half<br />
million jobs since we've been in office through our policies<br />
which is twice* as fast as the rest of the world and five times<br />
faster than existed before we came to office and that's what they<br />
want, security of employm~ ent and also we're ensuring that there<br />
is a very equitable creation of social services to families,<br />
increasing the education opportunities for their children these<br />
are the sort of things which a Labor Govt has traditionally been<br />
committed to do but wbich in the past hasn't been able to do as<br />
effectively as we are.<br />
MARNER: You don't see those six and half years as P14 has in any<br />
way distanced you from the ordinary Australian.<br />
PM: Well I suggest you ought to walk around with me as I go<br />
round these centres and you wouldn't ask that question. I still<br />
have the same rapport with the ordinary people of Australia as<br />
I've always had and that's because I've been with and of them for<br />
now almost 30 years in public life. So if you have any...<br />
about that I suggest next time I'm going around you might come<br />
with me.<br />
MARNER: Well I might take you up on that. There are elements<br />
within the unions that have expressed concern about your handling<br />
of the airlires dispute.<br />
PMt . you may I say with respect are very selective in<br />
what you Why don't you refer to the facts. The Secretary<br />
of ACTU Mr Kelty and the incoming President of the ACTU </p>
<p>PM ( cont) : Mr Ferguson again last night have expressed total<br />
endorsement and support of what the is doing. When of<br />
course you have a movement as large as the Australian Trade Union<br />
Movement you'll get some people who want to express a different<br />
point of view. But the President and the Secretary representing<br />
the Trade Union Movement have fully endorsed our handling as you<br />
would expect they would because it's not a very difficult thing<br />
to understand. What we are about in rejecting the claims for the<br />
pilots is to say that the whole of the Trade Union Movement has<br />
exercised restraint under the Accord which has created one and<br />
half million new jobs because people with power have not used it.<br />
People who could have gone out and grabbed more wages haven't<br />
done it. They've exercised restraint. And we're protecting that<br />
situation and protecting Australia. When you have 1600 people<br />
who have the power to say to the rest of the community go to<br />
hell, we'll have 30% which increases are equal to what the rest<br />
of you are getting in the whole of the year of course the Trade<br />
Union Movement as a whole is going to say ' good on you, you<br />
support the restraint system which we'ye practiced ourselves'.<br />
It's not surprising.<br />
MARNER: Dick Halt, past President of the Aust Fed of Air Pilots<br />
in his full page ad in many of our papers today has said ' it's an<br />
attack on the most important principle in Australian industrial<br />
relations# ' your right', he's addressing this to the pilots,<br />
' your right of freedom of association, your freedom to negotiate<br />
with your own employer', how do you feel about those criticisms?<br />
PM: fully what Capt Halt's saying. He has followed a<br />
principle which he dearly wants to protect. When he was head of<br />
the pilots, they followed exactly this principle they said, we<br />
don't give a damn about the rest of the community, if we want x%<br />
increase, x improvement in conditions, we will go and hold a gun<br />
at the airlines' head. That was the principle which Halt and his<br />
colleagues followed and the only question that was in issue when<br />
the Fed in the past followed this " principle", as they held the<br />
gun at the airlines' head, was which would fall over first,<br />
Ansett or Australian. That was their principle. Hold the gun at<br />
the heads, say this is what we want, and they always got it.<br />
That of course is a precious principle f or pilots lovely<br />
principle. Have some power, exercise it, knock the boss over,<br />
ruin the system in the process. It was the principle followed by<br />
the pilots which produced the situation of an average $ 80,00<br />
salary per year for 8 hours flying at the stick a beautiful<br />
principle. I'm not surprised that they think it's the best<br />
principle in the world a cherished principle that they should<br />
adhere to. The only problem is, they're not going to be able to<br />
because the principle that's been followed by the rest of the<br />
Australian workforce is saying no, we won't use our naked power,<br />
we'll exercise restraint, and in doing that..... create a more<br />
competitive Australian economy. So the pilots Fed can talk about<br />
their precious principle of the gun at the head, but they've got<br />
to understand that that precious principle is gone. </p>
<p>HARI4ER: But the principle of freedom to negotiate with your own<br />
employer, is that something you support?<br />
PM: We support the system under which of course unions<br />
within the wage guidelines of the centralised wage system are<br />
doing now. What is happening now, right around this country<br />
under the metal trades award, and elsewhere, there are<br />
negotiations going on between unions and employers to give effect<br />
to these principles. Of course we accept that. We do not accept<br />
the so called principle, I mean it is straight out blackmail,<br />
spelt " principle" according to the pilots, whereby their concept<br />
is no, all those concepts go out the window where your own<br />
perception of interest has to be measured against the national<br />
interest. That goes out, and their negotiation simply was to say<br />
to the airlines, 30% increase that's it, no adherence to the<br />
Industrial Relations Commission's guidelines, what everyone else<br />
is doing, there's our negotiation, 30% and planned from February<br />
might I tell you, planned from February in their own documents, a<br />
commitment to close down the industry entirely. Now don't let's<br />
go on, I mean I can't really understand how someone at this stage<br />
like yourself, can be talking about their principles, and their<br />
willingness to negotiate when from February, their stated<br />
intention was to take everyone on in the community, shut the<br />
industry down. So don't talk about their principles.<br />
MARNER: Mr Hawke how do you f eel about Mr Peacock? He's also<br />
had a full page ad in many of our papers today, with the<br />
headlines " Mr Hawke for Australia's sake, sit down and talk' and<br />
I'll just quote you a piece from it ' To win a point you' he<br />
says, ' seem determined to sacrifice the tourist industry, small<br />
business, the economy and the nation, all to prop up an outdated<br />
wages system which is holding Australia back'. Is the Accord<br />
outdated? PM: No. And it's very interesting. The other day when Mr<br />
Peacock was saying the same thing the very, very, same day in<br />
which he was saying this, that the wages system had broken down<br />
and was outdated, in the Australian Fin Review you had the Fin<br />
Review itself making quite clear the very opposite because they<br />
spelt out the achievements of the Accord and there what the Fin<br />
Review was saying on the same day as Mr Peacock was saying the<br />
wage system was gone, they were spelling out the achievements of<br />
the Accord. Just let me read you from the same day's Fin Review.<br />
It said, this is 14r Stutchbury in Fin Review, 11 would like to<br />
report that the Hawke govt's Wages Accord is crumbling under the<br />
weight of the pilots' dispute, it would make a good story.<br />
However, only mugs allocate their portfolios on the basis of good<br />
stories'. And he then went on to talk about the massive<br />
restructuring, the bringing up to date of conditions in<br />
industry, and then he says this " the Accord has kept the lid on<br />
wage inflation during what has been Australia's biggest economic<br />
boom since at least the early 709. Under the Wages Accord the<br />
ACTU has deliberately facilitated the biggest redistribution of<br />
national income from wages to profits for at least a generation. </p>
<p>PM ( cont) This fact seems to be conveniently forgotten by those<br />
who are now squawking for an abandonment of any centralised rein<br />
on aggregate labor costs." And they conclude, * the Accord has<br />
underwritten the corporate profit boom which in turn is funding<br />
the current surge in business investments". So at the very same<br />
time that this discredited Liberal leader is saying that the<br />
wages system is holding Australia back, the independent financial<br />
authority in this country, newspaper, is pointing out precisely<br />
what has been achieved. It's this wages system which has brought<br />
about the move to profits in a way which has allowed investment<br />
to reach the highest level in the history of this country and<br />
which is sustaining the growth of Australia. But of course Mr<br />
Peacock who doesn't A, understand anything about economics, and<br />
B, of course is discredited within his own party, the moves are<br />
already starting to get rid of him. Now there you have a<br />
situation where in his desperation he's just setting his face<br />
against the recognised facts.<br />
MARNERt Is the Accord in any real danger?<br />
PM: The Accord was in danger from the beginning of the<br />
pilots' dispute if the pilots had been allowed to get away with<br />
Just holding the gun at the head of Australia. And that was why<br />
from day one, I said, on behalf of this country, you are not<br />
going to get away with it. It would have been destroyed if the<br />
pilots had been successful and with the destruction of the Accord<br />
would have been the destruction of all these achievements that<br />
the Fin Review is properly spelling out. The economic future of<br />
this country is only in danger if you allow the pilots and their<br />
supporters, Mr Peacock, to get away with the destruction of the<br />
wages system which has brought all these benefits.<br />
MARNER:, The Accord though is an agreement between some of our<br />
major players in the whole wages system in Australia, should it<br />
have legal status?<br />
PM: Well it has its legal ramifications in that the<br />
principles of the Accord are reflected in the way in which the<br />
Industrial Relations Commission is making their decisions. And<br />
then those awards then have the force of law.<br />
MARt4ER: You've had six and half years in govt. has this been<br />
your most challenging time?<br />
PM:, What at the moment? Oh, I don't know that you'd say<br />
the most challenging, every day is a challenge, but I think it's<br />
right to say that it's been the most important for the reasons<br />
that I've just been talking about because of the danger that's<br />
involved to th-3 system. I mean at no point before has there been<br />
such a challenge to the fundamental underlying the way in which<br />
the economy has recovered. I mean we've had as I say and that's<br />
the position where we are creating jobs in this country twice as<br />
fast as the rest of the world five times faster than under Mr<br />
Peacock's mob before when they were in govt. And all of that has </p>
<p>PM ( cont) been done on the basis of wage restraint and never<br />
before has there been a challenge like this to the restraint that<br />
Australians are exercising. So in that sense a challenge, but in<br />
the personal sense, no, I mean there have been times before which<br />
were just as busy and tough and hard.<br />
MARNER: The trade figures are due out mid morning today, your<br />
expectations of those figures.<br />
PM: I'll only say this that both Paul Keating and I have<br />
said Annette, at the time of the budget and before that, that we<br />
expected the first six months of this financial year, in other<br />
words July to December, we expected those to be pretty tough and<br />
we wouldn't see the really easing-off until the second half of<br />
the financial year but what the specific figure would be I'm not<br />
predicting that.<br />
End </p>
