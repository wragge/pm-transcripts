Island countries at the forefront of climate change impacts will be given a stronger voice in international talks, through a training initiative announced today.</p>
<p>A new $750,000 training program will help to develop the negotiating skills of government officers in Pacific, Indian and Caribbean Ocean island developing countries.</p>
<p>This will give these countries a stronger voice at the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change meetings.</p>
<p>The training program will help these government officers in small island developing states to improve their consultation and engagement strategies.</p>
<p>The training will also help bolster their negotiating skills in global climate change discussions outside of the UNFCCC meetings.</p>
