    <content><![CDATA[<p>Today the Commonwealth Government announced that both the Disaster Recovery Payment and the Disaster Recovery Allowance will be provided to eligible residents affected by the Sampson Flat Bushfire in the Mount Lofty Ranges region of South Australia.</p>
<p>This is a difficult time for those affected by the bushfire, which has had a devastating impact on local communities.</p>
<p>We also thank our remarkable fire fighters and rescue crews who, through their dedication and selflessness, have ensured that there has been no loss of life.</p>
<p>The Commonwealth Government assistance announced today is over and above the support already being provided under the jointly funded Commonwealth-State Natural Disaster Relief and Recovery Arrangements, which were announced on Sunday.</p>
<p>People eligible for the Disaster Recovery Payment â those who have lost their homes or suffered injury as a result of the disaster â can access a one-off payment of $1000 per adult and $400 for each child.</p>
<p>People eligible for the Disaster Recovery Allowance can access income assistance for up to 13 weeks, equivalent to the maximum rate of Newstart Allowance or Youth Allowance. This assistance is designed to help employees, primary producers and sole traders recovering from the Sampson Flat bushfire to get back on their feet.</p>
<p>The Government recognises the importance of maintaining the workforce in the disaster affected area and supporting longer term local and regional economic and community recovery.</p>
<p>Claims can be made online at <a href="http://www.humanservices.gov.au">www.humanservices.gov.au</a> or by calling the Commonwealth Government Information Hotline on 180 22 66 from 8am to 8pm local time, Monday to Friday.</p>
<p>Completed claim forms can also be lodged in person at a Commonwealth Government Department of Human Services service centre.</p>
<p>Further information on Commonwealth Government assistance is available online at <a href="http://www.disasterassist.gov.au">www.disasterassist.gov.au</a>.</p>
<p>The thoughts of all Australians are with those who have been affected by the Sampson Flat fire.</p>
