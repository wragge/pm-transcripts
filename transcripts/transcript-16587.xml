    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Australian Government today announced additional assistance to flood-affected residents of South-East Queensland, the North Coast and the Northern Rivers regions of New South Wales. </p>
<p>Thousands of people throughout South-East Queensland and northern NSW have been affected by the flooding and now face the huge task of cleaning up.</p>
<p>The Australian Government Disaster Recovery Payment will be made available to people adversely affected by the floods that began on 20 May in South-East Queensland and which have also inundated parts of the North Coast and Northern Rivers regions of NSW. Those eligible will be able to receive a one-off lump sum payment of $1,000 for adults and $400 for each child to help their recovery. </p>
<p>The payments provide financial assistance to people whose principal place of residence has been destroyed or significantly damaged, as well as those who have been seriously injured, or have lost an immediate family member.</p>
<p>The claim period for the Australian Government Disaster Recovery Payment is open for six months.</p>
<p>The Government will also provide recovery grants to small businesses and primary producers. </p>
<p>The recovery grants, through the Natural Disaster Relief and Recovery Arrangements (NDRRA), will provide small businesses and primary producers who have experienced severe flood damage with grants of up to $15,000 for clean-up and restoration activities.</p>
<p>The Government has also announced similar assistance for small businesses and primary producers affected by the flooding in northern New South Wales in late March.</p>
<p>The NSW Rural Assistance Authority will administer these payments.</p>
<p>This assistance is over and above the support being provided by the Australian Government under the long-standing Natural Disaster Relief and Recovery Arrangements. </p>
<p>Through these arrangements with the states, the Australian Government assists with the costs and resourcing of response and recovery activities associated with natural disasters. </p>
<p>The Australian Government will continue to work with the Queensland and NSW Governments and local community organisations to support individuals and families as they get on with the job of repairing their homes damaged by the storms and floods. </p>
<p>Information on the Australian Government Disaster Recovery Payment is available through the Australian Government's Qld/NSW Floods May 2009 Hotline on 180 2233 or by visiting your local Centrelink office. More information on Australian Government assistance is available at <a href="http://www.disasterassist.gov.au">www.disasterassist.gov.au</a>.</p>
<p>Information on the small business and primary producer grants is available from the NSW Rural Assistance Authority on 02 6391 3000 or freecall 1800 678 593, or via email <a href="mailto:rural.assist@raa.nsw.gov.au">rural.assist@raa.nsw.gov.au</a></p>
