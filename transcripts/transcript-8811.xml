STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
HEWSON'S HOLLOW PLEDGE TO AUSTRALIA'S WOMEN<br />
I welcome Dr Hcwson's belated discovery that Australian women have special needs<br />
descering appropriate-and sometimes special policies, but it is a shame that he still does<br />
not really understand what those nccds are.<br />
Even worse, today he has demonstrated he is not interested in learning by refusing an<br />
invitation to meet with Australia's leading women's organisation.<br />
Last July when Dr Hcwson addressed the Fifth National Women's Conferenec of the_<br />
LifriioLPbrty he repudiated the need to have special policies: " Treating women as women<br />
almost by definition implies that women are different. We can say, for instance, that<br />
women have different health needs, different work requirements and different educational<br />
difficulties. And in doing so, we run the risk of unfavourably tagging women and<br />
labelling all individuals with problems that only apply to some".<br />
He's come a lon&amp; way since then. Earlier this week in Brisbanc, when he released his<br />
Pledge to the Women of Australia at a private girls school, he acknowledged what Labor<br />
has always known and actcd upon: the needs are different of women and it's important<br />
when you put a policy package together to actually rccognisc those different<br />
circumstances and those differcnt needs and make sure that public policy is directed to<br />
dealing with those".<br />
The Labor Govcniicnt has always done this and will continue to do so. Labor does not<br />
need to resort to flimsy one-pagc pledges hastily cobbled together at the last minute. We<br />
have a proud track record: the New National Agenda for Women which I will outline<br />
next week, is a comprehensive blueprint setting out the government's plans for achieving<br />
gender equality by 2000. It has been drawn up after extensive consultations and research<br />
with a large number of Australian women. 5. Feb. 93 15: 26 No. 009 P. 01/ 02 </p>

Today met Sue Walpole, Australia's new Sox Discrimination Commissioner, and want to<br />
take this opportunityt6-cTxprcss my confidence in her determination to fight hard for<br />
working women, particularly her plans to make use of the recent amendments to the Act<br />
relating to industrial awards and workplace aireements.<br />
Dr Hcwson is vague about how a coalition governmient would treat the policy and<br />
advisory bodies that are so important to ensuring we havc sound and appropriate advie<br />
on women. His Fightback Stratcgy for Women document says the Hum an Rights and<br />
Equal Opportunity Commission will be maintained but that ' alternative dispute resolution<br />
procedurcs will be encouraged". What does this mean? Will thc Sex Discrimination<br />
Commissioner be ablc to tak * e on discriminatory employers, or will she be forced to turn a<br />
blind eye to exploitative practices?<br />
Similarly, Dr Hewson says he will maintain the Naitional Women's Consultative Council<br />
but only today he refused an invitation to attend thc Council's next meeting later this<br />
month. I attended two Council meetings last year and found them to bc an invaluable<br />
source or information and advicc.<br />
Obviously DT Howson is not interested in listening to the views of Australia's pre-erninent<br />
representative body of women. He thinks he already knows all the answers. Australian<br />
women are not that easily footed.<br />
