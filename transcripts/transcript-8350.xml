PRIME MI T<br />
FOR MEDIA 8 NOVEMBER 1991<br />
The present Secretary of the Department of Foreign Affairs and<br />
Trade, Mr Richard Woolcott, AO, is nearing the end of a long and<br />
distinguished career in that Department, and has advised the<br />
Government of his plan to retire on and from 15 February 1992.<br />
Mr Woolcott joiLned the then Department of External Affairs as a<br />
trainee in 1950, and after posting to a range of places became<br />
our Ambassador in Jakarta ( 1975-78), Ambassador in Manila<br />
( 1978-82) and Ambassador and Permanent Representative at the<br />
United Nations in New York ( 1982-88) before taking up his<br />
appointment as Secretary in 1988.<br />
One of the many notable achievements was his period as Austral. ian<br />
representative on the Security Council in 1985-86 and as<br />
President of the Security Council in November 1986.<br />
More recently, he was my Special Envoy in the initiative to<br />
promote a regional economic forum for Asia and the Pacific<br />
( APEC).<br />
But he will be remembered most for his dedicated and professional<br />
service for so many years and for so many governments.<br />
The Government will be recommending to the Governor-General the<br />
appointment in his place, from 15 February 1992, of Dr Peter<br />
Wilenski, AO.<br />
Dr Wilenski has held a number of posts at Secretary level for<br />
much of the past two decades including a period as Chairman of<br />
the then Public; Service Board and, before taking up his present<br />
position as our Ambassador and Permanent Representative at the!<br />
United Nations, as Secretary of the Department of Transport anid<br />
Communications.. Dr Wilenski's early career in the public sector was spent in the<br />
then Department: of Foreign Affairs. In a number of the positions<br />
he has held since, he has been closely involved in international<br />
as well as natiLonal affairs.<br />
He has also made, over the years, a notable contribution to<br />
management improvement in the public sector.<br />
Since his appoiLntment there nearly three years ago, Dr Wilenski<br />
has been an out~ standing representative for Australia at the<br />
United Nations and he is eminently well qualified to take over<br />
from Mr Woolcoltt the secretaryship of the Department of Foreign<br />
Affairs and Trade. </p>
