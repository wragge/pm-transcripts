EMBARGOED AGAINST DELIVERY<br />
R SIi~ lib, RA 11A,<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER FOUNDATION STONE CEREMONY<br />
NEW PARLIAMENT HOUSE, 4 OCTOBER 1983<br />
I AM HONOURED TO BE TAKING PART IN THIS IMPORTANT<br />
CEREMONY, SYMBOLISING AS IT DOES OUR CONFIDENCE IN THE<br />
FUTURE OF PARLIAMENTARY DEMOCRACY IN THIS GREAT NATION<br />
OF OURS,<br />
ALTHOUGH A RELATIVELY YOUNG NATION, WE HAVE INHERITED<br />
A FINE TRADITION OF PARLIAMENTARY DEMOCRACY,<br />
THIS IS AN OCCASION TO REAFFIRM OUR BELIEF IN THE<br />
PRIMACY OF PARLIAMENT IN THE AUSTRALIAN DEMOCRATIC<br />
SYSTEM.<br />
ALTHOUGH THE PARLIAMENT HAS COME UNDER CRITICISM OVER<br />
THE YEARS SINCE FEDERATION, IT REMAINS OUR PRINCIPAL<br />
VEHICLE FOR ENSURING THAT GOVERNMENTS ARE RESPONSIBLE<br />
AND RESPONSIVE TO THE WISHES OF THE ELECTORS,<br />
THE ESSENCE OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARLIAMENT IS THAT THE<br />
WHOLE POLICY AND PERFORMANCE OF GOVERNMENT MUST BE OPEN<br />
TO SCRUTINY, OPEN TO CRITICISM AND. FINALLY, OPEN TO THE<br />
JUDGEMENT OF THE ELECTORS,<br />
LIKE ALL NATIONS WHICH HAVE ADOPTED THE WEST'MINSTER<br />
SYSTEM OF RESPONSIBLE'GOVERNMENT, WE HAVE EVOLVED OUR<br />
OWN STYLE ONE ADAPTED TO OUR NEEDS AND NATIONAL<br />
CHARACTER. </p>
<p>THERE ARE, AND SHOULD BE, OTHER AVENUES FOR KEEPING<br />
GOVERNMENTS IN TOUCH WITH THE COMM1UNITY AND ENSURING<br />
THEIR PARTICULAR ACTIONS ARE ACCOUNTABLE,<br />
THIS GOVERNMENT IS ESPECIALLY KEEN TO DEVELOP A STRONG<br />
SENSE OF COM1MUNICATION AND CONSULTATION WITH THE<br />
COMMUNITY ON PARTICULAR ISSUES OF CONCERN. THE SUCCESS OF<br />
THE NATIONAL ECON~ OMiIC SUMMIT, WHICH WAS HELD IN THE PRESENT<br />
PARLIAMENT HOUSE, EMPHASISES THE VALUE OF FRESH CHANNELS OF<br />
COMMAUNICATION. IN AN OPEN SOCIETY THE PARTICULAR ACTIONS OF GOVERNMENT,<br />
AS THEY AFFECT INDIVIDUALS AND SECTORS OF THE COMMUNITY,<br />
HAVE TO BE MADE ACCOUNTABLE BY CRITICISM IN THE MEDIA<br />
BY REDRESS IN THE COURTS, BY COMMUNITY GROUPS PURSUING THEIR<br />
SPECIAL GRIEVANCES DIRECTLY WITH GOVERNMENT.<br />
BUT NONE OF THIS DETRACTS FROM THE TRADITIONAL AND<br />
CONSTITUTIONAL ROLE OF THE PARLIAMENT AS THE CENTRE OF<br />
POLITICAL LIFE.<br />
THE PARLIAMENT IS, AND I TRUST WILL ALWAYS BE, THE<br />
HIGHEST PUBLIC FORUM IN THE LAND. ONLY IN THE<br />
PARLIAMENT ARE BASIC POLITICAL ISSUES DEBATED AS A<br />
MATTER OF COURSE.<br />
THE<br />
IT IS e PLACE WHERE GOVERNMENTS ARE PUBLICLY AND<br />
CONTINUOUSLY ACCOUNTABLE FOR THEIR STE',' ARDSHIP. i~ i / 3 </p>
<p>IT IS THE PLACE K'HERE THE GOVERNMENT'S POLICIES,<br />
AFFECTING THE WHOLE PATTERN AND DIRECTION OF OUR<br />
NATIONAL LIFE; ARE SUBJECTED TO THE CLOSEST SCRUTINY.<br />
IT IS tHE PLACE WHERE MINI STERS ARE INDIVIDUALLY AND<br />
COLLECTIVELY ANSWERABLE FOR THEIR ACTIONSi BOTH<br />
CONSTITUTIONALLY AND POLITICALLY. ULTIMATELYj THE<br />
GOVERNMENT nU5L1 FACE THE PARLIAMENT BECAUSE THE<br />
PARLIAM-ENT ALONE HAS THE RIGHT TO APPROVE OR DISAPPROVE<br />
LEGISLATION AND THE FUNDS WHICH ARE THE MEANS BY WHICH<br />
A GOVERNMENT GOVERNS AT ALL. THROUGH THE PARLIAMENT.,<br />
AND MOST PARTICULARLY THROUGH THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,<br />
THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE FINDS EXPRESSION.<br />
THE PARLIAMENT IS THE PLACE WHERE THE PEOPLE OF<br />
AUSTRALIA CAN SEE THEIR NATIONAL GOVERNMENT, THEIR<br />
INDIVIDUAL MEMBERS AND SENATORS WORKING. ON. THEIR BEHALF.<br />
IT IS THE PLACE WHERE ALL AUSTRALIANS FEEL FREE TO<br />
VISIT, WHETHER FOR A SPECIFIC MATTER OF BUSINESS OR<br />
SIMPLY TO SEE THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS AT FIRST HAND.<br />
THE DESIGN OF THIS NEW PARLIAMENT HOUSE AND ITS SITING<br />
IN THIS PROMINENT LOCATION IN THE NATIONAL CAPITAL<br />
MUST ENHANCE THE TRADITIONAL PLACE OF THE PARLIAMENT<br />
IN OUR SOCIETY. v / 14 </p>
<p>THE PHYSICAL EXCELLENCE OF THE DESIGN CANNOT BY ITSELF:<br />
ENSURE THAT PARLIAMENTARY DEMOCRACY WILL FLOURISH. BUT<br />
THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT THAT THE FACILITIES TO BE PROVIDED<br />
BY IT FOR POLITICIANS AND THE PUBLIC GENERALLY, MUST<br />
CONTRIBUTE TO THE QUALITY OF THE ENDEAVOURS OF ' IEMBERS<br />
AND THE QUALITY OF THE ACCESS TO MENSERS BY THE PEOPLE<br />
THEY REPRESENT.<br />
THE NEW PARLIAMENT HOUSE WILL,. WITH ITS GREAT PUBLIC<br />
AREAS WHICH WILL ALLOW VISITORS TO SEE AND FEEL THE<br />
PARLIAMENTARY PROCESSi MEET THE EXPECTATIONS OF OUR<br />
STYLE OF PARLIAMENTARY DEMOCRACY,<br />
IT REFLECTS THE INFORMALITY OF THE AUSTRALIAN CHARACTER<br />
WHILE MAINTAINING THE DIGNITY WHICH THE INSTITUTION<br />
ITSELF DESERVES.<br />
THE ELECTORAL PROCESS IS AT THE HEART OF THE SYSTEM<br />
OF PARLIAMENTARY DEMOCRACY.<br />
[ ly GOVERNMENT CAME TO OFFICE COMMITTED TO A PROGRAM OF<br />
ELECTORAL REFORM AND CONSTITUTIONAL CHANGE. NOT CHANGE<br />
FOR THE SAKE OF CHANGE, BUT CHANGE IN THE BELIEF THAT<br />
OUR NEEDS COULD BETTER BE CATERED FOR.<br />
RECENTLY THE JOINT PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEE ON' ELECTORAL<br />
REFORM TABLED ITS REPORT. v i </p>
<p>THAT COMMITTEE HAS MADE A COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW OF THE<br />
AUSTRALIAN ELECTORAL SYSTEM AND HAS, I BELIEVE, MADE A SIGNIFICANT<br />
CONTRIBUTION TO INFORMED DISCUSSION ON4 THESE MATTERS,<br />
SOME OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS RELATING TO PROPOSALS FOR<br />
A LONGER PARLIAMENTARY TERM, SIMULTANEOUS ELECTIONS AND<br />
AN INCREASE IN THE SIZE OF THE PARLIAMENT HAVE ALREADY<br />
BEEN THE SUBJECT OF A GREAT DEAL OF DISCUSSION.<br />
MANY OF THEIR PROPOSALS HAVE MERIT AND WOULD UNDOUBTEDLY IMPROVE<br />
THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR PARLIAMENT,<br />
THERE MUST BE DEBATE ABOUT THE MERITS OF CERTAIN SPECIFIC<br />
PROPOSALS0 I HOPE THAT A CONSENSUS CAN BE FORGED UNITING<br />
MEN AND WOMEN OF ALL POLITICAL PERSUASIONS AROUND A<br />
PACKAGE OF MEASURES WHICH WILL MAKE THE PARLIAMENT NOT<br />
ONLY MORE TRULY REPRESENTATIVE BUT MORE EFFICIENT IN<br />
REPRESENTING THE INTERESTS OF THE PEOPLE,<br />
MR CHAIRMAN, IT IS A SINGULAR PERSONAL HONOUR TO BE<br />
ASSOCIATED WITH THIS IMPORTANT CEREMONY. BUT THE<br />
SYMBOLISM IN THE LAYING OF A FOUNDATION STONE OVERSHADOWS<br />
ANY PERSONAL FEELINGS,<br />
THIS STONE SYMBOLISES OUR CONCEPTS OF PARLIAMENTARY<br />
DEMOCRACY; IT REPRESENTS THE BASE ON WHICH WE MAY<br />
CONTINUE TO BUILD AUSTRALIAN DEMOCRACY, ,/ 6 </p>
<p>I WANT TO PAY TRIBUTE TO ALL THOSIE ASSOCIATED WITH<br />
THIS MAGNIFICENT ENTERPRISE, WE ARE NOW SEEING THE<br />
REWARDS OF THEIR LABOURS,<br />
I AM ADVISED THAT THE BUILDING PROGRAM IS PROCEEDING<br />
VERY SATISFACTORILY INDEED, THAT IT IS NOW AHEAD<br />
OF SCHEDULE, THIS IS DUE IN PART TO THE HARD WORK<br />
AND DEDICATED EFFORT OF ALL THOSE INVOLVED I COMMEND<br />
TH I S,<br />
WE ALL LOOK FORWARD TO THE COMPLETION OF WHAT WILL<br />
UNDOUBTEDLY BE AUSTRALIA'S PREMIER BUILDING, </p>
