I-uCK), IKEVAN ( GOSPER),<br />I AM HOINOURED TO HAVE BEEN MADE THE N1' Li*' fER ONE 1M1EMBER OF<br />THE OLYMPIC SUPPORTERS CLUBS<br />SAll PARTICULARLY DELIGHTED To HAVE RECEIVED THiS HONOUR<br />ALONGSIDE SUCH GREAT ATHLETES AND FINE REPRESENTATIVES<br />OF AUSTRALIA AS RAEtEE BoYLE AND ROBERT KAGBASO<br />I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU HAVE ASKED ME TO ACCEPT THJS<br />MEIP1EP. SHIP PRIMARILY AS Pr1m4E MI1lNISTER, BUT IT IS ONE OF THE<br />TASKS THAT IA ASKED TO TAKE ON WHICH ALSO GIVES I'E<br />PERSONAL PLEASURE,<br />ACCORDINGLY I AM PARTICULARLY DELIGHTED TO BE INVOLVED WITH<br />AND TO BE SUPPORIAVE OF AUSTRALIA'S OLYMPIC EFFORT,<br />SPORT HAS TRADITIOr'ALL. Y OCCUPIED A FRO: 1i-NENT PLACE IN<br />AuSTRALIAN SOCIElY AND CULTURE.</p>
<p>-2-<br />IT IS CLAIMED BY SOME THAT IT HAS BEEN TOO PROMINENT, AND<br />HAS OVERSHADOWED THE DEVELOPMENT OF OTHER CULTURAL ACTIVITIES.<br />IT HAS EVEN BEEN-SUGGESTED THAT AS PRIME MINISTER I HAVE<br />ENCOURAGED THIS,<br />I REJECT SUCH VIEWS OF TIHE ROLE OF SPORT IN AUSTRALIAN LIFE<br />AS BEING SIMPLISTIC, AND TO IGNORE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES THAT<br />ARE TAKING PLACE IN OUR NATION AND AMONGST OUR PEOPLE.<br />IT IS WIDELY RECOGNISED THAT IN RECENT YEARS AUSTRALIA HAS<br />BECOME MUCH MORE DIVERSE CULTURALLY, AND THAT., FOR EXAMPLE,<br />AUSTRALIAN FILMS, MUSIC, BALLET AND LITERATURE HAVE GAINED<br />INCREASING INTERNATIONAL RENOWN.<br />THESE ARE DEVELOPMENTS THAT LIKE ALL AUSTRALIANS I WELCOME,<br />AND THESE ARE DEVELOPMENTS WHICH MY GOVERNMENT HAS ACTIVELY<br />SUPPORTED AND ENCOURAGED.<br />AT THE SAME TIME THE REALITY IS THAT AUSTRALIANS HAVE<br />TRADITIONALLY CHOSEN TO DEVOTE A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THEIR<br />LEISURE TIME TO PARTICIPATION IN,, OR SUPPORT OF, SPORT AND<br />SPORTING EVENTS.<br />IT IS THE RESULT OF THE NATURAL ADVANTAGES PROVIDED BY OUR<br />CLIMATE.</p>
<p>IT IS A FUNCTION OF WHAT IS OFTEN REFERRED TO AS THE<br />AUSTRALIAN WAY OF LIFE,<br />IT REFLECTS THE GENUINE PRIDE THAT AUSTRALIANS HAVE TAKEN<br />IN THE INTERNATIONAL SUCCESS 0F MANY OF OUR SPORTSMEN AND<br />SPORTSWOMEN, AS WELL AS THE W; AY THEY HAVE CONDUCTED THEMSELVES<br />IN THOSE ACHIEVEMENTS,<br />IN THIS REGARD I FEEL THAT AS A NATION WE HAVE THE RIGHT TO<br />FEEL GRATIFIED BY THE SUCCESS OF MANY OF OUR ATHLETES IN PAST<br />OLYMPIC GAMES, AND BY THE ENTHUSIASM AND COMMITMENT OF THE<br />THOUSANDS OF OTHERS WHO HAVE DONE THEIR BEST WHILE<br />REPRESENTING AUSTRALIA,<br />NY GOVERNMENT'S SUPPORT FOR SPORT OPERATES AT TWO LEVELS,<br />AT ONE LEVEL WE ARE COMMITTED TO PROMOTING AND ENCOURAGING<br />THE PURSUIT OF EXCELLENCE IN SPORT,<br />AT ANOTHER LEVEL WE CONSIDER IT IMPORTANT THAT THERE SHOULD<br />BE WIDESPREAD COMMUNITY PARTICIPATION IN SPORT,<br />BOTH OBJECTIVES ARE IMPORTANT AND ARE MUTUALLY REINFORCING,<br />COMMUNITY PARTICIPATION IN SPORT PROMOTES A HEALTHIER, MORE<br />VITAL COMMUNITY A COMMUNITY LIKELY TO BRING A MORE ENERGETIC,<br />MORE PRODUCTIVE APPROACH TO THE NEEDS OF CONTEMPORARY AUSTRALIA, / t</p>
<p>OVER THE YEARS WE HAVE PRODUCED MANY INTERNATIONALLY<br />SUCCESSFUL SPORTSMEN AND SPORTSWOMEN OVER A WIDE RANGE OF<br />SPORTS AND OUT OF ALL PROPORTION TO THE SIZE OF OUR<br />POPULATION, IN RECENT YEARS OUR REPUTATION FOR DOING THIS HAS TAKEN<br />SOMETHING OF A BATTERING, AND OUR RELATIVE LACK OF SUCCESS<br />HAS PROBABLY CONTRIBUTED IN PART TO THE TREMENDOUS OUTPOURING<br />OF NATIONAL FERVOR AT THE RECENT SUCCESS OF ROBERT DE CASTELLA<br />AND THE CREW OF AUSTRALIA 11.<br />THIS IS IN NO SENSE TO DETRACT FROM THEIR RESPECTIVE<br />ACHIEVEMENTS WHICH HAVE ATTRACTED INTERNATIONAL ACCLAIM.<br />( I UNDERSTAND THAT) JOHN BERTRAM IS HERE TONIGHT.<br />I'M SURE THAT HE AND EVERYONE HERE WOULD AGREE THAT WE SHOULD<br />NOW BE PRESSING TO HAVE THE I? METRE CLASS INCLUDED AS AN<br />OLYMPIC YACHTING EVENT,<br />BUT ON A MORE SERIOUS NOTE WHAT IS DEMONSTRATED BY THE SUCCESS<br />OF ROBERT DE CASTELLA AND BY THE CREW OF AUSTRALIA II IS THAT<br />DEDICATION AND HARD WORK ON THE PART OF THE ATHLETES., WITH<br />EFFECTIVE INSTITUTIONAL AND FINANCIAL SUPPORT, ARE ESSENTIAL<br />INGREDIENTS OF SUCH ACHIEVEMENTS.</p>
<p>THE AUSTRALIAN OLYMPIC FEDERATION MOTTO FOR 1981 " TEAM UP<br />FOR AUSTRALIA" STRIKES THE RIGHT NOTE,<br />OUR OLYMPIANS ARE NOT IN IT FOR THEMSELVES,<br />THEY WILL BE IN SARAJEVO AND Los ANGELES AS AUSTRALIAN<br />REPRESENTATI VES.<br />WE KNOW THAT IN THE LEAD UP TO THE OLYMPIC GAMES AND AT THE<br />GAMES THEMSELVES, THOSE SELECTED FOR THE AUSTRALIAN TEAM<br />WILL GIVE OF THEIR BEST&amp;<br />WE ALSO OF COURSE HOPE THAT THE TEAM WILL WIN A NUMBER OF<br />MEDALS FOR AUSTRALIA ALTHOUGH OUR EXPECTATIONS MUST BE<br />TEMPERED BY THE RECOGNITION THAT THE COMPETITION IN SARAJEVO<br />AND Los ANGELES WILL BE TOUGHER THAN EVER BEFORE,<br />BUT WE CAN BE ENCOURAGED THAT AT PRESENT OUR MEN'S HOCKEY<br />TEAM IS RANKED NUMBER ONE IN THE WORLD AND THE WOMEN'S 1HOCKEY<br />TEAM NUMBER FOUR,<br />ROBERT DE CASTELLA IS THEWORLD CHAMPION MARATHON RUNNER,<br />AND HAS PERFORMED SUPERBLY OVER THE PAST YEAR IN BRISBANE,<br />ROTTERDAM AND HELSINKI<br />AND AUSTRALIA AT PAST OLYMIPICS HAS PERFORMED CREDITABLY IN<br />SWIMMING., ATHLETICS., CYCLING., YACHTING AND EQUESTRIAN EVENTS,<br />AND WE NOVI LOOK FORWARD AGAIN TO GOOD PERFORMANCES IN THESE<br />AND OIHER EVENTS IN SARAJEVO AND Los ANGELES,</p>
<p>BUT AS I SAID RECENTLY, WHEN I VISITED THE AUSTRALIAN<br />INSTITUTE OF SPORT, AUSTRALIA HAS SOME DISTANCE TO GO TO<br />CATCH UP TO THOSE COUNTRIES WHICH IN RECENT YEARS HAVE<br />ENJOYED MOST SUCCESS IN THE OLYMPIC GAMES, BOTH IN TERMS<br />OF FACILITIES AND THE SCIENTIF'IC PREPARATION AVAILABLE TO<br />ITS ATHLETES,<br />THIS GAP IS NOW BEING CLOSED, AND I AM GREATLY ENCOURAGED<br />AND IMPRESSED BY THE WORK BEING DONE AT THE INSTITUTE.<br />BUT WE MUST RECOGNISE THAT WE CANNOT EXPECT MIRACLES OVERNIGHT<br />FROM OUR ATHLETES.<br />To MAXIMISE AUSTRALIA'S REPRESENTATION AT THE OLYMPIC GAMES IN<br />SARAJEVO AND Los ANGELES, AND TO ENSURE THAT OUR ATHLETES HAVE<br />EVERY OPPORTUNITY TO GIVE OF THEIR BEST AT THE GAMES IT IS<br />ESSENTIAL THAT THE OLYMPIC SUPPORTERS CLUB IS SUCCESSFUL IN<br />ITS FUND-RAISING TASK.<br />THE $ 1.4 MILLION CONTRIBUTED DIRECTLY BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT<br />IS BUT A START.<br />A FURTHER $ 3 MILLION IS NEEDED TO ASSIST OUR OLYMPIC<br />REPRESENTATIVES WITH THEIR ESSENTIAL PRE-GAMES TRAINING AND<br />COMPETITION PROGRAMS,</p>
<p>I ASK ALL AUSTRALIANS TO CONTRIBUTE GE'NEROUSLY THROUGH THE<br />OLYMPIC SUPPORTERS CLUB SO THAT OUR 1984 OLYMPIC TEAM WILL BE THIE<br />BEST PREPARED AND BEST EQUIPPED TEAM EVER TO REPRESENT<br />AUSTRALIA AT AN OLYMPIC GAMES,<br />THIS IS A WORTHY OBJECTIVE AND ONE THAT I BELIEVE ALL<br />AUSTRALIANS WILL SUPPORT.<br />IN THIS WAY AUSTRALIANS CAN NOT ONLY BE PROUD OF THE SUCCESS<br />OF OUR OLYMPIANS IN SARAJEVO AND LOS ANGELES, BUT CAN BE PART<br />OF THAT SUCCESS.<br />I AM CONFIDENT THAT THE AUSTRALIAN PEOPLE WILL NOT DISAPPOINT<br />THOSE FELLOW AUSTRALIANS WHO ARE PREPARED TO SACRIFICE MUCH<br />TO REPRESENT THEIR COUNTRY IN SARAJEVO AND Los ANGELES.<br />I WARMLY COMMEND TO ALL AUSTRALIANS THE OLYMPIC SUPPORTERS<br />CLUB AS AN EFFECTIVE AND NECESSARY CONTRIBUTION TO OUR COUNTRY'S<br />REPRESENTATION AT THE 1984 OLYMPIC GA'MES,</p>
