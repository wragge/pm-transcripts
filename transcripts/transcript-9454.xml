PRIME MINISTER 112/ 94<br />
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
I was surprised and disappointed to read remarks attributed to Mr Dick<br />
Warburton in today's Australian Financial Review.<br />
Mr Warburton is quoted accusing me of making vitriolic attacks on corporate<br />
critics, and of victimising companies.<br />
This accusation is unfortunate and untrue. It is also regrettable that the<br />
Financial Review chose to give Mr Warburton's remarks such uncritical<br />
prominence without seeking comment on them from my office, and without<br />
requiring Mr Warburton to illustrate his case with any facts or concrete<br />
examples. Indeed, given the opportunity to substantiate his case on the radio program<br />
AM, Mr Warburton said he personally hadn't had such an attack, and that his<br />
experience " has been very good." When asked to give examples of<br />
companies which had been victimised, he could not name any.<br />
I prefer to be judged by what I have done for the business community, rather<br />
than by what one of its members might say of me. Low inflation, high growth,<br />
record profits and a sharply reduced corporate tax rate are, I think, more<br />
substantial and verifiable measures of the relationship between my<br />
Government and the private sector.<br />

relations.)<br />
Mr Bert Evans<br />
The chief executive of the MTIA,<br />
Mr Bert Evans, said that if the law<br />
required a company to enter negotiations<br />
with unions that did not<br />
represent any of its employees " then<br />
we ought to burn the act".<br />
" My anger over this is almost<br />
uncontrollable," Mr Evans said. " If this decision stands then this is one of<br />
the blackest days in the history of<br />
Australian industrial relations."<br />
He said that Asahi, an MTIA<br />
member, had about 60 employees,<br />
who had been approached by the<br />
Automotive Food Metals and Engineering<br />
Union but had said they were<br />
not interested in joining the union.<br />
" Now the company is supposed to<br />
sit down and negotiate with the union<br />
officials on a wage rise for people<br />
who have refused to join the union."<br />
The Asahi case arose out of moves<br />
by the AFMEU earlier this year to<br />
use the new bargaining provisions<br />
under the act as part of a strategy for<br />
recruiting members in non-unionised<br />
factories in the manufacturing sector.<br />
The AFMEU served a 14.5 per<br />
cent wage claim on about 3,000<br />
manufacturing companies that had<br />

THE Prime Minister, Mr Keating,<br />
has silenced influential critics in the<br />
business community by practising<br />
the politics of hate and victimising<br />
those who disagree with him, according<br />
to a prominent member of the<br />
Business Council and chairman of<br />
Du Pont, Mr Dick Warburton.<br />
In an interview with The Australian<br />
Financial Review, Mr Warburton,<br />
who is also a member of thb<br />
board of the Reserve Bank, says the<br />
vitriolic attacks by the Prime Minister<br />
on his corporate critics have<br />
resulted In a " Cold War" since the<br />
last Federal election that has only,<br />
recently begun to thaw, with senior<br />
businessmen still recoiling from serious<br />
debate with the Government over<br />
public policy issues.<br />
" We have been getting in much<br />
closer to the politics of hate," Mr<br />
Warburton said. " In other words: ' If<br />
you don't agree with me, I'll not only<br />
hate you, but destroy you.'<br />
" So one of the problems business<br />
has Is that while an individual h<br />
prepared to stand up and say what be<br />
means, you have to run a business<br />
And you can't afford to have your<br />
business destroyed. So you have got<br />
to be very crcmspect"<br />
The president of the BCA, Mr lan<br />
Salmon, said yesterday that the<br />
organisaton had refused to buckle to<br />
attacks from the Government: " At<br />
the end of the day, if Paul Keating<br />
can't have a relationship with business<br />
which is based on reasoned<br />
argument, then the country will be<br />
poorer for It"<br />
Mr Warburton said the tactics had<br />
stifled debate because of the concerns<br />
of corporate leaders that their own<br />
businesses could be targeted for<br />
retaliation by the Government.<br />
There had been a thawing in the<br />
" Cold War", " but it's been because<br />
of the strength of individuals like<br />
John Prescott and Bob Joss".<br />
Mr Warburton's comments will<br />
come as a shock to the Government,<br />
because he is widely regarded as a<br />
moderate and supportive business<br />
leader and has been appointed to a<br />
string of government boards and<br />
advisory bodies. He is a director of<br />

Mir Salmon said the DCA<br />
intended to continue Its role of<br />
pushing for reform. " Our task<br />
is nchngig -which Is to<br />
bring to the attention of<br />
Government changes we<br />
believe are needed for good<br />
government and the longterm<br />
successi of Australia. And<br />
that Includes being critical of<br />
its CEO, who in this case is<br />
Paul Keating."<br />
The origins of the " cold war"<br />
lie in the immnediate aftermath<br />
of the lSt Federal election,<br />
when the Prime Minister, Mr<br />
Keating, and the Treasurer, Mr<br />
Dawkins, made it known there<br />
would be ' paybrack" for organis<br />
atlon they believed had<br />
bakdthe LbeAs in the<br />
elcton campaign.<br />
According to Mr Warburton,<br />
the SCA and other industry<br />
lobby groups were pet<br />
shattered after the election by<br />
the politics of hate, when Keating and Dawins came out<br />
and said, ' Well, that's the end<br />
of those organlsations'."<br />
The Business Council<br />
found the going particularly<br />
tough during the election<br />
campaign caught between<br />
its non-party political objectives<br />
and the political use<br />
made by thf then Opposition<br />
leader, Mr John liewson, of<br />
the organisation's long-term<br />
support for a* bnmdl based<br />
consumption tax.<br />
There were also pointed<br />
attempts to tough up then BCA<br />
president and CRA chiefeec<br />
utie, Mr John Ralp^ after he<br />
agreed to serve on two Coalition<br />
committees If the Coalition<br />
won government.<br />
" Mh BCA, going Ito the<br />
election, as a totality, would<br />
more openly have supported the<br />
Liberals," Mr Warburton said<br />
" But this was because of the<br />
overriding issue of tax reform.<br />
Not the GST, but broad tax<br />
reform. Many individuals<br />
were saying, like me, that we<br />
still support a tax reform<br />
package as we did In 1955.<br />
" On dhe other handl, John<br />
Hewson got very cross<br />
because the ICA was not<br />
standing up overtly supportlag the GST. iwson's rections<br />
Ia the end started to<br />
alilenate the very people he<br />
was needing support from.<br />
" And then It was after the<br />
election that Keating slammed<br />
UL He just lumped everybody<br />
in and had a go. After the<br />
election, there was a mixture<br />
of response in the BCA. It was<br />
fets ufair that because you<br />
da. red to critiise, you were<br />
attacked Kest* i ends up<br />
Stiflng debate because most<br />
peopl dislike being persona&amp;<br />
By attacked, and they also<br />
detco~ gee t augh up in the<br />
counter attack.<br />
" If -you can't get up and<br />
have a debate without being<br />
pilloried vindictively, then<br />
you just can't have debate. It<br />
stops people coming forward<br />
to enter the debate."<br />
The Federal Government's<br />
negative response to the<br />
BCA's recent " scorecard"<br />
criticising the pace of reform<br />
in Australia had also bitten<br />
within the business community,<br />
Mr, Warburton said.<br />
,~ pagain, thi n<br />
meat doesn't mind the ticks,<br />
but. boy, they sure get upset<br />
about the crosses."<br />
