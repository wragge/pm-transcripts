EMBARGO: 7.00 p. m.<br />
.) JJAUST ALIALL<br />
FOR PRESS ' 18 SEPTEMBER 1977<br />
ELECTORATE TALK<br />
The Government is encouraged by figures which show a continuing<br />
and substantial progress in our fight against inflation.<br />
The rate of inflation as measured by what is technically called<br />
the Implicit Price Deflator is now 9.2 percent. This is<br />
7 percent less than the rate of the previous year.<br />
The Government believes this measurement, the broadest based<br />
indicator which measures inflation, and which is used throughout<br />
the world, is very real and accurate evidence-of the success of<br />
our economic policies. We know that inflation is still too high.<br />
We are determined to reduce it further. Until we do just<br />
that we will not have the scope to fulfil our full potential<br />
for economic activity.<br />
Our economic strategy has remained consistent. For the second<br />
time we have produced a Budget that reduced the Government<br />
deficit by over half a billion dollars. For the second time<br />
our Budget firmly controls the rate of Government spending.<br />
And for the second time, our Budget has created conditions.<br />
to further reduce inflation and promote economic growth.<br />
The Government's approach has [) con, ndiSOun1d. Ihs been c-onsis tent.<br />
If we had not maintained -this consistent approach we would not<br />
be winning against inflation. Australians know that we have<br />
had to clamp down hard on Government spending to help us get<br />
on top of inflation. Australians understand that Labor's<br />
mad spending spree had to stop. We stopped it.<br />
It is because we have kept Government expenditure restrained<br />
and under tight control for two successive years, we have been<br />
able to restore incentive and help those in need without<br />
eroding the gains made in the fight against inflation.<br />
For instance, ouir iiodi iH c~ iti on to tnx<br />
averaging for farmers meets a most urgent need at a very<br />
difficult time. It is a demonstration of our concern to meet<br />
our responsibility to a great number of Australian families<br />
in need of special help. / 2 </p>
<p>That assistance does not represent, in any way, a change in<br />
our strategy that will bring full economic recovery.<br />
In fact, it was only possible because we stocj to that<br />
strategy and maintained control over Government spending.<br />
Again, our tax reforms the greatest in Australia's history<br />
were also only possible because of our consistent actions in<br />
economic management.<br />
Tax reform was long overdue. Every commentator, and every<br />
Australian knew this. Others just spoke about tax reform but<br />
we acted decisively and responsibly because we created the<br />
conditions where we could act.<br />
During our 21 months in office, the Government has demonstrably<br />
exercised the greatest possible restraint in its own spending.<br />
Because of this I believe we have now reached a responsible<br />
expenditure base. We could have made further cuts or<br />
put a further squeeze on Government spending. We did not,<br />
and do not, consider this necessary to achieve a return<br />
to full economic health.<br />
We are now making a good advance in establishing conditions<br />
for sustained economic progress, rising living standards<br />
and more work opportunities. Inflation is still coming down<br />
and we are confident our economic policies will make sure that<br />
it will keep coming down.<br />
Business is responding to our continuing success on the inflation<br />
front and to our incentives and initiatives such as the investment<br />
allowance and stock valuation allowance.<br />
Our decisions to clear the way for the development of the<br />
North-West Shelp and to mine and export our great uranium<br />
reserves for peaceful purposes have been welcomed by private<br />
industry. These decisions will create economic activity,<br />
they will create jobs.<br />
The Government will continue the relentless fight against<br />
inflation. We will continue with responsible economic management.<br />
We will never resort to Labor's big spending approach because<br />
we know Australia's resources are limited. Our economic<br />
strategy as outlined in the Budget will be maintained.<br />
We will consolidate and advance the achievements the<br />
Government has already made in fighting inflation and returning<br />
Australia to full economic health. </p>
