CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY<br />
OPENING ADDRESS BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
AUSTRALIAN PENSIONERS' FEDERATION<br />
BIENNIAL CONFERENCE<br />
MELBOURNE 11 OCTOBER 1989 </p>
<p>Noreen Hewett, </p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen, </p>
<p>It gives me great pleasure to come here today to open the<br />
Biennial Conference of the Australian Pensioners'<br />
Federation. I take pride, too, in being able to report to you on what we have achieved, together, on behalf not only of the age<br />
pensioners of Australia but also, in a very real and direct<br />
sense, for all Australians.<br />
For 80 years, the age pension has been the centrepiece of<br />
the Australian Social Security system.<br />
By 2009 which wil. l be the centenary year of the Australian<br />
age pension that system will be faced with its greatest<br />
challenge yet: meeting the impact of the post war " baby<br />
boom" with its vast implications for service delivery and<br />
funding.<br />
The challenge then is clear: Australians, as we move into<br />
the next century, must make sure that there is secure and<br />
adequate income support for older people.<br />
with the retirement incomes policy we announced in the last<br />
Budget, I can tell you we have set in train a comprehensive<br />
and farsighted response to that challenge.<br />
It is a strategy for the future not a random series of<br />
barzdaids; it is a policy that goes beyond the short-term to<br />
help secure the long-term future of Australia arid of our<br />
retired people; and it is a statement of relevance not only<br />
to those people who are currently retired but those who are<br />
still working and planning for their retirement.<br />
Many of you will be familiar with the specifics of the<br />
announcements we made in the Budget, so I don't want just to<br />
recite the litany of changes and improvements we have made. </p>
<p>What is of more value, I believe, is to put those changes in<br />
the context of the broad sweep of social justice policies we<br />
have pursued since we came to office in 1983.<br />
Let me give you one statement that summa'rises the whole web<br />
of anomalies and injustices that had been allowed to develop<br />
prior to 1983.<br />
In 1983, millionaires were taking the pension, while<br />
superannuation was the almost exclusive preserve of a<br />
minority of the workforce in white collar employment.<br />
What a perversion of priorities that situation representedthe<br />
very antithesis of social justice.<br />
My Government has been able to put the priorities in the<br />
right order ensuring that people who don't need to be<br />
supported by the taxpayers aren't, so tRWatTeople who do<br />
need support receive it, and receive it in greater measure<br />
than ever before.<br />
we have been able to do this by rejecting the piecemeal<br />
approach of our predecessors and achieving instead, through<br />
consultation and co-operation with groups such as your own,<br />
a comprehensive incomes policy that embraces wages,<br />
taxation, superannuation and social security measures.<br />
Fundamental to that process was the reimposition of the<br />
assets test which of course does not apply to the family<br />
home.<br />
We endured what I could politely describe as a certain<br />
amount of political heat from the decision, and we stuck to<br />
our guns.<br />
These days, as a result, the assistance we do provide to<br />
Australia's senior citizens is focused on those who<br />
genuinely need it and not even the Federal opposition, for<br />
all its other hesitations and inconsistencies, now seeks to<br />
revert to the injustices of the past.<br />
Now, with the reforms of'our last Budget, that other gross<br />
anomaly I referred to the limited coverage of<br />
superannuation is also being remedied.<br />
Super now covers more than half the workforce and will<br />
ultimately cover everyone employed under an award.<br />
The implications of this for the retirees of the future are<br />
enormous. It will mean income security for hundreds of<br />
thousands of Australian retirees who can start to plan now,<br />
with confidence, for their days after they leave the<br />
work force.<br />
The pension will always be there for those who need it but<br />
it will be supplemented by a range of superannuation<br />
options.<br />
2400 </p>
<p>That will dramatically reduce the uncertainties senior<br />
citizens would have otherwise faced if they had to rely<br />
solely on the pension in an era when, as I said at the<br />
outset, the greying of the baby boom will be placing an<br />
enormous drain on the social security system.<br />
Of course our commitment to the age pension and our<br />
determination to protect the current generation of<br />
pensioners was thoroughly demonstrated in the last Budget.<br />
Over the course of the next year, pensioners will receive<br />
between $ 11 and $ 36 a week extra as a result of the various<br />
measures we have taken.<br />
we are bringing forward CPI adjustments; we increased and<br />
indexed the amount of tax-free income pensioners can<br />
receive; we dramatically lifted and indexed rent assistance;<br />
and, with the April 1990 pension increase, we will not only<br />
meet, but exceed, that historic target of lifting the<br />
pension to 25 per cent of average weekly earnings.<br />
And we are implementing a massive three stage reform of tax<br />
and social security that will mean from 1995 that no age or<br />
service pensioner part-rate or full-rate will pay income<br />
tax. in other words we have built a comprehensive retirement<br />
incomes policy based on four key criteria: adequacy,<br />
fairness, security and sustainability.<br />
People who can provide for their. own retirement now have the<br />
appropriate incentives to do so, while those who need the<br />
age pension will receive the protection and security to<br />
which they are fully entitled.<br />
This achievement in the area of retirement policies<br />
illustrates our broader achievement throughout the social<br />
security system. As Brian Howe has said recently, what we<br />
have been about is wherever possible removing the need for<br />
people to rely on the safety net but where they need to<br />
use it, we have ensured it provides real comfort and<br />
assistance. I take the opportunity of pointing out the reciprocal<br />
agreement that we have signed with the Italian Government<br />
that ensures elderly Australians born in Italy receive their<br />
full pension entitlements a small achievement perhaps in<br />
the full sweep of Government policy but a very crucial one<br />
for those who will benefit from it.<br />
The age pension is, of course, only one aspect of aged care<br />
in Australia.<br />
Equally important f or older Australians is personal<br />
independence, their right to make decisions about their<br />
lives, about where they will live, and if and how they will<br />
be cared for. 2401 </p>
<p>older people need the security of knowing that there are<br />
adequate support services where they need them.<br />
The record of my Government in this area is a strong one.<br />
We spend almost $ 2 billion each year on aged care, including<br />
at least $ 1.5 billion for residential care.<br />
we have introduced reforms which have meant that<br />
first, home support services are more available, of a<br />
better quality, and are more accessible;<br />
second, there are new residential care programs for<br />
older people, giving them much more independence.<br />
It is clear that older Australians don't want to be shut<br />
away from the community: we all want to be part of things,<br />
living where we have spent our lives raising families and<br />
working. The Home and Community Care Program aims to reduce the need<br />
for hostel and nursing home care by providing services to<br />
people in their own homes: community nursing, home help and<br />
personal care, home maintenance, meals on wheels, home and<br />
centre based respite care, transport services, and<br />
paramedical services.<br />
There is also help for families and friends who provide care<br />
for the elderly at home.<br />
At the same time, for elderly people who simply cannot<br />
manage at home, we have ensured proper planning and<br />
equitable funding for hostels and nursing homes where people<br />
need them.<br />
For people who are in hostels, we are aware of their need to<br />
maintain their dignity and rights. We are working on a<br />
charter of resident's rights and responsibilities, and a<br />
care contract between residents and service providers.<br />
To sum up then, let me say this:<br />
I know that many of your members still find it hard to<br />
manage on the age pension. But we have increased the<br />
pension as far as is possible, and brought in additional<br />
services to lessen the burden for the most disadvantaged.<br />
By the middle of next year the age pension will reach more<br />
than 25 per cent of AWE the highest level it has reached,<br />
in terms of average weekly earnings, for forty years.<br />
By September next year we will have trebled rent assistance<br />
perhaps the best assistance that can be given to the least<br />
well off group of pensioners.<br />
2402 </p>
<p>For older people who can continue to live in their own<br />
homes, there is a wide range of community services., to<br />
provide them with dignity and independence whatever their<br />
income.<br />
And for people who need hostel and nursing home care, much<br />
has been done to improve standards, maintain their dignity,<br />
and protect their rights as individuals.<br />
For those who will reach retirement age in the coming<br />
decades the policy framework exists to ensure the system<br />
will deliver fair and adequate, as well as secure and<br />
sustainable, income and community support.<br />
My friends<br />
The glib judgement is sometimes made that the gap between<br />
rich and poor in Australia is increasing that the rich are<br />
getting richer and the poor poorer.<br />
~ Circumstantial evidence is certainly provided by the<br />
conspicuous and spectacular way in which senior executives<br />
in private enterprise have awarded themselves pay increases<br />
far beyond any accepted wage fixing guidelines.<br />
only last week you may have seen press reports of a study<br />
into income inequality carried out by the Social Welfare<br />
Research Centre a study in which Australia was compared to<br />
seven other OECD countries in the years 1981-1986.<br />
The press reports overlook the real problems in making such<br />
international " comparisons", not the least of them being<br />
that they don't take into account the most recent<br />
information. In this case the European data was old, the<br />
study relied on money income and did not include the social<br />
wage, and it could not include the very significant changes<br />
which have taken place in Australia since 1986.<br />
Among these changes, I have already mentioned the<br />
achievement of lifting the pension, by next April, above<br />
per cent of average weekly earnings.<br />
That in itself is a measure not just of improved wellbeing<br />
for individual pensioners but of their improved relative<br />
wellbeing in other words, a measure of diminis117gnt<br />
expanding, income gaps in the community.<br />
In the same way, the Government's relentless determination,<br />
in co-operation with the trade union movement, to create<br />
jobs is also ensuring that those who would otherwise be<br />
completely unable to support themselves, are able to climb<br />
up the ladder of self-sufficiency and economic security.<br />
Since we came to office, we have created more than<br />
million new jobs including 828,000 since May 1986. 2403 </p>
<p>At the same time, the number of people on Unemployment<br />
Benefit has fallen from more than half a million in May 1986<br />
to 368,000 a fall of 34 per cent.<br />
The most striking omission from any study of income<br />
inequality that concludes in 1986 is, of course, the<br />
introduction in December 1987 of the Family Allowance<br />
Supplement the cornerstone of our attack on child poverty.<br />
Nearly 180,000 families now receive FAS, compared to less<br />
than 30,000 families on Family Income Supplement in<br />
June 1986.<br />
FAS was increased in July 1989 to meet benchmarks of<br />
adequacy, and will be increased annually.<br />
Family Allowances were also increased substantially in July<br />
1989, and will be indexed annually.<br />
As a result of tax cuts and increased family payments in the<br />
last year, living standards, particularly for low and middle<br />
income families, have been further improved.<br />
For example, a single income family with two children<br />
received an increase in after tax income of $ 23.50<br />
equivalent to a wage increase of $ 40 a week.<br />
So Australians are entitled to ask that glib reports,<br />
implying that nothing is being done to help the least well<br />
off, at least include all that is being done and all that<br />
has been achieved, to lift the burden of hardship in this<br />
community. Those who seek to question this Government's commitment to<br />
real improvements in social justice should consider this<br />
fact: in a time of necessary economic restraint, we have<br />
increased spending on social justice programs, as a<br />
proportion of total Government spending ( excluding public<br />
debt interest) from about 50 per cent in 1982-83 to a<br />
projected 58 per cent in 1989-90 or, in 1988-89 dollars,<br />
an increase of nearly $ 9 billion.<br />
The standard of living for the poorest Australians has been<br />
protected and improved;<br />
Access to essential services has been widened; and<br />
Rights and opportunities for disadvantaged groups have been<br />
strengthened.<br />
That is a record of achievement -real assistance targeted<br />
to those who need it that stands in the starkest contrast<br />
to the empty phrases of the opposition.<br />
Just look at the record on pensions. In the seven years the<br />
Liberals were in office they cut the pension by more than<br />
two per cent in real terms. While we have been in office we<br />
have lifted the age pension by around 8 per cent.<br />
2404 </p>
<p>We have set the basis for an adequate standard of living for<br />
Australia's senior citizens into the 1990s a minimum that<br />
Australians should now expect in their retirement.<br />
We've delivered it if the Opposition has any care and<br />
compassion for Australia's senior citizens, they should<br />
support it.<br />
I close by reaffirming my Government's determination to<br />
continue the work of making Australia a fairer and better<br />
place for us all.<br />
And I look forward to working closely with your organisation<br />
and with all pensioners towards that goal. 2 405 </p>
