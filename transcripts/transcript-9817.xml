    <content><![CDATA[<p>PRIME MINISTER 121/ 95<br />STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />THE THIRD FRENCH NUCLEAR TEST<br />I strongly condemn the latest French nuclear test at Mururoa.<br />This test flies in the face of the French Governments recent announcement that it<br />will sign the Protocols of the South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone ( SPNFZ) Treaty. It<br />further brings into question the sincerity of France's commitment to the security of<br />the region and its environment. The French Government should draw the logical<br />conclusion from its intention to sign the SPNFZ Protocols and end its tests now.<br />Continued testing has triggered powerful reactions around the world that reinforce<br />the view that security based on nuclear weapons is unsustainable in the longer term.<br />The strength of this opposition adds weight to the Government's decision to pursue<br />practical measures that will lead to a world free of nuclear weapons.<br />This view will be reinforced in the coming weeks with the United Nations General<br />Assembly scheduled to consider a resolution, in which Australia is playing a leading<br />role, calling for an immediate end to all nuclear testing. France must acknowledge<br />the force of this resolution and the fact that it represents world opinion. To continue<br />testing would be an affront to the wishes of the international community as well as<br />the South Pacific.<br />France continues to seriously damage its international reputation by its actions in the<br />face of world opinion.<br />France stands almost alone in not recognising that changed strategic circumstances<br />and changing world opinion mean that a system of security based on nuclear<br />weapons is unsustainable in the longer term.<br />Until French Government acts responsibly towards the nations of the South Pacific<br />by ending its nuclear testing program we will pursue our comprehensive campaign of<br />action opposing the French decision.<br />CANBERRA 28 October 1995</p>
