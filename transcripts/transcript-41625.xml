    <content><![CDATA[<p>We warmly congratulate the people of Malaysia on peacefully and respectfully exercising their democratic right to vote on 9 May.  Australia strongly supports the rights of citizens in any country to choose their leaders openly and freely protected by the rule of law.<br />

We congratulate Dr Mahathir bin Mohamad on his appointment as Prime Minister of Malaysia, and the Pakatan Harapan coalition for their historic election victory.<br />
Australia and Malaysia have a rich, broad and deep contemporary relationship, full of potential, and underpinned by shared interests and values. Our economic, defence, security and people-to-people links are strong and growing.<br />
The Australian Government looks forward to continuing to work with Malaysia to further strengthen the partnership and friendship between our two countries and peoples.</p>
