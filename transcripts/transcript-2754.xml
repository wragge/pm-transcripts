The Prime Minister, Mir. Whitlam, has announced the<br />
appointment of Miss Elizabeth Evatt as a Presidential Member<br />

resignation of the Hon. Deputy President, Vernon Watson, to<br />
take up a position as a Judge on the Industrial Commission of<br />
New South Wales.<br />
The decision to replace Mr. Watson with Deputy<br />
President Evatt was made after consultations between Mr. Whitlam<br />
and the nominated Minister for Industrial Affairs, Mr. C. R.<br />
Cameron. Deputy President Evatt has accepted the position and<br />
will take up her appointment at Easter.<br />
