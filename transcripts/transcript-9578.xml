TRANSCRIPT OF THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
INTERVIEW WITH TERRY LONG, ABC RADIO 7ZR, 12 MAY 1995<br />
E&amp; OE PROOF COPY<br />
TL: John Howard has had his reply and this morning Paul Keating, the<br />
Prime Minister, is in the studio at The Lodge to talk to us about the<br />
way he sees it, good morning.<br />
PM: Good morning, Terry, how are you going?<br />
TL: Good thanks. John Howard's performance last night eight out of ten<br />
too generous?<br />
PM: Oh absolutely, I mean, he did the whole speech off-the-cuff. I mean,<br />
he had a great opportunity last night, within a year of an election, to lay<br />
down what the Opposition's policies would be. He never mentioned<br />
one policy thing on their part, he never even responded to a prepared<br />
text. What he did was essentially give the Parliament the sort of<br />
debate he'd have on, you know, any Tuesday or Wednesday or<br />
Thursday afternoon on a Matter of Public Importance, a sort of raving<br />
speech which was mostly about me and the Government and it left, our<br />
members left you can always tell on the sort of balance that goes on<br />
in the House of Representatives our Members left very buoyed<br />
because they thought his performance was so poor, and his Members<br />
left very glum. That's always the test.<br />
TL: Do you see it as the start of the election campaign if he should have<br />
been laying down policies?<br />
PM: Well, he's been in the job now since the beginning of the year. We've<br />
got no idea, any of us, what his policies will be on economic policy,<br />
on social policy, industry policy, foreign policy we've absolutely no<br />
idea. All he ever does is attack the Government and try to blackguard<br />
the fact that we're seeing five minutes of economic sunshine which is,<br />
of course, a completely untrue statement and this week's Budget and<br />
yesterday's unemployment figures 90,000 job growth in the month,<br />
640,000 jobs since the election give the lie to that statement and </p>
<p>there's the Treasury forecasting another three years of growth, low<br />
inflationary growth. So, that's about all he's been up to and last night<br />
was his chance to put some markers down and he didn't do it.<br />
TL: You didn't see him in any way as taking the fight up to you last night?<br />
PM: Not at all. I mean, I don't think the fight.... . the public of this country<br />
continue to want, fortunately, continue to want policy changes of the<br />
kind, of the great superannuation change the Government had in the<br />
Budget on Tuesday night, or the shift in the Budget balance or the<br />
Hilmer changes the competition changes of a month earlier, or, you<br />
know, the other big block things like APEC, Working Nation they're<br />
the sort of things that people respond to. They don't respond to abuse<br />
and rhetoric and these sorts of things. That's all cheap and easy but it<br />
doesn't take you far.<br />
TL What about that Mars Bar quote? Is that damaging to you? ( inaudible)<br />
PM: No, no, it was a joke, it was a joke of ten years ago. That's the sort of<br />
stock and trade they go on about. I mean, what I'm about is<br />
employment. I mean, what I did in the last election was commit myself<br />
solemnly to get growth going again and to focus on employment. I<br />
said that we would not leave the unemployed behind, that we would<br />
put an arm out and bring them up, and we've had, I think, now the<br />
fastest employment growth in the OECD area, amongst the 27 nation<br />
states of the OECD, Australia's employment growth has been the<br />
fastest and we've had in the last year the biggest fall in unemployment<br />
that we've ever recorded.<br />
TL But did you actually say that to Donald Homne?<br />
PM: No, not to Donald, I never said I was cracking, we were cracking<br />
jokes with Barry Cohen in 1984 and Barry came down and we were<br />
sitting down as guests of the ABC, I think, or the Australia Council and<br />
he had a Mars Bar in his hand.<br />
TL: So you've been taken out of context?<br />
PM: Oh well, you always are in this business, I mean, but they can't take<br />
the jobs out of context or the fall in unemployment.<br />
TL: ( inaudible) as being removed from the people if that is seen as having<br />
political advantage, in that respect, it was fairly smart, wasn't it?<br />
PM: Well, I don't think, but who cares about it? I mean, it's just that another<br />
bit of throw-away nonsense in the throw-away debate of Australia. I<br />
mean, what they can't throw away is the drop in unemployment in<br />
Tasmania yesterday, the drop in unemployment around Australia. You<br />
see, that's what Howard is battling he's battling against substance </p>
<p>and he can run around there blackguarding Australia and saying that<br />
the place has basically had it and that we're not doing that well and<br />
we've had five minutes of sunshine if people believe that gullible<br />
nonsense, all it does is do damage to the country where the<br />
Government has been focussing on getting things going.<br />
TL Was that unemployment number a better number for you than the<br />
Budget itself?<br />
PM: Oh no. No, no, the Budget was a great document. I mean, it put us<br />
into surplus three years earlier than we would have otherwise been.<br />
It's taken enormous pressure off interest rates because notice<br />
yesterday, the Treasurer gave the figures yesterday, last year we sold<br />
$ 21 billion worth of Commonwealth bonds that's $ 21,000 million and<br />
this year we'll sell $ 5.6 billion. So there's about, you know, $ 14-15<br />
billion less pressure, less bonds that have to be sold in the Australian<br />
market, so if there are fewer bonds, the price of the bonds, the value of<br />
the bonds rises and if the value of the bonds rises the yield, or interest<br />
rate, drops. And that's why we saw a 1 percentage point drop in the<br />
long term bond rate over the last 10 days and confirmed again on<br />
Tuesday and Wednesday. So, it's that great change in the Budget<br />
balance, the largest swing ever from deficit into surplus, from a deficit<br />
of $ 12 billion to a surplus of $ 700 million. That change and the<br />
change in national superannuation are the sort of things that, you<br />
know, one lives for in public life. I mean, the superannuation change,<br />
we started on this in 1986. The ACTU and the Government put<br />
together an Accord in 1986 for 3 per cent super. Then we sort of<br />
inched it up to 5 per cent and then in 1991 we brought in the<br />
Superannuation Guarantee Charge and that's taking it now to 6 and up<br />
to 9 per cent from employer-based contributions by the year 2000.<br />
What we were able to do on Tuesday night was, I thought, a very<br />
innovative proposal, was to say to people, " you put 3 per cent away<br />
yourself, and we'll match it, the Government will match it". So, in other<br />
words, on that 9 per cent there will be a further 6 per cent. So, every<br />
Australian working person will have 15 per cent put away for their<br />
retirement and that would mean, I gave the example on Budget night,<br />
that will mean that someone on $ 33,000 today, if the scheme was fully<br />
in place and they were retiring today, would retire on $ 30,000 a year.<br />
And they would have a lump sum of just under half a million dollars.<br />
TL Are you happy though that you've delivered your tax cuts in that<br />
fashion rather than straight out, saying, here you are guys and girls,<br />
take the money and walk away with it?<br />
PM: Well, we did. There were two remember? There were two from One<br />
Nation. The first half we paid in full at the end of 1993. This second<br />
half we said we would put them off, probably until 1998. Well, in fact it<br />
is going to be 1998. But I think though that most people would believe<br />
that they are better off being able to leverage up the value of that tax </p>
<p>cut in a superannuation scheme that really provides for them in<br />
retirement. Even if we take, let's say we take a couple in their 30s<br />
years of age when they retire as a result of Tuesday night's changes,<br />
when they retire, they'll retire on an amount three-quarters larger again<br />
than the pension. And when their children retire, they'll retire on an<br />
amount twice as large as the pension. So, I think if you say to people<br />
well, would you rather that or you would rather, sort of, $ 10 or $ 15 in<br />
your hand? I think they're going to say, well, in the long run, not to<br />
have the burden of worrying about one's retirement income and at the<br />
same time producing a huge pool of national savings for the current<br />
account, is a better way to go.<br />
TL: And what about the banks then, the banks now, as you are aware, are<br />
saying that they can't absorb the additional charges that you put on<br />
them through company tax and the like in the Budget, and they won't<br />
give a guarantee that interest rates won't rise. How do you see that?<br />
PM: Well, they would say that, wouldn't they?<br />
TL: Do you expect interest rates to go up?<br />
PM: No, no, they've got profits coming out of their ears, I mean, they've<br />
never had such a beano, the banks, and really, what we're saying to<br />
them, look, we give you a privileged position in the market by giving<br />
you a banking license, what about paying us for the license, giving us<br />
some money back, and taking it off the Budget rather than us find that<br />
out of some other area of taxation. When you hear bank M~ s and<br />
others saying, " oh this will affect interest rates", you can just dismiss<br />
that with all the cynicism in the world.<br />
TL: And what about the Commonwealth Bank? Does the sale of that, in a<br />
way, signal the completion of a change in the Labor socialistic<br />
principles? Are they on the block as well?<br />
PM: Oh no, look, all the Labor empathy with the Commonwealth Bank came<br />
when the Commonwealth Bank was, in a sense, the Reserve Bank of<br />
Australia. You see, when King O'Malley and all these people in the<br />
early part of the century introduced the Commonwealth Bank, it was,<br />
you know, but not long before that you would have had the bank notes,<br />
you know, printed by the Bank of New South Wales and other banks,<br />
we then went to national currency but we needed a central bank or a<br />
reserve bank and the Commonwealth Bank was that. That all changed<br />
with the Reserve Bank Act of 1959. The Commonwealth Bank then<br />
became just another bank, a Govern ment-owned bank, but just<br />
another bank. Now, you might remember when the State Bank of<br />
Victoria and Tricontinental had difficulties a few years ago, I was party<br />
to the Commonwealth Bank buying the State Bank of Victoria. As a<br />
consequence, we made the Commonwealth Bank into a real institution </p>
<p>because formerly it had really only been the old State Savings Bank of<br />
New South Wales, it had picked up in the Depression. Once it got...<br />
TL: But nonetheless, taken together with the Hilmer changes which<br />
introduced competition and so forth into government activities, and<br />
which also mean that some State Governments are divesting activities,<br />
the Labor Party at a national level had embraced those taken<br />
together with that, doesn't that signal a change to the electorate in the<br />
way that the Labor Party actually operates now, in fact, the nature of<br />
the Labor Party?<br />
PM: Oh the Labor Party has completely changed, but that change<br />
happened in 1983. That change happened 12 years ago. That<br />
happened when we removed exchange controls and floated the<br />
Australian dollar. I mean, that happened when we started pulling the<br />
tariff wall down in the middle 1980s. I mean, that's competition through<br />
imports, which has now picked up our manufacturing sector and now<br />
where we have seen exports to GDP rise by 50 per cent in the last<br />
eight or nine years that's come essentially through the notion of a<br />
competitive economy. It's a great irony that it's taken a Labor<br />
Government to give Australia, for the first time ever, an open,<br />
competitive economy, a free-market economy. And all that Hilmer is<br />
doing is building those changes further into the State sector. See the<br />
Trade Practices Act always applied to Federal instrumentalities but<br />
they never applied to State Electricity Commissions or water boards or<br />
maritime services organisations, and what we did was extend those<br />
competition and access principles to the States under Hilmer. Now,<br />
that's a very great change, but a change in the groove of a change in<br />
the Labor Party from 1983. 1 mean, I think, this is one of the great<br />
changes of Australian politics in the last decade because the Labor<br />
Party will never regress to the views it had before 1983. In other<br />
words, one of the reforms that the country has picked up from this<br />
great period of change, is a change, a very change to one of its major<br />
Parties and that's why, and where would we be with the Liberal Party<br />
in its state without ideas, without personnel, without a view, without a<br />
structure where would Australia be if the Labor Party had not gone<br />
through this metamorphosis over the last decade?<br />
TL: And finally, why are you not coming to Tasmania to sell the Budget? I<br />
think the Premier down here thinks you might be hiding in Canberra.<br />
PM: I'll be in Hobart in early June on a post-Budget visit so I'll be there<br />
soon, and I'm in Perth on the weekend and Brisbane next week, so I<br />
get around the country as much as I can and I do listen to what people<br />
have to say. I think that there's such a sort of screen of criticism these<br />
days coming, a sort of, a torrent, the whole culture of criticism that's<br />
been developed in this country now is I don't think serving us well and<br />
the public are listening through the veil or trying to peer behind the<br />
screen to pick up some value to listen, to actually listen and hear some </p>
<p>6<br />
important information so they can make their own mind up and what I<br />
do when I go around Australia, I take the opportunity when I meet<br />
people just to listen to various things they say and you'd be surprised<br />
just in a week the sort of things you can pick up. So I keep touch that<br />
way and I'm very pleased to be able to have those opportunities.<br />
TL: The Prime Minister, Paul Keating, thanks for talking to us this morning.<br />
PM: Thank you very much indeed, Terry.<br />
Ends </p>
