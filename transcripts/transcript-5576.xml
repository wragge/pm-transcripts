PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIAWEDNESDAY, APRIL 29 1981<br />
BLF DE-REGISTRATION<br />
APPEAL FOR SUPPORT FROM THE STATES<br />
The Commonwealth Government has approached the States and<br />
the Northern Territory requesting support f or Commonwealth<br />
initiatives to make de-registration of the BLF effective.<br />
I have written today to all State Premiers and the Chief<br />
Minister for the Northern Territory.<br />
The Commonwealth has decided on a range of measures which<br />
could be taken to act against those firms which choose to<br />
continue to co-operate with a de-registered organisation.<br />
The Commonwealth is now asking the States to take part in<br />
the post de-regulation stage.<br />
Commonwealth Departments and authorities will no longer<br />
enter into leasing arrangements with these companies.<br />
State Premiers are being asked to take a similar approach.<br />
There are a number of areas where State and local governments<br />
and their authorities can take action. Rentals, issue of<br />
permits and investment of governmental funds in the building<br />
and construction industry are appropriate areas for examination.<br />
By taking determined action, complementing the Commonwealth<br />
initiatives, the States can ensure that common objectives<br />
are achieved.<br />
