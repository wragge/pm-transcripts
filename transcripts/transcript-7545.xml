PRIME MINISTER<br />
TRANSCRIPT OF NEWS CONFERENCE, PRIME TELEVISION STATION, 29<br />
MARCH 1989<br />
E 0 E PROOF ONLY<br />
JOURNALIST: How much of a loss to the Ministry is Gary<br />
Punch's resignation?<br />
PM: Well it's a loss. How do you quantify it? I can't<br />
quantify it. It's a loss. The Government is in the<br />
fortunate position of course of having a very considerable<br />
reservoir of talent on the backbench and I'm confident that<br />
from that reservoir of talent they will elect a very<br />
competent replacement.<br />
JOURNALIST: Were you surprised by his decision?<br />
PM: A little but I could understand it. He could take the<br />
view that he's in a better position in his constituency to<br />
advance his beliefs on the particular issue of the third<br />
runway at Mascot from the backbench. I can understand that.<br />
JOURNALIST: Are you worried that may be an embarrassment to<br />
the Cabinet now, the fact that he'll be fighting that<br />
decision? PM: No. Do I look worried?<br />
JOURNALIST: Is the meeting of Labor MPs in Sydney today to<br />
discuss the airport matter helpful?<br />
0 PM: I don't know whether it's helpful or not. I mean again<br />
I'm totally relaxed about it. Let me get these things in<br />
perspective not just this issue but you look back over<br />
politics. I mean we-have great big gatherings about this,<br />
like this, about an issue, you get your collective knickers<br />
in collective knots and think that the end of the world is<br />
about to descend upon us. In a few months time, what was<br />
that all about. I mean get things in perspective.<br />
JOURNALIST: Are you quite happy for him to be replaced by a<br />
New South Wales right winger?<br />
PM: I'll be happy with the decision of the Caucus because<br />
as I say we have so much talent there that I'm sure a very<br />
capable replacement will emerge.<br />
JOURNALIST: Are you confident that the best replacement<br />
will be made because of a factional deal? </p>
<p>-2-<br />
PM: Well I've talked about this before, the factional<br />
position. There are some minuses about the way the<br />
factional system operates, but there are very many pluses.<br />
I've said quite clearly on balance I think that the pluses<br />
outway the minuses. I mean if you want to look at the two<br />
major forces in Australian politics the Labor Party, the<br />
one Labor Party and the hotch-potch of interest groups<br />
that make up the National Party and the Liberal Party<br />
there's just no doubt which is the more efficient in<br />
producing talent. I mean it's just not a proud Labor Prime<br />
Minister talking about the talent we've got, it's the<br />
unanimous position of all commentators that there is very,<br />
very little talent on the other side because they haven't<br />
gone about the business of preselection in a sensible way.<br />
They've allowed safe seats to go to nonentities. They have<br />
no talent there at all really and that's you know a common<br />
view. Now in New South Wales they are going along the<br />
factional route in a sense further than we have. In the<br />
Liberal Party they've got to the stage they've actually<br />
registered one of their what is it centre right or centre<br />
unity or something, I'm not quite sure but they've<br />
actually taken steps to register it with the Corporate<br />
Affairs Commission. Well it's a funny sort of way of going<br />
about things. In the Labor Party different groups with<br />
different emphases of now over a period of time tend to<br />
coalesce. But if you look at the way they're operating in<br />
the Parliament they've never been more cohesive than they<br />
are now. They have their differences and that's fair enough<br />
it will always happen in social democratic parties but<br />
they come together on the important issues and I think on<br />
balance it's worked very, very well. It's been reflected in<br />
the decisions that have been taken by the Australian people.<br />
If you look at all the federal and state elections over the<br />
last few years by and large the Australian electorate is<br />
rejecting the conservatives because the thing is they have<br />
their divisions, they are enormously divided within the<br />
Liberal, within the National Party, between the Liberal<br />
Party and the National Party. Their divisions are deep,<br />
profound in terms of stopping them producing policies. We<br />
have some differences but they don't operate to prevent the<br />
sensible and relevant formulations of policy. That's the<br />
difference. JOURNALIST: Prime Minister what's your response to the<br />
America's Cup ruling?<br />
PM: I have to confess I haven't heard the America's Cup<br />
ruling. Please tell me.<br />
JOURNALIST: Well the Americans have been found to be<br />
cheating<br />
PM: When? In Fremantle?<br />
JOURNALIST: In New Zealand. The Cup has been returned to<br />
its rightful owners </p>
<p>-3-<br />
PM: What's this New Zealand background that's coming out<br />
here? JOURNALIST: inaudible<br />
PM: It has has it?<br />
JOURNALIST: Yes it has.<br />
PM: Were they cheating before in Fremantle?<br />
JOURNALIST: No, no.<br />
PM: I mean we probably should bring it back to Fremantle<br />
and then the New Zealanders could challenge us.<br />
JOURNALIST: Make it retrospective?<br />
PM: At least to Fremantle, at least to Fremantle.<br />
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister are you happy that everything's<br />
being done by the Federal Government that could be to<br />
safeguard taxpayers money in relation to the NSC and other-<br />
PM: Thanks for that question. I've of course asked for a<br />
report on this issue, it was furnished to me yesterday, and<br />
I believe that the Commonwealth is in a position where it is<br />
clear of any possibility of charge that we haven't acted<br />
appropriately. There have been so many fanciful claims<br />
made, including that this missing person is a CIA agent and<br />
has got intelligence connections. I've had all these things<br />
checked out and I'm assured that there is no substance in<br />
those things.<br />
JOURNALIST: There's no substance to those at all?..<br />
PM: As I'm informed.<br />
JOURNALIST: Well how concerned are you that something like<br />
this can happen even if the Government<br />
PM: well this is not a Commonwealth responsibility, this<br />
matter, and it's quite clearly not a Commonwealth<br />
responsibility. If there is anything to be pursued it's at<br />
a state level, not at the Commonwealth level.<br />
JOURNALIST: The Chairman of the National Crime Authority<br />
Committee wants the NCA to look at it. Do you think that's<br />
perhaps an over-reaction given what you've just said?<br />
PM: on the evidence available to me..<br />
ends </p>
