FOR PRESS: PM No 18/ 1972<br />
FIRST ADVAN4CE ON WHEAT<br />
Statement by the Prime Minister, Mr William McMahon, M. P.<br />
The Government is prepared to arrange the provision of<br />
finance under the usual government guarantee to the Reserve Bank<br />
to enable the Australian Wheat Board to pay a first advance at the<br />
rate of $ 1.10 per bushel less freight on deliveries of wheat to the<br />
Board up to 407 million bushels in the 1972/ 73 season.<br />
This is the level of csuota deliveries recommended by the<br />
Australian Wheat Growers' Federation and it has been accepted by<br />
the Government on the understanding that if sales are below the<br />
estimates adopted by the Federation and deliveries will be up to<br />
or in excess of the quota, the Federation will accept responsibil-<br />
* ity for a reduction in the 1973-1974 delivery . quotas.<br />
The -Government's decision clears the way for the<br />
Australian Agricultural Council, of which the Minister for Primary_<br />
* Industry, Mr Sinclair, is a member, to take decisions in Perth<br />
next week on the quotas for next season.<br />
The Government has reached this position after taking<br />
into account the present wheat stocks situation, which is<br />
substantially lower than has been the case over the past two years<br />
and the prospective export outlets for wheat in the present season.<br />
The decision recognises the desirability of the industry<br />
being in a position to provide continuity of supply to its markets.<br />
Further details are available from the Minister for<br />
Primary Industry.<br />
