EMBARGO: 3,00 P. M.<br />
SATURDAY 3,8,74<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER,<br />
THE HON. EG. WHITLAM, M. P,,<br />
AT THE OPENING OF THE NEW LITHGOW CITY COUNCIL ADMINISTRATION BLOCK,<br />
LITHGOW,<br />
SATURDAY 3 AUGUST 1974<br />
AUGUST 1974 WILL PROVE AN IMPORTANT<br />
MONTH FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT IN LITHGOW AND<br />
THROUGHOUT THE NATION, FOR LITHGOW, IT WILL<br />
MEAN THE ACQUISITION OF MODERN OFFICES FROM<br />
WHICH THE COUNCIL CAN ADMINISTER THE AFFAIRS OF<br />
THE CITY. THIS HAS RESULTED ENTIRELY FROM<br />
THE EFFORTS OF THE COUNCIL WHICH RAISED THE<br />
$ 440,000 NECESSARY FOR THE COMPLETION OF WHAT<br />
IT ENVISAGES AS THE FIRST OF THREE PARTS OF<br />
A CIVIC CENTRE FOR LITHGOW, </p>
<p>-2-<br />
THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS MONTH FOR MUNICIPAL<br />
AND SHIRE COUNCILS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY IS THAT IT<br />
WILL SEE BROUGHT TO FRUITION ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT<br />
ADVANCES IN THE HISTORY OF AUSTRALIAN LOCAL GOVERNMENTS<br />
IN THE NEXT WEEK OR SO THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT WILL<br />
RECEIVE THE FIRST REPORT OF THE GRANTS COMMISSION ON<br />
APPLICATIONS BY LOCAL GOVERNMENT AUTHORITIES FOR<br />
FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE FROM THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT.<br />
LATER IN THE MONTH THE CABINET WILL HAVE THIS REPORT<br />
BY AN INDEPENDENT AND NON-POLITICAL BODY TO GUIDE IT<br />
AS IT DRAFTS THE BUDGET, WHEN THE BUDGET ITSELF IS<br />
BROUGHT DOWN NEXT MONTH IT WILL CONTAIN FOR THE FIRST<br />
TIME GRANTS TO LOCAL GOVERNMENT DESIGNED TO OVERCOME<br />
INEQUALITIES BETWEEN DIFFERENT REGIONS IN AUSTRALIA.<br />
THIS PROCESS REPRESENTS A MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH<br />
FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT. IT RESULTS FROM LEGISLATION<br />
INTRODUCED BY THE GOVERNMENT LAST YEAR TO EXPAND THE<br />
FUNCTIONS OF THE GRANTS COMMISSION. THE COMMISSION<br />
WAS ESTABLISHED IN 1933 TO PROVIDE RECOMMENDATIONS FOR<br />
SPECIAL GRANTS TO BE PAID TO CLAIMANT STATES UNDER<br />
SECTION 96 OF THE CONSTITUTION, AT VARIOUS TIMES IN<br />
THE PAST 41 YEARS THESE STATES HAVE INCLUDED QUEENSLAND,<br />
SOUTH AUSTRALIA, WESTERN AUSTRALIA AND TASMANIA.<br />
THE BASIS OF MAKING SUCH GRANTS HAS BEEN THE RECOGNITION<br />
THAT AT VARIOUS TIMES SOME STATES HAVE BEEN LESS ADVANTAGED<br />
THAN OTHERS, BOTH IN TERMS OF FINANCE AND SERVICES,<br />
THE COMMISSION HAS SERVED THE PURPOSE OF HELPING TO<br />
REDUCE SUCH INEQUALITIES BETWEEN STATES, / 3 </p>
<p>3<br />
WITH THE PASSAGE OF THE NEW GRANTS COMMISSION<br />
ACT LAST YEAR, THE GOVERNMENT HAS NOW EMPOWERED THE<br />
COMMISSION TO EXAMINE NOT JUST THE INEQUALITIES BETWEEN<br />
THE STATES BUT ALSO THE INEQUALITIES THAT EXIST BETWEEN<br />
REGIONS IN THE ONE STATE, THIS RECOGNISES THAT, WHILE<br />
A PARTICULAR STATE OVERALL MAY BE IN A HEALTHY FINANCIAL<br />
POSITION, THERE MAY BE AREAS WITHIN IT THAT LACK ADEQUATE<br />
SERVICES AND FACILITIES, THE LOCAL COUNCILS IN SUCH<br />
A REGION MAY LACK THE FINANCIAL RESOURCES TO OVERCOME<br />
THOSE DEFICIENCIES AND EVEN THE STATE GOVERNMENT MAY<br />
NOT BE ABLE TO PROVIDE ADEQUATE HELP, IN FACT IT IS<br />
QUITE OBVIOUS THAT IF THE DISABILITIES OF SOME AREAS<br />
OF AUSTRALIA ARE TO BE OVERCOME THE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT<br />
MUST PROVIDE SPECIAL GRANTS, THAT WAS THE PRINCIPLE<br />
GUIDING THE GRANTS COMMISSION WHEN. IT BEGAN HEARING<br />
APPLICATIONS FOR SUPPORT FROM REGIONAL GROUPINGS OF<br />
COUNCILS THROUGHOUT AUSTRALIA EARLY THIS YEAR,<br />
SUCH ASSISTANCE IS LONG OVERDUE IN AUSTRALIA,<br />
Too MUCH OF TIHE PROVISION OF ESSENTIAL SERVICES IN<br />
THIS COUNTRY HAS BEEN LEFT TO LOCAL GOVERNMENT,<br />
NEITHER THE AUSTRALIAN NOR STATE GOVERNMENTS IN THE<br />
PAST HAVE BEEN PREPARED TO HELP LOCAL GOVERNMENT TO<br />
PROVIDE THOSE SERVICES, I. OCA I_ GOVIRNMENT HAS INDEED<br />
BEEN NEGLECTED AND DOWNGRADED SINCE THE VERY BEGINNINGS<br />
OF OUR FEDERATION, s, ,/ 4 </p>
<p>-4-<br />
THE FRAMERS OF OUR CONSTITUTION DID NOT EVEN<br />
BOTHER TO MENTION LOCAL GOVERNMENT AT ALLI As LATE<br />
AS 1927, WHEN THE FINANCIAL AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE<br />
COMMONWEALTH AND THE STATES WAS DRAWN UP, LOCAL<br />
GOVERNMENT WAS STILL IGNORED, IT WAS NOT UNTIL<br />
1936 THAT THE LOAN COUNCIL BEGAN DEALING WITH THE<br />
BORROWINGS OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT AUTHORITIES. YET<br />
IN ALL THAT TIME THE SCALE OF OPERATIONS OF LOCAL<br />
AND SEMI-GOVERNMENT AUTHORITIES HAS GROWN MARKEDLY,<br />
THE GROWTH HAS BEEN PARTICULARLY GREAT SINCE THE<br />
WAR, THIS IS IMMEDIATELY OBVIOUS IF WE LOOK AT<br />
THE FIGURES OF COMPARATIVE DEBTS, THE INDEBTEDNESS<br />
OF THE COMMONWEALTH HAS NOT GROWN SINCE THE WAR,<br />
BUT THE DEBTS OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND SEMI-GOVERNMENT<br />
AUTHORITIES HAVE MULTIPLIED MORE THAN 12 TIMES.<br />
LOCAL GOVERNMENT AUTHORITIES ARE NOW BORROWING<br />
MORE EACH YEAR THAN THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF THEIR<br />
OUTSTANDING DEBT ONLY 20 YEARS OR SO AGO,<br />
THE COSTS OF SERVICING THEIR BORROWINGS<br />
BEAR HEAVILY ON THE BUDGETS OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT<br />
AUTHORITIES, OVERALL INTEREST PAYMENTS BY THE<br />
AUTHORITIES WOULD NOW BE EQUIVALENT TO ABOUT 12%<br />
OF THEIR REVENUES, INTEREST PAYMENTS PLUS CAPITAL<br />
REPAYMENTS AMOUNTED TO $ 177,5 MILLION IN 1970/ 71,<br />
EQUIVALENT TO ABOUT 25% OF THEIR REVENUES, </p>
<p>IF WE NEED FURTHER EVIDENCE OF THE FINANCIAL PLIGHT<br />
OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT WE NEED ONLY LOOK AT THE RECENT<br />
REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE OF INQUIRY INTO LOCAL<br />
GOVERNMENT AREAS AND ADMINISTRATION IN NEW SOUTH<br />
WALES, KNOWN AS THE BARNETT REPORT. THE COMMITTEE<br />
POINTED OUT THAT LOCAL GOVERNMENT'IS SHARE OF TOTAL<br />
GOVERNMENT EXPENDITURES HAS BEEN SHRINKING STEADILY<br />
IN AUSTRALIA, IN 1969/ 70 IT REPRESENTED 7.14% OF<br />
TOTAL GOVERNMENT EXPENDITURE IN AUSTRALIA, COMPARED<br />
WITH 21.6% IN CANADA, 25.4% IN THE UNITED STATES<br />
AND 34.6% IN GREAT BRITAIN ( WHERE, IT MUST BE<br />
ADMITTED, THERE ARE NO STATE GOVERNMENTS).<br />
YET, WHILE THE FINANCIAL PLIGHT OF LOCAL<br />
GOVERNMENT HAS WORSENED, WE LOOK TO IT INCREASINGLY<br />
TO MEET SO MANY OF OUR COMMUNITY NEEDS. INDEED THERE<br />
HAS BEEN A QUITE NATURAL AND PREDICTABLE ACCELERATION<br />
IN THE DEMANDS MADE BY THE COMMUNITY' ON LOCAL<br />
GOVERNMENT, WE LOOK TO LOCAL GOVERNMENT TO PROVIDE<br />
ROADS, SEWERAGE, RECREATION FACILITIES), HEAL. TH SERVICES<br />
AND PLANNING. IN MOR'E RECENT YEARS WE HAVE EXPECTED<br />
IT TO EXPAND INTO SUCH AREAS) AS HEALTH SERVICES AND<br />
CHILD CARE CENTRES, THE BARNETT REPORT POINTED OUT<br />
THAT, IN THE VIEW OF MOST SHIRE COUNCILS IN NEW SOUTH<br />
WALES, " THEIR AREAS COULD NOT SURVIVE WITHOUT A<br />
CONTINUANCE OF LARGE CENTRAL GOVERNMENT GRANTS AND,<br />
WITHOUT EXCEPTION, COUNCILS B3ELIEVED THE AUSTRAL-IAN<br />
GOVERNMENT'S INVOLVEMENT IN FINANCING LOCAL GOVERNMENT<br />
WAS ESSENTIAL, I is 96 </p>
<p>THE PRESENT AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENI SHARES lHAF BELIEF<br />
ANrD HAS TRIED TO PUT IT INTO PRACTICE IN IHE LAST<br />
MONTHS. OUR EXPANSION OF THE FUNCTIONS OF 1HL<br />
GRANTS COMMISSION IS A MAJOR EXAMPLE OF THIS. WE<br />
HAVE ALSO UPCRADED THE LEVEL. OF AUSTrRALIAN ( GOVLRNMENT<br />
ASSISTANCE TO LOCAL GOVERNMENT IN SUCH AREAS AS<br />
ABORIGINAL ADVANCEMENT, AGED PERSONS HOUSING,<br />
SOCIAL. SERVICES, SEWERAGE AND RECREATION,<br />
UNFORTUNATELY WE HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO ACHIEVE<br />
ALL THAT WE WANTED, LAST YEAR I TWICE ASKED THE<br />
STAT(" PREMIERS TO GIVE LOCAL GOVERNMENT A VOICE AND<br />
A VOTE ON THE LOAN COUNCIL. I FIRST MADE THE REQUEST<br />
AT THE CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION IN SYDNEY IN SEPTEMBER.<br />
I TOLD THE CONVENTION:<br />
" I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT THE OVEtRRIDING<br />
CONSIDERATION IN MANY MINDS HERE RELATES TO THE<br />
FINANCIAL. RELATIONS BETWEEN TirE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT<br />
AND THE STATES. SOME OF YOU MAY PREFER TO BELILVE THAT<br />
THE OVERRIDING CONSIDERATION IN MY MIND IS TO CONTINUE<br />
AND EVEN COMPOUND THE PRESENT SITUATION BY WHICH THE<br />
NATIONAL GOVERNMENT DOMINATES THE FINANCIAL RELATIONS<br />
BETWEEN IT AND THE STATES. THAT'S NOT TRUE. MY<br />
OVERRIDING CONSIDERATION AND CONCERN IN THIS CONTEXT IS<br />
TO BALANCE THE FUNCTIONS AND FINANCES OF THE AUSTRALIAN<br />
GOVERNMENT, STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO ENSURE<br />
ADEQUATE SERVICES AND DEVELOPMENTS OF RESOURCES. / 7<br />
6 </p>
<p>I WISH EACH LEVEL OF GOVERNMENT TO BE IN A POSITION TO<br />
PERFORM BETTER ITS ASSIGNED FUNCTIONS, FOR THE BETTER WELFARE<br />
OF ALL OUR CITIZENS, WHEREVER THEY LIVE,"<br />
THE PREMIERS REJECTED MY PROPOSAL. IT WAS FOR THIS REASON<br />
THAT THE GOVERNMENT TOOK THE QUESTION TO REFERENDUM IN MAY THIS<br />
YEAR. WE SOUGHT THE APPROVAL OF THE AUSTRALIAN PEOPLE FOR AN<br />
AMENDMENT TO THE CONSTITUTION TO ALLOW THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT<br />
TO MAKE GRANTS DIRECT TO LOCAL COUNCILS AND TO BORROW MONEY ON<br />
THEIR BEHALF. NO GOVERNMENT HAS EVER FOUND IT EASY TO WIN A<br />
REFERENDUM; NEVERTHELESS THIS REFERENDUM WAS CARRIED IN NEW<br />
SOUTH WALES AND ALMOST CARRIED IN VICTORIA AND WAS SUPPORTED<br />
BY 46,8 PER CENT OF THE ELECTORS IN ALL STATES.<br />
THIS DEFEAT WILL MAKE IT HARDER FOR US TO PURSUE OUR<br />
OBJECTIVES OF UPGRADING LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND IMPROVING ITS<br />
FINANCIAL POSITION. WE WILL HAVE TO CONTINUE TO LIVE WITH<br />
THE CUMBERSOME MACHINERY OF OLD. NEVERTHELESS OUR COMMITMENT<br />
TO LOCAL GOVERNMENT REMAINS. WE WANT TO SEE IT TAKE ITS<br />
PROPER PLACE IN OUR THREE-TIERED SYSTEM OF GOVERNMENT,<br />
WE WANT TO SEE THAT IT HAS THE FINANCIAL ABILITY TO MEET AS<br />
MANY OF THE DEMANDS THAT ARE MADE UPON IT AS POSSIBLE. </p>
