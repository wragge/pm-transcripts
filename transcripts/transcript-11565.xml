    <content><![CDATA[<p>I spoke to the democratically elected Prime Minister of Fiji, Mr Mahendra Chaudhry today.</p>
<p>I told him that the Australian Government and people were relieved that he and his fellow hostages had been released.</p>
<p>He informed me that he was in good health although he had lost some weight.</p>
<p>In our conversation I told Mr Chaudhry that the Australian Government remained appalled that he had been removed from office by a criminal act.</p>
<p>I also told him that it was the Government's disposition to implement a range of measures against Fiji in the light of the unconstitutional events in that country.  I sought his views on this and other issues.</p>
<p>Mr Chaudhry responded that he was consulting his colleagues and would communicate their views in detail to me within the next few days.</p>
<p>The Australian Government, naturally, will take its own decisions on Fiji.  However input from Mr Chaudhry and his colleagues would be both appropriate and useful.</p>
<p>I have discussed the matter with the Minister for Foreign Affairs and we agreed that the Fijian issue would be considered by Cabinet when it meets next Tuesday.</p>
<p>Cabinet will then have before it whatever views Mr Chaudhry has to offer.</p>
<p>14 July 2000</p>
