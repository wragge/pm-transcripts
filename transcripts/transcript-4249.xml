AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL GALLERY: DONATION BY THE<br />
SIR WILLIAM DOBELL ART FOUNDATION<br />
Trustees of the Sir William Dobell Art Foundation have<br />
donated the entire $ 250,000 collection of Dobell sketchbooks<br />
to the Australian National Gallery at Canberra.<br />
The 24 sketchbooks cover the late Sir William Dobell's<br />
artistic career from his student days through an early<br />
period in London and his New Guinea period to the<br />
year before his death, 1970. Many of his drawings will<br />
be published by the Australian National Gallery, which<br />
will also produce a facsimile of at least one sketchbook.<br />
The Government was deeply grateful to the Dobell Art<br />
Foundation trustees for ensuring that preliminary sketches<br />
by a world famous Australian artist would be permanently<br />
available to the Australian people.<br />
The sketches would also form a valuable research medium for<br />
students and artists studying Dobell's development as an<br />
artist. 000ooo000 </p>
