SPEECHi BY THE PRIME MINISTER, THE HON P J KEATING MP<br />
AUSTRALIAN TEACHERS UNION NATIONAL CONFERENCE<br />
MELBOURNE 15 JANUARY 1993<br />
Ladies and gentlemen<br />
i am very grateful for the opportunity to address you even<br />
though I am still officially of f duty.<br />
This was supposed to be a Curriculum day.<br />
But with our history being debated in the papers every day,<br />
our national honour sullied again in the British press, every<br />
day the expectation that one will be blamed for something else<br />
going wrong over there, one is inevitably drawn back to the<br />
world of controversy.<br />
And what better place to re-join it than a teachers conference<br />
an education conference?<br />
Education~ will always be controversial. There will always be<br />
arguentsabout it for the simple reason that it is so<br />
important. It concerns the most basic instincts: to advance the interests<br />
of our children. To give them a chance In a competitive<br />
world. To assure their future..<br />
Education is prone to passionate controversy because there is<br />
so much at stake.<br />
yet I imagine If the question were to be asked here What<br />
should an education system aim to achieve? there would be<br />
remarkably broad agreement.<br />
No doubt there would be argument over emphases and over<br />
details. But I don't think many people here would disagree<br />
fundamentally with an ans wer along the following lines.<br />
Our education system should prepare young Australians for<br />
life and for the future. K. UUil// i. 11~) </p>
<p>T1EL5:. Jan. 93 9: 59 No. 004 P. 02/ 13<br />

Our education system should serve the interests of each<br />
and every individual an it should serve the interests<br />
of Australia.<br />
It should be truly relevant: meaning it should instruct<br />
young people both in those values we hold as universal and<br />
unchangeable, and in the skills and knowledge they will<br />
need if they are to play a rewarding role in modern<br />
society. It should be both humanitarian and utilitarian: meaning<br />
it should have a moral core it should encourage belief<br />
and trust in the institutions, values and traditions of<br />
Australia and in liberal democracy; and it should equip<br />
students with a knowledge, including an historical<br />
knowledge, of Australia and the world.<br />
And it should teach the skills our country needs to grow<br />
and succeed, and our people need to increase their life<br />
opportunities and their material well-being.<br />
It should be efficient and it should be fair. It should<br />
deliver the best possible education to all Australians,<br />
regardless of their parents' circumstances.<br />
No doubt there are other useful aims and other ways Of<br />
expressing them, but I don't believe many people here would<br />
dispute them fundamentally.<br />
And I think it's important to remember that essentially there<br />
is agreement about education.<br />
We should etch this in our minds, and when we start to argue<br />
about the details or the best means of delivering education,<br />
we should recall that we share the view that education is<br />
vitally important, that It is a wellspring of useful, happy<br />
lives and a good society.<br />
Today we would add to this, I'm sure, our belief that an<br />
education system should offer education and training not just<br />
to the young but to people of aUl ages.<br />
The modern world demands that education should not stop with<br />
the end of secondary school or college or university.<br />
Increasingly, skcill formnat -oin x will be a lifelong process: the<br />
institutions will need to be there to provide them; and our<br />
schoolteachers will need to be there, providing young<br />
Australians with the knowledge and approach to learning which<br />
will allow them to acquire skills throughout their lives.<br />
The world of my own youth made no ouch demands.<br />
I left school at fifteen at a time when a very small<br />
proportion of Australians completed secondary school. In m-,<br />
area, Bankstown, I doubt if one in ten did.<br />
it was the norm to leave at fifteen in the 1950s.<br />

Like other fifteen year oids I could leave because there were<br />
jobs to go to.<br />
But the job I went to no longer exists.<br />
That is the crucial point to understand.<br />
The systems and technology which have so remarkably advanced<br />
productivity have come at the price of jobs.<br />
Many of the old jobs are gone. The so-called dead end jobs<br />
are largely gone.<br />
In the new world that our children are now inheriting the<br />
nation's wealth and life's opportunities will depend more and<br />
more on the skills of our workforce.<br />
it's been said before, but it was never so true education<br />
and training are the keys to our success.<br />
That is why in the past decade we have made the effort<br />
necessary to increase the number of students completing<br />
secondary school from 3 in 10 to 7 in<br />
It is why we have created over 200,000 higher education places<br />
the equivalent of twenty new universities.<br />
And it is why last year we decided to establiSh the Australian<br />
National Training Authority, as part of a wider process of<br />
reform to raise the quality and status of vocational education<br />
and training to the level of the other tiers of education.<br />
it is also why such a great responsibility devolves on you<br />
Australian teachers.<br />
You have already borne much of the burden of change, and you<br />
will have to bear more of it in future.<br />
It is on you that our success substantially depends.<br />
You will need assistance and today I pledge you that.<br />
We realise that these great structural changes ultimately are<br />
made by and affect people; and they will be made most<br />
effectively by people who have faith in what they are doing,<br />
and know that society has faith in them.<br />
We recognise that you who teach are the building blocks of<br />
educational achievement, and no reforms which fail to<br />
recognise the need for your professional trust and enthusiasm<br />
can hope to succeed.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen<br />
I said that there is general agreement about the aims of<br />
education. TEL </p>

The arguments generally concern the beat means of realising<br />
our ambitions.<br />
Most of these can be settled by discussion and negotiation. If<br />
we never seem to get the perfect system, we do manage to<br />
improve it.<br />
But there is a point in this debate beyond which we cannot go<br />
and that is the point which the Coalition presently<br />
occupies. Our political opponents will probably not argue with the<br />
higher purposes of education I spelt out a moment ago.<br />
But they will tell you that the best way to achieve those<br />
ambitions is to reduce the equity in delivery.<br />
They say equality equals mediocrity they cannot imagine that<br />
we can have excellence in a system which is fair.<br />
I cannot imagine having it in a system which is not fair.<br />
I say if we do not seek fairness and equity in something so<br />
basic as education we squander the efforts of generations, we<br />
betray our democratic values, and we condemn Australians in<br />
the future to the social trauma which flows from massive and<br />
deliberate inequality.<br />
Equity and excellence are nQt incompatible concepts.<br />
Nor do we accept the view which recurs so often through the<br />
Coalition's policies: that if the strong are to prosper,<br />
support for the weak must be diminished.<br />
Dr Hewson has flip-flopped on F tjtback and is now doing an<br />
exicriuciating imitation of a so'ft toy.<br />
He is trying to speak a new conciliatory language. He is<br />
talking about the need to put certainty in people's lives.<br />
The kind of certainty Jeff Kennett has put into the lives of<br />
Victorians. The kind of certainty which flows from the unfettered free<br />
market of which the real Dr Hewson is an avid disciple.<br />
The kind of certainty Mrs Thatcher brought to the lives of the<br />
British people and Reaganomics brought to Americans. The<br />
certainty which comes when the safety net is ripped away, and<br />
the creed takes hold that fairness equals mediocrity.<br />
The kind of certainty which the Federal President of Dr<br />
Hewson' s Liberal Party described last week in a speech in<br />
which he said one Nobel Prize winner is worth more than<br />
hundreds of mediocre practitioners"<br />
Worth more what? Worth more to whom? </p>
<p>TEL: 15 . Jan .93 9: 59 No. 004<br />
A speech in which he said, echoing the old or real-<br />
Dr Hewson, that lifting the average meant dragging up<br />
" laggards" and pulling down " leaders".<br />
One week before John Hewson pledged himself to putting more<br />
certainty in the lives of Australians, his Federal President,<br />
Mr Goldsworthy said this:<br />
Life has to become tougher with less security and<br />
greater uncertainty.<br />
Greater Uncertainty.<br />
Dr Hewson'a idea of certainty is the kind which underpins his<br />
education policy: that Is, the kind which flows from<br />
unleashing theoretical market forces on education.<br />
The kind which will follow from his policy of shifting<br />
resources from those schools which have the least resources to<br />
those which have the most.<br />
I do not want to dwell on the Opposition's policies I would<br />
rather talk about our own.<br />
But Some remarks must be made about education under the<br />
Coalition. The Coalition proposes a system of student vouchers for<br />
vocational training. They would take the Government's growth<br />
commitment of $ 720 million and re-direct it through a voucher<br />
scheme: and, in doing that, they would remove the foundations<br />
of our agreement with the States and Territories to establish<br />
the Australian National Training Authority and a national<br />
approach to planning.<br />
These vouchers would be available to young people on or about<br />
the youth wage levels of $ 3.00 or $ 3.50 an hour. Those on<br />
higher wages would not be eligible.<br />
To take advantage of a voucher, a young person would be<br />
required to negotiate an employment contract involving time<br />
of f for training, or find training opportunities outside of<br />
working hours.<br />
The voucher policy is both inequitable and unworkable. It is<br />
an administrative fantasy. It raises doubts about whether the<br />
growth funding would ever be spent. Certainly there must be<br />
doubt whether it will be spent where it is needed.<br />
Indeed it may be more than an oversight that the Coalition has<br />
not included Sny funding provision for the voucher policy in<br />
the coatings for 1Fightback Mark II.<br />
The Coalition's policies on vocational training threaten to<br />
give concrete expression to John Foward's fantasy about dead<br />
end jobs. </p>
<p>TEL: 15. Jan. 93 9: 59 No. 004 P. 06/ 13<br />
6<br />
In combination they would destroy our Chances of building 8<br />
skilful society by removing the essential funding, structures<br />
and incentives.<br />
The same thinking governs their policy on University<br />
education, and similar results would follow.<br />
The Opposition want to allow those who can afford to do so to<br />
pay for a place at University, even if they have not earned a<br />
subsidised place on the basis of academic merit.<br />
The cost of a university degree is between $ 25,000 and<br />
$ 130,000.<br />
Existing fee-free places would become subsidised places in an<br />
ill-defined system of student vouchers.<br />
We do not yet know what level of cost will be covered by the<br />
voucher. We do know that universities would be free to set their own<br />
fees on a11 courses.<br />
And we know that students would be personally liable for costs<br />
in excess of the voucher's value.<br />
The consequences for equity of access to University are plain<br />
and unmistakable.<br />
As far as schooling is concerned, I suppose I could do worse<br />
than simply ask for a minute's silence while we think of Mr<br />
Kennett* You don't need me to tell you about Mr Kennett.<br />
The alternative Commonwealth government has in mind<br />
dismantling public education in Australia. They will achieve<br />
this by a couple of simple policy measures, both of which were<br />
launched in Fightback I and live on in Fightback II.<br />
The only area of schooling which would receive any significant<br />
increase in support under a Hewson Government would be wealthy<br />
private education.<br />
At the same time Federal grants to the states, and by<br />
implication to State schools, will be cut. This is a blatant<br />
shift of public resources from State to private schools.<br />
It will be perceived in many quarters as an attack on<br />
government schools and may well re-open the old State Aid<br />
debate. The second major policy measure proposed by the Opposition<br />
would involve a major re-distribution of resources between<br />
non-government schools; the existing twelve categories of<br />
need would be collapsed into six, to the overwhelming<br />
advantage of those at the top. </p>
<p>T1EL5:. 2Tan. 93 9: 59 No. 004 P. 07/ 13<br />
7<br />
The type of private school which will benefit most from this<br />
re-distribution will include Scotch College and Melbourne<br />
Grammar, which are currently in Category One.<br />
These schools will receive a funding increase of over fifty<br />
per cent.<br />
The schools to receive the lowest increase will be you<br />
guessed it Aboriginal schools and special schools for<br />
students with a disability. That is, those schools currently<br />
in Category Twelve.<br />
We are talking about more than policy differences here. These<br />
are policies reflecting an ideological fixation with the<br />
belief that to quote John Hewson Mark I the poor will drag<br />
us down. The same school of thought which insists that equity<br />
and excellence can't co-exist. That you can't raise the<br />
average without helping undeserving " laggards".<br />
In so far as the HewSon funding increases will provide for<br />
needy private schools, the Federal Government's announced<br />
increases will effectively do the same, and in a climate of<br />
stability and certainty for the entire sector.<br />
Under the Government's policy, schools in category 12 will<br />
receive real increases in Federal funding every year until the<br />
Year 2000. Schools like Scotch College and Melbourne Grammar<br />
will simply have their much smaller grants maintained at the<br />
some level in real terms.<br />
If Hewson's promised windfall to wealthy private schools does<br />
have the effect of re-igniting the State Aid debate, questions<br />
about education quality, teacher training and schools reform<br />
will be buried under arguments about resource allocation<br />
acrimony of the kind which polarised the Australian community<br />
for a decade in the 1960s.<br />
if there is anyone involved in Australian education who<br />
believes there is no substantial difference between the<br />
Government and the opposition, they should think again.<br />
As my colleague Kim Beazley has said, the Liberal Party's<br />
education policy is a triumph of ideology over rationality.<br />
I think it is fair to say that Government policy has tried to<br />
attend to needs and facts.<br />
In higher education, for instance, through a period of<br />
exceptional growth we have been able to maintain a fair system<br />
of student income support and provide undergraduate and postgraduate<br />
courses without up-front fees.<br />
The challenge now is to consolidate the expanded system and<br />
improve its quality.<br />
We will continue to provide for growth there will be a<br />
further 25,000 increase in student numbers between 1992 and<br />
1994. TEL </p>
<p>EL: 15. Jan. 93 9: 59 No. 004 P. 08/ 113<br />
8<br />
And we will provide for exciting a= w forms of opportunity<br />
through the development of the Open Learning Initiative.<br />
I am well aware that, despite this growth, excess demand for<br />
university places remains high.<br />
The answer is not to provide a university place for all who<br />
apply. Apart from being an unreasonable burden on taxpayers, it would<br />
result in 8 major mismatch between the skills we have and the<br />
skills we need.<br />
The answer lies in the provision of fair access to a<br />
comprehensive and balanced range of education and training<br />
options. To achieve this we will need, not only measured<br />
growth for universities, but a major expansion and improvement<br />
of vocational education and training by which I mean both<br />
entry level training arrangements and more advanced TAFE<br />
courses. I am sure most of you are aware of the initiatives we have<br />
taken last year.<br />
Under a new national vocational education and training system<br />
an additional $ 720 million will be provided over the 1993-1995<br />
triennium. It will be a genuinely national system, with agreed goals and<br />
priorities established through a Ministerial Council, end<br />
planned and funded through the Australian National Training<br />
Authority. The system will enjoy the close involvement of industry and<br />
encourage the growth of a network of high quality training<br />
providers. it is an historic initiative, and one of which we are very<br />
proud. it's a rational, decisive and coherent response to-change. A<br />
response to need. It will bring us, within the decade, up to<br />
the level of the best in the world.<br />
Considerable as the undertaking is, in a sense the development<br />
of ANTA represents only part of 8 wider strategy of taking a<br />
national approach to education.<br />
This dates back to the Hobart Declaration on Schooling in 1989<br />
when, for the first time in our history, Australia's eight<br />
State and Territory education ministers agreed on national<br />
goals. For the first time the development of frameworks for national<br />
curriculum and assessment in Australian schools was set in<br />
train. TEL </p>
<p>TEL: 15.3an. 93 9: 59 No. 004 P. 09/ 13<br />
9<br />
For the first time employers were brought to the negotiating<br />
table on education issues.<br />
When all eight of the National Curriculum Statements on key<br />
learning areas and their assessment profiles are completed in<br />
June this year, for the first time parents and employers will<br />
have access to common curriculum frameworks which relate to<br />
all Australian schools.<br />
We will be able to produce education resource materials to<br />
support the national statements at a fraction of their present<br />
cost: and these economies of scale will also make regular<br />
curriculum review and renewal much easier.<br />
Beyond the material gains there is, if you like, the national<br />
one. As we approach the second century of our nationhood, we<br />
will have at last an education system which can meet the<br />
nation's needs and express its character and purpose.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen<br />
Earlier I said that the Government is aware of the change<br />
teachers have had to accommodate in recent years.<br />
And we are aware that change is going to continue in the next<br />
decade. As Kim Beazley points out in his Ministerial<br />
Statement, the prospect is daunting.<br />
it will save you from an insufferably long speech if I simply<br />
recommend his Statement to you, and progress quickly toward<br />
the Prime Ministerial prerogative of announcing the good news.<br />
It goes without saying that the success of our educational<br />
endeavours depends critically on teachers.<br />
The Government is of the view that the vast majority of<br />
teachers are dedicated and well able to deliver the necessary<br />
change. There is no doubt that not all the community is so well<br />
disposed. There a belief that some teachers are not<br />
contributing, and even though this may not be in proportion to<br />
the facts, the hard truth is that the teaching profession<br />
cannot afford to carry either the passengers or the reputation<br />
that goes with them.<br />
For while education depends on many players, it depends most<br />
of all on teachers: on their skills and their understanding<br />
of future directions.<br />
This is an age when success depends on productivity<br />
improvement and industry reform, and the education industry<br />
can be no exception.<br />
All parties involved, especially employers and teacher unions,<br />
will have to take up the challenge. I don't believe that<br />
should be a cause for anxiety: in my experience, those who </p>
<p>TEL<br />
have taken on the task of industry reform never want to return<br />
to the old industrial culture.<br />
We are aware that change is stressful both the experienced<br />
of change and the anticipation of it. We are aware of the<br />
absolute need for support.<br />
The typical teacher today was trained twenty years ago when<br />
only about thirty per cent of students Completed secondary<br />
school. Support and training are required to meet the needs of the<br />
extra forty per cent of students who now complete it.<br />
Work is continuing on the development of the key competencies<br />
essential for effective participation in the emerging forms of<br />
work and work organisation, and these will require new<br />
expertise from the teachers and trainers who will deliver<br />
them. There will be increased demands on teachers to keep up with<br />
developments in subject content, communications technology,<br />
Interactive computer software; and in coming to grips with<br />
the new structures which will integrate schools, TAFE and<br />
higher education.<br />
To help equip teachers for the challenges they face, to<br />
encourage and increase their professionalism, to give them the<br />
training and support they need, I am pleased to announce today<br />
that the Federal Government will commit $ 130 million over the<br />
next three years.<br />
million has been allocated to support the development of<br />
the seven key competencies to a stage where they can be<br />
incorporated successfully into the school curriculum. About<br />
million of this allocation will be earmarked for teacher<br />
training. Up to $ 105 million will be available for new professional<br />
development activities over the next three years.<br />
At this stage I might make the observation that these measures<br />
hold a particular significance for the women who comprise<br />
seventy per cent of the teaching workforce.<br />
Raising the status of teachers, as we are determined to do,<br />
raises the status of women and enables them to contribute more<br />
effectively to national objectives.<br />
It is perhaps significant that this organisation has been the<br />
means of career breakthroughs for two of your past leaders<br />
Di Foggo, your former President who is now on the Industrial<br />
Relations Commission, and Jennie George, another former<br />
President, who is now Assistant-Secretary of the ACTU.<br />
I might say also thiit these new measures of professional<br />
support will assist women who need to refresh their skills on<br />
return to the profession after a period of parental leave.<br />

Sixty million dollars will be provided over the next three<br />
years to establish a National Teachers' Professional<br />
Development Program to renew and increase teachers' knowledge<br />
of their subject disciplines.<br />
Some of the funds will go towards support for National Teacher<br />
Forums which provide opportunities for teachers and university<br />
academic staff to share information.<br />
The Government will be allocating five million dollars towards<br />
a Quality schooling Program which, in addition to funding<br />
projects in the areas of school leadership, school<br />
organisation and student welfare, will support the<br />
establishment of the proposed National Teaching Council.<br />
The National Teaching Council, we Sincerely hope, will be an<br />
important step towards higher levels of professionalism among<br />
teachers, and a vehicle for the greater involvement of<br />
teachers in the reform of education and the teaching<br />
profession itself.<br />
if the object of providing these new funds can be summarised,<br />
it is to allow teachers to play a central role in determining<br />
their own professional development needs within the context of<br />
emerging national priorities.<br />
There is no question that our aims will not be fulfilled<br />
without improving the productivity of teachers.<br />
There will have to be changes in the way teachers work.<br />
The National Project on the Quality of Teaching and Learning<br />
has developed the National Schools Project which, in 150<br />
schools across Australia, has introduced new ways of working<br />
with the potential for real productivity gains.<br />
These include greater use of para professionals; flexible<br />
timetabling outside traditional school hours; and flexible<br />
class sizes to suit the needs of schools.<br />
Flexibility is the key in modern education, as it is in modern<br />
industry and business and as it must be in government and<br />
unions. it goes without saying that governments need to work with<br />
teachers and their unions and with education systems to<br />
develop ways of working which will create a more effective<br />
teaching environment and a better quality education.<br />
The need for teachers to renew and expand their knowledge and<br />
skills, and to modify their teaching methods, presents an<br />
obvious challenge for teacher education of all kinds.<br />
The Federal Govern-ment recognises, in particular, the<br />
important role played by higher education institutions in the<br />
pre-service and in-service training of teachers. </p>

As the major funding source for Australian Universities, the<br />
Federal Government provides over $ 420 million a year for<br />
teacher training within higher education institutions.<br />
Teacher education faculties have had their fair share of<br />
change and uncertainty in recent times, particularly in the<br />
wake of major reforms in the higher education system.<br />
They have also had their fair share of criticism.<br />
Not all the criticism is justified, but doubtless some is. It<br />
is indisputable that staffing rigidities in many teacher<br />
education faculties are an obstacle to the renewal of courses.<br />
it is significant that fifty per cent of teacher education<br />
academics were school teachers before 1973 and only twenty per<br />
cent have taught in schools in the 1980s.<br />
To their credit, many universities have established strategies<br />
for the renewal of their education faculties, and others are<br />
developing them. For those institutions the Government will<br />
advance operating grant funding to assist in the early<br />
retirement of staff.<br />
Ladies and gentlemen<br />
The announcement of this new funding package for the<br />
professional development of teachers is just one element of a<br />
comprehensive policy framework encompassing all the sectors of<br />
school, TAFE and higher education.<br />
Our goal remains to make education accessible to all, and, in<br />
particular, to assist those people in the workforce who need<br />
further training or re-training to keep their jobs and their<br />
industries alive.<br />
We say that a fair and equitable education system, especially<br />
a fair and equitable school system, will as readily deliver<br />
excellence and opportunity as an unfair one.<br />
And we say that a fair one will deliver a good society.<br />
We see our efforts in education as an effort to extend<br />
Australian social democracy bringing our educational<br />
standards up to those we have achieved in such areas as<br />
health, social security, human rights including the rights of<br />
women. We should be and can be as good at education as we are at<br />
these things, which is to say as good as any country in the<br />
world. And to be good at education is to be both excellent and<br />
equitable. Education in the 1990s is the machinery which will deliver us<br />
a prosperous, strong and good society In the twenty-first<br />
century. 4 P. 12/ 11-</p>

It is the Vehicle of change and there is no-one else to drive<br />
it but you the teachers of Australia.<br />
So we will support you, and work with you, and we will create<br />
the education system which Australians have a right to and we<br />
a11 want.<br />
