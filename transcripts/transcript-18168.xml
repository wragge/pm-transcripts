A new arts precinct in the heart of Glenorchy was officially opened by Prime Minister Julia Gillard and Tasmanian Senators Carol Brown and Lisa Singh today.</p>
<p>Stage One of the $15.9 million Glenorchy Art and Sculpture Park features an open recreation space designed to connect communities and boost tourism.</p>
<p>The park boasts new lighting and sound infrastructure, a boardwalk, seating, shelters and barbecue facilities.</p>
<p>The Federal Government invested $2.7 million in the Stage One development through the Regional and Local Community Infrastructure Program (RLCIP), partnering with the Tasmanian Government and Glenorchy City Council.</p>
<p>Last month, the Federal Government announced it would provide $2.32 million to fund Stage Two works as part of the first round of the $1 billion Regional Development Australia Fund (RDAF).</p>
<p>Stage Two works, commencing next year, include the construction of new shared paths, additional landscaping, and a building to service the ferry jetty.</p>
<p>The ferry jetty will help connect the park to the Museum of Old and New Art and the city of Hobart.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister said the precinct combined social, environmental and economic benefits.</p>
<p>The Federal Government is committed to ensuring all Australians have access to arts and culture, no matter where they live.</p>
<p>More than 50,000 people are expected to visit the park every year, with that number expected to grow to 100,000 over the next five years.</p>
<p>Stage One design and construction works created 50 short term jobs and the opening of the park will support 10 long-term positions. </p>
