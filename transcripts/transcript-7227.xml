PRIME. MINISTER<br />
CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY EMBARGOED UNTIL DELIVERY<br />
SPEECH BY THE PRIME MINISTER<br />
OPENING OF " OLD MASTERS NEW VISION" EXHIBITION<br />
CANBERRA -30 SEPTEMBER 1987<br />

Ladies and gentlemen<br />
The Phillips Collection in the north-west suburbs of<br />
Washington D. C. has long been recognised as one of the<br />
compulsory stops on any tour of the art galleries of<br />
America. This is nothing less then a superb exhibition. So it should<br />
be: it is drawn from one of the world's great private<br />
collections. It stretches from El Greco to Rothko, and its breadth and<br />
excellence is a stunning tribute to the taste and vision and<br />
dedication of Duncan Phillips, who began assembling the<br />
paintings more than seventy years ago.<br />
In its early days it was, as the exhibition catalogue notes,<br />
the first real museum of modern art in the United States.<br />
Today it stands as a monumental and yet still highly<br />
personal, exposition of the entire development of European<br />
and American modernism.<br />
By the time of his death in 1966, Duncan Phillips, assisted<br />
by his wife Marjorie Phillips, had personally created a<br />
comprehensive Art Museum tracing that development through<br />
more than two thousand paintings. He had provided as well<br />
the buildings which house the col ' lection, and an endowment<br />
which he hoped would provide for its future.<br />
For it now to be available for Australians to see here in<br />
Australia is an achievement of which all those responsible<br />
can be proud.<br />
We are particularly indebted to James Mollison, who several<br />
years ago first broached the subject of an Australian tour<br />
with the custodians of the Phillips Collection in<br />
Washington. 0015~ 2' </p>
<p>it is a particular pleasure to welcome tonight Mr Laughlin<br />
Phillips, the current Director of the Collection and the son<br />
of Duncan Phillips.-<br />
This is the fourth major international exhibition displayed<br />
by the Australian National Gallery, following the Chinese<br />
Entombed Warriors Exhibition, the Great Impressionists, and,<br />
last year, the 20th Century Masters from the Metropolitan<br />
Museum of Art in New York.<br />
They were all highly successful events and in response to<br />
public demand, the Council of the Australian National<br />
Gallery recently moved to work toward staging a major<br />
international exhibition each year and to share this with<br />
two other Australian cities.<br />
I am confident " Old Masters New Visions" will prove an<br />
equally outstanding success with the Australian public, here<br />
in Canberra, and in Adelaide and Perth later.<br />
As the great Australian painter, Tom Roberts, said: " By<br />
making art the perfect expression of one time and one place,<br />
it becomes art for all times and of all places."<br />
There are many such " perfect expressions" in " Old Masters<br />
New Visions" with Renoir's " Luncheon of the Boating Party"<br />
one of the finest.<br />
If Tom Roberts is right, the perfection of these works<br />
ensures they are statements of equal relevance and<br />
importance to Australians in 1987 as to the first audiences<br />
who saw them.<br />
It is that durable perfection which provides the basis for<br />
my confidence in the success of " Old Masters New Visions"<br />
Ladies and gentlemen<br />
That the ANG has staged these four major exhibitions as<br />
well as presenting its continuing displays provides proof,<br />
if any were needed, that it has established itself as an<br />
outstanding art museum with a world-wide reputation.<br />
The work by many individuals that goes on behind the scenes<br />
of exhibitions such as this rarely receives the praise it<br />
deserves. So I want to express my appreciation of their efforts to<br />
James Mollison and his staff of the Australian National<br />
Gallery, and to their counterparts in the Art Galleries of<br />
Western Australia and South Australia which will also host<br />
this exhibition.<br />
Such major exhibitions, of course, could not go ahead<br />
without the assistance of Commonwealth indemnity. I am<br />
pleased that the Federal Government was able this ' year to<br />
increase the indemnity ceiling to $ 250 million. 00jL-2~ </p>
<p>3.<br />
But the support of a considerable number of private<br />
individuals and organisations is required as well if<br />
exhibitions of this nature are to be staged.<br />
Merrill Lynch, as the world sponsor of the tour, deserves<br />
our special thanks. A number o ' f other companies including<br />
QANTAS, Australian Airlines and Capital Seven TV have also<br />
provided valuable support.<br />
Increasingly, private sponsors are being involved in<br />
Australia in the acquisition and display of art work for the<br />
benefit of the whole community. As art prices rise, this<br />
sponsorship will become more necessary.<br />
The Australian National Gallqxy's own Foundation in the<br />
United States has proved very successful in the few years<br />
since it was established.<br />
At dinner this evening the Gallery will be launching a new<br />
Foundation to act as a fundraiser within Australia for<br />
corporate and private support of its activities.<br />
I commend this initiative and trust it will receive the<br />
support of a wide cross-section of the Australian community.<br />
In opening " Old masters New Visions" it is essential to<br />
remember with gratitude the generosity, philanthropy and<br />
taste with which Duncan Phillips assembled his collection<br />
and opened it to the public.<br />
Equally we should hope that we will see Australian art<br />
patrons increasingly display those same attributes in their<br />
support of art, and art galleries, in this country. 011G </p>
