f or concerned action to preserve our common environment.<br />
This year the international theme for e-Day is twater".<br />
Australia is particularly aware of the need to conserve<br />
our water resources and use them wisely. We need to ensureadequate<br />
quality and quantity water for agriculture<br />
and our major cities and on a smaller, often local scale<br />
to protect urban waterways from pollution and degradation.<br />
In this way we will help preserve essential breathing spaces<br />
in our cities. 00000oo0000<br />
