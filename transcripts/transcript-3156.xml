The Queen to Return to Australia<br />
I am pleased that it will be possible for The Queen<br />

This had been her hope after fulfilling her constitutional<br />
rluties in the United Eingdom.<br />
I know that the Premiers of South Australia and<br />
Western Australia, who have been kept informed, share my<br />
Odlight. It will mean many hours of additional travelling<br />
by air for The Queen but she does not want to disappoint the<br />
peo'ple of outh Australia, Western Australia and the-Northern<br />
Territory. It has been ten years since The Queen has visited<br />
those States and the Northern Territory.<br />
The Queen will now return to Australia through<br />
Darwin to carry out engagementn with The Prince Philip in<br />
Adelaide ( Friday 8 March), Perth ( Saturday 9 March) and Darwin<br />
(' iunlday 10 Mlnrch). The Queen and The Prince Philip accompanied by<br />
The Princess Anne and Captain Mark Phillips will arrive in<br />
Canberra from Port Moresby on Wednesday 27 February.<br />
Immediately after her arrival at Fairbairn RAAF Base<br />
The Queen, The Prince Philip, The Princess Anne and Captain<br />
Mark Phillips will drive to Civic Centre, Canberra, for a formal<br />
ceremonial welcome to be followed by a walk around part of<br />
City Hill to enable them to meet and talk to the citizens of the<br />
National Capital. The Queen and The Prince Philip will stay at Government<br />
House, Canberra. The Princess Anne and Captain Mark Phillips will<br />
travel to Sydney as planned to stay overnight with the Governor<br />
of New South Wales and Lady Cublero<br />
