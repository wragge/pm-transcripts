<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>What were your thoughts when you went in . . . </p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Itâs still very relevant today, itâs still being acted out, played out and I think thatâs fascinating.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>How long do you think it will be before you go across the border into North Korea yourself â given that Australiaâs now recognizing it?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>I think it could come quicker than we would have imagined a few years ago.  I think itâs a tremendous breakthrough and I think President Kim Dae-jung deserves an enormous amount of praise from the rest of the world for what heâs done.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Would you go to North Korea yourself?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>If it were appropriate to do so, yes.  Once you establish diplomatic relations with a country of course.  But itâs something where Korea has taken the lead on, I will take my cue from Kim Dae-jung.  But we support what heâs doing.  What heâs doing is very forward looking, very courageous and I am greatly encouraged by the fact that heâs going to have a Summit meeting.  Australia supports that with diplomatic recognition, along with other countries and I think itâs a huge breakthrough.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Itâs your first visit to the DMZ, what were your impressions of standing in that room â you had North Korean guards looking in at you.  It must have been a strange feeling.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Well, as I said itâs a bit of history but itâs also unfinished history.  It was, it reminded me of forty years ago what I remember, but I am also reminded that unlike visiting a battlesite of World War I or II or Vietnam War, there is still an issue to be resolved.  Itâs still a part of current political current political events and that gives it a character which is different to just visiting a battle site of a former war.</p>
<p>JOURNALIST:</p>
<p>Did you want to come here personally, did you make the request to come here, or were you invited?</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER:</p>
<p>Oh, it was obviously a possibility once I was coming to Seoul and I said yes very enthusiastically.</p>
<p>Thank you</p>
