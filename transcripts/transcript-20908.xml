I am pleased to launch today the Prime Minister';s Running For A Future Team, a new partnership aimed a developing and fostering excellence in distance running and promoting Australian athletics.</p>
<p>The purpose of the initiative is to help identify and foster Australia';s marathon stars of the future.</p>
<p>Each year a five member team will be selected in conjunction with The Sydney Marathon Festival.  The Running For A Future Team will consist of up-and-coming marathon runners who show the potential, desire, talent and attitude required to achieve on the world stage.</p>
<p>The first Prime Minister';s Team will include Scott Westcott, Shane Hayes and Kate Siebold-Crosbie.  I warmly congratulate these three athletes on being the first selected for the team.  The remaining two places will be filled by the first Australian man and the first woman in the Sydney Marathon on Sunday.</p>
<p>An important focus of this new initiative will be on providing mentors for the members of the team.  Marathon runners who have achieved success at an elite level, as well as business leaders have agreed to act as mentors to members of the team.</p>
<p>I am delighted to also announce that Pat Farmer, Robert De Castella, Steve Moneghetti, Kerryn McCann and Tani Ruckle will be offering their services as mentors for the Prime Minister';s Team.</p>
<p>With the commitment of their mentors, the athletes involved will be given valuable assistance and guidance as they strive to achieve their goals.</p>
<p>The Running For A Future Team was proposed and developed by the Member for Macarthur, Pat Farmer.</p>
<p>In addition, Athletics Australia has played an important part in developing the concept and has helped identify three of this year';s team.</p>
<p>Pat Farmer has described the requirements for achieving at sports highest levels in the following words:</p>
<p>“Success in sport isn';t just about athletic ability – it';s about commitment, persistence and perseverance but even the most committed will admit that nobody can make it on their own. Although the marathon is seen as a solo sport, every successful athlete has a team, be they family, sponsors, coaches or mentors.”</p>
<p>The Australian Government is committed to partnership programmes that are designed to benefit promising Australian athletes.</p>
<p>All five runners in the PM';s Team will be competing in the 2003 Sydney Marathon Festival on Sunday.</p>
