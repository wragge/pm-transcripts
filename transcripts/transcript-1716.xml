Following is the text of a telegram which was sent today by<br />

Henry Bolte " In your telegram of 10th November, you<br />
said that some local employment work will be necessary<br />
and desirable in certain drought area districts and<br />
sought my confirmation that the cost of such works would<br />
fall within the grant element of Commonwealth assistance<br />
to Victoria. I am pleased to inform you that theCommonwealth<br />
will treat as eligible for grant assistance under drought<br />
assistance arrangements grants made by your Government to<br />
local authorities and government Instrumentalities to piovide<br />
necessary relief work In drought areas. Such grants should,<br />
of course, be limited to cases where the drought is clearly<br />
the cause of the unemployment."<br />
