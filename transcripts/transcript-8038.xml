TRANSCRIPT OF SPEECH DURING RECEIPT OF POSTCARDS<br />
FROM CHILDREN INVOLVED IN THE BROTHERHOOD OF ST<br />
LAURENCE'S NATIONAL PROMISE THE CHILDREN ACTION ON CHILD<br />
POVERTY CAMPAIGN, MURAL HALL, PARLIAMENT HOUSE, 22 JUNE<br />

PM: Let me conclude on a more general point about the<br />
motivation of politicians and the rationale of social<br />
justice programs such as we're discussing today and I<br />
want to be very direct in some of the things I'm about to<br />
say. It's very easy, very easy indeed to adopt a<br />
fashionable cynicism about politicians and to assume that<br />
they will only do something if they are pushed into it.<br />
That's an attitude which I see underlines these postcards<br />
where you make the claim, that is the Brotherhood makes<br />
the claim, and let me read it. I quote all politicians<br />
will only do something about it if they feel they have to<br />
at election time, for instance. Now, let me say to the<br />
Brotherhood quite deliberately, that I think that's a<br />
cheap shot. It may make you feel good to make a<br />
statement like that, but without any beating around the<br />
bush, let it be understood that that statement is a false<br />
statement and an abundantly false statement. More<br />
directly it's an un-Christian statement. There is no<br />
foundation for it. I can tell you that speaking for<br />
myself that's not my attitude to social justice and it's<br />
not my attitude to what politics is about and I don't<br />
often presume to speak for John Hewson or Senator<br />
Macklin, but I know that it's not their attitude. It's a<br />
cheap shot, it's an untrue statement, it's an un-<br />
Christian statement. I think any closer analysis of the<br />
new services we have delivered to disadvantaged<br />
Australians would show that they haven't been based on a<br />
judgement that there may be votes in them. Instead they<br />
have been part of an overall strategy from day one of<br />
change based on a fundamental analysis of who really is<br />
in need in this community. Let me be quite specific.<br />
The reason that we can afford to be spending in this<br />
financial year, as we are, over $ 2 billion on kids in low<br />
income families the only reason why we can afford to be<br />
doing that and are doing it is on the basis that we<br />
have decided to spend less money on those who are better<br />
of f. And I remind you that that has meant taking<br />
benefits away from people. It's meant levying new taxes<br />
on those who hadn't been paying their fair share. In<br />
other words, we've made some tough decisions. We've made </p>
<p>2<br />
some very unpopular decisions decisions that cost us<br />
votes at election time. I just ask you to recall the<br />
virilent campaigns that were waged against us in the<br />
media and I'm not talking about political opponents, I'm<br />
not trying to make a political issue, I'm talking about<br />
the campaigns that were waged in media and elsewhere.<br />
But remember those virilent campaigns that were waged<br />
against us on the assets test, the fringe benefits tax<br />
and the capital gains tax. Those weren't politically<br />
popular they cost us votes, they were on the basis of<br />
believing that benefits were being paid to those who<br />
didn't need them and we wanted the financial capacity to<br />
pay more to those who needed more. We made those<br />
decisions because we believe they were the right<br />
decisions to make. I think at the end of the day you<br />
would agree that it is a far better rationale for<br />
decision making than any responsiveness to lobbying<br />
campaign whether expressed for postcards or by any other<br />
means. And so I hope I can stand and join with my<br />
political colleagues here. We have our disagreements<br />
about needs, we have disagreements on philosophy, but I<br />
hope I speak for them in saying we reject the cheap shot<br />
that all politicians, all politicians, will only do<br />
something about it if they feel they have to, at election<br />
time for instance. I can assure you in conclusion that<br />
my Government has worked and will continue to work to<br />
improve the circumstances of the disadvantaged in our<br />
community. We know in the nature of things that neither<br />
my Government, or if some day it's Dr Hewson's government<br />
or someone else's government, we know that we will never<br />
be able to do everything that everyone in the community<br />
wants. But I can say to you that as far as this<br />
Government is concerned we're proud to look at the record<br />
and will continue to work to improve, as I say, the<br />
circumstances of the disadvantaged in our community. But<br />
obviously in these things and this is a truth reflected<br />
in your concern, a government cannot do it singlehandedly.<br />
The contribution made by the many community<br />
organisations notable, may I say, among them the<br />
Brotherhood of St Laurence and the Council for Social<br />
Service, those contributions are crucial. I commend you<br />
for the work that you've done, I commend you for your<br />
concern and I wish you continued success in your work. I<br />
hope that in future your observations about the<br />
motivations of all politicians will be somewhat more<br />
accurate. ends </p>
