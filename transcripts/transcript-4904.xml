AUSTRALIA<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR PRESS 30 NOVEMBER 1978<br />
Ministerial Changes<br />
The Prime Minister anno-nced today changes in the Ministry<br />
flowing from the decision to establish a separate Department<br />
of Industrial Relations and a Department of Employment and<br />
Youth Affairs. Mr. Street will become Minister for Industrial<br />
Relations and Mr. Viner, Minister for Employment and Youth<br />
Affairs. Under Mr. Street as Minister, the activities undertaken by the<br />
present Department of Employment and Industrial Relations have<br />
been considerably expanded.<br />
There has been a major e: x-ansion of employment and training<br />
programmes under this C-: vernment and a re-organisation and<br />
ex-ansion of the Cormmonw-; alth Employment Service. The<br />
programmes being implermnted in this area now include the<br />
National Employment and Training System, Special Youth<br />
Ep loyment Training Programme, Community Youth Support Scheme,<br />
Aoorenticeship Support Programmes, Commonwealth Rebate for<br />
A orentice Full-time Training, Relocation Assistance Scheme<br />
and the activities of the Trade Union Training Authority.<br />
In all, over 300,000 people have been helped through these<br />
schemes since the Government came to office.<br />
In the area of Industrial Relations substantial progress<br />
has been made over the last three years in reducing the<br />
level of industrial disruotion in terms of time lost, number<br />
of disputes and workers involved.<br />
In 1974 under the Labor Government there were 6.3 million<br />
ran days lost due to strikes. Last year, this had fallen to<br />
1.6 million; one quarter of the man days lost just three<br />
years earlier.<br />
This owes much to Mr. Street's firm but fair administration<br />
and his sensitive handling of his portfolio. The major<br />
reforms Mr. Street has -ade in this area include the establishment<br />
of the Industrial Relations Bureau and the National Labour<br />
Consultative Council; the introduction of secret postal ballots<br />
for union elections; greater protection for conscientious<br />
objectors; and the requirement that unions have their accounts<br />
audited and report regularly to their membership. </p>
<p>-2-<br />
The expansion and impOortance of these areas nake it nlow necessary<br />
that they should fall under separate portfolios, each of<br />
which will be under the control of a Cabinet Minister.<br />
Industrial Relations is a matter of great social and economic<br />
importance. These changes will introduce a new phase in the<br />
Industrial Relations of our nation. The mew arrangements will<br />
enable Mr. Street to devote greater attention to the avoidance<br />
and resolution of industrial disputes before significant<br />
damage is caused to the economy and inconrenience to the<br />
public. The Government will build on the advances already made<br />
in the industrial relations area by ensuring that the Department<br />
has greater resources to further encourage and stimulate the<br />
processes of communicationl and consultation at national,<br />
industry and enterprise level.<br />
The Department of industrial Relations will also havea<br />
positive role in developing policy advice in relation to<br />
the improvement of employer/ employee relations across industries,<br />
including aspects of the working environzent. A unit within the<br />
Department will be established to perform this role. In its<br />
co-ordinating role, it will work in close liaison with the<br />
Working Environment Division in the Department of Productivity.<br />
Mr. Viner will be ! Minister of Employment and Youth Affairs,<br />
an area of high priority for the Government. Z-1r. Viner will<br />
have responsibility for employment and the various training<br />
programmes which a-re at the present time under review.<br />
Mr Viner will be responsible for the Office of Youth Affairs,<br />
the establishment which was announced by this Government in<br />
February 1977. The office, whose charter is to coordinate<br />
and consult with Comm= onwealth Departments, States, Local<br />
Government and non-Government agencies on Commonwealth,<br />
Government programmes and proposals affecting youth, will be<br />
expanded and strengthened. Mr Viner will continue to be<br />
MiRister Assisting the Prime Minister.<br />
Senator Chaney will be appointed to become Minister for<br />
Aboriginal Affairs, and Mr: McLeay will he appointed Minister<br />
for Administrative Services. Senator Chaney will continue<br />
to be Minister Assisting the Minister for Education and<br />
Mr McLeay will continue to be Minister Assisting the Minister<br />
for Defence.<br />
A re-examination of the diverse functions of the Department<br />
of Environment, H~ ousing and Community Develoment has led<br />
the Government to conclude that greater Impetus would be<br />
given to the Government's policies by allocating these<br />
functions to Departments in which they fit logically and<br />
naturally. </p>
<p>i I -3-<br />
Mr Groom will become Minister for Housing and Construction.<br />
Responsibility for government policy on sports will be<br />
transferred to the Department of Home Affairs. The Minister<br />
for Home Affairs, Mr Ellicott, will thus have overall<br />
responsibility for government policy on cult'-ral and sporting<br />
affairs. Mr Newman, the Minister for National Develop. ent, to<br />
complement his existing responsibilities for decentralisation,<br />
will assume responsibility for urban planning and local<br />
government. Senator Webster will become Minister for Science and the Environment.<br />
This in particular will enable the Government's scientists<br />
and advisers on the environment to work more closely together<br />
to give effect to the Government's commitment to preserving<br />
and enhancing Australia's environment.<br />
As a consequence of the changes I have annou-ced today, the<br />
number of Ministers and the number of Departzents will remain<br />
unchanged. Further details of the changes in Ministerial and<br />
Departmental responsibilities and fuctions are contained in the<br />
attached statement. 0000000 </p>
