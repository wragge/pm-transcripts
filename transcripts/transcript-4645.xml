EMBARGO: 7.00 p. m.<br />
PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR PRESS 12 MARCH 1973<br />
ELECTORATE TALK<br />
One of my Government's first promises when we were elected<br />
just over two years ago was to restore the integrity and honesty<br />
of Government.<br />
Without integrity without the appearance and reality of<br />
integrity no government can hope to have the confidence of the<br />
people, or the trust of the people.<br />
We were determined to restore Australians faith in their national<br />
government and in the process of government. From the<br />
beginning, the government desired to reestablish the absolute<br />
propriety and unquestioned integrity that were a hallmark<br />
of the Menzies years in Australia.<br />
Because a number of areas needed review we acted quickly firmly<br />
and fairly. First, we took action in relation to the pecuniary<br />
interests of Ministers of the Crown. Within days of taking<br />
office, I wrote to every Minister asking for a full personal<br />
statement of their pecuniary interests. I was acting on the<br />
basic principle that Ministers in * a position of privilege<br />
must at all times avoid any conflict between public duty and<br />
private interest. Ministers staff were also required to meet this<br />
principle. Since that time, the. Government has decided that<br />
additional steps had to be taken to completelymeet the objective.<br />
A few weeks ago, I announced that Sir Nigel Bowen had agreed to<br />
chair a wide ranging judicial inquiry into matters relating to<br />
the question of public duty and private interest.<br />
A matter of public concern and comment the question of gifts<br />
to Ministers was also reviewed. Nowsr, Ministers who receive gifts<br />
on overseas visit must declare them to me as Prime Minister on their<br />
return. If gifts are more than token in nature, they are valued.<br />
and Ministers are then given an opportunity to purchase.<br />
The question of the selection and appointment of senior public<br />
servants has also been reviewed by my Government. We were determined<br />
to maintain one of the most important foundations of the<br />
Parliamentary system of Government the political neutrality of<br />
the public service. / 2 </p>
<p>My Government strongly believed one of the best safeguards of<br />
the long-term political neutrality of the public service was a<br />
system of appointment that prevents any person appointed for<br />
partisan reasons retaining permanent terms of office. We now<br />
have that system. Any Departmental head who is appointed without<br />
the recommendation of a special top level committee can be removed<br />
from office by an incoming government.<br />
Further, in amending the Act of Parliament to bring this about,<br />
we were also very conscious of the need to give special weight to the<br />
integrity of the Australian public service and in particular<br />
to the well-established principle of appointment on merit.<br />
The Government has also asked the Public Service Board to<br />
examine and report on a code of ethics for public servants and<br />
Commonwealth employees. The Government also has. under review<br />
the practice of retired parliamentarians, public servants and<br />
others once on the Commonwealth payroll continuing to receive<br />
superannuation and similar benefits if they take up further<br />
Commonwealth appointments.<br />
The question of propriety and the integrity of public administration<br />
in Australia has been canvassed in the Parliament this week in<br />
relation to a computer contract. The key and central question<br />
that my Government concerned itself with was whether in the<br />
awarding of this contract that justice was not only done, but<br />
was seen to be done. That had to be the issue.<br />
The Government in this case, was not convinced that justice had been<br />
done. We were sure that justice had not seen to be done.<br />
Accordingly, we took the only proper course the course we would<br />
take again in the same circumstance'-we recalled tenders.<br />
At the same time, we referred this whole question of Government<br />
employees working in the tendering process to Sir Nigel Bowen's<br />
inquiry into public duty and private interest.<br />
My Government has demonstrated again and again our fundamental<br />
commitment to restoring integrity to-public administration<br />
in Australia. Our record in this regard is without parallel in<br />
our history. As long as I lead the Government, there is no way known<br />
that anything less than the highest code and practice of public<br />
administration will be tolerated. </p>
