FOR PRESS: P. M. No 20/ 1970<br />
PRIME MINISTER HAi MINOR OPERATION<br />
The Prime Minister has had to cancel his planned meeting ir.<br />
the Chisholm By-Election in Melbourne tomorrow ( Monday) night.<br />
Mr. Gorton returned to Canberra today after undergoing a<br />
minor operation at the Mercy Hospital in Melbourne last week.<br />
Arrangements had been made for him to enter the hospital during the<br />
week's Parliamentary recess and the operation for a fistula was<br />
performed successfully last Wednesday.<br />
As it was only a minor operation, he had intended going ahead<br />
with his speaking engagement for tomorrow night. However, his<br />
doctor has advised that it would be preferable for Mr. Gorton to<br />
take it quietly for a few more days.<br />
