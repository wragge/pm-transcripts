PRIME MINISTER<br />
FOR MEDIA 10INDAY, 13 SEPTEMBER 1982<br />
ADDRESS AT OPENING OF CAPTION CENTRE, SYDNEY<br />
The opening of the Australian Caption Centre is an event of<br />
great importance to Australia. Over 800,000 people in Australia<br />
suffer from impaired hearing, many of those people will be<br />
helped enormously by the establishment of the Australian<br />
Caption Centre.<br />
SFor the first time they will be able to watch and understand<br />
television by way of captions which will be picked up by special<br />
decoding devices attached to their television sets. Th e captions<br />
won't be visible to other viewers.<br />
In order to help promote this service the Commonwealth<br />
Government last year provided significant funds to assist<br />
with the setting up of the Caption Centre. This year we are<br />
providing further funds to the Australian Caption Centre<br />
for the provision of further facilities for caption television<br />
programs. As well as supporting the Australian Caption Centre the<br />
Commonwealth provides the ABC with additional support to<br />
enable it to broadcast for seven hours a week caption programs<br />
in Sydney and Melbourne. This service is expected to begin<br />
in April of next year. The commercial television stations have<br />
so far not made any decisions about the use of captions but I<br />
hope that before too long and once there is total agreement on<br />
the kind of technology which ought to be used, ' but interpolating.<br />
and not captioned, I agree with the remarks that have been said<br />
about delay. There is always going to be new technology coming.,<br />
forward, there will always be better ways of doing it if you wait<br />
a while. This has been delayed a long while already and I don't<br />
believe that there is any excuse for further delay by the ABC<br />
or by commercial stations on the grounds of technology.<br />
Those with hearing difficulties will be able to, benefit as<br />
much from television as the rest of us do. That is the objective<br />
that we want to pursue and want to achieve. I hope therefore<br />
that caption television will eventually be available on all<br />
television stations.<br />
My colleague the Minister for Communications, has discussed<br />
this issue with the commercial television stations to obtain<br />
a clearer idea of the problems they see on implementing closed<br />
captioning on their programs. The Minister is examining urgently<br />
the issue of Australia adopting an industry wide standard for.<br />
captioning technology and the question of whether the Australian<br />
Broadcasting Tribunal should hold an inquiry into the wider<br />
introduction of closed captioning for the hearing impaired. ./ 2 </p>
<p>-2-<br />
Neil Brown who is here will be making an announcement on both'<br />
of these matters very soon.<br />
Television has become by far the most popular and in many<br />
respects the most influential source of information and entertainment<br />
in Australia and any section of the community which is unable<br />
to benefit from television is certainly at a disadvantage.<br />
Again, interpolating and not captioned, as a politician I think.<br />
television has a great many advantages because if you go on<br />
' live' people see what you say and the way you say it, or hear<br />
what you way and the way you say it and it is not interpreted<br />
as so often what politicians say is interpreted. So in the<br />
interests of overall accuracy and getting a fair judgement of<br />
whether it is State or Federal politicians or whoever else,<br />
that accuracy ought to be available to the 800,000 to 1 million<br />
people who have impaired hearing and who at the moment have to<br />
rely on the print media.<br />
The Caption Centre will help deaf people overcome that particular<br />
disadvantage that they have. It will enable them not only to keep<br />
in touch more easily with current events, but it will<br />
also help to make them more aware of various entitlements from<br />
Government. That is particularly important at a time like this<br />
just after the introduction of a Commonwealth Budget. People<br />
do need to be aware of the services and of the programs that<br />
are available if there are adjustments that affect them because<br />
one of the things that we found in recent times is the programs<br />
can be introduced by state or by Commonwealth and even though<br />
it might be advertising in relation to it, there is still an<br />
enormous gap in the awareness of average Australians as to their<br />
entitlements under the programs. Without captioning, up to a<br />
million people are going to be in a more difficult position in<br />
finding out what their entitlements. than the rest of us.<br />
The benefits-of new programs are obviously going to be better<br />
understood once television stations generally undertake<br />
captioning. This is. one of the responsibilities of Government<br />
but I think it is also the responsibility of television stations<br />
S and the media generally to help get the message across. That<br />
is another important and serious reason why not just the ABC but<br />
commercial television stations ought to adopt captioning as soon<br />
as possible. I am sorry for that interpolation again, with future<br />
technology there will be a way of immediate captioning and picking<br />
up what one says and translating that into a caption so that you<br />
don't need typists or shorthand writers or whatever.<br />
In helping with the establishment of the Caption Centre the<br />
Government has been, able to make an important contribution<br />
to makinr sure that all sections of the community are aware of the<br />
facts and are aware of their entitlements. The commitment by<br />
the Government to the Caption Centre is also indicative of our<br />
overall commitment to a caring society in which people who are<br />
in any way disadvantaged should be able to live as normal a life,. I<br />
as possible with every support from the community. In the case<br />
of the disabled they should be able to enjoy a meaningful home<br />
life and participate in all social, creative and recreational<br />
activities. That is a right to which all Australians are entitled<br />
and one which the Government will do everything in its power to<br />
meet. </p>
<p>There is an enormous amount, and again interpolating, of public<br />
education involved in this, the education of other people of<br />
what the difficulties are and how those difficulties can be<br />
overcome. I can remember John Hickman, as a quadriplegic<br />
and then as a lecturer at the Australian National Univeristy<br />
in his book ' One Step at a Time' describing some of his<br />
own experiences. He saw an advertisement in a newspaper of<br />
one of the major retail stores who had advertised special<br />
parking space for disabled people and it was going to be reserved<br />
for them close to the shopping centre so they wouldn't have to<br />
move too far to go and make their purchases. He thought this was<br />
great, and he pulled up his car and got into his chair and then<br />
found that there was no way at all that he could get from that<br />
parking centre into the shopping centre because there were steps<br />
which you couldn't put a wheel chair up or down. It wasn't<br />
a question of anyone having done that deliberately it was a<br />
question of lack of knowledge, lack of understanding of the<br />
efforts all of us can make which can contribute to disabled<br />
people-whatever the disablement might be-leading a more active<br />
and more participatory life in the normal life of the community.<br />
This Caption Centre and its work and the adoption of captions<br />
in television stations will do much not only to help disabled<br />
people in this case, those of the hearing impaired enjoy the<br />
programs, it will do a great deal I believe to help educate<br />
other Australians in ways which will assist disabled people<br />
to lead fuller lives within the Australian community.<br />
In opening this morning the Australian Caption Centre<br />
I would like to pay tribute to the efforts of all those<br />
people who over the past few years worked so hard to lay the<br />
groundwork for the establishment of this service. They have<br />
shown a dedication and a determination to give hearing impaired<br />
people real access to television and I am delighted to see that<br />
their efforts have been so successful. I pay tribute to them<br />
and I am glad they have been so persistent and it has been an<br />
honour for the Government to be able to provide some support<br />
S to make the opening of this centre a practical possibility.<br />
It is now going to be open for the ABC and to commercial interests<br />
to take advahtage of the opportunities that have been provided<br />
to demonstrate that they also are very much part of a caring<br />
society. It is with very great pleasure that I declare open the Australian<br />
Caption Centre. </p>
